50|$|Richard Witt's book Arithmeticall Questions, {{published}} in 1613, was a landmark {{in the history}} of compound interest. It was wholly devoted to the subject (previously called <b>anatocism),</b> whereas previous writers had usually treated compound interest briefly in just one chapter in a mathematical textbook. Witt's book gave tables based on 10% (the then maximum rate of interest allowable on loans) and on other rates for different purposes, such as the valuation of property leases. Witt was a London mathematical practitioner and his book is notable for its clarity of expression, depth of insight and accuracy of calculation, with 124 worked examples.|$|E
40|$|The <b>anatocism</b> is a {{mechanism}} that consists in taking compound {{interest for the}} creditor (from greek words “Ana” that means again and “tokos” that means interest). The thesis, in its first part, is oriented to showing {{the basis of the}} <b>anatocism</b> in the italian system and in other European country. Other aspects in the first chapter are: connection with money and interests. The second chapter is dedicated to the evolution of <b>anatocism</b> in Italy specifically in banking regulation: in effect a lot of questions have arisen around the application of <b>anatocism</b> by Italian banks. One of this problem was connected to the meaning of customary law. For twenty years Italian Courts had considered lawful the <b>anatocism</b> in banking system, but in 1999 the Supreme Court said that it was illegal because it wasn’t allowed by civil code (art. 1283). The job wants to retrace the story of <b>anatocism</b> and to examine in depth questions that are still open concerning the evolution of precedents (about the restitution of illegal compound interests, burden of proof and prescription period). Moreover wants to analyze the new law that probably decided that <b>anatocism</b> in banking system isn’t allowed anymore. The aim of the job is to meditate on basis of <b>anatocism</b> especially on its basic reasons and its connection with other type of interest...|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{is about the}} prohibition of <b>anatocism</b> in the roman law system: it tries to explain how and when this prohibition was established and how the debtor could plead himself against the creditor’s legal action to obtain the payment of compound interests. The research has showed that the prohibition of <b>anatocism</b> came into force in the roman law system probably between the Ist century B. C. and the IInd century A. C. and it was completed by a gradual improvement of the debtor’s trial defence, that became effective during the IIIrd century A. C. also against the capitalization of interests, especially throught the inversion {{of the burden of}} proof laid down by CI. 4. 30. 3. Subsequently it has emerged that the prohibition of <b>anatocism</b> concerned first of all the usurae usurarum but also the capitalization of interests, although the debtor’s trial defence was improved later, in consequence of the characteristic of the models used to strike money loans (abstract stipulatio or singrapha) and the connected problem of the proof of the breach of the prohibition. The exegesis of the passages of the severian jurisprudence was useful to understand the reason (῾ratio᾽) of the prohibition: it was probably an autonomous, hard and fast prohibition but always directed to prevent the uncontrollable growth of the debt. Finally it has resulted that the Justinian’s reform of the general discipline of interests had the great merit to make clear and fix the the prohibition of <b>anatocism...</b>|$|E
40|$|With the {{argument}} that, necessarily, compound interest implies <b>anatocism,</b> the Brazilian Judiciary has been determining that, specially {{for the case}} of  debt amortization {{in accordance with the}} so called Tabela Price, when we have constant payments, the use of simple interest. With the same determination occurring {{in the case of the}} Constant Amortization Scheme, when the payments follow arithmetic progressions.   However, as simple interest lacks the property of time subdivision, it is shown that as in the case of constant payments, the adoption of simple interest in the case of payments following an arithmetic progression results in amortization schemes that are financially inconsistent. In the sense that the determination of the outstanding principal in accordance with the prospective, retrospective and of recurrence methods lead to conflicting  results. To this end, four different variations of the use of simple interest are numerically analyzed. </p...|$|E
40|$|Compound {{interest}} {{is a concept}} that, historically, has been tainted with an essentially mercantile flavour. It relates to the custom of banks in capitalising on the interest due by a client upon the expiry of a certain interval (the rest). Such practice, zealously vilified in some quarters whilst acclaimed as a prosperous enterprise in others, has been challenged more recently, at both judicial level and under statute, {{in the case of}} Italy. This contribution, in briefly recalling the origin of the concept of <b>anatocism</b> (the orthodox definition of compound interest) and, therefore, its Roman predecessor, the usurarum usurae and the futurarum usurarum usurarae (usurae), seeks to examine the state-of-the-art apparatus applicable to compound interest in the British common law. Such deliberations will thereupon give rise to what this paper aspires to describe as a peculiar development. In this respect, attention is drawn to the recent Consumer Rights Act 2015 {{and the manner in which}} the bank customer is theoretically entitled to rely upon it, with specific reference to the compound interest clause. As regards the 'Continental experience', the Italian jurisdiction, awash with judicial twists and incandescent doctrinal views on this topic, is discussed and analysed as a compelling and stimulating comparator...|$|E
