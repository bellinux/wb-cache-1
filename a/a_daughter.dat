40|$|An {{adolescent}} daughter’s {{relationship with}} her father is strained owing to her negative feelings, such as opposition, defiant attitude, and hatred, toward father. However, further details regarding these feelings and how they evolve during <b>a</b> <b>daughter’s</b> growing years have not been examined yet. In this study, a questionnaire survey was administered to female college students, asking about their negative feelings toward their fathers {{in the present and}} during their junior high school days. The results showed that physiological hatred, such as shunning her father, is not very conspicuous, although some psychologists have indicated physiological that it is a peculiarity of <b>an</b> adolescent <b>daughter.</b> In addition, <b>a</b> <b>daughter’s</b> negative feelings about coming in contact with her father weaken as she grows older. However, <b>a</b> <b>daughter’s</b> negative feelings about her father’s uninterested and dominant attitude are stronger during college than junior high school days. Moreover, it is suggested that <b>a</b> <b>daughter’s</b> negative feelings during college differ from those during junior high school days in terms of quality and contents...|$|R
