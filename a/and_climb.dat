5|$|The control {{surfaces}} operated {{in much the}} same way as other aircraft, with the exception of the innovative automatic pull-out system. Releasing the bomb initiated the pull-out, or automatic recovery <b>and</b> <b>climb,</b> upon the deflection of the dive brakes.

5|$|Knuckles' Chaotix is a side-scrolling, action-platform {{game that}} shares {{the same basic}} {{gameplay}} elements that defined earlier entries in the Sonic series. New to this game, however, is a partner mechanic which tethers the player to a computer or human-controlled partner. This tether behaves like a rubber band, and requires the player(s) to use its physics to maneuver through the zones. Players can choose between playing as five different characters, each with their own unique set of moves. Knuckles the Echidna can glide <b>and</b> <b>climb</b> walls, Mighty the Armadillo can jump up and kick off walls, Espio the Chameleon can run along walls and ceilings, Vector the Crocodile can boost through the air <b>and</b> <b>climb</b> walls, and Charmy Bee can fly and hover in the air. There are two other partner characters, Heavy the Robot and Bomb, who hinder players' progress due to their slow or destructive nature, respectively. The story follows the group's efforts to save a mysterious island from Doctor Robotnik and Metal Sonic, who are using its magical Chaos Rings for their evil plans.|$|E

5|$|Agonistic {{behaviour}} typically {{consists of}} squabbles between individuals climbing over or passing each other. This occasionally involves biting. Males that are strangers may wrestle, chase, and bite each other. In extreme situations, a male {{may try to}} displace a smaller rival from a tree. This involves the larger aggressor climbing up and attempting to corner the victim, which tries either to rush past him <b>and</b> <b>climb</b> down or {{to move to the}} end of a branch. The aggressor attacks by grasping the target by the shoulders and repeatedly biting him. Once the weaker individual is driven away, the victor bellows and marks the tree. Pregnant and lactating females are particularly aggressive and attack individuals that come too close. In general, however, koalas tend to avoid energy-wasting aggressive behaviour.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} moth {{was thought to}} be from China or Bengal, but was later found to be endemic to Madagascar. It is found {{throughout}} the year {{in most parts of the}} island, with peak populations between March and August, and smallest numbers between October and December. Females lay about 80 eggs under the leaves of Omphalea spp. The caterpillars are whitish-yellow with black spots and red feet and are covered in club-ended black setae. Silk spun from the mouth helps the caterpillars hold on to smooth leaves <b>and</b> <b>climb</b> back to the plant when they fall. After completing four instars, the caterpillars spin an open network cocoon. The pupal stage lasts from 17 to 23 days.|$|E
5|$|At first, Raziel can jump, glide {{using his}} torn wings, move blocks, {{and pick up}} and throw objects and enemies. Initially unarmed, he fights using his claws, but can {{alternatively}} use weapons such as rocks, torches, spears and staffs, and the Soul Reaver. Raziel can freely shift to the spectral realm, but can return to the material realm only through special portals when at full health. Raziel automatically shifts to the spectral realm if he runs out of health. As the game progresses, Raziel gains the powers of his clan brothers after defeating them and becomes able to phase through gates in the spectral realm <b>and</b> <b>climb</b> walls in the material realm. Initially vulnerable to water, he overcomes this weakness and learns to swim.|$|E

5|$|Born into a {{prominent}} Modenese noble family, {{he served as}} a junior officer in the Sardinian Army during the War of the First Coalition (1794–96). After brief services in the Cisalpine Republic and Austrian armies in Italy, in 1806 he moved into Russian service <b>and</b> <b>climb</b> the ranks to the position of governor general of Livonia. In 1829 he returned in Piedmont and was appointed full general and Inspector general of Infantry and Cavalry on 1830, only to be dismissed a year later when King Carlo Felice died. In 1848 Paulucci was rumored as a possible Commander-in-Chief for the Sardinian Army, but he refused any involvements. He died peacefully in Nice the following year.|$|E
5|$|Developed {{in tandem}} with the single-player mode, the online {{multiplayer}} mode Grand Theft Auto Online was conceived as a separate experience to be played in a continually evolving world. Up to 30 players freely roam across the game world and enter lobbies to complete jobs (story-driven competitive and cooperative modes). The Content Creator toolset lets players create their own parameters for custom jobs, like racetracks and deathmatch weapon spawn points. Players may band together in organised player teams called crews to complete jobs together. Rockstar Games Social Club extends crews formed in Max Payne 3 multiplayer mode to those of Grand Theft Auto Online. Players may create their own crews and join up to five total. Crews win multiplayer matches to earn experience points <b>and</b> <b>climb</b> online leaderboards.|$|E
5|$|Dino Crisis {{features}} survival horror gameplay that is {{very similar}} to Capcom's early Resident Evil titles. Regina can walk, run, turn, backpedal, push <b>and</b> <b>climb</b> objects, and perform a 180-degree turn. A map is available which will show Regina's location, destination, save points, and locked doors. Save points are rooms which will prompt the player to save upon exiting them. Some doors are locked by a D.D.K. (digital disk key) device. To open these doors, the player will need both a code disc and input disc which can then be used to decipher a code and unlock the door. There are also force fields of red beams throughout the complex which can be activated to block access to intruders.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} a few smaller classes (such as Scots, Sweet Brier) <b>and</b> some <b>climbing</b> classes of old roses (including Ayrshire, Climbing China, Laevigata, Sempervirens, Boursault, <b>Climbing</b> Tea, <b>and</b> <b>Climbing</b> Bourbon).

5|$|Fishers {{have five}} toes on each foot, with unsheathed, {{retractable}} claws. Their feet are disproportionately large for their legs, {{making it easier}} for them to move on top of snow packs. In addition to the toes, there are four central pads on each foot. On the hind paws there are coarse hairs that grow between the pads and the toes, giving them added traction when walking on a variety of surfaces. Fishers have highly mobile ankle joints that can rotate their hind paws almost 180 degrees, allowing them to maneuver well in trees <b>and</b> <b>climb</b> down head-first. The fisher is one of relatively few mammalian species with the ability to descend trees head-first.|$|E
5|$|Ninja Gaiden III: The Ancient Ship of Doom is a side-scrolling {{platform}} game {{in which}} the player controls the player character Ryu Hayabusa as he investigates the events behind Irene Lew's death. In the game, Ryu can jump, hang, <b>and</b> <b>climb</b> up and down walls with the control pad; pressing the jump button while holding the control pad the direction {{away from the wall}} causes Ryu to spring off the wall. Ryu is also able to attack enemies with secondary weapons while on a wall by pressing the attack button. A new feature introduced in Ninja GaidenIII is the ability for Ryu to hang overhead from pipes or ivy; he can swing up on top or drop from them, and as with walls, he can only attack enemies while hanging with secondary weapons.|$|E
5|$|Redback spiderlings cohabit on the {{maternal}} web {{for several days}} to a week, during which time sibling cannibalism is often observed. They then leave by being carried on the wind. They follow light <b>and</b> <b>climb</b> {{to the top of}} nearby logs or rocks before extending their abdomens high in the air and producing a droplet of silk. The liquid silk is drawn out into a long gossamer thread that, when long enough, carries the spider away. This behaviour is known as ballooning or kiting. Eventually, the silken thread will adhere to an object where the young spider will establish its own web. They sometimes work cooperatively, climbing, releasing silk and being carried off in clusters. Juvenile spiders build webs, sometimes with other spiders.|$|E

5|$|The player {{character}} {{moves through}} six levels, each {{divided into two}} acts. The first act of each level ends with a miniboss fight with one of Dr. Robotnik's robots, while the second ends with a regular boss fight with Robotnik (or EggRobo in Knuckles' campaign). Sonic and Knuckles traverse levels differently: Sonic can jump slightly higher, is faster and can use the insta-shield ability which makes him invincible for a split-second, whereas Knuckles can glide, break obstacles <b>and</b> <b>climb</b> most walls. The levels also include cutscenes that differ based on the character selected, as Sonic and Knuckles are rivals {{for most of the}} game.|$|E
5|$|This led to Hanbury Brown's {{work on the}} Mark IVA, which {{differed}} from the Mk. IV primarily by having an additional display unit {{in front of the}} pilot. The radar operator had an additional control, the strobe, which could be adjusted to pick out returns at a particular range. Only those returns were sent to the pilot's display, resulting in much less clutter. Unlike the operator's display, the pilot's showed the target's location as a single dot in a bore-scope like fashion; if the dot was above and {{to the right of the}} centre of the display, the pilot had to turn to the right <b>and</b> <b>climb</b> to intercept. The result was what was known as a flying spot indicator, a single selected target showing a direct indication of the target's relative position.|$|E
5|$|Metroid Fusion is an action-adventure {{platform}} shooter {{in which}} the player controls Samus Aran. Like previous games in the series, Metroid Fusion {{is set in a}} large open-ended world with elevators that connect regions, which each in turn contains rooms separated by doors. Samus opens most doors by shooting at them, while some only open after she reaches a certain point. Metroid Fusion unfolds in a more linear manner than previous Metroid games due to its focus on storyline; for example, Navigation Rooms are introduced in Metroid Fusion, which tell the player where to go. The gameplay revolves around solving puzzles to uncover secrets, platform jumping, and shooting enemies while searching for power-ups that allow Samus to reach new areas. Injected with a Metroid vaccine in Metroid Fusion, Samus can absorb X Parasites that restore health, missiles, and bombs. Power-ups can be obtained either by downloading them in Data Rooms, or absorbing a Core-X, which appears after defeating each boss. Metroid Fusion includes gameplay mechanics new to the series such as the ability to grab ledges <b>and</b> <b>climb</b> ladders.|$|E
