We demonstrate that registration without constraints leads to arbitrary results depending on the regularization and in particular produces non-physical deformations. Having <b>additional</b> <b>constraints</b> based <b>on</b> the images introduces prior knowledge and contributes to reliability and uniqueness of the registration. In particular we consider recently proposed locally rigid transformations as an example. In contrast to existing approaches, we propose a constraint optimization framework and do not rely on penalty methods that do not guarantee feasible solutions. ...|$|R
