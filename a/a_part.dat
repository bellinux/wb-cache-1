40|$|Background: The Work Ability Index (WAI) {{identifies}} non-sicklisted {{workers at}} risk of future long-term sickness absence (LTSA). The WAI is a complicated instrument and inconvenient for use in large-scale surveys. We investigated whether shortened versions of the WAI identify non-sicklisted workers {{at risk of}} LTSA. Methods: Prospective study including two samples of non-sicklisted workers participating in occupational health checks between 2010 and 2012. A heterogeneous development sample (N = 2899) was used to estimate logistic regression coefficients for the complete WAI, a shortened WAI version without the list of diseases, and single-item Work Ability Score (WAS). These three instruments were calibrated for predictions of different (<b>a</b> <b>parts</b> per thousand yen 2, <b>a</b> <b>parts</b> per thousand yen 4 and <b>a</b> <b>parts</b> per thousand yen 6 weeks) LTSA durations in a validation sample of non-sicklisted workers (N = 3049) employed at a steel mill, differentiating between manual (N = 1710) and non-manual (N = 1339) workers. The discriminative ability was investigated by receiver operating characteristic analysis. Results: All three instruments under-predicted the LTSA risks in both manual and non-manual workers. The complete WAI discriminated between individuals at high and low risk of LTSA <b>a</b> <b>parts</b> per thousand yen 2, <b>a</b> <b>parts</b> per thousand yen 4 and <b>a</b> <b>parts</b> per thousand yen 6 weeks in manual and non-manual workers. Risk predictions and discrimination by the shortened WAI without the list of diseases were {{as good as the}} complete WAI. The WAS showed poorer discrimination in manual and non-manual workers. Conclusions: The WAI without the list of diseases is a good alternative to the complete WAI to identify non-sicklisted workers at risk of future LTSA durations <b>a</b> <b>parts</b> per thousand yen 2, <b>a</b> <b>parts</b> per thousand yen 4 and <b>a</b> <b>parts</b> per thousand yen 6 weeks...|$|R

40|$|We prospectively {{determined}} whether computer-aided detection (CAD) {{could improve}} the performance characteristics of computed tomography colonography (CTC) {{in a population}} of increased risk for colorectal cancer. Therefore, we included 170 consecutive patients that underwent both CTC and colonoscopy. All findings <b>a</b> <b>parts</b> per thousand yen 6 mm were evaluated at colonoscopy by segmental unblinding. We determined per-patient sensitivity and specificity for polyps <b>a</b> <b>parts</b> per thousand yen 6 mm and <b>a</b> <b>parts</b> per thousand yen 10 mm without and with computer-aided detection (CAD). The McNemar test was used for comparison the results without and with CAD. Unblinded colonoscopy detected 50 patients with lesions <b>a</b> <b>parts</b> per thousand yen 6 mm and 25 patients with lesions <b>a</b> <b>parts</b> per thousand yen 10 mm. Sensitivity of CTC without CAD for these size categories was 80 % (40 / 50, 95 % CI: 69 - 81 %) and 64 % (16 / 25, 95 % CI: 45 - 83 %), respectively. CTC with CAD detected one additional patient with <b>a</b> lesion <b>a</b> <b>parts</b> per thousand yen 6 mm and two with <b>a</b> lesion <b>a</b> <b>parts</b> per thousand yen 10 mm, resulting in a sensitivity of 82 % (41 / 50, 95 % CI: 71 - 93 %) (p = 0. 50) and 72 % (18 / 25, 95 % CI: 54 - 90 %) (p = 1. 0), respectively.

However, this trend changes when Ra is less than 10 (4), suggesting that Nu(m) attains its maximum value at the region close to the bottom surface center.
