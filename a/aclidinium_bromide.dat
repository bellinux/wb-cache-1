40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: To {{determine}} whether long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) provide superior therapeutic effects over long-acting β 2 agonists (LABAs) for preventing COPD exacerbations. Methods: This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials involving patients with stable, {{moderate to severe}} COPD according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease criteria, treated with a LAMA (i. e., tiotropium <b>bromide,</b> <b>aclidinium,</b> or glycopyrronium), followed for at least 12 weeks and compared with controls using a LABA in isolation or in combination with a corticosteroid. Results: A total of 2, 622 studies were analyzed for possible inclusion {{on the basis of}} their title and abstract; 9 studies (17, 120 participants) were included in the analysis. In comparison with LABAs, LAMAs led to a greater decrease in the exacerbation rate ratio (relative risk [RR] = 0. 88; 95 % CI: 0. 84 - 0. 93]; a lower proportion of patients who experienced at least one exacerbation (RR = 0. 90; 95 % CI: 0. 87 - 0. 94; p < 0. 00001); a lower risk of exacerbation-related hospitalizations (RR = 0. 78; 95 % CI: 0. 69 - 0. 87; p < 0. 0001); and a lower number of serious adverse events (RR = 0. 81; 95 % CI: 0. 67 - 0. 96; p = 0. 0002). The overall quality of evidence was moderate for all outcomes. Conclusions: The major findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis were that LAMAs significantly reduced the exacerbation rate (exacerbation episodes/year), as well as the number of exacerbation episodes, of hospitalizations, and of serious adverse events...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Although {{there are}} some {{challenges}} with current therapies, the growing evidence that tiotropium bromide {{is important in the}} maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has led to enthusiastic investigation in search of novel muscarinic antagonists which share some of the beneficial characteristics of tiotropium and perhaps improve upon less desirable ones. Areas covered: <b>Aclidinium</b> <b>bromide</b> is a new muscarinic antagonist that has been developed to relieve symptoms in patients with COPD. Preclinical data showed that it has an intriguing pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profile. <b>Aclidinium</b> <b>bromide</b> was initially assessed as a once-daily bronchodilator.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Cigarette smoking {{contributes}} to lung remodelling in {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). As {{part of this}} remodelling, peribronchiolar fibrosis is observed in the small airways of COPD patients and {{contributes to}} airway obstruction. Fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition is a key step in peribronchiolar fibrosis formation. This in vitro study examined the effect of cigarette smoke on bronchial fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition, and whether <b>aclidinium</b> <b>bromide</b> inhibits this process. Human bronchial fibroblasts were incubated with <b>aclidinium</b> <b>bromide</b> (10 - 9 – 10 - 7 M) and exposed to cigarette smoke extract. Collagen type I and a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) expression were measured by real-time PCR and Western blotting, as myofibroblast markers. Intracellular reactive oxygen species, cyclic AMP (cAMP), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1 / 2 and choline acetyltransferase were measured as intracellular signalling mediators. Cigarette smoke-induced collagen type I and a-SMA was mediated by the production of reactive oxygen species, the depletion of intracellular cAMP and the increase of ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation and choline acetyltransferase. These effects could be reversed by treatment with the antic-holinergic <b>aclidinium</b> <b>bromide,</b> by silencing the mRNA of muscarinic receptors M 1, M 2 or M 3, or by the depletion of extracellular acetylcholine by treatment with acetylcholinesterase.

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the potential synergistic interaction between <b>aclidinium</b> <b>bromide</b> and formoterol fumarate on the relaxation of human ASM. We evaluated the influence of <b>aclidinium</b> <b>bromide</b> and formoterol fumarate on the contractile response induced by acetylcholine or electrical field stimulation (EFS) on human isolated airways (segmental bronchi and bronchioles). We analyzed the potential synergistic interaction between the compounds when administered in combination by using Bliss independence (BI) theory. Both <b>aclidinium</b> <b>bromide</b> and formoterol fumarate completely relaxed segmental bronchi pre-contracted with acetylcholine (Emax: 97. 5 ± 2. 6 % and 96. 4 ± 1. 1 %; pEC 50 8. 5 ± 0. 1 and 8. 8 ± 0. 1; respectively).

40|$|Background: Inhaled {{corticosteroid}} (ICS) with long-acting beta- 2 agonists is a well-documented {{combination therapy}} for {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) {{based on its}} additive anti-inflammatory properties. By contrast, the recommendation of ICS in combination with long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) is not evidence-based. In this study, neutrophils obtained from COPD patients were used to compare the anti-inflammatory effects of <b>aclidinium</b> <b>bromide</b> (a long-acting muscarinic antagonist) with corticosteroids and their potential additive effect. Methods: Human sputum and blood neutrophils were isolated from healthy individuals (n = 37), patients with stable COPD (n = 52) and those with exacerbated COPD (n = 16). The cells were incubated with corticosteroid fluticasone propionate (0. 1 nM – 1 μ M), <b>aclidinium</b> <b>bromide</b> (0. 1 nM – 1 μ M) or a combination thereof and stimulated with 1 μ gof lipopolysaccharide/ml or 5 % cigarette smoke extract. Levels of the pro-inflammatory mediators interleukin- 8, matrix metalloproteinase- 9, CCL- 5, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin- 1 β were measured and the mechanisms of corticosteroid resistance evaluated {{at the end of the}} incubation. Results: The non-neuronal cholinergic system w as over-expressed in neutrophils fr om COPD patients, as evidenced by increases in the expression of muscarinic receptors (M 2, M 4 and M 5), choline acetyltransferase and vesicular acetylcholine transporter. <b>Aclidinium</b> <b>bromide</b> demonstrated anti-inflamm atory effects on neutrophils from COPD patients, reversing their resistance to corticosteroids. Additive effects of c ombined <b>aclidinium</b> <b>bromide</b> and fluticasone propionate in blocking M 2 receptor levels, inhibi ting phosphoinositide 3 -kinase- δ and enhancing the glucocorticoid response element transcription factor were demonstrated and were accompanied by an increase in the corticosteroid-induced expression of anti-inflammatory-related genes. Conclusions: LAMAs potentiate the anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids in neutrophils from COPD patients in vitro, thus providing a scientific rationale for their use in combination with corticosteroids in the treatment of COPD.

The Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for the clinical management of chronic COPD. Long-acting inhaled bronchodilators continue to be the mainstay of current management. <b>Aclidinium</b> <b>bromide</b> (Tudorza™ Pressair™) joins tiotropium as a long-acting inhaled antimuscarinic bronchodilator approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the maintenance treatment of COPD. Early studies demonstrated aclidinium’s significant bronchodilatory effects supporting once-daily dosing; however, two Phase III studies, Aclidinium Clinical Trial Assessing Efficacy and Safety in Moderate to Severe COPD Patients (ACCLAIM/COPD) I and ACCLAIM/COPD II, in which patients were randomized to receive aclidinium 200 µg daily, failed to achieve the minimal clinically important difference in improvement of trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1), suggesting the need for higher doses or more frequent dosing. Additional studies – Aclidinium to Treat Airway Obstruction in COPD Patients (ATTAIN) and Aclidinium in Chronic Obstructive Respiratory Disease (ACCORD) I – were undertaken to compare 200 and 400 µg twice-daily dosing. The mean improvements from baseline in trough FEV 1 in the 400 µg groups were + 129 mL over 24 weeks and + 124 mL over 12 weeks in ATTAIN and ACCORD I, respectively. Aclidinium also had beneficial effects on health-related quality of life and other endpoints, such as rescue medication use and rates of exacerbations. <b>Aclidinium</b> <b>bromide</b> inhalation powder is generally well tolerated in patients with COPD, with headache, cough, diarrhea, and rhinosinusitis among the most commonly reported adverse events. Cardiovascular side effects were rarely reported. Patient satisfaction studies found that patients using the aclidinium delivery device had fewer errors affecting drug delivery than those using the tiotropium device and, overall, the aclidinium device was preferred to the tiotropium device.

The first LAMA, tiotropium, has been widely used over the last decade as a once-daily maintenance therapy in stable COPD to improve patients’ health-related quality of life and {{to reduce the risk of}} exacerbations. Administered via the HandiHaler® device, it is safe and well tolerated.

The subject of this review is a third LAMA, <b>aclidinium</b> <b>bromide,</b> which was approved as a twice-daily maintenance bronchodilator treatment. In the pivotal Phase III clinical trials, patients receiving aclidinium achieved significantly greater improvements in lung function, reductions in breathlessness, and improvements in health status compared with placebo, for up to 24 weeks. In continuation studies, these improvements were sustained for up to 52 weeks. Pooled data showed exacerbation frequency was significantly reduced with aclidinium versus placebo. Preclinical and pharmacological studies demonstrating low systemic bioavailability and a low propensity to induce cardiac arrhythmias were translated into a favorable tolerability profile in the clinical trial program – the adverse event profile of aclidinium was similar to placebo, with a low incidence of anticholinergic and cardiac adverse events.

40|$|Background: As {{emphasized}} by international recommendations and largely confirmed by clinical experience, long-acting bronchodilators {{play a central}} role in the maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to their proven efficacy in reducing airflow obstruction and improving symptoms. Main body: There are some important aspects to define with regard to inhalation therapy for COPD, particularly those concerning the selection criteria and the optimal use of long-acting bronchodilators. First of all, it needs to be determined in which patients and clinical situations monotherapy with one bronchodilator, such as a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), should be considered adequate, and in which cases the use of combination therapies, such as the "double bronchodilation" with a LAMA and a long-acting β 2 -agonist (LABA), should be preferred. Another critical issue concerns the effect of the frequency of daily administration of inhaled agents on the control of symptoms during the 24 h. COPD symptoms are known to exhibit considerable circadian variability with worsening in the early morning, and a significant proportion of patients have disease-related sleep disorders which can adversely affect their quality of life. The worsening of symptoms in the early morning may be due, at least in part, to a reduction in airway caliber caused by an increased "cholinergic tone" at night. As such, the coverage of nighttime and early morning symptoms is a reasonable therapeutic goal, which can be achieved by many patients using LAMAs such as <b>aclidinium</b> <b>bromide</b> twice daily (BID). Therapeutic adherence is known to be a multifactorial phenomenon that is frequently affected by other aspects than dosing frequency, including the technical features and ease of use of the inhalers. To this end, it should be mentioned that certain new-generation inhalers such as Genuair® have been associated in clinical trials with higher patient preference. Conclusion: In this work, in addition to presenting an overview of the main evidence on the efficacy of COPD treatment with the LAMA <b>aclidinium</b> <b>bromide</b> BID, we suggest some selection criteria for the monotherapy with one long-acting bronchodilator or the combination therapy with LAMA and LABA in COPD patients, with particular reference to specific clinical scenarios...|$|E
40|$|Background: This randomized, double-blind, Phase IIIb study {{evaluated}} the 24 -hour bronchodilatory efficacy of <b>aclidinium</b> <b>bromide</b> versus placebo and tiotropium {{in patients with}} moderate-to-severe {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). Methods: Patients received aclidinium 400 μg twice daily (morning and evening), tiotropium 18 μg once daily (morning), or placebo for 6 weeks. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second area under the curve for the 24 -hour period post-morning dose (FEV 1 AUC 0 – 24) at week 6. Secondary and additional endpoints included FEV 1 AUC 12 – 24, COPD symptoms (EXAcerbations of chronic pulmonary disease Tool-Respiratory Symptoms [E-RS] total score and additional symptoms questionnaire), and safety. Results: Overall, 414 patients were randomized and treated (FEV 1 1. 63 L [55. 8 % predicted]). Compared with placebo, FEV 1 AUC 0 – 24 and FEV 1 AUC 12 – 24 were significantly increased from baseline with aclidinium (Δ = 150 mL and 160 mL, respectively; p < 0. 0001) and tiotropium (Δ = 140 m...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Importance of the field. The {{prevention}} and relief of symptoms by regular use of bronchodilators {{is central to}} the pharmacological management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Areas covered in this review: The aim {{of this article is to}} review the effects of inhaled muscarinic antagonists in the treatment of stable COPD. What the reader will gain: An update of the clinical studies performed with the long-acting inhaled muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) tiotropium bromide in patients with COPD is given. In recent years, combinations of a LAMA and a long-acting inhaled beta 2 -agonist (LABA), and 'triple therapy' consisting of a LAMA, a LABA, and an inhaled steroid are being developed. issues of safety of inhaled anticholinergics in COPD are discussed and a short overview of new LAMAs being developed for COPD is given. Take home messages. The importance of anticholinergic drug treatment in COPD was largely advanced by the development of the first LAMA, tiotropium bromide. The vast experience obtained with tiotropium bromide has paved the way for new LAMAs such as <b>aclidinium</b> <b>bromide</b> and glycopyrrolate (NVA- 237) ...|$|E

Our preclinical data indicated that combining <b>aclidinium</b> <b>bromide</b> (ACLI) and formoterol fumarate (FORM) provides synergistic benefit on smooth muscle relaxation of {{both large and small}} human airways. Data from more than 2, 000 patients in eleven clinical trials documented that ACLI/FORM, a twice-daily fixed-dose combination, produces a greater degree of bronchodilation than ACLI or FORM monotherapy alone and is safe and well tolerated. Two large key trials have shown that there is a benefit in using ACLI/FORM when the clinical target is the variability of symptoms and mainly nighttime and/or early morning symptoms. ACLI/FORM is the only long acting muscarinic antagonist/long acting β 2 -agonist fixed-dose combination that has been studied for this therapeutic indication.

40|$|The {{pathophysiology}} {{of chronic}} obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) includes persistent airflow limitation, altered gas exchange, and enhanced chronic inflammatory response. According to disease severity in individual patients, exacerbations and comorbidities frequently occur. The overall nocturnal and daily symptoms {{have a strong}} impact on patient quality of life and clinical outcomes. Bronchodilators, by targeting two important aspects of COPD pathophysiology, ie, bronchoconstriction and lung hyperinflation, are the mainstay of therapy for COPD. <b>Aclidinium</b> <b>bromide</b> in particular is an anticholinergic molecule, approved for maintenance bronchodilator treatment of stable COPD, that combines high antimuscarinic activity with strong kinetic selectivity for the M 3 receptor subtype. Moreover, the elevated plasma clearance of aclidinium has been related to low systemic bioavailability and low incidence of anticholinergic adverse events, whereas the reduced residence time at M 2 receptors provides good cardiovascular safety. Altogether, these characteristics result in a high safety and tolerability profile. This review aims to reappraise the contribution of symptoms and of the level of quality of life determinants on COPD severity and to evaluate how therapeutic strategies with aclidinium may positively impact on these specific determinants of disease severity...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} two doses of <b>aclidinium</b> <b>bromide</b> were evaluated in patients with moderate to severe COPD. In this 24 -week, double-blind trial, patients were randomised to twice-daily aclidinium (200 µg or 400 µg) or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was change in trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) at Week 24. Other endpoints included peak FEV 1, health status (St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire; SGRQ) and dyspnoea (Transitional Dyspnoea Index; TDI). Overall, 828 patients were randomised. At Week 24, significant improvements from baseline were observed with aclidinium 200 µg and 400 µg versus placebo for trough FEV 1 (99 and 128 mL; both p< 0. 0001) and peak FEV 1 (185 and 209 mL; both p< 0. 0001). Peak FEV 1 improvements on Day 1 were comparable with Week 24. Aclidinium 200 µg and 400 µg produced significant improvements over placebo in baseline-adjusted mean SGRQ total score (- 3. 8 and- 4. 6 units; p< 0. 001 and < 0. 0001) and TDI focal score (0. 6 and 1. 0 units; p< 0. 05 and < 0. 001) at Week 24. With both aclidinium doses, the incidence of anticholinergic adverse events was low and simila...|$|E
40|$|This article {{reviews the}} Genuair® inhaler, a novel, multidose, breath-actuated dry powder inhaler. The inhaler design {{includes}} visual and acoustic feedback to reassure patients {{that they have}} taken their medication correctly, a dose indicator and a lock-out mechanism to prevent {{the use of an}} empty inhaler. The inhaler has medium airflow resistance and uses an optimised dispersion system to ensure effective deagglomeration of the inhalation powder. In vitro studies have demonstrated that the inhaler delivers a reproducible aerodynamic aerosol quality and is reliable under various thermal and mechanical stress conditions. Further studies in vitro have demonstrated that the total emitted dose and fine particle dose are both consistent over a range of inhalation flows from 45 to 95 l/min, as well as being independent of inhalation volume (2 l vs. 4 l) and storage conditions. In healthy subjects, delivery of <b>aclidinium</b> <b>bromide</b> 200 μg via the inhaler achieved high lung deposition (approximately 30 % of the metered dose). A further study has shown that patients with moderate or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease can generate sufficient inspiratory airflow through the inhaler to reliably inhale the full dose and reset the inhaler. The inhaler has been used to deliver aclidinium in many clinical trials and the available data indicate that it has high acceptability amongst patients...|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe Genuair® inhaler {{is a new}} multidose {{dry powder}} inhaler for the {{delivery}} of <b>aclidinium</b> <b>bromide</b> – a novel, long-acting, muscarinic antagonist in development {{for the treatment of}} chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The primary aim {{of this study was to}} assess the inspiratory flow characteristics through Genuair® in patients with moderate or severe COPD. Using a three-period cross-over design, 48 patients were randomised to inhale placebo powder through Genuair®, HandiHaler® A (slow, deep inhalation as per manufacturer's instructions) or HandiHaler® B (fast, forceful inhalation). Three measurements of peak inspiratory flow (PIF), 10 min apart, were recorded for each method of administration. The highest and average PIFs for the three attempts (mean±standard deviation) generated through the Genuair® inhaler were 97. 7 ± 15. 7 and 92. 0 ± 15. 4 L/min, respectively. Furthermore, 97 % of inhalations with the Genuair® inhaler were successful (activation of trigger threshold mechanism) and optimal (PIF≥ 45 L/min). The highest and average PIFs generated through HandiHaler® A and B were significantly lower than with the Genuair® inhaler. In conclusion, patients with moderate or severe COPD were able to generate sufficient inspiratory airflow through the Genuair® inhaler to reliably inhale the full dose and reset the inhaler...|$|E

Methods: A previously published individual-level Markov model was adapted for the perspective of the UK health care system, in line with recommendations from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. Individuals progressed through the model based on their forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) value at baseline and the post-improvement FEV 1 value. Changes in FEV 1 were taken from a mixed treatment comparison. Costs were obtained from a published cost-utility analysis of tiotropium in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the UK. Uncertainty was assessed by deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Results: Duaklir® Genuair® (<b>aclidinium</b> <b>bromide</b> + formoterol fumarate FDC) and the free-dose combination of tiotropium + salmeterol were dominated by tiotropium + olodaterol FDC. The quality-adjusted life years and costs were identical for Ultibro® Breezhaler® (indacaterol + glycopyrronium FDC) and Anoro™ Ellipta® (umeclidinium + vilanterol FDC) compared with tiotropium + olodaterol FDC, resulting in identical incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Conclusion: This analysis shows tiotropium + olodaterol FDC to be a cost-effective option for the maintenance treatment of adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the UK.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} the long-acting muscarinic antagonist <b>aclidinium</b> <b>bromide</b> on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations by pooling data from five randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group Phase III studies of 3 – 6 months’ duration. Data were pooled from the aclidinium 400 μg twice-daily (BID) and placebo arms (N = 2, 521) and stratified by Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) group (A, B, C and D). Results showed that fewer patients experienced ≥ 1 exacerbation with aclidinium (any severity: 12. 5 %; moderate to severe: 10. 9 %) compared with placebo (any severity: 15. 7 %; moderate to severe: 13. 3 %) and the odds of experiencing ≥ 1 exacerbation of any severity were reduced in patients receiving aclidinium (odds ratio = 0. 78, p = 0. 039). Furthermore, aclidinium reduced the rate of exacerbations compared with placebo (any severity: rate ratio = 0. 79, p = 0. 026; moderate to severe: 0. 80, p = 0. 044). The time to first exacerbation of any severity was delayed with aclidinium compared with placebo (hazard ratio = 0. 79, p = 0. 026) and there was a numerical delay in time to first moderate-to-severe exacerbation. Finally, the effects of aclidinium on exacerbations versus placebo were greater in patients in GOLD Groups B and D; however, it is of note that only 10. 7 % of patients were classified in Group A or C. In summary, the results indicate that aclidinium 400 μg BID reduces the frequency of COPD exacerbations compared with placebo and that these effects are greater in symptomatic patients...|$|E
40|$|Bronchodilators, {{generally}} administered via metered dose or {{dry powder}} inhalers, are the mainstays of pharmacological treatment of stable COPD. Inhaled long-acting beta-agonists (LABA) and anticholinergics are the bronchodilators primarily {{used in the}} chronic treatment of COPD. Anticholinergics act as muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists and are frequently preferred over betaagonists for their minimal cardiac stimulatory effects and greater efficacy in most studies. Their therapeutic efficacy {{is based on the}} fact that vagally mediated bronchoconstriction is the major reversible component of airflow obstruction in patients with COPD. However, bronchodilators are effective only on the reversible component of airflow obstruction, which by definition is limited, as COPD is characterized by a fixed or poorly reversible airflow obstruction. Inhaled anticholinergic antimuscarinic drugs approved for the treatment of COPD include ipratropium bromide, oxitropium bromide and tiotropium bromide. Ipratropium bromide, the prototype of anticholinergic bronchodilators, is a short-acting agent. Oxitropium bromide is administered twice a day. Tiotropium bromide, the only long-acting antimuscarinic agent (LAMA) currently approved, is administered once a day. Newer LAMAs including <b>aclidinium</b> <b>bromide</b> and glycopyrrolate bromide are currently in phase III development for treatment of COPD. Some new LAMAs, including glycocpyrrolate, are suitable for once daily administration and, unlike tiotropium, have a rapid onset of action. New LAMAs and their combination with ultra-LABA and, possibly, inhaled corticosteroids, seem to open new perspectives in the management of COPD. Dualpharmacology muscarinic antagonist-beta 2 agonist (MABA) molecules present a novel approach to the treatment of COPD by combining muscarinic antagonism and beta 2 agonism in a single molecule...|$|E
