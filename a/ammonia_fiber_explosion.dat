40|$|Bioethanol {{is today}} most {{commonly}} produced from corn grain and sugar cane. It {{is expected that}} there will be limits to the supply of these raw materials in the near future. Therefore, lignocellulosic biomass, namely agricultural and forest waste, is seen as an attractive feedstock for future supplies of ethanol. Lignocellulosic biomass consists of lignin, hemicellulose and cellulose. Indeed, complexicity of the lignocellulosic biomass structure causes a pretreatment to be applied prior to cellulose and hemicellulose hydrolysis into fermentable sugars. Pretreatment technologies can be physical (mechanical comminution, pyrolysis), physico-chemical (steam explosion, <b>ammonia</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>explosion,</b> CO 2 explosion), chemical (ozonolysis, acid hydrolysis, alkaline hydrolysis, oxidative delignification, organosolvent process) and biological ones...|$|E

The structural changes of lignocellulose result in enhanced enzymatic hydrolysis either to produce fermentable sugars for ethanol production or to achieve increased biogas yields in anaerobic digestion processes.

40|$|Abstract: Lignocelluloses {{are often}} a major or {{sometimes}} the sole components of different waste streams from various industries, forestry, agriculture and municipalities. Hydrolysis of these materials {{is the first step}} for either digestion to biogas (methane) or fermentation to ethanol. However, enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocelluloses with no pretreatment is usually not so effective because of high stability of the materials to enzymatic or bacterial attacks. The present work is dedicated to reviewing the methods that have been studied for pretreatment of lignocellulosic wastes for conversion to ethanol or biogas. Effective parameters in pretreatment of lignocelluloses, such as crystallinity, accessible surface area, and protection by lignin and hemicellulose are described first. Then, several pretreatment methods are discussed and their effects on improvement in ethanol and/or biogas production are described. They include milling, irradiation, microwave, steam explosion, <b>ammonia</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>explosion</b> (AFEX), supercritical CO 2 and its explosion, alkaline hydrolysis, liquid hot-water pretreatment, organosolv processes, wet oxidation, ozonolysis, dilute- and concentrated-acid hydrolyses, and biological pretreatments...|$|E

40|$|The optimal {{flowsheet}} for {{the production}} of bioethanol from switchgrass via hydrolysis is proposed in this work. A superstructure embedding a number of alternatives is proposed. Two technologies are considered for switchgrass pretreatment, dilute acid and <b>ammonia</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>explosion</b> so that the structure of the grass is broken down. Next, enzymatic hydrolysis follows any of the pretreatments to obtain fermentable sugars, mainly xylose and glucose. Ethanol is obtained by fermentation of the sugars. To obtain fuel quality, ethanol and water must be removed from the water–ethanol mixture. A number of dehydration technologies is considered including rectification, adsorption in corn grits, molecular sieves, and pervaporation. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP). The superstructure is optimized by decomposing the MINLP for each of the pretreatments. Then, multieffect columns and heat integration are used to reduce the energy consumption and cooling needs. Finally, an economic evaluation is performed. The optimal flowsheet consists of using dilute acid hydrolysis followed by molecular sieves as dehydration technology, which requires less energy and cooling and yielding a promising production price of 0. 8 $/gal...|$|E

40|$|Energy and {{environmental}} issues are among the major concerns facing the global community today. Transportation fuel represents {{a large proportion of}} energy consumption, not only in the US, but also world-wide. As fossil fuel is being depleted, new substitutes are needed to provide energy. Ethanol, which has been produced mainly from the fermentation of corn starch in the US, has been {{regarded as one of the}} main liquid transportation fuels that can take the place of fossil fuel. However, limitations in the supply of starch are creating a need for different substrates. Forest biomass is believed to be one of the most abundant sources of sugars, although much research has been reported on herbaceous grass, agricultural residue, and municipal waste. The use of biomass sugars entails pretreatment to disrupt the lignin-carbohydrate complex and expose carbohydrates to enzymes. This paper reviews pretreatment technologies from the perspective of their potential use with wood, bark, and forest residues.

50|$|To date, the {{available}} pretreatment techniques include acid hydrolysis, steam <b>explosion,</b> <b>ammonia</b> <b>fiber</b> expansion, organosolv, sulfite pretreatment, AVAP® (SO2-ethanol-water) fractionation, alkaline wet oxidation and ozone pretreatment.

40|$|A {{critical}} parameter affecting the economic feasibility of lignocellulosic bioconversion is {{the production of}} inexpensive and highly active cellulase enzymes in bulk quantity. A promising approach to reduce enzyme costs is to genetically transform plants with the genes of these enzymes, thereby producing the desired cellulases in the plants themselves. Extraction and recovery of active proteins or release of active cellulase from the plants during bioconversion could have a significant positive impact on overall lignocellulose conversion economics. The effects of <b>ammonia</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>explosion</b> (AFEX) pretreatment variables (treatment temperature, moisture content, and ammonia loading) on the activity of plant-produced heterologous cellulase enzyme were individually investigated via heat treatment or ammonia treatment. Finally, we studied the effects of all these variables in concert through the AFEX process. The plant materials included transgenic tobacco plants expressing E 1 (endoglucanase from Acidothermus cellulolyticus). The E 1 activity was measured in untreated and AFEX-treated tobacco leaves to investigate {{the effects of the}} treatment on the activity of this enzyme. The maximum observed activity retention in AFEX-treated transgenic tobacco samples compared with untreated samples was approx 35 % (at 60 °C, 0. 5 : 1 ammonia loading, and 40 % moisture).

30|$|Lignocellulose {{consists}} of three major polymerized components of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, which are joined together with complex covalent bond, and difficult for microbial digestion (Sun and Cheng 2002). Owing to the recalcitrant structural characteristics of plant cell wall, pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis are the crucial steps to release mono-sugars from biomass for fermentation. The purpose of the pretreatment is {{to break down the}} lignin structure, disrupt the crystalline of cellulose, and increase the porosity of lignocellulose for enhancing enzymes accessibility to the cellulose during hydrolysis process. Various pretreatment approaches have been developed and examined. Generally, they can classified into four categories: physical methods including mechanical comminution, extrusion, and irradiation; chemical methods including acid pretreatment (dilute acid or concentrated acid), alkaline pretreatment, oxidation, organosolv, and ionic liquids (ILs) pretreatment; physico-chemical methods including steaming or steam explosion (STEX), <b>ammonia</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>explosion</b> (AFEX), liquid hot water (LHW), and CO 2 explosion; and biological methods, which use microorganisms or enzymes to degrade lignocellulosic materials. Different pretreatment methods with regard to their features, advantages, and disadvantages as well as their impact on lignocellulosic materials have been discussed in detail in other reviews (Baral et al. 2014; Capolupo and Faraco 2016; Silveira et al. 2015; Sun et al. 2016). During the pretreatment process, a number of degradation products of lignin and sugar are generated, which could have detrimental effects on subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis and microbial cell fermentation (Jönsson et al. 2013).|$|E

30|$|Pretreatment methods optimal {{for ethanol}} {{production}} vary with plant species {{due to their}} diversity in chemical composition and cell wall structure. The most widely investigated pretreatment techniques include dilute acid [18 – 20], hot water [21, 22], <b>ammonia</b> <b>fiber</b> expansion [23, 24], and lime [25]. Acid-based and hot water pretreatments affect the solubilization of hemicelluloses rather than lignin, while alkaline pretreatments are mainly effective in extracting of lignin [4, 5, 20, 22].

40|$|Abstract: Cellulase and {{bovine serum}} albumin (BSA) {{were added to}} Avicel {{cellulose}} and solids containing 56 % cellulose and 28 % lignin from dilute sulfuric acid pretreatment of corn stover. Little BSA was adsorbed on Avicel cellulose, while pretreated corn stover solids adsorbed considerable amounts of this protein. On the other hand, cellulase was highly adsorbed on both substrates. Adding a 1 % concentration of BSA to dilute acid pretreated corn stover prior to enzyme addition at 15 FPU/g cellulose enhanced filter paper activity in solution by about a factor of 2 and beta-glucosidase activity in solution by about a factor of 14. Overall, these results suggested that BSA treatment reduced adsorption of cellulase andparticularly beta-glucosidaseon lignin. Of particular note, BSA treatment of pretreated corn stover solids prior to enzymatic hydrolysis increased 72 h glucose yields from about 82 % to about 92 % at a cellulase loading of 15 FPU/g cellulose or achieved about the same yield at a loading of 7. 5 FPU/g cellulose.

40|$|Life cycle {{environmental}} performance of lignocellulosic ethanol produced through different production pathways and having different co-products {{has rarely been}} reported in the literature, with most studies focusing on a single pre-treatment and single co-product (electricity). The aim {{of this paper is to}} understand the life cycle energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions implications of alternative pre-treatment technologies (dilute acid hydrolysis, <b>ammonia</b> <b>fiber</b> expansion and autohydrolysis) and co-products (electricity, pellet, protein and xylitol) through developing a consistent life cycle framework for ethanol production from corn stover. Results show that the choices of pre-treatment technology and co-product(s) can impact ethanol yield, life cycle energy use and GHG emissions. Dilute acid pathways generally exhibit higher ethanol yields (20 to 25 %) and lower net total energy use (15 to 25 %) than the autohydrolysis and <b>ammonia</b> <b>fiber</b> expansion pathways. Similar GHG emissions are found for the pre-treatment technologies when producing the same co-product. Xylitol co-production diverts xylose from ethanol production and results in the lowest ethanol yield (200 litres per dry t of stover). Compared to producing only electricity as a co-product, the co-production of pellets and xylitol decreases life cycle GHG emissions associated with the ethanol, while protein production increases emissions. The life cycle GHG emissions of blended ethanol fuel (85 % denatured ethanol by volume) range from - 38. 5 to 37. 2 g CO 2 eq/MJ of fuel produced, reducing emissions by 61 % to 141 % relative to gasoline.

30|$|Methods {{that use}} liquid ammonia for the {{pretreatment}} of lignocellulosic biomass are <b>Ammonia</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>explosion</b> (AFEX), Ammonia recycle percolation (ARP) and soaking aqueous ammonia (SAA). AFEX is conducted {{at ambient temperature}} while ARP is conducted at high temperatures (Agbor et al. 2011) SAA {{is a form of}} AFEX which treats biomass through aqueous ammonia in a batch reactor at 30 – 60  °C which decreases the liquid through-put during process of pretreatment (Kim and Lee 2005 a). In AFEX, lignocellulosic biomass is heated with liquid ammonia (in 1 : 1 ratio) in a closed vessel at temperature 60 – 90  °C and pressure above 3  MPa for 30 – 60  min. After holding the desired temperature in vessel for 5  min, valve is opened which explosively releases the pressure leading to evaporation of ammonia and drop in temperature of the system (Alizadeh et al. 2005). It is similar to steam explosion but ammonia is used instead of water (Rabemanolontsoa and Saka 2016). Lignocellulosic biomass when treated with ammonia at high pressure and given temperature causes swelling and phase change in cellulose crystallinity of biomass leading to increase in the reactivity of leftover carbohydrates after pretreatment. The lignin structure gets modified which increases the water holding capacity and digestibility. Unlike other pretreatment methods, AFEX treatment does not produce inhibitors, which is highly desirable for downstream processing. Besides, the overall cost of the pretreatment process is significantly low due to the absence of additional steps like water washing, detoxification, recovery, and reuse of large quantities of water. More than 90 % of celluloses and hemicelluloses could be converted to fermentable sugars if pretreated with AFEX under optimized conditions of ammonia loading, temperature, pressure, moisture content and pretreatment time (Uppugundla et al. 2014). Moreover, the ammonia could be recovered and recycled to decrease the overall cost of the pretreatment process.|$|E

In response to concerns over availability and cost of fishmeal for aquaculture feeds, a study was conducted to evaluate the suitability of a protein extract from coastal Bermuda grass for channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus).

Amino acid analysis of the extracted protein indicated a generally balanced profile that was first limiting in methionine. A laboratory feeding trial was conducted in which four isonitrogenous and isocaloric diets containing incremental levels of the extract were evaluated. The control diet contained 10 % menhaden fishmeal and experimental diets were formulated so that the extract replaced 33, 66 and 100 % of the fishmeal on an equal-protein basis. Each diet was fed to triplicate groups of channel catfish fingerlings initially weighing approximately 10 g/fish for 9 weeks. Apparent protein and organic matter digestibility of the extract also was determined utilizing chromic oxide as an inert marker. Results of the feeding trial indicated that substitution of the extract at all levels did not significantly (P> 0. 05) affect weight gain, feed efficiency, protein efficiency ratio, net protein utilization, intraperitoneal fat or hepatosomatic index of channel catfish.

The developed optimization model is also designed to incorporate various biomass feedstocks as well as realistic maximum equipment sizing thereby ensuring pragmatism of the work. For this study, the criterion for optimization is minimum ethanol price. The secondary and more interesting aim of this work was to develop a systematic method for evaluating the economics of biomass storage due to seasonal availabilities. In essence, a mathematical model was developed to link seasonal availabilities with plant capacity with subsequent integration into the original model developed. Similarly, the criterion for optimization is minimum ethanol price. The results of this work reveal that the optimal bioethanol production plant capacity is ~ 2800 MT biomass/day utilizing <b>Ammonia</b> <b>Fiber</b> <b>Explosion</b> pretreatment technology and corn stover as the preferred biomass feedstock.

30|$|One of {{the most}} {{commonly}} employed pretreatment methods is dilute acid pretreatment (sulfuric, hydrochloric, phosphoric, nitric or mixed acids in varying concentration) with or without high-pressure steam explosion. During this pretreatment, hemicellulose is readily hydrolyzed, while cellulose is minimally affected (Hendriks and Zeeman 2009; Alvira et al. 2010; Mood et al. 2013). Apart from acids, alkali (such as NaOH, KOH, Ca(OH) 2) is also used for pretreatment which acts by the saponification of intermolecular ester bonds cross-linking xylan hemicelluloses and other components (Mood et al. 2013; Singh et al. 2014).

The addition of supplemental cellobiase to the enzyme complex greatly increased the initial rate and ultimate extent of biomass hydrolysis by converting the strong inhibitor, cellobiose, to glucose. A low substrate concentration (10 g/L) was employed to prevent end-product inhibition by cellobiose and glucose. The rate and extent of biomass hydrolysis significantly depend on enzyme loading and structural features resulting from pretreatment, thus the hydrolysis and pretreatment processes are intimately coupled because of structural features. Model lignocelluloses with various structural features were hydrolyzed {{with a variety of}} cellulase loadings for 1, 6, and 72 h. Glucan, xylan, and total sugar conversions at 1, 6, and 72 h were linearly proportional to the logarithm of cellulase loadings from approximately 10 % to 90 % conversion, indicating that the simplified HCH- 1 model is valid for predicting lignocellulose digestibility. Carbohydrate conversions at a given time versus the natural logarithm of cellulase loadings were plotted to obtain the slopes and intercepts which were correlated to structural features (lignin content, acetyl content, cellulose crystallinity, and carbohydrate content) by both parametric and nonparametric regression models. The predictive ability of the models was evaluated by a variety of biomass (corn stover, bagasse, and rice straw) treated with lime, dilute acid, <b>ammonia</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>explosion</b> (AFEX), and aqueous ammonia. The measured slopes, intercepts, and carbohydrate conversions at 1, 6, and 72 h were compared to the values predicted by the parametric and nonparametric models. The smaller mean square error (MSE) in the parametric models indicates more satisfactorily predictive ability than the nonparametric models. The agreement between the measured and predicted values shows that lignin content, acetyl content, and cellulose crystallinity are key factors that determine biomass digestibility, and that biomass digestibility can be predicted over a wide range of cellulase loadings using the simplified HCH- 1 model...|$|E

Enzymatic hydrolysis at high solids loading was identified as the primary bottleneck affecting overall ethanol yield and titer. Degradation compounds in AFEX-pretreated biomass were shown to increase metabolic yield and specific ethanol production while decreasing the cell biomass generation. Nutrients inherently present in CS and those resulting from biomass processing are sufficient to support microbial growth during fermentation. This platform offers the potential to improve the economics of cellulosic ethanol production by reducing {{the costs associated with}} raw materials, process water, and capital equipment...|$|R
40|$|Research {{indicates}} that large biorefineries {{capable of handling}} 5000 - 10000 MT of biomass per day are necessary to achieve process economies. However, such large biorefineries also entail increased costs of biomass transportation and storage, high transaction costs of contracting {{with a large number}} of farmers for biomass supply, potential market power issues, and local environmental impacts. We propose a network of regional biomass preprocessing centers (RBPC) that form an extended biomass supply chain feeding into a biorefinery, as a way to address these issues. The RBPC, in its mature form, is conceptualized as a flexible processing facility capable of pre-treating and converting biomass into appropriate feedstocks for a variety of final products such as fuels, chemicals, electricity, and animal feeds. We evaluate the technical and financial feasibility of a simple RBPC that uses <b>ammonia</b> <b>fiber</b> expansion pretreatment process and produces animal feed along with biorefinery feedstock. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Pretreatment {{chemistry}} is of central importance {{due to its}} impacts on cellulosic biomass processing and biofuels conversion. <b>Ammonia</b> <b>fiber</b> expansion (AFEX) and dilute acid are two promising pretreatments using alkaline and acidic pH that have distinctive differences in pretreatment chemistries. Results Comparative evaluation on these two pretreatments reveal that (i) AFEX-pretreated corn stover is significantly more fermentable with respect to cell growth and sugar consumption, (ii) both pretreatments can achieve more than 80 % of total sugar yield in the enzymatic hydrolysis of washed pretreated solids, and (iii) while AFEX completely preserves plant carbohydrates, dilute acid pretreatment at 5 % solids loading degrades 13 % of xylose to byproducts. Conclusion The selection of pretreatment will determine the biomass-processing configuration, requirements for hydrolysate conditioning (if any) and fermentation strategy. Through dilute acid pretreatment, the need for hemicellulase in biomass processing is negligible. AFEX-centered cellulosic technology can alleviate fermentation costs through reducing inoculum size and practically eliminating nutrient costs during bioconversion. However, AFEX requires supplemental xylanases as well as cellulase activity. As for long-term sustainability, AFEX has greater potential to diversify products from a cellulosic biorefinery due to lower levels of inhibitor generation and lignin loss. </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{step-change}} {{flow rate}} liquid hot water (SCFLHW) process was developed {{with the objective}} of improving the total sugars recovery including xylose and glucose from sweet sorghum bagasse (SSB). Total xylose yield increased from 60 % for batch system (4. 25 % w/v, 18 Â min, 184 Â Â°C) to about 80 % at an initial flow rate of 20 Â ml/min for 8 Â min, followed by a rate of 10 Â ml/min for 10 Â min. It was hypothesized that the flowing water could enhance the mass transfer and improves the sugars recovery. Although little lignin was removed, the 72 Â h enzymatic digestibility of treated sample was enhanced by the increase of flow rate. The lignin droplet redeposited on the surface of residual solids might {{play a crucial role in}} determining the enzymatic digestibility. The total recovery of sugars from SSB, after the pretreatment (first with the flow rate of 20 Â ml/min for 8 Â min, then 10 Â ml/min for 10 Â min) and 72 Â h enzymatic digestion, reached 83. 7 %, which is superior to the recovery using the SO 2 -steam pretreatment or <b>ammonia</b> <b>fiber</b> expansion.

40|$|Abstract Background Hemicellulose {{is often}} {{credited}} with {{being one of}} the important physical barriers to enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose, and acts by blocking enzyme access to the cellulose surface. In addition, our recent research has suggested that hemicelluloses, particularly in the form of xylan and its oligomers, can more strongly inhibit cellulase activity than do glucose and cellobiose. Removal of hemicelluloses or elimination of their negative effects can therefore become especially pivotal to achieving higher cellulose conversion with lower enzyme doses. Results In this study, cellulase was supplemented with xylanase and &# 946;-xylosidase to boost conversion of both cellulose and hemicellulose in pretreated biomass through conversion of xylan and xylo-oligomers to the less inhibitory xylose. Although addition of xylanase and &# 946;-xylosidase did not necessarily enhance Avicel hydrolysis, glucan conversions increased by 27 % and 8 % for corn stover pretreated with <b>ammonia</b> <b>fiber</b> expansion (AFEX) and dilute acid, respectively. In addition, adding hemicellulase several hours before adding cellulase was more beneficial than later addition, possibly {{as a result of a}} higher adsorption affinity of cellulase and xylanase to xylan than glucan. Conclusions This key finding elucidates a possible mechanism for cellulase inhibition by xylan and xylo-oligomers and emphasizes the need to optimize the enzyme formulation for each pretreated substrate. More research is needed to identify advanced enzyme systems designed to hydrolyze different substrates with maximum overall enzyme efficacy...|$|R
