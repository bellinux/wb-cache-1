5|$|Alveolar osteitis is a {{complication}} of tooth extraction (especially lower wisdom teeth) {{in which the}} blood clot is not formed or is lost, leaving the socket where the tooth used to be empty, and bare bone is exposed to the mouth. The pain is moderate to severe, and dull, <b>aching,</b> and throbbing in character. The pain is localized to the socket, and may radiate. It normally starts two to {{four days after the}} extraction, and may last 10–40 days. Healing is delayed, and it is treated with local anesthetic dressings, which are typically required for five to seven days. There is some evidence that chlorhexidine mouthwash used prior to extractions prevents alveolar osteitis.|$|E
5|$|Bites {{in which}} {{envenomation}} does occur are usually painless {{and may not}} even be noticed when contact is made. Teeth may remain in the wound. Usually, little or no swelling occurs, and rarely are any nearby lymph nodes affected. The most important symptoms are rhabdomyolysis (rapid breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue) and paralysis. Early symptoms include headache, a thick-feeling tongue, thirst, sweating, and vomiting. Symptoms that can occur 30minutes to several hours after the bite include generalized <b>aching,</b> stiffness, and tenderness of muscles all over the body. Passive stretching of the muscles is also painful, and trismus, which is similar to tetanus, is common. This is followed later on by symptoms typical of other elapid envenomations: a progressive flaccid paralysis, starting with ptosis and paralysis of voluntary muscles. Paralysis of muscles involved in swallowing and respiration can be fatal.|$|E

The {{inhibition of}} <b>AChE</b> is generally lethal and mice without <b>AChE</b> in all tissues (<b>AChE</b> KO) have severe impairments. In the brain, <b>AChE</b> is {{anchored in the}} plasma membrane by proline-rich membrane anchor (PRiMA), while in the muscles, <b>AChE</b> is anchored by collagen Q (ColQ) in the basal lamina. We report here that the PRiMA KO mice, in which <b>AChE</b> is essentially eliminated in the brain, show very little changes in behavior despite an excess of ACh {{in the brain and}} adaptation of ACh receptors comparable to those seen in <b>AChE</b> KO mice. Moreover, when <b>AChE</b> cannot interact with ColQ and PRiMA, the phenotype resembles that of <b>AChE</b> KO mice, but the biochemical changes in the brain are similar to those in PRiMA KO mice.

40|$|The enzyme {{acetylcholinesterase}} (<b>AChE)</b> terminates synaptic transmission at cholinergic synapses by hydrolyzing the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, but {{can also}} exert ‘non-classical’, morpho-regulatory effects on developing neurons such as stimulation of neurite outgrowth. Here, we investigated the role of <b>AChE</b> binding to laminin- 1 on the regulation of neurite outgrowth by using cell culture, immunocytochemistry, and molecular biological approaches. To explore the role of <b>AChE,</b> we examined fiber growth of cells overexpressing different forms of <b>AChE,</b> and/or during their growth on laminin- 1. A significant increase of neuritic growth as compared with controls was observed for neurons over-expressing <b>AChE.</b> Accordingly, addition of globular <b>AChE</b> to the medium increased total length of neurites. Co-transfection with PRIMA, a membrane anchor of <b>AChE,</b> led {{to an increase in}} fiber length similar to <b>AChE</b> overexpressing cells. Transfection with an <b>AChE</b> mutant that leads to the retention of <b>AChE</b> within cells had no stimulatory effect on neurite length. Noticeably, the longest neurites were produced by neurons overexpressing <b>AChE</b> and growing on laminin- 1, suggesting that the AChE/ laminin interaction is involved in regulating neurite outgrowth. Our findings demonstrate that binding of <b>AChE</b> to laminin- 1 alters <b>AChE</b> activity and leads to increased neurite growth in culture. A possible mechanism of the <b>AChE</b> effect on neurite outgrowth is proposed due to the interaction of <b>AChE</b> with laminin- 1...|$|R

5|$|The pain pathway {{is mostly}} {{transmitted}} via myelinated Aδ (sharp or stabbing pain) and unmyelinated C nerve fibers (slow, dull, <b>aching,</b> or burning pain) of the trigeminal nerve, which supplies sensation {{to the teeth}} and gums via many divisions and branches. Initially, pain is felt while noxious stimuli are applied (such as cold). Continued exposure decreases firing thresholds of the nerves, allowing normally non-painful stimuli to trigger pain (allodynia). Should the insult continue, noxious stimuli produce larger discharges in the nerve, perceived as more intense pain. Spontaneous pain may occur if the firing threshold is decreased so it can fire without stimulus (hyperalgesia). The physical component of pain is processed in the medullary spinal cord and perceived in the frontal cortex. Because pain perception involves overlapping sensory systems and an emotional component, individual responses to identical stimuli are variable.|$|E

40|$|To date, {{more than}} 40 {{different}} types of cells from primary cultures or cell lines have shown <b>AChE</b> expression during apoptosis and after the induction apoptosis by different stimuli. It has been well-established that increased <b>AChE</b> expression or activity is detected in apoptotic cells after apoptotic stimuli in vitro and in vivo, and <b>AChE</b> could be therefore used as a marker of apoptosis. <b>AChE</b> is not an apoptosis initiator, but the cells in which <b>AChE</b> is overexpressed undergo apoptosis more easily than controls. Interestingly, cells with downregulated levels of <b>AChE</b> are not sensitive to apoptosis induction and <b>AChE</b> deficiency can protect against apoptosis. Some tumor cells do not express <b>AChE,</b> but when <b>AChE</b> is introduced into a tumor cell, the cells cease to proliferate and undergo apoptosis more readily. Therefore, <b>AChE</b> can be classified as a tumor suppressor gene. <b>AChE</b> plays {{a pivotal role in}} apoptosome formation, and silencing of the <b>AChE</b> gene prevents caspase- 9 activation, with consequent decreased cell viability, nuclear condensation and poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase cleavage. <b>AChE</b> is translocated into the nucleus, which may be an important event during apoptosis.

40|$|The ACh-mediated system {{consisting}} of acetylcholine (ACh), acetylcholine receptor (AChR) and acetylcholinesterase (<b>AChE)</b> is fundamental for nervous system function in animals and insects. Although plants lack a nervous system, both ACh and ACh-hydrolyzing activity {{have been widely}} recognized in the plant kingdom. The function of the plant ACh-mediated system is still unclear, despite more than 30 years of research. To understand ACh-mediated systems in plants, we previously purified maize <b>AChE</b> and cloned the corresponding gene from maize seedlings (Plant Physiology). In a recent paper in Planta, we also purified and cloned <b>AChE</b> from the legume plant siratro (Macroptilium atropurpureum).

40|$|Neural signals {{modulate}} acetylcholinesterase (<b>AChE)</b> {{expression in}} skeletal muscle cells. However, the cellular and molecular events mediating these effects are poorly understood. The {{mechanisms by which}} nerve-evoked electrical activity and nerve-derived trophic factors regulate the expression of <b>AChE</b> along muscle fibers was therefore elucidated. The contribution of nerve-evoked activity versus intrinsic properties of muscle fibers was assessed for their role in dictating the distinct patterns of <b>AChE</b> expression displayed by fast and slow muscles. We demonstrate that nerve-evoked electrical impulses {{play a key role}} in regulating <b>AChE</b> synthesis in these distinct muscle types. We also demonstrate that myogenic precursor cells from fast and slow muscle fibers generate myotubes that display similar patterns of <b>AChE</b> expression. Together, these findings suggest that nerve-evoked electrical activity rather than intrinsic properties of muscle cells is the primary regulator of <b>AChE</b> expression in fast and slow muscles. The importance of transcriptional versus post-transcriptional mechanisms in mediating the activity-dependent regulation of <b>AChE</b> was also determined. We demonstrate that higher levels of <b>AChE</b> mRNA observed in fast versus slow muscles is due to post-transcriptional events. We also show that reductions of <b>AChE</b> mRNA seen in mature denervated muscles cannot be accounted for by a decrease in the rate of <b>AChE</b> gene transcription. Denervation-induced reductions in the levels of <b>AChE</b> mRNA were less pronounced in muscles of developing animals. This attenuated decrease in <b>AChE</b> transcript abundance may be due to a transient enhancement in the transcriptional activity of the <b>AChE</b> gene observed in denervated muscles of developing rats. Transcriptional as well as post-transcriptional mechanisms are therefore important in mediating the activity-dependent regulation of <b>AChE</b> in developing muscles whereas post-transcriptional events are the primary mediators controlling <b>AChE</b> expression in mature muscles. Finally, the activity of several rat <b>AChE</b> promoter fragments in synaptic versus extrasynaptic regions of muscle fibers was assessed to determined whether enhanced transcription of the <b>AChE</b> gene in synaptic nuclei contributes to the accumulation of <b>AChE</b> transcripts at the neuromuscular synapse. Our findings indicate that synapse-specific activity of the <b>AChE</b> gene contributes to localized expression of the enzyme and its mRNA at the neuromuscular junction. Furthermore, we observed that calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) downregulate <b>AChE</b> expression. The suppressive effects of CGRP and CNTF on <b>AChE</b> expression suggest that a combination of activating and inhibiting signalling cascades may function in concert to regulate the abundance of <b>AChE</b> transcripts at synaptic sites...|$|R
