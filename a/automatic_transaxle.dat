2500|$|General Motors and Ford Motor Company cooperated in 2002 {{to create}} a new <b>automatic</b> <b>transaxle,</b> {{designed}} for transverse engine applications in cars. The companies jointly committed to investing US$720 million in their manufacturing plants to support the new transmission.|$|E
2500|$|Power {{went through}} either a four-or {{five-speed}} manual, or a three-speed <b>automatic</b> <b>transaxle.</b> The base engine produced [...] {{to accelerate the}} [...] Alliance from 0 to 60 mph in 14.3 seconds, and gave it an [...] top speed. Steering was rack and pinion. The suspension system was fully independent via MacPherson struts in front, while the rear had a compact and ingenious system of transverse torsion bars and trailing arms. At just under [...] for the base model, the Alliance was also the lightest car assembled in the U.S. in its time.|$|E
2500|$|Although sales {{literature}} listed only two models available in 1984, {{there were at}} least three models available with different option packages. There was the Fiero Coupe, the Sport Coupe and the SE. The Fiero Coupe, also called [...] "Fuel Economy Leader", came with the MY-8 4-speed manual transaxle that had a 0.73 overdrive top gear along with a high mpg 3.32:1 axel ratio. This gave it an EPA highway/city rating of 50/31 mpg. Air conditioning and <b>automatic</b> <b>transaxle</b> could not be ordered. The starting price for the Fiero Coupe was $7999. The Fiero Sport Coupe, also referred to as the [...] "base car", came with the M-19 four-speed manual with a 0.81 top gear along with 4.10:1 differential, giving it better acceleration at the cost of fuel economy, 42/26 mpg. An automatic 3-speed transmission, MD-9 Hydramatic 125-C, was available along with A/C. The starting price was $8499 for the Sport Coupe. The top model was the Fiero SE, starting at $9599, it included the WS-6 handling package along with other trim upgrades.|$|E

5000|$|The 1989 TC used a {{slightly}} detuned [...] Daytona-spec turbocharged 2.2 L straight-4. This intercooled version, {{known as the}} Turbo II, was coupled to an A413 three-speed <b>automatic</b> <b>transaxle.</b> The Turbo II {{was replaced by a}} Mitsubishi-sourced 3.02 L [...] V6 engine for the 1990 and 1991 model years, with the <b>automatic</b> <b>transaxle</b> being upgraded to a four-speed A604 unit.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "-E" [...] {{transmission}} is electronically controlled and features an <b>automatic</b> overdrive <b>transaxle</b> with an electronically controlled torque converter clutch.|$|R
50|$|The 4T80-E {{transmission}} is electronically controlled and features an <b>automatic</b> overdrive <b>transaxle</b> with an electronically controlled torque converter clutch. The 4T80 originally used a viscous clutch, {{but this was}} changed in 2005.|$|R
50|$|Gear oil is a {{lubricant}} made {{specifically for}} transmissions, transfer cases, and differentials in automobiles, trucks, and other machinery. It is {{of a higher}} viscosity to better protect the gears and usually {{is associated with a}} strong sulfur smell. The high viscosity ensures transfer of lubricant throughout the gear train. This is necessary since the devices needing this heavy oil do not have pumps for transferring the oil with only a portion of the lowermost gears bathed in an oil sump. This heavy oil can create viscous drag leading to inefficiencies in vehicle operation. Some modern <b>automatic</b> <b>transaxles</b> (integrated transmission and differential) do not use a heavy oil at all but lubricate with the lower viscosity hydraulic fluid, which is available at pressure within the automatic transmission.|$|R

50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Chrysler {{designed}} the A404 TorqueFlite three-speed <b>automatic</b> <b>transaxle</b> for its {{front wheel drive}} Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon subcompact cars. This transaxle would be upgraded in the 1980s into the A413 and A670 units, which were progressively heavier-duty, for Chrysler's K-cars and their derivatives, including the minivans. The four-speed Ultradrive electronic four-speed <b>automatic</b> <b>transaxle</b> would eventually replace it, but the three-speed lasted {{for more than a}} decade after the 1989 debut of the four-speed unit.|$|E
50|$|The Aisin AF33 is a 5-speed <b>automatic</b> <b>transaxle</b> {{developed}} and manufactured in Anjo, Japan by Aisin AW, {{a division of}} Aisin. It {{is designed to be}} used in transverse engine configurations in both FWD and AWD configurations.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "-E" [...] {{series is}} {{electronically}} controlled and features an <b>automatic</b> overdrive <b>transaxle</b> with an electronically controlled torque converter clutch. Since the non-electronic versions of these transmissions does not exist, it is conventional {{to refer to}} these models as simply 4T40 and 4T45, leaving out the [...] "-E".|$|R
5000|$|The Achieva was {{a compact}} car {{produced}} by the General Motors' Oldsmobile division from 1991 to 1998 and was available as a sedan or coupe. It was offered in four different trim levels during its production run; S, SC, SL, and SCX. The engines available throughout the production run included {{different versions of the}} Oldsmobile-developed Quad 4, ranging from the high-output LGO (RPO code) version and an even higher output special [...] "W41" [...] version of the LGO Quad 4 (used in the SCX models), a normal DOHC LD2 version of the 2.3 L Quad 4, the SOHC [...] "Quad OHC" [...] variant, as well as the later Quad 4-based [...] "2.4L twin cam" [...] LD9. A pair of V6 engines were also offered including the Buick-sourced 90° 3.3 L [...] "3300" [...] V6 that was later replaced by Chevrolet's 60° 3.1 L [...] "3100" [...] V6.

5000|$|At the LA Auto Show, on November 15, 2010, General Motors {{announced}} that it would be releasing an all-new version of the BAS system available in the 2012 Buick LaCrosse. While still a Belted Alternator Starter system, the system is named eAssist and includes a larger more powerful Hitachi-supplied 115 Volt Lithium Ion battery and a [...] motor-generator that delivers 79 lbft Nm of torque. The additional power provided by the more powerful battery and motor provides the ability to contribute more power, and more often able to electrically start and assist the 2.4L engine. The eAssist system also includes a specially modified GM 6T40 6-speed <b>automatic</b> FWD <b>transaxle.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2008, a facelifted {{version was}} introduced. External {{modifications}} include a new front bumper with new foglights. A five-speed <b>automatic</b> <b>transaxle</b> replaced the four-speed unit used in NA FWD models. Six-speed Automatics {{remained in the}} turbo and 4WD models.|$|E

50|$|In 1989, Wiegert's company, {{now known}} as the Vector Aeromotive Corporation, began {{production}} of the W8, an evolution of the W2. Financial backing came from public stock offerings and various lawsuits including suits against the Goodyear Tire Company (trademark infringement with the Vector brand of tires) and Vantage cigarettes. Two W8 prototypes were made, of which only one ran. The Vector W8 utilized an <b>automatic</b> Oldsmobile TM425 <b>Transaxle</b> mated to a Twin-Turbo CAN-AM modified Chevrolet small block V8 engine.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the field}} of {{automotive}} repair, the term [...] "line technician" [...] or [...] "heavy line technician" [...] is a reference to [...] "driveline technician" [...] and is used mainly in dealerships. The term heavy line technician is due to these mechanics specializing in the engine and transmission issues, and they are usually the more experienced mechanics. Light line or line mechanic is more suited to general mechanical issues like water pumps, alternators, power steering, brakes, suspension systems, and {{other areas of the}} vehicle. Light line techs will usually move into heavy line tech as they master the job of repair to vehicles. These terms have been used throughout the industry, and vehicle repair involves [...] "applied science", in particular electrical theory, fluid dynamics, chemistry, metallurgy, and physics and an understanding of all areas of current design in vehicles used in North America. The heavy line tech is the jargon used in the industry that would denote a top-level mechanic, and more recently an ASE Master Mechanic with longtime experience, who concentrate on major engine and transmission repairs. [...] "ASE" [...] is the [...] "National Institute for Automotive Excellence". They are the largest organization presently to test and certify mechanics in the US. They have many areas of testing, including engine repair, <b>automatic</b> transmission/manual <b>transaxle,</b> suspension and steering, brakes, heating and air conditioning, and engine performance. They have many other testing and certification programs, including truck specialist and parts specialist.|$|R
