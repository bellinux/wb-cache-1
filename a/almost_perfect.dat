5|$|The Tribunal was {{a medieval}} merchant's house, {{used as the}} Abbey {{courthouse}} and, during the Monmouth Rebellion trials, by Judge Jeffreys. It now serves as a museum containing possessions and works of art from the Glastonbury Lake Village which were preserved in <b>almost</b> <b>perfect</b> condition in the peat after the village was abandoned. The museum {{is run by the}} Glastonbury Antiquarian Society. The building also houses the tourist information centre.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, NASA {{launched}} the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite (COBE), which made two major advances: in 1990, high-precision spectrum measurements {{showed that the}} CMB frequency spectrum is an <b>almost</b> <b>perfect</b> blackbody with no deviations {{at a level of}} 1 part in 104, and measured a residual temperature of 2.726K (more recent measurements have revised this figure down slightly to 2.7255K); then in 1992, further COBE measurements discovered tiny fluctuations (anisotropies) in the CMB temperature across the sky, at a level of about one part in 105. John C. Mather and George Smoot were awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physics for their leadership in these results.|$|E

50|$|Vishnu {{suggested}} that he wander as a gandharva celestial musician singing the praises of the Lord until the time of Vishnu’s incarnation as Krishna. At that time he should remind Vishnu (as Krishna) of the incident. When Vishnu came to earth as Krishna and was reminded, he sent Narada to various experts until his command of music was <b>almost</b> <b>perfected.</b> Then Krishna himself taught him the best forms of devotional music and song.|$|R

25|$|The {{original}} Anglo-Saxon {{names for}} the village were Hlidaford or Hlidan, from hlid, meaning a cover or lid, referring to the <b>almost</b> <b>perfect</b> concealment of the river beneath the chasm at the bridge, and ford (crossing).

40|$|Abstract. A {{sequence}} a = (a 0, a 1, a 2, · · ·, an) {{is said to}} be {{an almost}} p-ary sequence of period n + 1 if a 0 = 0 and ai = ζ bi p for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, where ζp is a primitive p-th root of unity and bi ∈ { 0, 1, · · ·, p − 1 }. Such a sequence a is called perfect if all its out-of-phase autocorrelation coefficients are zero; and is called nearly perfect if its out-of-phase auto-correlation coefficients are all 1, or are all − 1. In this paper, on the one hand, we construct <b>almost</b> p-ary <b>perfect</b> and nearly perfect sequences; on the other hand, we present results to show they do not exist with certain periods. It is shown that <b>almost</b> p-ary <b>perfect</b> sequences correspond to certain relative difference sets, and <b>almost</b> p-ary nearly <b>perfect</b> sequences correspond to certain direct product difference sets. Finally, two tables of the existence status of such sequences with period less than 100 are given...|$|R

The soil is rich and sandy and the towering Andes mountains provide a constant flow of pure water for irrigation. Naturally sheltered as it is from heavy rain or freezing temperatures, Peru is an <b>almost</b> <b>perfect</b> climate for the cultivation of avocados.|$|E
25|$|Chlorpromazine {{and other}} typical {{antipsychotics}} are primarily blockers of D2 receptors. In fact an <b>almost</b> <b>perfect</b> correlation {{exists between the}} therapeutic dose of a typical antipsychotic and the drug's affinity for the D2 receptor. Therefore, a larger dose is required if the drug’s affinity for the D2 receptor is relatively weak. A correlation exists between average clinical potency and affinity of the antipsychotics for dopamine receptors.|$|E

In the novel, Zhao Yun is portrayed as an <b>almost</b> <b>perfect</b> warrior – one who possesses powerful combat skills, unwavering loyalty to his lord, tremendous courage, keen intelligence, and serene charisma. These traits have often been reflected in nearly all modern materials about Zhao Yun to date.|$|E
60|$|Section 23. The frog has an ovum with a {{moderate}} allowance of yolk, but the quantity is only sufficient {{to start the}} little animal a part of its way towards the adult state. The fowl, on the contrary, has an enormous ovum, gorged excessively, with yolk, {{and as a consequence}} the chick is <b>almost</b> <b>perfected</b> when it is hatched. The so-called yolk, the yellow of an egg, is the ovum proper; around that is a coating of white albumen, in a shell membrane and a shell. At either end of the yolk (Figure 1, y.) twisted strands of albuminous matter, the chalazae (ch.) keep the yolk in place. The animal pole is a small grey protoplasmic area, the germinal area (g.a.), on the yolk.|$|R

25|$|In 1794, Lagrange was {{appointed}} professor of the École Polytechnique; and his lectures there, described by mathematicians {{who had the}} good fortune to be able to attend them, were <b>almost</b> <b>perfect</b> both in form and matter. Beginning with the merest elements, he led his hearers on until, almost unknown to themselves, they were themselves extending the bounds of the subject: above all he impressed on his pupils the advantage of always using general methods expressed in a symmetrical notation.|$|E
25|$|Father Creagh {{was moved}} by his {{superiors}} initially to Belfast and then to {{an island in the}} Pacific Ocean. In 1914 he was promoted by the Pope to be Vicar Apostolic of Kimberley, Western Australia, a position he held until 1922. He died in Wellington, New Zealand in 1947. Joe Briscoe, son of Robert Briscoe, the Dublin Jewish politician, describes the Limerick episode as “an aberration in an otherwise <b>almost</b> <b>perfect</b> history of Ireland and its treatment of the Jews”.|$|E
25|$|The {{excavations}} {{started again}} in 1927, {{under the direction}} of Campbell Thompson, who had taken part in King's expeditions. Some works were carried out outside Kouyunjik, for instance on the mound of Nebi Yunus, which was the ancient arsenal of Nineveh, or along the outside walls. Here, near the northwestern corner of the walls, beyond the pavement of a later building, the archaeologists found almost 300 fragments of prisms recording the royal annals of Sennacherib, Esarhaddon, and Ashurbanipal, beside a prism of Esarhaddon which was <b>almost</b> <b>perfect.</b>|$|E
