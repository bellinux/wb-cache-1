5|$|Paul's second children's {{book was}} {{published}} - again by Albert Whitman & Company - in October 2015. Based on his Christmas poem The Night the Lights Went Out on Christmas, the book, illustrated by Scott Brundage, is the whimsical yet heartwarming story of <b>a</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>where</b> families trying to outdo one another with Christmas lights and decorations use so much electrical power that the neighborhood is thrown into darkness. The poem originally appeared on Paul's City of Silver Dreams Christmas CD and is included as a downloadable mp3 file with the book.|$|E
5|$|Levels in {{the console}} {{versions}} of Underground were significantly {{larger than those}} of earlier Tony Hawk's games. Neversoft expanded each level until it ceased to run correctly, then shrunk it slightly. Most of the levels were modelled closely after real-world locations; the designers traveled to locales representative of each city {{in the game and}} took photographs and videos as reference. The New Jersey level was a replication of <b>a</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>where</b> team artist Henry Ji had grown up as a young skater. Neversoft wanted the player to become familiar with the basic game mechanics quickly and to notice Undergrounds differences from previous Tony Hawk's titles immediately. To accomplish this, they introduced the ability to travel on foot, and the ability to climb along ledges in the first few missions of the game. While Neversoft wanted to keep Underground realistic and relatable for the most part, they added driving side-missions as an enjoyable diversion and to push the boundaries of freedom in skateboarding games. However, these missions were intended not to take away from the main experience of skateboarding.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout his career, Inzunza Inzunza {{was able}} to avoid going to prison several times and intimidate law enforcement; one time in the late 1990s, two patrol cars from the Federal Ministerial Police (PFM) went into <b>a</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>where</b> Inzunza Inzunza was staying to carry out an arrest warrant. Though the police were going after a person uninvolved with the drug lord, his triggermen stopped the PFM cars and ordered them to call their boss. When the police {{commander}} arrived at the scene minutes later, Inzunza Inzunza walked {{up to him and}} smacked him several times, telling him he had no permission to be in his territory and to never stop by again. When the drug lord ordered them to leave, his gunmen took away their weapons for a couple of days. On 12 November 2002 in Culiacán, the Federal Preventive Police (PFP) intercepted a convoy of gunmen in which Inzunza Inzunza was traveling. A shootout eventually broke out, resulting in the death of four policemen and one gunmen. However, Inzunza Inzunza managed to escape the scene. Three years later on April 2005, Inzunza Inzunza intimidated several police officers who were patrolling his neighborhood and forced them to return to their headquarters. On 5 May 2005, Inzunza Inzunza travelled to Mazatlán to attend a rehab center for his drug addiction. While heading there, he was arrested by the Mazatlán Municipal Police with eight of his men. The police confiscated several assault rifles, handguns, grenades, and grenade launchers. The arrest of Inzunza Inzunza was initially reported by a photojournalist who managed to take a picture of him, but the drug lord never made it to prison; unconfirmed reports stated that he bribed the police to avoid going to jail. He escaped with Ismael Bernal Cristerna (alias [...] "El Mongol"), but he was later killed by Inzunza Inzunza in 2013 because the drug lord feared betrayal.|$|E

The company are said to carry on an active and prosperous trade, and to give great encouragement to settlers.

The American traders and trappers who venture across the mountains, instead of enjoying the participation in the trade of the river and its tributaries, that had been stipulated by treaty, are obliged to keep to the south, out of the track of the Hudson's Bay parties.|$|E
