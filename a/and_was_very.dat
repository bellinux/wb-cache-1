5|$|One day I chanced {{to see a}} {{performance}} of the Bunraku puppet theater <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> surprised by it. It was in the tone quality, the timbre, of the futazao shamisen, the wide-necked shamisen used in Bunraku, that I first recognized the splendor of traditional Japanese music. I was very moved by it and I wondered why my attention had never been captured before by this Japanese music.|$|E
5|$|The 1812 Louisiana Hurricane {{was a major}} {{hurricane}} {{that struck}} New Orleans, Louisiana, during the War of 1812.

5|$|After {{years in}} {{opposition}} in the parliament, in September 1848, the Party of Order was called upon by PedroII {{to form a new}} cabinet. The saquarema cabinet was composed of men with whom Caxias had close relationships, among them Eusébio de Queirós, who had helped him bring order to the streets of Rio de Janeiro in the late 1830s. Caxias was now a wealthy planter who owned slaves <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> {{much a part of the}} landed aristocracy that formed the backbone of the Party of Order. With the help of his wealthy mother-in-law, he purchased his first property—a coffee farm—in 1838. He acquired more lands in 1849, further expanding his plantation. Due to growing international demand, coffee had become the most valuable export commodity for Brazil.|$|E
5|$|As a preacher, he {{was rather}} eccentric. He {{was not very}} fluent and gifted as a speaker, but had the power of {{engaging}} the attention of his hearers, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> successful and useful in a revival of religion. He entertained rather singular views {{on the subject of}} the orders in the ministry, objecting to the order of deacons, and holding that the eldership is the only true order. In consequence of these peculiar views, he would never consent to be ordained a deacon, and therefore never entered into orders at all.|$|E
5|$|Crazy Taxi is {{a series}} of score attack racing video games that was {{developed}} by Hitmaker and published by Sega. The first game appeared in arcades in 1999 <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> successful, prompting Sega to port the arcade version to their Dreamcast console in 2000. It is the third best-selling Dreamcast game in the United States, selling over a million copies. The game was later ported to the PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube, and PC with sequels also appearing on the Xbox, Game Boy Advance, and PlayStation Portable systems.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} {{advocate}} for the many thousands of returned servicemen and women many ex-services organisations sprang up. The most prominent of these was probably the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia which had been established in 1916 by representatives from many state-based organisations already in existence. Following the war this organisation grew in its political influence as its numbers grew <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> active in the repatriation process, advocating for financial entitlements for veterans and securing concessions for soldiers returning to civilian employment. By 1919 it was estimated to have 150,000 members although this fell dramatically in the mid-1920s.|$|E
5|$|Joining Mikulski as an {{advocate}} for servicing Hubble was NASA's Chief Scientist, physicist John Grunsfeld, who {{was present at the}} meeting when O'Keefe announced the cancellation of the mission. A veteran astronaut of four shuttle missions, including two Hubble servicing missions, Grunsfeld had devoted years to Hubble, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> disappointed when O'Keefe canceled the mission. He briefly considered retiring from NASA, but realized if he stayed, he could continue to advance physics in other ways. Instead, Grunsfeld dedicated himself to finding alternate ways to service the telescope, possibly by sending a robot into orbit to do the job. When O'Keefe announced his resignation as Administrator in December 2004, five days after a National Academy of Sciences committee opposed O'Keefe's position regarding servicing Hubble, the media and science community saw hope for the telescope's servicing mission to be reinstated.|$|E
5|$|Nanako is {{an extreme}} tomboy with an {{insensitive}} personality. Like Akira Uehara, she becomes popular with the students and Akira's parents after the exchange due to her personality and Akira's masculine appearance. Initially Nanako intended {{to return to her}} body after having fun as a male <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> strict on how Akira treated her body. She resolves to stay in Akira's body and relents her body's ownership to Akira after she falls completely in love with her friend, Makoto Shiina. Her parents learn about the exchange and are supportive of the statusquo as they accept Nanako's hopelessness as a female. She is voiced by Miyuki Sawashiro in the three radio dramas and is portrayed by Mai Takahashi in the live action film.|$|E

5|$|Of {{the actors}} {{cast in the}} four leading roles, only Gina McKee {{was a native of}} North East England, and she was from Sunderland rather than from Newcastle. McKee related {{strongly}} to many of the characters and story elements in the scripts <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> keen to play Mary, but the production team was initially uncertain whether {{it would be possible to}} age her up convincingly enough to portray the character in her 50s. McKee was concerned that she would not be given the part after an unsuccessful makeup test where efforts to make her appear to be in her 50s resulted in her resembling a drag queen.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 2010 NBA Draft, Rolle hired Fletcher Cockrell {{to be his}} agent. ESPN, NBADraft.net, and DraftExpress.com {{projected}} him to be {{a possible}} mid-to-late second-round selection. He worked out with the Washington Wizards, Phoenix Suns, Milwaukee Bucks, Charlotte Bobcats, and Indiana Pacers. Dave-Te' Thomas of CBS Sports said that Rolle had a good wingspan <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> athletic. He added while larger NBA forwards might push him around, he was an intense player and would not back down if challenged. Thomas compared Rolle to former LSU teammate Tyrus Thomas.|$|E
5|$|The 2/6th Independent Company {{had won a}} {{significant}} victory, but now had 23 wounded <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> low on ammunition. Frazier landed on the newly captured airstrip in his Piper Cub at 12:30. He rejected the airstrip as unsuitable for Dakotas, and oversaw the preparation of a new airstrip on better ground near Mission Hill. This was still a difficult approach, as aircraft had to land upwind while avoiding Mission Hill. Although it was not known if the airstrip would be ready, Hutchison flew in for a test landing there the next day, 21 September, at 15:30. He collected the wounded and flew them to Nadzab, and returned an hour later with a load of rations and ammunition. He also brought with him Brigadier Ivan Dougherty, {{the commander of the}} 21st Infantry Brigade, and his headquarters, who took charge of the area. Around 18:00, six more transports arrived.|$|E

5|$|The Ilyushin Il-40 (NATO {{reporting}} name: Brawny) was a two-seat Soviet jet-engined armored ground-attack aircraft. The first prototype flew in 1953 <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> successful {{except when}} it fired its guns, as their combustion gasses disturbed the airflow into the engines and caused them to flameout or hiccup. Remedying this problem took over a year and involved the radical change of moving the engine air intakes {{all the way to}} the very front of the aircraft and repositioning the guns from the tip of the nose to the bottom of the fuselage, just behind the nosewheel. The aircraft, now resembling a double-barreled shotgun from the front, was ordered into production in 1955. Only five production aircraft had been completed before the entire program was canceled in early 1956 when the VVS discarded its close air-support doctrine in favor of tactical nuclear weapons on the battlefield.|$|E
5|$|The episode, first {{aired on}} Channel 4 on 18 February 2013, was watched by 1.2 million viewers <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> well {{received}} by critics, particularly for its writing and Middleton's performance. The story draws parallels with real murder cases, primarily the 1960s Moors murders, where five children were killed. Its horror aspects {{are reminiscent of}} the 1970s film The Wicker Man and the video game Manhunt, while some similarities with The Twilight Zone have also been noted. This dystopian episode reflects upon several aspects of contemporary society, such as media coverage of murders, technology's effects on people's empathy, desensitization, violence as entertainment, vigilantism, the concept of justice and punishment, {{and the nature of}} reality.|$|E
5|$|The reformers' {{propaganda}} {{claimed that}} England had been unified {{as a result}} of the wide acceptance of Benedictinism, and that the movement's greatest benefactor, King Edgar, had played a major role in the unification by his demands for adherence to the Benedictine Rule. Æthelwold probably tutored Edgar as a boy, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> close to him; it is likely that Æthelwold was influential in persuading the king to carry through his reforms and support Benedictine monasticism. Monks became dominant on the bishops' bench during his reign.|$|E

5|$|The trilogy's online promotional trailer {{was first}} {{released}} on 27 April 2000, {{and set a}} new record for download hits, registering 1.7million hits in the first 24 hours of its release. The trailer used a selection from the soundtrack for Braveheart and The Shawshank Redemption among other cuts. In 2001, 24minutes of footage from the series, primarily the Moria sequence, was shown at the Cannes Film Festival, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> well received. The showing also included an area designed to look like Middle-earth.|$|E
5|$|Written by Nabil Shaban (better {{known as}} Sil from the Colin Baker Doctor Who stories Vengeance on Varos and The Trial of a Time Lord) {{who was a}} {{longtime}} fan of Doctor Who and had previously suggested himself to replace the late Roger Delgado as the Master. In offering this script to the production office in 1980, Shaban also put himself forward as a potential successor to Tom Baker as the Doctor. Nothing came of Invasion of the Veridians. Nabil Shaban had only written the first episode, it was written around the early 1970s, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> much influenced by the Troughton/Pertwee era. Nabil believes that the only copy has now been lost in time, as he no longer has it.|$|E
5|$|After the {{establishment}} of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, the HSS established itself as the most popular Croatian political party <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> popular despite efforts to ban it. The 1921 constitution defined the kingdom as a unitary state and abolished the historical administrative divisions, which effectively ended Croatian autonomy; the constitution was opposed by HSS. The political situation deteriorated further as Stjepan Radić of the HSS was assassinated in the Yugoslav Parliament in 1928, leading to the dictatorship of King Alexander in January 1929. The HSS, now led by Vladko Maček, continued to advocate the federalisation of Yugoslavia, resulting in the Cvetković–Maček Agreement of August 1939 and the autonomous Banovina of Croatia. The Yugoslav government retained control of defence, internal security, foreign affairs, trade, and transport while other matters were left to the Croatian Sabor and a crown-appointed Ban. This arrangement was soon made obsolete with the beginning of World War II, when the Independent State of Croatia, which banned all political opposition, was established. Since then, the HSS continues to operate abroad.|$|E
