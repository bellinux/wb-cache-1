5|$|Ruffed lemurs, on average, spend 28% {{of the day}} feeding, 53% resting, and 19% traveling, {{although}} {{differences in}} resting <b>and</b> <b>feeding</b> durations have been observed between males and females, with females resting less <b>and</b> <b>feeding</b> more. They are diurnal; although peak activity occurs during the early morning and late afternoon or evening, resting usually occurs around midday. When resting, ruffed lemurs often sit hunched or upright. They are also frequently seen lying prone over a branch or sunbathing in a supine position with the limbs outstretched. When feeding, they will often hang upside-down by their hind feet, a type of suspensory behavior, which allows them to reach fruits and flowers.|$|E

To determine specific employment opportunities by job category. To determine specific employment characteristics of grain <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> businesses: Ages of employees Education level of employees Amount of experience necessary for employment Level of education necessary for employment This study was limited to the population of the Nebraska Grain <b>and</b> <b>Feed</b> Dealers Association’s “Grain <b>and</b> <b>Feed</b> Directory <b>and</b> Buyers Guide, 1968 ” which lists all grain elevators, dehydrating plants, federal and state licensed grain warehouses <b>and</b> major <b>feed</b> businesses.
