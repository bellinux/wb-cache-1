5|$|Analog {{computers}} {{work directly}} with physical quantities, so their addition mechanisms {{depend on the}} form of the addends. A mechanical adder might represent two addends as the positions of sliding blocks, in which case they can be added with an averaging lever. If the addends are the rotation speeds of two shafts, they can be added with a differential. A hydraulic adder can add the pressures in two chambers by exploiting Newton's second law to balance forces on an assembly of pistons. The most common situation for a general-purpose analog computer is to add two voltages (referenced to ground); this can be accomplished roughly with <b>a</b> <b>resistor</b> network, but a better design exploits an operational amplifier.|$|E

25|$|Resistors {{with higher}} power ratings are {{physically}} larger and may require heat sinks.

The nominal value of the resistance falls within the manufacturing tolerance, indicated on the component.|$|E
50|$|Practical {{resistors}} {{are also}} specified {{as having a}} maximum power rating which must exceed the anticipated power dissipation of that <b>resistor</b> in <b>a</b> particular circuit: this is mainly of concern in power electronics applications.Resistors with higher power ratings are physically larger and may require heat sinks.

25|$|The {{impedance}} of {{a device}} {{can be calculated}} by complex division of the voltage and current. The impedance of the device can be calculated by applying a sinusoidal voltage to the device in series with <b>a</b> <b>resistor,</b> and measuring the voltage across the resistor and across the device.

25|$|Substances {{in which}} {{electricity}} can flow are called conductors. A piece of conducting material {{of a particular}} resistance meant {{for use in a}} circuit is called <b>a</b> <b>resistor.</b> Conductors are made of high-conductivity materials such as metals, in particular copper and aluminium.

If the inverting input is held at ground (0V) directly or by <b>a</b> <b>resistor</b> Rg, and the input voltage Vin applied to the non-inverting input is positive, the output will be maximum positive; if Vin is negative, the output will be maximum negative. Since there is no feedback from the output to either input, this is an open-loop circuit acting as a comparator.|$|E
25|$|Early {{resistors}} {{were made}} in more or less arbitrary round numbers; a series might have 100, 125, 150, 200, 300, etc. Resistors as manufactured are subject to a certain percentage tolerance, and {{it makes sense to}} manufacture values that correlate with the tolerance, so that the actual value of <b>a</b> <b>resistor</b> overlaps slightly with its neighbors. Wider spacing leaves gaps; narrower spacing increases manufacturing and inventory costs to provide resistors that are more or less interchangeable.|$|E
25|$|In some {{consumer}} electronic equipment, {{notably in}} television sets {{in the era}} of valves (vacuum tubes), but also in some low-cost record players, the vacuum tube heaters were connected in series. Since the voltage drop across all the heaters in series was usually less than the full mains voltage, it was necessary to provide a ballast to drop the excess voltage. <b>A</b> <b>resistor</b> was often used for this purpose, as it was cheap and worked with both AC and DC.|$|E
