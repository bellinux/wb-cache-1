25|$|Numerical {{solution}} of either {{is performed using}} the moment method solution which requires expansion of that current into a set of basis functions; one simple (but not the best) choice, for instance, is {{to break up the}} conductor into N segments with a constant current assumed along each. After setting an appropriate weighting function the cost may be minimized through the inversion of a NxN matrix. Determination of each matrix element requires at least one double integration involving the weighting functions, which may become computationally intensive. These are simplified if the weighting functions are simply delta functions, which corresponds to fitting the boundary conditions for the current along the conductor at only N discrete points. Then the NxN matrix must be inverted, which is also computationally intensive as N increases. In one simple example, Balanis performs this computation to find the <b>antenna</b> <b>impedance</b> with different N using Pocklington's method and finds that with N>60 solutions have approached their limiting values to within a few percent.|$|E

50|$|The actual antenna {{which is}} {{transmitting}} the original wave then also may receive a strong signal {{from its own}} image from the ground. This will induce an additional current in the antenna element, changing the current at the feedpoint for a given feedpoint voltage. Thus the <b>antenna's</b> <b>impedance,</b> given by the ratio of feedpoint voltage to current, is altered due to the antenna's proximity to the ground. This can be quite a significant effect when the antenna is within a wavelength {{or two of the}} ground. But as the antenna height is increased, the reduced power of the reflected wave (due to the inverse square law) allows the antenna to approach its asymptotic feedpoint impedance given by theory. At lower heights, the effect on the <b>antenna's</b> <b>impedance</b> is very sensitive to the exact distance from the ground, as this affects the phase of the reflected wave relative to the currents in the antenna. Changing the antenna's height by a quarter wavelength, then changes the phase of the reflection by 180°, with a completely different effect on the <b>antenna's</b> <b>impedance.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Therefore, in {{improved}} receiver circuits, {{in order to}} match the <b>antenna</b> <b>impedance</b> to the receiver's impedance, the antenna was connected across {{only a portion of}} the tuning coil's turns. This made the tuning coil act as an impedance matching transformer (in an autotransformer connection) in addition to providing the tuning function. The antenna's low resistance was increased (transformed) by a factor equal to the square of the turns ratio (the ratio of the number of turns the antenna was connected to, to the total number of turns of the coil), to match the resistance across the tuned circuit. In the [...] "two-slider" [...] circuit, popular during the wireless era, both the antenna and the detector circuit were attached to the coil with sliding contacts, allowing (interactive) adjustment of both the resonant frequency and the turns ratio. Alternatively a multiposition switch was used to select taps on the coil. These controls were adjusted until the station sounded loudest in the earphone.|$|E

50|$|Although a {{resonant}} antenna has {{a purely}} resistive feed-point impedance {{at a particular}} frequency, many (if not most) applications require using an antenna over a range of frequencies.
