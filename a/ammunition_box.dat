25|$|On 8 February Linzee ordered Juno and Fortitude under Captain William Young to bombard the Torra di Mortella {{from the}} sea while {{engineers}} under Lieutenant-Colonel John Moore hauled cannon up the steep hills that overlooked the fortification. The British fire had little impact on the tower, and heated shot from the tower's two 18-pounder long guns ignited an <b>ammunition</b> <b>box</b> on board Fortitude which exploded, killing six sailors and wounding 56. Serious damage was done to the ship's mainmast and rigging and Young was forced to withdraw.|$|E
500|$|Many {{of these}} changes were made to {{aircraft}} before Pe-3bis production resumed in April 1942 and combat-use revealed several additional problems {{that had to be}} addressed in a second Pe-3bis prototype, which began its State acceptance tests in May 1942. Reloading the nose guns proved to be time-consuming, taking up to 45minutes, and the night-firing of the port-side UBK continued to blind the pilot. These problems prompted the transfer of both UBK guns to the wing center section where they were installed in a compartment that was hinged at the front to drop down and allow easier access to the guns and their ammunition. The starboard gun was given 230rounds and the port gun had 265rounds. This change reduced the capacity of the Nr. 7fuel tank by , but an asbestos bulkhead was added to protect the tank from heat generated by the guns. The changes meant that the cartridge cases from the ShVAK cannon could not be collected, making the skin and lower fuselage vulnerable. These were reinforced with steel sheets to minimize the damage inflicted by the large-caliber cases. The original mounting for the dorsal UBT machine gun provided an excellent field of fire, but lack of aerodynamic balance prevented the gunner/navigator to use its full range. Pressure exerted by the airstream prevented the gunner from traversing more than about 40–50° from the centerline. A twin-petal compensator proved mostly ineffective. The crash pylon was removed to give the gunner more working space. The <b>ammunition</b> <b>box</b> of the UBT was too small, only 30rounds, and took about a minute to reload. The boxes were deleted and the UBT was given a 200-round belt with an electric drive to help to prevent feed problems. An anti-icing system was added for the propellers and the pilot's windscreen. The nose glazing was replaced entirely and the crew's armor was increased to a total weight of [...] These changes moved the aircraft's center of gravity forward and the landing gear struts were lengthened, moving the wheels [...] forward, which helped to reduce the chance of the aircraft tipping over.|$|E
2500|$|The M23 system {{provides}} a pintle mount at both main cabin doors for an M60D 7.62×51mm machine gun, with the weapon feeding from either a standard <b>ammunition</b> <b>box</b> or a larger purpose built box {{connected to the}} mount. [...] The M23 is specifically designed for long fuselage UH-1s (UH-1D/H/N).|$|E
50|$|Not all <b>ammunition</b> <b>boxes</b> are metal, however. Wood and {{cardboard}} have also historically {{been used as}} a method of packaging and storing ammunition. Some enthusiasts and investors collect historical <b>ammunition</b> <b>boxes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Due {{to their}} durable construction, used metal <b>ammunition</b> <b>boxes</b> are popularly re-used for general storage and other purposes. Used <b>ammunition</b> <b>boxes</b> have lead and {{propellant}} residue inside, {{so they should}} not be used to store food or drink. Commercially made new or fully reconditioned used cans do not have this problem. Used boxes are often sold at military surplus stores.|$|R
50|$|Filling {{factories}} had a {{large number}} of buildings. Buildings were needed on the various Groups for filling of munitions. Explosives magazines were required by each Group to store the incoming explosive materials and to store the outgoing filled shells or gun cartridges, usually packed in <b>ammunition</b> <b>boxes.</b> Storage buildings were also needed on each Group to store the incoming empty shells and the empty <b>ammunition</b> <b>boxes.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Reason is a railgun in a rotary cannon {{configuration}} which fires {{depleted uranium}} flechettes. It is mounted to a large, wheeled <b>ammunition</b> <b>box</b> and {{is equipped with}} a harness for user comfort, a nuclear battery pack, and a water-cooled heat exchanger. The weapon, created by Ng, was still in beta testing, and suffers a software crash during a battle, resulting in the death of its user. Hiro is later able to apply a firmware update, and uses it until its ammunition supply is depleted. It bears, in inscription on its nameplate, the Latin phrase Ultima Ratio Regum, [...] "the last argument of kings".|$|E
2500|$|England, meanwhile, {{finally was}} {{brought under control}} and stopped about four miles (6km) east of {{where she had been}} hit by the kamikaze. At 1920, Vigilance pulled {{alongside}} the burning destroyer escort to find heavy fires blazing from the forward mess hall, up through the wardroom, forward 20-millimeter clipping room, radio room, pilothouse and flying bridge. A bomb, carried by the [...] "Val" [...] that had crashed the ship, had exploded in the mess hall. It wiped out the entire forward fire and rescue party, blew out the port side of the officers' quarters, opened the main deck, and tumbled a [...] gun over the side. A , ready-service <b>ammunition</b> <b>box</b> had fallen into the burning mess hall, and ammunition was exploding.|$|E

60|$|Then came {{moments of}} bustle and confusion. There were {{eighteen}} men to man the six boats. Some were hooking on the falls, others casting off the lashings; boat-steerers appeared with boat-compasses and water-breakers, and boat-pullers with the lunch boxes. Hunters were staggering under {{two or three}} shotguns, a rifle and heavy <b>ammunition</b> <b>box,</b> {{all of which were}} soon stowed away with their oilskins and mittens in the boats.|$|E
6000|$|Before Henry could {{recover from}} his bewilderment {{it was all}} over, and the soldier lay flat on his back, for in going over his head had struck on a sharp rock, {{rendering}} him unconscious.

60|$|Just as {{daylight}} laid its steel-gray {{fingers on}} the parchment window, Jacob Kent awoke. Turning on his elbow, he raised the lid and peered into the <b>ammunition</b> <b>box.</b> Whatever he saw, or whatever he did not see, exercised a very peculiar effect upon him, considering his neurotic temperament. He glanced at the sleeping man on the floor, let the lid down gently, and rolled over on his back. It was an unwonted calm that rested on his face. Not a muscle quivered. There was not the least sign of excitement or perturbation. He lay there a long while, thinking, {{and when he got}} up and began to move about, it was in a cool, collected manner, without noise and without hurry.|$|E
60|$|From under clefts {{among the}} rocks I {{gathered}} a few dry sticks and chips. These I whittled into shavings or split into kindling. From my note-book I tore out a page, {{and from the}} <b>ammunition</b> <b>box</b> took a shot-gun shell. Removing the wads from the latter with my knife, I emptied the powder on a flat rock. Next I pried the primer, or cap, from the shell, {{and laid it on}} the rock, {{in the midst of the}} scattered powder. All was ready. Maud still watched from the tent. Holding the paper in my left hand, I smashed down upon the cap with a rock held in my right. There was a puff of white smoke, a burst of flame, and the rough edge of the paper was alight.|$|E
60|$|Kent was {{so nervous}} that it took three puffs to blow out the slush-lamp, and he crawled into his {{blankets}} without even removing his moccasins. The sailor was soon snoring lustily from his hard bed on the floor, but Kent lay staring up into the blackness, {{one hand on the}} shotgun, resolved not to close his eyes the whole night. He had not had an opportunity to secrete his five pounds of gold, and it lay in the <b>ammunition</b> <b>box</b> at the head of his bunk. But, try as he would, he at last dozed off with the weight of his dust heavy on his soul. Had he not inadvertently fallen asleep with his mind in such condition, the somnambulic demon would not have been invoked, nor would Jim Cardegee have gone mining next day with a dish-pan.|$|E

60|$|The fire {{fought a}} losing battle, {{and at last}} died away, while the frost {{penetrated}} the mossy chinks between the logs and chilled the inner atmosphere. The dogs outside ceased their howling, and, curled up in the snow, dreamed of salmon-stocked heavens where dog-drivers and kindred task-masters were not. Within, the sailor lay like a log, while his host tossed restlessly about, the victim of strange fantasies. As midnight drew near he suddenly threw off the blankets and got up. It was remarkable {{that he could do}} what he then did without ever striking a light. Perhaps {{it was because of the}} darkness that he kept his eyes shut, and perhaps it was for fear he would see the terrible gash on the cheek of his visitor; but, be this as it may, it is a fact that, unseeing, he opened his <b>ammunition</b> <b>box,</b> put a heavy charge into the muzzle of the shotgun without spilling a particle, rammed it down with double wads, and then put everything away and got back into bed.|$|E

25|$|The initial view, {{reported}} by Horace Smith-Dorrien, {{was that the}} British had difficulty unpacking their <b>ammunition</b> <b>boxes</b> fast enough and that the quartermasters were reluctant to distribute ammunition to units other than their own.
