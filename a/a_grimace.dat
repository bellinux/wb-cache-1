500|$|Sparty {{appears in}} several other incarnations. In printed literature, the {{university}} uses a copyrighted cartoon Spartan, usually drawn with <b>a</b> <b>grimace</b> and several days worth of whiskers, lending the nickname of [...] "Gruff" [...] Sparty. Finally, Sparty appears as a foam rubber mascot with an oversized head. The mascot costume, worn by an anonymous student, appears at most university sporting, alumni, and fundraising events; he is often portrayed in MSU notices and materials.|$|E
2500|$|The doctor's [...] "sensitive face", which Van Gogh {{wrote to}} Paul Gauguin carried [...] "the heartbroken {{expression}} of our time", {{is described by}} Robert Wallace as the portrait's focus. Wallace described the ultramarine blue coat of Gachet, set {{against a background of}} hills painted a lighter blue, as highlighting the [...] "tired, pale features and transparent blue eyes that reflect the compassion and melancholy of the man." [...] Van Gogh himself said this expression of melancholy [...] "would seem to look like <b>a</b> <b>grimace</b> to many who saw the canvas".|$|E
2500|$|At the Spring Salon of 1921, Gecan {{exhibited}} the painting [...] "Cinik" [...] (The Cynic), {{which is now}} considered the most important work of Croatian Expressionist painting. This image derives from cubist and expressionist styles, symbolizing {{the world as a}} stage, and marked deformation of character. A young man in a red suit and bow tie sits at an oversized table with a shifted perspective that is tilted towards the viewer. He is reading Der Sturm, a newspaper that was known to promote expressionist art. The man in the picture is Gecan himself, who at the time was 27 years old. He looks cramped and awkward, the body language suggesting some inner turmoil, while the facial expression is <b>a</b> <b>grimace.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Eye {{opening in}} {{response}} to pain stimulus. (a peripheral pain stimulus, such as squeezing the lunula area of the patient's fingernail {{is more effective than}} a central stimulus such as a trapezius squeeze, due to <b>a</b> <b>grimacing</b> effect).|$|R
2500|$|A flat, carved stone, {{designated}} Monument 3, {{was placed}} as a doorstep to the ceremonial structure (Price and Feinman 2005, p.321). The carving is {{of a naked}} man with [...] "a puffy, slitted eye, lips drawn back in <b>a</b> <b>grimace,</b> overall posture of vulnerability [...] [...] [...] rounded elements on the chest and abdomen suggesting the guts after disembowlment." [...] Glyphs depict drops of blood and a possible calendar day-name [...] "1 Earthquake." [...] These are the earliest Zapotec glyphs known to exist. [...] While personal bloodletting was suggested by the stingray spines and similar objects made of obsidian or jade, the figure depicted on Monument 3 shows sacrifice of a victim, probably a captive, on a societal level. In a later time period, monuments carved with similar figures, called danzantes (dancers), were present at Monte Albán.|$|E
2500|$|On October 29, 1936, the Spanish Republican Army {{launched}} {{an attack against}} the Nationalist-held town of Seseña. The Republicans attacked with a force of 15 T-26 tanks, armed with a 45mm cannon, led by a Lithuanian tank specialist, Captain Paul Arman, and driven by Russians with Spanish gunners, and the 1st Mixed Brigade, a newly established mixed brigade led by Enrique Líster. Opposing them, the Nationalists had a force of cavalry led by colonel Monasterio, Moroccan regulares and some Italian tankettes. The Russian tanks were mased together for a shock attack and entered in Seseña. Arman claimed that the Soviet tanks destroyed two infantry battalions, two cavalry squadrons, ten 75mm guns, two tankettes and 20-30 trucks. The tanks crossed Seseña and reached Esquivias, nevertheless, the Mixed Brigade of Lister never entered into {{the town and the}} tank force had to retreat. Mikhail Koltsov, a Russian journalist at Seseña said: [...] "Lister...explained, <b>a</b> <b>grimace</b> upon his face, that his units, had been moving well at first, but after 1,500 metres, they had felt tired and sat down...". Furthermore, the Nationalists managed to knock out three Russian tanks with Molotov cocktails. The same day, the Republican army, led by colonel Ildefonso Puigdendolas, {{launched an}}other assault against the near town of Illescas, but the attack failed and Puigdendolas died.|$|E
