Methods We collected and analysed individual based data regarding the <b>acquisition</b> <b>cost</b> of dispensed prescription drugs for all individuals with five or more dispensed drugs (DPÂ >=Â  5) in Sweden 2006 (2. 2 million). Results Individuals with DPÂ >=Â  5 (24. 5 % of the population) accounted for 78. 8 % of the total <b>acquisition</b> <b>cost,</b> and individuals with DPÂ >=Â  10 (8. 6 % of the population) and DPÂ >=Â  15 (3. 0 % of the population) accounted for 46. 3 % and 23. 2 %, respectively. The average <b>acquisition</b> <b>cost</b> per defined daily doses (DDD) generally decreased with increasing age. The highest average cost per DDD was observed for individuals with DPÂ >=Â  10.

We ask how the sale of forest carbon offsets could reduce land <b>acquisition</b> <b>costs,</b> and how the alternate goals of maximizing a or b-diversity in focal communities could affect the prioritization land parcels over a range of conservation targets. Maximizing total carbon storage and carbon sequestration potential reduced land <b>acquisition</b> <b>costs</b> by up to 48 %. Maximizing b rather than a-diversity within forest and savannah bird communities reduced <b>acquisition</b> <b>costs</b> by up to 15 %, and when these solutions included potential carbon credit revenues, <b>acquisition</b> <b>cost</b> reductions up to 32 % were achieved. However, the total cost of conservation networks increased exponentially as area targets increased in all scenarios. Our results indicate that carbon credit sales have the potential to enhance conservation outcomes in human-dominated landscapes by reducing the net <b>acquisition</b> <b>costs</b> of land conservation in old and maturing forests essential for the persistence of old forest plant and animal communities. Maximizing b versus a-diversity may further reduce costs by reducing the total area required to meet conservation targets and enhancing landscape heterogeneity. Although the potential value of carbon credit sales declined as a fraction of total <b>acquisition</b> <b>costs,</b> even conservative scenarios using a carbon credit value of $ 12. 5 /T suggest reductions in <b>acquisition</b> <b>cost</b> of up to $ 235 M, indicating that carbon credit sales could substantially reduce the costs of conservation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Patients' non-adherence to {{drug therapy}} {{is a major}} problem for society as it is {{associated}} with reduced health outcomes. Generally, approximately only 50 % of patients with chronic disease in developed countries adhere to prescribed therapy, and the most common non-adherence refers to chronic under-use, i. e. patients use less medication than prescribed or prematurely stop the therapy. Patients' non-adherence leads to high additional costs for society in terms of poor health. Non-adherence is also related to the unnecessary sale of drugs. The aim {{of the present study was}} to estimate the drug <b>acquisition</b> <b>cost</b> related to non-adherence to drug therapy in a national population. Methods We constructed a model of the drug <b>acquisition</b> <b>cost</b> related to non-adherence to drug therapy based on patient register data of dispensed out-patient prescriptions in the entire Swedish population during a 12 -month period. In the model, the total drug <b>acquisition</b> <b>cost</b> was successively adjusted for the assumed different rates of primary non-adherence (prescriptions not being filled by the patient), and secondary non-adherence (medication not being taken as prescribed) according to the patient's age, therapies, and the number of dispensed drugs per patient. Results With an assumption of a general primary non-adherence rate of 3 %, and a general secondary non-adherence rate of 50 %, for all types of drugs, the <b>acquisition</b> <b>cost</b> related to non-adherence totalled SEK 11. 2 billion (€ 1. 2 billion), or 48. 5 % of total drug <b>acquisition</b> <b>costs</b> in Sweden 2006. With the assumption of varying primary non-adherence rates for different age groups and different secondary non-adherence rates for varying types of drug therapies, the <b>acquisition</b> <b>cost</b> related to non-adherence totalled SEK 9. 3 billion (€ 1. 0 billion), or 40. 2 % of the total drug <b>acquisition</b> <b>costs.</b> When the assumption of varying primary and secondary non-adherence rates for a different number of dispensed drugs per patient was added to the model, the <b>acquisition</b> <b>cost</b> related to non-adherence totalled SEK 9. 9 billion (€ 1. 1 billion), or 42. 6 % of the total drug <b>acquisition</b> <b>costs.</b> Conclusions Our estimate indicates that drug <b>acquisition</b> <b>costs</b> related to non-adherence represent a substantial proportion of the economic resources in the health care sector. A low rate of primary non-adherence, combined with a high rate of secondary non-adherence, contributes to a large degree of unnecessary medical spending. Thus, efforts of different types of interventions are needed to improve secondary adherence. </p...|$|R

This article studies auction design when information <b>acquisition</b> <b>costs</b> are private information of bidders. We show that this problem can be resolved by sufficient dispersion in these costs. First, we find that a simple second-price auction with no entry fee and a reserve price equal to the seller's valuation is ex ante efficient, while a revenue-maximizing auction involves personalized entry fees, which {{are determined by the}} hazard rates of their information <b>acquisition</b> <b>cost</b> distribution. Second, we show that sufficient dispersion in the information <b>acquisition</b> <b>costs</b> (more dispersion than a particular uniform distribution by the Bickel-Lehman dispersive order) can coordinate bidders and implement uniquely the desirable entry. The dispersion in information <b>acquisition</b> <b>costs</b> is also necessary for this "unique implementation" result.

40|$|One of the {{hallmarks}} of the human species is our capacity for cumulative culture, in which beneficial knowledge and technology is accumulated over successive generations. Yet previous analyses of cumulative cultural change have failed to consider the possibility that as cultural complexity accumulates, it becomes increasingly costly for each new generation to acquire from the previous generation. In principle this may result in an upper limit on the cultural complexity that can be accumulated, at which point accumulated knowledge is so costly and time-consuming to acquire that further innovation is not possible. In this paper I first review existing empirical analyses of the history of science and technology that support the possibility that cultural <b>acquisition</b> <b>costs</b> may constrain cumulative cultural evolution. I then present macroscopic and individual-based models of cumulative cultural evolution that explore the consequences of this assumption of variable cultural <b>acquisition</b> <b>costs,</b> showing that making <b>acquisition</b> <b>costs</b> vary with cultural complexity causes the latter to reach an upper limit above which no further innovation can occur.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the selling process of private equity offering. We begin {{by looking at}} the pricing and the allocation decision faced by a firm trying to sell private equity claims and find out the optimal pricing and allocation mechanism of the issuer in order to maximize his proceeds. We are able to confirm in the model that some publicized results for public offerings should also hold for private placements; per share discount should decrease in issue size and increase as the information <b>acquisition</b> <b>cost</b> and the value of private information increase. Our model suggests that for firms which receive favorable private information from investors prior to the issue, both the value of private information and the information <b>acquisition</b> <b>cost</b> should affect the discount level. However, for firms receiving unfavorable information, only the information <b>acquisition</b> <b>cost</b> should be the driving force of the discount level. We also show in the model that the value of private information has greater impact in determining the discount level in private offerings compared to public offerings. However, the information <b>acquisition</b> <b>cost</b> has bigger effect on determining the discount level in public offerings than in private placements...|$|R

The error terms of the selection equation and the two cost equations follow a trivariate normal distribution to reflect co-dependence on unobserved factors (such as a land owner's tenacity or a site's view value). When applied to the properties acquired across the state of Texas for transportation probjects between 2008 and 2011, results of this switching regression model suggest that R/W appraisers and staff should {{pay special attention to}} parcels in commercial use involving a partial taking with a relatively small remainder and located in more urbanized areas.
