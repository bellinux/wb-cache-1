25|$|Pigs are unusual as {{they can}} be {{infected}} with influenza strains that usually infect three different species: pigs, birds and humans. This makes pigs a host where influenza viruses might exchange genes, producing new and dangerous strains. Avian influenza virus H3N2 is endemic in pigs in China, and has been detected in pigs in Vietnam, increasing fears of the emergence of new variant strains. H3N2 evolved from H2N2 by <b>antigenic</b> <b>shift.</b> In August 2004, researchers in China found H5N1 in pigs.|$|E
25|$|Previously it {{has been}} thought that the virus does not undergo cross species infection. However studies in Vietnam have shown that CPV2 can undergo minor <b>antigenic</b> <b>shift</b> and natural {{mutation}} to infect felids. Analyses of feline parvovirus (FPV) isolates in Vietnam and Taiwan revealed that more than 80% of the isolates were of the canine parvovirus type, rather than feline panleukopenia virus (FPLV). CPV2 may spread to cats easier than dogs and undergo faster rates of mutation within that species.|$|E
25|$|Influenza B {{virus is}} almost {{exclusively}} a human pathogen, and is less common than influenza A. The only other animal {{known to be}} susceptible to influenza B infection is the seal. This type of influenza mutates at a rate 2–3 times lower than type A and consequently is less genetically diverse, with only one influenza B serotype. As {{a result of this}} lack of antigenic diversity, a degree of immunity to influenza B is usually acquired at an early age. However, influenza B mutates enough that lasting immunity is not possible. This reduced rate of antigenic change, combined with its limited host range (inhibiting cross species <b>antigenic</b> <b>shift),</b> ensures that pandemics of influenza B do not occur.|$|E

25|$|Since RNA {{proofreading}} enzymes are absent, the RNA-dependent RNA transcriptase makes {{a single}} nucleotide insertion error roughly every 10 thousand nucleotides, {{which is the}} approximate length of the influenza vRNA. Hence, nearly every newly manufactured influenza virus will contain a mutation in its genome. The separation of the genome into eight separate segments of vRNA allows mixing (reassortment) of the genes if more than one variety of influenza virus has infected the same cell (superinfection). The resulting alteration in the genome segments packaged into viral progeny confers new behavior, sometimes the ability to infect new host species or to overcome protective immunity of host populations to its old genome (in which case it is called an <b>antigenic</b> <b>shift).</b>|$|E
25|$|Viruses in the Paramyxoviridae {{family are}} also antigenically stable, {{meaning that the}} glycoproteins on the viruses are {{consistent}} between different strains of the same type. There are two reasons for this phenomenon. The first is that the genome is non-segmented and thus cannot undergo genetic reassortment. In order for this process to occur, segments are needed as reassortment happens when segments from different strains are mixed {{together to create a}} new strain. With no segments, nothing can be mixed with one another and so there is no <b>antigenic</b> <b>shift.</b> The second reason relates to the idea of antigenic drift. Since RNA dependent RNA polymerase does not have an error checking function, many mutations are made when the RNA is processed. These mutations build up and eventually new strains are created. Due to this concept, one would expect that paramyxoviruses should not be antigenically stable; however, the opposite is seen to be true. The main hypothesis behind why the viruses are antigenically stable is that each protein and amino acid has an important function. Thus, any mutation would lead to a decrease or total loss of function, which would in turn cause the new virus to be less efficient. These viruses {{would not be able to}} survive as long compared to the more virulent strains, and so would die out.|$|E
500|$|Not all virus infections {{produce a}} {{protective}} immune response in this way. HIV evades the immune system by constantly changing the amino acid sequence of the proteins {{on the surface of}} the virion. This is known as [...] "escape mutation" [...] as the viral epitopes escape recognition by the host immune response. These persistent viruses evade immune control by sequestration, blockade of antigen presentation, cytokine resistance, evasion of natural killer cell activities, escape from apoptosis, and <b>antigenic</b> <b>shift.</b> Other viruses, called neurotropic viruses, are disseminated by neural spread where the immune system may be unable to reach them.|$|E
40|$|It is of huge {{concern the}} {{possibility}} {{that at some point}} in the future we may face a new pandemic involving a highly pathogenic virus due to our current preventive and treatment options to fight this viral disease. The main reason for such limitations is the ability of the virus to go over constant <b>antigenic</b> <b>shifts</b> and drifts on its viral surface proteins HA and NA. The constant mutations that affect this virus cause the need of developing new vaccines for each influenza season. Periodically, the World Health Organization (WHO) reports that around 10...|$|R

5000|$|The {{host range}} of a {{parasite}} is the collection of hosts that an organism can utilize as a partner. In the case of human parasites, the host range influences the epidemiology of the parasitism or disease. For instance, the production of <b>antigenic</b> <b>shifts</b> in Influenza A virus can result from pigs being infected with the virus from several different hosts (such as human and bird). This co-infection {{provides an opportunity for}} mixing of the viral genes between existing strains, thereby producing a new viral strain.

500|$|Viruses undergo genetic {{change by}} several mechanisms. These include {{a process called}} {{antigenic}} drift where individual bases in the DNA or RNA mutate to other bases. Most of these point mutations are [...] "silent"– they do not change the protein that the gene encodes– but others can confer evolutionary advantages such as resistance to antiviral drugs. <b>Antigenic</b> <b>shift</b> occurs {{when there is a}} major change in the genome of the virus. This can be a result of recombination or reassortment. When this happens with influenza viruses, pandemics might result. RNA viruses often exist as quasispecies or swarms of viruses of the same species but with slightly different genome nucleoside sequences.

50|$|Because of {{the absence}} of RNA {{proofreading}} enzymes, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that copies the viral genome makes an error roughly every 10 thousand nucleotides, which is the approximate length of the influenza vRNA. Hence, the majority of newly manufactured influenza viruses are mutants; this causes antigenic drift, which is a slow change in the antigens on the viral surface over time. The separation of the genome into eight separate segments of vRNA allows mixing or reassortment of vRNAs if more than one type of influenza virus infects a single cell. The resulting rapid change in viral genetics produces <b>antigenic</b> <b>shifts,</b> which are sudden changes from one antigen to another. These sudden large changes allow the virus to infect new host species and quickly overcome protective immunity. This is important in the emergence of pandemics, as discussed below in the section on Epidemiology.|$|R

In this regard, responding to the current pandemic and preparing for future ones requires critical planning for the early phases where there is no availability of pandemic vaccine with rapid deployment of medical supplies for personal protection, antivirals, antibiotics and social distancing measures. In addition, it has become clear that responding to the current pandemic or preparing for future ones, nation states need to develop or strengthen their laboratory capability for influenza diagnosis as well as begin preparing their vaccine/antiviral deployment plans. Vaccine deployment plans are the critical missing link in pandemic preparedness and response. Rapid containment efforts are not effective and instead mitigation efforts should lead pandemic control efforts.

2500|$|Herd {{immunity}} itself acts as {{an evolutionary}} pressure on certain viruses, influencing viral evolution by encouraging the production of novel strains, in this case referred to as escape mutants, {{that are able to}} [...] "escape" [...] from herd immunity and spread more easily. At the molecular level, viruses escape from herd immunity through antigenic drift, which is when mutations accumulate in the portion of the viral genome that encodes for the virus's surface antigen, typically a protein of the virus capsid, producing a change in the viral epitope. Alternatively, the reassortment of separate viral genome segments, or <b>antigenic</b> <b>shift,</b> which is more common when there are more strains in circulation, can also produce new serotypes. When either of these occur, memory T cells no longer recognize the virus, so herd immunity ceases to be relevant to the dominant circulating strain. For both influenza and norovirus, epidemics temporarily induce herd immunity until a new dominant strain emerges, causing successive waves of epidemics. As this evolution poses a challenge to herd immunity, broadly neutralizing antibodies and [...] "universal" [...] vaccines that can provide protection beyond a specific serotype are in development.|$|E

Two proteins, the hemagglutinin (HA) and the neuraminidase (NA), project from the virus surface. Influenza viruses isolated from man have contained four distinct hemagglutinins and two distinct neurami-nidases.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile is a {{major cause}} of {{nosocomial}} diarrhea, with 30 -day mortality reaching 30 %. The cell surface comprises a paracrystalline proteinaceous S-layer encoded by the slpA gene within the cell wall protein (cwp) gene cluster. Our purpose was to understand the diversity and evolution of slpA and nearby genes also encoding immunodominant cell surface antigens. METHODS: Whole-genome sequences were determined for 57 C. difficile isolates representative of the population structure and different clinical phenotypes. Phylogenetic analyses were performed on their genomic region (> 63 kb) spanning the cwp cluster. RESULTS: Genetic diversity across the cwp cluster peaked within slpA, cwp 66 (adhesin), and secA 2 (secretory translocase). These genes formed a 10 -kb cassette, of which 12 divergent variants were found. Homologous recombination involving this cassette caused it to associate randomly with genotype. One cassette contained a novel insertion (length, approximately 24 kb) that resembled S-layer glycosylation gene clusters. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic exchange of S-layer cassettes parallels polysaccharide capsular switching in other species. Both cause major <b>antigenic</b> <b>shifts,</b> while the remainder of the genome is unchanged. C. difficile genotype is therefore not predictive of antigenic type. S-layer switching and immune escape could help explain temporal and geographic variation in C. difficile epidemiology and may inform genotyping and vaccination strategies...|$|R
