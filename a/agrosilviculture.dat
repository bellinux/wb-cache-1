30|$|There are {{six major}} forest types found in India {{consisting}} of 15 groups and other subgroups with peculiar characteristics. Methodologies used by researchers for biomass/carbon stock estimation are destructive, nondestructive, tree inventories data, species-specific biomass estimation, and remote sensing. Majority of estimates {{are based on}} nondestructive allometric equation approach. Studies showed positive correlation between tree species, diameter at breast height, and biomass/carbon stock. Small- and medium-sized growing trees, invasive species, mixed forest, Agroforestry, and <b>Agrosilviculture</b> also {{play an important role}} in atmospheric carbon assimilation. The results of diverse forest carbon stock studies are broadly categorized in North, Central, and Southern India. Present review will be helpful for developing conservation policies and decision to increase carbon stock and also REDD+ program for particular forest ecosystem.|$|E
40|$|The study {{purposes}} were {{to identify}} the socio-economic conditions of the community, the incomes of the farmers in agroforestry system and socio-economic factors in Lasiwala Village, Pitu Riase District, Sidrap Regency. This study was conducted from October-December 2006 in Lasiwala Village, Sidrap Regency. Data collected were direct observation {{in the field and}} interviews. The interviews were intended to obtain primary data from the respondents. Secondary data were gained from related institutions. Data were then analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively by using Chi Square (X 2) to acquire results which {{could be used as a}} basic in conclusion making. The results show that the farmers categorized in productive age, low education level, with family members of 2 - 6 persons, medium incomes and medium width of land. They also applied two system of agroforestry, <b>agrosilviculture</b> and agrosilvopastural. Factors that were not related with the incomes were age, education, number of family members, and experiences in agroforestry. Factors that had a close relationship with the incomes were land width and agroforestry system applied.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the socio-economic factors affecting farmers ’ decisions to adopt <b>agrosilviculture</b> in Turbo division, Uasin Gishu County. The {{study was conducted in}} four locations of Turbo division namely Sugoi, Tapsagoi, Kaptebee and Sosiani. The specific objectives of the study were to identify the socio- economical factors that affect adoption of agro-silviculture by farmers; to establish the effects of agro-silviculture on livelihood status of farmers; and to determine levels of awareness by farmers in implementation of agro-forestry projects. The study was based on a sample size of 160 farmer respondents from the four locations in the study area. Simple random sampling technique was used to select respondents. Both primary and secondary methods of data collection were used. Qualitative and quantitative data analysis procedures were used in analyzing the data. Quantitative data was analyzed using statistical package for social scientist, whereas qualitative data was cleaned and sorted according to the themes of the research. The significance of the study is that it will provide information for policy makers and the key government departments to enhance the adoption of agro-silviculture in Turbo division and other parts of Kenya. The results of the study revealed that farmers ’ adoption of agro-silviculture system is significantly affected by the age, gender, farmers ’ level of education, contact with extension staff, level of awareness and participation i...|$|E
40|$|Contains tables. High {{population}} density in Masaka district, Uganda, {{has led to}} increased pressure on land. This has resulted in reduced arable land and decreased soil fertility. In view of this, the Vi-Tree NGO Project has initiated a study to investigate the adoption of agroforestry systems by farmers in Masaka district with focus on the types of agroforestry systems practiced, incorporation of multipurpose tree and shrub species, crops grown, farm land size and land ownership, production and marketing problems, and the main items on which families expend money on. Data was collected using open-ended questionnaire interviews administered to 88 farmers randomly selected throughout the 22 subcounties of Masaka district. The results were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The findings showed that the main agroforestry systems practiced are agrosilvopasture, <b>agrosilviculture</b> and silviculture. The study revealed that 81 woody species (75 trees and 6 shrubs) are used. 69 % of these are indigenous. The most important families are Fabaceae, Moraceae, Euphorbiaceae, Combretaceae and Myrtaceae. Bananas, cassava, beans, vegetables, maize and coffee are the main crops grown. The majority of farmers hold small farm lands (1 - 3 acres). Primary production problems are pests and diseases while marketing problems are many including low prices, long distances from village to farm, lack of buyers and price fluctuations. The main items they spend money on are school fees, medicines, and essential commodities. The adoption of agroforestry systems by farmers is relatively high in Masaka district. This is probably due to high demand for land, soil fertility decline, erosion problems, and demand for woody products (e. g., timber, fuel wood, and fodder, food), contact with the Vi-Tree NGO Agroforestry Project extension agents, and need to increase crop yield. High levels of personal land ownership has probably contributed {{to the adoption of}} agroforestry systems to promote long-term production...|$|E
40|$|The Amazon Rain Forest has {{attracted}} worldwide attention due its large scale services to climate and also {{due to the}} green house gas emissions arising from deforestation. Contributing to the later and detrimental to the former, timber logging in the region has very low efficiency (only 16 % in the production chain). Such timber extraction, {{often referred to as}} selective logging, has been claimed as a sustainable extractive industry, because the forest is said to restore itself through regenerative growth. But forest regeneration in the Amazon occurs naturally only in a very limited scale, resulting that large scale, low efficiency logging poses a big treat to the functional integrity of the biome, supplying to the market only a fraction of what it could if done differently. So, instead of extracting big centennial logs from the forests, the Amazonian Phoenix project proposes that large expanses of degraded lands be reforested using pioneer plants species from the forest itself. These plants have the capacity to heal gaps in the canopy, being able to grow and produce woody biomass in very extreme conditions. The idea is to mimic the regenerative dynamics of the natural ecosystem in short cycle agrosilvicultural production areas, utilizing a variety of technologies to transform raw fibers from these fast growth native plants into a variety of materials with high aggregated value. This communication presents the research on natural fibers by the Polymeric Composites Group within the Amazonian Phoenix Project. Sustainable technologies employing materials with good and responsible ecological footprints are important and necessary stimulus for a change in the destructive economical activities present in the Amazon frontiers. The relatively well established wood polymer composites technology, for example, is a good candidate solution. Two research and development fields are proposed: the first one considers production systems with simple and cheap machinery, to facilitate technology assimilation by rural communities in the Amazon. The second one aims at developing composite materials with advanced production technology, like profile and sheet extrusion and injection molding. The source of the fibers would be both the short cycle <b>agrosilviculture</b> with softwood species, on already deforested lands, and the hardwood residues from operating sawmills. Preliminary results show that softwood fibers act as potentially important reinforcement for synthetic plastics. polymer-wood composites; native plant fibers; Amazonian forest...|$|E
