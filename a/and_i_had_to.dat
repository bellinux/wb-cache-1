So I felt like, well, I've finally got this thing going but it's dead. Flood <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> record Broken under a {{different}} band name, because if TVT found out we were recording, they could confiscate all our shit and release it. Jimmy Iovine got involved with Interscope, and we kind of got slave-traded. It wasn't my doing. I didn't know anything about Interscope. And I was real pissed off at him at first because it was going from one bad situation to potentially another one. But Interscope went into it like they really wanted to know what I wanted. It was good, after I put my raving lunatic act on.|$|E
25|$|It {{was at a}} meeting, {{just before}} the Six Day War. It was a meeting in New York, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> make a speech. Before that, the Holocaust had never been {{essential}} to my ideology. However, when the chairman said, 'You've got to face it,' I had to face it. I said {{the most important thing}} I ever said.|$|E
25|$|It was a set-up. The {{two other}} Board members cried off with feeble excuses <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> sit alone in judgment. I heard the case; found Chappell guilty as charged, and {{suspended}} him forthwith {{for a period}} of six weeks. I sent my report to the Board who did not back me up. Chappell's sentence was suspended. I had no other course of action than to see the season through and not re-nominate again.|$|E

25|$|Madhubala {{was quite}} another matter. I {{knew she was}} very sick even before I married her. But a promise is a promise. So I kept my word and brought her home as my wife, even though I knew she was dying from a {{congenital}} heart problem. For 9 long years I nursed her. I watched her die before my own eyes. You can never understand what this means until you live through this yourself. She was such a beautiful woman and she died so painfully. She would rave and rant and scream in frustration. How can such an active person spend 9 long years bed-ridden? <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> humour her all the time. That's what the doctor asked me to. That's what I did till her very last breath. I would laugh with her. I would cry with her.|$|E
25|$|I {{should be}} bitter, but I am not. Disappointed, yes, because {{after so many}} heartbreaks this was a rather {{ruthless}} end. I was the fall guy, the player who carried the ACB flag all summer against all the odds. I had to cop it sweet then, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> cop my dismissal the same way... We were lambs to the slaughter anyway. Besides or own cricketing shortcomings, we were forced o play on wickets that suited the Englishmen and were alien to us; we copped the bad end of umpiring decisions to a damning degree throughout the Ashes series and we were crucified by media in many quarters from beginning to end. All this, combined with the talented opposition which was expected to whitewash us anyway, was just too much. The hurt that remains is that I tried so hard, {{and so did the}} young, raw team that took on so much despite all the ods. My name is now eternally entrenched in the cords books as the man who led this country to that ignominious hiding against England.|$|E

500|$|Spielberg and Janusz Kamiński, who {{has shot}} {{all of the}} director's films since 1993's Schindler's List, {{reviewed}} the previous films to study Douglas Slocombe's style. [...] "I didn’t want Janusz to modernize and bring us into the 21st century", Spielberg explained. [...] "I still wanted the film to have a lighting style not dissimilar to the work Doug Slocombe had achieved, which meant that both Janusz <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> swallow our pride. Janusz had to approximate another cinematographer's look, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> approximate this younger director's look that I thought I had moved away from after almost two decades." [...] Spielberg also hired production designer Guy Hendrix Dyas after admiring his design work for Superman Returns. Spielberg {{did not want to}} fast cut action scenes, relying on his script instead for a fast pace, and had confirmed in 2002 that he would not shoot the film digitally, a format Lucas had adopted. Lucas felt [...] "it looks like it was shot three years after Last Crusade. The people, the look of it, everything. You’d never know there was 20 years between shooting." [...] Kamiński commented upon watching the three films back-to-back, he was amazed how each of them advanced technologically, but were all nevertheless consistent, neither too brightly or darkly lit.|$|E

500|$|In {{order to}} have one person fully {{understand}} and develop their own character, as well as later be able to impart that to the crew, the film's directors and producers decided to have character leads and supervising animators on specific characters. First-time character lead Becky Bresee serves as the supervising animator for Anna. She described her job as [...] "making the character more believable". To achieve this, she had to act out part of a sequence in the movie between Anna and Kristoff {{for a number of}} times, each of them emphasizing the character's gestures differently. [...] "Anna's a little bit nervous and uncomfortable, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> find a way to put that into the animation," [...] explained Bresee.|$|E

500|$|Beginning in {{the summer}} of 1997, Blink-182 would enter an {{extended}} period of touring to support their second studio album, Dude Ranch. The group had played a handful of dates on the Vans Warped Tour 1996, a lifestyle tour promoting skateboarding and punk rock music. However, upon Dude Ranch release and popularity, Blink-182 would play every date of the 1997 tour worldwide with the bands NOFX and Social Distortion. The group were gone from their hometown of San Diego for nearly nine months straight beginning in late 1997. [...] "When we did our longest tour stretch, it was right when I started dating my fiancee," [...] recalled vocalist/guitarist Tom DeLonge.

He said of her in 1968 that she was [...] "a walking encyclopedia.

She was completely methodical; we had time-tables for each subject, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do preparation, and so forth. She taught me to enjoy working hard, and to be thorough.

500|$|In 1991, L.A.P.D. {{recorded}} {{their second}} album, Who's Laughing Now. Released on May 3, 1991, {{it was their}} first full-length studio album, and consisted of eleven tracks. After they recorded the album, the group's lead vocalist, Pete Capra, left L.A.P.D. {{and was replaced by}} someone affectionately known by other band members as Corey. Bassist Arvizu wrote: [...] "Pete [...] was always doing amphetamines and stuff. He pretty much left just because of his drug abuse. So Munky , David , <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> start all over again." [...] The band later fired Corey after his behavior during an audition with producer Ross Robinson. While looking for a new singer, they heard Jonathan Davis singing for the alternative metal band Sexart. After the show, the remaining band members of L.A.P.D. asked him to join their band. Shortly after this, the band changed their name to Korn and added Brian Welch to the member line-up.|$|E
500|$|The duo {{met again}} in May 1992 at Oceanway Studios in Los Angeles to {{complete}} the orchestration of the song. Lubbock's arrangement was chosen for adding the final touches and the recording started. However, Madonna and Pettibone {{did not like the}} orchestra parts and wanted to redo the whole composition. The producer recalled, [...] "Madonna <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> change the whole arrangement, right there in the studio, with a full orchestra sitting there getting paid for taking up space—around $15,000 for three hours, $3000 for every half-hour over that. And of course, Lubbock was talking to two people who didn't know a C from a B natural. The pressure was on". So they stood near Pettibone's Mac and sang the notes, with Lubbock correcting them. The total recording was finished off in 2 hours and 58 minutes, thereby saving to pay the orchestra the extra fees. The last recording of the song was on Memorial Day where Madonna re-did the lead vocals and improved them. Together they did some final edits of the track and finished it.|$|E

Finn Jones, who was cast concurrently in the leading role for the upcoming television series Marvel's Iron Fist, spoke about his departure saying, [...] "I had been on Thrones for six years. It was yearly employment. Now I was at a crossroads <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> think of what the future is.

Eugene Simon also spoke about his learning of his departure, saying that the showrunners promised a [...] "huge scene" [...] for his character in the season finale, with Simon responding, [...] "for everything that you've done for the last six years, thank you.
