5|$|After the war, {{increased}} wartime {{manufacturing and}} industrial growth {{ushered in a}} new era of economic prosperity, and Indianapolis's population increased from 8,000 in 1850 to 45,000 at the end of 1864. A real-estate boom led to the establishment of new residential suburbs, but the city retained its slums. Indianapolis also experienced improvements to its public services, such as health care, utilities, street railways, <b>and</b> <b>public</b> <b>schools.</b> By 1880 Indianapolis was Indiana's commercial and industrial center. Construction for the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument began in 1888, in the center of downtown Indianapolis, after decades of discussion. The city's iconic monument was dedicated on May 15, 1902.|$|E
5|$|A few {{tropical}} cyclone warnings and watches were issued {{in anticipation of}} Fay's impact on Bermuda, <b>and</b> <b>public</b> <b>schools</b> were closed as a precaution. Despite its modest strength, Fay produced extensive damage on Bermuda. Winds gusting over 100mph (155km/h) clogged roadways with downed trees and utility poles, and left {{a majority of the}} island's electric customers without power. The terminal building at L.F. Wade International Airport was flooded after the storm compromised its roof and sprinkler system. Along the coast, the storm unmoored and destroyed numerous boats. Immediately after the hurricane, 200Bermuda Regiment soldiers were called to clear debris and assist in initial damage repairs. Cleanup efforts overlapped with preparations for the approach of the stronger Hurricane Gonzalo, which struck the island less than six days later and compounded the damage. Fay and Gonzalo marked the first recorded instance of two Bermuda hurricane landfalls in one season.|$|E

5|$|Hoosiers {{were divided}} about {{entering}} World War I. Before Germany resumed unrestricted submarine warfare {{and tried to}} enlist Mexico as a military ally in 1917, most Hoosiers wanted the U.S. to be neutral in the war. Support for Britain came from professions and businessmen. Opposition came from churchmen, women, farmers and Irish Catholics and German-American elements. They called for neutrality and strongly opposed going to war to rescue the British Empire. Influential Hoosiers who opposed involvement in the war included Democratic Senator John W. Kern, and Vice President Thomas R. Marshall. Supporters of military preparedness included James Whitcomb Riley and George Ade. Most of the opposition dissipated when the United States officially declared war against Germany in April 1917, but some teachers lost their jobs on suspicion of disloyalty, <b>and</b> <b>public</b> <b>schools</b> could no longer teach in German. Socialist leader Eugene V. Debs, from Terre Haute, went to federal prison for encouraging young men to evade the draft.|$|E

40|$|While an {{abundance}} of school choice literature focuses on student achievement outcomes, little {{has been done to}} determine the mechanisms involved in producing such outcomes. We present a comparative analysis of private <b>and</b> <b>public</b> <b>school</b> principals using data from the School and Staffing Survey (SASS) 2011 - 2012. We add to the literature by examining the differences in private <b>and</b> <b>public</b> <b>school</b> principals’ abilities to influence important decisions at their schools. We conclude that private schooling may have a systematic advantage over <b>public</b> <b>schooling</b> since private school leadership exhibits more autonomy in influencing relevant decisions...|$|R
40|$|Research on {{children}} 2 ̆ 7 s physical activity indicates that children {{may not be}} getting sufficient amounts of physical activity. Much of the research has utilized samples from <b>public</b> <b>schools</b> but {{little research has been}} done on the growing population of home school children. This series of studies examines the relationship among the psychosocial correlates of physical activity (Attraction to PA, Perceived Competence, and Parental Influence) between home <b>school</b> <b>and</b> <b>public</b> <b>school</b> children, <b>and</b> their levels and patterns of physical activity. Trends were found for the psychosocial correlates of physical activity, with <b>public</b> <b>school</b> children scoring higher on all three measures than home school children. The findings also indicate a difference in levels of physical activity, although the difference may depend on the assessment tool used to measure physical activity. It is also possible that home <b>school</b> <b>and</b> <b>public</b> <b>school</b> children engage in different types of activities, which may be more identifiable with either a self-report or objective measure. Additionally, the results indicate that Attraction to Physical Activity accounts for the greatest amount of variance in physical activity. This suggests that the more enjoyable the activity is for children, the more likely they may be to participate. It is difficult to draw definitive conclusions from these studies due to inherent differences that may exist between home <b>school</b> <b>and</b> <b>public</b> <b>school</b> parents, as well as the structure of the school day. Future studies should explore the differences that may exist between home <b>school</b> <b>and</b> <b>public</b> <b>school</b> parents, the typical day for home <b>school</b> <b>and</b> <b>public</b> <b>school</b> children, <b>and</b> explore additional correlates, such as motor skills...|$|R
