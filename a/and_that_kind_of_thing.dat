6000|$|... "Nothing of the sort," [...] said Mr. Brooke, {{smiling and}} rubbing his eye-glasses, but really {{blushing}} {{a little at}} the impeachment.

6000|$|... "I do so hate <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing," [...] said Lady Eustace, with righteous indignation; [...] "I {{used to hear}} a {{great deal}} about Government <b>and</b> all <b>that</b> when the affair was on between me and poor Lord Fawn, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> {{dishonesty}} always disgusted me.
