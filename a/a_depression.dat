5|$|A low {{pressure}} area that had developed over the northern Bay of Bengal the previous day concentrated into <b>a</b> <b>depression</b> early on June 29. The depression intensified as it moved to the northwest, becoming a deep depression shortly before it crossed the Orissa coast. After landfall the storm continued {{to move to the}} northwest, weakening to <b>a</b> <b>depression</b> again on July 2 over northeast Madhya Pradesh. It degenerated into a remnant low over central Uttar Pradesh during the evening on July 3.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of Henriette was not anticipated well in NHC Tropical Weather Outlooks.

5|$|Tropical Storm Ignacio formed {{first as}} <b>a</b> <b>depression</b> {{in an area}} of {{disturbed}} weather on August 17. Twelvehours later, it organized into a tropical storm. Its location of tropical cyclone formation was further north and west of where most East Pacific tropical cyclones develop. Steering currents pulled Ignacio north, where it encountered wind shear and cooler waters. Ignacio never intensified beyond 40mph (65km/h) and then was downgraded into <b>a</b> <b>depression</b> on August 18. It last transitioned into an extratropical cyclone 24 hours later. It was then absorbed by a cyclone associated with the remnants of Hurricane Guillermo.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>depression</b> {{formed in}} the {{northeast}} of the Bay of Bengal on during the morning of May 23 near the East Pakistan coast.

50|$|On October 7, the JTWC started {{monitoring}} {{a tropical}} disturbance that had developed {{in an area}} of low vertical windshear, about 750 km (465 mi) to the south of Hagåtña, Guam. Over {{the next couple of days}} the system gradually developed further while moving towards the west, before the JMA reported on October 9, that the disturbance had developed into <b>a</b> tropical <b>depression.</b> Early on October 10, the JTWC upgraded the system to <b>a</b> tropical <b>depression</b> designating as 23W, and the PAGASA also upgraded it to <b>a</b> tropical <b>depression</b> and named it Ramon. On October 11, the JMA and the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical storm and named it Banyan. Early on October 12, Banyan made landfall over Leyte, Philippines, and the JTWC downgraded it to <b>a</b> tropical <b>depression.</b> <b>A</b> half day later, the JMA also downgraded Banyan to <b>a</b> tropical <b>depression.</b> The system dissipated in the South China Sea, on October 16,.|$|R
5|$|A low {{pressure}} area moved to the west off the Burmese coast on July 5 and developed into <b>a</b> <b>depression</b> {{the next day in}} the north central Bay of Bengal. The depression intensified as it moved to the northwest, becoming a deep depression on July 7. The system made landfall on the Orissa coast during the morning of July 8 and rapidly degenerated into a broad area of {{low pressure}} overland. The remnant low moved north over western Bihar and it persisted there until July 12 when it was absorbed by the monsoon trough.|$|E
5|$|A low {{pressure}} area that developed in the Bay of Bengal passed over the southern Indian subcontinent and developed into <b>a</b> <b>depression</b> in the Arabian Sea off the southern Maharashtra coast on October 11. The depression did not develop as it drifted west, and it degenerated into an area of {{low pressure}} as it was approaching the Arabian Peninsula. The depression brought widespread rains to southern Maharashtra and Karnataka states, with 40mm (1.5in) of rain recorded in Karwar. Scattered heavy rain was also reported in the Laccadives.|$|E
5|$|According to RSMC New Delhi, Cyclone Agni {{developed}} into <b>a</b> <b>depression</b> at 1.5°N, {{which is the}} same latitude as where according to RSMC Tokyo, Tropical Storm Vamei formed during December 2001. However, according to RSMC La Reunion, the precursor low to Cyclone Agni moved into the Southern Hemisphere and became an anticyclone as it had kept its counter-clockwise circulation.|$|E
50|$|Like {{most of the}} {{tropical}} cyclones of the season, the sixty-sixth formed on September 11, around where Tropical Depression Fifty-Five had formed earlier in the season. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center began following the disturbance, which {{was out in the}} open Pacific Ocean. The disturbance was upgraded into <b>a</b> tropical <b>depression</b> on September 12. The depression progressed westward, with the Japan Meteorological Agency following suit as <b>a</b> tropical <b>depression.</b> <b>As</b> the <b>depression</b> became to make a curve towards Japan, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ceased tracking the depression.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> {{tropical}} <b>depression</b> {{formed on}} July 19. Later that day, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Fabio. Fabio headed generally west or northwestward. It entered the central Pacific as <b>a</b> tropical <b>depression,</b> and dissipated on July 24.|$|R
50|$|A low {{pressure}} area 220 km {{to the west of}} Yap developed into <b>a</b> tropical <b>depression</b> on April 6. It gradually developed as it moved to the west, becoming <b>a</b> strong <b>depression</b> with 55 km/h (35 mph) winds. It then began to accelerate to the northwest, becoming a minimal tropical storm as it did so. However, this northwards motion brought it into a region of increased shear, which weakened it back into <b>a</b> tropical <b>depression.</b> The low level circulation became completely exposed and the weakening system made landfall on southern Luzon on April 10. PAGASA named the system Karing and considered it <b>a</b> tropical <b>depression.</b>|$|R
5|$|An area of {{convection}} {{acquired a}} closed circulation and became Tropical Depression One-C on August 22. It stayed disorganized {{for the next}} several days. It organized more fully and intensified into a tropical storm on August 25 and was named Alika. After peaking as a moderately strong tropical storm on August 25, wind shear caused by the pre-Ele tropical depression and an upper-level low near Hawaii weakened the storm to <b>a</b> <b>depression</b> on August 27. Alika dissipated the next day, having never threatened land.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the fifth}} week, {{there is an}} opening in the fetal heart known as the foramen ovale. The foramen ovale allowed blood in the fetal heart to pass {{directly}} from the right atrium to the left atrium, allowing some blood to bypass the lungs. Within seconds after birth, a flap of tissue known as the septum primum that previously acted as a valve closes the foramen ovale and establishes the typical cardiac circulation pattern. <b>A</b> <b>depression</b> in the surface of the right atrium remains where the foramen ovale once walls, called the fossa ovalis.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though it}} had {{weakened}} to <b>a</b> <b>depression</b> when it moved inland, Cindy's effects were still significant across the final portion of its track. The day after its landfall in southeastern Louisiana, Tropical Depression Cindy reached central Alabama. There its rainbands produced heavy rainfall and eight tornadoes. Damage was mostly limited to trees and powerlines, but an F1 tornado in Macon county injured one man, destroyed an auto-repair shop, and damaged several nearby cars. About 35,000 residences in Alabama and 7,000 in both Florida and Mississippi were left without power following the storm.|$|E
5000|$|Like the Long Depression {{that preceded}} it, the Depression of 1882-85 {{was more of}} <b>a</b> price <b>depression</b> than <b>a</b> {{production}} <b>depression</b> — in that prices and wage rates contracted while gross output remained more or less constant.|$|R
50|$|In {{a cardiac}} stress test, <b>an</b> ST <b>depression</b> {{of at least}} 1 mm after {{adenosine}} administration indicates a reversible ischaemia, while an exercise stress test requires <b>an</b> ST <b>depression</b> of at least 2 mm to significantly indicate reversible ischaemia.|$|R
40|$|We {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} {{the relationship between the}} presence and severity of depression and the degree of motor and functional disability in Parkinson's disease (PD). Methods: One hundred twenty-two outpatients with PD were enrolled in a neurology department: 65 satisfied the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder, Fourth Edition criteria for major depression, and 57 did not (PD-C). Depressive symptoms were assessed by means of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), and the PD severity was assessed according to the Hoehn and Yahr System. Activities of daily living and motor symptoms were measured by the Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS), parts II and III. Results: Twenty-nine patients had <b>a</b> mild <b>depression</b> (HRSD total score ranging between 8 and 17), 30 had <b>a</b> moderate <b>depression</b> (HRSD total score ranging between 18 and 24), and 6 had <b>a</b> severe <b>depression</b> (HRSD total score, ≥ 25). By comparing the 3 groups of patients, it emerged that those with <b>a</b> severe <b>depression</b> showed significantly higher scores at the UPDRS II, UPDRS III, and HY scales than did PD-C or patients with <b>a</b> mild <b>depression.</b> Moreover, patients with <b>a</b> moderate <b>depression</b> scored significantly higher on the UPDRS II, UPDRS III, and HY scales than did PD-C or those with <b>a</b> mild <b>depression.</b> Conclusions: Our findings suggest that depression and motor symptoms/well-being are highly intertwined in patients with P...|$|R
5|$|Hurricane Bob {{originated}} from {{the remnants of}} a frontal trough to the southeast of Bermuda on August12. The system tracked towards the southwest and later west towards the Bahamas. By August15th, satellite analysis of the system found a weak low pressure area a couple hundred miles east of the Bahamas. Operationally, the system was not declared a tropical depression until 0600UTC on August16 after a reconnaissance mission into the storm found a closed circulation and flight level winds of 37mph (60km/h). After post-storm analysis, it was determined that the low had developed into <b>a</b> <b>depression</b> around 0000UTC. Several hours after being designated, the system began to develop convective banding features. Roughly 18hours after being declared <b>a</b> <b>depression,</b> the National Hurricane Center (NHC) upgraded it to a tropical storm, giving it the name Bob. At this time, Bob was situated roughly 140mi (225km) northeast of Nassau, Bahamas. The storm tracked slowly towards the northwest in response to the deep layer mean flow it was embedded within.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Gert {{was a large}} {{tropical}} cyclone that caused extensive flooding and mudslides throughout Central America and Mexico in September1993. The seventh named storm and third hurricane of the annual hurricane season, Gert originated as a tropical depression from a tropical wave over the southwestern Caribbean Sea on September14. The next day, the cyclone briefly attained tropical storm strength before moving ashore in Nicaragua and proceeding through Honduras. It reorganized into a tropical storm over the Gulf of Honduras on September17, but weakened back to <b>a</b> <b>depression</b> upon crossing the Yucatán Peninsula. Once over the warm waters of the Bay of Campeche, Gert quickly strengthened into a Category2 hurricane by September20. The hurricane made a final landfall on the Gulf Coast of Mexico near Tuxpan, Veracruz, with peak winds of 105mph (165km/h). The rugged terrain disrupted the cyclone's structure; Gert entered the Pacific Ocean as <b>a</b> <b>depression</b> near the state of Nayarit on September21, where it briefly redeveloped a few strong thunderstorms before dissipating at sea five days later.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, {{while he}} was in command of the Duchess of York, his wife {{suddenly}} died in Toxteth. This event is said to have changed Stuart's demeanour and plunged him into <b>a</b> <b>depression.</b> He never again took time off work and left his children to the sole care and maintenance of his four maiden sisters in England. In 1934 he took over his last and most important seagoing role as Commodore of the CPS fleet and was placed in command of the 42,000-ton liner RMS Empress of Britain on her transatlantic route.|$|E

5|$|In early November 1995, {{the monsoon}} trough was active across the Bay of Bengal, with several {{associated}} circulations. A disturbance near the Andaman Islands {{became the focus}} of the overall system on November6. Located south of the subtropical ridge, the system moved to the west-northwest. Based on the improved organization, the JTWC issued a tropical cyclone formation alert late on November6, and at 00:00UTC the next day initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 03B just west of the Andaman Islands. Six hours later, the IMD likewise classified the system as <b>a</b> <b>depression.</b>|$|E
5|$|Incapillo is a Pleistocene caldera, <b>a</b> <b>depression</b> {{formed by}} the {{collapse}} of a volcano, in the La Rioja province of Argentina.
