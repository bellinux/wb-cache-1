[...] "That's as big a stage <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> on.... it's {{going to be a}} lot of fun." [...] He had his friend and agent, Nez Balelo, a former minor league infielder, pitch to him. [...] Braun's longest homer was estimated at 448 feet.

[...] I would {{describe him as}} a very cerebral player, a very unselfish player ... He's {{been one of the}} most effective point guards in America." [...] ESPN's Doug Gottlieb said Scheyer was making an interesting case for national player of the year. [...] On February 15, Scheyer became the first player to win the ACC Player of the Week award three times in the 2009–10 season; it was the fourth time he had won the award in his career. After facing him, North Carolina point guard Larry Drew said: [...] "He's as crafty <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get.</b> [...] You just don't like playing against players like that. He can shoot the ball well. He's quick enough. He's smart. He knows about angles. He's a good actor. And he can shoot." [...] University of Maryland coach Gary Williams observed: ...|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} {{critically}} and commercially successful films of Hoffman's career was The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), which he considered [...] "as edgy <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> for a Hollywood movie". He played a [...] "preppy bully" [...] who taunts Matt Damon's Ripley in the thriller, a character which Jeff Simon of The Buffalo News called [...] "the truest upper class twit in all of American movies". Hoffman's performance {{caught the attention of}} Meryl Streep– another of his cinematic idols– with his performance: [...] "I sat up straight in my seat and said, 'Who is that?' I thought to myself: My God, this actor is fearless. He's done what we all strive for– he's given this awful character the respect he deserves, and he's made him fascinating." [...] In recognition of his work in Magnolia and The Talented Mr. Ripley, Hoffman was named the year's Best Supporting Actor by the National Board of Review.|$|E

Choon Klet pointed to a high initial difficulty but said: [...] "Once the skills are acquired, be ready for many hours of enjoyment and sleepless nights." [...] Chip and Jonathan Carter of St. Petersburg Times deemed the game {{one of the best}} of the year and felt the SNES version [...] "loses nothing in the translation". The duo said the Game Boy and Game Gear versions were [...] "less impressive" [...] due to their technical restrictions but [...] "about as good <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> on the small screen". [...] "Sir Garnabus" [...] of GamePro was impressed with the Game Boy version's clear and detailed graphics, lack of slowdown, good controls, and faithfulness to the original version, but judged the Game Gear version to be [...] "merely average", saying issues such as poor collision detection hamper the game despite its outstanding graphics. Amiga CD32 Gamer called Jungle Strike [...] "a 500lb gorilla among games" [...] and praised its ease of control and [...] "masses of gameplay and realistic detail".|$|E
500|$|The main cast of {{the season}} {{consisted}} of Dan Castellaneta (Homer Simpson, Grampa Simpson, Krusty the Clown, among others), Julie Kavner (Marge Simpson), Nancy Cartwright (Bart Simpson, Ralph Wiggum, Nelson Muntz), Yeardley Smith (Lisa Simpson), Hank Azaria (Moe Szyslak, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, Chief Wiggum, among others) and Harry Shearer (Ned Flanders, Mr. Burns, Principal Skinner, among others). Up until the production of season ten in 1998, these six main voice actors were paid $30,000 per episode. In 1998, a salary dispute {{between them and the}} Fox Broadcasting Company (which airs The Simpsons) arose, with the actors threatening to go on a strike. Fox went as far as preparing for casting of new voices, but an agreement was soon made and the actors' salaries were raised to $125,000 per episode. Groening expressed his sympathy for the cast members in an issue of Mother Jones a while after the salary dispute had been settled. He told the magazine: [...] "They are incredibly talented, and they deserve a chance to be as rich and miserable as anyone else in Hollywood. It looked for a while there like we might not have a show, because everyone was holding firm on all sides. That's still my attitude: Hold out for as much money <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get,</b> but do make the deal." ...|$|E
500|$|Ion Storm {{solicited}} {{feedback from}} fans after demonstrating progress on Anachronox at E3 1998, and assured {{inclusion of a}} multiplayer mode. Tom Hall touted, [...] "It {{is going to be}} very cinematic and about as non-linear <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get.</b> Some levels will be bigger than anything ever seen in a 3-D environment. We are really pushing the engine for this, with loads of textures." [...] Developers made two demonstrations; the second featured lasers, lens flare, and volumetric fog. The gaming press received Anachronox well; one reporter wrote the game was [...] "stunningly beautiful... some of the most superb effects ever seen in a computer game, including rippling water, stunning laser lights and shadow effects". Another wrote that the game would be [...] "graphically spectacular, with detailed characters". Panelists at E3 nominated Anachronox in the [...] "Most Promising Game" [...] and [...] "Best RPG" [...] categories for the Game Critics Awards. Ion Storm planned for a 1999 release, and unveiled new screenshots at the 1998 European Computer Trade Show. Among the game's maps developed in 1998 were Hephaestus (polished by David Namaksy); Whitendon (Iikka Keränen); Democratus, [...] "Matrix 0", and certain interiors of Anachronox (Larry Herring); and the city of Limbus (Rich Carlson). Lead programmer Joey Liaw left Ion Storm to attend Stanford University in mid-1998. That November, several developers at Ion Storm departed to form their own company; among them was David Namaksy, lead level designer for Anachronox.|$|E

Duke has to kill them before the alien's birth does so. Both the level itself and the inclusion of disembodied, slappable [...] "wall boobs" [...] were listed in GamesRadar's [...] "8 worst moments in Duke Nukem Forever". OXM noted that it [...] "doesn't mesh {{with the rest of the}} game's tone at all", and the fact that Duke remains unfazed and continues to crack jokes about the situation was considered [...] "outright revolting", which led to labelling Duke a [...] "thoroughly detestable psychopath" [...] by 1UP and Destructoid respectively.

[...] In a 1997 interview, bass player Skip Battin expressed his dissatisfaction with the album by saying [...] "When we finished it, I didn't think we had anything, I thought the stuff was rotten - it didn't sound good, it was scattered and there was no unification." [...] Drummer Gene Parsons concurred with Battin's assessment of the album, stating [...] "I felt that Farther Along was a good album, but it was under produced.

2500|$|Zanac, in retrospect, {{has been}} {{considered}} a unique shoot 'em up game, combining gameplay elements from games such as Xevious, especially with the extensive power-up system and vertical-scrolling gameplay that features both air and ground targets. Brett Alan Weiss of Allgame praised Zanac, calling it an extremely fast-paced shooter in which the player is almost completely surrounded by enemy ships and bullets. He praises the game for its music which seems to flow along with {{the action of the}} game; he calls the music [...] "at least as close <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> to a Zen moment while playing a shooting game on the NES". Frank Provo of GameSpot lauded Zanac for its difficulty level, its ability to handle many sprites on the screen without slowdown or other glitches, and its unique AI, which placed this game in a subgenre of its own. However, criticisms include mediocre and primitive music and sound, a steep learning curve in gameplay and difficulty level, and poor translation in the game itself and in the game's instruction manual. In addition, Weiss says that enemies in Zanac, while fearsome, [...] "don't have much personality".|$|E

According to Ant, the album is a [...] "live record that lends itself to performance" [...] and will feature a [...] "kind of concept. It's a very old fashioned, old school, step-by-step album". In addition, Ant rerecorded a song in tribute to the late Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren, who died earlier that month, and who also once managed Adam & The Ants.
