5|$|After these events, Ueshiba {{seemed to}} slowly grow away from Takeda, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> change his art. These changes are {{reflected}} in the differing names with which he referred to his system, first as aiki-jūjutsu, then Ueshiba-ryū, Asahi-ryū, and aiki budō. In 1942, when Ueshiba's group joined the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai, the martial art that Ueshiba developed finally {{came to be known as}} aikido.|$|E
5|$|Lucullus was {{astonished}} upon hearing {{this in the}} year 70, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> prepare for an immediate invasion of Armenia. Although he had no mandate from the Senate to authorize such a move, he attempted to justify his invasion by distinguishing as his enemy king Tigranes and not his subjects. In the summer of 69, he marched his troops across Cappodocia and the Euphrates river and entered the Armenian province of Tsop'k', where Tigranocerta was located.|$|E
5|$|Martín de Ursúa was now {{convinced}} that Kan Ek' would not surrender peacefully, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> organise an all-out assault on Nojpetén. Work {{on the road}} was redoubled and {{about a month after}} the battle at Ch'ich' the Spanish arrived at the lakeshore, now supported by artillery. Again a large number of canoes gathered, and the nervous Spanish soldiers opened fire with cannons and muskets; no casualties were reported among the Itza, who retreated and raised a white flag from a safe distance.|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, to Will's despair, {{he falls}} in love with a woman called Rachel. Ironically, Rachel is a single mother with a son named Ali (Alistair) who is the same age as Marcus. The two {{originally}} fight, but quickly become friends. Will's emotional faculties are liberated <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> 'shed his old skin' of emotional indifference - simultaneously Marcus is becoming more typical of his age, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> enjoy his life more.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, Poland's {{economy was}} in shambles. Hyperinflation fueled public unrest, and the {{government}} {{was unable to find}} a quick solution to the mounting unemployment and economic crisis. Piłsudski's allies and supporters repeatedly asked him to return to politics, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> create a new power base, centered around former members of the Polish Legions and the Polish Military Organization as well as some left-wing and intelligentsia parties. In 1925, after several governments had resigned in short order and the political scene was becoming increasingly chaotic, Piłsudski became more and more critical of the government, eventually issuing statements demanding the resignation of the Witos cabinet.|$|E
5|$|Smallpeice left Doulton's in 1948 when {{it became}} clear he wouldn't be offered a board {{position}} with the company, and moved to join fellow accountant Reginald Wilson at the state owned British Transport Commission (BTC). Wilson, as comptroller, offered Smallpeice the role of Director of Costs and Statistics, but within two years, Smallpeice grew to realise that the business, with 600,000 staff, was effectively unmanageable without support from government <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> assess his options elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The {{damage to}} Formby's lungs from the {{accident}} was exacerbated by tuberculosis, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> miss {{an increasing number of}} his appearances. In 1917 the Southport Palladium took court action against him for failing to fulfil a theatrical engagement as contracted, whereupon his lawyer said that Formby was dying of the lung disease and was working for the short time he had left for the benefit of his large family. Formby lost the case: his plea of ill-health was compromised by his accepting an engagement elsewhere at the same time.|$|E

5|$|This turn {{of events}} {{convinced}} Martín de Ursúa that Kan Ek' would not surrender peacefully, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> organise an all-out assault on Nojpetén. The enlistment of previously authorised reinforcements was now urgent, but was hindered when 70 of 100 soldiers mutinied and never reached García's camp. Work on the road was redoubled and {{about a month after}} the battle at Ch'ich' the Spanish arrived at the lakeshore, now supported by artillery. Again a large number of canoes gathered, and the nervous Spanish soldiers opened fire with cannons and muskets; no casualties were reported among the Itza, who retreated and raised a white flag from a safe distance.|$|E
5|$|Though Jane {{never used}} her {{connection}} with Shelley to gain any publicity, she did entertain prominent admirers and biographers of Shelley, including George Eliot and William Michael Rossetti. In {{the years before}} Hogg's death, a nephew of Jane's, one of John Cleveland's seven children, {{came to live with}} them after leaving the military due to an illness. Jane and her nephew, Harry Cleveland, became close friends <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> run her household as she grew older. In her later years, Jane often read novels, played the piano, and spent time with Harry's daughter and her grandchildren.|$|E
5|$|Though Wiggins did {{not give}} up hope {{for a return to}} baseball, he began to study the {{real-estate}} market after his suspension from the game. In the late 1980s, Wiggins began to suffer from health difficulties related to AIDS, though the diagnosis was not publicly disclosed while he was alive. He was receiving deferred payments from his baseball career, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> make plans for the financial future of his children. He told one of his former teammates that he was getting into computer work. Gwynn said that he had seen Wiggins in the spring of 1990 and was struck by his visible weight loss.|$|E

5|$|In 1919 Davies married Margaret ("Madge") Eley from Cardiff; {{three daughters}} were {{subsequently}} born. The {{years following the}} First World War saw economic decline and hardship in the South Wales coalfields, conditions which deepened Davies's radical instincts, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> acquire a reputation for militancy. Contrary to mainstream Labour Party policy, Davies advocated workers' control rather than the nationalisation of the mining industry. In 1921 he unsuccessfully advocated affiliation of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain (MFGB, precursor of the National Union of Mineworkers or NUM) with the Red International of Labour Unions (RILU). The following year he was a delegate from the SWMF to the Second World Congress of the RILU in Moscow, and acquired a warm sympathy towards the Soviet system. He did not, however, join the recently formed Communist Party of Great Britain, and remained within the Labour Party.|$|E
5|$|In 1930 he {{embarked}} upon {{a series}} of drawings and watercolours of Hyde Park, which were due to be exhibited in London. Hunter hoped {{to move to the}} city permanently, as he found it livelier than Glasgow and the art market was more secure. However, his health deteriorated <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> suffer badly from stomach pains. He died in Glasgow in the Claremont Nursing Home on 7 December 1931, aged 54. The cause of death was cardiac failure due to blood poisoning, following an unsuccessful gall bladder operation. A member of Glasgow Art Club, work by Hunter was included in the club's Memorial Exhibition of 1935, in memory of those of its members who had died since the First World War.|$|E
5|$|Lucas {{planned to}} spend another five weeks in Europe, and hoped that Huyck and Katz would agree to finish the {{screenplay}} {{by the time he}} returned, but they were about to start on their own film, Messiah of Evil (1972), so Lucas hired Richard Walter, a colleague from the USC School of Cinematic Arts for the job. Walter was flattered, but initially tried to sell Lucas on a different screenplay called Barry and the Persuasions, a story of East Coast teenagers in the late 1950s. Lucas held firm—his was a story about West Coast teenagers in the early 1960s. Walter was paid the $10,000, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> expand the Lucas/Huyck/Katz treatment into a screenplay.|$|E

Lea, a fashion designer, is obviously attracted <b>to</b> John, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> warm to her as well. They begin a passionate affair, but Lea continues to be evasive {{when it comes to}} answering questions about Elizabeth.|$|R
5|$|Malhotra {{suffered}} an ankle injury in November that sidelined him for four games. Upon his recovery, his play was judged by team management to have suffered <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> be benched. Meanwhile, the Canadian national junior team wanted the Rangers to loan him {{to them for}} the 2000 World Junior Championships. On December 12, 1999, general manager Neil Smith obliged and assigned Malhotra for the international tournament. He was then sent for a two-week conditioning assignment with the Rangers' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Hartford Wolf Pack. On March 14, 2000, he was sent {{back down to the}} OHL in order to retain his eligibility for later AHL assignment in the season. Malhotra had dressed for only four games in the two months between his return from the World Junior Championships in early-January and his junior reassignment. He was pointless in the 27 games total he played with the Rangers that season.|$|E
5|$|Seymour {{arrived in}} Los Angeles on February 22, 1906, and {{within two days}} was preaching at Julia Hutchins' church {{at the corner of}} Ninth Street and Santa Fe Avenue. During his first sermon, he preached that {{speaking}} in tongues was the first biblical evidence of the inevitable infilling in the Holy Spirit. On the following Sunday, March 4, he returned to the church and found that Hutchins had padlocked the door. Elders of the church rejected Seymour's teaching, primarily because he had not yet experienced the blessing about which he was preaching. Condemnation of his message also came from the Holiness Church Association of Southern California with which the church had affiliation. However, not all members of Hutchins' church rejected Seymour's preaching. He was invited to stay in the home of congregation member Edward S. Lee, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> hold Bible studies and prayer meetings there.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the American War of Independence in 1783 Walker {{visited the}} continent, touring through France, Germany and Italy. While in Vienna in 1787, news reached him of {{political}} troubles with the Dutch, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> journey back to England in hope of a commission. While travelling through the forest near Aschaffenburg, the diligence he was in was attacked by ten armed men, who fired into the coach and demanded the passengers' money. Walker attempted to resist them, but was left unsupported by his fellow passengers, and was knocked down, robbed, and thrown into a ditch. The robbers took 800l of money and rode off, believing Walker to be dead. He came to, suffering from a sabre cut to the head, and was carried into Aschaffenburg. There his wounds were treated free of charge by the local surgeons and authorities, and on recovering sufficiently he was brought to Frankfurt. There the local lodge of freemasons offered him financial assistance, and on his arrival at Mainz he was presented to the Prince-Bishop, Friedrich Karl Joseph von Erthal. The Archbishop gave him a letter detailing his adventure in the forest near Aschaffenburg, and commending his bravery. Despite this assistance Walker was unable to reach England until after the Dutch crisis had abated, and so returned to his travels in Germany.|$|E

5|$|The Sideling Hill Tunnel's {{original}} plans {{date back}} to the year 1881, when surveying for the South Pennsylvania Railroad began. Construction began that year, with the plans for nine brand-new tunnels, most of which were drilled by 1885. The Sideling Hill Tunnel was built before December 1884 by John O'Brien, an engineer from Rhinebeck, New York. On July 6, 1885, a blast occurred {{at the end of the}} Sideling Hill Tunnel. The blast, which was caused by dynamite, claimed the lives of three people, including O'Brien. Several other people were injured in the blast. Just sixteen days later, another blast occurred in the tunnel, taking the lives of a Hungarian worker, along with two African-Americans, two Italians, and one Irishman. The bodies were so cut by the rocks during the blast, that the people were almost unidentifiable. Unfortunately William H. Vanderbilt, who had started the plans for the railroad, noticed that expenses began to inflate, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> look for a second way to work things out. The construction was abandoned and never finished. In 1938, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission took over the entire grade of the abandoned railway.|$|E
