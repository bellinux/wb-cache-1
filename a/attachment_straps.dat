40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to discuss a very {{effective}} process developed at APRL to stabilize composite artifacts that had initially been preserved using polyethylene glycol (PEG). Background Information: Exhaustive studies have been undertaken to investigate the technological advancements made in the American Civil War era. An interesting adaptation to spherical case ammunition during this period is the sabot, a wooden, flat based attachment that allowed better positioning of the ammunition and fuse within a gun. Familiar with the scope of APRL research, Anne Lessman of the Vermont Maritime museum contacted APRL concerning the possibility of stabilizing the wooden portion a sabot so that all of its component parts could be re-assembled for display. She provided APRL with a sabot for assessment, re-treatment and evaluation. This waterlogged artifact had been disassembled into its component parts: its wooden base, its <b>attachment</b> <b>straps,</b> and its round cast shot. The wooden base was initially treated with PEG and appeared to generally be in good condition, but its surfaces felt very soft and damp due to what appeared to be a high concentration of PEG. Unfortunately, no conservation notes were available making it nearly impossible to determine what percentages and weights of PEG had been used to to preserve the sabot. Data was collected prior to re-treatment for analysis...|$|E

50|$|By 2014, Valbray {{employed}} 12 people. While it {{does not}} manufacture its own movements, Valbray does master in-house fabrication of the case, hands, dial, and unique shutter element as well as <b>strap</b> <b>attachment</b> systems.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{very cheap}} [...] "strap-on dildos" [...] have <b>straps</b> or <b>attachments</b> for <b>straps</b> {{directly}} molded into {{the material of}} the dildo. This design is very flimsy, and is only used on the cheapest products. They are essentially useless for the traditional purpose of a strap-on dildo (one partner penetrating another using a dildo in a position similar to a penis), but can be strapped around chairs and other objects {{for a variety of}} other activities.|$|R
50|$|On launch, it was {{reported}} that the wrist <b>strap</b> <b>attachments</b> for the Joy-Con were hard to detach from the controllers. It was also reported that a wrist strap could easily be attached to the Joy-Con incorrectly and become stuck, making it difficult to remove.|$|R
50|$|PALS {{consists}} of webbing sewn onto the load-bearing equipment and corresponding webbing and <b>straps</b> on the <b>attachment.</b> The <b>straps</b> are interwoven between the webbing {{on each of}} two pieces and finally snapped into place, making for a very secure fit which can be detached with moderate effort. New types are laser cut out of single piece fabric rather than webbing straps sewn onto fabric. This is common on many new tactical items from backpacks to chest rigs. The spacing is the same standard so new lasercut ladders are 100% backwards compatible with older pouches made for webbing strap construction rigs.|$|R
500|$|Before the Second World War broke out, elastic {{materials}} were rationed and unavailable for clothing. Israel Pilot designed an improved cup with a diagonal slash, shoulder <b>strap</b> <b>attachment.</b> This innovation on existing bra design provided more comfort {{and freedom of}} movement for the wearer. He also coined the name [...] "Wonder-Bra" [...] in 1935.|$|R

A separate [...] "charging grip" [...] accessory allows the controllers to be charged in a gamepad configuration via USB-C. Nintendo released a Joy-Con AA battery pack attachment on June 16, 2017, with it sliding onto the Joy-Con similarly to the wrist <b>strap</b> <b>attachments.</b>|$|R
50|$|Lineman {{lanyards}} {{are used}} by Lineman utility and other workers to prevent falls, although similar straps are also used recreationally by mountain climbers. This type of lanyard will have a section of heavy duty nylon strapping attached to a metal ring or carabiner which tightens around an <b>attachment</b> point. The <b>strap</b> may be a fixed length or adjustable, and will attach to the wearer to support them against a fixed object or pole.|$|R
40|$|The {{results are}} {{described}} {{of a series}} of current conduction tests with a thermal control blanket to which grounding straps have been attached. The material and the ground <b>strap</b> <b>attachment</b> procedure are described. The current conduction tests consisted of a surge current examination of the ground strap and a dilute flow, energetic electron deposition and transport through the bulk of the insulating film of this thermal blanket material. Both of these test procedures were used previously with thermal control blanket materials...|$|R
5000|$|The Calypso {{is equally}} {{suitable}} {{for water and}} air environment photography. It consists of two black enamelled cast alloy body parts; the one with all the internal parts is lowered into the outer shell. They are locked together when the interchangeable lens is mounted on the camera, and sealed by Vaseline greased O-rings to form a watertight unit. At the top, the Calypso has a built-in optical viewfinder for the 35mm standard lens, and an accessory shoe on the top for separate viewfinders to suit various purposes. The body is covered in a grey sealskin imitation. Two carrying <b>strap</b> <b>attachments</b> doubles as opening levers to be hooked under the top protrusions either side and forced downwards to lift the top out when no lens is mounted on the camera.|$|R
40|$|A {{modification}} from Velco ® and strapping to a sewn attachment {{method for}} the shoulder straps of the Clothe the Soldier (CTS) Rucksack was evaluated for: load control, dynamic peak loading and pressure distribution to the torso. Quantitative assessment of these functional parameters was undertaken {{to compare the}} behaviour of a proposed modification {{to that of the}} currently fielded design to ensure no degradation in performance. This modification was proposed to address problems that have arisen with the current shoulder <b>strap</b> <b>attachment</b> when loads carried in the rucksack increased from 25 to approximately 45 kg. The CTS load carriage system includes the Tactical Vest (TV), the Rucksack, and a Small Pack System which have been designed to be compatible. In addition to wearing the TV and one of the packs, soldiers are increasingly attempting to wear the Fragmentation Protection Vest (FPV), with Bullet Resistant Plates (BRP) beneath the TV and Rucksack. The purpose of testing was to quantify any impact of the modified shoulder attachment design on the following parameters: a soldier’s load control ability, the pressur...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} our study was to {{evaluate}} all contact pressures between the molded ankle-foot orthosis (MAFO) and the subject during activities of daily living. The MAFOs studied are used clinically to reduce plantar contact pressures associat-ed with foot ulcers in adult neuropathic diabetic subjects, alle-viating abnormal pressures by redistributing them to low-pressure plantar regions. While effective, MAFOs are often not used by the subject due to weight and comfort issues. An understanding of the contact pressures between the subject and the orthosis {{is a first step}} in improving basic MAFO design. Four nonimpaired, young adult males were tested in this study. A right-side MAFO was custom-molded and fitted for each sub-ject by the same orthotist. Real-time pressures were obtained for the entire contact area using the F-Scan pressure measurement system. The data obtained demonstrated high contact pressures along the metatarsals of the foot, around the heel and ankle, and adjacent to the <b>strap</b> <b>attachment</b> sites. No contact pressures were noted along the posterior calf region during any of the activities performed. These data suggest the calf region would be a suit-able site for material removal for weight reduction and increased comfort, especially in warm weather. In addition, these data may be useful to orthotists in improving the basic design and to researchers {{as a starting point for}} performing com-plex finite element analysis on the MAFO.

50|$|Field Pack (medium) - The field pack is made {{of water}} {{repellent}} treated nylon duck and webbing, spacer fabric, and metal hardware. It {{can be used with}} or without the LC-1 Field Pack Frame. The main compartment closes by means of a drawstring secured by a plastic cord clamp. A radio pocket is located against the back on the inside. The size of the pack may be decreased for smaller loads by means of three para-cord ties, stitched to the inside bottom of the pack, and three metal D-rings located directly below the internal radio pocket. Three pockets on the outside, with strap and buckle adjustable closures and with snap fasteners for quick access, are provided for miscellaneous items. The top flap has a pocket with a hook and pile fastener tape sealed closure. Equipment hangers are located above each outside pocket and on each side. Drainage eyelets are provided {{in the bottom of the}} main compartment and the outside pockets. An envelope pocket is located at the top, back of the pack and padded with spacer cloth, into which the field pack frame is inserted when the field pack is used on the field pack frame. Buckles and straps at each side near the bottom are used for anchoring the field pack to the field pack frame. Two rectangular wire loops located at the top back of the field pack and D rings on each side at the bottom of the field pack are used to provide shoulder <b>strap</b> <b>attachment</b> when the field pack is carried without the field pack frame. A waterproof bag is supplied for the main compartment and each of the three outside pockets for keeping equipment dry.|$|R
