5|$|A {{solar power}} tower uses {{an array of}} {{tracking}} reflectors (heliostats) to concentrate light on a central receiver <b>atop</b> <b>a</b> tower. Power towers are more cost effective, offer higher efficiency and better energy storage capability among CSP technologies. The PS10 Solar Power Plant and PS20 solar power plant are examples of this technology.|$|E
5|$|Although {{none were}} ever built, several {{derivatives}} of Black Arrow were also proposed, as ways of increasing its payload capacity. One proposal added eight Raven solid rocket motors from the Skylark programme {{to the first}} stage as booster rockets. Another suggestion was to mount the entire rocket <b>atop</b> <b>a</b> Blue Streak missile, while a third proposal involved replacing the Gamma engines with the more powerful Larch.|$|E
5|$|Flocks {{of birds}} appear {{to engage in}} play; one routine {{involves}} a bird perching <b>atop</b> <b>a</b> tall tree, pole or spire, and others swooping, tumbling or diving and attempting to dislodge it. A successful challenger is then challenged in its turn by other birds in the flock.|$|E

In all, 25 fire stations and over 100 fire appliances were mobilised in response to the incident.|$|E

Also buried within the chamber were flint tools and small quantities of pottery.|$|E
5|$|AMiBA was {{originally}} configured as a 7-element interferometer <b>atop</b> <b>a</b> hexapod mount. Observations at a wavelength of 3mm (86–102GHz) started in October 2006, and the detections of six clusters by the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect were announced in 2008. In 2009 the telescope was upgraded to 13 elements, {{and it is}} capable of further expansion to 19 elements. AMiBA {{is the result of a}} collaboration between the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, the National Taiwan University and the Australia Telescope National Facility, and also involves researchers from other universities.|$|E
5|$|After {{four weeks}} of filming in Philadelphia, {{the cast and crew}} moved to Wildwood, New Jersey, which doubled for scenes set at the Atlantic City boardwalk.

The scene required Modine and Cage to hang {{off the edge of the}} roof secured by safety wires, while the sequence in which Birdy falls off the roof was performed by a stunt double.|$|E

5|$|Clock Tower was {{directed}} by Hifumi Kono, who wished to use the game {{to pay homage to}} one of his favorite film directors, Dario Argento.

Kono had a passion for old horror films, and wanted Clock Tower to feel like one.|$|E
