For a common sample of firms with both deferred revenue and accounts receivable, I find evidence that managers do not prefer to exercise discretion in either account. However, further tests show that managers preferred to use discretion in deferred revenue before the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 went into effect, consistent with them choosing to manage an account with the lowest real costs to the firm (i. e., future cash consequences).

40|$|The {{reliability}} of EMU’s fiscal indicators {{has been questioned}} by recent episodes of large upward deficit revisions. This paper discusses the causes of such revisions {{in order to identify}} ways to improve monitoring. The computation of EMU’s deficit indicator involves the assessment of <b>accrued</b> <b>revenue</b> and expenditure and the identification of transactions in financial assets. Both can open margins for opportunistic accounting. However, crosschecks between deficit and changes in gross nominal debt (the other fiscal indicator used in EMU) can reduce the scope for fiscal gimmickry. Simple comparison of deficit and changes in debt can readily spotlight large inconsistencies in fiscal data. Nevertheless, consistency checks must go deeper than simple comparison, since different items in the reconciliation account between deficit and change in debt can offset each other. Econometric evidence suggests that such offset may indeed have been used to reduce the visibility of deficit-specific fiscal gimmickry. Attention to the quality of statistics has increased in recent years, also {{in the context of the}} reform of the Stability and Growth Pact. In this context, the paper argues that detailed analysis of the reconciliation account between deficit and change in debt is crucial to the effectiveness of monitoring...|$|E

The experiment was farmers’ participatory {{with a group of}} 8 farmers. Two seeding rates were used; farmers’ traditional seed rate of 26 kg ha- 1 (D 2) as high seed rate and lower seed rate of 13 kg ha- 1 (D 1). Observations were made on growth and yield parameters of the crop. The results showed that growth and yield of celosia were significantly (P< 0. 05) influenced by system of crop intensification. The results of seeding rates‘ effects on number of leaves, stem width and yield showed that low seed rate (D 1) performed better than high seed rate (D 2). Low seed rate (D 1) resulted in higher marketable fresh leaf yield of 12. 24 ton ha- 1 compared to high seed rate (D 2) of 8. 82 ton ha- 1. The <b>accrued</b> <b>revenue</b> / ha ranged between ₦ 882, 000 to ₦ 1, 224, 000 [₦ 150 = $ 1 (US Dollar) ] for D 2 and D 1 respectively, subsequently increasing farmers’ income.

40|$|Spectrum trading allows incumbents of {{spectrum}} {{to increase}} their profit margins by selling portions of unused spectrum to secondary systems. While being a spectrally efficient process; interference from secondary usage degrades {{the performance of the}} incumbent network. We propose distributed power control algorithms with incumbent protection for secondary systems which is incorporated in the incumbent's pricing mechanism. Pricing is a fundamental part of the spectrum trading economic model; it indicates the value of spectrum to both buyers (SSP) and sellers (PSP) and influences the forces of demand and supply. There exist a compromise between the <b>accrued</b> <b>revenue</b> from spectrum trading and the resultant QoS degradation caused by SSPs to PSPs. interference from SSPs may increase churn within the PSP network, therefore, pricing algorithms need to be efficiently designed to capture PSPs profit in relation to the magnitude of SSPs interference. We consider distributed power control algorithms (PCA) for the SSP network and allow secondary spectrum trading in TV white spaces (TVWS) and demonstrate that a PSP can profit from secondary spectrum trading without obtrusive interference from SSPs. The power control algorithm introduced therefore ensures that the incumbent's interference threshold is never violated, leading to increased profit and reduced churn for the incumbent operator and improved quality of service for the secondary system due to spectrum buy. © 2013 IEEE...|$|E

The lessons drawn from the economic analysis of illegal acts, which shows that the level of deterrence hinges on a combination of effects associated with the intensiveness of surveillance and the severity of the sanction stresses the importance to define an optimal deterrent policy (c) [3, 13]. Thus the ASE systems can be characterized by different combinations of surveillance and sanction. It is also crucial that the scale of penalties and the modalities of the sanctions are taken into account, as they affect the functioning of the whole system (fines and/or demerit point system 3...). The technical dimension also includes the installation criteria (d) for the detection devices (abnormal driving speed level, black spot...). Lastly, this dimension involves the technological choice (e) made by the authorities for or against the use of digital photographic processes with more or less sophisticated levels of automation and which are more or less costly.|$|E
40|$|Cashmere Forest is {{currently}} a production forest comprised of mostly radiata pine (c. 85 %), Douglas fir (c. 5 %) and some non plantation areas. The Port Hills Park Trust Board (PHPTB) is interested in purchasing Cashmere Forest {{for the purpose of}} creating a public forest park environment where forestry, indigenous biodiversity, recreation and the environment are goals of sustainable management. For this purpose this draft forest management (DFM) plan has been prepared. The preparation of the Cashmere DFM plan comprised three main components: 1. An economic analysis of the current plantation component of Cashmere Forest. 2. Preparation of a draft forest management plan which encompasses the management of plantation and non plantation areas. 3. Preparation of a geographic information system (GIS) for Cashmere Forest. Economic analysis evaluated clearfell, coupe (2 to 5 ha), and a mixture of coupe and continuous canopy management (CCM) as harvesting scenarios. The coupe CCM mix was recommended for implementation primarily as it best suited long term management goals for Cashmere Forest Park while also returning modest value (NPV $ 561, 966). Normal cashflow analysis was also used to analyse cashflow over the first thirty years of operation from 2007. Under coupe/CCM, accrued profit does not become permanently positive until around 2019 due to initial infrastructure costs. <b>Accrued</b> <b>revenue</b> culminates at around 4 million after 30 years. This figure may drop following implementation of high pruning, alternative growth models and indigenous restoration. The Cashmere DFM plan begins with the 200 year vision which sees a Forest Park ecosystem that achieves production, environmental, ecological and recreational goals appropriate to its Port Hills location. Production forestry is practiced through the selective harvesting of a range of naturally regenerated exotic and restored indigenous species. Landscape, soil and water resources are sustainably managed through the retention of a mixed forest canopy. The forest park has been significantly augmented with indigenous flora and fauna typical of the Port Hills and ecologically significant areas are managed specifically for their indigenous biodiversity. Park recreational users are enjoying ongoing utilisation of a unique Canterbury landscape. Plantation forest management involves coupes of between 2 to 5 ha which will be harvested with cable or ground based systems with areas split approximately 50 : 50 between the two. Cable harvesting will be carried out with a swing yarder system with ground based operations carried out with track skidders. CCM will be carried out on a trial basis in three compartments. Re-establishment of plantation areas will aim towards occupying around 58 % of Cashmere Forest, comprised of areas of radiate pine 65 %, radiata pine/eucalypt 24 %, Douglas fir/eucalypt 5 % and Alternative species 6 %. Non plantation areas are identified as either bluff, track or clearing. Within each area there may be one or more vegetation type including tussock grassland, mixed shrubland, rock association and any mixture of the three. It is proposed that the non plantation area will eventually increase to include riparian buffers 31 %, restored native 55 %, bluff 10 % and track 4 % areas, reflecting the long term vision of increased native areas in Cashmere Forest. Monitoring of forest operations, restoration, recreation and management progress will be integral to the successful implementation of the Cashmere DFM plan. A database of information will be created to allow periodical reviews of processes and predictions and reconciliation of costs and revenues associated with the management of Cashmere Forest. Periodical reviews will also be undertaken by an independent management advisory group who can liaise with the project manager of Cashmere Forest Park to discuss issues and aid planning and ensure the successful establishment of this unique park resource...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis article {{assesses the}} {{environmental}} and economic efficiency of three different approaches to treat monitoring uncertainty in climate policy, namely prescribing uncertainty, setting minimum certainty thresholds and pricing uncertainty through a discount. Our model {{of the behavior of}} profit-maximizing agents demonstrates that under the simplest set of assumptions the regulator has no interest in reducing monitoring uncertainty. However, in the presence of information asymmetry, monitoring uncertainty may hamper the economic and environmental performance of climate policy due to adverse selection. In a mandatory policy, prescribing a reasonable level of uncertainty is preferable if the regulator has enough information to determine this level. For voluntary mechanisms, such as carbon offsets, allowing agents to set their own monitoring uncertainty below a maximum threshold or discounting carbon revenues in proportion to monitoring uncertainty are the best approaches for the regulator to mitigate the negative effects of information asymmetry. These conclusions are much more pronounced when agents do not <b>accrue</b> <b>revenues</b> from their mitigation action, other than carbon. Our analysis of monitoring uncertainty under information asymmetry, which results in heterogeneity in the agents’ benefits from abatement, generalizes the classical trade-off between production efficiency and information rents...|$|R
