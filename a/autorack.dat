5|$|Cargolink AS is a Norwegian railway company. Owned by the {{automotive}} distribution company Autolink, Cargolink has operated both <b>autorack</b> and container trains since November 2008. Cargolink has {{a fleet of}} ten diesel locomotives, five shunters, 100 autoracks and 60 container cars. Combined <b>autorack</b> and container trains are operated up to five times per week along the Sørland-, Bergen-, Rauma-, Røros- and Nordland Lines, as well as services through Sweden.|$|E
5|$|Autolink {{had already}} founded their company Cargolink on 27 March, and {{received}} an operating and safety licence from the inspectorate on 18 September. They took {{control over the}} five shunters they owned, in addition to leasing ten Di 6 diesel locomotives. Operations started on 2 November, when all <b>autorack</b> trains were {{taken over by the}} new company.|$|E
5|$|Six {{units were}} leased by CFL between 2000 and 2004. The Luxembourgian State Railways were {{in need of}} new diesel {{locomotives}} to overcome the three different electrification systems in use. Because of a three-year waiting time for new locomotives, CFL leased the Di6 units for freight trains between Esch-sur-Alzette, Bettembourg and Mertert. In November 2003, the locomotives were sold to Vossloh and given the designation DE 2700. Since 2006, the main leaser is the Veolia Verkehr-owned Nord-Ostsee-Bahn, which operates passenger trains in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. Eight locomotives are used to haul six to ten-car passengers trains on the route between Hamburg and Sylt. In 2008, three locomotives returned to Norway, when Cargolink leased them for their new <b>autorack</b> freight operations. In 2009, NOB transferred its ninth unit to HSL Logistik.|$|E

5|$|The {{company was}} founded in 2001, and took over Norges Statsbaner's (NSB) {{passenger}} operation of the Ofoten Line in 2003. The following year it entered the freight market, in particular with timber trains for Norske Skog. It further expanded into other services, such as charter trips. In 2006, the company almost went bankrupt, and {{was taken over by}} Rail Management. In 2007, the automotive distributor Autolink started purchasing the <b>autorack</b> operations from Ofotbanen, {{and at the same time}} bought 40% of the company. 2008 saw a dramatic decline in operations, as both the Norske Skog, Autolink and passenger train services were terminated. In April the company started service with the Unionexpressen between Oslo and Stockholm. The company went bankrupt in October, but was immediately re-established as Ofotbanen Drift. In May 2010, the new company filed for bankruptcy.|$|E
25|$|Curiously, in 1961 a German-built three-unit, {{articulated}} bilevel <b>autorack</b> was {{imported into}} the United States {{to demonstrate the}} German design to U.S. railroads. North American Car Corporation handled promotion of the car, which was marked NIFX 1200. The car rode on four single-axle trucks and was tested by the B, but no sales resulted.|$|E
25|$|From the {{beginning}} in 1971, {{the same year}} Amtrak began service on purely passenger routes in the US, a key feature of Auto-Train's new service {{was the use of}} autoracks, which were former Canadian National transcontinental bi-level, enclosed <b>autorack</b> boxcars. These were augmented by new tri-level auto-racks built by Southern Iron & Equipment in 1976.|$|E

5|$|Autolink has {{traditionally}} owned a large pool of <b>autoracks.</b> These have been {{operated by the}} Norwegian State Railways, and subsequently their subsidiary CargoNet. On 31 January 2007, Autolink bought 40% of the private railway company Ofotbanen, {{and at the same}} time signed a haulage contract with them. This made Autolink Ofotbanen's largest customer, and second largest owner. In March, Autolink ordered additional 70new <b>autoracks</b> for NOK175 million.|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to containers, Port Newark {{is a major}} import/export center of automobiles using roll-on/roll-off operation between ship and rail. The adjacent Doremus Avenue Auto Terminal I & II is owned by Conrail and serves CSX and NS trains. The yard occupies 87 acres and has ten unloading tracks and ten holding tracks to serve multilevel <b>autorack</b> cars.|$|E
25|$|An <b>autorack,</b> {{also known}} as an auto carrier (also car {{transporter}} outside the US), is a specialized piece of railroad rolling stock used to transport automobiles and light trucks. Autoracks are used to transport new vehicles from factories to automotive distributors, and to transport passengers' vehicles in car shuttles and motorail services, such as Amtrak's Auto Train route.|$|E
25|$|<b>Autorack</b> {{and flat}} car length quickly grew to 87 feet (26.52m) and then 89 feet (27.13m) to {{increase}} their loading capacity even further. This made them {{about as long as}} the average railroad passenger car of the time; if the cars were much longer, they wouldn't be able to operate in interchange service due to clearance on curves. Yet, the railroads could still do better.|$|E

25|$|In the mid-1950s, in Germany, Volkswagen Beetle {{production}} was increasing beyond {{the capacity of}} highway trucks (autocarriers). Volkswagen engineers worked with German railroads to design a railroad car that was basically an extra long version of a vehicle hauling trailer. The design {{they came up with}} was able to carry 10 vehicles on one car. VW's two-level flatcar design effectively became the first <b>autorack,</b> entering service circa 1954.|$|E
25|$|This {{arrangement}} {{worked so}} well that nearly every <b>autorack</b> operating in the US was owned by a railroad, {{with only a few}} exceptions. Trailer Train became TTX Company in 1991; since then many railroads have themselves purchased the flat cars on which the racks were installed and TTX has itself expanded into purchasing and leasing out other railroad rolling stock. The development of enclosed autoracks also helped make several other innovative services work well.|$|E
25|$|On May 25, 2013, in Chaffee, Missouri, a Union Pacific train {{collided}} with a BNSF train at a level junction. Seven people were injured. A total of 24 cars were derailed, including loaded <b>autorack</b> and scrap metal cars. Included in the crash were two Union Pacific engines. The accident caused an overpass to partially collapse, and a post-accident fire was also reported. The resulting investigation concluded the engineer most likely fell asleep, due to sleep apnea. In this incident, four progressively restrictive signals where violated, resulting in the UP train hitting the BNSF train at roughly 40 MPH. Total damages exceeded ten million dollars. The Missouri Route M bridge was reopened in August, 2013 with a new design.|$|E

25|$|A {{major problem}} left to solve {{was that the}} new <b>autorack</b> cars did not provide any {{protection}} from theft, vandalism, or from severe weather. Individual railroads began installing mesh side screens and solid panels to their racks to protect the vehicles from impact and debris in the late 1960s, and by the early 1970s new racks were being delivered with these side panels. However, thieves and vagrants could still {{gain access to the}} automobiles. In 1973 the first fully enclosed racks with continuous side panels, end doors, and roofs were developed to address this problem. Whitehead & Kales, Ford, N and DT jointly developed a Snap-Pak prototype enclosed tri-level car, NW 400000. The car side was made up of overlapping perforated steel sheets. The ends were protected with two trifold doors, and a corrugated steel roof extended the full length of the car. A competing RailPac prototype was developed by Portec-Paragon, Chrysler, and several railroads. It featured mesh screen side panels, vertically sliding three-piece doors, and a similar roof. The Southern Railway and Greenville Steel Car developed a unique 124-foot articulated three-unit Autoguard car with single axle trucks, SOU 599000-599001.|$|E
500|$|On {{contract}} from Autolink, Cargolink operates <b>autorack</b> trains throughout {{large portions of}} the Norwegian railway network, from the seaports in Drammen and Oslo. Services are provided along the Sørland Line to Stavanger, along the Bergen Line to Bergen, along the Dovre Line to Trondheim, along the Rauma Line to Åndalsnes, and along the Nordland Line to Mosjøen, Mo i Rana and Bodø. It also operates through Sweden to reach Narvik and Malmö Each route has up to five weekly departures in both directions with combined <b>autorack</b> and container trains. The company transports 55,000 cars annually on 600 trains, giving a revenue of [...] Autolink is responsible for about three-quarters of all new-car distribution in the country. On the weekly return trips from Northern Norway, Cargolink uses the empty cars to transport aluminum from Elkem Mosjøen.|$|E

While the shunters are owned by Cargolink, the diesel locomotives are leased from Dispolok of Germany and the electric locomotives are leased from Hector Rail. It also has more than 100closed <b>autoracks</b> for automobile transport, and 60container cars. 70new <b>autoracks</b> are under delivery from Sweden.|$|R

At 4 pm, the locomotive engineer is given clearance to occupy the main line, and the train departs the station to begin its run.|$|R
2500|$|In the 1950s, Canadian National Railway (CN) {{introduced}} {{a group of}} innovative bi-level <b>autorack</b> railcars. These autoracks had end doors and were very large {{by the standards of}} the time; at [...] long, each <b>autorack</b> could carry 8 completed automobiles. These autoracks were a big success and helped lead to the development of today's fully enclosed autoracks. Tri-level autoracks were developed in the 1970s.|$|E
2500|$|CSXT used {{to provide}} intermodal, <b>autorack,</b> and general {{merchandise}} over the Worcester Line, a part of CSXT's Boston Line. [...] This part of the Commuter Rail network could host over 12 mainline freight trains per day, including descendents of Conrail's expedited intermodal Trail Van trains. Currently most freight service terminates in Framingham, and a trainload facility in Westboro, with limited freight service east through Beacon Park Yard in Allston to a few local customers. In 2013 CSX moved its intermodal service from Beacon Park to an expanded yard in Worcester.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Canadian National {{was at the}} {{forefront}} of <b>autorack</b> technology again by using light-weight aluminum. The new cars, built by Johnstown America Corporation beginning in December 2004, are brand named AVC, an acronym for Aluminum Vehicle Carrier. Two hundred new aluminum autoracks promise a softer ride, a wider interior, superior door-edge protection, and a rust-free interior from older steel versions. Canadian Pacific Railway has ordered 375 of these new cars as well. The new cars built for Amtrak Auto Train service differ from those built for CN and CP; the Amtrak cars are [...] lower, or , in height, and use solid side panels instead of the perforated panels operated in freight service.|$|E

It also has more than 100 closed <b>autoracks</b> for automobile transport, and 60 container cars. 70 new <b>autoracks</b> are under delivery from Sweden.|$|R
50|$|Lorton was {{selected}} as site of the northern terminal because the 20 ft height <b>autoracks</b> were too tall {{to pass through the}} First Street Tunnel into Washington, D.C.|$|R
50|$|The <b>autoracks</b> {{are further}} split into four to six {{sections}} and each section is lined up with a loading ramp (see picture). The doors between each are opened, and connecting ramps are lowered to allow vehicles to move between cars. At this point vehicles begin to roll off the <b>autoracks</b> and around to the claim area, where they are identified and announced by the vehicle number that {{was attached to the}} vehicle at the origin station. Vehicles are not unloaded in the same order they were loaded the previous day. It normally takes two hours to unload all vehicles from a full train.|$|R
