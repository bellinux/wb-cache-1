5|$|Belle's {{strength}} {{and love of}} reading was inspired by American actress Katharine Hepburn's performance as Jo March in the film Little Women (1933), while the writers instilled the adventure-seeking heroine with goals and aspirations beyond romance.

Several additional Hollywood actresses inspired Belle's appearance, including Natalie Wood, Elizabeth Taylor, and Grace Kelly.|$|E

Seymour is horrified that he has now murdered twice, and after posing as a dentist to avoid the suspicion of Farb's masochistic patient Wilbur Force, Seymour feeds Farb's body to Audrey Jr. The unexplained disappearances {{of the two men}} attract the attention of the police and Mushnick finds himself questioned by Sergeant Joe Fink and his assistant Officer Frank Stoolie (take-offs of Dragnet characters Joe Friday and Frank Smith,).

5|$|Donen's {{next film}} was at Paramount Pictures for {{producer}} Roger Edens. Funny Face contains {{four of the}} original George and Ira Gershwin songs from the otherwise unrelated 1927 Broadway musical {{of the same name}} that had starred Fred Astaire. Loosely based on the life of fashion photographer Richard Avedon, who was also the visual consultant and designed the opening title sequence for the film, it was written by Leonard Gershe and included additional music by Gershe and Edens. Donen and Edens began pre-production at MGM, but had difficulty juggling Astaire <b>and</b> <b>Audrey</b> Hepburn's Paramount contracts, the Warner Brothers – owned rights to the Gershwin music that they wanted and their own MGM contracts. Eventually a deal was reached that both released Donen from his MGM contract and allowed him to make his next two films at Paramount and Warner Brothers respectively. Astaire plays an aging fashion photographer who discovers the intellectual bohemian Hepburn at a used bookstore in Greenwich Village and turns her into his new model while falling in love with her in Paris. Donen, Avedon and cinematographer Ray June collaborated to give the film an abstract, smokey look that resembled the fashion photography of the period despite protests by Paramount, which had recently spent a fortune developing the crisp VistaVision. Funny Face was screened in competition at the 1957 Cannes Film Festival and received good reviews from critics like Crowther. Sight and Sound, in contrast, accused it of being anti-intellectual.|$|E
