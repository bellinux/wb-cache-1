5|$|The {{antibiotics}} neomycin and metronidazole {{are other}} antibiotics {{used to treat}} hepatic encephalopathy. The rationale of their use {{was the fact that}} ammonia and other waste products are generated and converted by intestinal bacteria, and killing these bacteria would reduce the generation of these waste products. Neomycin was chosen because of its low intestinal absorption, as neomycin and similar <b>aminoglycoside</b> antibiotics may cause hearing loss and kidney failure if used by injection. Later studies showed that neomycin was indeed absorbed when taken by mouth, with resultant complications. Metronidazole, similarly, is less commonly used because prolonged use can cause nerve damage, in addition to gastrointestinal side effects.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aminoglycoside</b> antibiotics, such as kanamycin, gentamicin, streptomycin, etc., {{were once}} {{effective}} against staphylococcal infections until strains evolved mechanisms to inhibit the aminoglycosides' action, which occurs via protonated amine and/or hydroxyl {{interactions with the}} ribosomal RNA of the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit. Three main mechanisms of <b>aminoglycoside</b> resistance mechanisms are currently and widely accepted: <b>aminoglycoside</b> modifying enzymes, ribosomal mutations, and active efflux of the drug out of the bacteria.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: It is {{well-known}} that <b>aminoglycosides</b> are ototoxic and nephrotoxic. Recent advances in pharmacology research {{suggest that the}} red cell used as a carrier of <b>aminoglycosides.</b> This study aimed to find the effect of <b>aminoglycosides</b> on the human red cell membrane using osmotic fragility test. Materials and Methods: This {{study was conducted in}} Rizgari Teaching Hospital in Erbil, Iraq. The effect of <b>aminoglycosides,</b> namely gentamicin, amikacin, and spectinomycin, on human red cells was investigated. The effects of <b>aminoglycosides</b> were evaluated by osmotic fragility test using fresh human blood in the presence of <b>aminoglycosides</b> in concentrations of 10 - 160 μg/mL. Results: The results showed that <b>aminoglycosides</b> drugs shifted the osmotic fragility curve to some extent, and this effect was well observed with spectinomycin. The hemolysis did not depend on the concentration of <b>aminoglycosides.</b> The concentration of sodium chloride to induced 50 % hemolysis is higher in presence of gentamicin, amikacin and spectinomycin (at 160 μg/mL) than corresponding control and this account to an increment in hemolysis percents of 1. 88, 1. 5 and 1. 06 %, respectively. Conclusion: <b>Aminoglycosides</b> induce human red cell membrane fragility in a concentration-independent manner...|$|R
50|$|<b>Aminoglycosides</b> {{are useful}} {{primarily}} in infections involving aerobic, Gram-negative bacteria, such as Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, and Enterobacter. In addition, some Mycobacteria, including the bacteria that cause tuberculosis, {{are susceptible to}} <b>aminoglycosides.</b> Streptomycin was the first effective drug {{in the treatment of}} tuberculosis, though the role of <b>aminoglycosides</b> such as streptomycin and amikacin has been eclipsed (because of their toxicity and inconvenient route of administration) except for multiple-drug-resistant strains. The most frequent use of <b>aminoglycosides</b> is empiric therapy for serious infections such as septicemia, complicated intraabdominal infections, complicated urinary tract infections, and nosocomial respiratory tract infections. Usually, once cultures of the causal organism are grown and their susceptibilities tested, <b>aminoglycosides</b> are discontinued in favor of less toxic antibiotics.|$|R
40|$|A novel {{method for}} the {{determination}} of <b>aminoglycosides</b> by surface-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (SALDI MS) {{with the aid of}} silver-coated gold nanoparticles (Au@AgNPs) has been developed. The Au@AgNPs with surface capped by anionic citrate were used as concentrating probes as well as matrices in SALDI MS. Adsorption of <b>aminoglycosides</b> onto the nanoparticles was mainly through electrostatic attraction. The aminoglycoside-adsorbed nanoparticles were directly characterized by SALDI MS after a simple washing. Using Au@AgNPs to preconcentrate the <b>aminoglycosides</b> from 500 μL buffer solution, the limits of detection (LODs) at signal-to-noise ratio of 3 were 3, 25, 15, 30, and 38 nM for paromomycin, kanamycin A, neomycin, gentamicin, and apramycin, respectively. This method was successfully applied to {{the determination of}} <b>aminoglycosides</b> in human plasma samples. The LODs of <b>aminoglycosides</b> in plasma samples were 9, 130, 81, and 180 nM for paromomycin, kanamycin A, neomycin, and gentamicin, respectively.

25|$|Antibiotics by mouth such as {{ciprofloxacin}} or azithromycin {{are given}} to help prevent infection or to control ongoing infection. The <b>aminoglycoside</b> antibiotics (e.g. tobramycin) used can cause hearing loss, damage to the balance system in the inner ear or kidney failure with long-term use. To prevent these side-effects, the amount of antibiotics in the blood is routinely measured and adjusted accordingly.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aminoglycoside</b> {{antibiotics}} (gentamicin) {{can be used}} {{to treat}} Ménière's disease. Systemic streptomycin (given by injection) and topical gentamicin (given directly to the inner ear) are useful for their ability to affect the hair cells of the balance system. Gentamicin also can affect the hair cells of the cochlea, though, and cause hearing loss in about 10% of patients. In cases that do not respond to medical management, surgery may be indicated.|$|E
40|$|Sepsis {{is common}} in {{neonates}} and is {{a major cause of}} morbidity and mortality. Sixty percent of preterm neonates receive at least one antibiotic, and 43 % of the antibiotics administered to these neonates are <b>aminoglycosides.</b> The clearance (Cl), serum half-life (t(1 / 2)), and volume of distribution (Vd) of <b>aminoglycosides</b> change during the neonatal life, and the pharmacokinetics of <b>aminoglycosides</b> need to be studied in neonates in order to optimise therapy with these drugs. The aim of this work is to review the published data on the pharmacokinetics of <b>aminoglycosides</b> in order to provide a critical analysis of the literature that can be a useful tool in the hands of physicians. The bibliographic search was performed electronically using PubMed, as the search engine, through July 11 th, 2008. Firstly, a Medline search was performed with the keywords "pharmacokinetics of <b>aminoglycosides</b> in neonates" with the limit of "human". Other Medline searches were performed with the keywords "pharmacokinetics of aEuro broken vertical bar in neonates" followed by the name of the aminoglycosides: amikacin, gentamicin, netilmicin and tobramycin. In addition, the book Neofax: A Manual of Drugs Used in Neonatal Care by Young and Mangum (Thomson Healthcare, 2007) was consulted. The <b>aminoglycosides</b> are mainly eliminated by the kidney, and their elimination rates are reduced at birth. As a consequence Cl is reduced and t(1 / 2) is prolonged in the neonate as compared to more mature infants. The high body-water content of the neonate results in a large Vd of <b>aminoglycosides</b> as these drugs are fairly water soluble. Postnatal development {{is an important factor in}} the maturation of the neonate, and as postnatal age proceeds, Cl of <b>aminoglycosides</b> increases. The maturation of the kidney governs the pharmacokinetics of <b>aminoglycosides</b> in the infant. Cl and t(1 / 2) are influenced by development, and this must be taken into consideration when planning a dosage regimen with <b>aminoglycosides</b> in the neonate. <b>Aminoglycosides</b> are fairly water soluble, and the larger water content of neonates yields a larger Vd in these patients...|$|R

40|$|<b>Aminoglycosides</b> {{are highly}} potent, broad-spectrum {{antibiotics}} with many desirable properties {{for the treatment}} of lifethreatening infections (28). Their history begins in 1944 with streptomycin and was thereafter marked by the successive introduction of a series of milestone compounds (kanamycin, gentamicin, and tobramycin) which definitively established the usefulness of this class of antibiotics for the treatement of gram-negative bacillary infections. In the 1970 s, the semisynthetic <b>aminoglycosides</b> dibekacin, amikacin, and netilmicin demonstrated the possibility of obtaining compounds which were active against strains that had developed resistance mechanisms towards earlier <b>aminoglycosides</b> as well as displaying distinct toxicological profiles (65).

25|$|DL-Methionine is {{sometimes}} given {{as a supplement}} to dogs; It helps to reduce the chances of stones in dogs. Methionine is also known to increase the urinary excretion of quinidine by acidifying the urine. <b>Aminoglycoside</b> antibiotics used to treat urinary tract infections work best in alkaline conditions, and urinary acidification from using methionine can reduce its effectiveness. If a dog is on a diet that acidifies the urine, methionine should not be used.|$|E
25|$|Furosemide {{should be}} used with caution when {{combined}} with corticosteroids (as this {{increases the risk of}} electrolyte imbalance), <b>aminoglycoside</b> antibiotics (increases risk of kidney or ear damage), and trimethoprim sulfa (causes decreased platelet count). It may also cause interactions with anesthesics, so its use should be related to the veterinarian if the animal is going into surgery, and it decreases the kidneys' ability to excrete aspirin, so dosages will need to be adjusted if combined with that drug.|$|E
40|$|To {{understand}} better {{the mechanisms of}} resistance-nodulation-division (RND) -type multidrug efflux pumps, we examined the Escherichia coli AcrD pump, whose typical substrates, <b>aminoglycosides,</b> {{are not expected to}} diffuse spontaneously across the lipid bilayer. The hexahistidine-tagged AcrD protein was purified and reconstituted into unilamellar proteoliposomes. Its activity was measured by the proton flux accompanying substrate transport. When the interior of the proteoliposomes was acidified, the addition of <b>aminoglycosides</b> to the external medium stimulated proton efflux and the intravesicular accumulation of radiolabeled gentamicin, suggesting that <b>aminoglycosides</b> can be captured and transported from the external medium in this system (corresponding to cytosol). This activity required the presence of AcrA within the proteoliposomes. Interestingly, the increase in proton efflux also occurred when <b>aminoglycosides</b> were present only in the intravesicular space. This result suggested that AcrD can also capture <b>aminoglycosides</b> from the periplasm to extrude them into the medium in intact cells, acting as a “periplasmic vacuum cleaner. ...|$|R

50|$|Penicillin shows a {{synergistic}} effect with <b>aminoglycosides,</b> since the inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis allows <b>aminoglycosides</b> {{to penetrate the}} bacterial cell wall more easily, allowing their disruption of bacterial protein synthesis within the cell.

25|$|A {{number of}} small {{molecules}} that aim at compensating various mutations of the CFTR gene are under development.

About 10% of CF results from a premature stop codon in the DNA, leading to early termination of protein synthesis and truncated proteins. These drugs target nonsense mutations such as G542X, which consists of the amino acid glycine in position 542 being replaced by a stop codon. <b>Aminoglycoside</b> antibiotics interfere with protein synthesis and error-correction.
