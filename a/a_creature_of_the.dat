Lerner argued that responsibility for avoiding inflation and depressions lay with the state because of its ability to create or tax away money.|$|E
25|$|The antilopine {{kangaroo}} (Macropus antilopinus) is, essentially, the far-northern {{equivalent of}} the eastern and western grey kangaroos. It is {{sometimes referred to as}} the antilopine wallaroo, but in behaviour and habitat it is more similar to red and grey kangaroos. Like them, it is <b>a</b> <b>creature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grassy plains and woodlands, and gregarious. Its name comes from its fur, which is similar in colour and texture to that of antelopes. Characteristically, the noses of males swell behind the nostrils. This enlarges nasal passages and allows them to release more heat in hot and humid climates.|$|E

25|$|The modern law of {{contract}} is primarily <b>a</b> <b>creature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> industrial revolution and the social legislation of the 20th century. However, the foundations of all European contract law are traceable to obligations in Ancient Athenian and Roman law, while the formal development of English law began after the Norman Conquest of 1066. William the Conqueror created a common law across England, but throughout the middle ages the court system was minimal. Access to the courts, in what are now considered contractual disputes, was consciously restricted to a privileged few through onerous requirements of pleading, formalities and court fees. In the local and manorial courts, according to English law's first treatise by Ranulf de Glanville in 1188, if people disputed the payment of a debt they, and witnesses, would attend court and swear oaths (called a wager of law). They risked perjury if they lost the case, and so this was strong encouragement to resolve disputes elsewhere.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Batman's {{popularity}} was waning. CBS {{was interested in}} producing a Batman in Outer Space film. Producers Benjamin Melniker and Michael E. Uslan purchased the film rights of Batman from DC Comics on October 3, 1979. It was Uslan's wish [...] "to make the definitive, dark, serious version of Batman, the way Bob Kane and Bill Finger had envisioned him in 1939. <b>A</b> <b>creature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> night; stalking criminals in the shadows." [...] Richard Maibaum was approached to write a script with Guy Hamilton to direct, but the two turned down the offer. Uslan was unsuccessful with pitching Batman to various movie studios because they wanted the film {{to be similar to}} the campy 1960s TV series. Columbia Pictures and United Artists were among those to turn down the film.|$|E
500|$|Bauer started courting her in 1903, {{but since}} they were apart most of the time, this was done by mail. Their {{relationship}} developed as they shared their dreams, aspirations, doubts and insecurities in their correspondence. For Bauer, Ellqvist became his inspiration, muse, and [...] "fairy princess"; it was as such he painted {{her for the first}} time in Sagoprinsessan (The Fairy Princess). He made sketches for the painting in 1904, and finalized them in an oil painting in 1905. Ellqvist is portrayed as a strong, enlightened and unobtainable Valkyrie. The painting was shown at Bauer's first exhibition at the Valand Academy in Gothenburg in 1905 (where he was one of eleven debutants) and in Norrköping in 1906, where it was sold to a private collector. It is now in the Jönköpings läns museum. Bauer tried to mold Ellqvist into his vision of <b>a</b> <b>creature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> woods and as the perfect artist's wife; he wanted her to make a home for them in a romantic cottage in the woods, while he wandered about the forest seeking inspiration.|$|E

500|$|After Serbia's {{victory over}} Bulgaria in Macedonia in the Balkan Wars, the [...] "Black Hand" [...] became moribund {{because of the}} death of its {{president}} and the failure to replace him, an inactive secretary, casualties, broken links between its three-man cells, and a drying up of funding. By 1914 the [...] "Black Hand" [...] was no longer operating under its constitution but rather as <b>a</b> <b>creature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chief of Serbian Military Intelligence, Apis, and its active ranks were composed mostly of Serbian officers loyal to Apis. Apis's confession to ordering the operation that begins with the phrase [...] "As the Chief of the Intelligence Department of the General Staff", the fact that the military chain of command was invoked, the moribund nature of the [...] "Black Hand" [...] and the fact that under the [...] "Black Hand" [...] constitution Article 16, such an assassination could only be ordered by a vote of the Supreme Council Directorate, the President or the Secretary and no such order was made, are factors in favor of assigning responsibility to Serbian Military Intelligence. The fact that Milan Ciganović was involved, that the key officers involved were [...] "Black Hand" [...] members, that [...] "Black Hand" [...] Provincial Director for Bosnia and Herzegovina Vladimir Gaćinović was consulted {{and that there was no}} official budget for the operation favors assigning responsibility to the [...] "Black Hand".|$|E
500|$|Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out New York {{referred}} {{to being a}} [...] "must-see danceumentary." [...] Rothkopf described Jackson as [...] "obviously" [...] having been [...] "shooting for the moon right before his death" [...] {{based on what he}} could tell from the [...] "stunning bits of concert spectacle" [...] of [...] "phalanxes of computer-generated dancers, tempo changes on a dime, a bombshell of a blond guitarist who plays Eddie Van Halen's [...] "Beat It" [...] solo flawlessly". Rothkopf stated that: [...] "But the true value of this raw rehearsal footage is its emphasis, less known, on MJ's laserlike attention to detail, as he works his band and troupe up to speed. A firm floor manager himself, he's often exposed — and probably wouldn't have approved of this film. (One on one, High School Musicals Kenny Ortega, meanwhile, treats him with kid gloves: [...] "I agree, Michael.") But to see him sweetly lose himself in [...] "Human Nature" [...] ("I like living this way...") is to feel <b>a</b> <b>creature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stage finally returned home, and possibly on the cusp of redemption." [...] Peter Paras, of E! Online felt that watching Jackson and his performances in a positive aspect is the [...] "genius and the sadness of the entire film." [...] He did note that Jackson's performance of [...] "Earth Song," [...] which consists of using Jackson's voiceover to emphasize his environmental concerns while a bulldozer threatens to eat him, was well-intentioned — because it brought attention to environmental concerns — but felt it was a little over the top. Paras felt the film showed an [...] "exacting and refreshingly funny side of Jackson to be revealed" [...] and [...] "had Jackson lived, we never would have seen those moments" [...] and felt the film was a proper way to [...] "finally say goodbye" [...] to Jackson.|$|E

50|$|A much celebrated {{wildlife}} artist, John Busby {{was also}} a dedicated landscape painter whose work was often executed in bold colours, in styles ranging from highly representational to near abstract. Looking at the work, particular themes emerge. Views <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land from above - a bird’s eye view - seemed to fascinate him and <b>the</b> expansiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sky also held great appeal, becoming very nearly <b>the</b> sole subject <b>of</b> some paintings. Of course, wildlife is the thread that connects these paintings to <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> John’s oeuvre. <b>As</b> <b>creatures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land and sky, birds do feature in many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> paintings and it’s clear that <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> habitat and territory was a rich seam of study. One long running series was <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rockpools at Tyninghame in East Lothian. <b>The</b> interplay <b>of</b> shapes, whether of man-made irrigation circles or transient cloudscapes featured often. 'Landscape in a Granite Rock II' was recreated as a tapestry by the Dovecot Studios in Edinburgh.|$|R

In this essay, I critique Douthat’sclaims as a misunderstanding of pantheism and a symptom of conservative Christianfear that environmentalism is crypto-paganism.

2500|$|India {{provides}} an example of the British Empire pouring its money and expertise into a very well built system designed for military reasons (after the Mutiny of 1857), with the hope that it would stimulate industry. The system was overbuilt and too expensive for the small amount of freight traffic it carried. [...] Christensen (1996), who looked at colonial purpose, local needs, capital, service, and private-versus-public interests, concluded that making the railways <b>a</b> <b>creature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state hindered success because railway expenses had to go through the same time-consuming and political budgeting process as did all other state expenses. Railway costs could therefore not be tailored to the timely needs of the railways or their passengers.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{numerous}} literary figures featured in Russell Kirk's The Conservative Mind (1953), including James Fenimore Cooper, Nathaniel Hawthorne, James Russell Lowell, W. H.

Kirk was also known himself as a writer of supernatural and suspense fiction with a distinct Gothic flair.

Kirk was also good friends with many literary figures of the 20th century: T. S.
