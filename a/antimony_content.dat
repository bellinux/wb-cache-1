In the second stage, at over 377 °C, sarabauite and native gold develop. Calcite, stibnite, and senarmontite also form during the second stage as the mineralization cools further to 377-194 °C.

The antimony deposits are mainly in Sambagawa metamorphic rocks and the brecciated rocks (Ichinokawa breccia) formed through a hydro-fracturing process associated with hydrothermal fluid related to Tertiary igneous activity around the area. <b>Antimony</b> <b>content</b> in stream water around the mine was extremely high (over 200 2 ̆ 6 #;g/L), which indicates that antimony dissolves into the water from the country rocks by chemical weathering. We examined the antimony contents in variously weathered and altered country rocks in the streambed, to understand the transfer of the element into the stream water. Consequently, <b>antimony</b> <b>content</b> in brown-colored, strongly weathered and altered part of the rocks was higher than that in the unweathered (or weakly weathered) part. The <b>antimony</b> <b>content</b> in strongly weathered part was several tens to hundreds ppm, although the content in unweathered part was significantly low, sometimes under the detection of XRF. This may indicate that the antimony in the stream water is adsorbed selectively in the strongly weathered and altered part of the streambed rock. The strongly weathered and altered rocks contain many iron hydroxides, which may trap antimony ion from the water. A similar phenomenon was observed in the other area.

40|$|Part of the {{northern}} Palatinate region in Germany is characterized by elevated levels of arsenic and antimony in the soil due {{to the presence of}} ore sources and former mining activities. In a biomonitoring study, 218 residents were investigated for a putative increased intake of these elements. Seventy-six nonexposed subjects in a rural region in south lower Saxony were chosen as the reference group. Urine and scalp hair samples were obtained as surrogates to determine the internal exposures to arsenic and antimony. The analyses were performed using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry except for arsenic in urine, which was determined by the hydride technique. This method does not detect organoarsenicals from seafood, which are not toxicologically relevant. In {{the northern}} Palatinate subjects, slightly elevated arsenic contents in urine and scalp hair (presumably not hazardous) could be correlated with an increased arsenic content in the soil. On the other hand, the results did not show a correlation between the <b>antimony</b> <b>contents</b> in the soil of the housing area and those in urine and hair. Except for antimony in scalp hair, age tended to be associated with internal exposures to arsenic and antimony in both study groups. Consumption of seafood had a slight impact on the level of urinary arsenic, which is indicative of the presence of low quantities of inorganic arsenicals and dimethylarsinic acid in seafood. The arsenic and <b>antimony</b> <b>contents</b> in scalp hair were positively correlated with the 24 -hr arsenic excretion in urine. However, antimony in scalp hair was not correlated with seafood consumption as was arsenic in scalp hair and in urine. This indicated the existence of unidentified common pathways of exposure contributing to the alimentary body burden. Short time peaks in the 24 -hr excretion of arsenic in urine, which could not be assigned to a high consumption of seafood, were detected for six study participants.

40|$|Study of {{the spatial}} and mineralogical {{distribution}} {{of gold and}} silver in the Rosebery north end orebody indicates that both silver and gold are concentrated in massive sphalerite-galena-pyrite ore and barite mineralization. Six styles of gold mineralization have been recognized: (1) in massive sphalerite-galena-pyrite ore (the dominant occurrence), (2) in massive barite mineralization, (3) in the upper parts of pyrite-chalcopyrite pods (in general, pyrite-chalcopyrite pods are gold poor), (4) in distal pyrite mineralization (at the edges of sphalerite-galena-pyrite mineralization and in the overlying host rocks), (5) in footwall mineralization (poorly sampled and understood), and (6) in remobilized quartz-carbonate veins. Mineralogically, gold occurs as electrum which is commonly associated with pyrite in sphalerite-galena-pyrite ore and distal pyrite mineralization. A lesser association of gold with tetrahedrite has been noted by Brathwaite (1969). The grain size of electrum has a lognormal distribution, with most grains having dimensions of less than 25 mu m. Silver occurs dominantly in tetrahedrite, {{and to a lesser}} extent, in galena (Henley and Steveson, 1978).

40|$|The {{metamorphic}} rocks of the Archcan Gwanda greenstone belt of southwestern Zim-babwe consist of mafic to felsic volcanics with intercalated sedimentary units among which banded iron-formations host {{a large number}} of gold occurrences. The studied Vubachikwe and Bar 20 mines are 8 km apart and occur in the northwestern end of the greenstone belt. The mineralization has been affected by regional greenschist facies metamorphism increas-ing in grade from southeast o northwest. Host rocks and ores were deformed by an early tensional phase and two fold phases. Arsenopyrite geothermometry ielded metamorphic recrystallization temperatures of 380 ø to 500 øC for the ores. Two types of gold mineralization are distinguished in the studied area: (1) stratiform mineralization constituting a mixed carbonate-sulfide facies type of banded iron-formation, and (2) discordant vein-type mineralization. Generally both ore types are dominated by arsenopyrite. Gold occurs in particulate form and also as microscopic to submicroscopic inclusions in arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite, and other sulfides. Geochemical studies indicate a volcanic origin for the banded iron-formation and establish a close correlation between their gold, arsenic, and <b>antimony</b> <b>contents.</b> It is concluded that synsedimentary processes laid down the stratiform gold mineraliza-tion by hydrothermal fluids which discharged into restricted marine basins at periods of waning volcanic activity.

The Sb concentration in plants is highly correlated with the concentration of total, soluble and extractable Sb in the soil, while {{the ability of the}} species to concentrate antimony is correlated only with the concentration of extractable Sb. Accumulation in roots is most responsive to the increase of available antimony in soils passing from the cultivated sampling sites to the mineral processing tailing pond. The most common site of Sb accumulation in the plant shifts from the roots to the leaves as the Sb content in the soil increases. Nevertheless, it appears to be largely species-specific. Antimony levels are high in plants from the tailing pond, above 1000 mg/kg in some wild species (Achillea ageratum, Silene vulgaris and Plantago lanceolata), while they are very low in crops and vegetables. Plant species traits, such as root morphology, life span, habitus and systematic rank, are important, although their influence is not statistically significant. All the plant species with the highest concentrations of antimony are herbaceous, almost all Dicotyledones, tap-rooted and mostly perennials, composites and legumes.

Four rice plots with different rotation systems were investigated from seedling time to harvesting; sampling of soils (0 – 30 cm) and plants was carried out 4 times during growing season (three replicates). Rice plants were separated into the roots, stems, leaves and grains, and then oven-dried. Chemical and physical analyses were carried out at the Soil Science Lab of the University of Bologna and Venice, respectively. The results obtained point to a land with high soil contamination by Li and TI. The total concentrations of most studied metals (Al, As, Be, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, Sb, Sn, Sr, V, Zn) in the soil samples fell in the natural geochemical background concentration levels, even though the concentration levels of some of them (e. g. Sn) overcame the Italian threshold limits for green areas (DM 152 / 2006). Most elements are likely associated with the geochemistry of the parent material. <b>Antimony</b> and Ti <b>contents</b> in soils are positively correlated with soil pH, while As, Be, Fe, Li, Sb, Ti, Tl and Zn are negatively correlated with organic matter content. With the exception of strontium, soil metals are always correlated between variable couples. Heavy metals in plants {{vary according to the}} sampling season, texture and moisture, and soil pH. Most non-essential trace elements are accumulated in rice roots and, only in cases of essential micronutrients, in leaves.

The results of multiple linear regression analysis showed that soil extractable P and total Ca {{played an important role in}} predicting annual grain yield of rice. The average translocation of metals from the soil to the root was found to be N 1, irrespective of the essential/not essential function; conversely, only essential elements (Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn) are translocated rather easily from the roots to leaves (TF ≤ 1) via xylem, and very little are translocated to grains (TF ≪ 1).

These parameters are compared in each soil {{and related to}} selected soil properties and leachant solution pH to identify factors that influence the mobilisation of antimony in soils. Total element concentrations are determined in soils using an evaluated Mg(N 03) 2 ashing technique and highly elevated concentrations (up to 8202 mg kgˉ¹ antimony) are measured in soils formed {{on the surface of}} spoil heaps at these sites. A stream system bisects a spoil heap at one of these sites and elevated antimony concentrations (up to 22. 5 ng mlˉ¹) are observed in these waters suggesting the influence of leaching processes. Antimony's solid state partitioning is investigated in soils using a previously reported five-step low temperature sequential chemical leaching method. Largest proportions of antimony are extracted in the 'Ca-associated' (6. 1 - 11. 6 % of the total) soil fraction and the 'Fe- and Organic-Fe associated' soil fraction (5. 0 - 8. 7 % of the total). However, low extraction efficiency is observed for the sum of the five leaching steps and 73. 8 - 83, 3 % of the total antimony is partitioned in the residual soil fraction. Short term, long term and pH-dependant antimony leaching is investigated in selected contaminated soils using laboratory-based batch tests. Antimony leaching is shown to be influenced significantly by the total antimony soil concentration, leachant solution pH and L:S leaching ratio and these observations are apparent despite notable variations in soil pH and organic matter <b>content.</b> <b>Antimony</b> leaching is most significant in soils that contain highest total antimony concentrations although increased antimony leaching is observed as the L:S ratio is increased and/or the leachant solution pH is increased from pH 4. 0 to pH 10. Aqueous antimony speciation is determined in soil leachates and surface waters using HPLC-ICP-MS methodologies and the influence of selected soil properties is examined with respect to the resultant leachate antimony speciation. Novel HPLC separations are developed using Phenomenex SAX-SB and Alltec HAAX stationary phases in conjunction with ammonium tartrate mobile phases to facilitate the simultaneous separation and quantification of inorganic SbIII, inorganic SbV and organic SbV species. These methodologies achieve detection limits for species in the pg mlˉ¹ to low ng mlˉ¹ range to enable quantitative analysis of contaminated leachates and surface waters. Inorganic SbV species are found to be predominant in the surface water and soil leachate samples despite notable variations in soil pH and organic matter content. These data show good agreement with thermodynamic predictions. Inorganic SbV species are generally accepted to exhibit 10 times lower toxicity than inorganic SbIII species and potential for antimony toxicity at these sites may be reduced due to the intrinsic elemental speciation.

40|$|The work {{described}} in this paper is designed to use the very high analytical sensitivity of neutron-activation analysis. The <b>antimony</b> <b>content</b> of individual organs and pieces of organs have been analysed {{as part of an}} investigation of the chemotherapy of schistosomiasis. The results illustrate the great, and as yet relatively unapplied, value of this technique in dealing with the investigation of trace elements in biological systems. Values such as those given form firm bases on which further studies can be built and show that the single animal has the same metabolic reactions as those deduced from bulked samples, but of course with individual variations...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} on investigation {{the possibility}} of electrolytic treatment the sulphur acidic waste solution, obtained in the conventional electrolytic copper refining process. The copper anodes with non-standard nickel, lead, tin and <b>antimony</b> <b>content</b> were specially prepared for the refining process. Nickel content of all anodes was approximately 7. 5 mass %, {{and the content of}} lead, tin and antimony was varied. It was observed, that anodes with O 2 content lower than 200 ppm, were not passivated. Results, obtained using the standard electrochemical techniques, have indicated that the anodes with non-standard chemical composition could be used under the same conditions {{as well as in the}} conventional copper refining process...|$|E
40|$|Antimony {{trioxide}} (Sb 2 O 3) is {{the most}} frequently used catalyst in the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) manufacture. As a result, antimony is incorporated into PET bottles at concentration level of 100 - 300 mg/kg. PET containers are used for drinking water and beverages, as well as food packaging and in the pharmaceutical industry. Thus, {{it is important to understand}} the factors that may influence the release of antimony from the catalysts into water and other products, since antimony is potentially toxic trace element. In this paper, the <b>antimony</b> <b>content</b> in nine brands of bottled mineral and spring water from Serbia, and seven brands of bottled mineral and spring water from EU countries was analyzed. The measurements were conducted using the inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) technique. In the all examined samples the antimony concentration was bellow the maximum contaminant level of 5 μg/L prescribed by the Serbian and EU regulations. Comparison of the content of antimony in PET bottled waters with the content of antimony in water bottled commercially in glass and the natural content of antimony in pristine groundwaters, provides explicit evidence of antimony leaching from PET containers. Since waters bottled in PET have much greater concentration ratio of Sb to Pb than corresponding pristine groundwaters, it can be assumed that bottled waters cannot be used as the relavant source for the study of the natural <b>antimony</b> <b>content</b> in groundwaters. There is a clear relation between the quality of water in bottles (composition, ion strength) and antimony leaching rate. Moreover, while the rate of antimony leaching is slow at temperatures below 60 oC, at the temperature range of 60 - 80 oC antimony release occurs and reaches maximum contaminant level rapidly. As antimony can cause both acute and chronic health problems, factors that promote the increase of antimony concentration should be avoided...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAntimony-doped {{tin oxide}} (ATO) {{nanoceramics}} used for sputtering targets are successfully prepared by spark plasma sintering (SPS) technology using commercial ATO nanoparticles with particle size of 10 – 15 nm. The effect of sintering temperature on the microstructure and electrical {{property of the}} obtained ATO nanoceramics is investigated. By means of XPS, the Sb 5 +/Sb 3 + ratio of ATO nanoceramics sintered at different temperatures is determined. The results suggest that when the sintering temperature is 1000 °C, ATO nanoceramics show a density of 97. 2 % and electrical resistivity of 7. 9 × 10 − 2 Ωcm which attribute to an elevated Sb 5 +/Sb 3 + ratio. The main mechanism of conduction is explained through the carrier concentration determined on the <b>antimony</b> <b>content</b> and its oxidation state in the tin oxide lattice...|$|E
40|$|Antimony bullion {{of several}} compositons was {{electrolytically}} refined in electrolyte composed of antimony trifluoride and sulfuric acid at current densities up to 20 amp. /ft. ~ (2. 2 amp. /dm. ~). The effects of electrolyte circulation and {{of variation in}} the <b>antimony</b> <b>content</b> of the electrolyte were studied. The cathode-current efficiency was about 99 %, and the deposits stripped well. Most of the copper, arsenic, and bismuth in the bullion went into the refined metal, and when the bullion contained sulfur and arsenic more than 99 % of the gold and silver was recovered in the slimes. When the electrolyte contained insufficient antimony, the deposits were rough and loose. Copper and silver can be {{kept out of the}} refined metal by circulating the electrolyte through a cementation tank containing finely divided antimony...|$|E
40|$|A {{geochemical survey}} on mine wastes, fresh waters and biota, {{carried out in}} the Monti Romani zone, reveals heavy Sb-(As-Hg) {{pollution}} in an area between the Tafone and Chiarone fluvial basins. In the Tafone stream there is a steep increase of the <b>antimony</b> <b>content</b> in water downstream of mine wastes as far as the mouth, with peak levels of the dissolved element. The waters of Tafone Lake also exhibit heavy antimony pollution and ichthyofauna have high levels of both Sb and Hg in muscle tissue. Wild and cultivated species of plants, collected in the neighborhood of mining areas, often present anomalous contents of these heavy elements. The environmental damage turns out to be closely linked to the wastes of mining and smelting activities and can be attributed largely to the cessation of mining works without any appropriate reclamation program...|$|E
