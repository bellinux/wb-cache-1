In some buildings however, in particular in Singapore, rooms are often ventilated with two or more units and present large recirculation rates.

Densified woody biomass, birch, in form of pellets with a diameter of 8 mm and a length between 5 and 15 mm {{has been used as}} a raw material for batch autothermal gasification using air as an oxidation agent. The main objectives were to study the effect of the treatment conditions on the distribution of the products and the composition of product gas to establish the suitability of the gasifier to produce combustible gas with sufficiently high calorific value.

40|$|Quantification {{of natural}} {{ventilation}} rates {{is an important}} issue in HVAC system design. Natural ventilation in buildings depends on many parameters whose uncertainty varies significantly, and hence the results from a standard deterministic simulation approach could be unreliable and provide {{a false sense of security}} that natural ventilation will supply adequate amounts of fresh air. This study performed an uncertainty analysis to predict natural <b>airflow</b> <b>rates.</b> The paper presents relevant uncertainty in model and input parameters such as meteorological data, building properties (leakage areas of windows, doors, etc.), etc. Uncertainties of the aforementioned parameters were quantified based on data available from literature and on-site visits. The Monte-Carlo method with Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) was used for uncertainty propagation. The CONTAMW was chosen to simulate natural ventilation phenomena in a high-rise apartment building that is typical of residential buildings in Korea. It is shown that the uncertainty propagated through this process is not negligible and may significantly influence the prediction of the <b>airflow</b> <b>rates.</b> In the paper, the result of a sensitivity analysis is also addressed. Practical application: The paper describes a probablistic approach to predict the natural <b>airflow</b> <b>rates</b> of high-rise apartment buildings under uncertainty and could eventually replace the current conventional deterministic approach. ...|$|R

The objective of the present work was to study the mitigation of air pollutants at welding stations, using different ventilation scenarios.

Meantime, face velocity, volumetric <b>airflow</b> <b>rates,</b> duct velocity, static, and velocity pressures at different locations of the ventilation systems were also measured using BS 1042 standard methods. The paired t-test revealed that with p< 0. 05 {{there was a significant}} difference between occupational exposure to air pollutants in 4 different ventilation scenarios.
