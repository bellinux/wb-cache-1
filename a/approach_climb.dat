It, like Lonesome Lake hut, is notable as a [...] "family" [...] hut due to its low altitude and relatively easy <b>approach</b> <b>climb.</b> It also has the lowest capacity of all the huts, sleeping {{little more than a}} third of the largest capacity hut. Zealand is neighbored by Galehead to the south and Mizpah Spring to the north.|$|E
5000|$|During the 1960s, Boeing {{introduced}} the 737, and Douglas {{introduced the}} DC-9, the original models of each being for shorter routes; the 105% figure {{was not an}} issue, thus they had no fuel dump systems installed. During the 1960s and 1970s, both Boeing and Douglas [...] "grew" [...] their respective aircraft as far as operational capabilities were concerned via Pratt & Whitney's development of increasingly powerful variants of the JT8D engines that powered both aircraft series. Both aircraft were now capable of longer duration flights, with increased weight limits, and complying with the existing 105% rule became problematic due to {{the costs associated with}} adding a fuel dump system to aircraft in production. Considering the more powerful engines that had been developed, the FAA changed the rules to delete the 105% requirement, and FAR 25.1001 was enacted stating a jettison system was not required if the climb requirements of FAR 25.119 (Landing Climb) and FAR 25.121 (<b>Approach</b> <b>Climb)</b> could be met, assuming a 15-minute flight. In other words, for a go-around with full landing flaps and all engines operating, and at approach flap setting and one engine inoperative, respectively.|$|E

50|$|The east {{approach}} {{began in}} the middle of the street just west of Franklin St. The track descended and was covered. Under the river the tunnel had two horse and one pedestrian lanes. West of the river the <b>approach</b> <b>climbed</b> and the track came to street level just east of Clinton. The tunnel, including the approaches, was 1,605 ft long.|$|R
5000|$|The north {{approach}} {{began in}} the middle of the street just north of Hubbard St. (Michigan St. in 1871). The track descended and the approach was covered. Under the river the tunnel had two horse and one pedestrian masonry arch lanes. South of the river the <b>approach</b> <b>climbed</b> and the track came to street level just north of Randolph St. The tunnel, including the approaches, was 1,887 ft long.|$|R
40|$|The wake of {{wide body}} {{aircraft}} is a hazard to following aircraft in <b>approach,</b> <b>climb,</b> and cruise. Thus, {{a large amount of}} experimental research effort has been devoted to instability and breakdown of vortices. However, investigations of the instabilities of vortices in the wake far field very often are lacking the link to the near field and are inconclusive as to the aerodynamic, whereas investigations of the wake in a wind tunnel very often miss the link to the mid- and far field at a sufficiently high Reynolds-number. For this reason, the wake of an Airbus A- 300 with different flap settings was investigated in a joint ONERA/DLR-project in the catapult of ONERA Lille. The Particle Image Velocimetry was chosen as a non-intrusive testing technique. In a particular setting of the landing flaps, a premature breakdown of the vortex cores was observed. The origin of the breakdown was understood as a Raylleigh-Ludwieg instability, which occurs if destabilising centrifugal forces dominate stabilising pressure forces...|$|E
40|$|Advanced {{studies have}} been {{undertaken}} using multidisciplinary design optimization on the retrofitting of an outboard morphing-wing system to an existing conventionally designed commercial passenger jet. Initial studies focusing on the single objective of specific air range improvement {{for a number of}} flight phases revealed increases of approximately 4 – 5 % over the baseline aircraft with wing fences across each case. This validated the advantage of reoptimizing the geometric schedules for off-design conditions in comparison with fixed winglets, for which negative effects were observed. Because of the high number of design sensitivities of the outboard wing geometry, it has now become necessary to conduct refined studies to analyze the effects of the wing system on additional operational performance metrics, such as takeoff, initial climb, <b>approach</b> <b>climb,</b> and landing performance parameters, to ascertain a truly holistic representation of the benefits of morphing-wing technology. In addition, further effort has been expended to couple the effects of each phase within a multi-objective framework. Thus, refined {{studies have been}} performed, incorporating a number of multi-objective optimization methods into a high-end, low-fidelity aerostructural-control analysis together with a full engine model and integrated operational performance algorithm. Furthermore, updated aeroelastic functionality and improved aerostructural wing sizing allows for investigation of C-wing configurations. Results reveal the potential for significant field-length reductions and climb-performance enhancements while maintaining improvements in cruise performance throughout the entire flight envelope and across multiple stage lengths...|$|E

50|$|The lightest {{of these}} bridges, without decking, are {{suitable}} for use only by pedestrians. Light bridges with decking, and sufficient tension that crossing the bridge does not <b>approach</b> <b>climbing,</b> may be used also by pack horses (and other animals), equestrians, and bicycle riders. To walk a lighter bridge of this type at a reasonable pace requires a particular gliding step, as the more normal walking step will induce traveling waves that can cause the traveler to pitch (uncomfortably) up and down or side-to-side. The exception is a stabilized bridge, which may be quite stable.|$|R

50|$|The east {{approach}} {{began at}} Franklin St. Unlike the city-owned tunnels, it didn't {{go under the}} street itself, but 150 feet north of and parallel to it. This meant the cars had to slow down, turn north on Franklin, then immediately turn west into a driveway to the approach. It was a stone walled 30 ft wide ramp which descended at 12% for 150 ft before being covered under an alley. As the shortest tunnel it had the steepest grade. Under the river the tunnel had a single two-lane arched roof. West of the river the <b>approach</b> <b>climbed</b> to Clinton St. where the line had to turn south. Because of the entrances and steep approaches the tunnel always had operating problems. The tunnel, including the approaches, was 1,514 ft long as built.|$|R

40|$|A {{computationally}} efficient, semiempirical noise model {{suitable for}} maneuvering flight noise prediction {{is used to}} evaluate the community noise impact of practical variations on several helicopter flight procedures typical of normal operations. Turns, "quick-stops," <b>approaches,</b> <b>climbs,</b> and combinations of these maneuvers are assessed. Relatively small variations in flight procedures are shown to cause significant changes to Sound Exposure Levels over a wide area. Guidelines are developed for helicopter pilots intended to provide effective strategies for reducing the negative effects of helicopter noise on the community. Finally, direct optimization of flight trajectories is conducted to identify low noise optimal flight procedures and quantify the magnitude of community noise reductions that can be obtained through tailored helicopter flight procedures. Physically realizable optimal turns and approaches are identified that achieve global noise reductions of as much as 10 dBA Sound Exposure Level...|$|R

5000|$|The A5 Trunk road runs {{across the}} summit of Brockley Hill using the same {{alignment}} of the highway (also known as Watling Street) built by the Romans in the 1st century AD. The southerly <b>approach</b> <b>climbs</b> to a height of 70 m in a distance of 1400 m from the junction of Spur Road, Edgware. The area might be the location of Sulloniacis, a way point for the Cursus publicus (Roman Imperial mail service).

Although both sections of Roman road approaching Brockley Hill are straight, a direct course across the summit was abandoned in favour of a double-bend alignment. This was employed to alleviate ascent of the hill because of the steepness in the terrain.|$|R
