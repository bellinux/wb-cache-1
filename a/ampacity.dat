This paper describes the test program and preliminary results obtained on a 400 kV test installation, including various methods of cable installation, different kinds of temperature sensors and {{the implementation of a}} real time monitoring system. Simulation of different operating scenarios (steady-state and transient overloading) was performed and the resulting <b>ampacities</b> were evaluated.

40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{conducted}} research {{to determine the}} relationship between cur-rent load and temperature rises in coal mine trailing cables. Six low-voltage, unshielded, portable power cables were continuously and intermittently loaded with direct current of various magnitudes. Temperature rises within and on the cables were measured with thermocouples, and the data were recorded with a computer. Thermal time constants were calculated, which fixed the periods of the duty-cycle tests. Relationships between average temperature at the conductor-insulation interface and current load were established. The steady-state and intermittent currents that produce a 9020 C average conductor-insulation temperature were then determined. Comparisons with Insulated Cable Engineers Association (ICE A) steady-state ratings revealed that 10 to 25 pct more current than recommended ICEA <b>ampacities</b> is required to reach rated insulation temperature. Examination of the maximum intermittent temperatures attained showed that autoignition of coal dust and burn injuries to personnel handling the cable would not be concerns if the temperature at the conductor-insulation interface averaged 9020 C...|$|R
2500|$|For a given load, sizing of a {{smoothing}} capacitor is a tradeoff between reducing ripple voltage and increasing ripple current. The peak current is {{set by the}} rate of rise of the supply voltage on the rising edge of the incoming sine-wave, reduced by {{the resistance of the}} transformer windings. [...] High ripple currents increase I2R losses (in the form of heat) in the capacitor, rectifier and transformer windings, and may exceed the <b>ampacity</b> of the components or VA rating of the transformer. [...] Vacuum tube rectifiers specify the maximum capacitance of the input capacitor, and SS diode rectifiers also have current limitations. [...] Capacitors for this application need low ESR, or ripple current may overheat them. [...] To limit ripple voltage to a specified value the required capacitor size is proportional to the load current and inversely proportional to the supply frequency and the number of output peaks of the rectifier per input cycle. Full-wave rectified output requires a smaller capacitor because it is double the frequency of half-wave rectified output. [...] To reduce ripple to a satisfactory limit with just a single capacitor would often require a capacitor that's infeasibly large.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ampacity</b> is a {{portmanteau}} for ampere capacity {{defined by}} National Electrical Safety Codes, in some North American countries. <b>Ampacity</b> {{is defined as}} the maximum amount of electric current a conductor or device can carry before sustaining immediate or progressive deterioration.Also described as current rating or current-carrying capacity, <b>ampacity</b> is the RMS electric current which a device or conductor can continuously carry while remaining within its temperature rating.|$|E

40|$|In power {{distribution}} system planning, {{it is essential to}} understand the impacts that electric vehicles (EVs), and the non-linear, time-variant loading profiles associated with their charging units, may have on {{power distribution}} networks. This research presents a design methodology for the creation of both analytical and behavioral models for EV charging units within a VHDL-AMS simulation environment. Voltage and current data collected from Electric Avenue, located on the Portland State University campus, were used to create harmonic profiles of the EV charging units at the site. From these profiles, generalized models for both single-phase (Level 2) and three-phase (Level 3) EV chargers were created. Further, these models were validated within a larger system context utilizing the IEEE 13 -bus distribution test feeder system. Results from the model 2 ̆ 7 s validation are presented for various charger and power system configurations. Finally, an online tool that was created for use by distribution system designers is presented.

40|$|A muscial {{tesla coil}} {{is a form}} of {{transformer}} which at high frequency transforms a low primary voltage into a considerably higher secondary voltage that results in discharges. These discharges can be modulated into musical tones by turning on and off the tesla coil with the frequency of the tones. In order to construct a musical tesla coil with variable discharge rate a Dual Resonant Solid State Tesla Coil was created. The resonant frequency of the primary circuit was matched to the frequency of the secondary circuit, which was measured to 121 kHz. This was achived by the usage of capacitors connected in series with the primary coil. The primary coil was shaped as a flat Archimedian spiral with the ability of frequency tuning by moving its variable connection point. The resonant frequency signal was generated by a Phase Locked Loop, which received the oscillation frequency from the tesla coil through an antenna and created a square wave with the same frequency. The resonant frequency was combined, through a network of AND-gates, with the tone signal from an Arduino, which in turn was controlled by a software client written in C#. The client decoded. midi-files into an array of tones whose frequency was sent to the Ardunio. The Arduino shut off and turned on the tesla coil with the same frequency as the tone and thus creating an audible tone. An H-bridge was utilized to create an AC-voltage using the control signal together with a DC-source. The <b>ampacities</b> of the H-bridge was however the limiting factor of the magnitude of the discharges which could be generated. At 100 A through the primary coil, electrical discharges of 11. 5 cm in length could be generated which could play musical pieces...|$|R
40|$|Grid-scale {{integration}} {{of renewable energy}} sources and smart grid devices has created new demands in flexible power conversion. State-of-the-art semiconductor power switches present limitations in power handling capability, as well as forward and reverse breakdown voltages. Superconducting materials are a viable alternative due to their robustness against high <b>ampacities,</b> large electric fields and abrupt changes in power flow. This work pays focus to material testing and apparatus design for an antenna-coupled cryotron (ACC), which is a superconducting power switch. Design, fabrication and testing are examined for a longitudinal resonant cavity, paired with monopole transmit and modified slot receive antennae. These couple radio frequency (RF) energy into superconducting thin film niobium (Nb) carrying high current densities (∼ 105 A/cm 2), thereby creating an antenna-coupled cryotron. Induced electromagnetic field effects at the receive antenna alter superconductive fluid dynamics. The theorized quality in manipulating this mechanism is a rapid normal-conductivity transition (µs), which affects a switch 2 ̆ 2 off 2 ̆ 2 state. Functional evaluation of the device as a waveguide revealed evanescent mode resonance at frequencies below the waveguide cut-off of ∼ 18 GHz. The thin film Nb was deposited on a quartz dielectric, which penetrated the waveguide and supported evanescent resonances within the structure. Altered resistivity and critical transition-point properties emerged from device testing at applied RF. When the Nb film temperature-dependent coherence length was comparable to its thickness, perpendicular magnetic field application generated an Abrikosov vortex state, energetically favoring a mixed domain condensate. Interaction of the magnetically-induced flux vortex lattice with Lorentz current forces gave rise to resistive changes within the metal. Three resistive transition mechanisms developed: a latch to normal state resistance, attributed to cooper-pair destruction avalanche induced near critical transition points; a small reversible increase in resistance (∼mV), arising from flux-flow within an intermediate state at peak resonance; as well as temporal alterations in superfluid dynamics from disequilibrium in the quasi-particle population. The RF induced superfluid effects were observable in separate terms of electric and thermodynamic fluctuations. Motivation for this work is the eventual design of a high voltage, high current and low cost power switch, able to function where existing semiconductor technology fails. Concentration is paid to the fundamental theory, physics and methodology in conceptual testing and design of prototype ACCs. Assessment focuses on preliminary findings and concludes with next stage design requirements...|$|R

50|$|From {{the basic}} {{principles}} that electric current leads to thermal heating and thermal power transfer to the ambient environment requires some temperature difference, {{it follows that the}} current leads to a temperature rise in the conductors. The <b>ampacity,</b> or maximum allowable current, of an electric power cable depends on the allowable temperatures of the cable and any adjacent materials such as insulation or termination equipment. For insulated cables, the insulation maximum temperature is normally the limiting material property that constrains <b>ampacity.</b> For uninsulated cables (typically used in overhead installation), the tensile strength of the cable (as affected by temperature) is normally the limiting material property. The Neher-McGrath method is the electrical industry standard for calculating cable <b>ampacity,</b> most often employed via lookup in tables of precomputed results for common configurations.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ampacity</b> {{derating}} {{refers to}} {{the reduction of the}} ability of a cable to conduct electricity. It can be tested through the use of IEEE 848 Standard Procedure for the Determination of the <b>Ampacity</b> Derating of Fire-Protected Cables. The more one insulates a conductor, the less current it can conduct without damage from overheating. The result of the test referenced herein is quantified in terms of percentage. If a cable is derated by 30%, {{it can be used to}} conduct only 70% as much current, thus cable of greater cross sectional area is often needed to conduct a given amount of power. The use of intumescent [...] "windows", which shut in case of a fire, can reduce or negate the effect of <b>ampacity</b> derating, subject to listing and approval use and compliance.|$|E

The paper described two-dimensional highly symmetric simplified calculations which have {{formed the basis for}} many cable application guidelines and regulations.

50|$|The PWM {{duty cycle}} of the 1 kHz CP signal {{indicates}} the maximum allowed mains current. According to the SAE it includes socket outlet, cable and vehicle inlet. In the US, {{the definition of the}} <b>ampacity</b> (ampere capacity, or current capacity) is split for continuous and short term operation. The SAE defines the <b>ampacity</b> value to be derived by a formula based on the 1 ms full cycle (of the 1 kHz signal) with the maximum continuous ampere rating being 0.6 A per 10 µs (with the lowest 100 µs giving 6 A and the highest 800 µs giving 48 A).|$|E
50|$|Due {{to higher}} {{hysteresis}} {{losses in the}} steel and associated heating of the core, an odd-layer design will have a lower <b>ampacity</b> rating (up to a 10% de-rate) than an equivalent even-layer design.|$|E

50|$|The {{challenges}} {{posed by}} the complexity of estimating RCA and of estimating the local increase in ambient temperature obtained by co-locating many cables (in a duct bank) create a market niche in the electric power industry for software dedicated to <b>ampacity</b> estimation.|$|E
50|$|For {{electronic}} components (such as transistors, voltage regulators, and the like), the term current rating is more-commonly used than <b>ampacity,</b> but the considerations are broadly similar. However the tolerance of short-term overcurrent is near zero for semiconductor devices, as their thermal capacities are extremely small.|$|E
50|$|The <b>ampacity</b> for a {{conductor}} {{is based on}} physical and electrical properties of the material and construction of the conductor and of its insulation, ambient temperature, and environmental conditions adjacent to the conductor.

50|$|Some wires have a {{mechanical}} covering with no voltage rating—e.g.: service-drop, welding, doorbell, thermostat wire. An insulated wire or cable has a voltage {{rating and a}} maximum conductor temperature rating. It may not have an <b>ampacity</b> (current-carrying capacity) rating, since this is dependent upon the surrounding environment (e.g. ambient temperature).|$|E
5000|$|Bundled {{conductors}} cool {{themselves more}} efficiently {{due to the}} increased surface area of the conductors, further reducing line losses. When transmitting alternating current, bundle conductors also avoid the reduction in <b>ampacity</b> of a single large conductor due to the skin effect.
