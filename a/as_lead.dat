The {{chelating agent}}s used for treatment of lead poisoning are edetate disodium calcium (CaNa2EDTA), dimercaprol (BAL), which are injected, and succimer and d-penicillamine, which are administered orally.|$|E

5|$|A stone coffin {{found during}} the 2012 {{excavation}} was opened {{for the first}} time, revealing a lead coffin inside. An investigation with an endoscope revealed {{the presence of a}} skeleton along with some head hair and fragments of a shroud and cord. The skeleton was at first assumed to be male, perhaps that of a knight called Sir William de Moton who was known to have been buried there, but later examination showed it to be of a woman—perhaps a high-ranking benefactress. She may not necessarily have been local, <b>as</b> <b>lead</b> coffins were used to transport corpses over long distances.|$|E
5|$|According to the United States Geological Survey, {{the world}} mining {{production}} of bismuth in 2014 was 13,600 tonnes, {{with the major}} contributions from China (7,600 tonnes), Vietnam (4,950 tonnes) and Mexico (948 tonnes). The refinery production in 2010 was 16,000 tonnes, of which China produced 13,000, Mexico 850 and Belgium 800 tonnes. The difference reflects bismuth's status as a byproduct of extraction of other metals such <b>as</b> <b>lead,</b> copper, tin, molybdenum and tungsten.|$|E

5|$|Bismuth is a {{chemical}} element with symbolBi and atomic number 83. Bismuth, a pentavalent post-transition metal {{and one of}} the pnictogens, chemically resembles its lighter homologs arsenic and antimony. Elemental bismuth may occur naturally, although its sulfide and oxide form important commercial ores. The free element is 86% as dense <b>as</b> <b>lead.</b> It is a brittle metal with a silvery white color when freshly produced, but surface oxidation can give it a pink tinge. Bismuth is the most naturally diamagnetic element, and has one of the lowest values of thermal conductivity among metals.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{always being}} found in {{combination}} with the other rare-earth elements in minerals such as monazite and bastnäsite, cerium is easy to extract from its ores, as it can be distinguished among the lanthanides by its unique ability to be oxidized to the +4 state. It is the most common of the lanthanides, followed by neodymium, lanthanum, and praseodymium. It is the 26th most abundant element, making up 66ppm of the Earth's crust, half as much as chlorine and five times as much <b>as</b> <b>lead.</b>|$|E
5|$|Development of Invisible War {{began at}} series creator Ion Storm {{following}} {{the success of}} the original Deus Ex. Most of the original game's development team returned to develop Invisible War, eager to both tell a new story and refine the original gameplay. There were also relative newcomers who had worked on the original game's PlayStation 2 (PS2) port. Harvey Smith, who worked <b>as</b> <b>lead</b> designer for the original game, was chosen by the original director and series creator Warren Spector to direct the game; Spector instead took on a supervisory role for both Invisible War and other projects within the company. While Smith was tempted to act as both director and designer, he saw that it would be too much work, so brought on Ricardo Bare <b>as</b> <b>lead</b> designer. Bare had been involved in the later development of Deus Ex, and despite his lack of experience as a designer was given the role when more qualified staff members were unavailable.|$|E
