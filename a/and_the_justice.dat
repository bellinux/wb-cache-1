Occasionally, the middle segment centered on characters from the Dexter's Laboratory universe other than Dexter and his family. Two of these segments were shown primarily during the first season: Dial M for Monkey <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Justice</b> Friends. Dial M for Monkey was the middle segment for the first six episodes of season one, <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Justice</b> Friends took its place {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E

5|$|Law {{enforcement}} {{constructed the}} necessary offices {{of a police}} station in the general areas of the bus station, which included {{the offices of the}} District Attorney <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> Department. Camp Greyhound did have several issues with police records due to flooding, and prisoners who had committed minor infractions were kept in the same areas as those with more serious allegations. The facility was run on backup generators and outdated fingerprinting methods were used, which added to the confusion of the facility.|$|E

5|$|The present {{courthouse}} {{is located}} at 200 West Dallas Avenue, two blocks west {{of the center of}} the city of Cooper. The building and its property take up half of the city block. It is bordered by Texas State Highway 154 (Dallas Avenue) to the south, Bonham Avenue to the north, NW 2nd Street to the east, and a small alleyway to the west. The courthouse is located slightly south of the geographic center of Delta County.

25|$|As soon as an oral case {{presentation}} is finished, <b>the</b> <b>justices</b> retire for a closed {{meeting to discuss}} <b>and</b> vote on <b>the</b> case.

If the views of <b>the</b> reporting <b>justice</b> do not have the support of a majority of <b>the</b> <b>justices,</b> <b>the</b> President will ask another <b>justice</b> to write <b>the</b> Courtâ€™s opinion, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> minority <b>justices</b> decide who will write a separate dissenting judgement.

5|$|There was, however, {{a bitter}} {{consequence}} of the awards, rooted in Howe's official dispatch to the Admiralty concerning the battle, which according to some accounts was actually written by Curtis. Howe had appended a list to his report containing the names of officers whom he believed merited special reward for their part in the battle. The list included Vice-Admirals Graves and Hood, Rear-Admirals Bowyer, Gardner, and Pasley, and Captains Seymour, Pakenham, Cranfield-Berkeley, Gambier, John Harvey, Payne, Henry Harvey, Pringle, Duckworth, Elphinstone, Nichols, and Hope. Also mentioned were Lieutenants Monkton and Donnelly. The list had omitted a number of officers who {{had served in the}} battle, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>justice</b> of their omission was a highly controversial issue in the Navy. Rear-Admiral Caldwell was the sole British flag officer present not to receive a hereditary honour, although he was promoted to Vice-Admiral on 4 July (as were Bowyer and Gardner). After studying the ship's logs and reports of the battle, the Admiralty minted a medal to be awarded to the living captains on the list only (although Captain William Parker of HMS Audacious was awarded one as well). The captains excluded from the list were furious, and the furor from this selective commendation lasted years: in 1795 Vice-Admiral Caldwell quit the service in anger as a result, while Cuthbert Collingwood, flag captain of Barfleur, refused all awards for future service until the Glorious First of June medal was presented to him as well. He eventually received it after the Battle of Cape St Vincent in 1797. Over five decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the Naval General Service Medal, awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847.|$|E
