5|$|Brain {{activity}} {{is made possible}} by the interconnections of neurons that are linked together to reach their targets. A neuron consists of a cell body, axon, and dendrites. Dendrites are often extensive branches that receive information in the form of signals from the axon terminals of other neurons. The signals received may cause the neuron to initiate an action potential (an electrochemical signal or nerve impulse) which is sent along its axon to the <b>axon</b> <b>terminal,</b> to connect with the dendrites or with the cell body of another neuron. An action potential is initiated at the initial segment of an axon, which contains a complex of proteins. When an action potential, reaches the <b>axon</b> <b>terminal</b> it triggers the release of a neurotransmitter at a synapse that propagates a signal that acts on the target cell. These chemical neurotransmitters include dopamine, serotonin, GABA, glutamate, and acetylcholine. GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, and glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter. Neurons link at synapses to form pathways and elaborate neural networks, and the activity between them is driven by the process of neurotransmission.|$|E

Immunohistochemical experiments demonstrate that, in adult rat, GABA <b>axon</b> <b>terminals</b> are present throughout the NTS while mixed GABA-glycine <b>axon</b> <b>terminals</b> are strictly located to the lateral part of the NTS within subnuclei surrounding the tractus solitarius.

Electrophysiological experiments confirm the predominance of GABA inhibition throughout the NTS and demonstrate {{the existence of a}} dual inhibition involving the co-release of GABA and glycine restricted to the lateral part of NTS. Since GABA(A) and glycine receptors are co-expressed postsynaptically in virtually all the inhibitory <b>axon</b> <b>terminals</b> throughout the NTS, it suggests that the inhibition phenotype relies on the characteristics of the <b>axon</b> <b>terminals.</b> Our results also demonstrate that glycine is mostly associated with GABA within <b>axon</b> <b>terminals</b> and raise the possibility of a dynamic regulation of GABA/glycine release at the presynaptic level.

The neurotransmitters diffuse across the synaptic cleft and activate receptors on the postsynaptic neuron.

25|$|SSRIs prevent 5-HT from binding to SERT which {{prevents}} absorption of 5-HT {{back into the}} presynapse terminal, where it is metabolized by monoamine oxidase or stored in secretory vesicles. As a result, the 5-HT concentration increases at the somatodendritic area of the 5-HT neuron {{but not so much}} at the <b>axon</b> <b>terminal</b> area (demonstrated in figure 2). This increase in 5-HT concentration causes desensitization of somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors. When these 5-HT1A autoreceptors have been downregulated, they will no longer restrict the impulse flow of the 5-HT neuron. The impulse flow is turned on and as a result 5-HT is released at the <b>axon</b> <b>terminal.</b> However, this increase of 5-HT does not happen quickly compared to the increase of 5-HT at the somatodendretic area of the 5-HT neuron. This delay is caused by the time it takes 5-HT to downregulate 5-HT1A autoreceptors and turn on the neuro impulse flow of the 5-HT neuron. This delay can explain the reason why antidepressants do not have effect on depression immediately. This can also be the reason why the antidepressant mechanisms can be connected to the increasing neuro impulse flow from 5-HT neurons, where as the concentration of 5-HT increases at the <b>axon</b> <b>terminal</b> before SSRIs start to work properly. When SSRIs have (1) inhibited the re-uptake pump, (2) increased somatodendritic 5-HT, (3) desensitized somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors, (4) turned on the impulse flow and (5) increased the release of 5-HT from <b>axon</b> <b>terminal,</b> the last step might be desensitization of postsynaptic 5-HT receptors. This desensitization could be the reason for reduction of adverse effects of SSRIs as tolerance develops.|$|E
25|$|The pacinian {{corpuscle}} is {{one such}} structure.

If the pressure is steady, {{there is no more}} stimulus; thus, typically these neurons respond with a transient depolarization during the initial deformation and again when the pressure is removed, which causes the corpuscle to change shape again. Other types of adaptation are important in extending the function of a number of other neurons.|$|E
25|$|Neurons {{are known}} as excitable cells because on its surface {{membrane}} there are an abundance of proteins known as ion-channels that allow small charged particles to pass {{in and out of}} the cell. The structure of the neuron allows chemical information to be received by its dendrites, propagated through the perikaryon (cell body) and down its axon, and eventually passing on to other neurons through its <b>axon</b> <b>terminal.</b> These voltage-gated ion channels allow for rapid depolarization throughout the cell. This depolarization, if it reaches a certain threshold, will cause an action potential. Once the action potential reaches the <b>axon</b> <b>terminal,</b> it will cause an influx of calcium ions into the cell. The calcium ions will then cause vesicles, small packets filled with neurotransmitters, to bind to the cell membrane and release its contents into the synapse. This cell is known as the pre-synaptic neuron, and the cell that interacts with the neurotransmitters released is known as the post-synaptic neuron. Once the neurotransmitter is released into the synapse, it can either bind to receptors on the post-synaptic cell, the pre-synaptic cell can re-uptake it and save it for later transmission, or it can be broken down by enzymes in the synapse specific to that certain neurotransmitter. These three different actions are major areas where drug action can affect communication between neurons.|$|E

40|$|SummaryAn axon {{is thought}} to {{faithfully}} conduct action potentials to its terminals. However, many features of the <b>axon</b> and <b>axon</b> <b>terminals,</b> especially at inhibitory synapses, remain unknown. By directly recording from the <b>axon</b> and <b>terminal</b> of a cultured cerebellar Purkinje cell (PC), we demonstrate that low membrane excitability of <b>axon</b> <b>terminals</b> shapes synaptic output. Simultaneous measurements of presynaptic capacitance and evoked IPSCs revealed PC <b>axon</b> <b>terminals</b> contained large readily releasable synaptic vesicles that exhibited a low release probability. Nevertheless, IPSCs evoked by stimulating a PC soma underwent frequency-dependent depression. Direct axonal recordings showed that high-frequency action potentials were faithfully conducted over axonal bifurcations but were attenuated around terminals. Sparse Na+ channels relative to enriched voltage-gated K+ channels in terminals caused short-term depression of IPSCs by reducing Ca 2 + influx. Together with confirmation in slice recordings, our findings reveal a presynaptic mechanism that shapes short-term synaptic depression without depleting releasable vesicles...|$|R
40|$|We {{previously}} {{demonstrated that}} the opioid peptide, enkephalin, and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) are occasionally co-localized in individual <b>axon</b> <b>terminals</b> but more frequently converge on common dendrites in the locus coeruleus (LC). To further examine potential opioid co-transmitters in CRF afferents, we investigated the distribution of proopiomelanocortin (POMC), the precursor that yields the potent bioactive peptide, ß-endorphin, with respect to CRF immunoreactivity using immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopic analyses of the LC. Coronal sections were collected through the dorsal pontine tegmentum of rat brain and processed for immunocytochemical detection of POMC and CRF or tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). POMC-immunoreactive processes exhibited a distinct distribution within the LC {{as compared to the}} enkephalin family of opioid peptides. Specifically, POMC fibers were enriched in the ventromedial aspect of the LC with fewer fibers present dorsolaterally. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed frequent co-existence of POMC and CRF in varicose processes that overlapped TH-containing somatodendritic processes in the LC. Ultrastructural analysis showed POMC immunoreactivity in unmyelinated <b>axons</b> and <b>axon</b> <b>terminals.</b> <b>Axon</b> <b>terminals</b> containing POMC were filled with numerous large dense core vesicles. In sections processed for POMC and TH, approximately 29 % of POMC-containing <b>axon</b> <b>terminals</b> (n = 405) targeted dendrites that exhibited immunogold-silver labeling for TH. Whereas, sections processed for POMC and CRF showed that 27 % of POMC-labeled <b>axon</b> <b>terminals</b> (n = 657) also exhibited CRF immunoreactivity. Taken together, these data indicate that a subset of CRF afferents targeting the LC contain POMC and may be positioned to dually impact LC activity...|$|R
25|$|Neurons {{communicate}} with one another via synapses, where the <b>axon</b> <b>terminal</b> or en passant bouton (a type of terminals located {{along the length of the}} axon) of one cell contacts another neuron's dendrite, soma or, less commonly, axon. Neurons such as Purkinje cells in the cerebellum can have over 1000 dendritic branches, making connections with tens of thousands of other cells; other neurons, such as the magnocellular neurons of the supraoptic nucleus, have only one or two dendrites, each of which receives thousands of synapses. Synapses can be excitatory or inhibitory and either increase or decrease activity in the target neuron, respectively. Some neurons also communicate via electrical synapses, which are direct, electrically conductive junctions between cells.|$|E
25|$|Neurons {{exist in}} a number of {{different}} shapes and sizes and can be classified by their morphology and function. The anatomist Camillo Golgi grouped neurons into two types; type I with long axons used to move signals over long distances and type II with short axons, which can often be confused with dendrites. Type I cells can be further divided by where the cell body or soma is located. The basic morphology of type I neurons, represented by spinal motor neurons, consists of a cell body called the soma and a long thin axon covered by the myelin sheath. Around the cell body is a branching dendritic tree that receives signals from other neurons. The end of the axon has branching terminals (<b>axon</b> <b>terminal)</b> that release neurotransmitters into a gap called the synaptic cleft between the terminals and the dendrites of the next neuron.|$|E
25|$|Neurotransmitter {{release is}} {{dependent}} on an external supply of Ca2+ ions which enter axon terminals via voltage-gated calcium channels. Vesicular fusion with the terminal membrane and release of the neurotransmitter {{is caused by the}} generation of Ca2+ gradients induced by incoming action potentials. The Ca2+ ions cause the mobilization of newly synthesized vesicles from a reserve pool to undergo this membrane fusion. This mechanism of action was discovered in squid giant axons. Lowering intracellular Ca2+ ions provides a direct inhibitory effect on neurotransmitter release. After release of the neurotransmitter occurs, vesicular membranes are recycled to their origins of production. Calcium ion channels can vary depending on the location of incidence. For example, the channels at an <b>axon</b> <b>terminal</b> differ from the typical calcium channels of a cell body (whether neural or not). Even at axon terminals, calcium ion channel types can vary, {{as is the case with}} P-type calcium channels located at the neuromuscular junction.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) plays a {{key role}} in the central control of the {{autonomic}} nervous system. In adult rats, both GABA and glycine are used as inhibitory neurotransmitter in the NTS. Using a quantitative morphological approach, we have investigated the perinatal development of inhibitory synapses in the NTS. The density of both inhibitory <b>axon</b> <b>terminals</b> and synapses increased from embryonic day 20 until the end of the second postnatal week (postnatal day 14). Before birth, only GABAergic <b>axon</b> <b>terminals</b> developed and their number increased during the first postnatal week. Mixed GABA/glycine <b>axon</b> <b>terminals</b> appeared at birth and their number increased during the first postnatal week. This suggests the development of a mixed GABA/glycine inhibition in parallel to pure GABA inhibition. However, whereas GABAergic <b>axon</b> <b>terminals</b> were distributed throughout the NTS, mixed GABA/glycine <b>axon</b> <b>terminals</b> were strictly located in the lateral part of the NTS. Established at birth, this specific topography remained in the adult rat. From birth, GABA(A) receptors, glycine receptors and gephyrin were clustered in inhibitory synapses throughout the NTS, revealing a neurotransmitter-receptor mismatch within the medial part of the NTS. Together these results suggest that NTS inhibitory networks develop and mature until postnatal day 14. Developmental changes in NTS synaptic inhibition may play an important role in shaping neural network activity during a time of maturation of autonomic functions. The first two postnatal weeks could represent a critical period where the impact of the environment influences the physiological phenotypes of adult rats...|$|R
