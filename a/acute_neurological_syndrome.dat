Only very few cases of Guillain-Barré-Syndrome (GBS) associated with eating disorders have been reported. The objective {{of this paper is}} to describe and discuss a case of anorexia nervosa and concomittant chronic GBS. We report on a course of medical management for a 15 year old female patient, who presented with <b>acute</b> <b>neurological</b> <b>syndrome</b> (GBS) which was followed by the onset of a severe eating disorder. The patient was diagnosed to have two different entities, with the association between the two remaining unclear. The mainstay of management was focused on the eating disorder. Using an integrative psychiatric therapy a significant improvement of the eating disorder was achieved. The patient’s body weight was stabilised and the locomotor deficits improved. Though a significant somatic disorder was evident, it proved to be advantageous to primarily focus on the eating disorder, until it was under control. The possible correlations between the two distinct disorders are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{pictorial}} essay is to present the computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of Wernicke’s encephalopathy, a rare, severe, <b>acute</b> <b>neurological</b> <b>syndrome</b> due to thiamine (vitamin B 1) deficiency, associated with high morbidity and mortality. The classical clinical triad, which includes ocular signs, altered consciousness and ataxia, {{can be found in}} only one-third of patients. Although chronic alcoholic patients are the most commonly affected, Wernicke’s encephalopathy may complicate malnutrition conditions in nonalcoholic patients, in whom it is greatly underestimated. CT and above all MRI of the brain play a fundamental role in diagnosing the condition and ruling out other diseases. MRI is the most sensitive technique and is required in all patients with a clinical suspicion of Wernicke’s encephalopathy. Medial thalami, mamillary bodies, tegmentum, periaqueductal region, and tectal plate are typical sites of abnormal MRI signal. The dorsal medulla, red nuclei, cranial nerve nuclei, cerebellum, corpus callosum, frontal and parietal cerebral cortex are less common sites of involvement although they are more frequently affected in nonalcoholic patients.

40|$|Interest in {{herpes simplex}} virus (HSV) has in-creased {{considerably}} {{over the last few}} years, {{largely as a result of}} a more general awareness ofthe possible association between HSV- 2 and cervical cancer and the increasing frequency of sexual transmission of HSV- 2.

That HSV can remain latent within neural tissues is well recognized (Baringer, 1975). An intriguing question is how the relatively rare <b>acute</b> <b>neurological</b> <b>syndromes,</b> such as HSV encephalitis and meningitis, are related to the car-riage of latent HSV which is so widespread in human individuals.

40|$|Introduction: Several <b>acute</b> <b>neurological</b> <b>syndromes</b> can be {{triggered}} by immune events. Hepatitis E virus (HEV), an emerging infectious disease, {{can be one of}} these triggers. Case report: We report the case of a 36 -year-old man that presented nausea and a dull abdominal pain for a week and then felt an acute neuralgic pain involving both shoulders that lasted for 8 to 10 hours. Immediately after, the patient presented a severe bilateral muscular weakness of the proximal part of both upper limbs, corresponding to an amyotrophic neuralgia. Two days after the shoulder pain, the patient presented a dysphagia necessitating tube feeding.  A blood sample confirmed hepatitis caused by hepatitis E virus (HEV; genotype 3 F). Oral feeding resumed progressively after five months. The patient was fully independent for the activities of daily living but was still unable to work after six months. Conclusion: Amyotrophic neuralgia and hepatitis E are both under-diagnosed. It is noteworthy that HEV can trigger amyotrophic neuralgia. Antiviral drugs, oral steroids and intravenous immunoglobulins can be proposed, but the optimal treatment has  not yet been determined...|$|R

We have generated transgenic mice ubiquitously expressing the human protein SLAM (signaling lymphocytic activation molecule), or CD 150, recently identified as an MV receptor. In contrast to all other MV receptor transgenic models described so far, in these mice infection with wild-type MV strains is highly pathogenic. Intranasal infection of SLAM transgenic suckling mice leads to MV spread to different organs and the development of an <b>acute</b> <b>neurological</b> <b>syndrome,</b> characterized by lethargy, seizures, ataxia, weight loss, and death within 3 weeks. In addition, in this model, vaccine and wild-type MV strains can be distinguished by virulence. Furthermore, intracranial MV infection of adult transgenic mice generates a subclinical infection associated with a high titer of MV-specific antibodies in the serum. Finally, to analyze new antimeasles therapeutic approaches, we created a recombinant soluble form of SLAM and demonstrated its important antiviral activity both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our results show the high susceptibility of SLAM transgenic mice to MV-induced neurological disease and open new perspectives for the analysis of the implication of SLAM in the neuropathogenicity of other morbilliviruses, which also use this molecule as a receptor. Moreover, this transgenic model, in allowing a simple readout of the efficacy of an antiviral treatment, provides unique experimental means to test novel anti-MV preventive and therapeutic strategies.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that TNF/cachectin, a {{cytokine}} mostly released by activated macrophages, plays a central role in experimental cerebral malaria (CM), an <b>acute</b> and lethal <b>neurological</b> <b>syndrome</b> that follows infection by Plasmodium berghei ANKA strain in mice (1).

The more severely poisoned victims had seizures and/or amnesia and four died; however, one survivor unexpectedly developed temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) {{a year after the}} event. Nearly a decade later, several thousand sea lions have stranded on California beaches with neurological symptoms. Analysis of the animals stranded over an eight year period indicated five clusters of <b>acute</b> <b>neurological</b> poisoning; however, nearly a quarter have stranded individually outside these events with clinical signs of a chronic <b>neurological</b> <b>syndrome</b> similar to TLE. These poisonings are not limited to sea lions, which serve as readily observed sentinels for other marine animals that strand during domoic acid poisoning events, including several species of dolphin and whales. Acute domoic acid poisoning is five-times more prominent in adult female sea lions {{as a result of the}} proximity of their year-round breeding grounds to major domoic acid bloom events. The chronic <b>neurological</b> <b>syndrome,</b> on the other hand, is more prevalent in young animals, with many potentially poisoned in utero.
