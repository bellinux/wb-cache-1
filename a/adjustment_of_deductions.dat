40|$|The {{theme of}} this work is VAT deduction. This is a current topic related to the {{amendment}} of the VAT Act which occurred in 2013. Aim of the thesis is deeper description {{and analysis of the}} issue <b>of</b> VAT <b>deduction.</b> Another aim is the application of these issues with examples from judicature of European Union and the Czech Republic. In the thesis the author writes about the value added tax, the VAT deduction, about the right for <b>deduction,</b> correction and <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> VAT <b>deduction,</b> changes in VAT deduction related to the amended act, VAT deduction in group and in association. Also the judicature of European Court of Justice related to issues <b>of</b> VAT <b>deduction</b> is analysed. The work provides orientation in VAT deduction issues and also in solutions of practical problems related to this theme. The thesis could be beneficial for both entrepreneurs and specialists in the field of taxation...|$|R

40|$|Proof has {{two aspects}} in the from of thinking. Plato {{said that one}} is {{synthesis}} which goes asendently in cognition, {{and the other is}} analysis which goes descently. Methematical reasoning is the key concept of new teaching gemetry of grade 7. It is clarified when we compare a new text with old one and research into the mathematical course of study. Mathematical reasoning has two educational problems. One is the Necessity <b>of</b> <b>deduction</b> and the other is the strictness of deducion. Philosophical ambiguity of the proof corresponds with two problems of mathematical reasoning. We can conprehend the problem of the necessity <b>of</b> <b>deduction</b> in the light of synthesis and the strictness <b>of</b> <b>deduction</b> in light <b>of</b> analysis. Necessity and Strictnss <b>of</b> <b>deduction</b> are logically interrelated and dependent upon each other in the content of teaching geometry. Locally axiomatic, which is proposed by Freudenthal, H. and Schuster, S. independently, is considered as the point of view which integrates the necessity and strictness <b>of</b> <b>deduction.</b> The problems <b>of</b> mathematical reasoning are oriented to solutions in the terms of locally axiomatic...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} to optimize the application <b>of</b> <b>deduction</b> <b>of</b> tax loss taking into account other tax deductions and tax reliefs. The first two parts are based primarily on Act No. 586 / 1992 Coll., on income taxes. They define the conditions for the application <b>of</b> the <b>deduction</b> <b>of</b> the tax loss, of the expenses (costs) from tax base by the realization {{of research and development}} programs, of the donation and of the tax reliefs. The third and last chapter applies these knowledges at the optimalization of the application <b>of</b> <b>deduction</b> <b>of</b> tax loss. The optimization is performed for two fictitious tax payers of the corporate income tax. The intention is to find the optimal combination <b>of</b> <b>deductions</b> and tax reliefs, when the taxpayer minimizes tax liability after taking into account the possibility of the additional tax assessment {{as a result of the}} tax audit. A procedure that reduces the disadvantage of inability to use the tax deduction against an additional increase in tax during the tax audit is set at the end of this thesis...|$|R

The theoretical part of my work will focus on the description of the corporate income tax, description <b>of</b> <b>deduction,</b> and description <b>of</b> <b>deductions</b> which Czech legislation allows. In Chapter 1. 4 is description of tax relief. Practical part of my work contains an analysis how dependent tax revenues from corporate income tax rate, gross value added or gross domestic product. In Chapter 2. 2 is tested if gross added value or gross domestic product affects the application <b>of</b> <b>deductions,</b> which are divided into different groups - in sum, type of legal form or NACE. In Chapter 2. 3 is a similar analysis for tax relief...|$|R
