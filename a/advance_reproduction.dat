However, these types of harvest cuts have usually resulted in poor regeneration of northern red oaks on high quality sites. This holds true even where red oak was a prominent component in the overstory of the previous stand. Too often, these cuts have been made without regard to the presence or size of <b>advance</b> <b>reproduction</b> or to stump sprouting potential. The requirement that oak <b>advance</b> <b>reproduction</b> be present on the site prior to cutting has long been established. Guidelines are available for evaluating oak regeneration potential.

The relationship between the size of <b>advance</b> <b>reproduction</b> and post-harvestperformancein the southern Appalachians is similar to that in the central hardwood region. A model has been developed to predict the number of dominant and codominant red oaks that would be expected in the next stand if the current mature stand were clearcut.

Successful oak stand regeneration requires an abundance of well developed <b>advance</b> <b>reproduction.</b> Past studies have found that oak reproduction varies on upland landscapes by inferred measures of nutrient and water supply such as site index, slope-aspect, and slope position. There is a need to relate oak reproduction to soil nutrient and water supply parameters to better understand variations in oak reproduction on upland landscapes. On the USDA Forest Service, Sinkin Experimental Forest, located in the Missouri Ozarks, we used regression models for estimating the <b>advance</b> <b>reproduction</b> density of red oaks, white oaks, and non-oaks. The abundance of red oak <b>advance</b> <b>reproduction</b> was smaller on northeast-facing slopes and inversely related to soil plant available water capacity (AWC) and soil base saturation (BS) suggesting a greater accumulation on sites having both a lesser water and nutrient supply. The abundance of non-oaks was greater on northeast-facing slopes and positively related to site index and Bs suggesting a greater accumulation on sites having a greater site quality and nutrient supply.

This study was conducted to determine whether mid- and understory removal in combination with ground flora vegetation control would result in a sufficient increase in light to foster the development of pin oak (Quercus palustris Muenchh.) <b>advance</b> <b>reproduction</b> without releasing non-oak competitors. Implementation of three artificial regeneration treatments (direct seeding pin oak acorns, planting 1 - 0 pin oak bareroot seedlings, and planting pin oak RPMP®P seedlings) was also conducted on these same bottomland forest sites in southeastern Missouri. The mid- and understory removal treatment increased the amount of photosynthetically active radiation reaching the understory from 3 percent of full sunlight to 16 percent of full sunlight. This increase in light led to an increase in the proportion of pin oak <b>advance</b> <b>reproduction</b> present in the understory from 1. 5 percent of all <b>advance</b> <b>reproduction</b> in control areas to 28. 1 percent in removal treatment areas.

40|$|Recent concern {{regarding}} the potential decline of quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) {{forests in the}} western United States has sparked concern over whether the species can be effectively regenerated. Using a retrospective approach, we quantified the response of regenerating aspen stems to an ordinary set of silvicultural treatments conducted over approximately the past decade in southern Utah, USA. A suite of variables describing stand structure and composition, stand vigor, physiographic factors, herbivore pressure, and treatment types were measured to predict the possible controls, {{as well as their}} relative importance, on aspen regeneration. Results suggested that aspen regeneration was most strongly related to browsing pressure, site preparation technique, and the presence of <b>advance</b> <b>reproduction</b> before treatment, which is a novel finding. Secondary predictors included elevation, site index, and overstory conditions, which are generally characteristics of stand vigor. Management recommendations based on our results should recognize the strong primary control that browsing pressure exerts on regeneration. First, the height of <b>advance</b> <b>reproduction</b> is inherently dependent on antecedent herbivory and also indicative of present browsing and should be assessed before treatment. Second, the most effective site preparation techniques, namely broadcast burning and browsing reduction, will directly reduce browsing pressure, assuming ungulate populations are not too large.

40|$|Bottomland {{hardwood}} forests normally regenerate with species {{found in}} the overstory. These species reflect the timing, duration, depth of water, {{and nature of the}} sediment in past flooding. The longer water stands during the growing season and the deeper the sediment, the fewer the species that are able to survive. Flooding patterns often change over the life of a bottomland hardwood stand. If conditions moderate, more species can regenerate the site; if flooding worsens and sediment builds up, fewer species can occupy the site.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of learning {{has long been}} hypothesized to be limited by fitness trade-offs such as delays in reproduction. We explored the relationship between host learning and reproduction in the cabbage white butterfly, Pieris rapae. The cabbage white female is innately biased to search for common green hosts but can learn to search for rare red hosts. Host learning was shown previously to vary among full-sibling families and to incur costs in terms of host search efficiency and brain size. In the present study, we show that butterflies from full-sib families with relatively better learning performance on red hosts tend to emerge as adults with relatively fewer and less-developed eggs. We also used methoprene, a juvenile hormone mimic, to <b>advance</b> <b>reproduction</b> in female cabbage whites. We found that methoprene-treated butterflies improved host-finding ability less with experience, relative to controls, providing independent evidence of a link between learning and timing of reproduction. Finally, we show that the learning experience itself is associated with additional decreases in lifetime fecundity.

40|$|The growth {{characteristics}} of <b>advance</b> <b>reproduction</b> {{on the forest}} floor {{is an important factor in}} understanding the natural processes of forest regeneration. In this paper, the growth {{characteristics of}} seedlings and sprouts were analyzed for five deciduous broad-leaved tree species, Changes in growth characteristics induced by sprouting, (which modifies internal factors), are discussed from an ecological view point. The dry matter economy and three aspects of tree architecture, hydraulic, supportive and assimilative efficiencies were examined using several simple indices calculated from tree dimensions and dry matter allocation for seedlings and sprouts of Meliosma myriantha,Magnolia, obovata, Pterocarya, rhoifolia, Styrax japonicus and Styrux Shiraianus. Generally, sprouts increased their proportion of non-photosynthetic organs by sacrificing efficiency in matter economy, In particular, small-leaved or sympodial branching species, S. japonicus, S. Shiraianus and P. rhoifolis, modified their growth characteristics by sprouting from the 2 ̆ 7 waiting 2 ̆ 7 growth (diameter-preferred growth) type to the 2 ̆ 7 competing 2 ̆ 7 growth (elongation-preferred growth) type. The latter (competing) was observed in the seedlings of the large-leaved and monopodial branching species, M. myriantha and S. obovata. As a result of this change, small-leaved species and sympodial branching species tended to reduce supportive and assimilative efficiencies through sprouting. These characteristics in sprouts are thought to depend on the role of the original root system of the mother tree. 森林の更新過程を解明する上では，前生樹の生育特性の把握が重要である．本研究では，森林の更新過程に大きく寄与していると考えられる実生椎樹および萌芽椎樹の物質分配特性を比較し，萌芽という現象に伴う内的要因の変化により，個体の生育特性がどのように変化しているかを解析した．エゴノキ，コハクウンボク，アワブキ，ホオノキおよびサワルグミについて，個体の各器官の量的分配とサイズから簡単な指数を用いて，水分通導，支持および同化という樹形の 3 機能を評価し，樹種毎に実生および萌芽椎樹における樹形の生態的意義の比較を行った．一般に，萌芽では実生と比較して物質経済の有利性を犠牲にしながら非同化器官の比率を増加させる傾向がみられた．特に小型葉で仮軸分枝型の種であるエゴノキおよびコハクウンボクの実生では，大型葉・単軸分枝型の種であるアワブキおよびホオノキに比べて，同化効率と支持効率が高い“待機型（肥大優先型）”の生育特性を持っており，萌芽することによって，大型葉・単軸型の種の樹形でみられた同化・支持効率の低い“競争型（伸長優先型）”へ生育様式を移行させていることが明らかとなった．これらの結果は，萌芽の母樹の既存の根系の働きに支持されているものと考えられた...|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} recent concern {{regarding}} the regeneration and recruitment of aspen (Populus tremuloides) {{in the western}} United States. Forest management techniques have been employed {{in order to promote}} the regeneration and recruitment of aspen. We quantified aspen regeneration treatments in southern Utah, USA to better understand the factors driving aspen recruitment. Driving factors were identified by addressing two major research themes: (1) identify the primary ecological controls on aspen regeneration success; (2) assess the relative importance and influence of these controls on successful regeneration. Our definition of successful aspen regeneration requires the satisfaction of two criteria relating to height and density, respectively: (1) regeneration that has attained heights above the ungulate browsing threshold (e. g. 3 ̆e 2 m); and (2) regeneration that is occurring at a density that represents desired conditions for future stocking (e. g. ≥ 10, 000 stems ha⁻¹). The primary ecological controls on regeneration success were identified using nonmetric multidimensional scaling, and Random Forests analysis was used to assess the relative importance and influence of regeneration controls. These analyses identified three primary factors that are responsible for regeneration success. These factors were (1) contemporary herbivory pressure, (2) site preparation technique, and (3) <b>advance</b> <b>reproduction.</b> Herbivory is the leading predictor of regeneration success, and has integral impacts on other primary regeneration drivers.

40|$|Understanding {{life history}} {{variation}} in insects requires {{an assessment of}} how resources are allocated between reproductive and somatic traits. Associated data are not only a potential indicator of species adaptation, but also of environmental influences on fitness. So far, however, there is a dearth of data on factors affecting resource allocation, in particular in real environments. Using an integrative nutrient assay protocol, this study assessed the effects of body size and environmental conditions on resource allocation strategies in terrestrial and aquatic semelparous insects: the indian mealmoth, Plodia interpunctella under laboratory conditions, and two caddisfly species (Hydropsyche siltalai and Rhyacophila dorsalis) in the field. In Plodia interpunctella, larger females had higher potential lifetime fecundity due to their prolonged lifespan, while smaller females maintained greater initial egg loads and a shorter life-span. Assays revealed that current reproduction requires greater nutrient allocation in somatic and reproductive tissue, illustrating potentially fundamental factors underlying reproduction-longevity trade-offs. Field studies showed how trichopteran larvae have species-specific responses to physicochemical conditions located along an altitudinal gradient (20 m - 230 m asl) in the River Usk [...] Nutrient allocation in Rhyacophila dorsalis did not differ between upstream and downstream sites. In contrast, upstream Hydropsyche siltalai emerged with greater nutrient reserves consistent with early reproduction while those in warmer downstream environments must reallocate resources for somatic maintenance reducing available resource for reproduction. Consistent with this result, translocation of late instar H. siltalai over a thermal gradient (1. 5 - 4. 5 °C) showed how thermal exposure can affect adult fitness by reducing body size and increasing nutrient allocation for somatic maintenance. These results show how insects adjust nutrient balance for reproduction and survival under different circumstances. The most significant result is that global warming might reduce body size and <b>advance</b> <b>reproduction</b> in some species with consequences for fitness. This is proposed as an area ripe for further study to understand the evolutionary consequences of global change...|$|E
40|$|The {{current failure}} of oak (Quercus) {{regeneration}} {{across much of}} the Central Hardwood Region (CHR) is a cause for great concern because of the economic and ecological importance of the genus. Oak species are failing to establish and adequately compete under contemporary disturbance regimes despite their long history of eastern forest dominance. Silvicultural clearcutting was heavily implemented in the 1960 s– 1980 s in an attempt to successfully regenerate oak stands, but its effectiveness is now questioned as many clearcut stands have transitioned into later stages of stem exclusion dominated by other species. In 1988, a study was implemented by the USDA Forest Service North-Central Forest Experiment Station on the Hoosier National Forest in southern Indiana to examine the fate of oak species and their competitors within developing stands following clearcut harvests. ^ Permanent overstory plots were established in six harvest units using a nested design to capture a variety of topographic and edaphic conditions. All stands were characterized as an oak-hickory (Quercus-Carya) forest type at the time of canopy removal. Pre-harvest overstory plot data were collected in 1988 and plots were resampled in 2011, allowing documentation of shifts in species composition over the 23 year period (1988 - 2011). Aerial photos from the 19302 ̆ 7 s were used to determine canopy cover and likely historic land-use of each stand prior to incorporation into the HNF. In order to precisely characterize edaphic conditions, soil samples were collected and analyzed in 2011. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) was used to examine species composition along topo-edaphic and historic canopy cover gradients. ^ Three permanent reproduction plots were established within each overstory plot to investigate the influence of site and seedling physical attributes on height growth and establishment success of oak reproduction in post-harvest stands. Prior to harvest, an array of physical characteristics were documented for individual stems of <b>advance</b> <b>reproduction.</b> The same characteristics were remeasured in years 6, 12, and 23 for all reproduction types (<b>advance</b> <b>reproduction,</b> stump sprouts, and new seedlings). Random Forest (RF) analysis and linear mixed-effects models were used to determine the best environmental and physical predictors of height growth for oak species and their competitors in developing stands. ^ NMS displayed drastic declines in the importance of white oak (Quercus alba), black oak (Quercus velutina), and chestnut oak (Quercus prinus) across all stands following harvest. During the same time period, I observed large increases in the importance of other species, with red maple (Acer rubrum) showing large increases on the driest sites and yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera) displaying the greatest increase across all sites. My results suggest that silvicultural clearcutting has driven stand demographics towards species favored by infrequent large-scale disturbance events. In pre-harvest stands, chestnut oak was confined to the poorest sites and displayed the strongest association with the historically closed canopies on sites where forests were not cleared due to poor soils and steep terrain. In post-harvest stands, yellow-poplar and black cherry (Prunus serotina) were strongly associated with more nutrient-rich sites, while bigtooth aspen (Populus grandidentata) and red maple were associated with more xeric sites with lower nutrient levels. ^ Random Forest analysis showed that advance regeneration of oak species fared poorly following clearcut harvests. Sprout-origin oak stems proved stronger competitors in developing stands, although their abundance was quite low. Advance and sprout origin maples (Acer spp.), along with new seedlings of black cherry and yellow-poplar, quickly overtopped advance oak stems in the developing canopy. The height of stems during prior sampling periods was the best overall predictor of stem height. Species was also an important predictor, but environmental variables were generally poor predictors of height growth in individual stems throughout the study. Of all environmental variables, percent slope was the best predictor of stem height, a finding that was also supported by analysis with linear mixed-effects models. ^ My results suggest that overstory removal has driven stand demographics towards species favored by infrequent large-scale disturbance events such as clearcutting. Without secondary treatments such as prescribed burning or herbicide to control competitors, the few oak stems that successfully regenerate following harvest are highly unlikely to persist in developing stands. The successful regeneration of oak species will require multiple treatments and should be viewed as a long-term commitment to promoting both biological and functional diversity in these stands. ...|$|E

The probability of <b>advance</b> oak <b>reproduction</b> becoming codominant in the new stand is positively related to seedling size {{at the time of}} the regeneration harvest. Silvicultural techniques are needed that stimulate the growth of oak seedlings before overstory removal without stimulating the growth of competing species.

In our study, 80 % to 90 % of seedlings remained less than 30 cm tall after one or three fires. Although fire behavior was not assessed as an objective in this study, the fire temperatures we obtained were within the ranges reported by others for dormant season burns in Eastern deciduous forests (Franklin et al. 1997, Iverson et al. 2004, Phillips and Waldrop 2008), but may have been insufficient to cause mortality of shade-casting overstory trees. Without thinning, available light is too low to support rapid rates of height growth for either oaks or red maple, and frequent fire {{in the short term}} sets back shoot development. Burns that reduce post-fire seedling emergence of red maple have been documented (Glasgow and Matlack 2007), and Brose (2010) noted that seedling-origin dominant stems were only found in controls, not in any of the burn treatments. With thinning, oak seedlings that were burned also appeared to be caught in a fire trap, with fewer stems tallied in the largest size classes. There was no clear pattern for red maple seedlings under thinning and fire, as distribution among height classes was somewhat even. In these systems, juvenile sprouting must be considered part of the recruitment strategy. Without thinning, red maple sprouts were not trapped in the smaller size classes following one fire, a trend found elsewhere (Arthur et al. 1998, Albrecht and McCarthy 2006). With three fires, red maple sprouts were maintained as smaller stems. Under thinning, oak and maple sprouts responded favorably to one fire, with over 60 % of the sprouts in the largest size class for oak and over 90 % for maple; with three fires, oak sprouts did not recruit into larger sizes. The key to developing large oak <b>advance</b> <b>reproduction</b> is to have sufficient light in the understory and time between fires to permit positive net root growth. Then, when the oak seedling sprouts are competitive, they need further release from overstory competition and a fire-free period to allow for recruitment into the overstory. Reproduction needs to reach a threshold size before it can escape from fire. Longer fire-free periods (antecedent periods as described by Arthur et al. 2015) may allow seedlings and sprouts enough time to grow into a fire-resistant size (Jacqmain et al. 1999, Fan et al. 2012, Grady and Hoffman 2012).|$|E
40|$|Managers {{responsible}} {{for maintaining the}} diversity and productivity of Southern Appalachian forests are increasingly turning to prescribed fire as an important management tool in oak dominated forests. The decision to use fire with increasing frequency and spatial extent is based, in part, on an emerging sense of the prehistoric significance of fire in this landscape and its potential to control the proliferation of fire-sensitive competitors in contemporary forests. While it is well documented that fire {{has been an important}} ecological force in Southern Appalachian forests for a very long time, there has been little research to demonstrate that prescribed fire effectively controls fire-sensitive competitors, promotes regeneration of desirable species, or maintains and promotes healthy forest stands. In the face of increased management burning {{there is a need to}} address these questions, and to quantify the role of existing and residual fuels in fire management following repeated fire of differing intervals. Two studies were initiated in 1995 and 2002 in upland forests on the Cumberland Plateau of Kentucky to examine the effectiveness of prescribed fire to maintain oak dominance by altering stand structure and enhancing oak seedling establishment and development. We hypothesized that fire would: (1) reduce midstory stem density, and that these changes to stand structure and light availability would lead to improved performance of oak seedlings; and (2) control oak competitors. On ridgetop sites on the escarpment of the Cumberland Plateau, we measured stand structure and tree regeneration on 48 plots in 6 treatment areas over an 11 -year period. Four units were burned 3 - 4 times and two units serve as fire-excluded references. On the topographically-dissected landscape of the Cumberland Plateau we recorded stand structure and multiple aspects of the tree regeneration process on 9 study sites (93 plots), with three sites burned four times, three sites burned twice, and three fire-excluded sites. Prescribed fire reduced midstory stem density and basal area, and increased light availability which was transitory due to understory sprouting. Seedling population studies revealed that oaks and maple seedlings responded to stem kill by re-sprouting, with increased height and diameter. However, red maple seedlings grew more than oaks after burning. Burning reduced seedling density of potential competitor species, yet high fecundity of some species (e. g., red maple) and strong sprouting response of others (e. g., sassafras), suggests that multiple fires have provided neither the stand structural changes nor competition control that would lead to the development of more competitive oak <b>advance</b> <b>reproduction.</b> An oak mast event revealed a potentially positive role for fire in reducing the depth of the litter layer and enhancing oak seedling establishment and growth. Overall, our results suggest a modest role for prescribed fire in enhancing the establishment, growth and persistence of oak advance regeneration...|$|E
40|$|The spruce {{bark beetle}} (Ips typographhus) {{is one of the}} 25 000 species of insects in Sweden, an insect of great {{economic}} importance because it can alone terminate forest of high value. During the past decade, insights of climate change received with increasing attention. If the future brings a milder climate in the north and therefore a longer growing season, one would think that it would only affect the forestry to the better? Yet in recent time, outbreaks after storm felling seems to occur more frequently. The Spruce bark beetle ruins millions of cubic meter of Norway spruce (Picea abies) in Sweden alone, with more frequent storm felling and a larger amount of wind thrown threes in the forests there will also be room for an <b>advancing</b> <b>reproduction.</b> The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the importance of how {{spruce bark beetle}} get affected by climate factors and which climate who have the greatest impact on their flight period. The year 2009, forest owners in Medelpad County started to come across several groups of standing dead Norway spruce in the forest. When SCA and the Swedish Forestry Agency made an inventory 2010, they both could determent that it was the spruce bark beetle that caused it. The study has obtained data from the Swedish Forestry Agency during the period 2011 - 2013, the area trap catches are collected on are Kovland in Medelpad and the weather observations are received from the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute. The correlations reported seasonal climate in terms of average temperature and precipitation versus trap catches.

After development, microstructures {{were used in}} soft lithography PDMS molding. After PDMS slabs were cut from the wafer, inlet and outlet ports were punched using a 1  mm biopsy punch. Next, three square regions ~[*] 3.5  mm 2 were cut from the slab to accommodate three square (1 / 8 ″[*]×[*] 1 / 8 ″) grade N 52 neodymium magnets (B 222 G-N 52, KJ magnetics). Next the PDMS slab was bonded to a glass slide with oxygen plasma for 45  s and heat cured for 10  min in an oven at 75  °C. Next, Aquapel (Pittsburgh glass works Pittsburgh, PA) was perfused through droplet channels and dried at 75  °C oven for 10  min. Next, 50  mM (3 -mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane (MPTMS) in acetonitrile was perfused through electrode array channels for 30  s and purged.

Using rubber tipped tweezers a short strip (~[*] 5  mm) of 0.030 ″ diameter 52 In/ 48 Sn low melting temperature solder (Indium Corporation, Clinton, NY) was forced into the electrode array channels pre-treated with MPTMS. After all electrode array channels were filled with solder, the device was removed from the hotplate using wafer tweezers and 60  mm copper wire segments obtained from stripping and separating 28 gauge copper wire (AlphaWire, Elizabeth, NJ) were placed into the electrode array ports using the rubber tweezers. Finally, the device was cooled (10  min) and epoxy was used to cover the fragile copper/metal electrode array contacts and let set overnight.|$|R
40|$|Within populations, the {{expression}} of phenotypic traits typically varies with age. Such age-dependent trait variation {{can be caused by}} within-individual change (improvement, senescence, terminal effects) and/or selective (dis) appearance of certain phenotypes among older age classes. In this study, we applied two methods (decomposition and mixed modelling) to attribute age-dependent variation in seven phenological and reproductive traits to within-individual change and selective (dis) appearance, in a long-lived seabird, the common tern (Sterna hirundo). At the population level, all traits, except the probability to breed, improved with age (i. e. phenology advanced and reproductive output increased). Both methods identified within-individual change as the main responsible process, and, within individuals, performance improved until age 6 - 13, before levelling off. In contrast, within individuals, breeding probability decreased to age 10, then levelled off. Effects of selective appearance and disappearance were small, but showed that longer-lived individuals had a higher breeding probability and bred earlier and that younger recruits performed better throughout life than older recruits in terms of both phenology and reproductive performance. In the year prior to death, individuals <b>advanced</b> <b>reproduction,</b> suggesting terminal investment. The decomposition method attributed more age-dependent trait variation to selective disappearance than the mixed-modelling method: 14 - 36 % versus 0 - 8 %, respectively, which we identify to be due to covariance between rates of within-individual change and selective (dis) appearance leading to biased results from the decomposition method. We conclude that the decomposition method is ideal for visualizing processes underlying population change in performance from one age class to the next, but that a mixed-modelling method is required to investigate the significance and relative contribution of age effects. Considerable variation in the contribution of the different age processes between the seven phenotypic traits studied, as well as notable differences between species in patterns of age-dependent trait expression, calls for better predictions regarding optimal allocation strategies with age...|$|R
