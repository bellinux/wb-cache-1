40|$|Four {{groups of}} eight {{primiparous}} ewes <b>and</b> their single <b>lambs</b> were grazed for 2 weeks on pasture containing {{one of four}} novel grass species - perennial ryegrass, timothy, cocksfoot and red fescue. When subsequently grazed in a field with randomized plots of the four species, both ewes <b>and</b> <b>lambs</b> spent longer grazing the species to {{which they had been}} accustomed than was spent by ewes <b>and</b> <b>lambs</b> accustomed to other species. This effect was proportionately greater for the lambs than the ewes, <b>and</b> the <b>lambs</b> responded most to experience of cocksfoot and red fescue. Both ewes <b>and</b> <b>lambs</b> spent most time grazing perennial ryegrass and timothy, and least time grazing red fescue, with cocksfoot intermediate. It is concluded that perennial ryegrass and timothy are grazed by ewes <b>and</b> <b>lambs</b> in preference to cocksfoot and red fescue, but that a two week period of experience will increase the attractiveness of the less-preferred species, particularly to lambs...|$|R

Lamb shared his idea with several cable executives, who helped him launch the network. Among them were Bob Rosencrans who provided $25,000 of initial funding in 1979 and John D. Evans who provided the wiring and access to the headend needed for the distribution of the C-SPAN signal.|$|E
5|$|Coyotes are {{presently}} {{the most abundant}} livestock predators in western North America, causing the majority of sheep, goat, and cattle losses. For example, according to the National Agricultural Statistics Service, coyotes were responsible for 60.5% of the 224,000 sheep deaths attributed to predation in 2004. The total number of sheep deaths in 2004 comprised 2.22% of the total sheep <b>and</b> <b>lamb</b> population in the United States, which, according to the National Agricultural Statistics Service USDA report, totaled 4.66 million and 7.80 million heads respectively as of July 1, 2005. Because coyote populations are typically many times greater and more widely distributed than those of wolves, coyotes cause more overall predation losses. The United States government agents routinely shoot, poison, trap, and kill about 90,000 coyotes each year to protect livestock. An Idaho census taken in 2005 showed that individual coyotes were 5% as likely to attack livestock than individual wolves.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s, glam metal {{became popular}} with {{groups such as}} Mötley Crüe and Poison.

Since the mid-1990s popular styles have further expanded {{the definition of the}} genre. These include groove metal (with bands such as Pantera, Sepultura, <b>and</b> <b>Lamb</b> of God) and nu metal (with bands such as Korn, Slipknot, and Linkin Park), the latter of which often incorporates elements of grunge and hip hop.|$|E

5|$|Sheepskin is {{likewise}} used for making clothes, footwear, rugs, and other products. Byproducts from {{the slaughter of}} sheep are also of value: sheep tallow {{can be used in}} candle and soap making, sheep bone and cartilage has been used to furnish carved items such as dice and buttons as well as rendered glue and gelatin. Sheep intestine can be formed into sausage casings, <b>and</b> <b>lamb</b> intestine has been formed into surgical sutures, as well as strings for musical instruments and tennis rackets. Sheep droppings, which are high in cellulose, have even been sterilized and mixed with traditional pulp materials to make paper. Of all sheep byproducts, perhaps the most valuable is lanolin: the waterproof, fatty substance found naturally in sheep's wool and used as a base for innumerable cosmetics and other products.|$|E
5|$|The major cereal crops of {{the ancient}} Mediterranean region were wheat, emmer, and barley, while common {{vegetables}} included peas, beans, fava, and olives, dairy products came mostly from sheep and goats, and meat, which was consumed on rare occasion for most people, usually consisted of pork, beef, <b>and</b> <b>lamb.</b> Agriculture in ancient Greece was hindered by the topography of mainland Greece that only allowed for roughly 10% of the land to be cultivated properly, necessitating the specialized exportation of oil and wine and importation of grains from Thrace (centered {{in what is now}} Bulgaria) and the Greek colonies of southern Russia. During the Hellenistic period, the Ptolemaic Empire controlled Egypt, Cyprus, Phoenicia, and Cyrenaica, major grain-producing regions that mainland Greeks depended on for subsistence, while the Ptolemaic grain market also {{played a critical role in}} the rise of the Roman Republic. In the Seleucid Empire, Mesopotamia was a crucial area for the production of wheat, while nomadic animal husbandry was also practiced in other parts.|$|E

40|$|In this study, two {{successive}} {{field trials}} were {{conducted during the}} non-breeding season to investigate various factors affecting on fertility of Suffolk ewes after intrauterine insemination with frozen-thawed semen. In the first year (Experiment 1), three sperm numbers per insemination dose (0. 25, 0. 5 and 1 million sperm) and five sheep farms were used, {{and in the second}} year (Experiment 2), parity, age, body weight, body condition score (BCS) and postpartum days were investigated to compare pregnancy <b>and</b> <b>lambing</b> rates. High pregnancy <b>and</b> <b>lambing</b> rates (70. 6 and 70. 6 %, respectively) were obtained with 0. 25 million sperm per dose. There {{were no significant differences in}} the pregnancy <b>and</b> <b>lambing</b> rates among the five farms, but there was a tendency for one farm to have higher pregnancy (75. 8 %, P= 0. 065) <b>and</b> <b>lambing</b> (72. 7 %, P= 0. 077) rates than those (46. 7 - 53. 3 % and 45. 2 - 53. 3 % for the pregnancy <b>and</b> <b>lambing</b> rates, respectively) of the other farms. In Experiment 2, ewe age significantly affected both the pregnancy <b>and</b> <b>lambing</b> rates. Nulliparous ewes had a higher lambing rate (72. 0 %) than that (44. 2 %) of multiparous ewes, but a significant difference was not revealed. Regardless of body weight, BCS tended to be an important factor influencing on fertility of ewes. Body weight and the postpartum days did not affect the fertility of ewes. It was concluded from these results that the fertility of Suffolk ewes after intrauterine insemination with frozen semen was significantly influenced by sperm number per dose and ewe age. Nulliparous ewes at less than three years of age and with a BCS of more than 3. 0 are expected to have higher fertility than other ewes. [URL]...|$|R
