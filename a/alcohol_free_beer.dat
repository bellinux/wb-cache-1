40|$|Between 1985 and 1990 {{consumption}} of low alcohol and <b>alcohol</b> <b>free</b> <b>beer</b> grew {{at an annual}} rate of 100 %. Yet expectations of a large and expanding market into 1990 's were not fulfilled, partly because of economic downturn. As the economy recovers some brewers are anticipating renewed growth. This paper reports an application of reasoned action theory to the roles of attitudes, norms, behavioural control and habit in predicting behavourial intention in respect of <b>alcohol</b> <b>free</b> <b>beer,</b> in the very different market environment of the 1990 's. Data were collected by means of a questionnaire posted to 400 households, yielding 78 usable responses. Unexpectedly, not getting drunk was not found to be an important predictor of intention. instead, behavioural intention was chiefly determined by beliefs concerning taste and health. Normative influences, especailly friends for non-users, family for users, were secondary predictors. Neither perceived behavioural control or habit were found to add to the predicitive power of the model. Some suggestions for the practical application of the findings are made...|$|E

At the lab-scale process, 2 different parameters were chosen to dealcoholize beer samples, 102 mbar at 50 °C and 200 mbar at 67 °C. Samples taken at different steps of the process were analyzed by HS-SPME–GC–MS focusing on the concentration of 7 flavor compounds, 5 alcohols and 2 esters. For simulation process, the EoS parameters of the Wilson- 2 property package were adjusted to the experimental data and one more pressure was tested (60 mbar). Simulation methods represent {{a viable alternative to}} predict results of the volatile compound composition of a final dealcoholized beer.

40|$|A {{growing demand}} for low-alcohol drinks, due to health and social {{benefits}} resulting from lower alcohol consumption, {{has given rise to}} the development of techniques for alcohol reduction or elimination in beverages. The main difficulty is the development of a low alcohol content product with sensory properties similar to the original one. This work presents a preliminary study on the production of <b>alcohol</b> <b>free</b> <b>beer</b> (alcohol content ≤ 0. 5 %vol) by osmotic distillation technique, which allows to operate at low temperature and atmospheric pressure, using water as ethanol stripping agent. To this goal, a lab-scale plant equipped with a commercial membrane contactor with hollow fibers was set up. The effect of different stripping agents for ethanol removal on dealcoholization kinetics and on chemical and physical properties of the dealcoholized beer (i. e alcohol content, colour, pH, polyphenols, antioxidant activity) was investigated. Finally, the ethanol mass flux through the membrane during the dealcoholization process was measured and theoretically calculated with a good agreement. Copyright © 2013, AIDIC Servizi S. r. l...|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} years, {{there has been}} an {{increasing}} interest in the development of techniques for the production of low <b>alcohol</b> or <b>alcohol</b> <b>free</b> <b>beers,</b> due to a significant increase in consumption of this popular beverage. This is mainly due to health and safety reasons, strict social and religious regulations. Moreover, the interest has been focused towards technological and economic tools able to produce low <b>alcohol</b> and <b>alcohol</b> <b>free</b> <b>beers</b> with satisfactory organoleptic characteristics that can be compared with conventional beers. This study investigated osmotic distillation technique for the dealcoholization of a lager beer up to an alcohol content lower than 1. 2 %vol which is the residual alcohol content for low alcohol beverages in European countries (Brányik et al., 2012). The dealcoholization process was performed in subsequent cycles using water as stripping agent and different values of volume ratio between beer and water. Beers with different alcohol content (0. 47 and 0. 89 %vol) were produced and their chemical and physical properties (i. e. colour, pH, volatile compounds) and healthy traits (i. e. polyphenols, antioxidant activity) were evaluated. Results highlighted no significant differences among regular and dealcoholized beers in terms of colour, pH, polyphenols content and antioxidant activity, although dealcoholized beers had a depletion of volatile compounds with respect to the original one...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} trends in {{development}} of beer industry in Slovakia. It {{is focused on}} the establishing of new microbreweries. Slovak beer market is characterized by high concentration (as a result of globalisation). More than 80 % of beer consumption in Slovakia origins from two large international companies – Heineken Slovakia (owned by Heineken Corporation) and Pivovary Topvar (owned by SAB Corporation) which bought the traditional domestic beer brands. Microbreweries cover only about 4 % of the total market share. Beer consumption was 94 litres per capita (annually) in 2002 but decreased significantly to 73 litres per capita (annually) in 2011. In 2012 and 2013 small increase in beer consumption was achieved. Due to the smaller consumption the production decreased as well. However, new innovative methods and formulas (Radlers, <b>alcohol</b> <b>free</b> <b>beers,</b> premium beers…) helped to stop the decrease of beer production in recent years, partially thanks to the quality beers produced by the new established microbreweries. The results are based on data of The Brewers of Europe and Slovak Beer and Malt Association. To identify the motives for establishing microbreweries, the interviews with owners and managers of Slovak microbreweries were held...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe glutent {{content in}} the {{different}} varieties of barley, malts, and different types of beers were determined by means of "sandwich" enzyme immunoassay. The commercial RIDASCREEN ® Gliadin kit has been used. The gluten level ranges in barley wheat, rye and spelt malts are 18. 8 - 45. 0, 44. 0 - 68. 0, 41. 6, and 21. 2 g kg - 1, respectively. When various types of beer are compared the gluten concentration rise in the following order: <b>alcohol</b> <b>free</b> <b>beer</b> (- 1), stouts (9. 0 - 15. 2 mg l - 1), wheat beers (10. 6 - 41. 2 mg l - 1). Ten Czech lager beers were analysed using both sandwich and competitive ELISA and the obtained results were compared. The latter method provided several times higher values then former one. Gluten balance was done during the brewing process starting from raw materials and terminating at final beer. The amount of protein is decreased due to precipitation of protein during the mashing process, primary and secondary fermentation and last {{as a result of}} adsorption during beer stabilization. The gluten content in beer is for approximately three orders of magnitude lower than that in the raw malt...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{has focused}} on the study of the {{characteristic}} flavour compounds of commercial lager regular (alcoholic) and alcohol-free beers, with special emphasis in the differential flavour compounds between both beer types, and in those volatile compounds that are removed during the vacuum distillation process, which is the <b>alcohol</b> <b>free</b> <b>beer</b> production process more frequently used by Spanish breweries. In the Introduction, the state-of-the-art of the methods and systems used in alcohol-free beer production is described, the main factors affecting the organoleptic characteristics of alcohol-free beers as compared to alcoholic beers are reported in a published review by the authors, and, finally, the analytical techniques currently used in beer compound analysis are reviewed in a published paper. The experimental work of this thesis is report in three sections, each containing the corresponding papers that are either already published or submitted: Section 1 : this section tackles with the methodology and results of an untargeted comparative analysis of commercial beer compounds by using UPLC-QToF-MS measurements and a metabolomics approach for differentiation between regular and alcohol-free beers. Section 2 : reports the methodology used and results obtained in the analysis and profile characterization of volatile flavour compounds in diverse commercial regular and non alcohol beers by HS-SPMEGC-MS. Beers produced in Czech Republic and Spain are compared. Section 3 : covers the methodology used and results obtained in a lab-scale set up of a dealcoholization process by vacuum distillation for routine sampling before, during and after the process. Volatile compound analysis of original beers, distillates and residual dealcoholized product was carried out by HS-SPME/GC-MS. Sixteen beers were used in these experiments. From these sixteen beers, two of them were chosen for sampling at different time periods during the process and analytical data were transferred to the chemical process simulation software HYSYS (Aspen Inc.). Experimental results were fit using the simulation program to a theoretical model with the aim to determine whether such model could be used in predicting the changes in the volatile profile at given pressure and temperature during the dealcoholization process.

40|$|Background: Moderate alcohol {{consumption}} {{has been associated}} with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes in various populations. However, the underlying mechanisms are not entirely clear. The aims of this thesis were 1) to substantiate the evidence of the association between {{alcohol consumption}} and type 2 diabetes in observational research and 2) to examine physiological mechanisms in randomized trials with specific attention to adiponectin, inflammation and insulin sensitivity which may mediate the association between alcohol consumption and type 2 diabetes. Methods: Two prospective cohort studies, one among 38, 031 U. S. men (age: 45 - 75 y) of the Health Professionals Follow up Study (HPFS) and one among 35, 625 Dutch men and women (age: 20 - 70 y) of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) -NL cohort. Four randomized, crossover trials of eight to twelve weeks with consumption of 25 - 30 g alcohol/day in the form of vodka with orange juice, beer, or white wine (twice) compared to orange juice, <b>alcohol</b> <b>free</b> <b>beer,</b> white grape juice or water among 24 young men, 24 premenopausal and 36 and 22 postmenopausal women, respectively. Results: A 7. 5 g/day increase in alcohol consumption over four years was associated with lower diabetes risk among initial non-drinkers (hazard ratio [HR]: 0. 78; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 60, 1. 00) and drinkers initially consuming < 15 g/d (HR: 0. 89; 95 % CI: 0. 83, 0. 96) but not among men initially drinking ≥ 15 g/d (HR: 0. 99; 95 % CI: 0. 95, 1. 02) (Pinteraction < 0. 01) in U. S. men. Among Dutch subjects with ≥ 3 out of 4 low-risk lifestyle behaviors, moderate alcohol consumption was associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes compared with abstention (HR: 0. 56; 95 % CI: 0. 32, 1. 00). In the randomized crossover trials, alcohol consumption consistently increased circulating adiponectin levels by about 10 % compared to abstention (P < 0. 05) regardless of beverage type, gender or age. These increases were evident after a minimum of three weeks of alcohol consumption. Moderate alcohol consumption also increased expression of the gene encoding adiponectin in adipose tissue and lowered serum fasting insulin and triglyceride levels (all P < 0. 05). An integrated approach of large-scale profiling of proteins and genes revealed that moderate alcohol consumption for four weeks altered gene expression profiles of white blood cells and circulating markers related to inflammation in men (all P < 0. 05). However, we did not observe an attenuated inflammatory response after a low-dose in vivo endotoxin bolus, despite increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein levels after four weeks of alcohol consumption compared to abstention. Six minutes of oral white wine exposure without swallowing substantially (- 20 %; P < 0. 05) and temporarily (~ 20 min) decreased circulating free fatty acid concentrations compared with oral water exposure. Conclusions: Moderate alcohol consumption was associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes compared with abstention. The association persisted among subjects already at low risk based on combined favorable lifestyle behaviors. Also, increases in alcohol consumption among initially rare and light drinking men were associated with higher adiponectin levels and lower risk of type 2 diabetes. Increased adiponectin levels, anti-inflammatory effects and decreased insulin and triglyceride levels, may partially explain the inverse association between moderate alcohol consumption and type 2 diabetes...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Food {{processing}} {{industries are}} one of the major industrial groups in developing countries which {{play an important role in}} the economic development of these countries. With the Developed and Developing Food Industry on the other hand, food security and providing food are very important in each country. In an overview, markets are divided into two groups: The first group is a market with perfect competition. And second group is markets with monopoly structure. One of the important features of markets that determine its type is the ability of the firms in the pricing and determiningof the amount of production. If the firms do not have any effect on these two factors, themarket has perfect competition. If the firms have the ability to influence price of productions, this market is non-competitive and a concept called market power emerges. In general, not only market power is the ability of firm in determination of price above the competitive situation, but also it does not let its share of sale to decrease. The existence of collusion in markets can makethem distantfrom perfect competition and make them incomplete. In economics and particularly in industrial organization, market power is the ability of a firm to profitably raise the market price of a good or service over marginal cost. In perfect competitive markets, market participants have no market power. A firm with total market power can raise prices without losing any customers to competitors. Firms that have power to set price are referred to as "price makers" or "price setters", while those without itare sometimes called "price-takers". Significant market power occurs when prices exceed marginal cost and the long run average cost, so the firm makes economic profits. A firm with market power has the ability to individually affect either the total quantity or the prevailing price in the market. Price makers face a downward slopingdemand curve, such that increases in price leads to a lower quantity of demand. The decrease in supply as a result of the exercise of market power creates an economic deadweight loss which is often viewed as socially undesirable. As a result, many countries have anti-trustor other legislation to limit the ability of firms to create market power. Such legislation often regulates mergers and sometimes introduces a judicial power to compel divestiture. A firm usually has market power by virtue of controlling a large portion of the market. In extreme cases—monopoly and monopsony—the firm controls the entire market. However, market size alone is not the only indicator of market power. Highly concentrated markets may be contestable if there are no barriers to entry or exit, limiting the incumbent firm's ability to raise its price above competitive levels. Market power gives firms the ability to engage in unilateral anti-competitive behavior. [1] Some of the behaviors that firms with market power are accused of engaging in include predatory pricing, product tying, and creation of overcapacity or other barriers to entry. If no individual participant in the market has significant market power, then anti-competitive behavior can take place only through collusion, or the exercise of a group of participants' collective market power. The Lerner index and Herfindahl index may be used to measure market power. Examination of market power of different industries provides possibility that policymakers design and deliver model for processing food and beverage producers to guide them to the product that has the most social benefits. Materials and Methods: The main purpose of this study is to assess and identify market structure and market power and estimate coefficient of collusion in the food and beverage industry. Estimates of market power in the food and beverage industry in Iran are few when compared with similar studies overseas. For local studies we can cite papers such as Alijani&Sabuhi (4), Sheikh zeinodin&Bakhshude (3), Safdarhoseiniet all (2), Mazhari&Yazdani. Yet,foreign studies conducted in this area are varied in different sectors. For example, the studies Angelini&cetorell (15) andRezitis (24) in the banking system can be mentioned. Of the other foreign studies Leo (21), Bresnahan (12), Abayasiri (8), Boyle & Hall (14), Saitone& etal. (25), Koontz (20), Duravall (17), Steen (29), Salhofer and etAl. (28), Allender (10), Siton and et al. (25), Rigoberto et all (22), Lopez & etal. (22), Oustapassidis& etal. (23) can be cited. The model in this paper to estimate market power used for the food and beverage industries has been developed by Bresnahan& Leo. In this model,by considering demand and supply market powercan be investigated. In the next step, marginal cost (cost function is Translog cost) and marginal revenue will be obtained. In the final step,by estimatingthe final equation market power can be calculated. The type of industrial classification used in this study is the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC). This kind of classification is widely used for empirical studies because of lack of industrial data on the basis of other classifications. We use firm level data aggregated to the 4 - digit ISIC code of industries. The purpose of this study is to estimate the market structure and market power of the food and drink industry in Iran. For estimating market power, conjectural variation is used. Results and DiscussionIn oligopoly theory, conjectural variation is the belief that one firm has about the way its competitors may react if it varies its output or price. The firm forms a conjecture about the variation in the other firm's output that will accompany any change in its own output. For example, in the classic Cournot model of oligopoly, it is assumed that each firm treats the output of the other firms as given when it chooses its output. This is sometimes called the "Nash conjecture" as it underlies the standard Nash equilibrium concept. However, alternative assumptions can be made. Suppose you have two firms producing the same good, so that the industry price is determined by the combined output of the two firms (think of the water duopoly in Cournot's original 1838 account). Now suppose that each firm has what is called the "Bertrand Conjecture" of − 1. This means that if firm A increases its output, it conjectures that firm B will reduce its output to exactly offset firm A's increase, so that the total output and hence price remain unchanged. With the Bertrand Conjecture, the firms act as if they believe that the market price is unaffected by their own output, because each firm believes that the other firm will adjust its output so that total output will be constant. At the other extreme is the Joint-Profit maximizing conjecture of + 1. In this case each firm believes that the other firm will imitate exactly any change it makes in output, which leads (with constant marginal cost) to the firms behaving like a single monopoly supplier. The results show that it is significant uncompetitive pattern for 18 of the 19 industries. Existence of oligopoly industry for 12 shows the non-competitiveness of this industry. The flour and cereals production industry has 2. 24 degrees of collusion and the tea industry has 2. 14 degrees of collusion. Degree of conjectural variation is between 0. 43 and 2. 24. These numbers are related to carbonated soft drinks industry and production of flour and cereals. Conclusion: This paper discusses the Market Structure and the Degree of Market Power and Collusion Index of Food and Beverage industry on the basis of Modern Industrial Organization (NEIO) with Bresnahan- Leo (1982) Approach. For this Purpose, data of ISIC Four- Digit Code is used to investigate the 19 industries for the years 2005 - 2011. The result showsthat competitive conditions for 18 Industriesaresignificant. The degree of Market Power is between 0. 43 and 2. 24. 12. The industry has Oligopolistic Market and Production of Oil and Fat Industry has a Monopoly Market close to perfect. Conjectural Variation for the Industry of Flour and Tea isvery high, with 2. 42 and 2. 14, respectively. Except malt and alcohol-free beer industry, uncompetitive model is significant for other industries. In summary, industries with a high degree of collusion will include: processing and preserving of fruit, sugar production, bakery, livestock slaughtering and poultry. Industries with a low degree of collusion will include: production of animal and vegetable oils and fats, tea making, producing Malt and <b>alcohol</b> <b>free</b> <b>beer.</b> Industries that follow Cournot Model will include tea making. Industries with coefficient of collusion between 2 and 5 will include: processing and preserving of fish, dairy products, animal feed production and the production of sugar, bakery, bread, pastries, biscuitsand soft drinks. Industries with a competitive model will include date palm sorting...|$|E
