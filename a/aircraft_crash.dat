5|$|Elwyn Roy King's name {{appears on}} panel97 in the Commemorative Area of the Australian War Memorial, Canberra. His {{youngest}} brother Francis, {{who served as}} a flying officer with No.30 Squadron in New Guinea, died in an <b>aircraft</b> <b>crash</b> on 31May 1943.|$|E
5|$|NOVA {{created a}} {{classroom}} activity kit for school teachers, using the crash {{as an example}} of an <b>aircraft</b> <b>crash</b> investigation. The Canadian poet Jacob McArthur Mooney's 2011 collection, Folk, tangentially interrogates the disaster and its effect on Nova Scotia residents.|$|E
5|$|The {{strategic}} {{position of the}} Low Countries, located between France and Germany on the uncovered flanks of their fortification lines, made the area a logical route for an offensive by either side. In a 20 January 1940 radio speech, Winston Churchill tried to convince them not to wait for an inevitable German attack, but to join the Anglo-French Entente. Both the Belgians and Dutch refused, even though the German attack plans had fallen into Belgian hands after a German <b>aircraft</b> <b>crash</b> in January 1940, in {{what became known as}} the Mechelen Incident.|$|E
5000|$|On 4 January 2001, two PLAAF Y-8s (31242 and 31243) {{crashed on}} {{approach}} to Zhangzhou Air Base, killing all 16 crew on board both aircraft. Six {{people on the}} ground also died when one of the <b>aircraft</b> <b>crashed</b> into a house; it is unknown which <b>aircraft</b> <b>crashed</b> into the house. Official reports stated that both <b>aircraft</b> <b>crashed</b> as a result of tail icing, but other reports state that the aircraft collided in mid-air.|$|R
25|$|The <b>aircraft</b> <b>crashed</b> around 21:30 {{local time}} while on an NDB {{approach}} to Alférez FAP Alfredo Vladimir Sara Bauer Airport at Andoas. The <b>aircraft</b> <b>crashed</b> 3 miles short of Andoas. It {{was scheduled to}} arrive at Andoas at 21:17 local time.|$|R
50|$|The <b>aircraft</b> <b>crashed</b> due to {{incorrect}} indications by {{the main}} artificial horizon and the compass system, caused by {{a failure of the}} electrical supply, resulting in spatial disorientation of the pilots. The <b>aircraft</b> <b>crashed</b> approximately five miles from Koltsovo Airport.|$|R
5|$|Barrowclough's {{opportunity}} {{for a return to}} duty overseas came following the death of Mead in an <b>aircraft</b> <b>crash</b> in July 1942. At the time of Mead's death, the Pacific Section was being recalled to New Zealand for reorganisation into a division for offensive operations in the South Pacific. In August, Barrowclough was named as commander of what was now known as the 3rd New Zealand Division. He immediately overhauled its structure and removed many officers who he considered too old for frontline duty, replacing them with personnel who had experience with the 2NZEF in Greece, Crete or North Africa. He also implemented training programs for his new command; most of its personnel had been engaged in the construction of fortifications while in Fiji, which had left little {{opportunity for}} intensive tactical training and exercises.|$|E
5|$|The Man's <b>aircraft</b> <b>crash</b> lands at night. The {{following}} morning he continues on foot. The Brute {{returns to the}} hospital with a new box of items, though this time he constructs a device that will keep the door open long enough for him to enter the building. The plan works, however, once back inside the building The Doctor pulls a lever which closes a secondary iron bar gate preventing The Brute from entering. The Man finds an abandoned bar, get himself heavily intoxicated and passes out. When he awakes, he ventures outside where he is amazed that it is raining fish. While searching for a way to cook the fish, The Man encounters The Brute. A fight ensues; the Brute gains the upper hand though The Man is able to escape.|$|E
5|$|The fate of L'Oiseau Blanc is {{occasionally}} {{mentioned in}} films. The 1999 made-for-TV Canadian film Restless Spirits, a children's film with the alternate title Dead Aviators, uses {{the mystery of}} Nungesser and Coli's disappearance as the key plot device. A young girl, who struggles with her pilot father's death in an <b>aircraft</b> <b>crash</b> years before, visits her grandmother in Newfoundland. While there, she encounters the ghosts of Nungesser and Coli, whose restless spirits constantly relive their own unheralded 1927 crash in a nearby pond. The girl decides to help the pair {{move on to the}} afterlife by assisting them in rebuilding their aircraft and completing their flight so they may be released and, by doing so, works through her own emotional distress over her father's test flight death. And in the opening montage of the 2005 film Sahara, based on Cussler's novel, a French newspaper article is displayed reporting a fictional story of NUMA finding the aircraft.|$|E
25|$|On 14 September 2017, a Royal Saudi Air Force <b>aircraft</b> <b>crashed</b> in Yemen's Abhyan {{province}} while {{carrying out}} a combat mission, killing its pilot. According to a Saudi Government press release, the <b>aircraft</b> <b>crashed</b> due to technical reasons and pilot Lt Col Muhanna Al-Baiz did not survive.|$|R

5|$|Trautloft noticed {{three of}} {{a flight of}} six intercepting Hurricanes of No. 32 {{squadron}} higher than the escorts, attempting to intercept the bombers. Soon {{they were joined by}} four squadrons of British fighters: No. 56 Squadron, No. 111 Squadron, No. 64 Squadron and No. 74 Squadron. Oesau was able to claim three Spitfires. Two 7./JG 51 <b>aircraft</b> <b>crash</b> landed in France. British losses show that no Spitfire was lost or destroyed in the ensuing battle. Only one No. 32 Hurricane, piloted by Pilot Officer Higgs, was destroyed in a collision with one of the Do 17s and only one other Hurricane was damaged. It is possible Oesau was responsible for damaging Higgs' Hurricane, causing him to lose control. Two Spitfires landed with light damage while a third was also slightly damaged and force-landed at RAF Manston. Over claiming of enemy losses was rife on both sides during the battle.|$|E
5|$|The {{program was}} {{directed}} by Daniel De Felippo and Rodolfo Antúnez, and produced by César Markus González. Most of the filming occurred {{at the headquarters of}} Pol-ka in the Colegiales neighborhood. The telenovela took several risks in the creative and production fields, which were mostly successful. The choice of Martín Quesada's background as a Formula 1 driver required an area with a large infrastructure to represent realistic races. For realism, plot scenes set outside Buenos Aires were actually filmed outside the city. There was significant press coverage during the location shooting in Germany, which took place during the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Facundo Arana and Natalia Oreiro played their characters in the Veltins-Arena stadium during the Argentina-Serbia and Montenegro match. The result of the matcha 6–0 Argentine victorybenefited the filming, and the episode received 31.5 rating points. Location shooting also occurred in the tourist ski resort Las Leñas in the Andes. A simulated <b>aircraft</b> <b>crash</b> that left the characters in a jungle was filmed at the Pereyra Iraola park and an Argentine Air Force park in Morón.|$|E
