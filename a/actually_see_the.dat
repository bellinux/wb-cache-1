5|$|In Sicily, the {{decision}} was taken not just for fashion and appearance {{but also because it}} would minimise the damage to property and life likely to be caused in future quakes. In 1693, the cramped housing and streets had caused buildings to collapse together like dominoes. Although after the earthquake the avenues were broadened and the density of housing was lowered overall, cramped and narrow areas of housing still remained, posing a hazard for the poor. Architecturally and aesthetically, the big advantage of the new order of town planning was that unlike many Italian towns and cities, where one frequently encounters a monumental Renaissance church squeezed terrace fashion between incongruous neighbours, in urban Baroque design one can step back and <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> architecture in a more conducive setting in relation to its proportions and perspective. This is most notable in the largely rebuilt towns of Caltagirone, Militello in Val di Catania, Catania, Modica, Noto, Palazzolo Acreide, Ragusa, and Scicli.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{beginning}} of AH 1423 (16 March 2002), the rule has been clarified a little by requiring the geocentric conjunction {{of the sun and}} moon to occur before sunset, in addition to requiring moonset to occur after sunset at Mecca. This ensures that the moon has moved past the sun by sunset, even though the sky may still be too bright immediately before moonset to <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> crescent.|$|E
25|$|According to {{an article}} {{published}} in American Psychologist in 2007, the original story of Genovese's murder was exaggerated by the media. Specifically, there were not 38 eyewitnesses, the police were contacted at least once during the attack, and many of the bystanders who overheard the attack could not <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> event. The authors of the article suggest that the story continues to be misrepresented in social psychology textbooks because it functions as a parable and serves as a dramatic example for students.|$|E

2500|$|Senator Steven’s {{called the}} show “perverted” but later conceded to Newsweek {{magazine}} {{he had not}} <b>actually</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> exhibit on the West but had ..."merely been alerted by the comment posted by Daniel Boorstin in the museum’s guestbook." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{spite of}} the LDS Church's current claims, {{evidence}} shows {{that none of the}} eleven witnesses claimed to have <b>actually</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> physical gold plates. Instead, they reported visualizing them [...] "with spiritual eyes" [...] in a prayer-induced trance state.|$|R
500|$|Thulium was so {{rare that}} none of the early workers had enough of it to purify {{sufficiently}} to <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> green color; they had to be content with spectroscopically observing the strengthening of the two characteristic absorption bands, as erbium was progressively removed. [...] The first researcher to obtain nearly pure thulium was Charles James, a British expatriate working on a large scale at New Hampshire College in Durham. In 1911 he reported his results, having used his discovered method of bromate fractional crystallization to do the purification. [...] He famously needed 15,000 purification operations to establish that the material was homogeneous.|$|E
500|$|The plot is padded with a {{large amount}} of filler. [...] Films of this type were usually {{produced}} quickly and at minimal cost, and while filler was sometimes used to increase the production value, the usual motivation was to extend its running time to qualify for feature length status. [...] Eric Schaefer notes that the [...] "primary purpose" [...] of the plot of Mom and Dad [...] was to [...] "serve as the vehicle onto which the spectacle of the clinical reels can be grafted", such as the live birth scene. [...] The marketing materials suggest the latter reason also, and many posters for the film promised that [...] "You [...] <b>actually</b> <b>SEE</b> <b>the</b> birth of a baby!" [...] The dialogue is carefully worded, and uses period euphemisms rather than explicit terms that may have been controversial at the time. [...] In particular, at no time does the film specifically mention sexual intercourse or pregnancy.|$|E
500|$|In 2013, Khan {{appeared}} in three films, the first being Vishal Bhardwaj's Matru Ki Bijlee Ka Mandola, a political satire {{set in the}} rustic surroundings of a village in Haryana. Co-starring with Pankaj Kapur, Anushka Sharma and Shabana Azmi, Khan played Hukum Singh Matru, an educated community activist and Kapur's right-hand man. To prepare for the role, he lived in Delhi for three months and learned to speak Haryanvi from theatre group Act One. The film (and his performance) generated mixed reviews from critics, and its eventual box-office profit was poor. Reuters Shilpa Jamkhandikar wrote, [...] "Imran Khan goes {{red in the face}} trying to muster up a Haryanvi accent and act tough. You can <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> effort in his acting and that's why it jars all the more." [...] Subhash K Jha described it as a good effort, at best. Khan also sang for the film's soundtrack in [...] "Chaar Dina Ki".|$|E

50|$|Continuing {{with the}} drive, Valance relates {{around the campfire}} one evening that the {{railroad}} has reached Abilene, Kansas, which is much closer than Sedalia.

500|$|Antonia Coffman, a {{spokeswoman}} for The Simpsons, told The Charlotte Observer that [...] "the Lowe's incident didn't inspire the scene" [...] and that the episode {{was not meant to}} offend anyone. After WCCB had gotten the opportunity to <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> episode they decided that they would air it, realizing that the original commercial was misleading and that they did not think the episode was making fun of the incident. In the episode, the viewers can see that Lenny tries {{to get the attention of}} the cheerleaders by raising his hand so that they aim a T-shirt with the cannon at him. However, he is hit by a car tire instead. Unlike what the commercial implied, Lenny is not killed and is soon back in his seat. WCCB told the Associated Press that their interpretation of the scene was that someone threw the tire to Lenny because he was raising his hand, and that the tire did not actually come from a car crash on the track. Despite this, the affiliate announced that they would start the broadcast of the episode with a message warning viewers of the scene anyway.|$|E
500|$|Rhys has a {{one-night stand}} with Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer) not long after his introduction. Rhys meets Kate in the local bar {{and they have a}} [...] "big night out"; the {{following}} morning Kate wakes up in Rhys' apartment. Brewer told a writer for Inside Soap [...] "You don't <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> lead-up– one minute she meets Rhys in a bar, the next minute we see that they've already slept together!" [...] Kate feels awkward about the situation, but it is made worse when she is unable to remember Rhys' name. When Kate and Rhys meet again, they have different attitudes to their one-night stand. Brewer said Rhys is [...] "a bit of a player", so it is not a big deal to him. He does not have any expectations of Kate, but she is uncomfortable with it and tries to cover her tracks. In November 2011, Brewer said {{it would be interesting to}} revisit the relationship between Rhys and Kate. Barber also thought it would be interesting to see where the characters could go together. The actor added that [...] "sparks fly" [...] when Rhys is around Kate, as he knows how to [...] "press her buttons".|$|E
2500|$|He {{played a}} spoof {{of himself in}} the Brooklyn Nine Nine season 4 episode [...] "The Fugitive Part 1." [...] He is in the {{vicinity}} of a prisoner breakout, though he did not <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> crime and spends all screen time discussing his pico de gallo.|$|E
2500|$|Blind Date – The [...] that Weebl {{arranges}} for Bob {{to cheer}} {{him up in}} [...] "Date." [...] Bob doesn't realise that his blind date IS literally a blind date, who is also dyslexic, until he <b>actually</b> <b>sees</b> <b>the</b> date. He {{is one of the}} few characters who opens his mouth when speaking.|$|R
5000|$|The {{fact that}} none of his contemporaries had <b>actually</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> masque allowed Jonson to re-use {{material}} from the text in subsequent works. Some [...] "lyrical passages" [...] from Neptune's Triumph re-appeared in the next year's masque The Fortunate Isles and Their Union, while comedy material from the anti-masque that satirizes Inigo Jones is employed in The Staple of News (1626).|$|R
5000|$|Apart {{from the}} {{requisite}} filming of the Rio Carnival, Welles knew {{only that he}} wanted to recreate the voyage of the jangadeiros. There was no time to prepare a script: [...] "No script was possible until Welles had <b>actually</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> carnival," [...] wrote Welles's executive assistant Richard Wilson. [...] "RKO and the Coordinators Office understood this, and these were the ground rules accepted by all." ...|$|R
2500|$|In November 2013, Mari Yamaguchi {{reported}} for Associated Press {{that there are}} computer simulations which suggest that [...] "the melted fuel in Unit 1, whose core damage was the most extensive, has breached {{the bottom of the}} primary containment vessel and even partially eaten into its concrete foundation, coming within about 30 centimeters (one foot) of leaking into the ground" [...] – a Kyoto University nuclear engineer said with regards to these estimates: [...] "We just can't be sure until we <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> inside of the reactors." ...|$|E
2500|$|East Anglia is bordered to {{the north}} and east by the North Sea, to the south by the estuary of the River Thames and shares an {{undefined}} land border to the west with the rest of England. Much of northern East Anglia is flat, low-lying and marshy (such as the Fens of Cambridgeshire and Norfolk), although the extensive drainage projects of the past centuries actually make this one of the driest areas in the UK. Inland {{much of the rest of}} Suffolk and Norfolk is gently undulating, with glacial moraine ridges providing some areas of steeper areas relief. The supposed flatness of the Norfolk landscape is noted in many famous pieces of literature, such as Noël Coward's Private Lives – [...] "Very flat, Norfolk" [...] and often leads to some confusion when people <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> relief.|$|E
2500|$|Evans officially {{began working}} on American Bibliography - his lifelong goal - in 1901 and {{compiled}} it over a course of years through 1934. [...] Originally, Evans stored his notecards in corset boxes with the dates contained within written on the illustration's waistline. Publication took a few hiatuses during WWII in between volumes, but eventually, all desired volumes were published, including some that were published posthumously by outsiders eager to continue Evans' work, particularly Roger Bristol. The first volume was published by Evans himself and covered the span of 1639-1740. [...] All succeeding volumes were published on borrowed money for both publication purposes and travel purposes, as Evans preferred to travel around the United States in order to <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> books he was including in his work, though when he wasn’t able to travel, {{he was known to}} include “ghost” titles, as well as skip publications altogether due to the amount of space, and therefore money, they would take up in his printed book. [...] It is said that American Bibliography lacks a proper representation of Harvard dissertations and broadsides.|$|E
60|$|The head {{carpenter}} {{abandoned the}} silent policy of a lifetime. He felt impelled to utter. He {{was a man}} who, when not at the theatre, {{spent most of his}} time in bed, reading all-fiction magazines; but it so happened that once, last summer, he had <b>actually</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> sky; and he considered that this entitled him to speak almost as a specialist on the subject.|$|R

60|$|Indeed, {{it seems}} an {{exceedingly}} plausible conclusion that peering into this crystal Mr. Cave did <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> planet Mars and its inhabitants.

6000|$|... 117 I use {{the words}} “straight line” for brevity and simplicity.

60|$|Men have {{constantly}} {{been asking}} themselves what the great literary precursors of the Revolution would have thought, {{and how they}} would have acted, {{if they could have}} survived to the days of the Terror. What would Voltaire have said of Robespierre? How would Rousseau have borne himself at the Jacobin Club? Would Diderot have followed the procession of the Goddess of Reason? To ask whether these famous men would have sanctioned the Terror, is to insult great memories; but {{there is no reason to}} suppose that their strong spirits would have faltered. One or two of the younger generation of the famous philosophic party did <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> break-up of the old order. Condorcet faced the storm with a heroism of spirit that has never been surpassed: disgust at the violent excesses of bad men could never make him unfaithful to the beneficence of the movement which their frenzy distorted.|$|E
60|$|And {{talking of}} awkward places, I had {{forgotten}} about that spot upon the road whence the Boche observer could see our motor-cars. He had actually laid a gun upon it, the rascal, and waited all the long day for our return. No sooner did we appear upon the slope than a shrapnel shell burst above us, but somewhat behind me, {{as well as to}} the left. Had it been straight the second car would have got it, and there might have been a vacancy in one of the chief editorial chairs in London. The General shouted to the driver to speed up, and we were soon safe from the German gunners. One gets perfectly immune to noises in these scenes, for the guns which surround you make louder crashes than any shell which bursts about you. It is only when you <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> cloud over you that your thoughts come back to yourself, and that you realise that in this wonderful drama you may be a useless super, but none the less you are on the stage and not in the stalls.|$|E
60|$|Our {{theory of}} truth, to begin with, {{supplies}} {{the possibility of}} distinguishing certain truths as self-evident in a sense which ensures infallibility. When a belief is true, we said, there is a corresponding fact, in which the several objects of the belief form a single complex. The belief is said to constitute knowledge of this fact, provided it fulfils those further somewhat vague conditions which we have been considering in the present chapter. But in regard to any fact, besides the knowledge constituted by belief, we may also {{have the kind of}} knowledge constituted by perception (taking this word in its widest possible sense). For example, if you know the hour of the sunset, you can at that hour know the fact that the sun is setting: this is knowledge of the fact by way of knowledge of truths; but you can also, if the weather is fine, look to the west and <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> setting sun: you then know the same fact by the way of knowledge of things.|$|E
