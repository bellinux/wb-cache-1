5|$|In DNA replication, DNA-dependent DNA polymerases {{make copies}} of DNA polynucleotide chains. To {{preserve}} biological information, {{it is essential that}} the sequence of bases in each copy are precisely complementary to the sequence of bases in the template strand. Many DNA polymerases have a proofreading activity. Here, the polymerase recognizes the occasional mistakes in the synthesis reaction by the lack of base pairing between the mismatched nucleotides. If <b>a</b> <b>mismatch</b> is detected, a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity is activated and the incorrect base removed. In most organisms, DNA polymerases function in a large complex called the replisome that contains multiple accessory subunits, such as the DNA clamp or helicases.|$|E

5|$|A bypass {{platform}} is provided to these polymerases by Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Under normal circumstances, PCNA bound to polymerases replicates the DNA. At {{a site of}} lesion, PCNA is ubiquitinated, or modified, by the RAD6/RAD18 proteins to provide a platform for the specialized polymerases to bypass the lesion and resume DNA replication. After translesion synthesis, extension is required. This extension {{can be carried out}} by a replicative polymerase if the TLS is error-free, {{as in the case of}} Pol η, yet if TLS results in <b>a</b> <b>mismatch,</b> a specialized polymerase is needed to extend it; Pol ζ. Pol ζ is unique in that it can extend terminal mismatches, whereas more processive polymerases cannot. So when a lesion is encountered, the replication fork will stall, PCNA will switch from a processive polymerase to a TLS polymerase such as Pol ι to fix the lesion, then PCNA may switch to Pol ζ to extend the mismatch, and last PCNA will switch to the processive polymerase to continue replication.|$|E
5|$|Most sexually {{reproducing}} {{organisms are}} diploid, with paired chromosomes, but doubling of their chromosome number may occur due to errors in cytokinesis. This can occur early in development {{to produce an}} autopolyploid or partly autopolyploid organism, or during normal processes of cellular differentiation to produce some cell types that are polyploid (endopolyploidy), or during gamete formation. An allopolyploid plant may result from a hybridisation event between two different species. Both autopolyploid and allopolyploid plants can often reproduce normally, but {{may be unable to}} cross-breed successfully with the parent population because there is <b>a</b> <b>mismatch</b> in chromosome numbers. These plants that are reproductively isolated from the parent species but live within the same geographical area, may be sufficiently successful to form a new species. Some otherwise sterile plant polyploids can still reproduce vegetatively or by seed apomixis, forming clonal populations of identical individuals. Durum wheat is a fertile tetraploid allopolyploid, while bread wheat is a fertile hexaploid. The commercial banana {{is an example of a}} sterile, seedless triploid hybrid. Common dandelion is a triploid that produces viable seeds by apomictic seed.|$|E
5|$|While pre-dreadnoughts {{were adopted}} worldwide, {{there were no}} clashes between pre-dreadnought battleships {{until the very end}} of their period of dominance. The First Sino-Japanese War in 1894–95 {{influenced}} pre-dreadnought development, but this had been a clash between Chinese battleships and a Japanese fleet consisting of mostly cruisers. The Spanish–American War of 1898 was also <b>a</b> <b>mismatch,</b> with the American pre-dreadnought fleet engaging Spanish cruisers. Not until the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05 did pre-dreadnoughts engage on an equal footing. This happened in three battles: the Russian tactical victory during the Battle of Port Arthur on 8–9 February 1904, the indecisive Battle of the Yellow Sea on 10 August 1904, and the decisive Japanese victory at the Battle of Tsushima on 27 May 1905. These battles upended prevailing theories of how naval battles would be fought, as the fleets began firing at one another at much greater distances than before; naval architects realized that plunging fire (explosive shells falling on their targets largely from above, instead of from a trajectory close to horizontal) was a much greater threat than had been thought.|$|E

25|$|Start {{with one}} setting exactly {{opposite}} to the other. All the pairs of particles {{give the same}} outcome (each pair is either both spin up or both spin down). Now shift Alice's setting by one degree relative to Bob's. They are now one degree off being exactly opposite to one another. A {{small fraction of the}} pairs, say f, now give different outcomes. If instead we had left Alice's setting unchanged but shifted Bob's by one degree (in the opposite direction), then again a fraction f of the pairs of particles turns out to give different outcomes. Finally consider what happens when both shifts are implemented at the same time: the two settings are now exactly two degrees away from being opposite to one another. By the mismatch argument, the chance of <b>a</b> <b>mismatch</b> at two degrees can't be more than twice the chance of <b>a</b> <b>mismatch</b> at one degree: it cannot be more than 2f.|$|E

Impacted wisdom teeth can also be classified by the presence or absence of symptoms and disease. Screening for the presence of wisdom teeth often begins in late adolescence when a partially developed tooth may become impacted. Screening commonly includes clinical examination as well as x-rays such as panoramic radiographs.|$|E

This paper starts with a description and a comparison of two algorithms that are commonly used in the literature: a stochastic method and a deterministic one (a gradient descent). Then, an alternative method based on the Random Walk Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is proposed, that takes the gradient as a search direction. It provides better results than a steepest descent alone. Finally, this autocorrelation question is handled differently, considering <b>a</b> <b>mismatched</b> filter.

30|$|It is also {{necessary}} to underline that this study uses a perfectly matching attenuation image to correct for attenuation during the PET measurement. In a previous study [10], we proved {{that the use of}} <b>a</b> <b>mismatched</b> attenuation image can affect the subsequent PVC of the PET dataset with anatomical information in two ways. Firstly, the use of <b>a</b> <b>mismatched</b> attenuation correction can create fake, hypo-active areas in the LV depending on the direction and the amount of the displacement of the AC CT relative to the PET dataset. This could result by itself in errors in the quantification of the (lesions in the) LV. In addition, the correction of the PET dataset with <b>a</b> <b>mismatched</b> attenuation image can mislead the registration of the anatomical image for PVC to the activity image. This, in turn, would result in wrong PVC (as in one of our simulated cases where the anatomy is mismatched relative to the activity image). Therefore, the results presented in this work have to be considered as the best-case scenario, where the attenuation map used does not hamper the registration nor the quantification and image quality.|$|R

25|$|Additionally, {{given the}} {{component}} of anger {{as a social}} construct, difficulty with communication between cultures can serve as another impediment. What is deemed an appropriate expression of anger is culturally dependent. Therefore, <b>a</b> <b>mismatch</b> between client and therapist {{could result in a}} misunderstanding as to the end goal of the program. For example, a client could only wish to decrease physical violence, while the therapist aims to decrease both verbal and physical outbursts. Gender dependent expectations of anger expression can contribute as well to societal standards. The same violent outburst for a man and woman is subject to different interpretations due to anger being seen as more permissible in males.|$|E

25|$|A key path is a {{specific}} file, registry key, or ODBC data source that the package author specifies as critical for a given component. Because a file {{is the most common}} type of key path, the term key file is commonly used.

When an MSI-based program is launched, Windows Installer checks the existence of key paths. If there is <b>a</b> <b>mismatch</b> between the current system state and the value specified in the MSI package (e.g., a key file is missing), the related feature is re-installed. This process is known as self-healing or self-repair. No two components should use the same key path.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the classification of}} linear subspaces with mismatched classifiers. In particular, we assume a model where one observes signals {{in the presence of}} isotropic Gaussian noise and the distribution of the signals conditioned on a given class is Gaussian with a zero mean and a low-rank covariance matrix. We also assume that the classifier knows only <b>a</b> <b>mismatched</b> version of the parameters of input distribution in lieu of the true parameters. By constructing an asymptotic low-noise expansion of an upper bound to the error probability of such <b>a</b> <b>mismatched</b> classifier, we provide sufficient conditions for reliable classification in the low-noise regime that are able to sharply predict the absence of a classification error floor. Such conditions are a function of the geometry of the true signal distribution, the geometry of the mismatched signal distributions as well as the interplay between such geometries, namely, the principal angles and the overlap between the true and the mismatched signal subspaces. Numerical results demonstrate that our conditions for reliable classification can sharply predict the behavior of <b>a</b> <b>mismatched</b> classifier both with synthetic data and in a motion segmentation and a hand-written digit classification applications.
