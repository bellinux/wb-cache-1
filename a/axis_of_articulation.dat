A minimum of three views of the articulated object in motion are required to recover the projective position of the articulation axis. No camera calibration is required. The method given here is a significant improvement on a previous method, doing away entirely {{with the need to}} use the fundamental matrix in building an intermediate constraint [19]. This paper also extends the Euclidean structure from uncalibrated stereo result of Faugeras [3] to use the second link in an articulated system effectively as a virtual second camera. Euclidean structure may then be recovered by observing an articulated object in motion with a single uncalibrated camera. 1 Introduction This paper is concerned with the problem of interpreting visual motion seen with an uncalibrated camera. Specifically how to distinguish ordinary unconstrained independent motion from articulated motion and then how t [...] ...|$|E

50|$|Members of Carnivora have a {{characteristic}} skull shape with relatively large brains {{encased in a}} heavy skull. The skull has a highly developed zygomatic arch just behind the maxilla (common to all mammals and their cynodont forebears), and they have ossified external auditory bullae. Feloidea have a two-chambered auditory bulla. In addition to allowing extra room for the passage of muscles to work the lower jaw, the zygomatic arch also allows for differentiation of separate muscle groups {{to be involved in}} biting and chewing. Masseters attach from the dentary (specifically, the masseteric fossa) to the zygomatic arch and onto the maxilla in front of the arch, providing crushing force. The temporalis attaches from the dentary (specifically, the coronoid process) {{to the side of the}} braincase, providing torque about the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> jaw <b>articulation.</b>|$|R

A pesquisa foi feita a partir de um estudo etnográfico de recepção de novelas, e se desdobra na análise da relação entre televisão e publicidade, discutindo a feminilização do consumo e a construção de certa imagem feminina hegemônica nas novelas e nos anúncios comerciais.

This study evaluates the feasibility and anatomical risks of the procedure. Ten upper limbs from fresh cadavers were used for this anatomical and radiological study. A dorsolateral opening wedge osteotomy with a 10 correction was performed on each specimen. CT scans and AP radiographs of all the wrists were performed before and after osteotomy to assess the correction of the slope angle, defined as the angle between the longitudinal <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the second metacarpal and the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the trapeziometacarpal <b>articulation.</b> On standard radiographs, mean trapezial slope was 126 preoperatively and 117 postoperatively. On sagittal and coronal CT reconstructions, one case of trapezial translation and two impingements between trapezoid and trapezium bones were identified. Trapezial osteotomy is technically demanding with several possible complications, but merits further study for young patients with Eaton stage 1 or 2 osteoarthritis and an abnormal trapezial slope...|$|R

50|$|In {{linguistics}} (articulatory phonetics), articulation {{refers to}} how the tongue, lips, jaw, vocal cords, and other speech organs used to produce sounds are used to make sounds. Speech sounds are categorized by manner <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> and place <b>of</b> <b>articulation.</b> Place <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> refers to where the airstream in the mouth is constricted. Manner <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> refers to {{the manner in which}} the speech organs interact, such as how closely the air is restricted, what form of airstream is used (e.g. pulmonic, implosive, ejectives, and clicks), whether or not the vocal cords are vibrating, and whether the nasal cavity is opened to the airstream. The concept is primarily used for the production of consonants, but can be used for vowels in qualities such as voicing and nasalization. For any place <b>of</b> <b>articulation,</b> there may be several manners <b>of</b> <b>articulation,</b> and therefore several homorganic consonants.|$|R

The Hangulphabet places consonant graphemes on a grid with the x-axis representing the place <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> and the y-axis representing manner <b>of</b> <b>articulation.</b> Each individual grapheme contains radicals from both axes where the points intersect. The top radical represents manner <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> where the bottom represents place <b>of</b> <b>articulation.</b> A horizontal line running through the middle of the bottom radical represents voicing. For vowels, place <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> is located on a grid that represents the position of the tongue in the mouth.
