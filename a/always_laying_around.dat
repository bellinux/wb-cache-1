5000|$|One {{incident}} {{in particular was}} described in moderate detail by musician Dean London recording {{in the studio with}} Pretty. [...] " [...] After we recorded the guitar track and paused for a break, we just heard this giant knocking. It was really loud, even inside the mixing booth. For some reason, there was this giant replica medieval sword that Robert <b>always</b> had <b>laying</b> <b>around</b> in the corner. He grabbed the damn thing and stormed out {{the back door of the}} studio with the sword held over his head like some kind of enraged barbarian. I guess he thought it was some kids.... that he was going to run up and scare them so they would stop knocking and we could get back to recording. Needless to say, it wasn't the neighborhood youth, it was the police with a noise pollution violation. Let's just say Robert is lucky to still be alive." ...|$|R
