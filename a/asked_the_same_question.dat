When {{asked in a}} Gallup poll in July 1984 whether their sympathies lay mainly with the employers or the miners, 40% said employers; 33% were for the miners; 19% were for neither and 8% did not know. When <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>question</b> during 5–10 December 1984, 51% had most sympathy for the employers; 26% for the miners; 18% for neither and 5% did not know.

When <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>question</b> during 5–10 December 1984, 7% approved; 88% disapproved and 5% did not know.

500|$|The board report stated that, [...] "There is no {{indication}} that the AWACS Senior Director (Wang), the Mission Crew Commander (Tracy) and/or the DUKE (Martin) made any radio calls throughout the intercept, or that they issued any guidance to either the AWACS crew or the F-15 pilots." [...] Although the OPC ROE did task the AWACS with controlling and monitoring helicopter operations in the TAOR, the board found that the AWACS crew believed that they had no responsibility for controlling U.S. Army Black Hawks or ensuring that other coalition aircraft were aware of Black Hawks operating in the TAOR. When questioned by board investigators as to who was responsible for tracking the helicopters, Tracy said, [...] "I cannot tell you that. I honestly don't know." [...] When Wang was <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>question</b> by the investigators, he replied, [...] "No one is responsible."

500|$|Because {{the script}} {{of the episode}} does not specify the {{identity}} of an unseen person who slides a file about Gibson Praise under Doggett's door, Kim Manners later had to ask the writers who the mysterious visitor was; the director was told by Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz that the unseen person was actually Kersh. Robert Patrick <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>question</b> of Manners, around this time, but the director – not yet sure of the answer and hoping to avoid looking foolish – never gave the actor an answer. Patrick thought the reason that Manners was being purposefully secretive was that the director wanted Patrick to still be in wonderment as to the mysterious visitor's identity, as a device for the actor to aid his performance. Manners later teased Patrick that the reason he had not answered the question {{was that he had}} not liked Patrick at the time, prompting the actor to ask what he had done to annoy Manners on the first night of filming the episode. Eventually, the director finally admitted to Patrick what had actually happened. Kersh's actions are later revealed and explained in the ninth season premiere [...] "Nothing Important Happened Today".|$|E
500|$|Bruce visits Vicki at her apartment, {{prepared}} {{to tell her}} about his alter-ego. The Joker interrupts their meeting, asking Bruce, [...] "(Have you) Ever danced with the devil by the pale moonlight?" [...] before shooting him. Bruce uses a bended serving tray as body armor and plays dead. He remembers that the mugger who killed his parents <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>question,</b> and realizes that Napier was his parents' killer. Vicki is brought to the Batcave by Bruce's butler, Alfred Pennyworth, who has been coaxing their relationship because Vicki brings out Bruce's human side. After telling her that he cannot focus on their relationship with the Joker terrorizing Gotham, Bruce departs as Batman to destroy the Axis plant. Meanwhile, the Joker lures the citizens of Gotham to a parade with the promise of free money, but while throwing cash at the crowd as promised, also attacks them with Smilex gas released from his giant parade balloons. Batman arrives and tows the balloons above the clouds with the Batwing. The Joker shoots the Batwing using a long-barreled gun, causing it to crash, and takes Vicki {{to the top of a}} cathedral.|$|E
500|$|A 2003 {{survey of}} {{residents}} living around Scotland's 10 existing wind farms found {{high levels of}} community acceptance and strong support for wind power, with much support from those who lived closest to the wind farms. The results of this survey support those of an earlier Scottish Executive survey 'Public attitudes to the Environment in Scotland 2002', which found that the Scottish public would prefer {{the majority of their}} electric power to come from renewables, and which rated wind power as the cleanest source of renewable energy. A survey conducted in 2005 showed that 74% of people in Scotland agree that wind farms are necessary to meet current and future energy needs. When people were <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>question</b> in a Scottish renewables study conducted in 2010, 78% agreed. The increase is significant as there were twice as many wind farms in 2010 as there were in 2005. The 2010 survey also showed that 52% disagreed with the statement that wind farms are [...] "ugly and a blot on the landscape". 59% agreed that wind farms were necessary and that how they looked was unimportant. Regarding tourism, query responders consider power pylons, cell phone towers, quarries and plantations more negatively than wind farms. Scotland is planning to obtain 100% of electric power from renewable sources by 2020.|$|E
