5|$|Polling {{conducted}} between late December 2012 to mid-January 2013 by Civic Science {{found that}} a race between Luke Ravenstahl and Bill Peduto would be within single digit percentage points. The polling firm, however, emphasized that the poll {{was not intended to}} provide two-way race numbers and that the polling (which was completed on January 16) did not include Michael Lamb, who had entered the race the next day. According to the poll, blue-collar primary voters were more <b>apt</b> <b>to</b> support Ravenstahl while white-collar primary voters were more <b>apt</b> <b>to</b> support Peduto.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, Wisconsin {{achieved}} statehood; Indian {{nations were}} under increased pressure for removal and marginalization. Corrupt US Indian agents controlled annuity payments, sometimes underpaying tribes, and took authority not granted {{them by the}} bands. They allowed white settlers to move onto Ojibwa lands and refused the Ojibwe the rights reserved by treaties. The Ojibwa complained to the President about the mistreatment and broken promises, but politicians were more <b>apt</b> <b>to</b> listen to western land speculators, who saw possibilities for profit in removing the Ojibwa to Minnesota.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Steinitz stands {{high as a}} {{theoretician}} and as a writer; he has {{a powerful}} pen, and when he chooses can use expressive English.

Possessed of a fine intellect, and extremely fond of the game, he is <b>apt</b> <b>to</b> lose sight of all other considerations, people and business alike. Chess is his very life and soul, the one thing for which he lives.|$|E

5|$|Overall, anecdotal {{evidence}} suggests that temazepam {{may be the most}} psychologically habit-forming (addictive) benzodiazepine. Temazepam abuse reached epidemic proportions {{in some parts of the}} world, in particular, in Europe and Australia, and is a major drug of abuse in many Southeast Asian countries. This led authorities of various countries to place temazepam under a more restrictive legal status. Some countries, such as Sweden, banned the drug outright. Temazepam also has certain pharmacokinetic properties of absorption, distribution, elimination, and clearance that make it more <b>apt</b> <b>to</b> abuse compared to many other benzodiazepines.|$|E

It can detect the movement of nearby objects with its rudimentary eyes and, in order to escape predators, can move much more swiftly umbones first, by clapping its valves shut.

5|$|At {{the same}} time Japan's 10th Army was {{storming}} Yuhuatai, a rugged plateau situated {{directly in front of}} Zhonghua Gate on Nanking's southern side. The 10th Army's progress was slow and casualties were heavy as Yuhuatai was built like a fortress of interlocking pillboxes and trenches manned by three Chinese divisions, including the German-trained 88th Division, though the Chinese were also <b>apt</b> <b>to</b> counterattack and some Japanese units were forced to spend more time defending than attacking. Close to every single man that the 88th Division had deployed on Yuhuatai was killed in action, including three of its four regimental commanders and both of its brigade commanders, but in the process the Japanese were made to suffer 2,240 casualties including 566 dead. Yuhuatai was finally overrun at noon on December 12.|$|E

5|$|The court enmities {{provoked}} by his twenty years unbroken intimacy and influence with the king, and the denigration of less gifted or less fortunate soldiers, followed him in death. Prince William expressed {{the bitterness of}} his hatred in almost his last words, and Prince Henry's memoirs give a wholly incredible portrait of Winterfeldt's arrogance, dishonesty, immorality and incapacity. Frederick, however, was not <b>apt</b> <b>to</b> encourage incompetence in his most trusted officers, {{and as for the}} rest, Winterfeldt stood first among the very few to whom the king gave his friendship and his entire confidence. On hearing of Winterfeldt's death, he said, I will never ever find again another Winterfeldt,and a little later, He was a good man, a soulful man; he was my friend. Winterfeldt's strength was thinking and acting strategically.|$|E
5|$|The radio postgame show {{reported}} the Warriors defeating the Knicks 169–150. However, the official scorer's report recorded {{the game as}} 169–147, a discrepancy {{that has never been}} explained. Chamberlain made 36 of 63 field-goals and 28 of 32 free throws, the latter a far better rate than his roughly 50% career average. In two earlier games at Hershey that season, Chamberlain had made a combined 27of38 free throws, 71percent. The basket rims at the arena were aged, flimsy, and forgiving. Balls would bounce off of typical firm rims, whereas balls near the rim in Hershey were <b>apt</b> <b>to</b> get a good roll and fall in. Playing all 48minutes of the game, Chamberlain set NBA records for field goals attempted (63) and made (36), free throws made (28), most points in a quarter (31), and half (59). He averaged 73points in four games that week, exceeding 60 in all of them.|$|E
