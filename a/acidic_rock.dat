25|$|Asplenium×trudellii, {{commonly}} known as Trudell's spleenwort, is a rare hybrid fern of the eastern United States, first described in 1925. It is formed by the crossing of mountain spleenwort (A.montanum) with lobed spleenwort (A.pinnatifidum). Trudell's spleenwort is intermediate in form between its two parents, and is generally found near them, growing on exposed outcrops of <b>acidic</b> <b>rock.</b> While A.×trudellii is triploid and sterile, {{there is some evidence}} that it can occasionally reproduce apogamously.|$|E

40|$|The flora {{of dense}} humid forests on ultramafic rocks is {{compared}} with that over acidic and over calcareous rocks. The flora of forests on ultramafic rocks (1361 species belonging to 400 genera in 118 families) is as rich in species but a little less diversified in genera and families, than the flora over <b>acidic</b> <b>rocks</b> (1370 species distributed among 430 genera and 128 families). It is in contrast significantly more diversified than forest floras over calcareous rocks that cover a smaller area. Species associated with a specific forest type are more numerous on ultramafites than on <b>acidic</b> <b>rocks</b> and the genera are equal in number in both cases. Gymnosperms with 31 species of which 19 are strictly associated with ultramafic rocks, have their greatest importance {{with this type of}} substrate. The reverse is true for the Pteridophytes. The total number of Angiosperms is approximately the same for both ultramafic and <b>acidic</b> <b>rocks,</b> but is very variable according to families. Thus, 33 Angiosperms have a greater importance in the former rock type, 36 in the latter, and 33 are equally important in both. With exception of the Gymnosperms that are more numerous over ultramafic rocks, taxa representative of the antiquity of the New Caledonian flora have a similar importance in the two main types of forest. Nevertheless, the families #Phellinaceae$, #Balanopaceae$, #Sphenostemonaceae$, #Oncothecaceae$, and #Strasburgeriaceae$ are better represented in forest over ultramafic rocks. The #Monimiaceae$, #Amborellaceae$, and #Trimeniaceae$ are more important in forest over <b>acidic</b> <b>rocks.</b> The flora of forests over ultramafites is equally well distinguished from that over <b>acidic</b> <b>rocks</b> by a greater number of species in the #Euphorbiaceae$, #Myrtaceae$, #Santalaceae$, #Epacridaceae$, #Fagaceae$, and #Casuarinaceae$.

50|$|Guppy, {{as well as}} her {{scientific}} partner, Leonard Hawkes, {{composed a}} case study on the composite dykes of eastern Iceland in the year of 1924. Although Hawkes conducted the field work himself, Guppy {{played a crucial role in}} assisting and cooperating with deciphering the commonly occurring composite dykes in the tertiary plateau-basalt series of the respective area studied. The overruling findings are as follows: the exposed dyke is seen to be composed of basic and <b>acidic</b> <b>rocks,</b> as well as seven members- the dolerites alternating in the quartz-porphyries. The studied dyke is exposed in cliff-section, which is 2400 feet in vertical height at Hokulvikurgil, Breithdal. Guppy and Hawkes were also able to correctively decipher the sequence of intrusions in the composite dyke. As well, analysis of the origin of quartz and felspar-xenocrysts in the dolerites were made, and in addition, the origins of the basic inclusions in the <b>acidic</b> <b>rocks.</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Acidic</b> <b>rock</b> is {{rock that}} is either siliceous, having {{a high content}} of silica (SiO2), or rock with a low pH.

5000|$|Acarospora obnubila ("cloudy {{cobblestone}} lichen") is a dull brown squamulose areolate crustose lichen {{that may}} {{grow up to}} 4 mm in diameter or with squamules scattered among other lichens.

Squamules measure up to 2 mm in diameter and are round to irregular, with have a stipe. They may also grow on members of the Aspicilia genus (lichenicolous). Competition for space with other lichens stimulates longer stipes to develop, whereby the squamules may overlay other lichens.|$|E
5000|$|Acarospora thamnina is a shiny, black tinged, {{variously}} brown squamulose crustose lichen. It has {{a linear}} growth pattern, growing along cracks in boulders.

It commonly grows either among, or on other lichens. It grows a longer stipe so its squamules can grow over other lichens when there is competition for space. When it forms thick clumps it is easily identified with its elevated squamules and thick stipes. It grows on <b>acidic</b> <b>rock</b> in full sunlight.|$|E
