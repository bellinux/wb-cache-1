5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>interesting</b> {{example that}} does not involve any luring is the zone-tailed hawk, which resembles the turkey vulture. It flies amongst the vultures, {{suddenly}} breaking from the formation and ambushing its prey. Here the hawk's presence is of no evident significance to the vultures, affecting them neither negatively or positively.|$|E

5|$|A typical P. exclamans worker {{will live}} somewhere between 14–16 days. The oldest wasp to be {{observed}} in a natural colony was 102 days old. Queens typically live 6 times longer than the workers. There has been some variation observed with the life expectancy of P. exclamans. This has typically been attributed to the colony of origin. It also {{must be noted that}} while there is variation between colonies, there typically is less variation between the original nest and the satellite nest. Variation inside a single colony may also occur {{because of the presence of}} different castes. Foragers, those who frequently travel outside the nest, lead a riskier life and tend to have lower life expectancy than those who stay in the nest. Though, it was observed that colonies with high foraging rates also had higher reproductive rates to compensate for the lower life expectancy. <b>Another</b> <b>interesting</b> aspect that was observed in one nest was that an increase in female population led to lower longevity. This was because the females were more focused on competing to become the next queen than foraging and fulfilling their roles.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>interesting</b> {{habit of}} males {{of this and}} other fairywren species during the {{reproductive}} season is to pluck petals (in this species, predominantly pink and purple ones which contrast with their plumage) and show them to female fairywrens. Petals often form part of a courtship display and are presented to a female in the male fairywren's own or another territory. Outside the breeding season males may sometimes still show petals to females in other territories, presumably to promote themselves. It is notable that fairywrens are socially monogamous and sexually promiscuous: pairs will bond for life, but regularly mate with other individuals; a proportion of young will have been fathered by males from outside the group. Young are often raised not by the pair alone, but with other males who also mated with the pair's female assisting. Thus, petal-carrying might be a behaviour that strengthens the pair-bond. Petal carrying might also be a way for extra males to gain matings with the female. In either case, the data does not strongly link petal-carrying and presenting to a copulation soon thereafter.|$|E

25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>interesting</b> {{aspect of}} the song is {{the timing of the}} lead-up to the famous guitar solo.

25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>interesting</b> use {{is in the}} {{treatment}} of 'dry rot' or 'white rot' on timber joists, partially rotten or affected wood readily soaks it up and the fungus is subsequently killed. The main advantage of this type of treatment is that the glycol is hygroscopic and the wood being already water damaged readily absorbs a water based product.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>interesting</b> {{question}} posed about congenital amusia {{is if it}} has a genetic origin. A study was conducted to test for the presence of a genetic origin by studying family aggregation of congenital amusia. Family members of amusics were studied, as well as family members of a control group. The study yielded interesting results. Amusia cannot be attributed solely to family environment due to the presence of at least one unaffected sibling in each tested family in the amusic group. Also, music was found to be present to a lesser extent, but not absent, in the environment of the amusic subjects than in that of the musically intact control group. This supports the claim that the occurrence of congenital amusia cannot be explained by a lack of environmental stimulation. <b>Another</b> <b>interesting</b> finding was that the next generation, or the offspring of those with congenital amusia, was more musical. A reason for this might be that musical stimulation for the offspring probably started early in life when their brains were more plastic.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>interesting</b> {{property}} {{is that even}} if u has a discontinuity at an initial time t=t0, the temperature becomes smooth as soon as t>t0. For example, if a bar of metal has temperature 0 and another has temperature 100 and they are stuck together end to end, then very quickly the temperature {{at the point of}} connection will become 50 and the graph of the temperature will run smoothly from 0 to 50.|$|E
