5|$|Burger King {{was founded}} in 1953 in Jacksonville, Florida, as Insta-Burger King by Keith J. Kramer and his wife's uncle, Matthew Burns. Their first stores were centred around <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> known as the Insta-Broiler, which was very {{effective}} at cooking burgers. It proved so successful that, as they grew through franchising, they required all of their franchises to carry the device.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to combat, {{there is also}} a mild role-playing component. An experience point system levels up the player character and their equipment (weapons, armor, shields, helms, and magic rings). Equipment pieces have special properties and a predetermined amount of experience points required to master them. Mastering <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> increases its sale value but decreases the player's experience gain by 20%. Upon leveling up or mastering <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment,</b> players gain attribute points that can be allotted towards four character attributes: health, attack, shield power, or magic. Each point can only be allocated once and is a permanent upgrade to the character. Players can purchase new equipment using in-game money from sacks and treasure chests found throughout the castle, defeated enemies, and sales of unused equipment. In-game money can be purchased with real money within the game.|$|E
5|$|The US Army {{had been}} {{managing}} <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> {{referred to as}} S-202, which combined four IR cameras, a display, and operator chains, an artificial illumination component (described as “covert – UV,” using Ultraviolet light to provide illumination), and a freeze display function. Under Project Night Life, the S-202 {{it was to be}} tested on a S-61 helicopter by early 1967. The project itself was being funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA).|$|E

5|$|Less {{than a year}} later, one of Crosby's game-worn sweaters {{disappeared}}. The jersey he wore in {{his first}} NHL game, played against the New Jersey Devils, disappeared from his father's luggage during a flight from Pittsburgh to Buffalo. The jersey was later found at the Pittsburgh International Airport between <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> and a stairwell. Crosby's jersey from his third NHL game was the highest-selling NHL jersey in an auction for Hurricane Katrina relief – it sold for $21,010. During an online auction held by the NHL and the NHL Players Association to benefit Hockey Fights Cancer, Crosby's game-worn jersey from the first period of the 2007 All-Star Game earned the most money. Crosby's sold for $47,520, more than eight times the next highest price—$5,681 for the jersey worn by Brendan Shanahan of the New York Rangers.|$|E
5|$|In March 2011, {{one of the}} sub {{contractors}} of Bouygues fell under criticism for the dumping of tunnel fill on sensitive wetlands on Virginia Key. They {{were supposed to be}} dumping the fill on Virginia Key on the degraded northwest side, but were found dumping it 80 to 100 yards (73.1 to 94.5 m) from the designated spot, where they damaged wetlands and killed about 40 mangrove trees with <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> that got stuck. The intention was that they would be allowed to put 55,000 cubic yards (42,050.5 m3) of fill there provided that they use it to build a berm to block the view of Virginia Key's sewage water treatment plant. The fill that was dumped on Virginia Key was mainly rock and soil from road construction and site preparation on Watson Island and not from tunnel boring, which environmentalists object being put on Virginia Key as it may not be as clean. The north point of Virginia Key {{is one of the last}} remaining undeveloped areas near the Miami downtown area and has been recently restored as it was previously used as a dumping site for the infill from the Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami Marine Stadium, and Norris Cut.|$|E
5|$|The company {{known today}} as Burger King itself began as a franchise; the {{predecessor}} of the modern company was founded in 1953 in Jacksonville, Florida, as Insta-Burger King. The original founders and owners, Kieth J. Kramer and Matthew Burns, opened their first stores around <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> known as the Insta-Broiler. The Insta-Broiler oven proved so successful at cooking burgers, Kramer and Burns required all of their franchises to carry the device. The rights to open stores in Miami, Florida, belonged to two businessmen named James McLamore and David R. Edgerton and their company: South Florida Restaurants, Inc. Due to operational issues with the Insta-Broiler, in 1954 McLamore and Edgarton {{made the decision to}} replace the Insta-Broiler with a mechanized gas grill they called a flame broiler. Even though the company had rapidly expanded throughout the state until its operations totaled more than 40 locations in 1955, the original Insta-Burger King ran into financial difficulties and the pair of McLamore and Edgarton purchased the national rights to the chain and rechristened the company as Burger King of Miami.|$|E

25|$|Most {{parachuting}} {{equipment is}} ruggedly designed and is enjoyed by several owners before being retired. Purchasers are always advised {{to have any}} potential purchases examined by a qualified parachute rigger. A rigger is trained to spot signs of damage or misuse. Riggers also keep track of industry product and safety bulletins, and can, therefore, determine if <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> is up-to-date and serviceable.|$|E
25|$|An {{ice hockey}} stick is <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> used in ice hockey to shoot, pass, and carry the puck across the ice. Ice hockey sticks are {{approximately}} 150–200cm long, {{composed of a}} long, slender shaft with a flat extension at one end called the blade. The blade {{is the part of}} the stick used to contact the puck, and is typically 25 to 40cm long. Stick dimensions can vary widely, as they are usually built to suit a particular player's size and preference. The blade is positioned at roughly a 135° angle from the axis of the shaft, giving the stick a partly 'L-shaped' appearance. The shaft of the stick is fairly rigid, but it has some flexibility to benefit some shots.|$|E
500|$|Since completion, PA378 has {{undergone}} little major change, but the highway {{has undergone}} several rehabilitations.

The bridge repainting was completed on May 15, 2009, after the closing of a bridge and was re-opened later due to rainfall in the area.|$|E

500|$|Spivey {{made his}} final public {{appearance}} in 1991, at a reunion of the 1951 Kentucky Wildcats team in Lexington. Writer Greg Doyel says that [...] "he was a recluse" [...] at the time. According to his wife, Audrey Spivey, [...] "He never got over [...] Bill {{could not let}} that go. He was just devastated." [...] Then living in Daytona Beach, Florida, he was later hurt in an automobile accident, which aggravated a lower-back injury. Spivey's son, Cashton, said that [...] "He never made a full recovery from that. It affected his posture, and he had chronic pain from that." [...] In a post-accident bone grafting operation, <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> became lodged in Spivey's lower back; according to Cashton, he won a small amount from the hospital in a lawsuit.|$|E

2500|$|A boom, in {{the context}} of windsurfing, is <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> that {{attaches}} to the mast, providing structural support for the sail. It completely encircles the sail, and is designed to be gripped, allowing the sailor to control the sail for normal sailing, and also for almost any type of maneuver (such as gybing, tacking, and waterstarting). Early booms (often called a [...] "wishbone boom" [...] due to their symmetrical shape) were tied on to the mast using rope, but newer booms use a clamp mechanism for attachment.|$|E

2500|$|GPGPU is {{fundamentally}} a software concept, not a hardware concept; it {{is a type}} of algorithm, not <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment.</b> However, specialized equipment designs may even further enhance the efficiency of GPGPU pipelines, which traditionally perform relatively few algorithms on very large amounts of data. Massively parallelized, gigantic-data-level tasks thus may be parallelized even further via specialized setups such as rack computing (many similar, highly tailored machines built into a rack), which adds a third layer many computing units each using many CPUs to correspond to many GPUs. Some Bitcoin [...] "miners" [...] used such setups for high-quantity processing.|$|E
2500|$|A {{pivoting}} arm {{equipped with}} a stop sign is <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> required by law on North American school buses. The sign normally stows flat {{on the left side}} of the bus, and is deployed by the driver while picking up or dropping off passengers. Some buses have two such stop arms, one near the front facing forwards, and one near the rear facing backwards. The stop sign is retroreflective and equipped either with red blinking lights above and below the [...] legend, or with a [...] legend that is illuminated by LEDs. Unlike a normal stop sign, this sign requires other vehicles travelling in both directions to remain stopped until the sign is retracted.|$|E
