5|$|Although the Persians stood {{their ground}} for <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> <b>they</b> {{eventually}} broke and {{fled to the}} palisade. The soldiers of the right wing followed them into the camp, at which point many of the Persian army fled from the camp, except the ethnic Persian troops, who grouped together and fought the Allied soldiers who entered the camp. Finally, the left wing arrived, outflanking the camp and falling on {{the rear of the}} remaining Persian forces, thereby completing the rout.|$|E
5|$|If {{you read}} {{the records of the}} Royal Society and what they were doing in the 1660s, it's clear that at a certain point, some of these people– and I think Hooke was one of them– became a little bit disgusted with {{themselves}} and began excusing themselves when one of these vivisections was going to happen. I certainly don't think they turned into hardcore animal rights campaigners, or anything close to that, but I think after <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> <b>they</b> got a little bit sick of it and started to feel conflicted about what they were doing. So I've tried to show that ambivalence and complication in the book.|$|E

25|$|It's {{a complex}} {{question}} to answer, really. As musicians {{you try to}} find a name for your band that represents you and you never really do, because, basically, names for bands lose their meaning after <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> <b>They</b> become a series of sounds that you associate with people in music. The most important thing for a name is that you can imagine forty-thousand people screaming it in unison.|$|E

25|$|Stateless met in Leeds in 2002. Chris James, James Sturdy and Jon Taylor {{had played}} in rock bands {{together}} for several years. When realising this more traditional style did not offer them the musical challenge they were looking for, they began to expand their musical tastes and influences to more sample based electronica and hip hop. For <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>they</b> ruled out the use of guitars when writing, trying to take their sound into a new direction. The interest in hip hop brought in DJ kidkanevil who they heard at a hip hop club night in Leeds. James met Rod Buchanan-Dunlop, a Scot, at Leeds Metropolitan University {{on the first day}} of their Creative Music and Sound Technology course in the Leeds Met School of Technology. Buchanan-Dunlop then came into the band as the programmer and Stateless became a five piece.|$|E
25|$|Tom {{suffers a}} serious wound on his cheek, and the camp guards realize {{it will not}} be {{difficult}} to identify him.

25|$|Stagecoach {{was born}} out of {{deregulation}} of the British express coach market in the early 1980s, though its roots {{can be traced back to}} 1976 when Ann Gloag and her husband Robin set up a small motor caravan and minibus hire business called Gloagtrotter. Ann's accountant brother Brian Souter joined the firm and expanded the business into bus hire. Robin Gloag subsequently sold his shareholding in the business and ceased any involvement in 1982 with the collapse of his marriage to Ann. The Transport Act 1980, which freed express services of 35 miles and over from regulation by the Traffic Commissioner, brought new opportunities for the Perth based company and services were launched from Dundee to London using second-hand Neoplan coaches. For <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> <b>they</b> offered a very personal service with Brian Souter doing the driving and Ann Gloag making up sandwiches and snacks for the passengers.|$|E

25|$|Ze'evi's assassins {{were able}} to flee {{the scene of the}} crime. For <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>they</b> were hiding in the Mukataa {{compound}} in Ramallah, under the auspices of Yasser Arafat. Eventually, during Operation Defensive Shield in which Israeli forces sieged the Mukataa compound, an agreement was reached whereby Ze'evi's assassins were transferred to the Jericho prison under the supervision of British and American guards. After the Islamist militant organization Hamas won the Palestinian legislative elections in January 2006, the Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh publicly announced his intention to free Ze'evi's assassin squad members. On 14 March 2006, the American and British guards left the Jericho jail, charging that the Palestinian Authority was not sticking to the agreement reached with Israel four years earlier. As a result, Israel launched Operation Bringing Home the Goods on the same day in which the IDF captured Ze'evi's assassins. Consequently, Ze'evi's assassins were tried in Israel, convicted and received long prison terms.|$|E
25|$|Bozděch elected {{instead to}} carry the dog instead rather than killing {{him as one of}} the others suggested, and after <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>they</b> began to take turns {{carrying}} Ant over their shoulders. They reached Blois and were directed to a train to Montpellier further down the track where found it overwhelmed with people trying to board. Ant shot off towards the rear of the train, before stopping by a cattle truck. Bozděch tried to open it up, but it was locked. He banged on it in the hope someone was already inside and was surprised when it was opened, revealing that the only people inside were a woman and her two daughters. The reason why Ant had been attracted to that particular carriage, was because one of the girls had been eating chocolate at the time. When she later offered him a piece, he didn't wait for it to be melted like when he was a puppy, but instead ate it excitedly.|$|E
25|$|Many {{have speculated}} {{about what might}} have {{happened}} had Pauling been able to travel to Britain as planned in May 1952. As it was, his political activities caused his travel to be restricted by the United States government and he did not visit the UK until later, at which point he met none of the DNA researchers in England. At any rate he was preoccupied with proteins at the time, not DNA. Watson and Crick were not officially working on DNA. Crick was writing his Ph.D. thesis; Watson also had other work such as trying to obtain crystals of myoglobin for X-ray diffraction experiments. In 1952, Watson performed X-ray diffraction on tobacco mosaic virus and found results indicating that it had helical structure. Having failed once, Watson and Crick were now somewhat reluctant to try again and for <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>they</b> were forbidden to make further efforts to find a molecular model of DNA.|$|E
