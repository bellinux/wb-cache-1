500|$|Two {{transmissions}} {{were available}} for the BA—a four-speed automatic and a five-speed manual, both floor-mounted. The automatic unit featured Sequential Sports Shift, a first for the Falcon nameplate in Australia. Utility body styles were also available with an optional column-mounted <b>automatic</b> <b>shifter</b> (without Sequential Sports Shift) {{in lieu of the}} floor-mounted system also offered. The new Control-Blade independent rear suspension (IRS) fitted to all sedans—first used in development of the Ford Focus and the Jaguar X-Type— was superior to the optional double wishbone IRS suspension used on AU sedans, and was cheaper. However, it was heavier than the previous live rear axle used for base models, and the change contributed to the base model XT sedan's [...] weight increase from the previous model. The wagons and utilities retained the leaf spring live axle rear suspension of the AU wagon and utility; consequently, they did not gain as much weight as the sedan.|$|E
2500|$|All V8 powered Matadors {{came with}} a TorqueFlite 998 {{automatic}} transmission and a column-mounted <b>automatic</b> <b>shifter.</b> The [...] I6 was the base engine with a column-mounted three-speed manual transmission, with a [...] I6 optional, with which only the station wagon could be ordered with a manual transmission because almost all six-cylinder powered Matadors came with TorqueFlite 904 automatics.|$|E
5000|$|Leather-appointed heated captains {{chairs with}} console <b>automatic</b> <b>shifter</b> ...|$|E
50|$|An all-new, three-speed, fully {{automatic}} transmission was made available. Unlike the manual, the <b>automatic's</b> <b>shifter</b> was column-mounted.|$|R
50|$|The Force 1 {{will come}} {{standard}} with a 6-speed manual transmission, but an optional 6-speed <b>automatic</b> with paddle <b>shifters</b> {{will also be}} available on request.|$|R
25|$|All models (including 2015 Nismo) include 7-speed <b>automatic</b> with paddle <b>shifters</b> or 6-speed manual {{transmission}}. SynchroRev Match {{system for}} 6-speed manual transmission is {{included with the}} Sport Package.|$|R
50|$|All V8 powered Matadors {{came with}} a TorqueFlite 998 {{automatic}} transmission and a column-mounted <b>automatic</b> <b>shifter.</b> The 232 CID L I6 was the base engine with a column-mounted three-speed manual transmission, with a 258 CID L I6 optional, with which only the station wagon could be ordered with a manual transmission because almost all six-cylinder powered Matadors came with TorqueFlite 904 automatics.|$|E
5000|$|In December 20, 2004, the USDM Legacy B4 {{was awarded}} the 2005 Automobile All-Stars for All-Star Family Car from Automobile Magazine Jean Jennings, {{editor-in-chief}} of Automobile said [...] "The Legacy B4 beat out the competition {{because it can be}} all things to all people: a refined, high-quality, comfortable freeway cruiser and a sporty back-roads car, with fine steering and brakes and a sweet 5-speed <b>automatic</b> <b>shifter</b> in Turbo Model".|$|E
50|$|During the pursuit, Billy {{is killed}} when Jeff forces his car off the road. Shortly after, the trailer from Red's truck detaches, causing Al to violently crash into it. Undeterred, Red {{attempts}} to force Jeff and Amy's vehicle off a bridge, trapping Amy's leg underneath the dashboard. Jeff rushes {{out of the}} vehicle and into Red's big rig, where a struggle over the steering wheel forces Red's truck over the edge, leaving it dangling on a steel bridge support. Jeff fights Red on the suspended big rig, eventually hurling him to the rocks below. Jeff frees Amy from the dashboard. Seeing that Red survived the fall, Amy pulls the <b>automatic</b> <b>shifter</b> on their pickup, causing the semi to fall on Red and crush him. Sitting {{on the edge of the}} bridge beside their mangled pickup, Jeff and Amy embrace each other.|$|E
50|$|On the inside, changes {{included}} a floor-mounted <b>automatic</b> transmission <b>shifter,</b> {{in place of}} the column shifter, as well as a redesigned center stack containing audio and climate controls. Climate control is automatic on all models except the XLS. The Limited model also featured full color-coded bumpers, wheel arches and side moldings, as well as side mirrors with integrated LED indicators. Rear drum brakes have been replaced by disc brakes all round.|$|R
5000|$|Both the Escape and Tribute were {{refreshed}} in 2004 for the 2005 model year. The {{base engine}} became the Mazda 2.3 L MZR 4 with 153 PS (114 kW)/206 N·m (152 lb·ft), {{and the top}} remained the 3.0 L Duratec V6, now with torque down to 261 N·m (193 lb·ft). In North American-built models, a floor-mounted <b>automatic</b> transmission <b>shifter</b> replaced the column shifter. However, Japanese-built models continued with a column shifter. Mazda decided to halt production after the 2006 model year ...|$|R
50|$|In the Philippines, the 5th {{generation}} City {{was launched}} in 2009 available in 2 trims: 1.3 S and 1.5 E. The 1.3 liter is available in 5 speed manual or 5 speed automatic while the E variant is only available in 5 speed <b>automatic</b> with paddle <b>shifters.</b>|$|R
50|$|The custom 1950 Mercury {{driven by}} Cobretti was {{actually}} owned by Sylvester Stallone. The studio produced stunt doubles {{of the car}} for use {{in some of the}} action sequences, such as the jump from {{the second floor of the}} parking garage. The coupe was with a 350 cubic-inch Chevrolet engine, outfitted with a blower for added horsepower, a Hurst <b>automatic</b> <b>shifter</b> and a 400 hydro transmission with a shift kit. The car could go from zero to sixty miles per hour in four seconds and hit speeds of 140 miles per hour. A hood scoop was added to the front end, headlights and tail lights were rounded, and most of the decorative chrome was removed. The production built three Cobra cars for stunt work. Although they were identical on the outside, their moving parts were designed for specific sequences, involving high-speed swipes with other vehicles, 180-degree turns, jumps, and 360-degree spins.|$|E
5000|$|The Escape and Tribute were updated in February 2004 for the 2005 {{model year}} with a new base engine (the 2.3 L cc, 140 cu in Duratec 23), which {{replaced}} the Zetec 2.0 L (1983 cc, 121 cu in) [...] 4-cylinder. The most powerful engine remained the [...] Duratec 3.0 L (2976 cc, 181 cu in) V6, with new engine mounts. Ford also added advanced airbag and seatbelt safety systems, an intelligent AWD system, and exterior changes, which included a redesigned front bumper. The 2005 model year was the first with an automatic transmission available on the base four-cylinder models. The <b>automatic</b> <b>shifter</b> was moved from the column to the console on all models equipped with automatic transmissions. Ford also deleted the recline feature on the rear seats to improve the safety of occupants in the rear seats {{in the case of}} a rear crash.|$|E
50|$|Two {{transmissions}} {{were available}} for the BA—a four-speed automatic and a five-speed manual, both floor-mounted. The automatic unit featured Sequential Sports Shift, a first for the Falcon nameplate in Australia.

The wagons and utilities retained the leaf spring live axle rear suspension of the AU wagon and utility; consequently, they did not gain as much weight as the sedan.|$|E
5000|$|A {{deliberate}} {{effort was}} made to give the car a more [...] "European" [...] flavor than the Mustang, at least to American buyers' eyes, drawing inspiration from the popular Jaguar E-Type. Aside from the base model and the luxurious XR-7, only one performance package was available for either model: the sporty GT. The XR-7 model brought a simulated wood-grained dashboard with a full set of black-faced competition instruments and toggle switches, an overhead console, a T-type center <b>automatic</b> transmission <b>shifter</b> (if equipped with the optional Merc-O-Matic transmission), and leather-vinyl upholstery.|$|R
50|$|On the inside, changes {{included}} a new floor mounted <b>automatic</b> transmission <b>shifter,</b> {{in place of}} the old column shifter (Asia-Pacific model only; US-built Tribute gained the floor shifter in 2005). The dash was updated with a brand-new radio and automatic climate control with digital read-out, on certain models. Mechanically, the rear drum brakes were replaced by disc brakes. Engines remain the same, but the V6 has been modified to reduce fuel consumption by over 10%, while the 4-cylinder has improved mid-range torque and an electronic throttle. Both engines had been certified to meet Euro III emission regulations.|$|R
50|$|The Premium {{variant of}} the Suprima comes with {{exclusive}} interior kit not offered in the Executive trim, in particular the Anthracite-shade leather seats, front parking sensors and a built-in reverse camera. It also receives several features previously offered in the Prevé's Premium trim, namely the steering-mounted paddle <b>shifters,</b> <b>automatic</b> headlights and wipers, climate control, cruise control and push-start engine ignition.|$|R
50|$|In New Zealand, Todd Motors {{was even}} more adventurous with the VJ. The base Ranger XL and Charger were updated, as in Australia, with similar NZ-only {{variations}} as the VH but the VJ Regal 770 {{was something of a}} 'parts bin special' and essentially a merger of a VJ Regal with a CH Chrysler. The nose - also used for several hundred VH Chargers built for the Japanese market - combined the CH's four headlamps and grille with VH Valiant sheetmetal (retaining the older, larger, clear park/indicator lamps) {{while the rest of the}} body was as per Australian VJ. Inside, new front seats were CH style, with individual chairs forming a bench shape, and a column <b>automatic</b> <b>shifter</b> was now used. Earlier cars had all-vinyl upholstery but cloth was fitted as standard later. New Zealand VJ Regals also had a vinyl roof in black or beige and the panel between the tail lights was also trimmed in vinyl to match - the vinyl trim could be deleted to order.|$|E
50|$|New Zealand {{distributor}} Todd Motors {{had assembled}} the Valiant sedan from CKD kits since the AP5, mostly following the Australian range though with fewer variants and engine choices plus local upholstery. For the VH, {{it was a}} little more adventurous, launching a unique-to-NZ Ranger XL sedan as the base model with a two-barrel carburetor version of the 245ci Hemi-6 engine, no tail lamp trim surrounds or door window brightwork, unique seats and upholstery, and manual or automatic, column-shift transmission. The Regal 770 had the 265ci Hemi-6, floor-console <b>automatic</b> <b>shifter,</b> round dials with wood trim in place of the strip speedo and its own unique front bucket seats and trim. The 318ci V8 was optional and a vinyl roof was standard but could be deleted to order. Todd's sole locally-built Charger model was also to '770' trim with the 265ci Hemi-6 six and three-speed floor shift auto and did not have the bumper overriders standard in Australia. Early runs had one-piece front door glass and hinged opening rear side windows but, due to problems with water leaks and excessive wind noise, this was soon changed to opening front quarterlights and fixed rear side glass. Wagons were imported from Australia, to Australian specification.|$|E
5000|$|The car had 2 {{transmission}} choices, a 6 speed {{manual transmission}} and a 6 speed <b>automatic</b> with paddle <b>shifters.</b> Features exclusive to the RX-8 Spirit R were bi-xenon piano-black headlights, 4 piston {{front and rear}} red brake calipers, high performance Bridgestone Potenza summer tires, a 7.1 channel 300 watt Bose premium audio system with AudioPilot noise cancellation technology, and piano-black transmission tunnel trim.|$|R
5000|$|The Dart name (rather than Aspen) {{was applied}} to Dodge-branded F-body cars in Mexico and Colombia, {{corresponding}} to the local Chrysler-branded F-body cars badged as Valiant Volaré. The Mexican F-body Volarés were not marketed as Plymouth, because that brand was dropped after 1969. Chrysler de México also sold cheaper versions of the American K-cars -Plymouth Reliant and Dodge Aries- (in 1982-1987) and Plymouth Caravelle (1988) as Chrysler Volarés. As a matter of fact, the 1988 Chrysler Volaré E (an inexpensive version of the 1988 Plymouth Caravelle with a 1986-1988 Plymouth Reliant front end attached to it) served as Mexican Highway Patrol ("Policía Federal de Caminos" [...] in Spanish) units from 1988 to 1990. They got a Chrysler Turbo II 2.2L engine and 3-speed <b>automatic</b> transmission (<b>shifter</b> on the dash, like US patrols) and were known in Mexico as [...] "Turbo-patrols".|$|R
25|$|Even {{though the}} {{final drive ratio}} for {{vehicles}} equipped with the 7-speed automatic has been (numerically) reduced from 3.69 to 3.36, the new 7-speed automatic has much lower first through fourth gear overall ratios than the old 5-speed automatic and the 6-speed manual in the 6MT cars (which retain the old 3.69 final drive ratio). Giving it closer gear ratios in all gears, to match engine rpm better with power demand, brings better acceleration while overdrive ratios in 6th and 7th gears reduces highway cruising rpm and improves fuel mileage. The new 7-speed automatic retains the Drive Sport (DS) shift mode and Downshift Rev Matching (DRM) feature of the previous 5-speed <b>automatic.</b> Paddle <b>shifters</b> are standard on G37S models equipped with the 7-speed automatic. The new engine/transmission combo did add some weight the car (3,590lb. for the G37 vs. 3,508 for the G35 in identical trim).|$|R
50|$|The second-generation Jazz was {{launched}} around October 2008, with two trim levels; available in 1.3 S and 1.5 V models. The 1.3.S {{is available in}} 5 speed manual or 5 speed automatic while the 1.5.V is only available in 5 speed <b>automatic</b> with paddle <b>shifters</b> and receives a different style alloy wheels fog lights is not installed between the two trims it is a choice for the owners to add fog lights to the Jazz in 2011 a facelift version has launched receiving new designed front bumpers for both 1.3. And 1.5. Variants and new designed alloy wheels for both variants fog lights is now available in the 1.5. Variant and new colors has been added Brilliant Orange (1.5.V only) and Fresh Lime for both variants.|$|R
5000|$|The {{base model}} {{continued}} to be sold with a 2.3-liter 4-cylinder engine F23A in RA6(2WD) & RA7(4WD) models. The 3.0-liter J30A VTEC V6 engine from the first generation, producing now 210 hp (154.5kW) was available with RA8 (2WD) and RA9 (4WD) Prestige luxury and Absolute sport models. The 2000 Odyssey was the first Honda to receive a five-speed automatic transmission (with the 3.0-liter engine). All the second generation gearboxes also featured another first—a tiptronic-like manual mode, known as [...] "Honda S-matic", in which a gearbox remains to be a classic Honda's hydro-automat, but the driver is able to manage the shifting moment (if electronically allowed) with the selector's [...] "+" [...] and [...] "-" [...] positions. The interior was completely new. The old <b>automatic</b> column <b>shifter</b> {{was moved to the}} centre console. A new touchscreen-based digital climate control system replaced the old manual controls, which worked in conjunction with Honda's new navigation system. Woodgrain trim was standard on all models, while in VG/VZ V6 models leather and velour seat and door materials were standard over the basic cloth trims. The interior configuration was also changed (second and third row), and the spare wheel was moved to a new position beneath the third row. With L and Absolute versions, an additional third-row heater was added. The sunroof was no longer available respectively.|$|R
50|$|The 370Z (Z34) {{is powered}} by Nissan's 3.7 liter V6 engine, the VQ37VHR. The power output ranges from , with peak torque of , {{depending}} on market and variant. The 370Z has an official 0-60 mph time of 5.1 seconds. However, the car has also been tested by Motor Trend Magazine, which reported a 4.7 second 0-60 mph with 1 ft of roll out. Quarter mile times range from 13.1 and 13.6 seconds, thus making the 370Z the fastest production Z. The 370Z is available with either a six-speed manual gearbox or a seven-speed <b>automatic</b> with paddle <b>shifters.</b> The six-speed manual is the first production car manual gearbox to feature a system that Nissan refers to as SynchroRev Match, which automatically blips the throttle to match engine and transmission speed during downshifts, thus achieving the same effect as the heel-and-toe downshift technique.|$|R
2500|$|In 1968 and 1969 Buick {{offered the}} GS 400 in a {{convertible}} and hardtop model. [...] Standard {{issue of the}} GS 400 was a 400 cubic inch (6.6L) engine (with likely lower stated horsepower rating to keep insurance premiums lower) of 340 horsepower (350hp stage 1 [...] ) and 440ft. lbs. torque, a four barrel Rochester Quadrajet carburetor, dual exhaust, 2.93 standard gear ratio optional ( [...] limited slip differential, (3.64 stage 1 option, 3.42 with A/C [...] ), and the available three speed turbo Super Turbine 400 automatic transmission (revered as the finest automatic transmission ever built, and commonly called Turbo Hydramatic 400), U-shape Hurst (<b>automatic</b> transmission) <b>shifter</b> and linkage, located on a center console. [...] A 1968 or 1969 GS400 equipped with the TH400 auto transmission was faster off the line than many of its contemporaries thanks to an unusually [...] "low" [...] 1st gear. Shift pattern for the TH400 from most forward position is Park, Reverse, Neutral, Drive, Second, First. A standard 3 spd or optional 4 spd manual gearbox was also available. [...] Compression ratio on this engine was a very sensible 10.25:1, which allowed {{for the use of}} any grade gasoline to be used in normal driving without pinging. [...] The factory air cleaner was covered with a large round chromed cover, secured with a wing nut. [...] The small air scoop behind the hood hinge-line on the 1968 model was fake, although it could perhaps technically be called functional, as it could have bettered the air flow available to the climate control system.|$|R
2500|$|The 2014 Chevrolet Corvette uses an LT1 6.2 L V8 (376 cu in) making [...] or [...] {{with the}} {{optional}} performance exhaust. The LT1 engine (the [...] "LT1" [...] designation {{was first used}} by GM in 1970 and then later in 1992.) is in the Gen V family of small block engines, which {{will be used in}} GM vehicles as the new small V8 option. It features three technologies new to the GM V8, though widely available on other engines in the marketplace: direct injection, variable valve timing, and an active fuel management system. Fuel injectors are located under the intake manifold. The Corvette remains rear-wheel drive with the transaxle located in the rear. Transmission choices include a 7-speed manual or a 8-speed <b>automatic</b> with paddle <b>shifters.</b> The new interior includes wide-bottom seats as standard, with sportier versions with high side bolsters optional. The Corvette's flag logo has been revised for the new car and a small casting of a stingray has been added to the car's ornamentation.|$|R
50|$|Newer {{small cars}} and MPVs, like the Suzuki MR Wagon, the Fiat Multipla, the Toyota Matrix, the Pontiac Vibe, the Chrysler RT {{platform}} cars, the Honda Element, the Honda Civic, and the Honda Avancier may feature a manual or <b>automatic</b> transmission gear <b>shifter</b> {{located on the}} vehicle's instrument panel, similar to the mid-1950s Chryslers and Powerglide Corvairs. Console-mounted shifters are similar to floor-mounted gear shifters in {{that most of the}} ones used in modern cars operate on a horizontal plane and can be mounted to the vehicle's transmission {{in much the same way}} a floor-mounted shifter can. However, because of the location of the gear shifter in comparison to the locations of the column shifter and the floor shifter, as well as the positioning of the shifter to the rest of the controls on the panel often require that the gearshift be mounted in a space that does not feature a lot of controls integral to the vehicle's operation or frequently used controls, such as those for the car stereo or car air conditioning, to help prevent accidental activation or driver confusion, especially in right-hand drive cars.|$|R
5000|$|Sold as the 1000 through 1500 D-series, the Light Line pickup was {{originally}} offered with four of International Harvester's own V8s, with displacements of 266, 304, 345 or 392 cubic inches. AMC's 232 ci inline-six engine {{had also been}} available, since the 1968 C-Series. Several different wheelbases (115, 119, 131, 132, 149, 156, or 164 inches) were also offered. The 119 inch version (as used for the Travelall) was only available as a bare chassis. In addition to the regular cab pickup, station wagon [...] "Travelall" [...] bodywork was also available, as was a four-door panel van version of the wagon and a four-door pickup called the [...] "Travelette" [...] (only on the 149 or 164 inch wheelbase). The standard transmission was a three-speed manual with a column shift, {{but there were also}} four- and five-speed manuals and a three-speed <b>automatics,</b> with floor-mounted <b>shifters</b> optional. The <b>automatic</b> transmission was not available in heavier duty models such as the 1300D and the rare 1500D. Several models were also available as a cab on a bare frame for construction of stake-bed or other applications, some with an optional dual-wheel rear end, with available load ratings up to seven tons. These larger models were not popular, with most buyers opting instead for the [...] Loadstar models.|$|R
5000|$|The Suprima S {{shares a}} large {{majority}} of its body panels and parts with the Prevé saloon, its sister car which launched approximately 16 months prior, on 16 April 2012. The Suprima comes in a choice of five colours and two trim variants, the Executive and Premium trims respectively. Both variants are powered by Proton's 1.6L CamPro Turbo engine, paired to a seven-speed ProTronic CVT, Proton's version of a manumatic transmission. All Suprimas come standard with 6 SRS airbags, an Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) with Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD), Brake Assist (BA), Traction Control (TCS) and Electronic Stability Control (ESC). Also standard is the Proton Infotainment System, an advanced Android OS-powered 7" [...] LCD touchscreen GPS head unit with DVD, Bluetooth, USB, iPod & 4G WiFi compatibility. The Premium trim is equipped with exclusive kit such as Anthracite-shade leather seats, two tweeter speakers, front parking sensors, a reverse camera and brighter LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) in addition to features previously offered in the Prevé's Premium trim, namely the steering-mounted paddle <b>shifters,</b> <b>automatic</b> headlights and wipers, climate control, cruise control and push-start engine ignition. The Suprima S is priced between RM76,338 and RM79,988 respectively. Proton has since sold more than 835 Suprima S units between mid-August and the month of September.|$|R
25|$|The Proton Prevé {{was finally}} {{unveiled}} on 16 April 2012 at Seri Kembangan by the Prime Minister of Malaysia, Najib Razak. It launched {{with a choice}} of six colours and three trim variants, the Executive MT, Executive CVT and Premium CVT respectively. Both Executive trim variants are powered by Proton's 1.6L CamPro IAFM+ engine. The Executive MT is paired with a five-speed manual gearbox whereas the Executive CVT is equipped with a six-speed CVT. The Premium trim is offered with the superior 1.6L turbocharged CamPro CFE engine, mated to a seven-speed CVT, also known as ProTronic, Proton's version of a manumatic transmission. Safety-wise, the Executive variants are equipped with dual SRS airbags and an Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) with Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD) whereas the Premium trim features an additional two airbags, Brake Assist (BA), Traction Control (TCS) and Electronic Stability Control (ESC) on top of those offered in the Executive.
