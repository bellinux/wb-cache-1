5|$|Early in {{the third}} quarter, the Triangles started a {{possession}} on their own 35-yard line. Four consecutive run plays carried them to midfield. Then, Lou Partlow had <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>run</b> to the 10-yard line. The possession ended with a rushing touchdown from Partlow. The other Triangle score came {{in the middle of}} the fourth quarter. Frank Bacon returned a punt return for a 60-yard touchdown. After both touchdowns, George Kinderdine was responsible for the extra points.|$|E
5|$|Tech {{received}} Florida State's kickoff at {{its goal}} line {{and returned the}} ball to the 11-yard line, where Tech's offense took over. Kendrick ran for 12yards and a first down, but then Vick fumbled on a rush to the left. Florida State recovered the ball, and the Seminoles' offense was given the ball at the Virginia Tech 35-yard line. On the first play after the fumble, Chaney broke free for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>run</b> that gave State a first down inside the Virginia Tech 10-yard line. The Seminoles were pushed backward on two consecutive plays and committed a chop block before Bowden was forced to send in Janikowski to kick a 32-yard field goal. The kick gave Florida State a 3929 lead with 10:26 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|The Giants' 12–4 {{record in}} 1989 was the NFC's second-best (only to San Francisco's 14–2 record) They lost their divisional playoff game in {{overtime}} to the Rams, 19–13. The {{highlight of the}} game was wide receiver Flipper Anderson's catch of the game-winning touchdown pass. After catching the ball, Anderson made <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>run</b> to the end zone, silencing the crowd in attendance. In 1989, free-agent acquisition Ottis Anderson ran for 1,023yards and caught 28 passes. Rookie Dave Meggett also emerged as a threat on third downs and special teams, catching 34 passes for 531 yards, and making the Pro Bowl.|$|E
40|$|The {{argument}} for controlling inflation through monetary targeting assumes {{the presence of}} a stable money demand relation. Though monetary targeting is no more the major monetary policy instrument in South Africa, money demand relation {{is still one of the}} channels through which monetary policy affects inflation, which makes is it reasonable to see if <b>a</b> stable <b>long</b> <b>run</b> money demand relation exists in South Africa. Using a Cointegrated VAR method, this study attempts to see if <b>a</b> stable <b>long</b> <b>run</b> money demand relation exists in South Africa. The VAR model constitutes short term interest rate, long term interest rate, inflation, exchange rate, real money and real income as system variables. The findings suggest three cointegrated relations: <b>a</b> relation between <b>long</b> <b>run</b> constant money velocity and inflation; a relation between exchange rate and the short term interest rate, with the shift dummy included; and a relation between the bond rate, inflation and real income. The empirical evidence, however, does not find <b>a</b> stable <b>long</b> <b>run</b> money demand relation unlike previous studies. Neither does the empirical finding support the hypothesis that inflation responds to deviation from <b>a</b> stable <b>long</b> <b>run</b> money demand relation...|$|R

5|$|Following Air Force's post-score kickoff {{and a short}} return by the Hokies, Virginia Tech's offense began a {{drive at}} its 28-yard line. A five-yard false-start penalty pushed the Tech offense back five yards, but <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>run</b> by quarterback Mark Cox made up the penalty and earned Tech a first down. Another first down followed, and Tech {{penetrated}} into the Air Force side of the field. Once there, Eddie Hunter evaded Falcon defenders for a 33-yard run that took the Hokies inside Air Force's 20-yard line. Three more plays pushed Tech forward, inside Air Force's five-yard line, for a first down. On the next play, Maurice Williams ran forward, into the end zone. The touchdown and extra point gave Virginia Tech a 73 lead with 1:42 left in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|On the ground, the Hokies {{had even}} less success {{than they did}} in the air. Branden Ore, Tech's {{starting}} tailback, earned 42yards in 20shortrushes during the game. With <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>run</b> of eight yards, Ore was kept in check by Georgia's defense. The only other Hokie to achieve positive yardage on the ground was backup tailback Kenny Lewis, who only managed five yards. Glennon was sacked three times, once fumbling the ball. These sacks wiped out the 11 rushing yards he managed to gain during his scrambles for yardage. In the second quarter, Virginia Tech was aided by excellent field position, enabling them to score three offensive touchdowns. Tech's average starting field position in that quarter was the Georgia 48-yard line, allowing for easy scores even for a struggling offense.|$|E
5|$|With {{seven seconds}} left in {{regulation}} and the score tied at 28, Yeldon made <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>run</b> as time expired. The play was reviewed from the replay booth, and one second was put back on the clock after the referees determined Yeldon had stepped out of bounds just before time expired. Alabama then opted to attempt a game-winning 57-yard field goal, but chose freshman kicker Adam Griffith over Foster due to Foster's woes that day. Alabama failed its fourth field goal of the day with Griffith's attempt falling short, but Auburn's Chris Davis fielded it nine yards deep in his own end zone, and with no Crimson Tide skill players in his path (the field goal unit was made up almost entirely of offensive linemen), sprinted for a 109-yard touchdown return and a 34–28 Auburn win. The loss brought Alabama's all-time record against the Tigers to 42–35–1.|$|E

5|$|After {{one long}} run in The Heiress, Richardson {{appeared}} in another, RCSherriff's Home at Seven, in 1950. He played an amnesiac bank clerk who fears {{he may have}} committed murder. He later recreated the part in a radio broadcast, and in a film version, which was his sole venture into direction for the screen. Once he had played himself into a role in <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>run,</b> Richardson felt able to work during the daytime in films, and made two others in the early 1950s beside the film of the Sherriff piece: Outcast of the Islands, directed by Carol Reed, and David Lean's The Sound Barrier, released in 1951 and 1952 respectively. For the latter he won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor. With his characteristic liking for switching between modern roles and the classics, his next stage part was Colonel Vershinin in Three Sisters in 1951. He headed a strong cast, with Renée Asherson, Margaret Leighton and Celia Johnson as the sisters, but reviewers found the production weakly directed, and some felt that Richardson failed to disguise his positive personality when playing the ineffectual Vershinin. He did not attempt Chekhov again {{for more than a}} quarter of a century.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{advanced}} {{to face the}} two-time defending champion San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship game on January 20, 1991, in front of 65,750 fans at Candlestick Park. The game was a rematch of the 7–3 49ers win one month earlier. The teams alternated field goals {{in the first and}} second quarter to make the score 6–6 at halftime. Less than five minutes into the third quarter, 49ers quarterback Joe Montana threw a 61-yard touchdown pass to receiver John Taylor to give San Francisco a 13–6 lead. A Giants field goal made the score 13–9 {{at the end of the}} third quarter. With 9:42 remaining in the game, Leonard Marshall sacked and injured Montana, who left the game. The Giants got the ball back, but were stopped on a key third down and one. On fourth down, Parcells called a fake punt, which resulted in <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>run</b> by Gary Reasons to set up another Giants field goal, making the score 13–12. The 49ers then attempted to run out the clock, but Giants nose tackle Erik Howard made a key play, fighting through a double-team to knock the ball out of running back Roger Craig's possession. Lawrence Taylor caught the fumble in mid-air, which gave the ball to the Giants at their own 43-yard line. Hostetler completed passes to Bavaro and Baker, advancing the Giants to within Matt Bahr's field-goal range. Bahr's fifth made kick of the day, a 42-yarder with no time left on the clock, gave the Giants a 15–13 victory.|$|E
5|$|After Australia {{had been}} bowled out for 249 {{in the first}} innings of the First Test at Trent Bridge, Lindwall's high paced swing yielded 5/57 and cut England down for 144. However, Australia were then bowled out for only 123, leaving England 228 for victory. They were 1/120 with Lindwall wicketless as rain curtailed the match. In the Second Test at Lord's, England had reached 1/177 at stumps {{on the second day}} in reply to Australia's 346. The {{following}} day, Lindwall yorked rising star Tom Graveney and took 5/66 to restrict England to a lead of 26 runs. In Australia's second innings, Lindwall scored the fastest half-century in Ashes history. He took just 48 minutes to reach the mark, with two sixes and five fours. The match was drawn with Lindwall taking 2/26 in the second innings. Lindwall had helped to reduce England to 3/12 at stumps on the fourth day after removing Don Kenyon and Hutton with the new ball, but defiant batting on the final day saved the English. The Third Test was again drawn due to heavy rain, with Lindwall failing to pass double figures in either innings and taking 2/30 in the first innings. Hassett won the toss for the fourth consecutive Test at Headingley and sent England into bat. In front of his home crowd in Yorkshire, Hutton was yorked second ball from a pacy inswinging yorker. Lindwall produced a display of fast and accurate pace bowling, taking 5/54 from 35 overs as England managed only 169. After Australia took a 97 run lead, Lindwall took 3/104 to help leave the tourists with a victory target of 177. This was not before dour English all rounder Trevor Bailey attempted to stone-wall an Australian victory by batting for over four hours for 38 runs. Along with Miller, the pair took 14 wickets between them, displaying their pivotal role in Australia's bowling attack, especially {{in the absence of the}} injured Johnston, who was unavailable for most of the tour. Hutton ordered Bedser and Bailey to bowl leg theory from <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>run,</b> sending balls down the leg side to prevent the Australians from scoring. England held on for a draw with Australia 30 runs short when time ran out. The teams met at The Oval for the deciding Test and Australia could manage 275 after winning the toss with Lindwall striking a quickfire 62 noted for an array of off drives to top score and push the total to respectability. Lindwall then took 4/70 but it was not enough to prevent England taking a 31 run lead. Australia collapsed for 162 in the second innings, with the Surrey spin twins of Jim Laker and Tony Lock taking nine wickets between them. This left England 132 to win, something they achieved with eight wickets intact. Lindwall was unable to remove any of the Englishmen.|$|E
