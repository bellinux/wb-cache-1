Based on the simplest deformation theory of plasticity, the overall transverse polyaxial elastoplastic constitutive equations for <b>an</b> incompressible <b>composite</b> are obtained. <b>A</b> simple formula is suggested to evaluate the average stress in the fibres. Furthermore, with the prediction of the overall transverse elastic moduli of <b>a</b> compressible <b>composite,</b> the overall transverse uniaxial stress-strain curve for <b>a</b> compressible <b>composite</b> in the entire elastic-plastic range is obtained.

5|$|John Kadlec of Beta Engineering {{originally}} planned {{the use of}} 8-inch HCS, which he specified could withstand 120 pounds per square foot, a load which exceeded specifications on all 8-inch HCS. During the bidding process, the owners were advised by a bidder, Precon, that the specified load could not be handled by the HCS without reinforcements from <b>a</b> <b>composite</b> concrete topping. However, Kadlec advised the owners that the plans called for 8-inch HCS which could withstand the load without reinforcement from topping. The contract was thus awarded to Coreslab, despite Coreslab's design tables indicating that the specified project loads were 38% higher than the maximum load. In 1992, over {{a decade after the}} mall's construction, Coreslab retracted the claim to be able to support the load without the use of <b>a</b> <b>composite</b> topping.|$|E
