25|$|<b>Archaeologists</b> prize local {{knowledge}} and often liaise with local historical and archaeological societies, {{which is one}} reason why Community archaeology projects are starting to become more common. Often <b>archaeologists</b> are assisted by the public in the locating of archaeological sites, which professional <b>archaeologists</b> have neither the funding, nor the time to do.|$|R

5000|$|A {{top-down}} approach to community archaeology is when <b>archaeologists</b> decide before consultation what {{the goals of}} the project will be, or what benefits will be provided to the community is not really community archaeology at all. The {{top-down approach}} creates a one-sided exchange of information from the <b>archaeologists</b> to the community and precludes real collaboration. Blume found the “archaeologist-informant relationship be essentially exploitative and patronizing because it takes place on the <b>archaeologist’s</b> terms—the informant must address issues that the <b>archaeologists</b> understand—and it excludes participation by members who are unable or unwilling to participate on those terms.” [...] To succeed at community archaeology, <b>Archaeologists</b> have begun to undertake more reflexive collaborations with indigenous communities.|$|R
50|$|The {{chartered}} Institute for <b>Archaeologists</b> {{was founded}} as the Institute of Field <b>Archaeologists</b> {{to represent the}} growing number of 'professional' <b>archaeologists,</b> caused by the increase in rescue archaeology in the 1960s and 70s. An increasing number of <b>archaeologists</b> came to feel a need for a body to maintain standards, tackle poor working conditions, give <b>archaeologists</b> a national voice and create a real profession. The Council for British Archaeology after some debate decided not to take on this mantle so in 1979 the Association for the Promotion of Field <b>Archaeologists</b> was launched and canvassed opinion on what form the new body should take. Elections were held and APIFA handed over responsibility to the first council on the 21 December 1982. The first chair and Member No 1 was Professor Peter Addyman and other notable early members were Mick Aston (21), Philip Barker and Francis Pryor (15).|$|R

5|$|In 1956, Robert Carl Suggs, {{with the}} American Museum of Natural History, led the first stratigraphical {{excavation}} {{of the islands}} and uncovered many dog bone fragments and one dog burial across a few sites {{on the island of}} Nuku Hiva. Between 1964 and 1965, American <b>archaeologist</b> Yosihiko H. Sinoto, with the Bishop Museum, discovered a drilled dog canine used as a pendant, one pre-molar and two dog burials in the sand dunes at Hane on the island of Ua Huka. In 1998, American <b>archaeologist</b> Barry Vladimir Rolett discovered dog bones in all levels of settlement at Hanamiai, on the island of Tahuata, indicating that the breed may have continued to exist on this island until the mid-19th century. Some of these bones had visible cut marks. In 2000, French <b>archaeologist</b> Pascal Sellier discovered three dog skeletons alongside several human burials at Manihina, Ua Huka; one dog was buried in a coffin.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, the {{wreckage}} of an Avenger was found off the Florida coast during the search for {{the wreckage}} of the Space Shuttle Challenger.

5|$|Maiden Castle has {{provided}} inspiration for composer John Ireland and authors Thomas Hardy and John Cowper Powys. The study of hill forts was popularised in the 19th century by <b>archaeologist</b> Augustus Pitt Rivers. In the 1930s, <b>archaeologist</b> Mortimer Wheeler and Tessa Verney Wheeler undertook the first archaeological excavations at Maiden Castle, raising its profile among the public. Further excavations {{were carried out}} under Niall Sharples, which added {{to an understanding of}} the site and repaired damage caused in part by the large number of visitors. Today the site is protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument and is maintained by English Heritage.|$|E
50|$|Each August, <b>archaeologists</b> gather under open skies {{somewhere in}} the southwestern United States or {{northern}} Mexico. They set up a large tent for shade, and then spend three or more days together discussing recent research and {{the problems of the}} field and challenges of the profession. In recent years, Native Americans, avocational <b>archaeologists,</b> the general public and media organizations have come to speak with the <b>archaeologists.</b> These individuals and groups play an increasingly important role, as participants and as audience, helping professional <b>archaeologists</b> celebrate archaeological research and to mark cultural continuity.|$|R

5|$|The art of batik is {{most highly}} {{developed}} in the island of Java in Indonesia. In Java, all the materials for the process are readily available — cotton and beeswax and plants from which different vegetable dyes are made. Indonesian batik predates written records: G. P. Rouffaer argues that the technique might have been introduced during the 6th or 7th century from India or Sri Lanka. On the other hand, the Dutch <b>archaeologist</b> J.L.A. Brandes and the Indonesian <b>archaeologist</b> F.A. Sutjipto believe Indonesian batik is a native tradition, since other regions in Indonesia such as Toraja, Flores, Halmahera, and Papua, which were not directly influenced by Hinduism, have an age-old tradition of batik making.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} of the Mycenaean civilization by the German amateur <b>archaeologist</b> Heinrich Schliemann in the nineteenth century, and the {{discovery of}} the Minoan civilization in Crete by the British <b>archaeologist</b> Sir Arthur Evans in the twentieth century, helped to explain many existing questions about Homer's epics and provided archaeological evidence for many of the mythological details about gods and heroes. Unfortunately, the evidence about myths and rituals at Mycenaean and Minoan sites is entirely monumental, as the Linear B script (an ancient form of Greek found in both Crete and mainland Greece) was used mainly to record inventories, although certain names of gods and heroes have been tentatively identified.|$|E
40|$|In the 19 th century, ‘scientific archaeologists’ {{split from}} their {{antiquarian}} colleagues {{over the role}} that provenience (context) plays {{in the value of}} an artifact. These <b>archaeologists</b> focus on documenting an artifact’s context when they remove it from its original location. <b>Archaeologists</b> then use this contextual information to place these artifacts within a particular larger assemblage, in a particular time and space. Once analyzed, the artifacts found in a site or region can be used to document, to understand, and explain the past. Given the central place of context for archaeological excavation, <b>archaeologists</b> have done everything in their power to combat the black market. Hoping to stem the tide, <b>archaeologists</b> have leveled attacks on those who excavate these materials, those who traffic in them, and those who purchase them. Unfortunately, despite decades of argument and legal wrangling, <b>archaeologists</b> have been unable to stop the black market. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to analyze this failure from the supply side (what <b>archaeologists</b> call looting) and to suggest better ways to engage other stakeholders to the benefit of most, if not all...|$|R
