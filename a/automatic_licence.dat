50|$|In the United States, {{citation}} fines {{can vary}} widely between jurisdictions {{for the same}} behaviour, usually between $25 and $1000. In countries such as Finland, however, they are specific proportions of the violator's income, and fines in excess of $100,000 can be assessed to wealthy individuals. In Canada, each province is individual in how they treat similar behaviour and each violation usually includes a set fine and demerit points against the driver's license. For example, a speeding ticket in Ontario of 50+ km over is 6 demerit points against the driver's licence with the approximate fine calculated as (km over x 9.75) x 1.25, as well it carries a one-week <b>automatic</b> <b>licence</b> suspension and car impoundment. In Manitoba speeding in excess of 49 km is 8 demerit points and a fine of 557 dollars.|$|E
40|$|This project {{examined}} the effects of speeding penalty changes that occurred in Queensland in 2003 on the behaviour of speeding offenders. These penalty changes included increasing the number of offence categories, and in turn narrowing the range of speeds associated with the offence categories; increasing the monetary fines for all offences, with the largest increases observed for high-range offences; and introducing <b>automatic</b> <b>licence</b> suspension and an eight demerit point penalty for the highest offence category. To explore the impact of the penalty changes, offence data collected for two cohorts of motorists in Queensland who were caught speeding prior to and subsequent to the penalty changes (N = 84, 456) were compared. The first cohort consisted of individuals (operators of all vehicles including motorcycles) who committed a speeding offence in May 2001 (two years prior to the speeding penalty change); and individuals who committed a speeding offence in May 2003 (one month after the introduction of the penalty change). Four measures of recidivism were devised and used to assess the effects of the new penalties with regard to deterring the speeding behaviour of offenders. Additionally, the project investigated the relationship between speeding offences, other risky driving behaviours, crash involvement, and criminal behaviour...|$|E

25|$|Motor car {{licences}} {{issued in}} the United Kingdom distinguish between automatic and manual transmission vehicles, {{depending on whether}} or not a driving test was passed in a vehicle with manual transmission (unless a vehicle test was taken in the UK before such distinction was made). While a manual transmission vehicle licence permits the holder to drive a vehicle of either kind, an <b>automatic</b> transmission vehicle <b>licence</b> is solely for vehicles with <b>automatic</b> transmission. The <b>licence</b> also shows whether a driver requires glasses or contact lenses to meet the legal driving requirements, if known.|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} progressive geographical {{expansion of}} free trade zones within countries {{as a form of}} trade liberalization and compare observationally equivalent liberalization involving changes in the coverage of a free trade zone for a fixed tariff rate, and tariff reductions applying to all trade if there are no free trade zones in the country (in the sense of generating similar changes in trade volumes). Our work is motivated by China’s approach to service trade liberalization in banking and other areas of progressive additions of cities to <b>automatic</b> <b>licence</b> treatment for foreign entities. We use numerical simulation methods to compare conventional national tariff reductions to trade liberalization achieved through the geographical expansion {{of free trade}} zones in terms of welfare impacts. Either the size of the free trade zone with a fixed tariff, or the tariff rate given the size of the free trade zone can be endogenously determined so as to yield observational equivalence in the sense of trade volume impacts across trade policy changes. Numerical results overwhelmingly indicate larger welfare costs from imposing geographically restrictive schemes since a higher tariff applies to a smaller fraction of trade, and distortions within country trade also apply. Numerical policy analyses using a conventional tariff-equivalent ad valorem modeling approach to evaluate the impacts of liberalizing geographical barriers can thus be highly misleading. We explore both pure exchange and with production cases, and relate our discussion to earlier literature on free trade zones. ...|$|E
40|$|Vehicles play a {{vital role}} in modern day {{transportation}} systems. Number plate provides a standard means of identification for any vehicle. To serve this purpose, <b>automatic</b> <b>licence</b> plate recognition system was developed. This consisted of four major steps: Pre-processing of the obtained image, extraction of licence plate region, segmentation and character recognition. In earlier research, direct application of Sobel edge detection algorithm or applying threshold were used as key steps to extract the licence plate region, which does not produce effective results when the captured image is subjected to the high intensity of light. The use of morphological operations causes deformity in the characters during segmentation. We propose a novel algorithm to tackle the mentioned issues through a unique edge detection algorithm. It is also a tedious task to create and update the database of required vehicles frequently. This problem is solved by the use of Internet of things(IOT) where an online database can be created and updated from any module instantly. Also, through IoT, we connect all the cameras in a geographical area to one server to create a universal eye which drastically increases the probability of tracing a vehicle over having manual database attached to each camera for identification purpose.

50|$|The GMC is now {{empowered}} to license and regularly revalidate {{the practice of}} doctors in the UK. When the licensing scheme was introduced in 2009, 13,500 (6.1%) of registered doctors chose not to be licensed. Unlicensed but registered doctors {{are likely to be}} non-practising lecturers, managers, or practising overseas, or retired. Whereas all registered doctors in the UK were offered a one-off <b>automatic</b> practise <b>licence</b> in November 2009, since December 2012 no licence will be automatically revalidated, but will be subject to a revalidation process every five years. No doctor may now be registered for the first time without also being issued a licence to practice, although a licensed doctor may give up their licence if they choose. No unlicensed but registered doctor in the UK is subject to revalidation. However, unlicensed but registered doctors in the UK are still subject to fitness-to-practice proceedings, and required to follow the GMC's good medical practice guidance.|$|R
40|$|This {{project is}} {{concerned}} with <b>automatic</b> detection of <b>licence</b> plate based on finding abscissa in entering image. In the preface the main problem of presents´ methods is decribed. Then the definition of some basic methods, which are concerned with mentioned problematic, follows. Their results are discussed and each way of solution is assessed. In conclusion of the chapter, the algorithm for detection of licence plate is designed. It is done {{on the base of}} gained information and because of the aim of the work. Next chapter is devoted to the detailed description of my work. It is underlined emphasis on exact and reliable detection of abscissae and following clustering into consistent units. In the end of the work a few experiments for demonstration of efectiveness and reliability of selected method are made. In conclusion, gained results are discussed and the convience of this approach of detection of numberplate is assessed...|$|R
