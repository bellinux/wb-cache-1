40|$|Abstract. How {{to improve}} saw {{efficiency}} and reduce cost {{is a key}} problem in sawing very hard and compact rock. The previous research achievements show {{that one of the}} effective measures is to apply layered segment, but to date its structure has not been studied theoretically. In this paper, calculation formulae of thickness of pure alloy layer is determined by analyzing sawing mechanism, rock <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> lateral <b>breakage,</b> sawing parameters, and diamond size etc. Results of research show that the layered segment consists of about 84 % impregnated layer and 16 % pure alloy layer. When the circular saw blade is sawing, diamond of impregnated layer fractures rock by micro cut and micro shear, whereas the pure alloy layers fracture rock by crater effect and micro vibration. Productive tests of sawing two kinds of granites, such as 603 and 635 stones, using the circular diamond saw blade, show that saw efficiency is improved and saw cost is reduced greatly...|$|R
40|$|The {{degradation}} of coarse aggregates under shear stresses {{and its influence}} on the shear strength is studied, considering the energy consumption by particle breakage during shearing. An analytical model is developed relating the deviator stress ratio, dilatancy, friction angle and particle breakage under triaxial loading. Large-scale triaxial testing of latite basalt has been conducted, and the extent <b>of</b> particle <b>breakage</b> during shearing has been quantified. The <b>breakage</b> <b>of</b> particles under monotonic triaxial loading has been considered {{within the scope of}} this paper, and the modelling <b>of</b> particle <b>breakage</b> <b>of</b> aggregates under cyclic loading will be presented in a follow-up paper. The results show that the <b>breakage</b> <b>of</b> particles continues to increase beyond the peak deviator stress. The energy consumption by particle breakage is non-linearly related to the particle breakage index. The model also evaluates the effect <b>of</b> particle <b>breakage</b> on the friction <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> ballast. This study sheds further light on the basic <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> friction, which is independent <b>of</b> the <b>breakage</b> <b>of</b> particles during shearing...|$|R

Grinding performance was assessed by determining the throughput, specific rate <b>of</b> <b>breakage,</b> particle size distribution, power consumption, and energy required for grinding using a hammermill. The physical and flow properties investigated were loose and tapped bulk density, compressibility index, Hausner ratio, particle density, and static <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> repose. The throughput and specific rate <b>of</b> <b>breakage</b> <b>of</b> corncobs were very low compared to corn and decreased with increasing moisture content. The energy required for grinding corncobs was higher than that for corn. The particle size of ground corn was smaller than that of ground cobs; however, {{there were no significant}} differences across moisture levels. The particle size distribution of ground corn was narrower than that of ground cobs.

40|$|Purpose To determine, among {{a sample}} of young black male (YBM), whether female {{application}} of male condoms for penile–vaginal intercourse {{would be associated with}} higher or lower rates <b>of</b> <b>breakage</b> or slippage. A secondary aim was to investigate if higher rates <b>of</b> <b>breakage</b> or slippage were associated with increased odds of acquiring chlamydia and/or gonorrhea. Methods A cross-sectional study of 412 YBM, aged 15 to 23 years, was conducted in three US cities located in the Southern United States. Results Among YBM reporting frequent female application of condoms, 43. 5 % reported one or more instance <b>of</b> <b>breakage</b> or slippage, compared with those reporting less frequent female application (27. 2 %, P =. 003). Among YBM reporting one or more event <b>of</b> <b>breakage</b> or slippage, 25. 4 % tested positive for chlamydia and/or gonorrhea. In contrast, among those not reporting breakage or slippage, 17. 2 % tested positive (P =. 047). Conclusions Findings suggest that educational and behavioral interventions should seek to improve young women's skills relative to condom application and use.

In contrast to the expected trend, smaller particles exhibited increased breakage rates. At the onset of shearing at low stresses Aspirin particles experienced slightly more breakage than the Paracetamol, however prolonged shearing resulted in greater <b>breakage</b> <b>of</b> Paracetamol. <b>Breakage</b> occurred initially through chipping with some fragmentation, particularly more noticeable for Aspirin, with an increase in abrasion after extensive shear strain for Paracetamol.

40|$|For {{successful}} mechanistic modelling of {{any size}} reduction equipment, {{an understanding of the}} fundamentals <b>of</b> the <b>breakage</b> mechanisms is essential. This understanding will allow the comparison <b>of</b> <b>breakage</b> events and the quantification of the effect of key factors such as applied strain rate, particle size, and particle shape while they are isolated. This paper uses the concept <b>of</b> analysing <b>breakage</b> <b>of</b> a single particle as a multi-stage process to compare different breakage mechanisms and to quantify the effect of factors such as applied strain rate. This approach regards a single breakage event as a process affected by three sub-processes; first (or primary) fracture, capture and spatial distribution of fragments. The first fracture is assumed to be independent <b>of</b> <b>breakage</b> mechanism and to be a characteristic of the ore type. On the other hand, capture and spatial distribution are influenced by the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>breakage</b> environment, the kinetic energy of fragments and their brittleness. The focus {{of this paper is to}} examine how each sub-process <b>of</b> a <b>breakage</b> event is influenced by applied strain rate and its impact on the size distribution of progeny. In this work, three rock types of widely different strength and brittle behaviour, i. e. LKAB magnetite ore, Beaudesert silicate and Bundaberg quartz, were tested at various energy levels using the impact and compression breakage mechanisms. To isolate the effect of spatial distribution of fragments, particles were forced to remain in the breakage zone. In this condition, similar progeny size distributions were generated from compression and impact mechanisms at similar energy levels. However, allowing natural distribution of fragments produced coarser progeny from the compression of silicate...|$|R

40|$|Applying DEM to {{prediction}} of tumbling mill performance is challenging because several different modes <b>of</b> <b>breakage</b> {{are active in}} the process. As our knowledge <b>of</b> <b>breakage</b> and computational capacity improve, it is worth revisiting previous simulation tasks which did not produce a satisfactorily realistic description of a measured process. At SAG 2006, we reported the simulated and measured outcomes of treating a well characterised ore in a 1. 2 m diameter mill. This well instrumented, pilot scale mill at the University of KwaZulu-Natal has been combined with some new approaches to ore testing to allow different modes <b>of</b> <b>breakage</b> to be tested. The mill design allows the rate of generation of fine material to be measured in close to real time for autogenous and SAG mill charges. The updated simulation model estimates mass loss with particle evolution and embeds the cumulative damage and breakage. To more clearly delineate the effects of different types <b>of</b> <b>breakage,</b> surface wear has not been included in these simulations. The simulated results are compared with the measured results. The cumulative damage model is more realistic for SAG operation but is inadequate for AG. Hence, any realistic model must incorporate several breakage mechanisms.

40|$|Particle {{breakage}} {{can significantly}} change the fabric (size {{and shape of}} particles and contact network) of a granular material, affecting highly the material's macroscopic response. In this paper, oedometric compression tests are performed on zeolite specimens and x-ray computed micro-tomography is employed, to acquire high resolution 3 D images of the specimens throughout the test. The images are processed, to describe breakage spatially and quantify it throughout the test and gain information about the mechanisms leading to particle breakage. In addition to the image processing, the discrete element method (DEM) is used to study the initiation and likelihood <b>of</b> particle <b>breakage,</b> by simulating the experimental test {{during the early stages}} of loading and using quantitative results from the images to inform and validate the DEM model. A discrete digital image correlation is used, in order to incrementally identify intact grains and simultaneously get results about the strain field within the specimen, as well as the kinematics of individual grains and fragments. In the initial stages <b>of</b> <b>breakage,</b> there is a clear boundary effect on the spatial distribution <b>of</b> <b>breakage,</b> as it is concentrated at the moving boundary (more than 90 % <b>of</b> total <b>breakage)</b> and circumferentially (more than 70 % <b>of</b> total <b>breakage)</b> close to the apparatus cell. The DEM model can reproduce the bulk response of the material until the point where substantial breakage governs the macroscopic response and it starts to soften. Additionally, there is an initial indication that the spatial distribution of the force network matches the localisation <b>of</b> <b>breakage</b> radially, but {{it does not seem to}} localise close to the loading platen.

40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} {{characterize}} very weak adhesive surfaces, {{we have developed}} a quantitative test inspired by the Johnson, Kendall, and Roberts adhesion test for soft adhesives, which relies on the formation and then the rupture of a capillary bridge between the surface to be tested and a liquid bath. Both the shape and the kinetics <b>of</b> <b>breakage</b> <b>of</b> the capillary bridge for various coatings put into contact with liquids of various viscosities and surface tensions have been studied. Several pull off regimes can be distinguished. For low pull off velocities, a quasi-static regime is observed, well described by capillary equations and sensitive to the hysteresis <b>of</b> the contact <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> the fluid on the coating. Above a critical pull off velocity {{that depends on the}} fluid viscosity, a dynamic regime is observed, characterized by the formation of a flat pancake of fluid on the coating that recedes more slowly than the capillary bridge itself. After the <b>breakage</b> <b>of</b> the capillary bridge, a small drop can remain attached to the surface. The volume of this drop depends on the dynamical regime and is strongly affected by very small differences between the coatings.
