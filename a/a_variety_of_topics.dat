5|$|Humans {{exist in}} an {{alternate}} Domain, and {{are referred to}} as creatures with no natural defenses. Most believe that they are fictional creatures; but a few, including the Dewclaws, know that they exist.

However, she later has a son, Francis, who is born human. The series features jokes on <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>topics.</b> Many draw satirical parallels between its world and ours, making fun and sometimes social commentary on politics, sports, society, class-snobbery, school, technology, pop culture and corporate culture, for example; in January 2008 the Predator's Union was described as going on strike, in a parody of the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike.|$|E
5|$|In 1862, Wallace {{returned}} to England, where {{he moved in}} with his sister Fanny Sims and her husband Thomas.

Later that year, he visited Darwin at Down House, and became friendly with both Charles Lyell and Herbert Spencer. During the 1860s, Wallace wrote papers and gave lectures defending natural selection.

5|$|Pritzker was {{nominated}} as United States Secretary of Commerce by President Barack Obama on May2, 2013.

5|$|Benchley {{began at}} Vanity Fair with fellow Harvard Lampoon and Hasty Pudding Theatricals alumnus Robert Emmet Sherwood and future friend and {{collaborator}} Dorothy Parker, {{who had taken}} over theatre criticism from P. G. Wodehouse years earlier. The format of Vanity Fair fit Benchley's style very well, allowing his columns to have a humorous tone, often as straight parodies. Benchley's work was typically published twice a month. Some of Benchley's columns, featuring a character he created, were attributed to his pseudonym Brighton Perry, but he took credit {{for most of them}} himself. Sherwood, Parker, and Benchley became close, often having long lunches at the Algonquin Hotel. When the editorial managers went on a European trip, the three took advantage of the situation, writing articles mocking the local theatre establishment and offering parodic commentary on <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>topics,</b> such as the effect of Canadian hockey on United States fashion. This worried Sherwood, as he felt it could jeopardize his forthcoming raise.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{resignation}} from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Burnet was offered an {{office at the}} University of Melbourne in the School of Microbiology. While at the university, he wrote 13 books on <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>topics</b> including immunology, ageing and cancer, and human biology. He also wrote an autobiography entitled Changing Patterns: An Atypical Autobiography, which was released in 1968. In all, he wrote a further 16 books after his retirement from the Hall Institute. He {{was known for his}} ability to write quickly, often without a final draft, and his ability to convey a message to readers from a wide spectrum of backgrounds, but he was himself sceptical that his opinions had much influence. In 1969 he published Cellular Immunology, considered his magnum opus on immunity, attempted to show how various phenomena could be predicted by the clonal selection theory. The following year, he wrote Immunological Surveillance, which expounded his established opinion that mammals could immunise themselves through their ability to detect foreign patterns in the body. He continued to maintain an intense and focused work schedule, often shunning others to keep up a heavy writing load.|$|E
