50|$|In 2012 Philip {{and all of}} the 500 {{members of}} the {{congregation}} left the Church of Scotland over the ongoing discussions within the Church of whether to permit openly gay clergy, which the congregation saw as the Church of Scotland rejecting the Authority of Scripture. They moved to a nearby building in order to continue as an independent congregation. There was controversy after Messengers of <b>Arms</b> <b>interrupted</b> the congregational prayer meeting and requested the minister leading the prayer meeting come and meet with them. They then served him with the interim interdict. The following day, messengers-at-arms called at the St George's Tron manse to serve the same writ because there had been a mistake made by the Court in the dating of the court order. This was reported in the national press and on BBC news.|$|R

50|$|The {{most widely}} used form is the {{interrupter}} bell, which produces a continuous sound when current is applied. See animation, above. The bell or gong (B), which is often {{in the shape of}} a cup or half-sphere, is struck by a spring-loaded arm (A) with a metal ball on the end called a clapper, actuated by an electromagnet (E). In its rest position the clapper is held away from the bell a short distance by its springy arm. When an electric current is enabled to pass through the winding of the electromagnet (via a closing of the switch (K) i.e. pressing the door bell) it creates a magnetic field that attracts the iron arm of the clapper, pulling it over to give the bell a tap. This opens a pair of electrical contacts (T) attached to the clapper <b>arm,</b> <b>interrupting</b> the current to the electromagnet. The magnetic field of the electromagnet collapses, and the clapper springs away from the bell. This closes the contacts again, allowing the current to flow to the electromagnet again, so the magnet pulls the clapper over to strike the bell again. This cycle repeats rapidly, many times per second, resulting in a continuous ringing.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the armed}} forces have {{significant}} battlefield experience, their militia orientation has complicated {{the transition to a}} structured, integrated military.

50|$|On 1 November 2011, {{during an}} indoor {{football}} game in Culiacán, Sinaloa, an <b>armed</b> commando <b>interrupted</b> {{the game and}} killed Francisco Arce Rubio, the leader of Los Ántrax. According to police reports, several armed men carrying AK-47s and handguns interrupted the soccer game at the Deportivo Jimmy Ruiz stadium and forced all of the players to lie {{face down on the}} field at around 11:00 a.m. Once they had subjugated everyone on the field, the gunmen executed one of the team's managers, and then went on to kill Arce Rubio (aged 30). After the double-homicide, the gunmen departed.|$|R
5000|$|Although modern {{induction}} coils {{used for}} educational purposes all use the vibrating <b>arm</b> 'hammer' type <b>interrupter</b> described above, these were inadequate for powering the large induction coils used in spark-gap radio transmitters and x-ray machines {{around the turn}} of the 20th century. In powerful coils the high primary current created arcs at the interrupter contacts which quickly destroyed the contacts. [...] Also, since each [...] "break" [...] produces a pulse of voltage from the coil, the more breaks per second the greater the power output. Hammer interrupters were not capable of interruption rates over 200 breaks per second and the ones used on powerful coils were limited to 20 - 40 breaks per second.|$|R
50|$|Burrs' violent {{reaction}} against Mr. Black and Queenie is prohibited {{by the whole}} company dancing the Juggernaut ("The Juggernaut"). At its end, Mr. Black and Queenie are together again. To get the reaction he wants from Queenie, Burrs grabs Nadine, the minor, and makes out with her. This enrages Kate who throws Nadine to the ground by her hair. Madeline rushes to aid Nadine. Burrs cuts into Mr. Black and Queenie’s dancing. Managing to have her to himself, Burrs tells Queenie {{to stay away from}} Mr. Black. Laughing at him, Queenie says she will do whatever she chooses. He twists her <b>arm.</b> They are <b>interrupted</b> by Oscar and Phil at the piano. Burrs releases Queenie, seeing that too many people are watching.|$|R

He was an orphan ever since he was younger, and often felt lonely, but in the end, he was adopted by Tycoon Shō and was trained to become an assassin. He has the same past in the anime, but he was adopted by two agents from Saionji Konzern instead and became a part of Dark Lizards. After the castle of Evil Gods organization was collapsed to the sea, Kodoh lives with Hitto along with Teruma and Hitto's father.|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} temporal {{changes in}} recorded alcohol consumption in Sri Lanka {{during and after}} the armed conflict 1998 – 2013. Methods: District level alcohol sales, and mid-year population data for the whole study period (1998 - 2013) were consistently available from the Department of Excise and the Department of Census and Statistics for 18 of 25 districts. These data were used to estimate the recorded per capita consumption for the areas that were not directly exposed to the <b>armed</b> conflict. An <b>interrupted</b> time series design was employed to estimate the impact {{of the end of the}} armed conflict on recorded adult per capita alcohol consumption of population lived in the 18 districts. Results: Adult per capita recorded alcohol consumption among Sri Lankans living in the 18 districts was 1. 59 litres of pure alcohol in 1998. This increased up to 2. 07 litres in 2009 and 2. 55 litres in 2013. Prior to the end of the conflict in 2009 adult per capita recorded consumption increased by 0. 051 litres of pure alcohol per year (95...|$|R
5000|$|To {{operate the}} coil continually, the DC supply current must be {{repeatedly}} connected and disconnected {{to create the}} magnetic field changes needed for induction. [...] To do that, induction coils use a magnetically activated vibrating <b>arm</b> called an <b>interrupter</b> or break (A) to rapidly connect and break the current flowing into the primary coil. [...] The interrupter is mounted {{on the end of}} the coil next to the iron core. When the power is turned on, the increasing current in the primary coil produces an increasing magnetic field, the magnetic field attracts the interrupter's iron armature (A). After a time, the magnetic attraction overcomes the armature's spring force, and the armature begins to move. When the armature has moved far enough, the pair of contacts (K) in the primary circuit open and disconnect the primary current. Disconnecting the current causes the magnetic field to collapse and create the spark. Also, the collapsed field no longer attracts the armature, so the spring force accelerates the armature toward its initial position. A short time later the contacts reconnect, and the current starts building the magnetic field again. The whole process starts over and repeats many times per second. The secondary voltage [...] (red, left), is roughly proportional to the rate of change of primary current [...] (blue).|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} {{the occurrence of}} a high early viro-logical failure (VF) rate and development of resistance mutations in antiretroviral-naive patients receiving teno-fovir, didanosine and efavirenz. Methods: HIV-infected antiretroviral-naive patients with viral load ≥ 30 000 copies/ml were enrolled in a pilot randomized trial of tenofovir/didanosine (250 mg) / efavirenz with (arm A) or without (arm B) lopinavir/r for the first 12 weeks. As six cases of early VF (a drop of 1 log from the nadir) were detected (five in arm B and one in arm A who had previously stopped lopinavir/r) an unplanned interim analysis was performed. Results: A total of 29 out of 36 enrolled patients completed at least 3 months of follow-up and {{were included in the}} interim analysis. An intent-to-treat analysis showed treatment failure in 7 / 15 (46. 7 %) patients in arm B (five VF, one lost, one switched) versus 2 / 14 (14. 3 %) in arm A (one lost, one switched) (P= 0. 109). The patient in <b>arm</b> A who <b>interrupted</b> lopinavir/r at day 3 and continued with tenofovir/didano-sine/efavirenz later developed VF. At baseline, 6 / 6 VF patients had VL> 100 000 copies/ml and an advanced stage of disease (CD 4 < 200 plus CDC stage C or B 3) versus 0 / 8 non-VF patients taking the triple drug regimen (P< 0. 001). At failure, G 190 S/E alone or associ-ated with K 103 N and K 101 R mutations was detected in five patients, and K 103 N/L 100 I/V 108 I in the sixth patient. Additionally, L 74 V/I and K 65 R were detected in four and two patients, respectively. Conclusions: A high early virological failure rate and the occurrence of resistance mutations were detected in a group of antiretroviral-naive patients treated with teno-fovir/didanosine/efavirenz...|$|R
