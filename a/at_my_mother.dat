2500|$|Fry {{struggled}} to keep his homosexuality secret during his teenage years at public school, and by his own account did not engage in sexual activity for 16 years from 1979 until 1995. When asked when he first acknowledged his sexuality, Fry quipped: [...] "I suppose it all began when I {{came out of the}} womb. I looked back up <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> and thought to myself, 'That's the last time I'm going up one of those'." [...] Fry was in a 15-year relationship with Daniel Cohen, which ended in 2010. In 2016, Fry was listed number 2 on the World Pride Power list.|$|E

60|$|Lettie {{went out}} a little {{impatient}} <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> unwillingness, but Leslie stayed, nevertheless.|$|R
5000|$|A fairly {{detailed}} description of the town is given in Paul O'Grady's memoirs, <b>At</b> <b>My</b> <b>Mother's</b> Knee ... and Other Low Joints: The Autobiography.|$|R
60|$|He shot {{a mischievous}} glance <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> as he spoke, and she laid down her {{knitting}} {{on her lap}} and looked very earnestly at him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{enter the}} park!" [...] I {{repeated}} {{the words and}} stared <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> in blank astonishment. What difference could Mr. Ravenor's presence make to us? ...|$|E
60|$|She turned {{round to}} wink <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> and at Lettie. She found the latter {{sitting in the}} old {{position}} with Leslie, two in a chair. He was toying with her arm; holding it and stroking it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never!" [...] {{answered}} Proserpina, {{looking as}} miserable as she could. [...] "I shall never smile again till you set me down <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> door." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} trust myself to speak. I could only kneel <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> feet, and hide my face on her knees, as if I {{had been a}} boy again.|$|R
60|$|Then I had {{suddenly}} arrived with this eligible prospective daughter-in-law <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> high-priced hotel, and I kept insisting {{that we should}} at once migrate, we three, to foreign parts--the more foreign the better.|$|R
60|$|And {{with that}} he motioned me to precede him. Silently I pressed Fra Gervasio's hand, and on that {{departed}} {{without so much as}} another look <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> who sat there a silent witness of a scene which she approved.|$|E
60|$|I POINTED to {{the writing}} in the sketch book, and looked <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> I was not mistaken. She had seen it, as I had seen it. But she refused to {{acknowledge}} that anything had happened to alarm her--plainly as I could detect it in her face.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{glad she}} laughed <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> I {{would not give}} the old lady for a dozen beauties. That sneer did me all the good in the world. Thank you, Miss Fanshawe!" [...] And he lifted his hat from his waved locks, and made a mock reverence.|$|E
60|$|Circumstances {{had shown}} {{me the way}} that I must take, and the folly of going forth a {{fugitive}} outcast <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> bidding. I was Lord of Mondolfo, as I had said, and they should know and feel it from this hour--all of them, not excepting <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will see}} her again, never fear," [...] Harry said confidently. [...] "And {{you will not}} feel lonely long, for I can promise you that before you have been long <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> place you will feel {{like one of the}} family." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Patience, {{patience}} then--you've always me!" [...] said Nick; {{to which}} he subjoined: [...] "If it's a question {{of going to the}} play I scarcely see why you shouldn't dine <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> all the same. People go to the play after dinner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all. It {{describes}} a sensation in your little nose associated with certain finicking notions {{which are the}} classics of Mrs. Lemon's school. Look <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> you don't see her objecting to everything except what she does herself. She is my notion of a pleasant woman." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And how I mocked <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> {{and left}} her in a rage, without ever a kind word between us. And how I have slain I know not how many men in battle, though that, I trust, need not lay heavily on my soul, seeing that I killed them all in fair fight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes—I must 'a dozed, {{for when}} I looked up, it wor black darkness. Missis, I dursn't sit up wi' 'im no more, an' many a one I've laid out. Eh, but his sufferin's, Missis—poor feller—eh, Missis!"—she lifted her ancient hands, {{and looked up}} <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> with her eyes so {{intensely}} blue.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then roll {{me up in}} my cot, {{and launch}} me overboard, in the old way. I have {{sometimes}} {{thought it might be}} well to lie <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> side; but she'll excuse an old tar for preferring blue water to one of your country church-yards." ...|$|R
60|$|On {{reaching}} town I drove {{straight to}} the hotel <b>at</b> which <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> was staying.|$|R
6000|$|... 'In conclusion, Mr Pancks,' said Arthur, 'I {{have but}} to say this. I have reasons beyond a {{personal}} regard for speaking as little as I can of the Dorrit family, particularly <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> house' (Mr Pancks nodded), 'and for knowing as much as I can. So devoted a man of business as you are--eh?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I believe it--and I {{thought to}} mould her to {{something}} better: but, Lucy, {{to speak the}} plain truth, I have felt a new thing to-night, in looking at her and de Hamal. I felt it before noticing the impertinence directed <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> I saw a look interchanged between them immediately after their entrance, which threw a most unwelcome light on my mind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lord-a-mercy! Only {{to think}} on it! Six {{year on a}} little bit o' an island, and not a living soul to speak a word to! And now he's on his way home again. It beats all story-telling I ever heerd on. Why, Alice, lass, it 'a' quite upset you," [...] he added, looking anxiously <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> [...] "You're all white and scared-like. Dost feel badly?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Clara,' he continued, looking <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> 'you {{surprise}} me! You astound me! Yes, I had a {{satisfaction in}} the thought of marrying an inexperienced and artless person, and forming her character, and infusing into it some amount of that firmness and decision of which it stood in need. But when Jane Murdstone is kind enough {{to come to my}} assistance in this endeavour, and to assume, for my sake, a condition something like a housekeeper's, and when she meets with a base return--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{let it be}} our tongue, for I love it best of all, who lisped it <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> knee. Now {{leave me}} here alone awhile; I would think. Also," [...] she added thoughtfully, and {{speaking}} with a strange and impressive inflexion of the voice, [...] "there are some to whom I must give audience." ...|$|R
5000|$|Madeleine is {{an opera}} in one act by Victor Herbert set to a {{libretto}} by Grant Stewart, after the French play Je dîne chez ma mère (Im dining <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>mothers</b> house) by Adrien Decourcelle and Lambert-Thiboust. It premiered at the Metropolitan Opera in New York on 24 January 1914 with Frances Alda {{in the title}} role.|$|R
6000|$|... "O, what wad I gie to be {{ten times}} waur, Jeanie!" [...] was the reply--"what wad I gie to be cauld dead afore the ten o'clock bell the morn! And our father--but I am his bairn nae langer now--O, I hae nae friend {{left in the}} warld!--O, that I were lying dead <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> side, in Newbattle kirkyard!" ...|$|R
60|$|Yes, and again, {{as we walk}} home, I note some {{neighbours}} looking <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> and at me, and whispering. Again, as {{the three}} go on arm-in-arm, and I linger behind alone, I follow some of those looks, and wonder if my mother's step be really not so light as I have seen it, and if the gaiety of her beauty be really almost worried away. Again, I wonder whether any of the neighbours call to mind, as I do, how we used to walk home together, she and I; and I wonder stupidly about that, all the dreary dismal day.|$|E
6000|$|... "Is it? It was {{the thought}} in me, when you spoke. And with good reason, too. I {{was the last}} of a large family--the ugly one; the ill-tempered one; the {{encumbrance}} that made it harder than ever to find money enough to pay the household expenses. My father swore <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> for being my mother. She reviled him just as bitterly in return; and vented the rest of her ill-temper on my wretched little body, with no sparing hand. Bedtime was her time for beating me. Talk of your mother--not of mine! You were very young, were you not, when she died?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Pip," [...] said Joe, {{taking up}} the poker, and {{settling}} himself to his usual occupation when he was thoughtful, of slowly raking the fire between the lower bars; [...] "I'll tell you. My father, Pip, he were given to drink, and when he were overtook with drink, he hammered away <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> most onmerciful. It were a'most the only hammering he did, indeed, 'xcepting at myself. And he hammered {{at me with a}} wigor only to be equalled by the wigor with which he didn't hammer at his anwil.--You're a listening and understanding, Pip?" ...|$|E
5000|$|DeVille {{said about}} their first meeting, [...] "Now here I am at 29, a writer, doing pretty good and I've just been asked if I {{want to write}} songs {{with a guy who}} helped lay the {{foundations}} for the music I fell in love with sitting <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> kitchen table when I was only seven years old. You've got to be kidding!" ...|$|R
60|$|At first, {{the return}} to her native air {{seemed to have a}} {{beneficial}} effect on <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> health. But it was a temporary improvement only. Her constitution had been fatally injured by the West Indian climate, and just as we had engaged a competent person to look after my neglected education, my constant attendance was needed <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> bedside. We loved each other dearly, and we wanted no strange nurses to come between us. <b>My</b> aunt (<b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> sister) relieved me of my cares in the intervals when I wanted rest.|$|R
6000|$|Camp continued: [...] "But {{our friend}} here will shake {{the hand of}} any man, woman, or child that wants to speak to him; and you needn't wipe it on the grass first, either. He's a man! And I {{want to say that}} he's going to spend the next week with us, <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> house, and we shall be glad to have you call." ...|$|R
