TV Line gave Pompeo's performance the most praise, called it [...] "visceral" [...] and wrote, [...] " [...] If a picture really says a thousand words, this review is superfluous: Any image 'we publish of Pompeo’s stricken face from this week’s Grey’s {{will tell you}} <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> about her [...] " [...] Praising McKee the site called [...] the episode a [...] "stunner". The site added, [...] "We long ago gave up predicting what the Emmy Awards will do. But we will still say that, if there’s any justice, Pompeo’s transcendent work ought to get the leading lady at very least the nomination for which she is so long overdue." ...|$|E

2500|$|Anger {{has always}} been an [...] "extremely private individual," [...] {{although}} he has given various interviews over the years, with one interviewer, David Wingrove, describing him in 2008 as [...] "a joy. Gentle, soft-spoken, immaculately tanned, he looks a good two decades younger than his 78 years". In such interviews, he refuses to disclose information on his name change from Anglemeyer to Anger, telling an interviewer who brought the topic up in 2004 that [...] "You're being impertinent. It says Anger on my passport, that's <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> I would stay away from that subject if I were you." [...] In a 2010 interview, however, he stated that [...] "I just condensed my name. I knew it would be like a label, a logo. It's easy to remember." [...] Anger is openly gay, with one of his friends describing how he [...] "was attracted to people who were either well endowed or the Arnold Schwarzenegger type." [...] He once joked that he was [...] "somewhat {{to the right of the}} KKK" [...] in his views about black people, opening him up to criticism for racism. He is a passionate supporter of the Tibetan independence movement.|$|E

2500|$|NME {{noted that}} the album sees Minogue [...] "dropping her {{considerable}} concern for cool and bouncing back to her disco-pop roots", adding that [...] "Light Years is <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> about Kylie {{in less than an}} hour: fun, perfectly-formed, not too taxing and occasionally annoying." [...] Yahoo! Music's Gary Crossing referred to the album as [...] "a polished, well-produced yet largely undemanding collection of disco, Hi-NRG, Ibizan trance, funk, 60s film and TV themes and Latin-flavoured tunes which like the Minogue minx's attire leaves very little to the imagination." [...] He also opined that [...] "ou just get the feeling that if those concerned put as much effort into the songwriting as they did into the glossy album sleeve photo shoot things might have been a whole lot better." [...] Andrew Lynch of entertainment.ie viewed the album as [...] "inconsequential stuff and as with all Kylie's albums the quality is disappointingly uneven. But the best tracks have an engagingly bouncy quality and taken as a whole this is a much better record than most critics would like to admit." [...] Select praised the album, stating that [...] "apart from the foul Lloyd-Webber-esque ballad 'Bittersweet Goodbye', it's an unrelenting hoot" [...] and that [...] "it's all contrived to within an inch of its life, heaving with potential singles and brazenly derivative. That is her job and she does it well." ...|$|E
