5|$|I {{remember}} {{being in the}} back part of the studio, and we were sitting there {{late at night and}} writing. I was strolling through some sounds and came upon a particular sound from a steel acoustic guitar. I played these really beautiful chord changes that eventually led to 'My All.' She started singing and I started playing, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> up with the basis for the song. I put a little drum groove down {{and it was one of}} the easier songs to write with her.|$|E
500|$|Cudi {{commented that}} the way the song was {{recorded}} {{was similar to the}} way prior collaborations between the two were recorded; West will bounce ideas off of other writers and gauge their reaction before going forward with any of his own ideas. In an interview with MTV Cudi commented, [...] "that's always our collab formula, and that's just how 'Gorgeous' came about. He just kind of told me {{what he was trying to}} say, I threw out some words, we rearranged words, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> out with a bunch of different options before we come up with the hook." ...|$|E
500|$|Bleeding Through was an American {{heavy metal}} band from Orange County, California. Formed in 1999, the band blended {{influences}} stemming from modern hardcore punk, symphonic black metal, and melodic death metal. [...] Although {{the band was}} often labeled as simply metalcore, when Brandan Schieppati {{was asked if he}} considered Bleeding Through a hardcore band, he said: [...] "I think we're a hardcore band and I'll never say we are a metal band, we're all hardcore kids <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> from the hardcore scene. Ours is just a different version of hardcore, we're trying to do something which adds a different variety to the hardcore scene, which has been sounding the same way for so long." ...|$|E

500|$|Halifax {{started off}} Game 5 {{at home on}} a low note, with Liam McMorrow {{committing}} four personal fouls {{in the first three}} minutes. Nevertheless, Halifax pulled away with the 125–91 victory, putting them one win away from the title. Rainmen forward Forrest Fisher complained about Windsor, [...] "They're playing very physical, and at times a little bit dirty with sucker punches, and we started playing into their game (Friday) and that's not us. A couple of us can play like that, myself included, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> out tonight and I told them 'hey, let me take the hits, I'm used to that. You guys play your normal game.' We play the way we play, and it doesn't matter how they play." [...] According to The Chronicle Herald, [...] "the game featured several incidents that threatened to escalate into a full-scale brawl." [...] The teams' coaches would frequently have to break up skirmishes and confront officials for what they felt were bad calls.|$|E
500|$|Bowyer {{appeared}} in Victory Lane {{to celebrate his}} first win {{of the season in}} front of 95,000 people who attended the race. Bowyer also earned $248,250 in race winnings. Stewart took his last-minute loss of the race with good humor, saying, [...] "We went down swinging. I think I ran me out of fuel." [...] In the subsequent post-race press conference, Hamlin said, [...] "First thing I asked is how many cars on the lead lap, because I wanted to see how bad our day was going to be. I set a goal (of) top 15, and then it was top eight and then top six and, 'Holy cow, we can win this thing.' We just made a heck of a charge at the end." [...] Bowyer was delighted with his victory: [...] " [...] Shane [...] built a brand new race car <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> here and we were fast right off the truck, and everybody had a lot of confidence, a pep in their step. And we showed it from the time we unloaded to qualifying, practice, we were one of the fastest cars here. That’s what it takes to run at this level, {{to be a part of}} that Chase, if we can go and continue to have as much fun as we did this weekend. I know it’s the key, I know it is to my success." ...|$|E

[...] More than that, Hurwitz says that he enjoys reaching out to [...] "nerdy" [...] younger fans because they can act as role-models to show that their best days are ahead of them: [...] "We're like a little beacon of hope for losers that are told they're gonna be cool in ten years." ...|$|E

2500|$|Speaking of {{the video}} to MTV, Reynolds said [...] "We read through a ton of scripts from really talented directors, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> across one that stood out to us in particular, because it put into visuals the general theme of the song, {{which is kind of}} an {{empowering}} song about an awakening, but it did {{it in a way that}} was very different". [...] "A lot of people probably see a post-apocalyptic world when they hear 'Radioactive', understandably, but we wanted to deliver something that was maybe a little different from that ... a lot different from that." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band {{also stated}} that the choice to work with Dave Eringa again was {{important}} for this album: [...] "We finished work in November and then just went straight into a demo studio <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> out about four weeks later with the album all finished. We were all happy with all the songs, we knew {{what they wanted to}} sound like, so we didn't want to use a mainstream producer because they've got their own sound and vision of what a record should be like. So we just phoned Dave up and said 'Look, come down, let's see how this works out', and everyone loved what we were doing, so we decided to stay with him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stoner {{suffered}} a broken right scapula and a fractured left tibia {{as a result}} of the accident. Stoner commented on the crash, [...] "I didn't have enough time to engage the clutch [...] I picked the bike up to try to slow down but I was heading towards the wall so I decided to lay it over and hit the barrier. Unfortunately the barriers were a lot harder than they looked <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> out of it with broken bones." [...] Honda investigated the bike and discovered that the throttle mechanism had been defective and was stuck open at 26 degrees before the crash. Honda officially apologised to Stoner for the mechanical failure.|$|E

2500|$|The {{developers}} {{originally thought}} the game's target audience would be fairly adult-age. Towers notes: [...] "We {{started out with}} an idea that the users {{are going to be}} fairly old, but then as we sort of made the game we focused it. We realized that lots of different people get fun out of the game in lots of different ways. We tested on young kids, we tested on adults, we tested on a mix of the two, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> to the conclusion that anyone can play this game. We very much wanted the game to be accessible from the start so that you can play alongside your granny or with your kids. We saw people enjoying it from all ages." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{inspiration}} for the album shifted when Maida traveled to Sudan and Darfur to shoot a documentary with War Child {{in the middle of}} recording. [...] "We were there for a couple of weeks, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> back from that and went right back into the studio, and it was like: 'God, this song sucks. I’m not saying that anymore.' You start reflecting on lyrics and any message you’re trying to get out there, and it really altered everything again." [...] The band recorded in six-week spurts, traveling between studios in Toronto, Los Angeles and Maui, recording more songs. With no deadline from the record company, they kept recording and gaining more perspective. [...] "We'd get together, write, record, take two weeks off, go back in and we ended up doing that on and off for the last two-and-a-half or three years," [...] By this time, over forty songs were recorded including [...] "Picture", [...] "Don't Ask Why" [...] (Where Are You), [...] "Holy Ghost" [...] (Angels/Losing/Sleep) and [...] "Vampires", which was briefly considered for the album's title. The sessions became strained at times as the band couldn't figure out where the album was going. [...] "We had so many songs," [...] said Taggart, [...] "and we just started to go crazy." [...] Many songs went through multiple incarnations such as [...] "Boy", which caused the band a lot of stress and took over three weeks to break down and re-record. They were also butting heads with their producer. [...] "There were some fucking horrible sessions," [...] Maida admitted.|$|E
