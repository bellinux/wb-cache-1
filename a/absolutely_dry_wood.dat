40|$|The article {{examines}} the global movement of carbon dioxide, the most important greenhouse gas due to its large quantities. We studied the carbon cycle with possibilities of its extension, and analysed the mechanisms that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and bind it into solid substances {{for a longer period}} of time. The focus was on carbon dioxide sink into biomass and carbon deposit in wood. On the basis of wood component data and chemical analysis of the components, we calculated the share of carbon in wood and the equivalent quantity of carbon dioxide used in the process of photosynthesis for formation of 1. 0 kg of wood matter. It was established that in the process of photosynthesis, approximately 1. 8 kg of carbon dioxide is used on average from the atmosphere to form 1 kg of <b>absolutely</b> <b>dry</b> <b>wood...</b>|$|E

30|$|To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} heating and drying history on the microstructure of <b>dry</b> <b>wood,</b> {{in addition to the}} dynamic viscoelastic properties, CO 2 adsorption onto <b>dry</b> <b>wood</b> at ice.water temperature (273 K) was measured, and the micropore size distribution was obtained using the Horvath-Kawazoe (HK) method. Micropores smaller than 0.6 nm exist in the microstructures of <b>dry</b> <b>wood,</b> and they decreased with elevating out-gassing temperature and increased again after rewetting and <b>drying.</b> <b>Dry</b> <b>wood</b> subjected to higher temperatures showed larger dynamic elastic modulus (E′) and smaller loss modulus (E″). This is interpreted {{as the result of the}} modification at higher temperature of the instability caused by drying. Drying history influenced the number of micropores smaller than 0.6 nm in <b>dry</b> <b>wood</b> not subjected to high temperature, although the difference in the number of micropores resulting from the drying history decreased with increasing out-gassing temperature. A larger number of micropores smaller than 0.6 nm exist in the microstructure of <b>dry</b> <b>wood</b> in more unstable states, corresponding to smaller E′ and larger E″ than in the stable state. Consequently, unstable states are considered to result from the existence of temporary micropores in the microstructures of <b>dry</b> <b>wood,</b> probably in lignin.|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this study, {{vulnerability}} to cavitation, P 50 (i. e. the water potential causing 50 % loss of hydraulic conductivity), of Norway spruce trunkwood at different cambial age {{was related to}} wood density. Wood density was calculated from mass in the oven dry state related either to volume at the oven-dry state (<b>dry</b> <b>wood</b> density) or to volume at full saturation (basic <b>wood</b> density). <b>Dry</b> <b>wood</b> density and basic wood density were strongly linearly related (r² = 0. 99); there was however a shift from the 1 : 1 reference line with increasing <b>dry</b> <b>wood</b> density. <b>Dry</b> <b>wood</b> density as well as basic wood density had similar high predictive qualities for P 50 (r² = 0. 85). The quadratic regression lines took however a quite different course below- 4 MPa because volume shrinkage increased with increasing <b>dry</b> <b>wood</b> density. For Norway spruce sapwood with high <b>dry</b> <b>wood</b> density, mixing up different wood density traits would thus result in a predicted overestimation or underestimation of {{vulnerability to}} cavitation. Gravimetrically wood density measurements at different moisture contents (starting at full saturation) are easily to achieve on standard size specimens and the conversion curves obtained will be of high value for future ecological studies on other species and across species...|$|R

30|$|To obtain new {{information}} about the mechanical and physical properties of <b>dry</b> <b>wood</b> in unstable states, the influence of heating history on viscoelastic properties and dimensional changes of <b>dry</b> <b>wood</b> in the radial, tangential, and longitudinal directions was studied between 100 ° and 200 °C. Unstable states of <b>dry</b> <b>wood</b> still existed after heating at 105 °C for 30 min and were modified by activated molecular motion in the first heating process to temperatures above 105 °C. This phenomenon {{is thought to be}} caused by the unstable states reappearing after wetting and <b>drying</b> again. <b>Dry</b> <b>wood</b> components did not completely approach the stable state in the temperature range tested, because they did not entirely surpass the glass transition temperatures in most of the temperature range. In constant temperature processes at 135 ° and 165 °C, E′ increased and E″ decreased with time regardless of the direction. This indicated that the unstable states of <b>dry</b> <b>wood</b> components were gradually modified with time at constant temperatures. On the other hand, anisotropy of dimensional change existed and dimension increased in the longitudinal direction, was unchanged in the radial direction, and decreased in the tangential direction with time at constant temperatures.|$|R

30|$|To {{investigate}} micropores and mesopores in {{the cell}} walls of <b>dry</b> <b>wood,</b> CO 2 gas and N 2 gas adsorption onto <b>dry</b> <b>wood</b> were measured at ice-water temperature (273 K) and liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K). CO 2 gas adsorption isotherms obtained were used for determining micropore volumes smaller than 0.6 nm by the HK method (Horvath-Kawazoe method), and N 2 gas adsorption isotherms obtained were used for determining the mesopore volume between 2 nm and 50 nm by the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method. Micropores and mesopores existed in cell walls of <b>dry</b> <b>wood,</b> and the cumulative pore volume was much larger for micropores than for mesopores. Micropores {{in the cell}} wall of <b>dry</b> <b>wood</b> decreased with elevating heat treatment temperature, and the decreased micropore was reproducible by wetting and drying. Mesopores did not decrease so much with elevating heat treatment temperature. Micropore volumes for the softwood Hinoki and the hardwood Buna were compared. A larger amount of micropores existed in hardwood Buna than in softwood Hinoki, and this relationship was considered to correspond to the difference in thermal softening properties for lignin in water-swollen Hinoki and Buna. This result probably indicates that micropores in the cell walls of <b>dry</b> <b>wood</b> relate {{to the structure of}} lignin.|$|R

30|$|Enthalpy {{relaxation}} of <b>dry</b> <b>wood</b> {{has been investigated}} by temperature-modulated differential scanning calorimetry. The reversing and non-reversing heat flow changes revealed that enthalpy relaxation occurred in <b>dry</b> <b>wood,</b> which did not exhibit any clear glass transitions. This enthalpy relaxation behavior seemed to differ significantly from those of previously reported isolated lignins, which implies that the microstructure of <b>dry</b> <b>wood</b> possesses a rigid amorphous state derived from interactions among wood components.

40|$|Abstract. Submerged woody habitat {{provides}} the major structure around which ecological processes operate in many lowland rivers. Colonisation by macroinvertebrates {{was measured in}} a south-eastern Australian river over a 32 -day period in an experiment testing the hypothesis that wood type influences the invertebrate assemblage structure. The wood types were green <b>wood,</b> <b>dry</b> <b>wood,</b> and <b>dry</b> but previously waterlogged wood. All wood used was river red gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis). Macroinvertebrates colonised previously waterlogged wood more rapidly than green or <b>dry</b> <b>wood.</b> The assemblage structure varied significantly over the sampling period, with copepods and cladocerans numerically dominating the assemblage {{during the first few}} days after the introduction of the wood. The assemblage became more diverse through time and was numerically dominated by dipterans, ephemeropterans and trichopterans. The results indicate that there was little difference in the time taken for macroinvertebrate colonisation after wood introduction when using either green or <b>dry</b> <b>wood.</b> This has implications for large-scale restoration projects, where green wood {{is likely to be a}} more readily available option for reintroduction than <b>dry</b> <b>wood...</b>|$|R

Terpenes were clearly the main compound group in the air-dried wood samples, whereas acetic acid was only detected in the high-temperature-dried wood samples, indicating that considerable changes occurred in the volatile compound emission profile during hightemperature processing. The most abundant compounds in the air-dried <b>wood</b> and conventionally <b>dried</b> <b>wood</b> were δ-cadinene, α-muurolene, and β-cadinene (sesquiterpenes) for all specimens, and a-pinene and D-limonene (monoterpenes) for conventionally <b>dried</b> <b>wood</b> and air-dried wood. In contrast, acetic acid was detected only in the hightemperature-dried wood. Sensory evaluation of volatile organic compounds was performed by 18 male university students.
