40|$|KPMG is a {{multinational}} firm, which {{is focused on}} three pillars: tax advisory, accountancy and advisory. The <b>advisory</b> <b>section,</b> in particular the IT Advisory, required {{a system that is}} able to analyze, process and visualize captured network traffic. This network traffic is gathered from the own company or their clients. The goal of this project is to design and develop a "Security Information and Event Management System (SEAMS) " that manages Network Intrusion Detection services and provides a report specifying the condition of the analyzed network. In order to manage the different Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) their results need to be merged. Every IDS produces a different result based on their focus. To gain the most valuable information of the network traffic, one has to merge all IDS’s results. The major challenge in developing such a SEAM System is that the system should be able to process an enormous amount of data. This data is roughly between 2 - 10 TB. The stakeholder required the system to be built in a modular way. This leads to both maintainability and adaptability of the system since the customer accounts for the extension of the product. During the research the development team acquired a large amount of knowledge about network traffic. In addition to this knowledge, they gained understanding and expertise in the used IDSs. By gathering this knowledge, the product got molded into a useful, extendable and efficient Dokterservice for the client. The process, {{for the development of the}} Dokterservice, was set up by means of the Scrum methodology. A change of requirements is a pristine reason to apply the scrum methodology, as development tasks are flexibly generated. Hence during the development process, any (un) expected changes could easily be adapted to the product and into Scrum. The dokterservice that is created is able to read, process, merge and visualize the data gathered from the network traffic. Continously throughout the development, the product got tested on captured malicious network traffic, which varied tremendously in size. Furthermore, the product got tested by means of unit tests and continous integration. This ensured the team that the developed components work as they should. In addition to the aforementioned ways of testing, we also had continuous interaction with our stakeholders and organized demo’s for possible future end-users. The future outlook of the Dokterservice is very prosperous. KPMG plans on applying the Dokterservice for future network analysis. We also have provided some future work recommendations which are included in our final report. Department of Intelligent SystemsElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|E
40|$|OrgPlan is a {{computer}} package designed to support farmers and consultants in planning a conversion to organic farming. It consists of two main elements: the basic planning module and a database with data for organic, in-conversion and conventional data. It was developed with DEFRA funding (OF 0159) by a partnership between the University of Wales, Aberystwyth, the University of Hertfordshire, Elm Farm Research Centre and SAC. The objective of this work was to obtain feedback before its general release on the suitability of OrgPlan in supporting the process of planning a conversion to organic farming. Given the risks of the organic conversion process and the sensitive nature of the financial reports that OrgPlan can generate, further testing with consultants experienced in organic conversion planning was carried out. The work was broken down in four objectives. Independent of this, OrgPlan {{has been used by}} the contractor in the context of research work, in particular the Modelling of Strategies of Organic Milk Production (OF 0146). Objective 1 : Update of standard data The contractor updated the OrgPlan database with data from the 2002 / 03 Organic Farm Management Handbook and other sources. Objective 2 : Workshops and Field testing of the software Three workshops with a total 22 consultants were held during which they were given a basic introduction to the use of OrgPlan and had a first opportunity to use the software on their own computer or appropriate workstations. OrgPlan can effectively support several aspects of a first broad brush planning of an organic conversion (rotation planning, cropping and livestock enterprises, feasibility of a proposed organic scenario in terms of financial output, nutrient and forage budgets) and can assist with more detailed financial planning of investments, leading to Profit and Loss and Cash-Flow forecasts. OrgPlan could have a wider application in whole farm planning, but this would require extending the database to cover a wider range of enterprises common on conventional farms. Key strengths identified by the consultants (not in order of importance) • Financial planning • Availability of basic enterprise data set • Rotation planning and nutrient budgets • Combination of financial and nutrient data in one package • Create different scenarios giving instant access for reassessment of options • Possibility to ‘tweak' a scenario • Library, navigation around the collection is excellent • Help topics clear and straightforward • Broad brush planning, particularly for farms planning new enterprises Key weaknesses (not in order of importance) • Limited range of enterprises in the database, particularly for horticultural crops • Problems with set-up, use of database and understanding all functions • Need for regular updates of the dataset • P and K Fertilisers routinely included in organic enterprises • Data entry in some sections is long-winded Objective 3 : Essential corrections to the software and update of <b>advisory</b> <b>section</b> • A list of problems and suggestions was compiled. All essential changes will be implemented before a release of the software. Other suggestions, which entail more complicated programming work, are included in a as ideas for future development of OrgPlan.

40|$|This is {{the final}} report for Defra Project OF 0159. The Organic Conversion Planner (OrgPlan) is a {{computer}} program for farmers and advisors reducing the time input necessary for planning a conversion to organic farming. Conversion planning can help to identify whether organic management is suited to the farm and potential problems during the conversion period itself. This involves {{an assessment of the}} current situation of the farm, based on which proposals for an organic 'target (endpoint) ' can be developed. This includes proposed rotation(s), cropping and stocking plan for the specific farm situation and the proposals need to be tested for their technical and financial feasibility, including impact on forage supply, nutrient requirements and financial budgets. In a final step a more detailed strategy for getting from the current situation to the target situation needs to be worked out. On the basis of such a plan a farmers can make an informed choice about the feasibility of a conversion and planning can help {{to reduce the risk of}} conversion. General whole farm planning methods can be broadly split into budgeting and optimisation methods. The former uses input and output data from existing enterprises or standard data, whereas the latter uses mathematical models to determine the optimal choice of enterprises for a maximisation of a key indicator, e. g. profit. OrgPlan uses the budgeting approach, building on experience with mainly German speaking budgeting software for organic conversion. It overcomes a number of key limitations of spreadsheet based budgeting approaches in relation to access to standard enterprise data, additional support tools (e. g. rotation planner) and ease of use. The software is structured into three major sections: In Central Resources basic standard data and farm profiles are entered, viewed and adjusted, and rotations can be planned. Access is also provided to the <b>advisory</b> <b>section,</b> containing documents about organic production standards, organic managmenet notes and a software help file. It is also possible to access these from other sections of the software. In the Scenario Planning section new files for a scenario are created, where a scenario refers to a period of several years of a farm during conversion and/or under organic management. Cropping and livestock plans are generated and a first assessment of the scenario of key farm mangement indicators, nutrients and forage budgets is provided. After adding whole farm financial data the results are transferred into the Report Builder where profit and loss and cash-flow forecasts for the scenario can be generated. Reports can be viewed on screen, printed (HTML format) or exported for further analysis in other packages (spreadsheets). A key aim in developing the software was to reduce the time input needed for conversion planning. The software is windows based and follows the layout of the EMA software (developed by UH). It was programmed in Microsoft (MS) Visual Basic, using MS Access databases for the storage of data. It used results of several DEFRA funded research projects and has relevance to the Organic Conversion Information Service (OCIS). A series of nine basic steps are needed to use the software to plan conversion. These are: viewing and modifying standard enterprise data, viewing and modifying rotations, creating a farm profile, creating and planning a conversion scenario, getting first feedback on the scenario, adding whole farm financial data, planning new investment during the scenario period and viewing and printing reports and/or export data for further analysis in other packages. The basic planning tool has been released as part of the EMA 2002 software (EMA Plan). Because of the sensitive nature of the financial calculations that are the main feature of OrgPlan, further field testing of the programme in conjunction with the Organic Standard Data Collection is envisaged in the autumn of 2002 for with experienced Organic Farming Consultants...|$|E

This toolbox was reviewed by EPA and state primacy agencies. Every effort was made to ensure that the toolbox complies with the Public Notification Rule when necessary. More than 500 documents, protocols, regulations, and other resources related to the issuing of drinking water advisories were compiled. Nearly 100 interviews were conducted with water systems, primacy agencies, and local public health departments in the United States and Canada. These findings revealed: Advice to the public varies widely from state to state and community to community; Advisories are a common occurrence in some states and a rare event in others; Major events or disasters were the primary reasons for collaboration between drinking water systems and health departments; Terminology for advisories is inconsistent; Templates and advisory content are difficult to change or adapt to specific audiences or needs; The EPA Public Notification Handbook is the primary information source for drinking water advisories; Agency responsibilities for communicating with institutions, such as hospitals, schools, and restaurants, are highly variable; Good relationships between water systems and local public health departments are often dependent on established relationships between individuals; Local health departments may lack the resources or expertise to address drinking water issues; Local health departments are willing to be consulted by water systems when requested.

40|$|Current {{storage and}} {{retrieval}} of {{air traffic management}} data by the FAA allows for sufficient control of aircraft flows in the National Airspace System. However, these storage methods allow neither for deep historical analysis nor for use of advanced, standards-compliant tools. Another shortcoming of these storage methods is that air traffic management data are not readily accessible by all interested parties. The contributions of this paper are {{a new approach to}} describing, storing, and serving air traffic management data, and its software implementation. This approach is compliant with relevant published standards and, therefore, is easily incorporated into current and future systems. We fully develop a schema for describing reroute advisories, implement a database based upon that schema, then implement an example tool that can use this new system to provide information in a way not possible in the current system. This schema is an extension of the Aeronautical Information Exchange Model and allows for geometric queries to databases based upon the model. The example tool uses this feature by requesting previously implemented reroutes that do not intersect a supplied region of interest. The results enable a traffic manager to base a new reroute on past decisions of all traffic managers, which is not an approach used today. In today’s operations, the sharing of past decisions between traffic managers given similar situations is not a formal process. The disconnect between what various managers might implement leaves room for inefficiencies in the system and helps motivate this study.
