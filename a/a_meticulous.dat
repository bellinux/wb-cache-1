5|$|Evans used a woodblock {{printing}} technique known as chromoxylography, {{which was used}} primarily for inexpensive serialised books and children's books requiring few colours, so as to maximize profits. However, chromoxylography allowed a variety of hues and tones to be produced by mixing colours. The process was complicated and required intricate engraving to achieve the best results. Evans possessed <b>a</b> <b>meticulous</b> eye for detail and used a hand-press {{and as many as}} a dozen colour blocks for a single image. He {{went on to become the}} preeminent wood engraver and colour printer in Britain during the second half of the 19th century.|$|E

40|$|The present article articulates a {{functional}} {{perspective on the}} author as a central category in literary historiography. Taking as its starting point the common practices in Dutch literary historiography the paradoxes surrounding the authorial function [...] even in so-called postmodern histories [...] are analyzed. Authors remain a central dimension of literature and hence of its scholarly study, although the ‘death of the author’ has been claimed time and again. The present article does not plead for a further death or, alternately, a clear resurrection of the author. Rather it argues for <b>an</b> <b>meticulous</b> analysis of the authorial category as a crucial discursive category, which can be both analyzed and thematized in a Foucaldian way. A number of topics in relation to this discursivefunctionalist approach to literature are presented...|$|R

3000|$|... 70 % of the {{patients}} in group A (85 %, n.s.) had undergone surgery for the primary tumor and the regional lymph node regions.

The dental treatment procedures were performed {{as early as possible}} with a minimal time interval of 7 - 10 days from the last procedure to the beginning of radiotherapy. All dental extractions were performed according to a written protocol under “special care” (primary tissue closure, perioperative antibiotics for 7 - 10 days beginning one day before surgery). In the nineties all patients were advised not to wear their dental prostheses up to 6 - 12 months after radiotherapy (today until complete healing of mucositis) (Curi and Dib 1997; Reuther et al. 2003). Radiotherapy was started after complete healing of the gingival wounds and thus approval by the OMF surgeon.|$|R

Couturat's reading {{of this paper was}} the launching point for much 20th-century thinking about Leibniz, especially among analytic philosophers. But after <b>a</b> <b>meticulous</b> study of all of Leibniz's philosophical writings up to 1688—a study the 1999 additions to the critical edition made possible—Mercer (2001) begged to differ with Couturat's reading; the jury is still out.|$|E

Thanks to Sassetti's patronage, there is a portrait of the man himself, with his employer, Lorenzo il Magnifico, and Lorenzo's three sons with their tutor, the Humanist poet and philosopher, Agnolo Poliziano. In the Tornabuoni Chapel is another portrait of Poliziano, accompanied by the other influential members of the Platonic Academy including Marsilio Ficino.|$|E
