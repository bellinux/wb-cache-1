5|$|A {{short time}} later, Luke escapes again by using string to shake a bush and {{distract}} the guards, visiting a nearby {{house where he}} uses an axe to remove his shackles. To keep the guard dogs from following his scent, he spreads curry powder and chili powder across the ground to send them into sneezing fits and overload their sensitive sense of smell. While free, Luke mails Dragline a magazine that includes a photograph of him with two beautiful women. He is soon recaptured, beaten, returned to the prison camp, and fitted with two sets of leg irons. Luke is warned by the Captain that if he ever attempts to escape again, he will be killed on the spot. Luke is now annoyed by the other prisoners fawning over the magazine photo and reveals {{it to be a}} fake. At first, the other prisoners <b>are</b> <b>angry,</b> but after a long stay in the box, when Luke is forced to eat a huge serving of rice, they come to help him finish it.|$|E
5|$|Veronica waits with Keith at an {{election}} party, where tensions are high {{due to the}} election being extremely close. Sheriff Lamb (Michael Muhney) is nosing ahead before a man walks up to Lamb and says that he made the anonymous call from the bridge where Felix Toombs was stabbed. Keith loses the election {{by a margin of}} 51% to 49%. After we learn that Woody Goodman (Steve Guttenberg) has been elected mayor, Dick Casablancas (Ryan Hansen) hits on Gia Goodman (Krysten Ritter). Officers come in and arrest Logan for the murder of Felix Toombs before Veronica goes home and finds Abel Koontz, who is in the latter stages of stomach cancer. He asks her to help him find his daughter, Amelia, who has disappeared, and Veronica agrees. Veronica talks to Amelia's old boyfriend, who has not seen her for a while; Amelia ditched the boyfriend in Europe. Cliff McCormack (Daran Norris) is appointed to be Logan's lawyer before Veronica asks Cliff to call the numbers on the phone cards that Amelia stole under an alias. Cliff tells Logan that he should get a different lawyer. Veronica finds out that Amelia called from Neptune (Veronica's town) the previous week. Logan is placed in a cell with his father, Aaron (Harry Hamlin), who is temporarily being held there before his trial for the murder of Lilly Kane. Logan receives bail, but Weevil and his friends <b>are</b> <b>angry</b> about this fact. Veronica breaks into Clarence Wiedman's (Christopher B. Duncan) office, but he denies any knowledge of the situation.|$|E

For her pre-Games interview, Katniss wears a wedding dress, as ordered by Snow, but her stylist Cinna rigs it to transform into a representation of a mockingjay. Peeta announces on-air that he and Katniss secretly married and are expecting a baby, and the audience of Capitol citizens shouts for the Games to be stopped, to no avail. Just before Katniss enters the arena, Cinna is severely beaten and dragged away by Peacekeepers, as Katniss watches helplessly.|$|E

25|$|Kierski's {{research}} {{claimed that}} men do acknowledge that male fear of the feminine can have a strong influence on both hetero- and homosexual men. The research has also indicated that {{there appears to be}} a link between fear of the feminine and men's negative views about counseling and psychotherapy. In addition, this research has identified four possible groups of experiences that lead to male fear of the feminine, which relate to internal and external triggers. These are: Experiencing vulnerability and uncertainty; women who are strong and competent; women who <b>are</b> <b>angry</b> or aggressive; women who are like their mothers.|$|E
25|$|In Hindu Epic the Mahabharata, she as Umā {{suggests}} that the duties of wife and mother are as follows - being of a good disposition, endued with sweet speech, sweet conduct, and sweet features. Her husband is her friend, refuge, and god. She finds happiness in physical, emotional nourishment and development {{of her husband and}} her children. Their happiness is her happiness. She is positive and cheerful even when her husband or her children <b>are</b> <b>angry,</b> she's with them in adversity or sickness. She takes interest in worldly affairs, beyond her husband and family. She is cheerful and humble before family, friends, and relatives; helps them if she can. She welcomes guests, feeds them and encourages righteous social life. Her family life and her home is her heaven, Parvati declares in Book 13 of the Mahabharata.|$|E
25|$|About corrupting Athenian youth, Socrates {{explained}} that the young, rich men {{of the city of}} Athens {{have little to do with}} their time. They therefore follow him about the city, observing his questioning of intellectual arguments in dialogue with other intellectual men. In turn, the young men imitate the method of Socrates. Moreover, the embarrassed men, whose arguments Socrates examined and found wanting, do not know how to avoid the ridicule of exposure as pretenders to wisdom. To not lose face, the beardless lads re-state the prejudicial, stock accusations against Socrates, that he is a morally abominable man who corrupts the youth of Athens with sophistry and atheism. In his defence, Socrates said, “For those who are examined, instead of being angry with themselves, <b>are</b> <b>angry</b> with me!” Hence is Socrates considered a wise man, yet has acquired a bad reputation among the politically powerful personages of Athens.|$|E

25|$|Finally, {{anger in}} {{infidelity}} is quite inevitable. In the initial stage of infidelity anger {{is not as}} apparent as it is seen in stage two, because there is not hard facts or evidence supporting one’s suspicions. Like previously talked about the accuser most likely feels jealous and incompetent {{in the first stage}} of cheating. These emotions can contract into anger and provide a cognitive state of anger, because the accusing person anticipates his or her anger. Unlike jealousy and resentment, it is hard to identify the purpose or cause of the individual’s anger because in reality there is nothing yet to be angry about, there is no proof of their romantic partner’s unfaithfulness. 25% of people surveyed felt angry in the beginning or suspicion stage of infidelity (Johnson, 2017). It is hard to pinpoint the anger emotion in the initial stages due to ambiguity; therefore, it begins to take on other emotions turning into a cognitive state of emotional turmoil. The individual knows they <b>are</b> <b>angry</b> and anticipates it, but cannot logically explain it to their partner {{because of the lack of}} evidence they have.|$|E

Devdutt Pattanaik says: [...] "The cult of the Seven Mothers is found all over India. ... Pregnant women and nursing mothers worship them. When these goddesses <b>are</b> <b>angry,</b> they make women barren and strike newborns with fatal fevers. When they are appeased, they ensure the health and happiness of children."

Skírnir declares to the hrimthursar, thursar, the sons of Suttungr, and the [...] "troops of the Æsir" [...] that he has denied both pleasure and benefit from men to Gerðr. Skírnir details that the thurs's name who will own her below the gates of Nágrind is Hrímgrímnir and that there, at the roots of the world, the finest thing Gerðr will be given to drink is the urine of goats. He carves [...] "thurs" [...] (the runic character *thurisaz) on Gerðr and three runes (unnamed) symbolizing lewdness, frenzy, and unbearable desire, and comments that he can rub them off just as he has carved them—if he wishes.|$|E

500|$|Although the [...] "SlumDunder Mifflinaire" [...] skit and {{the scenes}} {{in which it was}} {{prepared}} were all scripted, Carell and Ryan improvised several of the moments including Michael's [...] "Yay!" [...] cheer upon getting an answer right, the bow Carell and Ryan take at the end while the Buffalo branch employees <b>are</b> <b>angry,</b> and Michael's Indian accent. Carell improvised with several different accents on the set, with the producers settling on the one that sounded most like the character from the film, although he used his regular accent when answering the final question in the skit. Carell and Ryan also made up the Jaws song parody ("Dunder...Dunder...") while filming, and Carell made up the subsequent line [...] "We're circling it" [...] about their good sketch idea. The extras were told not to laugh or react at all to the [...] "SlumDunder Mifflinaire" [...] sketch, but Carell and Ryan were not told of those instructions {{in order to create a}} genuine stage fright awkwardness among the two actors; Ryan in particular was thrown off guard by their lack of response.|$|E
500|$|SFScope {{contributor}} Sarah Stegall liked Frank's final conversation concerning Fauxlivia's pregnancy, {{praising the}} plot twist's potential to [...] "make for some interesting drama, perhaps even allowing {{the show to}} get past the inevitable mawkishness of most pregnancy stories." [...] However, there was some negative fan feedback concerning the pregnancy storyline. In reaction to this, Jeff Pinkner commented, [...] "Our interpretation of it is that people desperately want to see Olivia and Peter together. And that Fauxlivia having a baby makes Olivia’s life that much harder and people <b>are</b> <b>angry</b> because of that. Anything that makes Olivia’s life harder, people seem to be angry at. Olivia is a hero, she will conquer all. She’ll deal." [...] After [...] "Immortality" [...] aired, Joshua Jackson expressed sympathy for fans of the Olivia-Peter relationship, commenting that they [...] "have been taken for quite a ride.

500|$|... "The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerBalls" [...] portrays young {{children}} as almost entirely uninterested in reading. The South Park boys only exhibit excitement for their reading assignment {{based on the}} promise of offensive and controversial material in the book. Rather than finding any merit in the book, the boys <b>are</b> <b>angry</b> when they find the material inoffensive, prompting Cartman to declare he has been [...] "tricked" [...] into reading an entire book. Through {{the rise and fall of}} Butters' career as an author, the episode also demonstrates the perils of literary success and hoaxes. The episode also lampoons the notion that a book can be identified as the sole reason for a reader to kill somebody, particularly through Butters' reaction to The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs. Butters experiences blackouts after reading The Catcher in the Rye and chanting [...] "Kill John Lennon/Ronald Reagan!", until he disappointedly learns they are already dead. Later, a reader of Butters' book The Poop That Took a Pee goes out and murders the Kardashians.|$|E

500|$|In a Malay folk tale, {{the mouse}} deer Sang Kancil wants {{to cross a}} river to reach the fruit trees on the far side, but Sang Buaya, a crocodile, is waiting in the river to eat him. Sang Kancil asks all the {{crocodiles}} to line up across the river so he can count them for the king, and makes them promise not to eat him as he counts. He then steps on their heads one by one, calling out [...] "One! Two! Three!" [...] as he goes. When he reaches the far side, he thanks them for helping him cross the river, and feasts on fruit. Sang Buaya does not fare as well, since the other crocodiles <b>are</b> <b>angry</b> with him for letting Sang Kancil trick them. A legend from East Timor tells how a boy rescues a gigantic crocodile that becomes stranded. In return, the crocodile protects him {{for the rest of}} its life, and when it dies, its scaly ridged back becomes the hills of Timor. One Australian Dreamtime story tells of a crocodile ancestor who had fire all to himself. One day, a [...] "rainbow bird" [...] stole fire-sticks from the crocodile and gave it to man. Hence the crocodile lives in water.|$|E
500|$|Kathleen Richter of Ms. {{believed}} that Friendship Is Magic {{did little to}} {{change the nature of}} older animations for girls, which she considered [...] "so sexist and racist and heteronormative." [...] For example, she suggested that, through the character of Rainbow Dash, the show was promoting the stereotype that [...] "all feminists <b>are</b> <b>angry,</b> tomboyish lesbians." [...] She also considered that the only darker-colored ponies shown to date were in positions of servitude towards the [...] "white pony overlord." [...] Lauren Faust responded to these claims by stating that while Rainbow Dash was a tomboy, [...] "nowhere in the show is her sexual orientation ever referenced" [...] and [...] "assuming [...] are lesbians is extremely unfair to both straight and lesbian tomboys", and further stating that [...] "Color has never, ever been depicted as a race indicator for the ponies." [...] Amid Amidi, writing for the animation website Cartoon Brew, was more critical of the concept of the show, calling it a sign of [...] "the end of the creator-driven era in TV animation". Amidi's essay expressed concern that assigning a talent like Faust to a toy-centric show was part of a trend towards a focus on profitable genres of animation, such as toy tie-ins, to deal with a fragmented viewing audience, and overall [...] "an admission of defeat for the entire movement, a white flag-waving moment for the TV animation industry." ...|$|E
500|$|Straw {{described}} Nick Griffin as a [...] "fantasising conspiracy theorist {{with some}} very unpleasant views and no moral compass. But {{now that he has}} been exposed for what he is it is time to move on." [...] Warsi said Griffin was [...] "...very much exposed for the man that he is. When he was questioned on his views his face of extremism was exposed. He was given an opportunity to explain some of his policies and he couldn't". Huhne said, [...] "This is a person who comes from a fascist background; anyone who watches the programme will see exactly what he stands for." [...] Greer said Griffin had been [...] "totally trounced" [...] on the show, and that sitting next to Griffin had been [...] "probably the weirdest and most creepy experience of my life". Nevertheless, Griffin perceived that he had [...] "struck up a rapport" [...] with Greer, who treated him differently from the other panellists. Greer avoided looking in Griffin's direction throughout, and indeed turned her back on him pointedly. Speaking to the Associated Press, Griffin stated that his appearance had secured the BNP's place on the national stage, and while not revolutionary, was like gaining a kind of [...] "Boy Scout's badge". He was relatively pleased with having [...] "been able to land a few punches of my own". Later, Griffin declared: [...] "Millions of people <b>are</b> <b>angry</b> about the way I was treated."
