5|$|When the Tests {{started at}} Trent Bridge, Davidson was {{named in the}} playing XI. He {{supported}} the pace attack of Miller, Lindwall and Johnston in the five Tests. His debut in the First Test was unremarkable. As with most of Australia's batsmen, Davidson struggled against Alec Bedser, who broke the English Test wicket-taking record in the wet conditions, making only four and six. He took 2/22 in the first innings as the match ended in a rain affected draw. His first Test wicket was that of Hutton, caught by Benaud, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>added</b> Evans {{in the latter part}} of the innings.|$|E
5|$|Harmon {{thought that}} Far Cry 4 was an {{improvement}} over Far Cry 3, but {{he thought that the}} game felt and played too similarly to Far Cry 3, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>added</b> that the game was unambitious. Bertz thought that Ubisoft Montreal's vision for Far Cry 4 is not as bold as its predecessors, and also thought that the experience delivered by Far Cry 4 did not stray far away from Far Cry 3. Tan also noted that the game's open world design felt not only similar to Far Cry 3, but also other Ubisoft franchises like Assassin's Creed and Watch Dogs. Evans-Thirlwell thought that the experience offered by Far Cry 4 was hollow as it had failed to innovate or reinvent its wheel. Dyer thought that the game was not ambitious, but the experience delivered was still gratifying and rewarding.|$|E
5|$|Kentucky {{played a}} much-anticipated game versus Kansas on December 16, 1950, with Spivey matched up against Jayhawks center Clyde Lovellette. The Wildcats won by 29 points as Spivey outplayed Lovellette, {{in what he}} later called the best {{performance}} of his college career. After one steal, he drove to the Kansas basket and did a slam dunk; this was rare for Kentucky basketball at the time, as Rupp instructed players not to dunk during games. Spivey set another school record in a February 13, 1951, game, gathering 31rebounds. As of 2010, he remains tied for the team record with Bob Burrow, who had {{the same number of}} rebounds in a 1955 game. For the season, Spivey again averaged more than 19points per game, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>added</b> 17.2rebounds per game. His point total led the SEC, and his 479regular season points were the third-most in league history at the time.|$|E

5|$|On {{the third}} morning, Bradman added only eight before falling for 138 when he leg glanced an inswinger from Bedser to Hutton at short fine leg. Johnson and Tallon came and went, failing to pass 21. The scoring was slow during this passage of play—Young {{delivered}} 11 consecutive maiden overs. Lindwall {{came out to}} bat at 365/7 <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>added</b> 107 runs with Hassett for the eighth wicket. Hassett reached his century and proceeded to 137 in almost six hours of batting. Both fell in quick succession, but Australia's last-wicket pair of Johnston and Toshack wagged a further 33 runs in only 18 minutes before Bedser ended the innings on 509, leaving the tourists with a 344-run lead. Yardley placed {{the majority of the}} bowling load on his spinners, with Young (1/79) and Laker (4/138) bowling 60 and 55 overs respectively. Bedser bowled 44.2 overs, taking 3/113.|$|E
5|$|Scholars have {{discussed}} Not in Front of the Children in academic journal articles, and characterized it {{as a work}} which balances education policy against {{the negative consequences of}} censorship. In an article for Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy, Middlebury College women's studies professor Deborah Grant compared the book to Harmful to Minors by Judith Levine. Grant characterized both books as significant works emphasizing the importance of allowing youths access to informative educational resources. She classed Heins' monograph as a thorough and important survey of the chronology of censorship. Perry L. Glanzer wrote in English Journal that Heins had a valid viewpoint to engage students on controversial topics in literature classes, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>added</b> it was necessary to teach them all perspectives of a debate. Ellen P. Goodman wrote for Berkeley Technology Law Journal that Heins was critical of prior articles which attempted to show negative impact from violence as portrayed on television programs.|$|E
5|$|On {{the third}} morning, Bradman resumed on 130, before {{progressing}} to 132 and {{becoming the first}} player to pass 1,000 runs for the English season. His innings was soon terminated at 138 when he leg glanced an inswinger from Bedser to Hutton at short fine leg. Bradman had batted for 290 minutes and Johnson replaced him with Australia at 305/5. Johnson made 21 before being bowled by Laker, and Tallon took 39 minutes to compile 10 before hitting a return catch to the left arm orthodox spin of Young. The scoring was slow during this passage of play—Young delivered 11 consecutive maiden overs and his 26-over spell conceded only 14 runs. Lindwall came out to bat at 365/7 without a runner <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>added</b> 107 runs with Hassett for the eighth wicket. Hassett reached his century and proceeded to 137 in almost six hours of batting, striking 20 fours and a six. The partnership was terminated when Bedser struck Hassett's off stump. Lindwall was caught by Evans down the leg side four runs later, but Australia's last-wicket pair of Johnston and Toshack wagged a further 33 runs in only 18 minutes before Bedser trapped Toshack lbw to end the innings on 509, leaving the tourists with a 344-run lead. Australia had batted for 216.2 overs, the longest innings in terms of overs and the highest total in the series. Yardley placed the majority of the bowling load on his spinners, with Young (1/79) and Laker (4/138) bowling 60 and 55 overs respectively. Bedser bowled 44.2 overs, taking 3/113.|$|E

5|$|Lockett {{entered his}} senior season as a preseason All-Big 12 {{selection}} {{as well as a}} Walter Camp Award, Maxwell Award, Paul Hornung Award, and Biletnikoff Award watchlist candidate. On September 25, he was named one of 62 FBS semifinalists for the William V. Campbell Trophy. He posted his first 100-yard game of the season against Iowa State on September 6, in Kansas State's second game when he tallied 136 receiving yards on 6 receptions. On September 18, he was named one of 30 candidates for the Senior CLASS Award. On September 27, Lockett posted two 50-plus-yard punt returns including a 58-yard touchdown against UTEP. On September 29, Lockett earned his sixth career Big 12 player of the week recognition when he was named Big 12 Special Teams Player of the Week. The following week, he posted 12 receptions for 125 yards and 2 touchdowns against Texas Tech on October 4, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>added</b> 103 yards on 8 receptions against Texas on October 25. On October 30, he earned an $18,000 postgraduate scholarship as one of 16 finalists for the Campbell Trophy. On November 8, he posted 196 yards and a touchdown on 11 receptions against the number 6 ranked TCU. The effort boosted Lockett's career receiving yardage total to 3,073 yards, surpassing his father's school record total of 3,032 set in 1996. Then, he was named as one of 10 finalists for the Senior CLASS Award and one of 10 semi-finalists for the Biletnikoff Award. On November 20, he was recognized as a first team Academic All-Big 12 honoree. Lockett had 10 receptions for 196 yards and a 43-yard punt return touchdown against West Virginia on November 20 and 9 receptions for 119 yards and 2 touchdowns against Kansas on November 29. In the Kansas–Kansas State rivalry game, Lockett passed his father's school record for receptions and tied his school record for touchdown receptions. In his final regular season game against #5 Baylor, Lockett posted 14 receptions for 158 yards and a touchdown, which gave him 27 career touchdown receptions and broke a tie with his father for the school record. With just a bowl game remaining, Lockett's career total of 3,546 receiving yards ranked 6th in Big 12 Conference history. He added 13 receptions for 164 receiving yards and 2 touchdowns against UCLA in the January 2, 2015 Alamo Bowl. In the game Lockett had a 41-yard punt return and had a 72-yard punt return touchdown negated due to a holding penalty. He established Alamo Bowl records for receptions (13) and all-purpose yards (249). He was recognized as the game's Sportsmanship MVP.|$|E

25|$|Kent, as expected, beat Glamorgan, {{but were}} worried on occasion. Having been shaken early on as Glamorgan dug out four early wickets, Kent were lifted by a 267-run {{partnership}} between Darren Stevens (who made 208) and Andrew Hall (133) which helped them {{along the way}} to a final first-innings score of 587, with Min Patel taking 55 balls for a 64 from number nine. Six Glamorgan players were then out in single figures, Amjad Khan taking three for 68, but number three David Hemp stood tall with an unbeaten 171. Glamorgan were 188 for 9 at one point on day two, but survived to stumps to 236 for 9, and just kept going - their number 11, Huw Waters, made 34 from 192 balls, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>added</b> 118 with Hemp, for the second-highest stand of the match.|$|E
25|$|As {{soon as he}} {{returned}} to Australia he was selected to play in an Australian XI, consisting mostly of Test aspirants, including Archie Jackson and Don Bradman, against the touring English team. He took four wickets, including Douglas Jardine twice.

In five matches for New South Wales he took 10 wickets at 50.60. He was also captain of North Sydney, where he encouraged Bill O'Reilly. When the state selectors left O'Reilly out of the New South Wales team at one stage during 1931–32, Bettington declared himself unavailable, leaving the selectors with little choice but to restore O'Reilly. O'Reilly bowled so well subsequently that he was included in the Test side against South Africa later in the season.|$|E

25|$|Faced {{with another}} state side the MCC were again in trouble, this time under Colin Cowdrey's captaincy. John Snow was rested after {{damaging}} his toes in Melbourne and a stiff and sore Alan Ward strained a calf muscle during the game. In a rain affected match the New South Wales captain and wicket-keeper Brian Taber won the toss {{and decided to}} bat. They were 82/3 when Doug Walters came in and made 201 not out, adding 132 with Geoff Davies (57) and 145 with Kerry O'Keeffe (55 not out) before Taber declared at 410/5. Geoff Boycott (36) and Brian Luckhurst (42) added 54 for the first wicket and the MCC passed 100 with one wicket down. The leg-spinner O'Keeffe showed his all-round skills by taking 6/69 and they collapsed to 204 all out and were forced to follow on 206 runs behind. This kind of situation that brought {{out the best in}} Geoff Boycott (129 not out) <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>added</b> 228 for the first wicket with Brian Luckhurst (135) and 97 for the second with Keith Fletcher (51 not out) to ensure a draw.|$|E
25|$|The next {{tour for}} O'Brien was the 2007 World Cup in the Caribbean {{and it would}} be his biggest test yet as 6 of his 7 One Day International games prior had been against non Test playing nations. Their opening game against Zimbabwe {{finished}} in a tie when Zimbabwe collapsed in the dying stages. O'Brien came on to bowl in the 49th over with Zimbabwe requiring 9 runs from 12 balls and 3 wickets in hand. His first ball was a full toss but Zimbabwean captain Prosper Utseya hit it straight to Eoin Morgan at cover to give him his first World Cup wicket. Chris Mpofu was run out off O'Brien's final delivery and he finished the penultimate over with a wicket maiden. Ireland came up against Pakistan in the next game and they restricted the Test nation to just 132 with O'Brien taking the wicket of Shoaib Malik. O'Brien came in to bat with his side at 70/4 <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>added</b> 38 runs with his brother Niall. Ireland eventually won by 3 wickets and O'Brien finished unbeaten on 16 from 52 balls. His highest score of the tournament came in the Super Eight stage against New Zealand where he made 49, hitting 3 sixes. He missed out on his half century when he was run out by his brother. Arguably his best performance of the World Cup was his fast 48 runs scored against Bangladesh which helped secure a historic Irish victory.|$|E
25|$|Strauss and Trott built a {{partnership}} of 118 before the England captain edged to Michael Clarke at first slip {{just before the}} lunch break on day three. With the final ball of the morning session, Prior drove a ball from North to the off side and hit Ricky Ponting at silly point square in the jaw. The Australian captain, looked nonplussed, simply spat out some blood. After lunch, Prior was run out while attempting to sneak a run, despite hitting the ball straight to Katich, who threw down the stumps at the bowler's end. The next man in was Andrew Flintoff, playing in his final Test innings, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>added</b> 22 off 18 before being caught on the long-on boundary. A lofted straight drive from England's most promising all-round prospect, Stuart Broad, brought up the 400 lead, but an attempted slog found his top edge and he was caught by Ponting off North for 29. Meanwhile, Trott progressed towards his maiden Test century, ably supported by Graeme Swann, who reached his half-century in just 44 balls. However, the England spinner was eventually caught behind, top-edging a pull shot off a bouncer from Hilfenhaus. Trott then became the 18th England cricketer to make a century on debut with a four off Hilfenhaus's next over, but he and Anderson only managed to add another 31 before Trott was caught by North at point off Stuart Clark, prompting a declaration from Andrew Strauss. England's score of 373/9 declared meant {{that in order to}} win the match Australia would need to make 546 runs in just over two days on a pitch that had not yet produced more than 400 {{over the course of the}} match. England, on the other hand, needed only to take 10 Australian wickets. The Australian openers managed to get to 80 without loss by the end of play.|$|E
