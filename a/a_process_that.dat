5|$|A year later, Mechnikov {{studied a}} fresh water {{crustacean}} called Daphnia, a tiny transparent animal {{that can be}} examined directly under a microscope. He discovered that fungal spores that attacked the animal were destroyed by phagocytes. He went on to extend his observations to the white blood cells of mammals and discovered that the bacterium Bacillus anthracis could be engulfed and killed by phagocytes, <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>that</b> he called phagocytosis. Mechnikov proposed that phagocytes were a primary defense against invading organisms.|$|E

5|$|Anticonvulsants {{suppress}} epileptic seizures, {{but they}} neither cure nor prevent {{the development of}} seizure susceptibility. The development of epilepsy (epileptogenesis) is <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>that</b> is poorly understood. A few anticonvulsants (valproate, levetiracetam and benzodiazepines) have shown antiepileptogenic properties in animal models of epileptogenesis. However, no anticonvulsant has ever achieved this in a clinical trial in humans. The ketogenic diet {{has been found to}} have antiepileptogenic properties in rats.|$|E
5|$|Archaea {{usually have}} a single {{circular}} chromosome, {{with as many as}} 5,751,492base pairs in Methanosarcina acetivorans, the largest known archaeal genome. The tiny 490,885base-pair genome of Nanoarchaeum equitans is one-tenth of this size and the smallest archaeal genome known; it is estimated to contain only 537 protein-encoding genes. Smaller independent pieces of DNA, called plasmids, are also found in archaea. Plasmids may be transferred between cells by physical contact, in <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>that</b> may be similar to bacterial conjugation.|$|E
5|$|Argon {{constitutes}} 0.934% {{by volume}} and 1.288% by {{mass of the}} Earth's atmosphere, and air is the primary industrial source of purified argon products. Argon is isolated from air by fractionation, most commonly by cryogenic fractional distillation, <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>that</b> also produces purified nitrogen, oxygen, neon, krypton and xenon. The Earth's crust and seawater contain 1.2 ppm and 0.45 ppm of argon, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Argon is {{produced}} industrially by the fractional distillation of liquid {{air in a}} cryogenic air separation unit; <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>that</b> separates liquid nitrogen, which boils at 77.3K, from argon, which boils at 87.3K, and liquid oxygen, which boils at 90.2K. About 700,000 tonnes of argon are produced worldwide every year.|$|E
5|$|Before 1907, all {{magnitude}} {{measurements for}} stars were obtained through visual comparison of relative brightness, <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>that</b> {{was slow and}} inexact. Later photographic methods would use starlight to make a representation on a photographic plate. Regardless, neither method was adequate for quantitative measurements. The drawback of previous methods of measuring stellar magnitude made the use of electricity for empirically gathering astronomical data revolutionary for the science of astronomy.

5|$|Chewing lice {{live among}} the hairs or {{feathers}} of their host and feed on skin and debris, while sucking lice pierce the host's skin and feed on blood and other secretions.

The eggs hatch into nymphs, which moult three times before becoming fully grown, <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>that</b> takes about four weeks.|$|E
