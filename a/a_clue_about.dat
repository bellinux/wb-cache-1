The East London BNP activist Eddy Butler noted that at a 1986 party rally in Dewsbury, Tyndall [...] "lost them completely.

That is why Goldhagen is not simply against Pope Pius XII: he is an inveterate anti-Catholic bigot." [...] Moreover, Rabbi Dalin accused Goldhagen of engaging in a [...] "misuse of the Holocaust to advance ... anti-Catholic agenda".|$|E
500|$|Watson's {{performance}} {{was characterized by}} some quirks. In one instance, Watson repeated a reworded version of an incorrect response offered by Jennings.

Because Watson could not recognize other contestants' responses, it did not know that Jennings had already given the same response.

[...] to <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> <b>about</b> George Eyser (the correct response was, [...] "What is: he's missing a leg?"). Because Watson, unlike a human, could not have been responding to Jennings's mistake, it was decided that this response was incorrect. The broadcast version of the episode was edited to omit Trebek's original acceptance of Watson's response. Watson also demonstrated complex wagering strategies on the Daily Doubles, with one bet at $6,435 and another at $1,246. Gerald Tesauro, one of the IBM researchers who worked on Watson, explained that Watson's wagers were based on its confidence level for the category and a complex regression model called the Game State Evaluator.|$|E

He attested to a vast untapped fanbase for football in Milton Keynes—a [...] "football frenzy waiting to happen", he said. Critics of this claim pointed to the apparent lack of public interest in Milton Keynes City and the other local non-League clubs, and argued that Milton Keynes residents interested specifically in League football already had ample access with Luton, Northampton and Rushden & Diamonds all within [...] In Winkelman's own words, in a 2013 interview, he [...] "didn't have <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> <b>about</b> football" [...] when he was proposing to move a League club from another town—indeed looking back he said [...] "it was that naivety that enabled me to go and do it." [...] He was the only person in Milton Keynes publicly associated with the project; his financial supporters, later revealed to be Asda (a subsidiary of Walmart) and IKEA, were kept strictly anonymous. According to an investigative report by Ian Pollock, published in When Saturday Comes in July 2002, neither the Milton Keynes Council press office, the editor of the Milton Keynes Citizen newspaper nor the head of Invest in MK, the council agency encouraging businesses to move to the area, could tell him who was backing the plans.

500|$|Several {{publications}} for manga, anime, {{and other}} pop culture media have provided both praise and criticism on Edward's character.

[...] Additionally, Melissa Harper from Anime News Network praises Edward's facial expressions {{as some of the}} most humorous highlights of the series, including also the moments in which he reacts quite violently to comments about his small stature. They also praise him for not being a stereotypical shōnen character as it is noted that he has [...] "very real skills, relationships, and personality". Samuel Arbogast from T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews also comments that the interaction between the Elric brothers as they travel is interesting, and praises their humor scenes as they help to balance the dark parts of the series. Similarly, Mania Entertainment's Jarred Pine liked the dynamic between the Elrics brothers as while Edward is often faced with following [...] "dark paths" [...] {{in the same way as}} villains with the series, he is always supported by Alphonse who makes sure he is okay. Judge Joel Pearce from DVD Verdict commented on Edward's journey, considering it very complex morally because he is trying to do good within a morally questionable organization. Lydia Hojnacki listed Ed as one of the reasons she likes Fullmetal Alchemist, noting the progression of the character's personality throughout the series, from simple maturity to a deeper sensitivity. The character was noted to go through a notable development in the manga after meeting his father by Holly Ellingwood from Active Anime as it made him decide to see the investigate from the human he and Alphonse created as children which led him to find <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> <b>about</b> how to recover his brother's body. On the other hand, Maria Lin from Animefringe criticized Edward's development in the first animated adaptation of Fullmetal Alchemist, as in the series' finale he once again attempted to resurrect a human.

Springsteen shows at the Capital Centre outside of Washington, D.C. thus attracted even more media attention, in particular from CBS Evening News correspondent Bernard Goldberg, who saw Springsteen as a modern-day Horatio Alger story.

He is no whiner, and the recitation of closed factories and other problems always seems punctuated by a grand, cheerful affirmation: 'Born in the U.S.A.!'" [...] The 1984 presidential campaign was in full stride at the time, and Will had connections to President Ronald Reagan's re-election organization. Will thought that Springsteen might endorse Reagan (not knowing that Springsteen did not support Reagan), and got the notion pushed up to high-level Reagan advisor Michael Deaver's office.
