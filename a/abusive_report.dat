40|$|We {{examine the}} {{relation}} between client tax aggressiveness and auditor‟s resignation decision. Consistent with the agency view of tax avoidance which suggests that client tax aggressiveness can increase litigation and reputational risk to auditors and increase the potential conflict with managers, we find a positive association between our proxies for tax aggressiveness and the likelihood that an auditor resigns from an audit engagement. Further, this association is stronger when external monitoring of the client firm is less effective, when there is greater potential for agency problems in the client firm, and when the economic importance of the fees received from the client firm is lower. Overall, our study identifies client tax risk as an important determinant of auditors‟ resignation.

30|$|Another {{reason to}} stay in an <b>abusive</b> {{relationship}} <b>reported</b> by some women was the primacy of their family institution. For these women, family was a {{part and parcel of}} their lives and they didn’t want to break up their families. The women knew that the damage caused by divorce would not be restricted to their personal life; the damage could be so pervasive and overwhelming that it could extend to the women’s parents and even to their siblings. The data revealed that the women wanted to avoid confrontation with their husbands. As a part of their socialization, most of them preferred to “wait for a better time”. In order to preserve their family honor, they wanted to avoid bickering and “kept it all inside the belly”. Women also know that their relatives and community will not encourage them if they air private family affairs in public. Another reason to remain in an abusive marriage was economic dependency on the husband.|$|R

50|$|Even when {{childhood}} {{events are}} not remembered episodically, {{they can be}} implicitly remembered. Humans can be primed and implicitly trained earlier before they can remember facts or autobiographical events. This is most {{important in terms of}} emotional trauma. Adults can generally recall events from 3-4 years old, and have primarily experiential memories beginning around 4.7 years old. However, some suggest that adults who had traumatic and <b>abusive</b> early childhoods <b>report</b> an offset of childhood amnesia around 5-7 years old. It has been suggested that this is because stressful experiences can injure memory centers and possibly make it harder to form memories. This coupled with the fact that priming can occur at a younger age may indicate that children in abusive situations have implicit memory connections that were formed in response to the abuse. Whether or not these 'repressed' memories can affect individuals is a matter of considerable debate in psychology.|$|R

ParticipantsA total of 282 women who reported intimate partner violence and reached {{out for the first}} time to a shelter or district attorney's office for assistance. MethodsThis 7 -year prospective longitudinal study began in 2011. Participants in the overarching study are being interviewed every 4  months. During the 32 -month interview period, participants responded to a one-time, investigator-developed, fertility control questionnaire in addition to the ongoing repeated measures. ResultsAlmost one third (29 %) of the participants reported at least one unintended pregnancy attributed to their abusers' refusal to use birth control, and 14. 3 % of the participants reported at least one unintended pregnancy as a result of their abusers' refusal to allow them to use birth control. Participants were 28 times more likely to have abuse-induced miscarriages if their pregnancies resulted because their abusers did not use birth control (OR = 28. 70, p < . 05).

40|$|This study {{compared}} retrospective {{reports of}} childhood sexual and physical abuse as assessed by two measures: the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), {{which uses a}} Likert-type scaling approach, and the Computer Assisted Maltreatment Inventory (CAMI), which employs a behaviorally specific means of assessment. Participants included 1, 195 undergraduate students recruited from three geographically diverse universities. Agreement was high across the two measures in the classification of victim status (92 % and 80 % for sexual and physical abuse, respectively). However, the CTQ classified more participants as sexually abused than did the CAMI, whereas the opposite trend was found for physical abuse. For child physical abuse, many participants <b>reporting</b> <b>abusive</b> acts on the CAMI scored below the cut-point for physical abuse on the CTQ. Classifi cation differences for both types of abuse were largely unrelated to demographic factors, socially desirable responding, or self-reported withholding of information.

Of the entire study sample (N = 720), 29 % of the physicians reported having experienced an abusive event in the last month by a patient or patient family member. Abusive incidents were classified as minor, major, or severe. Of the physician participants who reported having been abused, all reported having experienced a minor event, 26 % a major, and 8 % a severe event.

The present study brings these disparate literatures together and tests whether resilience moderates the influence of abusive supervision on the mental health of Maori employees. Maori as a population register significantly higher levels of anxiety and depression compared to the majority of the population. Using a sample of 261 random Maori employees, we tested the influence of abusive supervision and resilience towards anxiety and depression outcomes. The survey design included separating the predictor variables from outcome variables by a month. Results showed that respondents reported low levels of abusive supervision (M= 1. 8) and high levels of resilience (M= 4. 2). Regression analysis showed that abusive supervision accounted for sizeable amounts of variance, while resilience was more modest. While no significant interaction effect was found towards anxiety, there was towards depression, with respondents with high resilience buffering the influence of high <b>abusive</b> supervision, ultimately <b>reporting</b> significantly lower levels of depression than respondents with low resilience.

The present study was designed to address this deficiency by assessing the prevalence of different types of abuse, the situations in which they occur, how women have coped, and the effect of abusive encounters on general health and wellbeing. Using self-report questionnaires, data were obtained from 1, 159 women aged 48 to 53, previously recruited in the Women 2 ̆ 7 s Health Australia longitudinal project. Measures included descriptors of the abuse and help-seeking behaviours, and measures of general wellbeing and depression.

These overwhelmingly occurred in the home, and across all life stages, but mostly in adulthood on an occasional or weekly basis. Perpetrators were usually persons known to the victim. Most abusive encounters were not recent but, when experienced, had persisted over time and had negatively affected mental and physical health.
