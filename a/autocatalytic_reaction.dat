50|$|Oxalate, the {{conjugate}} base of oxalic acid, {{is an excellent}} ligand for metal ions. It usually binds as a bidentate ligand forming a 5-membered MO2C2 ring. An illustrative complex is potassium ferrioxalate, K3Fe(C2O4)3. The drug oxaliplatin exhibits improved water solubility relative to older platinum-based drugs, avoiding the dose-limiting side-effect of nephrotoxicity. Oxalic acid and oxalates can be oxidized by permanganate in an <b>autocatalytic</b> <b>reaction.</b> One of the main applications of oxalic acid is a rust-removal, which arises because oxalate forms water-soluble derivatives with the ferric ion.|$|E

40|$|Biological {{cells with}} all of their surface {{structure}} and complex interior stripped away are essentially vesicles - membranes composed of lipid bilayers which form closed sacs. Vesicles {{are thought to be}} relevant as models of primitive protocells, and they could have provided the ideal environment for pre-biotic reactions to occur. In this paper, we investigate the stochastic dynamics of a set of <b>autocatalytic</b> <b>reactions,</b> within a spatially bounded domain, so as to mimic a primordial cell. The discreteness of the constituents of the <b>autocatalytic</b> <b>reactions</b> gives rise to large sustained oscillations, even when the number of constituents is quite large. These oscillations are spatio-temporal in nature, unlike those found in previous studies, which consisted only of temporal oscillations. We speculate that these oscillations may have a role in seeding membrane instabilities which lead to vesicle division. In this way synchronization could be achieved between protocell growth and the reproduction rate of the constituents (the protogenetic material) in simple protocells. Comment: Submitted to Phys.

50|$|In pre-biotic chemistry, autocatalytic systems play a {{significant}} rule in understanding the origin of chirality in life. An <b>autocatalytic</b> <b>reaction,</b> a reaction in which the product acts {{as a catalyst for}} itself, serves as a model for homochirality. The asymmetric Soai reaction is commonly referred to as chemical plausibility for this pre-biotic hypothesis. In this system, an asymmetric amplification is observed during the process of autocatalytic catalysis. Professor Donna Blackmond has studied the NLE of this reaction extensively using Kagan's ML2 model. From this mathematical analysis, Blackmond was able to conclude that a dimeric, homochiral complex was the active catalyst in promoting homochirality for the Soai reaction.|$|E
50|$|Nonlinear effects {{describe}} the non-ideal relationship between enantiomeric excess (ee) of products of a reaction and the ee of the catalyst, a phenomenon first observed by Henri Kagan. Kagan developed mathematical models {{to describe this}} non-ideal behavior, MLn models. Blackmond has performed studies {{that have led to}} an understanding of reaction rate and its relationship to catalyst ee. Many proposed mathematical models have been tested in the Blackmond lab, which have helped determine possible mechanistic features of reactions, including the Soai reaction. The Soai reaction is of abiotic synthetic interest because it is an <b>autocatalytic</b> <b>reaction,</b> which rapidly produces a large amount of enantiopure products. Blackmond was the first to use Kagan's ML2 model to study the non-linear effects of this reaction. She was the first to conclude that a homochiral dimer was the active catalyst in promoting homochirality for the Soai reaction.|$|E
