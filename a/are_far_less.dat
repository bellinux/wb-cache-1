5|$|Craters of the Moon Campground has 51 sites– none {{of which}} can be {{reserved}} in advance. Camping facilities are basic but do include water, restrooms, charcoal grills, and trash containers. National Park Service rangers present evening programs at the campground amphitheater in the summer. Camping enables visitors to enjoy the park during the evening and morning, when the heat, glare and wind <b>are</b> <b>far</b> <b>less.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many critics {{compared}} Nuka-World to {{a previous}} expansion pack for Fallout 4 named Far Harbor. Dan Stapleton (IGN) {{said that when}} compared to Far Harbor, the role-playing elements <b>are</b> <b>far</b> <b>less</b> developed, though he also said Nuka-World has a nice setting filled with surprises and battles. Nicholas Tan (Game Revolution) also believed {{it was one of}} the better expansion packs, albeit not having such an in-depth a story-line as Far Harbor. Paul Tassi (Forbes) preferred Far Harbor due to this expansion being light on story.|$|E
5|$|Great Britains {{builders}} recognised {{a number}} of advantages of iron over the traditional wooden hull. Wood was becoming more expensive, while iron was getting cheaper. Iron hulls were not subject to dry rot or woodworm, and they were also lighter in weight and less bulky. The chief advantage of the iron hull was its much greater structural strength. The practical limit {{on the length of}} a wooden-hulled ship is about 300feet, after which hogging—the flexing of the hull as waves pass beneath it—becomes too great. Iron hulls <b>are</b> <b>far</b> <b>less</b> subject to hogging, so that the potential size of an iron-hulled ship is much greater. The ship's designers, led by Brunel, were initially cautious in the adaptation of their plans to iron hulled-technology. With each successive draft however, the ship grew ever larger and bolder in conception. By the fifth draft, the vessel had grown to 3,400tons, over 1,000tons larger than any ship then in existence.|$|E

5|$|Poliomyelitis {{is highly}} {{contagious}} via the fecal-oral (intestinal source) and the oral-oral (oropharyngeal source) routes. In endemic areas, wild polioviruses can infect {{virtually the entire}} human population. It is seasonal in temperate climates, with peak transmission occurring in summer and autumn. These seasonal differences <b>are</b> <b>far</b> <b>less</b> pronounced in tropical areas. The time between first exposure and first symptoms, known as the incubation period, is usually 6 to 20days, with a maximum range of 3 to 35days. Virus particles are excreted in the feces for several weeks following initial infection. The disease is transmitted primarily via the fecal-oral route, by ingesting contaminated food or water. It is occasionally transmitted via the oral-oral route, a mode especially visible in areas with good sanitation and hygiene. Polio is most infectious between 7 and 10 days {{before and after the}} appearance of symptoms, but transmission is possible as long as the virus remains in the saliva or feces.|$|E
5|$|The {{tendency}} to create larger caliber cannon during the World Wars has been reversed {{in more recent}} years. The United States Army, for example, sought a lighter, more versatile howitzer, to replace their aging pieces. As it could be towed, the M198 was selected to be the successor to the World War II-era cannon used at the time, and entered service in 1979. Still in use today, the M198 is, in turn, being slowly replaced by the M777 Ultralightweight howitzer, which weighs nearly half as much, and can be transported by helicopter—as opposed to the M198, which requires a C-5 or C-17 to airlift. Although land-based artillery such as the M198 are powerful, long-ranged, and accurate, naval guns have not been neglected, despite being much smaller than in the past, and, in some cases, having been replaced by cruise missiles. However, the 's planned armament includes the Advanced Gun System (AGS), a pair of 155mm guns, which fire the Long Range Land-Attack Projectile. The warhead, which weighs , has a circular error of probability of , and will be mounted on a rocket, to increase the effective range to —a longer range {{than that of the}} Paris Gun. The AGS's barrels will be water cooled, and will be capable of firing 10 rounds per minute, per gun. The combined firepower from both turrets will give Zumwalt-class destroyers the firepower equivalent to 18 conventional M-198 howitzers. The reason for the re-integration of cannon as a main armament in United States Navy ships is because satellite-guided munitions fired from a gun <b>are</b> <b>far</b> <b>less</b> expensive than a cruise missile, and are therefore a better alternative to many combat situations.|$|E

25|$|Spacecraft {{propulsion}} systems are often first statically tested on Earth's surface, within the atmosphere but many systems require a vacuum chamber to test fully.

25|$|While a few mares may be {{somewhat}} more distractible or irritable when in heat, they <b>are</b> <b>far</b> <b>less</b> easily distracted than a stallion at any time.

They would be suitable for relatively small flows or less complex acid mine drainage.|$|E
