5|$|Diamond-bearing rock {{is carried}} from the mantle to the Earth's surface by deep-origin {{volcanic}} eruptions. The magma {{for such a}} volcano must originate at a depth where diamonds can be formed— or more (three times or more the depth of source magma for most volcanoes). This is a relatively rare occurrence. These typically small surface volcanic craters extend downward in formations known as volcanic pipes. The pipes contain material that was transported toward the surface by volcanic action, but was not ejected before the volcanic activity ceased. During eruption these pipes {{are open to the}} surface, resulting in open circulation; many xenoliths of surface rock and even wood and fossils are found in volcanic pipes. Diamond-bearing volcanic pipes are closely related to the oldest, coolest regions of continental crust (cratons). This is because cratons are very thick, and their lithospheric mantle extends to great enough depth that diamonds are stable. Not all pipes contain diamonds, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>fewer</b> contain enough diamonds to make mining economically viable.|$|E
5|$|In 1870, few Brazilians opposed slavery <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>fewer</b> openly {{condemned}} it. PedroII, {{who did not}} own slaves, {{was one of the}} few who did oppose slavery. Its abolition was {{a delicate}} subject. Slaves were used by everyone, from the richest to the poorest. PedroII wanted to end the practice gradually to soften the impact to the national economy. With no constitutional authority to directly intervene to abolish slavery, the Emperor would need to use all his skills to convince, influence and gather support among politicians to achieve his goal. His first open move occurred back in 1850, when he threatened to abdicate unless the General Assembly declared the Atlantic slave trade illegal.|$|E

25|$|Today, kimono {{are most}} often worn by women, {{particularly}} on special occasions. Traditionally, unmarried women wore a style of kimono called furisode, with almost floor-length sleeves, on special occasions. A few older women <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>fewer</b> men still wear the kimono on a daily basis. Men wear the kimono most often at weddings, tea ceremonies, and other very special or very formal occasions. Professional sumo wrestlers are often seen in the kimono because {{they are required to}} wear traditional Japanese dress whenever appearing in public.|$|E
25|$|Totem poles are {{typically}} {{not well maintained}} after their installation and the potlatch celebration. The poles usually last from 60 to 80 years; only a few have stood longer than 75 years, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>fewer</b> have reached 100 years of age. Once the wood rots so badly that the pole begins to lean and {{pose a threat to}} passersby, it is either destroyed or pushed over and removed. Older poles typically fall over during the winter storms that batter the coast. The owners of a collapsed pole may commission a new one to replace it.|$|E

25|$|In 1892 the Free Church, {{following}} {{the example of}} the United Presbyterian Church and the Church of Scotland, and with union with those denominations as the goal, passed a Declaratory Act relaxing the standard of subscription to the confession. This had the result that a small number of congregations <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>fewer</b> ministers, mostly in the Highlands, severed their connection with the church and formed the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland. Others with similar theological views waited for imminent union but chose to continue with the Free Church.|$|E
25|$|Up to the 1880s {{prostitution}} in Alberta was tolerated and {{not considered}} serious. As the itinerant population became more settled, however, this attitude gradually changed. The years 1880-1909 witnessed few arrests <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>fewer</b> fines for prostitution, {{in part because}} those caught were encouraged to leave town rather than be jailed. Later, 1909–14, a smallpox epidemic in the red light district started a crackdown against prostitution, which by then {{was regarded as a}} major problem, especially by middle class women reformers. The Woman's Christian Temperance Union vigorously opposed both saloons and prostitution, and called for woman suffrage as a tool to end those evils.|$|E

25|$|An academy-style {{institution}} {{during the}} Antebellum period, the university emphasized the classics {{and the social}} and natural sciences. There were around 100 students per year at UA in the 1830s. However, as Alabama was a frontier state and a sizable amount of its territory {{was still in the}} hands of various Native American tribes until the 1840s, it lacked the infrastructure to adequately prepare students for the rigors of university education. Consequently, only a fraction of students who enrolled in the early years remained enrolled for long <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>fewer</b> graduated. Those who did graduate, however, often had distinguished careers in Alabama and national politics. Early graduates included Benjamin F. Porter and Alexander Meek.|$|E
25|$|Chinese given names (名字, míngzi) show {{much greater}} {{diversity}} than the surnames, while still being restricted almost universally {{to one or}} two syllables. Including variant forms, there are at least 106,000 individual Chinese characters, but as of 2006, in the People's Republic of China Public Security Bureau only approximately 32,000 are supported for computer input <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>fewer</b> are in common use. Given names are chosen based on a range of factors, including possession of pleasing sound and tonal qualities, as well as bearing positive associations or a beautiful shape. Two-character ming may be chosen for each character's separate meaning and qualities, but the name remains a single unit which is almost always said together even when the combination no longer 'means' anything.|$|E
25|$|A news {{commentator}} {{writing for}} The Lancet, Andrew Meldrum, said that President Mugabe’s Youth Militia threatened health professionals that provided medical treatment to political opponents. He said that, combined with decreasing education standards, low pay, and {{a shortage of}} medical supplies like latex gloves, this led doctors to leave Zimbabwe at an alarming rate. According to Douglas Gwatidzo, {{the chairman of the}} Zimbabwe Doctors for Human Rights group, Zimbabwe had only one doctor assigned to a group of 12,000 citizens. Doctors in Zimbabwe fill only 25% of the medical posts available, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>fewer</b> specialist positions are taken. According to Meldrum, this poses serious challenges to health care for diseases like HIV/AIDS and cholera. Similarly, the effects of cholera are exacerbated without proper nutrition, and Zimbabwe has faced food shortages for the last several years.|$|E

25|$|The road {{continues}} straight {{north as}} 700 East through Millcreek Township, then, north of 3900 South, as {{the border between}} Millcreek Township and South Salt Lake (it never fully enters South Salt Lake). It intersects SR-171 (3300 South) right after crossing Mill Creek, then passes Nibley Golf Course before entering Salt Lake City. Throughout this area (and continuing {{as far north as}} Liberty Park in Salt Lake City), the road was widened to four or more vehicle lanes in each direction by acquisition (using eminent domain) and flattening of a large amount of property on the west side; as a result few structures (<b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>fewer</b> old buildings) front onto {{the west side of the}} street, whereas the east side has many remaining old houses and even old street light poles.|$|E
25|$|Bedouin {{women face}} {{many of the}} same {{problems}} in terms of accessing health care as do Bedouin men in the Negev. To begin with, infrastructure in Bedouin towns is often underdeveloped or non-existent. In addition to restricting access to health care, this has the potential to create its own health problems, especially in the unrecognized villages. For example, in many unrecognized townships, the absence of a waste disposal system means that trash is deposited into a large, open-air pit. This can cause a myriad of health problems stemming from improper sanitation. Moreover, Bedouins often face both a cultural and a language barrier when seeking medical attention. A relative dearth of Arabic-speaking doctors (<b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>fewer</b> Arabic-speaking specialists) means that medical attention is often given in Hebrew. Not all Negev Bedouin speak Hebrew, and those that do speak it as a second language. This is especially problematic for those requiring more specialized or intensive care, which often requires strict adherence to certain guidelines. When those guidelines are not fully understood, further health complications can arise. Finally, there are simply not enough doctors to fully serve the needs of the Bedouin population. In the seven recognized Bedouin towns in the Negev, there are a total of seven private pharmacies and 27 family health clinics operated by the Ministry of Health. In 2009, the total population of these towns was near 120,000.|$|E
