25|$|Meanwhile Valdobrev {{attended}} the High School for Foreign Languages in Stara Zagora. For a Communist country behind the Iron Curtain which Bulgaria {{was at that}} time, this school was like <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> – with a discipline not so strict and teachers being lenient and having a personal approach {{to each of the}} students. They soon noticed Valdobrev's wandering mind and lack of concentration in class and created a system which tried to help him study the English language better. They gave him constant tasks to listen to and write down lyrics of new songs, perform them with his guitar in the lessons and translate the words for his classmates. These everyday concerts were the real productive education for him and later, when he was traveling over the Black Sea resorts and Germany as a street musician, he already had a set-list of 300 prepared and well-rehearsed world hit songs of any genre.|$|E

He concluded that [...] "'Omen' is <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> in the rather stale and stuffy room that black metal finds itself resting." [...] Scott Waters of HM wrote that [...] "the musicianship is beyond reproach. To simply play that fast and accurate, even for four-minute spurts, requires more than just talent.

[...] The columnist also enjoyed Naomi's feud with her mother, as it led to some strong scenes between the two women. However, they criticised Naomi's attempts to seduce Toadie, believing that it was not well executed and for a character [...] "designed to be a husband-stealing minx" [...] her pursuit was [...] "tepid at best".

He is credited on the lyric sheet as [...] "Jimmy". Months after finishing the initial recording sessions for Vitalogy, Abbruzzese was fired in August 1994 due to personality conflicts with the band members. Gossard said, [...] "It was the nature of how the politics worked in our band: It was up to me to say, 'Hey, we tried, it's not working; time to move on.' On a superficial level, it was a political struggle: For whatever reason his ability to communicate with Ed and Jeff was very stifled. I certainly don't think it was all Dave Abbruzzese's fault that it was stifled."

[...] Nick Levine of Digital Spy compared it to Robert Palmer's [...] "Addicted to Love", writing that [...] "it confirms what is rapidly becoming a universal truth: Gwen Stefani is far more likeable when she channels her new wave roots than when she tries to mould herself into a ghetto fabulous urban hipshaker." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine praised Kanal's production for making the song [...] "less forced and much less self-conscious." [...] Quentin B. Huff of PopMatters {{referred to it as}} one of the [...] "few real compositions" [...] from the album.

500|$|Many reviewers {{commented on}} the album's lyrical content. Gilbert Rodman of Popular Communications states, [...] "Eminem's music {{contains}} more than {{its fair share of}} misogynistic and homo-phobic lyrics, but simply to reduce it to these (as many critics do) doesn't help to explain Eminem. It merely invokes a platitude or a sound bite to explain him away." [...] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone enjoyed the record's comedic nature, writing [...] "Simply put: Eminem will crack you up", but also felt that the misogynistic lyrics grow tiresome, noting that [...] "the wife-killing jokes of [...] "97 Bonnie and Clyde' aren't any funnier than Garth Brooks', and 'My Fault' belongs on some sorry-ass Bloodhound Gang record." [...] Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club felt that although the album is [...] "sophomoric and uninspired" [...] at times, Eminem's [...] "surreal, ultraviolent, trailer-trash/post-gangsta-rap extremism is at least <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> in a rap world that's despairingly low on new ideas." [...] Mike Rubin of Spin noted that [...] "his scenarios are so far-fetched the songs almost never sound as ugly as they actually are." [...] Chris Dafoe of The Globe and Mail opined that [...] "Abused by fellow students and teachers, cheated on by his girlfriend, despised by society, Shady goes over the top now and then - or rather way over the top - but Dre's lean production, full of strange voice and comic interjections, hold things together." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{stoppage}} time penalty from Shane Long {{earned a}} crucial 2–1 win for Reading in Argyle's next match, but {{they came from}} a goal behind to claim a 3–1 victory at Barnsley four days later, which included a 35-yard effort from former Barnsley player Fallon. Paul Mariner was full of praise for his team and singled out youngster Yannick Bolasie, who made his debut for the club. [...] "We played with intellect. We got the ball down, rather than panicking a little bit; we stroked it around; we retained position at vital times," [...] he said. [...] "The introduction of Bolasie was <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>air.</b> I think even the Barnsley fans would probably say they liked {{to see what he}} was doing. He brought a lot to the table for us." [...] A double-header of home matches were next on the agenda for Argyle, against Swansea City and Leicester City, and they both ended in 1–1 draws. New signing Damien Johnson scored late on against Swansea, and Craig Noone scored his first goal of the season to earn a point against Leicester. An end-to-end game at Bramall Lane against Sheffield United ended in a 4–3 defeat, which included a number of defensive mistakes. Argyle went 3–0 before finally sparking into life, scoring twice thanks to Bolasie and a first for young Irish striker Joe Mason. A lapse in concentration from David Stockdale, on loan from Fulham, gifted the hosts a fourth goal before a 20-yard volley from Mackie set up a frantic finale.
