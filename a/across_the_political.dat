5|$|Another {{large group}} of victims was {{composed}} of German and foreign civilian activists <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> spectrum who opposed the Nazi regime, captured resistance fighters (many of whom were executed during—or immediately after—their interrogation, particularly in occupied Poland and France) and, sometimes, their families. German political prisoners were a substantial proportion of the first inmates at Dachau (the prototypical Nazi concentration camp). The political People's Court was notorious {{for the number of}} its death sentences.|$|E
5|$|Harriet Tubman, {{widely known}} and well-respected {{while she was}} alive, became an American icon {{in the years after}} she died. A survey {{at the end of the}} 20th century named her as one of the most famous civilians in American history before the Civil War, third only to Betsy Ross and Paul Revere. She {{inspired}} generations of African Americans struggling for equality and civil rights; she was praised by leaders <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> spectrum.|$|E

5|$|The term is controversial, and its precise {{meaning is}} hard to define. Some {{minority}} students are discouraged from achieving in school by the negative prejudices of ethnic peers; such a view has been expressed in articles in The New York Times, Time magazine, and The Wall Street Journal—and by public figures and academics <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> spectrum.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1770s, Johnson {{had become}} an {{established}} publisher. Writers—particularly Dissenters—sought him out, and his home started to become the centre of a radical and stimulating intellectual milieu. Because he was willing to publish multiple opinions on issues, he was respected as a publisher by writers from <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> spectrum. Johnson published many Unitarian works, but he also issued works criticizing them; although he was an abolitionist, he also published works arguing in favour of the slave trade; he supported inoculation, but he also published works critical of the practice.|$|E
5|$|Despite his mixed legacy, Sargsyan is {{now widely}} {{recognized}} as a national hero <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> spectrum and by the public. Given the honorific Sparapet, he {{made significant contributions to}} the establishment of Armenia as independent state and ensuring its security as the founder of the Armenian Army. He has also been criticized by human rights organizations for being undemocratic, especially for his role in elections. Sargsyan was awarded the highest titles of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh—National Hero of Armenia and Hero of Artsakh.|$|E

5|$|In 1975, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi {{imposed a}} state of emergency. The Jana Sangh {{took part in the}} {{widespread}} protests, with thousands of its members being imprisoned along with other agitators across the country. In 1977, the emergency was withdrawn and general elections were held. The Jana Sangh merged with parties from <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> spectrum, including the Socialist Party, the Congress (O) and the Bharatiya Lok Dal to form the Janata Party, with its main agenda being defeating Indira Gandhi.|$|E
5|$|Leader of the Opposition and Labour leader Ed Miliband, {{who knew}} Benn {{personally}} {{as a family}} friend, said:I think Tony Benn {{will be remembered as}} a champion of the powerless, as a conviction politician, as somebody of deep principle and integrity. The thing about Tony Benn is that you always knew what he stood for, and who he stood up for. And I think that's why he was admired right <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> spectrum. There are people who agreed with him and disagreed with him, including in my own party, but I think people admired that sense of conviction and integrity that shone through from Tony Benn.|$|E
5|$|Thatcher {{narrowly}} escaped {{injury in}} an IRA assassination {{attempt at a}} Brighton hotel {{early in the morning}} on 12 October 1984. Five people were killed, including the wife of minister John Wakeham. Thatcher was staying at the hotel to prepare for the Conservative Party conference, which she insisted should open as scheduled the following day. She delivered her speech as planned, though rewritten from her original draft, in a move that was widely supported <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> spectrum and enhanced her popularity with the public.|$|E

5000|$|Other sources {{describe}} the [...] "methodical campaign of arrest and assassination by Israel" [...] of mid-level and senior-level leadership <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Palestinian <b>political</b> spectrum, resulting in 40,000 arrests {{and more than}} 300 assassinations, {{as the reason for}} Hamas and Al-Fatah not having an appetite for a third uprising.|$|R
5|$|The James Bond {{character}} and related media have triggered {{a number of}} criticisms and reactions <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> spectrum, and are still highly debated in popular culture studies. Some observers accuse Bond novels and films of misogyny and sexism. Geographers have considered the role of exotic locations in the movies in {{the dynamics of the}} Cold War, with power struggles among blocs playing out in the peripheral areas. Other critics claim that 21st century Bond movies reflect imperial nostalgia. American conservative critics, particularly in the 1960s and 1970s, saw Bond as a nihilistic, hedonistic, and amoral character that challenged family values.|$|E
5|$|There {{were many}} ways to die on the inner German border. Numerous escapees were shot by the border guards, while others were killed by mines and booby-traps. A {{substantial}} number drowned while trying to cross the Baltic and the Elbe river. Not all of those killed on the border were attempting to escape. On 13October 1961, Westfälische Rundschau journalist Kurt Lichtenstein was shot on the border {{near the village of}} Zicherie after he attempted to speak with East German farm workers. His death aroused condemnation <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> spectrum in West Germany. The incident prompted students from Braunschweig to erect a sign on the border protesting the killing.|$|E
5|$|A {{mathematical}} look at {{the voting}} numbers reveals that Bush {{would have had to}} win 12.55% of Perot's 18.91% of the vote, 66.36% of Perot's support base, to earn a majority of the vote, and would have needed to win nearly every state Clinton won by less than five percentage points. Furthermore, Perot was most popular in states that strongly favored either Clinton or Bush, limiting his real electoral impact for either candidate. He gained relatively little support in the Southern states and happened to have the best showing in states with few electoral votes. Perot appealed to disaffected voters all <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> spectrum who had grown weary of the two-party system. Perot's anti-NAFTA stance played a role in his support, and Perot voters were relatively moderate on hot button social issues such as abortion and gay rights.|$|E

Countless {{newspapers}} <b>across</b> <b>the</b> entire <b>political</b> spectrum, from Orthodox to Yiddishist to socialist, featured front-page biographies of Rabbi Shapiro.|$|R
25|$|Harris {{attempted}} {{to shift the}} GPC away from an exclusively environmentalist message, and often described the party's ideology as socially progressive and fiscally conservative and as the only party committed to sustainability. He has rejected the argument that voting for the Greens will elect Conservative candidates through vote-splitting, arguing that his party takes support from <b>across</b> <b>the</b> traditional <b>political</b> spectrum.|$|R

5|$|Specific {{elements}} were popular <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> spectrum, while others, {{such as the}} mandate to purchase insurance, were widely disliked. In a 2012 poll 44% supported the law, with 56% against. By party affiliation, 75% of Democrats, 27% of Independents and 14% of Republicans favored the law overall. 82% favored banning insurance companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, 61% favored allowing children to stay on their parents' insurance until age 26, 72% supported requiring companies with more than 50 employees to provide insurance for their employees, and 39% supported the individual mandate to own insurance or pay a penalty. By party affiliation, 19% of Republicans, 27% of Independents, and 59% of Democrats favored the mandate. Other polls showed additional provisions receiving majority support, including the creation of insurance exchanges, pooling small businesses and the uninsured with other consumers so that more people {{can take advantage of}} large group pricing benefits and providing subsidies to individuals and families to make health insurance more affordable.|$|E
5|$|With {{the end of}} Playford's tenure, the LCL {{had brought}} younger, more {{progressive}} members into its ranks. The Hall Government continued many of the social reforms that the Walsh/Dunstan governments had initiated; most of these at the instigation of Hall or his Attorney-General, Robin Millhouse. Abortion was partially legalised, and planning for the Festival Centre began. The conservative and rural factions of the League, notably in the Legislative Council dominated by the landed gentry, were bitterly opposed to some reforms, and more than once Hall was forced to rely on Labor support to see bills passed. The LCL began to break apart; {{what had once been}} a united party was now factionalised—four distinct groups <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> spectrum appeared within the party. The economy of South Australia began to pick up under Hall, returning to full employment. During the term in opposition, Des Corcoran became Dunstan's deputy, and the pair worked together well despite any rift that may have been caused by the struggle to succeed Walsh.|$|E

50|$|The National Action Plan is {{an action}} plan that was {{established}} by the Government of Pakistan in January 2015 {{to crack down on}} terrorism and to supplement the ongoing anti-terrorist offensive in North-Western Pakistan.

25|$|By 1953, the West Irian dispute {{had become}} the central issue in Indonesian {{domestic}} politics. All <b>political</b> parties <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Indonesian <b>political</b> spectrum, particularly <b>the</b> Indonesian Communist Party (PKI), supported Sukarno's efforts to integrate West Irian into the Indonesian Republic. According to the historians Audrey and George McTurnan Kahin, the PKI's pro-integration stance helped the party to rebuild its political base and to further its credentials as a nationalist Communist Party that supported Sukarno.|$|R
