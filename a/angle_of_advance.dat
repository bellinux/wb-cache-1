25|$|In {{the winter}} of 1939–40, the Belgian {{consul-general}} in Cologne had anticipated the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>advance</b> that Manstein was planning. Through intelligence reports, the Belgians deduced that German forces were concentrating along the Belgian and Luxembourg frontiers. The Belgians were convinced that the Germans would thrust through the hilly and heavily forested Ardennes to the English Channel {{to cut off the}} Allied field armies in Belgium and north-eastern France. The Belgians also anticipated that the Germans would try to land Fallschirmjäger (paratroops) and glider forces to capture Belgian fortifications but their warnings were not heeded by the French nor British. In March 1940, Swiss intelligence detected six or seven Panzer divisions on the German-Luxembourg-Belgian border and more motorised divisions were detected in the area. French intelligence were informed through aerial reconnaissance that the Germans were constructing pontoon bridges about halfway over the Our River on the Luxembourg-German border. On 30 April, the French military attaché in Bern warned that the centre of the German assault would come on the Meuse at Sedan, sometime between 8 and 10 May. These reports had little effect on Gamelin, as did similar reports from neutral sources such as the Vatican and a French sighting of a -long line of German armoured vehicles on the Luxembourg border trailing back inside Germany.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the possibility of}} controlling injection and ignition parameters of a spark-ignition engine performed with the author’s controller. The modification of output signals according to given parameters of the interface is shown in this article. Simulations, supported by oscilloscope graphs, were performed using the controller designed to work with four-cylinder spark-ignition engine. This device allows modifying the ignition and injection parameters depending on the values entered in the author’s interface on the PC. This interface enables a serial transmission through a RS 232 serial port and sending data to the microcontroller. The controller allows for a measurement {{of the values of}} the sensors and a generation of output signals for the actuators. The simulation done in this work involves the modification of injection and ignition angle parameters: ignition <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>advance</b> (KWZ), injection <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>advance</b> (KWW) and time parameters: time of injection (KW), time of ignition (KZ).

A digital computer model of a diesel engine and load is developed which takes into account in cycle calculations the input temperature and pressure, mass of fuel injected, angle of injection, and cylinder temperature and pressure, and gives as outputs the average torque and speed. A typical heat release curve from a practical engine test is used with ignition delay considered constant in time. Results from the program are validated by comparison with data taken from laboratory engine tests. This model is subsequently linearized to obtain the transfer function matrix relating input manifold pressure, mass of fuel injected, and <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>advance</b> to output torque and speed.

After power-on, voltages with small <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>advance</b> or retard are applied to the load for pretesting the load, whereby the <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>advance</b> or retard are gradually increased. At the start of every voltage application, the active current is measured in a narrow time window.

The power-up process avoids high loading of the network {{in the event of a}} short circuit or an overload. The active current measuring window starts when voltage is applied to the load. At an interval to the time window there is another measuring window for the reactive current, whereby the latter measuring window starts at the zero-crossing of the alternating current voltage.

40|$|The {{motion of}} massive {{particles}} {{in the background of}} a charged black hole in heterotic string theory, which is characterized by a parameter α, is studied in detail in this paper. Since it is possible to write this space-time in the Einstein frame, we perform a quantitative analysis of the time-like geodesics by means of the standard Lagrange procedure. Thus, we obtain and solve a set of differential equations and then we describe the orbits in terms of the elliptic -Weierstraß function. Also, by making an elementary derivation developed by Cornbleet (Am. J. Phys. 61 7, (1993) 650 - 651) we obtain the correction to the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>advance</b> of perihelion to first order in α, and thus, by comparing with Mercury's data we give an estimation for the value of this parameter, which yields an heterotic solar charge Q_≃ 0. 728 [Km]= 0. 493 M_.

Both the ignition-delay period and the period of combustion of the mixture become shorter, which requires optimization <b>of</b> the spark <b>advance</b> <b>angle</b> for various proportions of hydrogen in the fuel.

Starting from the thin-film based formalism, we present closed-form analytical expressions relating the dynamic contact-angle with the capillary number (essentially normalized contact-line speed) and other interfacial parameters. Specifically, our analysis presents, within the realm of hydrodynamic paradigm, a connection between the micro- and macro-scale physics at the vicinity of the contact-line region, taking the combined confluence of viscous and capillary forces along with van der Waals and electrostatic interactions. This connection rationalizes the hitherto reported anomalous window of the magnitude of the microscopic length scales required to corroborate experimental data for ionic liquids. Moreover, our analysis shows the possibility of a transition from strong to weak influence of surface charge in a dynamic fashion with contact-line speed along with other electrochemical parameters, leading towards substantiating the reported multiple asymptotic behavior of dynamic contact-angle over a wide range of capillary numbers.

To obtain the averaged ACA and RCA values, the measurements were performed for ten water droplets supported on the each sample. The apparent surface free energy (S) was calculated from the ACA and RCA values using a hysteresis approach [30].

40|$|A {{primary goal}} of the {{astrobiology}} program is the search for fossil records. The astrobiology exploration strategy calls for the location and return of samples indicative of environments conducive to life, and that best capture and preserve biomarkers. Successfully returning samples from environments conducive to life requires two primary capabilities: (1) in situ mapping of the mineralogy {{in order to determine}} whether the desired minerals are present; and (2) nondestructive screening of samples for additional in-situ testing and/or selection for return to laboratories for more in-depth examination. Two of the most powerful identification techniques are micro-imaging and visible/infrared spectroscopy. The design and test results are presented from a compact rugged instrument that combines micro-imaging and spectroscopic capability to provide in-situ analysis, mapping, and sample screening capabilities. Accurate reflectance spectra should be a measure of reflectance as a function of wavelength only. Other compact multispectral microimagers use separate LEDs (light-emitting diodes) for each wavelength and therefore vary the <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> illumination when changing wavelengths.

On most airfoil shapes, as the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack increases, the upper surface separation point of the flow moves from the trailing edge towards the leading edge. At the critical <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack, upper surface flow is more separated and the airfoil or wing is producing its maximum coefficient <b>of</b> lift. As <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack increases further, the upper surface flow {{becomes more and more}} fully separated and the airfoil/wing produces less coefficient of lift.|$|R
