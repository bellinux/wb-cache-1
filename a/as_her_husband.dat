5|$|Construction on the Texas Governor's Mansion in Austin {{had been}} {{completed}} three years earlier and first occupied by Governor Elisha M. Pease, whose wife played hostess to anyone who stopped by for a visit. The Houston family and their retinue of slaves moved into the mansion during a political climate that grew increasingly hostile over the secession debate. The family furniture had been moved from Independence by Joshua, since the state government had no budget for staffing, furnishing or maintaining the governor's residence. That financial burden fell {{on the shoulders of}} the incumbent, and the state partially defaulted on Houston's salary. Margaret feared for the family's safety, <b>as</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> worked towards defeating passage of the state's Ordinance of Secession. There had been a botched assassination attempt on Houston, and she saw throngs of angry malcontents gathering in the city. Margaret closed the mansion doors to all but those with an invitation from the Houstons.|$|E
5|$|Created by the god Brahma as {{the most}} {{beautiful}} woman, Ahalya was married to the much older Gautama. In the earliest full narrative, when Indra comes disguised <b>as</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband,</b> Ahalya sees through his disguise but nevertheless accepts his advances. Later sources often absolve her of all guilt, describing how she falls prey to Indra's trickery. In all narratives, Ahalya and Indra are cursed by Gautama. The curse varies from text to text, but almost all versions describe Rama as the eventual agent of her liberation and redemption. Although early texts describe how Ahalya must atone by undergoing severe penance while remaining invisible {{to the world and}} how she is purified by offering Rama hospitality, in the popular retelling developed over time, Ahalya is cursed to become a stone and regains her human form after she is brushed by Rama's foot.|$|E
5|$|Following this, {{the estate}} was {{acquired}} by the Moseley family of Manchester and became known as Cheadle Moseley.

It was purchased by John Davenport, who bequeathed it to the Bamford family when he died childless in 1760. After the last Bamford died without male issue in 1806, the estate passed to Robert Hesketh who took the name Bamford-Hesketh; it is from this family that the Hesketh Tavern public house in Cheadle Hulme got its name.

5|$|Heydrich's widow Lina won {{the right}} to a pension {{following}} a series of court cases against the West German government in 1956 and 1959.

Washington University's Chancellor, Arthur Holley Compton made a special allowance for Gerty {{to hold a position}} there, going against the university's nepotism rules. Gerty had to wait thirteen years before she attained the same rank <b>as</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband.</b> In 1943, she was made an associate professor of Research Biological Chemistry and Pharmacology. Months before she won the Nobel Prize, she was promoted to full professor, a post she held until her death in 1957.|$|E

5|$|Throughout 1993, Carey began conceptualizing Music Box (1993), {{which became}} the highest selling album of Carey's career. For her past two albums, Carey's {{creative}} choices were heavily controlled by her label Columbia Records, as well <b>as</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> and CEO of the company, Tommy Mottola. Carey's previous effort, Emotions (1991), drew influence from 1950s, 60s, and 70s balladry, gospel, R and soul music, and failed {{to achieve the same}} success matched by her debut album. Following its tepid commercial performance, Columbia aimed for Music Box to be a vehicle for very commercial singles that could garner strong radio airplay. The album was formed as a pop record, and more mainstream than anything on Emotions. Music Box went on to sell over 32 million copies worldwide, and earned its place among the best-selling albums of all time. Due to the album's success, Columbia allowed Carey more control over the music she recorded for Daydream (1995).|$|E
