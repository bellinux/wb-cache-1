The depth-dependent cathodoluminescence (CL) spectra indicate a relatively uniform Al {{distribution in the}} growth direction, but the monochromatic CL images and the CL spectra obtained by line scan measurements reveal a lateral phase separation in AlGaN grown on relatively thick HT-AlN ILs. Moreover, when increasing the thickness of HT-AlN IL, the domain-like distribution of the AlN mole fraction in AlGaN layers is significantly enhanced through a great reduction of the domain size.

In this paper we report on time-integrated photoluminescence measurements on individual polymer wrapped semiconducting carbon nanotubes.

Furthermore, we identify a state filling effect in individual carbon nanotubes at cryogenic temperatures as previously observed in quantum dots. We propose that each of the CNTs is segmented into a chain of zero-dimensional states confined by a varying local potential along the CNT, determined by local environmental factors such as the amount of polymer wrapping.

With AC hearing, the cochlea is stimulated by air pressure variations via the ear canal, whereas with BC hearing, sound vibrations are transmitted thru the skull bone to the cochlea.

In order to determine the type and degree of hearing loss, the BC hearing thresholds are measured using a bone vibrator, and then analyzed together with the AC hearing thresholds to suggest an appropriate rehabilitation alternative. This thesis deals with two BC hearing related topics.

40|$|When {{trivalent}} {{rare earth}} (RE³⁺) ions are {{introduced into the}} alkaline earth fluoride, they substitute for the divalent cation and some form of charge compensation {{is required for the}} crystal to maintain charge neutrality. A wide variety of symmetry configurations can be produced depending on the charge compensator(s) and the rare earth ion(s) in the lattice. The selective laser excitation technique was used to determine the symmetry of the various dopant centres in CaF₂ and Sr F₂ doped with Nd³⁺ ions; both before and after hydrogenation treatment. Previously unassigned energy levels of F¯ charge compensating centres of tetragonal and orthorhombic symmetry in CaF₂ : Nd³⁺ and SrF₂ : Nd³⁺ have been identified by the energy upconversion processes. The upconversion mechanisms for the tetragonal centre <b>are</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dominated by the sequential two photon excitation process (STEP), whereas the two orthorhombic centres <b>are</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dominated by the phonon-assisted energy transfer upconversion process (ETU). The hydrogenic analogues of the well established tetragonal centre in CaF₂ : Nd³⁺ and SrF₂ : N d³⁺, and other hydrogenic charge compensating centres were studied. The fluorescence of some of the multiple charge compensating hydrogenic centres were found to exhibit 'bleaching' behaviours. These effects are attributed to the migration of the hydrogenic ions adjacent to the rare earth ion. For the tetragonal centres, the C₄v irreducible representation designations of the crystal field levels were identified by their intensity variations in the polarisation studies. Energy transfer between the rare earth ions within a cluster centre was established by studying the M' centres in the CaF₂ : Nd³⁺ co-doped with Ce³⁺, Gd³⁺ or Yb³⁺ rare earth ions. These multiple rare earth ion centres also exhibit energy upconversion processes similar to those observed for the orthorhombic centres in CaF₂ : Nd³⁺. Crystal field analyses have been carried out for the tetragonal centres observed in CaF₂ : Nd³⁺ and SrF₂ : Nd³⁺ and a simplified superposition model was used to analyse the distortions in these centres. The crystal field results are in satisfactory agreement with the experimental data and predicted the experimentally unobserved Z₄ energy level for the various C₄v centres...|$|E
40|$|A {{synthetic}} {{investigation on}} {{the formation of}} cobalt hydroxides {{has been carried out}} under low pH and atmosphere-controlled conditions. It was found that various phases and compositions of cobalt hydroxides can be tailor-prepared via a careful control of preparative parameters such as the initial concentration ratio of [OH-]/[Co 2 +], preparative atmosphere and aging time. Through elemental and structural determinations, the formation sequence of a major cobalt hydroxide in air has been shown as: turbostratic Co-II hydroxide, Co-II hydrotalcite-like phase, Co-II,Co-III hydrotalcite-like phase and Co-II brucite-like phase. It is indicated that the oxidation of divalent cobalt in Co-II brucite-like phase becomes more difficult when the hydroxide is synthesized with a higher [OH-]/[Co 2 +] ratio. Defective crystallites and large interlayer spacing <b>are</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the two major factors contributing to the oxidation of divalent cobalt. In contrast to the samples prepared in air, the Co-II brucite-like phase is readily formed under a nitrogen atmosphere even at a low [OH-]/[Co 2 +] ratio. Thermal decomposition of prepared hydroxides has also been conducted, which confirms the findings revealed by the synthetic experiments and compositional and structural analyses.

At this temperature, the fluxionality of the dppf ligand ceases whereas {{the dynamics of the}} phenyl rings about the P-Cipso(φ,φ′) (the "ipso" in the phenyl rings) was rapid on the NMR time scale down to - 85 °C. The fluxional barrier (ΔG*exp = 46. 4 ± 1. 0 kJ/mol) for the interconversion of the R and the 5 forms was determined by variable-temperature 1 H NMR spectroscopic studies. The range of the Cp proton chemical shifts varies from δ(1 H) = 3. 00 to 5. 68 ppm and is the largest reported. The [Re 2 (μ-OMe) 2] core was found to be static throughout the temperature-lowering process indicating that fluxionality is thus confined to the dppf fragment in the molecule. Ring current effects similar to those observed for the internal protons (Hi) in cyclophane molecules <b>are</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> responsible for the anomalous proton shifts. Molecular modeling calculations indicates complete ring flipping of the diphenyls about their respective P-Cipso bonds was not possible because of the steric congestion about the ferrocene.

This pilot study was performed to evaluate the effect of an accelerated hypofractionated 4 days schedule (octa shot) in providing palliation to such advanced cases of head and neck cancer. Materials and Methods: Twenty-two patients with advanced (Stage VIB-IVB) squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck region were enrolled in the study. All these patients were planned for radiotherapy at Cobalt Unit with a fractionation schedule of 3. 5 Gy/fraction, 2 fractions/day with 6 h interval between two fractions, for four days (28 Gy/ 8 Fr/ 4 days). Patients were reviewed at 2 and 4 weeks to assess change in tumor size, any symptomatic relief, or toxicity. The tumor response, dermal, and mucosal toxicities were assessed using WHO criteria. Results: Median age of these 22 patients (17 M male + 5 F female) in the study was 59. 8 years. After completion of radiotherapy, first response evaluation done at 15 th day showed ≥ 50 % objective response in 14 patients. At 1 month, this response increased to ≥ 75 % in 16 patients and 50 %– 75 % in three patients. None of the patients had disease progression. Improvement in symptoms was reported with respect to pain and dysphagia by patients subjectively.

Further substitution with citric acid gives the monomeric gadolinium citrate with EDTA (NH 4) (2) Na[Gd(EDTA) (H(2) cit) ]center dot 4 H(2) O (3). The compounds were characterized by elemental analysis, single crystal X-ray diffraction, FT-IR, ESI-MS and thermogravimetric analysis. Structural analysis indicates that three coordinated water molecules in the gadolinium ethylenediaminetetraacetate trihydrates are replaced by phosphite ions (HPO 32 -) in the compounds 1 and 2. Gadolinium atoms are octa-coordinated by EDTA and the phosphite ion, the latter links adjacent Gd-EDTA units to generate an infinite one-dimensional chain in compound 1 and a dimeric octatomic ring in 2. In complex 3, coordinated water molecules were substituted by the alpha-hydroxy, alpha-carboxy and beta-carboxy groups of citrate. Citrate is favourable for inhibiting the formation of Gd-EDTA phosphite. All the complexes are very easily soluble in water. The solution behavior of the isostructural lanthanum complexes was probed with C- 13 and P- 31 NMR spectra in D 2 O for comparison.
