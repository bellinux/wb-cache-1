40|$|This study {{examined}} the use of upper arm and forearm tourniquets for hand surgery. 40 subjects (20 males, 20 females) {{were randomly assigned to}} one of four groups: left upper arm, left forearm, right upper arm and right forearm. Tourniquets were applied to these <b>areas.</b> <b>Subjects</b> were asked to rate their discomfort at lo-minute intervals and the total time of tourniquet tolerance was recorded. The results of a three-factor ANOVA revealed no statistically significant differences in either pain rating or tourniquet tolerance between any of the groups.

40|$|The {{posterior}} {{sector of}} Broca's area (Brodmann area 44), a brain region critical for language, may have evolved from neurons active during observation {{and execution of}} manual movements. Imaging studies showing increased Broca's activity during execution, imagination, imitation and observation of hand movements support this hypothesis. Increased Broca's activity in motor task, however, may simply be due to inner speech. To test whether Broca's area is essential to imitation, we used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), which is known to transiently disrupt functions in stimulated <b>areas.</b> <b>Subjects</b> imitated finger key presses (imitation) or executed finger key presses in response to spatial cues (control task). While performing the tasks, subjects received rTMS over {{the left and right}} pars opercularis of the inferior frontal gyrus (where Brodmann area 44 is probabilistically located) and over the occipital cortex. There was significant impairment in imitation, but not in the control task, during rTMS over left and right pars opercularis compared to rTMS over the occipital cortex. This suggests that Broca's area is a premotor region essential to finger movement imitation. Heiser et al. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} EEG study we {{investigated}} whether semantic knowledge for object use {{is represented in}} motor-related brain <b>areas.</b> <b>Subjects</b> were required to perform actions with everyday objects and to maintain either a meaningful or a meaningless end posture with the object. Analysis of the EEG data focused on the beta-frequency band, as previous {{studies have indicated that}} the maintenance of a posture is reflected in stronger beta-oscillations. Time frequency analysis indicated that the execution of actions resulting in a meaningless compared to a meaningful end posture was accompanied by a stronger beta-desynchronization {{towards the end of the}} movement and a stronger subsequent beta-rebound after posture-onset. The effect in the beta-frequency band was localized to premotor, parietal and medial frontal areas and could not be attributed to differences in timing or movement complexity between meaningful and meaningless actions. Together these findings directly show that the motor system is differentially activated during the execution and maintenance of semantically correct or incorrect end postures. This suggests that semantic object knowledge is indeed represented in motor-related brain areas, organized around specific end postures associated with the use of objects...|$|E

40|$|We studied whether {{detectable}} percepts {{could be}} produced by electrical stimulation of intracranial electrodes placed over human visual areas identified with fMRI. Identification of areas was confirmed by recording local-field potentials from the electrode, such as face-selective electrical responses from electrodes over the fusiform face area (FFA). The probability of detecting electrical stimulation of a visual area varied with {{the position of the}} area in the visual cortical hierarchy. Stimulation of early visual areas including V 1, V 2, and V 3 was almost always detected, whereas stimulation of late visual areas such as FFA was rarely detected. When percepts were elicited from late <b>areas,</b> <b>subjects</b> reported that they were simple shapes and colors, similar to the descriptions of percepts from early areas. There were no reports of elaborate percepts, such as faces, even in areas like FFA, where neurons have complex response properties. For sites eliciting percepts, the detection threshold was determined by varying the stimulation current as subjects performed a forced-choice detection task. Current thresholds were similar for late and early areas. The similarity between both percept quality and threshold across early and late areas suggests the presence of functional microcircuits that link electrical stimulation with perception...|$|E
40|$|Near-infrared {{spectroscopy}} (NIRS) is {{a developing}} technology for low-cost noninvasive functional brain imaging. With multichannel optical instruments, it becomes possible to measure not only local changes in hemoglobin concentrations but also temporal correlations of those changes in different brain regions which gives an optical analog of functional connectivity traditionally measured by fMRI. We recorded hemodynamic activity during the Go-NoGo task from 11 right-handed subjects with probes placed bilaterally over prefrontal <b>areas.</b> <b>Subjects</b> were detecting animals as targets in natural scenes pressing a mouse button. Data were low-pass filtered < 1 Hz and cardiac∕respiration∕superficial layers artifacts were removed using Independent Component Analysis. Fisher's transformed correlations of poststimulus responses (30 s) were averaged over groups of channels unilaterally in each hemisphere (intrahemispheric connectivity) {{and the corresponding}} channels between hemispheres (interhemispheric connectivity). The hemodynamic response showed task-related activation (an increase∕decrease in oxygenated∕deoxygenated hemoglobin, respectively) greater in the right versus left hemisphere. Intra- and interhemispheric functional connectivity was also significantly stronger during the task compared to baseline. Functional connectivity between the inferior and the middle frontal regions was significantly stronger in the right hemisphere.

PFOS and PFOA levels were also evaluated in seminal plasma. In {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs) of same subjects, gene expression levels of a panel of nuclear receptors (NRs), namely estrogen receptor α (ERα) estrogen receptor β (ERβ), androgen receptor (AR), aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) were also assessed. Infertile men from the metropolitan area had significantly higher levels of BPA and gene expression of all NRs, except PPARγ, compared to subjects from other <b>areas.</b> <b>Subjects</b> from urban areas had significantly higher levels of MEHP, whereas subjects from rural area had higher levels of PFOA in both blood and seminal plasma. Interestingly, ERα, ERβ, AR, PXR and AhR expression is directly correlated with BPA and inversely correlated with PFOA serum levels.
