This picture usually {{appears to}} be of a {{pleasant}} countryside, but when anyone wishes for the picture to show a particular person or place, the scene will display what is wished for.

Davis, Miller county courthouse, Texarkana, Ark. You may be the one to aid in solving the phantom slayings.|$|E
25|$|Breaking {{down the}} {{distinction}} between the fine and applied arts was a key aim of the movement, and Birmingham Group artists practiced across a variety of disciplines, producing stained glass, jewellery, metalwork, embroidery, hand printed books and furniture as well as pictures. In painting they emphasised the role of <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>in</b> the context of a wider work or space, often producing murals or frescos for specific buildings, presenting easel pictures in custom-built frames considered integral to the work of art, and working in exacting media such as tempera or watercolour on vellum, where the creation of the materials was {{an essential part of the}} creation of the work.|$|E

25|$|Malise is {{believed}} to have died in 1271, while in France. His body was brought back to Scotland, and he was buried at Dunblane Cathedral, the religious centre of Strathearn. In 1817, during reconstruction of Dunblane Cathedral, two sarcophagi were discovered with life-size effigies of a warrior and his lady. Since the fourteenth-century chronicler John of Fordun had recorded Dunblane as the burial site of Malise, these were determined to be the tombs of Malise and his countess, though which one is uncertain. It was marked with the date 1271. In addition, Sir Robert Sibbald once mentioned that in the late 17th century, there was <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>in</b> the church which represented the Countess of Strathearn and her children kneeling for a blessing to St. Blane, though its whereabouts today are unknown.|$|E
25|$|Fiesco reveals to Adorno that Amelia {{is not a}} Grimaldi, but a {{foundling}} {{adopted by}} the family. When Adorno says {{that he does not}} care, Fiesco blesses the marriage. Boccanegra enters and tells Amelia that he has pardoned her exiled brothers. She tells him that she is in love, but not with Paolo, whom she refuses to marry. Boccanegra has no desire to force Amelia into a marriage against her will. She tells him that she was adopted and that she has one souvenir of her mother, <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>in</b> a locket. The two compare Amelia's picture with Boccanegra's, and Boccanegra realizes that she is his long-lost daughter. Finally reunited, they are overcome with joy. Amelia goes into the palace. Soon after, Paolo arrives to find out if Amelia has accepted him. Boccanegra tells him that the marriage will not take place. Furious, Paolo arranges for Amelia to be kidnapped.|$|E

[...] He was initially contracted as a guest star with [...] "potential regular status in [...] future", which came to fruition. [...] At first, Leung struggled with the show's secrecy, not knowing much about his character's background or motivations, but he found some understanding with his character's clothing. [...] Costume designer Roland Sanchez based Miles's wardrobe choice after that of The Rolling Stones member Keith Richards; specifically <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>in</b> which he wore a sleeveless vest. [...] Sanchez believed that Miles fit the haggard look and bought an Armani Exchange jacket, cropped the sleeves and added a hood.|$|E

[...] Kevin Feige had a cameo as a Weapon X tech, but his scenes did not make the final cut of the film.|$|E
500|$|Apple {{commissioned}} American artist Bob Gill {{to produce}} a painting for the front cover of Wonderwall Music. Gill recalls that he first attended {{a meeting at the}} company's headquarters, where the four Beatles emphasised the importance of the album for their new record label and outlined the concept behind the film. Gill painted <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>in</b> the style of Belgian surrealist René Magritte, showing a formally dressed man [...] "separated by a huge red brick wall from a group of happy bathing Indian maidens", Spizer writes. Apple executive Derek Taylor, whom Harrison had invited to help run the Beatles' label in early 1968, later wrote of Gill's submission: [...] "It was a nice painting but missed the essence of hope." [...] To Gill's chagrin, Harrison requested that a brick be removed from the wall, because he deemed it important to [...] "give the fellow on the other side a chance, just as the Jack MacGowran character had a chance [...] ".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{contains}} several {{references to}} the film Animal House, including the song [...] "Louie Louie" [...] by The Kingsmen which plays throughout the film. The couch gag with the huge pink foot squashing the Simpsons is a reference to The Foot of Cupid of the television series Monty Python's Flying Circus. The film Monty Python and the Holy Grail is also referenced when Benjamin, Doug, and Gary imitate the Knights who say Ni. They play Dungeons & Dragons, hold arguments over Star Trek, and their room number is 222, {{a reference to the}} television series Room 222. Homer has posters of Albert Einstein and W. C. Fields. The episode contains the first reference to the Internet on The Simpsons, as [...] "computer signals" [...] being sent between the Nerds and MIT. <b>A</b> <b>picture</b> <b>in</b> the dorm shows four men wearing silver dome hats resembles the '80s new wave band Devo.

500|$|In July 2003, the Press Complaints Commission {{dismissed}} {{a complaint}} filed by Beckinsale. Beckinsale had {{claimed that the}} Daily Mail invaded her and her daughter's privacy by publishing photographs of the actress embracing and kissing her then new boyfriend Len Wiseman. The article was headlined [...] "Mummy's latest love scene leaves Lily unimpressed" [...] and included <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>in</b> which her four-year-old daughter appeared to be ignoring her mother's romantic actions. The Commission found that [...] "the photographs had been taken {{in a public place}} and did not reveal any private details about Lily—such as her health or schooling—but were restricted to general observations about her apparent reaction to her surroundings." [...] In August 2003, Beckinsale received a published apology from the Daily Mail after the newspaper reported that she had [...] "spent time in a clinic" [...] following her split from boyfriend Michael Sheen. The apology was issued after the actress {{filed a complaint with the}} Press Complaints Commission. In 2009 Beckinsale was awarded £20,000 in damages by the British High Court after taking legal action against Express Newspapers. The Daily Express had falsely reported that the actress was [...] "facing heartbreak" [...] after missing out on a part in a remake of Barbarella.|$|E
500|$|Florey owned no {{camera at}} the time, and {{his efforts to}} obtain one were {{unsuccessful}} until he met Vorkapić. Florey said of their discussion: [...] "I say to Slav, 'Slav, I have an idea but not much money. You have a camera and are a clever painter. Let's make the picture in collaboration and we split the benefit.'" [...] Vorkapić himself claimed to have said: [...] "Florey, you get me 100 dollars and I'll make you <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>in</b> my own kitchen." [...] Vorkapić allowed Florey to borrow a small box camera that he had purchased with the proceeds {{from the sale of}} one of his oil paintings. It was a DeVry camera with one lens, a type that Florey said was sold as a [...] "toy". Florey also had trouble obtaining film, as he found it cost-prohibitive to purchase negative and positive film from film laboratories. However, Florey knew that [...] "film ends", scraps of leftover unexposed film stock, were often discarded after shooting on big budget Hollywood films, so he attempted to persuade filmmakers to give them to him. Camera work had just been completed on The Gaucho, a film starring Douglas Fairbanks, {{and he was able to}} obtain more than 1,000 feet of film from the production in 10- and 20-foot strips. Florey then spliced the film ends together by hand, a process he found time-consuming and frustrating, but one that resulted in the equivalent of a full reel of negative film. Fairbanks, who had previously hired Florey to handle his European public relations, provided financial assistance for the production of A Hollywood Extra. He also gave Florey access to his editing rooms and helped provide him with film ends.|$|E
500|$|While {{casting the}} [...] "freighter folk"– the {{nickname}} that Losts executive producers/writers/show runners Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse use {{to refer to}} Daniel, Charlotte, Miles and Frank– fake names, occupations and scenes were temporarily assigned, to limit the leak of spoilers. [...] After seeing Ken Leung guest star on HBO's The Sopranos in April 2007, Lindelof and Cuse wrote the role of Miles specifically for him, although it was initially reported that Leung would be playing the part of [...] "brilliant mathematician" [...] "Russell". [...] The name Miles Straume was simply chosen because the writer-producers thought that [...] "it would be cool if his name sounded like 'maelstrom. [...] Had he not taken the part, Lindelof and Cuse claim that Miles would have been scrapped and a new and very different character would have been written into the story instead. [...] Leung, who was originally contracted as a recurring guest star, {{was quoted as saying}} that [...] "Miles doesn't know how to be social, which is great, because I don't know how to be social." [...] Costume designer Roland Sanchez wanted to base one of the freighter folk's clothing after that of Keith Richards, specifically <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>in</b> which he wore a sleeveless vest, which he admired. [...] Sanchez believed that Miles fitted the haggard look and bought an Armani Exchange jacket, cut off the sleeves and added a hood, and that this outfit helped Leung to develop Miles. [...] Co-executive producer/writer Edward Kitsis had been pitching the name [...] "Lapidus" [...] for years, finally naming an unseen character in the fourteenth episode of the third season Rick Lapidus. [...] Unsatisfied, Kitsis developed the character [...] "Frank Lapidus, Helicopter Pilot". [...] According to the show runners, recurring guest star Jeff Fahey [...] "was the first and only choice for the role". [...] They also commended his [...] "intense eyes" [...] and stated that [...] "he has exactly the right sensibilities" [...] for the part. [...] Frank was not envisioned with a beard, however, the writer-producers allowed Fahey to keep it for the role. [...] The writer-producers have said that Frank [...] "never takes anything at face value [...] a true conspiracy nut [...] has probably seen every episode of The X-Files, [...] pay off for him".|$|E
