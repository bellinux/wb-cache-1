40|$|Dissertation {{thesis is}} focused on {{rheological}} properties of <b>asphalt</b> <b>binders</b> and on changes of their performance during the lifetime in road structures. Aging processes of <b>asphalt</b> <b>binders</b> and methods of laboratory aging are described in the theoretical part of the thesis. Furthermore, basic rheological models and related test methods {{for the evaluation of}} <b>asphalt</b> <b>binders</b> are described. In the practical part, properties of <b>asphalt</b> <b>binders</b> are investigated after aging process and their performance is evaluated by empirical and functional test methods. The various methods of aging are compared with each other and a relationship between real conditions and laboratory aging is researched. In the next section, vacuum flashed cracked residue (VFCR) is added to the selected <b>asphalt</b> <b>binders</b> and their influence on rheological properties during description of aging of <b>asphalt</b> <b>binders</b> is investigated.

40|$|The {{temperature}} dependence of viscosity of neat and modified <b>asphalt</b> <b>binders</b> were evaluated between 80 °C and 200 °C using rotational viscometry,. The activation energy for flow was determined for these <b>asphalt</b> <b>binders</b> using the Arrhenius equation. Different types of polymer and polymer contents {{were selected to}} {{study the effects of}} polymer type and concentration on the activation energy for flow. Attempts were made to use a global model to evaluate the relationship between polymer content and viscosity. The effect of aging was also discussed. The results indicate that the flow activation energy can be used to rank the temperature susceptibility of different <b>asphalt</b> <b>binders.</b> It is suggested that this ranking may be used to predict the relative compaction effort for the different <b>asphalt</b> <b>binders</b> studied.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{behavior of}} <b>asphalt</b> <b>binders</b> is nonlinear. The binders exhibit shear thinning/thickening behavior in steady shear tests and non-proportational behavior in other standard viscoelastic tests such as creep-recovery or stress relaxation tests. Moreover, they develop normal stress differences even in simple shear flows - a characteristic feature of nonlinear viscoelastic behavior. Many researchers have asserted {{the importance of}} considering the nonlinearity of the mechanical behavior of <b>asphalt</b> <b>binders</b> for accurately estimating their performance under field conditions, and for comparing and ranking them accordingly. In order to do so, {{it is necessary to}} have a robust and reliable nonlinear viscoelastic model. However, most of the models available in the literature do not capture the various features of the nonlinear response of <b>asphalt</b> <b>binders</b> accurately. Those that could are too complicated and still possess other shortcomings. Considering these issues, a new nonlinear viscoelastic model is developed here using a new Gibbs-potential based thermodynamic framework. The model is then corraborated with data from experiments in which the shear-thinning behavior and the nonproportional creep-recovery behavior were observed together. Finally, the model is used to evaluate the various criteria available for predicting rutting susceptibility of <b>asphalt</b> <b>binders.</b> Results of the analysis of the rutting prediction criteria show that each criterion characterizes the resistance to permanent strain shown by <b>asphalt</b> <b>binders</b> over a different range of applied stress - the zero-shear viscosity at very low stress levels, the Superpave criterion at very high stress levels and the MSCR test in the intermediate range of stresses...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} compares two {{techniques}} namely Wilhelmy plate (WP) and Sessile drop (SD) methods to rank moisture damage susceptibility of twelve different asphalt-aggregate combinations. Three asphalt binders: unmodified (VG 30), polymer modified (PMB 40), and crumb rubber modified (CRMB 60) binders, and four aggregates (basalt, limestone, granite, and sandstone) were selected in this study. The contact angle of selected <b>asphalt</b> <b>binders</b> {{was measured using}} both WP and SD techniques. Thereafter, surface free energy (SFE) components of <b>asphalt</b> <b>binders,</b> bonding energy and compatibility ratio (CR) of selected asphalt-aggregate combinations were estimated. The {{results showed that the}} SD method showed a high variability in measurement of contact angle of <b>asphalt</b> <b>binders</b> compared to the WP method. The SD method found to be less sensitive to capture acid component of SFE of <b>asphalt</b> <b>binders.</b> Both the methods showed that PMB 40 -basalt, VG 30 -basalt, PMB 40 -limestone combination can have least susceptible to moisture damage. However, in majority of the cases (9 out of 12 asphalt-aggregates combinations, excluding PMB 40 -basalt, VG 30 -basalt, PMB 40 -limestone), both the methods resulted in different moisture damage ranking of asphalt-aggregates combinations. Currently set a minimum threshold value of CR as 0. 5 based on the WP method for screening moisture damage susceptibility of asphalt-aggregate combination may not be applicable to the SD method. The present study develops a correlation between the CR of asphalt-aggregate combination estimated from the WP and SD methods. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{physical}} and rheological properties of <b>asphalt</b> <b>binders</b> modified by nano aluminum oxide (AL 2 O 3). Several conventional tests were conducted, including penetration, softening point and ductility, rotational viscosity and dynamic shear rheometer (DSR).

The addition of a different percentage of AL 2 O 3 to base binder had a remarkable influence on resistance to permanent deformation (high temperature rutting and low temperature fatigue).

5000|$|FMA is a gap-graded {{mix with}} a high coarse {{aggregate}} (stone) content of 70-80 %, binder (asphalt) content of 6 % and filler (limestone sand) content of around 7-11 %. The percentage of cellulose fibre that {{is required for the}} FMA is 0.4 % and air voids of around 4 %. The skeletal formation of the coarse aggregate provides high resistance to deformation. Adding the fibres to the binder will prevent the asphalt from draining off during storage, transport and paving. The mastic fills the voids and retaining the aggregate in place. It has an additional stabilising effect, as well as providing the designed air voids. The result is a highly durable rut resistant asphalt mix. FMA can be used on all types of road and it is suitable for roads with heavy traffic loads and frequency. It is high binder content gives a longer lifetime than conventional mixes. Furthermore, it allows for the bitumen to bulk or thicken in order to prevent it from running off the aggregate before compaction. Its coarse and open texture generally provides high skid resistance at all speeds, as well as good drainage and fewer spray problems. Modification and stabilization of the <b>asphalt</b> <b>binder</b> is the approach to improve the pavement performance especially for the gap-graded mixtures such as FMA, which required higher viscosity <b>asphalt</b> <b>binder.</b> The method for this <b>asphalt</b> <b>binder</b> modification is by adding cellulose fibre and other oil- based materials are being used to enhance the viscosity of the base binder.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The use of {{modified}} <b>asphalt</b> <b>binders</b> {{has become}} much more common over the past two decades. Many types of modifier have been used in paving asphalts to enhance the performance of asphalt pavements {{in a wide range of}} climates and loading conditions. Among various <b>asphalts</b> <b>binder</b> modifiers, the recycled crumb rubber has been used very successfully for many years. Generally in production of CRM binder, mixing and compaction temperature is determined by measuring of binder viscosity. The ordinary method used for viscosity measurement of unmodified binder leads to a very high Mixing and Compaction Temperature (MCT) for CRM binder. The aims of this paper are to identify, develop and give some recommendations on a reliable laboratory approach for blending of CRM with binder, as well as introducing appropriate laboratory test methods for optimisation of MCT of crumb rubber modified <b>binder</b> <b>asphalt...</b>|$|R
40|$|Transverse {{cracking}} is a prevalent {{problem that}} occurs in <b>asphalt</b> pavement <b>binders</b> in cold climates and diminishes {{the integrity of the}} road as well as shortens the life span of the road leading to premature failure. Current specification for testing <b>asphalt</b> pavement <b>binders</b> for transverse cracking fails to accurately model the behavior of modified <b>asphalt</b> <b>binders</b> because it {{does not take into account}} the effects of physical hardening. Furthermore, current specification, which employs the use of the bending beam rheometer (BBR) and direct tension tests, was developed through the use of unmodified <b>asphalt</b> pavement <b>binders</b> and so it does not accurately model the behavior of modified <b>asphalt</b> pavement <b>binders</b> at colder temperatures. This study sought to come up with a new specification criterion for testing for transverse cracking as well as modeling the behavior of modified <b>asphalt</b> pavement <b>binders</b> at colder temperatures. This was achieved by the fracture energy method through the use of a single edge notched beam (SENB). The results showed that the fracture energy method proved to be an effective tool for modeling the behavior of modified <b>asphalt</b> pavement <b>binders.</b> However, when comparing the stiffness calculated from the SENB with that of the BBR we found that the stiffness in the SENB was much higher than that of the BBR. The increase in stiffness could very well be attributed to the differences in the way the samples are tested. Further research is necessary to come up with a way to compare the stiffness calculated from the SENB with that of the BBR before the fracture energy method can replace the BBR method...|$|R

5000|$|Warm mix asphalt {{concrete}} (commonly abbreviated as WMA) {{is produced by}} adding either zeolites, waxes, asphalt emulsions, or sometimes even water to the <b>asphalt</b> <b>binder</b> prior to mixing. This allows significantly lower mixing and laying temperatures and results in lower consumption of fossil fuels, thus releasing less carbon dioxide, aerosols and vapors. Not only are working conditions improved, but the lower laying-temperature also leads to more rapid availability of the surface for use, which is important for construction sites with critical time schedules. The usage of these additives in hot mixed asphalt (above) may afford easier compaction and allow cold weather paving or longer hauls. Use of warm mix is rapidly expanding. A survey of US asphalt producers found that nearly 25% of asphalt produced in 2012 was warm mix, a 416% increase since 2009.|$|E
5000|$|Hot mix asphalt {{concrete}} (commonly abbreviated as HMAC or HMA) {{is produced by}} heating the <b>asphalt</b> <b>binder</b> to decrease its viscosity, and drying the aggregate to remove moisture from it prior to mixing.

Paving and compaction must be performed while the asphalt is sufficiently hot. In many countries paving is restricted to summer months because in winter the compacted base will cool the asphalt too much before {{it is able to}} be packed to the required density. HMAC is the form of {{asphalt concrete}} most commonly used on high traffic pavements such as those on major highways, racetracks and airfields.
