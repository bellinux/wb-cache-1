5|$|Auxiliary uniform, armour, {{weapons and}} {{equipment}} were probably standardised {{by the end}} of the Julio-Claudian period. Auxiliary equipment was broadly similar to that of the legions (see Section 2.1 below for possible differences in armour). By 68AD, there was little difference between most auxiliary infantry and their legionary counterparts in equipment, training and fighting capability. The main difference was that auxilia contained combat cavalry, both heavy <b>and</b> <b>light,</b> <b>and</b> other specialized units that legions lacked.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1944, with an Allied {{invasion}} of Nazi-occupied Europe becoming ever more likely, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel {{was assigned to}} improve the wall's defences. Believing the existing coastal fortifications to be entirely inadequate, he immediately began strengthening them. Rommel's main concern was Allied air power. He had seen it first-hand when fighting the British and Americans in North Africa, and it had left a profound impression on him. He feared that any German counterattack would be broken up by Allied aircraft long before it could make a difference. Under his direction, hundreds of reinforced concrete pillboxes were built on the beaches, or sometimes slightly inland, to house machine guns, antitank guns, <b>and</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> heavy artillery. Land mines and antitank obstacles were planted on the beaches, and underwater obstacles and naval mines were placed in waters just offshore. The intent was to destroy the Allied landing craft before they could unload on the beaches.|$|E

5|$|In 1907, Besant {{became the}} {{president}} of the Theosophical Society globally, and set to work with a major expansion of the organisation's headquarters at Adyar, in what was then, Madras. When it was announced that Besant would undertake a speaking tour of Australia in 1908, she was expected to stay with Fuller while in Perth. Some months later in 1908, Fuller left Western Australia and travelled to India, staying at Adyar. Of her time in India, Fuller wrote:I went in search not only of beauty, <b>and</b> <b>light,</b> <b>and</b> colour, and the picturesqueness in general, which delight the eye and emotions of all artists—but of something deeper—something less easily expressed. I spent {{two and a half years}} in a community that is quite unique—perhaps the most cosmopolitan settlement in the world—the headquarters of the Theosophical Society... Well, I painted there, of course, but my art was undergoing a change, and I felt that it could not satisfy me unless it became so much greater.|$|E
5|$|In {{recent years}} the IMA has begun to focus on {{developing}} its contemporary art collection, which includes works such as Two White Dots in the Air by Alexander Calder <b>and</b> <b>Light</b> <b>and</b> Space III, a permanent installation by Robert Irwin located in the Pulliam Great Hall. Since 2007 the museum has featured site-specific contemporary installations in the Efroymson Pavilion, rotating the temporary works every six months. The Efroymson Pavilion has featured works by artists such as William Lamson, Ball-Nogues Studio, Orly Genger, and Heather Rowe to name a few. Contemporary art is also featured in 100 Acres: The Virginia B. Fairbanks Art and Nature Park, which is unique in its inclusion of commissioned works by emerging mid-career artists. Since 2007, the IMA has committed to building a modern design collection that illustrates the artistic merits of utilitarian objects. The focus on international contemporary design, combined {{with the opening of}} the Miller House in 2011, is expected to reposition the museum as an authority on design.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Governor Tom McCall {{appointed}} Goldschmidt to {{what would}} {{be known as the}} Governor's Task Force, which was tasked with exploring regional transportation solutions. Goldschmidt served alongside notable leaders: Glenn Jackson, chair of the board of Portland Power <b>and</b> <b>Light</b> <b>and</b> chair of the Oregon Transportation Commission, was considered the state's leading power broker on transportation issues; and Gerard Drummond, a prominent lawyer and lobbyist, was president of Tri-Met's board of directors. The task force considered an unpopular deal that would have funded the construction of the Mount Hood Freeway, which would have bisected southeast Portland. The deal, which would have been 90% funded by the Federal Highway Administration, was rescinded, with first the Multnomah County Commission and, later, Portland City Council reversing their positions and advising against it. Goldschmidt was initially opposed to diverting funds to light rail, instead favoring busways and more suitable local road projects; as the 1981 deadline to reallocate the funds approached, however, light rail became a more attractive prospect. By a process not clearly documented, light rail was included in the final plan. All federal money initially intended for the Mount Hood Freeway ultimately went to other road projects, but the total amount was doubled and the first leg of MAX light rail was approved and ultimately completed in 1986.|$|E

5|$|Japan's {{entry into}} the war in late 1941 stopped plans for the {{deployment}} of Australian armour to the Middle East. By the beginning of 1943 the Australian Armoured Corps was at its peak with 1,460 tanks on strength, {{the majority of them}} Matildas <b>and</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> medium M3s. Meanwhile, 65 production AC1 vehicles and one AC3 had been completed by June 1943. That year, the 3rd Army Tank Battalion was equipped with a squadron of AC1 tanks, which were modified to resemble German tanks and used in the filming of the movie, The Rats of Tobruk. This appears to have been the only time a squadron of Sentinels was used for any purpose. Nevertheless, the completed Sentinel tanks were used for evaluation purposes only and were not issued to operational armoured units, as the Australian Cruiser tank program was terminated in July 1943. By this time the Japanese threat had lessened, and US and British-made M3 Grant and Matilda tanks were being supplied to Australia from the Middle East, and it was felt that Australia's manufacturing resources would be better spent on railway locomotive production.|$|E

In the old western style, furniture was seen as ornament that displayed the wealth of its owner {{and the value of}} the piece was established according to the length of time spent creating it.
