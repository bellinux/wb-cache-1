5|$|As a {{character}} in the games, Mewtwo's physical appearance is not its only stark divergence from Mew. While the alterations to the genetic source material it was cloned resulted in its abilities surpassing Mew's, it also resulted in Mewtwo developing a vicious personality that is primarily interested in proving its own strength. The franchise's non-video game media, particularly the anime, has expanded upon the character. In the most notable instance, Mewtwo telepathically speaks with <b>a</b> <b>male</b> <b>voice</b> and is existentially torn over its purpose in the world.|$|E

Before finalizing his appearance several other designs were considered, ranging from a Frankenstein's monster-inspired character to a medieval berserker. Despite having <b>a</b> <b>male</b> <b>voice</b> and physical build, Astaroth {{was referred to as}} [...] "it" [...] in terms of gender for the character's Soulcalibur background information.

500|$|Leonard {{was working}} with Michael Jackson, on some transcriptions for his Bad album, when Penn called {{him to come to}} Foley's home. There he asked Leonard who would sing the track, since it was written from a man's perspective. Leonard, {{although}} he had initially envisioned <b>a</b> <b>male</b> <b>voice</b> interpreting the song, decided to use Madonna as the main vocalist and used the demo version as the main vocal with backup drums only. He later recalled that [...] "it was so innocent and so shy. It's as naive, as raw, as [...] raw can be and that's part of what gave it all its charm." [...] In a 1986 interview, Madonna said that the mood on the song was inspired by a different facet of her image makeover and her desire to focus on something different.|$|E
500|$|... "Express Yourself" [...] {{begins with}} the sound of brass tinkling along, as Madonna chimes the opening line: [...] "Come on girls, do you believe in love? 'Cause I got {{something}} to say about it, And it goes something like this." [...] Handclaps and drum beats start as Madonna moves into the chorus of the song, with a thick vocal texture and high-pitched background singing. The chorus is aided by instrumentation from a saxophone and percussion. Madonna then sings the first verse of the song, as a violin sound is added after she finishes the bridge, [...] "Make you feel like a queen on the throne, make you love it till you never come down", <b>a</b> <b>male</b> <b>voice</b> repeating the last line. A synthesizer is played after the second verse as Madonna continues chanting the words [...] "Express yourself" [...] with background vocals singing [...] "Hey, hey, hey, hey" [...] alongside her.|$|E
500|$|Although <b>a</b> <b>male</b> <b>voice</b> actor was {{sought for}} the Japanese {{adaptation}} of the Naruto role, the actress Junko Takeuchi was chosen instead over many male applicants. Before recording the first episode, Takeuchi noticed several lines from the script that ended with exclamation marks, which helped her to define Naruto's voice. She noted difficulties in transitioning from the young Naruto to the older Naruto in the animated adaptation of Part II. She had to record the first episode of Part II when Naruto's character was older and more mature only one week after voicing the younger, immature character. Nine years after first voicing the character, while still finding it tough to voice Naruto, Takeuchi's opinion of him changed with her feeling he was [...] "a very reliable young man". She admired his ability to prioritize and calmly make important decisions, and believes these traits will inspire viewers worldwide.|$|E

500|$|Madonna {{sings in}} the first verse: [...] "There are too many options/There is no consolation/I have lost my illusions/What I want is an explanation." [...] According to Rolling Stone, {{although}} not explicitly stated, the lines confirm Madonna's belief that American culture will not [...] "give her an explanation", so she had rejected American values, and along with them her own values. She repeats the line [...] "I got you under my skin" [...] while <b>a</b> <b>male</b> <b>voice</b> acts as the backing for the track. The song ends with Madonna singing the words [...] "feel good" [...] a capella. [...] The lyrics of the song deals with questions, solutions, resurrections, confusions and other broad topics of a neo-philosophical nature. Edna Gundersen of USA Today compared its composition and Madonna's performance with a love letter. The Advocate called it [...] "a plaintive love letter to her husband".|$|E
500|$|The film {{starts with}} the screen fading to black and oversized, disembodied female lips appear overdubbed with <b>a</b> <b>male</b> <b>voice,</b> {{establishing}} the androgynous theme to be repeated as the film unfolds.

500|$|One {{week before}} the January special election, a {{controversy}} arose over a Coakley approved television ad. [...] The ad referenced the conscientious objector amendment Brown had sponsored for inclusion in a 2005 proposed state measure on patients' rights. [...] This amendment would have allowed individual healthcare workers and hospitals to refuse to provide emergency contraceptive care (the morning-after pill) to rape victims if they objected due to a religious belief. After the amendment failed, Brown did vote for the main bill which, along with other patient rights, requires healthcare workers and hospitals to provide such care. Coakley's ad featured <b>a</b> <b>male</b> <b>voice</b> that said, [...] "Brown even favors letting hospitals deny emergency contraception to rape victims," [...] over the ad's graphic which had the words, [...] "Deny care to rape victims." [...] Brown's daughter Ayla called the Coakley ad [...] "completely inaccurate and misleading", and stated that her father would never deny care to a rape victim. [...] Brown criticized Coakley for running {{what he described as}} attack ads.|$|E

500|$|Dickson {{recalled}} {{that during the}} recording sessions, Webber asked her to sing in a higher range than her usual, since the [...] "mistress" [...] character was a teenager, and should have sounded younger. Before the sequence of the eviction of the mistress occurs in Act I of the musical, Eva's character sings the song [...] "Hello and goodbye" [...] and then [...] "Another Suitcase in Another Hall" [...] begins. A soft strummed guitar in broken chord patterns heralds the introductory music. Dickson sings the opening verse, and the chorus which is repeated twice as she asks, [...] "So, what happens now?" [...] and wonders about her immediate future, ultimately concluding that she would survive. For the second verse, the lyrics reflect on this recurring pattern of being evicted out of men's lives, and the final verses have a more positive outlook toward's the subject's life. The song finishes with the mistress asking the question, [...] "Where am I going to?" [...] as <b>a</b> <b>male</b> <b>voice</b> pacifies by saying, [...] "Don't ask, anymore".

500|$|The {{development}} of the series began with the production pilot episode, written by Graham Duff and produced by Baby Cow Productions in March 2003. The episode, which eventually became [...] "Night of the Vegetarians", featured much of the final cast, but {{with a number of}} differences: a different actor played Rory, and Sir Ronald Rolands was voiced by Duff, while Gemini originally had two voices: a female voice played by Julia Dalkin, and <b>a</b> <b>male</b> <b>voice</b> by Nicholas Briggs. Malcolm Boyle - who wrote the Nebulous theme and edited the pilot - had written an entire original score for the show. However, due to BBC radio budget limitations, this was not used in the completed series. Nicholas Briggs had also originally created a very deep, realistic soundscape, similar to those he had created for the Big Finish Productions Doctor Who audioplays, but was advised that [...] "it's likely the listener will have distractions and will not listen to it more than once; therefore, the soundscape must be totally accessible from any point in the episode", toning down the sound effects to match the series' comic nature.|$|E
500|$|While El Broide of People Magazine {{wrote that}} the single is {{performed}} in English and French, website Aficia's Valentin Malfroy noted that Spanish is also incorporated, also pointing out <b>a</b> <b>male</b> <b>voice</b> providing vocals for the refrain sung with a strong African accent. However, {{in an interview with}} Romanian station Kiss FM, Inna explained that the chorus is written in a language created by her and her label Global Records, further stating that, [...] "At Global Records, we stay so much together that we don't understand ourselves in Romanian, but also not in any other language. So we thought to create an own language. If the ones from Game of Thrones can do it, then why can't we do it as well?" [...] People Magazine called the track a [...] "catchy" [...] tropical house song that [...] "effortlessly blends together" [...] tropical sounds with a Middle Eastern flair, along with [...] "simple and cheesy" [...] lyrics. Jonathan Currinn from Outlet Magazine labelled [...] "Heaven" [...] an [...] "exotic anthem", while Urban.ro called it a dance-pop song with exotic elements. Radio 21 noted that the track seemed to be influenced by Arabic rhythms.|$|E
