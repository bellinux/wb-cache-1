40|$|Abstract- The photograph-signature {{scheme is}} widely used in many day-to-day transactions, such as in {{passport}} application and others. This paper proposes to embed the handwritten signature into passport size photograph using watermarking technique. The signature {{is embedded in the}} photograph, and thus protected from all attempts to copy it. The watermarking methods used guarantee that the photograph is not altered in any disturbing manner and signature is extracted efficiently and exactly later. The embedded photograph can then be used as <b>authentication</b> <b>document.</b> An algorithm for signature embedding and extraction has been developed and implemented. The system has been verified using several images and satisfactory results have been observed...|$|E

Number of applications {{has been found in}} various fields like copyright protection, content <b>authentication,</b> <b>document</b> annotation, medical imaging. So, an enhanced semi-blind, hybrid digital image watermarking scheme based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and singular value decomposition (SVD) is our proposed approach in this paper. To increase and control the strength of the watermark, we used a scale factor. our proposed approach, the watermark is not embedded directly on the wavelet coefficients but rather than watermark wavelet coefficient are inserted on singular values of the cover images with modifying wavelet transform (DWT) HL 1 sub band. Experimental results clearly show that this proposed scheme is quite resilient to various image processing attacks...|$|E

We present a new type of methods for hiding data in Microsoft Word documents, named as Property coding, which deploys properties of different document objects (e. g., characters, paragraphs, and sentences) for embedding data. We give four different ways of Property coding, which are resistant to save actions, introduce very small overhead on the document size (about 1 %), can embed up to 8 bits per character, and of course, are unnoticed by readers.

40|$|AbstractIn {{almost all}} watermarking-based <b>document</b> <b>authentication</b> systems, the <b>documents</b> are {{considered}} as binary images and then, the watermark is embedded using some image watermarking algorithm. However actually important documents are saved using document file formats, such as Portable Document Format (PDF) or Open Document Format (ODF), among others, because {{in general the}} file size is smaller compared with an image file, and also these are considered as more secure than other types of file format. However, the documents with these formats can also be maliciously modified for illegal purposes, making necessary the development of mechanisms {{that are able to}} detect such modifications. Considering the situations mentioned above, this paper proposes a <b>document</b> <b>authentication</b> scheme in which a watermark is directly embedded into the document file format as part of the document itself.

40|$|Abstract — Integrity {{of digital}} {{documents}} {{is a very}} important issue {{if they are to be}} legally binding. Common solutions, like digital signatures or message authentication codes, are based on cryptography and require computers or similar hardware to be produced. They can be trusted only as long as the employed hardware can be trusted. We present a complementary scheme for <b>document</b> <b>authentication</b> in untrusted environment. The scheme combines visual authentication, human-recognizable watermarks, and image transformations, and is suitable also for larger text document. Because it relies on visual cryptography, it requires practically no computational power on the receiver side. To prevent potential attackers from obtaining signatures without author’s knowledge, we propose using a simple challenge-response protocol.

5000|$|With {{the onset}} of the Internet and {{electronic}} equipment such as the personal computers and cell-phones, legal instruments or formal legal documents have undergone a progressive change of dematerialisation. In this electronic age, <b>document</b> <b>authentication</b> can now be verified digitally using various software. All <b>documents</b> needing <b>authentication</b> can be processed as digital documents with all the necessary information such as date and time stamp imbedded. To prevent tampering or unauthorized changes to the original document, encryption is used. In modern times, authentication is no longer limited to the type of paper used, the specialized seal, stamps, etc., as <b>document</b> <b>authentication</b> software helps secure the original context. The use of electronic legal documents is most prominent in the United States' courts. Most United States' courts prefer the filing of electronic legal documents over paper. However, there is not yet a public law to unify the different standards of <b>document</b> <b>authentication.</b> Therefore, one must know the court's requirement before filing court papers.|$|R

A robust <b>document</b> <b>authentication</b> scheme is proposed using a skeleton-based text image hash function. The algorithm is aimed at producing sufficiently randomized outputs which are unpredictable, thereby yielding required properties of image hashing. In the verification stage, the deskewing mechanism base on Hough transform is used {{to compensate for the}} distortions induced by rotation or hardcopy operations. Experimental results show that this technique withstands standard benchmark (e. g., Stirmark) attacks, including compression, geometric distortions of scaling and small-angle rotation and common image processing operations.

Surface shapes of films of 31 genuine documents and 29 counterfeit documents were measured by using a white light interferometer. Differences between the surface features of a genuine security document and those of a counterfeit one were studied. Roughness and peak–valley density were the two features used to characterize the measured surface shape. Only 2 out of 29 counterfeit documents could not be distinguished from the genuine ones by film distortion analysis. The likelihood ratio of this method in the <b>authentication</b> of genuine <b>documents</b> was 14. 5.

One of the major problems that our society faces is {{the ease with which}} dishonest people can forge official documents. Although modern cryptography can deal with this security issue in the case of electronic documents, it cannot be applied to the case of printed documents. Classical ways to secure a printed document are expensive and usually do not protect the document's content itself. In this thesis, we address the above problems by developing new low-cost methods that can be applied to both electronic and printed text documents.
