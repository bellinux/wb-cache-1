Cooney remarked, [...] "To be frank, I was really surprised, because {{we thought we were}} creating the quintessential American show.

This was a reference to the May 1970 Mississippi state commission decision to ban the series.

50|$|In its infancy, {{television}} was a time-dependent, fleeting medium; it acted {{on the schedule}} of the institutions that broadcast the television signal or operated the cable. Fans of regular shows planned their schedules {{so that they could}} be available to watch their shows at their time of broadcast. The term <b>appointment</b> <b>television</b> was coined by marketers to describe this kind of attachment.|$|E

"If {{something}} {{has been missing}} from your TV screen since [...] "24" [...] went off the air, like an unapologetic, fist-pumping, nonstop action thriller with compelling good guys and loathsome bad guys, Cinemax's new [...] "Strike Back" [...] needs to be your <b>appointment</b> <b>television</b> for the next 10 weeks. It would be plenty good enough if [...] "Strike Back" [...] were just a TV reincarnation of all those Steven Seagalaction flicks from a few years back. Because, sadly, the industry seems to {{have given up on}} that kind of popcorn thriller, figuring the audience either prefers special effects or is playing video games."

50|$|On December 1, 2011, it was {{announced}} that Phelps run in the television industry was coming to end, and that she would be replaced as General Hospitals executive producer by former One Life to Live executive producer Frank Valentini. In January 2012, Phelps accepted a position as executive producer of Hollywood Heights, a night-time soap opera airing on Nick at Nite. On July 26, 2012, Sony Pictures Television, which produced Hollywood Heights, announced Phelps had been named executive producer of The Young and the Restless. Phelps was dismissed in June 2016, following the <b>appointment</b> of British <b>television</b> producer, Mal Young.|$|R
5000|$|Sarandos uses {{algorithms}} at Netflix {{to predict}} what programs viewers will want to watch prior to producing them. His personal algorithm focuses on 30% judgement (as a highest priority), with 70% focused on a base of data. He {{also said that the}} focus is on the audience, and that there is no programming grid - or <b>appointment</b> linear-based <b>television</b> - that is typically used by traditional TV networks. Barometers of success are if the audience completes watching the show, the timeframe within which they finish watching a series if there is social media buzz by critics and fans. Sarandos said that the preference is for show to run for multiple seasons and build a fan base. Sarandos believes the model allows the viewer to be in control, and to watch only the content they enjoy. The more serialized the show is, the longer the revenue stream. Sarandos sees cost per hour basis as greater the more total run time there is across the lifetime of a show, as it is often not cost savings to produce less original content once production is underway.|$|R

We thought the Muppets were quintessentially American, and it turns out they're the most international characters ever created". Mike Dann, a former CBS executive whom Cooney had hired as a CTW vice-president and her assistant, was assigned to field offers from other countries to produce their own versions of Sesame Street. Dann's <b>appointment</b> led to <b>television</b> critic Marvin Kitman stating, [...] "After he [...] sells [...] in Russia and Czechoslovakia, he might try Mississippi, where it is considered too controversial for educational TV".|$|R
5000|$|The A.V. Club {{rated the}} episode a [...] "B-" [...] and praised it for its {{character}} development, particularly that of Skye, while {{stating that the}} show still needed to [...] "find a way to balance plot acceleration with character development" [...] and that [...] "The agents {{talk about how they}} are a family and need each other, but those personal bonds aren’t fully formed yet. If S.H.I.E.L.D. is going to deliver truly powerful stories, it needs {{to find a way to}} define those relationships and deliver spectacular action." [...] IGN reviewer Eric Goldman gave [...] "T.A.H.I.T.I" [...] a score of 7.7, with the verdict [...] "SHIELD is still not the <b>appointment</b> <b>television</b> program I want it to be, even as it stumbles in the right direction. The introduction of Garrett and some more notable elements added to the Coulson mystery are nice touches. Now if they can just get us to love the core characters as much as we're told they love each other..." ...|$|E

5000|$|The writers {{began to}} focus more {{attention}} on the series' mythology when Akiva Goldsman temporarily joined Fringe to write and direct a mid-season episode, [...] "Bad Dreams". Believing [...] "this is the stuff fans want to know", he and Bryan Burk were able to convince the other series writers to begin revealing the concept of parallel universes, despite the writers' initial intention to merely tease the idea of two worlds over two seasons. They also attempted to make Olivia's personal life more relatable by ending her storyline with John Scott and giving her a sister and niece. Abrams noted that Olivia was evolving from a [...] "guarded, protective woman" [...] {{who did not have}} strong relationships with others to someone more vulnerable; the presence of Olivia's sister, he noted, helped give the character [...] "at least opportunities to be warmer to someone." [...] By the middle of the season, critics and regular viewers noted Fringe had started to improve. Kevin Reilly observed around this time, [...] "I was looking for evidence that it was becoming their favorite show. And it was during the back half of the season that people started to say, 'This is now <b>appointment</b> <b>television</b> for me." ...|$|E
5000|$|Robert Lloyd of the Los Angeles Times {{noted that}} the series was {{produced}} by executive and creative personnel [...] "whose combined credits include {{what seems to be}} every major network soap opera of the last 50 years as well as 21st-century reality soaps such as The Hills and The City." [...] He wrote, [...] "If Heights is not particularly novel—it is, after all, based on a series two decades old—neither does it reek of must and mildew. Nor do the musical performances seem contrived, or rather they seem authentically contrived, staged as they would be staged by a performer like Eddie, who deals in thumping aspirational party anthems." [...] Lloyd added, [...] "what Ive seen, if not exactly <b>appointment</b> <b>television</b> for a person of my age and interests, is pretty appealing; by the standards of most other TV shows about teens and pop stars, it is well observed, well informed and (so far) plausible." [...] Joe Caramanica of The New York Times wrote, [...] "Even though the melodrama, highly structured scripting and stilted camera shots are indebted to the telenovela form, Hollywood Heights owes the most to the rat-tat-tat rhythms of Gilmore Girls." [...] Ed Martin of MediaPost.com noted that creatively the series [...] "so far has been a bit on the safe and sterile side, even more than Degrassi and certainly more than the often quite edgy fare on ABC Family." [...] Varietys Brian Lowry wrote that though Hollywood Heights was [...] "tailored to Nickelodeons demo with a musical component and teen-tempting leads ... For a show with a pop undercurrent that proclaims itself sizzling, Heights is pretty tepid and lacks a hit song’s most basic element: A catchy hook." [...] Suggesting that daily episodes were difficult to reasonably keep up with, Caramanica still called it [...] "comfort TV with narrative soul." [...] Martin agreed that daily episodes [...] "may be too much of a demand to place on potential viewers in the new media world of ever-increasing competition and ever-shrinking attention spans." ...|$|E
