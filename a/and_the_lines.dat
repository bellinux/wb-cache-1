5|$|For the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building, {{which opened}} in 1991, Tange {{designed}} a large civic centre with a plaza dominated by two skyscrapers. These house the administration offices whilst a smaller seven-storey building contains assembly facilities. In his design of a high tech version of Kofu Communications Centre, Tange equipped all three buildings with state-of-the-art building management systems that monitored air quality, light levels and security. The external skin of the building makes dual references to both tradition and the modern condition. Tange incorporated vertical and horizontal lines reminiscent of both timber boarding <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> on semiconductor boards.|$|E
5|$|The {{originality}} of {{this document}} remains {{a matter of}} debate. Hans K. Schulze and Hans Goetting believe that the document was presented by Otto II at their wedding feast, and then given to Theophanu. Interpreter Walter Deeters says that the separations in the text act as reading aids, showing that the document {{was intended to be}} read. Diplomats Theodor von Sickel and Carlrichard Brühl believe that the document is not the original as it lacks a seal <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> are unusually shaped.|$|E

50|$|In 1942, {{the company}} was {{forcibly}} merged by the government with Tokyu Corporation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> was named <b>the</b> Tokyu Odawara <b>Line.</b> Tokyu was broken up in 1948 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> {{was transferred to the}} newly founded Odakyu Electric Railway Co.|$|R
5|$|Work on Valperga's {{modifications}} to the lines progressed slowly, and {{by the beginning of}} the 18th century the outworks, glacis and enceinte facing Marsamxett were still unfinished. Works continued under a number of other engineers, including Charles François de Mondion, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> were largely complete when Porte des Bombes was constructed in 1721. Further alterations were made over the following decades, such as the construction of the Northern Entrenchment in the 1730s.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Railways Act 1921, on 1 January 1923 the North Eastern Railway became the North Eastern area of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). The {{passenger}} service was withdrawn north of Tow Law on 1 May 1939. Britain's railways were nationalised on 1 January 1948 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> were placed under the control of British Railways. In the early 1950s control was split between the North Eastern and London Midland regions with Kirkby Stephen as the boundary. Local passenger trains were withdrawn between Kirkby Stephen and Tebay on 1 December 1952. The service along Weardale was withdrawn on 29 June 1953 and services north of Crook on 11 June 1956.|$|E
5|$|By 1901 Adelaide's horse trams {{were seen}} by the public as a blot on the city's image. With a {{population}} of 162,000 the slow speed of the trams, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> subsequent low traffic capacity, made them inadequate for public transport needs. The unsealed roads the horses required became quagmires in winter and sources of dust in summer. The 10pounds of manure each horse left behind daily, was also not well regarded. Under these various pressures the government negotiated to purchase the horse tramway companies. A 28 March 1906 newspaper notice announced {{that the government had}} purchased all of the city tramways for £280,000. Bill No.913, passed 22 December 1906, created the Municipal Tramways Trust (MTT) with the authority to build new and purchase existing tramways.|$|E
50|$|From the {{following}} year, shale oil was extracted in <b>the</b> area, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> became very successful from that traffic. Other railways joined at Bathgate <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> later {{became part of}} a through route from Edinburgh to Glasgow via Airdrie.|$|R
25|$|An {{oriented}} {{contact element}} in the plane is a pair consisting of a point and an oriented (i.e., directed) line through that point. <b>The</b> point <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> are incident cycles. The key observation is that the set of all cycles incident with both <b>the</b> point <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> is a Lie invariant object: in addition to <b>the</b> point <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> it consists of all the circles which make oriented contact with <b>the</b> <b>line</b> at <b>the</b> given point. It is called a pencil of Lie cycles, or simply a contact element.|$|R
50|$|Sakado station - <b>The</b> 14km Katsuta <b>line</b> {{was opened}} by the Chikuzen Sangu Railway Co. from Yusu (on <b>the</b> Sasaguri <b>Line)</b> - Chikuzenkatsuta in 1918-19. The {{connection}} to Sakado opened in 1942, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> was nationalised in 1944. Freight service ceased in 1981, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> closed in 1985.|$|R
5|$|By {{the end of}} the month, the Serb {{rebels and}} the JNA {{controlled}} nearly all of the southern bank of the river, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> of control in the region largely stabilised. Before the ceasefire of 3 January 1992, which implemented the Vance plan, the Serb rebels and the JNA made two more unsuccessful attempts to push back the Croatian forces in the region. These attacks comprised the autumn campaign undertaken by the JNA—in the area of Slana and Novi Farkašić on 17–18 October and in the area of Sunja on 2 November. In the same period, the ZNG launched an unsuccessful offensive codenamed Operation Whirlwind to recapture Glina on 11–13 December. The 120 Croats who remained in the area of Dubica faced persecution, culminating in the Baćin massacre of more than 50 Croats on 21 October, and the rounding up and expulsion of the remainder on 20 November.|$|E
5|$|Construction began before {{completion}} of the design for the gaseous diffusion process. Due to {{the large amount of}} electric power that the K-25 plant was expected to consume, it was decided to provide it with its own electric power plant. While the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) believed that it could supply the Clinton Engineer Works' needs, there was unease about relying on a single supplier when a power failure could cost the gaseous diffusion plant weeks of work, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> to TVA could be sabotaged. A local plant was more secure. The Kellex engineers were also attracted to the idea of being able to generate the variable frequency current required by the gaseous diffusion process without complicated transformers.|$|E
5|$|If {{they could}} quickly capture the Esdraelon Plain {{while the two}} Ottoman armies were {{fighting}} in the Judean Hills against the XXI Corps infantry in the Battle of Sharon, and the XX Corps infantry in the Battle of Nablus, the railways could be cut, the roads controlled, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> of retreat across the plain for these two Ottoman armies west of the Jordan would be virtually cut. Success depended on the rapid capture of the communications hub at Afulah and the Yildirim Army Group's general headquarters at Nazareth which would disrupt communication and simultaneously almost surround the Eighth Army and cut the communications and supply lines to both the Seventh and Eighth Armies in the Judean Hills. (See Falls Map 21 below which shows these cavalry advances.) Success required that the cavalry not only capture but hold Afulah, Nazareth, and the Esdraelon Plain for some time. The men and horses of three cavalry divisions would be dependent on rations being quickly and efficiently transported forward many miles from their base.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> C&OR <b>line</b> was to {{be closed}} {{completely}} on 1 November 1965, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Killin branch with it. In fact there was a serious rockfall on <b>the</b> C&OR <b>line</b> in Glen Ogle on 27 September 1965, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> was impassable; clearing <b>the</b> <b>line</b> was unaffordable, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> never re-opened. <b>The</b> Killin branch closed prematurely on the next day.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} control the process, other {{parameters}} should be introduced as extra-coordinates, in particular the laser power q <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> velocity V. Thus the parametric solution involves the space coordinates, the number of plies, <b>the</b> laser power <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> velocity, i.e. u(x,y,λ,p,q,V).|$|R
50|$|Yusu Station: The 14 km Katsuta Line {{was opened}} by the Chikuzen Sangu Railway Co. to Chikuzenkatsuta between 1918 and 1919. A {{connection}} to Sakado on <b>the</b> Kashii <b>Line</b> opened in 1942, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> was nationalised in 1944.

5|$|In 1954, Regional Plan Association {{advocated}} for {{an extension of}} the BMT Canarsie Line from Eighth Avenue to Jersey City under the Hudson River. The tunnel under the Hudson would have cost $40,000,000. The extension would have provided access to commuter railroads in New Jersey as most lines converged there, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> that didn't would be rerouted to stop there. The RPA also suggested having a parking lot there for access from the Pulaski Skyway and the New Jersey Turnpike. It was suggested that either the New York City Transit Authority, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey or the Bi-State Metropolitan Rapid Transit Commission would do the construction.|$|E
5|$|In April 1901, the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad {{announced}} track {{depression and}} raising throughout {{portions of the}} line through Newark and the Oranges. Although the depression went into Newark, most {{of the debate over}} localities of stations was basically into the Oranges. In 1903, the track depression reached the Roseville Avenue Station, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> were depressed through Roseville. The new station built during the track depression was of similar style, with the station {{in the middle of the}} five-track interlocking, with one platform servicing the Montclair Branch's two tracks and one for the Main Line's two tracks. Rather than crossing at-grade, Roseville Avenue was bridged over the tracks with a brand new street-level interlocking tower present at the intersection of Roseville and Seventh Avenues.|$|E
5|$|Major railway routes through Sheffield {{railway station}} include the Midland Main Line, which links {{the city to}} London via the East Midlands, the Cross Country Route which links the East of Scotland and Northeast of England with the West Midlands and the Southwest, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> linking Liverpool and Manchester with Hull and East Anglia. With the {{redevelopment}} of London St Pancras station (now St Pancras International) complete, Sheffield has a direct connection to continental Europe. East Midlands Trains run services to St Pancras International and Eurostar run services from there to France and Belgium. The Master Cutler, a named passenger express train running from Sheffield railway station to London St Pancras, provides a direct connection to the capital.|$|E

50|$|For instance, <b>the</b> circle <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> {{are very}} {{different}} objects. One cannot stretch the circle to look like <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> nor compress <b>the</b> <b>line</b> to fit on the circle without gaps or overlaps. However, {{a small piece of}} the circle can be stretched and flattened out to look like a small piece of <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> For this reason, one may say that <b>the</b> circle <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> are locally equivalent.|$|R
50|$|The Ashio Railway Co. opened <b>the</b> <b>line</b> to Ashio-Motoyama (2km beyond Mato) in 1911/12 {{to service}} the Ashio Copper Mine, <b>and</b> leased <b>the</b> <b>line</b> to JNR in 1913.

5|$|Napoleon had {{previously}} sent dispatches to Marshal Soult, {{commander of the}} Army of the South, urging him to send assistance to Masséna in Portugal. However, the Emperor's orders, which called for only a small force, were based on outdated intelligence and the situation had changed considerably by the time Soult received them. Thirty thousand Allied troops and six major fortresses now stood between the French army and the Portuguese capital, making an attack against Lisbon virtually impossible. Nevertheless, compelled to act, Soult instead gathered an army of 20,000 men, mainly from VCorps, and launched an expedition into Extremadura {{with the aim of}} capturing the Spanish fortress at Badajoz, thereby drawing some of the Allied forces away from Masséna <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lines</b> of Torres Vedras.|$|E
5|$|On 28 March, the Greek Central Macedonia Army Section—comprising the 12th and 20th Infantry Divisions—were {{put under}} the command of General Wilson, who {{established}} his headquarters to the north-west of Larissa. The New Zealand division took position north of Mount Olympus, while the Australian division blocked the Haliacmon valley up to the Vermion range. The RAF continued to operate from airfields in Central and Southern Greece; however, few planes could be diverted to the theater. The British forces were near to fully motorised, but their equipment was more suited to desert warfare than to Greece's steep mountain roads. They were short of tanks and anti-aircraft guns <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> of communication across the Mediterranean were vulnerable, because each convoy had to pass close to Axis-held islands in the Aegean; despite the British Royal Navy's domination of the Aegean Sea. These logistical problems were aggravated by the limited availability of shipping and Greek port capacity.|$|E
5|$|The {{technologies}} of deep tube tunnelling and electric traction pioneered and proved by the C shaped {{the direction of}} subsequent underground railways built in London. The C demonstrated that an underground railway could be constructed without the need to purchase large and expensive tracts of land for the shallow cuttings of sub-surface steam operated railways. Instead, it became possible to construct a tunnel at deep level without adversely affecting conditions on the surface. The C thus encouraged {{the construction of a}} network of underground railways in London, far larger than might have been the case otherwise. The size and depth of the tunnels used on the deep tube lines, including the Northern line, does have drawbacks: the tunnels have a limited loading gauge <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> suffer from overheating in the summer.|$|E
