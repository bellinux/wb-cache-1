40|$|Definition: Facilitation of a family’s {{expression}} of {{thoughts and feelings}} about loss and coping with a relative’s illness and death to promote shared grief and optimal family functioning, often commenced during palliative care (with the ill relative attending) and continued into bereavement after the patient’s death. Elements: High-risk families may be screened with the Family Relationships Index regarding communication, cohesion and conflict resolution. To prevent maladaptive outcomes, a family therapist leads family sessions through i) assessment and agreement about the focus of work, ii) active therapy, and iii) consolidation and termination. Treatment takes 6 - 12 sessions, each lasting 90 minutes, and extending over 6 - 18 months, with later consolidation sessions spaced more widely. Length of treatment depends on degree of family dysfunction. The therapist uses circular questioning [‘Let me <b>ask</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> to describe who gets on best with whom?’] and confirmatory summaries to: discern patterns of communication, teamwork and conflict, role delineation, traditions, and transgenerational styles of relating; affirm strengths of family life; encourag...|$|E

Historians have noted that John F. Kennedy in the early 1960s explicitly called upon {{the ideas of the}} frontier. At his acceptance speech on July 15, 1960, Kennedy called out to the American people, [...] "I am <b>asking</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> to be new pioneers on that New Frontier. My call is to the young in heart, regardless of age—to the stout in spirit, regardless of party." [...] Mathiopoulos notes that he [...] "cultivated this resurrection of frontier ideology as a motto of progress ('getting America moving') throughout his term of office." [...] He promoted his political platform as the [...] "New Frontier," [...] with a particular emphasis on space exploration and technology. Limerick points out that Kennedy assumed that [...] "the campaigns of the Old Frontier had been successful, and morally justified." [...] The [...] "frontier" [...] metaphor thus maintained its rhetorical ties to American social progress. The frontier thesis {{is one of the most}} influential documents on the American west today.|$|R

Karen Dawson on January 09, 2004, 05 : 03 PM: What a juicy question with which to begin. Hi gang, I'm going to be brave and just jump in. An effective leader is courageous, self-aware, a learner, a listener, and cares about making {{the world a better place}} [...] . no matter what part of the world that might be. I think I'll stop there. Feeling rather like I could go on but I don't want to piss you off before we've even really started. Judy Lorinczi on January 09, 2004, 05 : 03 PM: Hi Anne! I recently engaged in an e-dialogue where I described my impression of what the characteristics of leaders are. This is what I came up with: Leaders are all around us. They are people from all walks of life whose engaging influence can stir within us the emergence of sometimes previously dormant emotions. Leaders may inspire us to such degree that we can surprise ourselves with the powerful engagement of our emotion...|$|R
40|$|The {{practical}} {{objectives of}} this course are [1] {{to get a}} sense of the kinds of questions about the Quaker experience in East Asia we can ask and answer from the archival material at Haverford and at the AFSC Friends Center in Philadelphia; and [2] to provide each student an opportunity to write an original research paper based on those archives. We begin with two weeks devoted to overviews of the Quaker involvement in China and Japan (Weeks 2 - 3). Thereafter most of the assignments will <b>ask</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> to explore relevant archival collections on the Quakers in Japan and China before, during, and after the war. Each of these classes (Weeks 4 - 8) will include discussion of a handful of shared readings followed by your reports on archival sources surveyed in the week leading up to the class. With the help of Sarah Horowitz and Ann Upton I have provided some guideposts of where to look, but you are encouraged to follow any sources that look interesting. In each case you should make full use of the archival guides, as indicated below. You are asked to keep a reading log briefly identifying what material you skimmed and describing the nuggets in greater detail. A sample format for the log will be provided, and all the logs will be submitted (in print and digitally) on 11 / 14. Your log should include the results of Week 9, when we visit the AFSC archives at the Friends Center as a class, to view holdings on AFSC Foreign Service and the Friends Ambulance Unit...|$|E
