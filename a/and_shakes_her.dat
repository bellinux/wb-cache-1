6000|$|I {{speak of}} ancient times, {{for now the}} swain [...] Returning late may pass the woods in vain, [...] And never hope to see the nightly train: [...] In vain the dairy now with mints is dress'd, [...] The dairymaid expects no fairy guest, [...] 20 [...] To skim the bowls, and after pay the feast. [...] She sighs <b>and</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> empty shoes in vain, [...] No silver penny to reward her pain: [...] For priests, with prayers, and other godly gear, [...] Have made the merry goblins disappear; [...] And where they play'd their merry pranks before, [...] Have {{sprinkled}} holy water on the floor: [...] And friars, that through the wealthy regions run, [...] Thick as the motes that twinkle in the sun, [...] Resort to farmers rich, and bless their halls, [...] 30 [...] And exorcise the beds, and cross the walls: [...] This makes the fairy quires forsake the place, [...] When once 'tis hallow'd with the rites of grace: [...] But in the walks where wicked elves have been, [...] The learning of the parish now is seen, [...] The midnight parson, posting o'er the green, [...] With gown tuck'd up, to wakes, for Sunday next, [...] With humming ale encouraging his text; [...] Nor wants the holy leer to country girl betwixt. [...] From fiends and imps he sets the village free, [...] 40 [...] There haunts not any incubus but he.

6000|$|... "'How dreadful ill {{and weak}} she do look, don't she?' says Emmy. Before I could say {{as much as}} 'Yes,' she stares up at us, and asks in a wild voice, though it wasn't very loud either, if we can tell her the way to Bangbury workhouse. Having pretty sharp eyes of our own, we both of us knew that a workhouse was no fit place for her. Her gown was very dusty, {{and one of her}} boots was burst, and her hair was draggled all over her face, and her eyes was sunk in her head, like; but we saw somehow that she was a lady--or, if she wasn't exactly a lady, that no workhouse was proper for her, at any rate. I stooped down to speak to her; but her baby was crying so dreadful she could hardly hear me. 'Is the poor thing ill?' says I. 'Starving,' says she, in such a desperate, fierce way, that it gave me a turn. 'Is that your child?' says I, a bit frightened about how she'd answer me. 'Yes,' she says in quite a new voice, very soft and sorrowful, and bending her face away from me over the child. 'Then why don't you suckle it?' says I. She looks up at me, and then at Jenny <b>and</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> head, and says nothing. I give my baby to Jemmy to hold, and went and sat down by her. He walked away a little; and I whispered to her again, 'Why don't you suckle it?' and she whispered to me, 'My milk's all dried up. I couldn't wait to hear no more till I'd got her baby at my own breast.|$|E
