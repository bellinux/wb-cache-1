5|$|Brooks was {{assigned}} three prominent Minstrel <b>attorneys,</b> <b>and</b> {{after a year}} of sitting on the docket, at about 11 AM on April 15, 1874, Baxter's demurrer to Brook's complaint was suddenly called up. Neither of Baxter's lawyers were present in the court room, and the demurrer had been submitted without their knowledge. Without giving Baxter any time to testify, Judge Whytock overruled the demurrer and awarded Brooks $2,000 in damages and the office of Governor of Arkansas. Neither Brooks nor the court notified the legislature or Governor Baxter. Judge Wytock then swore in Joseph Brooks as the new governor of Arkansas, despite having no authority to do so.|$|E

5|$|As {{the first}} President, Washington was {{responsible}} for appointing the entire Supreme Court. Due to this, he filled more vacancies on the Court than any other president in American history. In September 1789, Washington nominated John Jay as the first Chief Justice and nominated John Rutledge, William Cushing, James Wilson, John Blair, and Robert Harrison as Associate Justices. All were quickly confirmed by the Senate, but after Harrison declined the appointment, Washington appointed James Iredell in 1790. The Court’s first term began on February 2, 1790, at the Royal Exchange in New York City. However, with no cases on the docket and little pressing business (a few procedural matters decided and 26 <b>attorneys</b> <b>and</b> counselors admitted to the federal bar), the term lasted for only eight days.|$|E

40|$|This {{is not a}} book. It is a {{collection}} of articles from various sources. Nor should you be deceived by the title. It does not deal with the subject of <b>attorney</b> <b>and</b> client in any general way; rather its focus is far narrower. Most of the included articles concern <b>attorney</b> <b>and</b> corporate client privilege as it is applied to a corporation under regulatory investigation. Therefore, {{if you are looking for}} a book on <b>attorney</b> <b>and</b> client privilege, this is not the one...|$|R

5|$|On May 24, Judge Singleterry heard {{arguments}} from the plaintiff {{and the defense}} on the request for the change of venue. On June 7, he denied {{a request for a}} change of venue after considering that the defendant failed to prove that there was prejudice against him in the Hidalgo community. On July 19, Feit appeared in court for a prehearing. The trial was expected to place on September 11. However, on September 10, the court decided to push the trial due to scheduling conflicts with one of the <b>attorneys</b> <b>and</b> because of delays in another high-profile case in the Hidalgo County. Feit appeared in court on September 11 – for the first time without prison uniform – expecting to face trial that week. The initial phase of jury selection was done in mid-September; the trial was pushed for mid-October.|$|E
5|$|The {{court can}} appoint retired judges, lawyers, and other judges to serve {{temporarily}} as judges {{at any level}} in Oregon. They can also appoint senior judges to serve on any state court at or below {{the highest level of}} court that judge had served on before retirement or resignation. The state supreme court is responsible for admitting new lawyers to practice in Oregon, disciplining <b>attorneys,</b> <b>and</b> appointing members to the Board of Bar Examiners. This board of a minimum of fourteen members is responsible for administering the bar exam and screening prospective lawyers before admitting applicants to practice law in Oregon. Oversight of state judges is also {{in the hands of the}} Supreme Court. The Commission on Judicial Fitness and Disability investigates all reports of abuses and makes recommendations to the Supreme Court on any actions that may need to occur. The Supreme Court can then suspend judges, censure them, remove them from office, or take no action.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} years of Garrard's second term were {{relatively}} uneventful, but in the 1802 General Assembly, legislators approved two bills related to the circuit court system that Garrard vetoed. The first bill expanded the number of courts and provided that untrained citizens could sit as judges in the court system. Garrard questioned the cost of the additional courts and the wisdom of allowing untrained judges on the bench; he also objected to the bill's circumvention of the governor's authority to appoint judges. The second bill allowed <b>attorneys</b> <b>and</b> judges in the circuit court system to reside outside the districts they served. The General Assembly overrode Garrard's second veto, marking the first time in Kentucky history that a gubernatorial veto was overridden and the only time during Garrard's eight-year tenure.|$|E

5|$|The {{trials were}} delayed {{due to the}} {{difficulties}} in bringing together witnesses, prosecutors, defense <b>attorneys,</b> <b>and</b> interpreters. The proceedings finally began in August 1828, with Judge James Duane Doty presiding. Wau-koo-kau and Man-ne-tah-peh-keh, the two warriors imprisoned for the 1826 murders of the Methode family, were released {{due to a lack}} of witnesses, as were three Ho-Chunks held for the attack on the keelboats. Only two men, Wekau and Chickhonsic, were prosecuted. According to historian Patrick Jung, it became clear during the trial that Red Bird had committed the murders at the Gagnier cabin, and that there was not enough evidence to convict Wekau and Chickhonsic. Despite this, the white and métis jury found them guilty. Judge Doty sentenced them to hang, as he was required to do by law. Their lawyer filed a motion for a new trial, arguing that the jury had ignored the evidence, and so Doty suspended the death sentences.|$|E

Pierrepont ran extensive investigations into {{the conduct of the}} U.S. <b>Attorneys</b> <b>and</b> U.S. Marshals, exposing fraud and corruption. Pierrepont was fully sustained by President Grant's endorsement of the investigations, reforms, and persons to be removed and replaced from office.|$|E
