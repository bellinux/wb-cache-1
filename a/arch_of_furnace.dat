40|$|Nowadays, various kind <b>of</b> reactor <b>furnaces</b> {{are widely}} used for the {{production}} in industry. The raw materials charged into the furnace generate reaction heat produced by blowing gas. Generally speaking, the reaction heat generated in the furnace is remarkably high. Therefore the occurrence of an inappropriate temperature distribution in the furnace may make damege or serious accident <b>of</b> the <b>furnace.</b> This is the motivation <b>of</b> <b>furnace</b> control.
