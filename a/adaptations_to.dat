5|$|All Eurasian {{composite}} bows {{derive from}} the same nomad origins, but every culture that used them has made its own <b>adaptations</b> <b>to</b> the basic design. The Turkish, Mongolian, and Korean bows were standardized when archery lost its military function and became a popular sport. Recent Turkish bows are optimized for flight shooting.|$|E
40|$|Development {{of career}} {{goals that are}} adapted to self and {{opportunities}} is a central component of adolescent career preparation. The present longitudinal study (conducted throughout the eighth grade with three assessment points) investigated how 330 Swiss adolescents simultaneously adapt career goals to interests, scholastic achievement and environmental opportunities. Results demonstrated that students increasingly adapt their goals to the environment. Mean <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> environment related positively to degree of adaption to interests and achievement. Increased <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> environment over time related <b>to</b> increased <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> achievement but <b>to</b> decreased <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> interests. Gender, attended school type and nationality moderated adaptation processes. Structurally disadvantaged students (girls, lower requirements school track, immigrant students) reported more conflict in aligning <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> environment with <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> interests...|$|R
40|$|First {{semester}} {{college students}} (N= 139) were surveyed {{to assess the}} role of family structure, family conflict, family coping, and individual coping on adjustment to college. Family conflict and family coping were related <b>to</b> <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> college. Individual coping also significantly correlated with <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> college. Results support a mediational model linking family coping, individual coping, and <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> college...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> radial and {{rotational}} polar optic flow on {{the classification of}} noisy test patterns are shown to be {{very similar to the}} effects of <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> polar Glass patterns on the classification of noisy Glass patterns (Clifford, C. W. G. & Weston, E. (2005). Aftereffect of <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> Glass patterns. Vision Research, 45 1355 – 1363.). In both cases there is a large shift in the signal strength at which test patterns are classified as radial or rotational with equal probability. Two asymmetries were discovered: (1) <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> optic flow alters the classification of Glass patterns, but the reverse is not true; and (2) <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> Glass patterns decreases detectability of patterns of the same type, but <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> optic flow has little effect on the detectability of patterns of any type. We conclude that the mechanisms that detect radial and rotational Glass patterns are independent and independently adaptable, but that the mechanisms that detect the path of optic flow, when directional effects are cancelled out, are linked in an opponent, push–pull fashion...|$|R
5|$|Although {{traditionally}} grouped with millipedes and centipedes—possibly on {{the basis}} of convergent <b>adaptations</b> <b>to</b> terrestrialisation—evidence has emerged favoring closer evolutionary ties with crustaceans. In the Pancrustacea theory, insects, together with Entognatha, Remipedia, and Cephalocarida, make up a natural clade labeled Miracrustacea.|$|E
5|$|Beetles, both {{adults and}} larvae, are the prey of many animal predators {{including}} mammals from bats to rodents, birds, lizards, amphibians, fishes, dragonflies, robberflies, reduviid bugs, ants, other beetles, and spiders. Beetles {{use a variety}} of anti-predator <b>adaptations</b> <b>to</b> defend themselves. These include camouflage and mimicry against predators that hunt by sight, toxicity, and defensive behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Insect life-histories show <b>adaptations</b> <b>to</b> {{withstand}} {{cold and}} dry conditions. Some temperate region insects {{are capable of}} activity during winter, while some others migrate to a warmer climate or go {{into a state of}} torpor. Still other insects have evolved mechanisms of diapause that allow eggs or pupae to survive these conditions.|$|E
40|$|This study {{highlights}} {{the relationships between}} learning and study strategies with student <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> college. Postsecondary students (n = 146) completed a demographic questionnaire, the Learning and Study Strategies Inventory (LASSI), and the Student <b>Adaptation</b> <b>to</b> College Questionnaire (SACQ). Students were trifurcated into low, average, and high achieving groups by GPA. Data was analyzed using multiple regression and correlational techniques. LASSI subscales significantly predicted <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> college {{as measured by the}} SACQ for average and high achieving students, but did not significantly predict <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> college for low achieving students. The unique contributions of the LASSI subtests varied in the two significant predictions. Anxiety and attitude significantly contributed to the prediction of <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> college for average achieving students. Anxiety was the only significant contributor for high achieving students. Upon further exploration, anxiety was found to influence distinct facets of student <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> college depending on level of student achievement. Anxiety correlated significantly with personal-emotional adjustment for average achieving students. For high achieving students, anxiety significantly correlated with all four dimensions of student adaptatio...|$|R

5|$|Pterobranchs {{may be a}} {{sub-group}} of enteropneusts ("acorn worms"). This {{suggests that}} the ancestral deuterostome {{looks more like a}} mobile worm-like enteropneust than a sessile colonial pterobranch. The fact that lophophorates and pterobranchs both use tentacles for feeding is probably not a synapomorphy of lophophorates and deuterostomes, but evolved independently as convergent <b>adaptations</b> <b>to</b> a sessile lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|Tiktaalik has a {{possibility}} of being {{a representative of the}} evolutionary transition from fish to amphibians. It is an example from several lines of ancient sarcopterygian fish developing <b>adaptations</b> <b>to</b> the oxygen-poor shallow-water habitats of its time, environmental conditions which are thought to have led to the evolution of tetrapods.|$|E
5|$|A small species, the Inaccessible Island rail has brown plumage {{and a black}} {{bill and}} feet. It {{occupies}} most habitats on Inaccessible Island, from the beaches to the central plateau, feeding {{on a variety of}} small invertebrates and also some plant matter. Pairs are territorial and monogamous, with both parents being responsible for incubating the eggs and raising the chicks. Its <b>adaptations</b> <b>to</b> living on a tiny island at high densities include low base metabolic rates, small clutch sizes, and flightlessness.|$|E
30|$|Achieving an {{acceptable}} pH (≥ 7.20) through either bicarbonate infusion or RRT should mimic the physiological metabolic <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> respiratory acidemia [5, 6].

5|$|A {{study of}} {{seedlings}} grown from seed collected in 28 areas showed a north-south change in leaf shape and dimensions. Seedling leaves get longer and narrower southwards. Seedlings often have leaves with red-brown pigmentation which disappears in older plants, and this coloration becomes increasingly common towards the south. The changes in shape—leaves getting narrower and more robust {{from north to}} south and from lowland to montane—suggest <b>adaptations</b> <b>to</b> colder weather.|$|E
5|$|<b>Adaptations</b> <b>to</b> {{night vision}} include the large {{size of the}} eye, its tubular shape, large numbers of closely packed retinal rods, and an absence of cone cells, since rod cells have {{superior}} light sensitivity. There are few coloured oil drops, which would reduce the light intensity. Unlike diurnal birds of prey, owls normally have only one fovea, and that is poorly developed except in daytime hunters like the short-eared owl.|$|E
5|$|Aetosaur remains {{have been}} found since the early 19th century, {{although}} the very first remains that were described were mistaken for fish scales. Aetosaurs were later recognized as crocodile relatives, with early paleontologists considering them to be semiaquatic scavengers. They are now considered to have been entirely terrestrial animals. Some forms have characteristics {{that may have been}} <b>adaptations</b> <b>to</b> digging for food. There is also evidence that some if not all aetosaurs made nests.|$|E
50|$|Since {{its first}} {{scientific}} publication in 1990 more than 80 articles show tensiomyography use and purpose: in {{the estimation of}} muscle composition; for evaluating muscle atrophy; for measuring <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> different pathologies; for measuring <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> specific training; and for measuring muscle fatigue.|$|R
40|$|The {{responsiveness}} {{of neurons}} {{in the primary}} visual cortex (V 1) is substantially reduced {{after a few seconds}} of visual stimulation with an effective pattern. This phenomenon, called pattern adaptation, is uniquely cortical and is the likely substrate of a variety of perceptual after-effects. While <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> a given pattern reduces the responses of V 1 neurons to all subsequently viewed test patterns, this reduction shows some specificity, being strongest when the adapting and test patterns are identical. This specificity may indicate that adaptation affects the interaction between groups of neurons that are jointly activated by the adapting stimulus. We investigated this possibility by studying the effects of <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> visual patterns containing one or both of two orientations—the preferred orientation for a cell, and the orientation orthogonal to it. Because neurons in the primary visual cortex are sharply tuned for orientation, stimulation with orthogonal orientations excites two largely distinct populations of neurons. With intracellular recordings of the membrane potential of cat V 1 neurons, we found that <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> the orthogonal orientation alone does not evoke the hyperpolarization that is typical of <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> the preferred orientation. With extracellular recordings of the firing rate of macaque V 1 neurons, we found that the responses were not reduced by <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> the orthogonal orientation alone nearly as much as by <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> the preferred orientation. In the macaque we also studied the effects of <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> plaids containing both the preferred and the orthogonal orientations. We found that <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> these stimuli could modify the interactions between orientations. It increased the amount of cross-orientation suppression displayed b...|$|R
40|$|Visuomotor <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> rightward-deviating optical-wedge prisms {{reduces the}} {{clinical}} manifestations of spatial neglect after right hemisphere damage. We investigated whether this beneficial effect of prism <b>adaptation</b> is due <b>to</b> attenuation of the ipsilesional attentional bias that {{is common in}} spatial neglect. Five right hemisphere patients performed visual temporal order judgements before and after visuomotor <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> 15 degrees rightward-deviating prisms. The magnitude of patients 2 ̆ 7 ipsilesional attentional bias on the temporal order judgement task was significantly reduced following adaptation. By contrast, the temporal order judgements of normal participants did not change following <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> either leftward- or rightward-deviating prisms. The findings suggest that prism <b>adaptation</b> helps <b>to</b> rebalance the distribution of spatial attention following right hemisphere damage...|$|R
5|$|Aetosaurs were herbivores, likely {{feeding on}} ferns and seed ferns that were {{common in the}} Triassic. The upturned shape of their snout {{suggests}} that aetosaurs may have dug up roots and tubers. Aetosaurs have several anatomical features {{that may have been}} <b>adaptations</b> <b>to</b> digging, including a short radius relative to the humerus (seen in many other digging tetrapods) and a large deltopectoral crest on the humerus that served as an attachment for muscles. Aetosaurs also have large hind feet, or pes, with large claws that were likely used for skratch-digging. One aetosaur, Typothorax, has an entepicondyle on the humerus, which is the origin of forearm pronator and manual flexor muscles often used in digging. Moreover, it has a large olecranon process on the ulna which projects backward past the elbow, giving a large area for the insertion of the triceps muscle. While many studies have suggested that aetosaurs had a fossorial or burrowing lifestyle, aetosaurs have few of the characteristics that fossorial animals have as <b>adaptations</b> <b>to</b> digging. Therefore, it is likely that aetosaurs were able to dig to some extent, possibly rooting for food, but were unable to burrow.|$|E
5|$|All cacti {{have some}} <b>adaptations</b> <b>to</b> promote {{efficient}} water use. Most cacti—opuntias and cactoids—specialize in surviving in hot and dry environments (i.e. they are xerophytes), {{but the first}} ancestors of modern cacti were already adapted to periods of intermittent drought. A small number of cactus species in the tribes Hylocereeae and Rhipsalideae have become adapted to life as climbers or epiphytes, often in tropical forests, where water conservation is less important.|$|E
5|$|Halfbeaks carry several <b>adaptations</b> <b>to</b> feeding at {{the water}} surface. The eyes and {{nostrils}} {{are at the top}} of the head and the upper jaw is mobile, but not the lower jaw. Combined with their streamlined shape and the concentration of fins towards the back (similar to that of a pike), these adaptations allow halfbeaks to locate, catch, and swallow food items very effectively.|$|E

40|$|Psychosocial <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> {{pregnancy}} among urban African-American {{women has}} not been well-researched. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine predictors of psychosocial <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> pregnancy and to explore relationships among socioeconomic status, experiences and frequency of discrimination, personal control beliefs, social support, planned pregnancy, and model of health care among urban African-American primiparas using life course theory and Lederman 2 ̆ 7 s model of psychosocial <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> pregnancy as the framework. One hundred and nine women participated in this descriptive, cross-sectional, correlational study. Participants were recruited from three clinical sites that provided care using medical and/or midwifery models of care. Study variables were measured using the Prenatal Self-Evaluation Questionnaire - II; Internality, Powerful Others, and Chance Scales; Norbeck Social Support Questionnaire; Experiences of Discrimination instrument; and a researcher-developed Demographics and Personal Characteristics Questionnaire. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to describe the sample and identify predictors of psychosocial <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> pregnancy. Higher <b>adaptation</b> was associated with social support received from the woman 2 ̆ 7 s partner or mother, a relationship with the father of the baby, planned pregnancy, and receiving care from a Certified Nurse-Midwife. Lower <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> pregnancy was associated with the personal control belief of chance.

5|$|Heinrich Mallison in 2011 {{argued that}} Opisthocoelicaudia {{was able to}} angle the {{anterior}} part of the tail against the posterior part, producing a buckle in midsection. Thus, the anterior part {{would have been more}} straight during rearing than in other sauropods. In 2005, Wilson assumed that rearing was an innovation not only of Opisthocoelicaudia but also of related genera within the subfamily Saltasaurinae. Common features of these genera, such as the shortened tail, may have evolved as <b>adaptations</b> <b>to</b> rearing.|$|E
5|$|Interestingly, {{although}} the centrum of Hatzegopteryx {{is much more}} robust than Arambourgiania, their ratios of bone radius to bone thickness (R/t) are roughly the same (9.45 for Hatzegopteryx and 9.9 for Arambourgiania). This may represent a compromise between increasing bending strength and buckling strength; higher R/t ratios lead to improved bending strength, but weaker buckling strength. To compensate for this, Hatzegopteryx shows {{a number of other}} <b>adaptations</b> <b>to</b> improve buckling strength, namely the distinctive internal structures of the bones and the large articular joints of the vertebrae, the latter of which helps to distribute stress.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{have adapted}} to fill many open {{ecological}} niches since making their way to Madagascar. Their diversity in both behavior and morphology (outward appearance) rivals that of the monkeys and apes found elsewhere in the world. Ranging in size from the 30g (1.1oz) Madame Berthe's mouse lemur, the world's smallest primate, to the recently extinct 160–200kg (350–440lb) Archaeoindris fontoynonti, lemurs evolved diverse forms of locomotion, varying levels of social complexity, and unique <b>adaptations</b> <b>to</b> the local climate.|$|E
