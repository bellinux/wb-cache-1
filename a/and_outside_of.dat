5|$|An {{approximation}} to {{the curve}}-shortening flow can be computed numerically, by approximating the curve as a polygon {{and using the}} finite difference method to calculate the motion of each polygon vertex. Alternative methods include computing a convolution of polygon vertices and then resampling vertices on the resulting curve, or repeatedly applying a median filter to a digital image whose black and white pixels represent the inside <b>and</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> the curve.|$|E
5|$|Captive lemur {{populations are}} {{maintained}} locally <b>and</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> Madagascar in many zoos, although {{the diversity of}} species is limited. Sikafas, for instance, do not survive well in captivity, so few facilities have them. The largest captive lemur population {{can be found at}} the Duke Lemur Center (DLC), whose mission includes non-invasive research, conservation (e.g. captive breeding), and public education. Another large lemur colony the Myakka City Lemur Reserve run by the Lemur Conservation Foundation (LCF), which also hosts lemur research.

5|$|Daniel Craig was a late auditionee for {{the role}} of Geordie. At the audition, he {{performed}} the Geordie accent very poorly, however, he won the part and it came to be regarded as his breakthrough role. Mark Strong worked on the Geordie accent by studying episodes of the 1980s comedy series Auf Wiedersehen, Pet, which featured lead characters from Newcastle. Strong later claimed that Christopher Eccleston took a dislike to him, <b>and</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> their scenes together, the pair did not speak for the entire period that Our Friends in the North was filming.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{exported}} grain left Poland through Danzig (Gdańsk), {{which became}} the wealthiest, most highly developed, and most autonomous of the Polish cities because of its location {{at the mouth of}} the Vistula River and access to the Baltic Sea. It was also by far the largest center for manufacturing. Other towns were negatively affected by Danzig's near-monopoly in foreign trade, but profitably participated in transit and export activities. The largest of those were Kraków (Cracow), Poznań, Lwów (Lviv), and Warszawa (Warsaw), <b>and</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> the Crown, Breslau (Wrocław). Thorn (Toruń) and Elbing (Elbląg) were the main cities in Royal Prussia after Danzig.|$|E

5|$|The {{architecture}} of al-Azhar is {{closely tied to}} the history of Cairo. Materials taken from multiple periods of Egyptian history, from the Ancient Egyptians, through Greek and Roman rule, to the Coptic Christian era, were used in the early mosque structure, which drew on other Fatimid structures in Ifriqiya. Later additions from the different rulers of Egypt likewise show influences from both within <b>and</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> Egypt. Sections of the mosque show many of these influences blended together while others show a single inspiration, such as domes from the Ottoman period and minarets built by the Mamluks.|$|E
