5|$|In 2002, Lieutenant Junior Grade Angelina Hidalgo {{became the}} second Hispanic-American female to command an <b>afloat</b> unit.|$|E
5|$|At {{least one}} leader with current Safe Swim Defense {{training}} {{is required for}} swimming activities. Boating activities require Safety <b>Afloat</b> and CPR training. Climb On Safely training and CPR certification are required for climbing and rappelling events.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, LTJG Katherine Tiongson {{became the}} first Hispanic-American female to command an <b>afloat</b> unit when she took command of USCGC Bainbridge Island. She {{was also the first}} Hispanic-American female {{intelligence}} officer in the Coast Guard.|$|E
5|$|Another account, {{involving}} seafaring, {{holds that}} the name arose from the misfortune of a mariner <b>afloat.</b> In this version the clan’s founder, sometimes identified as son {{of one of the}} Lords of the Isles, cuts off his thumb in order to plug a leak in his sinking vessel.|$|E
5|$|As the {{ice stream}} accelerates {{it is also}} getting steeper. The rate of {{thinning}} within the central trunk has quadrupled from 1995 to 2006. If {{the current rate of}} acceleration were to continue the main trunk of the glacier could be <b>afloat</b> within 100 years.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{following}} season saw the team struggle again, and Taylor resigned in early April 1984 {{with the club}} third from bottom of the Second Division, before Derby went on to be relegated. However, the team did manage to reach the quarter-finals of the FA Cup, and the revenue obtained from the cup run helped to keep the club <b>afloat.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 1 February 1917, Kaiser Wilhelm II {{personally}} {{approved a}} resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare {{in order to}} try to force the British to make peace. The new rules of engagement specified that no ship was to be left <b>afloat,</b> although British reports for several of UB-43s victims suggest that von Mellenthin was already operating in this manner.|$|E
5|$|On 3 September 1943, Italy {{surrendered}} to the Allies, and on 89 September, German troops occupied La Spezia. As the ship was still in an unusable condition, her crew did not scuttle Bolzano, instead leaving her partially <b>afloat.</b> During the German occupation, they cannibalized Bolzano and the also-damaged Gorizia for useful parts but otherwise did not make use of her. On the night of 2122 June 1944, a team of British and Italian frogmenItaly having re-entered the war {{on the side of}} the Alliesentered La Spezia using Chariot manned torpedoes to sink Bolzano and Gorizia to prevent the Germans from sinking them as blockships. They succeeded in sinking Bolzano but Gorizia remained <b>afloat.</b> Bolzano was formally stricken from the naval register on 27 February 1947, and in September 1949, salvage workers raised the ship and she was subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|The port has rail {{connections}} with the Albany Port Railroad, which allows for {{connections with}} CSXT and CP Rail. It is near several interstates and the New York State Canal System. The port features several tourist attractions as well, such as the USS Slater (DE-766), the only destroyer escort still <b>afloat</b> in the United States.|$|E
5|$|By this time, Cushing {{was dead}} in the water, {{an easy target for}} {{repeated}} enemy shelling. The results were disastrous and the order was given to abandon ship. Six officers and 53 men were lost. Of the survivors rescued, 56 had been wounded and ten of them suffered fatal injuries. The abandoned ship remained <b>afloat</b> until her magazines blew up. Cushing received three battle stars for her World War II service.|$|E
5|$|Documents {{mention the}} {{construction}} of another bucentaur in 1449 larger than the 1311 one, but {{little is known about}} this vessel. The earliest known image of a bucentaur appeared in Jacopo de' Barbari's monumental woodcut Pianta di Venezia (Map of Venice) which was published in 1500. This work pictured a bucentaur <b>afloat</b> in the Arsenale without oars or decoration save for a large wooden sculpture of Justice in the bow. A similar illustration was produced by Andrea Valvassore between 1517 and 1525.|$|E
5|$|Fusō {{was part}} of Vice-Admiral Shōji Nishimura's Southern Force at the Battle of Leyte Gulf. She was sunk {{in the early hours}} of 25 October 1944 by torpedoes and naval gunfire during the Battle of Surigao Strait. Some reports claimed that Fusō broke in half, and that both halves {{remained}} <b>afloat</b> and burning for an hour, but according to survivors' accounts, the ship sank after 40 minutes of flooding. Of the few dozen crewmen who escaped, only 10 survived to return to Japan.|$|E
5|$|Gurnard rose to periscope depth {{two hours}} later and found that a major effort to rescue troops and {{equipment}} from the torpedoed transports was under way. That night, the submarine torpedoed one of the crippled transports which was still <b>afloat.</b> Gurnards attack sank transports Aden Maru (5,825 tons) and Taijima Maru (6,995 tons) {{as well as the}} cargo ship Tenshinzan Marau (6,886 tons). While the rescue effort was relatively successful, 1,290 troops were killed and much of their equipment was lost.|$|E
5|$|Hispanic men {{and women}} have reached the top ranks of the Coast Guard, serving their country in {{sensitive}} leadership positions on domestic and foreign shores. In 1991, LTJG Katherine Tiongson became the first Hispanic-American female to command an <b>afloat</b> unit. In 2006, Ronald J. Rábago was the first Hispanic-American promoted to Rear Admiral (lower half). In 2009, Rear Admiral Joseph R. Castillo became the first Hispanic-American district commander in the U.S. Coast Guard. Hispanics currently account for 11% of the enlisted personnel, and 9% of the United States Coast Guard Academy's student body.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, Shepard {{accepted}} {{the position of}} pastor at Mount Olivet Tabernacle Baptist Church in West Philadelphia, where he would remain {{for the rest of}} his life. The church struggled financially, especially after the onset of the Great Depression in 1929, and several congregation members mortgaged their homes to keep the church <b>afloat.</b> Shepard's reputation as a minister grew, and he served as assistant secretary of the National Baptist Convention and associate editor of the National Baptist Voice.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, the United States Football League {{formed as}} a spring league, and enjoyed {{moderate}} success during its first two seasons behind such stars as Jim Kelly and Herschel Walker. In 1985, the league, which lost {{a considerable amount of}} money due to overspending on players, opted to gamble on moving its schedule to fall in 1986 and filing a billion-dollar antitrust lawsuit against the NFL in an effort to stay <b>afloat.</b> When the lawsuit only drew a three-dollar judgment, the USFL folded.|$|E
5|$|In Ancient Egypt, Yocheved, {{and her two}} children, Miriam and Aaron, {{watch as}} the newborn Hebrew boys are taken and ruthlessly killed as ordered by Pharaoh Seti, who fears that an {{alarming}} increase in Hebrew slaves could lead to rebellion. Fearing for her own newborn son's safety, Yocheved places him in a basket <b>afloat</b> on the Nile River, not before bidding him farewell with a final but powerful lullaby. Miriam follows the basket as it sails to the Pharaoh's palace and witnesses her baby brother safely adopted by Queen Tuya, who names him Moses.|$|E
5|$|In October 1944, Leipzig {{collided}} with the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen; the damage was so severe that the navy decided complete repairs were unfeasible. The ship was patched up to keep her <b>afloat,</b> and she helped to defend Gotenhafen from the advancing Red Army in March 1945. She then carried a group of fleeing German civilians, reaching Denmark by late April. After {{the end of the}} war, Leipzig was used as a barracks ship for minesweeping forces and was scuttled in July 1946.|$|E
5|$|MSU's (private, non-Morrill Act) {{endowment}} {{started in}} 1916 when the Engineering Building burned down. Automobile magnate R.E. Olds helped the program stay <b>afloat</b> {{with a gift}} of $100,000. There {{was a time when}} MSU lagged behind peer institutions in terms of endowments. As recently as the early 1990s, MSU was last among the eleven Big Ten schools, with barely over $100 million in endowment funds.|$|E
5|$|Ostfriesland was ceded to the US Navy, and {{was later}} used as a {{stationary}} target during a demonstration of air power, conducted by General Billy Mitchell on 21 July 1921 off Cape Henry in Virginia. The ship sank at 12:40 after sustaining several bomb hits and near misses. However, she likely would have avoided these had she been underway, and {{if she had been}} hit, damage control teams would have kept the ship <b>afloat.</b>|$|E
5|$|Rieve and his {{executive}} officer were both severely criticized {{for failing to}} take all possible steps to save Karlsruhe in a later investigation into the sinking. The report concluded that since the ship was still <b>afloat</b> after two hours, and two torpedoes were required to sink her, {{it might have been}} possible to take her under tow back to Kristiansand or another port. In addition, the forward pumps still had power, and so the flooding could have been slowed enough to permit a return to a safe harbor.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{suffered}} through yet another poor season in 1996, finishing 6–10. Though Brown again started every {{game for the}} Giants he turned {{in one of the}} worst seasons of any starting quarterback in the league that year, throwing for 12 touchdowns against 20 interceptions. The Giants offense {{was one of the worst}} in the NFL and, unlike in previous years, the defense was unable to keep the offense <b>afloat.</b> After having one playoff appearance in four years, Reeves was dismissed after the 1996 season.|$|E
5|$|The Mosquito {{conducted}} a reconnaissance sortie over Kaafjord {{on the afternoon}} of 15 September, arriving at about 1:30pm GMT. Its crew found that the fjord was covered with cloud and smoke. They could only briefly see Tirpitz, but reported that no damage was evident to the battleship, which remained <b>afloat.</b> The Mosquito conducted further reconnaissance sorties on 16 September, but the fjord was completely obscured on all occasions. McMullen considered launching a second attack, but decided against doing so as only two Tallboys and one load of JW mines were available.|$|E
5|$|The USS Slater (DE-766), {{which is}} the only {{destroyer}} escort still <b>afloat</b> in the United States, sits at Steamboat Square near the foot of Madison Avenue. The ship is open from April to November to the public. The destroyer closes to the public from December to March and moves from the Steamboat Square to the port's Rensselaer side. In August 2008 part of the Japanese film Orion in Midsummer (scheduled for release in spring 2009) was filmed on board.|$|E
5|$|The {{increase}} {{in the price of}} kelp, {{as a result of the}} Napoleonic Wars, was the only thing keeping Rùm's economy <b>afloat.</b> Inevitably, when the Napoleonic Wars ended, the kelp price collapsed, causing severe financial hardship. The laird himself was in additional difficulties as a result of having purchased the Isle of Muck during the peak of demand for kelp. He decided to evict the tenants, and lease the whole island to a relative, Dr Lachlan Maclean.|$|E
5|$|The torpedo {{struck the}} after {{portion of the}} {{starboard}} side of the Houston, blowing 20 men overboard and spreading gasoline fires in the waters around the cruiser. Initially unsure whether the ship would hold together, the captain ordered the evacuation of 300 crew members while the ship's condition was ascertained. In {{the end it was}} determined she would stay <b>afloat.</b> Towing continued as before, slowly moving the task group towards the Navy base at Ulithi.|$|E
5|$|Titanics down angle altered fairly rapidly {{from zero}} degrees to about {{four and a}} half degrees during the first hour after the collision, but {{the rate at which the}} ship went down slowed greatly for the second hour, {{worsening}} only to about five degrees. This gave many of those aboard a false sense of hope that the ship might stay <b>afloat</b> long enough for them to be rescued. By 1:30, the sinking rate of the front section increased until Titanic reached a down angle of about ten degrees.|$|E
5|$|When the war ended, Holt's planned {{expansion}} to {{meet the}} military's needs was no longer needed. The company was left in a difficult situation. The types of tractors needed by the military were {{very different from what}} farmers needed. Their situation was worsened as artillery tractors were brought back from Europe, depressing prices for new equipment and Holt's unsold inventory of military tractors. The company moved to focus less on agricultural machinery and more on producing road-building equipment. To keep the company <b>afloat,</b> they borrowed heavily.|$|E
5|$|After the American Revolutionary War, {{the brand-new}} United States {{struggled}} to stay financially <b>afloat.</b> National income was desperately needed and most came from tariffs on imported goods. Because of rampant smuggling, the need was immediate for strong enforcement of tariff laws. On 4 August 1790 the United States Congress, urged on by Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, created the Revenue-Marine, the forerunner for the United States Coast Guard, {{to enforce the}} tariff and all other maritime laws. Ten cutters were initially ordered. Between 1790 and 1797 when the Navy Department was created, the Revenue-Marine was the only armed maritime service for the United States.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{watertight}} bulkheads extended {{well above}} the water line, they were not sealed at the top. If too many compartments were flooded, the ship's bow would settle deeper in the water, and water would spill from one compartment to the next in sequence, rather like water spilling {{across the top of}} an ice cube tray. This was what happened to Titanic, which had suffered damage to the forepeak tank, the three forward holds and No.6 boiler room, a total of five compartments. Titanic was only designed to float with any two compartments flooded, but it could remain <b>afloat</b> with certain combinations of three or even four compartments (the first four) open to the ocean. With five compartments, the tops of the bulkheads would be submerged and the ship would continue to flood.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the dynasty (c. 965) the two Zhe provinces (now Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu) presented (to the throne) two dragon ships each more than (60.00m/200ft) in length. The upper works included several decks with palatial cabins and saloons, containing thrones and couches all ready for imperial tours of inspection. After many years, their hulls decayed and needed repairs, but the work was impossible {{as long as they were}} <b>afloat.</b> So in the Xi-Ning reign period (1068 to 1077) a palace official Huang Huaixin suggested a plan. A large basin was excavated at the north end of the Jinming Lake capable of containing the dragon ships, and in it heavy crosswise beams were laid down upon a foundation of pillars. Then (a breach was made) so that the basin quickly filled with water, after which the ships were towed in above the beams. The (breach now being closed) the water was pumped out by wheels so that the ships rested quite in the air. When the repairs were complete, the water was let in again, so that the ships were <b>afloat</b> once more (and could leave the dock). Finally the beams and pillars were taken away, and the whole basin covered over with a great roof so as to form a hangar in which the ships could be protected from the elements and avoid the damage caused by undue exposure.|$|E
5|$|Brown's {{government}} introduced {{monetary and}} fiscal policies {{to help keep}} the banks <b>afloat</b> during the financial crisis in 2008, and as a result the United Kingdom's national debt increased dramatically. The Government took majority shareholdings in Northern Rock and Royal Bank of Scotland, both of which experienced financial difficulties. Large amounts of money were injected into several other banks, including newly merged HBOS-Lloyds TSB, which received £17billion. Domestic policies focusing on education, employment and health were introduced by the administration. The Labour Party was persuaded to give Gurkhas settlement rights in Britain by the campaign of actress Joanna Lumley and attracted criticism for its handling of the Scottish Government's release of Abdelbaset al-Megrahithe only person to have been convicted over the 1988 Lockerbie bombing. Brown was also dogged by allegations of bullying.|$|E
5|$|By 1864 {{the company}} was {{operating}} a fleet of at least four ships - the Kiama was still in service, {{and she had been}} joined by Hunter, Mynora and Kembla. Both Kembla, a 204-ton iron steamship, and Hunter, a paddle steamer with a net weight of 105 tons, were built in Glasgow, Scotland. The Mynora was built in Australia at Prymont in Sydney. A 117-ton wooden paddle steamer, her time with the company ended in 1864 after she ran into St Georges Head in Wreck Bay. In an attempt to save the lives of passengers and crew, the captain fought to keep the ship <b>afloat</b> until she finally ran aground on a sandy beach approximately three miles from the headland. While the boat was lost, all of the passengers and crew on Mynora were saved.|$|E
5|$|By {{the morning}} of 16 August, both Montanan and West Bridge were still <b>afloat,</b> albeit with decks awash. Despite {{attempts}} to get Montanan under tow, she foundered later in the morning. Meanwhile, Hawkins and his executive officer were taken by boat to West Bridge to assess her situation. After boarding the ship and finding three cargo holds and her engineering spaces completely flooded, Hawkins advised Burrows captain that the situation was hopeless and he would only be endangering his ship, crew, and the West Bridge survivors by remaining alongside. Consequently, Burrows departed for Brest, France, leaving destroyer Smith to stand by West Bridge.|$|E
5|$|During Danny Williams' time as premier the {{province}} experienced a major economic expansion, mainly {{as a result}} of the offshore oil industry. After years of sluggish growth and annual deficits {{the province}} started recording large surpluses, starting in 2006. While billions of dollars were paid down on the province's debt, government spending increased considerably. In his 2011 report Auditor General John Noseworthy noted that spending had increased by 47.4 percent over a five-year period. Finance Minister Tom Marshall defended the spending practises by saying that the province had to play catchup after decades of deficits, and that the global recession forced all governments to hike spending to keep economies <b>afloat.</b>|$|E
5|$|Fusō and Yamashiro {{were the}} only two Japanese battleships at the Battle of Surigao Strait, the southernmost action of the Battle of Leyte Gulf, and both were lost {{in the early hours of}} 25 October 1944 to torpedoes and naval gunfire. Some eyewitnesses later claimed that Fusō broke in half, and that both halves {{remained}} <b>afloat</b> and burning for an hour, but historian Anthony Tully has made the case that she simply sank after forty minutes of flooding. Six battleships and eight cruisers were lying in wait for Yamashiro; she did not survive the encounter, and Vice-Admiral Shōji Nishimura went down with his ship. Only ten crewmembers from each ship survived.|$|E
