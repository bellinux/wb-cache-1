Food supply was also disrupted with many markets unable to operate a week after the quake. Furthermore, prolonged periods of aftershocks forced the population to take residence in makeshift shelters, <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> inside weakened buildings, and causing psychological trauma.|$|E

25|$|West Midlands Police {{struggled}} {{to operate on}} the estate due to recurring incidents and also incidents where officers were attacked by youths. The lack of law enforcement led to the residents feeling intimidated and helpless on the estate. In the 1980s, the police tried an alternative approach called Community Policing where hot spots for crime were tackled with more officers. The scheme received national attention but was considered to not be drastic {{enough to deal with}} the problems on the estate. By 1992, 41% of residents said they were victims of crime and 55% said they were <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out at night.|$|E

25|$|Virginia Woolf {{is taking}} her walk while {{thinking}} of ideas for her novel. She already believes Clarissa Dalloway will commit suicide, now Virginia plans for Mrs.Dalloway {{to have had}} one true love: not her husband, but a girl Clarissa knew during her own girlhood. Her love of another girl will have represented {{a time when she}} was not <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> against the destiny laid out for her by society and family. Virginia plans for Clarissa to kill herself in middle-age over something quite trivial, a representation of what her life has become and what has been repressed. As Virginia walks about Richmond she reflects on how Mrs.Dalloway's deterioration in middle-age represents how Virginia feels about being trapped in suburban Richmond when she only feels fully alive in London. She is aware she is more susceptible to mental illness in London, but would rather die 'raving mad' in London than avoid life (and perhaps prolong her years) in Richmond.|$|E
25|$|The initial Arab plans {{called for}} Syrian and Lebanese forces to invade from north while Jordanian and Iraqi forces were to invade from east {{in order to}} meet at Nazareth and then to push forward {{together}} to Haifa. In the south, the Egyptians were to advance and take Tel Aviv. At the Arab League meeting in Damascus on 11–13 May, Abdullah rejected the plan, which served Syrian interests, using the fact his allies were <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to war without his army. He proposed that the Iraqis attack the Jezreel valley and the Arab Legion enter Ramallah and Nablus and link with the Egyptian army at Hebron, which was more in compliance with his political objective to occupy the territory allocated to the Arab State by the partition plan and promises not to invade the territory allocated to the Jewish State by the partition plan. In addition, Lebanon decided not {{to take part in the}} war at the last minute due to the still influential Christians' opposition and to Jewish bribes.|$|E
25|$|From 8 to 12 August, {{as many as}} 10,000 {{residents}} fled to Yunnan {{province in}} neighbouring China, becoming refugees. The total number of refugees fleeing in the entire month may {{be as high as}} 30,000, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and later the Yunnan provincial government. Yunnan's police chief later reported that the number of refugees in Yunnan reached 37,000, including Burmese refugees as well as Kokang. Yunnan government officials stated they have established seven locations (particularly near the city of Nansan, where most of the refugees arrived) to house and treat the refugees; some locals, however, claimed that not all the refugees were being housed, or were being housed in unfinished buildings and tents. According to one refugee, about 13,000 of the refugees were housed in the tents, and 10,000–20,000 more stayed with friends or family in the area. By 31 August, some refugees (as many as 4,000, according to local officials, or 2,800 according to the junta government) had started returning to Kokang; by mid-September, Chinese officials said over 9,000 refugeees had returned and Myanmar officials said over 13,000; many refugees, however, were still <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back.|$|E

Mélisande bursts into tears and says she feels ill and unhappy in the castle. She wants to go away with Golaud. He asks her the reason for her unhappiness but she refuses to say. When he asks her if the problem is Pelléas, she replies {{that he is not}} the cause but she does not think he likes her. Golaud tells her not to worry: Pelléas can behave oddly and he is still very young. Mélisande complains about the gloominess of the castle, today {{was the first time she}} saw the sky. Golaud says that she is too old to be crying for such reasons and takes her hands to comfort her and notices the wedding ring is missing. Golaud becomes furious, Mélisande claims she dropped it in a cave by the sea where she went to collect shells with little Yniold. Golaud orders her to go and search for it at once before the tide comes in, even though night has fallen. When Mélisande replies that she is <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> alone, Golaud tells her to take Pelléas along with her.|$|E
25|$|I {{was saved}} {{from the gas}} chambers, saved from Hitler. I spent several years in Nazi death camps. Besides {{the fact that they}} murdered my wife and 11 children, my mother, my sisters and my brother – of my whole family, some 150 people, I {{was the only one who}} survived – I {{witnessed}} their cruelty. I remember as if it were today how they shot me in the arm. I was <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to the Nazi infirmary, though there were doctors there. I knew that if I went in, I'd never come out alive. … Despite my fear of the Nazis, I plucked a leaf from a tree and stuck it to my wound to stanch the bleeding. Then I cut a branch and tied it around the wound to hold it in place. With God's help, it healed in three days. Then I promised myself that if, with God's help, I got well and got out of there, away from those resha'im (wicked people), I would build a hospital in Eretz Yisrael where every human being would be cared for with dignity. And the basis of that hospital would be that the doctors and nurses would believe that there is a God in this world and that when they treat a patient, they are fulfilling the greatest mitzvah in the Torah.|$|E

McCarthy then recited the list of supposedly pro-communist authors before his subcommittee and the press. The State Department bowed to McCarthy and ordered its overseas librarians to remove from their shelves [...] "material by any controversial persons, Communists, fellow travelers, etc." [...] Some libraries went as far as burning the newly forbidden books.

While overlooking North Bridge {{from the top of}} the hill, Barrett, Lt. Col. John Robinson of Westford and the other Captains discussed possible courses of action.

During her interview with Google, Gaga added to the song's meaning as honoring one's inner darkness in order to bring themselves into the light. One has to learn to forgive themselves in order to move on with their life. With Popjustice she clarified that {{she has a lot of}} things that have haunted her from her past, including her choices, men, drug abuse, being <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to New York, confronting old romances.

500|$|Pam {{says that}} her husband Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) always makes her great Christmas gifts so {{she wants to make}} him one too. She creates a {{hand-drawn}} comic book about Jim who gets attacked by a radioactive bear and takes its powers.

Meanwhile, Jim agrees to a snowball fight with Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson). When he is first challenged outside, however, he finds the doors chained. Dwight then emerges from a snowman, throwing multiple snowballs at Jim and leaving him with a bloody nose. Throughout the day, Dwight torments Jim with increasingly elaborate snowball ambushes. Jim tries to surrender, but Dwight refuses. At the end of the day, Jim is too <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> outside. He and Pam find multiple snowmen, and Jim attacks them all hoping to find Dwight. Dwight, however, is {{on the roof of the}} building, watching Jim with a satisfied look on his face. He claims that the most powerful snowball in a snowball fight is fear, and smilingly wishes the camera [...] "Merry Christmas".|$|E
500|$|Rowland's {{voice is}} {{classified}} as a three-octave lyric mezzo-soprano, and her music includes various styles of musical genres such as contemporary R, pop, hip hop, soul, rock and dance. Her debut solo album Simply Deep (2002) followed an adult-alternative rock sound, while her second album Ms. Kelly (2007) featured an urban sound. In an interview with The Independent, Rowland admitted that with her first two albums she struggled to find her sound. [...] "I was in a stage with the first two records where I was searching and I was like, let me try a rock-dance approach, the label [...] wanted me to try it and I did it...And then after that came a more urban approach with Ms. Kelly in 2007." [...] Her third album Here I Am (2011) consisted of a pop and R sound, with subtle influences of dance. Rowland stated that meeting David Guetta had influenced her to record dance music. During production of the album, Rowland stated {{that part of the}} reason for the new sound on Here I Am was wanting to do something different, saying [...] "I knew I couldn't be afraid of this direction, and I wasn't going to let the thoughts and opinions of others make me <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> in this direction".|$|E
