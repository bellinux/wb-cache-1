500|$|In {{the case}} of Hurricane Sandy, two major factors {{contributing}} to the size and strength of the storm were unusually warm ocean surface temperatures {{and an increase in}} blocking patterns, both of which are expected to occur more frequently due to global warming. As they drift north, Atlantic hurricanes are typically moved to the east and out to sea by the jet stream's prevailing winds. This typical pattern was blocked by a ridge of high pressure over Greenland, resulting in a negative <b>Arctic</b> <b>oscillation,</b> forming a kink in the jet stream and causing it to double back on itself off the East Coast; Sandy was caught up in this northwesterly flow. The blocking pattern over Greenland also stalled an arctic front, which combined with the cyclone. Mark Fischetti of Scientific American argued that the jet stream's unusual shape was caused by the melting of Arctic ice. Noting that these blocking patterns are unusual in the fall but have been increasing, meteorologist Jeff Masters said that three studies in 2011 found [...] "that the recent record decline in Arctic sea ice could be responsible, since this heats up the pole, altering the Equator-to-pole temperature difference, forcing the jet stream to slow down, meander, and get stuck in large loops." [...] Trenberth said that while a negative <b>Arctic</b> <b>Oscillation</b> and a blocking anticyclone were in place, the null hypothesis remained that this was just the natural variability of weather.|$|E

Two data sets, considered to describe intra- and inter-annual oscillations, respectively were extracted from the measurements data and the results show that both types of fluctuations can be projected onto four empirical orthogonal functions (EOF), interpreted as vertical distributions of oscillation amplitudes and four uncorrelated time series that represent the evolution of corresponding EOFs. It was found that intra-annual oscillations composed of periods between 30 and 120 days, together with inter-annual variations of 1 - to 7 -year period contribute to the highest extent (about 70 percents) the temperature oscillations up to 20 km, changing in both cases the phase in the tropopausal region. The other three EOFs indicate prevailing weight of the oscillations in the upper troposphere-low stratosphere region and are characterized by longer periods in both types of fluctuations.

We assess relationships between climate variables and wild apple radial growth with dendroclimatological techniques to understand the potential of a changing climate to influence apple radial growth. Ring-width chronologies spanning 48 to 129 years were developed from 12 plots in the Trans-Ili Alatau and Jungar Alatau ranges of Tian Shan Mountains, southeastern Kazakhstan. Cluster analysis of the plot-level chronologies suggests different temporal patterns of growth variability over the last century in the two mountain ranges studied. Changes in the periodicity of annual ring-width variability occurred ca. 1970 at both mountain ranges, with decadal-scale variability supplanted by quasi-biennial variation. Seascorr correlation analysis of primary and secondary weather variables identified negative growth associations with spring precipitation and positive associations with cooler fall-winter temperatures, but the relative importance of these relationships varied spatially and temporally, with a shift in the relative importance of spring precipitation ca. 1970 at Trans-Ili Alatau.

40|$|Recent {{studies using}} meterological station data have {{indicated}} that global surface air temperature has been increasing {{at a rate of}} 0. 05 K/decade. Using the same set of data but for stations in the Antarctic and Arctic regions (> 50 N) only, the increases in temperature were 0. 08, and 0. 22 K/decade, when record lengths of 100 and 50 years, respectively, were used. To gain insights into the increasing rate of warming, satellite infrared and passive microwave observations over the Arctic region during the last 20 years were processed and analyzed. The results show that during this period, the ice extent in the Antarctic has been increasing at the rate of 1. 2 % per decade while the surface temperature has been decreasing at about 0. 08 K per decade. Conversely, in the Northern Hemisphere, the ice extent has been decreasing at a rate of 2. 8 % per decade, while the surface temperatures have been increasing at the rate of 0. 38 K per decade. In the Antarctic, it is surprising that there is a short term trend of cooling during a global period of warming. Very large anomalies in open water areas in the Arctic were observed especially in the western region, that includes the Beaufort Sea, where the observed open water area was about 1 x 10 (exp 6) sq km, about twice the average for the region, during the summer of 1998. In the eastern region, that includes the Laptev Sea, the area of open water was also abnormally large in the summer of 1995. Note that globally, the warmest and second warmest years in this century, were 1998 and 1995, respectively. The data, however, show large spatial variability with the open water area distribution showing a cyclic periodicity of about ten years, which is akin to the North Atlantic and <b>Arctic</b> <b>Oscillations.</b> This was observed in both western and eastern regions but with the phase of one lagging the other by about two years.

2500|$|As noted, {{the process}} of ice {{formation}} and movement is a key driver in Arctic Ocean circulation {{and the formation of}} water masses. [...] With this dependence, the Arctic Ocean experiences variations due to seasonal changes in sea ice cover. Sea ice movement is the result of wind forcing, which is related to a number of meteorological conditions that the Arctic experiences throughout the year. [...] For example, the Beaufort High—an extension of the Siberian High system—is a pressure system that drives the anticyclonic motion of the Beaufort Gyre. During the summer, this area of high pressure is pushed out closer to its Siberian and Canadian sides. In addition, there is a sea level pressure (SLP) ridge over Greenland that drives strong northerly winds through the Fram Strait, facilitating ice export. In the summer, the SLP contrast is smaller, producing weaker winds. A final example of seasonal pressure system movement is the low pressure system that exists over the Nordic and Barents Seas. It is an extension of the Icelandic Low, which creates cyclonic ocean circulation in this area. The low shifts to centre over the North Pole in the summer.

40|$|AbstractIn Part I of this study, {{the impact}} of Ural {{blocking}} (UB) on the warm Arctic?cold Eurasian (WACE) pattern associated with the winter (DJF) arctic sea ice loss during 1979 ? 2013 is examined by dividing the arctic sea ice reduction region into two dominant subregions: the Barents and Kara Seas (BKS) and the North American high-latitude (NAH) region (Baffin and Hudson Bay, Davis Strait, and Labrador Sea). It is found that atmospheric response to arctic sea ice loss resembles a negative <b>Arctic</b> response <b>oscillation</b> with a dominant positive height anomaly over the Eurasian subarctic region. Regression analyses of the two subregions further show that the sea ice loss over the BKS corresponds to the UB pattern together with a positive North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO+) and {{is followed by a}} WACE anomaly, while the sea ice reduction in the NAH region corresponds to a negative NAO (NAO?) pattern with a cold anomaly over northern Eurasia. Further analyses reveal that the UB pattern is more persistent during the period 2000 ? 13 (P 2) than 1979 ? 99 (P 1) because of the reduced middle-to-high-latitude mean westerly winds over Eurasia associated with the intense BKS warming. During P 2 the establishment of the UB becomes a slow process because {{of the role of the}} BKS warming, while its decay is slightly rapid. In the presence of the long-lived UB that often occurs with the NAO+, the BKS-warming-induced DJF-mean anticyclonic anomaly is intensified and widened and then expands southward during P 2 to amplify the WACE pattern and induce the southward displacement of its cold anomaly and the further loss of the BKS sea ice. Thus, midlatitude Eurasian cold events should be more frequent as the sea ice loss continues over the BKS...|$|R

It is shown that the predictability of the monthly mean AO/NAO index varies seasonally, with the highest predictability during winter (December–March) and the lowest during autumn (August–November), with respect to both observations and BCC_AGCM 2. 2 results. As compared with the persistence prediction skill of observations, the model skillfully predicts the monthly mean AO/NAO index with a one-pentad lead time during all winter months, and with a lead time of up to two pentads in December and January. During winter, BCC_AGCM 2. 2 exhibits an acceptable skill in predicting the daily AO/NAO index of ∼ 9 days, which is higher than the persistence prediction skill of observations of ∼ 4 days. Further analysis suggests that improvements in the simulation of storm track activity, synoptic eddy feedback, and troposphere–stratosphere coupling in the Northern Hemisphere could help to improve the prediction skill of subseasonal AO/NAO variability by BCC_AGCM 2. 2 during winter. In particular, BCC_AGCM 2. 2 underestimates storm track activity intensity but overestimates troposphere–stratosphere coupling, as compared with observations, thus providing a clue to further improvements in model performance...|$|R
