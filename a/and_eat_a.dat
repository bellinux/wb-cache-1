25|$|In a {{case-control study}} done {{following}} 5,286 Californians over a 28-year {{period in which}} variables were controlled for (i.e. age, race/ethnicity, gender, education level), participants who went to church on a frequent basis (defined as attending a religious service once a week or more) were 36% less likely to die during that period. However, this can be partly {{be attributed to a}} better lifestyle since religious people tend to drink and smoke less <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>a</b> healthier diet.|$|E
25|$|Tinamous are {{opportunistic}} feeders <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>a</b> {{wide range}} of foods, though each species varies in proportional dietary makeup. Tinamou genera can be roughly divided into three groups based on the vegetable component of their diets. Tinamus, Nothocercus and Crypturellus focus on fleshy fruit. Nothura, Nothoprocta and Eudromia, comprising open country birds, eat mainly seeds and other soft vegetative matter. High-altitude genera living in harsh environments, such as Tinamotis, will eat most of the plant, not just the succulent parts.|$|E

25|$|The {{situation}} with bumblebees (Bombus) is rather different. They too are unpalatable, {{in the sense}} of being difficult to eat: their body is covered with setae (like carpet pile) and is armoured; they are sometimes described as being 'non-food'. Mostler in 1935 carried out tests of their palatability: with the exception of specialist bee-eaters, adults of 19 species of birds ate only 2% of 646 bumblebees presented to them. After various trials, Mostler attributed their avoidance mainly to mechanical difficulties in handling: one young bird took 18 minutes to subdue, kill <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>a</b> bumblebee.|$|E
25|$|Thomas Harris {{created a}} fictional {{character}} called Hannibal Lecter, a cannibal and aesthete killer. In the films adapted from his work, The Silence of the Lambs (1991) and Hannibal (2001), directors Jonathan Demme and Ridley Scott, respectively intentionally generate excitement and anticipation when Lecter {{is about to}} kill (<b>and</b> <b>eat)</b> <b>a</b> victim. Lecter was portrayed by Anthony Hopkins. In David Lynch's Blue Velvet (1986), the villain of the film, Frank Booth, is an excessively violent man who obsesses over small fetishes (such as blue velvet) when he is attacking and raping his victims; his obsessions help him achieve orgasm.|$|E
25|$|Examples of {{children}} raised under the Kibbutz system of equality are given by Yosef Criden. When an aunt {{from a nearby}} city comes to visit her niece or nephew and brings a box of chocolate as a present for them, the child will excitedly open it up <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>a</b> few of the chocolates. Then the child will {{go over to the}} rest of the group and give the rest of the chocolates to their peers. This is the ideology instilled in the children, to value the self but also to always think about others. Another example Yosef gives is that when his son, who was born and raised on a kibbutz, went into the army, he and his fellow bunk mates asked their supervising officer for a box. They wanted to keep the box in the middle of the room and whenever they would get care packages, they would put the items into the box and share them communally. They did not want to be like most of the units of officers from towns and cities, where each officer would hide their packages under their beds.|$|E

25|$|In Sicily, where Saint Joseph is {{regarded}} {{by many as}} their Patron saint, and in many Italian-American communities, thanks are given to Saint Joseph (San Giuseppe in Italian) for preventing a famine in Sicily during the Middle Ages. According to legend, there was a severe drought at the time, and the people prayed for their patron saint to bring them rain. They promised that if he answered their prayers, they would prepare a large feast to honor him. The rain did come, {{and the people of}} Sicily prepared a large banquet for their patron saint. The fava bean was the crop which saved the population from starvation and is a traditional part of Saint Joseph's Day altars and traditions. Giving food to the needy is a Saint Joseph's Day custom. In some communities it is traditional to wear red clothing <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>a</b> Neapolitan pastry known as a zeppola (created in 1840 by Don Pasquale Pinatauro in Napoli) on Saint Joseph's Day. Maccu di San Giuseppe is a traditional Sicilian dish that consists of various ingredients and maccu that is prepared on this day. Maccu is a foodstuff and soup that dates to ancient times which is prepared with fava beans as a primary ingredient.|$|E
25|$|Kalmanowitz is {{credited}} with securing the funds and papers to transfer the entire Mir yeshiva – consisting of 250 students, faculty members, and the yeshiva's entire library of sefarim – to Kobe, Japan in 1941 {{and from there to}} Shanghai, and providing for its upkeep for five years. Thanks to the money Kalmanowitz sent, Mir students were able to board with Jewish families <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>a</b> nourishing Shabbat meal most of the time – privileges that other refugee students in Shanghai did not enjoy. In addition to money, Kalmanowitz sent matzos and wine for Passover, and hundreds of copies of Talmudic tractates so the students could continue studying without interruption. After Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 and the U.S. declared war on Japan, the Joint was prohibited from sending money to the yeshiva students in Shanghai. But Kalmanowitz established new contacts and influenced U.S. government officials to tacitly approve the sending of funds from the U.S. to Japan via neutral Switzerland. At war's end, Kalmanowitz obtained visas and travel fare to bring all the Mir students and faculty by ship to San Francisco and by train to New York; the last Mir refugee left Shanghai in 1948.|$|E

500|$|The main {{building}} {{was designed by}} Harry Weedon, the architect for Odeon Cinemas, while the layout and general buildings were designed by coordinating architect Owen Williams. The {{main building}} was not ready on opening, so food was served from temporary sheds. The restaurant opened in September 1960, but due to the site's reputation as a truck stop, was redesigned in 1964 to accommodate a waitress service. The services became a meeting place for rock bands in the 1960s, including the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd and Jimi Hendrix, as it provided a convenient place to sit down <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>a</b> meal {{in the early hours}} of the morning. In the 1970s, the quality of the services declined and the food came in for harsh criticism from journalists and artists, such as Roy Harper. [...] Since purchase in 1995, Roadchef have refurbished the premises. They have promoted its history, including the association with a north / south divide, and its regular use by 1960s rock musicians. A number of events took place to celebrate the 50th anniversary in November 2009, including a musical about the services.|$|E
500|$|Emus forage in a {{diurnal pattern}} <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>a</b> variety of native and {{introduced}} plant species. The diet depends on seasonal availability with such plants as Acacia, Casuarina and grasses being favoured. They also eat insects and other arthropods, including grasshoppers and crickets, beetles, cockroaches, ladybirds, bogong and cotton-boll moth larvae, ants, spiders and millipedes. This provides {{a large part}} of their protein requirements. In Western Australia, food preferences have been observed in travelling emus; they eat seeds from Acacia aneura until the rains arrive, after which they move on to fresh grass shoots and caterpillars; in winter they feed on the leaves and pods of Cassia and in spring, they consume grasshoppers and the fruit of Santalum acuminatum, a sort of quandong. They are also known to feed on wheat, and any fruit or other crops that they can access, easily climbing over high fences if necessary. Emus serve as an important agent for the dispersal of large viable seeds, which contributes to floral biodiversity. One undesirable effect of this occurred in Queensland {{in the early twentieth century}} when emus fed on the fruit of prickly pears in the outback. They defecated the seeds in various places as they moved around, and this led to a series of campaigns to hunt emus and prevent the seeds of the invasive cactus being spread. The cacti were eventually controlled by an introduced moth (Cactoblastis cactorum [...] ) whose larvae fed on the plant, one of the earliest examples of biological control.|$|E
2500|$|Mar Karyakos is {{a ruined}} monastery located about a {{kilometer}} east of Bakhdida, and lies amid agricultural fields. The monastery {{consists of three}} caves that are carved naturally in a hilly rock formed geologically of hardened pebbles. In the middle cave, which is the largest, stands an altar formed of piled stones. Every year on theSunday before Palm Sunday believers visit the altar and light its candles,in addition to giving prayers to the needy people of Bakhdida. Afterwards, the families picnic in the fields that surround the monastery <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>a</b> treat made from wheat known as [...] "kitikelie". The wheat is washed, soaked in salt water for three days, and then dried in the direct sunlight. After it is completely dry the grains are roasted in a special pan on the stove. Melon seeds are also washed, salted, dried and roasted {{the same way as}} the wheat and then mixed with it.|$|E

2500|$|Jones {{stated that}} upon her {{departure}} from Coronation Street, {{that she received}} numerous offers to appear in reality TV programmes, which she declined, quipping: [...] "lots of money to go off <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>a</b> crocodile's knob, or whatever". Ignoring reality TV offers, in autumn 2005, Jones starred in an ITV's detective drama series Vincent, with Ray Winstone in the title role; this was Jones's first television role since leaving Coronation Street the previous year. In the same year, she starred on the West End stage in A Few Good Men opposite Rob Lowe and John Barrowman, which earned her the Theatregoers' Choice Award for Best Supporting Actress. She also appeared in the musical special Celebrate Oliver! which was screened on BBC1. In 2006, she starred as Snow White in the pantomime Snow White and the Seven Dwarves at the Manchester Opera House alongside Justin Moorhouse and fellow Coronation Street actor John Savident. She also appeared in Kay Mellor's Strictly Confidential in which she played a bisexual sex therapist.|$|E
2500|$|Method of play: Two {{people sit}} {{facing each other}} over a board, and the board is divided into twelve paths, with two ends, and an area called the [...] "water" [...] in the middle. Twelve game pieces are used, which {{according}} to the ancient rules are six white and six black. There are also two [...] "fish" [...] pieces, which are placed in the water. The throwing of the dice is done with a jade. The two players take turns to throw the dice and move their pieces. When a piece has been moved to a certain place it is stood up on end, and called an [...] "owl (梟or驍) [...] ". Thereupon it can enter the water <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>a</b> fish, which is also called [...] "pulling a fish". Every time a player pulls a fish he gets two tokens, and if he pulls two fish in a row he gets three tokens [...] If a player has already pulled two fish but does not win it is called double-pulling a pair of fish. When one player wins six tokens the game is won.|$|E
