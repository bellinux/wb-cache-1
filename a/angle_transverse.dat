50|$|As {{with most}} early trilobites, Holmiidae have an almost flat exoskeleton, {{that is only}} thinly calcified, and has {{crescent-shaped}} eye ridges. As part of the Olenellina suborder, the Holmiidae lack dorsal sutures in the cephalon. Like all {{other members of the}} Olenelloidea superfamily, the eye-ridges spring {{from the back of the}} frontal lobe (L4) of the central area of the cephalon (or glabella). Specifically for the Holmiidae are the following diagnostic characters. The glabella is straight-sided to somewhat constricted and mostly expands forward. The frontal lobe (or L4) is usually broad and rounded. The furrows that separate the lobes are usually curved, moderately incised, and rarely completely cross the midline. The eye ridges of Baltic holmiids are often wide with an ocular furrow, inner band merging with L4 without axial furrow. Laurentian holmiids (Montezumaspis, Palmetaspis, Grandasinus, Esmeraldina and Holmiella) have unfurrowed ocular lobes separated from L4 by axial furrow. The cephalon carries so called genal spines at the corner between the half circle front/side margin and the back margin that is roughly perpendicular to the midline. These spines extend back to at least the fourth thorax segment (T4), counted front to back. The back margin of the cephalon normally carries a node or spine (or intergenal spine), straight behind the point the eye ridge is furthest from the midline or even somewhat further out. Back margin of cephalon inside the intergenal <b>angle</b> <b>transverse</b> or directed posteriorly. The third thorax segment (T3) is not larger than the neighboring segments and does not carry larger spines. Anterior thoracic pleural spines weakly to strongly thornlike except in Kjerulfia and Grandinasus.|$|E

Data obtained {{were compared with}} published measurements of spines from white patients to determine {{similarities and differences between}} the lumbar spines. Summary of Background Data. The age range of the patients was 18 to 60 years. There were 63 men and 37 women. There was no demonstrable sex difference for dimensions or angular alignment of the pedicles. Methods. The method of scanning and measurement was standardized. Levels considered abnormal by the radiologist were excluded from the study, and a single observer was used to avoid inter-observer errors. The data obtained were statistically analyzed using Student's t test to determine {{differences between men and women}} and left and right sides. Age differences were analyzed using the F statistic test. The pedicle inclination <b>angle</b> (<b>transverse</b> angle) and the pedicle dimensions were compared with published data of whites. Results. The pedicles of Asians, when compared with those of whites, showed a similar pattern of changes with vertebral level. However, Asian pedicles had a larger pedicle inclination <b>angle</b> (<b>transverse</b> angle) from L 1 to L 4 (L 1 = 16 °, L 2 = 16 °, L 3 = 19 °, L 4 = 23 °), whereas L 5 (29 °) was similar to many series of whites. Conclusions. There are differences between the lumbar pedicles of Asians and whites. Such differences need to be considered when posterior pedicle screw fixation of the spine is performed. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

They are however subject, like any other observables, to instrumental effects which must be properly accounted for to extract meaningful physics results. We compare the merits of several techniques used towards measurement of these correlation functions in nuclear collisions. We discuss and distinguish the effects of finite acceptance, and detection efficiency that may vary with collision parameters such as the position of the event in the detector and the instantaneous luminosity of the beam. We focus in particular on instrumental effects which break the factorization of the particle pair detection efficiency, and describe a technique to recover the robustness of correlation observables. We finally introduce a multi-dimensional weight method to correct for efficiencies that vary simultaneously with particle pseudo rapidity, azimuthal <b>angle,</b> <b>transverse</b> momentum, and the collision vertex position. The method can be generalized to account for any number of "event variables" that may break the factorability of the pair efficiency. Comment: 19 pages, 12 figures, Corrected various tempos.

Purpose {{of this study is}} to analyze the anatomical features of C 7 and T 1 pedicles related to screw insertion and to evaluate the safety of pedicle screw insertion at these levels. Methods: Nineteen patients underwent posterior CTJ fixation with C 7 and/or T 1 included in fixation levels. Seventeen patients had tumorous conditions and two with post-laminectomy kyphosis. The anatomical features were analyzed for C 7 and T 1 pedicles in 19 patients using computerized tomography (CT). Pedicle screw and rod fixation system was used in 16 patients. Pedicle violation by screws was evaluated with postoperative CT scan. Results: The mean values of the width, height, stable depth, safety <b>angle,</b> <b>transverse</b> angle, and sagittal angle of C 7 pedicles were 6. 9 ± 1. 34 mm, 8. 23 ± 1. 18 mm, 30. 93 ± 4. 65 mm, 26. 42 ± 7. 91 degrees, 25. 9 ± 4. 83 degrees, and 10. 6 ± 3. 39 degrees. At T 1 pedicles, anatomic parameters were similar to those of C 7. The pedicle violation revealed that 64. 1 % showed grade I violation and 35. 9 % showed grade II violation, overall. As for C 7 pedicle screw insertion, grade I was 61. 5 % and grade II 38. 5 %. At T 1 level, grade I was 65. 0 % and grade II 35. 0 %. There was no significant difference in violation rate between the whole group, C 7, and T 1 group. Conclusion: C 7 pedicles can withstand pedicle screw insertion.

40|$|The left {{ventricle}} (LV) of mammals with Situs Solitus (SS, normal organ arrangement) displays hardly any interindividual variation in myofiber pattern and experimentally determined torsion. SS LV myofiber pattern {{has been suggested}} to result from adaptive myofiber reorientation, in turn leading to efficient pump and myofiber function. Limited data from the Situs Inversus Totalis (SIT, a complete mirror image of organ anatomy and position) LV demonstrated an essential different myofiber pattern, being normal at the apex but mirrored at the base. Considerable differences in torsion patterns in between human SIT LVs even suggest variation in myofiber pattern among SIT LVs themselves. We addressed whether different myofiber patterns in the SIT LV can be predicted by adaptive myofiber reorientation and whether they yield similar pump and myofiber function as in the SS LV. With a mathematical model of LV mechanics including shear induced myofiber reorientation, we predicted myofiber patterns of one SS and three different SIT LVs. Initial conditions for SIT were based on scarce information on the helix <b>angle.</b> The <b>transverse</b> <b>angle</b> was set to zero. During reorientation, a non-zero <b>transverse</b> <b>angle</b> developed, pump function increased, and myofiber function increased and became more homogeneous. Three continuous SIT structures emerged with a different location of transition between normal and mirrored myofiber orientation pattern.

40|$|Abstract-The {{influence}} of variations of fiber direction {{on the distribution}} of stress and strain in the left ventricular wall was investigated using a finite element model to simulate the mechanics of the left ventricle. The commonly modelled helix fiber angle was defined as the angle between the local circumferential direction and the projection of the fiber path on the plane perpendicular to the local radial direction. In the present study, an additional <b>angle,</b> the <b>transverse</b> fiber <b>angle,</b> was used to model the continuous course of the muscle fibers between the inner and the outer layers of the ventricular wall. This angle was defined as the angle between the circumferential direction and the projection of the fiber path on the plane perpendicular to the local longitudinal direction. First, a reference simulation of left ventricular mechanics during a cardiac cycle was performed, in which the <b>transverse</b> <b>angle</b> was set to zero. Next, we performed two simulations in which the spatial distribution of either the transverse or the helix angle was varied with respect o the reference situation, the spatially averaged variations being about 3 and 14 ”, respectively. The changes in fiber orientation hardly affected the pressure-volume relation of the ventricle, but significantly affected the spatial distribution of active muscle fiber stress (up to 50 % change) and sarcomere l ngth (up to 0. 1 pm change). In the basal and apical region of the wall, shear deformation in the circumferential-radial plane was significantly reduced by introduction of a nonzero <b>transverse</b> <b>angle.</b> Thus, the loading of the passive tissue may be reduced by the endocar-dial-epicardial crossover of the muscle fiber...|$|R

The benefits of TE polarization are clear – the interference of diffracted beams remains absolute at oblique <b>angles.</b> <b>Transverse</b> magnetic (TM) polarization is usually considered less desirable as imaging modulation from interference at large angle falls off rapidly as the 1 /cosθ. Significant potential remains, however, {{for the use of}} TM polarization at large angles when its reflection component is utilized.

40|$|Neutrinos {{escaping}} detection {{is one of}} {{the main}} problems in mass reconstruction with tau leptons. They must be neglected or corrected for in some way. This thesis discusses two methods of handling the neutrinos in different ways. The Collinear Approximation (CA) builds upon the assumption that the neutrinos travel in the same direction as the visible tau decay products. The boost method neglects the neutrino energy contribution in the leading visible tau, as seen from the mother particle's reference system. The methods have been studied with simulated °→τ+τ-, °̋→τ+τ-, and QCD samples, and with early data from ATLAS. This work shows that the weaknesses of CA is that the <b>transverse</b> <b>angle</b> of the <b>transverse</b> missing energy has to lie between the <b>transverse</b> <b>angle</b> of the two visible taus, and that it collapses with back-to-back taus in the transverse plane. A strength of the CA is that it uses the missing energy, which is all information available about the neutrinos. The CA works better for boosted taus, i. e. taus decaying from heavy particles, like H° and Z°. The weaknesses of the boost method are that it does not use the transverse missing energy information, and that the distribution is not easily fitted, but the method is still under development on these points. The strength of the boost method is that it works for all tau pairs, making it a good complimentary method to the CA. Both methods work in °→τ+τ- and °̋→τ+τ- events, and can be potentially applied to other decay chains as well. In the future, many studies will include mass reconstruction from tau leptons, where both the CA and the boost method will be important methods...|$|R
