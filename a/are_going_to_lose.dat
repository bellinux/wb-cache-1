500|$|At {{the height}} of Akhmatova's fame, in 1918, she {{divorced}} her husband and that same year, though many of her friends considered it a mistake, Akhmatova married prominent Assyriologist and poet Vladimir Shilejko. She later said “I felt so filthy. I {{thought it would be}} like a cleansing, like going to a convent, knowing you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> your freedom.” [...] She began affairs with [...] theatre director Mikhail Zimmerman and composer Arthur Lourié, who set many of her poems to music.|$|E
500|$|The {{pressure}} evidently worked, as Rinder {{wrote an}} [...] "Apology and Announcement" [...] on June 4, 2005 {{in which he}} told Miscavige, [...] "I recognise very clearly how Treasonous I have been towards you and Scientology." [...] He subsequently commented that such written confessions [...] "read like North Korean POW writeups," [...] alluding to the way that Korean War POWs detained in North Korea were forced to go through brainwashing to renounce their [...] "reactionary imperialist" [...] mindset. He explained to the Tampa Bay Times why people did not simply {{walk out of the}} Hole: [...] "If you leave you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> contact with your family and any friends who are Scientologists. You have it pounded into you the whole time that the only reason someone leaves a group like that is because they are bad, that you have done something that force you to have to leave." [...] He noted people had invested a great deal of themselves in Scientology, that Sea Org members have [...] "made a commitment beyond even a single lifetime" [...] and that the prevailing attitude was that [...] "'I've lived through many lifetimes {{and there are lots of}} experiences that I've had that are far worse than this, so I can put up with this and I can stand it'." ...|$|E

2500|$|Speaker of the House John Boehner, a Republican Representative from Ohio, {{told reporters}} that {{throughout}} November [...] "more Americans <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> their health care than are going to sign up." [...] Ohio Governor John Kasich stated on NBC's Meet the Press program on October 27 that the roll-out has [...] "got everybody just shaking their heads".

2500|$|In November 1988, Judit and her sisters, {{along with}} Ildikó Mádl, {{represented}} Hungary in the Women's {{section of the}} 28th Chess Olympiad in Thessaloniki. The International Chess Federation would not permit the Polgárs to play against men in team competitions. Prior to the tournament, Eduard Gufeld, Soviet GM and team coach for the Soviet women's team, dismissed the Polgárs: [...] "I believe that these girls <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> {{a good part of}} their quickly acquired image in the 28th Olympiad...Afterward we are going to know if the Hungarian sisters are geniuses or just women!" [...] However, Hungary's women's team won the championship, which marked the first time it was not won by the Soviet Union.

2500|$|Many of the Ducatis Galluzzi {{originally}} styled {{were later}} revised and updated by Pierre Terblanche, including the ST series and the Monster 696 update of 2008. Terblanche later joined Galluzzi at Aprilia, {{where they have}} worked together on several new and revised models for Aprilia subsidiary Moto Guzzi. The two collaborated on the Moto Guzzi V12 series, with Le Mans, Strada, and X variants, displayed at EICMA in 2009. Galluzzi described the challenge he and Terblanche faced revising the Moto Guzzi image by saying, [...] "The Guzzi crowd is extremely conservative, but if we only concentrate on those, we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> eventually. So these bikes are looking into the future." [...] This {{is similar to the}} balance sought with earlier Ducati designs, but, [...] "the advantage Guzzi has versus Ducati is that Ducati makes sportsbikes, Guzzi can do anything it wants because they’ve been doing it a long time and on all sorts of bikes." ...|$|E

2500|$|This did not please Mahathir, who had clashed {{on several}} {{previous}} occasions with the judiciary. In one instance, a government order revoking the work permits of two foreign journalists {{critical of the}} government had been over-ruled by the Supreme Court. Mahathir began making heated attacks on the judiciary, telling Time, [...] "The judiciary says, 'Although you passed a law with a certain thing in mind, we think that your mind is wrong, {{and we want to}} give our interpretation.' If we disagree, the Courts will say, 'We will interpret your disagreement.' If we [...] go along, we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> our power of legislation." [...] Mahathir also lashed out at [...] "black sheep ... who want to be ... fiercely independent," [...] accusing them of playing to public opinion. Immediately after this latter statement, the government reassigned several High Court judges to different divisions, including Justice Harun Hashim who was then hearing the UMNO case. However, as the latter case was already in progress, Harun's transfer would not take effect until the case closed.|$|E
