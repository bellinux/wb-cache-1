Unlike the situation with using expensive factory ammunition, handloaded match ammunition can be made that is vastly more accurate, and, through reloading, that can be much more affordable, than <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> be purchased, being customized for a particular rifle.|$|E

A few decent natural tinders are birch bark, cedar bark, and fatwood, where available; followed by dead, dry pine needles or grass; a more comprehensive list is given in the article on tinder. Though not natural, steel wool makes excellent tinder and can be started with steel and flint, or a 9 volt battery without difficulty.|$|E

25|$|Naturalism of {{this sort}} says nothing about the {{existence}} or nonexistence of the supernatural, which by this definition is beyond natural testing. As a practical consideration, the rejection of supernatural explanations would merely be pragmatic, thus it would nonetheless be possible, for an ontological supernaturalist to espouse and practice methodological naturalism. For example, scientists may believe in God while practicing methodological naturalism in their scientific work. This position does not preclude knowledge that is somehow connected to the supernatural. Generally however, <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> be scientifically examined and explained would not be supernatural, simply by definition.|$|E
25|$|Disneyland Paris has {{strict rules}} {{designed}} to prevent visitors from seeing backstage areas of the park. Photography and filming are strictly forbidden in backstage areas. The edges of the parks are lined with ride buildings and foliage to hide areas that are not {{for the public to}} see. Numerous gates allow entrance into the park for cast members, parade cars etc. When gates around the park are open, <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> be seen through them is considered part of the Disney magic. Therefore, from the second the gates are open, all of the crew must be in character and in place to 'perform'. As the complex is so big, shuttle buses take cast members to different parts of the park via roads behind the parks.|$|E

500|$|According to Roberts, [...] "What Howe {{started in}} 1940 was an Industrial Revolution, so {{widespread}} that most Canadians {{were unaware of}} its extent or of its penetration into the country's economy." [...] Although there had been increases in production throughout {{the first three years}} of the war, the minister's efforts truly bore fruit in 1943, in which Canada had the fourth-highest industrial production among the Allies, trailing only the US, USSR, and Britain. By 1944, Canada had produced over 600ships for the war effort, 1,100aircraft, and over half a million cars and trucks, of which 31,000 were armoured. According to Roberts, Howe's actions swung Canada's economy from agriculture-based to industrial, a change which would prove permanent. [...] Howe stated in 1943, [...] "Never again will there be any doubt that Canada can manufacture <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> be manufactured elsewhere." ...|$|E

500|$|Margaret Mead (American Sociological Review) {{considered}} the book {{more of a}} historical document for later generations to analyze [...] "than <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> be taken at its face value". She wrote the school to be [...] "unique" [...] and [...] "counter-pointed to the emphases and excesses" [...] of its era, which she credited to Neill's [...] "rare charismatic personality". To Mead, Summerhill's moral battles had passed since the 1920s, as Neill's audience already agreed with his views on frank discussions about sex and the primacy of student interest. She added that his contemporaries had moved on to [...] "rebelling against a contentless freedom" [...] that prioritized emotional education over intellectual lessons. Similarly, Crutis (The Times Literary Supplement) noted Neill's approach as less [...] "sensational" [...] in its method than expected, and asserted that 1960s psychologists would agree with the stance to not guilt children for masturbating and {{to tell the truth}} about the origin of babies. Morton Reisman (The Phi Delta Kappan) upheld the book's subtitle and agreed that the book was [...] "radical" [...] in comparison to conventional American morality and education.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} reviews were more {{critical}} of Haggard's work. Although the reviewer of She in Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine considered it better than King Solomon's Mines, he opined, [...] "Mr. Rider Haggard has not proved as yet that he has <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> be called imagination at all... It might be wrought up into an unparalleled stage effect: but it is rather a failure in pen and ink. The more fearful and wonderful such circumstances are intended to be, the more absurd is the failure of them". Even more scathing was Augustus Moore in the May edition of Time: A Monthly Miscellany, who declared: [...] "In Mr Haggard's book I find none of the powerful imagination, the elaborate detail, the vivid English which would entitle his work to {{be described as a}} romance... it {{seems to me to be}} the method of the modern melodrama". Moore was particularly dismissive of the novel's style and prose: [...] "Mr Haggard cannot write English at all. I do not merely refer to his bad grammar, which a boy at a Boarding School would deserve to be birched for... It can only have been written by a man who not only knew nothing, but cared nothing for 'English undefiled'." [...] Haggard's English was a common source of criticisms, but Moore was even dismissive of the character of She who widely garnered universal praise. [...] "Ayesha", Moore declares, [...] "is about as impressive as the singing chambermaid who represents the naughty fairy of a pantomime in tights and a tow wig". Concluding his review, Moore wondered at the success that had greeted She: ...|$|E
