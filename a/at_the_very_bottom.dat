5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>bottom</b> right corner, two Polish Jews are on {{the edge}} of the scene; the younger (36) one is usually {{described}} as enthralled by the events, watching them with hope, but most analysis focuses on the older man (37), whose hand is making a Sy, git ("that's good") gesture. Interpretation of this figure varies; while some suggest that he express his interest and support for the Constitution, which he sees as a promise of further reforms that will improve the situation of the Jews—the Constitution had not addressed them in any significant way—others put him, or both of the Jews, among the opponents of the Constitution, describing them as frowning and disturbed, gleefully anticipating the end of the Commonwealth, or at least concerned with the liberal reforms. The latter interpretation can be also supported by the fact that Matejko tended to portray Jews in his paintings in negative roles.|$|E
5|$|The coinage metals were {{traditionally}} {{regarded as}} a subdivision of the alkali metal group, due to them sharing the characteristic s1 electron configuration of the alkali metals (group 1: p6s1; group 11: d10s1). However, the similarities are largely confined to the stoichiometries of the +1 compounds of both groups, and not their chemical properties. This stems from the filled d subshell providing a much weaker shielding effect on the outermost s electron than the filled p subshell, so that the coinage metals have much higher first ionisation energies and smaller ionic radii than do the corresponding alkali metals. Furthermore, they have higher melting points, hardnesses, and densities, and lower reactivities and solubilities in liquid ammonia, as well as having more covalent character in their compounds. Finally, the alkali metals {{are at the top}} of the electrochemical series, whereas the coinage metals are almost <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>bottom.</b> The coinage metals' filled d shell is much more easily disrupted than the alkali metals' filled p shell, so that the second and third ionisation energies are lower, enabling higher oxidation states than +1 and a richer coordination chemistry, thus giving the group 11 metals clear transition metal character. Particularly noteworthy is gold forming ionic compounds with rubidium and caesium, in which it forms the auride ion (Au−) which also occurs in solvated form in liquid ammonia solution: here gold behaves as a pseudohalogen because its 5d106s1 configuration has one electron less than the quasi-closed shell 5d106s2 configuration of mercury.|$|E

40|$|A {{mechanism}} of the condensation of e-h pairs in bulk GaAs at room temperature, which has been observed earlier, is proposed. The {{point is that the}} photon assisted pairing happens in a system of electrons and holes that occupy energy levels <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>bottoms</b> of <b>the</b> bands. Due to a very high e-h density, the destruction of the pairs and loss of coherency does not occur because almost all energy levels inside a 30 - 60 meV band {{from the bottom of the}} conduction band prove to be occupied. As a result, a coherent ensemble of composite bosons (paired electrons and holes) with the minimum possible energy appears. The lifetime of this strongly non-equilibrium coherent e-h BCS-like state is as short as a few hundred of femtosecondsComment: 10 pages, 8 figure...|$|R

Following the defeat, Pulis was controversially sacked by the club amidst claims of gross misconduct.

50|$|The {{vacuum system}} {{provided}} a physical buffer between the precision {{movements of the}} capstan and the large movements of the reels by storing a short length of tape in the vacuum column under relatively low tension. The vacuum columns were chambers open <b>at</b> one end, <b>the</b> openings being {{in line with the}} tape path before and after the capstan and roller assemblies. The amount of tape in the column was controlled by four optical or vacuum sensors {{on the sides of the}} columns. The control electronics kept the curve of the tape loop between the two inner sensors, cueing the supply reel to feed more or the take-up reel to take more as necessary. The outer two sensors, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> top and <b>bottom</b> of the columns, served to sense malfunctions in the feed mechanism during operation, prompting the control electronics to shut off all operation of the tape transport and vacuum system to prevent damaging the tape. Because of the tension provided by the vacuum columns and the design of the tape path, tape was usually kept in sufficient contact with the relatively high-friction coating on the capstan that a pinch roller was not used.|$|R

40|$|The {{lack of an}} {{engaging}} pedagogy and the highly competitive atmosphere in introductory science courses tend to discourage students from pursuing STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) majors. Once in a STEM field, academic and social integration has been long thought to be important for students' persistence. Yet, it is rarely investigated. In particular, the relative impact of in-class and out-of-class interactions remains an open issue. Here, we demonstrate that, surprisingly, for students whose grades fall in the "middle of the pack," the out-of-class network {{is the most significant}} predictor of persistence. To do so, we use logistic regression combined with Akaike's Information Criterion to assess in- and out-of-class networks, grades, and other factors. For students with grades <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> top (and <b>bottom),</b> final grade, unsurprisingly, is the best predictor of persistence [...] these students are likely already committed (or simply restricted from continuing) so they persist (or drop out). For intermediate grades, though, only out-of-class closeness [...] a measure of one's immersion in the network [...] helps predict persistence. This does not negate the need for in-class ties. However, it suggests that, in this cohort, only students that get past the convenient in-class interactions and start forming strong bonds outside of class are or become committed to their studies. Since many students are lost through attrition, our results suggest practical routes for increasing students' persistence in STEM majors.

Further details are available here: [URL] axial capacity of large-diameter plain-pipe grouted connections has recently been observed in offshore wind turbine substructures across Europe. Aimed <b>at</b> understanding <b>the</b> implications of this phenomenon, a campaign of structural condition monitoring was undertaken. The measurements showed significant axial displacements occurring between the transition piece and the monopile, which in turn resulted in a considerable amount of wear. Given the existing lack of technical data on the implications that this relative movement has on the wear of grouted connections, a methodology was developed to quantify the likely risk to the foundation integrity of the wear failure mode. The proposed approach consists of a numerical model which applies the wear rate derived from previous experimental testing to the conditions experienced by typical offshore grouted connections, as indicated by the wind turbine generators' supervisory control and data acquisition systems. The output of this model showed that, for a representative sample of the wind farm substructures analysed as a case study, the accumulated lifetime wear would be minimal in the majority of the grouted connection, i. e. less than 0. 4 mm over 75 % of the connection, but a much greater loss in thickness, of the order of 4 mm, was predicted <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> top and <b>bottom</b> of the connection. This assessment is based on the assumptions that no significant changes occur in the surrounding environmental conditions and that the degradation in the grouted connection does not significantly affect the dynamic response of the foundation structure over its life span. Importantly, these assumptions may affect the model's predictions in terms of cumulated wear over time, not in terms of identifying the individual connections to be prioritised when performing remedial work, which is indeed the main intended use of the model...|$|R
