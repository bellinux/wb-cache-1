60|$|No {{words of}} mine can express {{the feeling that}} came over me <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> superscription written on the {{envelope}} I had {{picked up in the}} old tool house.|$|E
6000|$|... "What is it, papa?" [...] I asked, dreadfully alarmed; [...] "may I read it?" [...] Papa motioned assent, and {{my heart}} almost stood still <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> terrible tidings-- ...|$|E
50|$|W. B. Wood, {{one of the}} Official History writing team, wrote (in 1944) “my {{own blood}} had boiled <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> of <b>the</b> … results of Hunter-Weston’s pig-headed tactics at Gallipoli”.|$|R
6000|$|... "She was a {{very pretty}} little maid when I left home, {{she may be a}} perfect beauty now," [...] <b>I</b> remarked, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> over <b>the</b> longest letter Harry ever wrote on private affairs.|$|R
6000|$|An' by {{the terms}} of <b>the</b> Contract, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>read</b> <b>the</b> same, [...] If He got me to port alive I would exalt His name, [...] An' praise His Holy Majesty till further orders came.|$|R
60|$|I reeled <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> lines. The street {{seemed to}} weave {{itself into a}} circle around me. But I knew that I was not dreaming, that this was no {{delirium}} of my sleep.|$|E
60|$|Then gradually, gently, {{we began}} to slow. Were we slowing to pass the station only? No; with a jolt she drew up. My heart gave a bound <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> word 'Dunbar' on the station notice-board.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed it does; {{for this}} very day, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> papers, I got quite low-spirited, {{thinking}} what a shameful state things have got into. Money {{seems to be the}} one idea, and men are ready to sell their souls for it," [...] answered John, as soberly as she.|$|E
6000|$|DAIMON 'twas {{printed in}} the book [...] And, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> it slowly, <b>The</b> letters stirred and changed, and took Jove's stature, the Olympian look [...] Of painless melancholy.|$|R
6000|$|It was an {{ordinary}} prescription for a tonic mixture. I looked {{first at the}} doctor's signature; it {{was the name of}} a perfectly obscure person in the profession.

6000|$|Just <b>as</b> <b>I</b> had <b>read</b> <b>the</b> last words--underlined in the original--I {{heard the}} voice of Betteredge behind me. The {{inventor}} of the detective-fever had completely succumbed to that irresistible malady. [...] "I can't stand it any longer, Mr. Franklin. What does her letter say? For mercy's sake, sir, tell us, what does her letter say?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She! she {{commit a}} crime!" [...] cried the young artist. [...] "Can {{you look at}} the {{innocent}} anguish in her face, and ask that question? No; but, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> mystery, a man has been slain in her presence, and the blood, spurting accidentally on her white robe, has made a stain which eats into her life." ...|$|E
6000|$|After {{saying these}} {{necessary}} words of explanation, I opened the first page, {{and began the}} story of my Own Adventure. I observed that my audience started a little <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> title, which I must add, in my own defense, had been almost forced on my choice by the peculiar character of the narrative. It was [...] "MAD MONKTON." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The voting cards," [...] Fenn pointed out, [...] "are {{before each}} person. Every one has two votes, {{which must be}} for two {{different}} representatives. The cards should then be folded, and I propose that the Bishop, {{who is not a}} candidate, collect them. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> unwritten rules of this Congress, every one here is eligible except the Bishop, Miss Abbeway, Mr. Orden and Mr. Furley." ...|$|E
60|$|But I will go farther. I will go from ideal {{fiction to}} actual, and yet ideal, fact; and say that, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> history, <b>the</b> most unheroic age which the civilised world ever saw {{was also the}} most heroic; {{that the spirit of}} man triumphed most utterly over his {{circumstances}} at the very moment when those circumstances were most against him.|$|R

6000|$|With some sauces, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>read,</b> <b>the</b> {{above-mentioned}} {{animals are}} said to be exceedingly fragrant, wholesome, and savoury eating. Indeed, no man could look more rosy and healthy, or flourish more cheerfully, than friend Sampson upon the diet. He became our young friend's confidential leader, and, from the following letter, which is preserved in the Warrington correspondence, it will be seen that Mr. Harry not only had dancing and fencing masters, but likewise a tutor, chaplain, and secretary:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{forget how}} many days intervened between that last {{breaking}} off of our engagement and Marion's surrender. But I recall now the sharpness of my emotion, the concentrated spirit of tears and laughter in my throat <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> words of her unexpected letter--"I have thought over everything, and I was selfish...." [...] I rushed off to Walham Green that evening to give back all she had given me, to beat her altogether at giving. She was extraordinarily gentle and generous that time, I remember, and when at last I left her, she kissed me very sweetly.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I was {{thinking}} lately of George Herbert at Hereford, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> four sermons which Vaughan lately preached there, {{one on the}} Atonement, which I liked very much indeed. The Cathedral has been beautifully restored, has it not? Then, I think of you in York Minster on November 20, with that good text from Psalm xcvi. I read your letter on Tuesday; on which day our morning Psalms in Chapel are always chanted, xcv., xcvi., xcvii. The application seems very natural, but to work out those applications is difficult. The more I read sermons, and I read a good many, the more I wonder how men can write them! ...|$|E
60|$|The {{paper is}} {{so full of}} good touches of character, passion, and natural emotion, that I very much wish for {{a little time to}} reconsider it, and to try whether {{condensation}} here and there would enable us to get it say into four parts. I am not sanguine of this, for I observed <b>the</b> difficulties <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> it <b>the</b> night before last; but I am very unwilling, I assure you, to decline what has so much merit.|$|R

'In all <b>the</b> story-books <b>as</b> ever <b>I</b> <b>read,</b> sir, <b>the</b> people <b>as</b> looked {{backward}} {{was turned}} into stones,' replied Mark; 'and my opinion always was, that they brought it on themselves, and it served 'em right.

60|$|I {{know that}} I shall {{never again be}} at Boston, and that I have said that about the Americans which would make me unwelcome as a guest if I were there. It is in this that my regret consists; {{for this reason that}} I would wish to {{remember}} so many social hours as though they had been passed in sleep. They who will expect blessings from me, will say among themselves that I have cursed them. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> pages which I have written, I feel that words which I intended for blessings when I prepared to utter them have gone nigh to turn themselves into curses.|$|E

He had a relapse some five days ago, how we cannot say, {{he was always}} watched day and night. I had much comfort in him, he was a dear lad, and our most hopeful Ysabel scholar. His {{peaceful}} death, for it was very peaceful at the last, may work more than his life would have done; some twenty others convalescent, or ailing, or sick. At this moment another comes {{to say that he}} feels out of sorts; you know that sensation, and how one's heart seems to stop for a minute, and then one tries to look and speak cheerfully.|$|E
60|$|There {{was silence}} for some minutes, and Sally Steel patted my uninjured {{shoulder}} sympathetically. Then I {{pointed to a}} litter of papers on the table, and inquired {{if there were any}} letters in Lane's writing. Thorn handed me one reluctantly, {{and it was hard to}} refrain from fierce exclamation <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> laconic missive. Lane regretted to hear of my accident, but the scarcity of money rendered it necessary to advise me that as I had not formally accepted his terms, repayment of the loan was overdue, and he would be obliged to realize unless I were willing to pledge Crane Valley or renew the arrangement at an extra five per cent. on the terms last mentioned.|$|E
6000|$|I am, of course, {{flattered by}} the wider course you have {{obtained}} for the Letters, but am not in the slightest degree interested by the debate upon them, nor by any religious debates whatever, undertaken without serious conviction {{that there is a}} jot wrong in matters as they are, or serious resolution to make them a tittle better. Which, so far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can <b>read</b> <b>the</b> minds of your correspondents, appears to me the substantial state of them.[169] ...|$|R

I have had an opportunity of examining yours, and I do not find that slight discolouration which the scratch made upon the varnish would have produced.

6000|$|The old seaman {{was right}} in his surmise, {{for the next day}} broke calm and bright, with only a low dwindling cloud in the west to mark the last {{trailing}} wreaths of the storm-wrack. But still there came no word from the sea, and no sign of the ship. Three more weary days had passed, the weariest that I have ever spent, when there came a seafaring man to the hotel with a letter. I gave a shout of joy. It was from the captain of the Eastern Star. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> first lines of it I whisked my hand over it, but she laid her own upon it and drew it away. [...] "I have seen it," [...] said she, in a cold, quiet voice. [...] "I may as well see the rest, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|One point puzzled me immensely <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> Sonnets, {{and it was}} {{days before}} I struck on the true interpretation, which indeed Cyril Graham himself seems to have missed. I could not {{understand}} how it was that Shakespeare set so high a value on his young friend marrying. He himself had married young, and the result had been unhappiness, {{and it was not}} likely that he would have asked Willie Hughes to commit the same error. The boy-player of Rosalind had nothing to gain from marriage, or from the passions of real life. The early sonnets, with their strange entreaties to have children, seemed to me a jarring note. The explanation of the mystery came on me quite suddenly, and I found it in the curious dedication. It will be remembered that the dedication runs as follows:- ...|$|E

Bonny, bairnly braws; it's for the like o' them folk sells the peace of God that passeth understanding; it's for the like o' them, an' maybe no even sae muckle worth, folk daunton God to His face and burn in muckle hell; and it's for that reason the Scripture ca's them, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> passage, the accursed thing.

But Mr. Gandish listened no more to him than to Mr. Smee, and went on, {{buttering}} himself all over, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>read</b> <b>the</b> Hottentots do.

60|$|For {{three months}} after taking over the {{practice}} I was kept very closely at work, and saw little of my friend Sherlock Holmes, for I {{was too busy to}} visit Baker Street, and he seldom went anywhere himself save upon professional business. I was surprised, therefore, when, one morning in June, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> sat <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> British Medical Journal after breakfast, I heard a ring at the bell, followed by the high, somewhat strident tones of my old companion's voice.|$|R
60|$|Nothing had {{happened}} at the cottage, during the interval of my absence.
