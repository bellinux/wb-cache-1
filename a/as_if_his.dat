5|$|Like ale, aloviti men led hail-producing and {{thunderstorm}} clouds: {{when the}} skies darkened, {{such a man}} would fall into a trance, and his spirit would fly out of his body toward the clouds <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>his</b> spirit were an ala herself. There was, however, a significant difference– he never led the clouds over the fields of his own village; the damage was done to the neighboring villages. In this respect, aloviti men are equivalent to zduhaći. Besides leading clouds away, an aloviti man could also fight against ale to protect his village. Children, too, could be aloviti, and they fought ale using plough beams. In these fights they were helped by the Aesculapian snake (smuk in Serbian), {{and for this reason}} people would not hurt these snakes.|$|E
5|$|Naoi {{is a human}} {{originally}} {{thought to be a}} non-player character (non-human). After he died, Naoi developed hypnotic powers that allow him to control others and cause them to enter a dream-like state. In life, {{he was the son of}} a famous potter. However, it was his twin brother who had the talent in pottery and as a result, Naoi was ignored by everyone. When his brother died, he was made to replace him by his father and was given strict training in pottery. As a result, he felt <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>his</b> own life was fake and all he wanted was to be acknowledged for his own existence. He later befriends Otonashi after he acknowledges him and joins the SSS. As acting student council president for a time and self-proclaimed God, Naoi is strict and arrogant, but this is quick to disperse when Otonashi chastises him. He is affectionate to Otonashi, much to the latter's chagrin, and always tries to earn his affection. He uses dual USP 45 handguns.|$|E

25|$|Both {{director}} McTiernan and Schwarzenegger lost 25 pounds {{during the}} film. Schwarzenegger's weight loss {{was a professional}} choice. McTiernan lost the weight because he avoided the food in Mexico due to health concerns. Unlike McTiernan, most of {{the cast and crew}} suffered from traveler's diarrhea since the Mexican hotel in which they were living was having problems with the water purification. In an interview, Carl Weathers said the actors would secretly wake up as early as 3:00a.m. to work out before the day's shooting. Weathers also stated that he would act <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>his</b> physique was naturally given to him, and would work out only after the other actors were nowhere to be seen.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{election}} of 1844, Whig candidate Henry Clay and the presumed Democratic candidate, former President Van Buren, both declared themselves opposed to the annexation of Texas, each hoping to keep the troublesome topic from becoming a campaign issue. This unexpectedly led to Van Buren being dropped by the Democrats in favor of Polk, who favored annexation. Polk tied the Texas annexation question with the Oregon dispute, thus providing a sort of regional compromise on expansion. (Expansionists in the North were more inclined to promote the occupation of Oregon, while Southern expansionists focused primarily on the annexation of Texas.) Although elected by a very slim margin, Polk proceeded <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>his</b> victory had been a mandate for expansion.|$|E
500|$|Adair {{views the}} river setting as a fictional {{representation}} of the Piave River near Fossalta, the site of Hemingway's mortar wound. Hemingway may have taken {{the idea of the}} swamp from the terrain in the battle of Portogrande—a battle that Hemingway wrote about in a 1922 newspaper story, saying of it: [...] "Austrians and Italians attacked and counter-attacked waist deep in swamp water". [...] Furthermore, Adair suggests that Hemingway's own wounding is reflected in the scene where Nick loses a fish—the [...] "biggest one I ever had"—with descriptive imagery such as shoes [...] "squelchy" [...] with water, suggestive of Hemingway's recollection of [...] "feeling <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>his</b> boots were filled with warm water (blood) after his wounding." ...|$|E

500|$|In a mixed {{review for}} Newsweek, David Ansen praised Rossum's performance, but criticized the filmmakers for {{their focus on}} visual design rather than {{presenting}} a cohesive storyline. [...] "Its kitschy romanticism bored me on Broadway and it bores me here—I {{may not be the}} most reliable witness. Still, I can easily imagine a more dashing, charismatic Phantom than Butler's. Rest assured, however, Lloyd Webber's neo-Puccinian songs are reprised and reprised and reprised until you're guaranteed to go out humming." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly believed Schumacher did not add enough dimension in adapting The Phantom of the Opera. [...] "Schumacher, the man who added nipples to Batman's suit, has staged Phantom chastely, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>his</b> job were to adhere the audience to every note".|$|E
500|$|Off {{the opening}} faceoff, Sergei Shesterikov elbowed Canadian Dave McLlwain, who responded by cross-checking the Soviet player. Neither player was {{assessed}} a penalty. Five minutes in, Theoren Fleury scored the opening goal for Canada. In celebrating the goal, Fleury slid across centre ice {{on his knees}} acting <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>his</b> stick was a machine gun and pretended to [...] "open fire" [...] on the Soviet bench. Canadian Amateur Hockey Association president Murray Costello later called it an [...] "inflammatory act, completely unnecessary, lacking any sort of respect." [...] The first period continued in similar fashion with both teams repeatedly slashing their opponents and Canada emerging with a 3–1 lead. Interviewed by the CBC during the intermission, Fleury described the atmosphere on the ice: [...] "The boys are up for the gold medal. Everybody is so tense. Tempers are flying. It's really tough out there... I can't believe it. It's so tense. It's so tense." ...|$|E
500|$|Kohli {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for Delhi against Tamil Nadu in November 2006, {{at the age}} of 18, and scored 10 in his debut innings. He came into the spotlight in December when he decided to play for his team against Karnataka on the day after his father's death and went on to score 90. He went directly to the funeral after he was dismissed. Delhi captain Mithun Manhas said, [...] "That is an act of great commitment to the team and his innings turned out to be crucial," [...] while coach Chetan Chauhan lauded Kohli's [...] "attitude and determination." [...] His mother noted that [...] "Virat changed a bit after that day. Overnight he became a much more matured person. He took every match seriously. He hated being on the bench. It's <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>his</b> life hinged totally on cricket after that day. Now, {{he looked like he was}} chasing his father's dream which was his own too." [...] He scored a total of 257 runs from 6 matches at an average of 36.71 in that season.|$|E

500|$|On {{the evening}} of August 16, 1977, Presley was {{scheduled}} to fly out of Memphis to begin another tour. That afternoon, Ginger Alden discovered him in an unresponsive state on his bathroom floor. According to her eyewitness account, [...] "Elvis looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>his</b> entire body had completely frozen in a seated position while using the toilet and then had fallen forward, in that fixed position, {{directly in front of}} it. [...] It was clear that, from the time whatever hit him to the moment he had landed on the floor, Elvis hadn't moved." [...] Joel Williamson writes: [...] "For some reason— perhaps involving a reaction to the codeine and attempts to move his bowels— he experienced pain and fright while sitting on the toilet. Alarmed, he stood up, dropped the book he was reading, stumbled forward, and fell face down in the fetal position. He struggled weakly and drooled on the rug. Unable to breathe, he died." [...] Attempts to revive him failed, and death was officially pronounced at 3:30p.m. at Baptist Memorial Hospital.|$|E
500|$|Leslie and Justin meet Frank, {{a strange}} and {{depressed}} man that has constant panic attacks. Leslie begins to have doubts about bringing him {{to her mother and}} tries to call it off, but Justin insists that they should [...] "let this unfold". At the dance, where Andy's (Chris Pratt) band Mouse Rat is playing, Frank meets up with Marlene, who is repulsed by Frank's past, current unemployment and overall failure at life. She turns down his offer at a second chance at love, prompting him to storm onto the stage and denounce her over the microphone. Leslie apologizes to her mother for bringing Frank. She is later upset with Justin, but has trouble pinpointing the reasons for her dissatisfaction. Ron (Nick Offerman) explains that Justin is a [...] "tourist," [...] meaning that he takes [...] "vacations in people's lives" [...] and only cares about telling interesting stories to impress other people, which makes him selfish. Two older women then recognize Ron as jazz saxophonist Duke Silver, but he denies it. Leslie later breaks up with Justin, which Tom (Aziz Ansari) takes especially hard, reacting <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>his</b> parents were getting divorced.|$|E
500|$|Even {{with his}} First Nations allies, Brock was outnumbered {{approximately}} two to one. He {{decided to use}} tricks to intimidate Hull. He dressed his militia contingent in uniforms discarded by his regulars, making it appear (at a distance) <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>his</b> force consisted entirely of British regular infantry. Brock laid siege to Fort Detroit, from established artillery positions across the river in Sandwich. Through a carefully crafted series of marches, he gave the appearance of having much more numerous forces. He had Tecumseh's forces cross {{in front of the}} fort several times (doubling back under cover), intimidating Hull with the show of a large, raucous, barely controlled group of First Nations warriors. Finally, he sent Hull a letter demanding his surrender, in which he stated, in part, [...] "It is far from my inclination to join in a war of extermination, but you must be aware that the numerous body of Indians who have attached themselves to my troops will be beyond my control the moment the contest commences." [...] Brock hammered the fort with cannon fire. On 16 August, the day after receiving Brock's letter, Hull surrendered. Hull, elderly and without recent military experience, was terrified that the civilian population of the fort, including his own daughter and grandson, would face torture {{at the hands of the}} First Nations.|$|E

500|$|Stratton tried {{variations}} of the experiment {{over the next few}} years. First he wore the glasses for eight days, back at Berkeley. The first day he was nauseated and the inverted landscape felt unreal, but by the second day just his own body position seemed strange, and by day seven, things felt normal. A sense of strangeness returned when the glasses were taken out, though the world looked straight side up; he found himself reaching out with the right hand when he should have used the left, and the other way around. Then he tried the experiment outdoors. [...] He also tried another experiment disrupting the mental link between touch and sight. There he wore a set of mirrors attached to a harness as shown in the figure allowing, and forcing, him to see his body from above. He found the senses adapted in a similar way over three days. His interpretation was that we build up an association between sight and touch by associational learning over a period of time. During certain periods, the disconnect between vision and touch made him feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>his</b> body was not where his touch and proprioceptive feeling told him it was. This out-of-body experience, caused by an altered but normal sensory perception, vanished when he attended to the issue critically, focusing on the disconnect.|$|E
500|$|There is good {{evidence}} that Wulfstan's homiletic style was appreciated by his contemporaries. While yet bishop of London, in 1002 {{he received an}} anonymous letter in Latin praising his style and eloquence. In this letter, an unknown contemporary refuses to do a bit of translation for Wulfstan because he fears he could never properly imitate the Bishop's style The Chronicle of Ely said of his preaching that [...] "when he spoke, it was <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>his</b> listeners were hearing the very wisdom of God Himself." [...] Though they were rhetorically ornate, Wulfstan's homilies show {{a conscious effort to}} avoid the intellectual conceits presumably favoured by educated (i.e. monastic) audiences; his target audience was the common English Christian, and his message was suited to everyone who wished to flock to the cathedral to hear it. Wulfstan refused to include in his works confusing or philosophical concepts, speculation, or long narratives– devices which other homilies of the time regularly employed (likely to the dismay of the average parishioner). He also rarely used Latin phrases or words, though a few of his homilies do survive in Latin form, versions that were either drafts for later English homilies, or else meant to be addressed to a learned clergy. Even so, even his Latin sermons employ a straightforward approach to sermonising. Wulfstan's homilies are concerned only with the [...] "bare bones, but these he invests with a sense of urgency of moral or legal rigorism in a time of great danger".|$|E
500|$|Madness {{frequently}} discovers itself {{merely by}} unnecessary {{deviation from the}} usual mode of the world. My poor friend Smart shewed the disturbance of his mind, by falling upon his knees, and saying his prayers in the street, {{or in any other}} unusual place. Now although, rationally speaking, it is greater madness not to pray at all, than to pray as Smart did, I am afraid there are so many who do not pray, that their understanding is not called in question.Concerning this unfortunate poet, Christopher Smart, who was confined in a mad-house, he had, at another time, the following conversation with Dr [...] Burney:– Burney. 'How does poor Smart do, Sir; is he likely to recover?' Johnson. 'It seems <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>his</b> mind had ceased to struggle with the disease; for he grows fat upon it.' Burney. 'Perhaps, Sir, that may be from want of exercise.' Johnson. 'No, Sir; he has partly as much exercise as he used to have, for he digs in the garden. Indeed, before his confinement, he used for exercise to walk to the ale-house; but he was carried back again. I did not think he ought to be shut up. His infirmities are not noxious to society. He insisted on people praying with him; and I'd as lief pray with Kit [...] Smart as any one else. Another charge was that he did not love clean linen; and I have no passion for it.'– Johnson continued. 'Mankind have a great aversion to intellectual labour; but even supposing knowledge to be easily attainable, more people would be content to be ignorant than would take even a little trouble to acquire it.' ...|$|E

500|$|In October 1971, Dyer {{accompanied}} Bacon to Paris for {{the opening}} of the artist's retrospective at the Grand Palais. The show was the high point of Bacon's career to date, and he was now being described as Britain's [...] "greatest living painter". Dyer was now a desperate man, and although he was [...] "allowed" [...] to attend, he was well aware that he was [...] "slipping", in every sense, out of the picture. To draw Bacon's attention he earlier planted cannabis in Bacon's flat, then phoned the police, and he had attempted suicide on a number of occasions. Dyer committed suicide, via an overdose of barbiturates, {{on the eve of the}} Paris exhibition in their shared hotel room. Bacon spent the following day surrounded by people eager to meet him. In mid-evening he was informed that Dyer had taken an overdose of barbiturates and was dead. Though devastated, Bacon continued with the retrospective and displayed powers of self-control [...] "to which few of us could aspire", according to Russell. Bacon was deeply affected by the loss of Dyer, and he had recently lost four other friends and his nanny. From this point on, death haunted his life and work. Though he gave a stoic appearance at the time, he was inwardly broken. He did not express his feelings to critics, but later admitted to friends that [...] "daemons, disaster and loss" [...] now stalked him <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>his</b> own version of the Eumenides. Bacon spent the remainder of his stay in Paris attending to promotional activities and funeral arrangements. He returned to London later that week to comfort Dyer's family. The funeral proved to be an emotional affair for all, and many of Dyer's friends, including hardened East-End criminals, broke down in tears. As the coffin was lowered into the grave one attendant screamed [...] "you bloody fool!". Although Bacon remained stoic throughout, in the following months Dyer preoccupied his imagination as never before. To confront his loss, he painted a number of tributes on small canvasses and his three [...] "Black Triptych" [...] masterpieces.|$|E
