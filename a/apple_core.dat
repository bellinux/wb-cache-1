5|$|Close to the Peary, the Aurora {{receives}} an indistinct distress call from another ship and alters its course to help, but inquiries by Tintin expose that the distress signal is a decoy to delay them. Resuming the journey, they intercept a cable announcing that the Peary expedition {{has reached the}} meteorite but not yet claimed it. While the Peary crew rows to the meteorite, Tintin uses the Auroras seaplane to parachute onto the meteorite and plant the expedition's flag. Tintin makes camp while the Auroras engines are repaired after developing trouble. The next day he discovers that Phostlite accelerates growth, and makes things much larger: his <b>apple</b> <b>core</b> grows into a large tree while a maggot grows into a huge butterfly, and Tintin is menaced by a giant spider that escaped from his lunch box, and immense, explosive mushrooms before rescue arrives. A sudden seaquake shakes the meteorite to its core and it sinks into the sea, just as Tintin and Snowy escape to the Aurora {{with a piece of}} Phostlite. Thereafter Bohlwinkel learns that he is expected to be tried for his crimes. As the Aurora returns home, Captain Haddock steers the ship toward land to refuel not with oil, but with whiskey.|$|E

500|$|Seen {{as a joke}} {{referencing}} {{the demise}} of the Beatles' record label, the Apple logo was presented on Extra Texture as an eaten-away <b>apple</b> <b>core.</b> In addition, the blue inner-sleeve photo of Harrison – [...] "grinning like a Monty Python choirboy", in the words of Robert Christgau – was captioned [...] "OHNOTHIMAGEN" [...] ("Oh not him again"), Harrison's self-deprecating take on his dwindling popularity in 1974–75. The album's full title was a pun on the slogan that street-corner paperboys would yell out to sell late-breaking news editions of their newspapers: [...] "Extra! Extra! Read all about it!" [...] Harrison had intended to call the album Ohnothimagen, until a studio discussion with Paul Stallworth suggested an alternative. According to Harrison, just as he himself was talking about an overdub needing something [...] "extra", Stallworth happened to say the word [...] "texture".|$|E
500|$|An upbeat pop song in {{a similar}} vein to Harrison's 1971 hit [...] "What Is Life", [...] "You" [...] was the most obvious choice for a single off Extra Texture. It was {{released}} in advance of the album, backed by [...] "World of Stone", on 12 September 1975 in Britain (as Apple R 6007) and three days later in the United States (as Apple 1884). The picture sleeve in Britain featured a photo of a smiling Harrison taken on stage by 1974 tour photographer Henry Grossman; the US picture sleeve incorporated Roy Kohara's humorous design for the album, showing blue lettering on a vivid orange background. In another example of the upbeat mood that was otherwise lacking in the musical content of Extra Texture, the single's face labels showed the familiar Apple Records logo as an <b>apple</b> <b>core,</b> a pun on the demise of the company.|$|E
500|$|... "This Guitar" [...] was {{the final}} release for the {{original}} Apple record label, which the Beatles had launched in 1968 as a business enterprise aligned with utopian ideology. The record's face labels reverted to the generic Apple design rather than use the customised design adopted for [...] "You" [...] and Extra Texture, which included a vivid orange and blue colour scheme and an eaten-away <b>apple</b> <b>core</b> {{in place of the}} standard Apple logo. In America and Britain, [...] "This Guitar" [...] was available only in a plain sleeve. Among the alternative packaging available in other markets, the rare Japanese picture sleeve incorporated the colour scheme from the parent album, surrounding an image of Harrison on stage during the 1974 tour. The picture was taken by tour photographer Henry Grossman, who worked extensively with the Beatles in the 1960s. Harrison did no promotion for the single, but his guest appearance on comedian Eric Idle's Rutland Weekend Television 1975 Christmas special, singing the purpose-written [...] "The Pirate Song", heralded a return to form for him in 1976.|$|E

500|$|... "His Name Is Legs" [...] was {{released}} on 22 September 1975 as the final track on Extra Texture (Read All About It). Together with Roy Kohara's album artwork, which [...] "tried to incorporate a 'wacky' theme", according to authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter the song's inclusion contrasted with the melancholic musical content of Extra Texture. The artwork included an inner-sleeve photo of Harrison [...] "grin like a Monty Python choirboy", {{in the words of}} Village Voice critic Robert Christgau, while the face labels credited production to [...] "Ohnothimagen" [...] (Oh, not him again) and showed the Apple Records logo reduced to an <b>apple</b> <b>core.</b> With the [...] "Ohnothimagen" [...] moniker, which also appeared below the LP's inner-sleeve photo and in advertising for the album, Harrison acknowledged his recent unpopularity with music critics. While this gesture was intended as self-deprecation on Harrison's part, Smith has cited it as an example of Harrison's lack of confidence at the time and his need for [...] "a cuddle now and then". Smith was listed in the performer credits as appearing [...] "courtesy of the Oxfordshire County Council".|$|E

McCartney then suggested the addition of <b>Apple</b> <b>Core,</b> but they could not register the name, so they used [...] "Corps" [...] (having the same pronunciation). McCartney later revealed that he had been inspired by René Magritte's painting, Le Jeu de Mourre, featuring an apple with the words [...] "Au revoir" [...] painted on it.

6000|$|... {{and there}} are certain whole poems that I read {{from time to time}} or try to make others read. There is that poem where the manner is unworthy of the matter, being loose and facile, {{describing}} Adam and Eve fleeing from Paradise. Adam asks Eve what she carries so carefully and Eve replies that it is a little of the <b>apple</b> <b>core</b> kept for their children. There is that vision of 'Christ the Less,' a too hurriedly written ballad, where the half of Christ, sacrificed to the divine half 'that fled to seek felicity,' wanders wailing through Golgotha; and there is 'The Saint and the Youth' in which I can discover no fault at all. He loved complexities--'seven silences like candles round her face' is a line of his--and whether he wrote well or ill had always a manner, which I would have known from that of any other poet. He would say to me, 'I am a mathematician with the mathematics left out'--his father was a great mathematician--or 'A woman once said to me, [...] "Mr. Ellis why are your poems like sums?"' and certainly he loved symbols and abstractions. He said once, when I had asked him not to mention something or other, 'Surely you have discovered by this time that I know of no means whereby I can mention a fact in conversation.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The mules were my especial delight; and an hour's {{study of}} a {{constant}} succession of them introduced me to many of their characteristics; for six of these odd little beasts drew each army wagon, and went hopping like frogs through the stream of mud that gently rolled along the street. The coquettish mule had small feet, a nicely trimmed tassel of a tail, perked up ears, and seemed much given to little tosses of the head, affected skips and prances; and, if he wore the bells, or were bedizzened {{with a bit of}} finery, put on as many airs as any belle. The moral mule was a stout, hard-working creature, always tugging with all his might; often pulling away after the rest had stopped, laboring under the conscientious delusion that food for the entire army depended upon his private exertions. I respected this style of mule; and had I possessed a juicy cabbage, would have pressed it upon him, with thanks for his excellent example. The historical mule was a melo-dramatic quadruped, prone to startling humanity by erratic leaps, and wild plunges, much shaking of his stubborn head, and lashing out of his vicious heels; now and then falling flat and apparently dying a la Forrest: a gasp--a squirm--a flop, and so on, till the street was well blocked up, the drivers all swearing like demons in bad hats, and the chief actor's circulation decidedly quickened by every variety of kick, cuff jerk, and haul. When the last breath seemed to have left his body, and [...] "Doctors were in vain," [...] a sudden resurrection took place; and if ever a mule laughed with scornful triumph, that was the beast, as he leisurely rose, gave a comfortable shake, and calmly regarding the excited crowd seemed to say--"A hit! a decided hit! for the stupidest of animals has bamboozled a dozen men. Now, then! what are you stopping the way for?" [...] The pathetic mule was, perhaps, the most interesting of all; for, though he always seemed to be the smallest, thinnest, weakest of the six, the postillion, with big boots, long-tailed coat, and heavy whip, was sure to bestride this one, who struggled feebly along, head down, coat muddy and rough, eye spiritless and sad, his very tail a mortified stump, and the whole beast a picture of meek misery, fit to touch a heart of stone. The jovial mule was a roly poly, happy-go-lucky little piece of horse-flesh, taking everything easily, from cudgeling to caressing; strolling along with a roguish twinkle of the eye, and, if the thing were possible, would have had his hands in his pockets, and whistled as he went. If there ever chanced to be an <b>apple</b> <b>core,</b> a stray turnip, or wisp of hay, in the gutter, this Mark Tapley was sure to find it, and none of his mates seemed to begrudge him his bite. I suspected this fellow was the peacemaker, confidant and friend of all the others, for he had a sort of [...] "Cheer-up,-old-boy,-I'll-pull-you-through" [...] look, which was exceedingly engaging.|$|E
