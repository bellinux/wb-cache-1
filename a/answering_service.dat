2500|$|The drink Slusho! {{served as}} part of the viral {{marketing}} campaign. The drink had already appeared in producer Abrams' previous creation, the TV series Alias. Websites for Slusho! and Taguruato were launched to add to the mythology of Cloverfield. The Japanese phone number in the Tagruato website did work, but only played recorded messages. For example, one of the messages was: [...] "Thank you for calling Tagruato. Due to high call volumes, your call has been transferred to an automated <b>answering</b> <b>service.</b> There are no updates at this time. After the tone, please leave a message, and one of our associates will find you as soon as possible". A building bearing the company logo for Tagruato can also be seen in the TV spot of the 2009 Star Trek film, and Uhura orders a Slusho! during the bar scene. When Cloverfield was hosted at Comic-Con 2007, gray Slusho! T-shirts were distributed to attendees. Fans who had registered at the Slusho! website received e-mails of fictional sonar images before the film's release that showed a deep-sea creature heading toward Manhattan. Fans who ordered merchandise received pieces of torn Tagruato documents and Japanese newspapers along with their products. Slusho! has also appeared in Fringe and Heroes.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout the program, {{listeners}} {{were encouraged}} to dial the toll-free telephone number, 1-888-CAR-TALK (1-888-227-8255), which connected to a 24-hour <b>answering</b> <b>service.</b> Although the approximately 2,000 queries received each week were screened by the Car Talk staff, the questions were unknown to the Magliozzis in advance as [...] "that would entail researching the right answer, which is what? ...Work." [...] Producers selected and contacted the callers several days ahead of the show's Wednesday taping to arrange the segment. The caller spoke briefly to a producer before being connected live with the hosts and was given little coaching other than being told {{to be prepared to}} talk, not to use any written preparation and to [...] "have fun". The show deliberately taped more callers than it had time to air each week {{in order to be able}} to choose the best ones for broadcast. [...] Those segments that did make it to air were generally edited for time. For the last four years of the show, new shows included previously broadcast segments as much as 10 years old. The re-used segments, including re-used puzzlers, were not acknowledged as old material and sometimes new caller material was mixed in alongside the recycled calls.|$|E

40|$|Dialogue-based Question Answering (QA) is {{a highly}} complex task that brings {{together}} a QA system including various natural language processing components (i. e., components for question classification, information extraction, and retrieval) with dialogue systems for effective and natural communication. The dialogue-based access is difficult to establish when the QA system in use is complex and combines many different <b>answer</b> <b>services</b> with different quality and access characteristics. For example, some questions are processed by opendomain QA services with a broad coverage. Others should be processed by using a domain-specific instance ontology for more reliable <b>answers.</b> Different <b>answer</b> <b>services</b> may change their characteristics over time and the dialogue reaction models have to be updated according to that. To solve this problem, we developed introspective methods to integrate adaptable models of the <b>answer</b> <b>services.</b> We evaluated {{the impact of the}} learned models on the dialogue performance, i. e., whether the adaptable models can be used for a more convenient dialogue formulation process. We show significant effectiveness improvements in the resulting dialogues when using the machine learning (ML) models. Examples are provided {{in the context of the}} generation of system-initiative feedback to user questions and answers, as provided by heterogeneous information services. ...|$|R
