5|$|State Senator Richard Madaleno {{requested}} in 2009 {{that the}} Attorney General <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> whether same-sex marriages could {{be recognized by}} the state. In February 2010, Doug Gansler issued an opinion after a nine-month analysis of state laws stating that valid same-sex marriages performed in other states that permit same-sex marriage could be recognized under Maryland law. Gansler stated that the opinion was not binding on the courts and state agencies could begin immediately to recognize out-of-state same-sex marriages. He said that he expected the opinion to be quickly challenged in court.|$|E
5|$|The dating of {{the monuments}} to the Late Preclassic {{indicate}} that the potbelly style may be a later derivative of earlier Olmec colossal heads, although it does not <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> the ethnicity of the sculptors. Potbelly monuments were sometimes reused by later peoples in the region, such as at Sin Cabezas, Copán and Teopán. Arguing against the theory of potbelly sculpture being an Olmec influenced art form is that the direction of diffusion of the style {{appears to have been}} from south to north, while the Olmec heartland lies to the north, on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, which would indicate an expected diffusion from north to south if the Olmecs were indeed the origin of the style.|$|E

25|$|Critics {{also argued}} that Rind et al.'s {{statistical}} approach for controlling for family environment {{as a cause of}} maladjustment was conceptually and methodologically invalid.

25|$|The foreign {{invasion}} theory {{does not}} <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> where the inhabitants went. David Webster {{believed that the}} population should have increased {{because of the lack}} of elite power. Further, it is not understood why the governmental institutions were not remade following the revolts, which happened under similar circumstances in places like China. A study by anthropologist Elliot M. Abrams came to the conclusion that buildings, specifically in Copan, did not require an extensive amount of time and workers to construct. However, this theory was developed during a period when the archaeological evidence showed that there were fewer Maya people than there are now known to have been. Revolutions, peasant revolts, and social turmoil change circumstances, and are often followed by foreign wars, but they run their course. There are no documented revolutions that caused wholesale abandonment of entire regions.|$|E
25|$|After unsuccessfully {{moving to}} {{suppress}} the marijuana before trial, Caballes was convicted of narcotics trafficking and sentenced to 12 {{years in prison and}} a $256,136 fine. The trial judge denied Caballes' motion to suppress, reasoning that the officers had not unnecessarily prolonged the traffic stop, and the indication by the dog, of narcotics in the vehicle, gave them probable cause to search the trunk of Caballes' car. The Appellate Court of Illinois affirmed, but the Illinois Supreme Court reversed, holding that because the dog sniff was performed without reference to specific and articulable facts, it unjustifiably enlarged the scope of the stop into a drug investigation. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case in order to <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> whether the Fourth Amendment requires reasonable suspicion to justify using a drug-sniffing dog during a routine and otherwise legitimate traffic stop.|$|E

25|$|Before the war, many {{observers}} believed the US {{and its allies}} could win but might suffer substantial casualties (certainly more than any conflict since Vietnam), and that the tank battles across the harsh desert might rival those of North Africa during World War II. After nearly 50 years of proxy wars, and constant fears of another war in Europe between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, some thought the Persian Gulf War might finally <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> which military philosophy would have reigned supreme. Iraqi forces were battle-hardened after 8 years of war with Iran, and they were well equipped with late model Soviet tanks and jet fighters, but the antiaircraft weapons were crippled; in comparison, the US had no large-scale combat experience since its withdrawal from Vietnam nearly 20 years earlier, and major changes in US doctrine, equipment and technology since then had never been tested under fire.|$|E

500|$|In short, {{a person}} could refuse to answer a {{question}} if that particular answer could incriminate them, e.g., a professional killer could decline to <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> what his or her occupation was.

500|$|Halloween is a 2007 American slasher film written, directed, and {{produced}} by Rob Zombie.

When Shatner tried to convince Bennett to reconsider, the producer insisted on a meeting at his home. After several hours of discussion Bennett agreed to return. Bennett disagreed with several elements of Shatner's story, feeling that because no one could assuredly <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> God's existence, the ending of the film would never be satisfying. Bennett also told Shatner that the film had the feeling of a tone poem rather than an adventure story. The studio agreed with Bennett, reasoning that the subject matter could be too weighty or offensive to theatergoers.|$|E

Collective consciousness is of key importance to the society, its requisite function without which the society cannot survive. Collective consciousness produces the society and holds it together, {{and at the same time}} individuals produce collective consciousness through their interactions.
