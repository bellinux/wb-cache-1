40|$|Pancreatic {{cancer has}} a poor {{prognosis}} attributed {{in part to}} immune suppression and deactivation of natural killer (NK) cells. Curcuminoids have a potential for improving the therapy of pancreatic cancer given promising results in cancer models and a clinical trial, but their oral absorption is limited. Our objective {{in this study is}} to show curcuminoid anti-oncogenic effects alone and together with human NK cells. We tested curcuminoids in an emulsion of ω- 3 fatty acids and <b>anti-oxidants</b> (Smartfish) regarding their direct cytocidal effect and enhancement of the cytocidal activity of NK cells in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells (Mia Paca 2 and L 3. 6). Curcuminoids (at > 10 microM) with ω- 3 fatty acids and <b>anti-oxidants</b> or with the lipidic mediator resolvin D 1 (RvD 1) (26 nM) induced high caspase- 3 activity in PDAC cells. Importantly, curcuminoids with ω- 3 fatty acids and <b>anti-oxidants</b> or with RvD 1 significantly potentiated NK cell cytocidal function and protected them against degradation. In a co-culture of cancer cells with NK cells, interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production by NK cells was not altered by ω- 3 fatty acids with <b>anti-oxidants</b> or by RvD 1 but was inhibited by curcuminoids. The inhibition was not eliminated by ω- 3 fatty acids or RvD 1 but was relieved by removing curcuminoids after adding NK cells. In conclusion, curcuminoids with ω- 3 fatty acids and <b>anti-oxidants</b> or with RvD 1 have increased cytotoxic activity on PDAC cells alone and with NK cells. The effects of curcuminoids with ω- 3 fatty acids and <b>anti-oxidants</b> on pancreatic cancer will be investigated in a mouse model with humanized immune system...|$|R

2500|$|Stir frying {{has been}} {{promoted}} as healthy and nutritious. Writers extolled the quick cooking at high heat for retaining color, texture, and nutritional value.

Stir-frying bamboo shoots increased their fat content by 528.57% due to the addition of oil, but retained more of the <b>anti-oxidant</b> capacities. With 78.9% retention, stir frying preserved significantly more vitamin C than boiling. Taking into consideration the total retention of antioxidants, the study concluded that stir frying is the method best suited for bamboo shoots.

40|$|Cells {{generate}} unpaired electrons, typically via oxygen- or nitrogen-based by-products during normal {{cellular respiration}} and under stressed situations. These pro-oxidant molecules are highly unstable and may oxidize surrounding cellular macromolecules. Under normal conditions, the reactive oxygen or nitrogen species can {{be beneficial to}} cell survival and function by destroying and degrading pathogens or antigens. However, excessive generation and accumulation of the reactive pro-oxidant species over time can damage proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids. Over time, this oxidative stress can contribute {{to a range of}} aging-related degenerative diseases such as cancer, diabetes, macular degeneration, and Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s diseases. It is well accepted that natural compounds, including vitamins A, C, and E, β-carotene, and minerals found in fruits and vegetables are powerful <b>anti-oxidants</b> that offer health benefits against several different oxidative stress induced degenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). There is increasing interest in developing anti-oxidative therapeutics to prevent AD. There are contradictory and inconsistent reports on the possible benefits of anti-oxidative supplements; however, fruits and vegetables enriched with multiple <b>anti-oxidants</b> (e. g., flavonoids and polyphenols) and minerals may be highly effective in attenuating the harmful effects of oxidative stress. As the physiological activation of either protective or destructive pro-oxidant behavior remains relatively unclear, it is not straightforward to relate the efficacy of dietary <b>anti-oxidants</b> in disease prevention. Here, we review oxidative stress mediated toxicity associated with AD and highlight the modulatory roles of natural dietary <b>anti-oxidants</b> in preventing AD...|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} established that oxidative phenomena {{are involved in}} human T-cell activation (Sekkat, Dornand & Gerber, 1988). In the present work we have studied the effect of different <b>anti-oxidants</b> (scavengers of O 2 -,. OH and lipo-oxygenase inhibitors) on the stimulation of murine T cells. We report here that all the <b>anti-oxidants</b> used suppressed T-lymphocyte proliferation and IL- 2 synthesis, the former effect resulting very likely from the latter. This inhibition was concomitant with the triggering of activation. We also demonstrate that the various <b>anti-oxidants</b> have different biochemical targets. Unlike the other compounds, the phenolic drugs nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), which block lipid peroxidation, affect both signals triggered by the binding of lectin to its receptors: they suppress the rise of intracellular free calcium concentration and inhibit some of the events, depending on the sole protein kinase C activation, namely IL- 2 receptor expression and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) -induced pH change. Our results are discussed {{within the framework of}} a possible involvement of reactive oxygen species and of arachidonic acid derivative(s) in T-cell activation and IL- 2 production...|$|R
