40|$|Recombinant plant-type <b>asparaginases</b> {{from the}} {{cyanobacteria}} Synechocystis sp. PCC (Pasteur culture collection) 6803 and Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, from Escherichia coli {{and from the}} plant Arabidopsis thaliana were expressed in E. coli with either an N-terminal or a C-terminal His tag, and purified. Although {{each of the four}} enzymes is encoded by a single gene, their mature forms consist of two protein subunits that are generated by autoproteolytic cleavage of the primary translation products at the Gly-Thr bond within the sequence GTI/VG. The enzymes not only deamidated asparagine but also hydrolysed a range of isoaspartyl dipeptides. As various isoaspartyl peptides are known to arise from proteolytic degradation of post-translationally altered proteins containing isoaspartyl residues, and from depolymerization of the cyanobacterial reserve polymer multi-L-arginyl-poly-L-aspartic acid (cyanophycin), plant-type <b>asparaginases</b> may not only function in asparagine catabolism but also in the final steps of protein and cyanophycin degradation. The properties of these enzymes are compared with those of the sequence-related glycosylasparaginases...|$|R
40|$|An L-asparaginase (EC 3. 5. 1. 1) {{specific}} for L-asparagine {{has been}} purified from a marine Chlamydomonas species, {{the first such}} enzyme to be purified from a microalga. The purified enzyme (mol. wt. 275 000) possessed a Km for asparagine of 1. 34 x 10 (- 4) M and showed limited antitumour activity in an antilymphoma assay in vivo. Properties of the enzyme are contrasted with those of <b>asparaginases</b> from prokaryotic and eukaryotic sources...|$|R
50|$|The {{rationale}} behind <b>asparaginase</b> {{is that it}} {{takes advantage of the}} fact that acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells and some other suspected tumor cells are unable to synthesize the non-essential amino acid asparagine, whereas normal cells are able to make their own asparagine; thus leukemic cells require high amount of asparagine. These leukemic cells depend on circulating asparagine. <b>Asparaginase,</b> however, catalyzes the conversion of L-asparagine to aspartic acid and ammonia. This deprives the leukemic cell of circulating asparagine, which leads to cell death.|$|E
50|$|The NCCN {{guidelines}} recommend either high-dose radiotherapy {{alone for}} stage I without high risk features, or concurrent chemoradiotherapy for stage I and II {{with either of}} two regimens. <b>Asparaginase</b> containing regimens {{have been used in}} advanced stage disease.|$|E
50|$|After {{researchers}} comparing {{different kinds}} of asparaginases, the one derived from Escherichia coli and Erwinia chrysanthemi {{turned out to have}} the best anti-cancer ability.

40|$|AbstractThe EORTC Children's Leukemia Group (CLG) is a {{spin-off}} {{from the}} EORTC Hemopathies Working Party (adults and children). After {{a decade of}} collaboration in the adult-pediatric group {{it became clear that}} there was not only a large difference in cure rates between children and adults, but many chemotherapeutic-toxic borders were substantially different. During the following decade the CLG was not only a witness of a very exciting battle against childhood leukemia, but it also contributed substantially to better cure rates for these diseases. The main activity of the CLG was concentrated on the field of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Fine tuning of treatment elements using the BFM design as a backbone has been done very successfully over the past decades. The CLG has many achievements, and the major ones include: the 58831 trial showing the superfluity of the prophylactic Central Nervous System (CNS) radiotherapy in ALL patients when a adequate systemic and CNS directed chemotherapy is ascertained. The 58881 trial demonstrated that the assessment of minimal residual disease (MRD) at completion of induction in ALL is a key step in the process to categorizing and allocating patients into different risk groups, and that MRD is a powerful and independent prognostic factor. This same 58881 trial showed the clear difference in efficacy of different <b>asparaginases</b> resulting in an optimization of the use these drugs and a revival of interest for the <b>asparaginases</b> in the treatment of ALL. In the near future the CLG will focus mainly on translational research projects and innovative biologically targeted treatment approaches, on collaborations with other children's leukemia groups in intergroup studies, and on the evaluation of the long-term outcome of childhood cancer survivors...|$|R
40|$|<b>Asparaginases</b> are the {{cornerstone}} therapy of many successful combination regimens {{for the treatment}} of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common malignancy in children and adolescents. The aim of this work was to produce recombinant Erwinia carotovora L-asparaginase II in Escherichia coli fed-batch cultures. Using a robust fed-batch technique with pre-determined exponential feeding rates, our bioreactor culture system yielded 30. 7 grams of dry cell weight and 0. 9 grams of soluble rErAII protein per liter of culture broth. The homogeneous rErAII activity was determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The enzyme Km values for the main substrates L-Asn and L-Gln were 33 x 10 - 6 M and 10 x 10 - 3 M, respectively. Our work shows {{that it is possible to}} produce an active homogeneous rErAII enzyme in the soluble cell fraction through IPTG-induced E. coli fed-batch cultivation...|$|R
40|$|Plant-type L-asparaginases hydrolyze the {{side-chain}} amide bond of L-asparagine or its beta-peptides. They {{belong to}} the N-terminal nucleophile (Ntn) hydrolases and are synthesized as inactive precursor molecules. Activation occurs via the autoproteolytic release of two subunits, alpha and beta, the latter of which carries the nucleophile at its N-terminus. Crystallographic studies of plant-type <b>asparaginases</b> have focused on an Escherichia coli homologue (EcAIII), which has been crystallized in several crystal forms. Although they all {{belong to the}} same P 2 1 2 1 2 1 space group with similar unit-cell parameters, they display different crystal-packing arrangements and thus should be classified as separate polymorphs. This variability stems mainly from different positions of the EcAIII molecules within the unit cell, although they also exhibit slight differences in orientation. The intermolecular interactions that trigger different crystal lattice formation are mediated by ions, which represent the most variable component of the crystallization conditions. This behaviour confirms recent observations that small molecules might promote protein crystal lattice formation...|$|R

40|$|<b>Asparaginases</b> (ASPG, EC 3. 5. 1. 1) {{catalyze}} the hydrolysis of the amide {{group of}} L-asparagine producing L-aspartate and ammonium. Three ASPG, PpASPG 1, PpASPG 2, and PpASPG 3, {{have been identified}} in the transcriptome of maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) that were transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana by agroinfection. The three recombinant proteins were processed in planta to active enzymes and it was found that all mature forms exhibited double activity asparaginase/isoaspartyl dipeptidase but only PpASPG 1 was able to catalyze efficiently L-asparagine hydrolysis. PpASPG 1 contains a variable region of 77 amino acids that is critical for proteolytic processing of the precursor and is retained in the mature enzyme. Furthermore, the functional analysis of deletion mutants demonstrated that this protein fragment is required for specific recognition of the substrate and favors enzyme stability. Potassium has a limited effect on the activation of maritime pine ASPG what is consistent with the lack of a critical residue essential for interaction of cation. Taken together, the results presented here highlight the specific features of ASPG from conifers when compared to the enzymes from angiosperms...|$|R
40|$|Bacterial <b>asparaginases</b> (amidohydrolases, EC 3. 5. 1. 1) are {{important}} enzymes in cancer therapy, especially for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. They are tetrameric enzymes able to catalyze the deamination of L-ASN and, to a variable extent, of L-GLN, on which leukemia cells are dependent for survival. In contrast to other known L-asparaginases, Helicobacter pylori CCUG 17874 type II enzyme (HpASNase) is cooperative {{and has a}} low affinity towards L-GLN. In this study, some critical amino acids forming the active site of HpASNase (T 16, T 95 and E 289) have been tackled by rational engineering {{in the attempt to}} better define their role in catalysis and to achieve {{a deeper understanding of the}} peculiar cooperative behavior of this enzyme. Mutations T 16 E, T 95 D and T 95 H led to a complete loss of enzymatic activity. Mutation E 289 A dramatically reduced the catalytic activity of the enzyme, but increased its thermostability. Interestingly, E 289 belongs to a loop that is very variable in L-asparaginases from the structure, sequence and length point of view, and which could be a main determinant of their different catalytic features...|$|R
40|$|The L-asparaginases from Escherichia coli and Erwinia chrysanthemi are {{effective}} drugs {{that have been}} used in the treatment of acute childhood lymphoblastic leukaemia for over 30 years. However, despite their therapeutic potential, they can cause serious side effects as a consequence of their intrinsic glutaminase activity, which leads to L-glutamine depletion in the blood. Consequently, new <b>asparaginases</b> with low glutaminase activity, fewer side effects and high activity towards L-asparagine are highly desirable as better alternatives in cancer therapy. L-Asparaginase from Helicobacter pylori was overexpressed in E. coli and purified for structural studies. The enzyme was crystallized at pH 7. 0 in the presence of 16 - 19 %(w/v) PEG 4000 and 0. 1 M magnesium formate. Data were collected to 1. 6 A resolution at 100 K from a single crystal at a synchrotron-radiation source. The crystals belong to space group I 222, with unit-cell parameters a = 63. 6, b = 94. 9, c = 100. 2 A and one molecule of L-asparaginase in the asymmetric unit.

40|$|The {{detoxification}} {{of toxic}} cyanide, which is {{formed as a}} byproduct of ethylene biosynthesis in higher plants, starts with the formation of the amino acid 3 ̆b 2 -cyanoalanine (3 ̆b 2 -CA) from cysteine and cyanide. The degradation of 3 ̆b 2 -CA to asparagine and aspartate, respectively, is known to be catalysed by Nitrilase 4 (NIT 4) in vitro. To exclude redundancies in this reaction, the two <b>asparaginases</b> encoded in the Arabidopsis genome were overexpressed in E. coli and tested for their activity with 3 ̆b 2 -CA. The analysis of NIT 4 -expression was performed with 3 ̆b 2 -glucuronidase reportergene plants. Using NIT 4 GFP fusion proteins in a transient expression assay the intracellular localisation of NIT 4 was revealed as cytosolic. After the creation of transgenic NIT 4 -knockout and overexpression lines the conversion of 3 ̆b 2 -CA in these plants was analysed on a physiological and molecular basis. The resulting data proved the involvement of NIT 4 in the in vivo degradation of 3 ̆b 2 -CA. Die Detoxifikation des Atmungsgiftes Cyanid, das in H 6 heren Pflanzen als Nebenprodukt der Ethylenbiosynthese entsteht, beginnt mit der Bildung der Aminos 4 ure 3 ̆b 2 -Cyanoalanin (3 ̆b 2 -CA) aus Cystein und Cyanid. Der Abbau von 3 ̆b 2 -CA wird durch Nitrilase 4 (NIT 4) katalysiert, die es zu Asparagin bzw. Aspartat umsetzt.

40|$|Structural {{studies of}} {{proteins}} aim at elucidating the atomic details of molecular interactions in biological processes of living organisms. These studies {{are particularly important}} in understanding structure, function and evolution of proteins and in defining their roles in complex biological settings. Furthermore, structural studies {{can be used for}} the development of novel properties in biomolecules of environmental, industrial and medical importance. X-ray crystallography is an invaluable tool to obtain accurate and precise information about the structure of proteins at the atomic level. Glutathione transferases (GSTs) are amongst the most versatile enzymes in nature. They are able to catalyze a wide variety of conjugation reactions between glutathione (GSH) and non-polar components containing an electrophilic carbon, nitrogen or sulphur atom. Plant GSTs from the Tau class (a poorly characterized class) {{play an important role in}} the detoxification of xenobiotics and stress tolerance. Structural studies were performed on a Tau class fluorodifen-inducible glutathione transferase from Glycine max (GmGSTU 4 - 4) complexed with GSH (2. 7 Å) and a product analogue Nb-GSH (1. 7 Å). The three-dimensional structure of the GmGSTU 4 - 4 -GSH complex revealed that GSH binds in different conformations in the two subunits of the dimer: in an ionized form in one subunit and a non-ionized form in the second subunit. Only the ionized form of the substrate may lead to the formation of a catalytically competent complex. Structural comparison between the GSH and Nb-GSH bound complexes revealed significant differences with respect to the hydrogen-bonding, electrostatic interaction pattern, the upper part of -helix H 4 and the C-terminus of the enzyme. These differences indicate an intrasubunit modulation between the G-and Hsites suggesting an induced-fit mechanism of xenobiotic substrate binding. A novel binding site on the surface of the enzyme was also revealed. Bacterial type-II L-asparaginases are used in the treatment of haematopoietic diseases such as acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and lymphomas due to their ability to catalyze the conversion of L-asparagine to L-aspartate and ammonia. Escherichia coli and Erwinia chrysanthemi <b>asparaginases</b> are employed for the treatment of ALL for over 30 years. However, serious side-effects affecting the liver and pancreas have been observed due to the intrinsic glutaminase activity of the administered enzymes. Structural studies on Helicobacter pylori L-asparaginase (HpA) were carried out in an effort to discover novel L-asparaginases with potential chemotherapeutic utility in ALL treatment. Detailed analysis of the active site geometry revealed structurally significant differences between HpA and other Lasparaginases that may be important for the biological activities of the enzyme and could be further exploited in protein engineering efforts...|$|R
