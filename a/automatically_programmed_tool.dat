50|$|ICAM {{sought to}} develop {{procedures}} (IDEF) processes (Group Technology) and software (CAD/CAM) that would integrate all operations in Aerospace manufacturing and thus greatly reduce costs. Earlier the USAF Manufacturing Technology Program had funded the <b>Automatically</b> <b>Programmed</b> <b>Tools</b> (APT) language for programming Numerically Controlled (NC) machine tools. To close the data gap between parts design and manufacturing, {{one of the}} ICAM goals was to develop CAD software that would automatically generate numerical control programs for the very complex Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) machine tools used throughout the Aerospace industry. A serious issue was the incompatibility of data produced by the many CAD systems in use at the time. USAF/ICAM called {{a meeting at the}} National Bureau of Standards (now known as National Institute of Standards and Technology or NIST) in 1978 to address this issue. Boeing offered to sell its CAD translation software to USAF for one United States dollar. USAF accepted this offer and contracted NIST to bring together a group of users and vendors, including Boeing, General Electric, Xerox, Computervision, Applicon and others to further develop and test this software. Though it was the practice to begin the name of ICAM developments with the word integrated (for example the IDEFs) believing that there would be rapid development of graphical exchange software, USAF decided that the IGES would be the Initial Graphics Exchange Specification not the Integrated Graphics Exchange Specification.|$|R

40|$|The APT code {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used {{software}} tools for complex numerically controlled (N/C) machining. APT is an acronym for <b>Automatically</b> <b>Programmed</b> <b>Tool</b> and is used to denote the programming language. Development of the APT language and software system was begun in the late 1950 's as a U. S. government sponsored industry and university research effort. APT is a "problem oriented" language that was developed for the explicit purpose of aiding the N/C machine tools. The original APT program contained undocumented nonstandard FORTRAN, thus making porting of the processor to different operating systems difficult. P-APT (Portable APT) is a revised version of APT that was written to conform to the FORTRAN 77 standard. All machine-dependent code has either been replaced or isolated and documented. Machine-tool instructions and geometry definitions are written in the APT language to constitute a "part program". The APT part program is processed by the P-APT software to produce a cutter location (CL) file. This CL file may then be processed by user supplied post processors to convert the CL data into a form suitable for a particular N/C machine tool. This current offering of the P-APT system represents an adaptation, with enhancements, of the public domain version of APT IV/SSX 8. Enhancements include the super pocket feature that allows concave pockets with curved sides and islands. The P-APT system software is organized into two separate programs: the load complex and the APT processor. The load complex handles the table initiation phase and is usually only run when changes to the P-APT processor capabilities are made. This phase initializes character recognition and syntax tables for the P-APT processor by creating FORTRAN block data programs. The P-APT processor consists of four components: the translator, the execution complex, the subroutine library, and the CL editor. The translator examines each APT statement in the part program for recognizable structure and generates a new statement, or series of statements, in an intermediate language. The execution complex processes all of the definition, motion, and related statements to generate cutter location coordinates. The subroutine library contains routines defining the algorithms required to process the sequenced list of intermediate language commands generated by the translator. The CL editor re-processes the cutter location coordinates according to user supplied commands to generate a final CL file. The APT language is a statement oriented, sequence dependent language. With the exception of such programming techniques as looping and macros, statements in an APT program are executed in a strict first-to-last sequence. In order to provide programming capability for the broadest possible range of parts and machine tools, APT input (and output) is generalized, as represented by 3 -dimensional geometry and tools, and is arbitrarily uniform, as represented by the moving tool concept and output data in absolute coordinates. P-APT is written in FORTRAN 77 for execution on Sun 4 series computers running SunOS. Although P-APT is written in standard FORTRAN 77 and was designed to be readily portable code, it has only been fully tested on a Sun 4 series computer running SunOs. By making documented modifications to the source code, it may also be ported to a DEC VAX series computer running VMS. P-APT required 3. 1 Mb of RAM for execution. A minimum of 16 Mb of RAM and 32 Mb of disk space used for swap space is recommended. The standard distribution medium for this program is a. 25 inch streaming magnetic tape cartridge in UNIX tar format. P-APT is available by license for a period of ten (10) years to approved licensees. The licensed program product includes the P-APT source code, makefiles, examples, and one set of supporting documentation.

40|$|The APT code {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used {{software}} tools for complex numerically controlled (N/C) machining. APT is an acronym for <b>Automatically</b> <b>Programmed</b> <b>Tools</b> and is used to denote both a language and the computer software that processes that language. Development of the APT language and software system was begun over twenty years ago as a U. S. government sponsored industry and university research effort. APT is a "problem oriented" language that was developed for the explicit purpose of aiding the N/C machine tools. Machine-tool instructions and geometry definitions are written in the APT language to constitute a "part program. " The APT part program is processed by the APT software to produce a cutter location (CL) file. This CL file may then be processed by user supplied post processors to convert the CL data into a form suitable for a particular N/C machine tool. This June, 1989 offering of the APT system represents an adaptation, with enhancements, of the public domain version of APT IV/SSX 8 to the DEC VAX- 11 / 780 for use by the Engineering Services Division of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. Enhancements include the super pocket feature which allows concave and convex polygon shapes of up to 40 points including shapes that overlap, that leave islands of material within the pocket, and that have one or more arcs as part of the pocket boundary. Recent modifications to APT include a rework of the POCKET subroutine and correction of an error that prevented the use within a macro of a macro variable cutter move statement combined with macro variable double check surfaces. Former modifications included the expansion of array and buffer sizes to accommodate larger part programs, and the insertion of a few user friendly error messages. The APT system software on the DEC VAX- 11 / 780 is organized into two separate programs: the load complex and the APT processor. The load complex handles the table initiation phase and is usually only run when changes to the APT processor capabilities are made. This phase initializes character recognition and syntax tables for the APT processor by creating FORTRAN block data programs.

The execution complex processes all of the definition, motion, and related statements to generate cutter location coordinates. The subroutine library contains routines defining the algorithms required to process the sequenced list of intermediate language commands generated by the translator. The CL editor re-processes the cutter location coordinates according to user supplied commands to generate a final CL file. A sample post processor is also included which translates a CL file into a form for use with a Wales Strippit Fabramatic Model 30 / 30 sheet metal punch. The user should be able to readily develop post processors for other N/C machine tools. The APT language is a statement oriented, sequence dependent language. With the exception of such programming techniques as looping and macros, statements in an APT program are executed in a strict first-to-last sequence. In order to provide programming capability for the broadest possible range of parts and of machine tools, APT input (and output) is generalized, as represented by 3 -dimensional geometry and tools, and arbitrarily uniform, as represented by the moving tool concept and output data in absolute coordinates. A command procedure allows the user to select the desired part program, ask for a graphics file of cutter motions in IGES format, and submit the procedure as a batch job, if desired. The APT system software is written in FORTRAN 77 for batch and interactive execution and has been implemented on a DEC VAX series computer under VMS 4. 4. The enhancements for this version of APT were last updated in June, 1989.
