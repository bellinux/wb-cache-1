Several women workers were sent from the Philadelphia Mint to teach those in New Orleans how to adjust money. About this time, the mint {{employed}} forty-four women. Thirty-nine worked as <b>adjusters</b> – employees who weighed the unstamped coin planchets {{to make sure they}} were the proper weight before coining. These women would sit at long narrow tables, filing the planchets down to the proper weight, wearing special aprons with pouches attached to the sleeves and the waist to catch the excess dust. Five women served as counters and packers before the coins were shipped to Washington, D.C. Some women were eventually employed at the coining presses.|$|E

The Commonwealth pledged to provide $150million in relief {{over a three-year}} period to the government of Queensland in exchange for deregulation; however, its offer was initially rejected. Planes flew claims <b>adjusters</b> and other officials to Innisfail, establishing an insurance emergency service in the city hall, while the Insurance Council of Queensland deployed its special emergency service employees for the first time. As a result of severe damage, a disaster declaration for northern regions was issued by Queensland Government on 4February. The first $10million in aid from the state government, paid by the federal government, was supplied the same day. Meanwhile, the SES continued its cleanup efforts, removing debris and repairing structures.

40|$|Claims {{fraud is}} an {{increasingly}} vexing problem confronting the insurance industry. In this empirical study, we apply Kohonen's Self-Organizing Feature Map to classify automobile bodily injury (BI) claims {{by the degree}} of fraud suspicion.

Comparative experiments illustrate the potential usefulness of the proposed methodology. We show that this technique performs better than both an insurance <b>adjuster's</b> fraud assessment and an insurance investigator's fraud assessment with respect to consistency and reliability. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND One vexing problem confronting the property-casualty insurance industry is claims fraud. Individuals and conspiratorial rings of claimants and providers unfortunately can and do manipulate the claim processing system for their own undeserved benefit (Derrig and Ostaszewski, 1994; Cummins and Tennyson, 1992).

25|$|The belt loops are of new design, {{much wider}} (double width) {{and there is}} 8 of them now {{compared}} to 7 in the past. The waist adjustment cord has been removed and replaced by the Velcro waistband fine-adjusters, one at each hip. Instead of a knee pocket which could only accommodate soft knee inserts in the past, the knee area now features multi-layered comprehensive design which allows external hard-type knee pads to be inserted and secured. Back of the knee area has Velcro hook and loop patches to further secure knee inserts around the knee area. Cuffs {{at the bottom of}} the trousers do not use drawstrings anymore for blousing; those have been again replaced by the Velcro cuff <b>adjusters.</b> Further changes as part of the transition to OCP removed the pockets for insertable knee pads altogether, along with the replacement of more Velcro with buttons.|$|E
25|$|Violins are tuned {{by turning}} the pegs in the pegbox under the scroll, or by {{adjusting}} the fine tuner screws at the tailpiece. All violins have pegs; fine tuners (also called fine <b>adjusters)</b> are optional. Most fine tuners consist of a metal screw that moves a lever attached to the string end. They permit very small pitch adjustments much more easily than the pegs. By turning one clockwise, the pitch becomes sharper (as the string is under more tension) and turning one counterclockwise, the pitch becomes flatter (as the string is under less tension). Fine tuners on {{all four of the}} strings are a practical necessity for playing steel-core strings, and some players use them with synthetic strings as well. Since modern E strings are steel, a fine tuner is typically fitted for that string. Fine tuners are not used with gut strings, which are more elastic than steel or synthetic-core strings and do not respond adequately to the very small movements of fine tuners.|$|E
25|$|When {{a string}} is bowed or plucked, it vibrates and moves {{the air around}} it, {{producing}} sound waves. Because the string is quite thin, not much air is moved by the string itself, and consequently if the string was not mounted on a hollow body, the sound would be weak. In acoustic stringed instruments such as the cello, this lack of volume is solved by mounting the vibrating string on a larger hollow wooden body. The vibrations are transmitted to the larger body, which can move more air and produce a louder sound. Different designs of the instrument produces variations in the instrument’s vibrational patterns and thus changes {{the character of the}} sound produced. A string’s fundamental pitch can be adjusted by changing its stiffness, which depends on tension and length. Tightening a string stiffens it by increasing both the outward forces along its length and the net forces it experiences during a distortion. A cello can be tuned by adjusting the tension of its strings, by turning the tuning pegs mounted on its pegbox, and tension <b>adjusters</b> (fine tuners) on the tail piece.|$|E
50|$|While it is {{not always}} clear when a {{policyholder}} may benefit from hiring a public adjuster, the most benefit is likely to be realized if they are engaged immediately in case of a loss. Shortly after the insurance company receives notice of a loss, an adjuster representing the insurance company will visit the policyholder to gather facts about how the loss occurred, the magnitude of the loss, and the possibility of subrogation. Incorrect, incomplete or inadequately expressed answers to the <b>adjuster's</b> questions may reduce the amount that can be claimed. A public adjuster engaged early in the process, before the fact-finding stage, will have more opportunity to help the policyholder receive a fair settlement for all losses legitimately covered under the insurance policy. However, any time during negotiations with the insurance company and even after a settlement has been received by an insured, a public adjuster may be able to negotiate for a higher amount.|$|R

Babz Chula {{appeared as a}} Cabal scientist in the season premiere, a character that was originally a German male; Chula accepted Tapping's offer {{to appear on the}} show after they met at an awards ceremony. Christopher Gauthier appears as Walter and his alter-ego, [...] "the Adjuster", in [...] "Hero". Gauthier modeled the <b>Adjuster's</b> voice from Christian Bale's Batman. The scenes where Walter was worn out from the suit that is killing him mirrored Gauthier's performance because of the suit he had to wear constantly, which consisted of two sets of jogging outfits, cotton padding, and a wetsuit. Because the producers were impressed with Walter, they wanted him to return in the next season. Mandy May, the wife of director Steven A. Adelson, appears in full prosthetics as the abnormal Jack in [...] "Fragments"; May previously appeared on the series as the face of Sally the mermaid. In the same episode, Colin Cunningham played the antagonist Gerald. Cunningham was offered a role because he was long-time friends with some of the crew members, as is the same case when it came to casting Anne Marie Loder, wife of director Peter DeLuise, as Rachel. Eureka actress Erica Cerra makes a guest appearance as the telepath Emma in [...] "Veritas".

500|$|Films noir tend {{to revolve}} around heroes {{who are more}} flawed and morally {{questionable}} than the norm, often fall guys {{of one sort or}} another. The characteristic protagonists of noir are described by many critics as [...] "alienated"; in the words of Silver and Ward, [...] "filled with existential bitterness". Certain archetypal characters appear in many films noir—hardboiled detectives, femme fatales, corrupt policemen, jealous husbands, intrepid claims <b>adjusters,</b> and down-and-out writers. Among characters of every stripe, cigarette smoking is rampant. From historical commentators to neo-noir pictures to pop culture ephemera, the private eye and the femme fatale have been adopted as the quintessential film noir figures, though they do not appear in most films now regarded as classic noir. Of the twenty-six National Film Registry noirs, in only four does the star play a private eye: The Maltese Falcon, The Big Sleep, Out of the Past, and Kiss Me Deadly. Just four others readily qualify as detective stories: Laura, The Killers, The Naked City, and Touch of Evil.|$|E

2500|$|Insurance company claims {{departments}} {{employ a}} large number of claims <b>adjusters</b> supported by a staff of records management and data entry clerks. [...] Incoming claims are classified based on severity and are assigned to <b>adjusters</b> whose settlement authority varies with their knowledge and experience. [...] The adjuster undertakes an investigation of each claim, usually in close cooperation with the insured, determines if coverage is available {{under the terms of the}} insurance contract, and if so, the reasonable monetary value of the claim, and authorizes payment.|$|E
40|$|As {{commonly}} known, {{to evaluate}} the claims reserve (otherwise known as the provision for outstanding claims), the loss adjuster uses as a first component the claims reserve given by {{the sum of the}} estimated provision for each outstanding claim (known as case reserve). Traditional statistical-actuarial methods are used to control and/or asseverate the evaluation and recent developments have tended to ensure that these enable an independent assessment of the claims reserve. In some European countries, a large subset of motor liability claims is managed within a direct reimbursement (DR) scheme. In Italy, the introduction of the direct compensation CARD system for third-party liability insurance has resulted in greater attention in the use of these traditional methods due to the heterogeneity of the data available for evaluations. This paper presents the results of a study undertaken to define a calculation method that, using the different assumptions that describe the evolution of settlement mechanisms, is able to quantify the claims reserve. The proposed methodology reduces the loss <b>adjuster’s</b> discretion in applying statistical methods since all assumptions must be made explicit and can hence be monitored and controlled. Furthermore, a stress test can be performed on all the parameters that influence the settlement and thus the claims reserve. Finally, in a backtesting perspective, the proposed methodology enables an ex-post analysis of actual cash flow deviations compared to expected values, identifying the variables that lead to these differences. In particular, a calculation method is presented that using the different assumptions describing the evolution of the settlement of different claim handling procedures (Non-Card, Card, Handler Forfait and Debtor Forfait) is able to quantify the claims reserve. Via simulations, future payments, the expected value of the claims reserve and some indicators of variability are also estimated. The numerical application allows comparing the results obtained with those deriving from the application of traditional statistical methods. The problem of aggregating the four claim handling procedures is dealt with by using copulas with the goal of building a single distribution of the aggregate claims reserve. Furthermore, in a Solvency II perspective, the capital requirement is determined against the reserve risk based on the internal model proposed and is compared with the standard formula proposed by EIOPA...|$|R

2500|$|Disengagement {{theory was}} {{developed}} by Cumming and Henry. According to this theory, older adults and society engage in a mutual separation from each other.

Additionally, disengagement leads to higher morale maintenance than if older adults try to maintain social involvement. This theory is heavily criticized for having an escape clause - namely, that older adults who remain engaged in society are unsuccessful <b>adjusters</b> to old age.|$|E
2500|$|The {{detection}} of insurance fraud generally occurs in two steps. [...] The {{first step is}} to identify suspicious claims that have a higher possibility of being fraudulent.

[...] Suspicious claims can also be submitted to “special investigative units”, or SIUs, for further investigation. [...] These units generally consist of experienced claims <b>adjusters</b> with special training in investigating fraudulent claims. [...] These investigators look for certain symptoms associated with fraudulent claims, or otherwise look for evidence of falsification of some kind. [...] This evidence can then be used to deny payment of the claims or to prosecute fraudsters if the violation is serious enough.|$|E
