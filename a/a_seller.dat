Toriyama used black drawing ink made by Pilot, but his color ink was produced by Luma and applied with a ten-year-old fine point Tenshōdō brush. His whiteout was also made by Luma. He received free Kent paper, similar to Bristol board, from <b>a</b> <b>seller</b> connected to Shueisha, and used a 0.5mm 2B lead mechanical pencil and a wide ruler at least 30cm long.|$|E
40|$|Click on the DOI link {{to access}} the article (may not be free). Trust has been {{extensively}} studied in the buyer-seller context and typically operationalized according to the McKnight tripartite conception of trusting beliefs. The McKnight model identifies three beliefs (integrity, benevolence, and competence) as the key components of trust. However, limited research has examined the relative effect of these three individual trusting beliefs on satisfaction and purchase behavior in the buyer-seller context. To address this gap, we posit that a buyer's beliefs in <b>a</b> <b>seller's</b> integrity and benevolence have stronger influences on satisfaction than a belief in <b>a</b> <b>seller's</b> competence. In contrast, a buyer's belief in <b>a</b> <b>seller's</b> competence has <b>a</b> stronger influence on purchase behavior as compared to beliefs in <b>a</b> <b>seller's</b> integrity and benevolence. The results from a buyer-broker simulation study support that (1) a buyer's belief in <b>a</b> <b>seller's</b> benevolence is <b>a</b> stronger predictor of satisfaction than the belief in <b>a</b> <b>seller's</b> competence; (2) <b>a</b> buyer's belief in <b>a</b> <b>seller's</b> competence is <b>a</b> stronger predictor of purchase behavior than are beliefs in <b>a</b> <b>seller's</b> integrity and benevolence. This research enhances our theoretical understanding about which dimensions of trust play more important roles in influencing satisfaction and purchase behavior, respectively. This research also provides guidance to practitioners enabling them {{to focus on the}} development and training foci that best prepare customer relationship employees on the diverse aspects of trust most salient to customer needs, such as, emphasizing competence over benevolence for infrequent purchases, or emphasizing benevolence for potentially frequent purchases...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{characterize}} the unique equilibrium in which high ability sellers always announce {{the quality of}} their items truthfully, in a repeated game model of experienced good markets with adverse selection on <b>a</b> <b>sellers</b> propensity to supply good quality items. In this equilibrium <b>a</b> <b>sellers</b> value function strictly increases in reputation and <b>a</b> <b>sellers</b> type is revealed within 8 ̆ 5 nite time. The analysis highlights a new reputation mechanism based on an endogenous complementarity the market places between <b>a</b> <b>sellers</b> honesty in pre-trade communication (trust) and his/her ability to deliver good quality (reputation). As maintaining honesty is less costly for high ability sellers who anticipate less bad news to disclose, they can signal their ability by communicating in a more trustworthy manner. Applying this model, we examine the extent to which consumer feedback systems foster trust in online markets, including the possibility that sellers may change identities or exit...|$|R

Community purchased an 18,000kilogram (40,000lb) container of Maraba beans at the above-average rate of US$3 per kilogram.

25|$|The seller {{takes the}} risk that the buyer may default on the contract, depriving the seller of the {{expected}} revenue stream. More important, <b>a</b> <b>seller</b> normally limits its risk by buying offsetting protection from another party— that is, it hedges its exposure. If the original buyer drops out, the seller squares its position by either unwinding the hedge transaction or by selling a new CDS to a third party. Depending on market conditions, that may be at a lower price than the original CDS and may therefore involve a loss to the seller.|$|E

Models derived from developments in financial engineering are intriguing but have been unstable and difficult to place the parameters in practice.
