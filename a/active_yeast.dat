So close is the relationship that wine writer Karen MacNeil notes [...] "If Portugal {{is the mother of}} Port, Britain is certainly its father". While there are many theories as to the origin of the fortified wine known as Port, one of the most prevalent is that of the 1678 visit by English wine merchants to a monastery in the Portuguese town of Lamego located along the Douro river. In search of new wines to ship back to England, the merchants came across an abbot in Lamego who was producing a style of wine that the merchants had never encountered before. While fortification of wine had been known for centuries, the fortifying grape spirit was usually added after fermentation, when the wine was already fermented dry. The abbot of Lamego was fortifying his wine during fermentation, which had the effect of killing off the <b>active</b> <b>yeast</b> cells and leaving the wine with high levels of residual sugar. This method produced a very strong, alcoholic wine with noticeable levels of sweetness that was very successful in the English wine market.|$|E

50|$|When the sugars in the fermenting beer {{have been}} almost {{completely}} digested, the fermentation process slows and the yeast cells begin to die and settle {{at the bottom of}} the tank. At this stage, especially if the beer is cooled to around freezing, most of the remaining live yeast cells will quickly become dormant and settle, along with the heavier protein chains, due simply to gravity and molecular dehydration. Conditioning can occur in fermentation tanks with cooling jackets. If the whole fermentation cellar is cooled, conditioning must be done in separate tanks in a separate cellar. Some beers are conditioned only lightly, or not at all. An <b>active</b> <b>yeast</b> culture from an ongoing batch may be added to the next boil after a slight chilling in order to produce fresh and highly palatable beer in mass quantity.|$|E

It is at this time that Logan the [...] "Beer Hunter" [...] makes his appearance. He explains that he has been on the road for nearly a year sampling beers across the U.S. and Europe.

5000|$|Today, {{there are}} several {{retailers}} of baker's yeast; one of the earlier developments in North America is Fleischmann's Yeast, in 1868. During World War II, Fleischmann's developed a granulated active dry yeast which did not require refrigeration, had a longer shelf life than fresh yeast, and rose twice as fast. Baker's yeast is also sold as a fresh yeast compressed into a square [...] "cake". This form perishes quickly, so must be used soon after production. A weak solution of water and sugar {{can be used to}} determine whether yeast is expired.

5000|$|In the mid 1960s, Goebel began {{advertising}} that their beer was [...] "real" [...] (unpasteurized) draft beer. Normally, bottled and canned beer {{had to be}} pasteurized to kill the <b>active</b> <b>yeast</b> left in the beer after brewing was completed, otherwise the buildup of gasses in the bottle would explode them on store shelves or ruin {{the taste of the}} beer even if the bottles stayed intact. This does not affect draft beer, which is kept at refrigerator temperatures from brewery to tap. Goebel's method of achieving this was a bacterium cultivated by the company's chemists that acted specifically on the yeast in the beer, then died harmlessly when the yeast was all consumed. Sales spiked, as people liked the [...] "draft-like" [...] flavor of the beer, but the technique was short-lived, as the bacteria became prevalent everywhere in the brewery, affecting other aspects of the brewing process negatively, and it had to be discontinued. The beer never regained its previous popularity after that point, exacerbated by the gradual changing of tastes in a new generation of beer drinkers who preferred a lighter, sweeter beer.Comedian George Gobel became a spokesman for Goebel Beer for obvious reasons.|$|E

Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolates were obtained from fermentations with grapes from three vineyards of the Vinho Verde Region where commercial yeast strains were used continuously during the last years.
