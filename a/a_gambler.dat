5|$|Such was the {{disappointment}} at losing the Ashes, Collins was stripped {{not only of}} the New South Wales captaincy but also that of his local club, Waverley. Former players, including his former Waverley captain, the influential Monty Noble, publicly criticised Collins' captaincy. Hunter Hendry, viewing the match from the stands, suspected Collins threw the match. Despite his reputation as <b>a</b> <b>gambler,</b> there is no material evidence that Collins ever fixed the result of any cricket match.|$|E

Wyatt, who did not believe in divorce, refused. She ran away with the gambler anyway, and he later {{abandoned}} her in Arizona.|$|E
5|$|Another {{controversial}} issue during Desha's tenure was his disdain for Horace Holley, president of Transylvania University. From the time Holley assumed {{the post of}} president in 1818, the university had risen to national prominence and attracted well-qualified and well-respected faculty members such as Constantine Samuel Rafinesque, Daniel Drake, Charles Caldwell, William T. Barry, and Jesse Bledsoe. However, Holley's New England Unitarian beliefs were too liberal for the tastes of many in Kentucky. Many called Holley an infidel and charged {{that he was a}} drinker and <b>a</b> <b>gambler.</b> He was criticized for spending time at the horse races and for furnishing his home with nude classical statues.|$|E

5|$|Governor John P. Richardson {{had been}} elected in 1886; in 1888 he sought re-nomination, to be met with {{opposition}} from Tillman's farmers. As {{had been done to}} Republican rallies in 1876, Tillman and his followers attended campaign events and demanded that he be allowed equal time to speak. Tillman was a highly talented stump speaker, and when given the opportunity to debate, accused Richardson of being irreligious, <b>a</b> <b>gambler</b> and a drunkard. Even so, Richardson was easily re-nominated by the state Democratic convention, which turned down Tillman's demand for a primary election. Tillman proposed the customary gracious motion that Richardson's nomination be made unanimous.|$|E
5|$|Tom Johnson (born Tom Jackling; c.1750– 21 January 1797) was a bare-knuckle fighter who was {{referred}} to as the Champion of England between 1784 and 1791. His involvement in pugilistic prizefighting is generally seen to have coincided with a renewed interest in the sport. Although a strong man, his success was largely attributed to his technical abilities and his calm, analytical approach to despatching his opponents. But Johnson was less prudent outside the ring; he was <b>a</b> <b>gambler</b> and considered by many of his acquaintances to be an easy mark. He is thought to have earned more money from the sport than any other fighter until nearly a century later, but much of it was squandered.|$|E
5|$|Milt Joyce, {{a county}} {{supervisor}} {{and owner of}} the Oriental Saloon, had a contentious relationship with Doc Holliday. In October 1880, Holliday had trouble with <b>a</b> <b>gambler</b> named Johnny Tyler in Milt Joyce's Oriental Saloon. Tyler had been hired by a competing gambling establishment to drive customers from the Oriental Saloon. Holliday challenged Tyler to a fight, but Tyler ran. Joyce did not like Holliday or the Earps and he continued to argue with Holliday. Joyce ordered Holliday removed from the saloon but would not return Holliday's revolver. But Holliday returned carrying a double-action revolver. Milt brandished a pistol and threatened Holliday, but Holliday shot Joyce in the palm, disarming him, and then shot Joyce's business partner William Parker in the big toe. Joyce then hit Holliday over the head with his revolver. Holliday was arrested and pleaded guilty to assault and battery.|$|E

5|$|Pilcher's {{marriage}} {{was not a}} happy one; <b>a</b> <b>gambler</b> and womaniser, he expected his independently wealthy wife to bail out his debts and {{turn a blind eye}} to his mistresses. The two gradually drifted into separate lives, and after finally confronted with an affair becoming public, Kathleen sued for divorce. The precipitating event was Pilcher having been named as co-respondent in a divorce suit; it was alleged that he had committed adultery with Millicent Knight-Bruce, the wife of Major James Knight-Bruce. The case dragged on through 1910, delayed by Pilcher's inability to return from India to attend the court. Pilcher did not contest his wife's suit, and his own divorce was granted in 1911; he married Millicent, now divorced, in 1913.|$|E
5|$|The Earps {{moved back}} to San Francisco in 1891 in part so Sadie could be closer to her {{half-sister}} Henrietta's family. Earp developed {{a reputation as a}} sportsman and <b>a</b> <b>gambler.</b> He held onto his San Diego properties, but when their value fell, he could not pay the taxes. He was forced to sell the lots. He continued to race horses, but by 1896, he could no longer afford to own them. He raced them on behalf of the owner of a horse stable in Santa Rosa that he managed for her. From 1891 to 1897, they lived in at least four different locations in the city: 145 Ellis St., 720 McAllister St., 514A Seventh Ave. and 1004 Golden Gate Ave. In Santa Rosa, Earp personally competed in and won a harness race.|$|E

Dolley Madison's spirit has been seen near the {{fireplace}} in the main ballroom as well as heading through a closed door to the garden, and her ghost's presence is accompanied {{by the smell of}} lilacs, her favorite flower. A slave girl in the house was allegedly thrown from the third floor landing to the first floor below and killed by a British soldier during the War of 1812, and eyewitnesses have reported hearing her scream. The specter of a British soldier in War of 1812 dress was seen by caretaker James Cypress in the 1950s, and museum superintendent Alric H. Clay claimed that in the 1960s spirits would often turn on the lights and open The Octagon's doors late at night. <b>A</b> <b>gambler</b> shot to death in the house's third-floor bedroom in the late 19th century has sometimes been seen still in the bed he died in, and ghostly footmen have been seen at the front door waiting to receive guests. He was said to have rung a bell shortly before his death and that the ring of the bell often heard in the house is from him. Various witnesses have also reported hearing assorted moans, screams, and footsteps.|$|E
