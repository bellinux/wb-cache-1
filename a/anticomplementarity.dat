40|$|A case of {{transient}} {{nephrotic syndrome}} caused by secondary syphilis is described. A renal biopsy was performed revealing subepithelial hump-like electron-dense deposits and fusion of epithelial foot-processes. Complement C 1 q-binding-activity and <b>anticomplementarity</b> were {{demonstrated in the}} blood, indicating the presence of circulating immune complexes. This strongly suggests that circulating immune complexes are significant in the immunopathogenesis of syphilitic nephropathy...|$|E
40|$|This article {{establishes}} {{necessary and}} sufficient conditions for {{economies of scope}} to exist, while {{taking into account the}} presence or absence of both local cost complementarity and product-specific fixed costs. In some circumstances the test developed here could show that economies of scope to not exist despite local cost complementarity or, alternatively, despite the existence of fixed costs. Conversely, the test could show that fixed costs are sufficient to generate economies of scope despite local cost <b>anticomplementarity.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|The {{principle}} of complementarity in interpersonal {{theory and the}} SASB model (Structural Analysis of Social Behavior) as developed by Benjamin (1974) were used to study how adolescents in a normal group of 60 adolescents {{and a group of}} 42 adolescents with severe behavioural problems rated that they usually behaved in relation to a liked and disliked peer. The peer’s behaviour varied in a systematic way on the dimensions of affiliation and dominance. Complementary behavior was defined as the same behaviour from peer and self and <b>anticomplementarity</b> was defined as opposite behaviour from self in relation the peer’s behavior. Consistent over the two groups complementarity and <b>anticomplementarity</b> were influenced by both the peer’s behaviour and type of relationship with the peer. Friendly behaviour from a liked peer evoked much more complementary friendly behaviour compared to a disliked peer who with the same behaviour evoked almost as much anticomplementary hostile behaviour as complementary friendly behaviour. Hostile behaviour from a disliked peer evoked much more complementary hostile behaviour compared to a liked peer {{with the same kind of}} behavior. Autonomy granting from a liked peer evoked more complementary autonomous behaviour compared to a disliked peer. Differences between the two groups were small and only in relation with a disliked peer. The results were discussed in terms of interpersonal theory and the {{principle of}} complementarity with focus on kind of relationship. Key words: adolescents ’ interpersonal behavior; peer relationshi...|$|E
40|$|Hydropathic <b>anticomplementarity</b> of {{amino acids}} {{indicates}} that peptides derived from complementary DNA strands may form amphiphilic structures and bind one another. By using this concept, {{we have found}} that the antisense peptide Ser-Tyr-Asp-Leu complementary to the segment Gln-Ile-Val-Ala-Gly (residues 55 - 59) in cystatin C (an inhibitor of cysteine proteases) is located at positions 611 - 614 of the beta chain of human C 4, the fourth component of complement. Here we describe and characterize the specific interaction between cystatin C and C 4 by ligand affinity chromatography and ELISA. Interaction between the two native proteins was mimicked on replacement of one of them with the corresponding sense-antisense peptide coupled to a carrier protein, and the binding was inhibited by these synthetic peptides in solution. Through the interaction with C 4, cystatin C may play a regulatory role in complement activation that might be of particular importance at tissue sites where both proteins are produced by macrophages...|$|E
40|$|Four {{weeks after}} Containment Vaccination {{undertaken}} against the largest outbreak of smallpox occured in Brazil in 1969, {{that of the}} municipality of Utinga, Bahia, 99 samples of serum were collected from the local population. These samples were classified in four groups: a) - Individuals {{with a history of}} variola prior to the beginning of present outbreak in town (15 sera); "Previous smallpox group"; b) - Individuals with primary vaccination, with no record variola, at the time of containment measures (15 sera). "Primary vaccinated group"; c) - Individuals with no previous record of variola revaccinated with "take" at the time of containment (15 sera 0, "Revaccinated group"; d) - Individuals who contracted variola in present outbreak (54 sera) these were subdivided in four sub-groups, according to dates on which cases ocurred, "Variola in outbreak group". Serological study of samples was done by tests of hemagglutination inhibition, neutralization, and complement fixation. It was observed that HI titers were significantly lower in cases of previous smallpox than in other groups. Although they were slightly higher on revaccinated individuals than on primary vaccinated group and than in the group of variola in outbreak, this difference was not significant. Those same antibodies were present in all cases of variola in outbreak, and it was found that titers decreased in direct proportion to time elapsed from occurrence of cases. Neutralizing antibodies proved to be significantly higher on the revaccinated group than on variola in outbreak group, and higher on these than on primary vaccinated and on the previous smallpox groups. In cases from the variola in outbreak it was verified that neutralizing antibodies remained stable, although with great variation in titers. Tests of complement fixation could not be undertaken on all samples, because many of them proved to have <b>anticomplementarity.</b> However, it was found that complement fixing antibodies diminished rapidly, becoming negative for earlier infections. Finally, the authors suggest that there would be some evidence that HI titers are lower in variola minor under Brazilian conditions than in variola major...|$|E
