5|$|Vonnegut {{published}} his first novel, Player Piano, in 1952. The novel was reviewed positively, {{but was not}} commercially successful. In the nearly 20 years that followed, Vonnegut published several novels that were only marginally successful, such as Cat's Cradle (1963) <b>and</b> <b>God</b> <b>Bless</b> You, Mr. Rosewater (1964). Vonnegut's magnum opus, however, was his immediately successful sixth novel, Slaughterhouse-Five. The book's antiwar sentiment resonated with its readers amidst the ongoing Vietnam War, and its reviews were generally positive. After its release, Slaughterhouse-Five went {{to the top of}} The New York Times Best Seller list, thrusting Vonnegut into fame. He was invited to give speeches, lectures, and commencement addresses around the country and received many awards and honors.|$|E

500|$|Only a few {{of those}} in the water survived. Among them were Archibald Gracie, Jack Thayer and Charles Lightoller, who made it to the capsized {{collapsible}} boat B. Around 12 crew members climbed on board Collapsible B, and they rescued those they could until some 35 men were clinging precariously to the upturned hull. Realising the risk to the boat of being swamped by the mass of swimmers around them, they paddled slowly away, ignoring the pleas of dozens of swimmers to be allowed on board. In his account, Gracie wrote of the admiration he had for those in the water; [...] "In no instance, I am happy to say, did I hear any word of rebuke from a swimmer because of a refusal to grant assistance... was met with the manly voice of a powerful man... 'All right boys, good luck <b>and</b> <b>God</b> <b>bless</b> you'." [...] Several other swimmers (probably 20 or more) reached Collapsible boat A, which was upright but partly flooded, as its sides had not been properly raised. Its occupants had to sit for hours in a foot of freezing water, and many died of hypothermia during the night.|$|E

500|$|Knox did not record when {{or how he}} was {{converted}} to the Protestant faith, but perhaps the key formative influences on Knox were Patrick Hamilton and George Wishart. Wishart was a reformer who had fled Scotland in 1538 to escape punishment for heresy. He first moved to England, where in Bristol he preached against the veneration of the Virgin Mary. He was forced to make a public recantation and was burned in effigy at the Church of St Nicholas {{as a sign of}} his abjuration. He then took refuge in Germany and Switzerland. While on the Continent, he translated the First Helvetic Confession into English. He returned to Scotland in 1544, but the timing of his return was unfortunate. In December 1543, James Hamilton, Duke of Châtellerault, the appointed regent for the infant Mary, Queen of Scots, had decided with the Queen Mother, Mary of Guise, and Cardinal David Beaton to persecute the Protestant sect that had taken root in Scotland. Wishart travelled throughout Scotland preaching in favour of the reformation and when he arrived in East Lothian, Knox became one of his closest associates. Knox acted as his bodyguard, bearing a two-handed sword in order to defend him. In December 1545, Wishart was seized on Beaton's orders by the Earl of Bothwell and taken to the Castle of St Andrews. Knox was present on the night of Wishart's arrest and was prepared to follow him into captivity, but Wishart persuaded him against this course saying, [...] "Nay, return to your bairns [...] <b>and</b> <b>God</b> <b>bless</b> you. One is sufficient for a sacrifice." [...] Wishart was subsequently prosecuted by Beaton's Public Accuser of Heretics, Archdeacon John Lauder. On 1 March 1546, he was burnt at the stake in the presence of Beaton.|$|E

2500|$|The Osbornes {{continued}} to have a light display, but on a much smaller scale well into the 2000s.

Bush" [...] across {{the top and bottom}} of the flag. This display remained up for several years, even as the strands of lights went out and the message was barely readable.|$|E

2500|$|A nine-foot bronze {{statue of}} Risner, sculpted by Lawrence M. Ludtke and {{mounted on a}} five-foot {{pedestal}} of black granite, was commissioned by Perot and dedicated in the Air Gardens at the Air Force Academy on November 16, 2001. In addition to replicating the Risner Award, the statue commemorates Risner and other POWs who were punished for holding religious services in their room at the Hanoi Hilton on February 7, 1971, in defiance of North Vietnamese authorities. The statue was made nine feet tall in memory of Risner's statement, commenting on his comrades singing The Star Spangled Banner <b>and</b> <b>God</b> <b>Bless</b> America, that [...] "I felt like I was nine feet tall and could go bear hunting with a switch." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another account {{represents}} Lamon as {{traveling with}} the full confidence of Lincoln: [...] "It called for courage and the trip was made over the objection of Secretary Seward. 'Mr. Secretary,' said Lincoln, 'I have known to be in many a close place and he's never been in one he didn't get out of. [...] By Jing. [...] I'll risk it. [...] Go, Lamon, <b>and</b> <b>God</b> <b>bless</b> you.'" [...] Yet another account characterizes Lamon as being under Seward's influence and angering Lincoln: [...] "It was under Seward's influence that he actually told Governor Pickens {{that he had come}} to arrange for the withdrawal of the garrison, and that after his return he wrote the governor that he would be back in a few days to assist with the evacuation. [...] He also gave Major Anderson the impression that no relief would be attempted. [...] All this was outrageous, and when Lincoln heard of Lamon's letter to Pickens, he indignantly denied that the man possessed any authority to make such a statement." [...] Missions to Fort Sumter aside, the marshal's position was not an onerous one and afforded Lamon legitimate access to the President. [...] What Lamon took upon himself, however, was to represent himself as Lincoln's bodyguard, which he did out of friendship rather than the requirements of the position.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the {{decision}} to do an episode about Anne Frank, Murphy said, [...] "We have a great writing staff but I will take credit for that. One of the things we've done on the show is we take historical figures – {{last year was the}} Black Dahlia and this year is Anne Frank. The Black Dahlia particularly was a case that was never solved so we solved that case in our way. The Anne Frank thing was always interesting to me because after the war, much like the Anastasia case, there were many women who came forward after that diary and said, 'Well I'm the real Anne Frank,' and they were struck down. Many of them were found to be mentally ill and suffering from schizophrenia, so I read about those cases. Before we even wrote one word of it, I thought there was sort of only one actress I was interested in playing Anne Frank and that was Franka. So I brought her in and said, 'I'm gonna write this for you and would you do it.' And we had no script because we were very early on in the season. She loved the story and I sorta swore her to secrecy <b>and</b> <b>God</b> <b>bless</b> her heart she had like five months without telling anybody. I love how it came together." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the general}} election, Symington was {{challenged}} by Democratic nominee Eddie Basha, {{who was known}} in {{the state as a}} grocery store magnate as CEO and Chairman of Bashas'. Prior to the general election, Basha had led Symington in opinion polls by 15 to 20 points. However, the midterm elections of 1994 were a landslide for Republicans, which likely benefited Symington as well, despite his vulnerability due to the controversies that had emerged during his first term in office. Symington defeated Basha, winning 52% of the vote to Basha's 44%. Basha had refused to resort to negative campaigning until {{the final days of the}} campaign when it was likely too late, which political analysts pointed to as the reason for his loss. In addition, Symington had highlighted Basha's statement during a debate hosted by the League of Women Voters that the public school system [...] "can be the surrogate family to help children and parents," [...] which led Symington to declare that Basha believed the [...] "state can take the place of the family." [...] After defeating Basha, Symington, in his election night victory speech, pledged to try to further reduce state income taxes during the course of his second term, as well as continue to eliminate regulatory burden on businesses, and also to [...] "get tough on crime." [...] Symington also declared his upset victory a [...] "miracle" [...] and a [...] "revolution," [...] saying the people [...] "want their country back and they want their taxes lowered. Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan started all this <b>and</b> <b>God</b> <b>bless</b> them." ...|$|E
