5|$|Each {{station was}} {{built as a}} one-storey {{building}} around a square courtyard. The side adjacent to the railway line was left open, and wings extended from the building along the platform on each side. Other than the brick platform faces, chimneys and foundations, the stations were built entirely of wood. Each station held first class and ordinary reception rooms for mourners, a first class and an ordinary refreshment room, {{and a set of}} apartments for LNC staff. The refreshment rooms at both stations were licensed (permitted to sell alcohol). The train crews would generally wait in these refreshment rooms until the trains were ready to return to London, and on at least one occasion (on 12 January 1867) the driver became so drunk that the fireman had to drive the train back to London. This incident prompted a complaint from the LSWR and from that time the LNC provided the train crew with <b>a</b> <b>free</b> <b>lunch,</b> provided they drank no more than one pint of beer.|$|E
