25|$|It is {{possible}} to have added tone chords {{with more than one}} added note. The most commonly encountered of these are 6/9 chords, which are basic triads with the 6th and 2nd notes of the scale added. These can be confusing because of the use of 9, yet the chord does not include the 7th. <b>A</b> <b>good</b> <b>rule</b> of thumb is that if any added note is less than 7, then no 7th is implied, even if there are some notes shown as greater than 7.|$|E

2500|$|Length – Boards for {{children}} are {{as short as}} boards for racers, or [...] "alpine" [...] riders, are as long as [...] Most people ride boards in the [...] range. Board length used to {{be judged by the}} height of your chin. If a board held next to the frontside of your body came to your chin then it was an acceptable length. Due to the development of new technologies and board shapes, people can now ride a wider range of board sizes. Rather, the length of a snowboard corresponds mainly to the style, weight, and preference of the rider. <b>A</b> <b>good</b> <b>rule</b> of thumb is to stay within the recommended manufacturer weight range. The longer the board, the more stable it is at high speed, {{but it is also a}} bit tougher to maneuver. Another factor riders consider when selecting a snowboard is the type of riding it will be used for, freestyle boards being shorter than all-mountain boards.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} {{formulas}} that viticulturist and winemakers {{can use that}} utilize the various measurements of sugar, acid and pH level. One method developed {{by researchers at the}} University of California-Davis is the Brix:TA ratio which uses the ratio of brix degrees to the TA measurements. For example, a wine with 22°Bx and [...]75 TA will have almost a 30:1 Brix:TA ratio. According to the Davis researchers, the most balanced table wines tend to have a Brix to TA ratio between 30:1 - 35:1. Another method is to multiply the pH reading by itself and then multiply that number by the Brix reading. Using this method, when white wine grapes gets close to 200 and red wine grapes close to 260, it can be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>rule</b> of thumb of when to harvest. For example, white wine grapes have a pH of 3.3 and Brix of 20, after going through that formula they will have a finally number of 217.80 which is well within an acceptable harvest range for some winemakers.|$|E
2500|$|Texas hold 'em {{is often}} {{associated}} with poker tournaments largely because it is played as the main event in many of the famous tournaments, including the World Series of Poker's Main Event, and is the most common tournament overall. Traditionally, a poker tournament is played with chips that represent a player's stake in the tournament. Standard play allows all entrants to [...] "buy-in" [...] for a fixed amount and all players begin with an equal value of chips. Play proceeds until one player has accumulated all the chips in play or a deal is made among the remaining players to [...] "chop" [...] the remaining prize pool. The money pool is redistributed to the players in relation to the place they finished in the tournament. Only {{a small percentage of the}} players receive any money, with the majority receiving nothing. [...] "The percentages are not standardized, but common rules of thumb call for one table" [...] (usually nine players) [...] "to get paid for each 100 entrants," [...] according to poker author Andrew Glazer, in his book, The Complete Idiot's Guide to Poker. <b>A</b> <b>good</b> <b>rule</b> of thumb is that close to 10% of players will be paid in a tournament. As a result, the strategy in poker tournaments can be very different from a cash game.|$|E
