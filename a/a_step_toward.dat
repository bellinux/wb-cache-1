5|$|In 1955 Pei's group took <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> {{institutional}} {{independence from}} Webb and Knapp {{by establishing a}} new firm called I.M. Pei & Associates. (The name changed later to I.M. Pei & Partners.) They gained the freedom {{to work with other}} companies, but continued working primarily with Zeckendorf. The new firm distinguished itself through the use of detailed architectural models. They took on the Kips Bay residential area {{on the east side of}} Manhattan, where Pei set up Kips Bay Towers, two large long towers of apartments with recessed windows (to provide shade and privacy) in a neat grid, adorned with rows of trees. Pei involved himself in the construction process at Kips Bay, even inspecting the bags of concrete to check for consistency of color.|$|E
5|$|Public {{opinion was}} sharply divided. Some {{communities}} supported the rebellion {{for a variety}} of reasons. Others, including Gonzales, declared their loyalty to Mexican President Antonio López de Santa Anna's centralist government. Local leaders began calling for a Consultation to determine whether a majority of settlers favored independence, a return to federalism, or the status quo. Although some leaders worried that Mexican officials would see this type of gathering as <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> revolution, by the end of August most communities had agreed to send delegates to the Consultation, scheduled for October 15. In the interim, many communities formed militias to protect themselves from a potential attack by military forces.|$|E
5|$|At the mall, Michael {{opens to}} the women about his {{discomfort}} with Jan. Among other things, he tells them Jan has been videotaping them having sex and watching it with him afterwards. All the women assure Michael that Jan's behavior is not normal and urge {{him to get out}} of the relationship. He remains conflicted about what he should do about Jan, but at Phyllis's prompting he finally admits to himself that he wants to break up with her. Michael thanks them for their help by treating them to one item each at Victoria's Secret. On the drive back, Pam takes <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> asserting herself by changing a flat tire on Meredith Palmer's (Kate Flannery) car.

25|$|Burlingame was {{a potent}} factor in {{securing}} Rhode Island State constitutional prohibition for 1884-1887. Considered a suffrage luminary, she authored the leaflet, “An Appeal to Women’s Missionary Societies Urging Church Women to Support Woman Suffrage as <b>a</b> <b>Step</b> <b>Toward</b> More Efficient Missionary Work,” which was printed and {{distributed by the}} National American Woman Suffrage Association among missionary societies.|$|E

25|$|In July 1998, {{through the}} efforts of Bishop Henry J. Mansell, it was {{announced}} that the remains of Father Baker would be relocated from nearby Holy Cross Cemetery and reinterred in the Basilica.

25|$|On 25 July 1914, {{the council}} of ministers was held in Krasnoye Selo at which Tsar Nicholas II decided to {{intervene}} in the Austro-Serbian conflict, <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> general war. He put the Russian army on alert on 25 July. Although this was not mobilization, it threatened the German and Austrian borders and looked like a military declaration of war.|$|E
25|$|From the Middle Ages {{well into}} the 18th century, Hungary and Poland had shared a {{historic}} common border, and the two peoples had always enjoyed good-neighborly relations. Following the Munich Agreement (September 30, 1938) the two countries had worked together to restore their historic common border. <b>A</b> <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> their goal was realized with the First Vienna Award (November 2, 1938).|$|E

25|$|After {{the success}} of the Wuchang Uprising, many other protests {{occurred}} throughout the country for various reasons. Some of the uprisings declared restoration (光復) of the Han Chinese rule. Other uprisings were <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> independence, and some were protests or rebellions against the local authorities. Regardless the reason for the uprising the outcome was that all provinces in the country renounced the Qing dynasty and joined the ROC.|$|E
25|$|The state {{legislature}} took <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> rectifying {{the situation in}} 1947. The legislature enacted a statute which gave the state engineer the authority to adjudicate water rights and settle disputes. However, {{there is no evidence}} that this discretion was ever exercised. A second step was taken in 1961 when the legislature passed the state's first water rights act, and barred any new use right claims after January 1, 1962.|$|E
25|$|In the Western world, {{agricultural}} technology {{companies such as}} Tiny Farms have been founded {{with the aim of}} modernizing insect rearing techniques, permitting the scale and efficiency gains required for insects to displace other animal proteins in the human food supply.

25|$|Foster {{took his}} own advice and became a union {{business}} agent for a local of the Brotherhood of Railway Carmen of America in Chicago. He continued his syndicalist campaign, this time through the International Trade Union Educational League, while obtaining a position as a general organizer for the AFL in 1915. His syndicalism led him to drop any criticism of the more conservative union leaders; in his eyes, organizing workers was <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> dismantling capitalism. The ITUEL did not so much seek to take power in those organizations in which its members were active, as to steer them in a more progressive direction.|$|E
25|$|Rutskoy called Yeltsin's move <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> a coup d'etat. The next day, the Constitutional Court {{held that}} Yeltsin had {{violated}} {{the constitution and}} could be impeached. During an all-night session, chaired by Khasbulatov, parliament declared the president's decree null and void. Rutskoy was proclaimed president and took the oath on the constitution. He dismissed Yeltsin and the key ministers Pavel Grachev (defense), Nikolay Golushko (security), and Viktor Yerin (interior). Russia now had two presidents and two ministers of defense, security, and interior. It was dual power in earnest. Although Gennady Zyuganov and other top leaders of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation {{did not participate in}} the events, individual members of communist organizations actively supported the parliament.|$|E
25|$|The {{period of}} the Helvetic Republic is still very {{controversial}} within Switzerland. It represents {{the first time that}} Switzerland as a unified country existed and <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> the modern federal state. For the first time the population was defined as Swiss, not as members of a specific canton. For cantons like Vaud, Thurgau and Ticino the Republic was a time of political freedom from other cantons. However the Republic also marked a time of foreign domination and revolution. For the cantons of Bern, Schwyz and Nidwalden {{it was a time of}} military defeat followed by occupation. In 1995 the Federal Parliament chose to not celebrate the 200 year anniversary of the Helvetic Republic, but to allow individual cantons to celebrate if they wished.|$|E

25|$|Richard Kayne {{proposed}} {{the idea of}} unambiguous paths {{as an alternative to}} c-commanding relationships, which is the type of structure seen in examples (8). The idea of unambiguous paths stated that an antecedent and an anaphor should be connected via an unambiguous path. This means that the line connecting an antecedent and an anaphor cannot be broken by another argument. When applied to ditransitive verbs, this hypothesis introduces the structure in diagram (8a). In this tree structure {{it can be seen that}} the same path can be traced from either DP to the verb. Tree diagram (7b) illustrates this structure with an example from English. This analysis was <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> binary branching trees, which was a theoretical change that was furthered by Larson's VP-shell analysis.|$|E
25|$|In 1906, {{he finally}} {{achieved}} electoral success {{as one of}} only three Democrats elected to the Washington State Senate, which then had 42 members. Crossing the aisle, he became the leader of progressive Republicans, and successfully built support for the direct primary law of 1907. As a legislator, he also backed the Lake Washington Ship Canal and helped preserve shorelines for the University of Washington and for city parks. He backed local option as <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> the prohibition of alcohol and drafted an amendment to the state constitution that granted women the right to vote in 1910, a decade ahead of the country at large. He was also instrumental in passing the law that allowed formation of port districts. The workman's compensation law he helped to write became a national model.|$|E
25|$|At the National Council of Women's {{session at}} Washington, D. C., 1894, she was elected {{recording}} secretary, {{and in the}} following fall went to Atlanta, Georgia, to speak {{at a meeting of}} the Council in connection with the Exposition. In 1894, she resigned her position as editor of the Missionary Helper, to take effect at the end of that year. Serving for ten years as President of the National Free Baptist W.M.S., Burlingame became convinced that women as a disfranchised class were powerless to carry on efficient mission and reform work. She, therefore, printed a leaflet entitled, “An Appeal to Women’s Missionary Societies Urging Church Women to Support Woman Suffrage as <b>a</b> <b>Step</b> <b>Toward</b> More Efficient Missionary Work.” The National American Woman Suffrage Association printed and distributed several thousand of these leaflets among missionary societies in the churches.|$|E
