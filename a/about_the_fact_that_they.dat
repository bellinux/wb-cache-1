500|$|The {{success of}} the album brought wealth to all {{four members of the}} band; Richard Wright and Roger Waters bought large country houses, and Nick Mason became a {{collector}} of upmarket cars. Some of the profits were invested in the production of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. [...] Engineer Alan Parsons received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Engineered Recording, Non-Classical for The Dark Side of the Moon, and he went on to have a successful career as a recording artist with the Alan Parsons Project. [...] Although Waters and Gilmour have on occasion downplayed his contribution to the {{success of the}} album, Mason has praised his role. [...] In 2003, Parsons reflected: [...] "I think they all felt that I managed to hang the rest of my career on Dark Side of the Moon, which has an element of truth to it. [...] But I still wake up occasionally, frustrated <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> made untold millions and a lot of the people involved in the record didn't." ...|$|E

2500|$|OK Soda {{has been}} remembered more for its unique {{advertising}} campaign than for its fruity flavor. [...] The name and advertising campaign attempted to {{poke fun at}} the [...] "I'm OK, You're OK" [...] pop-psychology of the early 1970s. OK Soda was intentionally marketed at the difficult Generation X and Generation Y markets, and attempted {{to cash in on}} the group's existing disillusionment and disaffection with standard advertising campaigns; the concept was that the youth market was already aware that they were being manipulated by mass-media marketing, so this advertising campaign would just be more transparent about it. [...] Its indirect advertising was a form of rebel advertising similar to the McDonald's commercials for the Arch Deluxe. [...] The campaign was designed by Portland, Oregon-based advertising firm Wieden+Kennedy. [...] Spokespeople for the company and their advertisers were very frank <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were marketing the drink entirely on the [...] "feeling" [...] rather than the taste.|$|E
