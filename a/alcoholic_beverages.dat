5|$|The {{state laws}} {{governing}} <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverages</b> in New Jersey {{are among the}} most complex in the United States, with many peculiarities not found in other states' laws. They provide for 29 distinct liquor licenses granted to manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, and for the public warehousing and transport of <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverages.</b> General authority for the statutory and regulatory control of <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverages</b> rests with the state government, particularly the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control overseen by the state's Attorney General.|$|E

A person only needs to be 18 to own a liquor license, or to sell or serve alcohol (for example, a waiter or supermarket cashier). State law also prohibits an underage person from misrepresenting their age in a licensed establishment.|$|E

40|$|Many {{states of}} the U. S. use {{population}} formulas {{to limit the number}} of on premise or off premise retail <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverage</b> consumption outlets. The purposes of these restrictions are to reduce the negative externalities from <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverage</b> consumption and to limit the spillovers associated with the outlets themselves, such as noise, loitering, crime, and proximity to school children. State population restrictions on outlets may be superior to <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverage</b> control systems that rely on state excise taxation to reduce negative consumption externalities and on local governments to control outlet externalities if the politics of local zoning override outlet spillover considerations. However, a disadvantage of state mandated population formulas is that they cannot take account of differences in <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverage</b> demand that are independent of resident populations. Furthermore, the literature is not conclusive with respect to the effects of outlet limitations on consumption. In this paper we investigate the effects of the number of retail <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverage</b> outlets on beer, wine, and spirits consumption in the U. S. We depart from previous approaches by separating outlets into their on and off premise components. We also examine, for the case of New Jersey, the variation in the market value of <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverage</b> retail licenses that results from the mismatch of outlets from state population formulas with local area <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverage</b> demand. We do so by analyzing data from municipal auctions of new retail licenses and by analyzing the relationship between restaurant meal and drink prices and <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverage</b> licenses. We find small or statistically insignificant off premise outlet effects on <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverage</b> demand, statistically significant employment and income effects on the market value of licenses, and quality constant higher prices in licensed New Jersey restaurants that reflect the opportunity costs of license ownership. state <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverage</b> control policies, retail <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverage</b> licenses...|$|R
5|$|Federal law prohibits <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverages</b> {{from being}} shipped through the mail. New Jersey {{effectively}} prohibits the shipment {{of beer and}} spirits to customers by requiring a liquor license to transport alcohol, but not having any class of liquor license that grants permission to ship beer or spirits. United Parcel Service (UPS) and Federal Express will ship wine to a person's home, but will only deliver beer or hard liquor to a licensed business. Although uncommon, it is legal for a liquor store to deliver <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverages</b> by car or van to a person's home. ABC regulations mandate that the <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverages</b> being delivered are paid for in advance, that they are received by someone 21 or older, and that they take place when the licensed establishment is permitted to be open.|$|E

5|$|Starting in 1738, {{towns in}} New Jersey began issuing liquor {{licenses}} to tavern keepers. Before federal Prohibition in 1919, despite many state liquor statutes, {{the regulation of}} <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverages</b> in New Jersey was almost exclusively local, with wide variations among municipalities. In 1933, after the repeal of Prohibition, the states were again permitted to regulate <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverages.</b> Immediately upon the end of Prohibition in 1933, New Jersey instituted the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, which established and granted rulemaking powers to the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control. The law also established a three-tier alcohol distribution system whereby, with minor exceptions, alcohol manufacturers may only sell to wholesalers, who may only sell to retailers, who may only sell to customers.|$|E

5|$|Although casinos are {{not under}} the {{jurisdiction}} of the ABC, many of the regulations for casinos and casino vendors are similar to those for ABC class C retailer licensees. Casinos may generally only purchase <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverages</b> from licensed wholesalers (i.e. ABC Class B licensees). A casino may have a brewpub on site, but production is limited to 3,000 barrels of beer per year, and the beer may only be distributed in open containers on casino floor and in hotel areas of the casino. Casinos may obtain a permit to have tastings, and tasting dinners. Non-profit organizations may obtain a permit to have a social event at a casino where they charge for <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverages.</b> Organizations are limited to 12 casino social event permits per year, and a given casino may only host 25 such events per year.|$|E

Alcohol sold or given away on the casino floor and in hotel areas must be in an open container for immediate consumption, whereas alcohol sold in a package goods area must be sealed. <b>Alcoholic</b> <b>beverages</b> brought to a patron as a room service may be open or closed, whereas storage areas must not be accessible to the public.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{many other}} states, New Jersey imposes no {{restrictions}} on the types or quantities of <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverages</b> that a person of legal age may purchase. Grain alcohol, caffeinated <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverages,</b> and absinthe can be legally sold, and state law imposes no limitations on the alcohol content of beer or wine. New Jersey does not require kegs to be registered, and state ABC regulations prohibit municipal keg registration laws. A resident can import any amount of alcohol into the state for personal use, but a $50 permit is required if more than 3 gallons of beer, 1 gallon of wine, or a half-gallon of spirits are being imported within a 24-hour period. Any person who is 21 years or older may produce up to 200 gallons of beer or wine per year.
