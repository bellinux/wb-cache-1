Based on measurements of distances between the glider and beacons, the position of glider and beacons can be estimated synchronously, utilizing the EKF method. Since the glider runs more than one cycle, the estimation of states in EKF-SLAM system can be optimized, combining with measured location of the glider at the sea surface gained by the global positioning system (GPS).

40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} mobile <b>acoustic</b> <b>beacon</b> based sensor node {{localization}} method. Our technique is passive {{in that the}} sensor nodes themselves {{do not need to}} generate an acoustic signal for ranging. This saves cost, power and provides stealthy operation. Furthermore, the beacon can generate much more acoustic energy than a severely resource constrained sensor node, thereby significantly increasing the range. The acoustic ranging method uses a linear frequency modulated signal that can be accurately detected by matched filtering. This provides longer range and higher accuracy than the current state-of-the-art. The localization algorithm was especially designed to work in such acoustically reverberant environment, as urban terrain. The algorithm presented handles non-Gaussian ranging errors caused by echoes. Node locations are computed centrally by solving a global non-linear optimization problem in an iterative and incremental fashion. I...|$|E

40|$|The central pattern {{generator}} controlling vocalizations in songbirds has been investigated for more than 30 years and produced {{a wealth of information}} about the morphological and physiological underpinnings of seasonal change in song production and stereotypy. Now departing the aerial lifestyle for an aquatic one, we find a teleost fish that presents not only an annual reproductive rhythm in vocal motor circuit function, but a daily and activity-dependent one as well. The plainfin midshipman, Porichthys notatus, spends winters in the deep, offshore waters of the Pacific coast from Baja to Alaska from where they migrate into the tidal zone in spring and summer to spawn. At night, the parental and highly vocal, type I male uses an <b>acoustic</b> <b>beacon,</b> the advertisement hum, to attract the females to his rocky excavation to lay her eggs, a nest also defended with several agonistic calls. These calls can be studied in a neurophysiological, or "fictive call" preparation, in which the vocal circuit is activated by microelectrical stimulation and the rhythmic output easily monitored by an extracellular electrode on the ventral root nerve that innervates the vocal muscle of the swim bladder. Since this rhythmic motor volley, "or fictive vocalization" directly predicts the temporal properties of the natural calls, it serves as a valid measure of natural plasticity in a dedicated motor circuit. The following studies present {{for the first time the}} full repertoire of midshipman fictive calls and how seasonal and diel physiological changes in vocal circuit function determine its variable output. Furthermore, the activity-dependence of these rhythmic fictive calls and their patterning by spatially dynamic levels of GABAergic inhibition may reveal a functional partitioning in the circuit, such that rhythm and duration are controlled at one level, and the frequency shift that distinguishes a broadband grunt from a multiharmonic hum occurs at another...|$|E

The objective of MOQESM' 14 was to bring together researchers from both academia and industry, interested in marine robotics and hydrography with application to the coastal environment mapping and underwater infrastructures surveys. The common thread of the conference is the combination of technical control, perception, and localization, typically used in robotics, with the methods of mapping and bathymetry. The papers presented in this book focus on two main topics. Firstly, coastal and infrastructure mapping is addressed, focusing not only on hydrographic systems, but also on positioning systems, bathymetry, and remote sensing. The proposed methods rely on acoustic sensors such as side scan sonars, multibeam echo sounders, phase-measuring bathymetric sonars, as well as optical systems such as underwater laser scanners. Accurate underwater positioning is also addressed in the case of the use of a single <b>acoustic</b> <b>beacon,</b> and the latest advances in increasing the vertical precision of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) are also presented. Most of the above mentioned works are closely related to autonomous marine vehicles. Consequently, the second part of the book describes some works concerning the methods associated with such type of vehicles. The selected papers focus on autonomous surface or underwater vehicles, detailing new approaches for localization, modeling, control, mapping, obstacle detection and avoidance, surfacing, and software development. Some of these works imply acoustics sensing as well as image processing. Set membership methods are also used in some papers. The applications of the work presented in this book concern in particular oceanography, monitoring of oil and gas infrastructures, and military field...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{study was conducted}} to prove the concept of an iterative approach to single transponder navigation for REMUS Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). Although the concept of navigation with one <b>acoustic</b> <b>beacon</b> is not new, the objective was to develop a computer algorithm that could eventually be integrated into the REMUS architecture. This approach uses a least squares fit routine coupled with restrictive geometry and simulated annealing vice Kalman filtering and state vectors. In addition, to provide maximum flexibility, the single transponder was located on a GPS equipped surface ship that was free to move instead of the more common single bottom mounted beacon. Using only a series of spread spectrum ranges logged with time stamp, REMUS standard vehicle data, and reasonable initial conditions, the position at a later time was derived with a figure of merit fit score. Initial investigation was conducted using a noise model developed to simulate the errors suspected with the REMUS sensor suite. Results of this effort were applied to a small at sea test in 3, 300 meters with the REMUS 6000 deep water AUV. A more detailed test was executed in Buzzard's Bay, Massachusetts, in 20 meters of water with a REMUS 100 AUV focusing on navigation in a typical search box. (cont.) While deep water data was too sparse to reveal conclusive results, the Buzzard's Bay work strongly supports the premise that an iterative algorithm can reliably integrate REMUS logged data and an accurate time sequence of ranges to provide position fixes through simple least squares fitting.

40|$|Deep-sea archaeology, an {{emerging}} application of {{autonomous underwater vehicle}} (AUV) technology, requires precise navigation and guidance. As science requirements and engineering capabilities converge, navigating in the sensor-limited ocean remains a fundamental challenge. Despite the logistical cost, the standards of archaeological survey necessitate using fixed acoustic transponders - an instrumented navigation environment. This thesis focuses on the problems particular to operating precisely within such an environment by developing a design method and a navigation algorithm. Responsible documentation, through remote sensing images, distinguishes archaeology from salvage, and fine-resolution imaging demands precision navigation. This thesis presents a design process for making component and algorithm level tradeoffs to achieve system-level performance satisfying the archaeological standard. A specification connects the functional requirements of archaeological survey with the design parameters of precision navigation. Tools based on estimation fundamentals - the Cram 6 r-Rao lower bound and the extended Kalman filter - predict the system-level precision of candidate designs. Non-dimensional performance metrics generalize the analysis results. Analyzing {{a variety of factors}} and levels articulates the key tradeoffs: sensor selection, <b>acoustic</b> <b>beacon</b> configuration, algorithm selection, etc. The abstract analysis is made concrete by designing a survey and navigation system for an expedition to image the USS Monitor. Hypothesis grid (Hgrid) is both a representation of the sensed environment and an algorithm for building the representation. Range observations measuring the line-of-sight distance between two acoustic transducers are subject to multipath errors and spurious returns. The quality of this measurement is dependent on the location of the estimator. Hgrids characterize the measurement quality by generating a priori association probabilities - the belief that subsequent measurements will correspond to the direct-path, a multipath, or an outlier - {{as a function of the}} estimated location. The algorithm has three main components: the mixed-density sensor model using Gaussian and uniform probability distributions, the measurement classification and multipath model identification using expectation-maximization (EM), and the grid-based spatial representation. Application to data from an autonomous benthic explorer (ABE) dive illustrates the algorithm and shows the feasibility of the approach. by Brian Steven Bingham. Thesis (Ph. D.)

For the application, linearized model of robot motion and sensor measurement are derived. Like usual EKF, the method is recursion of two main steps: the time update(or prediction) and measurement update. The measurement update uses exteroceptive sensors such as four <b>acoustic</b> <b>beacons</b> and a pressure sensor. The four beacons provide four range data from these beacons to the robot and pressure sensor does the depth data of the robot. One of the major contributions of the paper is suggestion of two measurement update approaches. The first approach corrects the predicted states using the measurement data individually. The second one corrects the predicted state using the measurement data collectively. The simulation analysis shows that EKF outperforms least squares or odometry based dead-reckoning in the precision and robustness of the estimation. Also, EKF with collective measurement update brings out better accuracy than the EKF with individual measurement update. </p...|$|R
40|$|Localization is an {{important}} required task for enabling vehicle autonomy.

In this paper, we focus on localization by using range measurements available to a vehicle from the communication of its multiple on-board receivers with roadside <b>beacons</b> (<b>acoustic</b> <b>beacons</b> in the case of underwater vehicles). The model proposed for measurements assumes that the true distance between a receiver and a beacon is at most equal to a predetermined function of the range measurement. The proposed procedure for localization is as follows: Based on the range measurements specific to a receiver from the beacons, a convex optimization problem is proposed to estimate the location of the receiver. The estimate is essentially a center of the set of possible locations of the receiver. In the second step, the location estimates of the vehicle are corrected using rigid body motion constraints and the orientation of the rigid body is thus determined.

In normal room conditions, and operating in TDMA mode with 7 <b>acoustic</b> <b>beacons</b> and 32 bits long binary phase modulated signals, the system achieves a location accuracy (reproducibility) of 2 mm for 90 % of measurements in the complete work area, and 1 mm repeatability over small areas and short periods of time.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a system for an {{autonomous}} underwater vehicle to perform in-situ, multiple session, hull inspection using long-term simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Our method assumes very little a-priori knowledge, and {{does not require the}} aid of <b>acoustic</b> <b>beacons</b> for navigation, which is a typical mode of navigation in this type of ap-plication. Our system combines recent techniques in underwater saliency-informed visual SLAM and a method for representing the ship hull surface as a collection of many locally planar surface features. This methodology produces accurate maps that can be constructed in real-time on consumer-grade computing hardware. A single-session SLAM result is ini-tially used as a prior map for later sessions, where the robot automatically merges the mul-tiple surveys into a common hull-relative reference frame. To perform the re-localization step, we use a particle filter that leverages the locally planar representation of the ship hull surface, and a fast visual descriptor matching algorithm. Finally, we apply the recently-developed graph sparsification tool, generic linear constraints (GLC), as a way to manage the computational complexity of the SLAM system as the robot accumulates information across multiple sessions.

This form of guidance provides a robust navigation behavior enabling observation of the occupancy of the sea bed independently of the presence of external position references (either GPS or installed <b>acoustic</b> <b>beacons).</b> The major innovation of the work presented concerns the image segmentation algorithm. It is an unsupervised algorithm, which identifies clusters in the space of gray level probability distributions of image neighborhoods. The metric used to compare gray level distributions is the Kullback-Leibler directed divergence, which is related to the probability of confusing members of distinct clusters. The algorithm is self-tuned, {{in the sense that the}} number of clusters is automatically determined. It works adaptively (frame-to-frame), updating the classes' representations for each new frame, accommodating gradual lighting and texture variations within the same region. The visual controller, a simple integral law with saturation, controls heading rate to minimize the distance between the contour and the image center, while keeping a constant forward speed along the body axis. A separate controller (classic PI) keeps the robot at constant altitude from the sea bottom. The design of these controllers was based on the identified hydrodynamic model of the vehicle.

40|$|The {{absence of}} GPS {{underwater}} makes navigation for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) a difficult challenge. Without an external reference {{in the form}} of <b>acoustic</b> <b>beacons</b> at known positions, the vehicle has to rely on proprioceptive information obtained through a compass, a Doppler Velocity Logger (DVL) or an Inertial Navigation System (INS) [1]. Independent {{of the quality of the}} sensors used, the error in the position estimate based on dead-reckoning information grows without bound. Typical navigation errors are 0. 5 % to 2 % of distance traveled for vehicles traveling within a few hundred meters of the sea floor such that their DVL has a lock on the bottom. Errors as low as 0. 1 % can be obtained with large and expensive INS systems, but for vehicles relying only on a compass and a speed estimate can be as high as 10 %. By surfacing the AUV can obtain a position update through its GPS, but this is impossible (under ice) or undesirable for many applications. The use of static beacons {{in the form of}} a Long Baseline (LBL) array limits the operation area to a few km 2 and requires a substantial deployment effort before operations, especially in deep water. As underwater vehicles become more reliable and affordable the simultaneous use of several AUVs recently became a viable option and multi-vehicle deployments will become standard in the upcoming years. This will not only make entirely new types of missions which rely on cooperation possible, but will also allow each individual member of the group to benefit from navigation information obtained from other members. For optimal cooperative localization a few dedicated Communication and Navigation Aid-AUVs (CNAs), which maintain an accurate estimate of their position through sophisticated DVL and INS sensors, can enable a much larger group of vehicles with less sophisticated navigation suites to maintain an accurate position, as describe...|$|R
40|$|Autonomous {{underwater}} vehicles (AUVs) {{are used}} by several commercial, research, and military agencies for various applications. To facilitate the navigation of these underwater vehicles, tags and transponders are often used to mark underwater targets or tracks of interest. However, most underwater tag identification systems rely on an active source system and electronic hardware to broadcast a <b>beacon</b> <b>acoustic</b> signal. Such systems require extensive calibration at setup and are prone to high maintenance costs. This thesis work develops lower-cost, totally passive acoustic tags ("AcoustiCode") {{that are able to}} encode information which can be read by a conventional high-frequency side-scan SONAR. The AcoustiCode tags utilize Braggs scattering principle to create a unique reflected beampattern (an acoustic signature) that can be detected by a SONAR. The information is encoded in the unique spatial beampattern of each AcoustiCode tag. Numerical simulations and experimental testing in a water tank are conducted to investigate the performance of the proposed approach. M. S...|$|R
5000|$|Following {{the end of}} {{the search}} for bodies, the search {{continued}} for the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder, the so-called [...] "black boxes". French Bureau d'Enquetes et d'Analyses (BEA) chief Paul-Louis Arslanian said that he was not optimistic about finding them since they might have been under as much as 3000 m of water, and the terrain under this portion of the ocean was very rugged. Investigators were hoping to find the aircraft's lower aft section, since that was where the recorders were located. Although France had never recovered a flight recorder from such depths, there was precedent for such an operation: in 1988, an independent contractor recovered the cockpit voice recorder of South African Airways Flight 295 from a depth of 4900 m in a search area of between 80 and 250 nmi2 km2. The Air France flight recorders were fitted with water-activated <b>acoustic</b> underwater locator <b>beacons</b> or [...] "pingers", which should have remained active for at least 30 days, giving searchers that much time to locate the origin of the signals.|$|R
40|$|International audienceKM 3 NeT is {{the next}} {{generation}} neutrino telescope in the Mediterranean Sea employing the technique of Cherenkov photon detection. The Acoustic Positioning System (APS) is a mandatory sub-system of KM 3 NeT that must provide {{the position of the}} telescope’s mechanical structures, in a geo-referenced coordinate system. The APS is important for a safe and accurate deployment of the mechanical structures and, for the sake of science, for precise reconstruction of neutrinoinduced events. The KM 3 NeT APS is composed of three main sub-systems: 1) an array of acoustic receivers rigidly connected to the telescope mechanical structures; 2) a Long Base-Line (LBL) of <b>acoustic</b> transmitters (<b>beacons)</b> and receivers, anchored on the seabed at known positions; 3) a farm of PCs for the acoustic data analysis, on-shore. On shore, the positions of the acoustic receivers are calculated by measuring the ToF (Time Of Flight) of the LBL beacons’ signals on the acoustic receivers, thus determining, via multi-lateration, the position of the acoustic receivers with respect to the geo-referenced LBL. The synchronized and syntonized electronics and the data transmission/acquisition allows for calculating the latencies of the whole data acquisition chain with an accuracy of better than 100 ns. The APS, in combination with compass and tilt, pressure, current and sound velocity data, is expected to measure the positions of the digital optical modules in the deep sea with an accuracy of about 10 cm. Since data are continuously transmitted to shore and distributed to the local data acquisition network at the shore station, acoustic data are available also for Earth and Sea science users. The KM 3 NeT APS is also an excellent tool to study the feasibility of an acoustic neutrino detector and a possible correlation between acoustic and optical signals...|$|R
