5|$|Approximately 40,000 {{medium to}} large icebergs {{annually}} calve from Greenland glaciers, {{and depending on}} wind, and air and water temperature, between 400 and 800 of these go {{as far south as}} 48° north latitude (St. John's). Icebergs are most commonly seen in the waters off Newfoundland in the spring <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>summer.</b>|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began in}} August 2005, with work on both {{platforms}} and the intermediate tower occurring {{through the summer}} of that year. The bulk of the construction occurred in 2006. Installation of the engines and other equipment occurred during the spring <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>summer</b> of 2006, which was followed by installation of the cables during the late summer and early fall.|$|E
5|$|Newfoundland is {{also known}} for its fog which occurs most often in the spring <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>summer</b> because of the {{contrast}} between sea and air temperatures. Argentia has 206 days of fog per year. Fog in Newfoundland is frequently accompanied by strong onshore winds; while usually winds disperse fog, here the fog is too widespread for this to occur.|$|E
60|$|The spring <b>and</b> the <b>early</b> <b>summer</b> wore away. The dreaded {{month of}} July came, with its airless nights, its {{cloudless}} mornings, and its sultry days.|$|R
2500|$|Both camps {{continued}} to issue proposals and counter-proposals through the spring <b>and</b> into <b>early</b> <b>summer.</b> Each side shifted ground, declaring proposals [...] "non-negotiable" [...] {{at one point}} and then abandoning them later.|$|R
5000|$|Wisteria (fuji), hana tachibana (wild orange blossoms) <b>and</b> iris (ayame): <b>early</b> <b>summer</b> (May), lotus (hasu or hachisu): mid {{and late}} summer.|$|R
5|$|The {{species is}} saprobic—deriving {{nutrients}} by decomposing and digesting organic matter—and grows in clusters or in groups on decaying leaf litter or well-decayed wood. It typically fruits {{in a narrow}} window from June to July; this spring <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>summer</b> fruiting distinguishes it from the more common Coprinus comatus and Coprinopsis atramentaria, which produce fruit bodies in late autumn. It {{is found in the}} United States, in areas east of the Great Plains.|$|E
5|$|The time of {{breeding}} {{depends on the}} elevation and latitude of the salamander's habitat. Generally, the lower-elevation salamanders breed in the fall, winter, and early spring. Higher-elevation salamanders breed in spring <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>summer.</b> In the higher climates especially, salamanders will enter ponds and lakes that still have ice floating.|$|E
5|$|Wildflowers, which bloom {{mainly in}} the spring <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>summer,</b> include pincushions, golden bee plant, dwarf purple monkey flower, and {{sagebrush}} mariposa lily at the Painted Hills Unit. Munro's globemallow, lupines, yellow fritillary, hedgehog cactus, and Applegate's Indian paintbrush are commonly seen at the Clarno and Sheep Rock units.|$|E
50|$|The {{flowers are}} small and pale and {{arranged}} in panicles, appearing between December <b>and</b> April (<b>early</b> <b>summer</b> to mid autumn) in the species native range. These are followed by flattened dark-red fruits which are up to 4 mm in diameter.|$|R
50|$|Japonica saepestriata is a Theclinae {{butterfly}} {{found in}} woods of eastern Asia, especially Japan. It is single brooded <b>and</b> appears in <b>early</b> <b>summer.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{wingspan}} is 36-40 mm. Adults are on wing in late March in south-eastern North Carolina <b>and</b> in <b>early</b> <b>summer</b> from New Jersey northward. There is {{one generation}} from New Jersey north. From eastern Maryland to north-eastern North Carolina southward {{there are two}} generations.|$|R
5|$|Between {{the spring}} <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>summer</b> of 1921, the rebels {{experienced}} {{a series of}} defeats. In July 1921, Hananu's stronghold in Jabal Zawiya was captured by French forces. By this time, French forces proceeded to burn down villages where support for the rebels was high. A number of these villages' inhabitants were arrested or executed, prompting some rebels to ultimately surrender. On 11 or 12 July, Hananu fled to British-held Transjordan, seeking refuge with nationalists from Syria, to avoid arrest by the French authorities. British intelligence officers arrested Hananu while he was visiting Jerusalem and extradited him to Syria in August.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the male}} and female of the species reach sexual {{maturity}} after 1 year of life. The breeding season occurs in the spring <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>summer.</b> The males arrive before {{the beginning of the season}} to establish their territories. The males use a series of courtship displays to attract the females to their sites. They run around the area either to showcase their territory to the females or to pursue the females. The males also engage in flight to showcase their wings. They sing and call as they perform all of these displays. The species can remain monogamous for many years, but incidents of polygyny and bigamy have been reported to occur during the bird's lifetime.|$|E
5|$|In the Soviet Union, {{both the}} Germans and the Soviets spent the spring <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>summer</b> of 1943 {{preparing}} for large offensives in central Russia. On 4 July 1943, Germany attacked Soviet forces around the Kursk Bulge. Within a week, German forces had exhausted {{themselves against the}} Soviets' deeply echeloned and well-constructed defences and, {{for the first time}} in the war, Hitler cancelled the operation before it had achieved tactical or operational success. This decision was partially affected by the Western Allies' invasion of Sicily launched on 9 July which, combined with previous Italian failures, resulted in the ousting and arrest of Mussolini later that month. Also, in July 1943 the British firebombed Hamburg killing over 40,000 people.|$|E
5000|$|Seil {{has been}} linked to the Scottish {{mainland}} since 1792 when the Clachan Bridge was built by engineer Robert Mylne. Also known as the [...] "Bridge Over the Atlantic", the bridge is still used today <b>and</b> in <b>early</b> <b>summer</b> is covered in fairy foxgloves (Erinus alpinus).|$|R
50|$|The {{plant is}} a summer annual <b>and</b> germinates from <b>early</b> <b>summer</b> to <b>early</b> fall, {{requiring}} warm soil. Little more {{is known about}} the biological activity of this species.|$|R
500|$|Dams, {{power plants}} and diversions of the Kootenay River, {{of which there are}} many, have been built {{for a variety of reasons}} {{throughout}} the 19th and 20th centuries. The seven dams on the Kootenay serve many purposes, ranging from generation of local electricity to regulation of Columbia River flow between Canada and the United States. None provide for navigation or fish passage. In former times, the Kootenay would rise each spring <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>summers</b> with [...] "enormous freshets that every summer flood the Kootenay River valley", but because of water regulation nowadays, such extreme variation in flow are no longer common on the lower river below Libby Dam.|$|R
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the copper shark is viviparous, in which the yolk sac of the {{developing}} embryo, once depleted, is converted into a placental connection through which the mother delivers nourishment. Adult females have one functional ovary, on the right, and two functional uteruses. The male bites the female {{as a prelude to}} mating. In the Southern Hemisphere, mating takes place from October to December (spring <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>summer),</b> when both sexes have migrated into offshore waters at higher latitudes. Birthing seems to occur from June to January, peaking in October and November.|$|E
5|$|When {{the pass}} is open in warmer weather, it {{is a popular}} destination. A scenic {{overlook}} near the pass allows visitors {{to take in the}} alpine tundra environment above treeline, and offers excellent views to the east of Mount Elbert, Colorado's highest peak and the second-highest mountain in the contiguous United States. Rock climbers are drawn to nearby bouldering opportunities, and informal paths lead to nearby mountain summits of even higher elevation. Backcountry skiers make use of the slopes during the late spring <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>summer.</b> Since 2011 the pass has been on the route of the USA Pro Cycling Challenge.|$|E
5|$|At Governor William Dennison's request, Garfield {{deferred}} {{his military}} ambitions {{to remain in}} the legislature, where he helped appropriate the funds to raise and equip Ohio's volunteer regiments. Afterward, the legislature adjourned and Garfield spent the spring <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>summer</b> on a speaking tour of northeastern Ohio, encouraging enlistment in the new regiments. Following a trip to Illinois to purchase muskets, Garfield returned to Ohio and, in August 1861, received a commission as a colonel in the 42nd Ohio Infantry regiment. The 42nd Ohio existed only on paper, so Garfield's first task was to fill its ranks. He did so quickly, recruiting many of his neighbors and former students. The regiment traveled to Camp Chase, outside Columbus, Ohio, to complete training. In December, Garfield was ordered to bring the 42nd to Kentucky, where they joined the Army of the Ohio under Brigadier General Don Carlos Buell.|$|E
50|$|As preparatory work, Guthrie {{painted a}} study of each subject separately, {{considerably}} delaying the process. He held sittings in the springs <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>summers</b> of 1919 to 1921. After a delay caused by Guthrie's illness, the work was first exhibited at the Scottish National Gallery in Edinburgh in early 1930. Guthrie died in September 1930 before he could complete the final finishing touches before it went on display in London in October 1930. His 17 oil studies and an oil sketch of the composition were donated to Scottish National Portrait Gallery. Guthrie's study of Louis Botha was used by Sargent in making his painting of general officers.|$|R

5|$|In 1983, {{dendrochronology}} of wood {{samples from}} Chetro Ketl provided information on species selected, season of cutting, wood modification and use, {{as well as}} an estimate of the number of trees required to build the great house. Trees were harvested for construction at Chetro Ketl annually, which contrasts with the sporadic patterns found at other sites in the canyon. Whereas a late summer and early fall harvesting time has been documented at other Chacoan sites, the tree felling for Chetro Ketl was undertaken primarily during the spring <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>summer.</b> This may indicate that enough in-house labor was available during the farming season, or that specialized groups of Chacoans were dedicated to tree felling irrespective of the agriculture cycle, when most others were busy with field preparation and planting. One particularly well sampled room suggests that wood was cut during the relatively short span of a couple of weeks per season.|$|E
5|$|In Nebraska, a {{small number}} of pallid {{sturgeon}} have been captured along the lower reaches of the Platte River. Unlike most rivers in the Mississippi-Missouri River System, the Platte River has only a few dams and they are well upstream from its confluence with the Missouri River. The lower Platte River is shallow with numerous sand bars and small islands. Though pallid sturgeon prefer more turbulent and deeper rivers than the Platte, between 1979 and 2003, over a dozen pallid sturgeon, including some from hatcheries, have been captured from the Platte River. A number of these pallid sturgeon have been fitted with radio transmitters which track their return to the Platte River when water levels and turbidity conditions are favorable. Coinciding with the majority of the pallid sturgeon that have been captured, the period that is generally most favorable is during the spring <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>summer.</b> By midsummer, a reduction in water levels and turbidity on the Platte River encourages pallid sturgeon to return to the Missouri River.|$|E
5|$|In spring <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>summer,</b> migrant birds {{including}} the little gull, black tern, Temminck's stint and garganey may pass through {{on their way}} to breed elsewhere. In the autumn, birds arrive from the north; some, such as whimbrels, curlew sandpipers and little stints, just pausing for a few days to refuel before continuing south, others staying for the winter. Offshore, great and Arctic skuas, northern gannets and black-legged kittiwakes may pass close by in favourable winds. Large numbers of ducks winter along the coast, including many Eurasian wigeons, Eurasian teals, mallards and gadwalls, goldeneyes and northern pintails. Red-throated divers are usually on the sea, and brent geese feed on sea lettuce and other green algae. Barn owls and sometimes hen harriers quarter the marshes in winter, and snow bunting flocks {{can be found on the}} beaches. Thousands of geese, mainly pink-footed, roost at Holkham.|$|E
5000|$|Anthericum liliago (St Bernard's lily) is {{a species}} of the genus Anthericum in the family Asparagaceae. It is native to Europe and Turkey, growing in dry pastures, stony places and open woods <b>and</b> {{flowering}} in <b>early</b> <b>summer.</b>|$|R
50|$|The site {{is also a}} museum, which hosts a {{restaurant}} and a cafe. The Abbey's refectory now serves as a venue for concerts <b>and</b> lectures. In <b>early</b> <b>summer</b> {{it is also a}} venue for a local music festival.|$|R
50|$|Understandably the Three Peaks Walk {{is seen by}} many as a {{challenge}} and it has become very popular for charity sponsored walks <b>and</b> Saturdays in <b>early</b> <b>summer</b> can see several hundred walkers make their way round the route.|$|R
5|$|Much of the Merced River basin is at high elevation, {{where an}} alpine climate prevails. The Sierra {{receives}} heavy snowfall in the winter, which melts {{in the spring}} <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>summer</b> causing annual flooding. By late autumn the river level has dropped considerably, and some smaller tributaries dry up altogether. Up to 85% of the flow above Happy Isles comes from melting snow. In the dry season, groundwater provides the only base flow to the river. In addition, the river is fed by dozens of high Sierra lakes, the largest of which include Merced Lake, Tenaya Lake, Ostrander Lake, the Chain Lakes, and May Lake. The foothills experience a drier Mediterranean climate, while the San Joaquin Valley floor is dry enough to be considered semi-desert.|$|E
5|$|Plucking: Tea {{leaves and}} flushes, which {{includes}} a terminal bud and two young leaves, are picked from Camellia sinensis bushes typically twice a year during early spring <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>summer</b> or late spring. Autumn or winter pickings of tea flushes are much less common, though they occur when climate permits. Picking is done by hand when a higher quality tea is needed, or where labour costs are not prohibitive. Depending on the skill of the picker, hand-picking is performed by pulling the flush with a snap of the forearm, arm, or even the shoulders, with the picker grasping the tea shoot using the thumb and forefinger, with the middle finger sometimes used in combination. Tea flushes and leaves can also be picked by machine, though {{there will be more}} broken leaves and partial flushes reducing the quality of the tea. However, it has also been shown that machine plucking in correctly timed harvesting periods can produce good leaves for the production of high quality teas.|$|E
5|$|Sarcosphaera is a fungal genus {{within the}} Pezizaceae family. It is a {{monotypic}} genus, containing the single species Sarcosphaera coronaria, {{commonly known as}} the pink crown, the violet crown-cup, or the violet star cup. It is a whitish or grayish cup fungus, distinguished by {{the manner in which the}} cup splits into lobes from the top downward. It is commonly found in the mountains in coniferous woods under humus on the forest floor, and often appears after the snow melts in late spring <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>summer.</b> The fungus is widespread, and has been collected in Europe, Israel and the Asian part of Turkey, North Africa, and North America. In Europe, it is considered a threatened species in 14 countries. Although several taxa have been described as Sarcosphaera species since the introduction of the genus in 1869, most lack modern descriptions, have been transferred to the related genus Peziza, or are considered synonymous with S.coronaria.|$|E
2500|$|Located on the southeasternmost {{tip of the}} Korean Peninsula, Busan has {{a cooler}} version of a humid {{subtropical}} climate (Köppen climate classification Cwa). Extremely high or low temperatures are rare. The highest temperature ever recorded is [...] on 14 August 2016 while the lowest temperature ever recorded is [...] on 13 January 1915. May to July, late Springs <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>Summers,</b> are usually cooler than inland regions because of the ocean effect. Late <b>Summer,</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> Autumn, August <b>and</b> September, are generally hot and humid and the city may experience typhoons {{at that time and}} be generally rainy. On September 15, 1959, Super Typhoon Sarah passed by the coast of the city and caused catastrophic damage. An unusually severe storm on September 12, 2003, Typhoon Maemi, also caused damage to ships and buildings and resulted in over 48 fatalities.|$|R
50|$|Acanthus spinosus, the spiny bear's breech, is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the family Acanthaceae, native to southern Europe, from Italy to western Turkey.
