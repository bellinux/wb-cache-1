40|$|Abstract—A {{mathematical}} model of two-mass vibratory con-veying system with electromagnetic vibratory actuator (EVA) and possible ways of their optimal control by using power converter {{is presented in}} this paper. Vibratory conveyors are commonly used in industry to carry {{a wide variety of}} particulate and granular materials. Application of electromagnetic vibratory drive com-bined with power converters provides flexibility during work. The use of a silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR) implies a phase angle control, which is very easy, but with many disadvantages (fixed frequency which is imposed by <b>ac</b> <b>mains</b> <b>supply,</b> poor power factor, mechanical retuning, etc.). Switching converters overcomes these disadvantages. Only then, driving for EVA does not depend on mains frequency. As well as amplitude and duration of excitation force tuning, it is also possible to tune its frequency. Consequently, complicated mechanical tuning is eliminated and seeking resonant frequency is provided. Previously mentioned facts motivated phase angle control and switch mode control behavior research for electromagnetic vibratory drives. Simulation and experimental results and their comparisons are exposed in this paper. The simulation model and results are given in the program package PSPICE.

40|$|This thesis reports an {{investigation}} into the design of converters for induction heating systems based upon resonant switch mode power converter techniques. The proposed three phase unity power factor induction heating system consists of two stages of power conversions. The important requirements for each stage of the power conversion of a typical induction heating system working from a three-phase supply are identified. A wide range of power converters which fulfil these requirements are compared and evaluated. From the evaluation, the most applicable converter topologies are selected. Each selected converter class is investigated in great detail to outline their advantages and disadvantages. The first stage consists of a push-pull buck converter connected to a unity power factor rectifier stage. This stage converts the three phase <b>AC</b> <b>mains</b> <b>supply</b> to a required DC value. The second stage, which converters the DC into AC is a single ended resonant inverter system. Analysis of the converters has been made and the design procedure has been formulated. The design procedure allows a strenuous design of each resonant converter for particular converter applications. The final converter design has been simulated using the circuit simulation software packages Design Architect and Accusim to verify the results of analysis. The most important design and construction achievements can be summarised as follows: I A novel push-pull buck quasi-resonant converter with a three-phase rectifier stage has been built and tested. At its maximum operating frequency of 40 kHz, the prototype converter delivers an output power of 500 W. The converter draws nearly sinusoidal currents from the three-phase <b>mains</b> <b>supply</b> and has an input power factor approaching unity. A secondary stage resonant converter provides AC for the induction heater coil. This AC current flowing in the induction coil creates an alternating electromagnetic field for the workpiece. An induction heating coil has been designed and built by using electrical equivalent coil design method. A novel control strategy was developed to provide output power control. Both converter and inverter stage of the system are operated in the zero-current switching condition. The use of this technique allows higher switching frequencies and provides low switching losses. The full design details are presented along with simulation and practical results. The simulation and practical performance results presented show good correlation with theoretical predictions...|$|R

40|$|Energy {{methods are}} widely used and well {{understood}} for determining the torque or force in machines which do not contain permanent magnets. Energy methods are employed to calculate torques or forces of magnetic origin after determination of the energy stored in the electromechanical coupling field. In this thesis, the energy stored in a permanent magnet system is defined, and the energy-coenergy relationship is determined. It is shown how residual magnetism {{can be incorporated into}} classical electromechanical coupling theory. It is therefore shown how equations for torques or forces can be derived for permanent magnet systems using energy methods. An analytical method of calculating permanent magnet reluctance torque is developed. The method uses an elementary expression for the magnetic field to obtain the stored energy. This enables an analytical expression for the reluctance torque waveform to be obtained. The method is demonstrated to provide a powerful and fast design tool. The method can be generally applied to reluctance torque problems where the airgap is reasonably smooth. The single phase synchronous permanent magnet motor is used in domestic appliances. It is a motor of very simple construction and high reliability, which is directly connected to an <b>AC</b> <b>mains</b> <b>supply,</b> and runs at synchronous speed. It is becoming increasingly used in preference to the shaded pole induction motor. However, its application is limited by the following characteristics. There is no control over the final direction of rotation, unless a mechanical blocking device is used. There are rotor positions at which only a very small starting torque is available. The characteristic twice electrical frequency torque pulsation yields a speed modulation of the same frequency, which can cause acoustic noise problems. A method of improving torque quality by improving the motor design is proposed to alleviate these limiting characteristics. This is achieved by designing a permanent magnet reluctance torque which cancels out the effect of the backward rotating component of the stator field. In this novel design, the permanent magnet reluctance torque effectively acts as a second balancing phase. An unconventional technique for starting a single phase synchronous permanent magnet motor is demonstrated. This technique uses an inductive reluctance torque, provided by placing a suitably shaped iron lamination on the rotor, to rotate the rotor to a position from which starting can occur...|$|R

A phase controlled rectifier feeds a battery supported dc bus and an inverter supplies the load. These systems require two conversion stages thus reducing operating efficiency. Moreover, input power factor is poor and large harmonic currents are injected into the <b>ac</b> <b>mains.</b> The proposed topology overcomes these drawbacks by placing the inverter-battery subsystem in shunt between the <b>ac</b> <b>mains</b> and the load. The battery is charged through the inverter dc bus.
