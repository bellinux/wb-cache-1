2500|$|Modern fly reels {{typically}} have more sophisticated disc-type drag systems made of composite materials that feature increased <b>adjustment</b> <b>range,</b> consistency, {{and resistance to}} high temperatures from drag friction. [...] Most of these fly reels also feature large-arbor spools designed to reduce line memory, maintain consistent drag and assist the quick retrieval of slack line in the event a hooked fish makes a sudden run towards the angler. [...] Most modern fly reels are ambidextrous, allowing the angler to place the crank handle of the reel on either the right or the left side as desired.|$|E
2500|$|A fly reel is a single-action reel, {{normally}} {{operated by}} stripping line off the reel with one hand, while casting the rod {{with the other}} hand. [...] The main purpose of a fly reel is to store line, provide smooth uninterrupted tension (drag) when a fish makes a long run, and counterbalance the weight of your fly rod when casting. [...] When used in fly fishing, the fly reel or fly casting reel has traditionally been rather simple in terms of mechanical construction, and little has changed from the design patented by Charles F. Orvis of Vermont in 1874. Orvis first introduced {{the idea of using}} light metals with multiple perforated holes to construct the housing, resulting in a lighter reel that also allowed the spooled fly line to dry more quickly than a conventional, solid-sided design. [...] Early fly reels placed the crank handle {{on the right side of}} the reel. [...] Most had no drag mechanism, but were fitted with a click/pawl mechanism intended to keep the reel from overrunning when line was pulled from the spool. [...] To slow a fish, the angler simply applied hand pressure to the rim of the revolving spool (known as [...] "palming the rim"). [...] Later, these click/pawl mechanisms were modified to provide a limited adjustable drag of sorts. [...] Although adequate for smaller fish, these did not possess a wide <b>adjustment</b> <b>range</b> or the power to slow larger fish.|$|E

50|$|In most regular {{sport and}} hunting rifles (except for in long range shooting), sights are usually mounted in neutral mounts. This is done because the optical {{quality of the}} scope is best {{in the middle of}} its <b>adjustment</b> <b>range,</b> and only being able to use half of the <b>adjustment</b> <b>range</b> to {{compensate}} for bullet drop is seldom a problem at short and medium range shooting.|$|E
50|$|The {{horizontal}} and vertical <b>adjustment</b> <b>range</b> of a firearm sight is often advertised by the manufacturer using mils. For instance a rifle scope may be advertised as having a vertical <b>adjustment</b> <b>range</b> of 20 mils, which means that by turning the turret the bullet impact can be moved a total of 20 meters at 1000 meters (or 2 m at 100 m, 4 m at 200 m, 6 m at 300 m etc.). The {{horizontal and}} vertical adjustment ranges can be different for a particular sight, for instance a scope may have 20 mils vertical and 10 mils horizontal adjustment. Elevation differ between models, but about 10-11 mils are common in hunting scopes, while scopes made for long range shooting usually can have an <b>adjustment</b> <b>range</b> of 30-50 mils.|$|E

All of the models can be adjusted to account for population anthropometric distributions and gender mix.
