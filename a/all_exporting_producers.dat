This {{study examines}} {{the factors that}} guide the behaviour and relationships between <b>export</b> <b>producer</b> and intermediary dyads. We examine {{both sides of a}} dyadic transaction and develop an export producer–intermediary behaviour typology by using a grounded theory method through qualitative interviews. We propose three forms of export producer–intermediary dyads based on the degree of information sharing, intensity of price negotiation, level of transaction costs, and partner satisfaction and propensity to export directly. These three forms are as follows: (1) competitive, (2) cooperative and (3) mismatched relationships...|$|R
25|$|Estonia exports {{machinery}} and equipment (33% of <b>all</b> <b>exports</b> annually), wood and paper (15% of <b>all</b> <b>exports</b> annually), textiles (14% of <b>all</b> <b>exports</b> annually), food products (8% of <b>all</b> <b>exports</b> annually), furniture (7% of <b>all</b> <b>exports</b> annually), and metals and chemical products. Estonia also exports 1.562 million megawatt hours of electricity annually. Estonia imports {{machinery and}} equipment (33.5% of all imports annually), chemical products (11.6% of all imports annually), textiles (10.3'% of all imports annually), food products (9.4% of all imports annually), and transportation equipment (8.9% of all imports annually). Estonia imports 200 thousand megawatt hours of electricity annually.|$|R
30|$|The top 5 firms {{represented}} 10 % of <b>all</b> <b>exports,</b> the top 50 {{accounted for}} almost one-third of <b>all</b> <b>exports,</b> the top 200 performed {{almost half of}} <b>all</b> <b>exports,</b> and the top 1000 were responsible for two-thirds of <b>all</b> <b>exports.</b> These figures suggest that the concentration of exports by firm is very high in Spain. If we removed the top 1000 firms, which only represented 0.7 % of <b>all</b> <b>exporting</b> firms in 2015, 67 % of <b>all</b> <b>exports</b> would vanish. Table  1 also shows that over the 1997 – 2015 period, {{there has been a}} moderate reduction in the concentration of exports by the top 5 firms. In contrast, the concentration of exports is similar for the top firm and the top 50 firms, and increases slightly for the top 200 and top 1000 firms.|$|R

Although the zoom-in process reduces the concentration of exports, {{it is remarkable that}} the top firm-destination-product triad still represents almost 1 % of <b>all</b> Spanish <b>exports.</b> 10 [...]...|$|R

50|$|The {{two most}} {{important}} trading partners were traditionally Germany (1910: 48% of <b>all</b> <b>exports,</b> 39% of <b>all</b> imports), and Great Britain (1910: almost 10% of <b>all</b> <b>exports,</b> 8% of <b>all</b> imports), the third most important partner was the United States, it followed by Russia, France, Switzerland, Romania, the Balkan states and South America.

40|$|Summary. The US's <b>exports</b> of <b>producer</b> {{services}} increased threefold in the 1980 s.

Four metropolitan areas, and particularly their central cities, stand out as having both high concentrations and specialisations in producer service industries and as being {{the location of the}} head offices of the largest producer service firms.

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{robustness}} {{of the relationship}} between export and production growth for three major wheat exporters: Australia, Canada and the United States from 1966 to 2000. Combining production, international trade and development theories, a four variable (production, <b>exports,</b> <b>producer</b> price and imports) vector autoregressive moving average (VARMA) model is developed for each country. The causality results show that the hypothesis of export-led development is supported by these three major players in the international wheat trade, though a bi-directional causality is found for Canada and the USA. Variance decomposition and impulse response functions are employed to further investigate the effects of macroeconomic shocks. ...|$|R
