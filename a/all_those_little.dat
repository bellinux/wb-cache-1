500|$|By early April, most NBA draft analysts {{thought he}} would be {{selected}} in the second round, but Larry Butler, his former AAU coach with the Illinois Warriors, thought he might go late in the first round. He's shown his toughness, his will to win. He brings <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>little</b> intangibles to the table that the elite players do. He's always making the right pass, always making the big shots, always making the big plays, always making his free throws.... The kid is a winner. He's always been a winner.|$|E
500|$|The abuse {{he faced}} {{at the hands}} of opponents early in his NHL career {{prompted}} Iginla's coaches to work at developing his physical play. While he was not enthusiastic about fighting, Iginla accepted then head coach Brian Sutter's arguments that he needed to adopt a more aggressive style to improve as a player. Iginla is most effective when he has room to manoeuvre, and to create that space, he had to intimidate his opponents. The lessons Iginla learned have carried throughout his career. [...] "You've got a power forward who does it all," [...] said Craig Conroy. [...] "I mean, he'll fight, and hit, and score goals. Maybe it's not the end-to-end rushes, but he does <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>little</b> things that win games and get things done." [...] His opponents also respect his play. Rob Blake said that while Iginla is not known for fancy play, [...] "he'll run you over. Or he'll fight somebody. And then he'll score a goal. He does pretty much everything you'd want a guy to do." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Darling--what {{a spirit}} you have got! <b>All</b> through <b>all</b> <b>those</b> dear <b>little</b> dishes--all through Lohengrin! As I haven't {{thought it over}} at all, you must settle it. You know I am not difficult." ...|$|R

6000|$|When Billy Mink saw <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>little</b> Trouts {{playing in}} the Dear Little Pool he laughed. [...] "You count three, Reddy Fox," [...] said he, [...] "and I'll {{show you how to}} catch a fish." ...|$|E
6000|$|Such {{a look of}} dismay as {{swept over}} the faces of <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>little</b> people, with the {{exception}} of Jimmy Skunk and Prickly Porky! [...] "If-- if--if you please, I don't think I'll come to-morrow morning," [...] said Danny Meadow Mouse.|$|E

60|$|All these {{undertook}} the Quest of Sir Launcelot {{and in that}} quest several adventures {{happened to}} them. Yet of <b>all</b> <b>those</b> adventures <b>little</b> of anything shall here be said saving only that which shall concern those adventures that befell Sir Ewaine and Sir Percival and Sir Gawaine; of which more anon.|$|R

6000|$|... "Dear me!" [...] pursued Mrs. Peckover, looking {{towards the}} three drawing-boards, {{which had been}} placed {{together}} round the pedestal of the cast; [...] "are <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>little</b> Mary's doings? She's cleverer at it, I suppose, by this time, than ever. Ah, Lord! what an old woman I feel, when I think of the many years ago--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is {{there such}} a thing as an {{invisible}} animal? ... In the sea, yes. Thousands--millions. All the larvae, all the little nauplii and tornarias, all the microscopic things, the jelly-fish. In the sea there are more things invisible than visible! I never thought of that before. And in the ponds too! <b>All</b> <b>those</b> <b>little</b> pond-life things--specks of colourless translucent jelly! But in air? No! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Only a faint, I think," [...] {{said the}} medical student. [...] "Just {{give me a}} hand with him. You take his feet. Now on to the sofa. Can you kick <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>little</b> wooden devils off? What a litter it is! Now he will be all right if we undo his collar and give him some water. What has he been up to at all?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{are so many}} {{beautiful}} things," [...] she murmured. [...] "Do you see how {{thick and}} green the grass is in the meadows there? How the quaker grasses glimmer?--you call them so, do you not?--and how those yellow cowslips shine like gold? What a world of colour it all seems. London is so grey and cold, and here--look at the sea, and the sky, with <b>all</b> <b>those</b> dear <b>little</b> fleecy white clouds, and the pink and white of <b>all</b> <b>those</b> wild roses wound {{in and out of}} the hedges. Oh, Arnold, it is all beautiful!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is Utopia," [...] I said, {{and then}} sought {{once more to}} tranquillise his mind. [...] "No doubt among the vulgar, coarse-minded people outside the Rule there may be {{something}} of the sort. Every earthly moral blockhead, a little educated, perhaps, {{is to be found in}} Utopia. You will, no doubt, find the 'cut' and the 'boycott,' and <b>all</b> <b>those</b> nice <b>little</b> devices by which dull people get a keen edge on life, in their place here, and their place here is somewhere----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes--the truth. Bess, don't misunderstand. I haven't {{changed that}} way. I love you still. I'll love you more afterward. Life {{will be just}} as sweet--sweeter to us. We'll be--be married as soon as ever we can. We'll be happy--but there's a devil in me. A perverse, jealous devil! Then I've queer fancies. I forgot for a long time. Now <b>all</b> <b>those</b> fiendish <b>little</b> whispers of doubt and faith and fear and hope come torturing me again. I've got to kill them with the truth." ...|$|R
60|$|The young husband {{felt himself}} to be offended, but he hardly knew why. He felt {{himself to be}} offended, and with {{difficulty}} induced himself to go through <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>little</b> ceremonies the absence of {{which would have been}} remarked by everybody. He did his work, however, seeing to all her shawls and wrappings, speaking with good-nature to Hannah, and paying special attention to the dressing-case.|$|E
6000|$|Suddenly Longbill plunged {{his bill}} into the ground. He plunged {{it in for}} the whole length. Then he pulled it out and Peter {{caught a glimpse of}} the tail end of a worm disappearing down Longbill's throat. Where that long bill had gone into the ground was a neat little round hole. For the first time Peter noticed that there were many such little round holes all about. [...] "Did you make <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>little</b> round holes?" [...] exclaimed Peter.|$|E
60|$|Peter's {{big eyes}} grew round with {{surprise}} as he stared. Where had {{they all come}} from so suddenly? A minute before he hadn't seen a single one, and now he could hardly move without stepping on one. It seemed, it really seemed, as if each raindrop turned into a tiny Toad the instant it struck the ground. Of course Peter knew that that couldn't be, {{but it was very}} puzzling. And <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>little</b> Toads were bravely hopping along as if they were bound for some particular place.|$|E
60|$|Down in {{his little}} tunnels {{underneath}} the snow Danny Meadow Mouse felt perfectly safe from Reddy Fox, who would stop and dig frantically at the little round doorway where he had last seen Danny. But old Granny Fox knew <b>all</b> about <b>those</b> <b>little</b> tunnels, and she didn't waste any time digging at the doorways. Instead she cocked her sharp little ears and listened with all her might. Now Granny Fox has very keen ears, oh, very keen ears, and she heard just what she hoped she would hear. She heard Danny Meadow Mouse running along one of his little tunnels under the snow.|$|R
40|$|Coaching Power Tool: Wants vs. Musts Identifying and Clarifying Wants and Musts Our actions do {{not always}} reflect what we say we want. This power tool is {{designed}} to clarify what you want vs. what you must have and/or do. And I mean really, really must have and/or experience. The deep down, gut-wrenching things that you just can’t live without. The trick here is to block out <b>all</b> <b>those</b> annoying <b>little</b> distractions and voices that get in the way.

6000|$|... "Here anyhow," [...] I said, {{answering}} the faint amusement of his face; [...] "I've got no modesty. Everything conspires to set me up. Why should I run about like <b>all</b> <b>those</b> grubby <b>little</b> beasts down there, seeking nothing but mean little vanities and indulgencies--and then {{take credit for}} modesty? I KNOW I am capable. I KNOW I have imagination. Modesty! I know if I don't attempt the very biggest things in life I am a damned shirk. The very biggest! Somebody has to attempt them.

60|$|This {{is the end}} of {{my private}} journal, and I must make the {{remainder}} of my statement from memory. There is little chance of my being mistaken about facts which have seared themselves into my recollection. That very night the storm which had been brewing so long burst over us, and I came to learn whither <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>little</b> incidents were tending which I had recorded so aimlessly. Blind fool that I was not to have seen it sooner! I shall tell what occurred as precisely as I can.|$|E
60|$|It was {{difficult}} to contemplate too seriously a person with whom one had lived for years, with whom one had experienced in common the range of human passion, intimacy, and estrangement, who knew <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>little</b> daily things {{that men and women}} living together know of each other, and with whom in the end, without hatred, but because of one's nature, one had ceased to live. There was nothing for either of them to find out, and with a little smile, like the smile of knowledge itself, Jaspar Bellew and Helen his wife looked at each other.|$|E

"Of course I must {{earn more}} than that," [...] said Gwendolen, {{with a sense of}} wincing rather than of being refuted, [...] "but I think I could soon learn to do tolerably well <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>little</b> things you have mentioned. I am not so very stupid. And even in Paris, I am sure, I saw two actresses playing {{important}} ladies' parts who were not at all ladies and quite ugly. I suppose I have no particular talent, but I must think it is an advantage, even on the stage, to be a lady and not a perfect fright." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should be}} pleased to." [...] She was prim but trusting about it. [...] "Oh, listen, Mr. Wrenn; {{did you ever}} tramp along the Palisades as far as Englewood?

60|$|Beyond this I need write no more; but I cannot {{close my}} {{journal of the}} Abyssinian {{expedition}} without expressing my gratitude for the very great and uniform kindness with which I have been treated by the Commander-in-chief, and by the greater portion of his staff. I would particularly mention Colonel Dillon, the Military Secretary; {{one of the most}} able and certainly the most popular officer upon the staff, and whose kindness and attention to us has been unbounded. He has been always ready to afford us any information in his power, and to assist us in <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>little</b> difficulties with which a civilian travelling with an army is unavoidably beset.|$|E

He would be different enough, being merely a man; but being a man born and reared in as different a world from yours as if it were another planet--I want you to think over all the girls you know--all the people you know--and see how many of them have married out of their own set, their own circle--we might almost say, their own family.

60|$|Among {{other things}} he {{proceeded}} to qualify himself as a dealer in diamonds. It happened that he was acquainted {{with one of the}} partners of the firm of Fugger & Stoltz, who did the largest import trade in precious stones. Through his kindness he received practical instructions in the variety and value of diamonds, and learned to detect <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>little</b> flaws and peculiarities which are only visible to the eye of an expert, and yet are of the highest importance in determinating the price of a stone. With such opportunities Ezra made rapid progress, and within a few weeks there were not many dealers in the trade who had a better grasp of the subject.|$|E
60|$|Striped Chipmunk knew {{perfectly}} well that that was just nonsense, but Striped Chipmunk learned {{a long time ago}} that when you are just bubbling right over with good feeling, there is fun in saying and doing foolish things, and that is just how he was feeling. So he ran along the old rail fence on one side of the Long Lane, saying foolish things and cutting up foolish capers just because he felt so good, and all the time seeing <b>all</b> that <b>those</b> bright <b>little</b> eyes of his could take in.|$|R
60|$|In the winter, {{the whole}} city sniffs, and if the Pipchin theory {{of the effect of}} {{sniffing}} upon the eternal interests of the soul be true, few people go to heaven from Venice. I sometimes wildly wondered if Desdemona, in her time, sniffed, and found little comfort in the reflection that Shylock must have had a cold in his head. There is comparative warmth in the broad squares before the churches, but the narrow streets are bitter thorough-draughts, and fell influenza lies in wait for its prey in <b>all</b> <b>those</b> picturesque, seducing <b>little</b> courts of which I have spoken.|$|R
5000|$|Roger Lewis: [...] "It was the melancholia of Sellers I {{was drawn}} to; <b>all</b> <b>those</b> {{shuffling}} <b>little</b> ghostly figures {{he used to}} play in Boulting brothers films, or Clouseau, with those soulful, mournful brown eyes. For all the success and the women, he is rather a lonely and melancholic figure. And that is what redeems him." [...] Hollywood was immediately interested in adapting Lewis's biography. In the mid-1990s Madonna's company Maverick bought the rights, but the Sellers project did not get off the ground. Many different writers worked on the screenplay, among them Lee Hall; eventually the writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely {{came up with a}} script to tell the story. Director Stephen Hopkins ultimately distanced himself from Lewis's book, and said he was inspired by Sellers's 16mm home movies, which were featured in a 1995 BBC Arena documentary, [...] "The Peter Sellers Story", directed by Peter Lydon.|$|R
