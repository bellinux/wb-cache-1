5|$|Jiyuan then {{travelled}} back to Port Arthur, {{where the}} foreign engineer refused {{to serve the}} captain of the vessel any longer, and left. Captain Fang Peh-Kien was executed for his actions in the battle, with command passed to First Lieutenant Huang Tsu-Lien. Of the surviving Chinese warships from the battle, the Jiyuan was the least damaged. As the other surviving ships from the battle arrived in Port Arthur, their guns were dressed in red. Jiyuan was the exception, with no decoration and was docked <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> vessels.|$|E
5|$|Upon impact, Rose lies {{unconscious}} on {{the beach}} with the fuselage survivors, but is eventually revived by Jack (Matthew Fox). During {{the first few days}} on the Island, Rose is in shock, and keeps herself <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> survivors, attracting the attention of Jack. While Jack believes that Bernard is dead, Rose is adamant that he is still alive. After Claire (Emilie de Ravin) is kidnapped by the Island's inhabitants (known to the survivors as the Others), Rose comforts Charlie (Dominic Monaghan), who believes it is not his fault and encourages him not to lose hope and prays for him.|$|E
5|$|At the start, Hamilton, Massa and Kovalainen all {{maintained}} their grid positions. Hamilton quickly {{began to pull}} <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> cars, {{at the rate of}} about half a second per lap. Behind the leading trio, Kubica passed Räikkönen off the grid, and went on to pass both Alonso and Trulli at the hairpin (turn 4), when Alonso's own attempted pass on Trulli delayed both drivers. The fight for fourth position continued {{in the early stages of}} the race. Kubica ran wide at the final corner on lap four, impeding Trulli and therefore allowing Alonso to attempt an overtaking manoeuvre on the Toyota down the main straight. However, Trulli held on to his position, and Alonso was instead passed by Räikkönen, moving him down to sixth position. At the back of the field, Nakajima spun his Williams but recovered back onto the track and continued in the race.|$|E

5|$|Laser {{remained}} in character as Heiter throughout the filming process, often shouting {{at the rest}} of the cast on set, but wherever possible staying <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> actors and crew between scenes to preserve a level of separation. He only ate food he had brought onto the set himself, eating mostly fruit. He contributed dialogue for his character and selected many of his character's outfits from his personal wardrobe. Six claims that the jacket Heiter wore, which was bought by Laser, was a genuine jacket worn by real Nazi doctors. Laser was also happy for the other actors in The Human Centipede to add their own ideas to the film. For example, when Heiter is explaining his procedure to his victims, Katsuro's dialogue was improvised, which pleased Laser. During filming Laser accidentally kicked Kitamura (Katsuro), leading to a fight on set between the actors. The incident contributed to the tension and anger throughout the scene they were filming, in which Heiter sits at his dining table eating while the centipede eats dog food from the floor alongside him. Laser also hurt Williams during the scene when Heiter roughly grabs and injects Lindsay, which caused a pause in shooting before the filmmakers could continue.|$|E
5|$|Works rapidly progressed {{following}} {{the arrival of}} Wray in 1851 with the Royal Engineers, known as the sappers. They trained convicts to work with limestone, which was quarried on-site. Soft stone was used to fill in swamps around Fremantle, and when the better quality stone ran out, quarries were opened at nearby sites such as Arthur Head. The first part to be constructed was a ramp connecting the town to the prison site. The graded and limestone-capped slope would later become Fairbairn Street. Once this was completed, the priority was the construction of accommodation for Henderson and the prison warders to relieve the expense of paying for private lodging. Cottages were built along Henderson Street in 1851, and Henderson's residence, a sizable building known as The Knowle, was completed in 1851 some distance <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> buildings, in the modern-day grounds of Fremantle Hospital. Houses for the senior staff were also constructed in the 1850s. They were situated {{at the front of}} the prison site, along the road then known as The Esplanade (modern day The Terrace).|$|E

25|$|The boiling {{points of}} {{components}} in an azeotrope overlap {{to form a}} band. By exposing an azeotrope to a vacuum or positive pressure, it's possible to bias the boiling point of one component <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> by exploiting the differing vapour pressure curves of each; the curves may overlap at the azeotropic point, but {{are unlikely to be}} remain identical further along the pressure axis either side of the azeotropic point. When the bias is great enough, the two boiling points no longer overlap and so the azeotropic band disappears.|$|E
25|$|Male common side-blotched lizards (Uta stansburiana) exhibit {{polymorphism}} {{in their}} throat pigmentation, and these different phenotypes are correlated with different mating strategies. Orange-throated males {{are the largest}} and most aggressive, defending large territories and keeping harems of females. Blue-throated males are of intermediate size, and guard smaller territories containing only a single female. Yellow-throated males are the smallest, and instead of holding territories they mimic females in order to sneak matings <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> two morphs. The balance between these three morphs is maintained by frequency-dependent selection.|$|E

25|$|Saint Joseph, also {{wearing white}} robes, {{stood on the}} Virgin's right hand. His head was bent forward from the {{shoulders}} towards the Blessed Virgin. Saint John the Evangelist stood {{to the left of}} the Blessed Virgin. He was dressed in a long robe and wore a mitre. He was partly turned <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> figures. He appeared to be preaching and he held open a large book in his left hand. To the left of St. John was an altar with a lamb on it with a cross standing on the altar behind the lamb.|$|E
25|$|Alistair Brownlee, Alexander Bryukhankov, James Elvery and Ivan Rana {{managed to}} pull clear {{from the rest of}} the field on the bike.

The overall series still had Gómez leading from Alistair and Bryukhankov. Several athletes pulled out including Chris McCormack with a hamstring tare. Olympic qualification was also up for grabs as Justus, Hauss and Vidal took spots, whilst Frodeno just edged out Petzold to claim the second German spot.|$|E
25|$|Starting in August 1896, Rhodes {{personally}} {{played a}} key role in ending the Matabele insurgency. With one of the widows of Mzilikazi (Lobengula's father) acting as a go-between, the Company and the rebel izinDuna arranged an indaba for 21 August: the izinDuna agreed to meet Rhodes and three companions in the Matopos Hills. At this meeting, the insurgents vehemently protested against their prior treatment under Company rule, prompting Rhodes to walk <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> whites and to sit among the Matabele instead, apparently intending to symbolically demonstrate empathy and a spirit of reconciliation. He told the Matabele that he was on their side, and that he would personally ensure the non-recurrence of any abuses. The izinDuna would be fully restored to the status they had held under Lobengula, he said, and there would be no retribution against those who had taken part in the Chimurenga. After four hours, it was agreed to continue the talks. Bitterness endured among some of the rebels, but three further indabas progressed well, and the Matabele rising ended amicably in October 1896.|$|E

25|$|Sir Rowland {{wonders if}} there is {{anything}} written on the autographed papers in invisible ink and they test them, revealing the names of six distributors of drugs, including Costello. Going to tell the police their findings, the sleeping Pippa is left alone and, after a moment, Jeremy re-enters and is about to smother the girl's face with a cushion when Clarissa comes back. She soon realises that he is the killer. He was <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> two men for a time after they had gone to the club to eat and a remark Pippa made about seeing his golf club ("A golf stick like Jeremy had", {{in the context of the}} weapon used to kill Costello) ties in. He also rang the police to try to incriminate Clarissa. Jeremy confesses; his motive was the envelope that the autographed papers were kept in – on it is an extremely rare error stamp worth the fourteen thousand pounds. He is about to kill Clarissa when the police enter the room, having heard the exchange, and arrest him. They take him away. The others go to bed and Henry returns but without his diplomatic guests who have failed to turn up. Like the police inspector, he fails to believe a word his wife tells him of the evening's events...|$|E

Wolfe Jr. saves his father, and spots Mason fleeing in the process. The hunt resumes and Mason begins to use his wits to beat the hunters, luring them with falsely-planted lit cigarettes to lead them in the wrong way. Mason manages to lure Griffin <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> and takes him hostage.|$|R

Any physical evidence that might have identified an attacker, such as hair, blood or semen, appeared to have been washed away during the time the body spent in the canal.|$|E
500|$|Rahm Emanuel was {{considered}} to be the leading candidate before the election. Chico {{was considered}} [...] "the rival with the best chance of forcing him into a runoff". During the election on February 22, Emanuel's 55% support dwarfed Chico's 24% support. Chico won in 10 of Chicago's 50 wards, while Emanuel won 40. The campaign's communications director claimed that controversy over Emanuel's eligibility to run for mayor may have diverted the focus of the press <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> candidates. After the election, Chico remained involved in the runoff elections for other city offices, endorsing a candidate for 25th Ward alderman.|$|E

In addition, the Parliament has already geared three quarters of its activity in the city. Third party organisations are also based in the city, including NGOs, trade unions, employers' organisations and the highest concentration of journalists in the world—also due to the presence of NATO in the city in addition to the large presence of Union institutions. While Strasbourg campaigners see being based in Strasbourg as an aid to independence of MEPs, Brussels' campaigners state it is merely reducing the institution's influence by [...] "exiling" [...] them <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> major institutions.|$|E
