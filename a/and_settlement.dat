40|$|This Article {{explores the}} case for {{including}} losses of foreign (non-U. S.) lives <b>and</b> <b>settlements</b> in the estimated cost to the United States of unmitigated climate change in the future. The inclusion of losses of such foreign lives <b>and</b> <b>settlements</b> in cost benefit analysis (CBA) could have large implications not only for U. S. climate change policy but also for policies adopted by other nations {{and the practice of}} CBA generally. One difficult problem is how to assess U.

S. residents 2 ̆ 7 willingness to pay to prevent the losses of foreign lives <b>and</b> <b>settlements.</b> The survey results reported in this Article suggest that U. S. residents substantially value foreign lives <b>and</b> <b>settlements.</b> Such results make the implicit assumption of CBAs as they are currently undertaken – that U. S. residents {{would be willing to pay}} nothing to save foreign lives <b>and</b> <b>settlements</b> – very hard to maintain...|$|R

5|$|Among Harrison's most {{enduring}} legacies is {{the series of}} treaties that he either negotiated or signed with Native American leaders during his tenure as the Indiana territorial governor.

5|$|The temple {{properties}} were {{no longer}} cultivated, and tanks were not maintained. Thus the population was surviving on slash and burn agriculture. British colonial policies favored the conversion of these lands into lucrative coconut plantations quickly covering all suitable Pattuva lands. Establishments of large-scale plantations also led to population increase due to migration <b>and</b> <b>settlement</b> of plantation workers from {{the interior of the}} country. This led to a demographic change, and the local Pattuva people became disassociated from the temple and its administration.|$|E

5|$|Although NASA was {{supporting}} {{his work with}} grants of up to $500,000 per year, O'Neill became frustrated by the bureaucracy and politics inherent in government-funded research. He thought that small privately funded groups could develop space technology faster than government agencies. In 1977, O'Neill and his wife Tasha founded the Space Studies Institute, a non-profit organization, at Princeton University.

5|$|British rule in Nyasaland radically {{altered the}} local {{indigenous}} power structures. The early colonial period saw some immigration <b>and</b> <b>settlement</b> by white colonists, who bought large swathes of territory from local chiefs, often for token payments in beads or guns. Most {{of the land}} acquired, particularly in the Shire Highlands, was converted into white-owned plantations where tea, coffee, cotton and tobacco were grown. The enforcement of colonial institutions, such as the Hut Tax, compelled many indigenous people to find paid work {{and the demand for}} labour created by the plantations, led to their becoming a major employer. Once employed on the plantations, black workers found that they were frequently beaten and subject to racial discrimination. Increasingly, the plantations were also forced to rely on a system of forced labour or corvée, known locally at the thangata.|$|E
5|$|Canada is a {{multilingual}} {{and multicultural}} society home {{to people of}} many different ethnic, religious and national origins, {{with the majority of}} the population made up of Old World immigrants and their descendants. Following the initial period of French and then the much larger British colonization, different waves (or peaks) of immigration <b>and</b> <b>settlement</b> of non-indigenous peoples took place over the course of nearly two centuries and continue today. Elements of Indigenous, French, British, and more recent immigrant customs, languages and religions have combined to form the culture of Canada and thus a Canadian identity. Canada has also been strongly influenced by its linguistic, geographic and economic neighbour, the United States.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{colonisation}} of Australia by the British, the 19th century saw {{the initial}} European exploration <b>and</b> <b>settlement</b> {{of the area}} and their encounters with the local indigenous peoples, beginning with the first explorations in 1820 and shortly followed by the first European settlements in 1824. At the outset the region was dominated by large properties used for sheep and cattle grazing, which had been granted to free settlers that had arrived in Australia from the United Kingdom and other European countries. These large properties were later broken up and subdivided in accordance with changes to land tenure arrangements, smaller farms and urban developments becoming more common.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the defeat}} of the British and their Indian allies in western Canada, Harrison and Lewis Cass, {{governor}} of the Michigan Territory, were delegated the responsibility for negotiating a peace treaty with the Indians, known as the Treaty of Greenville (1814). In June 1815, at President Madison's request, the U.S. government appointed Harrison to serve as one of the commissioners responsible for negotiating a second postwar treaty with the Indians that became known as the Treaty of Spring Wells (1815). Both treaties were advantageous to the United States. In the Spring Wells treaty the tribes ceded a large tract of land in the west, providing additional land for American purchase <b>and</b> <b>settlement.</b>|$|E
5|$|Great Oasis sites {{appeared}} in the Missouri River drainage, and have attributes of both Late Woodland and Late Prehistoric cultures. Great Oasis cultures extended through the eastern Plains from Iowa to South Dakota. Developing independently from the eastern Mississippian cultures, Great Oasis sites display large sites along major stream terraces, increased reliance on agriculture combined with hunting and gathering, substantial pit earth lodges, and a transition from Late Woodland to Late Prehistoric ceramic forms. Overall, Great Oasis {{appears to have been}} a regional adaptation of new forms of farming <b>and</b> <b>settlement</b> patterns, including seasonal occupation of different ecological zones, that includes aspects of Late Woodland and the subsequent Middle Missouri Tradition.|$|E
