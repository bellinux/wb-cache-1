5|$|Appointees to {{the offices}} of Steward of the Manor of Northstead and Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds are alternated so that two MPs can resign at once (<b>as</b> <b>happened</b> on 23 January 2017). However every new {{appointment}} to the Stewardship revokes the previous appointment {{so there is no}} difficulty in situations in which more than two resign, such as the 1985 walkout of Ulster Unionist MPs when several separate appointments were made on a single day.|$|E

5|$|The {{respiratory}} system {{is an important}} factor that limits the size of insects. As insects get bigger, this type of oxygen transport gets less efficient and thus the heaviest insect currently weighs less than 100g. However, with increased atmospheric oxygen levels, <b>as</b> <b>happened</b> in the late Paleozoic, larger insects were possible, such as dragonflies with wingspans of more than two feet.|$|E
5|$|Although very {{conveniently}} sited for passengers, Ramsgate Harbour station presented severe operating difficulties. Its {{situation at}} the end of a steep gradient in the tunnel meant there was the constant risk that an out-of-control train would run through the station onto the beach, <b>as</b> <b>happened</b> on 3August 1891 and 24March 1915. Cramped conditions allowed no room for station growth or improvement, and the small turntable meant larger engines could not be used, so heavier trains needed two engines to haul them up the tunnel's gradient. Additionally, by the 1920s the population of Ramsgate had almost doubled since the station had opened, making the freight facilities inadequate, with no room for expansion.|$|E
5|$|At present, {{the orbits}} of the Haumean moons appear almost exactly edge-on from Earth, with Namaka having {{periodically}} occulted Haumea from 2009 to 2011. Observation of such transits would provide precise information on {{the size and shape}} of Haumea and its moons, <b>as</b> <b>happened</b> in the late 1980s with Pluto and Charon. The tiny change in brightness of the system during these occultations required at least a medium-aperture professional telescope for detection. Hiʻiaka last occulted Haumea in 1999, a few years before its discovery, and will not do so again for some 130 years. However, in a situation unique among regular satellites, the great torquing of Namaka's orbit by Hiʻiaka preserved the viewing angle of Namaka–Haumea transits for several more years.|$|E

Ticket prices were increased from last year's final, with the most expensive tickets costing £90 up £4 from the previous year. The least expensive tickets cost £40, which was £2 more than last year. It was decided that before the match started national anthems would not be played. This {{decision was made to}} avoid spectators jeering the anthems, <b>as</b> <b>happened</b> during the 2008 FA Cup Final between Portsmouth and Cardiff.|$|E

5|$|Methods used {{to prevent}} malaria include medications, {{mosquito}} elimination and the prevention of bites. There is no vaccine for malaria. The presence of malaria in an area requires a combination of high human population density, high anopheles mosquito population density and high rates of transmission from humans to mosquitoes and from mosquitoes to humans. If any of these is lowered sufficiently, the parasite will eventually disappear from that area, <b>as</b> <b>happened</b> in North America, Europe {{and parts of the}} Middle East. However, unless the parasite is eliminated from the whole world, it could become re-established if conditions revert to a combination that favors the parasite's reproduction. Furthermore, the cost per person of eliminating anopheles mosquitoes rises with decreasing population density, making it economically unfeasible in some areas.|$|E

5|$|Temple {{construction}} {{did not end}} {{once the}} original plan was complete; pharaohs often rebuilt or replaced decayed temple structures or made additions to those still standing. In the course of these additions, they frequently dismantled old temple buildings to use as fill for the interiors of new structures. On rare occasions {{this may have been}} because the old structures or their builders had become anathema, as with Akhenaten's temples, but in most cases the reason seems to have been convenience. Such expansion and dismantling could considerably distort the original temple plan, <b>as</b> <b>happened</b> at the enormous Precinct of Amun-Re at Karnak, which developed two intersecting axes and several satellite temples.|$|E
5|$|The 2004–05 NHL {{season was}} {{cancelled}} {{because of a}} labor dispute, but upon the League's return for the 2005–06 season, a rule was added which meant that any player being assessed for an instigator penalty {{in the last five}} minutes of a match would receive an automatic one-game ban, and the player's head coach could also be fined. This was designed to avoid situations such <b>as</b> <b>happened</b> in game between the Flyers and Senators, and addressed the fact that physical play tended to increase towards the end of a game, particularly when the result was not in question.|$|E
5|$|The JNA {{responded by}} {{launching}} a major offensive in eastern Slavonia, {{from where it}} intended to progress west via Vinkovci and Osijek to Zagreb. The army did not bypass Vukovar, because they wished to relieve the besieged barracks and to eliminate a possible threat to their supply lines. The JNA leadership {{did not intend to}} make Vukovar the main focus of the offensive but, <b>as</b> <b>happened</b> with Stalingrad in the Second World War, an initially inconsequential engagement became an essential political symbol for both sides.|$|E

5|$|The {{demand for}} iridium surged from 2.5 tonnes in 2009 to 10.4 tonnes in 2010, {{mostly because of}} electronics-related {{applications}} that saw a rise from 0.2 to 6 tonnes – iridium crucibles are commonly used for growing large high-quality single crystals, demand for which has increased sharply. This increase in iridium consumption is predicted to saturate due to accumulating stocks of crucibles, <b>as</b> <b>happened</b> earlier in the 2000s. Other major applications include spark plugs that consumed 0.78 tonnes of iridium in 2007, electrodes for the chloralkali process (1.1 t in 2007) and chemical catalysts (0.75 t in 2007).|$|E
5|$|The red-billed chough {{has a long}} {{association}} with Cornwall, and appears on the Cornish coat of arms. According to Cornish legend King Arthur did not die after his last battle but rather his soul migrated {{into the body of}} a red-billed chough, the red colour of its bill and legs being derived from the blood of the last battle and hence killing this bird was unlucky. Legend also holds that after the last Cornish chough departs from Cornwall, then the return of the chough, <b>as</b> <b>happened</b> in 2001, will mark the return of King Arthur.|$|E
5|$|A {{close link}} {{existed between the}} ruler and the Sangha (Buddhist priesthood) since the {{introduction}} of Buddhism to the country. This relationship was further strengthened during Dutthagamani's reign. The monks often advised and even guided the king on decisions. This association was initially with the Mahavihara sect, but {{by the middle of}} the 1st century BC, the Abhayagiri sect had also begun to have a close link to the ruling of the country. By the end of the 3rd century AD, the Jetavana sect had also become close to the ruler. Estrangements between the ruler and the priesthood often weakened the government, <b>as</b> <b>happened</b> during the reign of Lanjatissa. Even Valagamba's resistance movement was initially hampered because of a rift with the Mahavihara, and he succeeded only after a reconciliation was affected. Some rulers patronized only one sect, but this often led to unrest in the country and most rulers equally supported all sects. Despite this, religious establishments were often plundered during times of internal strife by the rulers themselves, such as during the reigns of Dathopatissa I (639–650) and Kashyapa II (650–659).|$|E

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>happened</b> {{to other}} members of the royal family, Boril's {{ascension}} forced Strez and his closest supporters to flee, in that case to neighbouring Serbia, where he was welcomed by the reigning Stefan Nemanjić (1196–1228) in 1207 or early 1208. Even though Boril requested the extradition of Strez to Bulgaria, the Serbian ruler hoped to use Strez as a puppet in gaining Bulgarian-held territory. Stefan believed that Strez's royal ancestry and imperial aspirations would make it much easier to impose Serbian rule over Macedonia, Kosovo and Braničevo, as well as Belgrade, all captured by Bulgaria under Kaloyan. At the same time, Boril was unable to take military action against Strez and his Serbian patron, as he had suffered a major defeat {{at the hands of the}} Latins at Plovdiv. Stefan went as far as to become a blood brother of Strez in a ceremony which Stefan was hoping would secure Strez's loyalty.|$|E
5|$|Henry re-granted Pevensey Castle to Gilbert I de l'Aigle but {{continued}} {{to use it for}} his own purposes, <b>as</b> <b>happened</b> in 1101 when he spent the summer at Pevensey to deter a threatened invasion by Duke Robert of Normandy. Pevensey was confiscated again by the Crown under King Stephen, with Gilbert's family also losing the rest of their possessions. It was subsequently re-granted to Gilbert de Clare, 1st Earl of Pembroke, who switched his allegiance to Stephen's cousin and rival, the Empress Matilda, in 1141. Although Gilbert changed his loyalty back to Stephen the following year, he was taken hostage by the king in 1147 after a revolt by Gilbert's uncle, Ranulf de Gernon, 4th Earl of Chester. A promise to surrender the Clare family's castles secured Gilbert's release but {{as soon as he was}} freed, he too rebelled. In response, Stephen undertook the second siege of Pevensey Castle with a land and sea blockade. The castle once again proved impervious to direct assault but the garrison was eventually starved out.|$|E
5|$|However, <b>as</b> <b>happened</b> to many {{prominent}} {{individuals in}} the Athenian democracy, Themistocles's fellow citizens grew jealous of his success, and possibly tired of his boasting. It is probable that in early 479 BC, Themistocles was stripped of his command; instead, Xanthippus was to command the Athenian fleet, and Aristides the land forces. Though Themistocles was no doubt politically and militarily active {{for the rest of}} the campaign, no mention of his activities in 479 BC is made in the ancient sources. In the summer of that year, after receiving an Athenian ultimatum, the Peloponnesians finally agreed to assemble an army and march to confront Mardonius, who had reoccupied Athens in June. At the decisive Battle of Plataea, the Allies destroyed the Persian army, while apparently on the same day, the Allied navy destroyed the remnants of the Persian fleet at the Battle of Mycale. These twin victories completed the Allied triumph, and ended the Persian threat to Greece.|$|E
