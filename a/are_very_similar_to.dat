5|$|At Takalik Abaj the potbelly style monuments all {{date to the}} Late Preclassic. Stylistically, {{the monuments}} <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> those of Kaminaljuyu and Monte Alto. Seven monuments are potbelly sculptures (Monuments 2, 3, 19, 40, 69, 94 and 117), six of these {{represent}} complete figures. Three monuments are small potbelly sculptures (Monuments 100, 107 and 109) and one sculpture is a colossal head in potbelly style (Monument 99).|$|E
5|$|Hire-purchase {{agreements}} are also regulated by this Act. The provisions <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> those for {{sale of goods}} agreements, with the section on exclusion clauses identical. Under the 1893 Act, conditional sale agreements (where the buyer takes possession of the goods, but the seller retains the right to repossess them) were treated as hire-purchase agreements, despite being fundamentally sales. With the unification of provisions for hire-purchase and sale of goods agreements, conditional sale {{agreements are}} now treated as sales.|$|E
5|$|Peléan eruptions are {{characterized}} most prominently by the incandescent pyroclastic flows that they drive. The mechanics of a Peléan eruption <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> {{that of a}} Vulcanian eruption, except that in Peléan eruptions the volcano's structure is able to withstand more pressure, hence the eruption occurs as one large explosion rather than several smaller ones.|$|E
50|$|His name <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> that of Latin god Volcanus, {{who himself}} was {{considered}} to be the father of Caeculus and Servius Tullius, not to mention Romulus in the version transmitted by Promathion, which <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> the legend of Servius.|$|R
50|$|It {{may also}} contain {{functionality}} that <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> that {{in another part}} of a program is required and a developer independently writes code that <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> what exists elsewhere. Studies suggest, that such independently rewritten code is typically not syntactically similar.|$|R

5|$|Spectra of {{the main}} ring {{obtained}} by the HST, Keck, Galileo and Cassini have shown that particles forming it are red, i.e. their albedo is higher at longer wavelengths. The existing spectra span the range 0.5–2.5 μm. No spectral features have been found so far which {{can be attributed to}} particular chemical compounds, although the Cassini observations yielded evidence for absorption bands near 0.8μm and 2.2μm. The spectra {{of the main}} ring <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> Adrastea and Amalthea.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no sexual}} dimorphism. Juveniles <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> adults, but the streaks on the mantle are blue rather than white. The primary coverts of juveniles {{are also more}} closely lined with blue, and the underparts are paler overall, {{especially}} on the chest. Adults perform a complete moult after the breeding season, whereas juveniles only have a partial moult, in which they replace a variable number of rectrices.|$|E
5|$|This {{species at}} its {{breeding}} sites gives a long mournful call like the hooting of a tawny owl, {{and a much}} less frequent sound like the whimpering of a pup. It is silent at sea. The breeding calls <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> those of Fea's petrel, and Bretagnolle's analysis of the calls of the soft-plumaged petrel complex led him to suggest in 1995 only a two-way species split, with the northern forms madeira, feae and deserti all as subspecies of Fea's petrel.|$|E

5|$|Adaptation occurs {{through the}} gradual {{modification}} of existing structures. Consequently, structures with similar internal organisation {{may have different}} functions in related organisms. This {{is the result of}} a single ancestral structure being adapted to function in different ways. The bones within bat wings, for example, <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> those in mice feet and primate hands, due to the descent of all these structures from a common mammalian ancestor. However, since all living organisms are related to some extent, even organs that appear to have little or no structural similarity, such as arthropod, squid and vertebrate eyes, or the limbs and wings of arthropods and vertebrates, can depend on a common set of homologous genes that control their assembly and function; this is called deep homology.|$|E
5|$|Berkelium forms a {{trigonal}} (η5–C5H5)3Bk complex {{with three}} cyclopentadienyl rings, {{which can be}} synthesized by reacting berkelium(III) chloride with the molten beryllocene Be(C5H5)2 at about 70 °C. It has an amber color and orthorhombic symmetry, with the lattice constants of a = 1411 pm, b = 1755 pm and c = 963 pm and the calculated density of 2.47 g/cm3. The complex is stable to heating to at least 250 °C, and sublimates without melting at about 350 °C. The high radioactivity of berkelium gradually destroys the compound within a period of weeks. One C5H5 ring in (η5–C5H5)3Bk can be substituted by chlorine to yield 2. The optical absorption spectra of this compound <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> those of (η5–C5H5)3Bk.|$|E

5|$|Croatia {{first elected}} 12 {{members of the}} European Parliament (MEPs) in a {{by-election}} held after its accession to the EU in 2013. Thereafter, its number of members in the European Parliament was reduced to 11 and the country elected {{them as part of}} the regular election in 2014. The elections are regulated by special legislation enacted by the Sabor. Provisions of the legislation <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> the parliamentary-election legislation, with the main difference being that the 11 members of the European Parliament are elected in a single constituency encompassing all of Croatia, instead of multiple constituencies used in the parliamentary elections.|$|E
5|$|In 1856, Joseph Leidy {{described}} two tyrannosaurid premaxillary teeth from Montana. Although {{there was}} no indication of what the animal looked like, the teeth were large and robust, and Leidy gave them the name Deinodon. Matthew and Brown commented in 1922 that these teeth were indistinguishable from those of Gorgosaurus, but in the absence of skeletal remains of Deinodon, opted not to unequivocally synonymize the two genera, provisionally naming a ?Deinodon libratus. Although Deinodon teeth <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> those of Gorgosaurus, tyrannosaurid teeth are extremely uniform, so it cannot be said for certain which animal they belonged to. Deinodon is usually regarded as a nomen dubium today. Additional likely synonyms of G. libratus and/or D. horridus include Laelaps falculus, Laelaps hazenianus, Laelaps incrassatus, and Dryptosaurus kenabekides.|$|E
5|$|In {{the modern}} era, {{population}} peaked {{in the mid}} 19th century at just over 32,000 and declined for a century thereafter {{to a low of}} fewer than 18,000 in the 1970s. Declines were particularly significant in the outlying islands, some of which remain vulnerable to ongoing losses. Although Orkney is in many ways very distinct from the other islands and archipelagos of Scotland these trends <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> those experienced elsewhere. The archipelago's population grew by 11% in the decade to 2011 as recorded by the census. During the same period Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702.|$|E

5|$|Many other binary {{nitrogen}} hydrides are known, but {{the most}} important are hydrazine (N2H4) and hydrogen azide (HN3). Although it is not a nitrogen hydride, hydroxylamine (NH2OH) is similar in properties and structure to ammonia and hydrazine as well. Hydrazine is a fuming, colourless liquid that smells similarly to ammonia. Its physical properties <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> those of water (melting point 2.0°C, boiling point 113.5°C, density 1.00g·cm−3). Despite it being an endothermic compound, it is kinetically stable. It burns quickly and completely in air very exothermically to give nitrogen and water vapour. It is a very useful and versatile reducing agent and is a weaker base than ammonia. It is also commonly used as a rocket fuel.|$|E
5|$|Niobium is {{slightly}} less electropositive and more compact {{than its predecessor}} in the periodic table, zirconium, whereas it is virtually identical in size to the heavier tantalum atoms, {{as a result of}} the lanthanide contraction. As a result, niobium's chemical properties <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> those for tantalum, which appears directly below niobium in the periodic table. Although its corrosion resistance is not as outstanding as that of tantalum, the lower price and greater availability make niobium attractive for less demanding applications, such as vat linings in chemical plants.|$|E
5|$|Sculptures of the Potbelly style {{are found}} {{all along the}} Pacific Coast from {{southern}} Mexico to El Salvador, as well as further afield at sites in the Maya lowlands. Although some investigators have suggested that this style is pre-Olmec, archaeological excavations on the Pacific Coast, including those at Takalik Abaj, have shown that this style began to be used {{at the end of}} the Middle Preclassic and reached its height during the Late Preclassic. The potbelly sculptures at Takalik Abaj all date to the Late Preclassic and <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> those at Monte Alto in Escuintla and Kaminaljuyu in the Valley of Guatemala.|$|E

5|$|Zeta Tucanae is a yellow-white main {{sequence}} star of spectral type F9.5V and an apparent magnitude of 4.20 located 28 light-years {{away from the}} Solar System. Despite having a slightly lower mass, this star is more luminous than the Sun. The composition and mass of this star <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> the Sun, with a slightly lower mass and an estimated age of three billion years. The solar-like qualities make it a target of interest for investigating the possible existence of a life-bearing planet. It {{appears to have a}} debris disk orbiting it at a minimum radius of 2.3 astronomical units. As of 2009, no planet has been discovered in orbit around this star.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, Edward and Gaveston {{may have}} simply been {{friends with a}} close working relationship. Contemporary chronicler {{comments}} are vaguely worded; Orleton's allegations were {{at least in part}} politically motivated, and <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> the highly politicised sodomy allegations made against Pope Boniface VIII and the Knights Templar in 1303 and 1308 respectively. Later accounts by chroniclers of Edward's activities may trace back to Orleton's original allegations, and were certainly adversely coloured by the events at the end of Edward's reign. Such historians as Michael Prestwich and Seymour Phillips have argued that the public nature of the English royal court would have made it unlikely that any homosexual affairs would have remained discreet; neither the contemporary Church, Edward's father nor his father-in-law appear to have made any adverse comments about Edward's sexual behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Calcium {{is a very}} ductile silvery metal with a {{pale yellow}} tint whose {{properties}} <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> the heavier elements in its group, strontium, barium, and radium. A calcium atom has twenty electrons, arranged in the electron configuration 4s2. Like the other elements placed in group 2 of the periodic table, calcium has two valence electrons in the outermost s-orbital, which are very easily lost in chemical reactions to form a dipositive ion with the stable electron configuration of a noble gas, in this case argon. Hence, calcium is almost always divalent in its compounds, which are usually ionic. Hypothetical univalent salts of calcium would be stable {{with respect to their}} elements, but not to disproportionation to the divalent salts and calcium metal, because the enthalpy of formation of MX2 is much higher than those of the hypothetical MX. This occurs because of the much greater lattice energy afforded by the more highly charged Ca2+ cation compared to the hypothetical Ca+ cation.|$|E
