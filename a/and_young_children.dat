5|$|Premastication is {{complementary}} to breastfeeding in {{the health}} practices of infants <b>and</b> <b>young</b> <b>children,</b> providing large amounts of carbohydrate and protein nutrients not always available through breast milk, and micronutrients such as iron, zinc, and vitamin B12 which are essential nutrients present mainly in meat. Compounds in the saliva, such as haptocorrin also help increase B12 availability by protecting the vitamin against stomach acid.|$|E
5|$|For infants <b>and</b> <b>young</b> <b>children,</b> orotracheal {{intubation}} {{is easier}} than the nasotracheal route. Nasotracheal intubation carries a risk of dislodgement of adenoids and nasal bleeding. Despite the greater difficulty, nasotracheal intubation route is preferable to orotracheal intubation in children undergoing intensive care and requiring prolonged intubation because this route allows a more secure fixation of the tube. As with adults, {{there are a number}} of devices specially designed for assistance with difficult tracheal intubation in children. Confirmation of proper position of the tracheal tube is accomplished as with adult patients.|$|E

Three WHA resolutions on infant <b>and</b> <b>young</b> <b>child</b> nutrition subsequent {{to the adoption of}} the Code specifically cautioned against conflicts of interest. A 1996 resolution (WHA resolution 49.15) called for caution in accepting financial support for health professionals working in infant <b>and</b> <b>young</b> <b>child</b> health which may create conflicts of interest. The need to avoid conflicts of interest was expanded in 2005 (WHA resolution 58.32) to cover programmes in infant <b>and</b> <b>young</b> <b>child</b> health <b>and</b> reiterated in 2008 (WHA resolution 61.20).|$|R

5|$|However, stool {{cultures}} {{should be}} performed in those with blood in the stool, those {{who might have been}} exposed to food poisoning, and those who have recently traveled to the developing world. It may also be appropriate in children young than 5, old people, and those with poor immune function. Diagnostic testing may also be done for surveillance. As hypoglycemia occurs in approximately 10% of infants <b>and</b> <b>young</b> <b>children,</b> measuring serum glucose in this population is recommended. Electrolytes and kidney function should also be checked when there is a concern about severe dehydration.|$|E
5|$|Sir Gawain and the Green Knight {{was adapted}} into an opera called Gawain by Harrison Birtwistle, first {{performed}} in 1991. Birtwistle's opera was praised {{for maintaining the}} complexity of the poem while translating it into lyric, musical form. Another operatic adaptation is Lynne Plowman's Gwyneth and the Green Knight, first performed in 2002. This opera uses Sir Gawain as the backdrop but refocuses the story on Gawain's female squire, Gwyneth, who is trying to become a knight. Plowman's version was praised for its approachability, as its target is the family audience <b>and</b> <b>young</b> <b>children,</b> but criticised for its use of modern language and occasional preachy nature.|$|E
5|$|The typical {{symptoms}} of a cold include a cough, a runny nose, nasal congestion and a sore throat, sometimes accompanied by muscle ache, fatigue, headache, and loss of appetite. A sore throat is present in about 40% of cases and a cough in about 50%, while muscle ache occurs in about half. In adults, a fever is generally not present but it is common in infants <b>and</b> <b>young</b> <b>children.</b> The cough is usually mild compared to that accompanying influenza. While a cough and a fever indicate a higher likelihood of influenza in adults, {{a great deal of}} similarity exists between these two conditions. A number of the viruses that cause the common cold may also result in asymptomatic infections.|$|E

In contrast to the forty-three dollars that Cade and his team spent {{to make the first}} experimental batch of Gatorade in 1965, Gatorade prompted the evolution of a multibillion-dollar sports drink industry in the years that followed; as of 2007, over seven billion bottles of Gatorade were being sold annually in the United States. While he was surprised by its commercial success as a sports drink, Cade took greater pride in Gatorade's use in hospitals, in post-operative recovery and to treat diarrhea-related dehydration in infants <b>and</b> <b>young</b> <b>children.</b> Cade's other research included hypertension, exercise physiology, autism, schizophrenia and kidney disease. His research into carbo-loading substantiated the early claims of Swedish researchers, and he also invented a hydraulic football helmet that substantially reduced the risk of concussion to football players.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Willie Company departing Florence, {{the company}} met {{to debate the}} wisdom of such a late departure. Because the emigrants were {{unfamiliar}} with the trail and the climate, they deferred to the returning missionaries and Church agents. One of the returning missionaries, Levi Savage, urged them to spend the winter in Nebraska. He argued that such a late departure with a company consisting of the elderly, women <b>and</b> <b>young</b> <b>children</b> would lead to suffering, sickness and even death. All of the other Church elders argued that the trip should go forward, expressing optimism that the company would be protected by divine intervention. Some members of the company, {{perhaps as many as}} 100, decided to spend the winter in Florence or in Iowa, but the majority, about 404 in number (including Savage) continued the journey west. The Willie Company left Florence on August 17 and the Martin Company on August 27. Two ox-wagon trains, led by captains W.B. Hodgett and John A. Hunt, followed the Martin Company.|$|E
5|$|Severe {{disease is}} more common in babies <b>and</b> <b>young</b> <b>children,</b> and in {{contrast}} to many other infections, it {{is more common}} in children who are relatively well nourished. Other risk factors for severe disease include female sex, high body mass index, and viral load. While each serotype can cause the full spectrum of disease, virus strain is a risk factor. Infection with one serotype is thought to produce lifelong immunity to that type, but only short-term protection against the other three. The risk of severe disease from secondary infection increases if someone previously exposed to serotype DENV-1 contracts serotype DENV-2 or DENV-3, or if someone previously exposed to DENV-3 acquires DENV-2. Dengue can be life-threatening in people with chronic diseases such as diabetes and asthma.|$|E

5|$|The term {{maternal}} deprivation is a catch-phrase summarising {{the early}} work of psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, John Bowlby {{on the effects}} of separating infants <b>and</b> <b>young</b> <b>children</b> from their mother (or mother substitute) although the effect of loss of the mother on the developing child had been considered earlier by Freud and other theorists. Bowlby's work on delinquent and affectionless children and the effects of hospital and institutional care led to his being commissioned to write the World Health Organisation's report on the mental health of homeless children in post-war Europe whilst he was head of the Department for Children and Parents at the Tavistock Clinic in London after World War II. The result was the monograph Maternal Care and Mental Health published in 1951, which sets out the maternal deprivation hypothesis.|$|E

40|$|Background A {{preliminary}} review of nutrition reports for Harare City revealed that set targets for exclusive breastfeeding rate, timely initiation of breastfeeding, median duration of breastfeeding and stunting were not met. All {{these are a}} consequence of poor infant feeding knowledge, attitudes and practices on the child. This study aims {{to find out the}} effect of community infant <b>and</b> <b>young</b> <b>child</b> feeding counseling on maternal knowledge attitudes and practices on optimal infant feeding in Harare City. Methodology A prospective cohort study was conducted in Harare City on pregnant and lactating women. The exposure was receiving counseling in community infant <b>and</b> <b>young</b> <b>child</b> feeding. Interviewer administered questionnaires, key informant interviews, focus group discussions and record reviews were used to collect data. iii Results Mothers who received counseling in community infant <b>and</b> <b>young</b> <b>child</b> feeding had better knowledge on optimal infant <b>and</b> <b>young</b> <b>child</b> feeding at endpoint (mean knowledge score = 7. 8, SD = 1. 36) compared to the unexposed group (mean knowledge score = 5. 4, SD = 1. 53) and this was statistically significant (p = 0. 005). Community infant <b>and</b> <b>young</b> <b>child</b> feeding counseling had an effect on timely initiation of breastfeeding, giving water, exclusive breastfeeding and giving solids.
