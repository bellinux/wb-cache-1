However, Rossi was fastest {{in five of the}} six pre-season tests. Stoner qualified on pole for the season opener in Qatar, and was leading the race when he crashed out, later acknowledging that this was his own mistake. He also crashed out of round 3 at Le Mans, this time attributing the crash {{to the front of the}} bike unloading when not running at maximum pace. His first podium of the year came at Assen, despite struggling with <b>arm</b> <b>pump</b> late in the race.|$|E

5000|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1952 as [...] "Ingenieurbüro LEWA" [...] ("Engineering Office LEWA") by the two {{engineers}} Herbert Ott and Rudolf Schestag. LEWA stands for Leonberger Wasseraufbereitung (water conditioning in Leonberg). In 1954, LEWA applied for a patent for the rocker <b>arm</b> <b>pump.</b> In 1955, the company participated in Achema, an exhibition in Frankfurt am Main, for the first time.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, {{he began}} the season for Team Sobe Suzuki with a broken finger, and had {{difficulty}} adjusting to the race situation with crowds and lights. He also had problems with fitness, suffering <b>arm</b> <b>pump,</b> and fired his trainer. Windham broke his femur in a horrific crash in Atlanta. Windham {{did not return to}} the circuit that season and many speculated that he would retire at the young age of 23, however the enforced rest allowed him to fully recover mentally and physically.|$|E
5000|$|Moon {{was partly}} {{distinguishable}} by his running style. Mark Ella wrote of Moon {{that he was}} ‘a beautiful runner’ and that, “Moon was a runner of the classical type. He had a high knee action and his <b>arms</b> <b>pumped</b> as he ran.” David Campese has asserted that, “His running style was especially impressive. He looked like a genuine track sprinter.” Rugby journalist Terry Smith once said of Moon’s running that, “With his fluent, graceful stride, it’s easy to imagine Brendan Moon putting {{on a pair of}} spikes and running for Australia in the Olympics." ...|$|R

(It opened from Dartmouth Arms to New Cross in January 1847, using gravitation northbound and the Dartmouth <b>Arms</b> <b>pumping</b> station southbound.) In {{a situation in which}} public confidence was important, the Directors could not express their doubts publicly, at least until a final decision had been taken. On 4 May 1847 the directors announced [...] "that the Croydon Atmospheric pipes were pulled up and the plan abandoned".|$|R
50|$|He {{started the}} 2001 season in {{typically}} strong form; winning 2 {{of the first}} 3 main events. However, he lost the next event to Team Kawasaki's Ricky Carmichael. Carmichael would then win every race from there on out; dethroning McGrath as Supercross champion and equalling his 1996 win record of 13 consecutive main event victories. McGrath returned in 2002 {{to take a shot}} at regaining his crown, but chronic <b>arm</b> <b>pump</b> and perhaps age caught up with him, and he could only muster a 3rd place in the final standings behind Carmichael and Yamaha's David Vuillemin.|$|E

40|$|The lights dimmed, {{the stage}} door was cracked and then swung wide, and the pianist shuffled out, bent {{slightly}} forward, <b>arms</b> <b>pumping.</b> He was the sinker on a plumb line {{drawn by the}} gravity of the applause. As if its patter were the aural manifestation of that force, like the crackling of an electrical wire. He offered a series of furtive bows, each little more than a nod, to different sections of the audience. He was as stiff as a bird, and nearly as devoid of expression. No fiddling with the height or distance of the piano bench, no tossing of his coattails; the heroic opening chords of the Hammerklavier rang out in the auditorium before the applause had a chance to die down...|$|R
5000|$|Fosbury {{continued}} to refine his technique, developing a curved, J-shaped approach run. This {{allowed him to}} increase his speed, while the final [...] "curved" [...] steps served to rotate his hips. As his speed increased, so did his elevation. Fosbury made little-to-no use of his arms at takeoff, failing to [...] "pump" [...] them upwards, keeping them down, close to his body: {{the next generation of}} floppers would add an <b>arm</b> <b>pump.</b> Fosbury's key discovery was the need to adjust his point-of-takeoff as the bar was raised. His flight through the air described a parabola: as the bar went up in height, he needed more [...] "flight time" [...] so that the top of his arc was achieved as his hips passed over the bar. To increase [...] "flight time," [...] Fosbury moved his takeoff farther and farther away from the bar (and the pit). Jumpers have a natural tendency to be drawn in closer to the bar and it requires mental discipline to move out, rather than in. By way of comparison, classic Straddle jumpers plant their take-off foot in the same place every time, less than one foot away from a line parallel with the bar. Photographs of Fosbury attempting heights above 7 ft show him taking off nearly 4 ft out from the bar.|$|E
50|$|Needle {{bearings}} {{are heavily}} used in automobile components such as rocker <b>arm</b> pivots, <b>pumps,</b> compressors, and transmissions. The drive shaft of a rear-wheel drive vehicle typically {{has at least}} eight needle bearings (four in each U joint) and often more if it is particularly long, or operates on steep slopes.|$|R
50|$|Athletes stay low to {{the ground}} by keeping their <b>arms</b> <b>pumping</b> low, close to their hips. If one sees a racewalker's {{shoulders}} rising, it may be a sign that the athlete is losing contact with the ground. What appears to be an exaggerated swivel to the hip is, in fact, a full rotation of the pelvis. Athletes aim to move the pelvis forward, and to minimize sideways motion in order to achieve maximum forward propulsion. Speed is achieved by stepping quickly with the aim of rapid turnover. This minimizes the risk of the feet leaving the ground. Strides are short and quick, with pushoff coming forward from the ball of the foot, again to minimize the risk of losing contact with the ground. World-class racewalkers (male and female) can average under four and five minutes per kilometre in a 20-km racewalk.|$|R
5000|$|Originally {{consisting}} of the [...] "T-Step" [...] combined with arm movements, during the 1990s the [...] "Running Man" [...] has been adopted into the dance, accentuating the new focus of keeping time with the beat. The [...] "Running man" [...] involves a 2-step motion in which the front foot is brought backwards with two hops while the back foot is brought forwards in a walking motion, creating a [...] "running on the spot" [...] motion, hence the name. The [...] "T-Step" [...] is a fast sideways heel-toe motion on one foot twisting at the ankle. The dance is embellished by spins, <b>arm</b> <b>pumps,</b> slides, and kicks. Modern implementations of the dance include motions from other dances such as Crip Walk, Toprock and Jumpstyle, which have brought the less-adaptive t-step to the background. Some dancers even omit the t-step completely.|$|R

500|$|In Mirror's Edge, {{the player}} {{controls}} the protagonist, Faith, from a first-person perspective {{as she is}} challenged to navigate across a gleaming city by jumping between rooftops, running across walls, and gaining access to buildings through ventilation shafts. This is accomplished by use of techniques and movements inspired by the discipline of parkour. According to senior producer Owen O'Brien, Mirror's Edge aims to [...] "convey [...] strain and physical contact with the environment", {{with the goal of}} allowing a freedom of movement previously unseen in the first-person genre. In order to achieve this, camera movement pays more attention to character movement. For example, as Faith's speed builds up while running, {{the rate at which the}} camera bobs up and down increases as well. When a roll is executed, the camera spins with the character. Faith's arms, legs, and torso are prominent and their visibility is used to convey movement and momentum. The character's <b>arms</b> <b>pump</b> and the length of her steps increase with her gait, and her legs cycle and arms flail during long jumps.|$|R
40|$|A {{floating}} {{wind turbine}} system with a tower structure that includes at least one stability arm extending therefrom and that is anchored to the sea floor with a rotatable position retention device that facilitates deep water installations. Variable buoyancy for the wind turbine system is provided by buoyancy chambers that are integral to the tower itself {{as well as the}} stability <b>arm.</b> <b>Pumps</b> are included for adjusting the buoyancy as an aid in system transport, installation, repair and removal. The wind turbine rotor is located downwind of the tower structure to allow the wind turbine to follow the wind direction without an active yaw drive system. The support tower and stability arm structure is designed to balance tension in the tether with buoyancy, gravity and wind forces {{in such a way that}} the top of the support tower leans downwind, providing a large clearance between the support tower and the rotor blade tips. This large clearance facilitates the use of articulated rotor hubs to reduced damaging structural dynamic loads. Major components of the turbine can be assembled at the shore and transported to an offshore installation site...|$|R
50|$|The battery site, {{situated}} on the northern bank of the dam, has been stripped of all buildings and plant. Remaining, are a broken concrete engine mount, concrete and aggregate foundations for twenty head of stamps, a twenty head camshaft with ten cams, and a beam <b>pump</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|R
50|$|One type of {{instrument}} used to get the abrasion rate and normalized abrasion rate is the abrasion scrub tester, which {{is made up of}} a mechanical <b>arm,</b> liquid <b>pump,</b> and programmable electronics. The machine draws the mechanical arm with attached brush (or sandpaper, sponge, etc.) over the surface of the material that is being tested. The operator sets a pre-programmed number of passes for a repeatable and controlled result. The liquid pump can provide detergent or other liquids to the mechanical arm during testing to simulate washing and other normal uses.|$|R
25|$|The Croydon Consuls Pump Shaft {{is located}} about 150m north-west of the Croydon Consols cyanide plant, between {{the western end}} of the {{tailings}} dump and the eastern bank of Golden Gate Creek.

The site includes remains of a shaft, <b>pump</b> <b>arm,</b> concrete and log mounts, engine parts, a winding unit and a boiler.|$|R
5000|$|In 1908 Jones {{applied for}} a patent on a 2-stroke {{gasoline}} engine that he described as [...] "new and useful" [...] because of its claimed simplicity. The motor design used only five movable parts and did not use a typical radiator and water system to cool the motor. Integral ribs and fins on the internal piston surfaces were designed to cool the motor through the movement of exterior air and fuel mixing inside the combustion cylinder. Advertising for the motor described a [...] "vapor-cooled engine ... it has no valves, no cams, no gears, no push-rods, no rollers, no rocker <b>arms,</b> no <b>pumps,</b> no radiator, and no water." [...] Jones was granted US Utility Patent 963,898 for his engine on July, 12, 1910.|$|R

50|$|The {{painting}} measures 73 xx 55 in. It depicts several crewmen on {{the deck}} of a ship in a storm, manning the pump to remove water from the vessel. The ship has lost at least one of its sails, and the deck is awash. The red ensign hangs upside down from the shrouds to indicate the ship's distress. One man shouts up towards the rigging, and another is up in the shrouds gesturing at the swell. The lively composition uses diagonal lines - <b>arms,</b> rigging, mast, <b>pump</b> handle, wind-blown flag - to draw the eye around the painting.|$|R
50|$|This site {{is located}} {{to the west}} of {{hospital}} and directly adjacent to the southern side of the Mungana Branch Railway Line. The site includes the main mine shaft, remnants of the <b>pump</b> <b>arm,</b> a large brick and concrete tank stand, wooden posts, numerous concrete foundations, pipes, and a riveted metal chimney that has collapsed. The geography of the area is varied and includes both natural features, such as a large limestone karst above the main shaft where machinery was established, and cultural features, such as large mullock heaps. The main shaft area is fenced off for safety reasons.|$|R
25|$|The complex {{features}} extensive {{archaeological evidence}} relating {{to a wide}} range of gold mining and processing activities. The place contains the largest surviving assemblage of early boiler and steam engine power plant recorded in North Queensland. The cyanide plant is amongst the earliest and most intact recorded in North Queensland and the tailings bucket chain and stumps and supports for the vats are now rare remains. The site contains a very rare undertype semi-portable steam engine and winching unit and a 4.5m high vertical boiler which is the largest of this type recorded in North Queensland. The pump shaft contains the only surviving beam <b>pump</b> <b>arm</b> recorded in the Georgetown-Croydon district.|$|R
50|$|Ore tramway {{formations}} extend east, {{and northwest}} of the mine to Harbord battery. The main components of the mine terrace are a concrete collared shaft equipped with a <b>pump</b> <b>arm,</b> and a semi-portable steam engine. The semi-portable is a rare undertype engine equipped with a winding plant base. The winding drums have been removed. The Palmer River Historic Preservation Society has periodically coated the engine with oil to help with preservation. A second portable engine and a flywheel have been pushed {{over the side of}} the terrace. An extensive mullock dump descends down the hill from two shafts that have been stoped out into open cut workings.|$|R
