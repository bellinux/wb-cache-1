40|$|The {{incubation}} of {{the proteins}} C 3 b, B, D and C 3 induces enzymatic activation of B and of C 3. This system of purified components {{was applied to}} the titration of the guinea-pig and human factors D and B in various homologous and heterologous reaction mixtures. On the basis of functional as well as of immunological tests, the D enzymes of both species were found to be related proteins. First, titrations of factor B revealed that both D enzymes activate homologous and heterologous B with comparable efficiency. Secondly, a rabbit <b>anti-D</b> <b>antiserum</b> raised against guinea-pig D was found to form a precipitation line of partial identity with guinea-pig and human D. In contrast to the compatibility between heterologous D and B, heterologous combinations of C 3 b and B were found to be incompatible. This incompatibility was indicated by low titres of D in the presence of heterologous C 3 b and B; in contrast, in the presence of homologous C 3 b and B, the titres of D were up to one hundred-fold higher. The reason for this effect was found to reside in inefficient complex formation between heterologous C 3 b and B. Therefore titrations of D and B should be only performed in the presence of homologous C 3 b and B...|$|E
40|$|The {{characterization}} {{and distribution}} of cells containing the serum thymic factor (FTS) in the thymus of young mice was studied by immunofluorescence using monoclonal anti-FTS antibodies. FTS+ cells were distributed throughout the thymic parenchyma but were more frequent in the medullary region than in the cortex. FTS-containing cells presented a stellate or globular aspect, {{and some of them}} exhibited fluorescent cytoplasmic granules. The epithelial nature of FTS+ cells was confirmed by double-labeling experiments using an <b>anti-</b> keratin <b>antiserum</b> (as an epithelial cell marker). Nevertheless, only a minority of keratin-positive epithelial reticular cells contained FTS. All controls, including the incubation of sections from nonthymic tissues with the anti-FTS antibodies, were negative. Taken together, these results confirm the exclusive localization of FTS-containing cells within the mouse thymus...|$|R
40|$|We {{have raised}} a rabbit {{antiserum}} against a synthetic peptide {{corresponding to the}} cleavage site between beta-lipotropic hormone and the ACTH moieties of murine pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC). After affinity purification, the anti-cleavage site antibody immunoprecipitates POMC from extracts of AtT 20 cells {{but it does not}} immunoprecipitate the ACTH in such extracts {{or any of the other}} products of cleavage of POMC. By contrast, an antiserum raised against pure swine ACTH immunoprecipitates both POMC and ACTH from AtT 20 cell extracts. Using the anti-cleavage site antibody we have shown that all the POMC synthesized during a 15 -min pulse-labeling with [35 S]methionine is cleaved at this site within 1 h. By immunoelectron microscopy we show that approximately 25 - 30 % of peripheral secretory granules in AtT 20 cells can be labeled with the anti-cleavage site antibody while <b>anti-</b> ACTH <b>antiserum</b> labels all these granules. This establishes that at least some POMC is packaged into secretory granules before its proteolytic cleavage...|$|R

We conclude that 60 K is present on the outer surface of vegetative cells and cysts. The protein is similar to the surface protein alpha of Acinetobacter ssp. in molecular weight, reassociation characteristics, and high ratio of acidic to basic amino acids.

As an initial step {{in the study of}} possible genetic mechanisms involved in these changes, we have isolated cDNA clones encoding OrnDCase. To obtain RNA enriched for OrnDCase messenger, mouse myeloma cells that overproduce OrnDCase were selected {{in the presence of the}} OrnDCase inhibitor, difluoromethylornithine. A pBR 322 cDNA library was prepared from poly(A) + RNA isolated from difluoromethylornithine-resistant cells, and the library was probed with [32 P]cDNA representing mRNA sequences from resistant or parental (sensitive) cells. All clones hybridizing preferentially to the resistant cell probe shared nucleotide sequences. A representative clone containing 1. 1 kilobases of cDNA was shown to encode OrnDCase sequences by in vitro translation of hybrid-selected mRNA followed by precipitation of the translation products with <b>anti-</b> OrnDCase <b>antiserum.</b> Using this cDNA clone as a probe, we found that mouse DNA yielded several restriction fragments that react with the OrnDCase cDNA. In the difluoromethylornithine-resistant myeloma cells, one of these DNA segments is amplified and the level of OrnDCase mRNA is greatly increased compared with that in parental plasmacytoma cells. The level of OrnDCase mRNA is also increased in cultured 3 T 3 cells stimulated with serum and in mouse kidneys after administration of androgen, indicating that OrnDCase gene transcription and/or mRNA stability are regulated during cell growth...|$|R

Gel filtration on Sephadex and Ultrogel columns yielded predominantly one component (molecular weight 11, 500 daltons) and also another minor component (molecular weight 15, 800 daltons). Automated amino terminal sequencing showed these proteins to be similar (36 residues) to a recently described human protein, gamma trace, beginning at its eleventh amino terminal residue. The amyloid deposits in all three patients stained with rabbit <b>anti-</b> gamma trace <b>antiserum.</b> Although the function of gamma trace is not known, {{it appears to have}} structural homology with several hormones and has been localized to the brain, pancreas and pituitary.

This stimulation was shown to depend upon the anti-mu activity of the antiserum. In addition, ultracentrifuged anti-mu and F(ab') 2 fragments of anti-mu were shown to be stimulatory. The anti-mu preparation lacked detectable endotoxin contamination and was also shown to stimulate response by two strains (C 57 BL/ 10 ScCr and C 3 H/HeJ) which are unresponsive to the mitogenic effects of endotoxin, while it failed to stimulate a response by cells from a mouse strain (CBA/N) which responds to endotoxin. In addition purified goat anti-mouse gamma, kappa antibodies and rabbit anti-mouse kappa-antib odies stimulated uptake of [3 H]TdR by mouse spleen cells, although to a lesser degree than the anti-mu preparation.

40|$|RPTP mu is a receptor-like protein {{tyrosine}} phosphatase that mediates homophilic cell-cell interactions. Surface {{expression of}} RPTP mu {{is restricted to}} cell-cell contacts and is upregulated with increasing cell density, suggesting a role for RPTP mu in contact-mediated signaling. It was recently reported (Brady-Kalnay, S. M., D. L. Rimm, and N. K. Tonks. 1995. J. Cell Biol. 130 : 977 - 986) that RPTP mu binds directly to cadherin/catenin complexes, and thus may regulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of such complexes. Here we report that this concept needs revision. Through reciprocal precipitations {{using a variety of}} antibodies against RPTP mu, cadherins, and catenins, we show that RPTP mu does not interact with cadherin/catenin complexes, even when assayed under very mild lysis conditions. We find that the <b>anti-</b> RPTP mu <b>antiserum</b> used by others precipitates cadherins in a nonspecific manner independent of RPTP mu. We conclude that, contrary to previous claims, RPTP mu does not interact with cadherin complexes and thus is unlikely to directly regulate cadherin/catenin function...|$|R
40|$|An {{anti-idiotypic}} antiserum {{was raised}} in rabbits to a monoclonal antibody (Fd- 1) with specificity for one (the N epitope) of the two antigenic epitopes found on the ferredoxin (Fd) molecule. The <b>anti-</b> idiotypic <b>antiserum</b> (anti-Fd- 1) was used {{to demonstrate that the}} Fd- 1 idiotype was expressed at significant levels in most anti-Fd antisera raised in B 10. BR mice. Examination of antisera raised in other mouse strains demonstrated that expression of this idiotype mapped to the IgH gene complex and was found in the antisera of all mouse strains examined with the Ig- 1 allotype. When splenocytes from Fd-immune B 10. Br mice were treated with anti-Fd- 1 and transferred to irradiated syngeneic recipients, the adoptive secondary response was significantly higher in animals receiving treated cells as opposed to control animals, which received normal rabbit serum-treated cells. This response produced a net increase in antibody to both determinants, and the relative amount of Fd- 1 idiotype was not significantly altered. Further studies with separated cell populations showed that the overall increase of anti-Fd antibody produced was attributable to the effects of the anti-idiotypic serum on a population(s) of T cells. Treatment of mice with the Fd- 1 monoclonal antibody (which should react with anti- idiotypic cells) had an analogous effect to that of the anti-idiotype, in that mice so treated produced higher concentrations of anti-Fd antibodies when they were immunized and these antibodies exhibited net increases to both determinants. A model is presented to explain these results...|$|R
40|$|Hybridoma {{cell lines}} {{secreting}} antibodies specific to (3 -nitro- 4 - hydroxyphenyl) acetyl (NP) were generated by fusion of NP-immunized SJL spleen cells with the SP 2 / 0 cell line. One hybridoma (N-hybridoma) anti- NP antibody (mu, lambda 2) {{was found to}} partially inhibit (35 - 40 %) the binding of the predominant idiotype in primary C 57 BL/ 6 anti-NP antibodies (NPb). Iodinated hybridoma antibody could be completely bound with anti-idiotypic antiserum made against either specifically purified C 57 BL/ 6 anti-NP antibodies, SJL anti-NP antibodies, or N- hybridoma antibody. The idiotypic specificities defined with <b>anti-</b> idiotypic <b>antiserum</b> made against N-hybridoma antibody were termed NP- 1 idiotype. Strain distribution and genetic mapping studies indicate that the gene(s) controlling the production of NP- 1 idiotype is closely associated with Igh- 1 b and Igh- 1 e alleles and mapped within the same chromosomal segment that controls the synthesis of NPb idiotype. However, unlike NPb idiotype, the expression of NP- 1 idiotype is not influenced by the gene(s) that control lambda 1 chain synthesis. Thus, SJL mice that produce low or undetectable levels of NPb idiotype due to a defect in lambda 1 chain production express high levels of NP- 1 idiotype. Specifically purified C 57 BL/ 6 and SJL anti-NP antibodies fully express NP- 1 idiotype, the level of which correlates {{with the level of}} lambda 2 chain-bearing molecules. Nonetheless, further experiments indicate that lambda 1 -bearing anti-NP antibodies can express extremely weak NP- 1 idiotypic cross-reactivity...|$|R

The rabbit anti-idiotypic antiserum thus produced strongly inhibited the binding of 125 I-GPhe by anti-GPhe antisera produced only in mice of H- 2 q haplotype, and {{had no effect on}} the binding of GPhe by anti-GPhe antisera produced in mice of other haplotypes, namely, H- 2 k and H- 2 p. The anti-idiotypic antiserum also inhibited the binding of GPhe by anti- GPhe-methylated bovine serum albumin antisera produced only in mice of H- 2 q haplotype. No linkage to Ig allotype was observed. The anti-GPhe antisera produced in F 1 mice the anti-idiotypic antiserum demonstrating the dominant presence in these F 1 mice of idiotypic determinants whose expression is dictated by the H- 2 q major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The anti-idiotypic antiserum also inhibited the binding of 125 I- poly) LGlu 56, LLys 35, LPhe 9) and 125 I-GPhe antisera produced only in mice of H- 2 q haplotype. These specificities were also confirmed by the inhibition of the plaque-forming cells. It was concluded that the antibodies produced in mice of H- 2 q haplotype against GPhe and GLPhe share common idiotypic determinants that are recognized by the <b>anti-</b> idiotypic <b>antiserum.</b> A possible explanation for the unique findings that the expression of anti-GPhe idiotypic determinants in mice of H- 2 q haplotype are dictated by the gene product in the MHC is that the macrophages in mice of H- 2 q haplotype present unique determinants of GPhe polymer in the response process to GHphe...|$|R

Polyclonal rabbit antiserum was raised against a 210, 000 -dalton (210 K) membrane protein which was purified from a canine lymphoid tumor by preparative slab gel electrophoresis. Three high MW proteins at 210, 195 and 170 K and a common proteolytic fragment at 95 K were detected in the electrophoretically separated plasma membrane preparations by immunoblotting with polyclonal <b>anti-</b> 210 K <b>antiserum.</b> Two antigenically distinct patterns were evident: 1) Type 1 lymphomas expressed a major 210 K peptide (with or without a minor 195 K component), and 2) Type 2 lymphomas lacked the 210 K form but had a 170 K or 195 K peptide singly or in combination. Immunoperoxidase staining of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections demonstrated that the antigen was localized predominantly to the surface membrane of lymphocytes, and that canine lymphoma cells expressed a greater amount of the antigen than normal lymph node lymphocytes.

40|$|Immunological {{investigation}} {{has revealed that}} a settlement-inducing protein complex (SIPC), which induces cypris settlement of the barnacle Balanus amphitrite, is synthesized during larval development and accumulates in the cypris larva. We previously purified the SIPC from adult B. amphitrite, which was active when bound to a substratum. The SIPC is a glycoprotein of high molecular mass, consisting of three major subunits of 76, 88 and 98 kDa with lentil lectin (LCA) -binding sugar chains. In the present study, we prepared antiserum against each LCA-binding subunit of SIPC, and performed immunoblot analyses. Immunoblotting of adult extracts showed that anti- 76 -kDa antibody reacted only with the 76 -kDa protein, whereas anti- 88 -kDa and anti- 98 -kDa antibodies reacted with both the 88 -kDa and the 98 -kDa proteins. Immunoblotting of larval extracts indicated that reactivity of the 76 -kDa protein to <b>anti-</b> 76 -kDa <b>antiserum</b> increased during larval development and cyprid extracts reacted strongly. Moreover, by using immunostaining {{we found that the}} SIPC was contained in 'footprints' of cyprids, which have been shown to act as a settlement-inducing pheromone, and is secreted onto the antennular attachment discs.

The SJL GAT-TsF specifically eluted from anti-CGAT- immunoadsrobents was shown to still posses I-J determinants. These data provide evidence suggesting a sharing of V region structures between B- cell antibody and T-cell suppressor factor specific for an antigen (GAT) under Ir gene control, in agreement with earlier studies on T and B-cell alloreceptors, T-cell helper factors, and T and B-cell receptors for conventional antigens...|$|R

In immunoblotting studies of electrophoretically separated plasma membranes from five cases of canine lymphoma, the antibody detected two antigenically intact peptides at 95 and 110 K which, based on previous polyclonal <b>anti-</b> 210 K <b>antiserum</b> immunoblotting and peptide mapping studies, may represent the protease-resistant fragment of the canine T 200 molecule. Since DT 200 retains its reactivity in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections, 13 dogs with malignant lymphoma and a panel of normal lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues were studied using an indirect immunoperoxidase technique. The antigen was localized predominantly to the surface membrane of lymphoid cells. DT 200 reacted strongly with all five histological subtypes of lymphoma tested while moderate reactivity was detected in normal B and T cell areas of lymph node, spleen and tonsil. Thymocytes and selected hemopoietic precursors were weakly reactive with DT 200 while plasma cells, mature granulocytes, red cells and megakaryocytes were unstained.

The most prominent of these proteins is a 37 -kDa protein, whose expression correlates with the time course of nerve development, degeneration, and regeneration. We now report that the 37 -kDa protein is apolipoprotein E (apoE). We produced a specific antiserum against the 37 -kDa protein isolated from previously crushed nerves. This antiserum recognizes a 36 -kDa protein in rat serum that we have purified and identified as apoE. The <b>anti-</b> 37 -kDa <b>antiserum</b> also recognizes apoE on electrophoretic transfer blots of authentic samples of high and very low density lipoproteins. The nerve 37 -kDa protein comigrates with apoE by two-dimensional electrophoresis, shares a similar amino acid composition, and reacts with an antiserum against authentic apoE. The purified apoE specifically blocks the immunoprecipitation of [35 S]methionine-labeled 37 -kDa protein synthesized by nonneuronal cells. Thus, {{on the basis of its}} molecular mass, isoelectric point, amino acid composition, and immunological properties, we conclude that the 37 -kDa protein is apoE. We also used light microscopic immunohistochemistry to localize apoE following nerve injury. In rats with optic nerve lesions, the 37 -kDa antiserum bound specifically to the degenerating optic tracts and to the retino-recipient layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus and the superior colliculus.

We report a novel method for diagnosis of pediatric tuberculosis that uses Monoclonal anti 38 -KD immunohistochemistry (IHC) {{to detect the}} 38 - KD antigen on formalin-fixed tissue biopsies. This antigen has not been detected in non-tuberculous mycobacteria. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for amplification of IS 6110 from DNA obtained from the biopsies {{was used as a}} gold standard in this Study. Methodology: Of 718 lymphadenopathy cases, 42 pediatric cases of granulomatous lymphadenitis with histologically suspected tuberculosis obtained from Sudan were evaluated. Z.

The component detected is β 1 C-globulin, a moiety of the third complement component, which has previously been obtained in pure form and to which a specific antiserum has been prepared. It {{has been shown in}} a model system that the binding of β 1 C-globulin as shown by immunofluorescence is strictly equivalent to complement fixation as assessed by standard serological methods. This {{technique has}} been applied to the detection of in vivo bound complement in pathological human tissues. It was found that in vivo complement binding occurs in the lesions of several human diseases, but not elsewhere in the same tissues. In a rather limited survey of diseases that has been carried out, in vivo complement binding was found particularly in systemic L.

The spectrum of in vivo complement binding has been compared with that of γ-globulin binding (7 S and 19 S types) and with the demonstration of in vitro complement fixation and rheumatoid factor fixation. It was distinct from each of these.

40|$|AbstractThe major {{envelope}} antigen of vaccinia virus is an acylated protein of Mr 37, 000 (p 37 K) which {{is required for}} the formation of extracellular enveloped virions (EEV). Despite its important role in the wrapping process, p 37 K has not been studied in much detail. In order to better characterize this protein we have undertaken a detailed biochemical analysis. Sodium carbonate treatment showed that p 37 K is tightly bound to the viral envelope. Its resistance to proteinase K digestion indicates that it is not exposed on the surface of EEV but lines the inner side of the envelope. Since p 37 K does not contain a signal peptide characteristic of most membrane proteins, we examined the possibility that the protein acquires its membrane affinity through the addition of fatty acids. Indeed, Triton X- 114 phase partitioning experiments demonstrated that p 37 K is hydrophobic when acylated, but hydrophilic in the absence of fatty acids. Three other viral proteins {{have been shown to be}} required for virus envelopment and release from the host cell and we therefore tested whether p 37 K interacts with viral proteins. In EEV and in absence of reducing agents, an 80 -kDa complex reacting with an <b>anti-</b> 37 K <b>antiserum</b> was found. Analysis of this complex showed that it most likely consists of a p 37 K homodimer.

40|$|Two {{antisera}} {{were raised}} in goats against material shed by two different mammary epithelial cell lines into serum-free culture medium. These antisera, when added to the medium of intact, growing mouse mammary tumor cells {{in the absence of}} complement, cause distinct and dramatic alterations in cell morphology and adhesiveness. One antiserum (anti-SFM I) causes mouse mammary tumor epithelial cells to round and detach from the substratum. Treatment with the other <b>antiserum</b> (<b>anti-</b> SFM II) does not affect cell-substratum interactions, but causes the cells to convert from an epitheloid to a fibroblastic morphology. Statistical analysis of transmission electron micrographs of control and antibody-treated cells indicates that treatment with anti-SFM II is associated with a substantial reduction in the extent of intercellular junctions, particularly desmosomes. To identify the components with which the two antisera interact, nonionic detergent extracts of mouse mammary tumor cells were fractionated, and the ability of various fractions to block the morphological effects of either antiserum was determined. The whole Nonidet P 40 (NP 40) extract of the epithelial cells blocked the effects of both antisera. After the extract was subjected to ion exchange and lectin affinity chromatography, two separate fractions were obtained. One fraction blocks and anti-SFM I induced rounding and detachment of cells from the substratum. The second fraction blocks the effects of both antisera. The isolation of the former fraction, which has highly restricted number of components, represents a significant first step toward identifying the surface membrane molecule(s) involved in cell-substratum adhesion in epithelial cells...|$|R

Lennarz. 1990. J. Cell Biol. 111 : 2951 - 2959). To characterize the receptor further, we have generated a polyclonal <b>antiserum</b> (<b>anti-</b> 70 KL) against the purified 70 -kD fragment. Anti- 70 KL {{was found to}} react with a single polypeptide of approximately 350 kD on Western blots, presumed to be the intact receptor, in an egg cell surface preparation. This polypeptide appeared to be tightly associated with the plasma membrane/vitelline layer complex, as it was released from these preparations only by detergent treatment. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that the receptor was distributed evenly over the egg surface. The anti- 70 KL was species specific both {{in its ability to}} recognize the egg surface protein and to inhibit sperm binding. Fab fragments generated from affinity-purified anti- 70 KL also bound to the egg surface and inhibited sperm binding in a concentration-dependent manner. Interestingly, treatment with Fabs caused a small percentage of eggs to undergo cortical granule exocytosis, {{even in the absence of}} external Ca 2 +. These results confirm earlier findings indicating that the receptor is a cell surface glycoprotein of high molecular weight that species specifically binds sperm.

Screening of a new cDNA library constructed from polysomal mRNA of HeLa cells with the p 70. 1 clone yielded an overlapping clone, FL 70 K, which was 2. 7 kb long and covered the complete coding and 3 '-untranslated sequence of the 70 K protein in addition to 680 nucleotides upstream of the putative initiation codon, The predicted mol. wt of the encoded protein is approximately 70 kd. Amino acid analysis of the purified HeLa 70 K protein yielded values close or identical to those deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the full-length cDNA. The 70 K protein is rich in arginine (20 %) and acidic amino acids (18 %). Extremely hydrophilic regions containing mixed-charge amino acid clusters have been identified at the carboxyl-terminal half of the protein, which may function in RNA binding. A sequence comparison with two recently cloned RNA binding proteins revealed homology with one region in the U 1 RNP 70 K protein. This domain may also be responsible for RNA binding...|$|R
40|$|Ibuprofen-induced {{interstitial}} nephritis was proposed to be {{a manifestation of}} a disordered cell-mediated immunity. To test the hypothesis that ibuprofen-induced {{interstitial nephritis}} is attributed to a disordered cellular immunity, the highly specific anti-ibuprofen antiserum was developed by injecting rats with the ibuprofen conjugate of keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). Ibuprofen-associated interstitial nephritis was studied by using a rabbit model. Rabbits of uranyl nitrate treatment induced temporary renal failure, {{and the effect of}} chronic ibuprofen regimen was studied. ^ Pathological examinations of the kidney specimens showed marked lymphocytic aggregation in the perivascular area. The infiltrated lymphocytes were confirmed to be T-lymphocytes by using anti-CD 43 antibody. The aggregated T-lymphocytes support that cellular immunity {{may play a role in}} ibuprofen-induced interstitial nephritis. However, no ibuprofen conjugates could be detected by the anti-ibuprofen antibody. The lymphocyte stimulation test (LST), the most effective method to study allergen, showed that ibuprofen stimulated the differentiation of lymphocytes. These studies suggest that disordered cell immunity may play a role in ibuprofen-associated interstitial nephritis. ^ The 2 -arylpropionyl-CoA epimerase (2 -APE) has been purified from rat liver cytosol and mitochondria for the immunological study. The homogeneity of both enzyme preparations was shown by SDS-PAGE with molecular mass of 42 kDa. The 2 -APEs from rat cytosol and mitochondria are immunological related. They may display common epitopes in the native conformation. The tissue distribution using <b>anti-</b> 2 -APE <b>antiserum</b> showed that 42 kDa epimerase could only be detected in the crude exacts from liver and kidney. In addition, the epimerase activity in both rat liver and kidney could be inhibited by the antiserum. ^ The 2 -APE has been partially purified from the cytosol of human liver. The enzyme is an extremely minute component in human liver with an apparent molecular mass of 55 kDa. It has no apparent requirement for exogenous cofactors, but required dithiothreitol to maintain the stability. The human 2 -APE activity could not be neutralized by the antiserum against rat liver 2 -APE, which suggests that the 2 -APEs from human and rat livers are not immunologically related. ...|$|R
40|$|Cells {{of the rat}} {{neuronal}} line, PC 12, adhere well to substrates {{coated with}} laminin and type IV collagen, but attach poorly to fibronectin. Adhesion and neurite extension {{in response to these}} extracellular matrix proteins are inhibited by Fab fragments of an <b>antiserum</b> (<b>anti-</b> ECMR) that recognizes PC 12 cell surface integrin subunits of Mr 120, 000, 140, 000, and 180, 000 (Tomaselli, K. J., C. H. Damsky, and L. F. Reichardt. 1987. J. Cell Biol. 105 : 2347 - 2358). Here we extend our study of integrin structure and function in PC 12 cells using integrin subunit-specific antibodies prepared against synthetic peptides corresponding to the cytoplasmic domains of the human integrin beta 1 and the fibronectin receptor alpha (alpha FN) subunits. Anti-integrin beta 1 immunoprecipitated a 120 -kD beta 1 subunit and two noncovalently associated integrin alpha subunits of 140 and 180 kD from detergent extracts of surface-labeled PC 12 cells. Immunodepletion studies using anti-integrin beta 1 demonstrated that these two putative alpha/beta heterodimers are identical to those recognized by the adhesion- perturbing ECMR antiserum. Anti-alpha FN immunoprecipitated fibronectin receptor heterodimers in human and rat fibroblastic cells, but not in PC 12 cells. Thus, low levels of expression of the integrin alpha FN subunit can explain the poor attachment of PC 12 cells to FN. The PC 12 cell integrins were purified using a combination of lectin and ECMR antibody affinity chromatography. The purified integrins: (a) completely neutralize the ability of the anti-ECMR serum to inhibit PC 12 cell adhesion to laminin and collagen IV; (b) have hydrodynamic properties that are very similar to those of previously characterized integrin alpha/beta heterodimeric receptors for ECM proteins; and (c) can be incorporated into phosphatidylcholine vesicles that then bind specifically to substrates coated with laminin or collagen IV but not fibronectin. Thus, the ligand-binding specificity of the liposomes containing the purified PC 12 integrins closely parallels the substrate- binding preference of intact PC 12 cells. These results demonstrate that mammalian integrins purified from a neuronal cell line can, when incorporated into lipid vesicles, function as receptors for laminin and type IV collagen...|$|R
