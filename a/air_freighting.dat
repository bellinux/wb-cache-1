5000|$|Although it {{was never}} {{intended}} as a complete measure of environmental impact, it has come under attack as an ineffective means of finding the true environmental impact. For example, a DEFRA report in 2005 undertaken by researchers at AEA Technology Environment, entitled The Validity of Food Miles as an Indicator of Sustainable Development, included findings that [...] "the direct environmental, social and economic costs of food transport are over £9 billion each year, and are dominated by congestion." [...] The report also indicates {{that it is not}} only how far the food has travelled but the method of travel {{in all parts of the}} food chain that is important to consider. Many trips by personal cars to shopping centres would have a negative environmental impact compared to transporting a few truckloads to neighbourhood stores that can be easily reached by walking or cycling. More emissions are created by the drive to the supermarket to buy air freighted food than was created by the <b>air</b> <b>freighting</b> in the first place. Also, the positive environmental effects of organic farming may be compromised by increased transportation, unless it is produced by local farms. The Carbon Trust notes that to understand the carbon emissions from food production, all the carbon-emitting processes that occur as a result of getting food from the field to our plates need to be considered, including production, origin, seasonality and home care.|$|E

Their right to determine the rules to which they certify produce, irrespective of whether this is already certified to EU public rules, has been recently re-affirmed {{in the process of}} the revision of EU Organic Regulation. A change in Soil Association rules along these lines may have a significant impact, firstly because UK super-markets have historically favoured that their suppliers certify to Soil Association rules, and secondly because <b>air</b> <b>freighting</b> of organic produce to the UK has increased considerably in recent years.

Although the volume of <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> accounts for only 1. 5 percent of the exports measured in tons, the value of <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> exports amounts to 25 percent of Germany’s external trade. In particular, <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> transport forms an important part of logistic concepts and supply chains of commercial and industrial enterprises for the shipment of high-value and time-sensitive goods. However, only relatively little research has been conducted in air transport with regard to the spatial differentiated generation and distribution of <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> compared to the state of research in passenger transport. The main research objective is to gain advanced insights and a profound understanding of the demand generating determinants and structures of <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> on a regional scale and its distribution patterns in the transportation system. In particular, the paper aims to investigate the generation of the disaggregated industry-specific <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> demand in Germany and its interdependencies with the economic activities on a regional level. Building on these findings, the distribution of the regionally generated <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> is explored by modelling the airport choice behaviour of the <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> forwarders using a discrete choice approach. ...|$|R

Therefore, the paper aims to provide new insights into the <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> demand structures in Germany and its interdependencies with the economic activities on a regional level. Applying the concept of the derived transport demand and taking into consideration international trade theories, the paper starts with an analysis of the <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> affinity and demand of different branches of trade within Germany’s manufacturing sector. Building on these findings, the regional distribution of <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> demand in Germany is investigated.

40|$|Do not move. If {{you must}} move, {{do so with}} caution. If we look for one word around which {{agriculture}} and rural development in ACP countries could revolve in {{the first decades of}} the new millennium, it could be mobility. The mobility of people, the mobility of goods, and the mobility of ideas, knowledge, and capital. Rapid population growth is expected during the early decades. A combination of degradation of agricultural conditions in some areas, increases in scale in agricultural production techniques in others, and the growing attraction of the town and city will encourage, and sometimes, force people to leave their rural lives in their tens of millions. The process is known to experts as internal migration when it happens within a country, or just plain migration when it happens, and is allowed, between countries. The number of people living in rural areas will, in Africa, be overtaken by those living in the city by 2010. This indeed means the end of rural life as we know it today, but it does not necessarily signify a collapse of rural society. It means that rural life will change and could even improve for those who choose to continue there. And as this text is being read mainly by people concerned with rural development, we can accept, can we not, that the city need not become the hell-hole that some predict? After all, at one level, the city seems to work. For the agricultural community, on a material level, it means a market. Now there s a word. The market. Most of today s talk about the future of ACP agriculture is about the market: meshing into it, catching up with it, even conquering it. But the global market may not be all that it, glitteringly, seems to be. The ACP agricultural community would perhaps do well to consider its long-term future against a background of 'Where There is No, or Less, Global Market'. Quite simply, whilst we can see the future trends in population and prospects for new and revived agricultural traditions continuing to raise food production, it is hard to see where the energy will come from to move and manage unfettered free trade as is being promoted today. There are dire predictions about energy prices and about scarcities or breakdowns in energy supply. For developing countries, it will be increasingly difficult to be a player on the world trade stage because of the high costs of energy in transport. Early in the millennium, our bodies of global governance will seek to control energy use, through a mechanism that is known popularly, but not entirely correctly, as the Carbon Police, who will prevent or punish the excessive use of certain fuels. There may be barriers, if not bans, on the <b>air</b> <b>freighting</b> of mangoes and mange-tout peas and countless other products from the South to the niche markets of the North. Whilst our regions in the world, including those of the ACP community, become increasingly interdependent, it seems probable to some that our horizons may be regional and not global. We shall be aware of the world and its diversity of ideas and achievements, including those in agricultural research and practice, and governance, for the way we organise our place in the world is what will actually define the extent to which we can succeed in meeting the challenges of increasing agricultural production. And that comes down to how we communicate. 'Help us. We suffer a lot in Africa. We have no rights as children. We have no food. We have war and illness. We have schools but lack education. We want to study so we can be like you, in Africa.

40|$|M. Com. (Transport Economics) In the past, <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> was {{generally}} {{a by-product of}} passenger orientated airlines {{in the sense that}} excess payload and unsold passenger seats were sold as air cargo space. In recent years, this trend has changed and it is observed that the <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> industry is increasingly becoming an industry in itself. The individual market share of scheduled international <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> operations within the air transport industry is currently approximately 35, 8 %. In South Africa, compared {{to the rest of the}} world, the historical development of <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> has been slower and confined primarily to the one national carrier (South African Airways (SAA)). The purpose of this study is, to firstly, determine the potential for growth in the <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> market within and outside South Africa. Secondly, to isolate and describe the factors within SAA which are sub-optimal and therefore have a negative impact on the development of the full potential of the <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> services of the carrier. The overall conclusion of the study is that the market for <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> within and outside of South Africa can be expanded significantly. This conclusion is dependent on the positioning and equipping of the freight division of SAA independently from passenger services, together with the provision of specialist knowledge and systems required for effective <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> management...|$|R

40|$|Meyer, WilliamMiller, MarkThe {{research}} question this dissertation attempts to answer is whether <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> is {{significantly associated with}} population growth; or the income and employment of people in cities; or green geographic spaces. I hypothesize that air cargo throughput is positively associated with these four variables. After appraising the literature on cities, world cities, and world-city networks, as well as establishing the link between airports and cities, I utilize two methods to test my hypotheses. First, I compare two cities – Detroit and Doha – which initially experienced economic and demographic growth before going on opposite developmental trajectories, using the most different systems design [MDSD]. Second, I employ multiple linear regression to test my hypothesis. The results indicate that 1) <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> has a positive association with green area in cities without seaports; 2) <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> is significantly associated with urban employment in cities with seaports; and 3) <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> results in population growth in cities with seaports. ☐ Keywords: Cities, International Relations, capitalist world-economy, uneven development, global commodity chains, <b>air</b> <b>freight,</b> airports, airport citiesUniversity of Delaware, Department ofPh.

The chapter begins by reviewing {{some of the key}} trends that have shaped and characterised <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> markets during the 1990 s and 2000 s. The impact of air transport market liberalisation is identified as a key determinant of changing carrier behaviour, particularly in relation to network structure organisation. The second major section of the chapter {{examines the}} sources of data available for tracking trends in the <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> sector. The lack of comprehensive datasets detailing the activities of the integrated carriers is discussed. Using the Official Airline Guide (OAG) historical databases that list ex-post carrier schedules for each year globally, annual data series indicating freight capacity of all Asian, European and North American and selected Middle Eastern carriers are determined and the general trends are described. The US T- 100 Database is used to derive an equivalent distribution for the two largest integrated carriers, FedEx and UPS. The changing nature of industry organisation is discussed and the key players in each region are distinguished. For the combination carriers, passenger and freight network structures are compared for the period 1999 - 2009. The fortunes of the key <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> hubs are reviewed over the same period.
