5|$|There is {{considerable}} {{debate about whether}} the Khazzoom-Brookes Postulate is correct, and of {{the relevance of the}} Jevons paradox to energy conservation policy. Most governments, environmentalists and NGOs pursue policies that improve efficiency, holding that it will lower resource consumption and reduce environmental problems. Others, including many environmental economists, doubt this 'efficiency strategy' towards sustainability, <b>and</b> <b>worry</b> that efficiency gains may in fact lead to higher production and consumption. They hold that for resource use to fall, efficiency gains should be coupled with other policies that limit resource use.|$|E

25|$|REM sleep {{physiology}} and somatic symptoms {{coupled with the}} awareness that one is paralyzed, can generate a variety of psychological symptoms during sleep paralysis, including fear <b>and</b> <b>worry</b> that are aggravated by catastrophic cognitions about the attack. This can activate a fight-flight reaction and panic-like arousal. Consequently, when the person attempts to escape the paralysis, somatic symptoms and arousal are exacerbated, as execution of motor programs {{in the absence of}} dampening proprioceptive feedback can lead to heightened sensations of bodily tightness and pressure, and even pain and spasms in limbs.|$|E
25|$|In 1859, Douglas {{also found}} his colony {{embroiled in a}} dispute with Washington Territory over {{sovereignty}} in the San Juan Islands. The protracted, twelve-year standoff {{came to be known}} as the Pig War. Douglas pressed Britain to exert sovereignty over all islands in the archipelago dividing the Strait of Georgia from Puget Sound. Named for the largest island of the group, the San Juan Islands are immediately adjacent to Victoria and so were of great strategic interest <b>and</b> <b>worry.</b> While opposing troops remained garrisoned on San Juan Island, the dispute was eventually settled by arbitration in favour of the United States.|$|E
25|$|At {{the outset}} of the 19th century, the dissenting feminist voices had little to no social influence. There was little sign of change in the {{political}} or social order, nor any evidence of a recognizable women's movement. Collective concerns began to coalesce {{by the end of the}} century, paralleling the emergence of a stiffer social model and code of conduct that Marion Reid described as confining and repressive for women. While the increased emphasis on feminine virtue partly stirred the call for a woman's movement, the tensions that this role caused for women plagued many early-19th-century feminists with doubt <b>and</b> <b>worry,</b> and fueled opposing views.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} how cognitive determinants and emotional determinants, in particular fears <b>and</b> <b>worries,</b> relate to STI testing behaviour. A {{survey was conducted}} online among 906 participants aged 16 to 26 years who completed a digital questionnaire about sexuality, sexual health, STI testing behaviours and cognitive and emotional factors potentially influencing testing behaviours. The cognitive factors were specified by an extended health belief model (HBM) and encompassed perceived risk and severity of STIs, perceived {{pros and cons of}} STI testing, and perceived behavioural control over STI testing behaviour. Emotional factors referred to fears <b>and</b> <b>worries</b> about STIs <b>and</b> STI testing. All cognitive variables of the extended HBM, as well as fears <b>and</b> <b>worries,</b> were found to be univariately associated with STI testing behaviour. In multivariate analysis, perceived behavioural control was found to add to HBM variables. As predicted the relation between fears <b>and</b> <b>worries</b> <b>and</b> STI testing was mediated by cognitive variables, but only the combination of extended HBM variables reduced the association between fears <b>and</b> <b>worries</b> <b>and</b> STI testing behaviour to non-significance; individual cognitive variables did not significantly mediate this association. Results {{of this study suggest that}} emotions influence cognitions in explaining STI testing behaviour. Fears <b>and</b> <b>worries</b> affect threat perception as well as evaluation of the behaviour, suggesting that threat appraisal and coping appraisal are intricately related and may not work in parallel as suggested by classic social cognitive models. Limitations and implications of the study are discussed...|$|R

The detail was led by Lieutenant Cedric Daniels (Lance Reddick) who faced challenges balancing his career aspirations with his desire to produce a good case.

25|$|Many low-grade lymphomas remain {{indolent}} {{for many}} years. Treatment of the nonsymptomatic patient is often avoided. In {{these forms of}} lymphoma, such as follicular lymphoma, watchful waiting is often the initial course of action. This is carried out because the harms and risks of treatment outweigh the benefits. If a low-grade lymphoma is becoming symptomatic, radiotherapy or chemotherapy are the treatments of choice; although they do not cure the lymphoma, they can alleviate the symptoms, particularly painful lymphadenopathy. Patients with these types of lymphoma can live near-normal lifespans, but the disease is incurable. Some centers advocate the use of single agent rituximab {{in the treatment of}} follicular lymphoma rather than the wait and watch approach. Watchful waiting is not a good strategy for all patients, as it leads to significant distress and anxiety in some patients. It has been equated with watch <b>and</b> <b>worry.</b>|$|E

500|$|... "Solitary" [...] is {{the ninth}} {{episode of the}} first season of Lost, an American {{television}} drama series following the survivors of a plane crash stranded on a tropical island. The episode was directed by Greg Yaitanes and written by David Fury. It first aired on November 17, 2004, on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC). Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) is captured by a mysterious French person, who is later revealed to be Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan), a woman who shipwrecked on the island sixteen years before the crash of Oceanic Flight 815 and was alone for almost the entire time. At the island's camp, Hugo [...] "Hurley" [...] Reyes (Jorge Garcia) creates a golf course {{in an attempt to}} relieve the survivors' stress <b>and</b> <b>worry.</b> In flashbacks, Sayid meets a childhood friend, but must interrogate her.|$|E
500|$|Although What You Were Hoping For? was {{acclaimed}} by critics, {{it received}} some backlash from Hunt's fanbase and listeners, who were ambivalent about its stylistic departure from his previous work. He addressed the criticism {{in an interview}} for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: [...] "Other recording artists will supply their fans with an album full of songs they will enjoy for 15 or 20 years. I'm a man that grows, progresses and matures, I want to grow [...] {{with the people who}} want to go with me on that journey ... An artist should put out work that the culture should inspire to as opposed to trying to meet the culture, that's backwards to me.

[...] What You Were Hoping For? peaked at number 19 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers Albums, which is a weekly music chart that ranks top-selling albums by new or developing acts, defined as those who have never appeared in the top 100 of the Billboard 200 or in the top 10 of Billboards component charts.

[...] In his memoirs, one of the guards at the Ipatiev House, Alexander Strekotin, remembered Anastasia as [...] "very friendly and full of fun", while another guard said Anastasia was [...] "a very charming devil! She was mischievous and, I think, rarely tired. She was lively, and was fond of performing comic mimes with the dogs, as though they were performing in a circus." [...] Yet another of the guards, however, called the youngest grand duchess [...] "offensive and a terrorist" [...] and complained that her occasionally provocative comments sometimes caused tension in the ranks. Anastasia and her sisters helped their maid darn stockings and assisted the cook in making bread and other kitchen chores while they were in captivity at the Ipatiev House.|$|E

Like Greggs, partners Thomas [...] "Herc" [...] Hauk (Domenick Lombardozzi) and Ellis Carver (Seth Gilliam) were reassigned to the detail from the narcotics unit. The duo's initially violent nature was eventually subdued as they proved useful in grunt work, and sometimes served as comic relief for the audience.

Though not initially important players in the operation, Freamon proved a quietly capable and methodical investigator with a knack for noticing tiny but important details, and Prez turned out to be a natural at following paper trails and his persistence when dealing with seemingly unbreakable codes paid off eventually.|$|E

[...] Joe later elaborated that once each film's creative team [...] "come up with conceptually what we want to do" [...] for a film, then we will ask questions about whether this would interfere with a storyline in another movie. Or, what's going on in that film, can we pull some of that into this film?
