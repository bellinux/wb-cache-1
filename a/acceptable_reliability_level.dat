40|$|Due to its variability, wind {{generation}} integration {{presents a}} significant challenge to power system operators {{in order to}} maintain adequate <b>reliability</b> <b>levels</b> while ensuring least cost operation. This paper explores the trade-off between the benefits associated to a higher wind penetration and the additional operational reserve requirements that they impose. Such exploration is valued in terms of its effect on power system reliability, measured as an amount of unserved energy. The paper also focuses on how changing the Value of Lost Load (VoLL) can be used to attain different reliability targets, and how wind power penetration and the diversity of the wind energy resource will impact quality of supply (in terms of instances of unserved energy). The evaluation of different penetrations of wind power generation, different wind speed profiles, wind resource diversity, and different operational reserve requirements, is conducted on the Chilean Northern Interconnected System (SING) using statistical modeling of wind speed time series and computer simulation through a 24 -hour ahead unit commitment algorithm and a Monte Carlo simulation scheme. Results for the SING suggest that while wind generation can significantly reduce generation costs, it can also imply higher security costs to reach <b>acceptable</b> <b>reliability</b> <b>levels.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. Student {{evaluations}} of teaching (SET) {{have been the}} principal instrument to elicit students’ opinions in higher education institutions. Many decisions, including high-stake ones, are made based on SET scores reported by students. In this respect, reliability of SET scores is of considerable importance. This paper has an argument {{that there are some}} problems in choosing and using of reliability indices in SET context. Three hypotheses were tested: (i) using internal consistency measures is misleading in SET context since the variability is mainly due to disagreement between students’ ratings, which requires use of inter-rater reliability coefficients, (ii) number of minimum feedbacks is not achieved in most of the classes, resulting unreliable decisions, and (iii) calculating reliability coefficient assuming a common factor structure across all classes is misleading because a common model may not be tenable for all. Results showed that use of internal consistency only to assess reliability of SET scores may result in wrong decisions.

Over the past twenty years, the advancement of technology and the evolvement of computer hardware and software have shifted the needs and expectations of students and faculty in performing their educational duties. Recently, demands among higher educational communities have centered {{on the need for}} increased mobility with regards to technology. In the fall of 2008, a number of schools, namely the University of Maryland, Freed-Hardeman University, and Abilene Christian University, issued mobile hand-held devices to a group of incoming students in an effort to meet the demands for increased mobility in educational technology. With this technology, these institutions aim to enhance the learning environment as well as increase interactions between the students and the faculty. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) attempts to examine user acceptance of new technology by measuring user perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of the newly issued technology.

40|$|Marine {{renewable}} energy promises {{to provide a}} significant contribution to the future electricity supply. It is estimated that 17 % of today's UK electricity demand could be generated from wave and tidal sources. The ambition to harvest this resource is in the public interest, as it eases the pressures on energy security, holds the potential to reduce carbon emissions and has the prospect to create a new UK industry sector worth £ 15 billion. From an engineering perspective, marine energy is one of the least developed {{renewable energy}} technologies and has to be regarded as unproven. The reliability of components and devices in the harsh marine environment {{is one of the main}} engineering challenges. Reliability assessments and the assurance of <b>acceptable</b> <b>reliability</b> <b>levels</b> are dependant on the adequacy of failure information, which is scantily available for marine energy. This thesis shows that large failure rate uncertainties impede the reliability assessment for wave energy converters and how a suite of experimental, numerical and statistical methods can be applied to improve scarcely available reliability information. The analysis of component load conditions identifies fatigue as failure mode of concern and the fatigue life of mooring lines and marine power cables is quantified in a floating wave energy application. A Bayesian statistical approach and dedicated service-simulation component testing is proposed, and implemented to improve the quality of reliability estimates and to provide relevant data and assurance. The methods presented, along with the results, will assist reliability assessment and design during early development stages, and will inform the prediction of maintenance requirements during operation. Reliable marine energy systems will be the technical enabler for the successful transition of prototype devices to a commercially viable marine energy industry.

40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Industrial Psychology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. The Employment Equity Act, 55 of 1998, Section 8 (Government Gazette, 1998) {{provides}} clear {{guidelines for}} psychometric testing in South Africa. Due {{to the cultural}} complexity of the South African population, personality tests in particular do not always comply with these specifications. Most personality tests used in South Africa have been developed in and imported from other countries, and are consequently not always appropriate for all cultural groups. Also, the majority of indigenous personality tests were developed and standardised specifically for the white population. Today a major challenge in personality assessment development is to develop and standardise inventories for the 11 official language groups in South Africa. The objectives {{of this study were}} to develop valid and reliable items for an Intellect–measuring instrument that will form part of a larger personality inventory, to investigate the factor solution of this Intellect cluster, and to compare the factor solutions of the white and African race groups respectively. An Intellect questionnaire consisting of 202 items was developed based on the qualitative phase of the South African Personality Inventory (SAPI). This research served as a pilot study. The sample consisted of (N= 524) students from tertiary institutions in the Gauteng and the North West Provinces of South Africa. A quantitative design with an exploratory approach was used to collect data. Statistical analysis was used to analyse the data. The results indicated that only 18 of the original 202 items proved to be unreliable. <b>Acceptable</b> <b>reliability</b> <b>levels</b> for all facets were found. First–order factor analysis produced two sub–clusters: Aesthetics and Intellect. The Aesthetics sub–cluster consisted of the Artistic, Concrete work and Creative facets, and the Intellect sub–cluster consisted of the Intellect, Knowledgeable, Logical, Self–insight, Articulate, Competent, Enterprising, Perceptive, Social Intellect and Understanding facets. Second–order factor analysis indicated a single–order factor for the Intellect cluster with two second–order factors: Aesthetics and Intellect. Support was found to discard the Musical and Enterprising facets from the Intellect cluster. Similar factor solutions were found for the white and African groups - except for the Musical facet, which loaded on the Aesthetics sub–cluster for the white group and on the Intellect sub–cluster for the African group.

Current practice in off-grid solar house tends to either oversize solar power system or oversize the backup generator to ensure available electricity at all times, which often leads to a high system capital cost. Research has shown that right-sizing is essential to achieve a more efficient system with reduced energy consumption. Sound, responsible system sizing can only happen when liability issues become part of the design methodology, i. e. actively communicating with prospective owners/occupants regarding the risk that the thermal comfort, and full time use of appliances cannot be fully guaranteed. The risk of nonfulfilments may be related to extraordinary environmental conditions for a certain amount of time of the year, the chance that certain components will fail for some reason, and the fact that predictions of the operation of houses are based on design idealizations, whereas its real operation is to some degree uncertain.

The unsteady flow environment {{is characterized by a}} high degree of uncertainty. In addition, geometry variations and material imperfections also cause uncertainties in the design process. Probabilistic design methods consider these uncertainties in order to reach <b>acceptable</b> <b>reliability</b> and safety <b>levels</b> for offshore {{wind turbines}}. Variations of the rotor blade geometry influence the aerodynamic loads which also affect the reliability of other wind turbine components. Therefore, the present paper is dealing with geometric uncertainties of the rotor blades. These can arise from manufacturing tolerances and operational wear of the blades. First, the effect of geometry variations of wind turbine airfoils on the lift and drag coefficients are investigated using a Latin hypercube sampling. Then, the resulting effects on the performance and the blade loads of an offshore wind turbine are analyzed. The variations of the airfoil geometry lead to a significant scatter of the lift and drag coefficients which also affects the damage-equivalent flapwise bending moments. In contrast to that, the effects on the power and the annual energy production are almost negligible with regard to the assumptions made.

40|$|ABSTRACT In current {{conventional}} utility systems, {{fossil fuel}} or {{nuclear power plants}} must back up intermittent renewable electricity generators if the utility grid is to have <b>acceptable</b> <b>reliability.</b> For low <b>levels</b> of intermittent power, this can be achieved without difficulty or added expense. For high levels this reliance on other generators becomes explicit and increasingly expensive, and transmission capacity also becomes an issue. An attractive alternative to the conventional approach is one that relies on bulk or utility scale storage of intermittent electricity to provide system reliability. A comparison of the currently available storage technologies shows that the most cost effective and environmentally acceptable is a {{compressed air energy storage}} (CAES) system and especially its more advanced derivatives (CASH, CAES with Humidification and CAESSI, CAES with Steam Injection). For wind energy systems, both short term and seasonal storage are technically and economically feasible. Background It is increasingly obvious that anthropogenic global climate change must be taken seriously, and that carbon emissions must be reduced drastically if serious harm to the Earth’s biosphere is to be avoided. This certainly will involve dramatically reducing or eliminating the use of carbon based fuels to generate electricity and utilizing nuclear or solar energy systems instead.

The aim of this thesis is to investigate on how Inspection and monitoring can be effectively used to this purpose. To date, an obstacle to the spread of their use is represented by the existing fragmentation of guidelines and standards on structural monitoring and the lack of an international standard universally recognised. In spite of this, main characteristics and classifications of inspection and monitoring systems, together with maintenance topics, are carefully investigated. The idea to regularly inspect most structures and monitor the behaviour of critical parts or of the whole structure to get early warnings may lead to immediate interventions and cost minimisation assuring an <b>acceptable</b> <b>reliability</b> <b>level.</b> A crucial step of the process is the use of newly obtained measurements together with prior information to evaluate the actual structural reliability. This can be done using probabilistic methods or updating partial safety factors on the base of probabilistic considerations. The application of theoretical principles is illustrated by the case study of a stadium roof subjected to high snow load and of the change in use of an office building with an increase of loads. In the first example the results coming from the continuous monitoring of the snow depth on the roof are used to decide about the closure of the stadium whilst, in the second, the influence of destructive tests on specimens and proof load tests on the updating of the resistance of the considered steel beam is investigated...|$|E

The 2 ̆ 2 Religious Orientation Scale 2 ̆ 2 (ROS) and variations of it, including the 2 ̆ 2 Age Universal Intrinsic-Extrinsic Scale- 122 ̆ 2 (AUIES- 12), are the most commonly used measures of religious motivation. But from the initial use of these measures there has been questions concerning their theoretical foundation and scale reliabilities. The purpose of this dissertation was to 1) test the factor structure of the AUIES- 12 and investigate its scale reliabilities; 2) investigate, through CFA, the factor structure of a new measure of religious motivation, the 2 ̆ 2 Measure of Religious Motivation 2 ̆ 2 (MRM), which introduces a fourth factor of religious motivation, Extrinsic-Rules Keeping, to be considered; and 3) test the theory of Extrinsic-Rules Keeping religious motivation by examining the relationship between Extrinsic-Rules Keeping and Stage Two of Fowlers Theory of Faith Development (1981; 1991; 2004), of which the theory of Extrinsic-Rules Keeping was built. The Extrinsic-Rules Keeping factor identifies individuals that use their religion as a set of 2 ̆ 2 celestial rules 2 ̆ 2, by which they are rewarded by God if they obey them and punished if they break them. In the development of the MRM additional items for the Extrinsic-Personal and Extrinsic-Social scales were included, as recommended, to increase scale reliabilities. A sample of 961 participants drawn from an online questionnaire were divided into two randomly split samples. Analyses using both samples indicated that the AUIES- 12 was indeed a three-factor structure. However, as has been the case historically, only the Intrinsic scale held an <b>acceptable</b> <b>reliability</b> <b>level.</b> The MRM was supported through CFA as a four-factor model. The additional items added to the Extrinsic-Personal and Extrinsic-Social scales increased scale reliabilities to acceptable levels. Furthermore, the Extrinsic-Rules Keeping scale was found to have a positive relationship with Stage Two of Fowlers Theory of Faith Development, providing construct validity. The end result of this dissertation was the support for a 27 item measure of religious motivation that is psychometrically sound, theoretically supported, identifies four distinct types of religious motivation, and allows for reliable score and valid inferences from all scales...|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{concerns}} {{have led to}} a rapid increase in renewable energy development and production as the global demand for electricity continues to increase. The intermittent and uncertain nature of electricity generation from renewable sources, such as wind and solar, however, create significant challenges in maintaining power system reliability at reasonable costs. Energy storage and smart-grid technologies are perceived to provide potential solutions to these challenges in modern power systems of different sizes. This work investigates the opportunity to incorporate energy storage in microgrids with renewable energy production, as well as applying smart microgrid management techniques to reduce the lifetime costs while maintaining an acceptable level of reliability. A microgrid consisting of a 5 home community with generation supplied by two propane generators to meet the “N- 1 ” reliability criterion is used as the base case scenario. Actual load data of typical homes is obtained from the industry partner. An equivalent loss of load expectation criterion is used to benchmark the <b>acceptable</b> <b>reliability</b> <b>level.</b> A model is developed to calculate the lifetime operational cost of the base case scenario which is used to assess the benefit of the addition of renewable energy sources, energy storage, and smart microgrid management techniques. A MATLAB program is developed to assess the 20 year operational costs of various combinations of renewable energy sources and battery energy storage, which will be considered the lifetime of the system. The combination of generation and storage which yields the lowest lifetime operational cost is defined as the optimized microgrid, and is used as a basis to determine if additional savings are realized by the implementation of a microgrid operated by a Smart Microgrid Management System (SMMS). The conceptual layout of the proposed SMMS is presented along with identified methods of utilizing in-home thermal storage. The SMMS mechanism is discussed along with proposed functionality, potential methods of employment, and associated development and implementation costs. The microgrid operated by the SMMS is assessed, and its lifetime operational cost is presented and contrasted against the base case microgrid and the optimized microgrid. A power system reliability evaluation of the proposed microgrids are conducted using a probabilistic method to ensure that reliability is not sacrificed by the implementation of a cost-minimized microgrid. A sequential Monte Carlo simulation model is developed to assess the power system reliability of the various microgrid configuration cases. The functionality of this model is verified using an existing reliability assessment program. The results from the presented studies show that the implementation of renewable energy sources, energy storage, and smart microgrid management techniques are an effective way of reducing the operational cost of a remote microgrid while increasing its power system reliability. ...|$|E

Achieving <b>acceptable</b> quality and <b>reliability</b> <b>levels</b> for these complex products {{is one of the most}} critical issues that need to be faced. Testability is therefore a key factor that could limit these trends if not addressed adequately. At these levels of complexity external testing is becoming infeasible due to ATPG limitations. At the same time, the scan approach is losing interest due to the increasing length of scan chains (and thus test length), and low test application speed. At-speed test is a major limitation at a context where increasing clock frequencies (moving quickly to the multi-GHz domain), are making timing faults predominant. Automatic Test Equipment (ATE) is another important limitation, since, although its very high cost, it does not offer the memory capacities/depth and test application speed required for testing present day ICs. Under these constraints, the only realistic issue is to extend the BIST practice beyond memory testing. This requires new developments on logic BIST for increasing fault coverage while containing hardware cost. Furthermore, new developments on fault modeling, fault simulation, and ATPG tools are needed to encounter for timing faults, cross talk, ground bounce and other spurious faults.

40|$|Graduation date: 1980 An {{individualized}} beginning construction course, CT 225, {{was developed}} to accommodate students entering the clothing course sequences with varying amounts of knowledge and skill {{in the area of}} construction. The faculty in the Clothing, Textiles & Related Arts Department at Oregon State University wanted to determine new students' skills and knowledge in the area of construction and give credit to the students who had already mastered the basics through other experiences. To accomplish this a diagnostic test was needed which would assess knowledge of the material covered in the seven modules or units of CT 225. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop such a test to be used both as diagnostic and summative tests for the course. The CT 225 tests were developed for the course. Then, more specific objectives were written based on the general ones. Next, tables of specifications were written for each of the seven modules which identified the course content and the learning outcomes expected for the students. The test items were written. Then the behavioral objectives for the course, the tables of specifications, and the test items were given to two panels of judges who judged the questions for content validity, ambiguity, and correct course content. The test items were revised using the judges' comments as guidelines. The two revised forms of the diagnostic test were administered to students enrolled in CT 225 Winter term, 1980, at Oregon State University. Statistical analysis was done and results were compiled. Both Forms A and B of the CT 225 diagnostic test were found to be comparable in three of the four following areas: discrimination power, difficulty level, distracter effectiveness, and reliability. Difficulty levels of the two tests differed. Test B was somewhat more difficult than Test A. The reliability coefficients for both diagnostic Tests A and B were very satisfactory. The tests are comparable in this respect. The reliability of the diagnostic tests, subdivided into module tests, decreased when item analysis was run on the individual module tests. Tests for modules one and six, Form A, were in the acceptable reliability range; the same was true for module tests one and four of Form B. All the other module tests, Forms A and B, fell below the <b>acceptable</b> <b>reliability</b> <b>level</b> when analyzed as individual tests. When the tests were subdivided into module tests and the statistics run for each part, different results appeared. More of the test items in both Tests A and B were found to discriminate. The two forms of the test were still comparable, but more test items discriminated correctly between the low scoring and high scoring groups. Validity for both the whole and module tests was deemed acceptable. Both sets of judges found the tests to measure what the objectives stated. The tests covered the behavioral objectives thoroughly and the clothing and textile content was found to be accurate...|$|E

30|$|The {{proposed}} {{model was}} solved using pre-emptive goal programming approach. This {{enabled us to}} determine the bounds for the objective functions. We considered the technicians’ earned-valued goal as being a higher priority than the technicians’ reliability goal. However, some organisations may consider the technicians’ reliability goal as being a higher priority than the technicians’ earned-valued goal. To address priority determination, priority scored performance measurement can be used (Tarokh and Nazemi 2006). The minimum value of the expected reliability of the total scheduled technicians was 85  %. During the testing of the proposed model, the minimum <b>acceptable</b> <b>reliability</b> of the technicians was 60  %.

40|$|Background: The Perceived Stress Scale 10 item (PSS- 10) {{has been}} {{translated}} into more than 20 languages and used widely in different populations. Yet, to date, no study has tested {{psychometric properties of the}} instrument among older women and there is no Vietnamese version of the instrument. Methods: This study translated the PSS- 10 into Vietnamese and assessed Vietnamese version of the Perceived Stress Scale 10 items (V-PSS- 10) for translation equivalence, face validity, construct validity, correlations, internal consistency reliability, and test-retest reliability among 473 women aged 60 and over. Results: The study found that V-PSS- 10 retained the original meaning and was understood by Vietnamese older women. An exploratory factor analysis of the V-PSS- 10 yielded a two-factor structure, and these two factors were significantly correlated (0. 56, p[*]<[*]. 01) with all item loadings exceeded. 50. The V-PSS- 10 score was positively correlated with general sleep disturbance (ρ[*]=[*]. 12, p[*]<[*]. 05), CES-D score for depression symptoms (ρ[*]=[*]. 60, p[*]<[*]. 01), and negatively correlated with mental (ρ[*]=[*]−. 46, p[*]<[*]. 01), and physical health scores (ρ[*]=[*]−. 19, p[*]<[*]. 01). The Cronbach’s alpha for the V-PSS- 10 was. 80, and the test-retest correlation at one month’s interval was. 43. Conclusion: Findings from this study suggest that the V-PSS- 10 has <b>acceptable</b> validity and <b>reliability</b> <b>levels</b> among older women. The V-PSS- 10 can be used to measure perceived stress in future research and practice. However, future research would be useful to further endorse the validity and reliability of the V-PSS- 10.
