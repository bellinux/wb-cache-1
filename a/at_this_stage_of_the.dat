5|$|Braithwaite had {{a further}} period {{in command of}} the {{division}} while Russell was on sick leave in late October and in early December led his brigade in attacks on Polderhoek Chateau. The brigade suffered heavy losses and the attack was regarded as a failure. <b>At</b> <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, Braithwaite was one of the longest serving brigade commanders of the NZEF. Worn down by stresses of command, his health was so poor it forced his evacuation to England.|$|E

5|$|The HVO, {{supported}} by Croatian Army artillery deployed {{north of the}} river, managed to withstand the offensive and the front line remained unchanged from the commencement of the battle. This demonstrated the changed balance of power <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war. At the commencement of the war, the VRS had greater military capabilities than its opponents, particularly in terms of heavy weapons and organisation, but over three years from mid-1992 its capabilities had been matched by its adversaries.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, Braithwaite, {{a popular}} commander, was {{temporarily}} {{in charge of}} the division while Russell was on leave. The last of the brigade commanders who had embarked with the NZEF in 1914, he was worn out and in January was evacuated to England for treatment. On recovery, Braithwaite rejoined his original British Army regiment rather than returning to the division. There were rumours amongst the soldiers of the division that this was a punishment for his refusal to carry on with the 12 October attack at Passchendaele.|$|E
5|$|Austrian {{troops were}} also promised, to be {{dispatched}} from the Austrian Army fighting the French in Northern Italy. These troops could only reach Toulon by sea, scheduled to embark {{from the city}} port of Genoa, capital of the Italian state of the Republic of Genoa, which <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war was officially neutral. Genoa was however, in common with other Northern Italian cities, {{in a state of}} political upheaval. The French Revolution had inspired similarly-minded revolutionaries in Italy to support Republican ideas, and there was a substantial Republican faction in the Genoese government which supported France's cause. Food supplies were regularly shipped from Genoa to the Republican armies in Southern France, and the demands of Francis Drake, Ambassador to Genoa, that this trade cease went unheeded.|$|E

5|$|In the FA Cup, Rovers {{have reached}} the quarter-final stage on three occasions. The first time was in 1950–51 when they faced Newcastle United at St James' Park {{in front of a}} crowd of 62,787, the record for the highest {{attendance}} at any Bristol Rovers match. The second time they reached the quarter final was in 1957–58, when they lost to Fulham, and the most recent appearance <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> competition was during the 2007–08 season, when they faced West Bromwich Albion.

5|$|Starting {{as a basic}} L-shaped tower {{built from}} tooled ashlar dressed rubble, the castle was {{extended}} in a southerly direction {{by the addition of}} a circular tower during the first alterations in the late 16th century.

Access on the west side was gained through a narrow round-headed entrance and a wider main doorway was incorporated in the south elevation.|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} the case did not damage Laforey's career: his junior {{officers}} were promoted after the action and he was given command of the larger frigate HMS Aimable. He went on to serve at the Battle of Trafalgar and become a full admiral {{before his death in}} 1835. However, historian Tom Wareham has speculated that the legal case was probably the reason that Laforey was denied the knighthood that customarily accompanied a successful frigate action <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war. More than five decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the Naval General Service Medal, awarded upon application to all British participants from Carysfort still living in 1847.|$|E

5|$|<b>At</b> <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, the 2nd New Zealand Division was {{fighting}} in Italy {{as part of}} the British Eighth Army with the 5th Brigade poised to attack across the Sangro River in central Italy. On his arrival, Kippenberger conducted a survey of the terrain and recommended to Freyberg that the attack plan be modified to include an additional brigade, a recommendation Freyberg concurred with. The reorganised attack was successfully executed on the evening of 28 November with light casualties. The 2nd Division then attempted three times to capture the town of Orsogna. The second attack on the town of 7 December was the first to involve the 5th Brigade. Despite Kippenberger's brigade achieving all its objectives on the flank of the town, the attack was not successful. The failure of another brigade, tasked with capture of Orsogna itself, to achieve its goals left elements of the 5th Brigade exposed, and it had to partially withdraw.|$|E
5|$|In September 1944, Cole handed NWA over to Air Commodore Alan Charlesworth. <b>At</b> <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, the Allies were {{advancing}} {{north and}} the tempo of operations in the Darwin area had decreased. Charlesworth raised concerns regarding No.80 Wing, warning higher command that its morale would drop {{if it was not}} either given {{a more active role in}} the war or transferred to southern Australia for rest. By October, the wing had received orders to depart NWA for Morotai to join the First Tactical Air Force; this left NWA with twelve squadrons at its disposal, including one Liberator unit and three other Spitfire squadrons. In the meantime, NWA supported the assault on Leyte with attacks on enemy ports, oil facilities, and shipping in the Dutch East Indies using Beaufighters, Mitchells, and Liberators. These operations continued through November and December. By then, NWA headquarters staff numbered 651, including 156 officers.|$|E
5|$|In the east, the North Koreans {{advanced}} {{immediately after}} taking Taejon. Four North Korean divisions split up {{and approached the}} UN lines along separate routes. The NK 15th Division {{was the first to}} move against the US 25th Infantry in the Battle of Sangju on July 20, where the division's US 24th Infantry would be quickly pushed back by the North Korean advance. In the meantime, the NK 3rd Division engaged the newly arrived US 1st Cavalry at the Battle of Yongdong on July 22, where that division would also perform poorly. The NK 6th Division moved further south, where it would confront the US 29th Infantry Regiment at the Hadong Ambush on July 27, effectively destroying one of the regiment's battalions. The US units were performing extremely poorly in their first engagements against North Korean units, as a combination of shortages of supplies and lack of experienced soldiers and officers plagued the UN forces <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war.|$|E

5|$|Villaret in Montagne, having {{successfully}} broken {{contact with}} the British flagship and slipped away to the north, managed to gather 11ships of the line around him and formed them up in a reconstituted battle squadron. At 11:30, with the main action drawing to a close, he began a recovery manoeuvre intended to lessen the tactical defeat his fleet had suffered. Aiming his new squadron at the battered Queen, Villaret's attack created consternation in the British fleet, which was unprepared for a second engagement. However, discerning Villaret's intention, Howe also pulled his ships {{together to create a}} new force. His reformed squadron consisted of Queen Charlotte, Royal Sovereign, Valiant, Leviathan, Barfleur, and Thunderer. Howe deployed this squadron in defence of Queen, and the two short lines engaged one another at a distance before Villaret abandoned his manoeuvre and hauled off to collect several of his own dismasted ships that were endeavouring to escape British pursuit. Villaret was subsequently joined by the battered Terrible, which sailed straight through the dispersed British fleet to reach the French lines, and he also recovered the dismasted Scipion, Mucius, Jemmappes, and Républicain—all of which lay within reach of the unengaged British ships—before turning eastwards towards France. <b>At</b> <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battle, Howe retired below and the British consolidation was left to his Captain of the Fleet, Sir Roger Curtis. Curtis was subsequently blamed by some in the Navy for not capturing more of the dismasted French ships, and was also accused of dissuading Howe from attempting further pursuit.|$|E
