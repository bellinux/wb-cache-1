30|$|To {{understand}} {{the patterns of}} writing a bestselling book, we need to explore the careers of individual <b>authors.</b> <b>In</b> this section we ask if it is more common for authors to reach bestseller status with their first book, or if bestselling status is something built up through the increasing popularity of multiple books. To address this question, we focused on bestselling authors who started publishing in 2008 and after, a cohort of 145 <b>authors</b> <b>in</b> fiction and 591 <b>authors</b> <b>in</b> nonfiction.|$|R

5|$|Although the Coris were {{discouraged}} from working together at Roswell, {{they continued to}} do so, specializing in investigating carbohydrate metabolism. They were particularly interested in how glucose is metabolized {{in the human body}} and the hormones that regulate this process. They published fifty papers while at Roswell, with first author status going to the one who had done most of the research for a given paper. Gerty Cori published eleven articles as the sole <b>author.</b> <b>In</b> 1929, they proposed the theoretical cycle that later won them the Nobel Prize, the Cori cycle.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Murrill {{described}} the variety flaviceps from collections made growing on magnolia wood in Gainesville, Florida. Although he originally {{described it as}} a new species, Volvaria flaviceps, Robert Shaffer considered it a variety of V.bombycina. Variety microspora was first described in 1953, was later (1961) named by R.W.G. Dennis; variety palmicola was originally described as a distinct species Volvaria palmicola by Belgian mycologist Maurice Beely in 1928, and later as a variety of V.bombycina by the same <b>author</b> <b>in</b> 1937.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, Nixon {{published}} his memoirs, RN: The Memoirs of Richard Nixon, {{the first of}} ten books he was to <b>author</b> <b>in</b> his retirement. The book was a bestseller and attracted a generally positive critical response. Nixon visited the White House in 1979, invited by Carter for the state dinner for Chinese Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping. Carter had not wanted to invite Nixon, but Deng had stated he would visit Nixon in California if the former president was not invited. Nixon had a private meeting with Deng and visited Beijing again in mid-1979.|$|E
30|$|For the AF alternate-relaying protocols, the <b>authors</b> <b>in</b> [8] propose {{successive}} decoding at {{the destination}} with partial cancellation of inter-relay interference. The <b>authors</b> <b>in</b> [9] introduce inter-relay self-interference cancellation, where the cancellation is performed {{at one of}} the relays; however, the detection process at the destination requires high computational complexity. The <b>authors</b> <b>in</b> [10] propose a full inter-relay interference algorithm, where the cancellation is performed at the destination in a simple manner; however, the noise accumulation associated with the algorithm limits the overall system performance.|$|R
40|$|The {{prolific}} <b>authors</b> identified <b>in</b> {{this study}} are truly remarkable: 332 prolific <b>authors</b> <b>in</b> seven leading finance journals, 350 prolific <b>authors</b> <b>in</b> sixteen core finance journals, and 367 prolific <b>authors</b> <b>in</b> all of the 72 finance journals examined. These authors demonstrate great durability in navigating the vagaries of referees {{and the demands of}} editors. They represent a small minority of thousands of authors during the half century 1953 to 2002. Besides satisfying a natural curiosity of who the prolific authors are, examination of extreme performance provides perspective on research productivity in finance, as do the reported distributional statistics. The findings help in the formation of realistic expectations about scholarly work...|$|R

5|$|In the 1840s, {{a serial}} format {{known as the}} roman-feuilleton was highly popular in France, and the most {{acclaimed}} expression of it was the socialist writing of Eugène Sue. Balzac wanted to challenge Sue's supremacy, and prove himself the most capable feuilleton <b>author</b> <b>in</b> France. Writing quickly and with intense focus, Balzac produced La Cousine Bette, one of his longest novels, in two months. It was published in Le Constitutionnel {{at the end of}} 1846, then collected with a companion work, Le Cousin Pons, the following year.|$|E

5|$|Riley {{became a}} bestselling <b>author</b> <b>in</b> the 1890s. His children's poems were {{compiled}} {{into a book}} and illustrated by Howard Chandler Christy. Titled the Rhymes of Childhood, the book was his most popular and sold millions of copies. As a poet, Riley achieved an uncommon level of fame during his own lifetime. He was honored with annual Riley Day celebrations around the United States and was regularly called on to perform readings at national civic events. He continued to write and hold occasional poetry readings until a stroke paralyzed his right arm in 1910.|$|E
5|$|Sir Hugh Seymour Walpole, CBE (13 March 18841 June 1941) was an English novelist. He {{was the son}} of an Anglican clergyman, {{intended}} for a career in the church but drawn instead to writing. Among those who encouraged him were the authors Henry James and Arnold Bennett. His skill at scene-setting and vivid plots, as well as his high profile as a lecturer, brought him a large readership in the United Kingdom and North America. He was a best-selling <b>author</b> <b>in</b> the 1920s and 1930s but has been largely neglected since his death.|$|E

5|$|Wallace was a {{prolific}} <b>author.</b> <b>In</b> 2002, a historian of science published a quantitative analysis of Wallace's publications. He found that Wallace had published 22 full-length books {{and at least}} 747 shorter pieces, 508 of which were scientific papers (191 of them published in Nature). He further broke down the 747 short pieces by their primary subjects as follows. 29% were on biogeography and natural history, 27% were on evolutionary theory, 25% were social commentary, 12% were on Anthropology, and 7% were on spiritualism and phrenology. An online bibliography of Wallace's writings has more than 750 entries.|$|E
5|$|Executive {{advancement}} in 2049 {{is not based}} on merit or politics alone, rather executives can issue challenges to each other which are held on highways emptied of cars and usually fought to the death, in a fashion similar to Mad Max, a source cited as inspiration by the <b>author</b> <b>in</b> the acknowledgements of the book. Chris Faulkner gains recognition and small celebrity for a particularly brutal win over a much older and more seasoned member of his firm, from which he is head-hunted by Shorn to join their team. Within the media landscape, business executives have fame on the order of sports stars or movie actors and their driving duels are analysed and covered as sporting events. Chris' wife Carla is also his mechanic, a vital role where an executive's car is the difference between promotion and death. She is not a fan of the way he makes his living, but they have an initially strong relationship.|$|E

His first ever published work as a historian was a French-language tome, Le Rôle diplomatique des phanariotes de 1700 à 1821 ("The Diplomatic Role of Phanariotes from 1700 to 1821"). Signed Jean C. Filitti, it was probably his Licence ès Lettres, and, although receiving good reviews, was never listed by its <b>author</b> <b>in</b> his official résumés. He became a Doctor of Law in 1904, when he published the first draft of his study about Regulamentul Organic as the first ever Romanian constitution.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Pinkett Smith portrayed Alex Fisher, {{a lesbian}} <b>author,</b> <b>in</b> The Women. Pinkett Smith's directorial debut was The Human Contract; she also wrote and acted in the movie.

In September 2011, the show was cancelled by TNT, after three seasons. In spring 2012, Pinkett Smith launched a web series entitled Red Table Talks, with the first episode featuring her daughter and her mother, in order to encourage dialogue within families. Beginning in 2014, she starred in the first season of the Fox's crime drama Gotham as Gotham City gangster Fish Mooney. In 2016, she reprised her role as Mooney in many episodes of Gotham`s second and third seasons.|$|E
5|$|West's {{arguments}} {{have been}} highly influential, but other scholars {{have arrived at}} different conclusions using the same evidence. Fowler thinks that the Sicyon genealogy would more likely reflect a composition before Cleisthenes' death (c.575 BCE) and dates the poem to the period closely following the First Sacred War (595–585 BCE), connecting its content to the growing influence of the Amphictyonic League and placing its <b>author</b> <b>in</b> Aeolian Thessaly because of the Aeolid family-trees centered around that region which dominate the earlier portions of the poem. Hirschberger, on the other hand, takes this focus upon the Aeolids and the Catalogue poet's perceived interest in eastern peoples to be indicative of a poet from Aeolis in Asia Minor; she proposes that the Catalogue was composed there between 630 and 590 BCE, viewing {{the composition of the}} Shield of Heracles and an apparent allusion to the poem by Stesichorus (died c.555 BCE) as providing the ultimate terminus ante quem.|$|E
