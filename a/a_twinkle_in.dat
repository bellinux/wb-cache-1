500|$|As a batsman, Leyland {{generally}} {{batted in}} the middle order or occasionally opened the batting. Early in his career, commentators suggested that his batting technique was faulty, {{even when he was}} statistically successful. His use of the cut shot was mistrusted by some Yorkshire critics, and they suspected that his preference for attacking play would be unsuccessful; he was a faster scorer and more aggressive batsman than most of his Yorkshire contemporaries. Cardus suggested that, instead, he was in the line of [...] "humorous Yorkshiremen which the broad nature of his county produces from time to time as a contrast to and leavening of the generally dour lump. There was <b>a</b> <b>twinkle</b> <b>in</b> his eye and there was <b>a</b> <b>twinkle</b> <b>in</b> his bat, no matter how grimly and straight it may occasionally be obliged to defend a difficult situation in Yorkshire." [...] The cricket writer E. W. Swanton observed that Leyland's bat was often not straight when he played his shots—contrary to orthodox technique—but the speed of his footwork and his ability to watch the ball closely made up for any lapses. Opposing bowlers suggested that the impression was an illusion and that his bat was straight when he hit the ball.|$|E
500|$|King Edward died in 1910, and the First World War began {{four years}} after his death. Helena devoted her time to nursing, and her daughter, Princess Marie Louise, {{recorded}} in her memoirs that requests for news of loved ones reached Helena and her sisters. It was decided that the letters should be forwarded to Crown Princess Margaret of Sweden, as Sweden was neutral during the war. It was during the war that Helena and Christian celebrated their golden wedding anniversary in 1916, {{and despite the fact}} that Britain and Germany were at war, the Kaiser sent a congratulatory telegram to his aunt and uncle through the Crown Princess of Sweden. King George V and Queen Mary were present when the telegram was received, and the King remarked to Helena's daughter, Marie Louise, that her former husband, Prince Aribert of Anhalt, did her a service when he turned her out. When Marie Louise said she would have run away to Britain if she was still married, the King said, [...] "with <b>a</b> <b>twinkle</b> <b>in</b> his eye", that he would have had to intern her.|$|E

500|$|In 1996, Woody Harrelson was {{attached}} to the film to play Ron Woodroof, but left the film because of financing issues. In 2002, Brad Pitt {{was attached}} to play the lead role. In June 2008, Ryan Gosling was in talks to join the film for the lead role to play Woodroof, but couldn't take the role. In 2009, producer Brenner sent the script to actor Matthew McConaughey and got him involved to star in the film. Wondering whether the Texas native was interested in playing another Texas native (he's originally from Uvalde), Brenner says that he asked himself: Who is Ron Woodroof?' And in my mind, it was Matthew. Like Ron, he's from Dallas, he's handsome, and he has <b>a</b> <b>twinkle</b> <b>in</b> the eye. Matthew also has intensity and intelligence like Ron did, mixed with that cowboy charisma and fighter's spirit. He was beyond perfect for the role." [...] Writer Borten said: [...] "Ron was a very charismatic, funny and persuasive, a real salesman. Even if he was making fun of you, you wanted him to continue because he was so charming. Matthew possesses a lot of those same qualities." [...] On March 9, 2011, Los Angeles Times confirmed that McConaughey would star in the film as Woodroof and quoted McConaughey as saying: [...] "It's a great script and a great story. And I think it can be a great movie." [...] Woodroof's sister Sharon Woodroof Braden was reportedly pleased with the casting of McConaughey as Woodroof because he had a similar swagger and personality. She had shown concern earlier in the development process when Pitt and Gosling were attached, due to their personalities not matching Woodroof's.|$|E

2500|$|The BBC often {{played down}} his {{comments}} as ultimately {{not having the}} weight they were ascribed. In 2007 they described Clarkson as [...] "Not a man given to considered opinion", {{and in response to}} an official complaint another BBC spokeswoman once said: [...] "Jeremy's colourful comments are always entertaining, but they are his own comments and not those of the BBC.

2500|$|Despite his pacifist upbringing, {{as a young}} freedom fighter, Wali Khan seemed exasperated {{with the}} pacifism {{advocated}} by his father. He was to later explain his frustration to Gandhi, in a story he told Muklaika Bannerjee, [...] "If the cook comes to slaughter this chicken's baby, is non-violence {{on the part of}} the chicken likely to save the younger life?" [...] The story ended with <b>a</b> <b>twinkle</b> <b>in</b> his eye when he remembered Gandhiji's reply, [...] "Wali, you seem to have done more research on violence than I have on non-violence." [...] His first wife died in 1949 while Wali Khan was in prison. In 1954, he married Nasim Wali Khan, the daughter of an old Khudai Khidmatgar activist.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a review}} for Rolling Stone {{following}} Harrison's death in November 2001, Greg Kot said of Thirty Three & ⅓: [...] "'Crackerbox Palace' has <b>a</b> <b>twinkle</b> <b>in</b> its eye, {{the kind of}} song that had previously eluded the increasingly self-serious Harrison... The tune's melodic sweep is nearly matched by 'This Song'... The two tracks form {{the center of the}} guitarist's strongest collection since his solo debut." [...] Having interviewed Harrison for Guitar World magazine in 1987, Rip Rense praised the solos on tracks such as [...] "Learning How to Love You" [...] and [...] "Beautiful Girl", while opining of Harrison's [...] "underrated solo [...] ": [...] "his work is my choice for best among the ex-Fabs for being the most substantial in melody, structure, and content. Thirty-Three and a Third, for instance, might yet be hailed as a minor masterpiece..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Erickson was an irrepressible {{practical}} joker, {{and it was}} {{not uncommon}} for him to slip indirect suggestions into all kinds of situations, including in his own books, papers, lectures and seminars. For example, a student arrived at one of the five-day intensive seminars he held in his home office {{near the end of his}} life. When Erickson asked why she had come, she replied frankly: [...] "My teacher told me that I should come to see you before you died." [...] Erickson smiled and said: [...] "You tell him that dying is the last thing I intend to do." [...] The group laughed at the pun. Then Erickson said, with <b>a</b> <b>twinkle</b> <b>in</b> his eye, [...] "Do you want to know how to avoid dying? Always wake up every morning.

2500|$|In {{a spring}} 2014 {{interview}} with the BBC about the then forthcoming reissue of Led Zeppelin's first three albums, Page said he was confident fans would be keen on another reunion show, but Plant later replied that [...] "the chances of it happening [...] zero." [...] Page then told The New York Times that he was [...] "fed up" [...] with Plant's refusal to play, stating [...] "I was told last year that Robert Plant said he is doing nothing in 2014, and what do the other two guys think? Well, he knows what the other guys think. Everyone would love to play more concerts for the band. He's just playing games, and I'm fed up with it, {{to be honest with}} you. I don't sing, so I can't do much about it", adding, [...] "I definitely want to play live. Because, you know, I've still got <b>a</b> <b>twinkle</b> <b>in</b> my eye. I can still play.

2500|$|In {{the wake}} {{of the success of the}} Daly, Benson and Asche productions, the play began to be {{performed}} with much more frequency all over the world. A celebrated early twentieth-century Katherina was Margaret Anglin, who first performed the role in 1908 in Her Majesty's Theatre, Melbourne. Acting opposite Henry Kolker in a production she herself directed, Anglin is generally regarded as the first actress to have performed Katherina's final speech in an ironic manner. The play was a huge success in Australia, and in 1914, Anglin brought it on tour to New York. Of the last scene, Anglin wrote [...] "when I run gaily in to do my lord's bidding in the last act, I do it with <b>a</b> <b>twinkle</b> <b>in</b> my eye. I don't play it as Shakespeare wrote that last scene." [...] In a 1909 Max Reinhardt directed production at the Deutsches Theater in Berlin, starring Lucie Höflich and Albert Bassermann, the Induction was emphasised and the play was presented as a commedia dell'arte style farce, to the point of the male leads literally wearing clown costumes.|$|E
2500|$|... “There were a {{great many}} cowboys with the show. [...] There was a chief of the cowboys who had general {{supervision}} over both horses and men. [...] When an unbroken horse would be brought in, this cowboy chief would give it to an Indian to ride bareback. [...] After the animal was well broken, it would {{be taken away from}} the Indian and given to a cowboy to ride. [...] Then the Indian would be given another unbroken horse. [...] For a while we said nothing about it, but finally it began to be just a little too much to stand. [...] One day one of the Indians came to me just before it was time to enter the arena. [...] His horse was saddled and bridled, but he was leading the horse by the bridle. [...] I asked him what was the matter, and {{he said it was a}} wild horse and he was not going to ride it into the arena. [...] I went to the chief cowboy and said, ‘I do not think you are doing right. [...] You know our Indian boys have to ride bareback, but you always give them the wild horses to ride. [...] Then, when they have the horse nicely broken, you give to a cowboy. [...] Why don’t you give the wild horses to the cowboys to break in? [...] They ride on saddles, and it would not be so hard for them.’ [...] But the chief cowboy only said, “Well, I can’t be bothered by a little thing like that. [...] You will have to see Buffalo Bill about the horses.’ [...] But I retorted, “You know very well that Buffalo Bill does not know what you do with the horses. [...] He does not know that you give the wild ones to the Indian boys to ride until they are broken in. [...] Give that horse back to that Indian boy or he will not go into the arena today.’ [...] That was all, but the boy got his horse in time to enter the arena with the others. [...] Just as I was ready to go back to the Indians, I looked at Buffalo Bill, and he had <b>a</b> <b>twinkle</b> <b>in</b> his eye. [...] After that, we had no more trouble with the horses. [...] Although Buffalo Bill never said anything to me, I knew he had fixed things to our satisfaction.” ...|$|E
