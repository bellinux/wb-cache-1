5|$|According to Renaissance accounts, gigantic, {{triangular}} fossil teeth {{often found}} embedded in rocky formations were once {{believed to be}} the petrified tongues, or glossopetrae, of dragons and snakes. This interpretation was corrected in 1667 by Danish naturalist Nicolas Steno, who recognized them as shark teeth, and famously produced a depiction of a shark's head bearing such teeth. He described his findings in the book The Head of a Shark Dissected, which also contained <b>an</b> <b>illustration</b> of a megalodon tooth.|$|E

5|$|Flare: The {{earliest}} recorded use of gunpowder for signalling purposes was the 'signal bomb' {{used by the}} Song Dynasty Chinese as the Mongol-led Yuan Dynasty besieged Yangzhou in 1276.

Another mention of the signal bomb appears in a text dating from 1293 requesting their collection from those still stored in Zhejiang. A signal gun appears in Korea by 1600.

5|$|The Brazilian {{system was}} {{relatively}} democratic {{for a period}} during which indirect elections were common in democracies. The income requirement was much higher in the United Kingdom, even after the reforms of 1832. At the time the only nations not requiring a minimum level of income as a qualification for voting were France and Switzerland where universal suffrage was introduced only in 1848. It is probable that no European country at the time had such liberal legislation as Brazil. The income requirement was low enough that any employed male citizen could qualify to vote. As <b>an</b> <b>illustration,</b> the lowest paid civil employee in 1876 was a janitor who earned Rs600$000 annually.|$|E

5|$|The term Frigate Bird {{itself was}} used in 1738 by the English naturalist and {{illustrator}} Eleazar Albin in his A Natural History of the Birds. The book included <b>an</b> <b>illustration</b> of the male bird showing the red gular pouch.

5|$|Tricholoma pardinum, {{commonly}} known as spotted tricholoma, tiger tricholoma, tigertop, leopard knight, or dirty trich, is a gilled mushroom widely distributed across North America and Europe, as well as parts of Asia. It is generally found in beech woodland in summer and autumn. Two subspecies have been described from southern Europe. First officially described by Christiaan Hendrik Persoon in 1801, Tricholoma pardinum has had a confusing taxonomic history that extends over two centuries. In 1762, German naturalist Jacob Christian Schäffer described the species Agaricus tigrinus with <b>an</b> <b>illustration</b> corresponding to what {{is thought to be}} T.pardinum, and consequently, the name Tricholoma tigrinum has been used erroneously in some European field guides.|$|E
5|$|Vavilovian mimicry {{presents}} <b>an</b> <b>illustration</b> of unintentional (or rather 'anti-intentional') selection by man. Weeders do {{not want}} to select weeds and their seeds that look increasingly like cultivated plants, yet there is no other option. For example, the Echinochloa oryzoides plant, a species of grass found as a weed in rice (Oryza sativa) fields, looks similar to rice; its seeds are often mixed in rice and have become difficult to separate through Vavilovian mimicry. Vavilovian mimics may eventually be domesticated themselves, {{as in the case of}} rye in wheat; Vavilov called these weed-crops secondary crops.|$|E
