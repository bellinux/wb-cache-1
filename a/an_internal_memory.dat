500|$|In The C++ Programming Language, Bjarne Stroustrup, on {{the other}} hand, argues that the [...] "apparently raconian {{restriction}} against per-object information in allocators is not particularly serious", pointing out that most allocators do not need state, and have better performance without it. He mentions three use cases for custom allocators, namely, memory pool allocators, shared memory allocators, and garbage collected memory allocators. He presents an allocator implementation that uses <b>an</b> <b>internal</b> <b>memory</b> pool for fast allocation and deallocation of small chunks of memory, but notes that such an optimization may already be performed by the allocator provided by the implementation.|$|E

2500|$|The {{idea for}} SAGE {{grew out of}} Project Whirlwind, a World War II {{computer}} development effort, when the War Department realized that the Whirlwind computer might anchor a continent-wide advance warning system. Developed during the 1950s by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Lincoln Laboratories engineers and scientists for the U.S. Air Force, SAGE monitored North American skies for possible attack by manned aircraft and missiles for twenty-five years. Aside from its strategic importance, SAGE set the foundation for mass data-processing systems and foreshadowed many computer developments of the 1960s. The heart of the system, the IBM AN/FSQ-7 computer, was the first computer to have <b>an</b> <b>internal</b> <b>memory</b> composed of [...] "magnetic cores," [...] thousands of tiny ferrite rings that served as reversible electromagnets.
