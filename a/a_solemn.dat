He was told almost unanimously, and accepted the fact, that the defeat was God's decision and a result of the sins {{of the people of the}} land, including him.

5|$|The crusaders {{agreed to}} help the King attack Lisbon, with <b>a</b> <b>solemn</b> {{agreement}} that offered to them the pillage of the city's goods and the ransom money for expected prisoners. The Siege of Lisbon lasted from 1 July to 25 October 1147 when, after four months, the Moorish rulers agreed to surrender, primarily due to hunger within the city. Most of the crusaders settled in the newly captured city, {{but some of them}} set sail and continued to the Holy Land.

Later they also helped to conquer Sintra, Almada, Palmela and Setúbal, and they were allowed to stay in the conquered lands, where they settled down and had offspring.|$|E

5|$|Archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans was a {{guest in}} a Serbian highlander family {{in the region of}} Krivošije, Montenegrin Littoral. Analyzing the practices, he {{concluded}} that the badnjak customs were connected with ancestor worship. The lighting of the log on the ognjište could be seen as <b>a</b> <b>solemn</b> annual rekindling of the sacred hearth fire, regarded as the center of the family life and the seat of the ancestors. The belief that ancestral spirits dwell in the domestic hearth was attested among Slavic and other peoples. Fire worship in the old Slavic religion was mostly transformed into the cult of domestic fire, and thus joined with ancestor worship. A trace of sacrifice to the fire is the coin thrown into it by the polaznik after the ritual of making sparks fly from the badnjak.|$|E
5|$|As {{the civil}} war in England {{developed}} into a long and protracted conflict, both the King and the English Parliamentarians appealed to the Scots for military aid. The Covenanters opted to side with Parliament and in 1643 they entered into <b>a</b> <b>Solemn</b> League and Covenant, guaranteeing the Scottish Church settlement and promising further reform in England. In January 1644 a Scots army of 18,000 foot and 3,000 horse and guns under Leslie crossed the border. It helped turn the tide of the war in the North, forcing the royalist army under the Marquis of Newcastle into York where it was besieged by combined Scots and Parliamentary armies. The Royalists were relieved by a force under Prince Rupert, the King's nephew, but the allies under Leslie's command defeated the Royalists decisively at Marston Moor on 2 July, generally seen as the turning point of the war.|$|E
