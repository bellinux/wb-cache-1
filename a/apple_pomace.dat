Other common press cakes come from flax seed (linseed), cottonseed, and sunflower seeds. However, some specific kinds may be toxic, and are rather used as fertilizer, for example cottonseed contains a toxic pigment, gossypol, {{that must be}} removed before processing.|$|R
40|$|Polyphenols are {{secondary}} metabolites of plants. Dietary phenolics are {{not only}} classified as human nutrients, but play important roles in human health and are therefore called nutraceuticals. Both epidemiological studies and controlled human {{studies have shown that}} regular intakes of diets rich in phenolics are inversely related to some chronic diseases such as certain cancers and coronary heart diseases. Types and contents of phenolics in different food system vary greatly and foods of plant origin including fruits, vegetables, legumes and some beverages are good sources of bioactive phenolics. Beside the edible part of plant foods, some agricultural by-products usually contain higher levels of polyphenols, particularly, flavonoids than products themselves. This chapter describes the major classes of dietary phenolics, and their occurence in the commercially important agricultural by-products including peanuts skin, grape <b>pomace,</b> <b>apples</b> <b>pomace,</b> citrus processing by-products, and cranberry pomace. The possible applications of the polyphenolics from these agricultural by-products in food system are also discussed. Scopu...|$|R
40|$|Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most harmful soilborne pathogens, which reduces productivity of horticultural crops. Currently used chemical or biological methods for the eradication of S. sclerotiorum from a soil are not very effective. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possibility of eradication of S. sclerotiorum sclerotia from a soil using the Trichoderma isolates, which were multiplied on the organic carriers prepared from agro-industrial wastes and by-products: WsA (wheat straw + <b>apple</b> <b>pomaces),</b> WsP (wheat straw + potato pulp) and T-GRAN (dry onion rind, <b>apples</b> and strawberry <b>pomaces,</b> rapeseed meal). The results showed that soil amendment with organic materials overgrown with the Trichoderma fungi had a significant reducing effect on S. sclerotiorum. Especially effective was the carrier WsA overgrown with T. virens TRS 114, which completely prevented the survival of sclerotia of S. sclerotiorum regardless of the dose of application. Less effective was the WsP carrier. However, addition WsP overgrown with T. atroviride TRS 40 at the 5 % w/v, resulted in survival only 6. 7 % of sclerotia. In the greenhouse experiments with lettuce, the application of granulates T-GRAN into the soil had different impact on S. sclerotiorum depending on the conditions to the pathogen development. In conducive conditions, an addition of the organic substances without Trichoderma significantly decreased the yield of lettuce plants.

It was first introduced to England in 1689 by agriculturalist John Worlidge, who adapted it from the sugar-cane crushers used in the West Indies.

40|$|World apple {{production}} {{accounted for}} 80 million {{tons per year}} (1. 7 and 3. 1 Mts in France and Poland, respectively). Most of this production corresponds to dessert apples. However, in France, ciders (fermented apple juices) are famous beverages produced from specific apple varieties classified according to two main criteria: polyphenol concentration and acidity of the crude juice (i. e. the must). Indeed, polyphenols are divided into six main classes: phenolic acids, catechins, procyanidins (i. e. condensed tanins), dihydrochalcones, flavonols and anthocyanins. Depending on the considered classes, polyphenols more or less contribute to organoleptic qualities of ciders including colour, bitter and astringent tastes, colloidal stability (clearness/cloudiness) and also indirectly to some particular aromas. Now they are also well-known for their contribution to preserve human health through their presence in food. In this conference, I will present a review of our works {{in the field of}} varietal diversity, biochemistry, analytical chemistry and physico-chemistry of apple polyphenols in raw materials (fruits) and in processed products (musts, juices and ciders) with regard to their contribution to organoleptic properties. Particular attention will be paid to enzymatic and chemical oxidation reactions that occur during fruit processing and that contribute to significant changes in both qualitative and quantitative polyphenol composition in cider apple products. The impact of polyphenol molecular structures on solubility, tanning properties and sensory characteristics of polyphenols will be also discussed. Regarding methodological approaches, the benefits of associating chemical degradation, chromatographic separations, UV-visible and mass spectrometry detections for the analysis of complex phenolic structures and mixtures will be illustrated by examples. Research questions related to valorisation of <b>apple</b> by-products (<b>apple</b> <b>pomaces)</b> to produce natural colorant or related to the production of innovative apple products such as “Rosé” ciders and juices will be also discussed...|$|R

40|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1970 's, {{composting}} has become widely adopted for the treatment and stabilization of municipal wastewater treatment sludges. In 1987 over 100 municipal composting facilities were in operation in the United States. However, relatively few food processing industries {{have taken advantage of}} this technology. In 1986, International Process Systems introduced a vessel type system {{that can be used for}} the economical and environmentally sound composting of a wide variety of materials. The IPS system opens up many opportunities for the food processing industry to make full use of composting as a waste management technology. This report discusses the results of two full-scale demonstrations of the successful composting of residuals from the production of (1) apple juice and (2) chocolate. A total of 127 wet tons of <b>apple</b> wastes (<b>pomace,</b> filter cake, and a biological sludge) were composted in the first study. In the second study, 8 wet tons of chocolate waste (expeller cake, bakery wastes, and a biological sludge) were processed. Sawdust was added to the waste mixtures in order to obtain an input mixture with adequate porosity and moisture for composting. In both studies, after 18 days retention in the vessels with daily agitation, the finished compost was dry, about 60 % dry matter, and sufficiently stable and odor free to be used directly as a soil amendment...|$|R
60|$|There is thus {{about all}} natural {{products}} a certain volatile and ethereal quality which represents their highest value, and which cannot be vulgarized, or bought and sold. No mortal has ever enjoyed the perfect flavor of any fruit, {{and only the}} godlike among men begin to taste its ambrosial qualities. For nectar and ambrosia are only those fine flavors of every earthly fruit which our coarse palates fail to perceive,--just as we occupy the heaven of the gods without knowing it. When I see a particularly mean man carrying a load of fair and fragrant early apples to market, I seem to see a contest going on {{between him and his}} horse, on the one side, and the apples on the other, and, to my mind, the apples always gain it. Pliny says that apples are the heaviest of all things, and that the oxen begin to sweat at the mere sight of a load of them. Our driver begins to lose his load the moment he tries to transport them to where they do not belong, that is, to any but the most beautiful. Though he gets out from time to time, and feels of them, and thinks they are all there, I see the stream of their evanescent and celestial qualities going to heaven from his cart, while the pulp and skin and core only are going to market.

50|$|The {{intricate}} {{pressing machine}} was spread across both floor levels. It essentially consisted {{on a large}} cantilevered beam (dolare haga) which passed between the two central vertical support beams (dolare zutabeak) of the building. The fixed end was {{held in place by}} a wooden beam (dolare zutabeak) right beside the actual press. The far end of the beam sat around a tall wooden screw (ardatza) which ran between beams under the roof (gain hagak) and the ground floor of the building, ending in a capstan-like turning mechanism. At the bottom end of the screw hung a stone weight (pisu harria) which rotated in a hole in the ground. By turning the screw at the ground floor level, the horizontal beam on the first floor would gradually be pulled downwards and, along with the gravitational pull, exert pressure on the apple press at the far end. The apple press itself consisted essentially out of a wooden base with a surrounding groove to catch the juices upon which the <b>apple</b> <b>pomace</b> is placed and a wooden platform which pressed down on the apples.

These unusual fruit by-products were studied for their composition in total proteins and fats, dietary fiber (DF) and their content in total and free monosaccharides. All three by-products contained around 20 % of total non-cellulosic monosaccharides and around 10 % of free monosaccharides. According to two different methods, DF accounted for 70 % {{of the dry}} weight (DW) with an insignificant soluble fraction; pectin represented 2 – 3 % of DW. Apple and pear residues were composed mainly of cellulose, whereas lignin was the main fraction for dried date. The polyphenolic content and the antioxidant activity of the three products were also assessed and the values showed that their antioxidant characteristics were {{comparable to that of}} various raw fruits. No phenolic acids were detected, indicating that the cooking process resulted in their extraction.

40|$|Argentina produces, annually, 1. 8 {{million tons}} of pome fruit, {{distributed}} almost equally between apple and pear. These fruits, produced in the High Valley of Río Negro are already a registered brand {{in the world of}} fruit. Aspergillus kawachii produces an acidic polygalacturonase (PGase) called PGI that has attracted considerable interest because of its potential use in the food industry, particularly those involving fruit production in this region (such as pectin extraction). The enzyme was cloned and expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The objective of this work was to evaluate the use of PG 1 in the enzymatic pectin extraction from <b>apples</b> and pears <b>pomace.</b> Characterization of the extracted pectin was also done. The performance of PGI extraction process was compared to the traditional chemical extraction process and to the enzymatic extraction with commercial enzymes. The esterification degree and the content of uronic acids from the pectin obtained were determined. In all cases, the extraction with PGI had higher yields than the chemical extraction process. Enzymatic extracted pectins exhibited an esterification degree> 50 % {{so that they can be}} considered belonging to the group of high methoxylpectins. According to these results, PGI could be used to produce pectins from fruit pomaces converting these materials, currently considered wastes, into by-products of the fruit industry.

In the no choice study both in 100 % fermented and unfermented <b>apple</b> <b>pomace</b> group feed intake decreased continuously resulting in death of rats apparently due to decreased digestibility owing to high fibre content. Further, fermented or unfermented <b>apple</b> <b>pomace</b> based feed had lower digestibility and efficiency of conversion than the standard rat feed. Compared to the standard feed group, growth rates in all the feed groups were negative. The results of choice study of different feeds corroborated with the no-choice study mentioned earlier. Incorporation of fermented <b>apple</b> <b>pomace</b> into standard rat feed in the ratio of 1 : 1 gave better acceptability and digestibility. Reconstituted feed with 10 % jaggery, 2 % groundnut oil, 0. 01 % mixed flavour and 1 % salt was the most acceptable. The post-mortem examination of the rats that died during the feeding trial revealed generalized oedema, probably due to some hepatotoxin in the feed. The blood glucose level in the <b>apple</b> <b>pomace</b> feed group except that was reconstituted with jaggery, showed a general hypoglycemia, though falling in the range. The increased ALT and AST levels in the serum also suggest damage to the liver. The mortality rate, post-mortem examination of the rats that died during the feeding trial and blood biochemical analysis of rat serum suggest a more elaborative study for extended period of time...|$|E
40|$|A grooved board trap {{was tested}} to detennine {{the effects of}} trap size (two sizes) and bait (<b>apple</b> <b>pomace)</b> on {{capturing}} the black vine weevil, Otiorhynchus sulcatus on raspberries, Rubus idaeus. Large traps (30 x 30 cm) caught significantly more weevils than small ones (15 x 15 cm). Large traps were also more sensitive in capturing weevils than small ones, which will be important when the weevil density is low. <b>Apple</b> <b>pomace</b> bait did not significantly enhance the attractiveness of grooved board traps to the black vine weevil. Grooved board traps may also be useful for weevil monitoring in other crops. Key words: black vine weevil, board trap, raspberry, <b>apple</b> <b>pomace...</b>|$|E
