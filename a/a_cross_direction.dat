For though the experiments with the first cube raised great expectation, they have not been generalized by those which followed. I have no doubt of the results as to that cube, but they cannot as yet be referred to crystallization. There are in the cube some faintly coloured layers parallel to the optical axis, and the matter which colours them may have an influence; but then the layers are also nearly parallel to <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> <b>direction,</b> and if at all influential should show some effect in that direction also, which they did not.|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} {{system for}} measuring the velocity of ultrasonic signals within the plane of moving web-like materials, such as paper, paperboard and the like. In addition to velocity measurements of ultrasonic signals in {{the plane of the}} web in the machine direction, MD, and <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> <b>direction,</b> CD, generally perpendicular to the direction of the traveling web, therefor, one embodiment of the system in accordance with the present invention is also adapted to provide on-line indication of the polar specific stiffness of the moving web. In another embodiment of the invention, the velocity of ultrasonic signals in the plane of the web are measured by way of a plurality of ultrasonic transducers carried by synchronously driven wheels or cylinders, thus eliminating undue transducer wear due to any speed differences between the transducers and the web. In order to provide relatively constant contact force between the transducers and the webs, the transducers are mounted in a sensor housings which include a spring for biasing the transducer radially outwardly. The sensor housings are adapted to be easily and conveniently mounted to the carrier to provide a relatively constant contact force between the transducers and the moving web.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study has been}} conducted to study the heat transfer characteristics within corrugation film cooling holes of different cross section area square, rectangular and circular. The experiments investigation for this paper have been performed using a thermal IR camera, and the flow field has been analyzed by numerical calculation using a commercial code (FLUENT) was utilized and the SST k- ω turbulence model. The effect of blowing ratio (0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5 and 2. 0) and twisted film cooling holes angles (90 °, 180 °, 270 ° and 360 °) were also considered. A duct flow enters into a twisted film cooling hole in <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> <b>direction.</b> For the corrugation film cooling hole, {{it is observed that}} the reattachment of separated flow and the vortices within the hole enhance considerably the heat/mass transfer around the holes entrance region. Results showed that the twisted film cooling holes performed better than the cylindrical hole. Also, the film cooling effectiveness and heat transfer coefficient for the corrugation holes were strongly affected by the angle of twisted film cooling holes of the corrugation hole. Results show the heat transfer enhancement range of (1. 5 - 2. 7) time of smooth film cooling holes. Experimental and numerical calculation of film cooling effectiveness is validated with pervious experimental result...|$|E

40|$|This thesis has {{investigated}} material removal mechanisms in grinding by considering single grit workpiece interaction. The investigation was performed both experimentally and using finite element simulation. Rubbing, ploughing and cutting mechanisms occurring during the grinding process were {{studied at the}} micro scale. Due to its nature the rubbing phase occurs in a very narrow region of grit-workpiece engagement and is difficult to examine under a microscope and so was investigated using FEM simulation. The ploughing mechanism was thoroughly investigated using both experimental tests and FEM simulations, and a similar trend was observed for the pile up ratio along the scratch path from the experimental tests and the FEM simulations. Ploughing and cutting mechanisms in grinding {{were found to be}} highly influenced by grit cutting edge shape, sharpness and bluntness. Cutting is the prominent mechanism when the grit cutting edge is sharp, but ploughing is more prominent when the grit cutting edge becomes flattened. In the case of multiple edges scratch formation, ploughing is dramatically increased compared to single edge scratches. Feasibility of ground surface simulation using FEM is demonstrated using multiple pass scratch formation in <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> <b>direction.</b> Although chip formation mechanism is developed at a relatively higher depth of cut (greater than 10 μm), at small scales down to 1 μm, FEM simulation was not a suitable method to use. To reduce the drawbacks of FEM simulation in micro scale cutting, a meshless simulation technique such as smooth particle hydrodynamics is recommended for future studies...|$|E

30|$|Since {{paintings}} are often varnished, specular reflections are generally abundant and pose {{a problem to}} every imaging setup. Many 3 -D imaging approaches assume an entirely diffuse (Lambertian) surface, and therefore do not cope well with reflections. Reflections are generally easy to detect, but information will be lost at reflective locations. Therefore, prevention of reflections in our captures images is important. It is relevant {{to note that the}} (amount of) reflections is not of much importance to the depiction of the artwork itself, as it often applied by museum professionals instead of the original artists. Because we work with the projector as a local illuminant, there is a straightforward way to suppress specular reflections. By using the fact that light reflecting off a surface is polarized with a direction perpendicular to the plane of incidence. We can filter out most of this particular polarized light by using a polarization filter mounted on the camera. In order to maximize this effect, we can mount another polarization filter in <b>a</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>direction</b> with the one in front of the camera. This will effectively cancel out all specular reflections, resulting in an image of the entirely diffuse surface; specular reflections induced by a film of varnish will not be visible in our data. However, such a film can influence the observed depth due to the refraction of the projector’s light. This contribution is considered negligible due to the small thickness of the film. A non-transparent varnish will introduce errors similarly to those of a defocused camera, and will decrease our triangulation accuracy on high frequency features like sharp edges.|$|R
