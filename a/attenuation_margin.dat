40|$|Rain {{attenuation}} {{propagation data}} for 68 cities within {{the coverage area}} of the multiple beam and steerable antennas of the Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS) are presented. These data provide the necessary data base for purposes of communication link power budgeting and rain attenuation mitigation controller design. These propagation parameters are derived by applying the ACTS Rain Attenuation Prediction Model to these 68 locations. The propagation parameters enumerated in tabular form for each location are as follows: (1) physical description of the link and location (e. g., latitude, longitude, antenna elevation angle, etc.), link availability versus <b>attenuation</b> <b>margin</b> (also in graphical form), fading time across fade depths of 3, 5, 8, and 15 dB versus fade duration, and required fade control response time for controller availabilities of 99. 999, 99. 99, 99. 9, and 99 percent versus sub-threshold attenuation levels.

40|$|Over {{the next}} several years, NASA plans to launch several earth science {{missions}} which are expected to achieve data throughputs of 5 - 40 terabits per day transmitted from low earth orbiting spacecraft to ground stations. The current S-band and X-band frequency allocations in use by NASA, however, are incapable of supporting the data rates required to meet this demand. As such, NASA is {{in the planning stages}} to upgrade its existing Near Earth Network (NEN) polar ground stations to support Ka-band (25. 5 - 27 GHz) operations. Consequently, it installed and operated a Ka-band radiometer at the Svalbard site. Svalbard was chosen as the appropriate site for two primary reasons: (1) Svalbard will be the first site to be upgraded to Ka-band operations within the NEN Polar Network enhancement plan, and (2) there exists a complete lack of Ka-band propagation data at this site (as opposed to the Fairbanks, AK NEN site, which has 5 years of characterization collected during the Advanced Communications Technology becomes imperative that characterization of propagation effects at these NEN sites is conducted to determine expected system Satellite (ACTS) campaign). processing and provide the Herein, we discuss the data three-year measurement results performance, particularly at low elevation angles ((is) less than 10 deg) from the ongoing Ka-band propagation characterization where spacecraft signal acquisition typically occurs. Since May 2011, NASA Glenn Research Center has installed and operated a Ka-band radiometer at the NEN site located in Svalbard, Norway. The Ka-band radiometer monitors the water vapor line, as well as 4 frequencies around 26. 5 GHz at a fixed 10 deg elevation angle. Three-year data collection results indicate good campaign at Svalbard, Norway. Comparison of these results with the ITU models and existing ERA profile data indicates very good agreement when the 2010 rain maps and cloud statistics are used. Finally, the Svalbard data is used to derive the expected atmospheric margin requirements for this site agreement with models and comparable performance to necessary to maintain total system availability levels for the previously characterized northern latitude sites in the United States, i. e., Fairbanks, Alaska.

40|$|A new {{straightforward}} {{design of}} a special class of elliptic IIR filters is presented. The major goal is the complexity reduction of the realized digital filter. The multiplier coefficients are implemented with limited number of shift-and-add operations. This method is also called "multiplierless".

40|$|The {{reliable}} {{design of}} satellite communication systems requires {{the consideration of}} interference effects. Interference caused by differential rain attenuation from an adjacent earth-space system is taken under consideration here. In particular, a method to predict rain differential attenuation statistics used for single/double site earth-space systems is er;tended to include triple-she diversity ones. The modified method is again based on a model of convective rain cells {{as well as on}} the lognormal assumption for the point rainfall rate distribution at the location under consideration. In an analogous fashion with the (C/N) ratio, a > is also adopted here and some very useful remarks concerning the effectiveness of the triple-site diversity protection as a countermeasure technique are deduced. As a general conclusion, it can be stated that the triple-site scheme not only reduce the potential large <b>attenuation</b> <b>margins</b> significantly; but also leads to the establishment of the minimum separation between satellites operating under permitted interference levels...|$|R
40|$|A dynamic rain {{attenuation}} {{prediction model}} is developed {{for use in}} obtaining the temporal characteristics, on time scales of minutes or hours, of satellite communication link availability. Analagous to the associated static rain attenuation model, which yields yearly attenuation predictions, this dynamic model is applicable at any location {{in the world that}} is characterized by the static rain attenuation statistics peculiar to the geometry of the satellite link and the rain statistics of the location. Such statistics are calculated by employing the formalism of Part I of this report. In fact, the dynamic model presented here is an extension of the static model and reduces to the static model in the appropriate limit. By assuming that rain attenuation is dynamically described by a first-order stochastic differential equation in time and that this random attenuation process is a Markov process, an expression for the associated transition probability is obtained by solving the related forward Kolmogorov equation. This transition probability is then used to obtain such temporal rain attenuation statistics as attenuation durations and allowable <b>attenuation</b> <b>margins</b> versus control system delay...|$|R

40|$|Radiologists {{have used}} margin {{characteristics}} based on routine visual analysis; however, the attenuation {{changes at the}} margin of the lesion on CT images have not been quantitatively assessed. We established a CT-based margin analysis method by comparing a target lesion with normal lung attenuation, drawing a slope to represent the attenuation changes. This approach was applied to patients with invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma (n = 40) or bacterial pneumonia (n = 30). Correlations among multiple regions of interest (ROIs) were obtained using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values. CT visual assessment, margin and texture parameters were compared for differentiating the two disease entities. The <b>attenuation</b> and <b>margin</b> parameters in multiple ROIs showed excellent ICC values. Attenuation slopes obtained at the margins revealed a difference between invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma and pneumonia (P< 0. 001), and mucinous adenocarcinoma produced a sharply declining attenuation slope. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, pneumonia had an ill-defined margin (odds ratio (OR), 4. 84; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1. 26 - 18. 52; P = 0. 02), ground-glass opacity (OR, 8. 55; 95 % CI, 2. 09 - 34. 95; P = 0. 003), and gradually declining <b>attenuation</b> at the <b>margin</b> (OR, 12. 63; 95 % CI, 2. 77 - 57. 51, P = 0. 001).

40|$|Adaptive {{control is}} an {{attractive}} method to solve control problems since the tedious task of identifying process behavior to find a suitable design for the controller is {{taken care of by}} the adaptive controller itself. It may be difficult, however, to guarantee robustness (in the sense of desired disturbance <b>attenuation</b> and stability <b>margins)</b> for traditional adaptive schemes since their corresponding loop gain is time varying. This {{is part of the reason}} why adaptive control has not yet found widespread use in industry. This thesis focuses on an adaptive-control structure whose adaptive feature is restricted to the open-loop or feedforward part of a two-degrees-of-freedom controller. It may be seen as a traditional model reference adaptive controller with fixed loop gain. This can lead to easier robustness analysis (in the sense of desired disturbance <b>attenuation</b> and stability <b>margins)</b> compared to traditional adaptive schemes whose loop gains are time varying. Although the underlying idea of feedforward adaptation is simple and natural, little research has been carried out on how it should be applied. Existing schemes which resemble the structure investigated herein, such as Feedback Error Learning and Simple Adaptive Control, require the feedback loop to be strictly positive real to guarantee error convergence. This condition is successfully removed in this thesis by basing the update law on an estimation error or a prediction error instead of a tracking error. Parameter projection is applied to guarantee the desired convergence properties. The control structure is not merely of academic nature. Industrial control problems exist where the structure may be a suitable alternative to other adaptive-control schemes. The scheme is therefore simulated for possible industrial problems, and different update laws are evaluated in the appended papers. The results in this thesis may be helpful for engineers that consider to use modest adaptation to solve industrial control problems...|$|R

She presented with postmenopausal bleeding in September 2010. The patient received seven courses of paclitaxel (175 mg/m 2) and carboplatin (6 mg/GFR＋ 25) for stage IV cervical cancer with paraaortic, bilateral common iliac, mediastinal lymph node metastases and left adrenal metastasis from October 2010 to April 2011.

CT features of 13 pathologically proven colorectal schwannomas and 21 GISTs were retrospectively reviewed. The following CT items were analyzed: size, longitudinal and transverse location, shape, margin, homogeneity, necrosis, surface ulceration, calcification, degree of attenuation, {{the presence of}} enlarged lymph node (LN), and metastasis. Among the features, significant variables were evaluated using univariate statistical tests. The optimal cut-off point of tumor size was obtained by ROC analysis. Binary logistic regression {{analysis was used to}} find the most independent CT variables. Small size, non-rectum location, smooth <b>margin,</b> homogeneous high <b>attenuation</b> without necrosis, and the presence of enlarged LNs were found to be significant variables to differentiate schwannomas from GISTs (P< 0. 05). The optimized cut-off point for tumor size in distinguishing GISTs from schwannomas was 3. 9 cm (AUC = 0. 808, sensitivity = 66. 7 %, specificity = 92. 3 %, P< 0. 0001). Binary regression analysis revealed that only non-rectum location remained independent predictor for schwannomas differentiated from GISTs (odds ratio = 31. 667, P = 0. 001).

40|$|Abstract — The {{knowledge}} of 1 -minute integrated cumulative rain rate distribution {{is required for}} predicting the attenuation induced by rain on satellite and terrestrial microwave and millimetric links. In this paper, conversion coefficients are derived for estimating the equivalent 1 -minute rain rate statistics from those available in 5 and 30 -minutes over Akure, South-Western Nigeria. The derivation {{is based on the}} power-law relationship existing between equiprobable rain rate statistics, while comparison is made with estimates available for ot her locations. Apparent in the result is the significant variation in the values estimated for similar observation periods over the years and across different locations. Form the evaluation of the coefficients derived for Akure, the 5 -minute conversion provides a more satisfactory performance and hence more suitable for estimating the equivalent 1 -minute rain rate statistics for Akure. Quantifying the seasonal precipitation variability, the point rain rates for wet (raining) and dry (harmattan) seasons are 80 and 20 mm/h respectively and the resultant impact on NIGCOMSAT 1 -R link reveals that an additional fade margin of 4 and 1. 7 dB would be required to meet a 99. 99 % system availability objective in the wet season, specifically at 12 and 10 GHz respectively. 239 Index Terms — Rain rate statistics, rain induced <b>attenuation,</b> rain fade <b>margin,</b> conversion coefficient, link availability...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the findings and evaluate the role of multidetector (40 -slice) computed tomography (MDCT) in the preoperative assessment of gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs). Materials and methods. Thirteen patients with histologically proven GIST (size: 4 - 30 cm; mean: 9 cm) underwent 40 -slice MDCT after the ingestion of 1, 000 ml of water. Images were obtained before and 70 s after intravenous injection of 120 ml of iodinated contrast agent. Two experienced radiologists reviewed the CT findings to evaluate lesion site, size, <b>margins,</b> <b>attenuation,</b> growth pattern, enhancement pattern, ascites, lymphadenopathy, direct invasion to adjacent organs and distant metastasis. Multiplanar maximum intensity projection and three-dimensional (3 D) reconstructions were also obtained. Results. Seven out of 13 GISTs were located in the jejunum-ileum, 3 / 13 in the stomach, 2 / 13 in the rectum and in one case, the origin remained unknown. Eleven out of 13 were exophytic, and ten had well-defined borders. Two out of 13 showed calcifications. Thirteen out of 13 exhibited inhomogeneous enhancement due to areas of necrosis and cystic degeneration. Direct invasion to adjacent organs (n= 3), ascites (n= 3), and liver (n= 1) and peritoneal (n= 1) metastases were also detected. Bowel obstruction, vascular invasion and lymphadenopathy were never seen. Conclusions. MDCT allowed reliable preoperative assessment of GIST, providing useful clues for lesion characterisation...|$|R

40|$|Water quality trading {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a cost-effective approach for reducing nutrient loads through credit generation from agricultural or point source reductions sold to buyers facing costly options. We present a systematic approach to determine attenuation coefficients and their uncertainty. Using a process-based model, we determine <b>attenuation</b> with safety <b>margins</b> at many watersheds for total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) loads as they transport from point of load reduction to the credit buyer. TN and TP in-stream attenuation generally increases with decreasing mean river flow; smaller rivers in the modeled region of the Ohio River Basin had TN attenuation factors per km, including safety margins, of 0. 19 - 1. 6 %, medium riv ers of 0. 14 - 1. 2 %, large rivers of 0. 13 - 1. 1 %, and very large rivers of 0. 04 - 0. 42 %. Attenuation in ditches transporting nutrients from farms to receiving rivers is 0. 4 %/km for TN, while for TP attenuation in ditches can be up to 2 %/km. A 95 percentile safety margin of 30 - 40 % for TN and 6 - 10 % for TP, applied to the attenuation per km factors, was determined from the in-stream sensitivity of load reductions to watershed model parameters. For perspective, over 50 km a 1 % per km factor would result in 50 % attenuation = 2 : 1 trading ratio. © 2014 American Chemical Society...|$|R
40|$|This study {{provides}} reliable, precisely defined and well-dated Early Permian (286 ± 6 Ma) palaeomagnetic poles for Australia from the Mount Leyshon Intrusive Complex (MLIC) and the Tuckers Igneous Complex (TIC). Both complexes {{are associated with}} prominent negative magnetic anomalies, indicating the presence of rocks carrying stable remanence of reverse polarity, with a Koenigsberger ratio greater than unity. The characteristic remanence carried by the intrusive phases and by locally remagnetized, contact-metamorphosed host rocks is always of reverse polarity, consistent with acquisition during the Permo-Carboniferous (Kiaman) Reverse Superchron. The corresponding palaeopoles confirm that Australia occupied high latitudes in the Early Permian. The pole positions are: MLIC: lat. = 43. 2 °S, long. = 137. 3 °E; dp= 6. 0 °, dm= 6. 4 °; Q = 6; TIC: lat. = 47. 5 °S, long. = 143. 0 °E, dp= 6. 0 °, dm= 6. 6 °; Q = 6. Permian palaeomagnetic overprinting is detectable at considerable distances from the MLIC (2 – 3 km), well beyond the zone of visible alteration. The primary nature of the Early Permian palaeomagnetic signature is established by full baked contact/aureole tests at both localities. Other newdata from Australia {{are consistent with the}} poles reported here. Comparison of the Australian, African and South American Apparent Polar Wander Paths (APWP) suggests that mean Permian and Triassic poles fromWest Gondwana, particularly from South America, are biased by remagnetization in the Jurassic–Cretaceous and that the Late Palaeozoic–Mesozoic APWP for Gondwana is best defined by Australian data. The Australian APWP exhibits substantial movement through the Mesozoic. Provided only that the time-averaged palaeofield was zonal, the Early Triassic palaeomagnetic data from Australia provide an important palaeogeographic constraint that the south geographic pole was within, or very close to, SE Australia around 240 Ma. The new Early Permian poles are apparently more consistent with Pangaea B-type reconstructions of Gondwana and Laurussia than with the Pangaea A 2 configuration. This may be partly an artefact of reconstruction problems within Gondwana, as systematic differences between approximately coeval, apparently reliable, Permo-Carboniferous poles from Africa, South America and Australia are evident in standard Gondwana reconstructions. These discordances require a tighter fit of the southern continents, suggesting that some <b>attenuation</b> of continental <b>margins,</b> not accounted for in the reconstructions, has occurred during breakup of Gondwana, or that the fit between East and West Gondwana needs to be substantially modified. If stretching of continental margins during breakup of supercontinents is a general phenomenon, it may help to ameliorate, but not solve, the long-standing controversy regarding Pangaea reconstructions. Although alternative Pangaea reconstructions, such as Pangaea B, may reconcile poles from Laurussia with Australian poles in the Late Carboniferous–Early Permian, no plausible reconstruction can bring the Early Triassic poles into agreement. This suggests that persistent departures from a pure dipole field may have been present in the Early Triassic. Lesser, but still significant, non-dipole effects may also have been present during the Late Carboniferous and Permian, and may help resolve the Pangaea A versus B controversy, without requiring substantial <b>attenuation</b> of continental <b>margins</b> or intracontinental deformation. We suggest that the most parsimonious interpretation of the palaeomagnetic and geological information is that Laurussia and Gondwana remained in a Pangaea A 2 -type configuration through the Permian and Triassic. Discordance between the APWPs for these two supercontinents is attributable mainly to persistent non-dipole components of the geomagnetic field, which were most important in the Early Triassic. 25 page(s...|$|R
40|$|On the Pacific margin off central Costa Rica, an {{anomalous}} lens-shaped zone {{is located}} between the overriding plate and the subducting oceanic lithosphere approximately 25 km landward of the deformation front. This feature was previously recognized in reflection seismic data {{when it was}} termed ‘megalens’. Its origin and seismic velocity structure, however, could not unambiguously be derived from earlier studies. Therefore during RV SONNE cruise SO 163 in 2002, seismic wide-angle data were acquired using closely spaced ocean bottom hydrophones and seismometers along two parallel strike lines and two parallel dip lines above the ‘megalens’, intersecting on the middle slope. In this study, the P-wave velocities {{and structure of the}} subducting oceanic Cocos Plate and overriding Caribbean Plate are determined from modeling of the wide-angle seismic data of cruise SO 163. In addition, coincident reflection seismic data are analyzed and incorporated into the forward modeling and tomographic inversion of the refraction data. Based on the results of the velocity modeling, synthetic seismograms are calculated for an amplitude analysis of the refraction data to determine seismic attenuation variations across the seaward extent of the margin. The margin wedge is defined by high seismic velocities (4. 3 - 6. 1 km/s) identified within a wedge-shaped body covered by a slope sediment drape. It is divided into two layers with different velocity gradients. Seismic velocities of the upper margin wedge vary from 4. 0 to 4. 3 km/s near the trench to 4. 0 - 5. 1 km/s close to the shoreline. The lower margin wedge is clearly constrained by decreasing velocities towards the trench and terminates beneath the middle slope at the location of the ‘megalens’. Seismic velocities of the ‘megalens’ are lower (3. 8 - 4. 3 km/s) relative to the margin wedge, implying that the ‘megalens’ represents hybrid material composed of subducted sediment and eroded fragments {{from the base of the}} upper plate. Upward-migrating overpressured fluids weaken the base of the margin wedge through hydrofracturing, V thus causing material transfer from the upper plate to the lower plate. Results from amplitude modeling confirm that the ‘megalens’ observed off central Costa Rica is bound by a low velocity zone documenting fluid drainage from the plate boundary to the upper plate. Seismic attenuation of the central Costa Rica margin wedge is determined from amplitude analysis of the wide-angle seismic data. Travel time and amplitude modeling is applied to ocean bottom hydrophones along two trench-parallel profiles, located 30 km (P 21 &P 22) and 35 km (P 18) landward of the deformation front northeast of Quepos Plateau. Tomographic inversion images a progressively thinning margin wedge from the coast to the lower slope at the trench. A 1 - 1. 5 km thick décollement zone with seismic velocities of 3. 5 - 4. 5 km/s is sandwiched between the margin wedge basement and the subducting Cocos plate. For strike line P 21, amplitude modeling indicates a Qp value of 50 - 150 for the upper margin wedge with velocities of 3. 9 - 4. 9 km/s. Along strike line P 18, Qp values of 50 - 150 are determined with velocities of 4. 3 - 5. 0 km/s in the upper margin wedge, increasing to 5. 1 - 5. 4 km/s in the lower margin wedge. Quantitative amplitude decay curves support the observed upper plate Qp.
