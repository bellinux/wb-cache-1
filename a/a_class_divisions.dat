40|$|A short, sharp, {{and provocative}} book, Blow Up the Humanities has esteemed scholar Toby Miller declaring {{that there are}} two {{humanities}} in the United States.

There is <b>a</b> <b>class</b> <b>division</b> between the two—both in terms of faculty research and student background—and it must end. Miller critically lays waste to the system. He examines scholarly publishing as well as media and cultural studies to show how to restructure the humanities by studying popular cultural phenomena, like video games. Miller ultimately insists that these two humanities must merge in order to survive and succeed in producing an aware and concerned citizenry...|$|R

50|$|There are {{a number}} of strands to post-Keynesian theory with {{different}} emphases. Joan Robinson regarded Michał Kalecki’s theory of effective demand to be superior to Keynes’ theories. Kalecki's theory is based on <b>a</b> <b>class</b> <b>division</b> between workers and capitalists and imperfect competition. Robinson also led the critique of the use of aggregate production functions based on homogeneous capital - the Cambridge capital controversy - winning the argument but not the battle. The writings of Piero Sraffa were a significant influence on the post-Keynesian position in this debate, though Sraffa and his neo-Ricardian followers drew more inspiration from David Ricardo than Keynes. Much of Nicholas Kaldor’s work was based on the ideas of increasing returns to scale, path dependency, and the key differences between the primary and industrial sectors.|$|R

50|$|From 1821 to 1846, after Mexico gained its {{independence}} from Spain, California was under Mexican rule. In 1824, the Mexican constitution guaranteed citizenship to all persons, providing natives {{with the right to}} continue occupying their villages. Additionally, the Mexican National Congress passed the Colonization Act of 1824 which granted large sections of unoccupied land to individuals. This act enforced <b>a</b> <b>class</b> <b>division</b> in which Native Americans were treated like slaves because the native Californians became the labor force for these ranchos. In 1833, the government secularized missions, saying that the missions needed to give their land to catholic Indians. Instead of doing that, however, many civil authorities confiscated most of the land for themselves. Californios often gained prominence by conducting military attacks on indigenous settlements. By 1846, Mexico’s Assembly had passed resolutions calling for funds to locate and destroy Indian villages.|$|R
5000|$|Without {{taking the}} {{argument}} that far, {{it is evident that}} in a market system with uneven distribution of empowering work, such as Economic Democracy, some workers will be more able than others to capture the benefits of economic gain. For example, if one worker designs cars and another builds them, the designer will use his cognitive skills more frequently than the builder. In the long term, the designer will become more adept at conceptual work than the builder, giving the former greater bargaining power in a firm over the distribution of income. A conceptual worker who is not satisfied with his income can threaten to work for a company that will pay him more. The effect is <b>a</b> <b>class</b> <b>division</b> between conceptual and manual laborers, and ultimately managers and workers, and a de facto labor market for conceptual workers.|$|R
