SmackDown General Manager Vickie Guerrero, who portrays an {{on-screen}} authority figure for the SmackDown brand, then came to the ring and proceeded to insult the Big Show, and demanded that he leave the ring. Druids then came to the ring bringing a casket, and The Undertaker appeared on the TitanTron, telling Guerrero to either get in the casket herself or he would put her in it. Guerrero refused to enter the casket voluntarily, so The Undertaker began to come to ringside. The Big Show held back Guerrero as The Undertaker came to the ring. Once he was in the ring, The Undertaker began to choke Guerrero, but the Big Show turned heel, becoming a villainous character, by striking The Undertaker and freeing Guerrero. He proceeded to attack The Undertaker, and restrained him to allow Guerrero to slap him <b>and</b> <b>spit</b> in his face.|$|E

25|$|A 2013 {{article in}} the Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery found that rescuers and veterinarians in the United Kingdom tended to {{distinguish}} feral cats from domesticated cats based on traits such as their levels of socialization, ownership, and confinement, and {{on the amount of}} fear of, interaction with, and dependence upon humans. They found that rescuers and veterinarians tended to agree that feral cats were cats that had not had much human contact (particularly before eight weeks of age), would try to avoid humans, and would prefer to escape rather than attack a human. However, veterinarians and rescuers disagreed on whether a feral cat would tend to hiss <b>and</b> <b>spit</b> at or attack a human during an encounter, and disagreed on whether adult ferals could potentially be tamed. The article provided a composite definition of a feral cat as a cat that would choose not to interact with humans, could survive with or without human assistance, and would hide or defend itself when trapped rather than allowing itself to be handled.|$|E

500|$|The {{destruction}} of the Pillar brought a temporary glut of popular songs, including [...] "Nelson's Farewell", by The Dubliners, in which Nelson's airborne demise is presented as Ireland's contribution to the space race. During its more than 150 years, the Pillar was an integral if controversial part of Dublin life, and was often reflected in Irish literature of the period. James Joyce's novel Ulysses (1922) is a meticulous depiction of the city on a single day, 16 June 1904. At {{the base of the}} Pillar trams {{from all parts of the}} city come and go; meanwhile the character Stephen Dedalus fantasises a scene involving two elderly spinsters, who climb the steps [...] to the viewing gallery where they eat plums <b>and</b> <b>spit</b> the stones down on those below, while gazing up at [...] "the one-handled adulterer".|$|E

So primitive that they manage to make label mates Mudhoney sound like Genesis, Nirvana turn up the volume <b>and</b> <b>spit</b> and claw their {{way to the top of}} the musical garbage heap", and gave it an eight out of ten rating.

500|$|Dead Head Fred is a third-person action-adventure {{game that}} {{incorporates}} {{a variety of}} gameplay styles, including combat, platforming, and puzzles. [...] The core gameplay of Dead Head Fred revolves around Fred's missing head {{and his ability to}} [...] "switch" [...] heads by defeating certain enemies, decapitating them, and collecting their heads (referred to as [...] "headhunting"). [...] As Fred explores the city of Hope Falls, he can collect an assortment of heads, each of which has unique abilities. [...] Examples include the Stone Idol head, which Fred can use as a battering ram, and the Corpse head, which can be used to suck up <b>and</b> <b>spit</b> out water, gasoline, and other materials. [...] Fred uses these heads to navigate the city of Hope Falls, and certain parts of the city are not accessible until certain heads are found. [...] The high level of radiation in Hope Falls has led to a proliferation of grossly mutated worms, which the player can collect and use to upgrade Fred's heads and temporarily increase his fighting abilities, among other benefits. Also collectible are money and special items, which can be earned by defeating enemies or completing various side-missions. [...] There are several minigames unrelated to the plot, such as pinball and fishing, scattered around the city.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} {{vulnerable}} stretches is that between Blakeney Point and Weybourne, which included the Cley and Salthouse Marsh reserves. The coast here is protected by a shingle ridge, but the sea attacks the ridge <b>and</b> <b>spit</b> through tidal and storm action, with a single storm sometimes moving a [...] "spectacular" [...] amount of shingle. The Blakeney Point spit has sometimes been breached, becoming an island for a time, and this may happen again. The northernmost part of nearby Blakeney was lost to the sea in the early Middle Ages, probably due to a storm. The spit is moving towards the mainland at about 1m (1yd) per year, {{and for the last}} two hundred years maps have been accurate enough for the encroachment of the sea to be quantified. Blakeney Chapel was 400m (440yd) from the sea in 1817, but this had reduced to 195m (215yd) {{by the end of the}} 20th century. The landward movement of the shingle means that the channel of the River Glaven becomes blocked increasingly often, leading to flooding of the reserve and Cley village. The Environment Agency considered several remedial options to protect these vulnerable areas, and a new route for the river to the south of its original line was completed in 2007 at a cost of about £1.5million.|$|E

It is known that in both the Parthian Empire and Kushan Empire of Asia, ethnic Greeks continued to be employed after the Hellenistic period as musicians and athletes. The Book of the Later Han states that Emperor An transferred these entertainers from his countryside residence to the capital Luoyang, where they gave a performance at his court and were rewarded with gold, silver, and other gifts. Raoul McLaughlin notes that the Romans knew Burma as India Trans Gangem (India Beyond the Ganges) and that Ptolemy listed the cities of Burma. McLaughlin speculates that the Romans were selling slaves to the Burmese and that this is how the entertainers originally reached Burma before they were sent by the Burmese ruler to Emperor An in China. Syrian jugglers were renowned in Western Classical literature, and Chinese sources from the 2nd century BC to the 2nd century AD mention them as well.|$|E

As Swift's ex-boyfriend and the woman start frolicking inside the truck, and the music begins and the music video transcends to a concrete room where the singer (clothed by a grey, one-shoulder mini-dress and black leather, thigh-length boots) is playing an electric guitar, alongside her backup band. During [...] "Picture to Burn"'s chorus, fire ignites behind them. Afterwards, the band is depicted entering a house furtively, using flashlights.
