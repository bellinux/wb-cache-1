In 1936 at a Senate meeting of Andhra University, it was decided to invite Reddy to return again to Andhra University as its Vice-Chancellor. He came back in 1936 to Waltaire for the second time as Vice-Chancellor and retained this position till 1949. During this period Andhra University became internationally known. Dr S Bhagavantam, Dr T R Seshadri, Dr V K R V Rao and Dr V S Krishna, K. R.

2500|$|There {{is always}} {{disagreement}} between fishermen and government scientists... Imagine an overfished {{area of the}} sea {{in the shape of}} a hockey field with nets at either end. The few fish left therein would gather around the goals because fish like structured habitats. Scientists would survey the entire field, make lots of unsuccessful hauls, and conclude that it contains few fish. The fishermen would make <b>a</b> <b>beeline</b> to the goals, catch the fish around them, and say the scientists do not know what they are talking about. The subjective impression the fishermen get is always that there's lots of fish - because they only go to places that still have them... fisheries scientists survey and compare entire areas, not only the productive fishing spots. – Fisheries scientist Daniel Pauly ...|$|E

30|$|FT can be {{considered}} as the energy accumulation of the analyzed signal along <b>a</b> time–frequency <b>beeline</b> parallel to time axes. The global transform converts the analyzed signal from time domain into spectral representation.

2500|$|The 18th {{episode of}} the sixth season of the satirical stop-motion series Robot Chicken, {{released}} February 3, 2013, features a sketch where, after the failure of Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark, a second attempt is made to make a Marvel superhero musical, titled [...] "Avengers: Musictacular Tapstravaganza", featuring musical numbers sung by Thor, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Loki, and Iron Man, a dance number by Captain America, and a large animatronic Hulk. The musical plays out decently at best until the animatronic Hulk begins to spark and malfunction, causing an explosion that decapitates the actor playing Thor, impales the actor playing Iron Man with a pipe, and severely injures {{the rest of the}} cast. Considering the fact that the actors have no insurance, the musical's director and producer light two Molotov cocktails and toss them, burning the theatre as they make <b>a</b> <b>beeline</b> for the exit.|$|E
2500|$|The {{southern}} {{boundary of}} the fell is formed by Raise Gill {{on the western side}} of the ridge and Shoulthwaite Gill in the east. To say that they drain The Peewits — the hideous bog on the ridge to High Tove — would be untrue, but they are fed by it. Shoulthwaite Gill does not head due east for Thirlmere as might be expected, but turns due north to form the eastern boundary. It is cut off from the reservoir by the lower parallel ridge of Raven Crag and High Rigg and instead makes <b>a</b> <b>beeline</b> for the River Greta. Mere Gill, one of its many tributaries forms the north eastern edge of High Seat. This flows from a point on the ridge to Bleaberry Fell which bears the name of Threefooted Brandreth: (a brandreth being the word for a three-legged stand in an oven on which a griddle was placed when cakes etc. were baked.) ...|$|E

2500|$|IGN {{was pleased}} with Age of Mythologys campaign, and not bothered by its length. Instead, they stated that [...] "the {{meaningful}} and engaging single player campaign provides a nearly flawless experience." [...] However, GameSpot was slightly critical of it, claiming that [...] "while some of the campaign missions do feature some unusual circumstances or objectives that change, the game's story isn't incredibly engaging." [...] This was compromised by stating that Age of Empires fans wouldn't expect an amazing campaign; they would [...] "make <b>a</b> <b>beeline</b> for the game's random map mode, anyway." [...] PC Gamer elaborated more on the campaign however, saying: [...] "many of the missions are extremely well-crafted", and that [...] "sprinkled throughout these encounters are moments of genuine comedy — a truly delightful surprise." [...] However, they still found reasons to criticize: [...] "Regrettably, most of AoMs missions suffer from one recurring, frustrating problem: a severe case of 'build base-itis.'" [...] The reviewer elaborated: [...] "I know base-building is inherent to the genre, {{but even the most}} ardent fan will be put off by just how much there is. What's most disappointing is that AoMs setting really lends itself to imaginative mission design — and I don't think the designers took full advantage of the backdrop, which is a shame." ...|$|E

50|$|Route 367 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with U.S. Route 6 (the Grand Army of the Republic Highway) in the hamlet of Skinners Eddy, {{just east of}} Laceyville. The route progresses northeastward as a two-lane road, paralleling Eddy Mountain Road through some houses. After curving further to the northeast, the road becomes predominantly rural and leaves Wyoming County for Bradford County. In Bradford County, Route 367 enters Tuscarora Township. Just after the county line, Quadrant Route 1014 terminates at Route 367. The route remains wooded, weaving its way northward through Tuscarora Township {{along the side of}} a pond. After the pond, the highway makes <b>a</b> short <b>beeline</b> to the northwest before turning northward once again. A short distance after the curve, the route curves once again, this time to the northwest and enters the hamlet of Silvara. There, the route forks to the northeast out of the woods intersecting with Quadrant Routes 1002 (Turkey Path Road), 1003 (Steam Mill Hollow Road) and 1001 (Clapper Hill Road). After Route 1001, Route 367 turns eastward out of Silvara and crosses Coburn Hill into Susquehanna County.|$|R

30|$|In {{the grid}} topology, the total energy {{consumption}} {{depends on the}} routing combination from the lowest tier to the highest tier. Since we suppose that all the sensor nodes send signals with the same rating power level (133 [*]dB), the lowest energy consumption is obtained if the beeline paths are used in all the tiers (refer to Figures 14 (a) and 14 (b)), and the highest one is obtained when biased pathes are used in each tier (refer to Figures 14 (c) and 14 (d)). If the routing combination is <b>a</b> hybrid of <b>beeline</b> and biased pathes, the energy consumption is between the minimum and the maximum.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{theoretical}} studies {{suggested that}} the stabilizing factors for large nitrogen cages tend to favor more five-membered rings, more three-membered rings and cylinder-shaped structure {{with large numbers of}} layers. Our present studies on the relative stability of all-nitrogen cages suggest that the stabilizing factors originate from the dispersion interactions. The cylinder-shaped of N 66 (with D 3 h symmetry) has been studied in detail. The structure and energies are examined at the B 3 LYP/cc-pVDZ level. In addition, single-point energy calculations at the MP 2 /cc-pVDZ and the B 3 LYP/cc-pVTZ levels are carried out in order {{to determine whether or not}} dispersion interactions exist in N 66. To fully understand the bonding in this cage molecule, NBO and AIM analyses are performed. The results show that the dispersion interactions contribute to the stability of the cylinder-shaped N 66. Meanwhile, electrostatic potential analysis shows that N 66 has negative electrostatic potential on the outside and positive electrostatic potential inside the tube. As the eleventh member of the series (N 6) n (n = 1 - 30, with D 3 h or D 3 d symmetry alternatively), cylinder-shaped N 66 may also be <b>a</b> novel <b>beeline</b> nanotube which is environmentally friendly.

40|$|Route maps, which {{depict a}} path from one {{location}} to another, {{have emerged as}} one of the most popular applications on the Web. Current computer-generated route maps, however, are often very difficult to use. In this paper we present a set of cartographic generalization techniques specifically designed to improve the usability of route maps. Our generalization techniques are based both on cognitive psychology research studying how route maps are used and on an analysis of the generalizations commonly found in handdrawn route maps. We describe algorithmic implementations of these generalization techniques within <b>BeeLine,</b> <b>a</b> real-time system for automatically designing and rendering route maps. We show that Bee-Line produces route maps that are much more usable than those produced by current computer-based route map rendering systems. Feedback from over 1100 users indicates that over 99 % believe BeeLine maps are preferable to using standard computer-generated route maps alone...|$|R
