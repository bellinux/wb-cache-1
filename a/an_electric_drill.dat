500|$|On June 11, 1962, Frank Morris, John Anglin, and Clarence Anglin {{carried out}} one of the most {{intricate}} escapes ever devised. Behind the prisoners' cells in Cell Block B (where the escapees were interned) was an unguarded [...] wide utility corridor. The prisoners chiselled away the moisture-damaged concrete from around an air vent leading to this corridor, using tools such as a metal spoon soldered with silver from a dime and <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>drill</b> improvised from a stolen vacuum cleaner motor. The noise was disguised by accordions played during music hour, and the progress was concealed by false walls which, in the dark recesses of the cells, fooled the guards.|$|E

The hammer action may be engaged or disengaged as required. Most <b>electric</b> hammer <b>drills</b> are rated (input power) at between 600 and 1100 watts. The efficiency is usually 50-60% i.e. 1000 watts of input is converted into 500-600 watts of output (rotation of the drill and hammering action).|$|R

2500|$|Authorities {{were unable}} to {{determine}} the cause of the explosion, but concluded that it probably occurred while explosives were being mixed. The charred remains of <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>drill</b> with a paint-stirring attachment were found, and it was suggested that a spark from the drill's motor reached the mixture. Other possible theories include the scraping of boots on the floor causing ignition of highly explosive fumes, a cigarette being lit, and sparking from an electrical wire. TEMA later identified the dead as Faye Trentham (38), daughter Tanya Trentham (19), Doris Burns Longmire (38), David Nelce Webb (21, brother of Dan Lee Webb), Sybil Duggan, William Lee Burns, Beatrice Webb (51, mother of Dan Lee Webb), Dixie Freeman, David Parks and his wife Judy, and Albert Kenneth Johnson (52). Authorities found a cache of about 30 to 40 boxes of unexploded fireworks and six 55-gallon steel drums full of chemical explosives in a nearby trailer. Federal firearms agents also found husks eight to ten inches in length and three to four inches in diameter which prompted Polk County sheriffs to speculate that [...] "more than just fireworks" [...] were involved. They were buried in the ground on the farm and later detonated in an open pit in nearby Copperhill having been used as evidence in Webb's trial. A total of 172 cases of fireworks were found. The farm was also found to be guarded with an elaborate security system which consisted of surveillance cameras, electric fences, alarms, guard dogs, and warning signs. Polk County Sheriff Frank Payne told reporters that he thought that they were gearing up for the Fourth of July, and that the explosives could be used by terrorists.|$|E

5000|$|Prior to the 1930s, {{power tools}} were often housed in cast metal {{housings}}. The cast metal housings were heavy, contributing to repetitive use injuries, {{as well as}} conductive - often shocking the user.

25|$|Several {{kinds of}} case {{trimmers}} are available. Die-based trimmers {{have an open}} top, and allow the case to be trimmed with a file during the loading process. Manual trimmers usually have a base that has a shellholder {{at one end and}} a cutting bit at the opposite end, with a locking mechanism to hold the case tight and in alignment with the axis of the cutter, similar to a small lathe. Typically the device is cranked by hand, but sometimes they have attachments to allow the use of a drill or powered screwdriver. Powered case trimmers are also available. They usually consist of <b>a</b> motor (<b>electric</b> <b>drills</b> are sometimes used) and special dies or fittings that hold the case to be trimmed at the appropriate length, letting the motor do the work of trimming.|$|R

In a review of Lines {{which do not}} exist, R. H.

40|$|Coiled tubing in {{combination}} with <b>a</b> downhole <b>electric</b> <b>drilling</b> motor has many advantages. The rotation speed of the drill bit can be precisely controlled. The electric conductors trans-mit downhole data with high speed and allow logging while drilling. One task within the PDT-COIL project was the integration of electric conductors into {{the wall of a}} spoolable fatigue resistant thermoplastic composite tube for <b>electric</b> <b>drilling</b> appli-cations. Up to now no fatigue resistant electric conductor solution has been available to withstand the excessive axial elongation and compression induced by spooling operations. Based on theoretical models and experimental verifications, a new type of highly elastic elec-trical conductor has been developed. A prototype has been industrially produced having 2 kV rated voltage and 20 A continuous current. This cable with a cross section of < 30 mm 2 is able to transfer over 40 kW of electric power and withstands high axial deformations. The main concept is based on synchronous radial contraction of all conductor elements when subjected to axial elongation and bending. Comparative experiments on conventional solid conductors revealed a very high degree of radial flexibility and high tensile capability of the new concept. Survival with up to 40 % elastic tensile strain has been achieved compared to 0. 1 % of conventional annealed copper. The hyperelastic conductor may function as component for energy transmission and also for powering sensors as well as actuators in intelligent composite material systems. Due to its unique axial elasticity, the complete structure can be exposed to high mechanical stress without damaging the embedded electric system...|$|R
30|$|Cool water gelatin was {{prepared}} {{similar to the}} method suggested by Jussila for the preparation of ballistic gelatin [3]. Forty-five percent of the water was at 20 °C. Fifty-five percent of the water was heated to 70 °C. The gelatin {{was added to the}} cool water and mixed by hand until achieving the consistency of mashed potatoes. This was allowed to sit for approximately 5  min. References suggest that allowing the gelatin particles to sit for a few minutes is necessary for 250  Å particles to swell [3]. Next, the warmer water was poured into the gelatin mixture, the psyllium was added and the mixture was stirred for 8  min using a paint stirrer on <b>a</b> handheld <b>electric</b> <b>drill.</b> After pouring into the mold, the mixture was covered with plastic wrap and allowed to cool at room temperature for 20  min. Any foam was then scraped off prior to setting of the gelatin, and the pan was covered with plastic wrap (not in contact with gelatin surface). The bread pan was then placed into the 4 °C refrigerator for at least 24  h (but not more than 36  h) prior to testing.|$|R

40|$|Thermal ice coring {{processes}} {{are accompanied by}} stresses in an ice core; micro-and macro-cracks are formed. Contamination under mechanical and thermal drilling usually penetrates from 5 to 30 mm into the ice core. The quality of ice core acquired by thermal drilling depends on thermal stresses. To improve ice core quality, experimental and theoretical studies have been done. A prototype model of <b>an</b> antifreeze thermal <b>electric</b> <b>drill</b> (ATED) was tested. Temperature distribution in an ice core during thermal drilling was measured with thermocouples. To study temperature and stress distributions in an ice core, a mathematical model was developed. Impacts of ethanol-water solution (EWS) and kerosene on temperature and thermal stresses in an ice core were also studied. The experiments and model simulations have shown that thermal stresses in an ice core are proportional to the ratio of drilling bit length to penetration rate. The maximal thermal stresses in an ice core during thermal drilling exhibit only weak dependence {{on the type of}} borehole liquid.

30|$|The {{sampling}} of the bones {{took place at the}} premises of the friary 2  years after the excavations. Great care was taken to avoid contamination during the field sampling. Laboratory coats, plastic gloves, hairnets and facemasks were used throughout the sampling process. A large sheet of white paper was covered by two layers of Al-foil on top of which the bone was placed. The drill used was a conical drill bit mounted on <b>a</b> Dremel MultiPro® <b>electric</b> <b>drill.</b> The drill bit and the other utensils used for handling the bone samples were rinsed in MilliQ® water and heated to dryness in an ethanol flame before drilling in order to decontaminate the utensils of any Hg possibly present. A small area of bone surface was drilled off down to ca. 1  mm and discarded together with the gloves and the top layer of Al-foil. The utensils were cleaned again in MilliQ water and heated in the ethanol flame. A new sheet of Al-foil was added and new gloves were used. The bone sample was drilled in the decontaminated area without touching the remaining bone surface surrounding the decontaminated area.
