40|$|Noise {{pollution}} {{is an important}} part of the environmental impact of ships. The noise inside the vessel (affecting crew and passengers) has been regulated since a few decades, while the impact of emissions in water on the marine fauna has been under consideration at the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) only in the last few years. No specific effort seems to be in place towards a regulatory framework for external airborne noise emissions from sea going commercial ships. Only the particular cases of inland vessels and pleasure crafts are partially covered by rules. The airborne noise pollution from commercial ships, on the other hand, does affect people living near channels, in coastal areas with intense traffic or near ports, where ships enter and stay at wharf for loading/unloading processes. The actual dimension of the problem is remarked by several cases of complaints sent out by citizens living in the urban areas affected. Within the SILENV project (Ships oriented Innovative soLutions to rEduce Noise & Vibrations, funded by the E. U.) assessment criteria for the <b>airborne</b> <b>noise</b> <b>emitted</b> by sea-going ships have been proposed: the background information, the general criteria at the basis of the formulation, the aims as well as the verification procedure of the proposed limits are discussed in the paper...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} the impact of <b>airborne</b> <b>noise</b> <b>emitted</b> by {{commercial}} ships moored at quay is gaining attention by Regulatory Bodies. The question is often raised by citizens sending complaints to the municipalities of port cities in which the harbour is located inside the town. The problem may be even more important in the case of pleasure crafts accessing protected areas and mooring there. Limit levels for airborne noise emissions started therefore to be fixed in normative as well as contract requirements. In the light of what above, an effective measurement procedure to characterise the noise emissions from ships and compare them to limits plays an important role. The procedure needs to take into account aspects linked to the ship source characteristics (dimensions, complexity, directivity) as well as related to the surrounding environment, which is often represented by the shipyard where the ship is built. The latter aspect includes the presence of obstacles and reflecting surfaces around the ship, as well as significant components of background noise. The paper recalls the background of a measurement procedure that was defined within the project SILENV of the 7 th Framework Programme specifically for the purpose of the characterisation of ships as airborne noise sources and reports a trial application of this procedure to a ship moored at a yard quay. Instrumentation used and data post processing are discussed, together with practical problems encountered and solutions found in order to carry out measurements...|$|E
30|$|Axial {{piston pumps}} are broadly applied in {{industrial}} and mobile applications to convert mechanical energy into fluid power energy [1]. Axial piston pumps are advantageous {{in terms of}} their efficiency, compactness and reliability [2, 3]. The prominent disadvantage is a high noise level. The <b>noise</b> <b>emitted</b> from an axial piston pump can be divided into structure-borne noise, fluid-borne <b>noise</b> and <b>airborne</b> <b>noise</b> [4]. The structure-borne noise is generated by various internal forces and moments, and the fluid-borne noise is produced by flow ripples in the inlet and outlet ports [5]. Both structure-borne noise and fluid-borne noise contribute to the generation of <b>airborne</b> <b>noise.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Noise</b> <b>emitted</b> by {{a vacuum}} cleaner suction unit {{consists}} of <b>airborne</b> and structure-borne <b>noise.</b> The <b>airborne</b> <b>noise</b> is generated mainly by the turbo blower and the structure-borne noise is generated mainly by the driving electric motor. The structure-borne noise depends on the suction unit design and on operating conditions, and is especially distinct at partial flow rates when rotating stall and surge appear. Among geometrical parameters, the statorof the blower and the electric motor, or metal shield if any, have the greatest effect on the structure-borne noise. Therefore, {{in this part of}} the paper, the effects of vibrations of the electric motor structure on the noise characteristics have been measured and analysed at the design and off-design operation. The contribution of structure-borne sound to the total sound pressure level becomes relatively less important at higher flow rates and with a vaned diffuser built-in the blower...|$|R
40|$|The <b>noise</b> <b>emitted</b> from {{information}} technology (IT) machines {{is one of}} the main annoying sound sources in office environments. Although recent research has aimed at reducing the <b>noise</b> <b>emitted</b> by personal computers (PCs) no major effort has been invested with the study of the characteristic and reduction of the <b>noise</b> <b>emitted</b> by PC keyboards. This paper studies the <b>noise</b> <b>emitted</b> by PC keyboards in order to give indications and provide strategies in order to reduce such noise. The main objectives of the research are: 1) suggesting an experimental repeatable way to measure the <b>noise</b> <b>emitted</b> from a keyboard; 2) characterising keyboard noise; 3) identifying possible sources of noise in order to understand the ways of possible intervention. A test rig has been built in order to generate repeatable tapping of the keys which resembles human tapping. Force, acceleration of the key and noise have been recorded and analysed. <b>Noise</b> <b>emitted</b> by different keys and different keyboards have been also compared. The designed test rig has proved to be a reliable tool to measure and study the <b>noise</b> <b>emitted</b> by IT keyboards. The spectral investigation showed that the maximum noise contribution is due to the impact of the key with the base of the keyboard, and to the free oscillation when the key is released. It is also shown that the keyboard structure contributes to the noise radiation...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} various operating systems, developed and implemented at the Athens Tram network {{to reduce the}} <b>airborne</b> <b>noise</b> <b>emitted</b> in the sharp curves of the tramway. From {{the first days of}} the network's operation (Olympic Games 2004), the problem of producing airborne squealing noise in certain sharp curves of the tramway was revealed, with a series of complaints to be recorded from residents in certain urban areas, regarding especially squealing noise emissions introducing annoying peak levels especially during evening & night hours. The problem was treated, initially, by coating the tracks with biodegradable lubricant, at sharp curves, where it appeared that friction phenomena were significant. The coating has been performed manually for some years by maintenance personnel of the network, providing suitable results by the acoustic measurement program. Even though this intervention has produced positive results, as well as alternative technical solutions relating to the installation of mechanisms for automatic lubrication of rails with special friction modifiers, they were proven not to be feasible economically. Therefore an automatic rail wetting system was implied, containing sensors to detect approaching trams, water supply, timer, solenoid valves, pipes and common irrigation vaporizers. The system is quite simple and is implemented using common components of retail trade, many of which are already used in existing irrigation network of the tramway, while the maintenance does not require trained staff, it is performed by the staff of TRAM SA and in connection with the maintenance of the irrigation network. The results of recently executed detailed noise monitoring programs, performed by the University of Thessaly (Faculty of Civil Engineering), are presented for both implemented technical solutions that indicate significant reduction in squealing noise emissions...|$|E

40|$|The {{sources and}} paths by which noise enters the cabin {{of a small}} single engine {{aircraft}} were determined {{through a combination of}} flight and laboratory tests. The primary sources of noise were found to be <b>airborne</b> <b>noise</b> from the propeller and engine casing, <b>airborne</b> <b>noise</b> from the engine exhaust, structureborne noise from the engine/propeller combination and noise associated with air flow over the fuselage. For the propeller, the primary airborne paths were through the firewall, windshield and roof. For the engine, the most important airborne path was through the firewall. Exhaust noise was found to enter the cabin primarily through the panels {{in the vicinity of the}} exhaust outlet although exhaust noise entering the cabin through the firewall is a distinct possibility. A number of noise control techniques were tried, including firewall stiffening to reduce engine and propeller <b>airborne</b> <b>noise,</b> to stage isolators and engine mounting spider stiffening to reduce structure-borne noise, and wheel well covers to reduce air flow noise...|$|R

When a pin slides on the disc, the <b>airborne</b> <b>noise</b> is generated and subsequently a sound signal is obtained. These signals, for various sets of experiments, were recorded using a digital microphone. A Matlab code was developed and employed to estimate the noise parameters from the recorded sound. Noise parameters including values of voltage RMS, noise counts and amplitudes of dominant frequencies were used to analyse the variation in the disc wear at different time intervals. These parameters were found to be effective in the determination of the wear damage evaluation under different loads without lubrication...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the <b>airborne</b> <b>noise</b> reduction of agricultural tractor cabs. The characteristics of the noise radiated from a non-cab-equipped tractor have been evaluated and used in conjunction with the classical theories of airborne sound transmission loss to predict the <b>airborne</b> <b>noise</b> reductions of tractor cabs. An experimental cab has beep constructed and used to evaluate these predictions. The theoretical and experimental <b>airborne</b> <b>noise</b> reductions do not show a good agreement. This {{has been shown to be}} due to two ressons. Firstly, there are anomalies in the classical airborne sound transmission loss theory whereby the theoretical and experimental sound transmission loss spectra do not show good agreement. Secondly, one-dimensional standing wave resonances in the cab cavity have been shown to give rise to an irregular plateau in the experimental <b>airborne</b> <b>noise</b> reduction spectra. Anomalies have been shown to exist between airborne sound transmission loss theory and reverberant room transmission loss measurements. These have arisen because the theory has not hitherto considered panel flexure. Modifications have been introduced which take account of panel flexure and these show that the dependence of classical theory on the angle of incident excitation is false and angular dependence occurs on the transmitted side of the panel, giving rise to a coincidence effect on the transmitted side which is independent of the angle of incidence. These modifications give rise to complete qualitative explanation of the shape of empirical airborne sound transmission loss spectra. Quantitative modifications have not been introduced because of lack of information regarding the angular nature of the transmitted waves...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of the {{transmission}} of <b>airborne</b> <b>noise</b> into an aircraft fuselage, a mathematical model is presented for the transmission of <b>airborne</b> <b>noise</b> into a stiffened cylindrical shell. The stiffeners are longitudinal stringers and are modeled as discrete structural elements. The numerical cases examined were typical of a narrow-bodied jet transport fuselage. The stringers appeared to raise the cylinder transmission loss in the mass-controlled region, although they produced dips at the stringer resonances. The ring-frequency dip in transmission loss, which is characteristic of monocoque shells, was found to still be present. There appeared to be a small increase in transmission loss as the number of stringers was increased. The effect of high damping was also investigated...|$|R

These duct systems contain air handling units, which produce noise during their operation. This noise is transmitted through the ducts in both axial and transverse direction. This noise is transferred from the ducts to the surrounding atmosphere which is undesirable. The <b>noise</b> <b>emitted</b> depends on the structural properties of the duct {{as well as the}} acoustic properties of the medium. Current research work studies the structural dynamic properties of ducts and also the <b>noise</b> <b>emitted</b> from the ducts.
