30|$|A {{total of}} nine formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) lepidic type lung {{adenocarcinoma}} tissues {{were selected from}} our archives, three tissues each in <b>AIS,</b> <b>MIA</b> and LPIA. The tumor and peripheral non-tumor cells in these FFPE tissues were collected with laser microdissection (LMD). Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), protein compositions were compared {{with respect to the}} peptide separation profiles among tumors collected from three types of tissues, <b>AIS,</b> <b>MIA</b> and LPIA.

40|$|Background and objective: Advances in {{high-resolution}} {{computed tomography}} (CT) scanning {{have increased the}} detection of small ground-glass opacity (GGO) nodules and also allowed such images to be investigated in detail. However, {{it is difficult to}} differentiate atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) from adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) with CT, even at follow-up, because they share many similar CT manifestations. While AAH is thought to be a precursor or even an early-stage lesion of lung adenocarcinoma, and the stepwise progression from <b>AAH</b> to <b>AIS</b> is thought to be reasonable. Therefore, the hypothesis that the attenuation of GGO is increased gradually from <b>AAH</b> to <b>AIS</b> is proposed. The aim {{of this study was to}} distinguish <b>AAH</b> from <b>AIS</b> with CT attenuation in patients with pure GGO nodules.  Methods: Between January 2010 and December 2012, the CT findings in terms of the greatest diameter and mean CT attenuation (HU) were reviewed and correlated with pathology in 56 patients with AAH (n= 21) and non-mucinous AIS (n= 38) by two independent observers. All the 59 lesions were pure GGO nodules with size of 2 cm or smaller. To determine variability of measuring CT attenuation, we calculated the 95 % confidence interval (CI) for the limits of agreement by using Bland-Altman analysis. Student t test was used to compare <b>AAH</b> and <b>AIS</b> in terms of diameter and CT attenuation. And receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the optimal cut-off value of mean CT attenuation for differentiating <b>AAH</b> from <b>AIS</b> and obtain the diagnostic value. Two-tailed P value of less than 0. 05 was considered to be significant.  Results: For the manually measured CT attenuation, the 95 %CI for the limits of agreement was - 40 HU, 50 HU for inter-observer variability. Although there was significant difference in nodule diameter between <b>AAH</b> and <b>AIS</b> (P= 0. 046), the overlap was considerable. The mean CT attenuation was (- 718 ± 53) HU (95 %CI: - 822, - 604) for AAH, which was significantly smaller than (- 600 ± 35) HU (95 %CI: - 669, - 531) for AIS (P= 0. 013). The area under curve (AUC) from ROC was 0. 903 for differentiating <b>AAH</b> from <b>AIS,</b> and the cut-off value of - 632 HU was optimal for differentiation between <b>AAH</b> and <b>AIS,</b> with sensitivity of 0. 79, specificity of 0. 95, and accuracy of 0. 85.  Conclusion: The mean CT attenuation can help the radiological differentiation between <b>AAH</b> and <b>AIS...</b>|$|R

40|$|This article proposes {{codes for}} the primary tumor {{categories}} of adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) and a uniform way to measure tumor size in part-solid tumors for the eighth edition of the tumor, node, and metastasis classification of lung cancer. In 2011, new entities of <b>AIS,</b> <b>MIA,</b> and lepidic predominant adenocarcinoma were defined, and they were later incorporated into the 2015 World Health Organization classification of lung cancer. To fit these entities into the T component of the staging system, the Tis category is proposed for AIS, with Tis (AIS) specified {{if it is to}} be distinguished from squamous cell carcinoma in situ (SCIS), which is to be designated Tis (SCIS). We also propose that MIA be classified as T 1 mi. Furthermore, the use of the invasive size for T descriptor size follows a recommendation made in three editions of the Union for International Cancer Control tumor, node, and metastasis supplement since 2003. For tumor size, the greatest dimension should be reported both clinically and pathologically. In nonmucinous lung adenocarcinomas, the computed tomography (CT) findings of ground glass versus solid opacities tend to correspond respectively to lepidic versus invasive patterns seen pathologically. However, this correlation is not absolute; so when CT features suggest nonmucinous <b>AIS,</b> <b>MIA,</b> and lepidic predominant adenocarcinoma, the suspected diagnosis and clinical staging should be regarded as a preliminary assessment that is subject to revision after pathologic evaluation of resected specimens. The ability to predict invasive versus noninvasive size on the basis of solid versus ground glass components is not applicable to mucinous <b>AIS,</b> <b>MIA,</b> or invasive mucinous adenocarcinomas because they generally show solid nodules or consolidation on CT. 0 SCOPUS: re. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
30|$|Former {{localized}} BAC (≦ 2 cm) lesions {{have been}} histologically classified into types A, B and C by Noguchi et al. based on finding of local cancer progression [38]. These lesions, now identified as <b>AIS,</b> <b>MIA</b> or LPIA usually show focal ground-glass opacity (GGO) on chest HRCT (high resolution computed tomography). Generally, AIS shows pure GGO, and representative MIA and LPIA lesions show GGO with some intratumoral areas of collapsed shadow suggesting invasion. There are multiple studies [39, 40] describing that limited lung resection including wedge resection or segmentectomy can cure early adenocarcinomas showing pure GGO. From histologic and radiologic points of view, it is hypothesized that preinvasive AIS progresses to the invasive lesions MIA and LPIA sequentially. Postsurgical 5 -year recurrence-free survival rates for <b>AIS</b> and <b>MIA</b> are 100  %, while these for LPIA ranged 71.9 to 93.8  % [8 – 10].|$|R
30|$|In 2011, the new {{pathologic}} {{classification of}} lung adenocarcinoma was {{proposed by the}} International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC), the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS) [7]. In the new classification, the concept of adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) were newly introduced and the term bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC) was abolished. Additionally, invasive adenocarcinomas were categorized into 6 subtypes, lepidic, acinar, papillary, micropapillary, solid, and variants, according to the predominant histologic pattern. Both <b>AIS</b> and <b>MIA</b> were defined as tumors[*]≤[*] 3  cm in size. AIS is a preinvasive lesion showing pure lepidic growth without invasion. MIA is also lepidic predominant tumor but with[*]≤[*] 5  mm invasion. LPIA is an invasive adenocarcinoma showing former nonmucinous BAC pattern with[*]>[*] 5  mm invasion. These 3 lepidic type adenocarcinomas are speculated to show step-wise progression from <b>AIS,</b> <b>MIA,</b> to LPIA. After complete resection of <b>AIS</b> or <b>MIA,</b> usually 100  % of recurrence-free 5 -year survival can be obtained [7], while some recurrent cases are found after resection of LPIA [8 – 10]. Since postoperative prognoses between the <b>AIS</b> plus <b>MIA</b> group and LPIA are different, differential protein expressions associated with invasiveness of cancer cells in each subtype should play important roles to determine local recurrences and survivals. However, precise proteomic analyses using individual cells in these early adenocarcinomas {{have not yet been}} performed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report performing proteomic analysis using micro-dissected early phase lung adenocarcinoma cells.|$|R
30|$|The {{molecular}} biological background predisposing {{the worse}} prognosis of LPIA compared with <b>AIS</b> and <b>MIA</b> {{may be in}} part due to the forms of altered protein expressions found in our present study. Proteins appearing in the step from <b>AIS</b> to <b>MIA</b> are probably important at the initial step of microinvasion. As LPIA prepares characteristics of matured lung cancer, it is reasonable that LPIA expresses a variety of proteins associated with cancer invasion. We believe that some of these proteins are candidates for molecular target therapy to suppress local invasion or distant metastases.|$|R
40|$|Background and {{objective}} The development of image technology {{has led to}} increasing detection of pulmonary small nodules year by year, but the determination of their nature before operation is difficult. This clinical study aimed to investigate the necessity and feasibility of surgical resection of pulmonary small nodules through a minimally invasive approach and the operational manner of {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC). Methods The clinical data of 129 cases with pulmonary small nodule of 10 mm or less in diameter were retrospectively analyzed in our hospital from December 2013 to November 2016. Thin-section computed tomography (CT) was performed on all cases with 129 pulmonary small nodules. CT-guided hook-wire precise localization was performed on 21 cases. Lobectomy, wedge resection, and segmentectomy with lymph node dissection might be performed in patients according to physical condition. Results Results of the pathological examination of 37 solid pulmonary nodules (SPNs) revealed 3 primary squamous cell lung cancers, 3 invasive adenocarcinomas (IAs), 2 metastatic cancers, 2 small cell lung cancers (SCLCs), 16 hamartomas, and 12 nonspecific chronic inflammations. The results of pathological examination of 49 mixed ground glass opacities revealed 19 IAs, 6 micro invasive adenocarcinomas (MIAs), 4 adenocarcinomas in situ (AIS), 1 atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH), 1 SCLC, and 18 nonspecific chronic inflammations. The results of pathological examination of 43 pure ground glass opacities revealed 19 <b>AIS,</b> 6 <b>MIAs,</b> 6 <b>IA,</b> 6 AAHs, and 6 nonspecific chronic inflammations. Wedge resection under video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) was performed in patients with 52 benign pulmonary small nodules. Lobectomy and systematic lymph node dissection under VATS were performed in 33 patients with NSCLC. Segmentectomy with selective lymph node dissection, wedge resection, and selective lymph node dissection under VATS were performed in six patients with NSCLC. Two patients received secondary lobectomy and systematic lymph node dissection under VATS because of intraoperative frozen pathologic error that happened in six cases. Two cases of N 2 lymph node metastasis were found in patients with SPN of IA. Conclusion Positive surgical treatment should be taken on patients with persistent pulmonary small nodules, especially ground glass opacity, because they have a high rate of malignant lesions. During the perioperative period, surgeons should fully inform the patients and family members that error exist in frozen pathologic results to avoid medical disputes...|$|R
40|$|Aberrant DNA {{methylation}} {{is common}} in lung adenocarcinoma, but its timing in the phases of tumor development is largely unknown. Delineating when abnormal DNA methylation arises may {{provide insight into the}} natural history of lung adenocarcinoma and the role that DNA methylation alterations play in tumor formation. We used MethyLight, a sensitive real-time PCR-based quantitative method, to analyze DNA methylation levels at 15 CpG islands that are frequently methylated in lung adenocarcinoma and that we had flagged as potential markers for non-invasive detection. We also used two repeat probes as indicators of global DNA hypomethylation. We examined DNA methylation in 249 tissue samples from 93 subjects, spanning the putative spectrum of peripheral lung adenocarcinoma development: histologically normal adjacent non-tumor lung, atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH), adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS, formerly known as bronchioloalveolar carcinoma), and invasive lung adenocarcinoma. Comparison of DNA methylation levels between the lesion types suggests that DNA hypermethylation of distinct loci occurs at different time points during the development of lung adenocarcinoma. DNA methylation at CDKN 2 A ex 2 and PTPRN 2 is already significantly elevated in AAH, while CpG islands at 2 C 35, EYA 4, HOXA 1, HOXA 11, NEUROD 1, NEUROD 2 and TMEFF 2 are significantly hypermethylated in AIS. In contrast, hypermethylation at CDH 13, CDX 2, OPCML, RASSF 1, SFRP 1 and TWIST 1 and global DNA hypomethylation appear to be present predominantly in invasive cancer. The gradual increase in DNA methylation seen for numerous loci in progressively more transformed lesions supports the model in which <b>AAH</b> and <b>AIS</b> are sequential stages in the development of lung adenocarcinoma. The demarcation of DNA methylation changes characteristic for <b>AAH,</b> <b>AIS</b> and adenocarcinoma begins to lay out a possible roadmap for aberrant DNA methylation events in tumor development. In addition, it identifies which DNA methylation changes might be used as molecular markers for the detection of preinvasive lesions...|$|R
30|$|Proteins {{expressed}} increasingly {{along the}} disease stages from AIS to LPIA, {{which might be}} considered to be disease progression-related, included were alpha-enolase (ENO 1), plectin (PLEC), major vault protein (MVP), heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein M (HNRNPM), 14 - 3 - 3 protein sigma (SFN), lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 1 (LPCAT 1), anterior gradient protein 2 homolog (AGR 2), phospholipase D 3 (PLD 3), hypoxia up-regulated protein 1 (HYOU 1), fatty acid synthase (FASN), programmed cell death protein 6 (PDCD 6), and ethylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase (ECHDC 1). Among proteins expressed characteristically in the <b>AIS</b> and <b>MIA</b> disease stages, leukotriene A- 4 hydrolase (LTA 4 H) in AIS and cellular retinoic acid-binding protein 2 (CRABP 2) in MIA, respectively, were representative.

Enhanced AGR 2 expression has been observed in most human adenocarcinomas, including pancreas, lung, ovary, breast and prostate, frequently suggesting its association with tumor progression and metastasis [13, 14, 26 – 30]. The HYOU 1 protein (hypoxia up-regulated 1, alternatively known as Orp 150), belonging to the heat shock protein 70 family, demonstrated its increased expression in prostate, bladder and invasive breast cancer, is suggested to be associated with tumor invasiveness [31].|$|R

We examined paraffin-embedded tissue sections from 28 cases of ADC with BAC pattern as well as 7 benign lung lesions and 9 normal lung tissue samples for chromosomal aneuploidy by in situ hybridization using digoxigenin-labelled probes for chromosomes 1 and X. Of the 28 ADC with BAC pattern, 17 (61 %) were diploid and 11 (39 %) were aneuploid. Of the 17 diploid cases, 7 (41 %) were male and 10 (59 %) were female and of the 11 aneuploid cases, 2 (18 %) were male, 9 (82 %) were female. Regarding the cell type, 24 (86 %) were adenocarcinomas in situ (AIS) so called BAC and minimally invasive ADC (MIA), and 4 cases (14 %) were invasive ADC. Of the 12 cases each of <b>AIS</b> and <b>MIA,</b> 9 (75 %) and 8 (67 %) had diploid pattern respectively. Of the 4 invasive ADC cases, all had aneuploid pattern. Seventeen cases (71 %) with T 1 tumor size (> 0 mm∼≤ 30 mm), had diploid and 4 cases (100 %) with T 2 tumor size (> 30 mm ≤ 70 mm) had aneuploid pattern. Statistical analyses showed that nuclear diploidy was significantly correlated with <b>AIS</b> and <b>MIA</b> tumor types while aneuploidy correlated with invasive ADC type (P= 0. 025). Also a significant correlation was found between ploidy and tumor size (P= 0. 033). In conclusion, {{these findings suggest that}} DNA ploidy analysis provides useful information for the assessment of cellular kinetics and reflect histopathological subtypes in ADC with BAC pattern that are destined to behave aggressively...|$|R

40|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) 2004 {{classification}} includes 3 {{categories of}} pulmonary preneoplastic lesions, including squamous dysplasia and {{carcinoma in situ}} (CIS) for squamous cell carcinoma, atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) {{for the majority of}} adenocarcinomas and diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia (DIPNECH) for carcinoids. The distinction of the 3 grades of squamous dysplasia and CIS is mainly based on the degree by which the basal cell zone is expanded, the degree of cellular atypia and the level of mitoses. The category AAH consists of a proliferation of atypical epithelial cells with Clara cells or type 2 pneumocyte features. They grow along the alveolar septae in a lepidic fashion, sometimes reaching into the terminal bronchioles.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Pulmonary {{ground-glass}} nodules (GGNs) are occasionally {{diagnosed as}} invasive adenocarcinomas. This study aimed {{to evaluate the}} clinicopathological features of patients with pulmonary GGNs to identify factors predictive of pathological invasion. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 101 pulmonary GGNs resected between July 2006 and November 2013 and pathologically classified them as adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS; n = 47), minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA; n = 30), or invasive adenocarcinoma (I-ADC; n = 24). The age, sex, smoking history, tumor size, and computed tomography (CT) attenuation of the 3 groups were compared. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were performed to identify factors that could predict the presence of pathologically invasive adenocarcinomas. RESULTS: Tumor size was significantly larger in the MIA and I-ADC groups than in the AIS group. CT attenuation was significantly greater in the I-ADC group than in the <b>AIS</b> and <b>MIA</b> groups. In ROC curve analyses, the sensitivity and specificity of tumor size (cutoff, 11 mm) were 95. 8 % and 46. 8 %, respectively, and those for CT attenuation (cutoff, - 680 HU) were 95. 8 % and 35. 1 %, respectively; the areas under the curve (AUC) were 0. 75 and 0. 77, respectively. A combination of tumor size and CT attenuation (cutoffs of 11 mm and - 680 HU for tumor size and CT attenuation, respectively) yielded in a sensitivity and specificity of 91. 7 % and 71. 4 %, respectively, with an AUC of 0. 82. CONCLUSIONS: Tumor size and CT attenuation were predictive factors of pathological invasiveness for pulmonary GGNs.

Ground-glass opacity nodule {{is one of the}} special types of pulmonary nodules that is confirmed to be closely associated with early stage of lung cancer. Very little is known about solitary ground-glass opacity nodules (SGGNs). In this study, we analyzed the clinical, pathological, and radiological characteristics of SGGNs on HRCT. Methods: A total of 95 resected SGGNs were evaluated with HRCT scan. The clinical, pathological, and radiological characteristics of these cases were analyzed. Results: Eighty-one adenocarcinoma and 14 benign nodules were observed. The nodules included 12 (15 %) adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), 14 (17 %) minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA), and 55 (68 %) invasive adenocarcinoma (IA). No patients with recurrence till date have been identified. The positive expression rates of anaplastic lymphoma kinase and ROS- 1 (proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase ROS) were only 2. 5 % and 8. 6 %, respectively. The specificity and accuracy of HRCT of invasive lung adenocarcinoma were 85. 2 % and 87. 4 %. The standard uptake values of only two patients determined by 18 F-FDG positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) were above 2. 5.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} efficacy of a bisphosphonate, pain and extent of joint damage in the monosodium iodoacetate (MIA) model of painful degenerative joint disease. MethodsZoledronate treatment was initiated prior to and at various times following model induction, including late time points representing advanced disease. Radiographic and histological structural parameters were correlated with pain as measured by weight bearing. ResultsIntraarticular (<b>IA)</b> <b>MIA</b> resulted in a progressive loss of bone mineral density (BMD) and chondrocytes, thinning of cartilage, loss of proteoglycan, resorption of calcified cartilage and subchondral bone, as well as pain. This was completely prevented by pre-emptive chronic zoledronate treatment with joint sections being histologically indistinguishable from saline-injected controls. When initiation of treatment was delayed efficacy was reduced. In animals with advanced joint degeneration, treatment partially restored BMD and had a significant, but limited, effect on pain. We confirmed these radiographic and behavioral findings in the medial meniscal tear model. To understand the mechanism-of-action of zoledronate we investigated an early time point 4 days post-model induction when chondrocytes were histologically viable, with minor loss of proteoglycan and generalized synovitis. Osteoclast-mediated resorption of the calcified cartilage was observed and was prevented by two doses of zoledronate.

40|$|Introduction:Adenocarcinoma is {{the most}} common histologic type of lung cancer. To address {{advances}} in oncology, molecular biology, pathology, radiology, and surgery of lung adenocarcinoma, an international multidisciplinary classification was sponsored by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, American Thoracic Society, and European Respiratory Society. This new adenocarcinoma classification is needed to provide uniform terminology and diagnostic criteria, especially for bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC), the overall approach to small nonresection cancer specimens, and for multidisciplinary strategic management of tissue for molecular and immunohistochemical studies. Methods:An international core panel of experts representing all three societies was formed with oncologists/pulmonologists, pathologists, radiologists, molecular biologists, and thoracic surgeons. A systematic review was performed under the guidance of the American Thoracic Society Documents Development and Implementation Committee. The search strategy identified 11, 368 citations of which 312 articles met specified eligibility criteria and were retrieved for full text review. A series of meetings were held to discuss the development of the new classification, to develop the recommendations, and to write the current document. Recommendations for key questions were graded by strength and quality of the evidence according to the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. Results:The classification addresses both resection specimens, and small biopsies and cytology. The terms BAC and mixed subtype adenocarcinoma are no longer used. For resection specimens, new concepts are introduced such as adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) for small solitary adenocarcinomas with either pure lepidic growth (AIS) or predominant lepidic growth with ≤ 5 mm invasion (MIA) to define patients who, if they undergo complete resection, will have 100 % or near 100 % disease-specific survival, respectively. <b>AIS</b> and <b>MIA</b> are usually nonmucinous but rarely may be mucinous. Invasive adenocarcinomas are classified by predominant pattern after using comprehensive histologic subtyping with lepidic (formerly most mixed subtype tumors with nonmucinous BAC), acinar, papillary, and solid patterns; micropapillary is added as a new histologic subtype. Variants include invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma (formerly mucinous BAC), colloid, fetal, and enteric adenocarcinoma. This classification provides guidance for small biopsies and cytology specimens, as approximately 70 % of lung cancers are diagnosed in such samples. Non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs), in patients with advanced-stage disease, are to be classified into more specific types such as adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma, whenever possible for several reasons: (1) adenocarcinoma or NSCLC not otherwise specified should be tested for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations as the presence of these mutations is predictive of responsiveness to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, (2) adenocarcinoma histology is a strong predictor for improved outcome with pemetrexed therapy compared with squamous cell carcinoma, and (3) potential life-threatening hemorrhage may occur in patients with squamous cell carcinoma who receive bevacizumab. If the tumor cannot be classified based on light microscopy alone, special studies such as immunohistochemistry and/or mucin stains should be applied to classify the tumor further. Use of the term NSCLC not otherwise specified should be minimized. Conclusions:This new classification strategy is based on a multidisciplinary approach to diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma that incorporates clinical, molecular, radiologic, and surgical issues, but it is primarily based on histology. This classification is intended to support clinical practice, and research investigation and clinical trials. As EGFR mutation is a validated predictive marker for response and progression-free survival with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in advanced lung adenocarcinoma, we recommend that patients with advanced adenocarcinomas be tested for EGFR mutation. This has implications for strategic management of tissue, particularly for small biopsies and cytology samples, to maximize high-quality tissue available for molecular studies. Potential impact for tumor, node, and metastasis staging include adjustment of the size T factor according to only the invasive component (1) pathologically in invasive tumors with lepidic areas or (2) radiologically by measuring the solid component of part-solid nodules...|$|R
