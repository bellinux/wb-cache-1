40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the relationships among various learner characteristics and reading achievement, {{as measured by the}} Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test (FCAT). Using a multiple regression, the independent variables grade, gender, ethnicity, <b>and</b> motivation <b>to</b> <b>read</b> were used <b>to</b> predict the dependent variable, reading achievement. Participants in this study consisted of 585 students from nine elementary, nine middle, and nine high schools across three districts in Florida. Using archival data from a database composed by the Florida Center for Reading Research, the FCAT <b>and</b> Motivation <b>to</b> <b>Read</b> Profile were used <b>to</b> compute <b>reading</b> achievement <b>and</b> motivation <b>to</b> <b>read,</b> respectively. FCAT reading achievement was measured by the participant 2 ̆ 7 s Sunshine State Standard score in <b>reading,</b> <b>and</b> motivation <b>to</b> <b>read</b> was measured by student responses on the 4 -point likert scale of the Motivation <b>to</b> <b>Read</b> Profile. The findings indicate that grade level <b>and</b> motivation <b>to</b> <b>read</b> were significant positive predictors of FCAT reading achievement, and African American and Hispanic ethnicity status were significant inverse predictors of FCAT reading achievement. African American ethnicity status was the strongest predictor of FCAT <b>reading</b> achievement <b>and</b> motivation <b>to</b> <b>read</b> was the second strongest. Gender and mixed ethnicity status did not significantly predict FCAT reading achievement. Results of this study support the findings of previous research...|$|R

25|$|The {{existence}} of partnership minyanim {{was preceded by}} an opinion by Modern Orthodox Rabbi Mendel Shapiro in 2001, subsequently joined by Bar-Ilan University Talmud Professor Rabbi Daniel Sperber, claiming that halakha (Jewish law) permits Orthodox women to be called to, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> from, the Torah on Shabbat under certain conditions. These opinions rely on earlier authorities including the Magen Avraham. Dr. Joel B.

Elizabeth Fry documented the conditions that prevailed at Newgate prison, where the ladies' section was overcrowded with women and children, {{some of whom had}} not even received a trial. The inmates did their own cooking and washing in the small cells in which they slept on straw. In 1816, Fry was able to found a prison school for the children who were imprisoned with their parents.

25|$|The 11th-century eastern Qur'anic {{manuscript}} {{contains the}} 20th juz’ (section) of a Qurʼan that originally consisted of 30 parts. The arrangement into 30 parts {{corresponds to the}} number of days in the month of Ramadan, during which the Muslim is obliged to fast <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> through the whole of the Qurʼan. Other sections or fragments of this magnificent manuscript lie scattered in various collections all over the world. A Turkish note ascribes the Qurʼan to the hand of the Caliph Ali, Muhammad’s cousin and son-in-law, and thus demonstrates the high significance of this manuscript. The text is written in Eastern Kufic, a monumental script that was developed in Iran in the late 10th century. The writing and the illumination of the manuscript bear witness to the great artistic skills of the calligrapher and the illustrator. The manuscript is at the Bavarian State Library in Munich, Germany. Out of seven complete or nearly complete semi-Kufic Qur'ans from {{before the end of the}} eleventh century, four contain a verse count. Although admittedly a small sample,it does suggest that the use of a verse count was a prevalent and quite deeply rooted practice in semi-Kufic Qur'ans between ca. 950 and ca. 1100.|$|E

In particular, Johnson promised to [...] "correct what is corrupt, and {{to explain what}} is obscure". He would accomplish this by relying on [...] "a careful collation of all the oldest copies" [...] <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> [...] "the same story in the very book which Shakespeare consulted". Unlike other editors who [...] "slight their predecessors", Johnson claimed that [...] "all that is valuable will be adopted from every commentator, that posterity may consider it as including all the rest, and exhibiting whatever is hitherto known of the great father of the English drama".

500|$|Fielding's rival, Samuel Richardson, {{declared}} in February 1752 {{that the novel}} [...] "is as dead {{as if it had}} been published forty years ago, as to sale." [...] Previously, he attacked the [...] "lowness" [...] of the novel and claimed that [...] "his brawls, his jarrs, his gaols, his spunging-houses, are all drawn from what he has seen and known." [...] However, Richardson also claimed to have never read Amelia but, years later, Sir Walter Scott argued that Amelia was [...] "a continuation of Tom Jones." [...] The second edition of Amelia was criticized for its various changes to the text. Some aspects of the revision, such as removing of Fielding's Universal Register Office, were seen as [...] "damaging" [...] the work, although they were intended to remove anachronisms. In The Bible in Spain (1843) George Borrow, describing his first visit to Lisbon, wrote: [...] "Let travellers devote one entire morning to inspecting the Arcos and the Mai das Agoas, after which they may repair to the English church and cemetery, Pere-la-chaise in miniature, where, if they be of England, they may well be excused if they kiss the cold tomb, as I did, of the author of Amelia, the most singular genius which their island ever produced, whose works it has long been the fashion to abuse in public <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> in secret." ...|$|E
500|$|There {{she gives}} birth to Sigurd. Sigurd is raised by Regin, a cunning old man, and when he grows to manhood he asks for a horse from King Elf. Elf bids him choose the one he likes best, and Sigurd takes the best horse, and names it Grani. Sigurd is now urged by Regin to attack Fafnir, a dragon who guards a hoard of gold. This {{treasure}} is a curse to all who possess it. Fafnir, Regin says, was originally a human being; indeed, the dragon was Regin's brother and thus the gold rightfully belongs to Regin. He tries and fails to forge an adequate sword for Sigurd, but Sigurd produces the shattered fragments of Odin's sword, which he has inherited from Sigmund, and from these fragments Regin forges a mighty sword, named [...] "the Wrath" [...] by Sigurd. Sigurd {{makes his way to}} Fafnir's lair, kills him, drinks his blood, and roasts and eats his heart. This gives him the power to understand the voices of birds <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the hearts of men. He now understands that Regin intends to kill him, and so he kills Regin and takes Fafnir's treasure for himself. On his journey homeward Sigurd comes across an unearthly blaze on the slopes of Hindfell. He rides straight into it and comes unharmed {{to the heart of the}} fire, where he finds a beautiful sleeping woman clad in armour. He wakes her, and she tells him that she is Brynhild, a handmaiden of Odin whom he has left here as a punishment for disobedience. They pledge themselves to each other, Sigurd places a ring from Fafnir's hoard on her finger, and he leaves.|$|E

500|$|The La Pérouse's {{expedition}} {{was last}} seen on 10 March 1788 as it left Botany Bay in New Holland, Australia. It had been observed by ships of the First Fleet of convicts from England {{under the command of}} Arthur Phillip who was just leaving for Port Jackson after deciding that Botany Bay was unsuitable for settlement. In 1791 France’s National Assembly decided to send out a search mission led by Bruni d’Entrecasteaux. With Thouin’s recommendation Delahaye, who was at this time principal assistant gardener at the botany school of the Jardin du Roi, was invited to join the expedition's team of [...] "savants" [...] (more than ten scientists, engineers and artists) as the expedition's gardener. Thouin described Delahaye as “ ... strong, vigorous and well-suited for voyages. Gentle, honest and of an exact probity. Active, hard-working and passionately loving his calling. Knowing by theory and by practice the processes of gardening and knowing very well the plants cultivated in the Jardin du Roi.” Delahaye's annual salary on the expedition, paid by the navy, was 1000 livres (24 livres were equivalent to the gold coin, the Louis d'or), and he was reimbursed 1,236 livres for equipment. As a lowly gardener he was not permitted accommodation with the savants or to dine with the officers. Throughout the expedition he worked with diligence and honesty, keeping meticulous horticultural notes in his journal. Thouin wanted Delahaye to improve his schooling on the expedition and recommended that Delahaye study Latin, try to translate the works of Linnaeus <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> and write in French. His reading included Pierre Bulliard’s Dictionairre Elementaire de Botanique (1783) and the works of Henri-Louis Duhamel du Monceau (1700–1782) who published works on forestry, naval architecture (especially relating to timber), agriculture, fruit tree cultivation, seed conservation and insect pests affecting seeds. Delahaye arrived in Brest, ready for the ship's departure, with four cases of garden seeds, one of fruit tree nuts, one containing gardening tools and another gardener’s clothing.|$|E
