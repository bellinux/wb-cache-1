500|$|When the {{railways}} were nationalised in 1948, services at Avonmouth Dock {{came under the}} aegis of the Western Region of British Railways. By 1955, service levels had decreased slightly to 28 trains per day from Bristol and 29 return, but the services were at regular intervals. Passenger numbers however dropped sharply in 1961 as the result of a fare increase, and so in 1962 a new reduced timetable was enacted, which lost more passengers. A year later in 1963, the Beeching report suggested the complete withdrawal of services along the line, but ultimately only those beyond Severn Beach or via Henbury were withdrawn. Goods services from the station ended on 20 June 1966, the same day that the station was renamed [...] "Avonmouth". The bay platform was taken out of use and the land later taken for industrial buildings. From 17 July 1967 all staffing was withdrawn from stations along the line, including Avonmouth, with tickets issued by the train guard. The station buildings on the island platform survived into the 1970s, as did the footbridge, but with the exception of the parcels office, all were later demolished. The parcels office was in use in 2006 as a hairdressing salon.

50|$|The {{station was}} built by the Wakefield, Pontefract and Goole Railway, a {{constituent}} company of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway; the route through here opening to traffic in 1848. Later in its history the station was absorbed into the LMSR London Midland and Scottish Railway before it {{became part of the}} British Railways network in 1948. Today the station is operated by Northern. The station was until 2014 home to one of the last sets of electrical wheel boom level crossing gates in the world; Castleford Cutsyke Junction, Urlay Nook (near Darlington) and Hensall were the final serving gates after the removal of the gates at Brough and Redcar Central. Hensall Signal box (located adjacent the south platform) has recently been awarded grade II listing status along with 25 other historical signal boxes. The list, announced by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, includes signal boxes dating from late-Victorian times. Despite its listed status, it was taken out of operational use in May 2014, when control of signalling in the area passed to the signalling centre at Ferrybridge. The boom gates were also replaced by standard <b>automatic</b> <b>lifting</b> barriers as part of the project.|$|E

40|$|Component-based and model-based reasonings are key {{concepts}} {{to address the}} increasing complexity of real-time systems. Bounding abstraction theories allow to create efficiently analyzable models {{that can be used}} to give temporal or functional guarantees on non-deterministic and non-monotone implementations. Likewise, bounding refinement theories allow to create implementations that adhere to temporal or functional properties of specification models. For systems in which jitter plays a major role, both best-case and worst-case bounding models are needed. In this paper we present a bounding abstraction-refinement theory for real-time systems.

40|$|There {{has been}} {{significant}} progress transforming semi-structured data about places into knowledge graphs {{that can be}} used in a wide variety of geographic information systems such as digital gazetteers or geographic information re-trieval systems. For instance, in addition to information about events, actors, and objects, DBpedia contains data about hundreds of thousands of places from Wikipedia and publishes it as Linked Data. Repositories that store data about places are among the most interlinked hubs on the Linked Data cloud. However, most content about places resides in unstructured natural language text, and therefore it is not captured in these knowledge graphs. Instead, place representations are limited to facts such as their population counts, geographic locations, and relations to other entities, e. g., headquarters of companies or historical figures. In this paper we present a novel method to enrich the in-formation stored about places in knowledge graphs using thematic signatures that are derived from unstructured text through the process of topic mod-eling. As proof-of-concept, we demonstrate that this enables the automatic categorization of articles into place types defined in the DBpedia ontology (e. g., mountain), and also provides a mechanism to infer relationships between place types that are not captured in existing ontologies. This method can also be used to uncover miscategorized places, which is a common problem arising from the <b>automatic</b> <b>lifting</b> of unstructured and semi-structured data. 1...|$|E

40|$|Europe Combined Terminals is a {{container}} transhipment {{company in the}} port of Rotterdam. Since the establishment in 1966, ECT grew fast. In the mean time ECT became {{the biggest and most}} advanced container transhipment company in Europe. ECT has two locations of transhipment in the port of Rotterdam. The first location is in the 'Eemhaven', the 'Home Terminal'. The second location of transhipment is the 'Maasvlakte', the 'Delta Terminal'. In the 'Eemshaven' the container transhipment takes place in a conventional way with manned equipment. The 'Delta Terminal' contains four terminals. The Delta Multi User terminal is a conventional terminal. The remaining three terminals (the Delta Dedicated North terminal, the Delta Dedicated East terminal and the Delta Dedicated West terminal) use a mainly automatic system. The quay transport and the stack are fully automatic. The landside still uses manned equipment. The partly automatic system that is described above does not always perform at the required level. The performance is expressed in terms like port time of vessels, the quay crane productivity, the waiting time of the truck drivers etcetera. Alternative terminal concepts have to be designed {{in order to be able}} to reach te desired level. The setting during this research is the second 'Maasvlakte'. The improved terminal concept design is studied here from a stacking system point of view. The various stacking systems used in the container transhipment and also new concepts of stacking systems are studied. By means of a multi criteria analysis, three stacking systems are selected. These systems are: the Autmatic Stacking (ASC) Crane System, the Overhead Bridge Crane (OHBC) System and the high bay warehouse. After this a comparison has been made between the ASC-system and the OHBC-system with use of the criteria use of space, transfer capacity, flexibility, reliability and costs. The comparison not only contains the two systems, but also the various lay-outs (particulary the placing of the transferpoints) of the systems. Because of the variety of concepts and the superficial research of these concepts, it was not possible to compare the high bay warehouse with the ASC- and OHBC-system on the same level. A quick scan has been made of the various concepts of the high stacking system. The comparison between the ASC-system and the OHBC-system shows that there is no obvious preference for one of the systems above. Higher cost of ground shows an increasive attractiviness of the OHBC-system. The comparison does show clearly that a stack lay-out with the transferpoints as a transport lane in the stack, offers great benefits in relation to the present lay-out with the transferpoints on top of the stackarea's. The lay-out with the transferpoints in the stacking area, stacks more containers per substack than the present lay-out. The waterside and landside transport takes place with the <b>Automatic</b> <b>Lifting</b> Vehicle (self unloading Automatic Guided Vehicle). Rough it was found that the all the concepts of the high bay warehouse are much more space effective than the ASC- and OHBC-system.
