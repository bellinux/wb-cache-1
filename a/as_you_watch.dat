500|$|Chopra's final {{release of}} the year saw her reprising her role as Roma in the second {{installment}} of the Don franchise, Don 2. Although the film received mixed reviews, Chopra's performance earned positive feedback from critics. According to The Express Tribune, [...] "Chopra... {{seems to be the}} perfect choice for an action heroine. <b>As</b> <b>you</b> <b>watch</b> her effortlessly beat up some thugs in the movie, you come to the realisation that she may be the first proper female action hero in Bollywood." [...] Don 2 was a major success in India and overseas, earning over [...] worldwide.|$|E
2500|$|Mark Kermode, in The Observer, labeled Pan's Labyrinth as {{the best}} film of 2006, {{describing}} it as [...] "an epic, poetic vision in which the grim realities of war are matched and mirrored by a descent into an underworld populated by fearsomely beautiful monsters". Stephanie Zacharek wrote that the film [...] "works on so many levels {{that it seems to}} change shape even <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>watch</b> it", and Jim Emerson called the film [...] "a fairy tale of such potency and awesome beauty that it reconnects the adult imagination to the primal thrill and horror of the stories that held us spellbound as children". Roger Ebert reviewed the film after his surgery and put it on his Great Movies list on 27 August 2007; when he compiled his belated top ten films of 2006, Pan's Labyrinth was #1, with him stating [...] "But even in a good year I'm unable to see everything. And I'm still not finished with my 2006 discoveries. I'm still looking at more 2007 movies, too, and that list will run as usual in late December. Nothing I am likely to see, however, is likely to change my conviction that the year's best film was Pan's Labyrinth." [...] The New Yorkers Anthony Lane took special note of the film's sound design, saying it [...] "discards any hint of the ethereal by turning up the volume on small, supercharged noises: the creak of the Captain's leather gloves... the nighttime complaints of floorboard and rafter...." ...|$|E

60|$|The lynx settles {{himself in}} the snow, with all four feet close together, ready for a spring. <b>As</b> <b>you</b> <b>watch</b> and wonder, a screech rings out through the woods, so sharp and fierce that no rabbit's nerves can stand it close at hand and be still.

60|$|Images {{also differ}} from sensations as regards their effects.

50|$|This novel had {{a second}} season, in which some of the {{teenagers}} made a further military service at a higher level.

60|$|You {{are more}} curious than he, {{or you want}} the big cat's skin to take home with you. You steal away towards the cry, past the little commoosie, or shelter, that you made hastily at sundown when the trail ended. There, with your back to the fire and the commoosie between, the light does not dazzle your eyes; you can trace the shadows {{creeping}} in and out stealthily among the underbrush. But if Upweekis is there--and he probably is--you do not see him. He is a shadow among the shadows. Only there is this difference: shadows move no bushes. <b>As</b> <b>you</b> <b>watch,</b> a fir-tip stirs; a bit of snow drops down. You gaze intently at the spot. Then out of the deep shadow two living coals are suddenly kindled. They grow larger and larger, glowing, flashing, burning holes into your eyes till you brush them swiftly with your hand. A shiver runs over you, for {{to look into the}} eyes of a lynx at night, when the light catches them, is a scary experience. Your rifle jumps to position; the glowing coals are quenched on the instant. Then, when your eyes have blinked the fascination out of them, the shadows go creeping in and out again, and Upweekis is lost amongst them.|$|E
60|$|It is the meeting-place of East and West. The {{very new}} rubs {{shoulders}} with the immeasurably old. And {{if you have}} not found the romance you expected you have come upon something singularly intriguing. All these strange people live close to each other, with different languages and different thoughts; they believe in different gods and they have different values; two passions alone they share, love and hunger. And somehow <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>watch</b> them you have an impression of extraordinary vitality. Though the air is so soft and the sky so blue, you have, I know not why, a feeling of something hotly passionate that beats like a throbbing pulse through the crowd. Though the native policeman at the corner, standing on a platform, with a white club to direct the traffic, gives the scene an air of respectability, you cannot but feel that it is a respectability only of the surface; a little below there is darkness and mystery. It gives you just that thrill, with a little catch at the heart, that you have when at night in the forest the silence trembles on a sudden with the low, insistent beating of a drum. You are all expectant of I know not what.|$|E
6000|$|The {{birds on}} the island never got used to him. His oddities tickled them every day, {{as if they were}} quite new, though it was really the birds that were new. They came out of the eggs daily, and laughed at him at once, then off they soon flew to be humans, and other birds came out of other eggs, and so it went on forever. The crafty mother-birds, when they tired of sitting on their eggs, used to get the young one to break their shells a day before the right time by {{whispering}} to them that now was their chance to see Peter washing or drinking or eating. Thousands gathered round him daily to watch him do these things, just <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>watch</b> the peacocks, and they screamed with delight when he lifted the crusts they flung him with his hands instead of in the usual way with the mouth. All his food was brought to him from the Gardens at Solomon's orders by the birds. He would not eat worms or insects (which they thought very silly of him), so they brought him bread in their beaks. Thus, when you cry out, [...] "Greedy! Greedy!" [...] to the bird that flies away with the big crust, you know now that you ought not to do this, for he is very likely taking it to Peter Pan.|$|E
60|$|But {{why was it}} {{that these}} {{helpless}} men were not destroyed by the Russians?

They were the Cossacks, who hung round us like wolves round the flock.|$|R

"It {{was a good}} device, {{and quickly}} carried into effect," [...] Earl Talbot said; [...] "though it was well that the man-at-arms next to <b>you</b> was <b>watching</b> <b>you,</b> just <b>as</b> <b>you</b> had <b>watched</b> his captain; else it must have gone hard with you.

6000|$|... 62. Now I {{have first}} traced for you the {{relations}} of the creature we are examining to those beneath it and above, to the bat and to the falcon. But {{you will find that}} it has still others to entirely another world. <b>As</b> <b>you</b> <b>watch</b> it glance and skim over the surface of the waters, has it never struck you what relation it bears to the creatures that glance and glide under their surface? Fly-catchers, some of them, also,--fly-catchers in the same manner, with wide mouth; while in motion the bird almost exactly combines the dart of the trout with the dash of the dolphin, to the rounded forehead and projecting muzzle of which its own bullet head and bill exactly correspond. In its plunge, if you watch it bathing, you may see it dip its breast just as much under the water as a porpoise shows its back above. You can only rightly describe the bird by the resemblances, and images of what it seems to have changed from,--then adding the fantastic and beautiful contrast of the unimaginable change. It is an owl that has been trained by the Graces. It is a bat that loves the morning light. It is the aërial reflection of a dolphin. It is the tender domestication of a trout.|$|E

Deep {{is the rest of}} feeling with you, in this way, that I'm watched, for the time, only <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>watch</b> me. It has all stopped, and I can stop. How can I make you understand what it is for me that there isn't at last a creature any more in sight, that the wood darkens about me, that the sounds drop and the relief goes on; what can it mean for you even that I've given myself up to not caring whether or no, amongst others, I'm missed and spoken of? It does help my strange case, in fine, as you see, to let you keep me here; but I should have found still more what I was in need of if I had only found, instead of you, him whom I had in mind. He is as much better than you as you are than everyone else."

[...] "I parted with him, some way from here, some time ago. I had found him in one of the gardens with Lady John; after which we came away from her together. We strolled a little and talked, but I knew what he really wanted. He wanted to find you, and I told him he would probably do so at tea on the terrace. It was visibly with that idea--to return to the house--that he left me." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{remember}} her quite distinctly at this time. The light that slanted through the oriel of St. Dives choir was wont to fall very tenderly on her beautiful head with its stacked masses of deerskin-colored hair, {{on the low}} black arches of her brows, and to deepen the pretty fringes that shaded her eyes of Genoa velvet.
