5|$|Lionhead Studios used Michael Bratman's belief–desire–intention {{model to}} {{simulate}} creatures' learning {{and decision making}} processes. A creature forms an intention by combining desires, opinions, and beliefs. Beliefs <b>are</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> lists that store data about various world objects. Desires are goals the creature wants to fulfill, expressed as simplified perceptrons. Opinions describe ways of satisfying a desire using decision trees. For each desire, the creature selects the belief with the best opinion, thus forming an intention or goal.|$|E

5|$|Similar to xenon, neon content {{observed}} in samples of volcanic gases is enriched in 20Ne, {{as well as}} nucleogenic 21Ne, relative to 22Ne content. The neon isotopic content of these mantle-derived samples represents a non-atmospheric source of neon. The 20Ne-enriched components <b>are</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> exotic primordial rare gas components in the Earth, possibly representing solar neon. Elevated 20Ne abundances are found in diamonds, further suggesting a solar neon reservoir in the Earth.|$|E
5|$|Solid waste {{management}} {{is one of}} key compelling issues facing Gazans today. These challenges <b>are</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> several factors; the lack of investment in environmental systems, less attention was given to environmental projects, {{and the absence of}} law enforcement and the tendency towards crisis management. One of the main aspects of this problem is the huge quantities of rubble and debris generated as a result of Israeli bombardments.|$|E

5|$|The {{variations}} {{between the}} AADT and the ASDT traffic volumes <b>are</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> {{the fact that}} the motorway carries certain tourist traffic from Hungary to the Croatian motorway network and ultimately to the Adriatic Sea. On average the motorway carries 15% increased volume of traffic during summer months. As the Hungarian M6 motorway is gradually extended towards the Croatian border and the A5 motorway's northern terminus, the number of tourists traveling along this route in summer months is increasing.|$|E
5|$|Traffic is {{regularly}} counted and reported by Hrvatske autoceste, the operator of the motorway, and {{is published by}} Hrvatske ceste. Variations between AADT and average summer daily traffic (ASDT) traffic volumes <b>are</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> {{the fact that the}} motorway carries substantial tourist traffic to the Adriatic Sea resorts during the summer. On average, the A5 motorway carries 14% more ASDT than AADT. The largest increase, 15%, of ASDT relative to AADT is observed on the Đakovo–Sredanci section.|$|E
5|$|Variations between AADT {{and average}} summer daily traffic (ASDT) traffic volumes <b>are</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> {{the fact that}} the {{motorway}} carries substantial tourist traffic to the Adriatic Sea resorts along the Istria peninsula. On average, the A9 motorway carries 218% more ASDT than AADT. The largest increase of the ASDT relative to the AADT is observed on the Nova VasVišnjan section, at 229%. BINA Istra expects the motorway to carry more than 20,000 vehicles per day during peak tourist season periods.|$|E

5|$|Various woods {{differ in}} their {{susceptibility}} to termite attack; the differences <b>are</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> such factors as moisture content, hardness, and resin and lignin content. In one study, the drywood termite Cryptotermes brevis strongly preferred poplar and maple woods to other woods that were generally rejected by the termite colony. These preferences may in part have represented conditioned or learned behaviour.|$|E
5|$|A plot by {{some members}} of the {{imperial}} government to restore him was discovered in December 947 and the conspirators mutilated and publicly humiliated. Stephen died at Methymna on Easter Sunday, 963. John Skylitzes claims that Stephen was poisoned by order of the Empress Theophano as part of her efforts to protect the rights to the throne of her sons Basil II and Constantine VIII, by eliminating other possible claimants to the throne. It should, however, be noted that several deaths of the extended imperial family at the time <b>are</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> Theophano by hostile sources, usually by poison.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{variation}} {{on the theme of}} players, [...] (Musée de Picardie), has <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> de Vos based on its similarity with the work in Stockholm.
