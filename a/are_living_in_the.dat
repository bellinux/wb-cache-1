5|$|In the afterlife, {{in which}} Oceanic Flight 815 does not crash on the Island, Faraday has a {{different}} background. Daniel was allowed to pursue his passion for music, and never trained in physics. After overhearing Eloise trying to persuade Desmond to stop pursuing Penelope (Sonya Walger), Faraday approaches Desmond and shares his theory of the timeline being altered. He tells Desmond that he recently saw a red-haired woman he strongly felt he already knew and loved. Daniel states after the encounter, he {{made a series of}} notes in his journal which a mathematician has identified as advanced quantum mechanics, a topic he knows nothing about. Daniel shows his notes, and hypothesises that the world as he and Desmond are experiencing is not their correct path. Faraday then tells him Penelope is his half-sister and where Desmond can find her. Later, Faraday meets Charlotte at his benefit concert, but they do not yet realize they are in the afterlife. Daniel then takes the stage with DriveShaft to play as Charlotte watches from the crowd. It is later implied that both Eloise and Desmond are both aware that they <b>are</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afterlife. Eloise convinces Desmond to let Faraday live out the rest of his afterlife, since Faraday was never allowed to live the life he wanted in his past, and Eloise was never allowed to spend time with her son.|$|E

500|$|There is {{a strong}} {{tradition}} of [...] "world ages" [...] in Maya literature, but the record has been distorted, leaving several possibilities open to interpretation. According to the Popol Vuh, a compilation of the creation accounts of the K'iche' Maya of the Colonial-era highlands, we <b>are</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fourth world. The Popol Vuh describes the gods first creating three failed worlds, followed by a successful fourth world in which humanity was placed. In the Maya Long Count, the previous world ended after 13 b'ak'tuns, or roughly 5,125 years. The Long Count's [...] "zero date" [...] was set {{at a point in}} the past marking {{the end of the third}} world and the beginning of the current one, which corresponds to 11 August 3114BC in the proleptic Gregorian calendar. This means that the fourth world reached the end of its 13th b'ak'tun, or Maya date 13.0.0.0.0, on 21 December 2012. In 1957, Mayanist and astronomer Maud Worcester Makemson wrote that [...] "the completion of a Great Period of 13 b'ak'tuns would have been of the utmost significance to the Maya." [...] In 1966, Michael D. Coe wrote in The Maya that [...] "there is a suggestion... that Armageddon would overtake the degenerate peoples of the world and all creation on the final day of the 13th [...] Thus... our present universe [...] be annihilated ... when the Great Cycle of the Long Count reaches completion." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{horse is}} {{believed}} to have been first domesticated somewhere in the Eurasian Steppe. [...] Never have all the horses in Mongolia been domesticated at once; rather, wild and domesticated horses coexisted and interbred, so verifiably [...] "true" [...] wild blood no longer exists in the Mongol horses of today. [...] However, although not considered true wild horses in the same sense as Przewalski's horse, some feral Mongolian horses browse the steppe alongside their semiferal domesticated kin. [...] Unlike the mustangs that roam the West in the United States, which are categorized as a non-native species, feral Mongol horses <b>are</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same manner and place as where their ancestors had run and lived for hundreds of thousands of years. [...] Occasionally, the nomads capture feral horses to add to their herds.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Yitzchak of Akko {{then goes}} on to explain a value of 49,000 years, but does not proceed with the multiplication, nor the {{reduction}} of 49,0000 to 42,000, which is Kaplan's own interpretation. Kaplan calculates {{the age of the universe}} to be 15,340,500,000 years old. His reasoning was as follows: as the Midrash states, [...] "A thousand years in your sight are but as yesterday" [...] (Psalm 90:4); a physical year contains 365 ¼ days, which, if multiplied by 1000 would give the length of a divine year as 365,250 physical years; if we <b>are</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last, 7th Sabbatical cycle, that would mean that the creation as it described in the Bible happened 42,000 divine years ago; to convert this figure to physical years it should be multiplied by 365,250; this gives the result 15,340,500,000 years.|$|E

2500|$|Security and {{intelligence}} expert Martin Reardon has described ISIL's purpose as being to psychologically [...] "break" [...] those under its control, [...] " [...] {{so as to}} ensure their absolute allegiance through fear and intimidation," [...] while generating, [...] "outright hate and vengeance" [...] among its enemies. Jason Burke, a journalist writing on Salafi jihadism, has written that ISIL's goal is to [...] "terrorize, mobilize [...] polarize". Its efforts to terrorise are intended to intimidate civilian populations and force governments of the target enemy [...] "to make rash decisions that they otherwise would not choose". It aims to mobilise its supporters by motivating them with, for example, spectacular deadly attacks deep in Western territory (such as the November 2015 Paris attacks), to polarise by driving Muslim populations – particularly in the West – away from their governments, thus increasing the appeal of ISIL's self-proclaimed caliphate among them, and to: [...] "Eliminate neutral parties through either absorption or elimination". Journalist Rukmini Maria Callimachi also emphasises ISIL's interest in polarization or in eliminating what it calls the [...] "grey zone" [...] between the black (non-Muslims) and white (ISIL). [...] "The gray is moderate Muslims who <b>are</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West and are happy and feel engaged in the society here." ...|$|E
