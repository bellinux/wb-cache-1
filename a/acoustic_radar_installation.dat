40|$|A {{comparison}} is made between <b>acoustic</b> <b>radar</b> echoes and conventional meteorological {{data obtained from}} the WKY tower, {{for the purpose of}} better understanding the relationships between <b>acoustic</b> <b>radar</b> echoes and boundary layer processes. Two thunderstorm outflow cases are presented and compared to both <b>acoustic</b> <b>radar</b> data and Charba's gust front model. The <b>acoustic</b> <b>radar</b> echoes reveal the boundary between warm and cold air and other areas of mixing and strong thermal gradient quite well. The thunderstorm outflow of 27 June 1972 is found to compare with in most respects to Charba's gust front model. The major difference is the complete separation of the head from the main body of cold air, probably caused by erosion of the area behind the head by mixing with the ambient air. Two cases of nocturnal inversions caused by advection of warmer air aloft are presented. It is found that areas of turbulent mixing or strong thermal gradient can be identified quite easily in the <b>acoustic</b> <b>radar</b> record...|$|R
