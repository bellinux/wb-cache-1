The final version {{is available from the}} American Physical Society via [URL] events developed during uniaxial compression of cortical bones cut from femurs of developing pigs of several ages (4, 12, and 20 weeks) generate avalanches.

Such behavior indicates the absence of characteristic scales and suggests avalanche criticality. The statistical distributions of energies and waiting times depend on the pig age and indicate that bones become stronger, but less ductile, with increasing age.

40|$|Acoustic {{emission}} {{has been}} measured and statistical characteristics have been analyzed during the stress-induced collapse of porous berlinite, AlPO 4, containing up to 50 vol% porosity. Stress collapse {{occurs in a}} series of individual events (avalanches), and each avalanche leads to a jerk in sample compression with corresponding acoustic emission (AE) signals. The distribution of AE <b>avalanche</b> <b>energies</b> can be approximately described by a power law over a large stress interval. We observed several collapse mechanisms whereby less porous minerals show the superposition of independent jerks, which were not related to the major collapse at the failure stress. In highly porous berlinite (40 % and 50 %) an increase of the energy emission occurred near the failure point. In contrast, the less porous samples did not show such an increase in energy emission. Instead, in the near vicinity of the main failure point they showed a reduction in the energy exponent to ~ 1. 4, which is consistent with the value reported for compressed porous systems displaying critical behavior. This indicated that a critical avalanche regime with a lack of precursor events occurs. In this case, all preceding large events were false alarms and unrelated to the main failure event. Our results identify a method to use pico-seismicity detection of foreshocks to warn of mine collapse before the main failure collapse occurs, which can be applied for highly porous materials only.

40|$|Recent {{observations}} {{have established}} that the magnetosphere is a system of natural complexity. The co-existence of multi-scale structures such as auroral arcs, turbulent convective flows, and scale-free distributions of energy perturbations has lacked a unified explanation, although there is strong {{reason to believe that}} they all stem from a common base of physics. In this paper we show that a slow but turbulent convection leads to the formation of multi-scale current filaments reminiscent of auroral arcs. The process involves an interplay between random shuffling of field lines and dissipation of magnetic energy on sub-MHD scales. As the filament system reaches a critical level of complexity, local current disruption can trigger <b>avalanches</b> of <b>energy</b> release of varying sizes, leading to scale-free distributions over energy perturbation, power, and event duration. A long-term memory effect is observed whereby the filament system replicates itself after each avalanche. The results support the view that that the classical and inverse cascades operate simultaneously in the magnetosphere. In the former, the high Reynolds-number plasma flow disintegrate into turbulence through successive breakdowns; in the latter, the interactions of small-scale flow eddies with the magnetic field can self-organize into elongated current filaments and large-scale <b>energy</b> <b>avalanches</b> mimicking the substorm.

40|$|Rock-ice {{avalanches}} {{larger than}} 1 x 106 m 3 are high magnitude low frequency events {{that may occur}} in all ice-covered high mountain areas {{around the world and}} can cause extensive damage if they reach populated regions. The temporal and spatial evolution of the seismic signature from two events was analyzed and recordings at selected stations were compared to numerical model results of avalanche propagation. The first event is a rock-ice avalanche from Iliamna volcano in Alaska which serves as a 'natural laboratory' with simple geometric conditions. The second one originated on Aoraki/Mt. Cook, New Zealand Southern Alps, and is characterized by a much more complex topography. A dynamic numerical model was used to calculate total avalanche momentum, total kinetic energy, and total frictional work rate, amongst other parameters. These three parameters correlate with characteristics of the seismic signature such as duration and signal envelopes, while other parameters such as flow depths, flow path and deposition geometry are well in agreement with observations. The total frictional work rate shows the best correlation with the absolute seismic amplitude suggesting that it may be used as an independent model evaluation criterion and in certain cases as model calibration parameter. The good fit is likely because the total frictional work rate represents the <b>avalanche’s</b> <b>energy</b> loss rate, part of which is captured by the seismometer. Deviations between corresponding calculated and measured parameters result from site and path effects which affect the recorded seismic signal, or indicate deficiencies of the numerical model.

In this mode, the on-pixel photodetector itself {{will be used to}} harvest the light energy from the environment and make it available to active pixels. A very interesting feature about our proposed approach is that during a frame capture, critical energy is mainly required for starting-up activity.

In contrast to other early designs of energy harvesting image sensors, our scheme uses the photodetector itself for power generation.

However, low power operation is needed for portable systems requiring extended system life-time. With highly efficient batteries, this dilemma might be resolved. Unfortunately, {{the amount of energy}} available is still quite low. This problem is even more critical for applications with limited accessibility such as sensor networks, biomedical implants and embedded micro-sensors, since human intervention for energy replenishment implies higher operational cost.

Typically achieved in materials incorporating rare-earth ions, exploiting their rich density of available electronic state transitions, non-parametric UC systems are often placed in categories including excited state absorption, photon <b>avalanche</b> and <b>energy</b> transfer. The latter, energy transfer up-conversion achieves nonlinear excitation of chromophores {{as a consequence of}} non-radiative resonance energy transfer (RET) events, through coupling with neighboring sensitizer ions. Being susceptible to the local electromagnetic environment, the mechanism of RET is known to be influenced by surrounding matter, underscoring the importance of similar channels for media control within UC materials. By developing the principles of two-center UC, a fully quantized representation of local electronic structure and electrodynamics is extended through the introduction of a mediator species – a vicinal, nonabsorbing chromophore. This theory underpins a new application of the medium-modified energy transfer theory to three-center UC. The present report then considers an alternative up-conversion mechanism in which pairs of identical donors transfer energy to the acceptor species, promoting two-photon excitation and shorter wavelength emission. The mechanism for this three-center system proves to be significantly influenced by a fourth, essentially passive chromophore. Investigations of the influence of this mediator, in improving or inhibiting RET, determine parameters that can be modified to improve the UC efficiency.

This has significant implications for coronal heating in that it provides for energy dissipation with a trigger mechanism. The instability of the unstable thread follows the evolution determined in many earlier investigations. However, once one stable thread is disrupted, it coalesces with a neighbouring thread and this process disrupts other nearby threads. Coalescence with these disrupted threads then occurs leading to the disruption of yet more threads as the <b>avalanche</b> develops. Magnetic <b>energy</b> is released in discrete bursts as the surrounding stable threads are disrupted. The volume integrated heating, {{as a function of}} time, shows short spikes suggesting that the temporal form of the heating is more like that of nanoflares than of constant heating.
