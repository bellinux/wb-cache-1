5|$|A heart {{condition}} uncommon to the breed is tetralogy of Fallot, {{which is more}} common in the Keeshond and English Bulldog breeds relatively. It is actually a combination of up to four conditions, including the previously mentioned pulmonary valve stenosis, with a secondary condition of right ventricular hypertrophy. The other conditions are ventricular septal defect which is a defect or hole in the wall of the heart between the two ventricles and the aorta which carries the blood from the left to {{the right side of the}} heart can be mis-positioned. The effect on the dog depends on the severity of the condition, and can range from a heart murmur through to reduced <b>activity</b> <b>levels</b> to death. Symptoms in puppies are generally a failure to grow and a reduced tolerance for exercise. Active treatment is effective in around 50% of cases.|$|E
5|$|In saurischian dinosaurs, higher metabolisms were {{supported}} by {{the evolution of the}} avian respiratory system, characterized by an extensive system of air sacs that extended the lungs and invaded many of the bones in the skeleton, making them hollow. Early avian-style respiratory systems with air sacs may have been capable of sustaining higher <b>activity</b> <b>levels</b> than mammals of similar size and build could sustain. In addition to providing a very efficient supply of oxygen, the rapid airflow would have been an effective cooling mechanism, which is essential for animals that are active but too large {{to get rid of all}} the excess heat through their skin.|$|E

30|$|We {{define the}} <b>activity</b> <b>level</b> {{to be the}} {{fraction}} of time that an individual is active within a moving window of length L. The <b>activity</b> <b>level</b> increases when individuals become active and decreases as soon as team members stop moving. The window length L determines {{the slope of the}} <b>activity</b> <b>level</b> and the minimum time that an individual needs to be active to reach the maximum <b>activity</b> <b>level.</b> The value of L also affects the temporal resolution, a small value requires individuals to change their activity closer in time, whereas a larger value allows for a delay between activity changes, as the <b>activity</b> <b>level</b> is calculated over a longer period.|$|R
40|$|Gender {{differences}} in preschool children's <b>activity</b> <b>level</b> were investigated using archival data, consisting of temperament questionnaires and an open-ended interview. Parents of 63 preschool students {{ranging in age}} from 3 to 6 years completed the Temperament Assessment Battery for Children (TABC; Martin, 1988), the Colorado Childhood Temperament Inventory (Rowe & Plomin, 1977), and the Children's Behavior Questionnaire (Rothbart, Ahadi, Hershey, 1994). Teachers completed the TABC. The Structured Temperament Interview (Teglasi, 1994) was administered to both teachers and parents. Results support conceptualization of <b>activity</b> <b>level</b> as comprised of two factors: motoric movement and modulation. Mean gender differences were due to {{differences in}} frequency of boys and girls at the extremes of <b>activity</b> <b>level</b> continua. Qualitative analyses indicate parents and teachers conceptualize <b>activity</b> <b>level</b> similarly for both genders, and that low modulation of <b>activity</b> <b>level</b> is maladaptive in preschool children. Implications for the measurement of <b>activity</b> <b>level</b> and intervention development are discussed...|$|R
5|$|It is conjectured that a {{progressive}} decline in hormone levels with age is partially responsible for weakened immune responses in aging individuals. Conversely, some hormones are {{regulated by the}} immune system, notably thyroid hormone activity. The age-related decline in immune function is also related to decreasing vitamin D levels in the elderly. As people age, two things happen that negatively affect their vitamin D levels. First, they stay indoors more due to decreased <b>activity</b> <b>levels.</b> This means that they get less sun and therefore produce less cholecalciferol via UVB radiation. Second, as a person ages the skin becomes less adept at producing vitamin D.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is calculated}} by a dietitian for each child. Age, weight, <b>activity</b> <b>levels,</b> culture and food preferences all affect the meal plan. First, the energy requirements are set at 80–90% of the recommended daily amounts (RDA) for the child's age (the high-fat diet requires less energy to process than a typical high-carbohydrate diet). Highly active children {{or those with}} muscle spasticity require more calories than this; immobile children require less. The ketogenic ratio of the diet compares the weight of fat to the combined weight of carbohydrate and protein. This is typically 4:1, but children who are younger than 18months, older than 12years, or who are obese may be started on a 3:1 ratio. Fat is energy-rich, with 9kcal/g (38kJ/g) compared to 4kcal/g (17kJ/g) for carbohydrate or protein, so portions on the ketogenic diet are smaller than normal. The quantity of fat in the diet can be calculated from the overall energy requirements and the chosen ketogenic ratio. Next, the protein levels are set to allow for growth and body maintenance, and are around 1g protein for each kg of body weight. Lastly, the amount of carbohydrate is set according to what allowance is left while maintaining the chosen ratio. Any carbohydrate in medications or supplements must be subtracted from this allowance. The total daily amount of fat, protein and carbohydrate is then evenly divided across the meals.|$|E

40|$|The Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) {{define the}} daily {{requirement}} for energy as the Estimated Energy Requirement (EER).

However, physical <b>activity</b> <b>level</b> {{is often difficult to}} measure and accurate assessment of energy expenditure not always possible. We provide an easy way to calculate daily EERs for adults based on physical <b>activity</b> <b>level.</b> We use the EER equations of the DRI Committee and provide a spreadsheet template for the calculation of physical <b>activity</b> <b>level.</b> This technique accounts for all factors and measurements to determine physical <b>activity</b> <b>level</b> and energy expended from daily physical activity.

40|$|Objective: Discuss the {{relationship}} between the impulsivity, eating behavior and <b>activity</b> <b>level</b> and the body mass index (BMI). Method: Test 147 female college students with the impulsivity questionnaire (BIS- 11 and BIS/BAS), Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DBEQ), Sitting Time Scale (STS) and Exercising Time Scale (ETS). Results: (1) The correlation analysis indicates that BMI and impulsivity (r = 0. 43 and 0. 52) have a significant positive correlation with the sitting time (r = 0. 61) and a significant negative correlation with the <b>activity</b> <b>level</b> (r= − 0. 49). (2) The path analysis indicates that the reward sensitivity directly affects BMI and indirectly affects BMI through the <b>activity</b> <b>level</b> as well; the eating behavior has an insignificantly direct impact on BMI, because its impact is generated by the intermediary role of induced diet. Conclusion: (1) The impulsivity, eating behavior and <b>activity</b> <b>level</b> are closely related to BMI; (2) the <b>activity</b> <b>level,</b> sitting time and induced diet play an intermediary role between the impulsivity and BMI...|$|R

Binary logistic regression was used to determine possible risk factors associated with physical <b>activity</b> <b>level</b> and selected by the backward elimination process. Interactive effects of the variables were verifi ed in the fi nal model by means of the odds ratio for physical activity level> 1. 4. RESULTS: The fi nal model included sex, income {{and level of}} education. Male individuals who only fi nished elementary school and earned less than four Brazilian minimum wages per month were the most likely to show physical <b>activity</b> <b>level</b> ≥ 1. 4. The odds ratio estimate indicated that men were fi ve times more likely to show physical <b>activity</b> <b>level</b> ≥ 1. 4 than women.

Another aim was to describe whether exposure to torture, self-rated health measures, and ADL ability were related to their satisfaction with daily occupations and <b>activity</b> <b>level.</b> Methods: A total of 43 asylum seekers at baseline and 17 at follow-up were included. The questionnaires Satisfaction with Daily Occupations, Major Depression Inventory, WHO- 5 Wellbeing, Pain Detect, a questionnaire covering torture, and basic social information were used as well as Assessment of Motor and Process Skills. Results: The results showed a low level of satisfaction with daily occupations at both baseline and follow-up. There was no statistically significant change in satisfaction or <b>activity</b> <b>level</b> between baseline and the follow-up. Associations between AMPS process skills -education, worst pain and <b>activity</b> <b>level</b> -were present at baseline, as was a relationship between AMPS process skills and satisfaction. At follow-up, associations between WHO- 5 and satisfaction and <b>activity</b> <b>level</b> and between MDI scores and <b>activity</b> <b>level</b> were found. Conclusion: Asylum seekers experience a low level of satisfaction with daily occupations, both at arrival and after 10 months in an asylum centre.
