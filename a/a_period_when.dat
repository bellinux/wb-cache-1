50|$|The {{centrifuge}} was activated as soon {{as possible}} once the satellite was in orbit and stabilized at 10−3g (10 mm/s²). The centrifuge applied gravity stimuli in cycles. Each cycle lasted about 8 minutes, and consisted of the following: <b>a</b> 1-minute <b>period</b> without acceleration, <b>an</b> 8-second <b>period</b> <b>when</b> rotation slowly began, 14 seconds of constant 0.6 g (6 m/s²), <b>an</b> 8-second <b>period</b> <b>when</b> rotation slowly stopped, and <b>a</b> 6-minute <b>period</b> <b>when</b> aftereffects of rotation could be measured. Cycles were performed every 30 minutes during the initial 3 hours in orbit, and less frequently {{during the rest of the}} flight.|$|R

5|$|Goya {{worked on}} The Disasters of War during <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>when</b> he was {{producing}} images more {{for his own}} satisfaction than for any contemporary audience. His work came to rely less on historical incidents than his own imagination. Many of the later plates contain fantastical motifs which {{can be seen as}} a return to the imagery of the Caprichos. In this, he is relying on visual clues derived from his inner life, rather than anything that could be recognised from real events or settings.|$|E
5|$|Howard and {{her husband}} were part of a circle of artists, writers and {{designers}} who were interested in visual images, in language and in the book arts. One close associate was the graphic designer Allan Fleming, whose Martlet Press published Twenty-Eight Drawings by Barbara Howard in 1970, <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>when</b> she was drawing the figure. The Canadian wood engraver Rosemary Kilbourn, a close friend since art college, taught Howard to carve images that could be printed in conjunction with text.|$|E
5|$|Jaws is a 1974 {{novel by}} American writer Peter Benchley. It {{tells the story}} of a great white shark that preys upon a small resort town and the voyage of three men trying to kill it. The novel grows out of Benchley's {{interest}} in shark attacks after he learned about the exploits of shark fisherman Frank Mundus in 1964. Doubleday commissioned him to write the novel in 1971, <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>when</b> Benchley struggled as a freelance journalist.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the debate}} in the 2008 {{legislative}} session centered on crafting a budget for the 2008–2010 biennium, <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>when</b> the state was projected to encounter a shortfall of nearly $1 billion. Beshear expressed surprise that the budget issues consumed so much of the Assembly's time during the session, but admitted that the legislature had become much more independent of the governor than it was when he was a legislator two decades earlier. He listed early childhood education and expanded health care for children among the priorities that he was unable to address in the session.|$|E
5|$|Murasaki {{was born}} at <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>when</b> Japan was {{becoming}} more isolated, after missions to China had ended and a stronger national culture was emerging. In the 9th and 10th centuries, Japanese gradually became a written language {{through the development of}} kana, a syllabary based on abbreviations of Chinese characters. In Murasaki's lifetime men continued to write in Chinese, the language of government, but kana became the written language of noblewomen, setting the foundation for unique forms of Japanese literature.|$|E
5|$|Poulton was {{a staunch}} {{supporter}} of Darwin, through <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>when</b> {{there was no}} adequate theory of heredity and both natural selection and sexual selection had become unpopular among scientists, and was attacked for his support both in The Colours of Animals and outside it. And he is recognised as the first scientist to identify frequency-dependent selection, as described in this book. By 1919, the book was being described in Nature as a classic work.|$|E

His forthcoming soundtrack album, Speedway, would die at number 82 on the Billboard chart. Parker had already shifted his plans to television, where Presley had not appeared since the Sinatra Timex show in 1960. He maneuvered a deal with NBC that committed the network to both finance a theatrical feature and broadcast a Christmas special.|$|E
5|$|The River Hull is a {{navigable river}} in the East Riding of Yorkshire in Northern England. It rises {{from a series of}} springs to the west of Driffield, and enters the Humber estuary at Kingston upon Hull. Following <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>when</b> the Archbishops of York charged tolls for its use, it became a free navigation. The upper reaches became part of the Driffield Navigation from 1770, after which they were again subject to tolls, and the section within the city of Hull came under the {{jurisdiction}} of the Port of Hull, with the same result.|$|E
5|$|The Selle Français (SF) is a {{breed of}} sport horse from France. It is renowned {{primarily}} for its success in show jumping, but many {{have also been}} successful in dressage and eventing. An athletic horse with good gaits, it is usually bay or chestnut in color. The Selle Français was created in 1958 when several French riding horse breeds were merged into one stud book. The new breed was meant {{to serve as a}} unified sport horse during <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>when</b> horses were being replaced by mechanization and were transforming into an animal used mainly for sport and leisure.|$|E

5|$|Ultimately Curtis' career stalled as {{more popular}} and {{successful}} officers secured active positions; during the Napoleonic Wars, Curtis was relegated to staff duties ashore {{and did not}} see action. He died in 1816, his baronetcy inherited by his second son Lucius who later became an Admiral of the Fleet. Modern historians have viewed Curtis as an over-cautious officer in <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>when</b> dashing, attacking tactics were admired. Contemporary opinion was more divided, with some influential officers expressing admiration of Curtis and others contempt.|$|E
5|$|Burges {{bought the}} lease on {{the plot of}} land in 1875. The house was built by the Ashby Brothers, with {{interior}} decoration by members of Burges's long-standing team of craftsmen including Thomas Nicholls and Henry Stacy Marks. By 1878 the house was largely complete, although interior decoration and the designing of numerous items of furniture and metalwork continued until Burges's death in 1881. The house was inherited by his brother-in-law, Richard Popplewell Pullan. It was later sold to Colonel T.H. Minshall and then, in 1933, to Colonel E.R.B. Graham. The poet John Betjeman inherited the remaining lease in 1962 but did not extend it. Following <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>when</b> the house stood empty and suffered vandalism, it was purchased and restored, first by Lady Jane Turnbull, later by the actor Richard Harris {{and then by the}} musician Jimmy Page.|$|E

5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the Devonian period (400 Mya) the sea was retreating from the Welsh Basin as the land was thrust up by the collision of land masses, forming a new range of mountains, the Welsh Caledonides. The strata were compressed and deformed, and in places, the clay minerals recrystallised, developing a grain that allowed parallel cleavage, making it easy to split the rocks into thin flat sheets of stone known as slate. In the Carboniferous period (360 to 300 Mya), erosion of the mountains resulted in the formation of sandstones and mudstones. A reinvasion of southern and northeastern parts of Wales by the sea resulted in depositions of limestone, and extensive swamps in South Wales gave rise to peat deposits and the eventual formation of coal measures. Southwestern Wales, in particular, was affected by the Variscan orogeny, <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>when</b> continental collisions further south caused complex folding and fracturing of the strata.|$|E
5|$|Glorious {{could carry}} up to 48 aircraft; when first recommissioned, she carried Fairey Flycatcher fighters, Blackburn Dart and Blackburn Ripon torpedo bombers, and Fairey IIIF {{reconnaissance}} planes of the Fleet Air Arm. From 1933 until Glorious {{returned to the}} United Kingdom in April 1940, aside from <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>when</b> refitting in the mid-1930s, she carried 802 Squadron which flew a mixture of nine Hawker Nimrod and three Hawker Osprey fighters, until re-equipping with a dozen Gloster Sea Gladiators in May 1939. 812 and 823 Squadrons were embarked for reconnaissance and anti-ship attack missions. They flew the Blackburn Ripon, the Blackburn Baffin and the Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers and as well as Fairey IIIF and Fairey Seal reconnaissance aircraft. When Glorious recommissioned after her refit in 1935, 825 Squadron was embarked, initially with Fairey IIIFs, but the squadron converted to Fairey Swordfish in May 1936.|$|E
5|$|Hand {{possessed a}} gift for the English language, and his {{writings}} are admired as legal literature. He rose to fame outside the legal profession in 1944 during World War II after giving a short address in Central Park that struck a popular chord in its appeal for tolerance. During <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>when</b> a hysterical fear of subversion divided the nation, Hand {{was viewed as a}} liberal defender of civil liberties. A collection of Hand's papers and addresses, published in 1952 as The Spirit of Liberty, sold well and won him new admirers. Even after he criticized the civil-rights activism of the 1950s Warren Court, Hand retained his popularity.|$|E
