50|$|CMV pp65 <b>antigenemia</b> test is an {{immunofluorescence}} based assay which utilizes {{an indirect}} immunofluorescence technique for identifying the pp65 protein of cytomegalovirus in peripheral blood leukocytes. The CMV pp65 assay {{is widely used}} for monitoring CMV infections and its response to antiviral treatment in patients who are under immunosuppressive therapy and have had renal transplantation surgery as the <b>antigenemia</b> results are obtained about 5 days {{before the onset of}} symptomatic CMV disease. The advantage of this assay is the rapidity in providing results in a few hours and that the pp65 antigen determination represents a useful parameter for the physician to initiate antiviral therapy. The major disadvantage of the pp65 assay is that only limited number of samples can be processed per test batch.|$|E
40|$|Infection {{with human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) may cause viral <b>antigenemia,</b> detected primarily as p 24 viral core protein. Among 16 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex studied serially, 12 had or developed <b>antigenemia</b> ranging from 16 to 3006 pg/mL in plasma.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the value of}} monitoring CMV <b>antigenemia</b> during and after antiviral therapy for CMV disease. During the study period, 10 out of 214 renal transplant recipients were treated for CMV disease, receiving a total of 14 courses of treatment. <b>Antigenemia</b> decreased within 7 days after onset of treatment in eight of nine courses associated with a rapid clinical recovery. In three courses with a slow or absent response, <b>antigenemia</b> levels initially increased. Monitoring <b>antigenemia</b> was helpful in differentiating persisting CMV disease from other opportunistic infections and rejection. Relapses of CMV disease were preceded by rises in <b>antigenemia.</b> Viral isolation became negative within 3 days after initiation of ganciclovir, irrespective of the clinical response. <b>Antigenemia</b> is a marker {{of the effect of}} ganciclovir on CMV replication in vivo, and its monitoring may be valuable in the management of patients with severe CMV disease...|$|E
40|$|Blood samples, {{obtained}} predominantly {{from human}} immunodeficiency virus-infected patients and solid-organ and {{bone marrow transplant}} recipients, were submitted to the clinical laboratory for detection of cytomegalovirus (CMV) and were processed by three methods: conventional culture, centrifugation culture, and CMV <b>antigenemia</b> assay with monoclonal antibodies (Clonab CMV; Biotest Diagnostic Corporation, Denville, N. J.) to CMV antigens. Of 496 blood samples tested, 107 were positive {{by one or more}} methods: 56 were positive by conventional culture, 27 were positive by centrifugation culture, and 97 were positive for CMV antigen (Ag) by the <b>antigenemia</b> assay. Forty-seven samples were positive by the CMV <b>antigenemia</b> assay only; in these samples, a mean of 12 Ag-positive cells was detected per 200, 000 polymorphonuclear leukocytes examined. In contrast, samples positive by the CMV <b>antigenemia</b> assay and both culture methods had a mean of 193 Ag-positive cells, and samples positive by the CMV <b>antigenemia</b> assay and conventional culture alone had a mean of 157 Ag-positive cells. In the <b>antigenemia</b> assay, paraformaldehyde fixation resulted in superior cell morphology when compared with acetone fixation. Use of immunofluorescence staining reduced sample processing time and the complexity of reagent preparation in comparison with immunoperoxidase staining. Differences in the sensitivities between the immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase staining techniques for detection of <b>antigenemia</b> were minor, with discrepant samples showing only one or two Ag-positive cells. Clinical disease was generally associated with high-level <b>antigenemia,</b> but exceptions were noted. The CMV <b>antigenemia</b> test is a rapid, quantitative assay that greatly facilitated the rapid diagnosis of CMV infection. However, quantitation of <b>antigenemia</b> is labor-intensive, requires processing of samples soon after collection, and does not always correlate with clinical disease in the individual patient...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{cytomegalovirus}} (CMV) —specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and T {{helper cells}} (Th) in controlling CMV infection, as detected by <b>antigenemia</b> assay and {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) in blood leukocytes, and CMV disease was investigated in 20 renal transplant recipients. Within 3 months after transplant, CMV-specific CTL and Th responses were demonstrable in 11 (55 %) and 15 (75 %) patients, respectively; CMV infection was detected by <b>antigenemia</b> and PCR in 19 (95 %) patients each. During the month of first CMV detection, there was an inverse correlation between CTL response and <b>antigenemia</b> at ⩾ 20 positive cells/ 105 leukocytes (P =. 007) but no association with lower <b>antigenemia</b> levels or PCR positivity. CMV disease developed in 7 (35 %) patients and was associated with high-level <b>antigenemia</b> but was inversely correlated with detection of CTLs (P =. 04).

40|$|In {{earlier work}} we {{demonstrated}} that CMV immediate early antigens {{can be detected}} in peripheral blood leukocytes of patients with active CMV infection. We now report {{a comparison of the}} <b>antigenemia</b> assay and an anti-CMV ELISA in a prospective longitudinal study of 130 renal transplant recipients who were monitored for active CMV infection during the first 3 months after transplantation. Active CMV infection developed in 56 patients. The <b>antigenemia</b> assay had a sensitivity of 89 % and a specificity of 93 % in the diagnosis of active CMV infection; for the ELISA these figures were 95 and 100 %, respectively. In 22 of the 56 patients a CMV syndrome occurred. <b>Antigenemia</b> was demonstrated in all 22 patients while an antibody response occurred in 21 of them. The <b>antigenemia</b> assay became positive 8 +/- 7 days before the onset of symptoms while the antibody response was observed 4 +/- 9 days after the onset of symptoms. The pattern of <b>antigenemia</b> was helpful for monitoring the course of the infection. The maximum level of <b>antigenemia</b> was significantly higher and its duration significantly longer in symptomatic than asymptomatic infection. We conclude that CMV <b>antigenemia</b> is a sensitive, specific, and early marker of CMV infection.

40|$|A nested PCR {{was used}} for the {{detection}} of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) DNA in plasma. The presence of HCMV DNA and its correlation to pp 65 leukocytic <b>antigenemia</b> were investigated with 299 blood samples from 45 organ transplant recipients and 63 AIDS patients. Of the 53 samples positive by nested PCR, 52 (98 %) were also positive for leukocytic <b>antigenemia</b> and 23 had high levels of <b>antigenemia</b> (> 50 positive cells per 2 x 105 leukocytes). Of the 246 samples negative in PCR, only 3 (1. 2 %) had highly positive <b>antigenemia.</b> For 15 patients having a high <b>antigenemia</b> level {{in the course of their}} disease, consecutive blood samples were studied and also assessed for viremia in culture. The extent to which HCMV DNA, detected by PCR, was present in plasma correlated with increased levels ofHCMV leukocytic <b>antigenemia</b> for six of the eight AIDS patients and for all the organ transplant recipients. Positivity for HCMV DNA in PCR and for viremia in cell culture was usually restricted to the highest <b>antigenemia</b> levels. From a total of 69 blood samples, PCR and culture gave positive results, respectively, for 17 of 32 samples (53 %) and 14 of 32 samples (43 %) from transplant recipients and for 15 of 37 samples (40 %) and 9 of 37 samples (24 %) from AIDS patients. Our findings have shown a strong correlation between high levels of leukocytic <b>antigenemia</b> and HCMV DNA in plasma. The detection of HCMV DNA in plasma by this nested PCR can prove HCMV dissemination in blood, but it lacks the rapidity and simplicity of the leukocytic pp 65 <b>antigenemia</b> procedure...|$|E

The patients were screened for <b>antigenemia</b> on days 0, 3, 7, and 14 of follow-up. On day 0, all 240 patients showed positive reactivity with both assays. Of the 229 cases with negative parasitemia on day 3, persistent <b>antigenemia</b> was observed in 207 (90. 4 %) of the cases: 188 (82. 1 %) for HRP 2 antigen and 75 (32. 8 %) for PMA. There was a gradual decrease in <b>antigenemia</b> on follow-up to day 14; however, the drop in reactivity to PMA was less than that for HRP 2 antigen. In contrast to HRP 2 <b>antigenemia,</b> there was a significant decrease in pLDH <b>antigenemia</b> to 38. 4 % and to 14. 8 % (PMA) on day 3 (P < 0. 03). The pLDH <b>antigenemia</b> level dropped further to 14. 8 % on day 7. There was no significant association of persistent <b>antigenemia</b> with gametocytemia. One case with gametocytemia was negative for both the antigens.

40|$|Background. The aim of {{the study}} was to assess the {{incidence}} of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and disease in adult liver transplant recipients, using routine preemptive therapy guided by the pp 65 <b>antigenemia</b> test. Methods. <b>Antigenemia</b> was monitored weekly after liver transplantation (OLTX) for the first 3 months, and once a month for another 3 months. CMV seronegative recipients were treated preemptively for the first positive <b>antigenemia.</b> Seropositive recipients were treated only when their <b>antigenemia</b> count reached a threshold of ≥ 00 positive cells per 200, 000 leukocytes. Results. A total of 144 patients were included between June 1994 and April 1995, of which 137 (95 %) were primary OLTX. The percentage of positive <b>antigenemia</b> and CMV disease was 55 and 8 %, respectively. Seventy-eight (54 %) patients were protocol-monitored for the entire follow-up (group 1) and received appropriate preemptive therapy, although 66 (46 %) patients had protocol violation by having missed blood samples or blood drawn at unscheduled times (group 2). Using Cox's proportional hazards model, patients with a first <b>antigenemia</b> count of > 11 leukocytes had a significantly higher rate of CMV disease compared to patients with an <b>antigenemia</b> count ≤ 11 leukocytes (RR= 7. 3, 95 % confidence interval= 2. 2 to 24. 5). In a multivariate Cox regression analysis, adjustments were made to control for: group 1 versus group 2, use of OKT 3, and serology risk categories. This analysis showed that the relative rate of CMV disease was still significantly higher among patients with <b>antigenemia</b> count > 11 leukocytes (adjusted RR= 4. 9, 95 % confidence interval= 1. 3 to 18. 1). The estimated cost of preemptive therapy was less than that of prophylaxis with i. v. (14 -day course) or oral (90 -day course) ganciclovir. Conclusions. Preemptive therapy guided by pp 65 <b>antigenemia</b> is a useful and cost effective strategy for prevention of CMV disease...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Rotavirus <b>antigenemia</b> is {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} in children with rotavirus diarrhea, but information is scarce on aspects of this phenomenon, such as genotype specificity, presence of intact viruses and correlation between genomic RNA and antigen concentration. Such information may help in understanding rotavirus pathogenesis and eventually be useful for diagnosis, treatment and prevention. Methods and findings Serum samples were collected from children who presented at hospitals with diarrhea. <b>Antigenemia</b> was present in 162 / 250 (64. 8 %) samples from children with rotavirus diarrhea. No specific rotavirus genotype {{was found to be}} associated with <b>antigenemia.</b> Rotavirus particles could not be found by electron microscopy in concentrated serum from children with high levels of <b>antigenemia.</b> In passaged rotavirus suspension a significant correlation (r[*]=[*] 0. 9559; P[*]=[*] 0. 0029) was found between antigen level and viral copy number, but no significant correlation (r[*]=[*] 0. 001480; P[*]=[*] 0. 9919) was found between <b>antigenemia</b> level and viral copy number in serum. When intact rotavirus was treated with benzonase endonuclease, genomic double-stranded (ds) RNA was not degraded, but when sera of patients with <b>antigenemia</b> were treated with benzonase endonuclease, genomic dsRNA was degraded, indicating genomic dsRNA was free in sera and not inside virus capsid protein. Conclusions <b>Antigenemia</b> is present in a significant number of patients with rotavirus diarrhea. Rotavirus viremia was absent in the children with rotavirus diarrhea who participated in our study, and was not indicated by the presence of <b>antigenemia.</b> The significance of circulating rotavirus antigen and genomic dsRNA in serum of patients with diarrhea deserves further study. </p...|$|E

We sought to evaluate the prevalence of and risk factors for cryptococcal <b>antigenemia</b> in Ethiopia. Methods: Consecutive adult HIV-infected patients from two public HIV clinics in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia were enrolled into the study. A CD 4 count # 200 cells/ml was required for study participation. Patients receiving anti-retroviral therapy (ART) were not excluded. A cryptococcal antigen test was performed for all patients along with an interview, physical exam, and medical chart abstraction. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess risk factors for cryptococcal <b>antigenemia.</b> Results: 369 HIV-infected patients were enrolled; mean CD 4 123 cells/ml and 74 % receiving ART.

40|$|International audienceThe {{cytomegalovirus}} (CMV) <b>antigenemia</b> assay {{has been}} used frequently for rapid diagnosis of CMV infection, and <b>antigenemia</b> threshold values are recommended for triggering preemptive therapy. Hybrid capture of CMV's DNA and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) are increasingly being adopted for early detection of CMV. The performance of the <b>antigenemia</b> assay, qPCR in plasma and hybrid capture in leukocytes were compared in 110 immunocompromised patients (38 bone-marrow transplants, 50 renal transplants and 22 AIDS patients). The most sensitive test was hybrid capture for transplants, while <b>antigenemia</b> and the qPCR showed similar performance for patients with AIDS. QPCR and hybrid capture thresholds requiring antiviral therapy were calculated using a receiver-operating-characteristic curve for <b>antigenemia</b> values corresponding to 2 positive cells for bone-marrow transplants and to 10 positive cells for renal transplants and AIDS patients. These threshold values varied with the group of patients considered, with corresponding sensitivities higher than 86 % and specificities higher than 76 % for hybrid capture, and sensitivities higher than 61 % and specificities higher than 75 % for qPCR in plasma.

Methods: A retrospective review was done of patients who had a CMV infection based on positive <b>antigenemia.</b> Medical charts were reviewed for the following information: age, sex, underlying disease, symptoms and signs, laboratory results, complementary diagnostic procedures, duration and dose of ganciclovir therapy, concomitant medications, complications, and outcome. Results: Sixty-four patients with positive CMV <b>antigenemia</b> were identified; 15 patients {{were excluded from the}} study because of their underlying diseases. Of the remaining 49 patients, 26 (53 %) were female; the median age was 11. 5 months (range 0. 3 – 132 months).

NASBA results were compared to results from the pp 65 <b>antigenemia</b> assay, virus isolation by cell culture, and serology. The sensitivity value for NASBA proved {{to be higher than}} that for the <b>antigenemia</b> assay (50 versus 35 %) for the detection of HCMV infection, while the sensitivity values of cell culture and NASBA were comparable (54 and 50 %, respectively). NASBA detected the onset of HCMV infection simultaneously with cell culture and the <b>antigenemia</b> assay. Both the <b>antigenemia</b> assay and NASBA are very specific (100 %) and highly predictive (100 %) for the onset of HCMV infection. Antiviral therapy with ganciclovir resulted in negative results for cell culture, the <b>antigenemia</b> assay, and NASBA. In conclusion, monitoring HCMV pp 67 mRNA expression by NASBA is a highly specific method for the detection of HCMV infection in renal-allograft recipients and is more sensitive than the <b>antigenemia</b> assay.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cytomegalovirus {{infection}} in renal transplant recipients {{is a major}} clinical problem, with both {{short and long term}} sequelae. Infection can occur as a result of reactivation of latent virus or new infection from donor tissues. The impact of donor and recipient serostatus on viremia is well recognised, with seronegative recipients at greatest risk after transplantation of an organ from a seropositive donor. However, the impact of grafting such organs into seropositive recipients is less clear. OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of recipient serostatus on the risk of CMV <b>antigenemia</b> in a large renal transplant cohort. STUDY DESIGN: We prospectively quantified CMV <b>antigenemia</b> over time in a cohort of 486 recipients. We analysed the <b>antigenemia</b> status according to donor and recipient serostatus. RESULTS: <b>Antigenemia</b> was most common in seronegative recipients of organs from seropositive donors (D+/R-). Nevertheless, we observed that even in CMV seropositive recipients, the impact of donor serostatus on CMV <b>antigenemia</b> is still substantial (p= 0. 006; OR= 2. 2).

While none of the tests sufficed alone, the best diagnostic coverage was achieved by combining antibody detection with RNA or NS 1 testing. Studied by regression models, early relative levels of viremia and NS 1 <b>antigenemia</b> proved to be significantly associated with several clinical parameters: high viremia predicted greater likelihood and increased length of hospitalization, the degree of NS 1 <b>antigenemia</b> correlated positively with hematocrit and liver transaminases, and both viremia and NS 1 <b>antigenemia</b> levels negatively with platelet counts in follow-up. Levels of viremia and NS 1 <b>antigenemia</b> may serve as predictors of the clinical manifestations in travel-acquired dengue...|$|E
40|$|Cytomegalovirus (CMV) <b>antigenemia</b> {{is still}} one of the two major assays {{available}} for diagnosis and monitoring of CMV infections. A commercial rapid test recently available in Brazil for quantification of human cytomegalovirus pp 65 <b>antigenemia</b> revealed by immunofluorescence technique was compared with the original in-house method revealed by immunoperoxidase in patients receiving solid organ transplants. Of 80 blood samples tested for CMV <b>antigenemia,</b> 34 (42. 5 %) were positive: commercial assay detected 33 (97 %) and in-house assay detected 20 (58. 8 %) samples. The numbers of positive cells in the two assays were different, with a median of 4. 5 and 12 positive cells obtained by in-house and commercial kit, respectively. Discrepancies between assays occurred in 15 specimens from patients with low-grade <b>antigenemia</b> (median 6 positive cells). The assay-time was reduced in approximately 50 % compared to in-house methodology. In conclusion, besides comparable results obtained for both assays, the commercial <b>antigenemia</b> assay provides more rapid and sensitive results.

40|$|BackgroundAntigenemia is {{commonly}} found in children with rotavirus infection, although its clinical significance is undetermined. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the association of <b>antigenemia</b> with clinical manifestations and cytokine profiles in children infected by rotavirus. MethodsIn total, 68 children hospitalized with rotavirus gastroenteritis were enrolled. Serum samples were collected for detection of <b>antigenemia</b> and viremia. Clinical, laboratory and demographic data were analyzed. Proinflammatory, Th 1 and Th 2 cytokines were evaluated by bead-based flow cytometry. ResultsAntigenemia and viremia were found in 45. 6 % (n =  31) and 5. 9 % (n =  4) of the 68 rotavirus-infected children, respectively. The mean age of the <b>antigenemia</b> group was significantly greater than that of the non-antigenemia group (43. 5 vs. 27. 3 months; p =  0. 034). The <b>antigenemia</b> group had a significantly shorter length of hospitalization (4. 8 vs. 5. 8 days; p =  0. 0354) in comparison with the non-antigenemia group, and <b>antigenemia</b> was inversely associated with the length of hospitalization (β =  0. 31, p =  0. 021). A significantly higher tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -β level was found in the patients with <b>antigenemia</b> than those without (236. 7 vs. 29. 2  pg/mL, p =  0. 026). The severity of disease and the rate of extra-intestinal manifestations did not differ between the groups. Viremia was associated with a higher fever (p =  0. 012). ConclusionsAntigenemia was positively correlated with shorter hospital stay in children with rotavirus infection. Enhanced innate and T-cell-mediated immunity evidenced by up-regulation of TNF-β was found in patients with <b>antigenemia...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Quantitative {{real-time}} PCR assays, {{which are}} more rapid and practical than pp 65 <b>antigenemia</b> determination, are progressively becoming the preferred method for monitoring Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) reactivation. However, the relationship between HCMV DNA and <b>antigenemia</b> levels is still under investigation. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyse the relationship between HCMV DNA and pp 65 <b>antigenemia</b> levels in order to identify clinically useful threshold values for the management of patients. Methods 475 consecutive samples from 156 immunosuppressed patients were tested for HCMV by pp 65 <b>antigenemia</b> and Real-time PCR assay. Results 136 out of 475 consecutive samples derived from 48 patients showed evidence of HCMV infection. HCMV DNA was detected in 106 samples, pp 65 antigen in 3, and both markers in 27. pp 65 antigen detection was associated with higher HCMV DNA levels. The cut-off HCMV DNA level that best predicted pp 65 <b>antigenemia</b> in this series of samples was 11, 500 copies/ml, but different threshold levels could be observed for specific groups of patients. HCMV disease was observed in 5 out of 48 patients with active HCMV infection. The presence of clinical symptoms was associated with positive pp 65 and with higher <b>antigenemia</b> levels. Higher HCMV DNA load at the onset of viral replication was correlated to the development of clinical symptoms. Conclusion Both pp 65 <b>antigenemia</b> and HCMV DNA load can be useful for the prospective monitoring of immunocompromised subjects. Specific cut-off levels capable of triggering preemptive antiviral treatment should be determined in accordance to the type of test used and the characteristics of patients and prospectively validated. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{present some}} results {{concerning}} investigation of humoral immune factors (virus-specific antibodies, complement components, total serum immunoglobulins, circulating immune complexes), and {{the levels of}} tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) viral <b>antigenemia</b> in the persons subjected to stings of ticks. Elimination of the virus in vaccinated people with short-term <b>antigenemia,</b> with higher indices of innate humoral immunity and virus-specific antibodies, proved to be faster while being more complete than in non-vaccinated persons. In cases of a long-term TBE <b>antigenemia,</b> both vaccinated and non-vaccinated people showed low levels of virusspecific antibodies along with decreased natural resistance, thus, probably, contributing to delayed elimination of TBE virus. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to determine the prevalence and significance of Pneumocystis carinii <b>antigenemia</b> in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and clinically or invasively diagnosed P. carinii pneumonitis. Single serum specimens from 20 AIDS patients invasively examined for P. carinii organisms and 106 AIDS patients with a clinical diagnosis only of P. carinii pneumonitis were blindly tested for P. carinii <b>antigenemia</b> by a counterimmunoelectrophoresis assay. In the 20 specimen-documented cases, the antigen test demonstrated a sensitivity of 75 % and a specificity of 90 %. The positive predictive value of the test was 90 %, while the negative predictive value was 70 %. In AIDS patients with specimen-documented P. carinii pneumonitis, the prevalence of P. carinii <b>antigenemia</b> coincided almost exactly with the prevalence of positive invasively obtained specimens (60 and 59 %, respectively). In patients with a clinical diagnosis only of P. carinii pneumonitis, half as many (30 %) were found to exhibit <b>antigenemia.</b> Sequential P. carinii antigen titers determined by a new latex agglutination technique on three AIDS patients with specimen-documented P. carinii pneumonitis demonstrated the influence of specific therapy upon P. carinii <b>antigenemia</b> and its potential prognostic application...|$|E
