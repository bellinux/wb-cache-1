25|$|Our {{findings}} are significant at two levels. First, {{it shows that}} Upper Paleolithic Siberians came from a cosmopolitan population of early modern humans that spread out of Africa to Europe and Central and South Asia.

African Americans, American Indians, Hispanics, and South Asians, {{particularly}} those from Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and India, {{are at high risk}} of developing CKD. African Americans are at greater risk due to a prevalence of hypertension among them. As an example, 37% of ESKD cases in African <b>Americans</b> <b>can</b> be attributed to high blood pressure, compared with 19% among Caucasians.|$|E
25|$|In Of a Fire on the Moon Mailer {{discusses}} {{that the}} space flight was an exclusive action {{on the part of}} white America, as they have left African Americans behind on earth. African <b>Americans</b> <b>can</b> only look on as whites move even farther past them in not just society, but their earthly constraints. Mailer uses African Americans to criticize the moon landing, as he reflects on the fact that many problems still exist on earth, and within America.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} plans have been introduced that would raise the age of Medicare eligibility. Some have argued that, as the population ages and the ratio of workers to retirees increases, programs for the elderly need to be reduced. Since {{the age at which}} <b>Americans</b> <b>can</b> retire with full Social Security benefits is rising to 67, it is argued that the age of eligibility for Medicare should rise with it (though people can begin receiving reduced Social Security benefits as early as age 62).|$|E
25|$|Combat is turn-based. During a side's turn, {{each of its}} units {{can move}}, attack, or fire ranged weapons. Most units can move up to two squares a turn or one through forests. Native <b>Americans</b> <b>can</b> move two squares through any terrain. Cavalry move three, giving them much higher mobility. Ranged units can move one square and then shoot or shoot first and end their turn. Units can also turn about using one {{movement}} point.

This figure is still a higher occurrence than Irish Americans, who can only name a few traditional Irish foods (typically corned beef and cabbage), and only 30% report eating Irish food each year. Even fewer English, Dutch, and Scottish <b>Americans</b> <b>can</b> report that they eat ethnic cuisine regularly.|$|E

500|$|Hyakutake's {{soldiers}} conducted numerous assaults {{over three}} days at various {{locations around the}} Lunga perimeter. Along the Matanikau River, the principal river flowing through what is now central Honiara, tanks attacked in pairs across the sandbar {{at the mouth of}} the river behind a barrage of artillery. Artillery, including [...] anti-tank guns, quickly destroyed all nine tanks. At the same time, four battalions of Marine artillery, totalling 40 howitzers, fired over 6,000 rounds into the area between Point Cruz and the Matanikau, causing heavy casualties in Nomasu Nakaguma's infantry battalions as they tried to approach the Marine lines. Both sides incurred heavy losses during the events of the overall battle, especially the Japanese attackers. After an attempt to deliver further reinforcements failed during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal in November 1942, Japan conceded defeat in the struggle for the island and evacuated many of its remaining forces by the first week of February 1943. The Quonset hut built by the <b>Americans</b> <b>can</b> still be seen in the back lanes of the town and numerous memorials give testament to the war.|$|E
500|$|Parker {{also said}} he and Stone {{purposely}} wrote the episode to present Jesus as the hero from a [...] "humanist approach"; Clasquin said this is demonstrated {{by the fact that}} Jesus becomes caught up in people's expectations for the fight and becomes offended when people bet against him: [...] "This satirical gesture beautifully draws attention to the sheer humanity of Jesus. He really is a man, just as we are men and women. He is open to fear and uncertainty." [...] Several writers said the episode also lampooned the way <b>Americans</b> <b>can</b> turn anything, even a religious situation, into a commercially hyped event. Matt Zoller Seitz of The Star-Ledger said: [...] "They aren't making fun of organized religion (though they have in the past). They're making fun of those who would turn religion into entertainment and entertainment into a kind of religion." [...] Seitz said the episode mocks [...] "morality cops who misbehave in private" [...] like Priest Maxi, who secretly bets the parish against Jesus even as he admonished congregation members for siding with Satan.|$|E

Hinckley went on to remark that [...] "Ugly Americans packs a lot into 21 or 22 minutes. Happily, its often droll and deadpan style makes it easy to watch even if some of the references are whizzing by unappreciated". RedEye critic Curt Wagner rated it three stars out of four and wrote that it includes [...] "visual [...] ", cultural references and [...] "so-fast-you'll-miss-them jokes" [...] that it might require multiple viewings. Wagner, however, meant that this was a rather positive feature, writing: [...] "For example, you might be laughing so hard at what just happened that you miss a fun line..." [...] Lastly, Wagner observed that [...] "Ugly <b>Americans</b> <b>can</b> be gross and bizarre, but everything makes sense in the world that it has created".|$|E
