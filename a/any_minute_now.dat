500|$|Reactions to {{the video}} were mixed. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine commented it is [...] "more {{thematic}} and thought provoking than the videos for 'Baby Boy' and 'Naughty Girl'", Beyoncé's songs from her debut album, Dangerously in Love. Allhiphop's Eb Haynes described the video [...] "visually fresh" [...] and [...] "couture motivated". A news article published by Hindustan Times reported that a particular scene in the video is suggestive of oral sex. Natalie Y. Moore of In These Times magazine echoed the latter's commentary, writing that the video showcases Beyoncé [...] "strutting her sexuality", and that in Jay-Z's scenes it [...] "looks as if <b>any</b> <b>minute</b> <b>now</b> she'll give him fellatio". [...] The video later appeared {{on a list of}} Yahoo! Music News' Worst Videos of All Time, which pointed to the negative fan reaction and stated, [...] "It's probably the least horrific video listed ... but as far as Beyoncé videos go, it is [...] a stinker." ...|$|E

6000|$|There was {{a murmur}} of concurrence, and Leland smiled. [...] "As {{a matter of}} fact, I did so already, and asked Sergeant Grier to ride across and meet you to-night.

5000|$|As the new {{millennium}} approached preparations for the end mounted. In 1999, the state owned New Vision newspaper ran {{an interview with a}} teenage member. He said, [...] "The world ends next year. There is no time to waste.

6000|$|Then {{came the}} fourth round. Of {{course there was}} no {{question}} {{in the minds of the}} majority of the spectators as to who would win the fight.

Two years ago last Christmas your uncle Silas {{was coming up}} from Newrleans on the old Lally Rook, and she blowed out a cylinder-head and crippled a man. And I think he died afterwards. He was a Baptist. Your uncle Silas knowed a family in Baton Rouge that knowed his people very well. Yes, I remember now, he DID die. Mortification set in, {{and they had to}} amputate him. But it didn't save him. Yes, it was mortification--that was it. He turned blue all over, and died in the hope of a glorious resurrection. They say he was a sight to look at. Your uncle's been up to the town every day to fetch you.

6000|$|He {{took his}} {{hands off the}} stone parapet, and made for his hotel. His palms were white from {{the force of his}} grip. He said to himself as he went along: [...] "I must {{consider}} the whole question calmly; I must think it out." [...] This gave him relief. With young Lennan, at all events, he could be angry. But even there he found, to his dismay, no finality of judgment. And this absence of finality, so unwonted, distressed him horribly. There was something in the way the young man had been sitting there beside her--so quiet, so almost timid--that had touched him. This was bad, by Jove--very bad! The two of them, they made, somehow, a nice couple! Confound it! This would not do! The chaplain of the little English church, passing at this moment, called out, [...] "Fine morning, Colonel Ercott." [...] The Colonel saluted, and did not answer. The greeting at the moment seemed to him paltry. No morning could be fine that contained such a discovery. He entered the hotel, passed into the dining-room, and sat down. Nobody was there. They all had their breakfast upstairs, even Dolly. Olive alone was in the habit of supporting him while he ate an English breakfast. And suddenly he perceived that he was face to face already with this dreadful situation. To have breakfast without, as usual, waiting for her, seemed too pointed. She might be coming in at <b>any</b> <b>minute</b> <b>now.</b> To wait for her, and have it, without showing anything--how could he do that? ...|$|E

60|$|Half {{past six}} in the morning, and all the crowd on the wharf and the boat due to leave in half an hour. Notice it!--in half an hour. Already she's whistled twice (at six, and at six fifteen), and at <b>any</b> <b>minute</b> <b>now,</b> Christie Johnson will step into the pilot house and pull the string for the warning whistle that the boat will leave in half an hour. So keep ready. Don't think of running back to Smith's Hotel for the {{sandwiches}}. Don't be fool enough {{to try to go}} up to the Greek Store, next to Netley's, and buy fruit. You'll be left behind for sure if you do. Never mind the sandwiches and the fruit! Anyway, here comes Mr. Smith himself with a huge basket of provender that would feed a factory. There must be sandwiches in that. I think I can hear them clinking. And behind Mr. Smith is the German waiter from the caff with another basket--indubitably lager beer; and behind him, the bar-tender of the hotel, carrying nothing, as far as one can see. But of course if you know Mariposa you will understand that why he looks so nonchalant and empty-handed is because he has two bottles of rye whiskey under his linen duster. You know, I think, the peculiar walk of a man with two bottles of whiskey in the inside pockets of a linen coat. In Mariposa, you see, to bring beer to an excursion is quite in keeping with public opinion. But, whiskey,--well, one has to be a little careful.|$|E
