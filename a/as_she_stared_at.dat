[...] The Ōgiya was a large, {{long-established}} shop in Yoshiwara, and Hanaōgi built her reputation in the 1780s for her beauty and her skills in singing, playing the koto, the tea ceremony, the Chinese classics, and incense.|$|R
50|$|The episode ends on {{the theme}} of Power. Lynette is seen looking in her car mirror, and <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> herself, <b>she</b> slowly lets her hair down to how Rick likes it. Tom is left at home with no power as his wife takes control over the pizzeria. Gabrielle and Victor {{celebrate}} their engagement and Victor’s growing success in the polls, while Carlos and Edie continue their relationship without hiding it from Mike. Susan takes off her engagement ring and is free from both Mike and Ian for the time being, while Mrs. McCluskey is left alone in the dark in a prison cell.|$|R
60|$|He nodded familiarly to Miss Eversleigh, {{and turned}} away with Miss Avondale, who waved her usual smiling {{patronage}} to Randolph, even including his companion in that half-amused, half-superior salutation. Perhaps it was this that put a sudden hauteur into the young girl's expression <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> Miss Avondale's departing figure.|$|E
60|$|The girls laughed, and Josie blushed <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> {{the tall}} man, {{conscious}} {{that she had}} leaped before she looked. They made a pretty contrast, these two young cousins--one as fair as a lily, the other a little wild rose. And Dan gave a nod of satisfaction as he surveyed them; for he had seen many bonny girls in his travels, and was glad that these old friends were blooming so beautifully.|$|E
60|$|For {{several seconds}} Hetty stood silent, {{recognizing}} that what Torrance might smile at in his guest would appear almost {{a crime in}} his daughter, but still horribly unwilling. Then, as Flora Schuyler, with a half-impatient gesture, signed to Grant, she touched a little gong, and {{a few moments later}} her maid met them in the corridor. The girl stopped suddenly, gasping a little <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> Grant, until Hetty grasped her arm, nipping it cruelly.|$|E
50|$|Lorraine {{takes him}} to an old mine, and shows him a dark hole {{that leads to a}} caved in lower shaft. She and Hex journey down, and it is {{revealed}} that Lorraine has murdered at least fifteen men. Grabbing a knife, Lorraine tries once more to kill Hex, who punches her and secures Red's body. Lorraine comes to just as Hex reaches the top and kicks down the rope trapping her there. Lorraine first pleads that they can be partners, then tells Hex he can't leave her. Hex says she has plenty of companions whom she knows, then departs. Lorraine trembles <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> the dead bodies, the only lamp in the shaft slowly going out, leaving her trapped in the dark.|$|R

"It is all so horrible," [...] said Grace, bending {{back her}} head, so that as I glanced over my {{shoulder}} I could see her firm white neck through the laces <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> upward <b>at</b> the streak of blue sky so far above.

Beyoncé and the dancers perform a dance routine together, and soon she meets a man, who dances with her. A {{particular}} scene shows all the dancers crouch down to the floor, and follow Beyoncé <b>as</b> <b>she</b> walks, before she blows them back. [...] The bridge starts, and the video moves to Beyoncé in a red room, where she and her dancers dance in short skirts, fishnets and black sparkling dresses. The group is later dance in the red and white rooms together. Leading into the final chorus, Beyoncé dances back in the room with the dancers, while Rowland, Williams and her sister sit on a black couch. As the video ends, Beyoncé {{stands in front of the}} mirror she was at the start and fades to black <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> the viewer through it.|$|R
6000|$|When the {{arithmetic}} came, the little teacher {{was surprised to}} find her scholar quicker in some things than herself, for Phebe had worked away at the columns in the butcher's and baker's books till she could add so quickly and correctly that Rose was amazed, and felt that in this branch the pupil would soon excel the teacher if she kept on at the same pace. Her praise cheered Phebe immensely, and they went bravely on, both getting so interested that time flew unheeded till Aunt Plenty appeared, exclaiming, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> the two heads bent over one slate, ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{little girl}} loved to bathe {{so well that}} she {{wanted to be in the}} water all the time, and had been {{forbidden}} to go into the sea for a day or two because she had a cold. So she was in a pet, and ran away from her playmates to sit and sulk in a lonely spot among the rocks. She had been watching the gulls fly and float, with their white wings shining as they dipped down or soared away in the sunshine. As she wished her wish a very large one swept down upon the sand before her, and startled her by saying in a hoarse tone, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> its bright eyes, the red ring round its neck, and the little tuft on its head,-- ...|$|E
6000|$|Nettie {{would have}} {{snatched}} her hand free, {{but the man}} held it fast with a little warning pressure, and she went on with him, partly because his voice had been deferential and puzzlingly familiar, and also because {{it was evident that}} she could not get away. They went up a calle, where another band of roysterers came clamoring to meet them, until the man led her under an archway where a lamp was burning. Then he gravely dropped her hand, and Nettie gasped <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> him. He was burned to the color of coffee, his shoes were burst, and his garments, which had evidently never been intended to fit him, were mostly rags, but his face reminded her of the man she had met on board the “Aurania.” ...|$|E
6000|$|Carl {{retired to}} a chair beside the Morris chair, fidgeting. [...] "Can you beat it! Is this Gertie and me?" [...] he inquired in a {{parenthesis}} in his heart. For a second, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> haughtily <b>at</b> him, he spitefully recalled the fact that Gertie had once discarded him for a glee-club dentist. But he submerged the thought and listened with a rather forced big-brother air <b>as</b> <b>she</b> repented of her anger and went on: ...|$|R
5000|$|A young maidservant {{bends over}} to wring out linen {{with her hands}} <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stares</b> provocatively <b>at</b> the viewer with a sensual, flirting glance. She appears unkempt, wearing clothes which cover her body and red mules on her feet, but her ankle and foot are exposed {{suggesting}} a lack of sexual restraint. [...] A marabout, a kettle used for boiling water, is seated on a small table in the lower left frame.|$|R
60|$|The {{problem is}} insoluble. The body is {{harnessed}} to a brain. Beauty {{goes hand in}} hand with stupidity. There she sat staring at the fire <b>as</b> <b>she</b> had <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> the broken mustard-pot. In spite of defending indecency, Jacob doubted whether he liked it in the raw. He had a violent reversion towards male society, cloistered rooms, and the works of the classics; and was ready to turn with wrath upon whoever it was who had fashioned life thus.|$|R
60|$|Letitia {{made her}} way into her own room and closed the door. She lit both of the candles upon her {{dressing}} table, pulled back the lace of her sleeves {{and looked at her}} wrists. There were two red marks there, red marks which, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> them, seemed suddenly again to feel the iron pressure. She stared at them, half in surprise, without anger and yet with a curious emotion. Suddenly she found that she was trembling, obsessed with a strange yet irresistible impulse. She bent down and lightly kissed the flaming marks. Then she blew out the candles, threw herself into the easy-chair which, earlier in the day, she had drawn up to the window, and looked steadily back into the park now fast becoming a phantasy of shadowland.|$|E
6000|$|In {{a little}} {{nest in the}} hay a girl was curled up, looking {{as if she had}} just wakened from sleep. When she saw them she stood up, rather shakily, as it seemed, and in the bright {{sunlight}} that streamed through the cobwebbed window behind her, they saw that her thin, sunburned face was very pale under its tan. She had two braids of lank, thick, tow-coloured hair and very odd eyes--"white eyes," [...] the manse children thought, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> them half defiantly, half piteously. They were really of so pale a blue that they did seem almost white, especially when contrasted with the narrow black ring that circled the iris. She was barefooted and bareheaded, and was clad in a faded, ragged, old plaid dress, much too short and tight for her. As for years, she might have been almost any age, judging from her wizened little face, but her height seemed to be somewhere in the neighbourhood of twelve.|$|E
60|$|The {{poor woman}} {{realised}} the situation better than her drunken husband did. As a bird-fancier he contributed little, almost nothing, {{to the general}} fund on which this family subsisted. He was a huge, powerful fellow, and had various methods of obtaining money--some obvious and others mysterious--but nearly all his earnings went to the gin-palace, for Ned {{was a man of}} might, and could stand an enormous quantity of drink. Hetty, who worked, perhaps we should say slaved, for a firm which paid her one shilling a week, could not manage to find food for them all. Mrs Frog herself with her infant to care for, had found it hard work at any time to earn a few pence, and now Bobby's active little limbs were reduced to inaction, converting him into a consumer instead of a producer. In short, the glaring fact that the family expenses would be increased while the family income was diminished, stared Mrs Frog as blankly in the face <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> the dirty blank wall.|$|E
60|$|This was {{the obvious}} {{explanation}} of the child's sudden disappearance and equally abrupt discovery. There remained, however, {{the problem of the}} interloping baby, which now sat whimpering on the lawn in a disfavour as chilling as its previous popularity had been unwelcome. The Momebys glared at it as though it had wormed its way into their short-lived affections by heartless and unworthy pretences. Miss Gilpet's face took on an ashen tinge <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> helplessly <b>at</b> the bunched-up figure that had been such a gladsome sight to her eyes a few moments ago.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Brinkley {{considered}} {{this a little}} too bold, a little too brazen. Had they actually come South in pursuit of him? It was shameless, and she let Mrs. Pasmer know something of her feeling in the shortness with which she answered, [...] "I saw him in Washington the other day--for a moment." [...] She shortened {{the time she had}} spent in Dan's company so as to cut Mrs. Pasmer off from as much comfort <b>as</b> possible, and <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> her in open astonishment.|$|R
40|$|This article {{begins with}} an {{overview}} of music technology today, its history and current status. The development of MIDI, digital sound synthesis, and CD audio are mentioned. Developments in music software designed assisted instruction are placed in six categories: drill-and-practice, flexible practice, guided instruction, games, exploratory, and creative. The article continues by offering examples of commercial software from these categories that are appropriate for young children. Screen shots of each program are offered, together with comments about how each title works. Research on the young child and music technology is included, with references to work done in and outside of music education. The article ends {{with the notion that}} teachers are always the key to quality instruction in music and music technology is only a tool in the process. s I write these words, the year-ending holiday season is upon us and television commercials about the wonders of technology abound. My favorite one features a JL young girl seated in front of a modern personal computer. She seems to be doing a report for school on a music topic <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stares</b> up <b>at</b> a colorful screen of jazz musician...|$|R
6000|$|The {{little boy}} had come {{wondering}} {{up to the}} chair whilst this embrace took place, and Clive's tall figure bent over the three. Rosa's eyes were not good to look at, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> the group with a ghastly smile. Mrs. Mackenzie surveyed the scene in haughty state, from behind the sofa cushions. She tried {{to take one of}} Rosa's lean hot hands. The poor child tore it away, leaving her rings behind her; lifted her hands to her face: and cried, cried as if her little heart would break. Ah me! what a story was there! what an outburst of pent-up feeling! what a passion of pain! The ring had fallen to the ground; the little boy crept towards it, and picked it up, and came towards his mother, fixing on her his large wondering eyes. [...] "Mamma crying. Mamma's ring!" [...] he said, holding up the circle of gold. With more feeling than I had ever seen her exhibit, she clasped the boy in her wasted arms. Great Heaven! what passion, jealousy, grief, despair, were tearing and trying all these hearts, that but for fate might have been happy? ...|$|E
6000|$|She tripped {{away after}} this Parthian shot, yet feeling, {{even in her}} triumph, that the {{conceited}} fool seemed actually relieved at her departure! And {{for the first time}} she now thought that she had seen something in his face that she did not like! But her lazy independence reasserted itself soon, and half an hour later, when she had left Aunt Chloe's cabin, she had regained her self-esteem. Yet, to avoid meeting him again, she took a longer route home, across the dried ditch and over the bluff, scarred by hydraulics, and so fell, presently, upon the old garden at the point where it adjoined the abandoned diggings. She was quite sure she had escaped a meeting with Starbuck, and was gliding along under the shadow of the pear-trees, when she suddenly stopped. An indescribable terror overcame her <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> a spot in the garden, perfectly illuminated by the moonlight not fifty yards from where she stood. For she saw on its surface a human head--a man's head!--seemingly on the level of the ground, staring in her direction. A hysterical laugh sprang from her lips, and she caught at the branches above her or she would have fallen! Yet in that moment the head had vanished! The moonlight revealed the empty garden,--the ground she had gazed at,--but nothing more! ...|$|E
60|$|Tessa's {{father was}} an Italian plaster-worker, very poor, but kind and honest. The mother had died not long ago, and left twelve-year old Tessa {{to take care of}} the little children. She tried to be very wise and motherly, and worked for them like any little woman; but it was so hard to keep the small bodies warm and fed, and the small souls good and happy, that poor Tessa was often at her wits' end. She always waited for her father, no matter how tired she was, so that he might find his supper warm, a bit of fire, and a loving little face to welcome him. Tessa thought over her {{troubles}} at these quiet times, and made her plans; for her father left things to her a good deal, and she had no friends but Tommo, the harp-boy upstairs, and the lively cricket who lived in the chimney. To-night her face was very sober, and her pretty brown eyes very thoughtful <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> the fire and knit her brows, as if perplexed. She was not thinking of her old shoes, nor the empty closet, nor the boys' ragged clothes just then. No; she had a fine plan in her good little head, and was trying to discover how she could carry it out.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the final}} scene (taking place in the [...] "missed train" [...] timeline), James leaves the {{hospital}} after visiting his mother, and Helen leaves after ending her relationship with Gerry. They meet in the lift, and Helen drops an earring which is picked up by James, as in their first encounter {{at the beginning of}} the film. Before the lift doors close, James tells Helen to cheer up and repeats his line: [...] "You know what the Monty Python boys say..." [...] Helen (who had previously assumed the rejoinder to be [...] "always look on the bright side of life.") says [...] "Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition". The frame freezes <b>as</b> <b>she</b> and James <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> one another.|$|R
5000|$|Kay is {{presented}} as a 42-year-old Californian bank teller (and sometimes branch manager) at Van Nuys Savings and Loan. She took a work transfer from the bank she worked at in England to its American branch {{to take advantage of the}} American health care system for her mother. She lives in Panorama City. Unlike her portrayal in The Tracey Ullman Show, Kay doesn't face the wrath of her nasty co-workers. While we still don't see Mother on screen, we hear her through a series of beeps from her bedroom. Kay's mother became an invalid after having been involved in an accident where the sidecar she was traveling in broke free from the motorbike Kay's father was driving. [...] "'I didn't know the damn motorbike would part company with the sidecar, Mildred,' he shouted over his shoulder, as he sped off up Shaftesbury Avenue." [...] Later, Kay's mother warned her: [...] "I remember the cold, steely glint in Mother's eye <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> up <b>at</b> me from her iron lung. 'Kay,' she said, 'don't ever marry. All men will try to kill you, after they've done nasty things to your downstairs areas.'" [...] It's revealed in the episode [...] "Tracey Takes On... Death" [...] that Kay's father ran off with her aunt, Marjorie.|$|R
40|$|I 2 ̆ 7 ve dashed into {{a coffee}} shop and ordered my {{take-away}} flat white. While waiting I observe {{a group of three}} mothers sitting outdoors with prams carefully arranged not to obstruct the flow of customers, enjoying a coffee and chat with babes in arms. One mum is patiently wrestling with her about 1 -month old baby trying to latch him to breastfeed, while the others watch sympathetically, offering support and advice. 2 ̆ 7 He always fusses like this. Sometimes it takes 5 minutes to get him on and by then he 2 ̆ 7 s lost the plot. Being somewhere different seems to make him worse 2 ̆ 7. 2 ̆ 7 Have you had him checked for tongue-tie? 2 ̆ 7 one mother asks knowingly. I listen in, deliberately eavesdropping now. 2 ̆ 7 Yes, the Child Health Nurse had a look but said his mouth is quite normal and the fussing is just his impatience to get the food 2 ̆ 7. She popped a dummy in the baby 2 ̆ 7 s mouth and he calmed down temporarily. My coffee is ready and I sit down for a few sips. 2 ̆ 7 My friend 2 ̆ 7 s baby needed a release for a tongue-tie which many health professionals missed but the chiropractor found. Maybe you should take him to a chiropractor? 2 ̆ 7 The baby squawks spitting out the dummy, and the mother firmly lays his flailing arms across his chest trying valiantly to latch him again. At this point I cannot resist getting involved too, my heart is pounding as I introduce myself as an international board certified lactation consultant (IBCLC) 2 ̆ 7 Gosh you 2 ̆ 7 re having a battle there. can I offer a suggestion? 2 ̆ 7 All three pairs of eyes look astonished at my bold intervention, but she gladly agrees 2 ̆ 7 Yes, whatever can help 2 ̆ 7. I verbally guide her to position her baby differently - his hip towards her hip, arms either side of her breast, his chest snuggling in contact with her own and holding him only over his shoulders allowing his head to fall back. She resists allowing his head to be free but complies as his chin rests at the base of her areola. Baby gapes widely and spontaneously latches as my hand supports her hand on his shoulders to maintain a secure hold. The expression on her face tells me she is greatly relieved. 2 ̆ 7 It doesn 2 ̆ 7 t hurt, 2 ̆ 7 she says with a look of disbelief <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> me, smiling. 2 ̆ 7 Great, remember what you and your baby have just done.

5000|$|All {{throughout}} her life Maria saw her parents attend meetings {{and participate in}} marches for reasons she learned more about over time. [...] " [...] She was not afraid of anyone" [...] recalls Maria and," [...] I saw my mother confront very powerful people". Maria describes her mother as the type of women [...] "you don't mess with". Maria's consciousness was raised {{at a very young}} age because she was in one of the center locations of many radical movements. Maria remembers traveling to Guanajuato, Mexico with her family during one particular summer and <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> the statue of El Pipila she recalls something coming over her. Immediately after staring at the statue of Juan Hose de los Reyes Martinez Amaro she began marching around the statue chanting [...] "Chicano power" [...] with her fist held high. In 1972 Maria and her family moved back to Austin, Texas that at the time was considered liberal and predominantly consisted of White-Anglo Americans. At this point in time Maria was very aware and conscious of racism unlike other children her age, and her change in environment was somewhat of a shock to her. Coming very an extremely radical environment to a liberal one like that of Austin was a big change in Maria's life. By the 1970s the social movements had become less radical due to an increase of involvement from the CIA and FBI's part. This was significant because many of the leaders were not U.S Citizen and risked being sent back to their country if they were not born in the U.S. Maria's mother became a beacon of Chicano feminism in the following years, and was writing two books at the same time. Maria recalls seeing her mother write for most of her life and saw how important it was for her mother to publish her first novel in 1977. Maria's mother Martha was an influential activist among many other things, and someone who greatly influenced Maria's life for many reasons. Maria's interests include the U.S third World Feminist Theory, Latino studies, ethnic mondernisms in the United States, literature by women of color, and history of Anthropology & Folklore.|$|E

She managed to grab hold of a ledge and called for Billie to help her. Billie managed to save Kat by pulling her back over. At the hospital, Billie reiterated that she did not start the fire, before she was transferred to a hospital in the city.|$|R
6000|$|So {{that day}} also, {{the last of}} the long siege, wore away. At nightfall the thick mist cleared, and for the last time the rich rays of sunset shone upon the gleaming roof and burning pinnacles of the Temple and were {{reflected}} from the dazzling whiteness of its walls. Never had it looked more beautiful than it did in that twilight as it towered, still perfect, above the black ruins of the desolated city. The clamour and shouting had died away, even the mourners had ceased their pitiful cries; except the guards, the Romans had withdrawn and were eating their evening meal, while those who worked the terrible engines ceased from their destroying toil. Peace, an ominous peace, brooded on the place, and everywhere, save for the flames that crackled among the cedar-wood beams in the roofs of the cloisters, was deep silence, such as in tropic lands precedes the bursting of a cyclone. To Miriam who watched, it seemed as though {{in the midst of this}} unnatural quiet Jehovah was withdrawing Himself from the house where His Spirit dwelt and from the people who worshipped Him with their lips, but rejected Him in their hearts. Her tormented nerves shuddered with a fear that was not of the body, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> upwards <b>at</b> the immense arch of the azure evening sky, half expecting that her mortal eyes would catch some vision of the departing wings of the Angel of the Lord. But there she could see nothing except the shapes of hundreds of high-poised eagles. [...] "Where the carcase is there shall the eagles be gathered together," [...] she muttered to herself, and remembering that these four birds were come to feast upon the bones of the whole people of the Jews and upon her own, she shut her eyes and groaned.|$|R

Having pretty sharp eyes of our own, we both of us knew that a workhouse was no fit place for her. Her gown was very dusty, {{and one of her}} boots was burst, and her hair was draggled all over her face, and her eyes was sunk in her head, like; but we saw somehow that she was a lady--or, if she wasn't exactly a lady, that no workhouse was proper for her, at any rate. I stooped down to speak to her; but her baby was crying so dreadful she could hardly hear me. 'Is the poor thing ill?' says I. 'Starving,' says she, in such a desperate, fierce way, that it gave me a turn. 'Is that your child?' says I, a bit frightened about how she'd answer me. 'Yes,' she says in quite a new voice, very soft and sorrowful, and bending her face away from me over the child. 'Then why don't you suckle it?' says I. She looks up at me, and then at Jenny and shakes her head, and says nothing. I give my baby to Jemmy to hold, and went and sat down by her. He walked away a little; and I whispered to her again, 'Why don't you suckle it?' and she whispered to me, 'My milk's all dried up.
