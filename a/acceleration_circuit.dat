In particular, {{an extension of the}} fast adder carry-skip procedure is carried out for special purpose cellular array circuits implementing iterative logical functions for which some propagating information may be fruitfully computed ahead of the current step output computation. This information is thus carried to the next stage, accelerating the overall calculation.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, a novel {{topology}} for generating a 17 -level inverter using three-level flying capacitor inverter and cascaded H-bridge modules with floating capacitors. The proposed circuit is analyzed and {{various aspects of}} it are presented in the paper. This circuit is experimentally verified {{and the results are}} shown. The stability of the capacitor balancing algorithm has been verified during sudden <b>acceleration.</b> This <b>circuit</b> has many pole voltage redundancies. This circuit has an advantage of balancing all the capacitor voltages instantaneously by switching through the redundancies. Another advantage of this topology is its ability to generate all the 17 pole voltages from a single DC link which enables back to back converter operation. Also, the proposed inverter can be operated at all load power factors and modulation indices. Another advantage is, if one of the H-bridges fail, the inverter can still be operated at full load with reduced number of levels...|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} testing of a small {{inductive}} pulsed plasma thruster (IPPT) is described. The device was built as a test-bed for the pulsed gas-valves and solid-state switches required for a thruster of this kind, and {{was designed to be}} modular to facilitate modification. The thruster in its present configuration consists of a multi-turn, spiral-wound acceleration coil (270 millimeters outer diameter, 100 millimeters inner diameter) driven by a 10 microfarad capacitor and switched with a high-voltage thyristor, a propellant delivery system including a fast pulsed gas-valve, and a glow-discharge pre-ionizer <b>circuit.</b> The <b>acceleration</b> coil <b>circuit</b> may be operated at voltages up to 4 kilovolts (the thyristor limit is 4. 5 kilovolts) and the thruster operated at cyclic-rates up to 30 Herz.

40|$|Abstract—We {{present results}} from {{successful}} implementation of long-term (> 10 seconds) real-time integration of acceleration to measure position. We evaluated two analog circuit designs for double integration of an <b>acceleration</b> signal. Our <b>circuit</b> design features three high-pass filters and two first order integrators, leading to a critically damped double integrator. The second design we have implemented is a second order underdamped integrator reported in the literature. Accuracy of both circuits in sensing position based on only accelerometer readings was experimentally evaluated by comparison with encoder readings. We conclude that a critically damped double integrator coupled with an accelerometer is well-suited for frequency domain system identification, thanks to reliable position measurement capability with minimal interference to system dynamics.

40|$|With {{the advent}} of mobile {{electronics}} requiring ever more computing power from a limited energy supply, {{there is a need}} for efficient systems capable of maximizing this ratio. Architectural enhancements must therefore be designed to enable high performance, all the while maintaining the power advantage. The technique proposed in this paper allows the <b>acceleration</b> of combinatorial <b>circuits</b> beyond the performance generally achievable by conventional synthesis and timing closure, by exploiting the data-dependent delay variations inherent in such circuits. Through the automatic insertion of transition detectors within the target circuit, the progress of operations underway can be monitored and prematurely completed, thereby increasing the operation speed from the worst toward the average case. In addition, a synthesis flow is proposed to increase the proportion of fast paths, thereby increasing the technique’s impact. The proposed technique was applied automatically to a series of benchmark circuits, and the synthesis results show it to achieve good performance, with an average increase of 29 % over conventional synthesis, for an average energy increase of < 21 % overall...|$|R
40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the validity of}} an accelerometer to measure impacts in team sports. 76 participants completed a team sport <b>circuit.</b> <b>Accelerations</b> were collected concurrently at 100  Hz using an accelerometer and a 36 -camera motion analysis system. The largest peak accelerations per movement were compared in 2 ways: i) pooled together and filtered at 13 different cut-off frequencies (range 6 - 25  Hz) to identify the optimal filtering frequency, and ii) the optimal cut-off frequency split into the 7 movements performed (n= 532). Raw and 25 - 16  Hz filtering frequencies significantly overestimated and 6  Hz underestimated motion analysis peak accelerations (P < 0. 007). The 12  Hz filtered accelerometer data revealed the strongest relationship with motion analysis data (accuracy -  0. 01 ± 0. 27  g, effect size -  0. 01, agreement -  0. 55 to 0. 53  g, precision 0. 27  g, and relative error 5. 5 %; P= 1. 00). The accelerometer underestimated peak accelerations during tackling and jumping, and overestimated during walking, jogging, sprinting and change of direction. Lower agreement and reduced precision were associated with sprinting, jumping and tackling. The accelerometer demonstrated an acceptable level of concurrent validity compared to a motion analysis system when filtered at a cut-off frequency of 12  Hz. The results advocate the use of accelerometers to measure movements in team sport...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [138]- 142) Accurate {{measurements of}} the displacements in large- scale structures (e. g., buildings, dams, bridges, and lifeline facilities) are important to characterize the response to wind, impact, seismic, or other extreme loads. Traditionally, structural displacements have been recorded indirectly using accelerometers strategically placed throughout a structure. The acceleration data is subsequently post-processed off-line to obtain the displacement time histories. The development of a method to compute structural displacements more quickly, easily, and accurately {{has been identified as}} a research need by several recent national workshops. More recent technologies such as fiber optics, lasers, photogrammetry, ultrasonics, and micromachined silicon accelerometers are reviewed to determine their suitability as a basis for a structural displacement sensor. A conceptual design for a fiber optic optical time domain reflectometry (OTDR) sensor is presented as an alternative technology to the widely used accelerometer method to measure displacements. Because accelerometers are widely used to record structural response, a prototype real-time <b>acceleration</b> processing (RAP) <b>circuit</b> is developed and tested which utilizes existing accelerometer arrays to directly obtain displacements in real-time. Based on artificial input test signals, the displacements computed by the RAP system show close accuracy with the displacements calculated from numerical integration of the acceleration signal and with the output of a linear variable differential transformer. Initial tests of the temperature response of the RAP system indicate that the circuit performs satisfactorily when subjected to extreme temperature. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|R
