40|$|It {{has long}} been my belief that the greatness of America has risen in large part out of the {{diversity}} of her peoples. Before the war, peoples of Japanese ancestry were a small but valuable element in our population. Their record of law-abiding, industrious citizenship was surpassed by no other group. Their contributions to the arts, agriculture, and science were indisputable evidence that the majority of them believed in America and were growing with America. Then war came with the nation of their parental origin, The ensuing {{two and a half years}} have brought heartaches to many in our population. Among the casualties of war has been America’s Japanese minority. It is my hope that the wounds which it has received in the great uprooting will heal. It is my prayer that other Americans will fully realize that to condone the whittling away of the rights of any one minority group is to pave the way for us all to lose the guarantees of the Constitution. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>has</b> said, “Americanism is a matter of the mind and heart; Americanism is not, and never was, a matter of race or ancestry. ...|$|E

MINIMUM WAGE is now $ 4. 25 per hour, and Congress is talking about increasing it. If the minimum were to be increased to $ 25 per hour many workers would lose their jobs.

If the minimum is raised instead to just $ 5. 15 per hour (<b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>has</b> proposed) the effect will not be obvious, and much research effort will be devoted to uncovering it. If only Congress could be persuaded to randomize {{the timing of the}} increase (perhaps by giving each employer or each local labor market a lottery number with lump sum compensation), we might learn something about the employment effects of minimum wages (although there would still be the problem of predicting the market effect of a general change from the effects of local changes).

40|$|The {{public can}} now “friend” the White House {{and scores of}} {{agencies}} on social networks, virtual worlds, and video-sharing sites. The Obama Administration sees this trend as crucial to enhancing governmental transparency, public participation, and collaboration. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>has</b> underscored, government needs {{to tap into the}} public’s expertise because it doesn’t have all of the answers. To be sure, Government 2. 0 might improve civic engagement. But it also might produce privacy vulnerabilities because agencies often gain access to individuals’ social network profiles, photographs, videos, and contact lists when interacting with individuals online. Little would prevent agencies from using and sharing individuals’ social media data for more than policymaking, including law enforcement, immigration, tax, and benefits matters. Although people may be prepared to share their views on health care and the environment with agencies and executive departments, they may be dismayed to learn that such policy collaborations carry a risk of government surveillance. This Essay argues that government should refrain from accessing individuals’ social media data on Government 2. 0 sites. Agencies should treat these sites as one-way mirrors, where individuals can see government’s activities and engage in policy discussions but where government cannot use, collect, or distribute individuals’ social media information. A “one-way mirror” policy would facilitate democratic discourse, enhance government accountability, and protect privacy...|$|E

Individuals, families, businesses, groups, and organizations of every conceivable type are ta king success­ful action to combat drug abuse, illiteracy, inadequate education, environmental decay, homelessness, hunger, AIDS, and other critical ills. By reclaiming a drug-plagued, crime-ridden neighborhood, tutoring those who are illiterate, mentoring a troubled young person, befriending a lonely senior dtizen, providing hOUSing for the homeless, or protecting our environment, Americans have enriched their communities and, in doing so, have brought meaning and ful­fillment to their own lives. Daily Points of Light recognition is intended not only to honor those who are making a difference in thelives of those in need, but more importantly to urge every individual, family, business, union, school, place of worship, club, group, and other institution in America to make serving others central to their life and work. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>has</b> said, "Ifyou have a hammer, fmd a nail.

" Points of Light demonstrate that problems in America can be solved. The PresIdent believes that every American wants to be a Point of Light to those in need, if only they are shown how they can make a difference.
