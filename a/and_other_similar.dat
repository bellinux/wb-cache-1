5|$|Despite being a French-language publication, the gazette {{was seen}} as {{independent}} of France. Its production was tolerated and even encouraged by the authorities, who often used Gazette de Leyde <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>similar</b> publications for their own ends, when wishing to publicize information {{that could not be}} released via the official channels. The paper also gave voice to institutions like the Parliament of France that were finding it difficult to publish in the official French newspaper, the Gazette de France.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the setbacks at the Defile, Marj Ardabil <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>similar</b> disasters, the need to reinforce the buckling frontiers stretched the military and financial resources of the Caliphate. This was especially the case with the powerful Syrian army, the main pillar of the Umayyad regime, which was parcelled out to reinforce distant provinces. Eventually, this weakening of the Syrian army would be the major factor in the fall of the Umayyad dynasty during the civil wars of the 740s and the Abbasid Revolution that followed them.|$|E

5|$|A few British leaders, {{particularly}} Lord Mountbatten, {{the last}} British viceroy of India, were also uncomfortable with breaking links between independent India and the princely states. The development of trade, commerce and communications during the 19th and 20th centuries had bound the princely {{states to the}} British India through a complex network of interests. Agreements relating to railways, customs, irrigation, use of ports, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>similar</b> agreements would get terminated, posing {{a serious threat to}} the economic life of the subcontinent. Mountbatten was also persuaded by the argument of Indian officials such as V. P. Menon that the integration of the princely states into independent India would, to some extent, assuage the wounds of partition. The result was that Mountbatten personally favoured and worked towards the accession of princely states to India following the transfer of power, as proposed by the Congress.|$|E

Greek schools were founded and expanded in several Greek-populated villages and towns, such as Labovo, Lekli, Nivani, Dhroviani, Filiates, Delvina, Permet. In Constantinople, education facilities were also founded that included nurseries, primary and secondary schools, which were collectively known as the Zappeion Institute. Moreover, {{a large amount of}} money was deposited in the National Bank of Greece to provide scholarships for Greek agricultural students in order to conduct postgraduate studies in Western Europe.|$|E

5|$|Keynesian {{economics}} were officially discarded by the British Government in 1979, but {{forces had}} begun to gather against Keynes's ideas over 30 years earlier.

Its members included the Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises along with the then young Milton Friedman.

In May 2006, the squadron was collectively decorated with the Order of Nikola Šubić Zrinski for the bravery of its members during the Croatian War of Independence; however, no individual decorations were awarded to squadron members, nor were any promoted {{as a result of}} their service. On the 15th anniversary of the arrival of the Libertas convoy in besieged Dubrovnik a celebration was held, but no squadron volunteers were invited to attend.

5|$|The {{first phase}} of this work took place from 1539 until autumn 1540.

Philip Chute, John Fletcher and William Oxenbridge, all prominent local men, served as the commissioners for the project, Oxenbridge becoming the pay master. Finding sufficient numbers of workmen was difficult and some had to be pressed into service unwillingly. More artillery pieces were sent to the castle ahead of the work being completed, and were probably installed in temporary battery positions around the castle site.|$|E
5|$|The nest of the dusky woodswallow {{consists}} of twigs, roots <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>similar</b> foliage matted {{together to form}} a bowl shape, which is lined with grass. It is positioned safely, behind bark, and/or high in a tree branch, and sometimes in a hollowed out tree stump. The nest is made during the period from August to January, {{and with the help of}} several birds. The mated pair will then guard the nest, while others will help them take care of the babies. The female lays white eggs, of which there are usually no more than three or four. While the incubation period lasts for sixteen days, the amount of time taken for fledgling can be this long to around twenty days.|$|E

5|$|This decade also {{witnessed}} {{the emergence of}} a variety of new religious movements and newly established religions in the United States, creating a spiritual milieu from which the New Age drew upon; these included the San Francisco Zen Center, Transcendental Meditation, Soka Gakkai, the Inner Peace Movement, the Church of All Worlds, and the Church of Satan. Although there had been an established interest in Asian religious ideas in the U.S. from at least the eighteenth-century, many of these new developments were variants of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Sufism which had been imported to the West from Asia following the U.S. government's decision to rescind the Asian Exclusion Act in 1965. In 1962 the Esalen Institute was established in Big Sur, California. It was from Esalen <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>similar</b> personal growth centers which had developed links to humanistic psychology that the human potential movement emerged, which would also come to exert a strong influence on the New Age.|$|E
5|$|This line — {{with many}} non-hamburger sandwiches, {{including}} chicken and fish — significantly expanded {{the breadth of}} the Burger King menu. The amount of new additions, several new sandwiches made with disparate ingredients was made possible due the design of Burger King's kitchen. The chain's kitchen is modeled around a more flexible concept that allows for a multiple work-flow operations where preparation stations can be re-tasked more easily. In comparison, McDonald's kitchen at the time was a more rigidly designed assembly line concept intended to quickly produce a more uniform product and was not easily adapted to new products. This more rigid system prevented McDonald's from broadening its menu to effectively competing with Burger King <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>similar</b> chains that were more flexible and were better positioned to expand their menu.|$|E
