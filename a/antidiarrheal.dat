40|$|Objectives: The SWAN study {{compared}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} switching to an ATV-containing regimen versus continuing unmodified ARV regimen (control) in subjects on stable PI ± ritonavir (RTV) -containing HAART. Methods: In this Phase IIIb, 48 week, multicenter, open-label, randomized, prospective study, PI-treated subjects with no previous PI virologic failure and HIV- 1 RNA < 50 c/mL, were randomized 2 : 1 to either switch PI(s) to ATV vs control. Primary endpoint: proportion of viral rebounds (VReb) (confirmed ³ 50 c/mL) at 48 weeks. Results: 407 subjects were treated (274 ATV, 133 control). Baseline median CD 4 cell count was 490 cells/mm 3. 54 % used boosted PIs at screening (lopinavir/RTV 37 %). Mean time (months) on prior ARV: 40. 3 PI, 46. 7 NRTI, 16. 0 NNRTI. [...] . Gastrointestinal symptoms were reported in 8 % of subjects on ATV vs 13 % on control, with less use of <b>antidiarrheals</b> observed in the ATV arm (p< 0. 05). Improvements in all lipid fractions were observed in the ATV arm (non-HDL-C ¯ 18 % vs ¯ 3 %; p< 0. 0001). Rates of grade 3 / 4 ALT elevations were comparable overall (4 % vs 6 %) and in subjects with hepatitis C and/or B co-infection (14 % vs 16 %). Reports of SAEs were 10 % vs 6 %, with all 5 deaths in the control arm (4 %). Comparable rates of discontinuation (14 % vs 19 %), or discontinuation for AEs (6 % both) were reported (1 % of ATV subjects discontinued for scleral icterus/jaundice). Conclusion: Patients on boosted/unboosted PIs who switched to an ATV-containing regimen had significantly fewer episodes of viral rebound than patients who continued their prior PI treatment and maintained viral suppression for 48 weeks. In addition, patients switched to ATV had less use of <b>antidiarrheals</b> and significant improvement in plasma lipids. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Eosinophilic {{gastroenteritis}} (EG) is a {{rare and}} heterogeneous disorder characterized by gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and eosinophilic infiltration of the GI tract. Symptoms are dependent upon site of the GI tract involved and depth of involvement. The diagnostic criteria include: (i) the presence of GI symptoms, (ii) histopathology demonstrating predominant eosinophilic infiltration, (iii) the absence of other conditions that cause eosinophilia, and (iv) no eosinophilic involvement of organs outside the GI tract. Diagnosis requires a clinical history, physical exam, and documentation of any history of atopic disorders, allergies, and drug allergies. Laboratory evaluation includes a complete blood count with differential to evaluate for peripheral eosinophilia. Endoscopic evaluation with random biopsies remains the cornerstone for diagnosis. Histopathologic diagnosis typically requires an infiltration level of 20 or more eosinophils per high power field. Management strategies are based upon severity of symptoms and include <b>antidiarrheals,</b> dietary adjustments, and steroid therapy...|$|R
40|$|In {{clinical}} practice, nonspecific <b>antidiarrheals</b> (allopathic and ayurvedic) {{are most}} commonly used by clinicians along with routine treatment to hasten the recovery and to give psychological reassurance.

40|$|Irritable bowel {{syndrome}} (IBS) is {{a frequent}} and invalidating functional bowel disorder with entangled mechanisms. Its therapeutic approach is therefore complex. Classical therapies, prescribed alone or in combination {{in light of the}} predominant symptom, consist of anti-spasmodics, fibers, laxatives, <b>antidiarrheals,</b> and psychotropic agents. Other emerging pharmacological therapies, such as prokinetics, prosecretory or serotoninergic agents, bile acid modulators and antibiotics have been recently studied in clinical trials. Dietary measures can include reduction of short-chain poorly absorbed carbohydrates (FODMAPs) and gluten restriction. Assessment of food allergy can be proposed in a subgroup of IBS patients. Complementary and alternative medicine therapies, that are generally low cost and safe, appear to be appreciated by patients. Probiotics have demonstrated action on the gut microbiote modulation, and may be helpful in a subset of patients. Peppermint oil has an established visceral analgesic effect. Hypnotherapy represents an original, global and effective approach. Finally, education, reassurance and listening to the patient, leading to a solid therapeutic relationship, represents an essential backdrop of remedy or diet effectiveness.

40|$|A {{radiation}} {{or nuclear}} incident would likely result in {{vast numbers of}} patients, many of whom would require novel therapy. Although the number of radiation victims in the United States (USA) has been limited, we base our doctrine for treating radiation injuries on i) historical data, ii) animal research, and iii) human results derived from present medical treatment such as the care provided to cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy or chemotherapy. The medical management of radiation injury is complex. Radiation injury may in-clude the acute radiation syndrome (ARS), external and internal contamination, and cutaneous injury. Human and animal data have shown that optimal medical care can raise the nominal lethal dose of radiation by 50 % or more. The currently recommended treatment of the ARS in the USA involves supportive care, early use of cytokines, and judicious use of antibiotics. Supportive care for any significant radiation injury also would {{require the use of}} intravenous fluids, antiemetics, <b>antidiarrheals,</b> pain medications, and blood product sup-port. The role for cytokines will be described in some detail. The role for stem cell transplantation is contro-versial as no survival benefit has been demonstrated for this modality. The U. S. Food and Drug Administra-tion (FDA) has published clear guidelines for the use of potassium iodide (KI) to block uptake of radioactive iodine.

Only 22 % of the mothers consulted medical personnel concerning the diarrhea episode; 74 % treated their children with some type of medication while only 17 % {{of the children}} received the recommended treatment, oral rehydration therapy. Most children were treated inappropriately, often receiving a combination of antibiotics, <b>antidiarrheals</b> and other drugs. Bivariate and multivariate analyses showed that the variables that most consistently predicted any and all three of the behaviors were the child's age and the severity of symptoms. Mothers of children two years and older were less likely to consult or use ORT than mothers of children 6 - 23 months of age. Mothers whose children's diarrhea had lasted three or more days or who were vomiting were usually twice as likely to consult, give any type of treatment, or give ORT than mothers whose children had diarrhea for fewer days or who were not vomiting. diarrhea treatment ORT Honduras maternal behaviors...|$|R
