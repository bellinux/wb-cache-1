5|$|It {{had long}} been {{established}} Marcher custom to solve conflicts through private warfare. Hereford's problem, however, was his relative weakness in the Marches, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> facing open conflict with two different enemies. He therefore {{decided to take the}} issue to the king instead, in a break with tradition. King Edward again ordered Gloucester to stop, but the earl ignored the order and initiated raids on Hereford's lands. Hostilities continued and Hereford responded, until both earls were arrested and brought before the king. The real offense was not the private warfare in itself, {{but the fact that the}} earls had not respected the king's injunction to cease. In the parliament of January 1292, Gloucester was fined 10,000 marks and Hereford 1,000. Gloucester's liberty of Glamorgan was declared forfeit, and confiscated by the crown, as was Hereford's of Brecon.|$|E
25|$|During 1812 {{the people}} of the Caribbean provinces in New Granada {{remained}} mostly royalist. Those in the Santa Marta region had built strongholds at Tenerife and Chiriguana on the Magdalena River, leading the revolutionaries of Cartagena to burn the towns. On August 14, 1813, insurgent forces from Cartagena attacked Santa Marta itself, but were repulsed by a flank of royalist defenders near the city. With the defeat of Napoleon in 1814 and the return of Ferdinand VII to the throne, the Spanish authorities, {{at the behest of the}} king, decided to send troops to the Americas to reclaim the territories that had proclaimed themselves independent. From the point of view of the criollos, the king was ignoring the loyalty the American provinces had shown when he was in exile in France, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> asserting his right to govern as an absolute ruler.|$|E
500|$|For the {{knockout}} stages, England's first opponents were Argentina. Ramsey again {{showed his}} tactical awareness, <b>and,</b> <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> no longer using wingers, {{he decided to}} switch from 4–3–3 to 4–4–2. With Ball and Peters operating on the flanks, the midfield now boasted Nobby Stiles and Bobby Charlton in the centre. After a violent quarter-final (where the Argentine captain Antonio Rattín refused to leave the field after being sent off), England won 1–0 thanks to Geoff Hurst latching onto a cross from Martin Peters and heading home a goal. Ramsey came under fire when he stopped his players swapping shirts with the Argentinians in protest at their play and was then reported to have described Argentinian players as [...] "animals"; [...] "It seemed a pity so much Argentinian talent is wasted. Our best football will come against the right type of opposition—a team who come to play football, and not act as animals." [...] Jimmy Greaves in his 2009 autobiography, [...] "Greavsie", claims that Ramsey had said [...] "I've been a little disappointed that the behaviour of some players in this competition reminded me of animals". The belief that he had referred directly to the Argentinians as animals damaged Ramsey's reputation and made successive England teams unpopular abroad, particularly in South America.|$|E

500|$|On 16 September 1942, Freddie de Guingand, Montgomery's {{chief of}} staff, summoned Barkas and Tony Ayrton to Eighth Army {{headquarters}} near Borg-el-Arab. He told them {{this was to}} be top secret, that Alexander had been impressed by his visit to Helwan, and that he wanted Camouflage's advice. He introduced Charles Richardson, who worked for Dudley Clarke's secretive 'A' Force and was to implement the deception Montgomery needed. Richardson had not been trained in deception planning, given the accelerated training of staff officers in 1940, nor had he ever prepared a deception plan before. He was determined it should succeed, since, as he wrote, [...] "if it failed it would do far more damage than having no plan at all". de Guingand outlined the basic plan: an attack in the north, along the line of the coast road, with a feint some 20 miles to the south. The tanks would take two days to move into battle position from their forming-up positions. Engineering work was already under way. He then astonished them by asking them to hide the hundreds of tanks and field guns, and the thousands of tons of materiel, that were to be used for the decisive attack at El Alamein. Barkas had been hoping for such an opportunity, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> being offered the chance to camouflage perhaps the largest desert battle ever attempted.|$|E
2500|$|At noon on September 24, 1891, Goodfellow’s {{good friend}} and {{colleague}} Dr. John Handy was shot {{on the streets of}} Tucson. Handy had divorced his wife <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> trying to evict her from the home the court had granted her. When she hired attorney Francis J. Heney, Handy repeatedly threatened to kill him. Handy's finger-trigger didn't keep up with his hair-trigger temper. He assaulted the attorney on the street that afternoon and Heney shot him in self-defense. Goodfellow rode [...] by horseback to Benson, Arizona where he caught a locomotive and caboose, set aside just for him, to Tucson. In an effort to save Handy, he took over the engine from the engineer and drove the train at high speed, and covered the [...] in record time. Handy had been attended by Doctors Michael Spencer, John Trail Green, and Hiram W. Fenner until Goodfellow arrived in Tucson at 8:15 pm. He began operating on Handy at about 10:00 pm. He found 18 perforations in Handy’s intestines, which he immediately set about cleaning and closing. Goodfellow was too late and Handy died at 1:15a.m., before Goodfellow could complete the surgery.|$|E
