A range of 12 linear <b>atactic</b> <b>polystyrenes</b> was studied: monodisperse, bimodal blends, and a {{polydisperse}} commercial sample. Mn varied between 66, 000 and 490, 000 g/mol. These were given standardized thermal treatments and then subjected to uniaxial compression tests in the glassy state over the temperature range 40 to 95 &# 176;C and nominal strain-rates 10 - 4 to 10 - 3 s- 1. Their constitutive responses were interpreted {{in terms of the}} physically based three-dimensional constitutive model for small or large deformations in amorphous polymers proposed earlier (Polymer 1995, 36, 3301 - 3312), including plastic strain-induced structural rejuvenation. In multimode form, the model captured closely both linear viscoelastic response and yield and plastic flow. When the reduction of Vogel temperature caused by chain ends was incorporated in the model, it predicted a fall in yield stress with reducing molecular length. This was also observed in experimental data, with the rate of fall approximately in agreement.

The polymorphism {{behaviors of}} sPS within aPS and aPSNW were studied by in-situ wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) and {{differential scanning calorimeter}} (DSC). The sPS δ crystals transfer into γ and then R form crystals during the gradually heating process. The transition temperature of the δ to γ form crystals decreases {{with the increase in}} the aPS and aPSNW content in all samples. By contrast, the transition temperature of γ-to-R form crystals increases with the rising aPSNW content, whereas it is independent of the content of aPS. Meanwhile, the transition temperatures of δ to γ and γ to R in aPSNW are higher than those in linear aPS blends. When the samples were annealed at a temperature above 150 °C, the sPS δ form is not favorable to transform into the form in aPSNW. The results indicate that polymorphism behaviors of sPS are disturbed within aPS networks. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{response}} to deformation of a detailed computer model of glassy <b>atactic</b> <b>polystyrene,</b> {{represented as a}} collection of basins on its potential energy landscape, has been investigated. The volumetric behaviour of the polymer is calculated via ‘brute force’ molecular dynamics quenching simulations.

The stress-controlled uniaxial deformations fall in the linear elastic regime and the resulting strains are calculated as ensemble averages of QHA estimates over 200 uncorrelated inherent structures of the potential energy landscape. The elastic constants (Young’s modulus and Poisson ratio) and their temperature dependence are in very good agreement with experiments for glassy <b>atactic</b> <b>polystyrene.</b> Additionally, a classification of the deformed inherent structures in respect to the geometry and general shape of their energy minima is undertaken.

Liu et al. [Macromolecules 2006, 39, 8867] reached the same conclusion from an examination of their own dynamic mechanical modulus data for 1, 4 -polybutadiene, polyisobutylene, polystyrene, polycarbonate, and eight aliphatic copolymers. We verify that the data in these studies ostensibly support a universal Tg-normalized temperature dependence; however, a detailed analysis of viscoelastic data on many different polymers, from creep compliance measurements carried out in the same laboratory, shows unambiguously that the Tg-normalized temperature dependences of τn and η can vary substantially among polymers. Thus, the behavior of τn and η is not universal. 1...|$|R

The main surface modifications were investigated using water contact angle measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). By using a "temporal afterglow", our plasma treatment leads to the grafting of hydrophilic moieties such as C-O, C=O and O-C=O, minimising the degradation and mechanical processes at the surface. Ageing studies showed a better stability of the treatment under our experimental conditions, compared to published studies made under radio frequency or microwave plasma conditions. Ageing studies have also highlighted a surface relaxation with time, depending {{on the degree of}} crystallinity of the polymer.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. September 2015. Major: Chemical Engineering. Advisors: Frank Bates, Marc Hillmyer. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xviii, 241 pages. Bottlebrush polymers are comb-like molecules {{with a high}} density of side chains grafted along a central backbone. Due to their unique conformational properties, bottlebrush polymers have become attractive candidates for developing new photonic bandgap materials, nanotubes and nanowires, or drug delivery vehicles, to name a few. This dissertation primarily investigates the rheological properties and self-assembly behavior of bottlebrush polymer molecules made {{using a variety of}} different polymerization routes. A considerable portion of the work is directed towards the linear rheology of model, polyolefin-based bottlebrush polymers with independently varied branch and backbone lengths. These studies demonstrate how the tight spacing between branch points effectively precludes backbone entanglement in the polymer melts, but it does not inhibit the formation of entanglements among the branched side chains. Furthermore, the relaxation profiles reveal transient scaling behavior in which the dynamics transition from Zimm-like to Rouse-like at increasing relaxation times. These results highlight the distinct conformational character of bottlebrushes at different length scales. The latter parts of this work report on the self-assembly behavior of bottlebrush diblock polymers composed of <b>atactic</b> polypropylene and <b>polystyrene</b> side chains. The diblock samples are analyzed using small-angle X-ray scattering and atomic force microscopy. Nearly all of the samples display strong segregation between the two blocks, owing to the large molar mass of typical bottlebrush polymers. Consequently, only one experimental sample displays an accessible order-disorder transition temperature. The strong segregation is also shown to affect the ability of large bottlebrush diblocks to readily achieve well-ordered nanostructures by self-assembly. Finally, results of the most symmetric (by volume fraction) diblock samples are compared with predictions of a newly developed self-consistent field theory model, yielding remarkable quantitative agreement. The theory is further utilized to conclusively establish the molecular origins of the domain scaling behavior in lamellar forming diblock bottlebrush polymers...|$|R
