2500|$|While {{they lived}} in San Diego, Wyatt raced Otto Rex, the horse he had won in a card game. The horse was a {{frequent}} winner and sometimes Wyatt bought Josephine some jewelry with the proceeds. To feed her gambling habit, Josephine would pawn the jewelry to millionaire Lucky Baldwin, but Wyatt would later buy the jewelry back. Josephine eventually sold virtually all of her jewelry to Baldwin. Josephine was addicted to gambling on horse racing and her wagering increased until Wyatt gave her an ultimatum. [...] "You're not a smart gambler. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> business risking money that way. Now after this I'm not going to redeem any more of your jewelry." [...] He also told Baldwin to stop loaning money to Josephine, but she continued to gamble anyway. [...] He was furious about her gambling habit, during which she lost considerable sums of money.|$|E
2500|$|Brando {{acknowledged}} {{his professional}} decline, writing later, [...] "Some {{of the films}} I made during the sixties were successful; some weren't. Some, like The Night of the Following Day, I made only for the money; others, like Candy, I did because a friend asked me to and I didn't want to turn him down... In some ways I think of my middle age as the Fuck You Years." [...] Candy was especially appalling for many; a 1968 sex farce film directed by Christian Marquand {{and based on the}} 1958 novel by Terry Southern, the movie satirizes pornographic stories through the adventures of its naive heroine, Candy, played by Ewa Aulin. It is generally regarded as the nadir of Brando's career. The Washington Post observed: [...] "Brando's self-indulgence over a dozen years is costing him and his public his talents." [...] In the March 1966 issue of The Atlantic, Pauline Kael wrote that in his rebellious days, Brando [...] "was antisocial because he knew society was crap; he was a hero to youth because he was strong enough not to take the crap", but now Brando and others like him had become [...] "buffoons, shamelessly, pathetically mocking their public reputations." [...] In an earlier review of The Appaloosa in 1966, Kael wrote that the actor was [...] "trapped in another dog of a movie... Not for the first time, Mr. Brando gives us a heavy-lidded, adenoidally openmouthed caricature of the inarticulate, stalwart loner." [...] Although he feigned indifference, Brando was hurt by the critical mauling, admitting in the 2015 film Listen to Me Marlon, [...] "They can hit you every day <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> way of fighting back. I was very convincing in my pose of indifference, but I was very sensitive and it hurt a lot." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'It was sheer Insolence in you, I tell you,' said Mr Boffin, 'even {{to think}} of this young lady. This young lady was far above YOU. This young lady was no match for YOU.

6000|$|... "If you are {{thinking}} of travelling abroad, I can't spare the time. It isn't an affair of money, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> business to say so.

6000|$|The {{crowd was}} now so {{completely}} with Calvin that Winters hastened to explain: [...] "Cal is my deputy; {{he was acting}} inside his duty! He {{was trying to keep}} the peace <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> business fightin'," [...] and proceeded to arrest some fairly innocent by-standers, while the wounded desperadoes were being swiftly hidden away by their friends, and the remaining citizens of the town talked of what should have been done.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But if it {{had been}} paid then you would have--married Mr. Crinkett?' Sir John's manner as he asked the {{question}} was so gentle and so soft that it was felt by all to contain an apology for intruding on so delicate a subject. But when she hesitated, he did, after a pause, renew his inquiry in another form. 'Perhaps this was only a threat, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> purpose of carrying it out.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What!" [...] he {{said angrily}} to the girl; [...] "he has killed four of my men, and is doubtless one of Bruce's party who slipped through my fingers {{the other day}} and killed so many of my kinsmen <b>and</b> vassals. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> taken too much upon yourself, Marjory. It is not by <b>you</b> that he <b>has</b> been made captive, but by my men, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> power to give such promise as <b>you</b> <b>have</b> made.

6000|$|... 'The way to {{find the}} Devil behind the Cross, is to cower beneath it in weak idolatry, instead of {{grasping}} it in courageous faith,' said Mr. Ferrars. 'Such faith would <b>have</b> made <b>you</b> trust yourself implicitly to your father. Then <b>you</b> would either <b>have</b> gone forth in humble acceptance of the punishment, or else have stayed at home, free, pardoned, and guarded; but, as it was, no wonder temptation followed <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> force to resist it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{heard of}} it, at the time," [...] the Sirdar said, and motioned to Gregory to come up.

60|$|Jack. Of course it's mine. [Moving to him.] You {{have seen}} me with it a hundred times, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> right {{whatsoever}} to read what is written inside. It is a very ungentlemanly thing to read a private cigarette case.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I know. You mustn't think me {{so stupid}} as all that. It is a mortifying truth that I like <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> use for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But dear, {{suppose it}} was somewhere very grimy and narrow! Something--like some of those back streets I came through to get here.
