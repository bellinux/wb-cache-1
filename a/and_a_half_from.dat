5|$|As {{a four-year-old}} in 1882, Tristan showed much {{improved}} form and {{established himself as}} one of the leading racehorses in Europe by winning ten times in fourteen starts. He began the year by winning a Queen's Plate at Newmarket in April and followed up by winning His Majesty's Plate at Chester in May. At Epsom Downs Racecourse he ran twice at the Derby meeting. In the Epsom Stakes, a handicap race over one and a half miles, Tristan carried top weight of 124 pounds and won by a length <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>from</b> Retreat He then added the Epsom Gold Cup, the race which was the forerunner of the Coronation Cup, in which he successfully conceded twenty-seven pounds to a filly named Isabel.|$|E
5|$|In {{the town}} of West Bloomfield, US20 and NY5 go unnamed as they proceed eastward. Roughly one mile from the county line in the hamlet of West Bloomfield, US20 and NY5 meet the {{southern}} terminus of NY65. Exiting the hamlet, US20 and NY5 head through another area dominated by open land, intersecting Elton Road before passing seamlessly into East Bloomfield. A mile <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>from</b> the town line, US20 and NY5 intersect NY64, a road running northwest–southeast from the Monroe County line south to US20 and NY5. NY64, whose right-of-way ends at US20 and NY5 {{at the foot of}} a small hill, joins the two routes eastward on a triple overlap, entering the village of Bloomfield and intersecting the southern terminus of NY444 south of the portion of Bloomfield once known as Holcomb. Near the junction with NY444, US20, NY5 and NY64 take on a due east alignment, absorbing the routing used by Gauss Road west of this point.|$|E

5|$|It {{had taken}} a decade <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half,</b> <b>from</b> 1961 to 1976, for the {{production}} cost of the average Hollywood feature to double from $2 million to $4 million—a decline if adjusted for inflation. In just four years it more than doubled again, hitting $8.5 million in 1980 (a constant-dollar increase of about 25 percent). Even as the U.S. inflation rate eased, the average expense of moviemaking would continue to soar. With the majors now routinely saturation booking in over a thousand theaters, it was becoming increasingly difficult for smaller outfits to secure the exhibition commitments needed to turn a profit. Double features were now literally history—almost impossible to find except at revival houses. One of the first leading casualties of the new economic regime was venerable B studio Allied Artists, which declared bankruptcy in April 1979. In the late 1970s, AIP had turned to producing relatively expensive films like the very successful Amityville Horror and the disastrous Meteor in 1979. The studio was sold off and dissolved as a moviemaking concern {{by the end of}} 1980.|$|E
5|$|The dispute {{escalated}} when Baldwin deprived {{the monks}} {{of some of}} the revenues of their monastic estates. After that, Baldwin proposed to establish a church dedicated to Becket in Canterbury itself, staffed by secular rather than monastic clergy. The monks of the cathedral chapter saw this proposed foundation as the first step in an attempt to change the see of Canterbury from a monastic cathedral chapter, a peculiarity of the English Church, to the more normal pattern of secular clergy. It is not clear if Baldwin himself intended such a plan, but the other bishops supported the effort, as contemporary writers made clear. Baldwin sought the advice of Hugh, the Bishop of Lincoln, who advised Baldwin to abandon the plan as it would only cause distress to all parties. The controversy was long and involved and, at one point, the monks were imprisoned within their own buildings for a year <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half,</b> <b>from</b> January 1188 to August 1189. This led to the suspension of the liturgy in the cathedral. Eventually all the prominent ecclesiastics and monastic houses of Europe were forced into choosing sides in the dispute. In October 1189, in an attempt to gain control, Baldwin appointed Roger Norreys as the chapter's prior, an appointment widely acknowledged by contemporaries as putting a useless individual into the office. His plan for financing the church involved soliciting contributions from donors by promising a one-third reduction in penances for annual donations.|$|E
