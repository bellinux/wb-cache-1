40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} {{investigation}} into the modelling and simulation of an <b>aircraft</b> <b>tyre</b> and wheel assembly in finite element environment. The finite element simulations basing on <b>aircraft</b> <b>tyre</b> test and operational scenarios could predict the loads transferred from tyre and the stresses distributed to the wheel rim. The virtual analysis could assess the safety criteria of different tyre structures, which would lead to the cost and time circle reduction in tyre R&D process. An H 41 x 16. 0 R 20 radial ply aircraft test tyre and its corresponding test wheel, provided by Dunlop Aircraft Tyres Limited, are adopted as the subject of this research. The material properties, especially the rubber and fabric materials, have been investigated. The finite element hyperelastic models have been utilized to represent rubbers and been correlated to experimental data. The 2 D and 3 D finite element tyre models, along with the finite element wheel models are created in the commercial finite element code, LS-Dyna. The finite element models have been validated with either industrial standardised simulation results or experimental data. Basing on the validated models, simulations that duplicating static test and dynamic operational scenarios have been developed. The researches have provided knowledge in comparing single and double bead tyre designs with respect to wheel loading mechanisms. The computational model also allowed manufacturers to assess the performance and safety criteria of a particular tyre at its design stage. The development of such models would add to the general drive towards the use of more virtual prototypes in an area traditionally reliant on experimental testing...|$|E

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this paper describes a new low parameter mathematical model representing the force and moment components generated in an <b>aircraft</b> <b>tyre</b> for use in the computer simulation of takeoff, landing and taxiing manoeuvres of an aircraft. As such the problems addressed fall in the area of ground vehicle dynamics and the modelling of the tyre presents similar challenges to those involved in modelling automotive tyres, albeit on a much larger scale in terms of the size and the loads on the tyre. The model has been implemented in the Matlab/Simulink environment and designed to run initially with aircraftmodels defined by the industry standard multi-body systems program MSC. ADAMS (TM). An overview is provided of current automotive and <b>aircraft</b> <b>tyre</b> models along with a critique of the application and capabilities of these existing models for aircraftsimulation. The need for a model which can be used to fit the limited range of data available for aircraft tyres, compared with automotive tyres, is also discussed. The proposed low parameter tyre model (LPTM) uses a small set of model parameters that can be obtained without recourse to special software and can be easily manipulated to fit the model to available tyre test data. The model has been exercised and compared with two existing tyre models, using a multi-body computer model of a tyre test machine and has been shown to produce improved predictions of the important forces and moments generated in a tyre contact patch when validated against test data. The evaluation at this stage is related to the tyre characteristics needed to simulate vehicle braking and cornering manoeuvres and the validation is against available test data for the lateral force and aligning moment arising due to slip angle...|$|E

The model is tuned and validated through the correlation between simulated and experimental results relevant to a large <b>aircraft</b> <b>tyre.</b> The method proposed is tuneable on a specific tyre using a limited number of parameters, that are those usually recorded during standard braking tests and it is extendible to the braking tests of an aircraft.

Octahedral shear and normal stresses were calculated for extreme braking aircraft of various tyre inflation pressures and wheel loads. The historical increase in tyre inflation pressure of around 50 % was shown to have resulted in a moderate 10 % increase in the stress-strength ratio associated with the surface layer interface. The factor of safety associated with interface shear strength was shown to be negligible.

40|$|In this thesis, the Finite Element (FE) Analysis of <b>aircraft</b> <b>tyres</b> is presented. The {{modelling}} and {{simulations of}} detailed construction of tyre enable tyre manufacturers to evaluate new designs and development before a prototype is fabricated, and aim {{to reduce the}} research costs and efforts to optimise the current tyre design of tyres. The material properties is key in the FE modelling and analysis, a number of sample from the rubber compounds and reinforcement were used to characterise the elastic, hyperelastic and viscoelastic behaviour of material. In this research, two <b>aircraft</b> <b>tyres</b> were employed for correlation study {{to a number of}} design checks and standard tests such as profile growth, sidewall deformation, footprint, contact pressure, and load-deformation data. The burst simulation was carried out to investigate when and where the failure in tyre occurs and compares it with what happens in real-world burst test as an important procedure in tyre safety certification by aviation authorities. As a result, the virtual testing would shorten the design procedure by checking the design parameters in advance of tyre prototyping. Moreover, the FE parameters such as mesh size and tyre geometry are investigated for optimisation of the runtime and accuracy and improvements in the FE results. A number of simulations were run to determine generated forces and moments across the contact patch using a steady-state approach in presence of air as the tyre inflator to obtain a higher accuracy in prediction of the vertical stiffness and footprint area. In addition, the tyre was freely rolled on the runway using an explicit approach to investigate the energy dissipation and heat build-up per tyre rotation due to the tyre viscoelasticity.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{takes an}} {{interest}} in the tyre/road interface longitudinal force generated during steady-state pure cornering (also termed pure lateral slip or pure side slip). The corresponding force is referred as 'induced longitudinal force'. This force has been neglected until now in tyre/road interface forces modelling for the reason that it has been assumed insignificant for some types of tyres. However, in the present study, longitudinal force data recorded during pure cornering of a civil <b>aircraft</b> <b>tyre</b> have shown significant magnitude when they are compared with the corresponding lateral force magnitude. Thus, for this type of tyres, neglecting this force might lead to an inaccurate representation of the real tyre behaviour. The Poisson ratio, which describes the contraction of an incompressible material when it is stretched in one direction, is taken into account in a comprehensive physical approach to describe the generation of this force. It is shown that this induced longitudinal force acts as a braking force on the tyre. The developed model is validated using longitudinal force measurement data...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a new <b>aircraft</b> <b>tyre</b> model applied using a co-simulation approach for the multibody dynamic simulation of helicopter ground vehicle dynamics. The new tyre model is presented using a point follower approach that makes a novel contribution to this area by uniquely combining elements of two existing tyre models used by the aircraft industry, namely the NASA R 64 model developed by Smiley and Horne and the Engineering Sciences Data Unit (ESDU) Mitchell tyre model. Before the tyre model was used with a full helicopter model, a virtual tyre test rig was used to examine the tyre and to predict the tyre forces and moments for a range of tyre states. The paper concludes by describing the successful application of the new tyre model with a full helicopter model and the simulation of representative landing, take-off and runway taxiing manoeuvres. The predictive capability of the model is demonstrated to show the open-loop ground vehicle dynamics response of the helicopter and also the ground load predictive capability for the distribution of loads through the tyres, wheels and landing gears...|$|E
40|$|An {{aircraft}} pavement strength {{rating system}} has been internationally adopted since 1981. Since that time, <b>aircraft</b> <b>tyre</b> pressures and wheel loads have increased significantly {{and an increase in}} shear-related surface distress has been reported. The current strength rating system focuses on protection of the subgrade. It also includes a tyre pressure limit intended to protect stress-susceptible surfaces. However, the shear stresses in the surface layer {{have been shown to be}} a function of both the tyre pressure and the individual wheel load. A modification to the current aircraft pavement strength rating system is recommended. The proposed modification replaces the current tyre pressure rating with a classification number that reflects the contribution of both tyre pressure and wheel load to surface layer shear stress. Guidance is also provided on the selection of a surface rating and the granting of approval for usage by aircraft with more demanding wheel load and tyre pressure combinations. It is also recommended that efforts to include shear-related surface failure modes into routine pavement design tools be given high priority, as this will allow a more rational approach to surface rating selection. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Grou...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{influence}} of various factors affecting {{the severity of}} runway debris lofting mechanisms was investigated by performing numerical simulations and drop weight impact experiments to assess {{the likelihood of a}} stone impact. Geometrical characterisation of stones collected from airfields led to a generic model of a tyre rolling over stones of various shape with different overlaps, orientations, and densities. In numerical simulations of a 0. 4 m diameter <b>aircraft</b> <b>tyre</b> rolling at 70 m/s, a 10 mm diameter spherical stone was lofted at a maximum vertical speed of 35 m/s. For equivalent mass prolate spheroid stones, the loft speeds were 11 to 34 % lower depending on the stone orientation. Objects with flat surfaces exhibited different lofting mechanisms and lower angular velocities. The conditions most conducive to stone lofting were very stiff, small diameter, sharp cornered tyres rolling on ground with a high friction coefficient over spherical stones such that just under half the stone diameter was covered by the tyre. The stone loft speed was approximately proportional to the square root of the tyre tread stiffness. Finally, tyre tread grooves could throw stones upwards at the tyre-ground separation speed, which was 17 m/s for the conditions mentioned earlier...|$|E
40|$|A {{pavement}} strength {{rating system}} is internationally adopted {{in order to}} protect aircraft pavements from inadvertent overload. The system has two elements. The primary element is designed to protect the pavement against subgrade rutting and the second is intended to protect asphalt pavement surfaces. The surface-protection element is arbitrary and empirical, placing category-based limits on <b>aircraft</b> <b>tyre</b> pressures. In 2008, increases in the tyre pressure limits were proposed by aircraft manufacturers and these were approved in 2013. The research reported in this paper assesses the impact of tyre pressure and individual wheel load increases on calculated flexible pavement stress indicators, as well as identifying an improved surface layer protection element. Stresses were calculated near the surface, at the surface layer interface and at the subgrade. Tyre pressure and wheel load combinations included current (18 t and 1. 35 MPa), imminent (33 t and 1. 75 MPa) and future (40 t and 2. 15 MPa) aircraft. Surface layer stress increased significantly (20 – 30 %) with increases in both tyre pressure and wheel load. The subgrade stress increased near-equally (97 %) with wheel load but was insensitive (< 1 %) to tyre pressure changes. The ability of the current aircraft pavement strength rating system to protect pavements from the increasing demands of aircraft was demonstrated to be limited to the subgrade. It is recommended that the tyre pressure rating be amended to reflect the combined impact of both tyre pressure rating and individual wheel load. It is also recommended that ongoing efforts to incorporate additional asphalt surface failure modes into routine pavement design be given high priority. The importance of these issues is reinforced by the limited availability of remedies to counter any negative impacts of increased surface layer stresses, especially in hot climates. © 2016 Taylor & Franci...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2004. An {{assessment}} of heavy metal and pesticide pollution {{was conducted at}} a commercial airport in Pietermaritzburg, which is the base for a local crop spraying operation, {{as well as a}} small-scale aircraft maintenance centre. The study investigated the presence of heavy metals from the aircraft activities (tyre wear, emission and aircraft body attrition) along the edges of the runway. In addition, the study assessed the pollution of the soil {{in different parts of the}} airport (areas adjacent to the crop sprayer hangar and maintenance hangars drainage ditch) caused by organic chemicals (pesticides) originating from the washing and maintenance of the crop spraying aircrafts. A total of 37 samples were taken from the top soil (0 - 15 cm) adjacent to both sides of the runway, approximately 100 meters apart, for heavy metal assessment. Total metal concentrations were determined on a 1 : 1 HNO 3 acid extract analysed using inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy and the results compared with the baseline concentrations of heavy metals in the soils of South Africa. The average levels of the heavy metals in the soils were: Cd - 4. 4, Co - 76, Cr - 142, Mn - 6580, Pb - 64 and Zn - 70 mg/kg. The Cd and Co concentrations of all samples and the Pb and Zn concentrations of 86 % of the samples were above the South African guidelines for the maximum permissible contents of these metals (2 mg/kg Cd, 20 mg/kg Co, 6. 6 mg/kg Pb, 46. 5 mg/kg Zn) in soils. In addition, the concentration of Cr was significantly above these guidelines (80 mg/kg Cr) in 51 % of the samples. All the metals, except zinc, were highly correlated with one another indicating the source for these heavy metals is the same. In addition the concentration of these metals was high at sampling points adjacent to the runway where pronounced <b>aircraft</b> <b>tyre</b> wear marks were observed, suggesting that the aircraft activities are the sources of these heavy metals.
