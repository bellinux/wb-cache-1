5|$|On the {{outbreak}} of war, Huggins invited {{the leader of the}} opposition Labour Party, Harry Davies, to join <b>a</b> <b>coalition</b> <b>government.</b> Davies accepted without consulting his party caucus, much to the indignation of many of his contemporaries; Labour promptly split. The two Labour factions reconciled in 1943 and briefly threatened Huggins's premiership until a heated dispute over whether Labour should become multiracial led to the party's disintegration in 1944.|$|E

5|$|Between November 2009 and the British general {{election}} in May 2010, Dannatt {{served as a}} defence adviser to Conservative Party leader David Cameron.

Dannatt published an autobiography in 2010 and continues to be involved with a number of charities and organisations related to the armed forces. He is married with four children, one of whom served as an officer in the Grenadier Guards.|$|E

During the evening, Brown visited Buckingham Palace to tender his resignation as Prime Minister to Queen Elizabeth II and to recommend that she invite the Leader of the Opposition, David Cameron, to form a government.

They agreed to restore the judiciary, but Zardari took a less stringent stance than Sharif. He met with U.S. ambassador Anne W. Patterson, who pushed for a pact with Musharraf. To strengthen the new coalition, {{he reached out to}} Awami National Party, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, and Baloch nationalist leaders, who had all boycotted the elections.|$|E

In 1996 the Angolan government bought military equipment from India, two Mil Mi-24 attack helicopters and three Sukhoi Su-17 from Kazakhstan in December, and helicopters from Slovakia in March.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} for the Legislative Assembly held on 2 April 1955 was a lively and closely fought affair, with several new political parties joining the fray. Unlike previous elections, voters were automatically registered, expanding the electorate to around 300,000. The SPP was soundly {{defeated in the}} election, winning only four seats. The newly formed, left-leaning Labour Front was the biggest winner with ten seats and it formed <b>a</b> <b>coalition</b> <b>government</b> with the UMNO-MCA Alliance, which won three seats. Another new party, the leftist People's Action Party (PAP), won three seats.|$|E

Consequently, senior figures from both parties embarked on a series of make-or-break meetings with representatives from the Liberal Democrats led by Nick Clegg, aimed at forming <b>a</b> <b>coalition</b> <b>government.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{seizure of}} {{territory}} within South Vietnam itself allowed Hanoi {{to extend the}} trail across the border with Laos and into that country. The signing of the Paris Peace Accords seemed to bring the conflict in Southeast Asia to an end. The last U.S. forces departed in March 1973. Both North and South Vietnamese were to maintain control in the areas under their influence and negotiations between the two nations, possibly leading to <b>a</b> <b>coalition</b> <b>government</b> and unification, were to take place. Jockying for control of more territory, both sides flagrantly violated the cease-fire and open hostilities began anew.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>coalition</b> <b>Government</b> of National Union was {{installed}} {{in the capital of}} Vientiane, but it soon ran into difficulties. By the 2 October 1962 deadline for the removal of foreign troops, the North Vietnamese had pulled out only 40 personnel, leaving approximately 6,000 troops in the eastern half of the country. Meanwhile, rightist elements (in control of the army) opposed the new government. The U.S. played its part by increasing its assistance to the right by covertly supplying the army through Thailand. Despite another international accord, Laos remained ensnared by the political and territorial ambitions of communist neighbors, the security concerns of Thailand and the United States, and geographic fate.|$|E

After the formation of <b>a</b> <b>coalition</b> <b>government</b> following the 2008 general election, he was briefly the Minister for Commerce in the Gillani ministry. After the 2013 general election, he became the Minister for Petroleum and Natural Resources in the third Sharif ministry, where he served from 2013 until the disqualification of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif after the Panama Papers case decision in July 2017.

This only temporarily placated the VNQDD, which continued its skirmishes against the Vietminh. Eventually, Chinese pressure on the VNQDD and the Dong Minh Hoi saw them accept <b>a</b> <b>coalition</b> <b>government,</b> in which Tam served as foreign minister. For the communists' part, they accused the KMT of intimidating them into sharing power with the VNQDD, and claimed that VNQDD soldiers had tried to attack polling stations. The VNQDD claimed that the communists had engaged in vote fraud and intimidation, citing Vietminh claims that they had received tallies in excess of 80% in areas controlled by French troops.|$|E
5|$|In the 1999 {{legislative}} election the FPÖ won 26.9% of the vote, its best-ever {{result in a}} nationwide election, and came ahead of the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) by a small margin. This led the ÖVP to agree to form <b>a</b> <b>coalition</b> <b>government</b> with the FPÖ in 2000. The FPÖ soon became uncomfortable with governing and fell sharply in the 2002 {{legislative election}}, in which it obtained only 10.0% of the vote; however, the two parties agreed to continue their coalition following the election. In 2005 increasing internal disagreements in the FPÖ led Haider and several leading members (including all the party's ministers) to defect and form the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), which replaced the FPÖ as government partner.|$|E
