5|$|Feminist economists Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum {{created the}} human {{capabilities}} approach {{as an alternative}} way to assess economic success rooted in the ideas of welfare economics {{and focused on the}} individual's potential to do and be what he or she may choose to value. Unlike traditional economic measures of success, focused on GDP, utility, income, assets or other monetary measures, the capabilities approach focuses on what individuals <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> This approach emphasizes processes as well as outcomes, and draws attention to cultural, social and material dynamics of well-being. Martha Nussbaum, expanded on the model with a more complete list of central capabilities including life, health, bodily integrity, thought, and more. In recent years, the capabilities approach has influenced the creation of new models including the UN's Human Development Index (HDI).|$|E
5|$|When {{a warrior}} is so old, or sustains an injury {{that means they}} can no longer serve their Clan, they retire to become elders. Elders live out the {{remainder}} of their life in general peace, using it as a time of rest and relaxation. They sleep in their own separate den, which is looked after by the apprentices. Elders are not expected to hunt or fight for their Clan, but <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so if the mood takes them. Their only expected duty is to carry the body of a deceased Clanmate to their grave. Every cat of the Clan respects and appreciates the elders, thanking them for the time they have spent upholding their roles as a warrior. Sadly, it is rare for a Clan to have more than three or four elders, as many warriors die before they can retire.|$|E

3000|$|... {{learners}} {{can be said}} to {{have learned}} something when three conditions are satisfied. They must <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> on demand, something they could not do before. They have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it independently of particular others, those others being primarily the teacher and members of a learning group (if any). And they must <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it well. Assessment of learning should be directed towards gathering evidence for drawing inferences about capability under these conditions, not the scaffolded conditions.|$|R
25|$|Like invertebrates, plants neither {{generate}} antibody or T-cell responses nor possess mobile {{cells that}} detect and attack pathogens. In addition, {{in case of}} infection, parts of some plants are treated as disposable and replaceable, in ways that very few animals <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Walling off or discarding {{a part of a}} plant helps stop spread of an infection.|$|E

Many webcomic creators make use of online advertisement on their websites, and some have undergone product placement deals with larger companies.

25|$|There {{are various}} forms of {{forgiveness}} interventions. One common adaptation used by researchers is where patients are forced to confront the entity preventing them from forgiving by using introspective techniques and expressing this to the therapist. Another popular forgiveness intervention is getting individual to try and see things from the offender's point of view. The end goal for this adaptation is getting the individual to perhaps understand the reasoning behind the offender's actions. If they <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this then {{they might be able}} to forgive the offender more easily.|$|E

25|$|Some {{behaviors}} are commonly observed among feral cats, {{although there is}} disagreement among veterinarians, rescuers, and researchers on the prevalence of some. In a free-roaming environment, feral cats avoid humans. They do not {{allow themselves to be}} handled or touched by humans, and back away or run when they <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. If trapped, they may hiss, growl, bare their teeth, or strike out. They remain fairly hidden from humans and will not approach, although some feral cats gradually become more comfortable around humans who feed them regularly.|$|E
25|$|Despite this, {{the birds}} are not {{classified}} as being able to recognize their reflection, because those that did were trained {{to do so and}} the animal must {{be able to do this}} without human assistance: it must also be shown that the birds <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this in the wild with no experience, just on their own intelligence. But even when an animal is trained to do this, it is still unknown if they are self-aware, or are just repeating the same movements and commands that they were taught so that they may receive a treat as a reward after they have correctly completed their task.|$|E
25|$|She also {{suggests}} video games can have social benefits for children, for example, video games {{can provide a}} topic of discussion and something over which children can bond, and can help children make friends; playing video games can increase a child's self-esteem when they are struggling in one aspect of their life, but <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something correctly in a video game; and, children can also learn to take on leadership roles within a multi-player online game. Christopher Ferguson, a psychologist well known for his video game research, conducted a study in which results suggest that violent games reduce depression and hostile feelings in players through mood management.|$|E

25|$|The genus Deinopis is {{the best}} known in this family. Spiders in this genus are also called ogre-faced spiders, due to the {{imagined}} similarity between their appearance {{and that of the}} mythological creature, the ogre. They are distributed nearly worldwide in the tropics, from Australia to Africa and the Americas. In Florida, Deinopis often hangs upside-down from a silk line under palmetto fronds during the day. It emerges at night to practice its unusual prey capture method on invertebrate prey. Its eyes are able to gather available light more efficiently than the eyes of cats and owls, and <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this despite the lack of a tapetum lucidum; instead, each night a large area of light sensitive membrane is manufactured within the eyes, and since arachnid eyes do not have irises, it is rapidly destroyed again at dawn.|$|E
25|$|Formerly {{a working-class}} neighborhood, Wrigleyville is the {{nickname}} {{to the neighborhood}} directly surrounding Wrigley Field. Also known as Lakeview West, its borders run from Cornelia Avenue and Grace Street, to Halsted Street and Racine Avenue. Wrigleyville features low-rise brick buildings and houses, some with rooftop bleachers colloquially called Wrigley Rooftops where people can purchase seats to watch baseball games or concerts that, while generally more expensive than tickets for seats within the park itself, come with {{all you can eat}} and drink service. Proprietors <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so under special agreements with the Chicago Cubs organization. Many Wrigleyville bars and restaurants (particularly on North Clark Street) feature sports-oriented themes. Bars such as Sluggers, Murphy's Bleachers, Casey Moran's, Rockwood Place, Sports Corner and The Cubby Bear host the Cubs crowds near the Wrigley Field intersection of North Clark Street and West Addison Street.|$|E
25|$|Another part of {{restructuring}} the movement comes from education; bell hooks {{points out that}} there is an anti-intellectual stigma among the masses. Poor people do not want to hear from intellectuals because they are different and have different ideas. As bell hooks points out though, this stigma against intellectuals leads to poor people who have risen up to become graduates of post secondary education, to be shunned because they are no longer {{like the rest of the}} masses. In order for us to achieve equality, people must be able to learn from those who have been able to smash these stereotypes. This separation leads to further inequality and in order for the feminist movement to succeed, they must be able to bridge the education gap and relate to those in the lower end of the economic sphere. If they <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this, then there will be more success and less inequality.|$|E

25|$|Air : The air {{signs are}} Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius. A native with mainly air signs {{will be an}} {{excellent}} communicator, concerned with ideas and theories of all kinds. They are looking for answers to life's questions and make good teachers and writers. Air people are more tense than they appear at first sight and may live on their nerves. They have many friends and acquaintances but may not be particularly interested in family life. They {{are interested in the}} latest technologies and <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a number of things at once. Air subjects are also very imaginative and quick-witted, but may be sarcastic and rude. A subject lacking air signs will have little imagination and lightness of touch. They have an over-emphasis on practicalities and can lack a sense of humour, and be boring company. They can find it difficult to communicate or to assimilate and explain new ideas. Planets in the 3rd, 7th and 11th houses, and an emphasis on mutable signs in the chart will help to compensate for this lack.|$|E
25|$|As theorists such as Ronald Coase {{have pointed}} out, all {{business}} organizations represent {{an attempt to}} avoid certain costs associated with doing business. Each is meant to facilitate the contribution of specific resources - investment capital, knowledge, relationships, and so forth - towards a venture which will prove profitable to all contributors. Except for the partnership, all business forms are designed to provide limited liability to both {{members of the organization}} and external investors. Business organizations originated with agency law, which permits an agent to act on behalf of a principal, in exchange for the principal assuming equal liability for the wrongful acts committed by the agent. For this reason, all partners in a typical general partnership may be held liable for the wrongs committed by one partner. Those forms that provide limited liability <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so because the state provides a mechanism by which businesses that follow certain guidelines will be able to escape the full liability imposed under agency law. The state provides these forms because it has an interest in the strength of the companies that provide jobs and services therein, but also has an interest in monitoring and regulating their behavior.|$|E
