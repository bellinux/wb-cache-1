5|$|The Hindu scriptures stress Rati's {{beauty and}} sensuality. They depict {{her as a}} maiden who {{has the power to}} enchant the god of love. When the god Shiva burnt her husband to ashes, it was Rati, whose beseeching or penance, leads to the promise of Kama's resurrection. Often, this resurrection occurs when Kama is reborn as Pradyumna, the son of Krishna. Rati – under the name of Mayavati – plays a {{critical}} role in the upbringing of Pradyumna, who is separated from his parents at birth. She acts as his nanny, as well as his lover, and tells him the way to return to his parents by slaying the demon-king, who is destined to die <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands.</b> Later, Kama-Pradyumna accepts Rati-Mayavati as his wife.|$|E

Several of those that had supported Banda {{at the time of}} the cabinet crisis later suffered demotion, dismissal or imprisonment <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands.</b> One of the new ministers appointed after the Cabinet Crisis in 1964, Albert Muwalo, was hanged for treason in 1976.|$|E
25|$|Basil's {{assumption}} {{of control over}} the imperial government did not go unchallenged by the military aristocracy, whose members, supported by the army, their large estates, and their extensive network of clients, had dominated it during the previous thirteen years, when Nikephoros Phokas and John Tzimiskes had ruled as nominal protectors of Basil and his younger brother, Constantine VIII. Thus, soon after Tzimiskes's death in January 976, his principal supporter, the Domestic of the East Bardas Skleros, was declared emperor. Maleinos, a Phokas adherent and hence opponent of Tzimiskes's supporters, remained loyal to Basil. Although he failed to prevent the rebel's outbreak from his original base around Melitene across the Anti-Taurus Mountains into Anatolia proper and suffered a heavy defeat <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> in late summer 976, Maleinos continued to serve as a loyalist general until the revolt's final suppression in 979.|$|E
25|$|As a child, Kallinger often {{rebelled against}} his {{teachers}} and his adoptive parents. He dreamed {{of becoming a}} playwright, and had played the part of Ebenezer Scrooge in the local YWCA's performance of A Christmas Carol in the ninth grade. When Kallinger was 15, he began dating a girl named Hilda Bergman, whom he met at a theater which {{he was allowed to}} visit on Saturdays. His parents told him not to see her, but he married her and had two children with her. She later left him because of the domestic violence she suffered <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands.</b> Kallinger was hospitalized at St. Mary's on September 4, 1957 due to severe headaches and loss of appetite which doctors believed was a result of stress surrounding his divorce. Kallinger remarried on April 20, 1958 and had five children with his second wife. He was extremely abusive towards his family, and often inflicted the same punishments on them that he had suffered from his adoptive parents.|$|E

25|$|The {{second day}} of the war {{commenced}} with a confident Kaurava army facing the Pandavas. Arjuna, realizing that something needed to be done quickly to reverse the Pandava losses, decided that he had to try to kill Bhishma. Krishna skillfully located Bhishma's chariot and steered Arjuna toward him. Arjuna tried to engage Bhishma in a duel, but the Kaurava soldiers placed around Bhishma to protect him attacked Arjuna to try to prevent him from directly engaging Bhishma. Arjuna and Bhishma fought a fierce battle that raged for hours. Drona and Dhrishtadyumna similarly engaged in a duel in which Drona defeated Dhrishtadyumna. Bhima intervened and rescued Dhrishtadyumna. Duryodhana sent the troops of Kalinga to attack Bhima and most of them, including the king of Kalinga, lost their lives <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands.</b> Bhishma immediately came to relieve the battered Kalinga forces. Satyaki, who was assisting Bhima, shot at Bhishma's charioteer and killed him. Bhishma's horses, with no one to control them, bolted carrying Bhishma away from the battlefield. The Kaurava army had suffered great losses {{at the end of the}} second day, and were considered defeated.|$|E
25|$|While she-tragedies {{were more}} comfortably tragic, {{in that they}} showed women who {{suffered}} for no fault {{of their own and}} featured tragic flaws that were emotional rather than moral or intellectual, their success did not mean that more overtly political tragedy was not staged. The Exclusion crisis brought with it a number of tragic implications in real politics, and therefore any treatment of, for example, the Earl of Essex (several versions of which were circulated and briefly acted at non-patent theatres) could be read as seditious. Thomas Otway's Venice Preserv'd of 1682 was a royalist political play that, like Dryden's Absalom and Achitophel, seemed to praise the king for his actions in the meal tub plot. Otway's play had the floating city of Venice stand in for the river town of London, and it had the dark senatorial plotters of the play stand in for the Earl of Shaftesbury. It even managed to figure in the Duke of Monmouth, Charles's illegitimate, war-hero son who was favoured by many as Charles's successor over the Roman Catholic James. Venice Preserv'd is, in a sense, the perfect synthesis of the older politically royalist tragedies and histories of Dryden and the newer she-tragedies of feminine suffering, for, although the plot seems to be a political allegory, the action centres on a woman who cares for a man in conflict, and most of the scenes and dialogue concern her pitiable sufferings <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|E
500|$|In March or April 1589 the Countess married Sir Christopher Blount, a {{relatively}} poor Catholic soldier 12 years her junior, {{who had been}} the Earl of Leicester's Gentleman of the Horse and a trusted friend of his. The marriage was a great surprise and the Earl of Essex complained that it was an [...] "unhappy choice". In the face of tittle-tattle that had reached even France, Lady Leicester—she continued to be styled thus—explained her choice with being a defenceless widow; like her marriage to Leicester, the union proved to be a [...] "genuinely happy" [...] one. Some 60 years later it was claimed in a satirical poem that she had poisoned the Earl of Leicester on his deathbed, thereby forestalling her own murder <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> because he had found out about her supposed lover, Sir Christopher Blount.|$|E

After suffering years of domestic abuse <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> Mariam bludgeons Rasheed {{to death with}} a shovel during a violent struggle. Hosseini stated that he hoped to create a multi-layered character in Rasheed, saying, [...] "Rasheed's the embodiment of the patriarchal, tribal character. In writing him, I didn't want to write him as an irredeemable villain. He is a reprehensible person, but there are moments of humanity, such as his love for his son." [...] He identified an encounter with an Afghan man four years earlier as the foundation for this character; the man [...] "had a very sweet, subservient wife" [...] and had not yet informed her that he was planning to marry again.|$|E
500|$|Lulla Rosenfeld {{writes that}} Henry Irving, the great Shylock before that time, played Shylock as [...] "morally {{superior}} to the Christians around him... driven to cruelty only by their more cruel persecutions." [...] In contrast, [...] "Adler scorned justification. Total vindication was his aim." [...] In Adler's own words, [...] "Shylock from the first was governed by pride rather than revenge. He wishes to humble and terrify Antonio for the insult and humiliation he has suffered <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands.</b> This is why he {{goes so far as}} to bring his knife and scales into the court. For Shylock, however, the desired climax was to refuse the pound of flesh with a gesture of divine compassion. When the verdict goes against him, he is crushed because he has been robbed of this opportunity, not because he lusts for Antonio's death. This was my interpretation. This is the Shylock I have tried to show." [...] The road from this to method acting is clear.|$|E
500|$|Coolbrith, {{sometimes}} called [...] "Josephina" [...] or just [...] "Ina", wrote poems beginning at age 11, first publishing [...] "My Ideal Home" [...] {{in a newspaper}} in 1856, writing as Ina Donna Coolbrith. Her work appeared in the Poetry Corner of the Los Angeles Star, and in the California Home Journal. As she grew into young womanhood, Coolbrith was renowned for her beauty; she was selected to open a ball with Pío Pico, the last Mexican governor of California. In April 1858 {{at the age of}} 17, she married Robert Bruce Carsley, an iron-worker and part-time actor, but she suffered abuse <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> and further emotional pain came from the death of the couple's infant son. An altercation between Pickett and Carsley resulted in a bullet mutilating Carsley's hand, requiring amputation. Carsley accused Coolbrith of infidelity, and she divorced him in a sensational public trial; the dissolution was final on December 30, 1861. Her later poem, [...] "The Mother's Grief", was a eulogy to her lost son, but she never publicly explained its meaning—it was only upon Coolbrith's death that her literary friends discovered she had ever been a mother. In 1862, Coolbrith moved with her mother, stepfather and twin half-brothers to San Francisco to ward off depression, and changed her name from Josephine Donna Carsley to Ina Coolbrith. Coolbrith found work in San Francisco as an English teacher.|$|E

The Dreamer becomes the subject of ridicule and his wife becomes the subject of pity by the community. The Dreamer decides enter the world of men and abandons his wife leaving her to seek refuge in her father. Her father wishes for her to marry a wealthy gentleman {{who is also a}} stranger in the town. The Dreamer heads into the desert and wanders until exhaustion takes its toll. A woman, [...] "The Desert Flower", finds him and takes him to her hut in the desert. There the woman spends her time looking over the garments of the man who courted her, the same stranger now attempting to marry the Dreamer's wife. The woman learns of the Dreamer's story and shows the dreamer the futility of conquering worlds unknown when he cannot conquer his own small corner of the world. The Dreamer sees himself in the roles of great conquerors, but each vision ends with death. The Dreamer's wife has been kicked out for refusing to marry the stranger, and is reunited with the Dreamer {{on the edge of the}} desert. The stranger is sent out into the desert and the Dreamer and his wife return to the town. In time, the Dreamer becomes respected by the community.|$|E
500|$|Inspired by Kumara Vyasa, {{the first}} {{complete}} brahminical {{adaptation of the}} epic Ramayana was written by Kumara Valmiki (a pseudonym of Narahari, 1500) and is called Torave Ramayana after the village Torave, where it was composed. As with the Mahabharata, this adaptation veers away from the Jain version by Nagachandra (1105). Nagachandra had used the champu metre popular in Sanskrit works and sought to portray Ravana as a tragic hero. In {{a departure from the}} original version (by Valmiki), the Jain epic ends with Rama's asceticism and nirvana. Kumara Valmiki's account, written in the Valmiki tradition, is in the shatpadi metre and is steeped in the author's devotion for the god Rama, an incarnation of the god Vishnu. According to the author, the epic he wrote was actually a recounting of Shiva's conversation with his consort Parvati. In this version of the epic, King Ravana, the villain, is one of the suitors at Sita's Swayamvara (lit a ceremony of [...] "choice of a husband"). His failure in winning the bride's hand results in jealousy towards Rama, the eventual bridegroom. As the story progresses, Hanuman, for all his services, is heaped with encomium and is exalted to the status of [...] "the next creator". At the end of the story, during the war with Rama, Ravana realises that Rama is none other than the god Vishnu and hastens to die <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> to achieve salvation. The chapter narrating the war (Yuddhakanda) is given prominence over all other chapters. The writing has remained popular for centuries and inspired folk theatre such as the Yakshagana, which draws from episodes of Torave Ramayana for enactment. The influence of the Puranic tradition and that of Madhvacharya are visible in this lively yet religious narration that uses every opportunity to glorify its hero, Rama. However, the author has been criticised for dwelling in abstractions and for not reaching the graceful poetic level of his predecessor Kumara Vyasa.|$|E
