25|$|In contrast, {{domestic}} and social agreements {{such as those}} between children <b>and</b> <b>parents</b> <b>are</b> typically unenforceable {{on the basis of}} public policy. For example, in the English case Balfour v. Balfour a husband agreed to give his wife £30 a month while he was away from home, but the court refused to enforce the agreement when the husband stopped paying. In contrast, in Merritt v Merritt the court enforced an agreement between an estranged couple because the circumstances suggested their agreement was more than a domestic arrangement.|$|E

25|$|Since 1979, {{schools and}} {{universities}} in the U.S. and abroad have introduced the Transcendental Meditation technique using private, non-governmental funding. The technique has been introduced on a voluntary basis, with parental consent, and teachers <b>and</b> <b>parents</b> <b>are</b> taught the meditation before the students learn. Often {{referred to as the}} Quiet Time Program, the students and teachers meditate for 10 to 20 minutes twice per day. The program consists of TM instruction and follow-up, as well as training of school faculty and staff to supervise the TM sessions offered at the school.|$|E
25|$|However, gender {{equality}} law has allowed surname transposition since 1999, {{subject to the}} condition that every sibling must bear the same surname order recorded in the Registro Civil (civil registry), {{but there have been}} legal exceptions. From 2013, if the parents of a child were unable to agree on order of surnames, an official would decide which is to come first, with the default being the paternal name. Since June 2017, the paternal name in first order stopped being the default, <b>and</b> <b>parents</b> <b>are</b> required to sign an agreement where the name order is expressed explicitly. The law also grants a person the option, upon reaching adulthood, of reversing the order of their surnames. The law applies only to Spanish citizens; people of other nationalities get the surname indicated by the law in their original country.|$|E
500|$|There is {{no known}} record of Point du Sable's life {{prior to the}} 1770s; his birth year, place of birth, <b>and</b> <b>parents</b> <b>are</b> unknown, though it is known from sources during his life that he was of African descent. Juliette Kinzie, another early pioneer of Chicago, Illinois, never met Point du Sable but stated in her 1856 memoir that he was [...] "a native of St. Domingo" [...] (the island of Hispaniola). This became {{generally}} accepted by scholars as his place of birth. Historian Milo Milton Quaife, however, regarded Kinzie's account of Point du Sable as [...] "largely fictitious and wholly unauthenticated". Quaife later put forward a theory that he was of French-Canadian origin. A historical novel published in 1953 (see below) helped to popularize the commonly recited claim that {{he was born in}} 1745 in Saint-Marc in Saint-Domingue (now Haiti).|$|E

500|$|There are two fonts: one, {{which may}} be medieval in origin, is a gritstone bowl of {{rectangular}} shape; the other, {{which may have been}} added during the 19th-century restoration, is an oval alabaster bowl, with rich decoration. The south wall of the chancel has a brass tablet to mark money received from Queen Anne's Bounty in 1720 and Robert Wynn, rector of Llantrisant, Anglesey, in 1727. There are various memorials on the interior walls. [...] Edward Wynne (who is buried in the churchyard), his siblings <b>and</b> <b>parents</b> <b>are</b> commemorated by various brass tablets. The 1937 survey of the church by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire claims that seven generations of Wynne's male ancestors were buried in the church, beginning with Rees ap Llewelyn in 1500. The survey also recorded that the church possessed a silver cup from about 1641 donated by Wynne, a silver cup and paten donated by his sister Ellin in 1703, and part of an oak table top with a Latin inscription and the date 1611.|$|E

2500|$|Beginning in the 1980s, {{many states}} {{received}} waivers {{from the federal}} government to create Medicaid managed care programs. Under managed care, Medicaid recipients are enrolled in a private health plan, which receives a fixed monthly premium from the state. The health plan is then responsible for providing for all or most of the recipient's healthcare needs. Today, all but a few states use managed care to provide coverage to a significant proportion of Medicaid enrollees. As of 2014, 26 states have contracts with managed care organizations (MCOs) to deliver long-term care for the elderly and individuals with disabilities. The states pay a monthly capitated rate per member to the MCOs that provide comprehensive care and accept the risk of managing total costs. Nationwide, roughly 80% of enrollees are enrolled in managed care plans.
