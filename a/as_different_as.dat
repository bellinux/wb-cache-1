5|$|Long {{before the}} first incarcerees arrived in March 1942, Manzanar was home to Native Americans, who lived mostly in villages near several creeks in the area. Ranchers and miners {{formally}} established the town of Manzanar in 1910, but abandoned the town by 1929 after the City of Los Angeles purchased the water rights to virtually the entire area. <b>As</b> <b>different</b> <b>as</b> these groups were, their histories displayed a common thread of forced relocation.|$|E
5|$|In some species, {{both parents}} care for nestlings and fledglings; in others, such care is the {{responsibility}} of only one sex. In some species, other members of the same species—usually close relatives of the breeding pair, such as offspring from previous broods—will help with the raising of the young. Such alloparenting is particularly common among the Corvida, which includes such birds as the true crows, Australian magpie and fairy-wrens, but has been observed in species <b>as</b> <b>different</b> <b>as</b> the rifleman and red kite. Among most groups of animals, male parental care is rare. In birds, however, it is quite common—more so than in any other vertebrate class. Though territory and nest site defence, incubation, and chick feeding are often shared tasks, there is sometimes a division of labour in which one mate undertakes all or most of a particular duty.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the {{benefits}} of the Rest Camp on the beach at Tel el Marakeb demonstrated before the Third Battle of Gaza, Desert Mounted Corps established an Ambulance Rest Station in the grounds of a monastery at Jerusalem. This was staffed by personnel from the immobile sections of Corps ambulances. Tents and mattresses and food extras were provided along with games, amusements, and comforts supplied by the Australian Red Cross. The men sent to this rest camp, included those run down or debilitated after minor illnesses. The troops were housed in conditions which were <b>as</b> <b>different</b> <b>as</b> possible from the ordinary regimental life.|$|E

25|$|In 1977, {{recombinant}} DNA technology enabled biologists {{to start}} to explore the genetic control of development. The growth of evolutionary developmental biology from 1978, when Edward B. Lewis discovered homeotic genes, showed that many so-called toolkit genes act to regulate development, influencing the expression of other genes. It also revealed {{that some of the}} regulatory genes are extremely ancient, so that animals <b>as</b> <b>different</b> <b>as</b> insects and mammals share control mechanisms; for example, the Pax6 gene is involved in forming the eyes of mice and of fruit flies. Such deep homology provided strong evidence for evolution and indicated the paths that evolution had taken.|$|E
25|$|Humans of {{the same}} sex are 99.9% genetically identical. There is {{extremely}} little variation between human geographical populations, and most of the variation that does occur is at the personal level within local areas, and not between populations. Of the 0.1% of human genetic differentiation, 85% exists within any randomly chosen local population, be they Italians, Koreans, or Kurds. Two randomly chosen Koreans may be genetically <b>as</b> <b>different</b> <b>as</b> a Korean and an Italian. Any ethnic group contains 85% of the human genetic diversity of the world. Genetic data shows that no matter how population groups are defined, two people from the same population group are about as different from each other as two people from any two different population groups.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} of Gascon is similar. Gascon presents {{a number of}} significant differences {{from the rest of the}} language; but, despite these differences, Gascon and other Occitan dialects have very important common lexical and grammatical features, so authors such as Pierre Bec argue that they could never be considered <b>as</b> <b>different</b> <b>as,</b> for example, Spanish and Italian. In addition, Gascon's being included in Occitan despite its particular differences can be justified because there is a common elaboration (Ausbau) process between Gascon and the rest of Occitan. The vast majority of the Gascon cultural movement considers itself as a part of the Occitan cultural movement. And the official status of Val d'Aran (Catalonia, Spain), adopted in 1990, says that Aranese is a part of Gascon and Occitan. A grammar of Aranese by Aitor Carrera, published in 2007 in Lleida, presents the same view.|$|E

25|$|The mtDNA {{from the}} finger bone {{differs from that}} of modern humans by 385 bases (nucleotides) in the mtDNA strand out of {{approximately}} 16,500, whereas the difference between modern humans and Neanderthals is around 202 bases. In contrast, the difference between chimpanzees and modern humans is approximately 1,462 mtDNA base pairs. This suggested a divergence time around one million years ago. The mtDNA from a tooth bore a high similarity to that of the finger bone, indicating that they belonged to the same population. From a second tooth, an mtDNA sequence was recovered that showed an unexpectedly large number of genetic differences compared to that found in the other tooth and the finger, suggesting a high degree of mtDNA diversity. These two individuals from the same cave showed more diversity than seen among sampled Neanderthals from all of Eurasia, and were <b>as</b> <b>different</b> <b>as</b> modern-day humans from different continents.|$|E

The scene was not written in the original script. The set for the core room in the Asuran city was the same set as Atlantis' gate room, though {{in order to make it}} look <b>as</b> <b>different</b> <b>as</b> possible, the cameras were placed at angles not usually used for filming in the gate room, such as where they would normally place lights.|$|E

[...] McKinley, who had appeared on one version of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition dollar (issued beginning in 1903), thus became the first person to appear on two different issues of American coinage.

Bowers suggested that Barber might have been trying to create [...] "a distinctively new version". Taxay agreed, opining that Barber's [...] "chief concern seems to have been in making the portrait of McKinley <b>as</b> <b>different</b> <b>as</b> possible from that on the Louisiana Purchase coins".|$|E
500|$|The head {{of comedy}} at Television Centre deserves {{six of the}} best for {{bringing}} back Chalk (BBC1) for a second term. If the opening episode of the new series is anything to go by, we are in for six of the worst half-hours of comedy {{in the history of}} television ... It is no surprise that the show has been relegated to a late slot. It is a watershed for smut. Some of the jokes were in the worst possible taste. The standards of comedy are so pitiful, Galfast High School should not have been given a grant from TV licence-payers' money and it is time it closed its gates for good.

[...] In a different perspective, James Montgomery of MTV compared the music video with Katy Perry's [...] "Teenage Dream," [...] writing that although both videos are [...] "essentially about the same thing: the fantasies of young, thoroughly modern women," [...] the fantasies are [...] "about <b>as</b> <b>different</b> <b>as</b> the women presenting them." [...] The Improper reviewer also compared the music video with Perry's [...] "Teenage Dream" [...] and noticed that the two music videos presented two contrasting end points, writing [...] "for Swift, it’s a marriage, a home and babies. For Perry, it's independence and the ability to define your own life." [...] To date, the video has over 243 million views on YouTube.|$|E
