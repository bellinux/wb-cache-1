5|$|Western {{developers}} {{began to}} return to the survival horror formula. The Thing from 2002 has been called a survival horror game, although it is distinct from other titles in the genre due to its emphasis on action, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> holding a team together. The 2004 title Doom 3 is sometimes categorized as survival horror, although it is considered an Americanized take on the genre due to the player's ability to directly confront monsters with weaponry. Thus, it is usually considered a first-person shooter with survival horror elements. Regardless, the genre's increased popularity led Western developers to incorporate horror elements into action games, rather than follow the Japanese survival style.|$|E

The tie in the NHA standings meant that the March 9–11 dates were spent on the Toronto – Montreal series, while the Toronto-Victoria series went ahead as scheduled, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> Sydney was not played.|$|E
25|$|Feminist Historiography {{is another}} notable facet of feminist history. One {{important}} feminist historiography writer and researcher is Judith M. Bennett. In her book, History Matters: Patriarchy <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Challenge</b> <b>of</b> Feminism, Bennett writes {{on the importance}} of studying a “patriarchal equilibrium”. Cheryl Glenn also writes {{on the importance of}} feminist historiography “Writing women (or any other traditionally disenfranchised group) into the history of rhetoric, then, can be an ethically and intellectually responsible gesture that disrupts those frozen memories in order to address silences, challenge absences, and assert women's contributions to public life” This facet of feminist history inspect historical writings that are typically assumed to be canon, and reinvents them under a feminist lens.|$|E

I was able to do that in front of millions of viewers. That was a remarkable experience—and it continues to resonate. The downside of that is also that it continues to resonate, and threatens to eclipse all else in one's long career if one does not up the ante and stay at it, in a way that may not ordinarily be necessary. I have to work at changing and constantly reinventing myself in a way that probably would not have happened had Star Trek not come along. I knew that going in, and I think that all of the perks attached to this journey have been really inexpressively great. So the negatives are small.|$|E
25|$|Barnhill was an {{abandoned}} farmhouse with outbuildings near {{the northern end}} of the island, situated {{at the end of a}} five-mile (8km), heavily rutted track from Ardlussa, where the owners lived. Conditions at the farmhouse were primitive but the natural history <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> improving the place appealed to Orwell. His sister Avril accompanied him there and young novelist Paul Potts made up the party. In July Susan Watson arrived with Orwell's son Richard. Tensions developed and Potts departed after one of his manuscripts was used to light the fire. Orwell meanwhile set to work on Nineteen Eighty-Four. Later Susan Watson's boyfriend David Holbrook arrived. A fan of Orwell since school days, he found the reality very different, with Orwell hostile and disagreeable probably because of Holbrook's membership of the Communist Party. Susan Watson could no longer stand being with Avril and she and her boyfriend left.|$|E
25|$|The {{failure to}} {{contemplate}} the possibility, that the troops at Y and S beaches might need to support the main landings, also exposed the failure to retain a reserve {{under the control of}} the Commander-in-Chief. Oglander speculated that had there been two battalions available, to land at the weakest point that the main landings had revealed in the Ottoman defences, Helles and Sedd el Bahr would have fallen by midday. Such a manoeuvre would have needed good communication between land and sea but the difficulty was underestimated and hampered British operations all day. The obvious difficulties of moving troops in open boats by instalments had been distracting, particularly the moments between disembarkation and reaching the shore, despite the confidence of the navy in its plans for bombardment. The apprehension was justified and the landing at V Beach was only saved from catastrophe by the covering fire of the machine-guns on River Clyde; defeat at W Beach was only averted by turning the Ottoman right flank. Lack of experience of opposed landings under modern conditions, made it difficult to rally scattered units <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> organising an advancing inland was underestimated. It had been a mistake not to stress to all members of the landing force, that there would be little time to move inland before Ottoman reinforcements arrived.|$|E

500|$|After the {{publication}} of [...] "The Raven" [...] in 1845, Poe became a household name and, having reached {{the height of his}} poetic fame, he was often asked to lecture or recite poetry at public events.
