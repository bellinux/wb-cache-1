5|$|David was {{conceptualized}} {{as a character}} to provide a non-human perspective for the theme of meeting one's creators in Prometheus, with him representing the next generation {{in a line of}} creators who finds himself disillusioned by his predecessors. Fassbender, who was director Ridley Scott's first choice for the role, helped fashion the character to share traits with T. E. Lawrence, who was a source of inspiration as <b>a</b> <b>control</b> <b>freak</b> caught between two cultures- the cultures being humanity and synthetics, in David's case. As the series progresses, David's behaviors and motivations evolve from a mysterious agent with ambiguous motivations to a character directly opposing the well-being of humanity.|$|E

He also stated that the band wanted to record a soul album. In the same liner notes, bassist Les Pattinson said that the band was often lazy and hence had hired rehearsal space at the Ministry in Liverpool. He said this made them work harder and develop [...] "language" [...] in the rhythm. According to guitarist Will Sergeant, McCulloch considers Heaven Up Here to be Sergeant's album because he was bossy and <b>a</b> <b>control</b> <b>freak</b> during the recording.|$|E
500|$|On June 6, 1990, {{recording}} for Off the Deep End officially {{began at}} Santa Monica Sound Records, in Santa Monica, California. The first recording session started with [...] "Airline Amy". These recording sessions {{marked the first}} time Yankovic self-produced his songs, after six albums with Rick Derringer. [...] The producer and musician had parted ways because Derringer found that Yankovic would not listen to his input, and Yankovic came to realize that he could do most of the production work himself. Subsequent studio albums would be produced by Yankovic. In regards to this split, Yankovic said: [...] "We [...] had a great run with Rick, he’s a terrific guybut I had become more and more of <b>a</b> <b>control</b> <b>freak</b> over the years, and I’d finally gotten to the point in my recording career where I felt that I could capably hold the reins all by myself."

500|$|Despite the lukewarm {{reception}} of the Alien prequel films, Michael Fassbender's portrayal of David was met with critical acclaim, with his performance {{generally considered to be}} the standout. Following the critics screening of Prometheus in May 2012, critics from a number of media companies, including /Film and Screen International, proclaimed Fassbender to have been the highlight of the film. Forrest Wickman of Slate magazine lauded Fassbender for being able to emulate uncanny valley through his mannerisms alone and ranked David as being the greatest portrayal of an android to date. Philip French from The Guardian praised the character for being a cross between the fictional valet Jeeves, created by P. G. Wodehouse, and a double agent commonly found in an English Renaissance theatre production. French further complimented the character for paying homage to T. E. Lawrence by being portrayed as <b>a</b> <b>control</b> <b>freak</b> caught between two cultures- the parallel in Prometheus being that David is caught between humanity and synthetics. Referencing the Titan Prometheus of Greek mythology, Kwaak Je-yup stated in his review of Prometheus that Fassbender [...] "steals fire" [...] in every scene, upstaging Noomi Rapace's leading performance as Shaw.|$|E
500|$|Although Monica and Rachel have {{remained}} best friends since high school, {{they are very}} much opposites. While both characters share similar economic backgrounds, they grew up on [...] "different ends {{of the high school}} social order," [...] with Rachel being a popular cheerleader and Monica [...] "deal with body and control issues due to being an overweight child and teen." [...] Sabienna Bowman of This Was TV observed that [...] "Monica’s struggles ultimately left her more confident than Rachel, as well as more prepared for adulthood." [...] Among her defining qualities, Monica has had a passion for cooking ever since childhood, stemming from when she received her first Easy-Bake Oven. A chef, the character has had several cooking-related jobs throughout the series, having worked at five different restaurants, a trend that nearly coincides with her constant rotation of boyfriends in an ongoing search for the [...] "perfect match". Michael Hogan of The Guardian believes that the character's [...] "competitive, perfectionist, obsessive-compulsive nature made her ideally suited to a career as a chef." [...] However, her love of cooking and food is also responsible for her having been extremely overweight as a child, throughout high school and college. The running gag of an overweight Monica is often used as a recurring backstory for the character throughout the series, first explored in the second-season episode [...] "The One With the Prom Video" [...] via flashback. One of the character's childhood nicknames was [...] "Big Fat Goalie" [...] when she played field hockey. While overweight, Monica is depicted as having very low self-esteem, binge eating often, and constantly seeking attention. While in college, Monica is embarrassed into losing weight permanently after overhearing her then-crush Chandler make fun of her appearance. Media and the Rhetoric of Body Perfection: Cosmetic Surgery, Weight Loss and Beauty in Popular Culture author Dr. Deborah Harris-Moore believes that Monica's tendency to come off as <b>a</b> <b>control</b> <b>freak</b> originates from her childhood struggles with weight gain, explaining that the character ate excessively in order [...] "to cope with her emotions." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bitch, {{literally}} {{meaning a}} female dog, is a slang [...] for a person, commonly a woman, who is belligerent, unreasonable, malicious, <b>a</b> <b>control</b> <b>freak,</b> rudely intrusive or aggressive. When {{applied to a}} man, bitch is a derogatory term for a subordinate. Its original use as a vulgarism, documented to the fifteenth century, suggested high sexual desire in a woman, comparable to a dog in heat. The range of meanings has expanded in modern usage. In a feminist context, it can indicate a strong or assertive woman.|$|E
50|$|In the {{corporate}} world, <b>control</b> <b>freaks</b> tend to publicly admonish their inferiors, especially during meetings. More positively, the term can also refer to {{someone with a}} limited number of things that they want done a specific way; professor of clinical psychology Les Parrott wrote that “Control Freaks are people who care more than you do about something and won't stop at being pushy to get their way”. There may be a fine line between being a detail-oriented manager, who likes to have things done 'right', and being <b>a</b> (destructive) <b>control</b> <b>freak.</b> <b>Control</b> <b>freaks</b> are usually <b>a</b> cause of micromanagement.|$|R

2500|$|Chytilová {{described}} {{herself as}} <b>a</b> <b>control</b> <b>freak</b> and, “An overheated kettle that you can’t turn down”. [...] Chytilová’s ‘overheated’ attitude created difficulties {{for her to}} gain work within the Soviet Union controlled film industry. She was known as being actively critical of the Soviet Union, stating that “My critique is {{in the context of}} the moral principles you preach, isn’t it? A critical reflection is necessary”. [...] She would routinely cause havoc and ‘hysterical scenes’ in order to attempt to make films that were loyal to her vision regardless of the heavy censorship that was routinely imposed.|$|E
