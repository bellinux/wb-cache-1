5|$|Caesar {{defeated}} large armies {{at major}} battles 58 and 57 BC. In 55 and 54 BC he made two expeditions into Britain, the first Roman to do so.

Gaul never regained its Celtic identity, never attempted another rebellion, <b>and,</b> <b>except</b> <b>for</b> the Crisis of the Third Century, remained loyal to Rome until {{the fall of the}} empire in 476.|$|E
5|$|Intent on {{restoring}} {{the supremacy of}} Saladin's direct descendants within the Ayyubid family, an-Nasir Yusuf was eventually able to enlist the backing {{of all of the}} Syria-based Ayyubid emirs in a common cause against Mamluk-dominated Egypt. By 1250, he took Damascus with relative ease <b>and</b> <b>except</b> <b>for</b> Hama and Transjordan, an-Nasir Yusuf's direct authority stood unbroken from the Khabur River in northern Mesopotamia to the Sinai Peninsula. In December 1250, he attacked Egypt after hearing of al-Mu'azzam Turan-Shah's death and the ascension of Shajar al-Durr. An-Nasir Yusuf's army was much larger and better-equipped than that of the Egyptian army, consisting of the forces of Aleppo, Homs, Hama, and those of Saladin's only surviving sons, Nusrat ad-Din and Turan-Shah ibn Salah ad-Din. Nonetheless, it suffered a major defeat at the hands of Aybak's forces. An-Nasir Yusuf subsequently returned to Syria, which was slowly slipping out of his control.|$|E
5|$|This tit-tyrant defends its {{territory}} only against other tit-tyrants <b>and,</b> <b>except</b> <b>for</b> the southernmost population, is non-migratory. The tufted tit-tyrant feeds mainly {{on a variety}} of insects that it hunts on or from small shrubs, typically by perch gleaning. It normally hunts in pairs. The breeding season varies for this bird depending on its geographical location. Two to three eggs are normally laid twice a year in a cup-shaped nest made of root fibers, grasses, and lichens and lined with small feathers. The tufted tit-tyrant is listed as a species of least concern due to its large range and population.|$|E

He settled in Canton, Ohio; after practicing law there, he was elected to Congress in 1876, <b>and</b> <b>except</b> <b>for</b> short periods served there until 1891. In 1890 he was defeated for re-election, but he was elected governor the following year, serving two two-year terms.|$|E
5|$|The Inquirers {{circulation}} {{has been}} dropping since the 1980s, <b>and</b> <b>except</b> <b>for</b> briefly seeing {{a rise in}} weekday circulation in 2007, The Philadelphia Inquirers weekday and Sunday circulation has continued to steadily drop since Philadelphia Media Holdings bought the paper. Loss of circulation combined with an unexpected drop in advertising revenue have forced more than 400 job cuts at The Inquirer and Daily News since they were bought by Philadelphia Media Holdings. As Philadelphia Media Holdings financial situation worsened in 2008 employees began complaining about how management has been monitoring things such as bathroom breaks and the coffee they drink, and that Tierney has been patrolling the parking garage seeing what time employees arrive for work. Despite efforts to manage the financial strain, on February 21, 2009, Philadelphia Newspapers LLC, the subsidiary of Philadelphia Media Holdings that owns the paper, filled for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The company hoped to restructure the US$390 million in debt it borrowed to buy the newspapers, but the end result was that the papers were auctioned off to the company's lenders. The beginning of 2009 also saw the filing of a lawsuit that accused The Philadelphia Inquirer of writing critical stories about Chester Community Charter School's use of public funds after business negotiations between school operator Vahan H. Gureghian and Tierney failed.|$|E
5|$|This support {{did indeed}} soon develop, when {{individuals}} or whole companies of men from across Western Europe {{volunteered for the}} Republic's army, while Christian rulers also felt obliged to provide men, supplies and ships. The first French contingent of 4,200 men under Prince Almerigo d'Este arrived in April 1660, along with further contingents of German mercenaries, troops from Savoy, and Maltese, Tuscan and French ships. Despite this increase in strength, Morosini's operations in 1660 were a failure: an assault on Canea in August succeeded in taking the outlying fortifications but failed to retake the city itself; similarly, an attack against the Ottoman siege lines at Candia in September achieved some success, but did not break the Ottoman siege. Following the death of Prince d'Este at Naxos shortly after, the French contingent returned home, followed soon after by a disheartened Morosini, who was succeeded by his kinsman Giorgio. In 1661, Giorgio Morosini scored a few minor successes: he broke an Ottoman blockade of Tinos, and, pursuing the Ottoman fleet, defeated it off Milos. The next few years however were relatively idle. Although the Ottomans were heavily engaged with the Austrians in Hungary, and that their fleet rarely sallied forth, the Venetians failed {{to make use of}} this opportunity, <b>and,</b> <b>except</b> <b>for</b> the intercept of a supply convoy from Alexandria off Kos in 1662, there was little action.|$|E
