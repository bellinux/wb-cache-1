40|$|Aims: Investigate {{the number}} and type of tasks performed, delayed or not {{completed}} by regulated and unregulated (assistant) nurses. Background: <b>Assistants</b> <b>in</b> Nursing change the work environment of the nurses with whom they work. As the number of <b>Assistants</b> <b>in</b> Nursing working on acute units grows, {{it is important to}} understand how their presence influences nursing care. Design: Descriptive analysis of survey data from 62 acute nursing units across three Australian states between 2008 – 2010. Methods: All staff providing nursing care to patients were asked to complete a survey that included demographics, the number of tasks delayed/incomplete and the completion of six specific tasks. Nonparametric tests compared <b>Assistants</b> <b>in</b> Nursing (n = 25) to regulated nurses (n = 1630), and regulated nurses on units with no <b>Assistants</b> <b>in</b> Nursing (n = 1356) to those on units with up to 5 % assistants (n = 76) and over 5 % assistants (n = 198). Results: More regulated nurses on units with zero, or up to 5 % <b>Assistants</b> <b>in</b> Nursing, completed tasks usually associated with assistants’ scope of practice, relative to those on units with over 5 % <b>Assistants</b> <b>in</b> Nursing. Statistically significant differences were found between the units in delays responding to the patient bell and in the planning of nursing care. Conclusion: This study suggests that <b>Assistants</b> <b>in</b> Nursing have an impact on the nature and timeliness of care provided in acute hospital units, that is relative to the proportion of staffing they comprise, to the effectiveness of integration and to the clarity of their scope of practice and associated delegation. Relevance to clinical practice: With increasing employment of <b>Assistants</b> <b>in</b> Nursing in acute hospital settings comes the requirement to optimise their use. This needs to include a well-articulated scope of practice, clear delegation of tasks and effective integration with the rest of the care team...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The study {{addressed}} {{one central}} aim. This {{was to explore}} the experience of <b>Assistants</b> <b>in</b> Nursing being exposed to Dementia Care Mapping coupled with reflection to improve older residents care in a residential aged care facility. Design and Setting: A qualitative exploratory design was employed to gain an in depth understanding of <b>Assistants</b> <b>in</b> Nursing experience of creating new care for older residents using Dementia Care Mapping and feedback. The {{study was conducted in}} a dementia specific nursing home, located in urban Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Subjects: The study participants were ten <b>Assistants</b> <b>in</b> Nursing and five older residents diagnosed with mild to moderate dementia by a Physician. Results: For the first time, the study illuminated the <b>Assistants</b> <b>in</b> Nursing innovative care following Dementia Care Mapping feedback and reflection. Their experience was highlighted in three major themes: (i) Reflecting on Care (ii) Creating a Caring Connection and (iii) Empathetic Communication. Conclusion: These <b>Assistants</b> <b>in</b> Nursing valued and used findings from Dementia Care Mapping feedback coupled with reflection to improve contemporary practice. In addition, they felt empowered to create new nursing strategies for quality care. The study highlighted the usefulness of providing <b>Assistants</b> <b>in</b> Nursing with these types of educational strategies to encourage the development of creative caring for residents with dementia living in a residential aged care facility.

5|$|Carte {{was married}} twice. His first wife was Blanche Julia Prowse (1853–1885), the {{daughter}} of William Prowse, a piano manufacturer, music publisher and booking agent. As a teenager, she had participated in amateur theatricals with Carte. They married in 1870 and had two sons, Lucas (1872–1907) and Rupert. Blanche died of pneumonia in 1885, and in 1888, Carte married his assistant, Helen. Their wedding {{took place in the}} Savoy Chapel, with Arthur Sullivan as the best man. Rupert received training in an accounting firm and then became his father's <b>assistant</b> <b>in</b> 1894. Lucas, who was not involved in the family businesses, became a barrister.

5|$|Harvard had so {{much trouble}} finding a {{replacement}} for Gray that they considered hiring a European, but they found an American and hired George Lincoln Goodale in late 1872.

William Gilson Farlow also had a medical degree from Harvard and had studied botany. He became Gray's <b>assistant</b> <b>in</b> 1870 after obtaining his medical degree and then studied in Europe for a few years. He returned to Harvard in 1874 and became a botany professor. Sereno Watson began helping Gray with taxonomy in 1872 and became the herbarium curator. The reorganization of botany at Harvard in the early 1870s was a major accomplishment of Gray's.|$|E
