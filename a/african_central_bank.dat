40|$|<b>African</b> <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> {{have covered}} an {{extraordinary}} distance {{since the early}} 1990 s—closing the gap, in the process, between their own policy challenges and those of richer-country <b>central</b> <b>banks.</b> Some striking differences are nonetheless easily missed, amid the many parallels between <b>central</b> <b>banking</b> reforms in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) {{and those in the}} industrial and emerging-market economies. The abandonment of soft pegs in low-income SSA, for example, had less to do with capital mobility than with the failures of exchange control systems under pressure from fiscal imbalances and external shocks. Fiscal and quasi-fiscal demands, in turn, have almost certainly been more important than conventional stabilisation objectives as potential sources of inflation bias in SSA. Money-based disinflation programmes, to take a final example—often supported by tight fiscal rules under IMF conditionality—do not appear to have involved costly sacrifices of output, outside of South Africa.   These observations, and more in the papers collected here, suggest that the distinctive structural and institutional features of low-income countries may have distinctive implications for the design and conduct of monetary policy. Collectively, the papers in this volume issue a compelling call for monetary policy research that focuses squarely on the economic environment of low-income Africa.

40|$|During the 1990 s {{a number}} of <b>African</b> <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> succeeded in {{bringing}} inflation to relatively low levels while maintaining a market-determined exchange rate. These <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> were generally reluctant to fully subordinate exchange rate targets to monetary targets, however, particularly {{in the face of}} large external shocks. We focus on the management of highly persistent shocks to aid flows, including PRSP-related increases in net flows, in the presence of currency substitution by the domestic private sector. Such shocks have beneficent long-run effects, but when currency substitution is high they can produce dramatic macroeconomic management problems in the short run. What is the appropriate mix of money and exchange rate targeting in such cases, and the role of temporary sterilization? We analyze these and related issues in an intertemporal optimizing model that allows a portion of aid to be devoted to reducing the government's seigniorage requirement. This creates a strong link between official aid flows and private capital flows, giving rise to tradeoffs reminiscent of the literature on private capital inflows in emerging markets. When the credibility of policymakers' commitment to low inflation is firm, some degree of dirty floating, with little or no sterilization of increases in the monetary base, is the most attractive approach. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{relative}} positive {{economic growth}} experienced by most African {{countries in the}} recent decade has come with insufficient demand stimulation. The concern of poverty {{at the forefront of}} economic policy, the need for inclusive growth and sustainable development, inter alia, brings forward the inevitable question of the monetary policy responsibility. Accordingly, the monetarist theory that focuses on price stability inherently neglects the demand stimulation aspect of economic prosperity. Since the mid 1980 s, the monetarist school driven by its central aim of fighting inflation and maintaining credibility in markets and economic agents has been priority for monetary authorities (especially in Africa). To this effect, while good results in terms of inflation targeting has been achieved in many African countries; economic growth has sometimes been low. Hence, in light of the above, using a statistical and theoretical debate method, the Credible Monetary Policy (CMP) i paradox is traceable to Africa. Accordingly, with the promising economic environment in Africa, we recommend the promotion of a monetary policy oriented toward improving economic growth under the constraint of price stability. In light of the above view, there are some note worthy signs such the recent decision by the two CFA zone <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> to either maintain interest rates at a low level or reduce it despite tightening measures of monetary policy taken by the European <b>Central</b> <b>Bank</b> (ECB) earlier in the year. In the same vein, the <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> of South Africa has maintained its policy of low interest rates with an objective of economic expansion. Since, the 2008 financial crisis, the consolidation of the Federal Reserve’s declared final objective of lowering interest rates and making emergency loans is an eloquent example to reassure <b>African</b> <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> in the choice of the pro-growth monetary policy option. ...|$|R

40|$|From the introduction]. The African Union, {{which came}} into {{existence}} in 2002, seems in some ways to be {{a copy of the}} European Union. First of all, there is the obvious use of “Union” in the name. Secondly, the institutions of the African Union parallel those of the European Union. Specifically, the African Union has a Pan-African Parliament, an executive African Commission, an African Court of Justice, an Executive Council (to match the European Union’s Council of Ministers), and — at the apex — the Assembly of the African Union, grouping its political leaders and meeting at summits (as per the European Council). Third and finally, the future plans of the African Union include other parallels, in particular an <b>African</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Bank.</b> Yet the African Union as an historical-political expression differs in three key ways from the European Union: it united almost all of (independent) Africa from its roots in the Organization of African Unity, it has a clear, geographical sense of where is Africa, and it lacks democratic cohesion, the occasional suspension of a member notwithstanding. These three points will be outlined briefly in turn, in each case contrasting them with the European Union.

40|$|The {{launch of}} the euro has fed doubts {{concerning}} the constitution of an optimal European monetary zone. Indeed, the differences in legal, institutional and cultural frameworks… {{as well as the}} diversity of the productive and financial European systems may have led to the idea that Europe does not constitute a viable monetary zone.

In this preliminary work, we have tried to evaluate implicitly the pertinence of such decision by showing in a first section the heterogeneity of Maghrebian monetary regimes. We have tried to illustrate in a second section this heterogeneity via a model describing the functioning of the economy of these countries. Finally, we have attempted to show in a third section the consequences of these heterogeneities by simulating optimal monetary rules defined for each country. Our results suggest that these countries will need divergent Taylor rules and that the decision to belong to the same monetary union where a common monetary policy will be conducted proved to be unsuitable. ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to measure the long and short term {{dynamics}} of trade with South Africa, impact of Common Monetary Area (CMA) on the Namibian beef price. More specifically, it examines the relationship between monetary change by South <b>African</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Bank</b> Governor (i. e. taking exchange rate and interest rate as explanatory variables) and the beef industry a case study to the Namibian economy. The Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) was applied by using beef price a dependent variable, with a mentioned set of explanatory variables. As the study hypothesized the study has found a significant linkage between monetary shock occurred in South Africa simultaneously affect the beef industry (or the Namibian agriculture sector in general), and also bears the burden of adjustment in the economy, that could increases farmers financial vulnerability. The dynamic relationships of trading between Namibia and South Africa, more specifically the volatile nature of rand and interest rate have influenced consumers to absorb short-run price change. This change could be substantially affecting the poor households. The result has found that Namibian consumers have to absorb the short run price overshooting, which in turn impacts on the ability to manage their cash flow. For example, the result finding shows one percent change in South Africa money supply or appreciation (depreciation) of rand leads to double change in beef price in Namibia. Due to the linkages between monetary policy variables and relative agricultural prices, it is recommended that agricultural policy makers and monetary authorities in CMA need to work closely in designing and implementing monetary policy. This is important because monetary policies meant to stabilize the economy may have less desirable impacts on farmers and consumers, especially in the short run. leader, professional environment, evolution process, evolution climate, approaching pattern. ...|$|E
