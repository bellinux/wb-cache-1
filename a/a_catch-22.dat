25|$|The Scottish Maritime Museum {{found itself}} in <b>a</b> <b>Catch-22</b> position: the punitive charges arising from their failure to vacate the slipway were now {{sufficient}} to bankrupt the museum, {{but they did not}} have sufficient funds to scientifically deconstruct the vessel. Had the museum gone into administration its nationally significant collection would have been dispersed. The alternative for the Scottish Government was to fund either the deconstruction of City of Adelaide, or her removal from Scotland. A conference was held in December 2009 at which the main stakeholders discussed the possible options for saving the ship.|$|E
25|$|One of Raj's biggest {{personality}} quirks is his {{tendency to}} speak or act inappropriately, often landing him in trouble or {{leading to an}} angry reaction from whomever he has upset. This was particularly pronounced when he was {{under the influence of}} alcohol, which could cause <b>a</b> <b>catch-22,</b> since for years he needed alcohol to even speak to a woman, but the alcohol led to him say the wrong things. On one occasion, just as Leonard and Penny are about to have sex in their hotel room, Raj enters and obliviously proceeds to climb into Sheldon's recently vacated bed, completely unaware of what he has interrupted. On another occasion, he openly discussed having had crushes on Penny and Bernadette directly in front of them, which caused both discomfort, and unwittingly hurting Amy's feelings when he admits that he never had a crush on her as well (despite Penny and Bernadette's best efforts to alert him to this fact).|$|E
25|$|Homeless {{people often}} find it {{difficult}} to document their date of birth or their address. Because homeless people usually have no place to store possessions, they often lose their belongings, including their identification and other documents, or find them destroyed by police or others. Without a photo ID, homeless persons cannot get a job or access many social services, including health care and clinic access. They can be denied access to even the most basic assistance: clothing closets, food pantries, certain public benefits, and in some cases, emergency shelters. Obtaining replacement identification is difficult. Without an address, birth certificates cannot be mailed. Fees may be cost-prohibitive for impoverished persons. And some states will not issue birth certificates unless the person has photo identification, creating <b>a</b> <b>Catch-22.</b> This problem is far less acute in countries which provide free-at-use health care, such as the UK, where hospitals are open-access day and night and make no charges for treatment. In the US, free-care clinics, for homeless and other people, do exist in major cities, but they often attract more demand than they can meet.|$|E

500|$|Mike Adams, the {{producer}} of Murder on the Orient Express, was extremely determined to have David Suchet as the voice actor for Poirot, a major character in the game. Nixon thought that Suchet had become so intertwined with the character of Poirot, after his success with the television series Agatha Christie's Poirot, {{that it would be}} hard to imagine someone else doing Poirot's voice without constantly being compared to Suchet. Nixon described the situation as <b>a</b> <b>catch-22,</b> saying that he [...] "worried about someone coming in and doing a Suchet impression instead of a unique rendition of Poirot, yet the more the voice strays from Suchet's version, the more people will wish it was Suchet doing it!" [...] Another reason for the development team's determination to have Suchet aboard was that they thought he would spur the other voice actors in the game, such as Vanessa Marshall who portrayed Antoinette Marceau, to step up and compete with Suchet's skillful portrayal of Poirot. Fairly late in the game's development, Suchet agreed to do the voice acting. He admitted that one reason for his acceptance of the offer was that he felt possessive of the role of Poirot, considering he had been portraying the character for so long. Adams expressed pride at having succeeded in convincing Suchet to do voice acting for Murder on the Orient Express, and said that his skillful voice acting would bring [...] "tremendous excitement and authenticity" [...] to the game.|$|E
2500|$|Strictly speaking, a [...] "Catch-22" [...] is [...] "a {{problematic}} {{situation for}} which the only solution is denied by a circumstance inherent in the problem or by a rule." [...] For example, losing something is typically a conventional problem; to solve it, one looks for the lost item until one finds it. But if the thing lost is one's glasses, one can't see {{to look for them}} - <b>a</b> <b>Catch-22.</b> The term [...] "Catch-22" [...] is also used more broadly to mean a tricky problem or a no-win or absurd situation.|$|E
2500|$|Much of Heller's prose in Catch-22 is {{circular}} and repetitive, exemplifying in {{its form}} {{the structure of}} <b>a</b> <b>Catch-22.</b> Circular reasoning is widely used by some characters to justify their actions and opinions. Heller revels in paradox, for example: [...] "The Texan {{turned out to be}} good-natured, generous and likable. In three days no one could stand him", and [...] "The case against Clevinger was open and shut. The only thing missing was something to charge him with." [...] This atmosphere of apparently logical irrationality pervades the book.|$|E

[...] Richardson felt that there was <b>a</b> <b>Catch-22</b> situation in that there was nobody who commanded Diệm's respect yet Diệm's continual hold on power would ensure disaster.

2500|$|The United Kingdom {{government}} {{has declined to}} sign Protocol 12 {{on the basis that}} they believe the wording of protocol is too wide and would result in a flood of new cases testing the extent of the new provision. They believe that the phrase [...] "rights set forth by law" [...] might include international conventions to which the UK is not a party, and would result in incorporation of these instruments by stealth. It has been suggested that the protocol is therefore in <b>a</b> <b>catch-22,</b> since the UK will decline to either sign or ratify the protocol until the European Court of Human Rights has addressed the meaning of the provision, while the court is hindered in doing so by the lack of applications to the court concerning the protocol caused by the decisions of Europe's most populous states—including the UK—not to ratify the protocol. The UK government, nevertheless, [...] "agrees in principle that the ECHR should contain a provision against discrimination that is free-standing and not parasitic on the other Convention rights". The first judgment that found a violation of Protocol No. 12, Sejdić and Finci v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, was delivered in 2009.|$|E

50|$|With the world's largest coastline, Canada built a large {{network of}} lighthouses and {{developed}} a unique Canadian style of lighthouses following Confederation in 1867. Advances in navigational technology have lessened the critical navigational role of lighthouses {{while at the same}} time their cultural role and potential for tourism development has grown. Lighthouse groups seeking to preserve lighthouses soon found that in Canada, the landmark buildings fell into <b>a</b> heritage <b>Catch-22.</b> <b>As</b> federal buildings, they are exempt from municipal or provincial laws, but they are not protected by any federal heritage laws. Lighthouses are instead merely subject to a property management program called the Federal Heritage Building Review Office (FHBRO). A survey of lighthouses across Canada in 1998 by the Nova Scotia Lighthouse Preservation Society showed that fewer than 4 per cent of Canadian lighthouses have been protected from demolition under FHBRO, while in the United States, 70 percent of lighthouses over 50 years old have heritage protection by the National Register of Historic Places. The FHBRO process has also been criticized for lack of public consultation with most communities having no idea when local lighthouses were evaluated and for the fact that when lighthouses are sold privately or transferred to other levels of government, even the minimal FHBRO protection evaporates.|$|R

5000|$|A special {{appearance}} {{is a term}} used in the American law of civil procedure to describe a civil defendant's appearance {{in the court of}} another state solely to dispute the personal jurisdiction of the court over that defendant. Prior to the advent of this procedure, defendants had to either appear in the other state's court to defend the case on the merits, or not show up in court at all, and then mount a collateral attack on any judgment rendered against them, when the plaintiff came to the defendant's state to collect on the judgment. In <b>a</b> legal <b>catch-22,</b> if the defendant appeared solely to contest jurisdiction, the court would then be permitted to assert jurisdiction based on the defendant's presence.|$|R

"y this view, {{the state}} [...] trapped in <b>a</b> veritable <b>catch-22,</b> wherein the very attempt to {{purchase}} political stability in fact serves only {{to open the}} door to increased instability," [...] Gengler wrote. The Khawalid brothers have allegedly undertaken preemptive measures to limit the Shia majority influence via excluding them from sensitive positions (sovereign ministries, police and army), naturalizing Sunnis to re-balance the demographics, gerrymandering electoral districts and mobilizing the Sunni public opinion against the Shia. The first evidence of these policies was presented by al-Jamri in 1998, later in 2006 they were further exposed by Al Bandar report.
