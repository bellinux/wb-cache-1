5|$|Most {{cases of}} plantar {{fasciitis}} resolve {{with time and}} conservative methods of treatment. Usually {{for the first few}} weeks people are advised to rest, change their activities, take pain medications, <b>and</b> <b>stretch.</b> If this is not sufficient physiotherapy, orthotics, splinting, or steroid injections may be options. If other measures do not work extracorporeal shockwave therapy or surgery may be tried.|$|E
5|$|Physics play an {{important}} role in New Super Mario Bros.s improved game mechanics. Without the rigid restrictions of tile-based sprites and backgrounds, the designers were free to explore new gameplay mechanics; when Mario lands on top of a tree, it teeters over and eventually falls if he is stationary for too long. Mario can also swing on ropes and walk on wires that bend <b>and</b> <b>stretch</b> under his weight.|$|E

Massage;static <b>stretching</b> <b>and</b> combination of massage <b>and</b> <b>stretching</b> were performed on lower limbs inmethods for 15 min. Each test was performed three times and the best record was accepted. Inorder to effect any of the protocols and correlated t-test to compare the effects of the ANOVAand Toky test at p< 0. 05 level was used. Results showed the records of flexibility and power(except massage) tests have significantly increased after massage; static stretching andcombination of massage <b>and</b> <b>stretching</b> (p< 0. 05). But; observed no significant changes in agility(except combination of massage <b>and</b> <b>stretching)</b> test records. In general; Athletes can use acutemassage; static <b>stretching</b> <b>and</b> combination of massage <b>and</b> <b>stretching</b> protocol beforecompetition or maximal flexibility-required and power exercise to obtain more benefit fromincreased flexibility and reduced risk of muscle injuries...|$|R

Subsequently, appearing in gay pornography as a twink bottom for production companies like Eurocreme and UK Naked Men, he starred in such films as Drunk on Spunk <b>and</b> <b>Stretch</b> that Hole, winning numerous awards for his work. By the time he made Uncle David, he was also running his own weekly gay wrestling night in London.|$|E

Other populous language families are the Dravidian languages of South Asia (among them Kannada Tamil and Telugu), the Turkic languages of Central Asia (such as Turkish), the Austroasiatic (among them Khmer), and Tai–Kadai languages of Southeast Asia (including Thai).|$|E
5|$|The {{need for}} combat {{aircraft}} {{had been a}} problem for ONUC. The UN had been delaying the commencement of the operation until sufficient air strength had been amassed to conduct a single attack that could destroy the Katangese Air Force. They feared that a limited attack would fail to eliminate all Katangese aircraft <b>and</b> <b>stretch</b> their own forces thin, thereby allowing Katanga to disperse its air forces among hidden airfields and launch retaliatory attacks on Kamina Air Base. India had withdrawn its Canberra bombers in October to guard against China, and Ethiopia repatriated its force of Sabres after one was lost in an accident. However, new air surveillance radar equipment was deployed in Kamina and Élisabethville. The ONUC Air Division was bolstered in November by the delivery of two Saab 29 Tunnan (J-29) reconnaissance-variant jets from Sweden, greatly enhancing the force's intelligence capabilities. This was followed shortly thereafter by the arrival of several J-29 combat aircraft and a 380-strong anti-aircraft unit from Norway. In all, the UN would field 10 combat J-29s in the operation.|$|E

5|$|When {{the crew}} awaken, they find {{themselves}} out of the control beds {{with no sign of}} the Gangers. However, their own personal belongings have been gone through and the TARDIS has sunk into acid-corroded ground. The Doctor explains that they have likely been unconscious {{for more than an hour}} and the Gangers have gained sentience. They soon discover that two of the Gangers are amongst them, posing as Cleaves and Jennifer (Sarah Smart), when the two give themselves away by turning pale-white. Jennifer also exhibits the ability to contort <b>and</b> <b>stretch</b> her body well beyond human limits. The Jennifer Ganger struggles with her new identity and befriends Rory who has begun to demonstrate an emotional attachment to her. The Cleaves Ganger works in secret with the other Gangers to try to kill the real humans, as the human Cleaves plans to kill the Gangers. The Doctor attempts to reunite the two sides but fails when the human Cleaves kills one of the Gangers with a high-powered electrical charge. The Gangers plan an attack, and the Doctor accuses Cleaves of killing a living being which Cleaves refuses to acknowledge. The Ganger Jennifer hunts her human counterpart to kill her. The Doctor determines that in a monastery, the safest place to be is the chapel, and directs everyone there. The Gangers, in acid-protection suits, bear down on the chapel. Rory responds to the sound of Jennifer screaming by deliberately separating from the group, against Amy's wishes. In the chapel, Amy and the Doctor discover a Ganger version of the Doctor.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, baroreceptors are stretch receptors {{located in}} the aortic sinus, carotid bodies, the venae cavae, and other locations, {{including}} pulmonary vessels and {{the right side of}} the heart itself. Rates of firing from the baroreceptors represent blood pressure, level of physical activity, and the relative distribution of blood. The cardiac centers monitor baroreceptor firing to maintain cardiac homeostasis, a mechanism called the baroreceptor reflex. With increased pressure <b>and</b> <b>stretch,</b> the rate of baroreceptor firing increases, and the cardiac centers decrease sympathetic stimulation and increase parasympathetic stimulation. As pressure <b>and</b> <b>stretch</b> decrease, the rate of baroreceptor firing decreases, and the cardiac centers increase sympathetic stimulation and decrease parasympathetic stimulation.|$|E

25|$|VLDPE {{is defined}} by a density range of 0.880–0.915nbsp&g/cm3.

VLDPE is most commonly produced using metallocene catalysts due to the greater co-monomer incorporation exhibited by these catalysts.
