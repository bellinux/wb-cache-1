5|$|Schmerber v.

5|$|Statutory {{conspiracy}} {{consists of}} an agreement between two or more people to commit <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> offence, under section 5(1) and (2) of the 1977 Act. For statutory conspiracies, there must be three elements: an agreement, to pursue a course of conduct which involves the commission of a crime, where {{the parties to the}} agreement intended to commit the crime. Even if the parties later decide not to go through with the plan, since the actus reus is to reach an agreement, they can still be charged. There are certain categories of agreement which cannot amount to <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> conspiracy, however; an agreement between a husband and wife is not a conspiracy, under section 2(2)(a) of the 1977 Act, and neither is an agreement with a person under the age of criminal responsibility, or with the intended victim of the crime.|$|E

Burton testified that he received notice of his appointment from Harlan on November 20, 1902, {{and that he had}} only contacted the Post Office to notify them of his intent to defend Dennis in <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> case. He explained that he only asked to be notified of complaints against Rialto so that he could terminate his association with them should any arise.|$|E
