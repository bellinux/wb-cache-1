2500|$|According to Sunnis, Fadak was a {{piece of}} land, near Khaiber, where Jews lived. Fadak was conquered by Muhammad. The Qur'an says: “And that which Allah gave as spoil unto His {{messenger}} from them, ye urged not any horse or riding-camel for the sake thereof, but Allah giveth His messenger lordship over whom He will. Allah is Able to do all things. That which Allah giveth as spoil unto His messenger from the people of the townships, it is for Allah and His messenger and for the near of kin and the orphans and the needy and the wayfarer, that it become not a commodity between the rich among you. And whatsoever the messenger giveth you, take it. And whatsoever he forbiddeth, abstain (from it). <b>And</b> <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> duty to Allah. Lo! Allah is stern in reprisal. [...] -(59: 6-7). Thus according to the Qur’an, Fai means such of properties of the unbelievers as are returned to the Muslims without war. It is not to be distributed like booty among the soldiers, but the whole of it is for Allah and His apostle. From the Sunnah and Practice of the Prophet of Islam it is evident that Muhammad himself used to manage Fai {{as the head of the}} Islamic republic.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the fifth}} ODI game, England batsman Jos Buttler was {{controversially}} run out backing-up at the non-striker's end by Sri Lankan bowler Sachithra Senanayake, a dismissal called Mankading. Senanayake had warned Buttler twice {{before in the}} same game about moving out of his crease, before he removed his bails and appealed to umpire Michael Gough. Speaking after the game, Sri Lankan captain Angelo Mathews defended the decision by saying [...] "what we did was completely within the rules." [...] England coach Peter Moores said he was [...] "disappointed" [...] in Mathew's decision. Former England captain Michael Vaughan said it was [...] "no way to play the game", but another former captain, Michael Atherton, defended the decision saying [...] "You {{see a lot of}} batsmen wandering aimlessly out of their ground. It's a good lesson for him - don't be dozy <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> bat in your crease". [...] Australian captain Michael Clarke said that [...] "I think as long as the player's warned, it's in the rules so you can make whatever decision you want". Buttler's dismissal by Senanayake was the first instance of Mankading in international cricket since Peter Kirsten's innings was ended by Kapil Dev during an ODI between South Africa and India in 1992.|$|E

Sheppard agreed to tour and [...] "the presence in the pulpit of David Sheppard...filled the Anglican cathedral of every state capital from Perth to Brisbane" [...] Sheppard made 0 and 113 in the victorious Second Test at Melbourne, but dropped two catches and was dropped himself when he was on a pair in the second innings. He ran out his captain Ted Dexter, took a risky single for the winning run and was run out by Bill Lawry so that Ken Barrington had to come out to see Colin Cowdrey make the winning single. Although he held some good catches on the tour [...] "the ones I dropped were at such vital moments", Richie Benaud and Bill Lawry in the Second Test and Neil Harvey in the Fourth Test off Trueman, who told him [...] "The only time your hands are together are on Sunday". This is a story that increased with the telling, another version being [...] "Pretend it's Sunday Reverend, <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> hands together", or that it was Sheppard who said [...] "Sorry Fred, I should have kept my hands together". One couple in Australia asked Mrs Sheppard if the Reverend could christen their baby, but she advised them not to as he was bound to drop it.|$|E
2500|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} the words of [...] "The Lord tries the righteous; but the wicked and him who loves {{violence}} His soul hates," [...] bear on God's instruction in [...] "Take the Levites." [...] The Midrash taught {{that the words}} of [...] "The Lord tries the righteous," [...] imply that God never raises a person to high rank before first testing and trying that person. If the person stands the trial, God raises the person to high rank. The Midrash found this {{to have been the}} case with Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph, and so also with the tribe of Levi. The Midrash taught that the Levites devoted their lives to the sanctification of God's Name. When the Israelites were in Egypt, the Israelites rejected the Torah and circumcision, as implied by Ezekiel's rebuke of them in [...] "Thus says the Lord God: 'In the day when I chose Israel, and lifted up my hand to the seed of the house of Jacob, and made Myself known to them in the land of Egypt'"; and afterwards, [...] says, [...] "They rebelled against Me, and would not hearken to Me [...] [...] [...] then I said I would pour out My fury upon them." [...] So God brought darkness upon the Egyptians for three days, and during that time God slew all the wicked Israelites, as [...] reports, [...] "I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against Me." [...] The Levites, however, were all righteous and practiced the Torah; as [...] says, [...] "For they have observed Your word, <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>Your</b> covenant." [...] The Midrash taught that [...] "covenant" [...] referred to circumcision, as [...] says, [...] "This is My covenant [...] [...] [...] every male among you shall be circumcised." [...] And the Midrash taught that when the Israelites made the Golden Calf, the Levites did not participate, as [...] says: [...] "Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp [...] [...] [...] and all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together to him." [...] When Moses told them in [...] "Put every man his sword upon his thigh," [...] they did so and respected no persons. Moses accordingly blessed them in [...] saying, [...] "Who said of his father, and of his mother: 'I have not seen him.'" [...] When God thus saw that the Levites were all righteous, and that they stood the test, as [...] says, [...] "Whom You did prove at Massah," [...] God decided, as reported in [...] "The Levites shall be mine." ...|$|E

2500|$|Australia's first wicket cost England dearly. After 32 dull minutes Bill Lawry edged {{a chance}} off Len Coldwell (1/41) which John Murray took {{just off the}} grass in a dive that tore his {{shoulder}} ligaments. Lawry was out for 8, but Murray {{had to be taken}} off the field for medical treatment and Peter Parfitt took over behind the stumps (both he and Tom Graveney, who he replaced, were reserve wicket-keepers for their county). He did a reasonable job, but took no catches and few Test teams expect to do well in these circumstances. Norm O'Neill had failed in the number three spot so Neil Harvey came in and was missed in the slips by Cowdrey on 2 and lofted a gentle catch off Fred Trueman to David Sheppard at extra-cover on 37. Sheppard [...] "saw it all the way into my hands - and out of them. If ever I have wanted that secret trap-door and underground route to the pavilion it was then", Brian Statham shouted [...] "Bad luck", Trueman's comments are unprintable, but are usually translated as [...] "Pretend it's Sunday Reverend, <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> hands together", Harvey hit 64 runs out of 160 in 170 minutes with only two boundaries in what Johnny Moyes thought was the worse innings of his career. He was the first victim of the Cockney off-spinner Fred Titmus (7/79) who in eight overs dismissed Harvey, Bobby Simpson, Norm O'Neill and Brian Booth for 5 runs as Australia slumped from 174/1 to 212/5 {{by the end of the}} day. [...] "Most males in the Australian population knew how to hit Titmus out of the attack but the selectors kept filling the Australian XI with the minority who did not", his flighty off-spin down the leg-side shackling the batsmen. Harvey was bowled, Simpson was caught off a cut by Ken Barrington for his third Test 90 (and the sixteenth first-class 90 of the season), O'Neill was bowled when he started a drive and changed his mind and Booth prodded one to Trueman at short leg. Barry Jarman came in as a nightwatchman, but was run out for a duck first thing in the morning, overbalancing after pushing the ball to David Sheppard at forward short-leg, who threw down the stumps. Titmus continued his good work, Alan Davidson (15) was caught at short-leg hitting across the line, Richie Benaud (15) was caught and bowled and Garth McKenzie (4) was quickly lbw. Only Barry Shepherd (71 not out) hit out at the bowlers, with 8 fours and a towering six off Titmus, the last scoring stroke of the innings. Brian Statham (1/67) bowled Colin Guest in his only Test innings after a last-wicket stand of 39 and Australia were out for 319, a lead of 40 far behind what was expected or wanted. The wisdom in the press box thought Australia needed to be 150 runs ahead seeing as they would bat last.|$|E
