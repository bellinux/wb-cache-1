The method involves a simple parallel plate capacitor setup with the sample sandwiched between electrodes, a voltage potential applied to one electrode, and a measurement device {{applied to the}} back electrode measuring current. Previous methods involved use of <b>a</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> with a claimed low noise and high linearity, but with a low AC output ripple.

40|$|We have {{developed}} an uninterruptible <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> (UPS) systems suitable for permanent seismic stations, and have used it to replace commercial UPS systems at seismic stations belonging to the Daidaitoku seismic network. For use in seismic stations, the newly developed UPS system offers several advantages over the commercial UPS systems that are often used to protect personal computers from a sudden power failure. First, independent cut-off voltages can be set for two different output circuits, one for an ISDN router {{and the other for}} a seismometer and data logger. In addition, DC <b>power</b> can be <b>supplied</b> using a battery, and the efficiency is improved by about two times. Finally, the new UPS is more compact, which allows easier handling at stations. 　　When a battery with a capacity of 40 Ah is used, the newly developed UPS is designed to <b>supply</b> continuous electric <b>power</b> to equipment for seven days after <b>a</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>power</b> failure. To achieve this, the power to the ISDN router, which represents approximately 70 % of the total power, is automatically turned off about two days after the power failure occurs. The <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> to the data logger and seismometer is maintained until the battery voltage reaches a preset lower limit, in order to prevent deep discharge. If the <b>commercial</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> is restored at the station, all systems are restarted and the battery is automatically recharged. 　　After being installed in the Daidaitoku seismic network, the new UPS systems functioned without any problems. Therefore, the power system in seismic stations can be successfully upgraded in this manner. ＜論説...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{the past}} few years Silicon Photo-multiplier (SiPM) has emerged as a new {{detector}} in various applications due to its promising characteristics for low light detection. However SiPM has certain limitations out of which temperature dependence of gain is an important parameter which limits the application fields to temperature controlled or indoor environment. Change in temperature changes the breakdown voltage and hence the gain; therefore the biasing voltage needs to be trimmed according to temperature for maintaining the constant gain. This paper explores different <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> techniques that have been used for SiPM.

40|$|Characterization of the {{conductive}} current {{associated with}} XLPE, found in power cables requires HVDC <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> with very stable voltage output.

The generated capacitive current can be difficult to differentiate with the actual measurement of the conductive current. In order to achieve measurements of the conductive current, the influence of the generated capacitive current must be sufficiently lower than the conductive current. By designing a <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> with low ripple generation, the influence of the capacitive current can be diminished.
