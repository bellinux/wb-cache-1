5|$|In 2009, Superior Court Judge Jack Panella won a $770 bid on {{the auction}} website eBay to {{flip the switch}} <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Peace Candle during the candle-lighting {{ceremony}} on November 27, 2009. In November 2010, Easton Holiday Committee Chairwoman Sandy O'Brien-Werner voiced doubts that the current candle structure would last until 2014 as previously projected and might {{need to be replaced}} sooner. She expressed concern at the cost of such a venture, claiming the Peace Candle cost $14,640 in 2010 alone for maintenance and operation and that an altogether new structure would cost at least $35,000. In response, six-year-old MaryElizabeth Soffera and eight-year-old Katie Dietrich, two cousins from Williams Township who loved the Peace Candle, opened a snow cone stand during a garage sale {{to raise money for the}} candle. They raised $23, which they presented to Mayor Sal Panto Jr. during a November city council meeting.|$|E
5|$|Umbridge {{decides to}} use the illegal Cruciatus Curse on Harry to {{interrogate}} him on Sirius's whereabouts. She also reveals she herself ordered the Dementor attack on him, intending to have him either silenced or discredited. Hermione intervenes {{and in order to}} create a distraction, convinces Umbridge that they are hiding a weapon of Dumbledore's in the Forbidden Forest. Harry and Hermione lead her into an area of the forest inhabited by centaurs, where Umbridge provokes them into taking her captive. The centaurs are furious upon learning that Hermione used them to do her bidding <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pair, but Grawp arrives and clashes with the centaurs, allowing Harry and Hermione to escape.|$|E
25|$|In {{the year}} 4000 (The Daleks' Master Plan, 1965–66), {{they have an}} {{interstellar}} Dalek Empire. In this story, the Daleks form an alliance with beings from the 'Outer Galaxies' in a plot to attack the Solar System with help from its treacherous Guardian Mavic Chen, who supplies them with taranium for the Time Destructor. The First Doctor steals the Taranium during the final meeting on the planet Kembel, but the Daleks pursue him through time and space. They finally recover the Taranium <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> delegates, leading to Mavic Chen's death. However, the surviving delegates are released {{and go back to}} their own galaxies to warn them of the Daleks. The Doctor activates the Time Destructor and the Daleks are destroyed, though his companion Sara Kingdom is turned to dust.|$|E

25|$|Microbiologists {{have studied}} the genetic {{mechanisms}} by which the V. cholerae bacteria turn off the production of some proteins <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> production of other proteins as they respond to the series of chemical environments they encounter, passing through the stomach, through the mucous layer of the small intestine, {{and on to the}} intestinal wall. Of particular interest have been the genetic mechanisms by which cholera bacteria turn on the protein production of the toxins that interact with host cell mechanisms to pump chloride ions into the small intestine, creating an ionic pressure which prevents sodium ions from entering the cell. The chloride and sodium ions create a salt-water environment in the small intestines, which through osmosis can pull up to six litres of water per day through the intestinal cells, creating the massive amounts of diarrhea. The host can become rapidly dehydrated unless an appropriate mixture of dilute salt water and sugar is taken to replace the blood's water and salts lost in the diarrhea.|$|E
25|$|SSRIs prevent 5-HT from binding to SERT which {{prevents}} absorption of 5-HT {{back into the}} presynapse terminal, where it is metabolized by monoamine oxidase or stored in secretory vesicles. As a result, the 5-HT concentration increases at the somatodendritic area of the 5-HT neuron {{but not so much}} at the axon terminal area (demonstrated in figure 2). This increase in 5-HT concentration causes desensitization of somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors. When these 5-HT1A autoreceptors have been downregulated, they will no longer restrict the impulse flow of the 5-HT neuron. The impulse flow is turned on and as a result 5-HT is released at the axon terminal. However, this increase of 5-HT does not happen quickly compared to the increase of 5-HT at the somatodendretic area of the 5-HT neuron. This delay is caused by the time it takes 5-HT to downregulate 5-HT1A autoreceptors <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> neuro impulse flow of the 5-HT neuron. This delay can explain the reason why antidepressants do not have effect on depression immediately. This can also be the reason why the antidepressant mechanisms can be connected to the increasing neuro impulse flow from 5-HT neurons, where as the concentration of 5-HT increases at the axon terminal before SSRIs start to work properly. When SSRIs have (1) inhibited the re-uptake pump, (2) increased somatodendritic 5-HT, (3) desensitized somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors, (4) turned on the impulse flow and (5) increased the release of 5-HT from axon terminal, the last step might be desensitization of postsynaptic 5-HT receptors. This desensitization could be the reason for reduction of adverse effects of SSRIs as tolerance develops.|$|E
2500|$|In all NASCAR series, if the {{caution is}} out for debris, accident, or inclement weather, the flagman will display the yellow caution flag and the pace car [...] will {{pull out of the}} pits <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> yellow strobes on top and/or behind the car. [...] When race {{officials}} are ready to open pit lane, a green light will come on in the rear window of the safety car.

2500|$|The wreck was {{investigated}} by several agencies. [...] The truck driver, John R. Stokes, {{had been convicted}} of numerous traffic violations in the past, and his trucking company, Melco, had been cited for safety violations. [...] The NTSB's investigation placed the fault of the collision on Stokes and his failure to yield at the grade crossing, but the investigation by the Illinois State Police found that the train detection system had failed to detect the fast-moving (79 mph) Amtrak train {{at the beginning of the}} approach circuit <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> flashing lights and gates for the federally required 20 seconds. A witness saw the late activation and the gates coming down just as the front of the locomotive reached the crossing. That conclusion was confirmed by the chief engineer for the company that manufactured the track detection equipment, Harmon Industries.|$|E
2500|$|Williamson scored test match {{score of}} 161 against West Indies in June 2014. It was his second test century {{of the series}} and helped secure a rare away test series victory for his side. Williamson {{finished}} as the leading overall run scorer in the series with 413 runs, and was denied a double century only by rain, which forced skipper Brendon McCullum to declare {{in the interest of}} obtaining a result in the match. He was also reported for a suspect bowling action in April 2014, but was cleared in December 2014. His illegal bowling action started after he left high school {{in order to get a}} faster release <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ball. [...] His new action essentially reverts him to his action in high school, with a more side-on approach and less wrist and elbow deviation. He was also named as captain ahead of the ODI and Twenty20 series against Pakistan as Brendon McCullum was rested.|$|E

We suspend most of the usual railway traffic <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> military time-table--say on Friday at midnight. By 4 A.M. the trains are running from every big centre in England to the nearest port at two-minute intervals. As a rule, the Armity meets us at the other end with shipping of sorts--fleet reserves or regular men of war or hulks--anything you can stick a gang-plank to. We pile the men on to the troop-decks, stack the rifles in the racks, send down the sea-kit, steam about for a few hours, and land 'em somewhere. It's a good notion, because our army to be any use must be an army of embarkation. Why, last Whit Monday we had--how many were down at the dock-edge in the first eight hours? Kyd, you're the Volunteer enthusiast last from school." ...|$|E

6000|$|Morton was {{suffering}} with the girl, whose hand {{was beginning to}} tremble beneath his palm. She no longer replied to his questions, but {{that she was still}} awake he knew, for he could hear her sighing deeply, so deeply that the sound troubled him almost as if she were weeping. His impulse was to rise <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> light and give over this trial, which could only end in humiliating her. [...] "Her temerity is a part of her malady," [...] he argued. [...] "It has arisen through years of misconceived petting and nursing on the part of her mother. Up to this moment her performances have always been in the presence of friends and relatives, or for the consolation of those eager to believe, and therefore easily deluded. Every sitter has conspired to practically force her into an elaborate series of deceptions, each deceit being built upon and made necessary by the other. It is pitiful, but she now believes in herself--that is pathetically certain. Otherwise she would not have yielded herself so completely into the hands of an inexorable investigator like Weissmann. She must take the consequences," [...] he ended, with grim closing of the lips. [...] "We must be cruel in order to be kind. This night may be her salvation." ...|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} Mr. Crawley was almost beside himself, and was {{altogether}} {{at a loss}} how {{to bring in the}} matter on which he wished to speak. He had expected to find a man who in the hurry of London business might perhaps just manage to spare him five minutes,--who would grapple instantly with the subject that was to be discussed between them, would speak to him half-a-dozen hard words of wisdom, and would then dismiss him <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> instant to other matters of important business;--but here was an easy familiar fellow, who seemed to have nothing on earth to do, and who at this first meeting had taken advantage of a distant family connexion to tell him everything about the affairs of his own household. And then how peculiar were the domestic traits which he told! What was Mr. Crawley to say to a man who had taught his own children to call their mother Thais? Of Thais Mr. Crawley did know something, and he forgot to remember that perhaps Mr. Toogood knew less. He felt it, however, {{to be very difficult to}} submit the details of his case to a gentleman who talked in such a strain about his own wife and children.|$|E

"I don't know {{of another}} psychic in America {{who would have}} {{submitted}} to the test we put upon Mrs. Smiley to-night, but 'Mitchell' has assured me he will go further: he will let us hold her hands <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> light. I feel as if the great mystery were almost within our grasp. By the ghost of Euclid! I have the conviction at this moment {{that we are at}} the point of proving for ourselves the elongation of the psychic's limbs! Suppose Flammarion is right? Suppose that the psychic can extend her arms beyond their normal proportions? You should be ready to give a year, ten years, to demonstrating a single one of these physical effects. If I am any judge of character, this little woman is as honest and as wholesome as Mrs. Miller herself. It isn't this one performance alone which proves it. It is the implication of a dozen other sittings, almost as convincing as this, that gives me hope of proving something. Let us have our next sitting at Cameron's. It is only fair to readmit them, for we have proven that they {{had nothing to do with}} our performance that first night. Let us ask to be permitted to hold the hands and feet of the psychic, and also to take a flash-light picture of the floating cone. We may yet see these ghostly hands in the light of the lamp." ...|$|E
