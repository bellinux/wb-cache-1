50|$|Ramie {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} fiber crops, having been used for at least six {{thousand}} years, and is principally used for fabric production. It is a bast fiber, and the part used is the bark (phloem) of the vegetative stalks. Ramie is normally harvested two to three times a year but under good growing conditions can be harvested up to six times per year. Unlike other bast crops, ramie requires chemical processing <b>to</b> <b>de-gum</b> the fiber.|$|R
50|$|The {{extraction}} of the fiber occurs in three stages. First the cortex or bark is removed; {{this can be}} done by hand or by machine. This process is called de-cortication. Second the cortex is scraped to remove most of the outer bark, the parenchyma in the bast layer and some of the gums and pectins. Finally the residual cortex material is washed, dried, and <b>de-gummed</b> <b>to</b> extract the spinnable fiber.|$|R
