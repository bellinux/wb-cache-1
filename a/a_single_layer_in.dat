Research shows that reelin expression goes up as the cortex becomes more complex, reaching the maximum in the human brain in which the reelin-secreting Cajal-Retzius cells have significantly more complex axonal arbour. Reelin is present in the telencephalon of all the vertebrates studied so far, but the pattern of expression differs widely. For example, zebrafish have no Cajal-Retzius cells at all; instead, the protein is being secreted by other neurons. These cells do not form a dedicated layer in amphibians, and radial migration in their brains is very weak.|$|E

40|$|Single {{and double}} layer In 0. 5 Ga 0. 5 As/GaAs QDs with various buffer layer {{thickness}} were grown by metal-organic {{chemical vapor deposition}} (MOCVD) using Stranski-Krastanow growth mode. The effect of buffer layer thickness on a high density QDs has been investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Surface morphology which includes variation in the size and density of the dots on the surface has been studied. <b>A</b> <b>single</b> <b>layer</b> <b>In</b> 0. 5 Ga 0. 5 As QDs with 100 nm and 300 nm GaAs buffer layer shows higher density of QDs with apparently smaller dots size.
