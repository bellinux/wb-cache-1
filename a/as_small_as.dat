5|$|Another {{threat to}} {{albatrosses}} is introduced species, such as rats or feral cats, which directly attack albatrosses or their chicks and eggs. Albatrosses {{have evolved to}} breed on islands where land mammals are absent and have not developed defences against them. Even species <b>as</b> <b>small</b> <b>as</b> mice can be detrimental; on Gough Island the chicks of Tristan albatrosses are attacked and eaten alive by introduced house mice. Introduced species can have other indirect effects: cattle overgrazed essential cover on Amsterdam Island, threatening the Amsterdam albatross; on other islands introduced plants reduce potential nesting habitat.|$|E

5|$|Bacteria {{display a}} wide {{diversity}} {{of shapes and}} sizes, called morphologies. Bacterial cells are about one-tenth the size of eukaryotic cells and are typically 0.5–5.0micrometres in length. However, a few species are visible to the unaided eye—for example, Thiomargarita namibiensis is up to half a millimetre long and Epulopiscium fishelsoni reaches 0.7mm. Among the smallest bacteria {{are members of the}} genus Mycoplasma, which measure only 0.3micrometres, <b>as</b> <b>small</b> <b>as</b> the largest viruses.

5|$|One {{industrial}} application for helium is leak detection. Because helium diffuses through solids three {{times faster than}} air, it {{is used as a}} tracer gas to detect leaks in high-vacuum equipment (such as cryogenic tanks) and high-pressure containers. The tested object is placed in a chamber, which is then evacuated and filled with helium. The helium that escapes through the leaks is detected by a sensitive device (helium mass spectrometer), even at the leak rates <b>as</b> <b>small</b> <b>as</b> 10−9 mbar·L/s (10−10 Pa·m3/s). The measurement procedure is normally automatic and is called helium integral test. A simpler procedure is to fill the tested object with helium and to manually search for leaks with a hand-held device.|$|E

5|$|The procellariids are {{the most}} {{numerous}} family of tubenoses, and the most diverse. They {{range in size from}} the giant petrels, which are almost as large as the albatrosses, to the prions, which are <b>as</b> <b>small</b> <b>as</b> the larger storm petrels. They feed on fish, squid and crustacea, with many also taking fisheries discards and carrion. All species are accomplished long-distance foragers, and many undertake long trans-equatorial migrations. They are colonial breeders, exhibiting long-term mate fidelity and site philopatry. In all species, each pair lays a single egg per breeding season. Their incubation times and chick-rearing periods are exceptionally long compared to other birds.|$|E
5|$|The {{table to}} the right lists the {{critical}} masses for curium isotopes for a sphere, without a moderator and reflector. With a metal reflector (30cm of steel), the critical masses of the odd isotopes are about 3–4kg. When using water (thickness ~20–30cm) as the reflector, the critical mass can be <b>as</b> <b>small</b> <b>as</b> 59gram for 245Cm, 155gram for 243Cm and 1550gram for 247Cm. There is a significant uncertainty in these critical mass values. Whereas it is usually of the order 20%, the values for 242Cm and 246Cm were listed as large as 371kg and 70.1kg, respectively, by some research groups.|$|E

5|$|At Valencia {{and other}} regions of eastern Spain, the storm {{generated}} heavy precipitation, while six tornadoes touched down over the Balearic Islands. While approaching {{the coast of the}} Balearic Islands, the warm-core low induced a pressure drop of 11mbar (0.32inHg) at Palma, Majorca in advance of the tropical cyclone's landfall. Medicanes <b>as</b> <b>small</b> <b>as</b> the one that formed in September1996 are atypical, and often require circumstances different even from those required for regular Mediterranean tropical cyclone formation. Warm low-level advection–transfer of heat through air or sea–caused by a large-scale low over the western Mediterranean was a primary factor in the rise of strong convection. The presence of a mid- to upper-level cut-off cold-core low, a method of formation typical to medicanes, was also key to the development of intense thunderstorms within the cyclone. In addition, interaction between a northeastward-drifting trough, the medicane, and the large-scale also permitted the formation of tornadoes within thunderstorms generated by the cyclone after making landfall.|$|E
5|$|Mating in the {{epaulette}} shark takes place from July to December, though in captivity reproduction occurs continuously. Courtship may be {{initiated by the}} female following and biting the male. The male then holds onto the pectoral fin of the female with his mouth and lies alongside her, while inserting one of his claspers into her cloaca. Copulation lasts about {{one and a half}} minutes. Epaulette sharks readily breed in aquariums, even in tanks <b>as</b> <b>small</b> <b>as</b> 135 gallons, but larger tanks are recommended to allow room for the hatched offspring. This species is oviparous, with females depositing eggs from August to December. The female drops the egg capsules two (rarely four) at a time every 14 days, producing a total of 20ndash&50 eggs per year. Each egg case measures 10 cm (3.9 in) long and 4 cm (1.6 in) wide. The young emerge after 120ndash&130 days, at a length of 14ndash&16 cm (5.5ndash&6.3 in). The growth rate of the young is slow at first but increases to about 5 cm (2 in) per year after three months. Both males and females mature sexually at a length of 54ndash&64 cm (21ndash&25 in), corresponding to an age of at least seven years.|$|E

5|$|Music in {{religious}} rituals, especially Roman Catholic, {{manifests itself in}} a number of ways. Parish bands, for example, are quite common throughout Italy. They may be <b>as</b> <b>small</b> <b>as</b> four or five members to as many as 20 or 30. They commonly perform at religious festivals specific to a particular town, usually in honor of the town's patron saint. The historic orchestral/choral masterpieces performed in church by professionals are well-known; these include such works as the Stabat Mater by Giovanni Battista Pergolesi and Verdi's Requiem. The Second Vatican Council from 1962 to 1965 revolutionized music in the Roman Catholic Church, leading to {{an increase in the number}} of amateur choirs that perform regularly for services; the Council also encouraged the congregational singing of hymns, and a vast repertoire of new hymns has been composed in the last 40 years.|$|E
5|$|Nest size {{depends on}} species of bumblebee. Most form colonies of between 50 and 400 individuals, but colonies have been {{documented}} <b>as</b> <b>small</b> <b>as</b> ~20 individuals and as large as 1700. These nests are small compared to honeybee hives, which hold about 50,000 bees. Many species nest underground, choosing old rodent burrows or sheltered places, and avoiding places that receive direct sunlight {{that could result in}} overheating. Other species make nests above ground, whether in thick grass or in holes in trees. A bumblebee nest is not organised into hexagonal combs like that of a honeybee; the cells are instead clustered together untidily. The workers remove dead bees or larvae from the nest and deposit them outside the nest entrance, helping to prevent disease. Nests in temperate regions last only for a single season and do not survive the winter.|$|E
5|$|Nocturnal in habits, the tawny {{nurse shark}} tends {{to spend the day}} resting in piles of two dozen or more {{individuals}} inside caves or under ledges. At night, it is an active-swimming predator that uses a powerful suction force to extract prey from inside holes and crevices. The diet of this species consists mainly of octopus, though they also take other invertebrates, small bony fishes, and rarely sea snakes. It is aplacental viviparous, meaning the embryos hatch from egg capsules inside the mother. It is the only carpet shark in which the embryos are oophagous, feeding on eggs produced by the mother while inside the uterus. The litter size may be <b>as</b> <b>small</b> <b>as</b> one or two, based on the large size of near-term embryos.|$|E
