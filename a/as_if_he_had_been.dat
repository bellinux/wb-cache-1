5|$|The journey's beginning, on 9 July 1763, was inauspicious; on {{the first}} day a {{carriage}} wheel broke, requiring a 24-hour pause while repairs were carried out. Leopold turned this delay to advantage by taking Wolfgang to the nearby church at Wasserburg, where according to Leopold the boy played on the organ pedalboard <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> studying it for months. In Munich, on successive evenings, the children played before Elector Maximilian III, earning from these engagements the equivalent of half of Leopold's annual salary of 354 gulden or florins. The next stop was Augsburg, where Leopold's estranged mother refused to attend any of the three concerts given there. The family then moved on to Schwetzingen and the Mannheim court, where the children's performance apparently amazed Elector Palatine Karl Theodor and his Electress.|$|E
25|$|On 24 November Childers was {{executed}} by firing squad. Childers was the Republican head of propaganda {{and it was}} widely speculated that seven low-ranking Republicans were shot before Childers {{so that it would}} not look <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> singled out to be executed.|$|E
25|$|The murderer {{seems to}} have escaped through the study's open window and the murder was {{committed}} with an ornate dagger that was often lying about the hall. Parker overheard talk of blackmail and Sheppard tells Poirot of the real cause of Mrs. Ferrars’ suicide and the letter that Sir Roger received. He and Sheppard went into the study after dinner to read it but Sir Roger {{had a change of}} mind and asked Sheppard to leave him alone to peruse its contents. Sheppard did so and found Parker just outside the door, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> listening to what was happening within...|$|E

It sounded to me <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> already paid, to some extent, the debt he spoke of, or <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> no doubt whatever that he should {{do so in the}} future.' ...|$|R

25|$|The CAB {{primarily}} {{attributed the}} crash {{to the failure}} of the Swift's pilot to exercise proper caution during his landing approach. The Swift's pilot radioed the Love tower to request a straight-in approach, but he did so much closer to the airport than recommended by flight regulations, he did not state his position, heading, or speed, and he failed to establish two-way communication to obtain a landing clearance. If a pilot could not establish clear contact with the tower, visual flight rules stated that he should only continue the approach with extreme caution under the assumption that conflicting air traffic was in the area. Instead, he continued the straight-in approach <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> properly cleared to land. Due to the lack of communication with the Swift, controllers were unaware of the proximity of the two aircraft until the Swift was spotted from the tower, leaving inadequate time to warn the airliner's crew of the situation.|$|E
500|$|Robson {{filed an}} amended {{complaint}} on July 1, 2013, which stated, [...] "The long-term psychological consequences of (Jackson’s) threats, sexual trauma and mental manipulation imprisoned (Robson’s) mind and {{prevented him from}} filing a timely claim just as effectively <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> physically imprisoned." ...|$|E
500|$|Having {{disabled}} both {{guns and}} enabled the recapture of the British position, O'Leary {{then returned to}} his unit with his prisoners, apparently [...] "as cool <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{for a walk in}} the park." [...] For his actions, O'Leary received a battlefield promotion to sergeant on 4 February and was recommended for the Victoria Cross, which was gazetted on 18 February: ...|$|E

500|$|Peterson also voices Alpha, the Doberman Pinscher leader. Pete Docter {{has stated}} that Alpha [...] "thinks of himself as Clint Eastwood". Despite his menacing appearance, a {{frequent}} malfunction in Alpha's translating collar causes his voice to sound comically high-pitched and squeaky, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> breathing helium. The normal voice for his translator is a resonant, intimidating bass. With both voices, Alpha has a roundabout speech pattern that causes his sentences to be longer than necessary.|$|E
500|$|Eight years later, Dr. B. Brookes Lee {{was arrested}} in Portland, Oregon. He {{had been accused of}} {{treating}} Sharkey to make it appear that he had been fouled by Fitzsimmons. Lee admitted it was true. [...] "I fixed Sharkey up to look <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> fouled. How? Well, that is something I do not care to reveal, but I will assert that it was done—that is enough. There is no doubt that Fitzsimmons was entitled to the decision and did not foul Sharkey. I got $1,000 for my part in the affair." ...|$|E
500|$|Marlborough {{was welcomed}} and fêted {{by the people}} and courts of Europe, where {{he was not only}} {{respected}} as a great general but also as a prince of the Holy Roman Empire. Sarah joined him in February 1713, and was delighted when on reaching Frankfurt in the middle of May to see that the troops under Eugene's command paid her lord [...] "all the respects <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> at his old post". The Duke also journeyed to his principality of Mindelheim which was destined, as he suspected, to revert to Bavaria {{at the conclusion of the}} peace negotiations.|$|E

500|$|The {{body was}} buried in a coffin and later {{translated}} to Beodericsworth, but Abbo failed to date either events, although from the text {{it can be seen}} that he believed that the relics had been taken to Beodericsworth by the time that Theodred became Bishop of London in around 926. Upon exhumation of the body, a miracle was discovered. All the arrow wounds upon Edmund's corpse had healed and his head was reattached. The only evidence of decapitation was a line around his neck and his skin was still soft and fresh, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> sleeping. [...] The last recorded inspection of the body whilst at Bury St Edmunds was in 1198.|$|E
500|$|At this point, the {{detachment}} of regulars sent to Barrett's farm marched {{back from their}} fruitless search of that area. They passed through the now mostly-deserted battlefield, and saw dead and wounded comrades lying on the bridge. There was one who looked to them <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> scalped, which angered and shocked the British soldiers. They crossed the bridge {{and returned to the}} town by 11:30 a.m., under the watchful eyes of the colonists, who continued to maintain defensive positions. [...] The regulars continued to search for and destroy colonial military supplies in the town, ate lunch, reassembled for marching, and left Concord after noon. [...] This delay in departure gave colonial militiamen from outlying towns additional time to reach the road back to Boston.|$|E
500|$|We {{as readers}} or {{audience}} appreciate the characters {{by the force}} of our imagination's seeming to participate in the scene, as if we were present during such an event in real life. Commenting on the scene in Julius Caesar where Caesar confides to Marc Antony his apprehensions about Cassius, Hazlitt writes: [...] "We know hardly any passage more expressive of the genius of Shakespeare than this. It is <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> actually present, had known the different characters and what they thought of one another, and had taken down what he heard and saw, their looks, words, and gestures, just as they happened." [...] In [...] "Hamlet", he observes that [...] "the characters think and speak and act just as they might do, if left entirely to themselves. [...] The whole play is an exact transcript of what might be supposed to have taken place at the court of Denmark [...]" ...|$|E

500|$|Thomas Courtenay's force {{attacked}} Radford's manor that night; {{they set}} fire to the wall and gates to draw him out. On their word, including Courtenay's solemn promise to do him no harm if he would speak with them, Radford let them in – although apparently he commented upon their large number. Whilst Radford and Devon's son drank wine, the latter's followers [...] "ransacked" [...] Radford's house, stealing goods up to the value of 1,000 marks, including all his horses and the sheets off his invalid wife's bed. On a pretext of meeting his father the earl, Courtenay persuaded Radford to accompany him when his force withdrew; however, he abandoned Radford on the road a short distance from the house, and six of Courtenay's men killed him. Devon subsequently dispatched a force to the chapel where Radford's body was; they performed, says Storey, a [...] "mock inquest, one of them acting as coroner and others, with assumed names, as jurors. They brought in a verdict of suicide." [...] They then forced Radford's servants to convey his corpse <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a heretic to the graveyard, where it was deposited unceremoniously into an open grave; the stones laid ready to build his memorial were then dropped on the body, crushing it. By making recognition of the body impossible, this prevented an official inquest being held into Radford's death.|$|E
500|$|Bellman was a skilful and {{entertaining}} performer of his songs, accompanying {{himself on the}} cittern, putting on different voices, and imitating the sounds made by a crowd of people. He is unusual, even unique, among major poets in {{that almost all of}} his work was [...] "conceived to music". His achievement has been compared to Shakespeare, Beethoven, Mozart, and Hogarth. Bellman, however, was no great playwright, nor a major classical composer. His biographer, Paul Britten Austin, suggests that the comparison with Hogarth is closer to the mark. Bellman had a gift for using elegant classical references in comic contrast to the sordid realities of drinking and prostitution. The way he does this, at once regretting and celebrating these excesses in song, achieves something of what Hogarth achieved in engravings and paint. The art historian Axel Romdahl describes Bellman's sensibility <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a painter: [...] "An unusual swiftness of apprehension, both optical and aural, must have distinguished him." [...] Britten Austin agrees with this, noting that [...] "When [...] words and music have faded into silence it is the visual image which remains." [...] Jan Sjåvik comments in the Historical Dictionary of Scandinavian Literature and Theater that [...] "Bellman's achievement consists in taking this humble and unrecognized literary form [...] and raising it to a genre that became impossible to ignore, while in the process creating songs and characters that have become an indispensable part of Sweden's literary and cultural heritage." ...|$|E
2500|$|Antoine de [...] Noailles, the French ambassador, said in {{a letter}} that Rogers' death {{confirmed}} the alliance between the Pope and England. He also spoke of the support given to Rogers by the greatest part of the people: [...] "even his children assisted at it, comforting him in such a manner that it seemed <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> led to a wedding." ...|$|E

2500|$|Security Chief Tony Verdeschi {{also joined}} {{as a new}} character, played by Tony Anholt. Verdeschi, who assumed the base's second-in-command role, neither appeared, nor was ever mentioned, in Year One. However, Moonbase Alpha {{personnel}} treated Verdeschi <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> in their midst since [...] "Breakaway". His character was designed to serve primarily as a secondary male action hero, and became a romantic interest for Maya.|$|E
2500|$|To Bradman, even in {{the first}} series {{after so many years}} of war and suffering, there was {{apparently}} no room for carefree cricket in an Anglo-Australian Test. He knew of only one way in which to play this game...In the 1946–47 Tests {{he was in charge of}} the stronger side, and for that reason seemed to overshadow Hammond, although he went on the field with an outlook that was vastly different to the Englishman. He appeared as determined in seeking convincing victory <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> opposed by a team of Jardines and Larwoods ...|$|E
2500|$|One Texas Ranger {{said that}} {{although}} {{it was obvious to}} him that Lucas often lied, there was an instance where he demonstrated guilty knowledge: [...] "I remember him trying to cop to one he didn't do, but there was another murder case where I'll kiss your butt if he didn’t lead us right to the deer stand where the murder took place. Ain't no way he could've guessed that, and I damn sure didn't tell him. I think he did that one." [...] Another Ranger had a similar experience: Lucas demonstrated his apparent familiarity with a crime scene by directing his escort to the murder location with ease, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> there before.|$|E
