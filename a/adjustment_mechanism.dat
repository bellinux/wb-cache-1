25|$|StingRays are {{generally}} {{known for the}} punch of their sound, making them very suitable for rock/funk applications and excellent for slapping, and for being of extremely high build quality. The 6-bolt neckplate {{is an example of}} this. The neck is also quite wide, especially compared to that of Fender Jazz Bass-type models (although a neck with a narrower nut was optional in the 70s and is again as of 2010 called the Stingray SLO Special), as well as having the above-mentioned truss-rod <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanism</b> that allows players to adjust the truss-rod without removing the neck. Some users have also noticed an audible difference in volume between the lower three strings (E, A, D) and the highest G string, with the G string suffering from a lack of volume - conversely many users do not experience this, and recordings demonstrate an even volume across the strings, suggesting EQ choice in a live setting may be responsible. This problem has not been observed in 5-string StingRays. The Music Man StingRay comes in 4 & 5 string versions with the choice of bolt-on and neck-through construction (as of 2015).|$|E

In December that same year, bread prices were fixed, 55,000 volunteers were sent to the south of the country to teach writing and reading skills and provide medical attention to a sector of the population that had previously been ignored, a central commission was established to oversee a tri-partite payment plan in which equal place was given to government, employees and employers, and a protocol agreement was signed with the United Centre of Workers which granted workers representational rights on the funding board of the Social Planning Ministry. An obligatory minimum wage for workers of all ages (including apprentices) was established, free milk was introduced for expectant and nursing mothers and for [...] {{children between the ages of}} 7 and 14, free school meals were established, rent reductions were carried out, and the construction of the Santiago subway was rescheduled so as to serve working-class neighbourhoods first. Workers benefited from increases in social security payments, an expanded public works program, and a modification of the wage and salary <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanism</b> (which had originally been introduced in the Forties to cope with the country’s permanent inflation), while middle-class Chileans benefited from the elimination of taxes on modest incomes and property. In addition, state-sponsored programs distributed free food to the country’s neediest citizens, and in the countryside, peasant councils were established to mobilise agrarian workers and small proprietors. In the government’s first budget (presented to the Chilean congress in November 1970), the minimum taxable income level was raised, removing from the tax pool 35% of those who had paid taxes on earnings in the previous year. In addition, the exemption from general taxation was raised to a level equivalent to twice the minimum wage. Exemptions from capital taxes were also extended, which benefitted 330,000 small proprietors. The extra increases that Frei promised to the armed forces were also fully paid. According to one estimate, purchasing power went up by 28% between October 1970 and July 1971.|$|E

40|$|Since {{the euro}} was launched, divergences in European economies'evolutions {{have been more}} {{significant}} than generally expected. The article, based on a multinational macroeconomic model describing the interdependence between 14 European countries, examines {{the role played by}} relative-price <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and difficulties inherent in asymmetric evolutions. The efficiency of relative-price <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanisms</b> seems limited and, even in the most flexible countries, the return to equilibrium is slow and still incomplete after 10 years. Differences in relative-price <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanisms</b> remain a source of asymmetries between member countries. Extra-European exchanges have a stabilizing role which is uneven on account of trade openness and price elasticities. A decrease of the world demand and a depreciation of the euro, still have an important impact with significant disparities between countries. Several lessons can be drawn in terms of economic policy. A more restrictive European fiscal policy proves more costly in the long run in Germany and the Netherlands on account of the weakness of price compensation effects. On the contrary, thanks to their greater flexibility, the United Kingdom and Sweden can offset an initial negative shock more rapidly. The wage dimension in the definition of a good European policy mix has also to be examined. Monetary union, asymmetries, prices adjustments, exchange rate,...|$|R

40|$|The Swedish social {{security}} system contains a mechanism referred to as an automatic balancing mechanism (ABM) that adjusts the rate credited to contributor accounts {{and the amount of}} increase in pensions in payment when liabilities exceed assets. The Swedish {{social security}} system also includes some other adjustment features including adjusting annuity factors to reflect, in part, improvements in cohort mortality and crediting accumulations (and to a certain extent pensions in payment, as will be explained in the paper) with the rate of growth in average wage per capita, thus connecting the growth in contributions and pensions to economic growth. The German {{social security system}} adjusts benefits by a sustainability factor that has been calculated to maintain long?term contribution rates within a certain range. The above description of Sweden’s social security applies to the component of the system that is Notional Defined Contribution (NDC). The German system, as it has been modified, could be considered to be quasi NDC. Mathematically, NDC and career?average?earnings defined benefit (DB) plans are similar. This paper considers the question of how the <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanisms</b> described for the Swedish and German social security systems might be incorporated into private sector DB plans of the following types: multi?employer and single employer.

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{implications}} of fuel <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for the economic efficiency of the U. S., focusing on fuel adjustment clauses (FAC) for electricity rates. Fuel <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanisms</b> used in electricity and natural gas pricing are formulae that provide for automatic adjustments in output prices in response {{to changes in the}} factor prices of boiler fuels and wellhead gas, respectively. Fuel <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanisms</b> were first utilized in the U. S. during World War I to enable the regulatory process to function in response to the rapid increase in coal prices. A central feature of an FAC is that it acts directly on the output price without a specific consideration of its effect on the rate of return earned by the firm once the adjustment has been made. One of the principal arguments against fuel adjustment clauses is that they dampen incentives for the choice of the least-cost fuel supply. Fuel <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanisms</b> can lead to inefficiency both with respect to the choice by utility of a technology and its selection of fuel supply sources. The fuel supply decision poses an efficiency problem primarily in conjunction with decreasing returns to scale, since a firm with non-decreasing returns to scale and an output price at least as great as marginal cost will choose the fuel supply source that is anticipated to have the smallest factor price increase. When there is an incentive to purchase the inefficient fuel, the collection lag can be extended to induce efficiency. This extension, however, affects the choice of technology by reducing both the technically efficient fuel-capital ratio and the ratio preferred by the firm. Fuel adjustment clauses thus pose a complex efficiency problem, which can be compensated for but not eliminated by the design of the adjustment formula. status: publishe...|$|R
