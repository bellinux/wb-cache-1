[...] In [...] "No Reaper Left Behind", the Devil tells Sam, [...] "I expect you to rise to the heights of political power here on Earth, seize control of the planet, and hasten the Apocalypse." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cantor Rabinowitz {{wants his}} son {{to carry on the}} generations-old family {{tradition}} and become a cantor at the synagogue in the Jewish ghetto of Manhattan's Lower East Side. But down at the beer garden, thirteen-year-old Jakie Rabinowitz is performing so-called jazz tunes. Moisha Yudelson spots the boy and tells Jakie's father, who drags him home. Jakie clings to his mother, Sara, as his father declares, [...] "I'll teach him better than to debase the voice God gave him!" [...] Jakie threatens: [...] "If you whip me again, I'll run away— and never come back!" [...] After the whipping, Jakie kisses his mother goodbye and, true to his word, runs away. At the Yom Kippur service, Rabinowitz mournfully tells a fellow celebrant, [...] "My son was to stand <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>side</b> and sing tonight– but now I have no son." [...] As the sacred Kol Nidre is sung, Jakie sneaks back home to retrieve a picture of his loving mother.|$|E
2500|$|... nerves are {{stretched}} like a wire; the simplest outing becomes a huge challenge – I {{have to have}} Angela's arm to support me most days... my balance {{or lack of it}} is probably my biggest problem. My blessings are my memories and we have a few very loyal friends who help us through the bad days... Financially all's well. Thank goodness my wife, who holds nothing of the past over my head, is constantly <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>side.</b> Real love never dies. We share a sense of humour which at times is vital. If I have a philosophy it is that life doesn't put everything your way. It takes a little back. I strive to remember the ups rather than the downs. I {{have a lot of time}} with my thoughts these days and sometimes they hurt so much I can hardly bear it. However, my friends always associate me with the song: [...] "When You're Smiling..." [...] lt isn't always easy but I'm trying to live up to it.|$|E

60|$|As I stood thus thinking, another door, {{this time}} {{at one of the}} long sides of the arena, was thrown open, and into the theater of death slunk a mighty tarag, the huge cave tiger of the Stone Age. <b>At</b> <b>my</b> <b>sides</b> were <b>my</b> revolvers. My captors had not taken them from me, be-cause they did not yet realize their nature. Doubtless they thought them some strange manner of war-club, and as those who are {{condemned}} to the arena are per-mitted weapons of defense, they let me keep them.|$|R
60|$|I stood {{close to}} the instrument-covered wall--Dejah Thoris <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>side.</b> She {{looked up at me}} wonderingly as the warriors {{advanced}} upon us with drawn swords, for mine still hung within its scabbard <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>side,</b> and there was a smile upon my lips.|$|E

60|$|Suddenly I {{felt that}} I {{was no longer}} alone and looking round, saw Goza <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E

60|$|After supper I was {{requested}} to relate, seriatim, all the recent events connected with {{my visit to}} the 'Nest, my arrest and liberation. This I did, of course, seated <b>at</b> <b>my</b> grandmother's <b>side,</b> the old lady holding one of my hands the whole time I was speaking. The most profound attention was lent by all the party; and a thoughtful silence succeeded my narration, which ended only {{with the history of}} our departure from the mills.|$|R
5000|$|Jean Butler {{was born}} in Mineola, New York. Her mother, Josephine, is from County Mayo in Ireland. She has a sister, Cara. She started ballet and tap classes {{at the age of}} four. She {{eventually}} quit both. She began Irish dance lessons at the age of six, which she quit promptly. [...] "I hated it," [...] she says. [...] "They made me stand with <b>my</b> arms <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>sides</b> for two hours. So, I left. I was too young." [...] She tried Irish dance again at age nine, this time with a different dance teacher, Donald Golden, whom she considers {{to be one of the}} most influential people in her life. About a year into Irish dance, she became very serious with it and quit the soccer and baseball teams. From a young age, she competed in regional, national and international championships. Jean and her sister Cara won numerous national titles and regional titles, and placed well in international competitions. Butler attended Hofstra University and earned an Honours Degree in Theatre and Drama from the University of Birmingham.|$|R
60|$|It {{was twenty}} minutes, and the reds had all faded into grays before Holmes and the trainer reappeared. Never have I {{seen such a}} change as had been brought about in Silas Brown in that short time. His face was ashy pale, beads of {{perspiration}} shone upon his brow, and his hands shook until the hunting-crop wagged like a branch in the wind. His bullying, overbearing manner was all gone too, and he cringed along <b>at</b> <b>my</b> companion's <b>side</b> like a dog with its master.|$|R
60|$|When I woke {{up again}} {{it was to}} find the Lady Yva seated <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>side</b> {{watching}} me.|$|E
60|$|I {{was still}} lost in {{wonder at the}} sight when I heard a short, quick sob <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E
60|$|There <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>side</b> was Dorothy, even taller in her paleness, with {{sorrow and}} {{agitation}} in her blue eyes.|$|E
60|$|Fresh complications, then! Had the Duke {{come to see}} me off, or had {{his suspicions}} been aroused? Was he even now insisting upon an {{explanation}} with Lord Cheisford? The minutes passed, and I began to get restless and anxious. Then the door opened, and Lord Chelsford entered alone. He came over <b>at</b> once to <b>my</b> <b>side.</b> He was looking perplexed and a little annoyed.|$|R
60|$|The next turn of {{the canyon}} brought me to its mouth, and before me I saw a narrow plain leading down to an ocean. <b>At</b> <b>my</b> right the <b>side</b> of the canyon {{continued}} to the water's edge, the valley lying to my left, and the foot of it running gradually into the sea, where it formed a broad level beach.|$|R
60|$|What {{might have}} followed, {{it is not}} easy to say, had not the loud, declamatory voice of the {{lecturer}} just then been heard, as he commenced his address. This appeared to be a signal for the tribe to make some movement, for the two fellows who had stopped me, walked silently away, though bag of calico went to bag of calico, as they trotted off together, seemingly communicating to each other their suspicions. I took advantage of the opening, and passed into the church, where I worked my way through the throng, and got a seat <b>at</b> <b>my</b> uncle's <b>side.</b>|$|R
60|$|The next morning, {{and very}} early in the morning, I was awaked by Uncle Beamish, who stood <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E
60|$|I know not. I almost desired Sallow <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>side,</b> {{and would}} to heaven Rosinante's nose lay in my palm.|$|E
60|$|Taking {{me by the}} arm, {{my uncle}} led {{the way down the}} stairs. Mr. Banker was close <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would be}} <b>at</b> your <b>side,</b> <b>my</b> liege, when the lion banner {{is in the}} wind once more. I have ever been there. Why should you cast me now? I ask little, dear lord--a galley, a balinger, even a pinnace, so that I may only be there." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{one night}} as I came {{near the village}} of Rosses on the road from Sligo, a fire blazed up on a green bank <b>at</b> <b>my</b> right <b>side</b> seven or eight feet above me, and another fire {{suddenly}} answered from Knock-na-rea. I hurried on doubting, and yet hardly doubting in my heart that I saw again the fires that I had seen by the river at Ballisodare. I began occasionally telling people that one should believe whatever had been believed in all countries and periods, and only reject any part of it after much evidence, instead of starting all over afresh and only believing what one could prove. But I was always ready to deny or turn into a joke what was for all that my secret fanaticism. When I had read Darwin and Huxley and believed as they did, I had wanted, because an established authority was upon <b>my</b> <b>side,</b> to argue with everybody.|$|R
6000|$|... "Believe me, Leo, {{more than}} twenty centuries have gone by since I was seated on a steed, and yet thou seest I have not forgot my horsemanship, though this beast cannot match those Arabs that I rode in the wide deserts of Arabia. Oh! I {{remember}} how <b>at</b> <b>my</b> father's <b>side</b> I galloped down to war against the marauding Bedouins, and how with my own hand I speared their chieftain and made him cry for mercy. One day I will tell thee of that father of mine, for I was his darling, and though we have been long apart, I hold his memory dear {{and look forward to}} our meeting.|$|R
