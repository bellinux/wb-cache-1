25|$|On 13 September 1995, convicted {{criminal}} John Gilligan, Traynor's boss, {{attacked her}} when she confronted him about his lavish lifestyle with no source of income. He later called her at home and threatened to kidnap and rape her son, and kill her if she wrote <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
25|$|Arkan {{became an}} {{untouchable}} criminal figure in Belgrade {{and all of}} the former Yugoslavia. He was really so powerful, so strong financially that no one could do <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>him....</b> In 1993, I learned that Željko Ražnatović, Arkan, had in Belgrade kidnapped and taken to Erdut and there killed Isa Lero... also a man from the criminal underground who had come into conflict with Arkan. I even found a witness to the murder. I publicly accused Arkan. I submitted a report to the police. The police inspectors came to see me. We talked about it. I gave them all the information I had, but then the police inspector told me that they were aware of it but that they were unable to prove it because of the fear among the potential witnesses. So the police were quite well-informed about his criminal activities, but {{it was very hard to}} prove anything or to bring charges because his support network was so widespread, and this can be shown through various newspaper articles and so on. In one television statement, I told him when we were debating on TV, that he had pulled a sock over his head more often than I had pulled one on my feet.|$|E
500|$|Simon Callow, who portrayed Dickens, was {{considered}} apt since he possessed extensive {{knowledge of the}} author and had experience playing the character and recreating his public readings. Callow contended that for him to agree to play Dickens, the script {{would have to be}} a sufficiently high quality. When he heard that the author was to feature in Doctor Who his heart [...] "sank" [...] as he felt fiction has a tendency to posit the author as [...] "a kind of all-purpose Victorian literary character and really understand little, if <b>anything,</b> <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> his life or his books". Director Euros Lyn noted that the material being of interest to Callow was key to getting him involved. Promoting his role in Doctor Who, Callow stated that writer Mark Gatiss knew [...] "exactly what Dickens is all about" [...] and [...] "very cleverly connects his idealism... with the Doctor's desire to save the world". Callow was also pleased that the episode portrayed Dickens as he was towards the end of his life: ill and sad rather than energetic. In the 2011 episode [...] "The Wedding of River Song", Callow returned to reprise his role as Dickens briefly.|$|E

6000|$|... "Scratch at St. Andrews," [...] Dickens told them. [...] "His name's Collins. I don't' know <b>anything</b> else <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> He's {{paid for}} a week and we're jolly glad to get {{visitors}} at all these times." ...|$|R
50|$|According to a {{fragment}} of Aristotle, the first author of Socratic dialogue was Alexamenus of Teos, {{but we do not}} know <b>anything</b> else <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> whether Socrates appeared in his works, or how accurate Aristotle was in his antagonistic judgement <b>about</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
500|$|Todd McCarthy of Variety {{wrote that}} Valkyrie [...] "has visual splendor galore, {{but is a}} cold work lacking in the {{requisite}} tension and suspense". McCarthy considered Cruise as [...] "a bit stiff but still adequate" [...] as von Stauffenberg. The critic believed that McQuarrie's script was well-carpentered but felt that compressing and streamlining the events to make a known failed plot more thrilling lacked a [...] "sufficient sizzle into the dialogue or individuality into the characters". McCarthy missed [...] "many of the interesting personal and political nuances pertaining to these men" [...] that were not detailed. He thought that the production design by Lilly Kilvert and Patrick Lumb stood out, that Newton Thomas Sigel's cinematography had a [...] "restrained elegance", and that John Ottman performed well in his dual role as editor and composer. A similar sentiment was stated by Mike LaSalle in the San Francisco Chronicle, who wrote [...] "There's nothing inherently laughable about the spectacle of Tom Cruise with an eye patch and a missing hand, strutting around in a German colonel's uniform. But neither is there <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> that truly suggests Claus von Stauffenberg, leader of the 1944 conspiracy to decapitate the Nazi government and stage a coup d'etat. Think of Valkyrie as a reasonably entertaining drama about the time Tom Cruise tried to kill Hitler. Do that, and it becomes possible to enjoy the movie.|$|E
500|$|James Arnold Taylor was Tidus' English-language voice. Taylor {{was offered}} the role by voice {{director}} Jack Fletcher (who believed that he would fit the character), and translator Alexander O. Smith explained Tidus to him. In contrast to Morita, Taylor made the character friendlier and less serious with the staff's approval. After recording Final Fantasy X, Taylor {{said that he would}} enjoy voicing Tidus again; the character was [...] "like an old friend to me now. I know so much more about him now than I did when we first started, knowing hardly <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> I would really hate it if anybody else voiced him". Recording the game took Taylor three-and-a-half months, and he enjoyed the experience. According to Taylor, it would be unrealistic for Tidus to hide emotion. He said that although there were things he would change about his performance (such as the scene where Tidus and Yuna begin laughing together), he was grateful for the warm fan reception of his work. Smith felt that the forced-laugh scene was adapted well from the original Japanese scene, because of how [...] "stilted and out of place" [...] it was in the original version. Smith was confused by Morita and Mayuko Aoki's performance, but after discussing it with Nojima he found it well done in both languages and called it [...] "awkward" [...] and [...] "funny". When Final Fantasy X was re-released in 2013, Taylor said that he was proud to be Tidus' voice.|$|E
2500|$|In 1927, British philosopher Bertrand Russell {{stated in}} his lecture Why I Am Not a Christian that [...] "historically {{it is quite}} {{doubtful}} that Jesus existed, {{and if he did}} we do not know <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> so that I am not concerned with the historical question, which is a very difficult one", though Russell did nothing to further develop the idea.|$|E
6000|$|... "His name--yes," [...] said Will, [...] "but I {{never knew}} <b>anything</b> else <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> I {{had nothing to}} {{remember}} or to forget, except, indeed, that he got the name of being a wild scapegrace, something like myself!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{was with}} us {{a minute or two}} before, and was {{following}} a track. After we heard the signal we did not think <b>anything</b> more <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> and whether he followed us or went on looking after the cattle I do not know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear sir, you do {{not know}} the country. Everyone is glad to help a new chum--that is the name for fresh arrivals--to the utmost of his power if he knows <b>anything</b> {{whatever}} <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> and no one thinks anything of trouble." ...|$|R
2500|$|Chucho has {{supposedly}} {{been living}} in Querétaro for some time but few knew <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> After the arrest, he was described by neighbors as someone {{who went to the}} theatre, met people at the train station and walked about in public with “unheard of impertinence.” This {{is one of the reasons}} he became suspect. He had also befriended [...] the owner of a jewelry shop, but he did not have reference as to his identity of “José Vega” or his business.|$|E
2500|$|That Ellsworth {{promoted}} {{the federal government}} as a unified confederacy without the limitations imposed by the Articles of Confederation enhanced his popularity during the first several decades of America's history, especially in the South preceding the Civil War. In 1847, thirteen years before the Civil War, John Calhoun praised Ellsworth as the first of three Founding Fathers (including Sherman and Paterson) who gave the United States [...] "the best government instead of the worst and most intolerable on the earth." [...] However, rapid industrialization and the centralization of U.S. national government since the Civil War have led to the almost complete neglect of Ellsworth's pivotal contribution at the inception of U.S. government. [...] Few today know much of <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to viewer {{concern about the}} direction the writers seemed to be taking Todd and Marty's bond, Carlivati assured Soap Opera Digest {{that he would have}} never written this under different circumstances. [...] "We're not talking about Marty with all her memories. She would never get close to Todd in any way," [...] he said. [...] "This is about a Marty who doesn't remember <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> and he starts to feel close to this new person and starts to feel this gratitude for the fact that she doesn't remember this horrible thing he did." [...] Carlivati added, [...] "It is like this new chapter and this new arc. I don't think I would ever attempt to tell this relationship the way we're telling it if she knew who she was." [...] He said, [...] "I think that's a much different scenario. If we had Marty just come back to town and we started to build a relationship between the two of them...I can't imagine." ...|$|E
50|$|As {{historical}} sources do {{not mention}} <b>anything</b> else <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> remaining information on Świętobór consists of speculation. Historians {{assume that he}} was a ruler of part of Western Pomerania and a descendant of Siemomysł of Pomerania and a relative of Świętopełk, Duke of Pomerania. Modern historians assume that Siemomysł was a descendant of Świętopełk Mieszkowic or Mieszko Mieszkowic.|$|R
60|$|Once upon a {{time there}} lived an emperor whose name was Trojan, and he had ears like a goat. Every morning, when he was shaved, he asked if the man saw <b>anything</b> odd <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> and as each fresh barber always replied that the emperor had goat's ears, he was at once ordered {{to be put to}} death.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, it won't {{hurt you}} {{to keep an eye}} on him, Mr. Marley," [...] {{answered}} Dick, and then, struck with a sudden idea, he continued: [...] "And if you see or hear <b>anything</b> wrong <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> will you do us the favor to let us know at once, over the telephone, or otherwise? I'll pay you for the calls." ...|$|R
2500|$|... you ask who Mr. Millard is {{and what}} reason lies in his {{prejudice}} against Missions in general. Mr. Ament does not know him and I have inquired of several missionaries in Peking, none of whom know <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> He wrote to the Mail as late as Jan. 12th from Peking. You have probably seen his articles {{in some of the}} magazines of America – Scribners or Cosmopolitan. These reporters come through Japan where there is a strong prejudice against Christianity, especially in newspaper circles, and then they stop a few days among the clubs in Shanghai where they are filled with all the yarns about missionaries. I have known of three or four who have admitted that they came north with prejudices against missionaries and that they vanished on acquaintance with our Peking and Tung Chou people. Chamberlain of the Sun was one of these and I think it was he who rebuked another reporter for his tirade against missions by saying [...] "That is the way I felt, too, when I first came but I have changed my mind since I have known the missionaries." [...] We have received copies of a five-column interview with Mr. Ament in the Kobe Herald. He had been terribly slandered by the Kobe Chronicle, whose Editor has announced his purpose to do all the harm to the cause of Christianity that he can, so that we are glad to see an explanation in the same city. We expect Mr. Ament to do much good in setting these things right in the public mind. One of Millard's proteges, Edgar Snow described Millard's [...] "anti-colonial, anti-imperialist, pro-independence, pro-equality of nations, pro-Republican, pro-self-determination and very pro-American [...]" ...|$|E

50|$|A {{boy with}} the surname Bleaney (we are not told his Christian name or indeed <b>anything</b> else <b>about</b> <b>him)</b> makes a {{fleeting}} appearance in 'Jill' as one of John Kemp's classmates at Huddlesford Grammar School. Larkin later used this unusual surname in his well-known poem 'Mr Bleaney', although {{there is nothing to}} indicate that it refers to the same person.|$|R
60|$|He {{passed a}} man in khaki who, he fancied, {{looked at him with}} an odd expression. He {{observed}} the next passers-by narrowly and suspiciously, a couple of smartish young men, a lady with a poodle, a grocer's boy with a basket, but none seemed to observe <b>anything</b> remarkable <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> Then he caught the eye of a taxi-driver and became doubtful again.|$|R

Temrash loses his cool and insults Ax, calling him [...] "Andalite filth" [...] and the others realize he is indeed a Controller.|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't see as it matters," [...] she answered, puzzled. [...] "He didn't come, and {{you don't}} know <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> But, of course, {{if you want}} me to say nothing--" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{looked around}} for his birds, and not seeing them, asked him where they were. He replied, without turning round, that they had all flown away.

50|$|In c.325 BC, Philip married Berenice I as {{her first}} husband.

Philip must have been a nobleman of some social status and influence as he married the great-niece of the powerful Regent Antipater and the grandchild of Antipater’s brother Cassander.|$|R
