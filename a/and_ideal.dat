This small-bulb type has a shallot-like flavour and {{is easy to}} grow <b>and</b> <b>ideal</b> for hot, dry climates. Bulbs are separated, and planted in the fall 1in below the surface and 12in apart. Bulbs will multiply into clumps and can be harvested throughout the cooler months. Tops die back {{in the heat of}} summer and may return with heavy rains; bulbs can remain in the ground or be harvested and stored in a cool dry place for planting in the fall. The plants rarely flower; propagation is by division.|$|E

5|$|Henry Blackwell began {{a two-year}} {{courtship}} of Stone {{in the summer}} of 1853. Stone told him she did not wish to marry because {{she did not want to}} surrender control over her life and would not assume the legal position occupied by a married woman. Blackwell maintained that despite the law, couples could create a marriage of equal partnership, governed by their mutual agreement. They could also take steps to protect the wife against unjust laws, such as placing her assets in the hands of a trustee. He also believed that marriage would allow each partner to accomplish more than he or she could alone, and to show how he could help advance Stone’s work, he arranged her highly successful western lecturing tour of 1853. Over an eighteen-month courtship conducted primarily through correspondence, Stone and Blackwell discussed the nature of marriage, actual <b>and</b> <b>ideal,</b> as well as their own natures and suitability for marriage. Stone gradually fell in love and in November 1854 agreed to marry Blackwell.|$|E
5|$|After {{playing in}} two trial matches, Headley was {{selected}} to tour England in 1933 under the continuing captaincy of Jackie Grant. The English press speculated on Headley's {{ability to cope with}} English conditions, while expecting him to perform to a high standard. In the event, Wisden believed he justified the expectations and increased his reputation. In the first match of the tour he scored 52 {{out of a total of}} 129 against Northamptonshire, in difficult batting conditions on a wet pitch. He scored fifties in each of his next three matches before scoring a century against the MCC during his first appearance at Lord's Cricket Ground. In the second innings of this match, a short ball from Bill Bowes struck Headley on the chest, and as a result of this injury he missed three games, but when he returned to the team he scored 129 against Glamorgan and 224 not out against Somerset. A quieter match followed against Middlesex, but Headley reached his second double century of the tour in the match against Derbyshire, which took him past 1,000 runs for the season. Despite Headley's contributions, the West Indians won only one of these matches and subsequently lost the first Test against England by an innings. Headley scored 13 in the West Indies first innings, and his 50 was the highest score when West Indies followed-on. Critics were impressed by Headley's second innings performance, in which he scored his runs out of 64 added while he was batting. Between the first and second Tests, in matches where conditions were difficult for batting <b>and</b> <b>ideal</b> for spin bowlers, Headley scored three fifties and achieved his side's highest score in each of four innings.|$|E
