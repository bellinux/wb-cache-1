5|$|New {{drugs are}} the {{products}} of a long drug development process, {{the first step of}} which is often the discovery of a new enzyme inhibitor. In the past the only way to discover these new inhibitors was by trial and error: screening huge libraries of compounds against a target enzyme and hoping that some useful leads would emerge. This brute force approach is still successful and has even been extended by combinatorial chemistry <b>approaches</b> <b>that</b> quickly produce large numbers of novel compounds and high-throughput screening technology to rapidly screen these huge chemical libraries for useful inhibitors.|$|E
5|$|The {{field of}} {{neuroscience}} encompasses all <b>approaches</b> <b>that</b> {{seek to understand}} the brain {{and the rest of}} the nervous system. Psychology seeks to understand mind and behavior, and neurology is the medical discipline that diagnoses and treats diseases of the nervous system. The brain is also the most important organ studied in psychiatry, the branch of medicine that works to study, prevent, and treat mental disorders. Cognitive science seeks to unify neuroscience and psychology with other fields that concern themselves with the brain, such as computer science (artificial intelligence and similar fields) and philosophy.|$|E
5|$|The plot {{key to the}} {{eventual}} rescue plan undertaken is that a lone JPL astrodynamicist suddenly comes up with an out-of-nowhere idea about using gravity assist to get astronauts back to Mars faster and then has to convince layers of NASA management that this could work. In reality, gravity assist is a well-known practice {{that has been used}} on a number of unmanned planetary exploration missions and served as a backup strategy on manned Apollo missions. It would {{have been one of the}} first <b>approaches</b> <b>that</b> everyone within NASA would have considered.|$|E

5|$|A cancer-stricken Hadden, now in {{residence}} on the Mir space station, reveals to Arroway {{that a second}} machine was secretly made in Japan, and that Arroway {{will be the one}} to go. Outfitted with several recording devices, Arroway enters the machine's pod, which is then dropped into four rapidly spinning rings, causing the pod to apparently travel through a series of wormholes. Arroway sees a radio array-like structure at Vega and signs of an advanced civilization on another planet. She then finds herself on a beach, similar to a childhood picture she drew of Florida, and a figure <b>approaches</b> <b>that</b> becomes her deceased father. Arroway recognizes him as an alien taking her father's form and attempts to ask questions. The alien tells her that the familiar landscape and form were used to make their first contact easier for her and that this journey was just humanity's first step to joining other spacefaring species.|$|E

40|$|When {{trying to}} recover 3 D {{structure}} from a set of images, the most di cult problem is establishing the correspondence between the measurements.

In this {{paper we propose a}} Bayesian <b>approach</b> <b>that</b> avoids the brittleness associated with singling out one &quot; correspondence, and instead consider the distribution over all possible correspondences. We treat both a fully Bayesian <b>approach</b> <b>that</b> yields a posterior distribution, and a MAP <b>approach</b> <b>that</b> makes use of EM to maximize this posterior. We show how Markov chain Monte Carlo methods can be used to implement these techniques in practice, and present experimental results on real data. ...|$|R
