Kouma's four vehicles attacked this structure, and <b>after</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> minute of heavy fire the bridge collapsed, and the ponton boats used to hold the bridge in place were sunk. At 23:00 a small arms fight flared around the left side of A Company north of the tanks.

The Japanese military was expecting an Allied offensive in western New Britain, and was reinforcing the region {{at the time of}} the Allied landing in the Arawe area on 15December 1943. The Allies secured Arawe <b>after</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> month of intermittent fighting with the outnumbered Japanese force.|$|E

5|$|The first dent to morale came <b>after</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> {{week when}} the volunteers were first issued ranks in the Rhodesian Army. In {{the eyes of some}} of the French-speaking soldiers, the ranks {{assigned}} appeared to have been chosen almost at random by their superiors, and did not reflect their actual respective levels of training, ability and experience. Some men who considered themselves to have been overlooked began to have problems with discipline. The brazen attitude of most of the company's soldiers jarred strongly with that of their Rhodesian commanders, who had high standards regarding presentation and dress which many of the Frenchmen had little inclination to meet.|$|E

5|$|The {{second most}} {{prevalent}} hunting strategy observed is hover gleaning, {{in which the}} tit-tyrant flies upwards from its perch and then hovers midair while grabbing prey from the vegetation. A third and less frequently used strategy is flycatching, in which the bird flies away from its shrub to grab prey in midair. Prey can be grabbed either close to the bird's perch or at a short distance, which often requires the bird to pursue its prey. When pairs flycatch cooperatively, one bird quietly lurks within the shrub while the other snatches nearby insects; <b>after</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> dozen attacks, the birds switch positions.|$|E
5|$|After {{the joint}} Nazi-Soviet {{invasion}} of Poland in September 1939, the Soviet Union signed a treaty with Lithuania on 10 October, handed over predominantly Polish and Jewish city of Wilno (renamed Vilna) to Lithuania, {{in exchange for}} military concessions, and subsequently annexed Lithuania in 1940 after an election. The German invasion of the Soviet Union, on 22 June 1941, came {{after a year of}} Soviet occupation which had culminated in mass deportations across the Baltics only a week before the German invasion. The Nazis were welcomed as liberators and received support from Lithuania's irregular militia against retreating Soviet forces. Many Lithuanians believed Germany would allow the re-establishment of the country's independence. In order to appease the Germans, some people expressed significant antisemitic sentiments. Nazi Germany, which had seized the Lithuanian territories {{in the first week of}} the offensive, used this situation to its advantage and indeed in the first days permitted a Lithuanian Provisional Government of the Lithuanian Activist Front to be established. For a brief period it appeared that the Germans were about to grant Lithuania significant autonomy, comparable with that given to Slovak Republic. However, <b>after</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> month, the more independently minded Lithuanian organizations were disbanded around August and September 1941, as the Germans seized more control.|$|E

Deal wanted to continue playing with these musicians, and so within three months she moved to Fear's hometown Los Angeles. Jaimez, Lopez, and Presley joined the Breeders, and Kelley Deal rejoined the group soon <b>after.</b> <b>About</b> <b>a</b> month after Kim Deal's arrival, Jose Medeles replaced Jaimez, who decided he did not have enough time for the Breeders because of his involvement in other musical projects.

5|$|Hinde's first {{employment}} in river transportation {{was as a}} clerk on a boat that operated between St. Louis, Missouri, and St. Paul, Minnesota. <b>After</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> year, he joined the Galena, Dubuque and St. Paul Packet Company, which {{became one of the}} largest transportation companies {{in that part of the}} country. At one point during his employment there, he contracted cholera and almost died. Hinde made rapid advancement and was promoted to the position of captain in his mid-twenties, an unusually young age. In 1862, he went to Louisville, Kentucky, to take command of a steamer running from there to Memphis, Tennessee He returned to St. Louis in 1864 to serve as captain of the steamer Davenport, which ran from St. Louis to St. Paul, before resigning that position to organize a branch of the Halliday Brothers Corporation in Cairo, Illinois, which was engaged in the river transportation and shipping businesses.

Hinde sold his interests in the business shortly after its creation and moved his family to Evansville, Indiana, where he became acquainted with E. S. Babcock and the Reid Brothers.|$|E
5|$|Late that afternoon, <b>after</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> week of dry weather, {{it began}} to rain. As a result, the track became more {{difficult}} and mobility was reduced; the tanks found the track impassable {{and as a consequence}} the advancing Australian infantry lost their direct fire support. Resupply also proved to be a problem for them. The jeeps that had been bringing up supplies could not get forward and there were not enough native porters to meet the demand. As a result, the Australians had to resort to using one of their infantry battalions, the 2/24th, to bring supplies forward from Palanko while the 2/23rd continued the advance on Kuanko. Several isolated pockets of Japanese defenders were located along the track holding and so, while their sister battalion struggled up and down the steep track under the weight of their portage, on 1 December elements of the 2/23rd, leaving their heavy stores and equipment behind, advanced up a steep, muddy slope and set about clearing these positions. The Japanese resistance was overwhelmed and by midday the Australians entered Kuanko. Exploiting beyond the village in the afternoon, the lead Australian company took fire from a ridge line to the north-west and the advance was halted for the day.|$|E
5|$|Silver's break came in 1950, {{when his}} trio backed saxophonist Stan Getz {{at a club}} in Hartford: Getz liked Silver's band and {{recruited}} them to tour with him. The saxophonist also gave Silver his recording debut, in December 1950, for the Stan Getz Quartet album. <b>After</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> year, Silver was replaced as pianist in Getz's band and he moved to New York City. There, working as a freelance, he quickly built a reputation, based on his compositions and bluesy playing. He worked for short periods with tenor saxophonists Young and Coleman Hawkins, before meeting altoist Lou Donaldson, with whom he developed his bebop understanding. Donaldson made his first recording on Blue Note Records in 1952, with Silver on piano, Gene Ramey on bass and Art Taylor on drums. Later that year, another Blue Note quartet session was booked for Donaldson, with Art Blakey replacing Taylor, but the saxophonist withdrew and producer–owner Alfred Lion offered Silver the studio time for a trio recording. Most of the tracks recorded at it were Silver originals, {{and he went on}} to stay with Blue Note as a leader for the following 28 years.|$|E

5|$|The {{eggs are}} oval, white and {{coarsely}} textured. All species normally lay {{at least two}} eggs; the usual clutch size is one to three, rarely up to six. Both sexes incubate with the eggs on top of or below the feet; they may display when changing shifts. Incubation takes 30–36 days; hatching success for undisturbed pairs can {{be as high as}} 95 percent but, because of sibling competition or siblicide, in the wild usually all but one nestling dies within the first few weeks (later in the pink-backed and spot-billed species). Both parents feed their young. Small chicks are fed by regurgitation; <b>after</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> week they are able to put their heads into their parent’s pouch and feed themselves.
