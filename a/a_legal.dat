If such a species were not to be treated as <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> animal, there would arise the challenge of defining the boundary between <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> person and <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> animal, considering the numerous factors that constitute intelligence.|$|E

40|$|This Article {{seeks to}} {{elucidate}} the confusion between sexuality and violence that confounds legal treatments of intra-lesbian violence. This confusion is both explicitly and implicitly revealed in judicial decisions and legislative enactments. A distinct but intertwined task of this Article is to situate intra-lesbian violence within {{the development of}} <b>a</b> lesbian <b>legal</b> theory. It is intra-lesbian violence that makes equally untenable either <b>a</b> separatist lesbian <b>legal</b> theory (eschewing all reference to <b>a</b> patriarchal <b>legal</b> system) or <b>an</b> assimilationist lesbian <b>legal</b> theory (advocating lesbianism as an irrelevant factor in legal determinations) ...|$|R
40|$|It is {{commonly}} agreed that {{international criminal law}} (ICL) is <b>a</b> ‘hybrid’ <b>legal</b> culture, which mixes the legal traditions of the common law and civil law. However, the precise nature of this <b>legal</b> culture remains <b>a</b> contentious <b>legal</b> and theoretical issue. The paper identifies the two dominant models of ICL within these debates as either a clash of cultures or a sui generis system, and shows how neither satisfactorily engages {{with the concept of}} legal culture itself. To address this problem, the paper develops a new account of ICL as <b>a</b> global <b>legal</b> culture. The paper first identifies the distinctive ‘cultural logic’ of ICL, drawing on the example of recent developments in sexual violence offences. It then examines how ICL takes <b>a</b> global <b>legal</b> form, which ‘globalizes’ liberal legal culture. Finally, the paper shows how this process of making the legal culture of ICL ‘global’ creates its cultural contradictions, but also enables the possibility of making <b>a</b> new <b>legal</b> culture at the international level...|$|R
