A Motorola 6809 {{central processing unit}} handles the graphics and gameplay, while a Motorola 6800 microprocessor handles the audio. A pack of three <b>AA</b> <b>batteries</b> provide power to save the game's settings and high scores when the machine is unplugged from an electrical outlet.

5|$|By the Korean War, {{jet engines}} had {{replaced}} propellers on aircraft, which severely limited {{the ability of}} the 20 mm and 40 mm <b>AA</b> <b>batteries</b> and their gun systems to track and shoot down enemy planes. Consequently, the AA guns and their associated fire-control systems were removed when reactivated. New Jersey received this treatment in 1967, and the others followed in their 1980s modernizations. In the 1980s, each ship also received a quartet of Phalanx Close in Weapon System (CIWS) mounts which made use of a radar system to locate incoming enemy projectiles and destroy them with a 20mm Gatling gun before they could strike the ship.|$|E
5|$|Joust was {{developed}} by Williams Electronics, with John Newcomer as the lead designer. Programmer Bill Pfutzenrueter and artists Jan Hendricks and Python Anghelo assisted him. Tim Murphy and John Kotlarik handled the audio design. The game features amplified monaural sound and raster graphics on a 19-inch color CRT monitor. Like other Williams arcade games, Joust was programmed in assembly language. A pack of three <b>AA</b> <b>batteries</b> provide power to save the game's settings and high scores when the machine is unplugged from an electrical outlet. The cabinet artwork, by Anghelo, is stenciled on a wooden frame. Anghelo also designed artwork for promotional materials; one such flyer featured archaic English, which was also incorporated into the game's onscreen instructions and game-over message.|$|E

5|$|The {{ships were}} turned into {{floating}} <b>AA</b> <b>batteries</b> {{over the next}} several months although it availed them little when they were attacked again by American carrier aircraft in July. On the 24th Ise was struck by five bombs and near missed multiple times; all told she lost 50 crewmen killed and many others wounded. The bombs started numerous leaks and Ise began to settle by the bow, although she was returned to an even keel after three days pumping. Hyūga was a primary focus of the attack and she received 10 direct hits and up to 30 near misses. She was badly damaged with some 200-odd crewmen killed and 600 wounded during the attack. She slowly foundered over the next two days and was not attacked when the Americans returned four days later. This time it was Ises turn and she was struck 11 or more times with many near misses that put her on the bottom in shallow water with a 15 degree list. The sisters were struck off the Navy List in November and their wrecks were scrapped after the war.|$|E

25|$|In 2002, Nintendo {{introduced}} the WaveBird Wireless Controller, the first wireless gamepad {{developed by a}} first-party console manufacturer. The RF-based wireless controller is similar in design to the standard controller. It communicates with the GameCube {{by way of a}} wireless receiver dongle connected to one of the console's controller ports. Powered by two <b>AA</b> <b>batteries,</b> which are housed in a compartment {{on the underside of the}} controller, the WaveBird lacks the vibration functionality of the standard controller. In addition to the standard inputs, the WaveBird features a channel selection dial – also found on the receiver – and an on/off switch. An orange LED on the face of the controller indicates when it is powered on. The controller is available in light grey and platinum color schemes.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, Wang {{released}} the slimline Alliance 750CD 80486 based PC in the United Kingdom. These machines used standard PC/AT keyboards and were entirely IBM compatible, shipping with MSDOS 5.0 and Windows 3.11 as standard. The only unusual feature was that system BIOS settings and the real-time clock were maintained by four standard <b>AA</b> <b>batteries</b> {{as opposed to}} a more typical solutionsuch as a specialty battery pack or lithium battery. While originally offered with a 33MHz 80486DX, the 750CD could be upgraded to later Socket 3 processors such as the 80486DX2 through the use of third party CPU upgrade adapters or interposers. This allowed upgrading to speeds beyond 50MHz without overclocking, or alternatively the potential for speeds in excess of 100MHz with overclocking, dependent on the processor used.|$|E
25|$|The BEF {{began its}} planned {{advanced}} into Belgium, but the German Army {{broke through the}} Ardennes, forcing the BEF to withdraw again, the <b>AA</b> <b>batteries</b> giving cover leap-frog fashion. Soon they were sucked into the ground battle, split into sub-units to join rearguard actions or moved back from one key point to another, with all the roads choked with refugees. By 21 May, 151st Bty had A Trp defending Hazebrouck, where an enemy aircraft was brought down, while B Trp was at Merville. Next, A Trp went to the defence of Cassel, where it was attacked by tanks and aircraft. One gun was hit and one had to be abandoned. Second Lieutenant Forbes went out to find the remaining two guns but was never heard of again. Sergeant Lord and 22 men eventually got out at Dunkirk.|$|E

25|$|The first single-station smoke {{detector}} {{was invented in}} 1970 and made public the next year. It was an ionization detector powered by a single 9-volt battery. They cost about US$125 and sold {{at a rate of}} a few hundred thousand per year. Several technological developments occurred between 1971 and 1976, including the replacement of cold-cathode tubes with solid-state electronics, which greatly reduced the detectors' sizes and made it possible to monitor battery life. The previous alarm horns, which required specialty batteries, were replaced with horns that were more energy-efficient, enabling the use of commonly available sizes of batteries. These detectors could also function with smaller amounts of radioactive source material, and the sensing chamber and {{smoke detector}} enclosure were redesigned for more effective operation. The rechargeable batteries were often replaced by a pair of <b>AA</b> <b>batteries</b> along with a plastic shell encasing the detector. The 10-year-lithium-battery-powered smoke alarm was introduced in 1995.|$|E
25|$|A {{charging}} grip {{is available}} for the Joy-Con, which provides a means to attach a USB-C cable for power. Alongside that, Nintendo released a charging strap that allows players to charge an individual Joy-Con via embedded <b>AA</b> <b>batteries.</b> Nintendo offers a Joy-Con Wheel, a small steering wheel-like unit that a Joy-Con can slot into, allowing it {{to be used for}} racing games like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. The Switch supports the wireless Pro Controller, which has a more traditional design reminiscent of the Wii Classic Controller Pro and Wii U Pro Controller. As of Switch System Software 3.0.0 a setting can be turned on to use the controller in wired USB mode, however currently this will disable the NFC touchpoint. Standalone Docks are available, which include the power adapter and HDMI cable. Third parties also support the Switch with additional accessories, such as carrying cases and screen protectors. The 4.0.0 system update enabled support for GameCube controllers attached via USB with the Wii U GameCube adapter.|$|E
