50|$|University {{art museums}} and {{galleries}} differ from traditional art museums and commercial galleries {{due to their}} relationship with {{institutions of higher education}} where <b>academic</b> <b>freedoms</b> are ideally upheld. With the protection of <b>academic</b> <b>freedoms,</b> topics that would otherwise be avoided, ignored, or censored can be openly explored. The two main <b>academic</b> <b>freedoms</b> are: the freedom of the student to study whatever they want, and the freedom of the teacher to teach whatever they want. When these two freedoms are observed, {{in the context of a}} university art museum and/or gallery, a unique setting for academic discovery is opened up. University art museums and exhibits are sometimes sources of controversies regarding issues of propriety, politics, gender, and sexuality.|$|R
40|$|There {{was made}} a {{comparative}} analysis of the views on autonomy of universities of the domestic professors of the XIX – early XX centuries in the article. The support of the professors of autonomy and <b>academic</b> <b>freedoms</b> {{as a consequence of}} the contradictions that arose between the needs of higher education and the existing university management system has been proved. The views of individual professors (V. Vernadskyi, A. Famintsyn, E. Trubetskoi, K. Timiriaizev, D. Samokvasov, P. Vynogradov, F. Zelinskyi, etc.) on the autonomy of a higher educational institution in solving many issues of internal regulation are considered. The main ideas of documents in which the professors stand for autonomy and <b>academic</b> <b>freedoms</b> are highlighted. It was substantiated that liberal teachers were concerned about the situation of students at universities, offered to reorganize the activities of educational institutions on the principles of autonomy and <b>academic</b> <b>freedoms,</b> advocated the collegiality of the professorial corporation, and the powers of the trustee of the educational district; conservative perceived only the educational function of the university, and the teacher was only an official who lectured and took exams...|$|R
