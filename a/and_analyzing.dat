5|$|JMP {{software}} is partly focused on exploratory data analysis and visualization. It {{is designed for}} users to investigate data to learn something unexpected, as opposed to confirming a hypothesis. JMP links statistical data to graphics representing them, so users can drill down or up to explore the data and various visual representations of it. Its primary applications are for designed experiments <b>and</b> <b>analyzing</b> statistical data from industrial processes.|$|E

5|$|Various {{protocols}} {{have been}} drawn up detailing {{a course of action}} for scientists and governments after extraterrestrial contact. Post-detection protocols must address three issues: what to do in the first weeks after receiving a message from an extraterrestrial source; whether or not to send a reply; <b>and</b> <b>analyzing</b> the long-term consequences of the message received. No post-detection protocol, however, is binding under national or international law, and Dominik and Zarnecki consider the protocols likely to be ignored if contact occurs.|$|E
5|$|Rockstar {{improved}} their proprietary Rockstar Advanced Game Engine (RAGE) {{to increase its}} animation and draw distance rendering capabilities. The game uses the Euphoria and Bullet engines for further animation and environment rendering tasks. The developers felt inspired to create the game after realising the potential power of both the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, having exhausted the use of older hardware on previous projects. The development team conducted extensive research, visiting historical American landmarks <b>and</b> <b>analyzing</b> classic Western films, to achieve realism while creating the game. The game's open world, set in New Austin, Nuevo Paraíso and West Elizabeth, represents iconic features of the American frontier, in which the game is set.|$|E
5|$|The seven-minute long video depicts Beyoncé {{playing a}} beauty pageant contest {{representing}} Third Ward, Houston, {{the area in}} which she grew up. It opens with the sound of a poignant piano and shots of Beyoncé sporting short hair, looking at herself in the mirror. It transitions to a segment of her fellow contestants preparing for the pageant backstage, combing their hair, fitting their dresses <b>and</b> <b>analyzing</b> their bodies; one scene during the preparations shows Beyoncé arguing with another contestant over a hair dryer. Multiple shots of the singer follow, of which depict her sitting on a floor and leaving a bathroom after vomiting. The clip then sees contestants looking tired and distressed backstage.|$|E

5|$|A {{lingering}} controversy {{exists in}} ichthyology over {{the validity of}} the four species Beebe described on the basis of visual descriptions only, which he had observed during his Bathysphere dives. The naming of a new species ordinarily requires obtaining <b>and</b> <b>analyzing</b> a type specimen, something which was obviously impossible from inside the Bathysphere. Some of Beebe's critics claimed that these fish were illusions resulting from condensation on the Bathysphere's window, or even that Beebe willfully made them up, although the latter would have been strongly at odds with Beebe's reputation as an honest and rigorous scientist. While many of Beebe's observations from the Bathysphere have since been confirmed by advances in undersea photography, it is unclear whether others fit the description of any known sea animal. One possibility is that although these animals indeed exist, so much remains to be discovered about life in the deep ocean that these animals have yet to be seen by anyone other than him.|$|E
5|$|The War for Late Night {{chronicles the}} 2010 {{conflict}} surrounding the American late-night talk show The Tonight Show involving Conan O'Brien and Jay Leno. Carter gives biographical description of other late-night television personalities, including David Letterman, Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, Craig Ferguson, Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert. As host of Late Night with Conan O'Brien, O'Brien decided {{to remain with}} NBC after attempts by ABC and Fox to attract him to their networksas NBC executives had told O'Brien that he would become host of The Tonight Show after Leno's retirement. While hosting The Tonight Show <b>and</b> <b>analyzing</b> ratings results, O'Brien told his manager Gavin Polone that he feared that Leno might be {{moved back to the}} program. Carter's book contains details of O'Brien's and Leno's contracts, and describes O'Brien's emotional state during the 2010 conflict. According to Carter, Leno had an advantage during negotiations because of a stronger contract agreement with NBC, which gave Leno the option to sue NBC if his program was canceled.|$|E
