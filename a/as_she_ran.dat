5|$|The Chesapeake–Leopard Affair, {{and later}} the Little Belt Affair, contributed to the United States' {{decision}} to declare war on Britain on 18June 1812. Chesapeake, {{under the command of}} Captain Samuel Evans, was prepared for duty in the Atlantic. Beginning on 13December, she ranged from Madeira and traveled clockwise to the Cape Verde Islands and South America, and then back to Boston. She captured six ships as prizes: the British ships Volunteer, LiverpoolHero, Earl Percy, and Ellen; the brig Julia, an American ship trading under a British license; and Valeria, an American ship recaptured from British privateers. During the cruise she was chased by an unknown British ship-of-the-line and frigate but, after a passing storm squall, the two pursuing ships were gone the next morning. The cargo of Volunteer, 40tons of pig iron and copper, were sold for $185,000. Earl Percy never made it back to port <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> aground off the coast of Long Island, and LiverpoolHero was burned as she was considered leaky. Chesapeakes total monetary damage to British shipping was $235,675. She returned to Boston on 9April 1813 for refitting.|$|E

25|$|Gray started {{shooting}} indiscriminately, targeting a utility vehicle full of locals {{who had seen}} the Holden house burning and stopped to help. He first shot Vanessa Percy {{several times in the}} back <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> down the street in terror; she died a few hours later at the scene. He then turned to the three children. He killed the two boys, Leo Wilson and Dion Percy. The boys' sister, Stacey, was critically injured by a bullet to her abdomen, but survived. Ross Percy, the children's father, who had been driving them home after a day fishing when they saw the fire, was fatally shot in the head. Next, Aleki Tali was killed. Gray then entered the home of Tim Jamieson, killing him and another elderly local, former Green Island mayor Vic Crimp. The next victim was James Dickson, who was looking for his dog. Eva Helen Dickson, James' mother, and neighbour Chris Cole went into the road to see what the noise was. Gray shot at both of them, wounding Cole who was in a phone booth calling the police and forcing Mrs Dickson to dive for cover. Mrs Dickson, who had recently had a hip replacement and was unable to walk without assistance, pulled herself along on her stomach using her arms and feet in a ditch to get inside and called 1-1-1 (emergency telephone number). She then crawled back to Cole to tell him help was coming. By this stage, it was getting dark and the dispatcher advised her to stay inside. Mrs Dickson later received the George Medal for bravery. Help arrived too late for Cole, who died in the hospital.|$|E
500|$|While most of {{the other}} songs on the Spice album {{required}} two or three days of studio time, [...] "Wannabe" [...] was recorded in less than an hour. The solo parts were divided between Brown, Bunton, Chisholm, and Halliwell. Victoria Adams missed {{most of the}} writing session and communicated {{with the rest of the}} group on a mobile phone. In her autobiography, she wrote: [...] "I just couldn't bear not being there. Because whatever they said about how it didn't matter, it did matter. Saying 'Yes, I like that' or 'Not sure about that' down the phone is not the same." [...] She contributed backing vocals and sings during the chorus. Rowe stayed up all night working on the song, and it was finished by morning, the only later addition was the sound of Brown's footsteps <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> to the microphone.|$|E
500|$|Barney {{was born}} in 1876 in Dayton, Ohio, to Albert Clifford Barney and Alice Pike Barney. Her mother was of French, Dutch and German ancestry and her father {{was the son of}} a wealthy {{manufacturer}} of railway cars and of English descent. Her maternal grandfather's father was Jewish. When Barney was five years old her family spent the summer at New York's Long Beach Hotel where Oscar Wilde happened to be speaking on his American lecture tour. [...] Wilde scooped her up <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> past him fleeing a group of small boys, held her out of their reach then sat her down on his knee and told her a story. The next day he joined Barney and her mother on the beach, where their conversation changed the course of Alice's life, inspiring her to pursue art seriously, despite, years later, her husband's disapproval. She later studied under Carolus-Duran and James McNeill Whistler. Many of Alice Pike Barney's paintings are now in the Smithsonian American Art Museum.|$|E

500|$|These {{ships were}} {{primarily}} designed for service in Southeast Asian waters, including the rivers, {{and most of}} the ships spent at least one commission there. Hornet, Midge, and Gnat spent their whole careers there. Gnats service, however, was rather short <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> aground and was wrecked on Balabac Island, south of the Philippines, {{less than a year after}} she was commissioned. Their duties included protecting British lives and property and fighting pirates. Another major deployment area was the Gulf of Guinea in West Africa where Fly, Lynx, Flirt, Dwarf, Beacon, Avon, Pert, Growler, Rocket, Hart, and Boxer all spent part of one or more commissions. Beacon supported British coastal operations during the Third Anglo-Ashanti War in 1873 while most of the others engaged river pirates at various times. Rocket, Elk, Dwarf, Beacon, and Avon served at least one commission off the south-east coast of South America, while Cracker spent her entire career there. Dwarf made a port visit to Asunción, on the Paraguay River, some [...] from the ocean during one of her tours in the region. Teazer, Lynx, Beacon, and Thistle each made one deployment to the East Indies Station where they helped to suppress the slave trade between East Africa and the Persian Gulf. Beacon, Hart, and Growler were deployed to the Mediterranean where the former participated in the Bombardment of Alexandria in 1882. Fly, Flirt, Boxer, and Pert each spent a commission on fishery patrol on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. Boxer was also deployed to British Columbia to maintain order with the Indian tribes there.|$|E

By this point, they had run approximately [...] {{from the car}} park. Bryant opened his door and slowed down. Mikac moved towards the car, apparently thinking he was offering them help in escaping. Several more people witnessed this from further down the road. Someone recognised him as the gunman and yelled out [...] "It's him!" [...] Bryant {{stepped out of the}} car, put his hand on Nanette Mikac's shoulder and told her to get on her knees. She did so, saying, [...] "Please don't hurt my babies". Bryant shot her in the temple, killing her. Next, he fired a shot at Madeline, which hit her in the shoulder, then shot her fatally through the chest.

2500|$|King, {{who also}} {{competed in the}} Virginia Slims of Houston during the same week, won in {{straight}} sets, 6–4, 6–3, 6–3. In the first set, she fell behind 3–2 when Riggs broke her serve. [...] In a 2015 interview, she said {{that most people do}} not remember that she was initially behind in the first set, and it looked bad for her in the early going. At this point, King realized that she [...] "had to win" [...] given the importance of the match, and broke right back and again in the tenth game to close out the set. She had learned from Court's loss and was ready for Riggs' game. Rather than playing her own usual aggressive game, King mostly stayed at the baseline, easily handling Riggs's lobs and soft shots, making him cover the entire court <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> him from side to side and beat him at his own defensive style of play. After quickly failing from the baseline, where he had intended to play, Riggs dropped his comedic effect and showed a more serious demeanor, as he was forced to change to a serve-and-volley game.|$|E

The assailant ordered her to get up, and, when she did, he told her to run. <b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> towards a ditch, the assailant told her not to go that way but to run up the road. She stated that while she was running, she heard Hollis groaning, and that the man {{continued}} to beat and stomp him. She was having trouble running in her high heels when the assailant ran after her. She saw an older car parked further up the street facing their vehicle. She quickly looked inside to see if anyone could help her, but after seeing no one, she began to run and was overtaken by the attacker. The man asked her why she was running. She told him he told her to run. Larey said, [...] "He called me a liar again and then I knew {{that he was going to}} kill me." [...] He knocked her down and assaulted her sexually. Larey stated he did not rape her but abused her terribly. Later reports indicated that the assailant sexually assaulted her with the barrel of his gun.|$|E
