25|$|Table Mountain is {{also home}} to porcupines, mongooses, snakes, lizards, tortoises, and a rare endemic species of {{amphibian}} that is only found on Table Mountain, the Table Mountain ghost frog. The last lion in the area was shot circa 1802. Leopards persisted on the mountains until perhaps the 1920s but are now extinct locally. Two smaller, secretive, nocturnal carnivores, the rooikat (caracal) and the vaalboskat (also called the vaalkat or Southern African wildcat) were once common in the mountains and the mountain slopes. The rooikat continues to be seen on rare occasions by mountaineers but the status of the vaalboskat is uncertain. The mountain cliffs are home to several raptors species, apart from the Verreaux's eagle. They include the jackal buzzard, booted eagle (in summer), <b>African</b> <b>harrier-hawk,</b> peregrine falcon and the rock kestrel. In 2014 three pairs of African fish eagles were believed to be breeding on the Peninsula, but they nest in trees generally as far away from human habitation as is possible on the Peninsula. Their number in 2017 is unknown.|$|E

50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>harrier-hawk</b> can {{be found}} in natural woodland, tree {{plantations}} and urban areas.|$|E
25|$|Predators include humans, hawks, weasels, raccoons, foxes, {{domestic}} and feral cats, snakes, owls, and dogs. In its introduced range in South Africa, {{it has been}} preyed on by <b>African</b> <b>harrier-hawks.</b>|$|R
50|$|These hawks often forage by {{scanning}} from a perch or on {{the wing}} and swooping down to grab prey. However, they are notable for having “double-jointed” tarsal bones, allowing them to reach into tree cavities and extract prey, a trait they share only with the genus of <b>African</b> <b>harrier-hawks</b> Polyboroids. Their main prey are small vertebrates, especially rodents, bats, lizards, snakes, and small birds, but they have also been known to eat larger insects and other arthropods and snails.|$|R

50|$|The Madagascar harrier-hawk forms a {{superspecies}} {{with the}} <b>African</b> <b>harrier-hawk</b> {{and has been}} regarded by some authorities as a subspecies of that species. However, {{if that is the}} case then the combined species would be called P. radiata as this name has priority.|$|E
50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>harrier-hawk,</b> harrier hawk, or gymnogene (Polyboroides typus) is a bird of prey. It {{is about}} 60-66 cm in length, and {{is related to}} the harriers. It breeds in most of Africa south of the Sahara. The only other member of the genus is the {{allopatric}} Madagascan harrier-hawk (Polyboroides radiatus).|$|E
50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>harrier-hawk</b> is omnivorous, {{eating the}} fruit of the oil palm as well as hunting small vertebrates. Its ability to climb, using wings as well as feet, and its long double-jointed legs, enable this bird to raid the nests of cavity-nesters such as barbets and woodhoopoes for fledglings. It has been known to prey on {{introduced}} species such as feral pigeons, house sparrows and eastern gray squirrels.|$|E
50|$|The Madagascar harrier-hawk has {{a varied}} diet {{and has been}} {{recorded}} eating small birds, rodents, reptiles, insects, small lemurs. Like the <b>African</b> <b>harrier-hawk</b> they possess the unusual morphological adaptation of having an intertarsal joint that allows their legs to flex backwards and forwards. This means {{that they can use}} their feet to probe and remove prey from hidden sites such as holes in tree trunks, weaver nests and rock crevices where they can extract nestling birds from such normally inaccessible places.|$|E
50|$|The {{subfamily}} Circinae {{has traditionally}} included the genera Polyboroides and Geranospiza which include three species - the Madagascar harrier-hawk, (Polyboroides radiatus), the <b>African</b> <b>harrier-hawk,</b> (Polyboroides typus) and the crane hawk, (Geranospiza caerulescens). This may however {{not be a}} valid subfamily as the monophyletic genus Circus is nested within the Accipiter groups while the other two genera are non-monophyletic and {{are part of the}} larger Buteonine clade. Many species in the genus Circus show very low diversity in their mitochondrial DNA due perhaps due to extreme drops in their populations. They are prone to fluctuations with varying prey densities.|$|E
50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>harrier-hawk</b> is a {{medium-sized}} raptor. The upperparts, head and breast are pale grey. The belly is white with fine dark barring. The broad wings are pale grey {{with a black}} trailing edge fringed with a narrow white line. The tail is black with a single broad white band. There is a bare facial patch of variable colour, usually red or yellow. Genders are similar, but young birds have pale brown instead of grey, and dark brown replacing black. An unusual trait of this species is the double-jointed knees it possesses, which enable it to reach into otherwise inaccessible holes and cracks for prey. A comparable leg-structure and behavior {{can be found in}} the Neotropical crane hawk; a case of convergent evolution.|$|E

50|$|Broadcast 11 November 1998, {{this episode}} {{examines}} those birds whose sustenance comes from flesh and their methods of hunting. In New Zealand, Attenborough observes keas, parrots {{that do not}} eat meat exclusively, raiding a shearwater's burrow for a chick. However, it is the dedicated birds of prey, such as owls, buzzards, eagles, falcons and vultures, to which much of the programme is devoted. In order to spot and pursue their victims, senses of sight and hearing are very acute. Vultures are the exception, in that they eat what others have left, and once a carcass is found, so many birds descend on it that the carrion seems submerged beneath them. The turkey vulture is an anomaly within its group, as {{it also has a}} keen sense of smell. Eagles defend their territory vigorously, and a pair of sea eagles are shown engaging in an aerial battle. The Galápagos hawk hunts marine iguanas, but can only do so when its quarry is vulnerable, during the breeding season. The <b>African</b> <b>harrier-hawk</b> has adapted to extracting burrowing animals by virtue of an especially long, double-jointed pair of legs. By contrast, a shrike is not equipped with the requisite sharp beak and talons needed for butchery, and so dismembers its kill by impaling it on the thorns of acacias. The lammergeier eats bones, and will drop them on to rocks from a great height in order to break them down to a digestible size. Also featured are the Eurasian sparrowhawk, goshawk and peregrine falcon.|$|E
50|$|Outside of the Bubo genus, other owls in Africa {{are much}} smaller than Verreaux's eagle-owls {{and are more likely}} to be viewed as prey than competition. Among the small-to-mid-sized owls that have fallen prey to this species {{including}} the barn owl (Tyto alba) and the African grass owl (Tyto capensis), both of which average around 419 g in body mass in Africa, the 334 g marsh owl (Asio capensis) and the 216 g southern white-faced owl (Ptilopsis granti). The only verified interactions with other typical eagle-owls have been predatory, as the 645 g spotted eagle-owl has been recorded among their prey in a few cases. There are several owls was broadly similar habitat preferences from African scops owls (Otus senegalensis) to African wood owls (Strix woodfordii) that have not been reported as food but are almost certainly occasionally threatened by Verreaux's eagle-owls. As is commonly the case with eagle-owls, the Verreaux's eagle-owl is perhaps the most serious predatory threat to diurnal raptors in its range, most often ambushing raptors on their prominent nests upon nightfall and freely killing birds of prey of any age from nestlings to adults. Such prey is not quantitatively significant as a food source but since raptors as a rule are sparsely distributed the habitual visitation of a single or pair of Verreaux's eagle-owl can potentially be devastating to a local population. Among the species known to be attacked have included, among small-to-medium-sized raptors, include the 638 g <b>African</b> <b>harrier-hawk</b> (Polyboroides typus), the 675 g pale chanting goshawk (Melierax canorus), the 507 g African marsh harrier (Circus ranivorus), the 110 g scissor-tailed kite (Chelictinia riocourii), the 291.5 g African goshawk (Accipiter tachiro) the 875 g common buzzard (Buteo buteo) and the 640 g Wahlberg's eagle (Hieraaetus wahlbergi).|$|E
