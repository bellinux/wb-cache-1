Director Yoshirou Kimura started work on the project as he helped his colleagues at Love-de-Lic finish that company's final game, [...] Production of Chulip began in the earliest days of the PS2, making it a challenge for the development team who only had experience with the original PlayStation. Kimura valued his team members' opinions and ideas while working on it. [...] "It was challenging and interesting at the same time to program a game for a new console," [...] he stated. [...] "We were definitely eager to see what we could do with it." [...] The original idea for Chulip came when Kimura visited Western countries and saw couples kissing in public, a custom not often performed among Japanese people. Kimura came up with game's title after attending a party in Tokyo. As the intoxicated partygoers talked about video games, they began to humorously say [...] "chu-shite" [...] (lit. [...] "kiss me"). The title Chulip is a play on words: a cross between chu (the Japanese onomatopoeia for the sound of <b>a</b> <b>kiss)</b> <b>and</b> the English word lip, as well as the Japanese rendering of the word tulip.|$|E
