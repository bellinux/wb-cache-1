5|$|The {{population}} is heterogeneous. Israeli Jews comprise some 82% of the population, almost 14% are Christians (the {{majority of whom}} are Arab Christians) and, some 4% are Muslims (of which many are Ahmadis). Haifa also includes Druze and Bahá'í communities. In 2006, 27% of the <b>Arab</b> <b>population</b> was aged 14 and under, compared to 17% of the Jewish and other population groups. The trend continues in the age 15-29 group, in which 27% of the <b>Arab</b> <b>population</b> is found, and the age 30-44 group (23%). The population of Jews and others in these age groups are 22% and 18% respectively. Nineteen percent of the city's Jewish and other {{population is}} between 45 and 59, compared to 14% of the <b>Arab</b> <b>population.</b> This continues with 14% of Jews and others aged 60–74 and 10% over age 75, in comparison to 7% and just 2% respectively in the <b>Arab</b> <b>population.</b>|$|E
5|$|British {{forces in}} Haifa redeployed on 21 April 1948, {{withdrawing}} {{from most of}} the city while still maintaining control over the port facilities. Two days later the downtown, controlled by a combination of local and foreign (ALA) Arab irregulars was assaulted by Jewish forces in Operation Bi'ur Hametz, by the Carmeli Brigade of the Haganah, commanded by Moshe Carmel. The operation led to a massive displacement of Haifa's <b>Arab</b> <b>population.</b> According to The Economist at the time, only 5,000–6,000 of the city's 62,000 Arabs remained there by 2 October 1948.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its image}} as a port and {{industrial}} city, Haifa is the cultural hub of northern Israel. During the 1950s, mayor Abba Hushi made a special effort to encourage authors and poets {{to move to the}} city, and founded the Haifa Theatre, a repertory theater, the first municipal theater founded in the country. The principal Arabic theater servicing the northern <b>Arab</b> <b>population</b> is the al-Midan Theater. Other theaters in the city include the Krieger Centre for the Performing Arts and the Rappaport Art and Culture Center. The Congress Center hosts exhibitions, concerts and special events.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene {{in humans}} has an insertion-deletion (I/D) {{polymorphic}} state in intron 16 on chromosome 17 q 23. This polymorphism {{has been widely}} investigated in different populations due to its association with the renin-angiotensin system. However, similar studies for <b>Arab</b> <b>populations</b> are limited. This study addresses {{the distribution of the}} ACE gene polymorphism in three <b>Arab</b> <b>populations</b> (Egyptians, Jordanians and Syrians). Findings The polymorphisms of ACE gene were investigated using polymerase chain reaction for detection of an I/D mutation. The results showed a high frequency of the ACE D allele among the three <b>Arab</b> <b>populations,</b> Egyptians (0. 67), Jordanians (0. 66) and Syrians (0. 60), which is similar to those obtained from previous studies for <b>Arab</b> <b>populations.</b> Conclusion The relationship between ACE alleles and disease in these three <b>Arab</b> <b>populations</b> is still not known, but the present results clearly suggest that geographic origin should be carefully considered in the increasing number of studies on the association between ACE alleles and disease etiology. This study adds to the data showing the wide variation in the distribution of the ACE alleles in different populations and highlights that great care needs to be taken when interpreting clinical data on the association of the ACE alleles with different diseases. </p...|$|R

5|$|In {{the middle}} of May, the {{situation}} for the 50,000 Arab inhabitants {{of the city and}} the 30,000–40,000 in the outlying neighbourhoods was no better. After the massacre at Deir Yassin and the Jewish offensive of April that triggered the large-scale exodus of the Palestinian Arabs in other mixed cities, the <b>Arab</b> <b>population</b> of Jerusalem was frightened and feared for its fate. With the departure of the British on 14 May, the Haganah launched several operations to take control {{of the city and the}} local Arab leadership requested King Abdullah of Jordan to deploy his army to come to their aid.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Palestinian historiography and {{collective}} memory {{point out that}} during the exodus of Palestinian <b>Arab</b> <b>population</b> of the 1948 War the massacres and forced expulsions that happened {{could be seen as}} ethnic cleansing. In the Latrun zone, this affected about 20 villages and ten thousand Palestinian Arabs. Some inhabitants fled during the fights of April but most fled when the Israelis attacked their village during the following operations. After capturing a village, the Israeli soldiers systematically expelled the non-combatants, intimidating them to leave and demolishing houses. A massacre of between thirty and seventy Arabs took place some days after Abu Shusha was taken. Most villages were levelled, {{so as not to be}} used by the Arab volunteers and to prevent the inhabitants returning. In some cases Jewish settlements were established on village land.|$|E
5|$|Under the British Mandate, Haifa {{became an}} {{industrial}} port city. The Bahá'í Faith in 1918 and today has its administrative and spiritual centre in the environs of Haifa. Many Jewish immigrants of the Fourth Aliyah and Fifth Aliyah settled in Haifa. The port {{was a major}} source of income, and the nearby towns of the Krayot were established in the 1930s. At the same time, the <b>Arab</b> <b>population</b> also swelled by an influx of migrants, coming mainly from surrounding villages as well as Syrian Hauran. The Arab immigration mainly came as a result of prices and salary drop. Between the censuses of 1922 and 1931, the Muslim, Jewish, and Christian populations rose by 217%, 256%, and 156%, respectively. According to a census conducted in 1922 by the British Mandate authorities, Haifa had a population of 24,634, consisting of 9,377 Muslims, 6,230 Jews and 8,863 Christians. In 1938, 52,000 Jews and 51,000 Muslims and Christians lived in Haifa.|$|E

5|$|In 1922, Egypt, {{which had}} been {{declared}} a British protectorate at {{the outbreak of the}} First World War, was granted formal independence, though it continued to be a British client state until 1954. British troops remained stationed in Egypt until the signing of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty in 1936, under which it was agreed that the troops would withdraw but continue to occupy and defend the Suez Canal zone. In return, Egypt was assisted in joining the League of Nations. Iraq, a British mandate since 1920, also gained membership of the League in its own right after achieving independence from Britain in 1932. In Palestine, Britain was presented with the problem of mediating between the Arabs and increasing numbers of Jews. The 1917 Balfour Declaration, {{which had been}} incorporated into the terms of the mandate, stated that a national home for the Jewish people would be established in Palestine, and Jewish immigration allowed up to a limit that would be determined by the mandatory power. This led to increasing conflict with the <b>Arab</b> <b>population,</b> who openly revolted in 1936. As the threat of war with Germany increased during the 1930s, Britain judged the support of Arabs as more important than the establishment of a Jewish homeland, and shifted to a pro-Arab stance, limiting Jewish immigration and in turn triggering a Jewish insurgency.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, {{his wife}} Badia'a died and al-Hajj Muhammad {{was left with}} his four sons. With the killing of Izz al-Din al-Qassam, a Muslim revivalist preacher and anti-colonial militant by British forces, {{tensions}} between the Palestinian <b>Arab</b> <b>population,</b> among whom al-Qassam was popular, and the authorities rose significantly. His sympathizers grew in number {{and the notion of}} armed struggle against British rule and British sponsorship of Zionism became increasingly popular {{as an alternative to the}} diplomatic negotiations between the Palestinian leadership and the British government. The negotiations were ultimately seen by the local population as a futile effort that bore no tangible results. When al-Hajj Muhammad actively took part in the upcoming revolt, he entrusted his children with his sister Halima, a widow. According to his eldest son Kamal, she too was a grain merchant, who later traded in textiles. She also financially supported the children's education. Al-Hajj Muhammad would normally meet with his sons for one or two days in different villages. His children would be escorted to his location by one of al-Hajj Muhammad's rebels.|$|E
