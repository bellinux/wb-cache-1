5|$|The {{main event}} was a Biker Chain {{match for the}} WWE Championship between Brock Lesnar and The Undertaker. During the match, a chain was hung on a pole above the ring, and once it was {{retrieved}} {{it could be used}} as a legal weapon. After enduring a series of punches from Lesnar, Undertaker attempted to take the chain down, but the lights in the arena went out and he climbed back down to the ring. Taker then executed a piledriver on Lesnar onto the ring steps. Taker put Lesnar in a dragon sleeper. After getting out of the hold, Lesnar executed a F-5 to Taker. Lesnar made an attempt to go for the chain, but Taker performed a chokeslam off the top rope. Following this, The Full Blooded Italians interfered in the match, trying to attack Taker. Taker threw them out of the ring and did a suicide dive onto them after performing a Last Ride on Lesnar. He then retrieved the chain off the pole <b>and</b> <b>wrapped</b> <b>it</b> around it his fist, planning to strike Lesnar with it. Vince McMahon interfered and pushed Taker off the top rope. Lesnar then punched Taker with the chain to retain the title.|$|E

Through these improvements and the rapid growth of League membership under Maier’s direction, the circulation of the Messenger doubled in a few months.|$|E
25|$|The {{drinking}} straw is a tube used for transferring a liquid to the mouth, usually {{a drink from}} one location to another. The first crude forms of {{drinking straw}}s were made of dry, hollow, rye grass. Marvin Stone is {{the inventor of the}} drinking straw. Stone, who worked in a factory that made paper cigarette holders, did not like this design because it made beverages taste like grass. As an alternative, on January 3, 1888, Stone got a piece of paper from his factory <b>and</b> <b>wrapped</b> <b>it</b> around a pencil. By coating it with wax, his drinking straw became leak-proof so that it would not get waterlogged.|$|E

5000|$|Rock <b>and</b> <b>Wrap</b> <b>it</b> Up! is a {{non-profit}} organization that was formed by Syd Mandelbaum in 1994. [...] The independent anti-poverty think tank is based in New York, but works with partners {{across the country to}} develop greening solutions that address the issues of hunger and poverty in America. [...] The organization works by increasing financial assets available to fight poverty by identifying new revenue streams through food and other basic assets obtained without cost. The organization's roots are in rock 'n' roll music, which is where they got the name Rock <b>and</b> <b>Wrap</b> <b>it</b> Up! The group started by recovering food that was prepared, but not served from venues like Nikon at Jones Beach Theater. [...] Next, the organization started working directly with bands to see that surplus food would be donated instead of being thrown out. Rock <b>and</b> <b>Wrap</b> <b>it</b> Up! works with bands to show them how they can use their contracts as a harvesting tool for food and other assets. Some of the first bands to include Rock <b>and</b> <b>Wrap</b> <b>it</b> Up's suggested clause in their rider were The Rolling Stones, Aerosmith, Bruce Hornsby, The Allman Brothers Band, Tom Petty and Tina Turner.|$|R

[...] He then decided to dispose of the body in a large packing crate <b>and</b> <b>wrapped</b> <b>it</b> in an awning and bound it with rope. [...] After scrubbing the floor he threw Adams' clothing into a nearby outdoor privy, then stopped at the Washington bathhouse on Pearl Street to wash the blood from his clothes and hands.|$|E
500|$|On November 27, 1989, {{the trial}} {{commenced}} under District Judge David Roth after Taylor waived {{his right to}} a jury. Taylor testified {{on his own behalf}} that he only entered the apartment in the act of burglary while no one was home, leaving his fingerprints on the phone when he found money underneath it. Weber County deputy attorney William Daines stated that Taylor previously denied being in the apartment and that two witnesses placed him at the scene {{at the time of the}} crime. Prison inmate Mike Gallegos testified that he had a brief conversation in which Taylor told him that he killed a girl by accident, and masturbated on the corpse. [...] Duane Moyes and James Gaskill of the Weber State College crime laboratory testified that the person who cut the telephone cord with a knife <b>and</b> <b>wrapped</b> <b>it</b> around the neck of the victim was likely the same as the one who left behind fingerprints on the phone. Lab director Gaskill stated that the prints, three of which were matched to fingers on Taylor's left hand, were the only evidence that placed Taylor at the crime scene. Gaskill said there was no evidence in the apartment to indicate a burglary took place or that any other person was connected to the murder.|$|E

2500|$|According to Sergeant Miller, [...] "We {{continued}} {{to treat the}} patients, continued moving ammunition and grenades {{to where they were}} needed. I grabbed a radio … and set up satellite communication and then returned to the rear." [...] Tech Sergeant Miller and Senior Airman Jason Cunningham, like Miller, a pararescueman, worked hard to keep the patients from succumbing to hypothermia. They put them in the helicopter and removed its insulation <b>and</b> <b>wrapped</b> <b>it</b> around the wounded Rangers. In addition, they used the majority of the fluids available in the medical kits and anything else, including the heaters packed in their food rations. With the help of the additional Rangers and more air strikes, they took the hill, killing many al Qaeda combatants. They also recovered the bodies of Petty Officer Roberts and Sergeant Chapman.|$|E
2500|$|... "Had it {{not been}} for the Tartars I would not be alive today. They were the nomads of the Crimea, in what was then no man's land between the Russian and German fronts, and favoured neither side. I had already struck up a good {{relationship}} with them, and often wandered off to sit with them. ‘Du nix njemcky’ they would say, ‘du Tartar,’ and try to persuade me to join their clan. Their nomadic ways attracted me of course, although by that time their movements had been restricted. Yet, it was they who discovered me in the snow after the crash, when the German search parties had given up. I was still unconscious then and only came round completely after twelve days or so, and by then I was back in a German field hospital. So the memories I have of that time are images that penetrated my consciousness. The last thing I remember was that it was too late to jump, too late for the parachutes to open. That must have been a couple of seconds before hitting the ground. Luckily I was not strapped in – I always preferred free movement to safety belts… My friend was strapped in and he was atomized on impact – there was almost nothing to be found of him afterwards. But I must have shot through the windscreen as it flew back at the same speed as the plane hit the ground and that saved me, though I had bad skull and jaw injuries. Then the tail flipped over and I was completely buried in the snow. That's how the Tartars found me days later. I remember voices saying ‘Voda’ (Water), then the felt of their tents, and the dense pungent smell of cheese, fat and milk. They covered my body in fat to help it regenerate warmth, <b>and</b> <b>wrapped</b> <b>it</b> in felt as an insulator to keep warmth in." ...|$|E
