5|$|The opening {{sequence}} of the video features Jay Z as a passenger in a car speeding along Mission Road in Los Angeles, where he encounters Beyoncé, {{standing in the middle}} of the road, at the Fourth Street bridge. Beyoncé performs in various dance sequences, beginning with her wearing a white tank top, denim blue shorts, and red high-heels. She performs an elaborate solo dance on <b>a</b> <b>riser.</b> The scene shifts to a gold set with a mock photo shoot, before moving into a scene with dancers detailing Beyoncé and dancing against a wall while wearing caps and full length pants. Jay Z appears and ignites a line of petrol leading to a car parked under the bridge, which explodes in flames. Jay Z performs his rap in front of the burning car, and Beyoncé dances beside him, wearing an exotic silk print over a fur coat, before kicking the valve off a fire hydrant. She continues to dance while the water is flying everywhere. The video ends with Beyoncé and her dancers wearing vibrant Versace dresses in front of a large fan. Their outfits contrast with the neutral colors of the background, the video. Carmit Bachar, a former Pussycat Dolls singer, is one of the dancers.|$|E

50|$|Risers are {{classified}} by three criteria. The first {{is if the}} riser {{is open to the}} atmosphere, if it is then it is called <b>an</b> open <b>riser,</b> otherwise it is known as a blind type. The second criterion is where the riser is located; if it is located on the casting then it is known as <b>a</b> top <b>riser</b> and if it is located next to the casting it is known as <b>a</b> side <b>riser.</b> Finally, if the riser is located on the gating system so that it fills after the molding cavity, it is known as <b>a</b> live <b>riser</b> or hot riser, but if the riser fills with materials that have already flowed through the molding cavity it is known as <b>a</b> dead <b>riser</b> or cold riser.|$|R

40|$|The core-annulus {{structure}} {{is essential to}} the modeling and optimization of riser reactors such as used in Fluid Catalytic Cracking. This paper presents results of measurements taken with various probes in a pilot plant and in <b>an</b> industrial <b>riser.</b> The instantaneous probe signals were analyzed with sophisticated signal analysis methods based on the detection of cycles and the determination of the correlation dimension. In <b>a</b> pilot plant <b>riser,</b> <b>a</b> core-annulus structure was identified with optical and momentum probe measurements. Cycle analysis of the optical probe measurements showed that the annulus was unstable: its thickness fluctuated with an average cycle time of 0. 3 s. There were waves at the core-annulus boundary. In <b>an</b> industrial <b>riser,</b> <b>a</b> similar core-annulus structure could be identified with temperature and momentum probe measurements. Local temperature measurements are much easier to perform in <b>an</b> industrial <b>riser</b> than momentum probe measurements but can provide, with cycle analysis, the location of the core-annulus transition. Analysis of the momentum probe and temperature signals showed that the thickness of the wavy transition layer between core and annulus was about the same in the pilot plant and the industrial riser, meaning that the relative range of fluctuations in annulus thickness was much smaller in the larger industrial <b>riser.</b> <b>A</b> model was developed to predict the time-averaged transition between core and annulus. This model, which had been successfully used to predict the annulus thickness in dilute-phase vertical pneumatic transport lines, assumes that the annulus thickness is such that the riser pressure drop is minimized. Measurements and model predictions were in good agreement...|$|R
