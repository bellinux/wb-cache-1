5|$|Again, {{this is a}} simplification, {{based on}} <b>a</b> <b>hypothetical</b> Earth that orbits at uniform speed around the Sun. The actual speed with which Earth orbits the Sun varies {{slightly}} during the year, so {{the speed with which}} the Sun seems to move along the ecliptic also varies. For example, the Sun is north of the celestial equator for about 185 days of each year, and south of it for about 180 days. The variation of orbital speed accounts for part of the equation of time.|$|E
5|$|Although {{a planet}} {{has yet to}} be {{directly}} observed around Vega, the presence of a planetary system can not yet be ruled out. Thus there could be smaller, terrestrial planets orbiting closer to the star. The inclination of planetary orbits around Vega is likely to be closely aligned to the equatorial plane of this star. From the perspective of an observer on <b>a</b> <b>hypothetical</b> planet around Vega, the Sun would appear as a faint 4.3 magnitude star in the Columba constellation.|$|E

In addition it is unclear whether such moons could form in the first place.|$|E
5|$|In 1827, the British {{botanist}} Robert Brown {{observed that}} dust particles inside pollen grains floating in water constantly jiggled about {{for no apparent}} reason.

This model was validated experimentally in 1908 by French physicist Jean Perrin, thus providing additional validation for particle theory (and by extension atomic theory).|$|E
