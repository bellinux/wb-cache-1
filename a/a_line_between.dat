5|$|In {{high-speed}} territorial {{battles between}} male Australian emperors (Hemianax papuensis), the fighting dragonflies adjust their flight paths to appear stationary to their rivals, minimizing {{the chance of}} being detected as they approach. To achieve the effect, the attacking dragonfly flies towards his rival, choosing his path to remain on <b>a</b> <b>line</b> <b>between</b> the rival {{and the start of}} his attack path. The attacker thus looms larger as he closes on the rival, but does not otherwise appear to move. Researchers found that six of 15 encounters involved motion camouflage.|$|E

5|$|By the {{beginning}} of World War I, B3, B4, and B5 were at Dover and were deployed on <b>a</b> <b>line</b> <b>between</b> Calais and the Goodwin Sands to protect {{the passage of the}} British Expeditionary Force to France. Each submarine would sail from Dover before dawn to be secured at the buoy marking their billet at dawn, the idea being that {{they would be able to}} slip from the buoy when they spotted an enemy ship and manoeuvre to attack. That this was not a good tactic was proved when B3 narrowly avoided a torpedo from a German U-boat on the morning of 2 October. Nonetheless the scheme was successful and the BEF crossed to France without loss.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the {{operation}} had finished in Cambrai, the first German units had reached the English Channel, but the British counter-attacked just west of Arras on 21 May, following on from the counter-attack of the day before (Battle of Arras). The Totenkopf division suffered casualties of just under 100men in repelling the assault. The Totenkopf was then ordered {{to the town of}} Béthune and crossed the La Bassée river under British attack on 24 May. However, the men were ordered to retreat the next day to preserve tanks for the upcoming campaign in Dunkirk and to allow the Luftwaffe to attack Allied positions in the area. The men thus had to make the hazardous crossing again on the night of 26 May. The SS men took Béthune after heavy house-to-house fighting with the British, who withdrew to <b>a</b> <b>line</b> <b>between</b> Locon and Le Paradis.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the landing}} at Scarlet Beach, the Allies set about moving south to secure Finschhafen, which saw {{fighting}} around Jivevaneng also. In mid-October, the Japanese launched a counterattack against the Australian beachhead around Scarlet Beach, which lasted {{for about a}} week and resulted in a small contraction of the Australian lines and a splitting of their force before it was defeated. After this, the Australians regained the initiative and began to pursue the Japanese who withdrew inland towards the high ground around Sattelberg. Amidst heavy fighting and a second failed Japanese counterattack, Sattelberg was secured in late November and the Australians began an area advance to the north to secure <b>a</b> <b>line</b> <b>between</b> Wareo and Gusika. This was completed by early December, and was followed by an advance by Australian forces along the coast through Lakona to Fortification Point, overcoming strong Japanese forces fighting delaying actions.|$|E

5|$|In {{anticipation}} of the A refusing to cooperate, a tentative agreement was reached with the London and North Western Railway, with whom Watkin was on good terms, for the MR to build a route via Chesham to connect to LNWR mainline. This scheme would provide the LNWR with an alternative route into London when necessary, while providing Watkin with his long-sought connection to the north. The land required for an intermediate station near Chalfont St Giles and <b>a</b> <b>line</b> <b>between</b> there and a site outside Chesham was purchased. Agreement was reached with the LNWR {{that the costs of}} building the line would be shared equally by the MR and LNWR in return for the LNWR having running rights to Rickmansworth, and an Act of Parliament authorising the extension was obtained in 1885.|$|E
5|$|Nationalist {{activity}} ceased {{during the}} course of World War I (WWI) and many nationalists were killed in the trenches. The nationalist movement was revived by the periodical Breiz Atao, which was founded in 1919. In 1923, it adopted Pan-Celticist ideals, drawing <b>a</b> <b>line</b> <b>between</b> Gauls and Bretons, and arguing that the traditionally federal Bretons were oppressed by the autocratic Latins of France. Support was instead to be sought in the north, the Easter Rising and the Irish War of Independence were portrayed as the implementations of a successful formula that was to be emulated shall France find itself in dire straits. The incorporation of Alsace-Lorraine into France as a consequence of Germany's defeat in WWI, {{led to the creation of}} an Alsatian autonomist movement that opposed the French imposition of Laïcité. In 1928, Breizh Atao established contacts with the Alsace-Lorraine Party, which in turn facilitated the spread of Nordism and Völkisch ideology into Breton nationalist circles. Ties with the ethnically German Alsatians strengthened and with them the idea of accepting Abwehr assistance, which was already being provided to the Flemish and Alsatians alike.|$|E
5|$|On August14, Cindy {{passed over}} Martinique with rough winds and {{particularly}} violent rain, amplified by the storm's {{interaction with the}} rising terrain. The greatest quantities fell to the northeast of <b>a</b> <b>line</b> <b>between</b> Sainte-Marie and Fort-de-France, with day totals of more than 4in (100mm) recorded at every weather station in that region. The highest 1- and 24-hour rainfall rates were observed in Le Prêcheur, totaling 5.79in (147mm) and 12.0in (305mm), respectively. These amounts were well above the September average of 9.29in (236mm), making Cindy {{one of the most}} extreme rain events in the island's history. A maximum gust of 40mph (65km/h) was recorded during the storm, though sustained winds onshore did not reach tropical storm force.|$|E

5|$|The {{line from}} Northallerton railway station along Ripon Line {{was closed to}} {{passengers}} on 6 March 1967 and to goods on 5 September 1969 {{as part of the}} wider Beeching Axe, despite a vigorous campaign by local campaigners, including the (nearby city of Ripon) city's MP. Today much of the route of the line through the city (Ripon) is now a relief road and although the former station still stands, it is now surrounded by a new housing development. The issue remains a significant one in local politics and there are movements wanting to restore the line. Reports suggest the reopening of <b>a</b> <b>line</b> <b>between</b> Ripon and Harrogate railway station would be economically viable, costing £40million and could initially attract 1,200 passengers a day, rising to 2,700. Campaigners call on MPs to restore Ripon railway link.|$|E

5|$|As the {{situation}} worsened, early on 9 February 'A' Company, {{which had been}} in reserve, and HQ Company were sent forward to provide further assistance to the 22nd Infantry Brigade, which was slowly being pushed back towards the tactically important Tengah airfield, via the village of Ama Keng. They took up positions at Bulim, east of the airfield; shortly afterwards {{they were joined by}} 7 Platoon, from 'B' Company, which had been detached from the Causeway sector. The remnants of the 22nd, numbering around only 500 men from its original 2,500, with a further 500 or so isolated and attempting to fight their way through, was pushed further back throughout the day. Orders were passed for a counter-attack around the airfield but as the size of Japanese forces in the area grew to around 20,000 men, they were later cancelled in favour of establishing <b>a</b> <b>line</b> <b>between</b> Bulim and Jurong, to the east of the airfield. Established in the early afternoon, within this line, the 2/4th's 'A' Company was positioned east of Bulim with 7 Platoon, 'B' Company, while the remnants of 'D' Company, amounting to only 47 men, were moved south, where they joined with 'C' Company, which was supporting the Indian 44th Brigade, which although it had not yet been engaged, had fallen back from the south-west coast to avoid being cut off and had established itself west of Ulu Pandan, behind the Sungei Jurong.|$|E

5|$|The vannus is {{bordered by}} the vannal fold, which {{typically}} occurs between the postcubitus {{and the first}} vannal vein. In Orthoptera it usually has this position. In the forewing of Blattidae, however, the only fold {{in this part of}} the wing lies immediately before the postcubitus. In Plecoptera the vannal fold is posterior to the postcubitus, but proximally it crosses the base of the first vannal vein. In the cicada the vannal fold lies immediately behind the first vannal vein (lV). These small variations in the actual position of the vannal fold, however, do not affect the unity of action of the vannal veins, controlled by the flexor sclerite (3Ax), in the flexion of the wing. In the hindwings of most Orthoptera a secondary vena dividens forms a rib in the vannal fold. The vannus is usually triangular in shape, and its veins typically spread out from the third axillary like the ribs of a fan. Some of the vannal veins may be branched, and secondary veins may alternate with the primary veins. The vannal region is usually best developed in the hindwing, in which it may be enlarged to form a sustaining surface, as in Plecoptera and Orthoptera. The great fanlike expansions of the hindwings of Acrididae are clearly the vannal regions, since their veins are all supported on the third axillary sclerites on the wing bases, though Martynov (1925) ascribes most of the fan areas in Acrididae to the jugal regions of the wings. The true jugum of the acridid wing is represented only by the small membrane (Ju) mesad of the last vannal vein. The jugum is more highly developed in some other Polyneoptera, as in the Mantidae. In most of the higher insects with narrow wings the vannus becomes reduced, and the vannal fold is lost, but even in such cases the flexed wing may bend along <b>a</b> <b>line</b> <b>between</b> the postcubitus and the first vannal vein.|$|E
