40|$|Situated in West Africa, Senegal has 700 km of {{coastline}} {{characterized by}} a large Eastern Boundary Upwelling Ecosystem providing significant biological productivity. Small-scale fishing {{plays an important role}} in the national economy of Senegal. The fishing gear used has a potentially direct or indirect impact on seabirds. To examine and evaluate this impact surveys were conducted on eight landing sites. Field surveys (2 - 3 days) took place in 2015 based on a standardized interview with questionnaire conducted with 225 small-scale fishermen. The results obtained indicate that longlines are the fishing gear that causes the highest rate of annual accidental seabird catch (63 % of seabird caugth (n = 702)), followed by handlines (16 %) and <b>anchored</b> <b>gillnet</b> (6 %). The Pomarine Skua (Stercorarius pomarinus) is the most captured bird annually (29 % of total captured birds), closely followed by the Cory's Shearwater (Calonectris diomedea) (28 % of captured birds) and the Northern Gannet (Morus bassanus) (13 % of captured birds). The village of Yoff is the landing site which has the highest rate of annual seabird catch with 39 % of the total catch indicated, followed by Kayar with 19 % and Saint Louis with 14 %, both situated on the Grande Côte. Further studies should be conducted in the entire Senegalese-Mauritanian coast in particular in the northern part of Senegal, to better evaluate the annual catch of seabirds. A great collaboration should also be established with longliners, handliners and <b>anchored</b> <b>gillnet</b> fishers to better quantify incidental catch of seabirds by the artisanal fishing gear and set up mitigation actions...|$|E
5|$|No {{attacks on}} humans have been {{attributed}} to the longfin mako shark. Nevertheless, its large size and teeth make it potentially dangerous. This shark is caught, generally in low numbers, as bycatch on longlines intended for tuna, swordfish, and other pelagic sharks, as well as in <b>anchored</b> <b>gillnets</b> and on hook-and-line. The meat is marketed fresh, frozen, or dried and salted, though it is considered to be of poor quality due to its mushy texture. The fins are also considered to be of lower quality for use in shark fin soup, though are valuable enough that captured sharks are often finned at sea. The carcasses may be processed into animal feed and fishmeal, while the skin, cartilage, and jaws are also of value.|$|R
40|$|Gas {{bubbles in}} marine mammals {{entangled}} and drowned in gillnets have been previously described by computed tomography, gross examination and histopathology. The absence of bacteria or autolytic {{changes in the}} tissues of those animals suggested that the gas was produced peri- or post-mortem by a fast decompression, probably by quickly hauling animals entangled in the net at depth to the surface. Gas composition analysis and gas scoring are two new diagnostic tools available to distinguish gas embolisms from putrefaction gases. With this goal, these methods have been successfully applied to pathological studies of marine mammals. In this study, we characterized the flux and composition of the gas bubbles from bycaught marine mammals in <b>anchored</b> sink <b>gillnets</b> and bottom otter trawls. We compared these data with marine mammals stranded on Cape Cod, MA, USA. Fresh animals or with moderate decomposition (decomposition scores of 2 and 3) were prioritized. Results showed that bycaught animals presented with significantly higher gas scores than stranded animals. Gas composition analyses indicate that ga...|$|R
40|$|Fisheries Service (NMFS) {{proposes to}} amend the {{regulations}} implementing the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan (ALWTRP), to revise the management measures for reducing the incidental mortality and serious injury to the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis), humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), and fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) in commercial fisheries to meet {{the goals of the}} Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) and the Endangered Species Act (ESA). NMFS proposes additional regulations for the fisheries currently covered by the ALWTRP, which include the Northeast sink gillnet, Northeast/ Mid-Atlantic American lobster trap/pot, U. S. Mid-Atlantic coastal gillnet, Southeast Atlantic gillnet, and Southeastern U. S. Atlantic shark gillnet fisheries. NMFS also proposes to regulate the following fisheries from the MMPA’s List of Fisheries for the first time under the ALWTRP: Northeast <b>anchored</b> float <b>gillnet,</b> Northeast drift gillnet, Atlantic blue crab, and Atlantic mixed species trap/pot fisheries targeting crab (red, Jonah, and rock), hagfish, finfish (black sea bass, scup, tautog, cod, haddock, pollock, redfish (ocean perch), and white hake), conch/ whelk, and shrimp.

40|$|SUMMARY: NMFS issues {{this final}} rule {{to amend the}} {{regulations}} implementing the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan (ALWTRP). This final rule revises the management measures for reducing the incidental mortality and serious injury to the Northern right whale (Eubalaena glacialis), humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), and fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) in commercial fisheries to meet {{the goals of the}} Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) and the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The measures identified in the ALWTRP are also intended to benefit minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), which are not strategic, but are known to be taken incidentally in commercial fisheries. This final rule implements additional regulations for the fisheries currently covered by the ALWTRP (the Northeast sink gillnet, Northeast/Mid-Atlantic American lobster trap/pot, Mid-Atlantic gillnet, Southeast Atlantic gillnet, and Southeastern U. S. Atlantic shark gillnet fisheries) and regulates several fisheries from the MMPA List of Fisheries for the first time under the ALWTRP, including the following: Northeast <b>anchored</b> float <b>gillnet,</b> Northeast drift gillnet, Atlantic blue crab, and Atlantic mixed species trap/pot fisheries targeting crab (red, Jonah, and rock), hagfish, finfish (black sea bass, scup, tautog, cod, haddock, pollock, redfish (ocean perch), and white hake), conch/whelk, and shrimp. DATES: The amendments to § § 229. 2, 229. 3, and 648. 264 (a) (6) (i) are effectiv...|$|R
5|$|The IUCN has {{assessed}} the sicklefin lemon shark globally as Vulnerable; it is harvested using <b>anchored</b> and floating <b>gillnets,</b> beach nets, and longlines. The meat is sold fresh or dried and salted for human consumption, the fins used for shark fin soup, and the liver oil is processed for vitamins. The sicklefin lemon shark is highly susceptible to local overfishing, {{due to its}} slow reproductive rate and limited movements. Off Southeast Asia, this shark has become scarce {{under the pressure of}} expanding, unmonitored, and unregulated fisheries, and has been assessed there as Endangered by the IUCN. Widespread habitat degradation, including pollution and blast fishing on coral reefs and deforestation in mangroves, poses an additional threat to the survival of this species in the region. Already, the sicklefin lemon shark has been extirpated in parts of India and Thailand, and has not been reported from Indonesian markets in recent years despite being historically abundant there. Off Australia, the sicklefin lemon shark is taken in only small numbers intentionally and as bycatch, and has been listed under Least Concern.|$|R
