5|$|In 1922, Khrushchev met {{and married}} his second wife, Marusia, whose maiden name is unknown. The two soon separated, though Khrushchev helped Marusia in later years, {{especially}} when Marusia's daughter by a previous relationship suffered a fatal illness. Soon after the abortive marriage, Khrushchev met Nina Petrovna Kukharchuk, a well-educated Party organizer and daughter of well-to-do Ukrainian peasants. The two lived together <b>as</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>wife</b> {{for the rest of}} Khrushchev's life, though they did not register their marriage until 1965. They had three children together: daughter Rada was born in 1929, son Sergei in 1935 and daughter Elena in 1937.|$|E
5|$|Through his father, Prince Dom João (later King Dom JoãoVI), Pedro was {{a member}} of the House of Braganza (Portuguese: Bragança) and a {{grandson}} of King Dom PedroIII and Queen Dona (Lady) MariaI of Portugal, who were uncle and niece as well <b>as</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>wife.</b> His mother, Doña Carlota Joaquina, was the daughter of King Don CarlosIV of Spain. Pedro's parents had an unhappy marriage. Carlota Joaquina was an ambitious woman, who always sought to advance Spain's interests, even to the detriment of Portugal's. Reputedly unfaithful to her husband, she went as far as to plot his overthrow in league with dissatisfied Portuguese nobles.|$|E
5|$|A fourth {{trial in}} the death of James Kinne was {{scheduled}} for October 1964; however, in September 1964, Kinne, still free on her $25,000 bond, traveled to Mexico with an alleged lover, Francis Samuel Puglise leaving her children with James Kinne's father and traveling as Pugliese's wife under the name Jeanette Pugliese. The couple later said that they had come to Mexico to get married. Under the legal terms of her bail, Kinne was permitted to leave the country, but her contract with the company that posted her bond prohibited her from leaving Missouri without written permission from the company's agents. After crossing the border, the couple registered at a local hotel, Hotel Gin, again <b>as</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>wife.</b> Kinne, saying that she felt unsafe in the foreign country, bought a pistol—which meant that the couple now possessed multiple guns, having brought one or two with them from the United States.|$|E

5|$|Belle and Aden grow close again, {{and begin}} seeing {{one another in}} secret, as Belle is still dating Angelo. Aden's {{relationship}} with her deteriorates when Belle develops post-traumatic stress disorder after being attacked. She later refuses to leave hospital after being injured in a fire, and becomes addicted to the prescription medication that she takes for anxiety. Aden's feelings for Nicole are reignited, and they have sex several times before being caught together by Belle. Roman throws Aden out for sleeping with his daughter. Drug addict Liam Murphy (Axle Whitehead) deepens the rift between Aden and Belle, but they eventually reconcile and become engaged. In order {{to pay for a}} wedding ring, Aden takes a loan from corrupt bookmaker Clint, and loses several football matches on Clint's instruction. He refuses to ruin Geoff's career by injuring him, however, so Clint has Aden beaten up. Belle learns that she has terminal cancer and pushes the wedding forward, but does not tell Aden. He is devastated to learn of her condition the day before the ceremony, but is convinced {{to go ahead with the}} wedding by Roman. He and Belle spend four weeks together <b>as</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>wife</b> before she dies. Following her death, Aden becomes reclusive. He eventually returns to work, and is saved by Geoff when he almost drowns in an accident, which results in them becoming friends.|$|E

60|$|There was, in fact, {{an air of}} {{pleasing}} domesticity diffused {{over the}} whole circus. This was, perhaps, partly an effect from our extreme proximity to its performances; I had never been on quite such intimate terms with equitation and aerostation of all kinds; but I think it was also largely from the good hearts of the whole company. A circus must become, during the season, a great brotherhood and sisterhood, especially sisterhood, and its members must forget finally {{that they are not}} united by ties of blood. I dare say they often become so, <b>as</b> <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> <b>wives</b> <b>and</b> fathers and mothers, if not as brothers.|$|R

She was later taken by the Swedish king Aðils as his queen, which made Helgi even more unhappy. Helgi went to Uppsala to fetch her, but was killed by Aðils in battle.

25|$|The legal {{disputes}} between Isabel {{and the rest}} of the family continued. Early in 1439 Joan, the widow of Sir John's deceased eldest son, issued a writ for the arrest of Isabel on a charge of debt and, although it was not executed locally, she was detained in London and brought to court during Trinity term. The case was transferred to Coventry under a writ of nisi prius and Isabel was released on the technicality that her place of residence was wrongly recorded in the original writ. One of those who stood surety for Isabel in London was Richard Bingham, the lessee of Calton, and another Thomas Bate, a lawyer employed by Humphrey Stafford. Bate and Isabel later married and are recorded <b>as</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>wife</b> in 1446, recognising the rights of John Cokayne the younger, who had granted the manor of Middleton to Isabel for her life after levying fine of lands on Middleton and Harthill.|$|E

He told Hitler that the garrison would probably run out of ammunition that night and that the fighting in Berlin would inevitably come to an end within the next 24 hours. Weidling asked Hitler for permission for a breakout; this was a request he had unsuccessfully made before. Hitler did not answer, and Weidling went back to his headquarters in the Bendlerblock. At about 13:00 he received Hitler's permission to try a breakout that night. Hitler, two secretaries, and his personal cook then had lunch, after which Hitler and Braun said farewell to members of the Führerbunker staff and fellow occupants, including Bormann, Joseph Goebbels and his family, the secretaries, and several military officers.

500|$|O'Hara's last film of 1947 {{was playing}} a Creole woman {{opposite}} Rex Harrison in John M. Stahl's The Foxes of Harrow, set in pre-Civil War New Orleans. TCM state that O'Hara had been [...] "angling" [...] to star in Forever Amber (1947), Fox's big [...] historical romance at the time, but believe that due to a contractual clause, neither of her joint contract owners, Fox and RKO, would accept her appearing in a [...] "major star vehicle" [...] at the time. During the production O'Hara and Harrison intensely disliked each other from the outset, and she {{found him to be}} [...] "rude, vulgar, and arrogant". Harrison had thought that she disliked him simply because he was British. He reportedly belched in her face during dance sequences and accused her of anti-Semitism, being married to a Jewish woman (Lilli Palmer) at the time, which she vehemently denied. Variety, while acknowledging the length, thought that O'Hara and Harrison carried off their dramatic scenes with [...] "surprising skill". The following year, O'Hara starred opposite Robert Young in the commercially successful comedy film, Sitting Pretty. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times praised O'Hara and Young <b>as</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>wife,</b> remarking that they were [...] "delightfully clever", acting with [...] "elaborate indignation, alternating with good-natured despair".|$|E
500|$|That Catherine and Potemkin married is [...] "almost certain", {{according}} to Simon Sebag Montefiore; biographer Virginia Rounding expresses some doubt. In December 1784 Catherine first explicitly referred to Potemkin {{as her husband}} in correspondence, though 1775, 1784 and 1791 have all been suggested as possible nuptial dates. In all, Catherine's phrasing in 22 letters suggested he had become her consort, at least secretly. Potemkin's actions and her treatment of him later in life fit with this: the two at least acted <b>as</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>wife.</b> By late 1775, however, their relationship was changing, though it is uncertain exactly when Catherine took a secretary, Pyotr Zavadovsky, as a lover. On 1 January 1775, Zavadovsky became Adjutant-General to the Empress (he became her official favorite in May) and Potemkin moved to command the St. Petersburg troop division. Signs of a potential [...] "golden adieu" [...] for Potemkin include his 1775 appointment, at Catherine's request, to the title of Prince of the Holy Roman Empire. Though he was [...] "bored" [...] with Catherine, the separation was relatively peaceful. The Prince was sent on a tour to Novogrod, but, contrary to the expectations of some onlookers (though not Catherine's), he returned a few weeks later. He then snubbed her gift of the Anichkov Palace, and took new apartments in the Winter Palace, retaining his posts. Though no longer Catherine's favorite, he remained her favored minister.|$|E
