The idea is to exploit the geometric and dynamic properties of grid panels to improve {{the efficiency of the}} <b>acoustic</b> <b>treatments.</b> The work is subdivided in several tasks. It starts with the definition and manufacturing of an aircraft relevant test specimen. A laboratory setup is build in a semi-anechoic room which permits a proper mounting, excitation and measurement of the grid panel. A finite element model of the panel is developed and validated by means of experimental modal analysis. An aircraft relevant load case is defined and implemented. For this, a synthesis of the structural vibration induced by a turbulent boundary layer is realized by using a number of loudspeakers.

40|$|International audienceThe low {{frequency}} noise {{in a truck}} cabin (typically below 300 Hz) is a strong component of the interior noise comfort. In {{the development of a}} numerical process to predict the interior noise in this frequency range, the simulation of the vibro-acoustic response of the cabin is a step to be developed. This paper summarizes the work done to correlate a numerical method for the vibro-acoustic response of the cabin taking into account the effect of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>treatments.</b> One constraint is to keep a modal scheme although the <b>acoustic</b> <b>treatments</b> are heavily damped and not very suited to be solved with this scheme. The process is based on the modal extraction of structure and cavity modes, followed by the calculation of <b>acoustic</b> <b>treatments</b> impedances which are projected into the modal space. The complete vibro-acoustic response for a given excitation can then be computed with a modal frequency response. The paper presents a measurement campaign performed to get reference measured data and details the different parts of the model.

40|$|Urban {{road traffic}} noise in cities {{is an ongoing}} and {{increasing}} problem {{across much of the}} world. Consequently a large amount of effort is expended in attempts to address this problem, especially in the area of acoustic design of buildings. Acoustic design policies developed by government authorities will typically focus on required transport noise reductions through a building façade to meet a specified internal noise levels. The significance of balcony <b>acoustic</b> <b>treatments</b> has been highlighted in recent decades yet this area has potentially been considered less important than the need for acoustic isolation of building facades. This paper outlines recent research that has been conducted in determining the significance of balcony <b>acoustic</b> <b>treatments</b> in mitigating urban road traffic noise.

40|$|There is a {{drive to}} devise <b>acoustic</b> <b>treatments</b> with reduced skin-friction and {{therefore}} fuel-burn penalty for engine nacelles on commercial airplanes. The studies have been experimental, and the effects on skin-friction are deduced from measurements of the pressure drop along a duct. We conduct a detailed CFD analysis of the installation, for two purposes. The first is to predict {{the effects of the}} finite size of the rig, including its near-square cross-section and the moderate length of the treated patch; this introduces transient and blockage effects, which have not been included so far in the analysis. In addition, the flow is compressible, so that even with homogeneous surface conditions, it is not homogeneous in the streamwise direction. The second purpose is to extract an effective sand-grain roughness size for a particular liner, which in turn {{can be used in a}} CFD analysis of the aircraft, leading to actual predictions of the effect of <b>acoustic</b> <b>treatments</b> on fuel burn in service. The study is entirely based on classical turbulence models, with an appropriate modification for effective roughness effects, rather than directly modeling the liners...|$|R
40|$|A multi-faceted {{study is}} {{conducted}} {{with the objective of}} estimating the potential fiscal savings in annoyance and sleep disturbance related health costs due to providing improved building acoustic design standards. This study uses balcony <b>acoustic</b> <b>treatments</b> in response to road traffic noise as an example. The study area is the State of Queensland in Australia, where regional road traffic noise mapping data is used in conjunction with standard dose–response curves to estimate the population exposure levels. The background and the importance of using the selected road traffic noise indicators are discussed. In order to achieve the objective, correlations between the mapping indicator (LA 10 (18 hour)) and the dose response curve indicators (Lden and Lnight) are established via analysis on a large database of road traffic noise measurement data. The existing noise exposure of the study area is used to estimate the fiscal reductions in health related costs through the application of simple estimations of costs per person per year per degree of annoyance or sleep disturbance.

40|$|Applications of Electro-Rheological (ER) or Magneto-Rheological (MR) fluids as typical smart ma-terials {{have been}} widely {{investigated}} over the past decades (since their introduction in 40 ’s). The special applications of these materials {{as a means of}} noise suppression are not yet investigated. Constrained Layer Damping (CLD) sheets can be realized by incorporating EMR (ER/MR) materials. In this way, a multilayered damping sheet is obtained with adaptive (tunable) stiffness and damp-ing characteristics. These properties are easily changed in proportion to the electric (magnetic) field applied upon the EMR layer. This notion has been introduced for semi-active vibration con-trol problems. Herein, such panels incorporating EMR material are proposed for adaptive <b>acoustic</b> <b>treatments.</b> Modeling (simulation) of a 3 -layered panel with the middle layer being EMR with ad-justable properties is carried out in this paper.
