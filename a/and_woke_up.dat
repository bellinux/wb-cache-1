25|$|Liu Ji grew up {{in poverty}} and {{hardship}} with his two younger brothers, Liu Shuo (劉鑠) and Liu Shang (劉尚). The environment trained him to be sensible and empathetic. He often slept late <b>and</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> early. Even his wife and concubine(s) hardly saw him. His brothers respected and feared him, and treated him like their father. He also refrained from having a wide social network, and rarely hosted guests at home.|$|E
25|$|The {{diversion}} of heavier bombers to the Balkans {{meant that the}} crews and units left behind were asked to fly two or three sorties per night. Bombers were noisy, cold, and vibrated badly. Added to the tension of the mission which exhausted and drained crews, tiredness caught up with and killed many. In one incident on 28/29 April, Peter Stahl of KG 30 was flying on his 50th mission. He fell asleep at the controls of his Ju 88 <b>and</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> to discover the entire crew asleep. He roused them, ensured they took oxygen and Dextro-Energen tablets, then completed the mission.|$|E
25|$|The wrong-way car chase on a Los Angeles freeway {{sequence}} {{was one of}} {{the last}} things shot in the film and it took six weeks to shoot. At this point, Friedkin was working with a very stripped down crew. He came up with the idea of staging the chase against the flow of traffic on February 25, 1963 when he was driving home from a wedding in Chicago. He fell asleep at the wheel <b>and</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> in the wrong lane with oncoming traffic heading straight for him. He swerved back to his side of the road and for the next 20 years wondered how he was going to use it in a film. He told stunt coordinator Buddy Joe Hooker that if they could come up with a chase better than the one in The French Connection then it would be in the film. If not, he would not use it. Petersen did a lot of his own driving during this sequence and actor John Pankow's stressed out reactions were real. Three weekends were spent on sections of the Terminal Island Freeway near Wilmington, California that were closed for four hours at a time to allow the crew to stage the chaotic chase. With delays, the film ran a reported $1 million over budget.|$|E

40|$|Aims: Athletes {{are often}} {{instructed}} to maintain target bed <b>and</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> times {{to ensure they}} obtain adequate sleep. This type of approach, however, may not suit all individuals because of differences in circadian preference or chronotype. For example, evening types or ‘owls’ may {{find it difficult to}} cope with a schedule that requires early bed <b>and</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> times. To explore this issue, the present study examined the impact of chronotype on the ability to cope with a target bed (22 : 00 h) <b>and</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> time (07 : 30 h) in a group of endurance cyclists...|$|R

25|$|Marlena {{reconciled}} with John {{after he was}} hit over the head and left in a coma. At the same time, Kristen was arrested for what she did to Eric. She told Marlena that she could give John a cure if the charges against her were dropped. Making {{a deal with the}} devil, Marlena convinced Eric to drop his testimony against Kristen, and get her released. John received the cure, <b>and</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> from his coma. Marlena soon started counseling baseball player Paul Narita, who was struggling with being gay. She later was caught in the middle when Paul admitted to sleeping with Marlena's grandson Will Horton, even though he was married to Sonny Kiriakis. To make matters worse, John found out that Paul was his son. Marlena was at odds with John, in an attempt to protect her grandson. Will enlisted Marlena's help, wanting Paul to leave him and Sonny alone. In an attempt to help Will, Marlena ended up heading to Italy by accident, and found Kristen. The two ended up in a struggle, and Kristen fell out of a window; she was presumed dead. Marlena returned home, but was soon captured by Stefano, who wanted revenge for Kristen's death. He planned to kill Marlena in Italy, but she was saved at the last second by Stefano's son, Chad. Marlena returned home to John and her family.|$|E

She feared she would spend {{the rest of her life}} on her back, and was angry with her colleagues for saving her. Bågenholm soon {{recovered}} from the paralysis, however, and later apologized to her friends; [...] "I was very irritated when I realized they had saved me. I feared a meaningless life, without any dignity. Now I am very happy to be alive and want to apologize." [...] Bågenholm's kidneys and digestive system were not working properly, so she had to recover in an intensive care unit for two more months. After spending 28days in the Tromsø intensive care unit, she was flown to Sweden in an ambulance helicopter for the remainder of her recovery.|$|E

2500|$|The Gospel {{begins with}} the {{creation}} of the universe by an invisible and undetectable Flying Spaghetti Monster. On the first day, the Flying Spaghetti Monster separated the water from the heavens; on the second, because He could not tread water for long and had grown tired of flying, He created the land—complemented by a beer volcano. Satisfied, the Flying Spaghetti Monster overindulged in beer from the beer volcano <b>and</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> hungover. Between drunken nights and clumsy afternoons, the Flying Spaghetti Monster produced seas and land (for a second time, accidentally, because he forgot that he created it the day before) along with Heaven and a [...] "midgit", which he named Man. Man and an equally short woman lived happily in the Olive Garden of Eden for some time until the Flying Spaghetti Monster caused a global flood in a cooking accident.|$|E
2500|$|In late 1967, Geezer Butler formed {{his first}} band, Rare Breed, and soon {{recruited}} Osbourne {{to serve as}} vocalist. The band played two shows, then broke up. Osbourne and Butler reunited in Polka Tulk Blues, along with guitarist Tony Iommi and drummer Bill Ward, whose band Mythology had recently broken up. They renamed themselves Earth, but after being accidentally booked for a show instead of a different band with the same name, they decided to change their name again. They finally settled on the name Black Sabbath in August 1969, based on the film of the same name. The band had noticed how people enjoyed being frightened; inspired, the band decided to play a heavy blues style of music laced with gloomy sounds and lyrics. While recording their first album, Butler read an occult book <b>and</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> to a dark figure {{at the end of}} his bed. Butler told Osbourne about it and together they wrote the lyrics to [...] "Black Sabbath", their first song in a darker vein.|$|E
