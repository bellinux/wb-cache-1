40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop a near-infrared (NIR) tunable external cavity laser (ECL) that is based on a semiconductor optical amplifier and two different wavelength selective elements. In order to achieve the wavelength selection, several filters have been tested in the ECL setups, including plasmonic filter, acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF), gradient photonic crystal and Fabry-Perot (FP) cavity filter. The results show that the AOTF and FP filter have been applied successfully in the ECL system as wavelength selective elements to demonstrate a broadband wavelength tuning in the range between 830 nm and 870 nm. The tunable ECL realized with the variation of electrical radio frequency input of AOTF or incident <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>FP</b> cavity filter from 15. 5 ÃÂ° to 30 ÃÂ° in each system. By controlling the wavelength selective elements, continuous tuning of ECL over 30 nm can be achieved and 23 lasing peaks were measured and analyzed in the laser system with FP cavity filter. The characteristics of the AOTF-based and FP-based tunable ECL, including I-V curve, threshold, tuning range and output power, are measured and reported in this thesis...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} work, we study the {{structure}} and {{the orientation of the}} 23 N-terminal peptide of the HIV- 1 gp 41 protein (AVGIGALFLGFLGAAGSTMGARS) called FP 23. The behaviour <b>of</b> <b>FP</b> 23 was investigated alone at the air/water interface and inserted into various lipid model systems: in monolayer or multibilayers of a DOPC/cholesterol/DOPE/DOPG (6 / 5 / 3 / 2) and in a DMPC bilayer. PMIRRAS and polarized ATR spectroscopy coupled with Brewster angle microscopy and spectral simulations were used to precisely determine {{the structure and}} the orientation of the peptide in its environment as well as the lipid perturbations induced by the FP 23 insertion. The infra-red results show the structural polymorphism <b>of</b> the <b>FP</b> 23 and its ability to transit quasi irreversibly from an α-helix to antiparallel β-sheets. At the air/water interface, the transition is induced by compression of the peptide alone and is modulated by compression and lipid to peptide ratio (Ri) when FP 23 is inserted into a lipid monolayer. In multibilayers and in a single bilayer, there is coexistence in quasi equal proportions of α-helix and antiparallel β-sheets <b>of</b> <b>FP</b> 23 at low peptide content (Ri= 100, 200) while antiparallel β-sheets are predominant at high FP 23 concentration (Ri= 50). In (multi) bilayer systems, evaluation of dichroic ratios and sprectral simulations show that both the α-helix and the antiparallel β-sheets are tilted at diluted FP 23 concentrations (tilt <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> α-helix with respect to the normal of the interface= 36. 5 ± 3. 0 ° for FP 23 in multibilayers of DOPC/Chol/DOPE/DOPG at Ri= 200 and 39. 0 ± 5. 0 ° in a single bilayer of DMPC at Ri= 100 and tilt <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> the β-sheets= 36. 0 ± 2. 0 ° for the β-sheets in multibilayers and 30. 0 ± 2. 0 ° in the lipid bilayer). In parallel, the FP 23 induces an increase of the lipid chain disorder which shows both by an increase of the methylene stretching frequencies and an increase of the average C–C–C <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> the acyl chains. At high FP 23 content (Ri= 50), the antiparallel β-sheets induce a complete disorganization of the lipid chains in (multi) bilayers...|$|R

Physicochemical and surface interfacial properties via the cohesive-adhesive balance (CAB) approach to colloid probe atomic force microscopy (AFM) <b>of</b> air-jet micronised <b>FP</b> crystals were investigated. These data were correlated to in vitro aerosolization performance of binary and combination DPI formulations containing salmeterol xinafoate (SX). Results: Young’s modulus <b>of</b> <b>FP</b> crystals produced using different anti-solvents ranged from 0. 6 – 12. 4 GPa. Crystals with low Young’s modulus required multiple passes in the microniser to reduce the particle size to less than 5 μm, whilst those with the highest Young’s modulus required a single pass. CAB <b>of</b> micronized <b>FP</b> samples was similar with respect to lactose, however, their adhesive affinity to SX varied.

40|$|Prostaglandin F {{receptor}} (FP-R) agonists {{have been}} shown to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with glaucoma by enhancement of aqueous humor flow via uveoscleral path-way. This study analyzes additional mechanisms behind the ocular hypotensive effect <b>of</b> <b>FP</b> receptor agonists. The trabecular meshwork (TM) is actively involved in IOP regulation through contractile mechanisms. Contractility of TM is induced by endothelin (ET) - 1, a pos-sible pathogenic factor in glaucoma. ET- 1 levels in aqueous humor were found to be elevated in glaucoma. A possible intervention <b>of</b> the <b>FP</b> receptor agonists in the ET- 1 effects on TM function was studied. The effects <b>of</b> <b>FP</b> receptor agonists on contractility of bovine TM (BTM) were investigated using a force-length transducer. The effects <b>of</b> <b>FP</b> receptor agonists on intracellular Ca 2 + ([Ca 2 +]i) mobilization in cultured cells were measured using fura- 2 AM. In summary, this study suggests that the anti-endothelin effect on TM contractility which probably increases aqueous humor outflow via the conventional route is additionally involved in the IOP-lowering effect <b>of</b> <b>FP</b> receptor agonists. Thus, FP receptor agonists operate by di-rect interaction with ET- 1 -induced contractility of TM. This effect is mediated by the FP re-ceptor. The inhibiting action <b>of</b> <b>FP</b> receptor agonists on ET- 1 -induced TM contractility could explain the fast effect on IOP of these antiglaucomatous drugs...|$|R

DESIGN: A questionnaire including 32 statements about treatment of insomnia, stress, and anxiety. SETTING: Local quality groups for FPs in Belgium. PARTICIPANTS: A total <b>of</b> 948 Belgian <b>FPs.</b> MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Barriers to using nonpharmacologic approaches in family practice. RESULTS: We identified 3 different groups <b>of</b> <b>FPs</b> according to their attitudes about BZD prescribing. A first relatively big group <b>of</b> <b>FPs</b> (39 %) were not really concerned {{about the risks of}} BZD prescribing. Those in the second group (17 %) were aware of the problems associated with BZDs, but did not perceive it to be their role to use nonpharmacologic approaches in family practice. Those in the third group (44 %) were concerned about BZD prescribing and found it to be a "bad solution," but were faced with various barriers to applying nonpharmacologic approaches. Surprisingly, we found that nearly 97 % <b>of</b> <b>FPs</b> thought that most people were eligible for nonpharmacologic approaches, but experienced implementation barriers {{at the level of the}} patient, the level <b>of</b> the <b>FP,</b> and the level of the health care system.

40|$|Formation, {{degradation}} and renewal of cellular organelles {{is a dynamic}} process based on permanent budding, fusion and inter-organelle traffic of vesicles. These processes include many regulatory proteins such as SNAREs, Rabs and coats. Given this complex machinery, a controversially debated issue {{is the definition of}} a minimal set of generic mechanisms necessary to enable the self-organization of organelles differing in number, size and chemical composition. We present a conceptual mathematical model of dynamic organelle formation based on interacting vesicles which carry different types <b>of</b> fusogenic proteins (<b>FP)</b> playing the role of characteristic marker proteins. Our simulations (ODEs) show that a de novo formation of non-identical organelles, each accumulating a different type <b>of</b> <b>FP,</b> requires a certain degree <b>of</b> disproportionation <b>of</b> <b>FPs</b> during budding. More importantly however, the fusion kinetics must indispensably exhibit positive cooperativity among these FPs, particularly for the formation of larger organelles. We compared different types of cooperativity: sequential alignment <b>of</b> corresponding <b>FPs</b> on opposite vesicle/organelles during fusion and pre-formation of FP-aggregates (equivalent, e. g., to SNARE clusters) prior to fusion described by Hill kinetics. This showed that the average organelle size in the system is much more sensitive to the disproportionation strength <b>of</b> <b>FPs</b> during budding if the vesicular transport system gets along with a fusion mechanism based on sequential alignments <b>of</b> <b>FPs.</b> Therefore, pre-formation <b>of</b> <b>FP</b> aggregates within the membranes prior to fusion introduce robustness with respect to organelle size.

At baseline, 34. 0 % of women and 27. 9 % of men used a modern FP method compared to 51. 2 % and 52. 2 %, respectively, at endline (p< 0. 05). Exposure to FP dialogues was associated with 1. 78 (95 % CI: 1. 20 - 2. 63) times higher odds of using a modern FP method at endline for women, but this association was not significant for men.

We show that the computational complexity can be limited adapting the RSSI quantization w. r. t. the variance of the measured RSSI error at the target. This approach turns out to be advantageous for the deployment <b>of</b> <b>FP</b> systems based on beacons equipped with inexpensive technologies, in which the measures precision loss could be compensated by larger numbers of beacons. An appropriate quantization and design of RSSI signatures will make possible the deployment <b>of</b> <b>FP</b> in larger areas maintaining the same computational load and/or the desired localization performance...|$|R
30|$|In summary, {{high-quality}} Raman {{spectra of}} a group <b>of</b> GFP-like <b>FPs</b> were obtained. Raman spectra <b>of</b> the <b>FPs</b> derived from GFP were evidently distinct from the RFP (mNeptune). Some marker bands were {{also found in the}} Raman spectra <b>of</b> GFP-derived <b>FPs.</b> These marker bands are mainly produced by their distinct chromophores. Among these bands, the Raman band shift of C 5 =C 6 presents a positive linear correlation with the excitation energy for FPs. This study not only reveals new Raman features in the chromophore, but also illustrates the relationship between these features and the optical properties <b>of</b> <b>FPs.</b>|$|R

30|$|Next, we {{computed}} {{the cerebral}} asymmetry by calculating {{the difference between}} the time–frequency power spectrum of two cerebral hemisphere (left–right). It was labeled as DATFPS (differential asymmetry of TFPS). The asymmetry indices were calculated at each of the 27 electrodes by power subtraction (e.g., TFPS <b>of</b> <b>Fp</b> 1 –TFPS <b>of</b> <b>Fp</b> 2). For each of TFPSL, TFPSR and DATFPS feature types, we had 9990 features [electrode (27) × frequency band (5) × time window (74)].|$|R
40|$|Objective: Fungal {{peritonitis}} (FP) is {{a serious}} complica-tion of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), being associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The role of nystatin prophylaxis during antibiotic therapy in the prevention <b>of</b> <b>FP</b> remains controversial, especially in programs with a modest or low baseline FP rate. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the effect of nystatin pro-phylaxis on the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>FP</b> in programs with a rela-tively modest baseline FP rate...|$|R
40|$|The floating-point (FP) {{division}} bug in Intel’s Pentium {{processor and}} the overflow flag erratum of the FIST instruction in Intel’s Pentium Pro and Pentium II processor {{have demonstrated the}} importance and the difficulty <b>of</b> verifying <b>FP</b> arithmetic circuits. In this paper, we present the verification <b>of</b> <b>FP</b> adders with reusable specifications, using extended wordlevel SMV, which is improved by using the Multiplicative Power HDDs (*PHDDs), and by incorporating conditional symbolic simulation {{as well as a}} shortcircuiting technique. Based on the case analysis, the specifications <b>of</b> <b>FP</b> adders are divided into several hundreds of implementation independent subspecifications. We applied our system and these specifications to verify the IEEE double precision FP adder in the Aurora III Chip at the University of Michigan. Our system found several design errors in this FP adder and generated one counterexample for each error within several minutes. A variant <b>of</b> the corrected <b>FP</b> adder is created to illustrate the capability of our system to handle different FP adder designs. For each <b>of</b> <b>FP</b> adders, the verification task finished in 2 CPU hours on a Sun UltraSPARCII server...|$|R
