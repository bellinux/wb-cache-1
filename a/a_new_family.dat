5|$|In 1811, Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger created <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>family</b> for {{the genus}} Didus. He named the family Inepti, {{and in it}} {{included}} only Didus ineptus, now a synonym of Raphus cucullatus. Illiger concluded that the dodo was related to ostriches and rheas, and so placed Inepti in the order Rasores, as the sister family to Gallinacei, Epollicati (a defunct group including Turnix and Syrrhaptes), Columbini , and Crypturi.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Neighbours {{suffered}} one of {{its worst}} decline in viewers and several key changes took place to boost the ratings. Network Ten drama executive, Dan Bennett revealed that the show would return to its focus on relationships and family dynamics. Writers created and introduced <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>family,</b> the Parkers, who already had a link to Ramsay Street {{in the form of}} Ned Parker (Daniel O'Connor). The family made their first on-screen appearance in July 2007, marking the start of the show's renovation.|$|E

5|$|William Herbert was {{executed}} in 1469 as a Yorkist supporter after the Battle of Edgecote Moor. Building work may have {{stopped for a}} period under his son, also called William Herbert, before recommencing in the late 1470s. By 1492, the castle passed to Elizabeth Somerset, William Herbert's daughter, who married Sir Charles Somerset, passing the castle into <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>family</b> line.|$|E
5|$|Another key design {{decision}} {{was to develop}} the concept car based on <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>family</b> of common powertrain components for electric propulsion, which initially was called the E-Flex Systems, “E” stands for electric drive and “Flex” for the different sources of electricity, but later was renamed Voltec drive system. The E-Flex or Voltec powertrain {{is an attempt to}} standardize many components of possible future electrically propelled vehicles, and to allow multiple interchangeable electricity-generating systems. The E-Flex powertrain has the potential to adapt the vehicles to pure battery electric, to fuel cell-powered or to several other sources of energy to create electricity on board, such as engine-generator sets (genset) fueled by gasoline, diesel, biodiesel, ethanol fuel (E100), or flex-fuel (E85). Regenerative braking would also contribute to the on-board electricity generation. In October 2006 the E-flex powertrain was selected for the new propulsion architecture and the name Volt was chosen by General Motors.|$|E

5|$|Brown {{considered}} Ankylosaurus so distinct {{that he made}} it {{the type}} genus of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>family,</b> Ankylosauridae (members of which are called ankylosaurids), typified by massive, triangular skulls, short necks, stiff backs, broad bodies, and osteoderms. He also classified Palaeoscincus (only known from teeth), and Euoplocephalus (then only known from a partial skull and osteoderms) {{as part of the}} family. Due to the fragmentary remains, Brown was unable to fully distinguish between Euoplocephalus and Ankylosaurus. Only having few, incomplete members of the family to compare with, he believed the group was part of the suborder Stegosauria. In 1923, Osborn coined the name Ankylosauria (members of which are called ankylosaurs or ankylosaurians), thereby placing the ankylosaurids in their own suborder.|$|E
5|$|In the 2000s, rival {{soap opera}} Home and Away emerged as {{more popular than}} Neighbours in Australia. As of 2004, Neighbours was {{regularly}} attracting just under a million viewers per episode. In 2007, Home and Away was averaging 1.4million viewers in Australia to Neighbours 700,000. During the revamp of 2007, the episode broadcast on 23 July 2007 saw the introduction of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>family,</b> updated sets, new theme music and graphics. Ratings for that episode averaged 1.05million viewers in the 6:30pm. slot. It {{was the first time}} the programme's viewing figures had topped 1million in 2007. By the end of 2007 it was reported that producers had hoped the Neighbours revamp would push the ratings up to between 900,000 to 1million an episode. It had, however, resulted in a more modest boost, with ratings hovering at about 800,000 a night. The same viewing period had shown an increase in ratings for Home and Away, which was now averaging 1.4million viewers every night.|$|E
5|$|In their {{original}} description, Charig and Milner found Baryonyx unique {{enough to warrant}} <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>family</b> of theropod dinosaurs: Baryonychidae. They found Baryonyx to be unlike any other theropod group (and considered {{the possibility that it}} was a thecodont, due to apparently primitive features), but noted that the articulation of the maxilla and premaxilla was similar to that in Dilophosaurus. They also noted that two fragmentary snouts from Niger, assigned to the family Spinosauridae by French palaeontologist Philippe Taquet in 1984, appeared almost identical to those of Baryonyx and they referred them to Baryonychidae instead. In 1988, American palaeontologist Gregory S. Paul agreed with Taquet that Spinosaurus, described in 1915 based on fragmentary remains from Egypt which were destroyed in World War II, and Baryonyx were similar and (due to their kinked snouts) possibly late-surviving dilophosaurs. French palaeontologist Eric Buffetaut also supported this relationship in 1989. In 1990 Charig and Milner dismissed the spinosaurid affinities of Baryonyx, since they did not find their remains similar enough.|$|E

The Harmons realize the house is a danger to those living in it and resolve to protect future residents by scaring them away. Both of Moira's ghostly forms (Conroy and Alexandra Breckenridge) and other ghosts, including nurse Gladys (Celia Finkelstein), Beau (Sam Kinsey), the exterminator (W. Earl Brown), and the Black Dahlia (Mena Suvari), join the Harmons to protect the Ramoses, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>family</b> that moved in, against malicious ghosts.|$|E
5|$|The {{fragmentary notes}} for the {{remainder}} of the novel indicate two different trajectories for the plot and five separate conclusions. In both major plot arcs, George Venables wins a lawsuit against Darnford for seducing his wife; Darnford then abandons Maria, flees England, and takes another mistress. When she discovers this treachery, Maria loses the child she was carrying by Darnford (either through an abortion or a miscarriage). In one ending, Maria commits suicide. In another, more complete ending, Maria is saved from suicide by Jemima who has found her first daughter. Maria agrees to live for her child (as Wollstonecraft herself had done after her second suicide attempt). Jemima, Maria and Maria's daughter form <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>family.</b>|$|E
5|$|Upon his adoption, Octavius assumed his great-uncle's name Gaius Julius Caesar. Roman {{citizens}} adopted into <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>family</b> usually retained {{their old}} nomen in cognomen form (e.g., Octavianus for {{one who had}} been an Octavius, Aemilianus for one who had been an Aemilius, etc.). However, though some of his contemporaries did, {{there is no evidence}} that Octavius ever himself officially used the name Octavianus, as it would have made his modest origins too obvious. Historians usually refer to the new Caesar as Octavian during the time between his adoption and his assumption of the name Augustus in 27BC in order to avoid confusing the dead dictator with his heir.|$|E
