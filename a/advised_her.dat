5|$|En {{route to}} Athens, Revithi {{encountered}} a male runner along the road. He gave her money and <b>advised</b> <b>her</b> {{to run the}} marathon to become famous, and, consequently, earn money or more easily find a job. After this discussion Revithi decided to run the race: she had enjoyed long-distance running as a child, and believed she could beat the male competitors.|$|E
5|$|Bethune also courted wealthy white organizations, {{such as the}} ladies' Palmetto Club. She invited {{influential}} {{white men}} to sit on her school board of trustees, gaining participation by James Gamble (of Procter & Gamble) and Thomas H. White (of White Sewing Machines). When Booker T. Washington of Tuskegee Institute visited in 1912, he <b>advised</b> <b>her</b> {{of the importance of}} gaining support by white benefactors for funding. Bethune had met with Washington in 1896 and was impressed by his clout with his donors.|$|E

5|$|During the trial, {{the defense}} {{presents}} evidence that Deng {{was convicted of}} prostitution two years ago. Deng denies the charge and says she had been gang-raped by the soldiers who killed her husband. Deng's credibility weakens further when the defense presents a surprise witness, Daniel Achok, who testifies that he had <b>advised</b> <b>her</b> to fabricate the gang rape on her application for political asylum. The jury reached verdicts {{on two of the}} three charges, finding DiStasio guilty of unlawful imprisonment and not guilty of assault but deadlocks on the rape charge, and Benson says that he will likely serve a year in prison.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Ono's {{family moved}} without her to Scarsdale, New York, an {{affluent}} town 25 {{miles north of}} mid-town Manhattan. When she later rejoined her family in the U.S., she enrolled at nearby Sarah Lawrence College. While her parents approved of her college choice, Ono said that they disapproved of her lifestyle and chastised her for befriending people they felt were beneath her. In spite of her parents' disapproval, Ono loved meeting artists, poets, and others who represented the bohemian lifestyle to which she aspired. She visited galleries and art happenings in the city; this whetted her desire to publicly display her own artistic endeavors. American avant-garde artist, composer, and musician La Monte Young was her first important contact in the New York art world; he helped Ono start her career by using her Chambers Street loft in Tribeca as a performance space. After Ono set a painting on fire at one performance, her mentor John Cage <b>advised</b> <b>her</b> to treat the paper with flame retardant.|$|E

5|$|By 11 May, the {{possibility}} of a deal between the Liberal Democrats and Labour was looking unlikely. Talks between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats continued, and after concluding {{that he would not be}} able to form a government, Brown announced his resignation that evening. He also resigned as leader of the Labour Party with immediate effect. He then left Downing Street with his wife and their children, and drove to Buckingham Palace where he tendered his resignation to the Queen and <b>advised</b> <b>her</b> to call for David Cameron.

5|$|No Lifeguard on Duty: The Accidental Life of the World's First Supermodel is an {{autobiography}} by fashion model, photographer, author and talent agent Janice Dickinson.

The author's friend make-up artist Way Bandy <b>advised</b> <b>her</b> to begin putting her past experiences down on paper {{as a form of}} therapy from prior trauma in her life. After gaining sobriety, she started compiling her notes into book format. She contacted book publisher Judith Regan who agreed to help her publish her book after hearing her tale on the phone, without first seeing a writing sample. In November 2014, Dickinson asserted in an interview with Entertainment Tonight that pressure from Bill Cosby and his lawyers resulted in the removal of an account of sexual assault and rape by Cosby when she visited him at a hotel in Lake Tahoe, California in 1982.
