5|$|A British {{campaign}} to invade Arochukwu <b>and</b> <b>open</b> <b>up</b> the hinterland for British {{military and political}} rule {{was carried out in}} 1901. A war between the British and Aro officially started on 1 December 1901 lasting till 24 March 1902 when the Aro were defeated. The Aro Confederacy ended and the rest of Aro dominated areas was added to The Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria, declared in 1900. Europeans first arrived in the Enugu area in 1903 when the British/Australian geologist Albert Ernest Kitson led an exploration of the Southern Nigeria Protectorate to search for especially valued mineral resources {{under the supervision of the}} Imperial Institute, London. By 1909 coal was found under the village of Enugwu Ngwo in the Udi and Okoga areas and by 1913 the coal was confirmed to be in quantities that would be viable commercially. By 1914 the colonial government had already merged the Northern and Southern Nigeria Protectorate to form the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria.|$|E
5|$|As Bagramyan pushed towards Vitebsk, {{his forces}} were {{aided by the}} same Belorussian guerrilla fighters who had escaped the German encirclement in April. They {{provided}} vital intelligence, including information on the location of bridges and troop movements, and launched attacks against German logistic lines. On 22 June 1944, Bagration began as Bagramyan proceeded in moving westwards as previously planned. However, a widening gap on the Front's northern flank grew as it advanced while the Second Baltic Front, tasked to help defend that area, took no action. Stalin agreed to send a tank corps to reinforce Bagramyan's forces but ordered him to capture Polotsk, which would sever Army Group North's communication lines <b>and</b> <b>open</b> <b>up</b> a route towards the central Baltic. By 3 July, his troops had accomplished the tasks {{set forth in the}} directive, destroyed the Third Panzer Army and captured Polotsk. For his achievements, on 7 July he was decorated with the title of Hero of the Soviet Union.|$|E

Casualties on Saint Antoine were heavy, although Superb had just 15 men wounded. The rest of the British squadron, following up in the darkness, mistook Saint Antoine as being still active, and all fired on the ship as they passed, intending to catch the remainder of Moreno's squadron as it sailed northwest along the Spanish coastline. At 04:00 the Formidable, now {{under the command of}} Captain Amable Troude, was seen to the north in Conil Bay near Cape Trafalgar and Saumarez sent Venerable to chase the French ship, Hood accompanied by Thames under Captain Aiskew Hollis. At 05:15, Venerable came within range and a close action soon followed, Hood ordering Hollis to bring his ship close to Troude's stern <b>and</b> <b>open</b> <b>up</b> a raking fire. Formidable had the better of the action however and at 06:45, with casualties mounting, Hood's mainmast collapsed over the side.|$|E

The team again reached the NFL championship game in 1952 and again lost to the Detroit Lions. Gibron, who was unusually quick for his large size, was selected to play in the Pro Bowl, the league all-star game, after the season. He was also named a second-team All-Pro by sportswriters.|$|E

25|$|Colbert {{then saw}} Pierre-Paul Riquet and his {{project as a}} way to pursue a policy of {{economic}} expansion in the service of absolutism in Languedoc. In fact, Riquet proposed himself to implement the salt tax and to build the Canal du Midi. Thus, the construction of the canal would permit the creation of a direct passage between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic without passing through the Strait of Gibraltar controlled by the Spaniards, the aim being to destroy the Spanish trade and establish a commercial flow through Languedoc. The Languedoc region had many resources such as wheat, wine from Minervois, woollen cloth, silk, and salt which producers were struggling to export due to lack of trade. By passing through the Canal du Midi, Colbert hoped to distribute goods in the different regions of le Midi to strengthen royal power <b>and</b> <b>open</b> <b>up</b> Toulouse and its region.|$|E
25|$|During {{the public}} discussions in 2007, an {{interest}} group {{put forward a}} proposal to build a new, much larger bridge {{to the east of}} the existing harbour bridge, and demolish the latter. They argued that the new bridge, which would be about 50% longer than the existing one, could be constructed to provide for dedicated public transport (including light rail, which they claimed would allow a tripling of the total capacity in people then being moved over the existing bridge), as well as for cyclists and pedestrians. Significantly, they argued that the new bridge would more or less pay for itself, by freeing up new residential land occupied by several kilometres of motorway approaches {{in some of the most}} sought-after Auckland locations like Saint Marys Bay. The proponents claimed that the bridge would free up more than 35 hectares <b>and</b> <b>open</b> <b>up</b> 3.3km of shoreline, a prize which would more than make up for the fact that the plans for the Western Reclamation redevelopment would in this case find themselves partly compromised by a major motorway in its area. The proposed bridge would also be cheaper to operate, and unlike a tunnel, would not need emission vents.|$|E

The immigration intensified after the journée (crisis) of June 20, 1793, and soon American families began to raise money <b>and</b> <b>open</b> <b>up</b> their homes to help exiles in what became the United States' first refugee crisis. While some white refugees blamed the French Revolutionary government for sparking the violence in Haiti, many supported the Republican regime and openly expressed their support of the Jacobins There is also some historical evidence suggesting that displaying solidarity with the French Revolution was the easiest way for the refugees to earn the support and sympathy of the Americans, who had just recently lived through their own revolution. American slaveholders, in particular, commiserated with the French planters who had been forcibly removed from their plantations in Saint-Domingue. While the exiles {{found themselves in a}} peaceful situation in the United States – safe from the violence raging in both France and Haiti – their presence complicated the already precarious diplomatic relations among the UK, France, and the U.S.|$|E
25|$|Emma, Hook {{and their}} guest return to see Rumplestiltskin {{in the hopes}} that he can open the time portal, but instead he tells them that only they can re-open it because only the people who came through the portal can re-open it, but they need to wield magic. Rumple gives Emma a wand and tells her to open the portal if she has magic, but she doesn't think she can. Rumple decides he’d rather forget {{everything}} he’s learned so as not to alter his future, then he sends Emma and Hook to a dark vault where he keeps dangerous and unpredictable magic, where their Storybrooke outfits are restored. Hook says that Emma still has some magic in her and after seeing what happened to her parents and realizing everything Henry did to bring her to Storybrooke, she's ready to return home. Hook and Emma then notice the wand lights up with magic <b>and</b> <b>open</b> <b>up</b> the portal, allowing Hook and the woman to escape first. Before she can leave, Rumple holds on to Emma and demands to know what happened to Baelfire/Neal. Emma tells him what happened, then she begs him not to take away the fact he died a hero. Rumplestiltskin drinks the forgetting potion and lets go of Emma where she is pulled into the portal, which sends her, Hook, and the woman back to Storybrooke.|$|E
25|$|The {{additional}} funding, though significant, {{expanded the}} scope of the game and causes some setbacks, and for some periods, the Greens lived off loans and donations during the development. Following Joel's death March 2014, Ryan was further committed to completing the game to honor Joel's memory and as a way to cope with his loss, and turned back to work a few days after Joel's funeral. The game, up to that point, had been written based on unknowing of Joel's fate, but with his death, the team recognized that much of what they had in place was more focused on the narrative from Ryan and Amy's side, and made it feel more of a selfish work. There were also concerns from investors about the interactivity of the title. They rewrote about 70% of the game to make it more focused on the interactions with Joel. Originally, the game would have ended with the player witnessing a machine with numerous levers that could be pulled, giving the player some sense of control, but when they examined the machine's internals, found that all of the levers were disconnected, and that they had no control of the situation. Following Joel's death, they felt this scene was no longer applicable, and instead replaced it with the players interacting a final time with Joel in a cathedral in an afterlife-type setting as to bring closure to their story. With the change, Ryan hoped that the game would help others to cope <b>and</b> <b>open</b> <b>up</b> with others with the loss of loved ones. One design decision made was to represent the characters in the game with feature-less faces. Ryan stated that this was both that being a small team they did not have the technical capability to fully program and animate the character's faces, and that by leaving the faces feature-less, it would help players engage by imagining themselves in the place of the game's characters.|$|E
