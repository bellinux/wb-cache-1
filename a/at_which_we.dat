Peters had hoped to have the half dollars {{available}} for distribution then, {{but because of the}} design controversy, they were not. He wrote to Assistant Director of the Mint Mary M. O'Reilly on July 14, expressing his frustration at the delay and stating that though the Portland festivities had passed, the state could still get some benefit from the coins if they received them during 1920. Otherwise, [...] "we might as well wait for the next Centennial [...] which I judge would be more convenient and in accordance with the speed <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> are going". He concluded by asking that the Mint let him know of the next obstacle ahead of time. Governor Milliken also wrote, on July 20, reminding Mint officials that the coin was authorized by a special act of Congress, and asking when the first consignment would be ready.|$|E

[...] The second level <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> detect the operations of mind is the level of direct human experience.

2500|$|The Coal Question; An Inquiry Concerning the Progress of the Nation, and the Probable Exhaustion of Our Coal Mines (1865) {{was a book}} by {{economist}} William Stanley Jevons that {{explored the}} implications of Britain's reliance on coal.

[...] "Are we ," [...] he asked rhetorically, [...] "in allowing the commerce of this country to rise beyond the point <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> can long maintain it?" [...] His central thesis was that the supremacy of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland over global affairs was transitory, given the finite nature of its primary energy resource. In propounding this thesis, Jevons covered a range of issues central to sustainability, including limits to growth, overpopulation, overshoot, energy return on energy input (EROEI), taxation of energy resources, renewable energy alternatives, and resource peakinga subject widely discussed today under the rubric of peak oil.|$|E

According to The New York Times, Barenboim said it was the [...] "fear, this conviction of being yet again the victim, that does not allow the Israeli public to accept Wagner’s anti-Semitism... It is the same cell in the collective brain that does not allow them to make progress in their understanding of the needs of the Palestinian people", and also said that suicide bombings in Israel [...] "had to be seen in the context of the historical development <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> have arrived". [...] The speech caused controversy; the Jewish Telegraphic Agency wrote that Barenboim had [...] "compared Herzl's ideas to Wagner's; criticized Palestinian terrorist attacks but also justified them; and said Israeli actions contributed to the rise of international anti-Semitism".|$|E

2500|$|One {{might be}} tempted to {{conjecture}} that an analog of Theorem 2 holds for graphs H other than K5. [...] Perhaps it is true that: for any non-planar graph H, there exists a positive integer k such that every H-free graph can be obtained via k-clique-sums from a list of graphs, each of which either has at most k vertices or embeds on some surface that H does not embed on. [...] Unfortunately, this statement is not yet sophisticated enough to be true. [...] We must allow each embedded graph Gi to [...] "cheat" [...] in two limited ways.

[...] The reader may prefer to defer reading the following precise description of a vortex of depth k. [...] Second, we must allow a limited number of new vertices to add to each of the embedded graphs with vortices.|$|E
