5|$|Abdül Kadir was {{the first}} Ottoman pre-dreadnought {{battleship}} to be constructed. She was laid down in 1892 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small-scale expansion of the Ottoman Navy. Work slowed down considerably once she was framed. By the early 1900s the only progress {{that had been made}} was the addition of armor plating around her keel. Once that was finished, work ceased. Construction was planned to resume in 1904 but by that time her keel blocks, which were used to prevent hogging and sagging, had shifted and the ship was considered a total loss. She was scrapped on the slipway in 1914. A model of this ship exists in the Constantinople Naval Museum.|$|E
5|$|As Swedish is a Germanic language, the syntax shows {{similarities}} to both English and German. Like English, Swedish has a subject–verb–object basic word order, but like German, it utilizes verb-second word order in main clauses, for instance after adverbs, adverbial phrases and dependent clauses. (Adverbial phrases denoting time are usually placed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> main clause {{that is at}} the head of a sentence.) Prepositional phrases are placed in a place–manner–time order, as in English (but not German). Adjectives precede the noun they modify.|$|E
5|$|Long-standing rivalries {{result in}} {{numerous}} rematches, especially {{if one of}} the enforcers has to decline an invitation to fight during a given game. This {{is one of the reasons}} that enforcers may fight <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> game, when nothing obvious has happened to agitate the opponents. On the other hand, it is bad etiquette to try to initiate a fight with an enforcer who is near the end of his shift, since the more rested player will have an obvious advantage.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of seven seasons, Neuner has reached 34 {{personal}} World Cup wins. In {{the history of the}} International Biathlon Union she is ranked second behind Magdalena Forsberg (42), with Uschi Disl (30) third, for all-time career victories. In addition, she has won nine relay races and three mixed relay events as part of the German World Cup team. Neuner has often started slowly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> winter season and has claimed only three of her individual victories before Christmas. Consequently, 18 of her 47 wins came in the month of March. Geographically most of her wins occurred in Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia (10), followed by Antholz, Italy (6) and Ruhpolding, Germany (6).|$|E
5|$|A Song of Ice and Fire {{takes place}} in a fictional world in which seasons last for years and end unpredictably. Nearly three centuries before the events of the first novel (see backstory), the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros were united under the Targaryen dynasty by Aegon I and his sisters Visenya and Rhaenys, with Aegon Targaryen {{becoming}} the first king of the whole of the continent of Westeros, save for the southerly Dorne. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>A</b> Game of Thrones, 15 peaceful years have passed since the rebellion led by Robert Baratheon deposed and killed the last Targaryen king, Aerys II, and proclaimed Robert king of the Seven Kingdoms, with a nine year long summer coming to an end.|$|E
5|$|An {{observational}} study by Logan {{demonstrates that the}} female is continuously {{evaluating the quality of}} the male and his territory. The assessment is usually triggered by the arrival of a new male in a neighboring territory <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new breeding season. In those cases, the mated female is constantly seen flying over both the original and the new male’s territory, evaluating the qualities of both territories and exchanging calls with both males. The social mate displays aggressive behaviors towards the female, while the new male shows less aggression and sings softer songs. At the same time, both the mated male and the new male will fly over other territories to attract other females as well. Divorce, mate switching and extra-pair matings do occur in northern mockingbirds.|$|E

5|$|Another {{influential}} early mainframe {{game was}} Baseball, a sports game {{that was created}} on a PDP-10 minicomputer at Pomona College in 1971 by English major Don Daglow. Baseball was the first baseball video game that allowed players to manage the game as it unfolded, rather than just picking players <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> game. The program is documented at the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York. Baseball was continually updated through 1974, and distributed to other PDP-10 installations. The text-based game had each player control the pitcher or the batter; they would enter their intention to, for example, pitch to or walk the batter, or switch hitters. The batting player could direct on-base players to steal, and the batter to hit. The results of the play would be printed out onto paper as a verbose description, like a radio description of the game. Daglow went on to develop more sophisticated baseball games in 1983 with Intellivision World Series Baseball, and 1987 with Earl Weaver Baseball, as well as numerous other games.|$|E
5|$|Bonuses can {{be earned}} by {{achieving}} specific goals. If stunts or actions are repeated within a time limit, a score multiplier is earned and repeated actions boost the player's score further. Gameplay {{takes place in}} a single tropical jungle area, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> game the jeep appears in a random location within the jungle. Stunt ramps are set up throughout the game area, along with the hills and valleys these facilitate long-distance jumps and other stunts. Each game takes four minutes, after the timer counts down to zero, the total score and any bonuses earned are shown. The player's ranking compared to other games played that day and the all-time highscores are also shown. Specific achievements can be gained by players, which are saved to their online profile, though the game can be played as a 'guest', which doesn't require a game profile to be created.|$|E
5|$|Given {{that these}} {{examples}} are all highly symmetric—and thus simplified—it {{is tempting to}} conclude that the occurrence of singularities is an artifact of idealization. The famous singularity theorems, proved using the methods of global geometry, say otherwise: singularities are a generic feature of general relativity, and unavoidable once the collapse of an object with realistic matter properties has proceeded beyond a certain stage and also <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wide class of expanding universes. However, the theorems say little about the properties of singularities, and much of current research is devoted to characterizing these entities' generic structure (hypothesized e.g. by the BKL conjecture). The cosmic censorship hypothesis states that all realistic future singularities (no perfect symmetries, matter with realistic properties) are safely hidden away behind a horizon, and thus invisible to all distant observers. While no formal proof yet exists, numerical simulations offer supporting evidence of its validity.|$|E

5|$|Northern mockingbirds {{adjust the}} sex ratio of their {{offspring}} {{according to the}} food availability and population density. Male offspring usually require more parental investment. There is therefore a bias for bearing the costlier sex <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> breeding season when the food is abundant. Local resource competition predicts that the parents have to share the resources with offspring that remain at the natal site after maturation. In passerine birds, like the northern mockingbird, females {{are more likely to}} disperse than males. Hence, it is adaptive to produce more dispersive sex than philopatric sex when the population density is high and the competition for local resources is intense. Since northern mockingbirds are abundant in urban environments, {{it is possible that the}} pollution and contamination in cities might affect sexual hormones and therefore play a role in offspring sex ratio.|$|E
5|$|Similar to Capcom's various Street Fighter titles, X-Men vs. Street Fighter is a 2D {{fighting}} game {{in which}} players control various characters to engage in one-on-one combat, attempting to knock out the opponent by depleting their health. It is the first formal installment in the Marvel vs. Capcom series and features dual-character selection and tag team battles. Instead of the typical best-of-three round format, matches consist of a single round. Players select two characters <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> match, each sporting their own life gauge. Players control one character at a time, while the other awaits off-screen. The starting character can tag in the off-screen character {{at any time during}} the fight. The dormant character will also slowly recover a portion of their vitality while the current character is fighting. If one character loses all of their vitality, then the tag partner will automatically come into play. The match continues until both characters on either team are defeated. If the timer runs out before either team is knocked out, then the player with the most remaining health is declared the winner.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{was born}} in Mobile, Alabama, but {{his family moved to}} Watts, Los Angeles, when he was six years old. While {{participating}} in childhood athletic activities, Smith developed quick reflexes; he went on to play baseball in high school and college, at Los Angeles' Locke High School and Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo respectively. Drafted as an amateur player by the Padres, Smith made his major league debut in 1978. He quickly established himself as an outstanding fielder, and later became known for performing backflips on special occasions while taking his position <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> game. Smith won his first Gold Glove Award in 1980, and made his first All-Star Game appearance in 1981.
