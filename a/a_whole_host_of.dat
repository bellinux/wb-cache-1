5000|$|Species whose broods are {{parasitised}} by {{the common}} cuckoo {{have evolved to}} discriminate against cuckoo eggs but not chicks. Experiments have shown that common cuckoo chicks persuade their host parents to feed them by making a rapid begging call that sounds [...] "remarkably like <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> brood <b>of</b> <b>host</b> chicks." [...] The researchers suggested that [...] "the cuckoo needs vocal trickery to stimulate adequate care {{to compensate for the}} fact that it presents a visual stimulus of just one gape." [...] However, a cuckoo chick needs the amount of food <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> brood <b>of</b> <b>host</b> nestlings, and it struggles to elicit that much from the host parents with only the vocal stimulus. This may reflect a tradeoff—the cuckoo chick benefits from eviction by receiving all the food provided, but faces a cost in being the only one influencing feeding rate. For this reason, cuckoo chicks exploit host parental care by remaining with the host parent longer than host chicks do, both before and after fledging.|$|R

The project is based on an investigation of the language of tourism and how that has evolved since the explosion of the phenomenon in the last 50 years. Sanders’ work revolves around questions of representation and this particular project is a comparative research into the various genres that constitute the tourist landscape. Apart from monuments, Sanders also explores dioramas, panoramas, and landscapes, with a particular focus on differing perspectives, how these images are framed and which representational tools are used to convey a certain view thus aiming to raise awareness about how these images are constructed. Using archival material, books, paintings and photographs as references Sanders select and transcribes certain images into drawings in order to urge closer contemplation of their structure. The project is ultimately a kind of mapping the history of tourist representation and the ‘architectures of tourism’, {{while at the same time}} exploring the role of photography in the genre’s evolution, and of painting before that. How has this kind of representation changed over the years? What kind of differences exist within the genre itself? How does perspective change the view we have an image? What is the difference between the expectation, the representation and the reality of the tourist experience? When does a monument or landscape become worthy of representation?

Our sample spans the redshift range 0. 1 < z < 1. 6 {{and is the}} first comprehensive <b>host</b> galaxy study <b>of</b> this specific subclass of cosmic explosions. Combining the multi-band photometry and emission-line measurements, we determine the luminosities, stellar masses, star formation rates and metallicities. We find that as <b>a</b> <b>whole,</b> the <b>hosts</b> <b>of</b> SLSNe are a low-luminosity (~ - 17. 3 mag), low stellar mass (~ 2 x 10 ^ 8 M_sun) population, with a high median specific star formation rate (~ 2 Gyr^- 1). The median metallicity of our spectroscopic sample is low, 12 + log(O/H}) ~ 8. 35 ~ 0. 45 Z_sun, although at least one host galaxy has solar metallicity. The <b>host</b> galaxies <b>of</b> H-poor SLSNe are statistically distinct from the <b>hosts</b> <b>of</b> GOODS core-collapse SNe (which cover a similar redshift range), but resemble the <b>host</b> galaxies <b>of</b> long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) in terms of stellar mass, SFR, sSFR and metallicity. This result indicates that the environmental causes leading to massive stars forming either SLSNe or LGRBs are similar, and in particular that SLSNe are more effectively formed in low metallicity environments. We speculate that the key ingredient is large core angular momentum, leading to a rapidly-spinning magnetar in SLSNe and an accreting black hole in LGRBs.

40|$|The {{spectral}} deconvolution algorithm (SDA) and SDA+ (extended SDA) methodologies can {{be employed}} to separate the fine and coarse mode extinction coefficients from measured total aerosol extinction coefficients, but their common use is currently limited to AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) aerosol optical depth (AOD). Here we provide the verification of the SDA+ methodology on a non-AERONET aerosol product, by applying it to fine and coarse mode nephelometer and particle soot absorption photometer (PSAP) data sets collected in the marine boundary layer. Using data sets collected on research vessels by NOAA-PMEL(National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration – Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory), we demonstrate that with accurate input, SDA+ is able to predict the fine and coarse mode scattering and extinction coefficient partition in global data sets representing a range of aerosol regimes. However, in low-extinction regimes commonly found in the clean marine boundary layer, SDA+ output accuracy is sensitive to instrumental calibration errors. This work was extended to the calculation of coarse and fine mode scattering coefficients with similar success. This effort not only verifies {{the application of the}} SDA+ method to in situ data, but by inference verifies the method as <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> for <b>a</b> <b>host</b> <b>of</b> applications, including AERONET.
