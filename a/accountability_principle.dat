This question echoes the debate on equity and justice principles which often defines three rules for a fair allocation: the <b>accountability</b> <b>principle,</b> the efficiency principle, and the needs principle (Konow, 2001). We design a choice experiment in which farmers can choose between different payment rules.

40|$|Fairness is {{a central}} topic in ethics, {{political}} science and economics. A variety of economic questions, such as charitable donation, welfare programs, taxation of income and inheritances, are closely associated with people's fairness preferences. Hence {{it is important to}} take fairness and justice into account for making appropriate social welfare policy. This dissertation contributes to the related literature in understanding people's fairness preferences by using an experimental approach. It consists of three interrelated essays, all of which focus on fairness preferences and redistributive decision making under risk and uncertainty. The first essay is an experimental investigation into fairness preferences and redistribution under different rooted risks, i. e., pure-luck versus option-luck. Our experimental results reconcile the conflict between the <b>accountability</b> <b>principle</b> and consequential egalitarianism by suggesting that people are more inclined to the <b>accountability</b> <b>principle</b> in the presence of relatively lower income inequality but support consequential egalitarianism in case of large income inequality or salience of extreme low payoff. The second essay explores the dynamic evolution of a laboratory economy in which fairness preferences, risk preferences, and income inequality are jointly determined under different redistributive policies. By using a panel vector auto-regression model, we find different patterns of interplay between subjects under different redistributive regimes. The third essay studies how charitable giving is influenced by the performance of charitable organizations and associated organization costs. We study charitable giving in a laboratory experiment, in which donors are confronted with a tradeoff between helping people in need and the possibility of being cheated. We find evidence that individuals exploit the shadow of fundraising cost to excuse their selfishness with a self-serving biased belief that fundraisers are corrupt. In contrast, the charitable contribution significantly increases when the moral excuse is removed by excluding the manipulation of costs by the fundraisers...|$|E

In our model, dictators may also account for {{the way in which}} the surplus was generated. More precisely, our model incorporates the idea of liberal egalitarian ethics into the analysis, making it possible for dictators to divide the surplus according to the <b>accountability</b> <b>principle,</b> which states that subjects should only be rewarded for factors under their control. This fairness ideal does not hold subjects responsible for factors beyond their control in the production of the surplus, an idea that is absent in the models of inequity aversion cited abov...|$|E

This study is based on a real effort-task experiment, where the exogenous influence is twofold: it comes either as a production factor or as a bonus. We confirm that in a base treatment, i. e in absence of exogenous factors, subjects base their allocation decisions largely on effort. When exogenous differences are present behavior changes. Whereas bonuses are largely ignored and subjects still mostly base their decisions on effort, production factors render allocations more selfish. Furthermore, we study whether accountability holds for decisions over opportunities. We apply the so-called lottery-points-method, where a binary lottery in the last experimental stage allocates the whole amount to one of the workers. We find that subjects claim more for themselves when allocating opportunities in all treatments. Distributive justice, real effort task, procedural fairness...|$|E

We carried out a theoretical review and a field study by collecting opinions from a sample of experts, selected to participate in events related to the ombudsman area between 2009 and 2011 in Brazil.
