Unable to gain lift speed, the plane cartwheeled off the end of the bluff and burst into flames, killing two of its crew.

40|$|Abstract. In {{the field}} of {{aircraft}} landing analysis, {{the use of a}} multibody code such as ADAMS has enormous potential: it allows the designer to create as complex a model as desired, with the possibility of integrating subsystems and of accounting, for example, for aerodynamics and structural flexibility. In this paper, an approach to the application of ADAMS in the analysis of <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> behaviour and ground manoeuvring characteristics of a trainer aircraft is presented. The models developed are to be used during the design phase for the evaluation of the loads transferred to the fuselage. The first step taken towards the implementation of the aircraft model was that of separately re-creating the behaviour of the <b>auxiliary</b> and main <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> during drop-testing. In this phase, a rigid-body model was examined, along with built-in ADAMS tire models and external, user-written tire models. System components such as shock absorbers, for example, were modelled using the know-how previously acquired with a dedicated code. After having validated the ADAMS model using the results obtained in a parallel study conducted with the dedicated code, the <b>auxiliary</b> and main <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> were assembled and a complete aircraft rigid-body model was built. The model was then used to simulate the behaviour of the landing system during ground manoeuvring, using linear aerodynamics. The model is planned to evolve, integrating flight mechanics for the approach and touch-down phase, and modelling the hydraulic subsystem...|$|R

40|$|The {{reduction}} of <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> noise of aircraft on {{approach has been}} a focus of the aerospace community for many years. The present paper describes a method that predicts the noise from the <b>landing</b> <b>gear,</b> accounting for local flow variations due to the wing ge-ometry, {{the interaction of the}} <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> wake with high-lift devices, and a method for approximating the shielding of noise caused by the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> geometry. The prediction of the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> noise is performed using the <b>Landing</b> <b>Gear</b> Model and Acoustic Pre-diction code (LGMAP) developed at The Pennsylvania State University. A line of sight algorithm based on scattering by a two-dimensional cylinder approximates the effect of acoustic shielding caused by the <b>landing</b> <b>gear.</b> Two-dimensional FLUENT calculations of approximate wing cross-sections are used by LGMAP to compute the noise change due to the change in local flow velocity {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>landing</b> <b>gear.</b> A three-dimensional immersed boundary CFD calculation of isolated LGMAP representations of <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> geometries provides relatively quick estimates of the mean flow features caused by the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> for the prediction of trailing edge noise associated with the interaction of the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> wake with the high lift devices.

When {{designing}} a <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> damper, it is well-known that damper characteristics required for good handling {{are not the}} same as those required for good ride comfort. Semi-active control <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> damper, as their name implies, fill the gap between purely passive damper and fully active control Langing gear-control systems and offer the reliability of passive systems, yet maintain the versatility and adaptability of fully active devices. During recent years there has been considerable interest towards theoretical study and practical practical implementation of this semi-active control <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> damper for their low energy requirement and cost. For this reason, The basic theoretical for semi-active <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> damper design and implementation has been briefly reviewed, mathematical model of semi-active control <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> is established. A state feedback semi-active controller is designed. At last, the passive control <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> model and semi-active control <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> model are simulated. Simulation result shows that the vibration of passive control <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> is vehement, and the system stable time is long. But in the simi-active control <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> system the impact load and vibraton can be reduced, the aircraft can reach the stability state in a few seconds.
