5|$|The {{figure of}} Orpheus is {{prominent}} throughout the narrative, and Clement contrasts his song, representing pagan superstition, {{with the divine}} Logos of Christ.

5|$|Apart from habitat {{destruction}} and deliberate, targeted persecution, pelicans {{are vulnerable to}} disturbance at their breeding colonies by birdwatchers, photographers and other curious visitors.

5|$|Diagnosis of a {{pneumothorax}} {{by physical}} examination <b>alone</b> <b>can</b> be difficult (particularly in smaller pneumothoraces). A chest X-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan, or ultrasound is usually used to confirm its presence. Other conditions {{that can result}} in similar symptoms include a hemothorax (buildup {{of blood in the}} pleural space), pulmonary embolism, and heart attack. A large bullae may look similar on a chest X-ray.|$|E

5|$|Extrapolation of the {{expansion}} of the universe backwards in time using general relativity yields an infinite density and temperature at a finite time in the past. This singularity indicates that general relativity is not an adequate description of the laws of physics in this regime.

5|$|The {{episode was}} written and {{directed}} by series co-creator Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA L in the United States. It serves as a satire of pop culture criticism, and mocks people who find hidden messages in works which are ironically unnecessary. The episode includes other themes, including the lack of interest in reading among American youths, and even mocks the idea that a book <b>alone</b> <b>can</b> inspire someone into committing violent crimes.|$|E
5|$|The silent {{protagonist of}} FireRed and LeafGreen {{is a child}} {{who lives in a}} small town named Pallet Town. After players start a journey and venture alone into tall grass, a voice warns them to stop. Professor Oak, a famous Pokémon researcher, {{explains}} to the player that such grass is often the habitat of wild Pokémon, and encountering them <b>alone</b> <b>can</b> be very dangerous. He takes the player to his laboratory where the player meets Oak's grandson, another aspiring Pokémon Trainer. The player and their rival are both instructed to select a starter Pokémon for their travels. The rival then challenges the player to a Pokémon battle with their newly obtained Pokémon and continues to battle the player at certain points throughout the games.|$|E

5|$|The third story {{describes}} Parvati being banished by Shiva {{when she}} becomes momentarily distracted {{while listening to}} his explanation of the Vedas. Parvati, now born as Kayarkanni, {{is the daughter of}} a fisherman. When playing with her friends, Shiva approaches {{in the guise of a}} fisherman and flirts with her, despite her disapproval. The fishermen often face problems due to a giant shark that disrupts their way of life. Shiva asserts that he <b>alone</b> <b>can</b> defeat the shark. After a long battle, Shiva subdues the shark (which is actually Nandi in disguise) and remarries Parvati.|$|E
5|$|The 19S {{particle}} in eukaryotes {{consists of}} 19 individual proteins and is divisible into two subassemblies, a 9-subunit base that binds {{directly to the}} α ring of the 20S core particle, and a 10-subunit lid. Six of the nine base proteins are ATPase subunits from the AAA Family, and an evolutionary homolog of these ATPases exists in archaea, called PAN (Proteasome-Activating Nucleotidase). The association of the 19S and 20S particles requires the binding of ATP to the 19S ATPase subunits, and ATP hydrolysis {{is required for the}} assembled complex to degrade folded and ubiquitinated proteins. Note that only the step of substrate unfolding requires energy from ATP hydrolysis, while ATP-binding <b>alone</b> <b>can</b> support all the other steps required for protein degradation (e.g., complex assembly, gate opening, translocation, and proteolysis). In fact, ATP binding to the ATPases by itself supports the rapid degradation of unfolded proteins. However, while ATP hydrolysis is required for unfolding only, it is not yet clear whether this energy may be used in the coupling of some of these steps.|$|E
5|$|The player {{begins in}} their {{hometown}} of Pallet Town. After venturing alone into the tall grass, the player is stopped by Professor Oak, a famous Pokémon researcher. Professor Oak explains to the player that wild Pokémon may be living there, and encountering them <b>alone</b> <b>can</b> be very dangerous. He takes the player to his laboratory where the player meets Oak's grandson, a rival aspiring Pokémon Trainer. The player and the rival are both instructed {{to select a}} starter Pokémon for their travels out of Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and Charmander. Oak's Grandson will always choose the Pokémon which is stronger against the player's starting Pokémon. He will then challenge the player to a Pokémon battle with their newly obtained Pokémon {{and will continue to}} battle the player at certain points throughout the games.|$|E

5|$|The series follows Blythe Baxter, a 12 Year {{old girl}} {{living with her}} air pilot father, Roger. Forced to move out from her {{suburban}} hometown following her father's promotion, she moves into an apartment located in a crowded city. Their complex is located above the eponymous Littlest Pet Shop—a pet store that {{also serves as a}} day camp for numerous pets—where Blythe works as a fashion designer. Her adventure begins when she discovers that she <b>alone</b> <b>can</b> miraculously understand and talk to the pets that regularly stay at the shop, in addition to most other animals on the planet. As she and the pets spend time together, they find the pet shop jeopardized by larger pet store managed by Fisher Biskit and his snooty twin daughters, Whittany and Brittany Biskit. To avoid being dispersed, the pets convince Blythe to remain an employee.|$|E
