50|$|Csatari studied {{art at the}} Academy of Arts, Newark, New Jersey {{and also}} at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. In 1953, he became an artist in the layout {{division}} in BSA Supply Division's advertising department. In 1958, he became the art director; designing <b>advertising</b> <b>and</b> sales <b>promotional</b> pieces, <b>cover</b> illustrations, <b>and</b> posters. Like his mentor Rockwell, he also served as art director of Boys' Life magazine {{at the beginning of}} his career, being named to that position in 1973. This was the time he worked closely with Rockwell. Csatari's job was to come up with possible themes for the paintings and make rough sketches for Rockwell. Once Rockwell decided on a concept, Csatari would gather models and shuttle them up for a photo shoot in the artist's studio in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. Csatari often assisted Rockwell on his work at this time as by then Rockwell was aging. In 1976 when Rockwell retired from the calendar commission, the BSA asked Csatari to continue in the Rockwell tradition. Csatari says that while he paints in Rockwell's style, he is no Rockwell, whom he considers in another league.|$|R
