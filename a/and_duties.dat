5|$|On October 5, Secretary of State Robert Lansing was {{the first}} {{official}} to propose that Marshall forcibly assume presidential powers <b>and</b> <b>duties.</b> Other cabinet secretaries backed Lansing's request, as did Congressional leaders, including members of both the Democratic and Republican parties who sent private communications to Marshall. Marshall was cautious in accepting their offers of support. After consulting {{with his wife and}} his long-time personal adviser, Mark Thistlethwaite, he privately refused to assume Wilson's duties and become Acting President of the United States. The process for declaring a president incapacitated was unclear at that time, and he feared the precedent that might be set if he forcibly removed Wilson from his powers <b>and</b> <b>duties.</b> Marshall wanted the president to voluntarily allow his powers to devolve to the vice president, but that was impossible given his condition and unlikely given Wilson's dislike for Marshall. Marshall informed the cabinet that the only cases in which he would assume Wilson's powers <b>and</b> <b>duties</b> were a joint resolution of Congress calling on him to do so, or an official communication from Wilson or his staff asserting his inability to perform his duties.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} that arose after the incapacity of President Wilson, for which Marshall's vice-presidency is most remembered, revived {{the national debate}} {{on the process of}} presidential succession. The topic was already being discussed when Wilson left for Europe, which influenced him to allow Marshall to conduct cabinet meetings in his absence. Wilson's incapacity during 1919 and the lack of action by Marshall made it a major issue. The constitutional flaws in the process of presidential succession had been known since the death of President William Henry Harrison in 1841, but little progress had been made passing a constitutional amendment to remedy the problem. Nearly fifty years later, the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution was passed, allowing the vice president to assume the presidential powers <b>and</b> <b>duties</b> any time the president was rendered incapable of carrying out the powers <b>and</b> <b>duties</b> of the office.|$|E
5|$|There {{had been}} {{occasions}} when a President was incapacitated.
