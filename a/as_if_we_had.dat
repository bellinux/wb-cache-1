25|$|The Rev. Thomas Binney, to whom I brought {{letters from}} Rev. Mr. Roaf, my pastor, {{received}} me most kindly. Mrs. Binney acted <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> been acquainted for the preceding six-and-twenty years; and, {{being the first}} London lady with whom I {{had the pleasure of}} acquaintance, I saw in her what I have since seen in English people of all ranks, who are really genteel - a most skilful and yet an indescribably easy way of making one feel perfectly at case with them. I cannot tell how it is done.|$|E
500|$|Cardinal Edmund Szoka, {{governor}} of Vatican City, said: [...] "This restoration and {{the expertise of}} the restorers allows us to contemplate the paintings <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> been given the chance of being present {{when they were first}} shown." ...|$|E
500|$|He also, as in {{his essay}} on Hamlet, notes the {{realistic}} effect of Macbeth: [...] "His plays have the force of things upon the mind. What he represents is brought home to the bosom {{as a part of}} our experience, implanted in the memory <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> known the places, persons, and things of which he treats." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We could camp equally well, {{anywhere}} here, Zaki, {{but we may}} as well {{go round}} to the extreme left; <b>as,</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to ride off suddenly, we shall at least start from the nearest point to the line by which we came." ...|$|R
5000|$|The single {{failed to}} chart {{in any of}} the {{countries}} in which it was released, even in the Netherlands, where the previous single [...] "Jewel Eyed Judy" [...] had made the top 50. [...] "Dragonfly"'s commercial failure added to the gloom within the band when they returned to Britain from America. Christine McVie later confessed, [...] "Over the last year, it seems <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> just been battered and beaten about the head with a giant club." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Have</b> <b>we</b> {{any right}} to inferences—have we any ground {{whatever}} for visions such <b>as</b> these? <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a right to them in any degree, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a right to their infinite extension.|$|R
500|$|Catt, Stone and Blackwell went {{together}} to the January, 1892 NAWSA convention in Washington, DC. Along with Isabella Beecher Hooker, Stone, Stanton and Anthony, the [...] "triumvirate" [...] of women's suffrage, were called {{away from the}} convention's opening hours by an unexpected woman suffrage hearing before the United States House Committee on the Judiciary. Stone told the assembled congressmen [...] "I come before this committee with the sense which I always feel, that we are handicapped as women in {{what we try to}} do for ourselves by the single fact that we have no vote. This cheapens us. You do not care so much for us <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> votes..." [...] Stone argued that men should work to pass laws for equality in property rights between the sexes. Stone demanded an eradication of coverture, the folding of a wife's property into that of her husband. Stone's impromptu speech paled in comparison to Stanton's brilliant outpouring which preceded hers. Stone later published Stanton's speech in its entirety in the Woman's Journal as [...] "Solitude of Self". Back at the NAWSA convention, Anthony was elected president, with Stanton and Stone becoming honorary presidents.|$|E
500|$|The {{first two}} songs {{recorded}} for the album were [...] "Any Way The Wind Blows" [...] and [...] "Who Are the Brain Police?" [...] When Tom Wilson heard the latter, {{he realized that}} The Mothers were not merely a blues band. In The Real Frank Zappa Book, Zappa wrote [...] "I {{could see through the}} window that he was scrambling toward the phone to call his boss—probably saying: 'Well, uh, not exactly a [...] "white blues band", but... sort of.'" [...] In a 1968 article written for Hit Parader magazine, Zappa wrote that when Wilson heard these songs, [...] "he was so impressed he got on the phone and called New York, and as a result I got a more or less unlimited budget to do this monstrosity." [...] Freak Out! is an early example of the concept album, a sardonic farce about rock music and America. [...] "All the songs on it were about something", Zappa wrote in The Real Frank Zappa Book. [...] "It wasn't <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a hit single and we needed to build some filler around it. Each tune had a function within an overall satirical concept." ...|$|E
2500|$|Also in this game, Maradona {{scored a}} second goal, voted in 2002 {{as the best}} goal in World Cup history, before English striker Gary Lineker pulled one back, but England could not score again and lost 2–1. Despite the skill of his second goal, Maradona wrote in his {{autobiography}} that, [...] "I sometimes think I preferred the one with my hand... It was a bit like stealing the wallet of the English." [...] He also wrote, {{in reference to the}} Falklands conflict, that [...] "it was <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> beaten a country, not just a football team... Although we had said before the game that football {{had nothing to do with}} the Malvinas war, we knew they had killed a lot of Argentine boys there, killed them like little birds. And this was revenge." ...|$|E
60|$|During perhaps {{half an hour}} we two went {{steadily}} but cautiously forward, {{and then}} {{it seemed to me}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> should <b>have</b> arrived at the spot from which the shots had come.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's no use," [...] groaned Andy, as {{he stopped}} to catch his breath. [...] "We are stuck <b>as</b> hard <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> were planted here, and it looks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> would <b>have</b> to remain here for some time." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{were all}} so near death just then that it surely seemed <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> should <b>have</b> {{forgiveness}} in our hearts for such as Cox, lest we be denied that same boon in the next world.|$|R
60|$|Farrar and I gasped: it was <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> tumbled {{into the}} Washita.|$|E

5000|$|An {{editorial}} {{published by}} the Evansville Courier & Press on January 15, 2008 asked - [...] " [...] Are the proposed penalties of decades in prison appropriate? It's easy to demand Draconian sentences, until it's your teenager who gets caught". It suggested that there were other, more pressing, concerns for Indiana's lawmakers during the 2008 legislative session, saying - [...] "Crouch's bill instead should be referred to a study committee for hearings this summer, {{with an eye to}} considering it in the 2009 session. It's not <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> an epidemic of Salvia divinorum abuse that requires immediate action." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2009, in Series 5, Week 10 of The Apprentice, contestants {{were posted}} to the Ideal World {{shopping}} channel by Lord Sugar and tasked with selling as much product on TV as possible. One apprentice, in a break, when describing {{it as such}} a difficult task said, [...] "It's not <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> been to the University of Lincoln where {{they learn how to}} do all this stuff..." [...] Several graduates from the Media Production degree at Lincoln had gone on to work at Ideal World and the apprentices had learnt of this during their visit.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can hold}} on here {{a good bit}} longer; but {{you wanted to know}} if there was any change, an' there is. It looks to me <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> should <b>have</b> more of a breeze than <b>we</b> <b>had</b> last night." ...|$|R
60|$|She was {{perfectly}} unembarrassed and unaffected. We fell as easily into talk <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> been friends instead of strangers.|$|E
60|$|We found {{ourselves}} {{outside in the}} dark blue night, shaken and dazed <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> fallen into it from some high tower.|$|E

6000|$|... "O, come, Augustine! <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> hadn't <b>had</b> {{enough of}} that abominable, contemptible Hayti!* The Haytiens were not Anglo Saxons; {{if they had been}} there would have been another story.

60|$|The little whipper-snapper {{poked his}} nose into the cuddy, {{and pretended to}} be nearly {{overcome}} by the odor of the place, therefore he sent the marines below to overturn everything in the bunks, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> believing <b>we</b> <b>had</b> somebody hidden there.|$|R

5000|$|Part {{three of}} the Arusha Declaration espouses the {{importance}} of national self-reliance and debates the nature of development. Asserting that “A poor man does not use Money as a Weapon”, the Arusha Declaration identifies the heart of economic struggle:"We have chosen the wrong weapon for our struggle, because we chose money as our weapon. We are trying to overcome our economic weakness by using the weapons of the economically strong - weapons which in fact we do not possess. By our thoughts, words and actions it appears <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{come to the conclusion}} that without money we cannot bring about the revolution we are aiming at. It is <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> said, “Money is the basis of development. Without money, there can be no development" [...] (Publicity Section, TANU, Dar es Salaam, 1967, p. 5).Secondly, no amount of money, whether it is accrued through taxation, foreign aid or private investment, will ever be enough to achieve the development targets and independence needs of a nation (Publicity Section, TANU, Dar es Salaam, 1967). The essential and true nature of development is this: “The development of a country is brought about by people, not by money. Money, and the wealth it represents, is the result and not the basis of development.” In addition to people, the prerequisites of development are land, good policies and good leadership and the necessary condition and root of development are the hard work and intelligence of the people (Publicity Section, TANU, Dar es Salaam, 1967).|$|R
5000|$|... "We who {{are asleep}} must open {{our eyes and}} look about us. We must not accept the {{injustice}} of our enslavement by telling ourselves it is our fate, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> no true feelings; we must dare {{to stand up for}} change. We must crush all these institutions that use caste to bully us into submission, and demonstrate that among human beings there are none who are high or low. Those who have found their happiness by exploiting us are not going to go easily. It is <b>we</b> who <b>have</b> to place them where they belong and bring about a changed and just society where all are equal." [...] — Bama in Karukku (2012).|$|R
6000|$|Sire, there's {{no means}} of fencing with the flames. [...] My creed is that these scurvy Muscovites [...] Knowing our men's repute for recklessness, [...] Have fired the town, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> 'twere <b>we</b> <b>had</b> done it, [...] As by our own crazed act! ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Now, don't {{say a word}} {{more about}} our being away--especially if Slugger and Nappy and Codfish come this way. Act just <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> been here right along." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we can't, an' {{it looks}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> might <b>have</b> {{to stay here}} a long while, unless they {{get the best of}} us. Nobody will think of coming to look for us for a good many hours, an' that's why I said we were in a fix." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Once, for {{a little}} while, it looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> should <b>have</b> to do without them, and somehow I wasn't very much alarmed.

5000|$|As for the {{instrumental}} {{nature of the}} band, Herweg states that [...] "I think there are limitations that come with <b>having</b> a vocalist. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> some big burly man in front screaming, we'd be classified <b>as</b> metal. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> some scrawny guy we'd be emo. As it is, no one can pin us down." ...|$|R
