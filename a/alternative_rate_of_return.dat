A framework for credit constraints {{along the lines}} of Kiyotaki and Moore (1997) illustrates the potential regime shift in the credit risk assessments of mortgagees. Depending on the relationship between house price growth and the <b>alternative</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> the weight given to collateral and debt-servicing ability may vary according to the house price cycle as mortgagees engage in search-for-yield. Regime shifts might come about when house price appreciation is expected and risk assessments ignore debt-servicing ability, fuelled by competition for mortgage market shares and expansionary monetary policy. In the case of regime shifts increased house price growth might stimulate owner-occupation and LTV-ratios and induce mortgage procyclicalit...|$|E

Additionally, it aims to measure the opportunity cost of the subsidy in relation to an alternative application in the transportation sector. The model, database, and software from the General Equilibrium Analysis Project of the Brazilian Economy (PAEG) are applied to the simulations. The result shows that the IRE policy provides economic growth in the Midwestern, Northeastern and Southern regions above the cost of the policy. Besides, in the Northern and Southeastern regions, there is a decrease in the GDP. For Brazil, the policy is cost-effective and offers a 34 % rate of return. Furthermore, all regions benefit in terms of welfare. For the country, in terms of GDP or welfare, spending on the IRE has negative <b>alternative</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> when applied to the transportation sector.

Soil expectation values were used to determine the financially optimal thinning and final harvesting schedules (including rotation length, and the timing, frequency and intensity of thinning). Two stumpage price assumptions were made: market price and premium price for pruned, clear sawlogs. Five site indices (50 to 90) and six real <b>alternative</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> (ARR) (2. 5 to 15. 0 %) were employed.

For low-density management, a $ 100 /mbf price increase for sawtimber does not affect the optimal thinning and harvesting schedules in any recognizable pattern...|$|R

Electric utility companies have the options of reducing their use of fossil fuels, switching to alternative energy sources, increasing efficiency, or offsetting carbon emissions. This study determined the cost and profitability of sequestering carbon in green ash plantations, {{and the number of}} tons of carbon that can be sequestered. The profitability of green ash is $ 2, 342 and $ 3, 645 per acre on site indices (measurement of soil quality) 65 and 105 land, respectively, calculated with a 2. 5 % <b>alternative</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> (ARR). These figures shift to –$ 248 and –$ 240 calculated with a 15. 0 % ARR. If landowners who have an ARR of 2. 5 % can sell carbon credits for $ 10 per ton of carbon, profits will increase by $ 107 per acre on poor sites and $ 242 on good sites. Over one rotation (cutting cycle), 38. 56 net tons of carbon can be sequestered on an acre of poor quality land and 51. 35 tons on good quality land. The cost of sequestering carbon, without including revenues from timber production and carbon credits, ranges from a high of $ 15. 20 per ton on poor sites to $ 14. 41 on good sites, calculated with a 2. 5 % ARR; to a high of $ 8. 51 per ton on poor sites to $ 7. 63 on good sites, calculated with a 15. 0 % ARR.

40|$|The State of Texas emits more {{carbon dioxide}} (C 02) into the {{atmosphere}} {{than any other state}} in the United States. With environmental concerns escalating, the U. S. may be forced to reduce its emissions of greenhouse gases. The first target of these reductions will likely be utility companies that utilize coalfired power plants. In order to mitigate CO 2 emissions, utility companies may want to either purchase carbon credits which can be obtained through carbon sequestration on NIPF lands or manage reclaimed mined lands for maximum carbon sequestration. This study determined the financially optimal planting density and management regimes for loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) planted on reclaimed mined lands and NIPF lands in East Texas given the objectives of maximizing revenue from timber production and the combination of timber production and carbon sequestration. PTAEDA 2, a forest stand growth simulator, was used to predict growth and yield from establishment to final harvest. Dynamic computer programming was used to perform economic analyses given current stumpage prices, management costs, and real price and cost increases. Other inputs used include planting densities 5 X 10, 6 X 10, 7 X 10, and 8 X 10 feet, site indices 50 - 90. either 0, 1, or 2 thinnings, thinning intensities of 20, 25, 30, or 35 percent of basal area removed, carbon values per ton of $ 0, $ 10, $ 50, and $ 100, and rotations of up to 60 years in length.

40|$|The U. S. D. I. Office of Surface Mining (OSM) {{estimates}} {{that there are}} approximately 1 million acres of abandoned mine land (AML) in the Appalachian region. AML lands are classified as areas that were inadequately reclaimed or were left unreclaimed prior {{to the passage of}} the 1977 Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, and where no federal or state laws require any further reclamation responsibility to any company or individual. Reclamation and afforestation of these sites have the potential to provide landowners with cyclical timber revenues, generate environmental benefits to surrounding communities, and sequester carbon in the terrestrial ecosystem. Through a memorandum of understanding, the OSM and the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) have decided to investigate reclaiming and afforesting these lands for the purpose of mitigating the negative effects of anthropogenic carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This study determined the carbon sequestration potential of northern red oak (Quercus rubra L.), one of the major reclamation as well as commercial species, planted on West Virginia AML sites. Analyses were conducted to (1) calculate the total number of tons that can be stored, (2) determine the cost per ton to store carbon, and (3) calculate the profitability of managing these forests for timber production alone and for timber production and carbon storage together. The Forest Management Optimizer (FORMOP) was used to simulate growth data on diameter, height, and volume for northern red oak. Variables used in this study included site indices ranging from 40 to 80 (base age 50), thinning frequencies of 0, 1, and 2, thinning percentages of 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40, and a maximum rotation length of 100 years. Real <b>alternative</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> (ARR) ranging from 0. 5 % to 12. 5 % were chosen for the economic analyses. A total of 769, 248 thinning and harvesting combinations, net present worths, and soil expectation values were calculated in this study. Results indicate that the cost per ton to sequester carbon ranges from $ 6. 54 on site index 80 land at a 12. 5 % ARR to $ 36. 68 on site index 40 land at an ARR of 0. 5 %. Results also indicate that the amount of carbon stored during one rotation ranges between 38 tons per acre on site index 40 land to 58 tons per acre on site index 80 land.

40|$|A {{regional}} range {{development project}} {{has been established in}} southern and southeastern Ethiopia, and the planning area has been jointly studied by the Imperial Ethiopian Government and the United States Agency for International Development (JSAID). I have been associated with both the feasibility studies and the actual implementation of the program from 1965 to 1969, and this experience with the project provided data for this dissertation. The area is inhabited by different ethnic groups who are almost all nomadic and have a subsistence life based on production of various classes of livestock. They have great variability in customs, religions, social and cultural beliefs, and languages. Excellent beef cattle are indigenous to the region, but there are many current cattle production and management problems in southern and southeastern Ethiopia. Among the most critical problems are diseases, poor nutrition, and lack of organized marketing. Lack of water is also a limiting factor; it causes shortage of roughage, lack of proper nutrition, retarded reproduction, high mortality, especially among young individuals, lack of surplus animals for market, and no contribution to national revenue. To solve some of the existing problems, the Imperial Ethiopian Government initiated a water development program in the early 1960 Is, but because of the type of planning, there was very little economic benefit from the investment for range water development. There were no real defined objectives other than the provision of water to cattle with no management and maintenance once the initial construction was done. Water development in combination with veterinary service to solve the water shortage and disease problems was analyzed in this dissertation. Objectives were: to describe the existing physical, social, and cultural conditions in southern and southeastern Ethiopia; to analyze the economics of veterinary services and water development with and without management; and to discuss management and social changes necessary to insure that water development accomplishes desirable economic and social changes. Three development alternatives were considered and analyzed. The three alternatives were: mobile veterinary service, mobile veterinary service plus water development, and mobile veterinary service plus water development and management. A rate-of-return analysis was used in evaluating the economics of the development alternatives. Each alternative was analyzed for four different grazing capacities and six different percentage increases in sales each 5 years in addition to the basic 37 annual sale that now exists. Thus, 72 different sets <b>of</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> data were obtained. Under no circumstance should the planning rangeland be exploited and mismanaged through overgrazing and other improper management practices. With capital resources in short supply and long planning periods, exploitation of available range resources was not considered as an appropriate <b>alternative.</b> <b>Rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> greater than the 47 to meet the Government's return on investment would indicate the presence of net income to achieve social, cultural, and economic changes among producers in the planning area. At 4 %, the Government will recover the money invested for development, but the producers may not gain from the investment. Based on an economic analysis of each of the three development alternatives, the best alternative satisfying the objectives as outlined in this dissertation would be the development with management alternative. With 2560 animal units per year per management unit grazing capacity, and with a 47 increase in animal sales each 5 years, desired objectives would be met. Based on the economic analyses made in this dissertation and if specific livestock sale goals are met {{in the early years of}} a project, a suitable annual payment scheme to recover development and maintenance costs while still providing economic incentives to producers could be formulated...|$|R

We show that despite fundamental differences in the underlying <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> processes ((i) or (ii)), the resulting pricing formulas for the guarantees are remarkably similar. Finally, we show how the term structure models of Vasicek (1977) and Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1985) occur as special cases in our more general framework based {{on the model of}} Heath, Jarrow, and Morton (1992) ...|$|R
