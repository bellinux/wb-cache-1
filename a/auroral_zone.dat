A region that currently displays an aurora is called the auroral oval, a band displaced towards the nightside of the Earth. Early evidence for a geomagnetic connection comes from the statistics of auroral observations. Elias Loomis (1860), and later Hermann Fritz (1881) and S.

25|$|Auroras seen {{within the}} auroral oval may be {{directly}} overhead, but from farther away they illuminate the poleward horizon as a greenish glow, or sometimes a faint red, {{as if the}} Sun were rising from an unusual direction.

40|$|Local-time {{survey of}} the {{low-energy}} proton and electron intensities precipitated into the earth's atmosphere over the <b>auroral</b> <b>zones</b> during periods of magnetic quiescence. This survey was constructed by selecting a typical individual satellite crossing of this region in each of eight local-time sectors from a large library of similar observations with the polar-orbiting satellite Injun 5. The trapping boundary for more-energetic electron intensities, E greater than 45 keV, {{was found to be}} a 'natural coordinate' for delineating the boundary between the two major types of lower-energy, 50 {{less than or equal to}} E less than or equal to 15, 000 eV, electron precipitation commonly observed over the <b>auroral</b> <b>zones</b> at low altitudes. Poleward of this trapping boundary inverted 'V' electron precipitation bands are observed in all local-time sectors. These inverted 'V' electron bands in the evening and midnight sectors are typically more energetic and have greater latitudinal widths than their counterparts in the noon and morning sectors. In general, the main contributors to the electron energy influx into the earth's atmosphere over the <b>auroral</b> <b>zones</b> are the electron inverted 'V' precipitation poleward of the trapping boundary in late evening, the plasma-sheet electron intensities equatorward of this boundary in early morning, and both of these precipitation events near local midnight...|$|R

Two auroral X-ray imagers, developed for future spaceflight, will be discussed. Polar Ionospheric X-ray Imaging Experiment is scheduled for launch on the NASA International Solar-Terrestrial Physics/Global Geospace Science program POLAR satellite in May, 1994. The POLAR orbit, with an apogee and perigee of 9 and 1. 8 R(E) (earth radii), respectively, affords the opportunity to image the aurora from high altitude above the north pole continuously for several hours. The Magnetospheric Atmospheric X-ray Imaging Experiment is scheduled for launch aboard the NOAA-I satellite in late 1992. The 800 -km polar orbit passes over both the northern and southern <b>auroral</b> <b>zones</b> every 101 minutes.

25|$|In {{northern}} latitudes, {{the effect}} {{is known as the}} Aurora Borealis or the Northern Lights. The former term was coined by Galileo in 1619, from the Roman goddess of the dawn and the Greek name for the north wind. The southern counterpart, the Aurora Australis or the Southern Lights, has features that are almost identical to the Aurora Borealis and changes simultaneously with changes in the northern <b>auroral</b> <b>zone.</b> The Aurora Australis is visible from high southern latitudes in Antarctica, Chile, Argentina, New Zealand, and Australia.|$|E
25|$|The {{immediate}} {{cause of the}} ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents leading to auroral emissions was discovered in 1960, when a pioneering rocket flight from Fort Churchill in Canada revealed a flux of electrons entering the atmosphere from above. Since then an extensive collection of measurements has been acquired painstakingly and with steadily improving resolution since the 1960s by many research teams using rockets and satellites to traverse the <b>auroral</b> <b>zone.</b> The main findings have been that auroral arcs and other bright forms are due to electrons that have been accelerated during the final few 10,000km or so of their plunge into the atmosphere. These electrons often, but not always, exhibit a peak in their energy distribution, and are preferentially aligned along the local direction of the magnetic field.|$|E
2500|$|Geomagnetic {{disturbance}} from {{an enhanced}} solar wind causes distortions of the magnetotail ("magnetic substorms"). These 'substorms' tend to occur after prolonged spells (hours) {{during which the}} interplanetary magnetic field has had an appreciable southward component. This leads to {{a higher rate of}} interconnection between its field lines and those of Earth. As a result, the solar wind moves magnetic flux (tubes of magnetic field lines, 'locked' together with their resident plasma) from the day side of Earth to the magnetotail, widening the obstacle it presents to the solar wind flow and constricting the tail on the night-side. Ultimately some tail plasma can separate ("magnetic reconnection"); some blobs ("plasmoids") are squeezed downstream and are carried away with the solar wind; others are squeezed toward Earth where their motion feeds strong outbursts of auroras, mainly around midnight ("unloading process"). A geomagnetic storm resulting from greater interaction adds many more particles to the plasma trapped around Earth, also producing enhancement of the [...] "ring current". Occasionally the resulting modification of the Earth's magnetic field can be so strong that it produces auroras visible at middle latitudes, on field lines much closer to the equator than those of the <b>auroral</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|E

It is shown that during disturbed conditions the latitudinal variations of composition and gas temperature T sub g reflect the local nature of the magnetic storm heat input assumed to be primarily confined to the <b>auroral</b> <b>zones.</b> Thereby T sub g and N 2 increase, He decreases and O remains constant through the <b>auroral</b> <b>zones</b> at exospheric heights (due to the superposition of temperature and diffusion effects) in agreement with OGO- 6 mass spectrometer measurements.

2500|$|A Birkeland {{current is}} a set of {{currents}} that flow along geomagnetic field lines connecting the Earth’s magnetosphere to the Earth's high latitude ionosphere. In the Earth’s magnetosphere, the currents are driven by the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field and by bulk motions of plasma through the magnetosphere (convection indirectly driven by the interplanetary environment). The strength of the Birkeland currents changes with activity in the magnetosphere (e.g. during substorms). [...] Small scale variations in the upward current sheets (downward flowing electrons) accelerate magnetospheric electrons which, when they reach the upper atmosphere, create the Auroras Borealis and Australis. In the high latitude ionosphere (or auroral zones), the Birkeland currents close through the region of the auroral electrojet, which flows perpendicular to the local magnetic field in the ionosphere. [...] The Birkeland currents occur in two pairs of field-aligned current sheets. [...] One pair extends from noon through the dusk sector to the midnight sector. [...] The other pair extends from noon through the dawn sector to the midnight sector.

40|$|A {{review of}} {{research}} on particle precipitation into the thermosphere is presented. Particle precipitation {{plays an important role}} in thermospheric dynamics, often being both the most important ionization source and the most important heat source, comparable to Joule heating rates in the <b>auroral</b> <b>zones</b> and typically exceeding solar ultraviolet as an ionization mechanism in the nightside <b>auroral</b> <b>zones</b> and winter polar caps. Rees (1963) has shown that, roughly speaking, one electron-ion pair is produced by each 35 eV of incident electron energy flux; thus, over half of the incident electron energy flux goes into heating rather than into ionization. Precipitating ions also can produce ionization, also requiring roughly 35 eV per pair; however, since ion energy fluxes are typically much weaker than electron fluxes, they have often been neglected. The particle precipitation into the thermosphere is both an important ionization source and an important heat source; since the globally integrated value can vary over more than a factor of ten, and the instantaneous local rate can vary over nearly three orders of magnitude global, maps of precipitation rates are extremely important for predicting thermospheric weather...|$|R

The planet's <b>auroral</b> <b>zones</b> and its disk are powerful sources of x-ray emission, though with different origins. Chandra observations discovered x-ray emission from the Io plasma torus and from the Galilean moons Io, Europa, and possibly Ganymede. The emission from the moons is due to bombardment of their surfaces by highly energetic magnetospheric protons, and oxygen and sulfur ions, producing fluorescent x-ray emission lines from the elements in their surfaces against an intense background continuum.
