[...] Oceanic crust attached to a continental margin subducts beneath an island arc. Pre-ophiolitic ocean crust is generated by a back-arc basin. The collision of the continent and island arc initiates a new subduction zone at the back-arc basin, dipping {{in the opposite direction}} as the first. The created ophiolite becomes the tip of the new subduction’s forearc and is uplifted (over the accretionary wedge) by detachment and compression. Verification of the two above hypotheses requires further research, as do the other hypotheses available in current literature on the subject.|$|E

5000|$|The {{operation}} {{of taking the}} common norm of a quaternion is represented with the letter N. By definition the common norm {{is the product of}} a quaternion with its conjugate. It can be proven that common norm is equal to the square of the tensor of a quaternion. However this proof does not constitute a definition. Hamilton gives exact, independent definitions of both the common norm and the tensor. This norm was adopted <b>as</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>from</b> the theory of numbers, however to quote Hamilton [...] "they will not often be wanted". The tensor is generally of greater utility. The word norm does not appear in Lectures on Quaternions, and only twice in the table of contents of Elements of Quaternions.|$|E

We {{consider a}} category of finite crystals of a quantum affine algebra whose objects are not necessarily perfect, and set of paths, semi-infinite tensor product of an object of this category with a certain boundary condition.

40|$|The {{competition}} between spin-triplet and singlet pairings is studied theoretically for the tight-binding α-β bands in Sr_ 2 RuO_ 4, which arise from {{two sets of}} quasi-one dimensional Fermi surfaces. Using multiband FLEX approximation, where we incorporate an anisotropy in the spin fluctuations <b>as</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>from</b> experiments, we show that (i) the triplet can dominate over the singlet (which {{turns out to be}} extended s), and (ii) the triplet gap function optimized in the Eliashberg equation has an unusual, very non-sinusoidal form, whose time-reversal-broken combination exhibits a crib-shaped amplitude with dips.

40|$|As a new {{and clean}} probe to the {{strongly}} interacting quark-gluon plasma (sQGP), we propose an azimuthal correlation of an electron and a muon which originate from the semileptonic decay of charm and bottom quarks. By solving the Langevin equation for the heavy quarks under the hydrodynamic evolution of the hot plasma, we show that substantial quenching of the away-side peak in the electron-muon correlation can be seen if the sQGP drag force acting on heavy quarks is large enough <b>as</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>from</b> the gauge/gravity correspondence. The effect could be detected in high-energy heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and the Large Hadron Collider. Comment: 4 pages, 2 figure...|$|E

40|$|Using spectroscopic {{techniques}} {{we studied}} {{the effect of}} the nucleophilic reagents cyanide, cyanate and thiocyanate on three flavo-oxidases namely alcohol oxidase (AO), glucose oxidase (GOX) and D-amino acid oxidase (DAOX). All three ions, added at concentrations in the mM range, caused release of the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) co-factors from the enzyme molecules. In the case of AO this was accompanied by significant conformational perturbations, which was not observed for GOX and DAOX. <b>As</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>from</b> fluorescence, absorption and circular dichroism spectral changes at least one phenolic hydroxyl group became ionized upon FAD release from AO and a new class of Trp residues, fluorescent only in apo-AO protein, was demasked. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This paper {{develops}} {{a theoretical framework}} for an explanation of how exploitation and exploration build on each other, in a ‘cycle of discovery’, developed in earlier research. The framework is tested empirically, {{in the sense of}} seeing whether it can help to reconstruct and understand the emergence of the pharmaceutical industry. One of the conclusions is that whereas recent literature stresses the idiosyncratic nature of the biotechnological revolution, our analysis seems to reveal that this {{does not seem to be}} as unique <b>as</b> <b>suggested.</b> <b>From</b> this, we conclude that the theoretical framework we propose, serves its purpose of explanation. But there are also some lessons for improving it. Keywords: Exploration; Exploitation; Pharmaceutical biotechnology; Sectoral system...|$|E
30|$|In summary, {{microanalysis}} of {{the samples}} taken from the three objects investigated confirm the presence of madder lake, prepared from Rubia spp., and Egyptian blue <b>as</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>from</b> the UVL/VIVL and VIL images, respectively. In addition, these investigations {{have shown that the}} cooler toned pinks or purple tones observed in two of the objects (Terracotta A and C) are in fact mixtures of these two pigments. Evidence for this can be seen by comparing the UVL/VIVL and VIL images, where even single particles of the blue pigment can be observed in the VIL image in the areas where these samples were taken. In one of these cases (Terracotta C), the mixture also contained an additional pink colorant, likely to be derived from an insect source.|$|E
