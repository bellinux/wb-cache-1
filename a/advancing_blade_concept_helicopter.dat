40|$|A {{full-scale}} XH- 59 A <b>advancing</b> <b>blade</b> <b>concept</b> <b>helicopter</b> {{was tested}} in Ames Research Center's 40 by 80 foot wind tunnel. The helicopter was tested with the rotor on and off, rotor hub fairings on and off, interrotor shaft fairing on and off, rotor instrumentation module on and off, and auxiliary propulsion thrust on and off. An advance ratio range of 0. 25 and 0. 45 with the rotor on and from 60 to 180 knots with the rotor off was investigated.

50|$|The <b>Advancing</b> <b>Blade</b> <b>Concept</b> system {{consisted}} of two rigid, contra-rotating rotors (30 inches apart) which made use of the aerodynamic lift of the <b>advancing</b> <b>blades.</b> At high speeds, the retreating blades were offloaded, {{as most of the}} load was supported by the <b>advancing</b> <b>blades</b> of both rotors and the penalty due to stall of the retreating blade was thus eliminated. This system did not require a wing to be fitted for high speeds and to improve maneuverability, and also eliminated the need for an anti-torque rotor at the tail. Forward thrust was provided by two turbojets, which allowed the main rotor to only be required to provide lift. It was found to have good hover stability against crosswind and tailwind. With jets installed, it lacked power to hover out of ground effect and used short take-off and landing for safety reasons.|$|R
40|$|The <b>Advancing</b> <b>Blade</b> <b>Concept</b> (ABC) uses two rigid counterrotating rotors in a coaxial {{arrangement}} {{to provide}} <b>advancing</b> <b>blades</b> {{on both sides}} of the aircraft. This makes use of the high dynamic pressure on the advancing side of the rotors at high forward speed, virtually ignoring the low dynamic pressure on the retreating side, while still keeping the rotor system in roll trim. Theoretically such a rotor system will maintain its lift potential as speed increases. The XH- 59 A was designed to investigate this theory. A description is provided of the flight test program from May, 1980 to January, 1981. A summary is presented of the knowledge gained throughout the entire program, and current pitfalls are reviewed. It is concluded that the ABC has been verified, with the XH- 59 A envelope of blade lift coefficient as a function of advance ratio greatly exceeding that of conventional helicopter rotor systems...|$|R
40|$|Acoustic {{data were}} {{obtained}} during a full-scale test of the XH- 59 A <b>Advancing</b> <b>Blade</b> <b>Concept</b> (ABC) Technology Demonstrator in the NASA Ames 40 - by 80 -Foot Wind Tunnel. The XH- 59 A is a research helicopter with two coaxial rotors and hingeless blades. Performance, vibration, noise at various forward speeds, rotor lift coefficients, and rotor shaft angles of attack were investigated. In general, the noise level is shown to increase with rotor lift coefficient except under certain operating conditions where it is increased by significant impulsive blade/vortex interactions. The impulsivity appears to depend upon how the lift is distributed between the two rotors. The noise levels measured are shown to be slightly higher than on a modern conventional rotor tested in the same facility...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of lift offset {{on the performance}} of several rotorcraft configurations is explored. A lift-offset rotor, or <b>advancing</b> <b>blade</b> <b>concept,</b> is a hingeless rotor that can attain good efficiency at high speed by operating with more lift on the advancing side than on the retreating side of the rotor disk. The calculated performance capability of modern-technology coaxial rotors utilizing a lift offset is examined, including rotor performance optimized for hover and high-speed cruise. The ideal induced power loss of coaxial rotors in hover and twin rotors in forward flight is presented. The aerodynamic modeling requirements for performance calculations are evaluated, including wake and drag models for the high-speed flight condition. The {{influence of}} configuration {{on the performance of}} rotorcraft with lift-offset rotors is explored, considering tandem and side-by-side rotorcraft as well as wing-rotor lift share...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the Rotorcraft Convertible Engine Study was to define future research and technology effort required for commercial development by 1988 of convertible fan/shaft gas turbine engines for unconventional rotorcraft transports. Two rotorcraft and their respective missions were defined: a Fold Tilt Rotor aircraft and an <b>Advancing</b> <b>Blade</b> <b>Concept</b> (ABC) rotorcraft. Sensitivity studies were conducted with these rotorcraft to determine parametrically the influence of propulsion characteristics on aircraft size, mission fuel requirements, and direct operating costs (DOC).

The XH- 59 A is a research helicopter with two coaxial rotors and hingeless blades.

40|$|A {{validation}} {{study on the}} performance and vibration analyses of the XH- 59 A compound helicopter is conducted to establish techniques for the comprehensive analysis of lift-offset compound helicopters. This study considers the XH- 59 A lift-offset compound helicopter using a rigid coaxial rotor system as a verification model. CAMRAD II (Comprehensive Analytical Method of Rotorcraft Aerodynamics and Dynamics II), a comprehensive analysis code, {{is used as a}} tool for the performance, vibration, and loads analyses. A general free wake model, which is a more sophisticated wake model than other wake models, is used to obtain good results for the comprehensive analysis.

5000|$|Sikorsky {{developed}} the X2 helicopter on a $50 million budget. The design includes expertise gathered from several earlier design projects. The S-69/XH-59A <b>Advancing</b> <b>Blade</b> <b>Concept</b> Demonstrator {{had shown that}} high speed was possible with a coaxial helicopter with auxiliary propulsion (two jet engines), but that vibration and fuel consumption was excessive; the Cypher UAV expanded the company's knowledge of the unique aspects of coaxial flight control laws with a fly-by-wire aircraft; and the RAH-66 Comanche developed expertise in composite rotors and advanced transmission design. Other features include slowed [...] "de-swirling" [...] rigid rotors two feet apart, active force counter-vibration inspired by the Black Hawk, and using most of the power in forward flight for the pusher propeller rather than the rotor. Test flights and flight simulations were combined to improve test procedure. The fly-by-wire system is provided by Honeywell, the rotor by Eagle Aviation Technologies, anti-vibration technology from Moog Inc, and propeller by Aero Composites. The rotor hub can have 10-20 times the drag of the blade. Sikorsky intended to test hub fairings to reduce drag by 40%, and test flew fairings on the hubs themselves but not the central hub fairing ("aero sail") in between the hubs. Sikorsky has since patented a [...] "Standpipe" [...] (fixed tube between rotating rotor axes) suitable for a central hub fairing.|$|R
