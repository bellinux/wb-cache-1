5|$|Between June 1990 and 1998, Highway401 and Interstate75 {{were used}} for <b>a</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>project</b> named Advantage I-75 to test the {{reliability}} and versatility of an automated tracking system for transport trucks. Termed MACS for Mainline Automated Clearance System, it would allow a truck to travel from Florida to Ontario without a second inspection.|$|E

5|$|Sellers {{can also}} do trade-ins {{in-person}} and get reimbursed immediately at partnered retailers like Target. The Target trade-in program began as <b>a</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>project</b> in 2009, and expanded to 190 locations by 2010 and almost 1,500 stores by 2011. A similar partnership {{was in place}} with Circuit City before it {{went out of business}} in 2009. A company spokesperson stated in 2009 that the company was also partnered with 15 smaller retailers for in-person trade-ins.|$|E
5|$|Work {{with the}} system started in 1995, when the Norwegian Board of Health Supervision took {{initiative}} for a new mobile telecommunications platform. The issue was coordinated by the Ministry of Justice, and the issue was first discussed politically in 1997, and in 1998 a project group was created. In 2001, <b>a</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>project</b> was established in Trondheim, which included all three agencies. The trial was successful and terminated in June 2003. Later that year, the Parliament of Norway made the principal decision to establish the network. Quality control {{of the project was}} concluded in June 2004, and construction was estimated at NOK3.6 billion.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, the {{government}} of New York City installed Wi-Fi routers at 10 payphones in the city (seven in Manhattan, two in Brooklyn, and one in Queens) as part of <b>a</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>project.</b> The Wi-Fi was free of charge and available for use at all times. The Wi-Fi signal was detectable from a radius {{of a few hundred}} feet (about 100m). Two of New York City's largest advertising companies—Van Wagner and Titan, who collectively owned more than 9,000 of New York City's 12,000 payphones at the time—paid $2,000 per router, with no monetary input from either the city or taxpayers. While the payphones participating in the Wi-Fi pilot project were poorly marked, the Wi-Fi offered at these payphones was significantly faster than some of the other free public Wi-Fi networks offered elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|Osteogenesis imperfecta, {{known as}} brittle bone disease, is an incurable genetic bone {{disorder}} {{which can be}} lethal. Those with the disease are unable to make functional connective bone tissue. This is most commonly due to a mutation in Type-I collagen, which fulfills a variety of structural roles and is the most abundant protein in mammals. The mutation causes a deformation in collagen's triple helix structure, which if not naturally destroyed, leads to abnormal and weakened bone tissue. In 2005, Folding@home tested a new quantum mechanical method that improved upon prior simulation methods, and which may be useful for future computing studies of collagen. Although researchers have used Folding@home to study collagen folding and misfolding, the interest stands as <b>a</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>project</b> compared to Alzheimer's and Huntington's research.|$|E
5|$|The roman {{designs of}} Garamond which are his most imitated {{were based on}} a font cut around 1495 for the Venetian printer Aldus Manutius by {{engraver}} Francesco Griffo. This was first used in the book De Aetna, a short work by poet and cleric Pietro Bembo which was Manutius' first printing in the Latin alphabet after a long series of publications of classics of Greek literature that won him an international reputation. Historian Beatrice Warde has assessed De Aetna as something of <b>a</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>project,</b> a small book printed to a higher standard than Manutius' norm. Among other details, this font popularised the idea that in printing the cross-stroke of the 'e' should be level instead of slanting upwards to the right like handwriting, something imitated in almost all type designs since.|$|E
