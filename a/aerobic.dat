5|$|Although oxygen once {{promoted}} {{nitrogen fixation}} by making molybdenum available in water, it also directly poisons nitrogenase enzymes. Thus, in Earth's ancient history, after oxygen arrived {{in large quantities}} in Earth's air and water, organisms that continued to fix nitrogen in <b>aerobic</b> conditions isolated and protected their nitrogen-fixing enzymes from too much oxygen in heterocysts or equivalent structures. This structural isolation of nitrogen fixation reactions in <b>aerobic</b> organisms continues to the present.|$|E
5|$|Most studies {{consider}} dinosaurs as endothermic (warm-blooded) animals, with {{an elevated}} metabolism {{comparable to that}} of today's mammals and birds. In a 2009 study, Herman Pontzer and colleagues calculated the <b>aerobic</b> endurance of various dinosaurs. Even at moderate running speeds, Heterodontosaurus would have exceeded the maximum <b>aerobic</b> capabilities possible for an ectotherm (cold-blooded) animal, indicating endothermy in this genus.|$|E
5|$|Skin {{toxicity}} evolved alongside bright coloration, perhaps preceding it. Toxicity {{may have}} relied on a shift in diet to alkaloid-rich arthropods, which likely occurred {{at least four times}} among the dendrobatids. Conspicuous coloration in these frogs is further associated with diet specialization, body mass, <b>aerobic</b> capacity, and chemical defense. Either aposematism and <b>aerobic</b> capacity preceded greater resource gathering, making it easier for frogs to go out and gather the ants and mites required for diet specialization, contrary to classical aposematic theory, which assumes that toxicity from diet arises before signaling. Alternatively, diet specialization preceded higher <b>aerobic</b> capacity, and aposematism evolved to allow dendrobatids to gather resources without predation.|$|E

40|$|Although feminist {{researchers}} have critiqued <b>aerobics</b> as {{an activity that}} maintains ideologies of female inferiority, many women, including feminists, attend, participate in, and enjoy <b>aerobics</b> classes. This research provides a preliminary exploration {{of the extent to}} which women can exercise agency within the gendered constraints of <b>aerobics.</b> The 10 feminist exercisers inter-viewed use strategies for participation that both downplay oppressive aspects of and enhance personal empowerment in their <b>aerobics</b> classes. These strate-gies include distancing, rejecting the critique, asserting agency, and making do. The women’s ability to enjoy a practice while constantly remaking it to suit their own purposes is indicative of the way women often must live their lives within a misogynistic, patriarchal culture. <b>Aerobics</b> is one of the few physical activities in which women areencouraged unequivocally to participate.

5000|$|While {{similar to}} land <b>aerobics,</b> {{in that it}} focuses on cardiac training, water <b>aerobics</b> differs in that it adds the {{component}} of water resistance and buoyancy.

5|$|A related {{problem for}} <b>aerobic</b> organisms is {{oxidative}} stress.

5|$|Little {{is known}} about the social {{behavior}} of H. suspectum, but they have been observed engaging in male-male combat, in which the dominant male lies on top of the subordinate one and pins it with its front and hind limbs. Both lizards arch their bodies, pushing against each other and twisting around in an effort to gain the dominant position. A wrestling match ends when the pressure exerted forces them to separate, although bouts may be repeated one after the other. These bouts are typically observed just before the mating season. Those with greater strength and endurance are thought to win more often and enjoy greater reproductive success. Although the Gila monster has a low metabolism and one of the lowest lizard sprint speeds, it {{has one of the highest}} <b>aerobic</b> scope values (the increase in oxygen consumption from rest to maximum metabolic exertion) among lizards, allowing them to engage in intense <b>aerobic</b> activity for a sustained period of time. Males have been observed to have higher <b>aerobic</b> scopes than females, presumably because of sexual selection for a trait advantageous in prolonged combat. The Gila monster may live up to 20 years in the wild, or 30 in captivity.|$|E
