50|$|A mode {{of toxic}} {{action is a}} common set of {{physiological}} and behavioral signs that characterize a type of adverse biological response. A mode of action {{should not be confused with}} mechanism of action, which refer to the biochemical processes underlying a given mode of <b>action.</b> <b>Modes</b> of toxic action are important, widely used tools in ecotoxicology and aquatic toxicology because they classify toxicants or pollutants according to their type of toxic action. There are two major types of modes of toxic action: non-specific acting toxicants and specific acting toxicants. Non-specific acting toxicants are those that produce narcosis, while specific acting toxicants are those that are non-narcotic and that produce a specific action at a specific target site.|$|E

40|$|In human adults the use {{of visual}} {{information}} for selecting appropriate <b>modes</b> for <b>action</b> appears to be separate from {{the use of}} visual information for the control of movements of which the action is composed (Milner & Goodale, [1995] The visual brain in action; [2008] Neuropsychologia 46 : 774 - 785). More specifically, <b>action</b> <b>mode</b> selection primarily relies upon allocentric information, whereas movement control mainly exploits egocentric information. In the present study, we investigated to what degree this division is already present in 6 - to 10 -month-old infants when reaching for moving objects; that is, whether allocentric information is uniquely exploited for <b>action</b> <b>mode</b> selection (i. e., reaching with one or the other hand) or whether it is also used for movement control (i. e., reaching kinematics). Infants were presented with laterally approaching objects at two speeds (i. e., 20 and 40 [*]cm/s) against a stationary or moving background. Background motion affects allocentric information about the object's velocity relative to its background. Results indicated that object speed constrained both infants' <b>action</b> <b>mode</b> selection and movement control. Importantly, however, the influence of background motion was limited to <b>action</b> <b>mode</b> selection and did not extend to movement control. The findings provide further support for the contention that during early development information usage is-at least to some degree-separated for <b>action</b> <b>mode</b> selection and movement control...|$|R

40|$|The {{functional}} decline in action among older adults is caused {{not only by}} physical weakness but also by cognitive decline. In this study, we aimed to compare the cognitive effects of age between intention-based and stimulus-based <b>action</b> <b>modes</b> electrophysiologically. Because age-related declines in cognitive function might proceed distinctly according to specific <b>action</b> <b>modes</b> and processes, four specific cognitive processes, action-effect binding, stimulus-response linkage, action-effect feedback control, and effect-action retrieval, were investigated. We recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) during a modified acquisition-test paradigm in young (mean age = 21, SD = 2) and old (mean age = 69, SD = 5) groups. A temporal bisection task and a movement pre-cuing task were used during the acquisition and test phases, respectively. Using ERP indices including readiness potential (RP), P 3, N 2 and contingent negative variation (CNV) to identify these four specific processes for the two <b>action</b> <b>modes,</b> we revealed the effects of age on each ERP index. The results showed similar patterns of waveforms but consistently decreasing amplitudes of all four ERP indices in the old age group compared with the young age group, which indicates not only generally declining functions of action preparation in older adults but also age effects specific to the <b>action</b> <b>modes</b> and processes {{that might otherwise be}} mixed together under confounding experimental conditions. Particularly, an interference effect indexed by the differences in the amplitudes of CNV between congruent and incongruent tasks was observed in the young age group, which is consistent with previous behavioral reports. However, this effect was absent in the old age group, indicating a specific age-related deficit in the effect-action retrieval process of intention-based action, which might be caused by an age-related deficit in associative memory. In sum, this study investigated the cognitive processes of two <b>action</b> <b>modes</b> from a developmental perspective and suggests the importance of adding associative memory training to interventions for older adults with the aim of improving intention-based action. </p...|$|E

40|$|How {{impactful}} is volleyball’s ‘serve-reception game’? Its efficacy {{has been}} found to discriminate between winning and losing a match. But how does reception become (in) effective? Based on the theoretical rationale of ecological dynamics, we e hypothesized that skilled receivers in volleyball would not display ready-made responses, but rather would co-adapt <b>action</b> <b>modes</b> during serve-reception to deal with the specific, emergent constraints of service to achieve ttask goals. In order to examine this issue we investigated whether the co-adaptation of serve and reception <b>action</b> <b>modes</b> {{was a significant predictor of}} set outcome in elite volleyball performance (win or loss), analysing the first and last sets of the 2014 World League Finals matches (897 game-sequences). The power-jump and jump-float were the serving modes observed and the overhand, underhand-lateral and underhand-frontal passes were the reception modes categorized. We found that the co- adaptation of serve and reception <b>action</b> <b>modes</b> predicted set outcome in the final set of a match. Receiving the jump-float serve with an overhand pass or underhand-lateral pass increased the odds of winning the final set by 200 per cent. Results suggested that, at an expert level, mastering the overhand pass and the underhand lateral pass gives teams a competitive edge.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the ability of the Kolbe A Index to predict learners' attitudes and achievements within a web-based training context. The Index is used to measure the conative capacities of individuals. The Index translates raw scores into four Action Modes: Fact Finder, Follow Thru, Quick Start, and Implementor. A web-based simulation of training on customer service excellence was created containing four modules designed to match the respective learning style of each of the four <b>Action</b> <b>Modes</b> suggested by the Kolbe Corporation. Research questions were as follows. To what extent do the four Kolbe A Index <b>Action</b> <b>Modes</b> predict 1) how well learners will like content formatted to match the learning styles of the four Modes, 2) how well learners will remember content formatted to match the learning styles of the four Modes, and 3) how well the learners will remember the content regardless of the format? Three experts in applications of the Kolbe A Index then validated the simulation. Five other experts, each with a Ph. D. in the social sciences, validated the evaluation of learners' attitudes and achievements. Then a pilot study to collect data for a reliability analysis was conducted. Sixty graduates from an international program in economics in Thailand participated in this study. Data were collected entirely through the Internet and in English. Multiple linear regression analyses with backward stepping method were performed to answer the research questions. Based on the limitations and data analyses of this study, the Kolbe A Index <b>Action</b> <b>Modes</b> did not predict how well learners liked content formatted to match the learning styles of the four Modes, how well learners remembered content formatted to match the learning styles of the four Modes, nor how well the learners remembered the content regardless of the format.

30|$|Furthermore, {{the action}} {{mechanism}} of D-MPI also was analyzed {{in the present}} study. The <b>action</b> <b>mode</b> of AMPs has been investigated in many studies. Many AMPs were found that they could bind with the membrane of microbes and then disrupt the integrity of cell membrane (Arnusch et al. 2012). There are mainly three models, the barrel-stave model, the toroidal pores model, and the carpet model (Chih et al. 2015), which are widely accepted to describe the membrane-active <b>action</b> <b>mode.</b> Membrane active <b>action</b> <b>mode</b> of AMPs was believed {{that it is difficult}} for microbes to develop resistance toward AMPs (Hancock and Sahl 2006). The L-counterpart of D-MPI mainly exerts its antitumor, antibacterial and antifungal activity through the disruption of the integrity of cell membrane (Wang et al. 2008, 2009, 2013, 2014). As expected, it may also exert its antimicrobial activity through disrupting the integrity of cell membrane and lead to the death of cells. This kind of cell membrane lysis action mechanism always was not dependent on the chiral recognition, which support that D-MPI retained the activity of its l-counterpart. Interestingly, all d-amino acid substitution also decreased the hemolytic activity of polybia-MPI.|$|R
