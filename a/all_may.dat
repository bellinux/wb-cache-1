St. John's Wort, sometimes recommended to help with mild to moderate depression, reduces {{the effectiveness of a}} given dose of warfarin; it induces the enzymes that break down warfarin in the body, causing a reduced anticoagulant effect.|$|E
5|$|Agathias' and Zosimus' figures, if {{they have}} any {{validity}} at <b>all,</b> <b>may</b> represent the official, as opposed to actual, strength of the Constantinian army. In reality, the slim evidence is that late units were often severely under-strength, perhaps only about two-thirds of official. Thus Agathias' 600,000 on paper may have been no more than c. 400,000 in reality. The latter figure accords well with the other global figure from ancient sources, by the 6th-century writer John Lydus, of 389,704 (excluding fleets) for the army of Diocletian. Lydus' figure is accorded greater credibility than Agathias' by scholars because of its precision (implying that it was found in an official document) {{and the fact that it}} is ascribed to a specific time period.|$|E
5|$|The novel centres on the {{character}} of Katinka Bai, a quiet, sensitive young woman married to a boisterous and somewhat vulgar station master, Bai. The marriage is barren, and she remains isolated. Almost subconsciously, she passionately longs after something undefinable. Even after the arrival of Huus, a neighbour with whom she begins to establish a promising relationship, she is unable to fulfill her passion, although {{for the first time in}} her life she falls in love. In the small provincial community where they live, neither she nor Huus dares to break the conventions they know, sad as it <b>all</b> <b>may</b> be. When they realize they cannot take their attachment any further, they decide to separate and Huus leaves the country. At the end of the novel, as at the beginning, Katinka stands by the wayside, observing life glide by.|$|E

25|$|Continuity {{theory is}} the view that in ageing people are {{inclined}} to maintain, {{as much as they}} can, the same habits, personalities and styles of life that they have developed in earlier years. Continuity theory is Atchley's theory that individuals, in later life, make adaptations to enable them to gain a sense of continuity between {{the past and the present}} and the theory implies that this sense of continuity helps to contribute to well-being in later life. Disengagement theory, activity theory and continuity theory are social theories about ageing, though <b>all</b> <b>may</b> be products of their era rather than a valid, universal theory.|$|E

25|$|Luther {{had been}} {{suffering}} from ill health for years, including Ménière's disease, vertigo, fainting, tinnitus, and a cataract in one eye. From 1531 to 1546 his health deteriorated further. The years of struggle with Rome, the antagonisms with and among his fellow reformers, and the scandal that ensued from the bigamy of the Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse incident, in which Luther had played a leading role, <b>all</b> <b>may</b> have contributed. In 1536, he began to suffer from kidney and bladder stones, arthritis, and an ear infection ruptured an ear drum. In December 1544, {{he began to feel}} the effects of angina.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} visual light {{began to be}} studied by artists and color {{manufacturers}} {{as early as the}} 18th century, {{but it was not until}} the mid-20th century that the chemical damage caused by different lighting situations was researched in depth. In recent decades the cumulative nature of light degradation has become better understood by conservation science. Comprehensive studies began to emphasize long-term effects and allow for short-term variation in light levels depending on the specific situation: standard viewing, viewing by the aged, complex study or treatment, and observation of low contrast details <b>all</b> <b>may</b> have different requirements. Practical compromise between protection of cultural heritage and allowing the artifacts to fulfill their visual purpose means there is an allowance of some physical risk.|$|E
25|$|Nudity, or nakedness, is {{the state}} of wearing no {{clothing}}. The wearing of clothing is a predominantly human characteristic arising from functional needs such as protection from the elements and from cold temperatures, after the loss of body hair, and migration to colder regions. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations, such as a need for warmth, as well as social circumstances. In some situations, a minimum amount of clothing or none at <b>all</b> <b>may</b> be considered socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing may be expected. Social considerations involve cultural issues of modesty, subjective decency and social norms, besides other considerations, and these may depend on the context. There may also be legal considerations.|$|E

25|$|Wilson {{recommended}} Kiggell as {{his successor}} and thought {{the appointment of}} William Robertson “a tremendous gamble”, writing “my heart sinks when I think what it <b>all</b> <b>may</b> mean to the College & this house”. He may have felt that Robertson’s lack of private means did not suit him for a position which required entertaining. Robertson visited Camberley with Lord Kitchener (28 July 1910), who criticised Wilson; {{this may have been}} one of the causes of the poor relations between Wilson and Kitchener in August 1914. Edmonds later told a story of how Wilson had, perhaps as a joke or wanting to draw attention to Robertson’s shortage of money, left a bill for £250 for furniture and improvements to the Commandant’s residence, and that Wilson’s predecessor Rawlinson, when approached by Robertson for advice, had been amused and had commented that many of these improvements had been made by his own wife or by previous Commandants. Whatever the truth of the matter, relations between Wilson and Robertson deteriorated thereafter.|$|E

[...] Although Anderssen is regarded {{as a member of the}} [...] "heroic" [...] attacking school, he was not in favor of mindless aggression, for example he said: [...] "Move that one of your pieces, which is in the worst plight, unless you can satisfy yourself that you can derive immediate advantage by an attack", a principle more recently labelled [...] "Makogonov's rule". According to Fine, his approach to development was haphazard and he totally failed to understand why Morphy won.|$|E
