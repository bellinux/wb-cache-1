40|$|The {{earlier studies}} in this {{measurement}} series defined the limits and aims for design process to create better ventilating helmets [1], and tested the insulation [2] and evaporative characteristics [3] of the designed mock-ups. In addition {{some of the}} tested mock-ups were modified to study more closely the factors that were expected to improve heat transfer from the bicycle helmets. The present paper covers making a new prototype that allowed modifications of the air channels and in- and <b>outlet</b> <b>openings.</b> In total 2 new helmet design concept mock-ups were created and tested with 13 modifications in comparison with 6 selected helmets from the previous studies including the modified versions. The mock-ups were tested at the Thermal Environment Laboratory, Lund University for insulation and evaporative resistance. Dry tests for insulation were carried on at 20 °C temperature in a wind tunnel on a thermal head manikin at the chosen air velocities of 1. 6 m/s on a bald head and 1. 6 m/s and 6 m/s with the wig in order to simulate the effect of hair. Wet tests were carried out with textile skin on the head manikin, using the air velocity 1. 6 m/s with and without the wig.

40|$|AbstractThe {{proposed}} {{experimental work}} intends to analyse the thermal {{performance of a}} TES unit incorporated into a ventilation system under different working conditions. The influences of the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature and velocity on the air outlet temperature and heat transfer rate were investigated The <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature used for the solidification of RT 25 were 10 °C, 12 °C and 14 °C and for the melting 34 °C, 36 °C and 38 °C. The selected <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> velocities were {{the same for the}} melting and solidification process: 0. 5 m/s, 1. 4 m/s and 2. 5 m/s. The results suggest that an increase of the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> velocity reduces linearly the temperature difference between the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> and <b>outlet</b> for the solidification process of the RT 25. Contrary, for the melting of the RT 25, increasing the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> velocity does not reduce the temperature difference linearly, increasing the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature furthermore from 36 °C to 38 °C did not affect the melting time. The <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature plays a significant role on the melting process, reducing linearly the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> and <b>outlet</b> temperature difference and the heat transfer rate, however does not influence the solidification process, similar <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> and <b>outlet</b> temperature difference and the heat transfer rate were obtained for all condition.

A three-dimensional numerical study of natural convection heat transfer from multiple protruding heat sources simulating electronic components is conducted. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software, FLUENT is used in this analysis. A 4 by 5 array of heat sources are embedded in the bottom wall of an adiabatic square enclosure. The heat sources with a constant heat flux source at the bottom are of square cross-section and arranged in an in-line manner.

40|$|The {{performance}} of the reactor vessel auxiliary cooling system (RVACS) of a liquid-metal reactor {{is a function of}} the pressure difference between the cooling <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> and <b>outlet,</b> of the air density variation along the flow path, and of the pressure loss and heat transfer characteristics of this path. The pressure difference between the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> and <b>outlet</b> as well as the RVACS inlet temperature may be affected by wind speed and direction. The objective of this work was to analyze the effects of wind on the {{performance of}} the RVACS of an advanced liquid metal reactor design based on the PRISM concept. Each stack of the reference RVACS design had two <b>air</b> <b>inlets.</b> The analysis showed that one particular wind direction had the most adverse impact on the RVACS performance. For this direction, in a two-inlet stack design, the net effect of a 27 m/s (60 mph) wind on the RVACS airflow would be a reduction of ∼ 15 %; while in a four-inlet design, the net effect would be nearly zero. A 15 % reduction in the RVACS airflow would increase the peak cladding temperature by ∼ 15 °C. In reality, however, the wind direction fluctuates around an average direction, and the most adverse wind effect should be < 15 °C. The temperature at the inlet of the downwind stacks is affected by the outflow of the upwind stacks, but the effect is small. For an air temperature change of 164 °C along the RVACS flow path, the maximum inlet temperature rise is ∼ 5 °C. This would increase the peak cladding temperature by ∼ 1 °C...|$|R

The main design problems {{that affect the}} thermal and energy performance in existing Malaysian atria are overlighting and overheating due to the direct application of western top-lit atrium roof form. As such, 'this research proposed the side-lit atrium form which aimed at controlling direct sunlight {{as a way to}} improve thermal and energy performance of atria in the tropics. Based on the proposed conceptual atrium form, this research examined quantitatively some of the low energy design features and ventilation strategies that can possibly contribute to a better indoor thermal environmental performance of atria in the tropics. The ultimate aim of this research is to propose design principles and guidelines for new low-energy atria in the tropics The combined research methods are as follows: developing a conceptual low energy atrium form based on the vernacular design features to be used for computer modelling studies; carrying out field measurement and monitoring on an existing atrium building which provides validation data for dynamic thermal simulation program TAS; modelling exercise on the same monitored building using dynamic thermal modelling to develop confidence in correctly modelling thermal stratification within the multi-level atrium; employing dynamic thermal modelling to model representative atrium. forms (i. e. both side-lit and top-lit model) and examine quantitatively the effects of some of the key design parameters (i. e. wall-to-roof void area, roof overhangs, and internal solar blinds) on the thermal comfort and energy performance in atria due to both full natural ventilation and pressurised ventilation; and utilising computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to complement the dynamic thermal simulation results, and to investigate quantitatively the thermal and ventilation performance within the atrium well in response to the changes of design parameters (i. e. varying the <b>inlet</b> to <b>outlet</b> <b>opening</b> area ratio and outlet's arrangement). The research findings supported the research proposition and demonstrated the effectiveness of the side-lit form as a way to improve the thermal and energy performance with regard to users' thermal comfort in atria in the tropics. The main,findings from both dynamic thermal simulation and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) are as follows: full natural ventilation strategy is not viable for Malaysian atria; both sufficiently high wall-to-roof void area and extending high-level internal solar blinds can greatly improve the atrium's thermal performance particularly on occupied levels; sufficiently wide roof overhangs above the clerestory areas of the side-lit atrium form generally improves the thermal and energy performance within the central atrium throughout the yea~; reasonably comfortable thermal environment on occupied levels of a low-rise atrium can be achieved by only supplying cooler air at low-level with sufficient ventilation rate; sufficiently higher <b>inlet</b> to <b>outlet</b> <b>opening</b> area ratio can improve the thermal performance on the occupied levels; and with equal <b>inlet</b> and <b>outlet</b> <b>opening</b> area, changing the outlet's arrangement (i. e. location and arrangement) would not significantly affect the atrium's thermal performance.
