5|$|If built, {{the light}} rail would have as its western {{terminus}} <b>a</b> <b>maintenance</b> facility across Highway 82 from the airport. It {{would include a}} stop at Buttermilk and parallel the highway, using the old Maroon Creek Bridge, until it reached Monarch Street downtown. There it would turn south to its eastern terminus at Rubey Park. If there is not sufficient support or funding for the light rail, it could be built as bus lanes at first.|$|E
5|$|In 1960 {{the airline}} took {{delivery}} {{of its first}} jet, a Douglas DC-8 named Fuji, introducing jet service on the Tokyo-Honolulu-San Francisco route. JAL went on to operate a fleet of 51 DC-8s, retiring {{the last of the}} type in 1987. Fuji flew until 1974 and was then used as <b>a</b> <b>maintenance</b> training platform until 1989; its nose section was stored at Haneda Airport and eventually put on public display at the JAL Sky Museum in March 2014.|$|E

5|$|After {{the camp}} was closed, the site {{eventually}} returned to its original state. Within a couple of years, all the structures had been removed, {{with the exception of}} the two sentry posts at the entrance, the cemetery monument, and the former Manzanar High School auditorium, which was purchased by the County of Inyo. The County leased the auditorium to the Independence Veterans of Foreign Wars, who used it as a meeting facility and community theater until 1951. After that, the building was used as <b>a</b> <b>maintenance</b> facility by the Inyo County Road Department.|$|E
5|$|As {{the city}} prepares for the {{memorial}} service, Leslie and Ben are caught making out by <b>a</b> <b>maintenance</b> worker named George (Biff Yeager), so they send him {{home with a}} gift certificate {{in exchange for his}} silence. Unfortunately, George had the propane for Li'l Sebastian's eternal flame, which results in later confusion behind the scenes, that Leslie and Ben struggle to fix throughout the night. Jerry (Jim O'Heir) is sent to get propane for the flame but buys lighter fluid instead; this causes a huge fireball to shoot into the air when Ron lights it, which singes off his eyebrows, part of his mustache and hair. Leslie and Ben are relieved, however, when the crowd applauds in the belief the fireball was staged. Entertainment 720's show also proves to be a hit with the crowd, which makes Tom further contemplate quitting his job.|$|E

5|$|Every {{road that}} is {{maintained}} by DelDOT, including Interstate, U.S., and state routes, is assigned <b>a</b> <b>maintenance</b> road number (also {{known as a}} reference number). The maintenance road numbers are only unique in a specific county and some roads can be designated with multiple road numbers. For example, Bryants Corner Road in Kent County is designated as Road 205, Road 103, and Road 219. Suffixed maintenance road numbers exist near their parent roads, often for a short alignment. For example, Woodland Ferry Road in Sussex County is designated Road 78, while Old Sailor Road, a short road branching off from it near Laurel, is designated as Road 78A. The maintenance road numbers are signed with little white markers at intersections showing the two roads that intersect each other and on auxiliary plates below warning signs approaching intersections.|$|E
5|$|From Gallery Place – Chinatown through Judiciary Square, {{the line}} runs southeast, turning east again at D Street to reach Union Station. There it turns north and {{surfaces}} adjacent to Union Station's platforms, follows the Washington Terminal yard tracks north to Brentwood {{where the line}} turns northwestward and again joins CSX Transportation's Metropolitan Subdivision tracks, running in a unique gauntlet arrangement with the freight railroad tracks straddling the Metro tracks. The Red Line continues in this manner northwest across the District-Maryland line, through Takoma and past Silver Spring. It reenters a tunnel at 16th Street and heads north under Georgia Avenue to the end at Glenmont. There is <b>a</b> <b>maintenance</b> yard between the NoMa and Rhode Island Avenue stops.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} his {{business}} closure, McAloney was forced to seek alternate employment and he consequently enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force on 1 July 1936. Ranked aircraftman, he completed a fitters course and qualified as an aero fitter and turner before being attached to No.1 Squadron at RAAF Base Laverton, Victoria, in September. He was employed in <b>a</b> <b>maintenance</b> role within the unit, working on the Jupiter Gipsy and Rolls-Royce Kestrel engines of Bristol Bulldog and Hawker Demon aircraft respectively. During 1937, McAloney completed a part-time air gunner course. His first child, a son named William, was born later that year.|$|E

5|$|No. 482 Squadron was <b>a</b> <b>maintenance</b> {{unit of the}} Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). It {{was formed}} in May 1942 as No.4 Repair and Salvage Unit, renamed No.4 Repair and Servicing Unit in January 1945 and re-formed as No.482 (Maintenance) Squadron in May 1946. The {{squadron}} then became a component of No.82 (Bomber) Wing at RAAF Station Amberley, Queensland. Over the years it serviced the wing's Consolidated B-24 Liberators, Avro Lincolns, English Electric Canberras, McDonnell Douglas F-4E Phantoms, and General Dynamics F-111Cs. No.482 Squadron merged with No.3 Aircraft Depot to form No.501 Wing in March 1992. No.501 Wing continued to provide maintenance and logistics support for the F-111Cs at Amberley until disbanding in 2001.|$|E
5|$|No. 486 Squadron was <b>a</b> <b>maintenance</b> {{unit of the}} Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). It {{was formed}} in August 1946 as part of No.86 (Transport) Wing, which {{operated}} Douglas C-47 Dakotas out of RAAF Station Schofields, New South Wales. The squadron transferred to RAAF Station Richmond in June 1949. It relocated again to RAAF Base Canberra in April 1954, before returning to Richmond in August 1958 to commence maintenance of No.86 Wing's newly delivered Lockheed C-130 Hercules. The squadron was disbanded between August 1964 and March 1966. In the 1980s and 1990s, it was responsible for servicing the RAAF's Boeing 707 tanker/transports, {{as well as the}} Hercules. No.486 Squadron was again disbanded at Richmond in October 1998, and its functions handed over to No.86 Wing's Hercules squadrons.|$|E
5|$|On 4 July 1906, Wörth was {{transferred}} to the Reserve Formation of the North Sea. She initially served as the flagship of the unit, but on 1 October she was replaced by Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm. She was then decommissioned and her crew reduced to only <b>a</b> <b>maintenance</b> staff. Over the next eight years, she was reactivated only twice, from 2 August to 13 September in 1910 and from 31 July to 15 September the following year; both periods were during the annual autumn maneuvers. She served with the III Squadron in both exercises, and was the flagship of the second command admiral for the squadron, Konteradmiral Heinrich Sass. She returned to reserve status on 15 September, and a month later was docked in the Kaiserliche Werft in Kiel to maintain her for future service.|$|E

5|$|On December 9, 2003, the Stellamare, a Dutch-owned ship, capsized at the port, killing three Russian crewmembers. The {{ship was}} hauling General Electric {{generators}} when it overturned. The United States Coast Guard determined that poor communication {{resulting from the}} supervisors speaking Dutch while the crew spoke Russian, with English {{being used as a}} relay, was a contributing factor to mismanagement of ballast tanks. In the early spring of 2008 a port employee was arrested for stealing copper. This in turn led to investigations of employee theft which resulted in the arrest of an operations manager and <b>a</b> <b>maintenance</b> foreman for larceny. In 2008 the port received two awards from the Railway Industrial Clearance Association. One award was for customer satisfaction and the other for being the most improved port in the United States for handling heavy lift cargo.|$|E

She joined the 7th Fleet in the region, making a goodwill visit to South Korea and entertaining South Korean president Syngman Rhee and his wife Franziska Donner. {{and at the end}} of the tour returned to San Diego on 25 June 1950, the same day as the outbreak of the Korean War. At the time, she was overdue for <b>a</b> <b>maintenance</b> overhaul, but she did not have time to complete it before being dispatched again.|$|E
5|$|The CH-47Ds were {{retired as}} they became due for deep {{maintenance}} checks, {{with the last}} of the type leaving service in September 2016. Due to the large number of common components between the D and F variants, the helicopters were stripped for spare parts before being preserved in Australia. A15-202 was handed over to the Australian War Memorial in April 2016, A15-104 will be displayed at the Australian Army Flying Museum and the former Air Force helicopter A15-106 was transferred to the RAAF Museum. The other three surviving CH-47Ds were retained by the Army for non-flying training: A15-151 and A15-152 are used for general and special forces training respectively and A15-201 serves as <b>a</b> <b>maintenance</b> systems training airframe.|$|E

5|$|The English {{settlers}} {{were attracted}} to the Darby Creek watershed due to the proximity to trading routes and productive landscape. In 1777, British soldiers breached dikes and floodwalls that were constructed on the creek. The Pennsylvania legislature passed an act in 1788 that mandated <b>a</b> <b>maintenance</b> of the dikes and the mowing of plants such as elderberries and pokeweed three times a year. Early English colonists utilized Darby Creek {{as a source of}} water power. Lumber, grist, and textile mills were established {{along the banks of the}} creek. Most of these mills have been demolished, although some of the tenement structures are currently in use as housing. At the end of the 19th century, industrial advances such as engine-driven machinery had made these mills obsolete.|$|E
5|$|The {{bulk of the}} Geschwaders air {{elements}} were moved via Jever, in northern Germany, to Mannheim-Sandhofen on 8 June 1941. There the aircraft were given <b>a</b> <b>maintenance</b> overhaul prior to moving east. The II. Gruppe was transferred to Neusiedel in East Prussia, present-day Malomožaiskojė in Kaliningrad Oblast in Russia, between 12–14 June. On 22 June the Geschwader crossed into Soviet airspace in support of Operation Barbarossa, {{the invasion of the}} Soviet Union which opened the Eastern Front. There, Brändle claimed further victories {{and by the end of}} October 1941 was credited with 28 aerial victories.|$|E
5|$|The plans changed {{dramatically}} and Trans Polar was instead incorporated in Norway. It took delivery of used Boeing 720 jetliners from Eastern Air Lines with registration on 4 June 1970.
