5|$|Due to its slow movements, the addax is <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>target</b> for predators such as lions, humans, African hunting dogs, cheetahs and leopards. Caracals, hyenas and servals attack calves. The addax are {{normally}} not aggressive, though individuals may charge {{if they are}} disturbed.|$|E
5|$|By this time, Cushing {{was dead}} in the water, <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>target</b> for {{repeated}} enemy shelling. The results were disastrous and the order was given to abandon ship. Six officers and 53 men were lost. Of the survivors rescued, 56 had been wounded and ten of them suffered fatal injuries. The abandoned ship remained afloat until her magazines blew up. Cushing received three battle stars for her World War II service.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, journalists, {{eager to}} sensationalize {{the events of}} the Great Fire, were quick to find in Mrs. Kate O'Leary an easy {{scapegoat}} for the calamitous inferno. As a working-class immigrant and a woman, Kate O'Leary was <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>target</b> for those publications who always found it comfortable to vilify Irish Catholics who had not yet assimilated into the dominant American middle-class culture.|$|E
50|$|The typical predators of M. beecheii {{are many}} {{different}} species of birds, spiders, lizards, and other bugs. M. beecheii is <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> <b>target</b> because it is unable to sting {{as a form of}} defense.|$|R
50|$|During kick-ins the ruckman can {{sometimes}} be a designated target. With extra height {{it is difficult for}} opposition players to take marks against them and they are <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> <b>target</b> to spot in a cluster.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the Star Wars workprint, {{the owner of the}} EliteTorrents domain name lived in the United States, which made the site <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> <b>target</b> for US authorities. However, the site's server was located in the Netherlands, and the other BitTorrent trackers located on that server continued to operate.|$|R
5|$|The addax mainly eats {{grasses and}} leaves of any {{available}} shrubs, leguminous herbs and bushes. These animals are well-adapted {{to exist in}} their desert habitat, as they can live without water {{for long periods of}} time. Addax form herds of five to 20 members, consisting of both males and females. They are led by the oldest female. Due to its slow movements, the antelope is <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>target</b> for its predators: lions, humans, African wild dogs, cheetahs, and leopards. Breeding season is at its peak during winter and early spring. The natural habitat of the addax are arid regions, semideserts and sandy and stony deserts.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the invading army's entry into Laconia, Sparta was only lightly defended. The {{majority}} of the Spartan army had accompanied Areus on campaign in Crete, where the Lacedaimonians were supporting the polis of Gortyn. As such, Sparta must have seemed like <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>target</b> to Pyrrhus. Arriving outside Sparta in the evening, Cleonymus advised Pyrrhus to attack immediately {{to take advantage of the}} dearth of defenders. Pyrrhus decided against launching an immediate offensive as he feared the destruction that would be wrought by his Gallic soldiers if they were to enter the city at night. Anticipating no resistance, Pyrrhus order his army to make camp and prepared to enter Sparta in the morning.|$|E
5|$|Simeon often {{violated}} {{the peace treaty}} with Byzantium, attacking and conquering Byzantine territory on several occasions, such as in 904, when the Bulgarian raids were used by Arabs led by the Byzantine renegade Leo of Tripoli to undertake a maritime campaign and seize Thessaloniki. After the Arabs plundered the city, it was <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>target</b> for Bulgaria and the nearby Slavic tribes. In order to dissuade Simeon from capturing the city and populating it with Slavs, Leo VI was forced to make further territorial concessions to the Bulgarians in the modern region of Macedonia. With the treaty of 904, all Slavic-inhabited lands in modern southern Macedonia and southern Albania were ceded to the Bulgarian Empire, with the border line running some 20 kilometres north of Thessaloniki.|$|E
50|$|Many {{concessions}} in Africa {{have been}} known to release captive lions into enclosed areas where they may be hunted with or without the client's approval and/or knowledge. Sometimes, the lion is drugged to slow it down, making it <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> <b>target.</b> Many hunters and hunting organizations consider this unethical and an affront to fair-chase hunting practices.|$|R
50|$|Blogging {{and social}} {{networking}} have become effective tools to register protest and grievances. Protests can express views, news and use viral networking {{to reach out}} to thousands of people. With protests on the rise from the election season of 2016 going into 2017, protestors became aware that using their social media during protest could make them <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> <b>target</b> for government surveillance.|$|R
50|$|To {{the left}} of the castle {{entrance}} is the bottom of a tight spiral staircase made of cut stone. The stairs spiral in a clockwise fashion upward for a purpose: A right-handed intruder ascending the stairs must turn his body to expose more of it to use his sword, making him more vulnerable and <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> <b>target</b> to those above.|$|R
5|$|At 23:56, {{the convoy}} passed south of Zembra Island towards Kelibia on Cap Bon, {{to avoid the}} minefields between Africa and Sicily, still out of formation. Three {{minesweeping}} destroyers sailed ahead, followed by the cruisers Kenya, Manchester and two freighters. Charybdis and the destroyers Eskimo and Somali from Force Z were still some hours behind and Ashanti was steaming fast to overhaul the main body. Three destroyers remained with nine of the merchantmen and Bramham was en route after Deucalion had been sunk. The {{main part of the}} convoy was attacked at 00:40 by four boats of the German III Squadron and 13 torpedo boats of the Italian 18° MAS, 2° MS and 20° MAS, which made fifteen attacks; the long line of merchant ships and the reduced number of escort ships providing <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>target.</b> The 18° MAS detected the convoy on radar, south-east of Pantellaria and attacked the escorts {{at the head of the}} procession, coming under fire as they fired torpedoes to no effect. The Italian boats then attacked the merchant ships.|$|E
5|$|Once Pope struck, Cibber became <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>target</b> {{for other}} satirists. He was {{attacked}} as {{the epitome of}} morally and aesthetically bad writing, largely {{for the sins of}} his autobiography. In the Apology, Cibber speaks daringly in the first person and in his own praise. Although the major figures of the day were jealous of their fame, self-promotion of such an overt sort was shocking, and Cibber offended Christian humility as well as gentlemanly modesty. Additionally, Cibber consistently fails to see fault in his own character, praises his vices, and makes no apology for his misdeeds; so it was not merely the fact of the autobiography, but the manner of it that shocked contemporaries. His diffuse and chatty writing style, conventional in poetry and sometimes incoherent in prose, was bound to look even worse in contrast to stylists like Pope. Henry Fielding satirically tried Cibber for murder of the English language in the 17 May 1740 issue of The Champion. The Tory wits were altogether so successful in their satire of Cibber that the historical image of the man himself was almost obliterated, and it was as the King of Dunces that he came down to posterity.|$|E

50|$|In adulthood, {{the freeze}} {{response}} can remain, and some professionals {{have noted that}} victimisers sometimes seem to pick up subtle clues of this when choosing a victim. This behaviour can make the victim <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> <b>target,</b> as they sometimes make less effort to fight back or vocalise. Afterwards, they often make excuses and minimise what happened to them, sometimes never reporting the assault to the authorities.|$|R
5000|$|... has {{an orbit}} {{that not only}} crosses Earth's orbit, but is roughly {{parallel}} to it at its furthest. This means that during favourable years {{it is easy to}} reach from Earth. Several times this decade, it will be <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> <b>target</b> than Earth's own Moon. It is {{high on the list of}} possible Near-Earth Asteroid targets for future flybys, landings, mining, or orbit manipulations.|$|R
40|$|The cryptoendolithic microoganisms {{that live}} inside {{rocks in the}} frigid Ross Desert of Antarctica {{can serve as a}} {{terrestrial}} model for what may have happened to life forms on Mars when the planet became dry and cold. Trace fossils of microbial rock colonization exist in Antarctica, and similar structures could have formed on Mars. In some respects, such trace fossils could be <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> <b>target</b> for life-detection systems than fossils of cellular structures...|$|R
25|$|Wikipedia's open {{structure}} inherently {{makes it}} <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>target</b> for Internet trolls, spammers, and {{various forms of}} paid advocacy seen as counterproductive {{to the maintenance of}} a neutral and verifiable online encyclopedia.|$|E
25|$|In {{pursuit of}} <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>target</b> of 95 and a series-levelling win, Australia lost the wicket of Langer, who was {{dismissed}} by Ajit Agarkar, but {{the fall of}} the first wicket brought together Ricky Ponting and Matthew Hayden. Together, the two took Australia to a safe victory, levelling the series with one more match to go.|$|E
25|$|Lore was an {{independent}} thinker who {{was reluctant to}} take political orders, a personal characteristic which made him unsuited for the increasingly centralized Communist movement of the late 1920s. In addition, his well-known personal fondness for Leon Trotsky, established during Trotsky's time living in New York, during which he wrote for The Class Struggle, made Lore <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>target</b> for factional opponents.|$|E
5000|$|Angmar {{was founded}} ca [...] {{in the far}} north of the Misty Mountains by the Lord of the Ringwraiths, who {{became known as the}} [...] "Witch-king of Angmar". The Witch-king came north to attack the Dúnedain of Arnor, whose disunity made them <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> <b>target</b> than Gondor at that time. Angmar straddled the {{northern}} reaches of the Misty Mountains, where many evil men gathered {{on both sides of the}} mountains. The chief fortress of Angmar was Carn Dûm.|$|R
50|$|Approximately 8 {{minutes after}} the enemy was engaged, Walke was hit. Soon after, Preston, {{preparing}} her torpedoes, was struck. One salvo from Nagara had put both firerooms out and toppled the afterstack. Her fires made <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> <b>target</b> and shells came in from both port and starboard. The fires spread. At 23:36, she was ordered abandoned. Seconds later she rolled on her side. She floated for another 10 minutes, bow in the air; then sank, taking 116 of her crew with her.|$|R
50|$|Haverhill {{was not the}} {{original}} target of the raiders. Expecting a larger Indian contingent, French authorities planned {{to engage in a}} series of raids on the communities of the Piscataqua River. However, the unwillingness of some Indian tribes to participate in the expedition forced the French to reduce the scope of the operation and choose <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> <b>target.</b> The raid was more costly to the French than previous frontier raids like that in 1704 on Deerfield, Massachusetts because the province had been warned of the raiders' advance.|$|R
25|$|Although often nesting {{close to}} human activity, some Swainson's hawks are very easily {{disturbed}} at the nest and often desert, especially {{early in the}} season. The bird is often quite tame and <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>target</b> for shooters traveling isolated prairie roads. The species may also be affected in ways yet to be understood by some insecticides and herbicides, including those used on its wintering grounds.|$|E
25|$|In January 1950 a Sicilian carabiniere, Giovanni Lo Bianco, coerced Giuliano's treasurer, Benedetto Minasola, into betraying the bandit. Minasola fed {{the police}} band members {{one at a}} time until April when Giuliano had no more active operatives. Minasola was then able to persuade Aspanu Pisciotta to betray his closest friend—Pisciotta was <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>target,</b> having long doubted Verdiani's plot to get himself and Giuliano out of the country.|$|E
25|$|As the Villista cavalry was {{charging}} {{towards the}} trenches, however, two searchlights illuminated the battlefield, making the horsemen <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>target</b> for Calles' machine guns. The front trenches were manned by units led by another future president of Mexico, Col. Lázaro Cárdenas. Villa's horsemen were decimated by machine-gun fire and land mines. The few {{who managed to}} make it near the trenches encountered electrified barbed wire. The charge collapsed and the attack was a failure.|$|E
5|$|When Rooke {{arrived in}} the region several targets were considered. An attempt to incite the {{inhabitants}} of Barcelona to revolt against Philip V failed, and a plan to assault the French naval base at Toulon was abandoned, and an earlier attempt to take Cádiz had failed. Casting around for <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> <b>target,</b> Rooke decided to attack Gibraltar for three principal reasons: it was poorly garrisoned and fortified, it would be of major strategic value to the war effort, and its capture might encourage the inhabitants of southern Spain to reject Philip.|$|R

25|$|On July 18, 2011 in Tokyo at REBELS 8 & It's Showtime Japan Countdown-1, Petrosyan {{dominated}} Hinata to {{a unanimous}} points victory, controlling the fight by slipping {{almost all of}} Hinata's punches, checking low kicks and catching body kicks to disrupt his opponent's rhythm. The Japanese fighter's lack of head movement also made him <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>target</b> for Petrosyan's superior boxing. However, he broke his hand a fourth time in the match.|$|E
25|$|The ladder was {{designed}} to use attraction water: fresh water flowing swiftly out {{the bottom of the}} fish ladder, in the direction opposite which anadromous fish migrate {{at the end of their}} lives. However, the attraction water from this first ladder was not effective. Instead, most salmon used the locks. This made them <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>target</b> for predators; also, many were injured by hitting the walls and gates of the locks, or by hitting boat propellers.|$|E
25|$|The liberal {{policies}} of Presiding Bishop Hines and the General Conventions of 1967 and 1969 {{led to a}} conservative reaction. Facing declining membership and a one million dollar budget cut, the Special Program became <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>target</b> for conservatives, who succeeded in drastically reducing the financial support for the program in 1970. It was finally ended in 1973 with little protest. A year later, Hines was succeeded by John M. Allin, the bishop of Mississippi and a conservative.|$|E
5000|$|Leaders of the {{eugenics}} movement such as Harry Hamilton Laughlin regarded Howe's eugenics {{campaign against}} blindness as an opening wedge for {{a far more}} ambitious eugenics agenda, {{paving the way for}} broader measures against the birth of other babies with inherited [...] "defects." [...] Howe and his eugenicist colleagues sought to craft legislation that would pass constitutional muster. They believed that blindness, as a hygienic trait, would be <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> <b>target</b> for eugenics legislation than such [...] "defective" [...] traits as [...] "feeblemindedness" [...] or a family history of poverty.|$|R
50|$|However, Zahn {{knew that}} Wilhelm Gustloff was rated at 16 knots top speed and was annoyed at Petersen's insistence for keeping {{at the lower}} speed limit of 12 knots, which made the ship <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> <b>target</b> for submarines. Another point of {{disagreement}} between the two captains was {{the shape of the}} route. Zahn supported a zigzag submarine avoidance path while Petersen proposed a linear path to minimise travel time. Petersen also proposed cruising in deep waters and with the lights on to avoid collision with minesweeping ships which were reported as being present in the area at the time.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether various hypotheses {{put forward}} {{to explain the}} downward trends in government capital spending are supported by the data. Using panel data for 22 OECD countries for 1980 - 1992, various hypotheses are tested in a model. The authors find support for three hypotheses: (1) capital spending is reduced during periods of fiscal stringency, since this category of government spending is politically <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> <b>target</b> for cuts than other spending categories; (2) myopic governments will cut investment spending more than governments which have a longer policy horizon; (3) private investment influences government investment spending, because both types of investment are complementary...|$|R
