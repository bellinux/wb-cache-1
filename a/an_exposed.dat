5|$|Due to the {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} pentose residues of the bases, DNA strands have directionality. One end of a DNA polymer contains <b>an</b> <b>exposed</b> hydroxyl group on the deoxyribose; {{this is known as}} the 3'end of the molecule. The other end contains <b>an</b> <b>exposed</b> phosphate group; this is the 5'end. The two strands of a double-helix run in opposite directions. Nucleic acid synthesis, including DNA replication and transcription occurs in the 5'→3'direction, because new nucleotides are added via a dehydration reaction that uses the exposed 3'hydroxyl as a nucleophile.|$|E

5|$|Although deep {{convection}} was displaced to {{the northwest}} of <b>an</b> <b>exposed</b> LLCC early on January 14, the JMA still upgraded the system to a tropical storm and named it Mekkhala, under moderate vertical wind shear offset by excellent poleward outflow. In post-season analysis, the agency upgraded the storm at 12:00 UTC on the previous day. Late on January 14, the PAGASA named the storm Amang right after it entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility.|$|E

5|$|Following peak intensity, Adrian's cloud pattern {{became less}} symmetric, its eye became obscured, and its {{convection}} warmed as southeasterly wind shear increased and the storm passed over ocean temperatures near 77°F (25°C). The storm slowed {{as it passed}} near Socorro Island, all the while the continued unfavorable regime weakened Adrian and stripped it of its all convection. The system was reduced to <b>an</b> <b>exposed</b> swirl of clouds over the open East Pacific by late on June22.|$|E

5|$|Intense rainbands {{produced}} gusty {{winds and}} heavy precipitation totaling to 5.90 in (150mm) in Martinique, causing street flooding and inundating homes. Roughly 5,000 residences lost {{power at the}} height of the storm, though the outages were brief and confined to the southeast of the island. A large landslide occurred in the capital of Fort-de-France due to excessive soil saturation, prompting some 40 families to evacuate the area. Across the city, deep flood waters affected 29 houses; a man was electrocuted and killed by <b>an</b> <b>exposed</b> wire in his flooded home.|$|E
5|$|Later on June14, the JTWC {{issued a}} Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for the depression. Deep {{convection}} consolidated around {{the center of}} circulation and convective banding features developed along {{the periphery of the}} system. Several hours later, the TCFA was canceled as the system rapidly degenerated, with convection mostly dissipating and <b>an</b> <b>exposed</b> low. Outflow significantly deteriorated as the system detached itself from the TUTT. By this time, the JMA had ceased advisories on the depression. Two days later, after tracking across Luzon, the system began to regenerate. Convection redeveloped around the low and outflow was reestablished to the south.|$|E

5|$|The Apennine mountains, which rise to {{a height}} of nearly farther above the mare plain than the Himalayan front above the Indian and Nepalese plainsare {{hypothesized}} to be fault-block mountains displaced upward and segmented by the impact that formed Mare Imbrium. The frontal escarpment of Mons Hadley Delta {{is believed to be}} <b>an</b> <b>exposed</b> segment of the pre-Imbrium impact lunar crust. This made the mountain one of the mission's primary objectives, as it would allow the astronauts to obtain samples of the lunar crust as it was before the creation of Mare Imbrium.|$|E
5|$|The bee-eaters {{are almost}} {{exclusively}} aerial hunters of insect prey. Prey is caught either in continuous flight or more commonly from <b>an</b> <b>exposed</b> perch {{from which the}} bee-eater watches for prey. Smaller, rounder-winged bee-eaters typically hunt from branches and twigs closer to the ground, whereas the larger species hunt from tree tops or telegraph wires. One unusual technique often used by carmine bee-eaters is to ride {{on the backs of}} bustards.|$|E
5|$|The {{nineteenth century}} saw some major {{engineering}} projects including Thomas Telford's (1757–1834) stone Dean Bridge (1829–31) and iron Craigellachie Bridge (1812–14). In the 1850s {{the possibilities of}} new wrought- and cast-iron construction were explored {{in the building of}} commercial warehouses in Glasgow. This adopted a round-arched Venetian style first used by Alexander Kirkland (1824–92) at the heavily ornamented 37–51 Miller Street (1854) and translated into iron in John Baird I's Gardner's Warehouse (1855–6), with <b>an</b> <b>exposed</b> iron frame and almost uninterrupted glazing. Most industrial buildings avoided this cast-iron aesthetic, like William Spence's (1806?–83) Elgin Engine Works built in 1856-8, using massive rubble blocks.|$|E

5|$|The rectory is a Grade II listed {{building}} and stands opposite the village pond. A building of several periods, the rectory was first {{built in the}} 17th century although includes 18th and 19th century additions. The building consists of two storeys with <b>an</b> <b>exposed</b> timber-framed core, with taller attachments at the south. A tiled roof is hipped {{at the north end}} and its walls consist of red brick with Flemish Bond. A K6 telephone box beside the village pond is also Grade II listed. The telephone box was designed in 1935 by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott and was made by various contractors.|$|E
5|$|The second {{featured}} bout on the undercard was {{a standard}} {{match for the}} WWE United States Championship between Eddie Guerrero, and The Big Show. Guerrero {{used a variety of}} tactics including forcing Big Show's head into <b>an</b> <b>exposed</b> turnbuckle, striking him with a trash can lid, punching him with brass knuckles and striking him with the title belt. After hitting Show with the belt, Guerrero performed a frog splash for a near-fall. Show then performed a chokeslam but Guerrero placed his foot on the rope. Show then performed another chokeslam on Guerrero to win the title.|$|E
5|$|After {{consultation}} with Admiralty, Adams {{took advantage of}} this freedom to make four substantive changes to the Tartar design. The ship's wheel was moved from behind the mizzen mast to before it to improve the helmsman's line of sight. The tiller was also relocated, from <b>an</b> <b>exposed</b> position on the quarterdeck to a safer location belowdecks and near the stern. The vessel's hawseholes were relocated from the lower to the upper deck to allow additional storage space inside the hull. Finally, {{in recognition of the}} vessel's likely role in chasing small enemy craft, the leading pair of gunports were moved from the sides of the vessel to the bow in order to form a battery of chase guns.|$|E

5|$|Although {{found to}} be {{reliable}} and accurate, the M249 was considered to present unacceptable hazards {{in the form of}} <b>an</b> <b>exposed</b> hot barrel and sharp edges. There were complaints that the front sight required special adjustment tools. On August 23, 1985, then-U.S. Under Secretary of the Army James R. Ambrose suspended M249 production pending the development of the product improvement program (PIP) intended to fix these problems. Congress deleted funds for the M249 from the Fiscal Year 1986 defense budget, then retroactively set aside the program's prior year's funds from the M249 program for other purposes, including retirement and pay raises. Over 1,100 M249s already issued were to remain in use, but be retrofitted with the PIP kit when it became available. Over 7,000 remaining M249s were to stay in storage at depots until corrective changes could be made. The PIP kit was eventually developed and implemented, and production of the M249 resumed. In 1994 the M249 squad automatic weapon was re-designated the M249 light machine gun.|$|E
5|$|By the 1930s, necklines plunged at the back, sleeves {{disappeared}} and sides were cut away and tightened. With {{the development of}} new clothing materials, particularly latex and nylon, through the 1930s swimsuits gradually began hugging the body, with shoulder straps that could be lowered for tanning. Women's swimwear of the 1930s and 1940s incorporated increasing degrees of midriff exposure. Coco Chanel made suntans fashionable, and in 1932 French designer Madeleine Vionnet offered <b>an</b> <b>exposed</b> midriff in an evening gown. They were seen a year later in Gold Diggers of 1933. The Busby Berkeley film Footlight Parade of 1932 showcases aquachoreography that featured bikinis. Dorothy Lamour's The Hurricane (1937) also showed two-piece bathing suits.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, Zeller {{published}} {{a study of}} the development of the mushroom, made possible by the prolific fruiting of the fungus in Seattle in the fall of 1912. Development was studied by examining thin sections of tissues in different stages of development, and the differentiation of tissues and structures followed by using histological stains. The growth form of Xerocomellus zelleri is called gymnocarpic, meaning that the hymenium appears and develops to maturity in <b>an</b> <b>exposed</b> state, not enclosed by any protective membrane. In this type of development, the cap is formed from hyphae {{at the top of the}} stem and subsequently expands by growth along the margins; the hymenium forms later beneath the cap in a direction away from the center.|$|E
