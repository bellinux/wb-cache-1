Speech therapy and specifically LSVT may improve speech. Occupational therapy (OT) aims to promote health <b>and</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> by helping people with the disease to participate in as many of their daily living activities as possible.

40|$|UnrestrictedThere {{appears to}} be a paradox in the {{prostate}} cancer literature: despite the fact that age and comorbidities are positively correlated, comorbidities are associated with worse physical <b>and</b> emotional <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> while age is associated with worse physical <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> but better emotional <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> Emotional support <b>and</b> positive reframing coping strategies may help explain part of this paradox in that they may be more frequently used by older prostate cancer patients and associated with better emotional <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> In an effort to better understand this paradox, the present questionnaire-based study of pre-treatment prostate cancer patients (n= 74) investigated 1) the relations among age, comorbidity level, emotional <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> <b>and</b> physical <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> 2) age as a potential moderator of the association between comorbidities <b>and</b> emotional <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> <b>and</b> 3) an age-specific coping strategy comprised of emotional support and positive reframing as a mediator of the age <b>and</b> emotional <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> association. Results suggest that age is positively associated with emotional <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> comorbidity level is negatively associated with physical <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> However, no significant relations were found between age <b>and</b> physical <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> or comorbidity level <b>and</b> emotional <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> nor was an interaction between age and comorbidity level in emotional <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> confirmed. Age-specific coping strategies were not found to mediate the relation between age <b>and</b> emotional <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> either, but statistical trends suggest that older patients may appraise their prostate cancer diagnoses as less distressing than their younger counterparts and therefore use fewer coping strategies in general.

5|$|The {{mortality}} rate from paracetamol overdose increases {{two days after}} the ingestion, reaches a maximum on day four, and then gradually decreases. Acidosis is the most important single indicator of probable mortality and the need for transplantation. A {{mortality rate}} of 95% without transplant was reported in patients who had a documented pH less than 7.30. Other indicators of poor prognosis include renal insufficiency (stage3 or worse), hepatic encephalopathy, a markedly elevated prothrombin time, or an elevated blood lactic acid level (lactic acidosis). One study has shown that a factor V level less than 10% of normal indicated a poor prognosis (91% mortality), whereas a ratio of factor VIII to factor V of less than 30 indicated a good prognosis (100% survival). Patients with a poor prognosis are usually identified for likely liver transplantation.

5|$|Villermé’s Tableau {{discussed}} {{the role of}} industrialization on the general health <b>and</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> for the laboring class.

He even suggested the industrial movement to be beneficial for the future of society, calling on examples of industrialization in the United States. He also {{discussed the}} role of children working in the textile industry. The point is made that, in some cases, {{at least half of the}} workforce in a textile factory was made up of the children of textile workers, many under the age of eighteen. Villermé contrasted the quality of life of workers who maintained family life with those taken over completely by their labor. He blamed both the working conditions associated with industrialization as well as the workers themselves to an extent. This work served not only as valuable information to medical institutions and boards, but also as a social statement, widely accepted by the public.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} the influence of transformational leadership, organisational citizenship behaviour <b>and</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> work <b>life</b> on job performance amongst supply management professionals employed by the South African government. Rationale: The depressed job performance of supply management professionals in the South African government presents an impetus to generate new empirical information on the subject in order to find solutions. Methodology: A quantitative survey approach was followed using a sample of 264 supply management professionals employed in the South African government and were based in Gauteng Province. A Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was conducted to assess psychometric properties of the measurement instrument. Hypotheses were tested using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). Findings: Transformational leadership had positive and significant relationships with organisational citizenship behaviour <b>and</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> work <b>life.</b> <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> work <b>life</b> exerted a greater influence of job performance than organisational citizenship behaviour. Value of research: The study provides current evidence of the influence of transformational leadership on organisational citizenship behaviour <b>and</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> work <b>life,</b> as well as the influence of organisational citizenship behaviour <b>and</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> work <b>life</b> on job performance amongst supply management professionals.
