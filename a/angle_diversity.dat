However, the compactness of terminal devices limits the number of spatial degrees of freedom (DOFs) in such systems, which motivates efficient antenna design techniques to exploit all available DOFs. In this contribution, we present a compact six-port dielectric resonator antenna (DRA) array which utilizes spatial, polarization and <b>angle</b> <b>diversities.</b> To evaluate the proposed DRA array, a measurement campaign was conducted at 2. 65 GHz in indoor office scenarios for four 6 × 6 multiple antenna systems. Compared to the reference system of monopole arrays which only exploit spatial diversity, the use of dual-polarized patch antennas at the transmitter enriches the channel’s DOF in the non-line-ofsight scenario. Replacing the monopole array at the receiver with the DRA array that has a 95 % smaller ground plane, the 10 % outage capacity evaluated at 10 dB reference signal-to-noise ratio becomes equivalent to that of the reference system, due to the DRA’s rich diversity characteristics. In the line-of-sight scenario, the DRA array gives a higher DOF than the monopole array as the receive counterpart to the transmit patch array. However, the outage capacity is 1. 5 bits/s/Hz lower, due to the DRA array’s lower channel gain...|$|R
40|$|Microwave {{radiation}} is almost insensitive {{in terms of}} power attenuation {{to the presence of}} atmosphere; the atmo- sphere is however an error source in repeat pass interferometry due to propagation delay variations. This effect represents a main limitation in the detection and monitoring of weak deformation patterns in differential interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR), especially in emergency conditions. Due to the wave- length reduction current, X-Band sensors are even more sensitive to such error sources: procedures adopted in classical advanced DInSAR for atmospheric filtering may fail in the presence of higher revisiting rates. In this work, we show such effect on data acquired by the COSMO-SkyMed constellation. The dataset has been acquired with very high revisiting rates during the emer- gency phase. This feature allows clearly showing the inability of standard filtering adopted in common processing chains in handling seasonal atmospheric delay variations over temporal intervals spanning periods shorter than 1 year. We discuss a pro- cedure for the mitigation of atmospheric propagation delay (APD) that is based on the integration of data of GPS systems which carries out measurements with large observation <b>angles</b> <b>diversity</b> practically in continuous time.

30|$|The {{propagation}} {{characteristics of}} the indoor infrared channel are fully described by the channel’s impulse response, which depends on multiple {{factors such as the}} room geometry, the reflection pattern of surfaces, the emitter and receiver characteristics, and their relative locations. In this paper, we study by simulation those indoor IR links that are characterised by the use of conventional <b>angle</b> <b>diversity</b> receivers. As discussed above, a conventional <b>angle</b> <b>diversity</b> receiver consists of multiple photodetectors that are oriented in various directions, where each receiving element usually employs a band-pass filter and nonimaging concentrator, such as a compound parabolic concentrator (CPC) or hemispheric lens. In order to estimate the impulse response in IR wireless indoor channels, several simulation methods have been put forth [10, 11], but all of them share the same problem, namely, the intensive computational effort. However, we make use of a Monte Carlo ray-tracing algorithm [12, 13], which presents a lower computational cost than previous methods, especially when a high temporal resolution and a large number of reflections are required. Indoor optical channel simulation can significantly enhance the design of <b>angle</b> <b>diversity</b> receivers but requires models that correctly fit the receiver characteristics and the remaining elements of the IR channel. That is why, in this work, we use models for the reflection pattern of surfaces, background light-induced shot noise and an effective signal collection area for a conventional <b>angle</b> <b>diversity</b> receiver that more closely approximate real behaviour than those previously reported. The inclusion of these models in the Monte Carlo ray-tracing algorithm allows us to study more precisely those optical links that are characterised by the use of conventional <b>angle</b> <b>diversity</b> receivers.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the problem of mitigating interference and improving network capacity in wireless mesh networks from the <b>angle</b> of temporal-spatial <b>diversity.</b> In a nutshell, while the achievable throughput on a multihop wireless path is limited by intra-flow interference, the overall capacity of a multihop wireless network can be increased by exploiting temporal-spatial diversity of concurrent transmissions that exist {{among a number of}} wireless links. Connections that are routed along multihop wireless paths can be scheduled to take place simultaneously if their transmissions do not interfere with each other (significantly). To make a case of exploiting the temporal-spatial diversity to improve network capacity, we focus on transporting downstream traffic at gateway nodes with Internet access. We propose to construct, based on measurements of received signal strengths, a virtual coordinate system that is used to determine the sets of paths along which transmissions can take place with the least inter-flow interference. Based on the sets of non-interfering paths, the gateway node then determines the order with which a gateway node schedules frames of different connections to be transmitted. Through extensive simulation (with real-life measurement traces on an operational, city-wide wireless community network), we show that the downstream throughput of a gateway node in a wireless mesh network can be improved by 10 - 35 % under a variety of network topologies and traffic distributions. This, coupled {{with the fact that the}} proposed approach requires only minor code change in the gateway nodes and does not require any additional hardware, makes it a viable option to improving network capacity in existing wireless mesh networks...|$|R

In general, the use of multibeam transmitter in conjunction with <b>angle</b> <b>diversity</b> receivers makes it possible to reduce the impact of ambient light noise, path loss and multipath distortion, in part by exploiting {{the fact that they are}} often received from different directions than the desired signal [1 – 9].

A conventional receiver uses multiple photodetectors that are oriented in various directions [4, 5]; an imaging diversity receiver is composed of an optical concentrator that focuses on a segmented photodetector array [2, 6, 7] and a sectored receiver which is a hemisphere, where a set of parallels and meridians defines the photodetector boundaries [8, 9].|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} {{emission}} line profile models of {{hydrogen and helium}} {{based on the results}} from axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations of the wind formed near the disk-magnetosphere boundary of classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs). We extend the previous outflow models of `the conical-shell wind' by Romanova et al. to include a well defined magnetospheric accretion funnel flow which is essential for modelling the optical and near-infrared hydrogen and helium lines of CTTSs. The MHD model with an intermediate mass-accretion rate shows outflows in conical-shell shape with a half opening angle about 35 degrees. The flow properties such as the maximum outflow speed in the conical-shell wind, maximum inflow speed in the accretion funnel, mass-accretion and mass-loss rates are comparable to those found in a typical CTTS. The density, velocity and modified temperature from the MHD simulations are used in a separate radiative transfer model to predict the line profiles and test the consistency of the MHD models with observations. The line profiles are computed with various combinations of X-ray luminosities, temperatures of X-ray emitting plasma, and inclination <b>angles.</b> A rich <b>diversity</b> of line profile morphology is found, and many of the model profiles are very similar to those found in observations. We find that the conical-shell wind may contribute to the emission in some hydrogen lines (e. g. H-alpha, H-beta, Pa-beta and Pa-gamma) significantly when the temperature in the wind is relatively high (e. g. ∼ 10 ^ 4 K); however, the wind contribution decreases rapidly when a lower wind temperature is adopted. The model well reproduces a relatively narrow and low-velocity blueshifted absorption component in He I (10830), which are often seen in observations.

40|$|Traditionally antenna {{diversity}} has been thought of {{in terms of}} space diversity and associated large antenna separations. Generally, however, {{antenna diversity}} can be created using space, pattern, <b>angle</b> and polarization <b>diversity.</b> As such antenna diversity can be formed in several compact configurations that are suitable for mobile communications. In this thesis we introduce two types of compact diversity antennas, namely the Y Patch compact integrated antenna and the Slot Monopole diversity antenna. In essence the designs are single element structures but with two feeds. The significance of the designs are {{that they can be}} utilized in compact wireless communication handsets to provide diversity signals. In addition the antenna can also act as a duplexer allowing the receive and transmit signals to be well isolated. The Y Patch antenna design is based on merging two patch antennas together in combination with capacitive loading so that a compact design can be obtained. Justification for the design is provided by considering the mutual coupling using the reaction principle and FDTD simulations. Experimental results are also presented for a design that operates in 2. 1 - 2. 2 GHz band with over 20 dB isolation between the ports and cross correlation being less than 0. 01. Hence the antenna is for possible application in forthcoming third generation wireless systems. The Slot Monopole antenna design is based on combining a λ/ 4 slot and monopole antennas that they have orthogonal polarizations. Experimental results are presented for a design that operates in 2. 4 GHz ISM band. The slot monopole antenna design can be made to be more compact by using meandering geometry. The experimental design also operates in 2. 1 - 2. 2 GHz band and there is over 15 dB isolation between the ports with cross correlation of less than 0. 01 for both designs. Comprehensive results are presented and include radiation patterns, S-parameters and signal correlations between ports so that the diversity performance and isolation characteristics of the antennas can be demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|The {{construct}} diversity {{describes the}} collective amount of differences among members within a social unit. The present dissertation {{is based on}} the assumption that, through engagement with diversity, people acquire an understanding of what role diversity plays in the societies, organizations, work groups, or other social units they are part of. This understanding of the role diversity plays in a given social unit provides a vantage point from which people will engage with diversity in the future. These vantage points from which people engage with diversity are the general subject matter of the present dissertation. Two main research questions are addressed in this regard: First, whether the role diversity is given in a particular context does have effects on groups and the individual members therein. Second, if such effects exist, it seeks to explore the processes and mechanisms they are based on. Both questions are addressed from different perspectives in the three main chapters of this dissertation. Chapter 5 contains two meta-analyses on the effects of diversity beliefs and diversity climates. Diversity beliefs are individual attitudes that describe the degree to which diversity is ascribed an instrumental value for achieving beneficial outcomes or avoiding detrimental ones. Diversity climates depict such a value of diversity on the group-level. Building on the social identity approach, I explain how diversity beliefs and climates can obviate diversity’s detrimental effects and foster beneficial ones. As both diversity beliefs and climates can cause such effects, they are considered together in the main analyses in the chapter. In the first part of the chapter, a meta-analysis on these moderator effects of diversity beliefs/climates is presented (k = 23). The majority of studies that addressed such effects reported significant results. The patterns of these results showed that, in general, diversity will be more positively related to beneficial outcomes the more it is valued. However, the analysis also revealed that there are at least two types of patterns of this moderation. So far, it cannot be explained which pattern will occur under what circumstances. In the second part of the chapter, a meta-analysis on the main effects of diversity beliefs/climates on beneficial outcomes is presented (k = 71). These effects did not receive much attention in the primary studies. Based on the social identity approach and the fact that diversity is a ubiquitous feature of modern organizations, I argue that they are important nonetheless. The meta-analysis revealed a significant positive main effect of diversity beliefs on beneficial outcomes (r =. 25; p <. 0001). However, the effect sizes varied considerably across studies. Both moderator and main effects were found across a broad array of outcomes, study designs, levels of analysis, and operationalizations of the constructs involved. They were found irrespective of whether diversity beliefs or diversity climates were considered. The heterogeneity of results in the meta-analyses suggests that there is still much to be learned about when differences in vantage points from which people engage with diversity will have an effect and about the processes that underlie these effects. Chapter 6 is, therefore, predominantly concerned with these underlying processes. Most of the previous research has treated pro-diversity beliefs and pro-similarity beliefs as opposite poles of one underlying continuum. There is, however, evidence that people can hold both types of beliefs simultaneously. Therefore, I propose that both diversity in certain aspects and similarity in other aspects can simultaneously constitute valid and valued parts of an organization’s identity, and that, hence, identifying with the organization can create two forms of solidarity among the employees: organic solidarity – based on meaningfully and synergistically interrelated differences, and mechanic solidarity – based on the common ground that all employees share. Furthermore, I propose that both forms of solidarity can coexist and that both are positively related to the quality of collaboration within the organization. Thus, organizational identification is proposed to influence quality of collaboration indirectly through both organic and mechanic solidarity. These propositions were tested with regard to the collaboration of different teams within two organizations: a German university (Study 1, N = 699) and a Taiwanese hospital (Study 2, N = 591). The results from both studies confirm the predictions. However, the relative importance of each form of solidarity varied across study contexts and across different facets of the quality of collaboration. Chapter 7 also builds on the findings from the meta-analyses and is again predominantly focussed on the processes underlying the effects of diversity beliefs and diversity climates, yet from a different <b>angle.</b> Previously, <b>diversity</b> beliefs and climates have often been discussed with regard to their potential to influence whether diversity will lead to more and deeper elaboration of information within the group. In chapter 7 a theoretical model is developed that complements these cognitive processes by addressing the emotional side of diverse groups. Central to the model is the assumption that group diversity can stimulate group members to engage with each other emotionally, resulting in higher levels of state affective empathy: an emotional state which arises from the comprehension and apprehension of fellow group members’ emotional state. State affective empathy, in turn, is known to lead to a variety of beneficial team processes that can ultimately enhance individual and group-level performance. Thus, the central proposition of the model is that the relationship between diversity and performance is mediated through state affective empathy. The other propositions in the model specify moderators that determine when diversity will indeed have this empathy-stimulating effect. Diversity beliefs and climates are considered second-order moderators that shape the relationship between diversity and empathy through their influence on the first-order moderators. In general, it is proposed that diversity is related to empathy more positively if it is valued by the group or its members. In summary, the results from the meta-analyses in chapter 5, the results from the field studies in chapter 6, and the theoretical arguments presented in chapter 7 can be interpreted such that differences in vantage points from which people engage with diversity can indeed affect groups and their members. Therefore, the first research question of the present dissertation can be answered affirmatively from three different perspectives. However, it also became clear that there is still much uncertainty about the mechanisms underlying these effects. In line with the second research question of the present dissertation, these mechanisms were examined more closely in chapter 6 and 7. The field studies in chapter 6 highlighted the role of identification as the driving force behind the effects of different vantage points on diversity. Furthermore, they also corroborate the proposition that valuing diversity and valuing similarity can be co-occurring phenomena that both influence the collaboration within the group positively. The theoretical model presented in chapter 7 opens up a new emotional way in which diversity beliefs and climates can influence whether diversity will lead to better or worse performance. In sum, therefore, also with regard to the second research question of the present dissertation, progress has been made. Diversität bezeichnet das Ausmaß an Unterschieden zwischen den Mitgliedern einer sozialen Gruppierung. Der zentrale Gegenstand der vorliegenden Arbeit ist die Art und Weise, in der sich Menschen auf die Diversität der Gruppen, zu denen sie gehören, einlassen. Im Hinblick darauf möchte ich mit dieser Dissertation zur Beantwortung zweier Fragen beitragen: Erstens, ob die Art und Weise in der Menschen Diversität begegnen einen Einfluss auf einzelne Gruppenmitglieder und Gruppen als Ganzes hat. Zweitens, sollte dies der Fall sein, welche Mechanismen diesen Effekten zugrunde liegen. Diese Fragen werden in den drei Hauptkapiteln der Arbeit von verschiedenen Blickwinkeln aus beantwortet. In Kapitel 5 wird der Forschungsstand zu den Effekten von Diversity Beliefs und Diversity Climates meta-analytisch zusammengefasst. Diversity Beliefs sind individuelle Einstellungen, die beschreiben wie sehr die Diversität einer Gruppe als wertvolle Ressource für das Erreichen der Ziele der Gruppe und der Ziele der einzelnen Mitglieder wertgeschätzt wird. Diversity Climates beschreiben diese Wertschätzung von Diversität auf Gruppenebene. Der erste Teil des Kapitels beinhaltet eine Meta-Analyse zu den Moderationseffekten von Diversity Beliefs/Climates (k = 23). Die überwiegende Mehrzahl aller Studien, die derartige Effekte berichten, finden signifikante Interaktionseffekte im Sinne der Hypothese, dass Diversität dann zu vorteilhafteren Ergebnissen führt, wenn sie von entweder einzelnen Personen oder ganzen Gruppen wertgeschätzt wird. Die Ergebnisse sind jedoch heterogen in Bezug auf die unterschiedlichen Muster dieser Moderationen. Der zweite Teil des Kapitels beinhaltet eine Meta-Analyse zu den Haupteffekten von Diversity Beliefs/Climates (k = 71). Über alle Studien hinweg zeigt sich ein mittelgroßer, positiver Zusammenhang zwischen der Wertschätzung von Diversität und vorteilhaften Ergebnissen für Individuen und Gruppen (r =. 25; p <. 0001). Die Effektstärken variieren jedoch beträchtlich zwischen den Studien. Sowohl die statistische Signifikanz der Moderationseffekte und deren Muster, wie auch die Stärke der Haupteffekte waren weitestgehend unabhängig von der Art der Ergebnisvariablen, den Studiendesigns, den Analyseebenen und den Operationalisierungen der beteiligten Konstrukte. Beide Formen von Effekten fanden sich in gleicher Ausprägung sowohl für Diversity Beliefs wie auch für Diversity Climates. Die Meta-Analysen zeigen, dass die Art und Weise wie Menschen sich auf Diversität einlassen in der Tat Effekte auf Gruppen und ihre Mitglieder haben kann. Allerdings deutet die Heterogenität der Befunde darauf hin, dass noch wenig darüber bekannt ist, durch welche Prozesse diese Effekte verursacht, beziehungsweise vermittelt, werden. Kapitel 6 befasst sich daher genauer mit diesen verursachenden und vermittelnden Prozessen. Es wurde postuliert, dass sowohl die Wertschätzung von Diversität wie auch von Similarität gemeinsam Bestandteile einer organisationalen Identität sein können, und dass die Identifikation mit solch einer Identität demnach zu zwei Formen von Solidarität führen kann: zu organischer Solidarität, die auf sich ergänzenden Unterschieden zwischen den Mitgliedern der Organisation aufbaut, und zu mechanischer Solidarität, die auf Gemeinsamkeiten der Mitglieder beruht. Ferner wurde postuliert, dass beide Formen von Solidarität die Kooperation in einer Organisation positiv beeinflussen. Diese Annahmen wurden in Hinblick auf die Kooperation zwischen Teams innerhalb einer deutschen Universität (Studie 1, N = 699) und innerhalb einer Universitätsklinik in Taiwan (Studie 2, N = 591) geprüft. Ingesamt sprechen die Befunde für die postulierten Zusammenhänge. Es zeigte sich allerdings auch, dass beide Formen der Solidarität in unterschiedlichen Kontexten und in Bezug auf unterschiedliche Maße für die Qualität der Kooperation einen unterschiedlich starken Einfluss haben können. Ebenfalls aufbauend auf der Heterogenität der Ergebnisse aus den Meta-Analysen, befasst sich auch Kapitel 7 mit den Prozessen, die den Effekten von Diversity Beliefs und Climates zugrunde liegen. Bislang wurden diese zumeist in Hinblick auf die Vorteile der Diversität für tiefere und reichere Informationsverarbeitung in Gruppen untersucht. In Kapitel 7 wird ein theoretisches Modell dargestellt, das zusätzlich zu diesen kognitiven Prozessen auf die emotionalen Prozesse in heterogenen Gruppen eingeht. Das zentrale Postulat des Modells besagt, dass Diversität die Gruppenmitglieder zu vermehrter Empathie für andere Gruppenmitglieder anregen kann und dass diese wiederum zu vorteilhaften Team-Prozessen führt, die letztlich die Leistung einzelner und der Gruppe verbessern. Weitere Postulate beziehen sich auf moderierende Faktoren, die bestimmen ob Diversität tatsächlich zu mehr Empathie führt. Diversity Beliefs und Climates nehmen hierbei die Rolle von Moderatoren zweiter Ordnung ein. Sie wirken vermittelt über andere Moderatoren, dergestalt dass die Beziehung zwischen Diversität und Empathie positiver wird, je mehr Diversität wertgeschätzt wird. Zusammenfassend in Hinblick auf die erste Forschungsfragestellung, legen die Ergebnisse aus den Meta-Analysen (Kapitel 5) und den beiden Feldstudien (Kapitel 6), sowie das theoretische Modell (Kapitel 7) nahe, dass die Art und Weise wie sich Menschen auf Diversität einlassen entscheidende Effekte für Gruppen und ihre Mitglieder haben kann. In Bezug auf die Prozesse, die diesen Effekten zugrunde liegen – und damit der zweiten Fragestellung – konnten ebenfalls Erkenntnisse gewonnen werden...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Multiple narrow beams ' {{transmitters}} {{have been}} shown to improve the performance of the indoor optical wireless channels by a remarkable higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and a lower signal delay spread over the conventional diffuse transmitters, especially at weak locations (when the transceivers have the highest separation distance). Further performance improvement is attained through the use of <b>angle</b> <b>diversity</b> receivers incorporating multiple detecting elements as well as circuitry for signal combining techniques as to enhance signal reception and to combat the background noise associated with the indoor channel. This work is an expansion of previous research with five different spot diffusing geometries and a hexagonalbase seven-branch receiver where the assumption of a stationary transmitter is extended to fully mobile transmitter and receiver along same communication plane. We present novel results for the influence of transmitter mobility on SNR at various receiver positions and provide detailed comparison among the five spot diffusing pattern. The results show high optical gain compared to conventional diffuse system when spot diffusing and <b>angle</b> <b>diversity</b> detection were used particularly at worst communication links with improvement of more than 30 dB. 1...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{transmission link}} performance for a Multi-Spot Diffusing Configuration (MSDC) for indoor wireless optical LANs. MSDC utilizes a multibeam transmitter and a composite receiver consisting of 7 narrow field-of-view (FOV) branches. Numerical evaluation is performed for two {{values of the}} receiver FOV corresponding to the cases when at least one or two diffusing spots are covered by a branch. Required optical power {{is used as a}} measure for MSDC link evaluation. The composite receiver provides <b>angle</b> <b>diversity,</b> which allows implementation of effective combining techniques. Selection Combining (SC) and Maximal Ratio Containing (MRC) methods have been analyzed. Our simulation results show that MSDC can reach much higher bit rates than a diffuse link can, without any channel equalization. MSDC link employing <b>angle</b> <b>diversity</b> receiver with larger FOV (each receiver branch capturing at least two diffusing spots) and using MRC method shows a promising performance for up to several hundreds of Mbps. System robustness against shadowing and blockage is also investigated. MSDC is more robust when an obstacle is located near the receiver, while this may cause severe problems in a diffuse link.
