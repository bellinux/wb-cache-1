5|$|Myers {{made one}} hundred oxy-hydrogen balloon bombs for the {{government}} to do a full scale experiment of producing rain. The balloons were 10, 12, and 20 feet in diameter. The purpose of the Texas experiment was to see if making <b>artificial</b> <b>rain</b> could be done by man-made weather modification. After the experiment took place it was reported that the result was a success of what was hoped for. The news press release of August 20, 1891, reported that rain was made to fall two days before at three o'clock in the afternoon. At the time the sky was clear and there was no prediction of rain in the area for at least a week. The claim was that the rain produced was directly or indirectly caused by the explosion of the oxygen-hydrogen balloon bombs that were exploded electrically at altitudes of 1800 to 3000 feet. That started a sequence of events that lead to a torrent. The rain storm that ensued was reported by ranchers and railroad linemen for some thousand miles across several states. After this Myers was contracted by paper companies in New York state to see about producing rain in their forests that needed it badly. He contended that the Mohawk Valley was {{a good place to start}} rain and that the rainfall then would go to the Adirondack Mountains and Catskill Mountains.|$|E

The video was filmed in two days. The first day consisted of actors, including Swift and Anderson, filming before a green screen. On the set, White presented Swift with caricature drawings depicting the music video, in order to guide herself. Swift was impressed by Anderson's acting skills, considering her lack of experience, and called it [...] "prolific". On the second day, scenes {{at a high school}} were filmed; <b>artificial</b> <b>rain</b> was made. Afterward, White and a team of visual effect artists created the setting.

500|$|Much of {{the episode}} was {{completed}} in the Upper Boat Studios, particularly the interior car scenes. For this, only one car set was used, with it being redecorated for each different car. The cars were decorated to look like they had been lived in, and incorporated futuristic and well-known home objects. Brannigan and Valerie's children were played by real kittens, which proved difficult to direct. The production team shot for four days in the [...] "6-foot by 6-foot" [...] car, which Davies called a [...] "nightmare" [...] because not many camera angles were available and only one crew member could adjust the props and lighting at a time. In addition, smoke was generated around the car so it would {{blend in with the}} CGI smoke from the CGI cars. The small set was intended to benefit the actors, as they would feel claustrophobic. For the scene in which the Doctor jumps from car to car, the underside of a car was built and suspended ten to fifteen feet above the top of the car set with a green screen all around to get as many angles as possible. Davies preferred action sequences that moved up and down, a scale that is not seen much on television. The Temple of Peace in Cardiff was the location for the Darkened Temple, as well as the TV Studio with news reporter Sally Calypso. The production team spent two days filming there, on 18 and 19 September 2006. The undercity where the Doctor and Martha arrive was filmed at the Cardiff Bay maltings and the Ely Papermill, which were designed to look in disrepair.

40|$|It is {{imperative}} to examine the engineering properties of soil eroded by acid rain {{in order to increase}} our understanding in the effect of acid rain on geotechnical engineering. Two test methods of the permeability and the soak were used to investigate the variation of the physico-chemical behaviors of soils with precipitation of acid rain. Results indicated that there is a more significant effect of <b>artificial</b> acid <b>rain</b> on physico-chemical properties comparing with engineering properties. It is examined that the variations of all the physico-chemical properties such as the increase of pH values of the outflow and seepage water, increase of the cation concentration of the outflow and seepage water, decrease of pH values of the specimen and decrease of the exchangeable cation concentration were caused by ion-exchange reaction between the exchangeable cations of specimens and the H+ ions of acid rain. The concentration of water-soluble cation and the electric conductivity increased with continuing to permeate or soak, there is a larger rate of the increase in Kanto Loam than that in alluvial clay and decomposed granite soil.

There is quite a forest of them: his hot-houses are, perhaps, the most capricious in the world: one off them is forty feet high: in this there is a banana tree which nearly reaches the top. A few years later, in 1829, Jacob Rinz (a visitor from a Frankfurt nursery) commented: never shall I forget the sensation produced by this establishment. I cannot describe the raptures I experienced on seeing that immense palm house. All that I had seen before of the kind appeared nothing to me compared with this.

2500|$|According to Friedkin, {{the most}} {{important}} scene in the film was [...] "the bridge-crossing sequence, wherein the two trucks have to separately cross an old wooden suspension bridge that appears completely unstable". He also deemed it the most arduous scene he has ever filmed. The bridge was designed by John Box using carefully hidden hydraulic components allowing control of {{the movements of the}} bridge and the trucks alike. Its first iteration was constructed in the Dominican Republic over a period of three months, and it required $1 million to complete. However, {{as soon as it was}} finished, Friedkin's crew faced a problem of abnormally low rainfall. During the construction process, the river's water level decreased dramatically, and by the time the bridge was assembled, the river had become completely dry, despite the assurance of local engineers that there had not been any recorded fluctuations in water level during the dry season. Studio executives suggested Friedkin devise a less sophisticated scene, but instead he continued to realize his vision in different locations. Thus, John Box went to scout locations in Mexico and found that the Papaloapan River possessed similar characteristics. The previously constructed bridge had to be disassembled and re-anchored. Friedkin's crew's arrival caused a major disturbance in the vicinity among the locals because of his reputation as a director of The Exorcist. However, a part of the population offered help to finish the structure. Ultimately, this river also became stricken with drought, which forced the application of some practical effects to complete the scene. In order to create <b>artificial</b> <b>rain,</b> Friedkin employed sewage pumps draining water from the river and diverting it to a sprinkler system. This scene alone, which lasts 12 minutes, took several months to complete and cost approximately three million dollars. The director has claimed that during this sequence, the truck teetering against the ropes actually tipped over into the river several times, causing numerous retakes.|$|E

Corrosive solutions for testing the corrosion velocity were 3. 5 % of the neutral sodium chloride solution, <b>artificial</b> acid <b>rain</b> (3. 5 % NaCl+H 2 SO 4 solution) and artificial sweat solution. The research {{results show that the}} corrosion of cold rolled strip occurs easily because grains stretched along the direction of deformation and the existence of residual stress. The maximum corrosion depth of cold-rolled strip is 94. 8 µm. Annealing treatment can effectively reduce the corrosion depth of alloy. Corrosion resistance of alloy rises with the increase of annealing temperature, because the recrystallization degree of alloy goes on more sufficient. The corrosion depth of samples annealed at 600 ℃ and 680 ℃ drops from 64. 45 µm to 56. 32 µm respectively. Aluminum content in the alloy also affects the corrosion resistance of the alloy, because oxygen oxidizes aluminum to density Al 2 O 3 film which prevents the further corrosion of the alloy.

60|$|One of my plants bore two shoots near together, and the tendrils were {{repeatedly}} drawn {{across one}} another, {{but it is}} a singular fact that they did not once catch each other.

I have, however, seen several tendrils of Bryonia dioica interlocked, but they subsequently released one another.

60|$|It {{is also a}} {{remarkable}} fact, that drops of water falling from a height, whether under the form of natural or <b>artificial</b> <b>rain,</b> do not cause the tentacles to move; yet the drops must strike the glands with considerable force, more especially after the secretion has been all washed away by heavy rain; and this often occurs, [page 36] though the secretion is so viscid {{that it can be}} removed with difficulty merely by waving the leaves in water. If the falling drops of water are small, they adhere to the secretion, the weight of which must be increased in a much greater degree, as before remarked, than by the addition of minute particles of solid matter; yet the drops never cause the tentacles to become inflected. It would obviously have been a great evil to the plant (as in the case of occasional touches) if the tentacles were excited to bend by every shower of rain; but this evil has been avoided by the glands either having become through habit insensible to the blows and prolonged pressure of drops of water, or to their having been originally rendered sensitive solely to the contact of solid bodies. We shall hereafter see that the filaments on the leaves of Dionaea are likewise insensible to the impact of fluids, though exquisitely sensitive to momentary touches from any solid body.|$|E

Whatever the class of vegetal cover and the rainfall intensity, with the exception of two plots probably affected by biological activity, I decreased regularly to a steady rate < 2 mm h(- 1) after 15 min rain. There was no significant correlation between I and Pr with vegetal cover. The average SC computed from the two rains increased from 0. 16 g L- 1 (class A) to 48. 5 g L- 1 (class F) while SL was varied between 4 g m(- 2) h(- 1) for A and 1883 g m(- 2) h(- 1) for F. SL increased significantly with decreasing vegetal cover with an exponential increase while the removal of the A horizon increased SC and SL by a factor of 4. The results support the belief that soil vegetation cover and overgrazing plays a major role in soil infiltration by water but also suggest that the interrill erosion process is self-increasing.
