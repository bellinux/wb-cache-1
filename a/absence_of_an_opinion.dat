On the one hand, the description of communicative behaviour is <b>a</b> component <b>of</b> the description of any language as cultural-historical phenomenon; on the other, the given behaviour is based on the certain developed and standard social norms. This behaviour can be implemented in oral and written speech of participants of process of communications, and also in nonverbal displays of dialogue, and may serve as <b>a</b> means <b>of</b> self-realisation of the person. The problem of vocational training system is to create conditions for development of skills of such behaviour. The future experts as potential members of the general creative process should be ready to observance of available norms and traditions of dialogue {{and at the same time}} should possess ability to refuse the fixed, trivial representations while analysing and making decisions of actual workplace issues.

40|$|A {{key problem}} faced in many {{diagnostic}} studies is the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single reference standard that can accurately distinguish between patients {{with and without}} the target condition. This problem is commonly referred to as: <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gold standard. In the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gold standard, the classification of the target condition is prone to error. When these classification errors are ignored, {{the evaluation of the}} accuracy of the test(s) under evaluation or the estimation of the prevalence of the target condition can be severely biased. This thesis examines potential solutions that are aimed at alleviating the problems associated with the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gold standard. In particular, we focus on latent class modeling and composite reference standards: two commonly used methods in diagnostic test evaluation literature. There is currently no consensus on how to best address the frequently encountered <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gold standard problem. In this thesis we show that composite reference standards can cause large biases in inferences about diagnostic test accuracy and target condition disease prevalence. It is also shown that latent class analysis should be used with caution. We suggest various approaches to improve latent class analysis by augmenting the diagnostic test data. Future research should be directed at further elucidating the merits and pitfalls of statistical modeling to account for the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gold standard...|$|R
