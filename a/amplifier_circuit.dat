25|$|The {{practical}} <b>amplifier</b> <b>circuit</b> to {{the right}} could {{be the basis for}} a moderate-power audio amplifier. It features a typical (though substantially simplified) design as found in modern amplifiers, with a class-AB push–pull output stage, and uses some overall negative feedback. Bipolar transistors are shown, but this design would also be realizable with FETs or valves.|$|E
25|$|To employ this formula, {{one has to}} {{identify}} a critical controlled source for the particular <b>amplifier</b> <b>circuit</b> in hand. For example, P could be the control parameter {{of one of the}} controlled sources in a two-port network, as shown for a particular case in D'Amico et al. As a different example, if we take a12 = a12 = 1, P = A, a22 = – (negative feedback) and a11 = 0 (no feedforward), we regain the simple result with two unidirectional blocks.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>amplifier</b> <b>circuit</b> has an [...] "open loop" [...] performance. This is {{described}} by various parameters (gain, slew rate, output impedance, distortion, bandwidth, signal to noise ratio, etc.).

2500|$|An {{operational}} amplifier is an <b>amplifier</b> <b>circuit</b> which typically has very high open loop gain and differential inputs. Op amps {{have become very}} widely used as standardized [...] "gain blocks" [...] in circuits due to their versatility; their gain, bandwidth and other characteristics can be controlled by feedback through an external circuit. [...] Though the term today commonly applies to integrated circuits, the original {{operational amplifier}} design used valves, and later designs used discrete transistor circuits.|$|E
2500|$|Any meter will {{load the}} circuit under test to some extent. For example, a {{multimeter}} using a moving coil movement with full-scale deflection current of 50 microamps, the highest sensitivity commonly available, must draw at least 50 microamps from the circuit under {{test for the}} meter {{to reach the top}} end of its scale. This may load a high-impedance circuit so much as to affect the circuit, thereby giving a low reading. The full-scale deflection current may also be expressed in terms of [...] "ohms per volt". The ohms per volt figure is often called the [...] "sensitivity" [...] of the instrument. Thus a meter with a 50 microampere movement will have a [...] "sensitivity" [...] of 20,000 ohms per volt. [...] "Per volt" [...] refers {{to the fact that the}} impedance the meter presents to the circuit under test will be 20,000 ohms multiplied by the full-scale voltage to which the meter is set. For example, if the meter is set to a range of 300 volts full scale, the meter's impedance will be 6 megohms. 20,000 ohms per volt is the best (highest) sensitivity available for typical analog multimeters that lack internal amplifiers. For meters that do have internal amplifiers (VTVMs, FETVMs, etc.), the input impedance is fixed by the <b>amplifier</b> <b>circuit.</b>|$|E
