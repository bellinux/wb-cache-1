5|$|In a {{biological}} symbiosis one organism typically shores up some weakness or deficiency of the other(s). As {{in such a}} symbiosis, Odin the father of all humans and gods, though in human form was imperfect by himself. As a separate entity he lacked depth perception (being one-eyed) and he was apparently also uninformed and forgetful. But his weaknesses were compensated by his ravens, Hugin (mind) and Munin (memory) {{who were part of}} him. They perched on his shoulders and reconnoitered {{to the ends of the}} earth each day to return in the evening and tell him the news. He also had two wolves at his side, and the man/god-raven-wolf association was like one single organism in which the ravens were the eyes, mind, and memory, and the wolves the providers of meat and nourishment. As god, Odin was the ethereal part—he only drank wine and spoke only in poetry. I wondered if the Odin myth was a metaphor that playfully and poetically encapsulates ancient knowledge of our prehistoric past as hunters in association with two allies to produce a powerful hunting alliance. It would reflect <b>a</b> <b>past</b> <b>that</b> we have long forgotten and whose meaning has been obscured and badly frayed as we abandoned our hunting cultures to become herders and agriculturists, to whom ravens act as competitors.|$|E
25|$|The {{historian}} Henry Rousso (Vichy, <b>a</b> <b>past</b> <b>that</b> {{does not}} pass, 1996) criticized him for simplifying all militant or communist sympathizers as accomplices {{of the crimes}} of Stalinism and, by extension, considered all to be conditionally allied with communist forces or with the Soviets as blind accomplices of Stalin.|$|E

25|$|The {{narrative}} use of fragmented {{sentences and}} stream of consciousness does {{not conform to}} the rules of traditional grammar or sentence structure. These methods encourage the reader to better understand the psyche and experiences of the protagonist. The timing of the publication is significant: during the 1980s, Austria's younger generation was trying {{to come to grips with}} their country's Nazi past. The story of a February hidden in shadows—February Shadows—forces the readers, most of whom would be Austrians, to relieve the experience of that February and thus remember <b>a</b> <b>past</b> <b>that</b> most Austrians wanted to suppress. In this way, it is both a culturally revealing and politically charged story.|$|E
25|$|A Jew can be {{excluded}} from Israeli citizenship under the Law of Return {{if he or she}} is considered to be dangerous to the welfare of the State of Israel. Jews who have <b>a</b> <b>past</b> <b>that</b> involves a serious crime, such as murder, or who are fugitives in another country for any felony (unless they are persecution victims) can be denied citizenship. This clause has been used to exclude applicants a handful of times since Israel's establishment. Notable cases include Robert Soblen, an American Communist who spied for the Soviet Union and fled to Israel in an attempt to escape a life sentence, Meyer Lansky, an American mobster who was initially granted entry to Israel but was expelled two years later, and Victor Vancier, an American Kahanist activist convicted of involvement in a series of bombings.|$|E

2500|$|She used {{three primary}} elements: Christianity, classicism, and hierophantic solar worship. The hierophantic solar worship {{is what she}} brought with her from Africa; the worship of sun gods is {{expressed}} {{as part of her}} African culture. As her parents were sun worshipers, it may be why she used so many different words for the sun. [...] For instance, she uses Aurora eight times, [...] "Apollo seven, Phoebus twelve, and Sol twice."

2500|$|Nolte {{began his}} {{feuilleton}} by remarking {{that it was}} necessary in his opinion to draw a [...] "line under the German past". Nolte argued that the memory of the Nazi era was [...] "a bugaboo, as <b>a</b> <b>past</b> <b>that</b> in the process of establishing itself in the present or that is suspended above the present like an executioner's sword". Nolte complained that excessive present-day interest in the Nazi period had the effect of drawing [...] "attention away from the pressing questions of the present—for example, the question of [...] "unborn life" [...] or the presence of genocide yesterday in Vietnam and today in Afghanistan".|$|E

[...] Head later described her assignment as [...] "the most challenging of my career," [...] and explained her approach with the comment, [...] "Because Norma Desmond was an actress {{who had become}} lost in her own imagination, I tried to make her look like she was always impersonating someone." [...] Head later said she relied on Swanson's expertise because [...] "she was creating <b>a</b> <b>past</b> <b>that</b> she knew and I didn't." [...] Head also designed the costumes for William Holden and the minor characters; but for authenticity, Wilder instructed Von Stroheim and Nancy Olson to wear their own clothing.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{probable}} {{that many of these}} reports were exaggerated. It is certain that the “White Terror” also committed terrible deeds, even though its program contained no analogy to the “extermination of the bourgeoisie”. Nonetheless, the following question must seem permissible, even unavoidable: Did the National Socialists or Hitler perhaps commit an “Asiatic” deed merely because they and their ilk considered themselves to be the potential victims of an “Asiatic” deed? Wasn’t the 'Gulag Archipelago' more original than Auschwitz? Was the Bolshevik murder of an entire class not the logical and factual prius of the [...] "racial murder" [...] of National Socialism?

2500|$|In 1920, {{the brother}} of a student who had {{recently}} committed suicide brought evidence of ongoing homosexual activity among the students to the College's Acting Dean Chester N. Greenough. After consulting with Lowell and under his authority, the Dean convened an ad hoc tribunal of administrators to investigate the charges. It conducted more than 30 interviews behind closed doors and took action against eight students, a recent graduate, and an assistant professor. They were expelled or had their association with the university severed. Lowell proved particularly opposed to readmission {{for those who had}} been expelled only for associating too closely with those more directly involved. He eventually relented in two of four cases. The affair went unreported until 2002, when Harvard President Lawrence Summers called the affair [...] "part of <b>a</b> <b>past</b> <b>that</b> we have rightly left behind." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Conquest {{has always}} been a central and contested theme of Canadian memory—as {{exemplified}} by an episode in 2009, when re-enactors were prevented from restaging the decisive 1759 battles in Quebec. Cornelius Jaenen argues that [...] "The Conquest has remained a difficult subject for French-Canadian historians" [...] who were divided in viewing it. One group sees it as a highly negative economic, political and ideological disaster that threatened a way of life with materialism and Protestantism. At the other pole are those historians who see the positive benefit of enabling the preservation of language, and religion and traditional customs under British rule. French Canadian debates have escalated since the 1960s, as the conquest is seen as a pivotal moment in the history of Québec's nationalism. Historian Jocelyn Létourneau suggested in 2009, that today, [...] "1759 does not belong primarily to <b>a</b> <b>past</b> <b>that</b> we might wish to study and understand, but, rather, to a present and a future that we might wish to shape and control." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{promising}} {{and intelligent}} youth, Morgan contracted meningitis in August 1929. The disease {{left him with}} a total loss of hearing. Emily Morgan kept him home from school for an entire year, hoping that some hearing would return. Deafness cut off his ability to relate to people around him. The once popular, social, and athletic boy became socially introverted, devoting much of his time to reading and study. Morgan recalled that he had not yet reconciled himself to his deafness by the time he returned to school. In 1951, in a letter to Marguerite Sinclair Reusser, he wrote that a minor family crisis in March 1931 led to a hysterical outburst. During this emotional time, Morgan finally confided in his mother the difficulties and fears he had faced over the loss of his hearing. [...] "I began to face the future instead of wasting myself in bitter regret over <b>a</b> <b>past</b> <b>that</b> was beyond my reach. That was the beginning of my adjustment to the fact that my hearing was gone and would probably never return." [...] At this time, he began a lifelong pattern of writing, producing thousands of careful transcriptions, personal letters, and books in his field.|$|E
