5|$|Despite gaining {{considerable}} power {{during the}} mid twentieth-century, {{the governor is}} still much weaker than those of other states. He has no line-item veto authority, and the pocket veto was ruled unconstitutional. If a governor does not sign or reject a bill, it becomes law automatically. This led to a fist fight during the term of Claude Matthews, who was locked out of the House chambers {{to prevent him from}} returning a bill in time. Vetoes are also easily overridden, requiring only a simple majority as opposed to a supermajority. The legislature still exercises final control over the hiring of state employees, but given the large size of the government and the short legislative sessions, they are unable to make any considerable impact other than their continued advocacy for an expanded merit system. The cabinet is still almost entirely independent of the governor, and he has control over only half of the government's <b>agencies,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the Indiana State Police and the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles. Other large <b>agencies,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the Department of Administration, are {{under the control of the}} cabinet.|$|E

5|$|There {{had been}} limited affirmative action {{programmes}} before. However, these mostly {{focused on the}} civil service, as Article 153 of the Constitution did. Admission to higher education was largely merit-based. The Tunku government preferred laissez-faire policies, minimising economic intervention. Although some <b>agencies,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the Rural Industrial Development Agency (RIDA), which attempted to aid Malay entrepreneurs, existed, their programs were criticised as being based on handouts and favouring the politically connected. RIDA was renamed as the Majlis Amanah Rakyat (The Indigenous People's Trust Council) or MARA in 1965, and came to symbolise the development of Malay entrepreneurship.|$|E
5|$|These {{conspiracy}} theorists, {{who are all}} strong {{believers in}} a {{right to keep and}} bear arms, are extremely fearful that the passing of any gun control legislation will be later followed by the abolishment of personal gun ownership and a campaign of gun confiscation, and that the refugee camps of emergency management <b>agencies</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> FEMA will be used for the internment of suspected subversives, making little effort to distinguish true threats to the New World Order from pacifist dissidents.|$|E

5|$|Law {{enforcement}} in the United States is primarily {{the responsibility of}} local police and sheriff's departments, with state police providing broader services. The New York City Police Department (NYPD) is {{the largest in the}} country. Federal <b>agencies</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Marshals Service have specialized duties, including protecting civil rights, national security and enforcing U.S. federal courts' rulings and federal laws. At the federal level and in almost every state, a legal system operates on a common law. State courts conduct most criminal trials; federal courts handle certain designated crimes as well as certain appeals from the state criminal courts. Plea bargaining in the United States is very common; the vast majority of criminal cases in the country are settled by plea bargain rather than jury trial.|$|E
5|$|McVeigh {{later said}} that he had {{contemplated}} assassinating Attorney General Janet Reno, Lon Horiuchi, and others in preference to attacking a building, and after the bombing he {{said that he}} sometimes wished he had carried out a series of assassinations instead. He initially intended only to destroy a federal building, but he later decided that his message would be better received if many people were killed in the bombing. McVeigh's criterion for potential attack sites was that the target should house at least two of three federal law enforcement agencies: the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), or the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). He regarded the presence of additional law enforcement <b>agencies,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the Secret Service or the U.S. Marshals Service, as a bonus.|$|E
