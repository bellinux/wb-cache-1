5|$|The {{barn owl}} hunts by flying slowly, {{quartering}} {{the ground and}} hovering over spots that may conceal prey. It may also use branches, fence posts or other lookouts to scan its surroundings, {{and this is the}} main means of prey location in the oil palm plantations of Malaysia. The bird has long, broad wings, enabling it to manoeuvre and turn abruptly. Its legs and toes are long and slender which improves its ability to forage among dense foliage or beneath the snow and gives it <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> talons when attacking prey. Studies have shown that an individual barn owl may eat one or more voles (or their equivalent) per night, equivalent to about twenty-three percent of the bird's bodyweight. Excess food is often cached at roosting sites and can be used when food is scarce.|$|E

Three US regions were selected for the analysis, California, New York, and Illinois, as these regions include major metropolitan areas with significant variations in their energy generation mixes. The full cycle analysis results were also reported for the US generation mix and renewable electricity to examine cases of average and clean mixes, respectively This 2009 study showed <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> petroleum use and GHG emissions among the different fuel production technologies and grid generation mixes.

2500|$|The {{other problem}} was that the Stangensteuerung never worked well with more than one gun. Two (or even three) guns, mounted side by side and firing simultaneously, would have {{produced}} <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> fire that would have been impossible to match with the [...] "safe zone" [...] between the whirling propeller blades. Fokker's initial answer to this was the fitting of extra [...] "followers" [...] to the Stangensteuerung's large cam wheel, to (theoretically) produce the [...] "ripple" [...] salvo necessary to ensure that the guns were aimed at the same point on the propeller disc. This proved a disastrously unstable arrangement in the case of three guns, and was rather less than satisfactory even for two. Most of the early Fokker and Halberstadt biplane fighters were limited to a single gun for this reason.|$|E

2500|$|Visconti, who {{accepted}} an interviewer's {{suggestion that he}} was Bowie's [...] "voice on earth", commented on the album to the international press and provided insights into the individual tracks. The songs cover <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> subjects and are largely observational: most probe the mind-sets of different individuals. [...] "Valentine's Day" [...] is about a high school shooter. [...] "I'd Rather Be High" [...] related {{the story of a}} Second World War soldier. Visconti described the material as [...] "extremely strong and beautiful". He added [...] "if people are looking for classic Bowie they'll find it on this album, if they're looking for innovative Bowie, new directions, they're going to find that on this album too." [...] Visconti commented that 29 tracks were recorded for the album and suggested that some of the material left out of The Next Day could appear on a subsequent record. Visconti speculated that Bowie could return to the studio to produce a new album later in 2013, but this did not happen.|$|E

Momentum funds hold stocks with higher sentiment betas, and with <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> betas compared to contrarian funds.

The newspaper had <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> subscribers, and employed agents in various cities, as well as abolitionists, for its marketing needs. The paper also received help from African-American churches and local abolition societies by way of fund drives and donations. Occasionally, the newspaper received cash infusions from prominent white allies. All of the donations, fund drives and supplements helped the paper to publish 38 articles and survive through 1841. Thanks to the subscribers, the interesting articles and the extra funding sources, The Colored American became an important paper of its time.|$|E

50|$|The {{change to}} the out of bounds rule in the {{national}} code is often considered to have brought {{an end to the}} era of dominant full-forwards which had existed during the 1930s: century goalkickers such as Gordon Coventry and Bob Pratt in the VFL, Frank Seymour in the VFA, Ken Farmer in South Australia and George Doig in Western Australia had been common during the 1930s, but were decidedly less common over the next thirty years, generally put down to the fact that play could be more safely directed along the boundary lines, bringing the forward pockets and half forward flankers into play and resulting in <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> goalkickers.|$|R

50|$|Gain is also {{dependent}} {{on the number of}} elements and the tuning of those elements. Antennas can be tuned to be resonant over <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> frequencies but, all other things being equal, this will mean the gain of the aerial is lower than one tuned for a single frequency or a group of frequencies. For example, in the case of wideband TV antennas the fall off in gain is particularly large {{at the bottom of the}} TV transmitting band. In the UK this bottom third of the TV band is known as group A; see gain graph comparing grouped aerials to a wideband aerial of the same size/model.|$|R
