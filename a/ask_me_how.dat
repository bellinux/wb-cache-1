I can compare them and I do compare them, because I {{know what it means to}} be called a 'nigger' and I know what it means to be called a 'faggot,' and I understand the differences in the marrow of my bones. And I can sum up that difference in one word: none.|$|E
500|$|The Stork Club {{was owned}} and {{operated}} by Sherman Billingsley (1896–1966) an ex-bootlegger who came to New York from Enid, Oklahoma. [...] The Stork Club first opened in 1929 at 132 West 58th Street, just down the street from Billingsley's apartment at 152 West 58th Street. Billingsley's handwritten recollections of the early days recall that he was approached by two gamblers he knew from Oklahoma in his New York real estate office, proposing to open a restaurant together, which he accepted. The origin of the name of the club is unknown; Billingsley once remarked, [...] "Don't <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> or why I picked the name, because I just don't remember." [...] New York City's El Morocco had the sophistication and Toots Shor's drew the sporting crowd, but the Stork Club mixed power, money, and glamor. [...] Unlike its competitors, the Stork stayed open on Sunday nights and during the summer months.|$|E
500|$|Elisabeth Moss {{said she}} was not told by Weiner that Peggy would be leaving SCDP [...] "until we were {{shooting}} episode 10, the one right before it. It was unusual that he didn't tell me. He usually tells me what's happening, pitches me things to <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> they sound." [...] Moss' initial reaction [...] "was just one of feeling like {{there was really no}} other logical way to go for her. After everything that had happened for five years, she can't just keep butting her head up against that wall. [...] She's becoming her own person and she needs to have her own place not under Don." [...] Moss also said, [...] "I will thank [...] forever for not telling me. It would have made my life harder. I knew about Peggy's baby in season one. I fought against it, to play it as she was living it, feeling it, and not be in my head. Not knowing Peggy would quit allowed me to find it for myself, to really feel Peggy's growing frustration with Don all season." ...|$|E

500|$|Aaron Riccio of Slant Magazine also rated {{it three}} out of four stars, stated [...] "Strike Back isn't {{brilliant}} television, but it's plenty entertaining, and by fitting the action of 24 with the grit of The Unit (and the nudity of Cinemax), it fills a [...]22 caliber hole in American television." [...] However Riccio added that the downside to the series was that [...] "not enough time is given over to the fractious [...] "buddy-cop" [...] relationship between the two main characters, Scott and Stonebridge, whereas quite a bit of time is spent with the villains." [...] Hank Stuever of The Washington Post called it [...] "surprisingly stylish and addictive," [...] adding [...] "Fans of [...] "24," [...] which bowed last year, still <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> to fill that void. They want just enough intelligence-agency hooey to make the unbelievable seem somewhat real. Until [...] "Strike Back," [...] I didn't have a good answer." [...] Stuever lauded Scott and Stapleton's portrayal, stating he is [...] "the real find here, a thoroughly unlikable loser" [...] who [...] "saves the show from a dour sense of duty," [...] adding that Staplton [...] "seems to have been created in a laboratory experiment that grafted Ewan McGregor's personality and smile onto Hugh Jackman's body — with more than adequate results." ...|$|E
500|$|Yar's {{death in}} the episode was after Crosby had asked to be let out of her contract, and rumors had {{circulated}} of her departure. She later described her time spent on Star Trek: The Next Generation as [...] "miserable", and it was well known {{at the time that}} she was unhappy with the way her role had been developed. She later said that if she'd had more scenes written for her similar to the one she shared with Worf {{at the start of the}} episode then she wouldn't have wanted to leave the show. Yar's memorial scene was filmed twice, the first was with Crosby reciting the lines while looking straight ahead, which was the director's preferred choice. However a version with her looking towards each of the other characters in turn was ultimately used. Scanlan later said [...] "Don't <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> she knew where they'd be standing". Marina Sirtis's tears in the scene were real, as she was cued by Crosby standing off camera. [...] "Skin of Evil" [...] was not the last episode in the first season in which Denise Crosby appeared. [...] "" [...] was subsequently filmed after this episode, but was aired earlier in the run. In fact, toward the end of [...] "Symbiosis" [...] you can see Crosby waving goodbye to the fans (it is the scene where Picard and Crusher leave the cargo bay). Crosby would also later return to the Yar role in [...] "Yesterday's Enterprise", the two part series finale [...] "" [...] and as Yar's half-Romulan daughter Sela in several episodes. Guest stars in [...] "Skin of Evil" [...] included Walker Boone as Leland T. Lynch, Brad Zerbst as a nurse and Raymond Forchion as Ben Prieto. Even though this episode marked the death of Yar, Crosby would be credited for the remaining three first season episodes.|$|E

2500|$|Afterwards, {{a police}} {{sergeant}} {{said that the}} main street in Marysville had been destroyed: [...] "The motel {{at one end of}} it partially exists. The bakery has survived. Don't <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>how.</b> Everything else is just nuked." [...] Reports on 11 February estimated that around 100 of the town's population of approximately 500 had believed to have perished, and that only [...] "a dozen" [...] buildings were left. Premier Brumby described the situation: [...] "There's no activity, there's no people, there's no buildings, there's no birds, there's no animals, everything's just gone. So the fatality rate will be very high." ...|$|E

2500|$|To {{supplement}} his income, {{the young}} Domingo {{played the piano}} for a ballet company, [...] {{as well as for}} a program on Mexico's newly founded cultural television station. The program consisted of excerpts from zarzuelas, operettas, operas, and musical comedies. He acted in a few small parts while at the theater in plays by Federico García Lorca, Luigi Pirandello, and Anton Chekhov. He also provided song arrangements and backup vocals for Los Camisas Negras in the late 1950s, a rock-and-roll band led by César Costa. In his autobiography, Domingo reflected on the benefits of his busy and varied career as a teenager: [...] "Today, when people <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> I manage to hold up under my extremely heavy work load, I answer that I became accustomed to intense activity very early in my life and that I love it now as I loved it then." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Atlanta {{acoustic}} {{music scene}} {{at the time was}} split between the Trackside and The Freight Room. [...] When The Freight Room closed in 1992, Conoscenti, Wilcox, and most of Atlanta's other notable musicians like The Indigo Girls, Shawn Mullins, Kristian Bush, and others moved to Eddie's Attic. His first record, Carved in Stone on the DB Records label was released that year, followed by Beneath Your Moon. In 1994, he met Ellis Paul at Eddie's, and the two have been close friends and collaborators since. Conoscenti frequently plays guitar at Paul's shows around the country, including accompanying Paul for many years at his traditional New Year's Eve shows at Club Passim in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Conoscenti left Atlanta that year and toured the country almost continuously until 2004. [...] During that time he released Boxes of Bones, My Brilliant Masterpiece, One for the Road, Mysterious Light, Paradox of Grace, Extremely Live at Eddie's Attic, and Turn Here. Mysterious Light climbed into the top 20 albums played by folk and acoustic DJs worldwide. In his review of My Brilliant Masterpiece for the Folk and Acoustic Music Exchange, Shawn Linderman said: [...] "Weaving in and out of love from both directions, touching on friendships and loss, Don Conoscenti's latest solo acoustic work is cozy and warm. But don't be misled into thinking these tunes are slow and simple. Don can be blistering away on guitar, stretching his vocal range to its limits and interspersing wild wails and growls, and yet the song still comes across as comforting. Don't <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> he does it-- that's what's so damned fascinating about his music!" ...|$|E
