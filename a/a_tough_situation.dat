25|$|In {{the final}} {{race of the}} Contender Round at Talladega, Harvick was again in <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> <b>situation.</b> During a green-white-checker restart, Harvick's car was unable to accelerate, which {{triggered}} a multi-car wreck. Due to the caution being displayed quickly after the leaders crossed the line, the race was considered official, and Joey Logano was declared the winner. Denny Hamlin, who was competing with Harvick for {{a spot in the}} next round, was caught up in the wreck, and was eliminated from the Chase. Harvick managed to avoid the wreck, and finished 15th, advancing him to the next round in the Chase. Trevor Bayne, who was hit in the quarter panel by Harvick which triggered the wreck, accused him of intentionally spinning him out in order to secure a spot in the next round. Kevin Harvick and his crew chief, Rodney Childers, claimed that they had tried {{to move out of the}} way during the restart, knowing that their engine was failing. In the first race of the Eliminator Round, Harvick finished 8th at Martinsville. The next week at Texas, he managed to finish 3rd, despite having a faulty shifter which forced him to drive with one hand for the last several laps. In the final race before the Championship Round, at Phoenix, Harvick dominated the race, leading 143 of 219 laps. Unfortunately, the race did not go the distance due to rain, and at the time Dale Earnhardt Jr was the leader of the race due to the caution coming out during green flag pit stops, and he was ultimately the winner as well. Kevin Harvick finished the race in the 2nd position, advancing him to the Championship Round at Homestead-Miami Speedway.|$|E
500|$|Paul Watson {{said he was}} not {{offended}} by his portrayal in the episode, and was glad [...] "Whale Whores" [...] brought the issue of dolphin and whale slaughter to a large audience, as well as the role of the Japanese in the deaths. Watson said, [...] "It's <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> <b>situation</b> we are in. We can't hurt the whalers and we have to stay within the boundaries of the law in opposing illegal whaling operations. If that makes us pussies, so be it. It's better than being portrayed as killers." [...] Watson said the episode failed to portray that his actions have hurt Japanese profits from whaling, but that the episode demonstrated how successful Whale Wars and the Sea Shepherd has been.|$|E
500|$|Ford played center, linebacker, {{and long}} snapper for the school's {{football}} team, {{and helped the}} Wolverines in two undefeated seasons and national titles in 1932 and 1933. The team suffered a steep decline in his 1934 senior year, however, winning only one game. Ford was the team's star nonetheless. After a game during which Michigan held heavily favored Minnesota (the eventual national champion) to a scoreless tie in the first half, assistant coach Bennie Oosterbaan later said, [...] "When I walked into the dressing room at halftime, I had {{tears in my eyes}} I was so proud of them. Ford and [...] Sweet played their hearts out. They were everywhere on defense." [...] Ford later recalled, [...] "During 25 years in the rough-and-tumble world of politics, I often thought of the experiences before, during, and after that game in 1934. Remembering them has helped me many times to face <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> <b>situation,</b> take action, and make every effort possible despite adverse odds." [...] His teammates later voted Ford their most valuable player, with one assistant coach noting, [...] "They felt Jerry was one guy who would stay and fight in a losing cause." ...|$|E

500|$|Though {{he was not}} a power pitcher, Hoffman was a strikeout pitcher. His 9.36 K/9 was the fifth-highest in MLB history, {{and highest}} ever among relievers. Sports {{journalist}} Fran Zimniuch wrote in Fireman: The Evolution of the Closer in Baseball that Hoffman was [...] "a thinking man's closer, using guile rather than heat." [...] As the velocity of his fastball decreased, he compensated with a devastating changeup that is as synonymous a pitch with Hoffman as the splitter is with Bruce Sutter or the cutter is with Mariano Rivera. [...] "It's <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> <b>situation</b> throwing a change-up in the ninth inning, unless you've got Trevor's changeup", closer Billy Wagner said. [...] "There's not many guys who have a changeup that's dominating", All-Star third basemen Scott Rolen said. [...] "But his is dominating. It's a weapon. That's not usually a word you use with a changeup." [...] Robb Nen, a retired closer, was amazed at how Hoffman got better after he lost velocity on his fastball. [...] "I don't think I could do it, to just lose the ability to throw 95 and still be one of the best. I have tremendous respect for him", Nen said. Another retired closer, Troy Percival, concurred about the difficulty in transforming from a power pitching style. [...] "It's not easy to do. Guys who throw 95, 96 [...] have an ego about being able to do that. [...] just went right into, 'Hey, you know, I throw 87 now. This is what I've got.' And he goes out there and gets it done just as well as he ever did." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Physical store {{retailers}} are facing <b>a</b> <b>tougher</b> <b>situation</b> than ever. In order to tackle this <b>tough</b> <b>situation,</b> {{they need not}} only to reduce cost by effectively executing SCM but also to introduce measures to increase profit like CRM. They are effective by themselves, {{but if they are}} combined the retailers can enjoy more benefits from these practices. However, there is no good application that realize both two business practices together. In this study, assuming that RFID system captures consumer behavior information on the sales floor, we propose an application, in which discount prices are offered to FSP member customers based on their loyalty level and the discount prices are computed to achieve a target inventory turnover rate. To realize this application, we also propose two algorithms that effectively control an inventory turnover rate at the same time reward FSP customers based on their loyalty status. For evaluation, we develop a prototype system of the application for a proof of concept and run a numerical study to show the validity of the proposed algorithms...|$|R

2500|$|Greg Vaughan, who had {{recently}} been let go from his role as Diego Guittierez on The Young and the Restless, was cast shortly thereafter and first appeared on February 20, 2003. Vaughan later described his screen test to Soap Opera Digest: [...] "I {{was a little bit}} intimidated. I knew about the character, the foundation of the story. I knew it was a difficult task that I was about to take on." [...] In July 2009, Vaughan denied rumors that he was being let go or put on recurring status. That September, ABC announced that Vaughan had decided to leave to explore other opportunities, and that Jackson would be reprising the role. However, Vaughan announced via Twitter that it was the network that decided to let him go. Jackson stated upon returning: [...] "It was <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> <b>situation.</b> I was not under any sort of headspace that someone was losing their job; it was that the role was opening up. (...) It was more of a confusing thing for me coming back and not knowing exactly what was going on, {{on the other end of}} things."

2500|$|Project {{costs were}} between US$1.2 and $1.3 million, necessitating ABC's {{financial}} support (and with it, their demand of a safety harness). [...] "I'd dare say that {{never in the}} history of the circus industry has there been one event that costs this much," [...] said Wallenda. [...] The production was a serious financial strain on Wallenda. [...] "It's been <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> <b>situation</b> all around", he said a week before the event, blaming the lingering fight over the safety harness for inhibiting sponsorship deals. [...] When production costs ran over the original estimate of $1 million, he appealed to the public for help using the fundraising website Indiegogo. [...] He eventually met his goal of $50,000. [...] Additionally, Niagara Falls, Ontario, mayor Jim Diodati asked local businesses to chip in, saying he hoped to raise $250,000. [...] Ultimately, he helped generate about $200,000 of support from local business associations. [...] The main causes of the overrun were the need to produce two custom cables – one for the performance and a shorter one for practice – and the need to hire a new helicopter company to set up the cable at the last minute, after the original one discovered they did not hold the necessary licenses. [...] After the event, Wallenda said he had probably lost money on the event; however, he added, it was [...] "clearly worth it" [...] in the long term. [...] With all but one bill accounted for, Wallenda said he lost less than $50,000 on the event. [...] The fundraising, combined with several contractors lowering their bills, helped him get close to budget. [...] "I think people still have the impression that Nik Wallenda is going to walk away from this thing making millions of dollars, but that's not the case," [...] he commented.|$|E

40|$|The {{opinions}} {{of people are}} expected to forecast their actions, and even major economic institutions rely on this correlation. This research paper examines a case when the opinion of people about their financial situation contradicts their financial-related actions. In 2012 in Hungary the general opinion of people about their financial situation was showing the lowest confidence in the world, with a significant declining trend, reaching an extremely low level. Although the general expectation would be that this pessimism triggers a set-back in consumer spending, figures show that Hungarians were {{on the other end of}} the scale regarding their expenditures and were greatly increasing their spending. This raises the question: why do people say they are in such <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> financial <b>situation</b> yet instead of saving they increase their spending? This paper presents a cross-country analysis that reviews the severity of this discrepancy, as well as proves the validity of the question by excluding several alternative explanations, followed by a recommendation and hypotheses for a detailed research to explain the phenomenon...|$|R

40|$|This is a {{research}} into the assessment of tourism industry quality and programing for its development in Iran. In <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> economic <b>situation,</b> the hypothesis is to grow and develop the national economy {{with the help of}} the tourism industry. A unified assessment of tourism industry quality, method is made use of in this study, which is based on the case study of all elements of Iran tourism industry system. Quality assessment by means of unified problems (indicators) that hinder the maximum development of the tourism industry shows the reliability of the hypothesis. SWOT analysis aided to determine the weaknesses and threats aiming at raising the quality of the indicators. In addition, a linear programming from the standpoint of internal and external relations with national economy has been applied. The analysis revealed that the system of the tourism industry is unable to assist the macro economy. The failure corresponds to scarcely favorable natural environmental conditions, capacity for motivating to visitors, tourism marketing, and tourism infrastructures. After remedy actions, prospects for tourism industry development despite the complicated situation are quite favorable due to the advantageous climate, natural characteristics, cultural and ancient heritages, tourism resources, and educated labor. The methods applied by this paper suggest adaptive governance tools suitable to apply for optimization of the tourism industry everywhere similar to Iran...|$|R

However, the standard of collection management {{has been the subject of}} considerable concern and criticism in the specialist press because, essentially, the museum has insufficient money to fund the upkeep of the many historic boats in the collection. Unlike the National Railway Museum, which receives funding direct from HM Government, the NWM only receives public money through the Canal and River Trust, previously British Waterways. During the winter of 2008-2009, opening hours were cut at Gloucester and Ellesmere Port to just two days per week in an effort to manage <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> financial <b>situation.</b> Some boats were advertised in Museums Journal early in 2009 for disposal, there being insufficient money for their restoration.

However, the initiative to create a Heritage Boatyard, with lottery and other funding, has spurred a revival in the museum's fortunes and work on addressing the areas of maintenance is now taking place. The Heritage Boatyard trains young people in skills that might otherwise be lost. Two boats, Ilkeston and Ferret, are sponsored by the London Canal Museum, which contributes annually to the cost of their maintenance.|$|R
