5|$|After the {{expiration}} of the trademark {{in the late}} 1990s, Burger King unsuccessfully tried to introduce the brand to the continent. After losing a lawsuit filed against it by Hungry Jack's ownership, the company ceded the territory to its franchisee. Hungry Jack's is now the only Burger King brand in Australia; Cowin's company Hungry Jack's PTY is the master franchise and thus is now responsible for oversight of the operations that country with Burger King only providing administrative and <b>advertising</b> <b>support</b> to ensure a common marketing scheme for {{the company and its}} products.|$|E
5|$|After Burger King Corporation {{lost the}} case, {{it decided to}} {{terminate}} its operations in the country, and in July 2002, the company transferred its assets to its New Zealand franchise group, Trans-Pacific Foods (TPF). The terms of the sale had TPF assume oversight of the Burger King franchises {{in the region as}} the Burger King brand's master franchisee. Trans-Pacific Foods administered the chain's 81 locations until September 2003 when the new management team of Burger King Corporation reached an agreement with Hungry Jack's Pty Ltd to re-brand the existing Burger King locations to Hungry Jack's and make HJP the sole master franchisee of both brands. An additional part of the agreement required Burger King Corporation to provide administrative and <b>advertising</b> <b>support</b> as to insure a common marketing scheme for the company and its products. Trans-Pacific Foods transferred its control of the Burger King franchises to Hungry Jack's Pty Ltd, which subsequently renamed the remaining Burger King locations as Hungry Jack's.|$|E

25|$|The station {{carried on}} for more than a year, {{carrying}} NBC, two newscasts a day, a typical slate of syndicated sitcom and drama reruns, and a few local productions. <b>Advertising</b> <b>support</b> was initially weak in the small market, and financial losses started mounting. As early as April and May 1974, the station began advertising in The Free Lance-Star that stock in Television Fredericksburg, Inc. was available to local residents. One of two non-news productions, the daily Children's World, was canceled and replaced by the then-relatively unknown The Phil Donahue Show {{at the end of the}} 1973-74 season. The station's financial losses accelerated during the summer.|$|E
25|$|The Indian {{newspapers}} depend a {{great deal}} on governmental advertising; without such revenues, {{it would be difficult for}} many Indian newspapers to stay in business. Unfortunately, this has kept many of them vulnerable to government manipulation. The large-scale possibility of such manipulation, however, was not fully demonstrated until Indira Gandhi's government decided to take advantage of this unique circumstance. In the beginning of censorship, when a few leading newspapers such as The Indian Express and The Statesman refused to abide the governmental censorship, the government withdrew its <b>advertising</b> <b>support</b> from these newspapers. Later on, this type of financial castigation was used on several other rebellious newspapers.|$|E
500|$|Hasbro withdrew its £5.5m <b>advertising</b> <b>support</b> for the Sindy doll in 1997 amid rumours {{that major}} {{retailers}} {{were planning to}} delist the doll. The editor of UK Toy News, Jon Salisbury, said, [...] "This is Hasbro taking Sindy out of its main range. But she is running so far behind Barbie it is almost a non-issue. If delisted by bigger retailers, {{which seems to be}} happening, then the brand will lose momentum". In 1994, Sindy had a seven percent share of the £70m doll market, and Barbie held 16%. By 1996, Barbie's share had increased to 30%, estimated by Mattel to be worth £100m per year including licensing deals, and Sindy's share had only climbed to eight percent. Sindy's popularity had also been overtaken during that period by Polly Pocket. One explanation for the large variation in market share is the unpopular Americanisation of the Sindy doll in the mid-1980s. The Sindy doll was still available to retailers during this period, but had to be ordered in bulk from the Hong Kong manufacturer.|$|E

500|$|Street & Smith was {{acquired}} by Samuel Newhouse, the owner of [...] Condé Nast, in August 1959, though Street & Smith was not merged into Condé Nast {{until the end of}} 1961. [...] Analog was the only digest-sized magazine in Condé Nast's inventory—all the others were slicks, such as Vogue and Vanity Fair. [...] All the advertisers in these magazines had plates made up {{to take advantage of this}} size, and Condé Nast changed Analog to the larger size from the March 1963 issue to conform. [...] The front and back signatures were changed to glossy paper, to carry both advertisements and scientific features. [...] The change did not attract <b>advertising</b> <b>support,</b> however, and from the April 1965 issue Analog reverted to digest size once again. [...] Circulation, which had been increasing before the change, was not harmed, and continued to increase while Analog was in slick format. [...] From the April 1965 issue the title switched the [...] "fiction" [...] and [...] "fact" [...] elements, so that it became Analog Science Fiction/Science Fact.|$|E
500|$|Cool World {{opened at}} sixth on the North American box office, with $5.5 million. Its {{lifetime}} gross was $14.1 million, {{a little more}} than half its reported $28 million budget. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes collected a sample of 45 reviews and judged 4% of them to be positive. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote that Cool World [...] "misses one opportunity after another", describing it as [...] "a surprisingly incompetent film". Deseret News reviewer Chris Hicks described it as [...] "a one-joke movie – and it's a dirty joke. [...] And much of what's going on here seems more angry and nasty than inspired or funny." [...] Variety reviewer Brian Lowry compared the film to an extended music video, praising the soundtrack and visuals, but panning the story. Leonard Maltin described the film as [...] "too serious to be fun [...] too goofy to take seriously", and the lead characters as [...] "unlikable and unappealing". The Washington Post reviewer Hal Hinson wondered [...] "whether Kim Basinger is more obnoxious as a cartoon or as a real person," [...] and felt that the combination of animation and live action was unconvincing. Contributing to the low box office was the fact the studio withdrew all <b>advertising</b> <b>support</b> after the opening weekend.|$|E
500|$|During {{the course}} of filming, a {{decision}} was made {{to take advantage of a}} massive flooding of the San Joaquin River in central California in order to obtain some spectacular footage for the film. The female collie was still in training and refused to enter the raging waters created by the flood. Weatherwax was on the site with Pal and offered to have his dog perform in a five-stage shot in which Pal would swim the river, haul himself out, lie down without shaking the water off his coat, attempt to crawl while lying on his side and finally lie motionless, completely exhausted. Pal performed exceptionally well and the scene was completed in one take. Weatherwax said [...] director Fred M. Wilcox was so impressed with Pal during the sequence that he had [...] "tears in his eyes." [...] In response, producers released the female collie and hired Pal in her stead, reshooting the first six weeks of the filming with Pal now portraying Lassie. Other sources say that the female collie was replaced because she began to shed excessively during shooting of the film in the summer, resulting in Weatherwax substituting the male collie, Pal, in the role of [...] "Lassie". In any case, MGM executives were so impressed, they upgraded the production to an A film with full <b>advertising</b> <b>support,</b> top publicity and filming in Technicolor. Pal went through his paces with enthusiasm, rarely required multiple retakes, and did his own stunt work.|$|E
