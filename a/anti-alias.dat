Graphically, the Dark Alliance engine is a major improvement over the engine used by the original PC Baldur's Gate games, the Infinity Engine. Infinity was only able to render 2D sprite characters and static environments. The Dark Alliance engine, on the other hand, made use of the PlayStation 2's advanced GPU, allowing for such improvements as dynamic lighting, real-time shadowing and 3D models of characters and environments. IGN wrote of the E3 presentation, [...] "None of the problems that are commonly associated with PlayStation 2 games, such as low-res textures, flickering, or aliasing problems, are to be found here. It's hard to think of a game that pulls off the much-fabled anti-aliasing as well as this game does. Dark Alliance uses a technique similar to what a large number of Dreamcast games did to pull off their clean look: they simply render the scene at a much higher resolution, <b>anti-alias</b> it, then drop it down to a more acceptable resolution for TVs. The result is a beautifully anti-aliased game." ...|$|E

5000|$|Super {{sampling}} <b>anti-aliasing</b> (SSAA), {{also called}} full-scene <b>anti-aliasing</b> (FSAA), {{is used to}} avoid aliasing (or [...] "jaggies") on full-screen images. SSAA was the first type of <b>anti-aliasing</b> available with early video cards. But due to its tremendous computational cost {{and the advent of}} multisample <b>anti-aliasing</b> (MSAA) support on GPUs, it is no longer widely used in real time applications. MSAA provides somewhat lower graphic quality, but also tremendous savings in computational power.|$|R

50|$|Alternatively, {{a signal}} may be {{intentionally}} oversampled without an intermediate frequency {{to reduce the}} requirements on the <b>anti-alias</b> filter. For example, CD audio typically extends up to 20 kHz, but is sampled with a 22.05 kHz Nyquist rate. By oversampling by 2.05 kHz, both aliasing and attenuation of higher audio frequencies can be prevented even with less than ideal filters.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a new <b>anti-aliasing</b> {{technique}} for wide band networked control schemes.

50|$|A {{graphics}} rendering system {{creates an}} image based on objects constructed of polygonal primitives; the aliasing {{effects in the}} image can be reduced by applying an <b>anti-aliasing</b> scheme only to {{the areas of the}} image representing silhouette edges of the objects. The silhouette edges are <b>anti-aliased</b> by creating <b>anti-aliasing</b> primitives which vary in opacity. These <b>anti-aliasing</b> primitives are joined to the silhouetted edges, and create a region in the image where the objects appear to blend into the background. The method has some important advantages over classical methods based on the accumulation buffer since it generates full-scene <b>anti-aliasing</b> in only two passes and does not require the use of additional memory required by the accumulation buffer. Object-based <b>anti-aliasing</b> was first developed at Silicon Graphics for their Indy workstation.|$|R
50|$|In signal {{acquisition}} and audio, <b>anti-aliasing</b> is often done using an analogue <b>anti-aliasing</b> filter {{to remove the}} out-of-band component of the input signal prior to sampling with an analogue-to-digital converter. In digital photography, optical <b>anti-aliasing</b> filters are made of birefringent materials, and smooth the signal in the spatial optical domain. The <b>anti-aliasing</b> filter essentially blurs the image slightly {{in order to reduce}} the resolution to or below that achievable by the digital sensor (the larger the pixel pitch, the lower the achievable resolution at the sensor level).|$|R
50|$|For {{signals that}} are {{bandwidth}} limited, but not centered at zero, a band-pass filter {{can be used}} as an anti-aliasing filter. For example, this could be done with a single-sideband modulated or frequency modulated signal. If one desired to sample an FM radio broadcast centered at 87.9 MHz and bandlimited to a 200 kHz band, then an appropriate <b>anti-alias</b> filter would be centered on 87.9 MHz with 200 kHz bandwidth (or pass-band of 87.8 MHz to 88.0 MHz), and the sampling rate would be no less than 400 kHz, but should also satisfy other constraints to prevent aliasing.|$|E
50|$|The M8 {{supports}} all existing Leica M-mount lenses, however {{some older}} models might not offer all the functions due to mismatching cams. All lenses are multiplied by a 1.33x crop factor, hence a 28mm lens will act approximately like a 35mm when mounted to the M8. Because the sensor lacks an infrared filter, an IR-cut filter {{in front of}} the lens is recommended. In addition, Leica chooses to omit the <b>Anti-Alias</b> filter, citing the reason for higher resolution power of the lens. However, the moiré artifacts can occur in scenes with closely spaced geometric patterns, such as fabric or mesh, distant buildings, balcony railings, corrugated roofing etc.|$|E
50|$|The {{distinguishing}} feature for this series is presence of four fast, 12-bit, simultaneous sampling ADCs (multiplexer to over 30 channels), and interestingly, four matched, 8 MHz bandwidth op-amps with all pins exposed and additionally internal PGA (Programmable Gain Array) network. The exposed pads {{allow for a}} range of analogue signal conditioning circuits like band-pass filters, <b>anti-alias</b> filters, charge amplifiers, integrators/differentiators, 'instrumentation' high-gain differential inputs, and other. This eliminates need for external op-amps for many applications. The built-in two-channel DAC has arbitrary waveform as well as a hardware-generated waveform (sine, triangle, noise etc.) capability. All analogue devices can be completely independent, or partially internally connected, meaning that one can have nearly everything that is needed for an advanced measurement and sensor interfacing system in a single chip.|$|E
50|$|In realtime {{computer}} graphics, especially gaming, <b>anti-aliasing</b> is used {{to remove}} jaggies created by the edges of polygons and other lines entirely. Some video game consoles, such as the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, have publishing policies which mandated the use of <b>anti-aliasing</b> in some games released for them. Some computer graphics on newer video games are not <b>anti-aliased</b> on video game consoles (Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3), because their hardware can not run graphics smoothly (30 frames per second) if they are <b>anti-aliased.</b> On eighth generation video game consoles, such as the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, <b>anti-aliasing</b> and frame rate has been heavily improved. Jaggies in bitmaps, such as sprites and surface materials, are most often dealt with by separate texture filtering routines, which are far easier to perform than <b>anti-aliasing</b> filtering. Texture filtering became ubiquitous on PCs after the introduction of 3Dfx's Voodoo GPU.|$|R

50|$|To perform <b>anti-aliasing</b> in {{computer}} graphics, the <b>anti-aliasing</b> system requires a key piece of information: which objects cover specific pixels {{at any given}} time in the animation.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{computational}} {{advantages of}} the Bellman pseudospectral method {{is that it allows}} one to escape Gaussian rules in the distribution of node points. That is, in a standard pseudospectral method, the distribution of node points are Gaussian (typically Gauss-Lobatto for finite horizon and Gauss-Radau for infinite horizon). The Gaussian points are sparse {{in the middle of the}} interval (middle is defined in a shifted sense for infinite-horizon problems) and dense at the boundaries. The second-order accumulation of points near the boundaries have the effect of wasting nodes. The Bellman pseudospectral method takes advantage of the node accumulation at the initial point to <b>anti-alias</b> the solution and discards the remainder of the nodes. Thus the final distribution of nodes is non-Gaussian and dense while the computational method retains a sparse structure.|$|E
50|$|Anti-aliasing {{capabilities}} are more robust on R600 {{than on the}} R520 series. In addition {{to the ability to}} perform 8× MSAA, up from 6× MSAA on the R300 through R580, R600 has a new custom filter anti-aliasing (CFAA) mode. CFAA refers to an implementation of non-box filters that look at pixels around the particular pixel being processed in order to calculate the final color and <b>anti-alias</b> the image. CFAA is performed by shader, instead of in the ROPs. This brings greatly enhanced programmability because the filters can be customized, but may also bring potential performance issues because of the use of shader resources. As of launch of R600, CFAA utilizes wide and narrow tent filters. With these, samples from outside the pixel being processed are weighted linearly based upon their distance from the centroid of that pixel, with the linear function adjusted based on the wide or narrow filter chosen.|$|E
5000|$|The {{multiscale}} {{version of}} the Bellman pseudospectral method {{is based on the}} spectral convergence property of the Ross-Fahroo pseudospectral methods. That is, because the Ross-Fahroo pseudospectral method converges at an exponentially fast rate, pointwise convergence to a solution is obtained at very low number of nodes even when the solution has high-frequency components. This aliasing phenomenon in optimal control was first discovered by Ross et al. [...] Rather than use signal processing techniques to <b>anti-alias</b> the solution, Ross et al. proposed that Bellman's principle of optimality {{can be applied to the}} converged solution to extract information between the nodes. Because the Gauss-Lobatto nodes cluser at the boundary points, Ross et al. suggested that if the node density around the initial conditions satisfy the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, then the complete solution can be recovered by solving the optimal control problem in a recursive fashion over piecewise segments known as Bellman segments.|$|E
40|$|We {{develop an}} <b>anti-aliasing</b> filter for reverse-time {{migration}} (RTM).

Instead of applying this filter to the data in the traditional RTM operation, we apply the <b>anti-aliasing</b> filter to the generalized diffraction-stack migration operator.

5000|$|ATI {{revealed}} Temporal <b>Anti-Aliasing,</b> a new <b>anti-aliasing</b> technology their chips {{were capable}} of. By {{taking advantage of}} the frame-to-eye effects of a framerate higher than 60 frame/s, the GPU is able to better smooth aliased edges by rotating the <b>anti-aliasing</b> sampling pattern between frames. A 2X software setting became perceptively equivalent to 4X. Unfortunately, it required the system to be able to maintain at least 60 frame/s or temporal <b>anti-aliasing</b> would cause a noticeable flickering, because the user would {{be able to see the}} alternating AA patterns. If the framerate could not be maintained, the driver will disable Temporal AA. However, in games which this performance level could be maintained, Temporal AA was a nice addition to ATI's excellent <b>anti-aliasing</b> options. Note, ATI's [...] "Temporal AA" [...] was actually a temporal dithering filter for spatial AA, not de facto temporal <b>anti-aliasing</b> (which must involve a controlled blending of the temporal subsamples from consecutive screens).|$|R
50|$|It is very {{important}} to avoid input signal overload when using an <b>anti-aliasing</b> filter. If the signal is strong enough, it can cause clipping at the analog-to-digital converter, even after filtering. When distortion due to clipping occurs after the <b>anti-aliasing</b> filter, it can create components outside the passband of the <b>anti-aliasing</b> filter; these components can then alias, causing the reproduction of other non-harmonically-related frequencies.|$|R
50|$|Some {{cameras and}} {{broadcast}} systems that use 1080 vertical lines per frame do not actually use the full 1920 pixels of a nominal 1080i picture for image capture and encoding. Common subsampling ratios include 3/4 (resulting in 1440x1080i frame resolution) and 1/2 (resulting in 960x1080i frame resolution). Where used, the lower horizontal resolution is scaled to capture and/or display a full-sized picture. Using half horizontal resolution {{and only one}} field of each frame (possibly with added <b>anti-alias</b> filtering or progressive capture) results in the format known as qHD, which has frame resolution 960x540 and 30 or 25 frames per second. Due to the chosen 16x16 pixel size for a compressed video packet known as a macroblock as used in ITU H.261 to H.264 video standards, a 1080 line video must be encoded as 1088 lines and cropped to 1080 by the de-compressor. The 720 line video format divides perfectly by 16 and therefore does not require any lines to be wasted.|$|E
50|$|Bilinear {{filtering}} {{is rather}} accurate until the scaling of the texture gets below half or above double the original {{size of the}} texture - that is, if the texture was 256 pixels in each direction, scaling it to below 128 or above 512 pixels can make the texture look bad, because of missing pixels or too much smoothness. Often, in gaming or other 3-D rendering applications, mipmapping is used to provide a scaled-down version of the texture for better performance; however, the transition between two differently-sized mipmaps on a texture in perspective using bilinear filtering can be very abrupt. Trilinear filtering, though somewhat more complex, can make this transition smooth throughout. In the world of 2-D image resizing, bicubic interpolation is usually preferred for the illusion of sharpness that it creates and for its superior anti-aliasing properties; however, most bicubics achieve this {{through a combination of}} blurring and ringing artifacts. A Hermite filter, which is the only cubic that adds neither blurring nor ringing, does not <b>anti-alias</b> any better than linear interpolation does, but it is still somewhat sharper.|$|E
