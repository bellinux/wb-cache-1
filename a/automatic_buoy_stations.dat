25|$|In July 1946, the Bureau of Ships became {{involved}} in a program to develop <b>automatic</b> weather <b>station</b> <b>buoys.</b> As a perspective part of this program, they conducted a preliminary investigation into the feasibility of mooring a buoy. The investigation concluded that the buoy's hull size was of insufficient length to be moored in 3600 ft of water. To support such a mooring, a similar shaped hull had to be 20 ft (6 m) long and displace approximately 20,000 lb. This was to become the prototype of the buoy {{now known as the}} NOMAD.|$|R

The horizontal distribution of observedwater temperature at the thermocline depth fluctuates largely day by day. This fluctuation seemsto be caused by the rotating internal wave, which has been pointed out by Kanari. At the fixed <b>buoy</b> <b>station,</b> Ie- 1, time series of current and water temperature were obtained. Results show that the internal wave with the period of about 40 hours has been dominant in thefluctuations of both current and water temperature. An elliptical hodograph of this wave hasbeen obtained and this means the Coriolis' force plays {{a very important role}} to the internal waveof the fundamental mode.

The significant wave height by the SWAN model at Bangkhuntien shoreline from 1981 - 2004 were simulated. Results: The simulated {{results show that the}} maximum significant wave height at Bangkhuntien shoreline was in a range of 0. 95 - 2. 05 m while the average maximum significant wave height was 1. 47 m. The average significant wave height were in a range of 0. 29 - 0. 48 m while the average significant wave height of 21 years simulated data at Bangkhuntien shoreline was 0. 35 m.

40|$|Marine fouling on two {{offshore}} installations, one a <b>buoy</b> investigation <b>station</b> and {{the other}} a fixed oil platform, in the northern Beibu Gulf of China was investigated. The fouling communities were primarily composed of tropical and subtropical littoral species, such as algae, hydroids, anemones, bryozoans, acorn barnacles and bivalves. Oysters became the numerically dominant species of the fouling community in time. On the submerged part of the platform, the fouling community was mostly dominated by oysters and acorn barnacles. Of stalked barnacles, only Lepas anatifera and L. anserifra were found in low abundance at the <b>buoy</b> <b>station.</b> The source of fouling organisms and the influence of environmental factors contributing to the distribution of sessile species are also discussed.

Prevailing {{trade winds}} {{are a major}} {{component}} of the atmospheric circulation over the tropical Pacific and have significant influence on the climate in Hawaii. In order to determine if the frequency and intensity of the northeast trades have changed from 1984 - 2009, wind observation data from land and <b>buoy</b> <b>stations</b> around the Hawaiian Islands are analyzed. Using a nonparametric trend analysis, all stations are consistent in displaying a downward trend in northeast trade wind frequency, although the slope of the trend is variable for each station. On the contrary, the frequency of the east trade winds is shown to have increased over the past 26 years. After extending the period of study from 1973 - 2009, {{it was found that the}} northeast (east) trade frequency show decreasing (increasing) trends, similar to previous results found from the post 1984 - 2009 data set. When examining the trends for trade intensity, there is a discrepancy between the land and <b>buoy</b> <b>stations.</b> In order to relate station observation results to synoptic scale changes, Reanalysis II data are used to analyze surface winds and sea level pressure (SLP) over the central and eastern north Pacific. An east-northeast shifting of winds and an increase in SLP is found to occur from the 1980 s epoch to the 2000 s epoch. The analysis of land station surface pressure confirms the increase in SLP in the reanalysis data set...|$|R

40|$|Along the United States Gulf {{coast and}} over the {{northern}} Gulf of Mexico, frontal overrunning occurs frequently. Cyclogenesis over the Gulf {{is often associated with}} this type of weather system. Effects of baroclinic fields on frontal overrunning are investigated from synoptic and climatological points of view. It is found that, from October through April, the orientation of the shelf break is a very important baroclinic characteristic because fronts tend to stall there rather than at the physical coastline. To further substantiate this deduction dynamically, the local geostrophic vorticity field over the western Louisiana-upper Texas shelf region is estimated monthly. The correlation coefficient between the vorticity field and the frequency of frontal overrunning along the central Gulf coast was 0. 86. For forecasting applications, a simple formula is provided to estimate this local vorticity from the temperature difference between Lake Charles, Louisiana, and <b>buoy</b> <b>station</b> 42002 in the deep Gulf...|$|R
