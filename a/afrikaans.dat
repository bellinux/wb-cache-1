5|$|Reitz was an {{important}} figure in Afrikaner cultural life. He was a poet, and published many poems in <b>Afrikaans,</b> making him a progenitor {{of the development of}} <b>Afrikaans</b> as a cultural language. As such he sympathised with the Genootskap van Regte Afrikaners (Society of Real Afrikaners), established in the Cape Colony in 1875. Although he never became a member himself, he was an active contributor to the society's journal, Die Suid-Afrikaansche Patriot. With his literary work, Reitz was solidly anchored in the so-called First <b>Afrikaans</b> Language Movement, although he was less interested in the didactic drive of that movement than in writing in <b>Afrikaans</b> as a purely cultural activity. Much of his work was based on English texts, which he translated, edited, and adapted. In the process he produced completely new works of art.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Adolph Sonnabend (born 6 January 1933) is an <b>Afrikaans</b> physician, {{scientist}} and HIV/AIDS researcher, notable for pioneering community-based research, {{the propagation of}} safe sex to prevent infection, and an early multifactorial model of AIDS.|$|E
5|$|Hull {{attempted}} {{to join the}} South African Air Force in 1935, but was turned down {{because he did not}} speak <b>Afrikaans.</b> He joined the Royal Air Force (RAF) instead, enlisting in England in September 1935. Completing the pilot's course on 3 August 1936 with the rank of pilot officer, he joined No. 43 Squadron at RAF Tangmere in Sussex five days later.|$|E
5|$|In 1995 ANC {{politician}} Zola Skweyiya {{was accused}} of Boerehaat by Die Burger for disrespecting the <b>Afrikaans</b> official language in Parliament. In 1998 Jaap Marais, Afrikaner nationalist leader of the right-wing Herstigte Nasionale Party, described the post-apartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission as an exercise in Boerehaat.|$|E
5|$|Sirenia, {{commonly}} sirenians, {{are also}} referred to by the common name sirens, deriving from the sirens of Greek mythology. This comes from a legend about their discovery, involving lonely sailors mistaking them for mermaids. Seekoei (sea cow) is also the name for a hippopotamus in <b>Afrikaans.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{area was}} {{uninhabited}} by Europeans until after World War II, when a severe drought caused white <b>Afrikaans</b> speaking farmers (Boers) to move in. The farm was later procured by the apartheid government {{as part of}} the Odendaal Plan and became part of the Damaraland bantustan. The white settlers left in 1965.|$|E
5|$|With {{the rise}} of Afrikaner {{nationalism}} in South Africa during {{the early part of}} the 20th century, Scouting was viewed with suspicion by many Afrikaners because of its English roots, and rival <b>Afrikaans</b> organisations including the Voortrekkers were established. These had a strong social and political aim. Negotiations about an amalgamation of both movements in the years 1930 to 1936 were not successful.|$|E
5|$|For Reitz, <b>Afrikaans</b> was {{predominantly}} {{a language}} of culture, not of government, where he propagated {{the use of the}} official language of the Boer republics, Dutch. During his presidency of the Orange Free State, where the use of English was significant among the burghers, he strongly promoted the use of Dutch, against politicians like John G. Fraser and others who were in favour of English.|$|E
5|$|German is the {{official}} and predominant spoken language in Germany. Standard German is a West Germanic language and {{is closely related to}} and classified alongside Low German, Dutch, <b>Afrikaans,</b> Frisian and English. To a lesser extent, it is also related to the North Germanic languages. Most German vocabulary is derived from the Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family. Significant minorities of words are derived from Latin and Greek, with a smaller amount from French and most recently English (known as Denglisch). German is written using the Latin alphabet.|$|E
5|$|In earlier times, when large {{populations of}} {{springbok}} roamed the Kalahari desert and Karoo, millions of migrating springbok formed herds hundreds of kilometres long {{that could take}} several days to pass a town. These mass treks, known as trekbokken in <b>Afrikaans,</b> took place during long periods of drought. Herds could efficiently retrace their paths to their territories after long migrations. Trekbokken is still observed occasionally in Botswana, though on a much smaller scale than earlier.|$|E
5|$|The {{series has}} been {{translated}} into 67 languages, placing Rowling among the most translated authors in history. The books have seen translations to diverse languages such as Korean, Armenian, Ukrainian, Arabic, Urdu, Hindi, Bengali, Bulgarian, Welsh, <b>Afrikaans,</b> Albanian, Latvian and Vietnamese. The first volume has {{been translated into}} Latin and even Ancient Greek, making it the longest published work in Ancient Greek since the novels of Heliodorus of Emesa in the 3rd century AD. The second volume has also been translated into Latin.|$|E
5|$|White South African {{critics of}} apartheid, such as liberal {{politician}} Alex Boraine and Afrikaner anti-apartheid activist Beyers Naudé, were labelled unpatriotic Boerehaters by Nationalists and the <b>Afrikaans</b> press {{in an attempt}} to discredit them. White dissidents were also associated with the rooi gevaar ("communist threat"). South African poet and writer Guy Butler was called a Boerehater by Afrikaners for his promotion of English-language literature and his opposition to Afrikaner nationalism and the National Party.|$|E
5|$|Back {{home she}} resumes {{her job as}} a {{physiotherapist}} in Soweto. Then in June 1976 Soweto school children start protesting about their inferior education and being taught in <b>Afrikaans.</b> They go on a rampage, which includes killing white welfare workers. The police brutally put down the uprising, resulting in hundreds of deaths. In October 1977, many organisations and people critical of the white government are banned, and in November 1977 Rosa Burger is detained. Her lawyer, who also represented her father, expects charges to be brought against her of furthering the aims of the banned SACP and African National Congress (ANC), and of aiding and abetting the students' revolt.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Biko had {{enrolled}} for a {{law degree}} by correspondence from the University of South Africa. He passed several exams, but had not completed the degree at his time of death. His performance on the course was poor; he was absent from several exams and failed his Practical <b>Afrikaans</b> module. The state security services repeatedly sought to intimidate him; he received anonymous threatening phone calls, and gun shots were fired at his house. A {{group of young men}} calling themselves 'The Cubans' began guarding him from these attacks. The security services detained him four times, once for 101 days. With the ban preventing him from gaining employment, the strained economic situation impacted his marriage.|$|E
5|$|The Tale of The Flopsy Bunnies was {{published}} in French as La Famille Flopsaut in 1931, in <b>Afrikaans</b> as Die Varhall van Die Flopsie-Familie in 1935, in Dutch as Die Kleine Langoortjes in 1946 and again in Dutch as Het Verhaal van De Woolepluis-Konijntjes in 1969, in German as Die Geschichte Der Hasenfamilie Plumps in 1947, and in Japanese in 1971 under license to Fukuinkan-Shoten, Tokyo. The tale {{was published}} in the Initial Teaching Alphabet in 1965. In 1986, MacDonald observed that the Potter books had become a traditional part of childhood in both English-speaking lands and those in which the books had been translated.|$|E
5|$|Bantu Stephen Biko {{was born}} on 18 December 1946, at his grandmother's house in Tarkastad, Eastern Cape. The third child of Mzingaye Mathew Biko and Alice 'Mamcete' Biko, he had an older sister, Bukelwa, an older brother, Khaya, and a younger sister, Nobandile. His parents had married in Whittlesea, where his father worked as a police officer. Mzingaye was {{transferred}} to Queenstown, Port Elizabeth, Fort Cox, and finally King William's Town, where he and Alice settled in Ginsberg township. This was a settlement of around 800 families, with every four families sharing a water supply and toilet. Both Bantu African and Coloured people lived in the township, where Xhosa, <b>Afrikaans,</b> and English were all spoken. After resigning from the police force, Mzingaye worked as a clerk in the King William's Town Native Affairs Office, while studying for a law degree by correspondence from the University of South Africa. Alice was employed first in domestic work for local white households, then as a cook at Grey Hospital in King William's Town. According to his sister, it was this observation of his mother's difficult working conditions that resulted in Biko's earliest politicisation.|$|E
5|$|In Johannesburg in the 1950s, {{crime was}} a day-to-day reality, and Sophiatown was {{the nucleus of}} all reef crimes. Gangsters were city-bred and spoke a mixture of <b>Afrikaans</b> and English, known as tsotsitaal. Some of the more {{well-known}} gangs in Sophiatown were the Russians, the Americans, the Gestapo, the Berliners and the Vultures. The names the Gestapo and the Berliners reflect their admiration for Hitler, whom they saw {{as some kind of}} hero, for taking on the whites of Europe. The best known gang from this period, and also best studied, was the Russians. They were a group of Basotho migrant workers who banded together {{in the absence of any}} effective law enforcement by either mine owners or the state. The primary goal of this gang was to protect members from the tsotsis and from other gangs of migrant workers, and to acquire and defend resources they found desirable - most notably women, jobs and the urban space necessary for the parties and staged fights that formed the bulk of their weekend entertainment.|$|E
5|$|Though {{attending}} Christian Sunday services, Mandela studied Islam. He {{also studied}} <b>Afrikaans,</b> hoping {{to build a}} mutual respect with the warders and convert them to his cause. Various official visitors met with Mandela, most significantly the liberal parliamentary representative Helen Suzman of the Progressive Party, who championed Mandela's cause outside of prison. In September 1970, he met British Labour Party politician Dennis Healey. South African Minister of Justice Jimmy Kruger visited in December 1974, but he and Mandela did not get along with each other. His mother visited in 1968, dying shortly after, and his firstborn son Thembi {{died in a car}} accident the following year; Mandela was forbidden from attending either funeral. His wife was rarely able to see him, being regularly imprisoned for political activity, and his daughters first visited in December 1975. Winnie was released from prison in 1977 but was forcibly settled in Brandfort and remained unable to see him.|$|E
5|$|A study {{undertaken}} between 1999 and 2001 in New Zealand by lexicographers Laurie and Winifred Bauer {{on traditional}} forms of play included truce terms. The terms they described in their study were regional and the most common were pegs (widespread), twigs (Taranaki), gates (Auckland), tags (Nelson Marlborough), and nibs (Otago-Southland). In Wellington schools the dominant term was fans, recorded in New Zealand before 1920, which the authors state derives from fains or fain it as described by the Opies, itself dating back to Chaucerian times. The most widespread term was pegs, derived from pax. Apparently unrecorded before World War II this appears to have first changed to pags, probably from being shouted out at length, and then further mutated by virtue of broad New Zealand accents to pegs. The Bauers thought the most likely hypothesis {{for the use of}} this rather upper class term from the UK, was that it derived from books and stories about UK public schools. Similarly they thought nibs derived from nix, possibly via nigs, originally from South Africa though unknown to the Opies save for a very small area of nicks possibly from nicklas. Nix is also UK public school slang though not as a truce term. Nixs and flix were recorded as having been described by a South African boy as prevalent in South Africa, and were thought by a South African linguist to have derived from an <b>Afrikaans</b> term.|$|E
5|$|Before the mid-1870s, the {{judicial}} system of the Orange Free State was rather amateurish and haphazard in character, particularly {{because most of the}} judges were legally unqualified. Most of {{the judicial}} procedures were in the hands of district magistrates, the so-called Landdrosts, whose main task was administrative. Reitz's first task was to ameliorate this situation, which he did with much vigour. Well within his first year of tenure the Volksraad passed an Ordinance, in which both a professional Circuit Court and a Supreme Court were called into being. Reitz became the first president of the Supreme Court and consequently also the first Chief Justice of the Orange Free State. Right from the beginning Reitz showed himself to be a fighter, opposing the Volksraad on more than one occasion, tackling deeply ingrained political traditions that stood {{in the way of the}} modernisation of {{the judicial system}}, but also fighting hard to get the salaries and pensions of state officials improved. As a colonial – he was born in the Cape Colony after all – he had to win the confidence of the Boer population to have his ideas accepted. This he did by travelling with the Circuit Court through the country for over ten years, acquiring insight into and empathy for their way of life and their often conservative and always God-fearing beliefs. It helped that Reitz himself was a religious person and that he had started out in life in the <b>Afrikaans</b> speaking countryside of the Cape Colony. Eventually he became the symbol of Afrikanerdom for many Orange Free Staters.|$|E

25|$|<b>Afrikaans</b> is also widely {{spoken in}} Namibia. Before independence, <b>Afrikaans</b> had equal status with German as an {{official}} language. Since independence in 1990, <b>Afrikaans</b> has had constitutional recognition as a national, but not official, language. There is a much smaller number of <b>Afrikaans</b> speakers among Zimbabwe's white minority, as most have left the country since 1980. <b>Afrikaans</b> was also a medium of instruction for schools in Bophuthatswana, an Apartheid-era Bantustan.|$|E
25|$|Modern Dutch and <b>Afrikaans</b> share over 90 {{percent of}} their vocabulary. <b>Afrikaans</b> {{speakers}} are able to learn Dutch within a comparatively short time. Native Dutch speakers pick up written <b>Afrikaans</b> even more quickly, due to its simplified grammar, whereas understanding spoken <b>Afrikaans</b> might need more effort. <b>Afrikaans</b> speakers can learn Dutch pronunciation with little training. This has enabled Dutch and Belgian companies to outsource their call centre operations to South Africa.|$|E
25|$|<b>Afrikaans</b> {{acquired}} some lexical and syntactical borrowings {{from other}} languages such as Malay, Khoisan languages, Portuguese, {{and of the}} Bantu languages, and <b>Afrikaans</b> has also been significantly influenced by South African English. Dutch speakers are confronted with fewer non-cognates when listening to <b>Afrikaans</b> {{than the other way}} round. Mutual intelligibility thus tends to be asymmetrical, as it is easier for Dutch speakers to understand <b>Afrikaans</b> than for <b>Afrikaans</b> speakers to understand Dutch.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>Afrikaans</b> {{has adopted}} words from other languages, {{including}} Portuguese, the Bantu languages, Malay, German and the Khoisan languages, an estimated 90 to 95% of {{the vocabulary of}} <b>Afrikaans</b> is of Dutch origin. Therefore, differences with Dutch often lie in the more analytic morphology and grammar of <b>Afrikaans,</b> and a spelling that expresses <b>Afrikaans</b> pronunciation rather than standard Dutch. There is a large degree of mutual intelligibility between the two languages—especially in written form.|$|E
25|$|Beginning {{in about}} 1815, <b>Afrikaans</b> started to replace Malay as the {{language}} of instruction in Muslim schools in South Africa, written with the Arabic alphabet: see Arabic <b>Afrikaans.</b> Later, <b>Afrikaans,</b> now written with the Latin script, started to appear in newspapers and political and religious works in around 1850.|$|E
25|$|The Black community's {{opposition}} to <b>Afrikaans</b> and preference for continuing English instruction was underlined {{when the government}} rescinded the policy {{one month after the}} uprising: 96% of Black schools chose English (over <b>Afrikaans</b> or native languages) as the language of instruction. Also, due to <b>Afrikaans</b> being viewed as the language of the white oppressor by some, pressure has been increased to remove <b>Afrikaans</b> as a teaching language in South African universities, resulting in bloody student protests in 2015.|$|E
25|$|A {{handful of}} <b>Afrikaans</b> words {{are exactly the}} same as in English. The {{following}} <b>Afrikaans</b> sentences, for example, {{are exactly the same}} in the two languages, in terms of both their meaning and spelling; only their pronunciation differs.|$|E
25|$|Post-apartheid South Africa {{has seen}} a loss of {{preferential}} treatment by the government for <b>Afrikaans,</b> in terms of education, social events, media (TV and radio), and general status throughout the country, given that it now shares its place as official language with ten other languages. Nevertheless, <b>Afrikaans</b> remains more prevalent in the media – radio, newspapers and television – {{than any of the}} other official languages, except English. More than 300 book titles in <b>Afrikaans</b> are published annually. South African census figures suggest a growing number of speakers in all nine provinces, a total of 6.85 million in 2011 compared to 5.98 million a decade earlier. The South African Institute of Race Relations (SAIRR) project that a growing majority will be Coloured <b>Afrikaans</b> speakers. <b>Afrikaans</b> speakers experience higher employment rates than other South African language groups, though half a million remain unemployed.|$|E
25|$|Today, the university's Language Policy {{promotes}} multilingualism as a {{means to}} increase equitable access for all students and staff. <b>Afrikaans,</b> English and isiXhosa are used in academic, administrative, professional and social contexts, and classes are offered in <b>Afrikaans</b> and English.|$|E
25|$|The South African {{version of}} the medal was unique since the {{inscriptions}} on the scroll bar and the reverse of the medal were bilingual, in English and <b>Afrikaans</b> on the scroll bar and in <b>Afrikaans</b> and English on the medal's reverse.|$|E
25|$|Both {{languages}} are still largely mutually intelligible, although this relation can in some fields (such as lexicon, spelling and grammar) be asymmetric, {{as it is}} easier for Dutch speakers to understand written <b>Afrikaans</b> than it is for <b>Afrikaans</b> speakers to understand written Dutch. <b>Afrikaans</b> is grammatically far less complex than Dutch, and vocabulary items are generally altered in a clearly patterned manner, e.g. vogel becomes voël ("bird") and regen becomes reën ("rain"). In South Africa, the number of students following Dutch at university is difficult to estimate, since the academic study of <b>Afrikaans</b> inevitably includes the study of Dutch. Elsewhere in the world, the number of people learning Dutch is relatively small.|$|E
25|$|Black South African {{high school}} {{students}} in Soweto protested against the <b>Afrikaans</b> Medium Decree of 1974, which forced all black schools to use <b>Afrikaans</b> and English in a 50–50 mix as languages of instruction. The Regional Director of Bantu Education (Northern Transvaal Region), J.G. Erasmus, told Circuit Inspectors and Principals of Schools that from 1 January 1975, <b>Afrikaans</b> had to be used for mathematics, arithmetic, and social studies from standard five (7th grade), according to the <b>Afrikaans</b> Medium Decree; English would be the medium of instruction for general science and practical subjects (homecraft, needlework, woodwork, metalwork, art, agricultural science). Indigenous languages would only be used for religious instruction, music, and physical culture.|$|E
25|$|The {{association}} of <b>Afrikaans</b> with apartheid prompted black South Africans to prefer English. Even the Bantustan regimes chose English and an indigenous African language as official languages. In addition, English was gaining prominence as the language {{most often used}} in commerce and industry. The 1974 decree was intended to forcibly reverse the decline of <b>Afrikaans</b> among black Africans. The Afrikaner-dominated government used the clause of the 1909 Union of South Africa Act that recognised only English and Dutch (the latter being replaced by <b>Afrikaans</b> in 1925) as official languages as the pretext to do so. While all schools had to provide instruction in both <b>Afrikaans</b> and English as languages, white South African students learned other subjects in their home language.|$|E
25|$|In the 21st century, Coloured people {{constitute}} {{a plurality of}} the population in the provinces of Western Cape (48.8%), and a large minority in the Northern Cape (40.3%), both areas of centuries of mixing between the populations. In the Eastern Cape they make up 8.3% of the population. Most speak <b>Afrikaans,</b> as they were descendants of Dutch and Afrikaner men and grew up in their society. About twenty percent of Coloureds speak English as their mother tongue, mostly those of the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal. Virtually all Cape Town Coloureds are bilingual. Some can comfortably codeswitch between Kaapse taal (a creolized dialect of <b>Afrikaans</b> spoken mostly in the Cape Flats) and suiwer <b>Afrikaans</b> (formal <b>Afrikaans</b> as used in schools and media), and South African English.|$|E
25|$|<b>Afrikaans</b> {{belongs to}} its own West Germanic sub-group, the Low Franconian languages. Its closest {{relative}} is the mutually-intelligible mother language, Dutch language. Other West Germanic languages related to <b>Afrikaans</b> are German, English and the Frisian languages and the unstandardised languages Low German and Yiddish.|$|E
