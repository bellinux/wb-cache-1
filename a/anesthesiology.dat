5|$|Gábor Béla Rácz (born 1937), is a board-certified {{anesthesiologist}} {{and professor}} emeritus at Texas Tech University Health Science Center (TTUHSC) in Lubbock, Texas, where he is also Chairman Emeritus of the Department of <b>Anesthesiology</b> and Co-Director of Pain Services. He {{has worked in the}} field of chronic back pain and complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS).|$|E
5|$|In 1963, Racz {{moved to}} the United States for an <b>anesthesiology</b> {{residency}} at SUNY Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, New York. Upon completion, he worked in several positions at SUNY, including associate attending anesthesiologist and respiratory consultant in the neurological head injury unit {{as well as a}} consultant for the Veterans Administration Hospital, and the UHS Chenango Memorial Hospital in Norwich, New York.|$|E
5|$|Racz {{was born}} in Hungary and, as a young man, had {{aspirations}} to become a medical doctor. He was a second-year medical student in November 1956 when {{he was forced to}} flee Hungary after the Soviets invaded Budapest in response to the Hungarian Revolution. He eventually arrived in England and resumed his education. He graduated from the University of Liverpool School of Medicine, and worked in the UK until 1963 at which time he moved to the United States. He completed his <b>anesthesiology</b> residency at SUNY Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, New York. He also worked as an associate attending anesthesiologist and respiratory consultant for other hospitals including the Veterans Administration Hospital, and the UHS Chenango Memorial Hospital in Norwich, New York before moving to Lubbock, Texas where he became the first Chairman of <b>Anesthesiology</b> for the then-new Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center (TTUHSC). Racz {{is also one of the}} founders of the World Institute of Pain.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, Racz {{joined the}} then-new Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center (TTUHSC) and was {{designated}} as the Center's first Chairman of <b>Anesthesiology.</b> He held that position until March 1, 1999. His work from 1977 to 2006 not only included treating patients, he also served as acting director of pain services at TTUHSC, and oversaw the expansion of operations and future development of the Messer-Racz International Pain Center named in recognition of Racz's work and the Messer family's financial contributions. In 2015, Racz held the designation of Professor and Chairman Emeritus, Director of Pain Services for Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center.|$|E
5|$|For centuries, {{tracheotomy}} {{was considered}} the only reliable method for intubation of the trachea. However, because {{only a minority of}} patients survived the operation, physicians undertook tracheotomy only as a last resort, on patients who were nearly dead. It was not until the late 19th century however that advances in understanding of anatomy and physiology, as well an appreciation of the germ theory of disease, had improved the outcome of this operation {{to the point that it}} could be considered an acceptable treatment option. Also at that time, advances in endoscopic instrumentation had improved to such a degree that direct laryngoscopy had become a viable means to secure the airway by the non-surgical orotracheal route. By the mid-20th century, the tracheotomy as well as endoscopy and non-surgical tracheal intubation had evolved from rarely employed procedures to becoming essential components of the practices of <b>anesthesiology,</b> critical care medicine, emergency medicine, and laryngology.|$|E
25|$|<b>Anesthesiology</b> {{residency}} {{training in}} the U.S. encompasses the full scope of perioperative medicine, including pre-operative medical evaluation, management of pre-existing disease in the surgical patient, intraoperative life support, intraoperative pain control, post-operative recovery, intensive care medicine, and chronic and acute pain management. After residency, many anesthesiologists complete an additional fellowship year of sub-specialty training {{in areas such as}} pain management, sleep medicine, cardiothoracic <b>anesthesiology,</b> pediatric <b>anesthesiology,</b> neuroanesthesiology, regional anesthesiology/ambulatory <b>anesthesiology,</b> obstetric <b>anesthesiology,</b> or critical care medicine.|$|E
25|$|In Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, anesthesiologists' {{training}} is supervised by the respective national societies of <b>anesthesiology</b> {{as well as}} the Scandinavian Society of <b>Anesthesiology</b> and Intensive Care Medicine (SSAI). In Scandinavia, <b>anesthesiology</b> is the medical specialty that is engaged in the fields of anesthesia, intensive care medicine, pain control medicine, pre-hospital and in-hospital emergency medicine. Anesthesiologist in the Scandinavian countries is a doctor who has completed a six-year undergraduate training program (from medical school), a twelve-month internship, and a five-year residency program. SSAI currently hosts five training programs for anesthesiologists in Scandinavia. These are Intensive care, Pediatric <b>anesthesiology</b> and intensive care, Advanced pain medicine, Critical care medicine, and Advanced obstetric <b>anesthesiology.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{university}} has good {{a reputation for}} its <b>anesthesiology</b> education {{as one of the}} medical colleges to establish independent department of <b>anesthesiology</b> first in 1987.|$|E
25|$|Cardiothoracic <b>anesthesiology</b> is a subspeciality of {{the medical}} {{practice}} of <b>anesthesiology</b> devoted to the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative care of adult and pediatric patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery and related invasive procedures.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, anesthesiologists are {{physicians}} (MD or DO) {{who have}} chosen to specialize in <b>anesthesiology</b> and are extensively trained medical care providers in the United States. Anesthesiologists in the United States must have completed an undergraduate college program (that includes pre-medical requirements) and four years of medical school training. <b>Anesthesiology</b> residency programs in the United States require successful completion of four years of residency training for board certification eligibility in the specialty of <b>anesthesiology.</b> An <b>anesthesiology</b> residency requires a one-year medicine or surgery internship followed by three years of <b>anesthesiology</b> training. <b>Anesthesiology</b> residents face multiple examinations during their residency, including exams encompassing physiology, pathophysiology, pharmacology, and other medical sciences addressed in medical school, along with multiple anesthesia knowledge tests which assess progress during residency. Successful completion of a board exam after completion of residency is required for board certification. The average salary for a full-time anesthesiologists is roughly $258,100, according to US News. The number of jobs are rounding to about 170,400 according to statistics in 2014.|$|E
25|$|<b>Anesthesiology</b> (also {{known as}} anaesthetics): {{concerned}} with the perioperative management of the surgical patient. The anesthesiologist's role during surgery is to prevent derangement in the vital organs' (i.e. brain, heart, kidneys) functions and postoperative pain. Outside of the operating room, the <b>anesthesiology</b> physician also serves the same function in the labor & delivery ward, and some are specialized in critical medicine.|$|E
25|$|Post-doctoral {{fellowship}} {{courses in}} Neuro-radiology, Neuro or Cardiac <b>anesthesiology,</b> etc. are offered by select institutions.|$|E

UAB Hospital sponsors residency programs in medical specialties, including internal medicine, neurology, surgery, radiology, and <b>anesthesiology.</b> UAB Hospital is the only ACS verified Level I trauma center in Alabama, as rated by the American College of Surgeons Trauma Program.|$|E
25|$|The complex {{nature of}} cardiothoracic surgery necessitates extra {{training}} {{to acquire the}} skills needed to be a cardiothoracic <b>anesthesiology</b> consultant. Fellows are trained to achieve expertise in the advanced monitoring techniques including invasive blood pressure, arterial blood gas analysis, cardiac output monitoring, jugular venous oxygen saturation, cerebral oximetry, Bispectral Index (BIS), Transcranial doppler (TCD), and Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).|$|E

25|$|Finally, {{invasive}} procedures {{completed by}} the cardiothoracic <b>anesthesiology</b> fellows include {{but are not limited}} to arterial line placement (femoral, axillary, brachial, radial), central venous cannulation (internal juggular, femoral, subclavian), pulmonary artery catheter placement, transvenous pacemaker placement, thoracic epidural analgesia, fiberoptic endotracheal tube placement, 2D/3D transesophageal echocardiography, intraspinal drainage placement, and advanced ultrasound guidance of vascular access.|$|E
25|$|Clearly, SA has far {{reaching}} applications, as it {{is necessary}} for individuals and teams to function effectively in their environment. Thus, we are beginning to see SA going beyond the field of aviation to work being conducted {{in a wide variety of}} environments. Currently, SA is being studied in such diverse areas as air traffic control, nuclear power plant operation, vehicle operation, and <b>anesthesiology.</b>|$|E
25|$|Neurology, psychiatry, neurosurgery, psychosurgery, <b>anesthesiology</b> {{and pain}} medicine, neuropathology, neuroradiology, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, {{clinical}} neurophysiology, addiction medicine, and sleep medicine are some medical specialties that specifically address the {{diseases of the}} nervous system. These terms also refer to clinical disciplines involving {{diagnosis and treatment of}} these diseases. Neurology works with diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and stroke, and their medical treatment. Psychiatry focuses on affective, behavioral, cognitive, and perceptual disorders. <b>Anesthesiology</b> focuses on perception of pain, and pharmacologic alteration of consciousness. Neuropathology focuses upon the classification and underlying pathogenic mechanisms of central and peripheral nervous system and muscle diseases, with an emphasis on morphologic, microscopic, and chemically observable alterations. Neurosurgery and psychosurgery work primarily with surgical treatment of diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems. The boundaries between these specialties have been blurring recently as they are all influenced by basic research in neuroscience. Brain imaging also enables objective, biological insights into mental illness, which can lead to faster diagnosis, more accurate prognosis, and help assess patient progress over time.|$|E
25|$|Patient-informed consent is {{a medical}} {{principle}} stating that patients should be fully informed about {{the manner in which}} anesthesia will be administered to them. It is a fundamental ethical and legal principle and is considered essential for the patient autonomy. The American Society of Anesthesiologists and the American Osteopathic Board of <b>Anesthesiology</b> support this principle. In Germany, the law requires that prior to anaesthesia, informed consent of the patient must be obtained by the anaesthetist.|$|E
25|$|Throughout history, {{the most}} {{important}} has been the division into surgical and internal medicine specialties. The surgical specialties are the specialties in which {{an important part of}} diagnosis and treatment is achieved through major surgical techniques. The internal medicine specialties are the specialties in which the main diagnosis and treatment is never major surgery. In some countries <b>Anesthesiology</b> is classified as a surgical discipline, since it is vital in the surgical process, though anesthesiologists never perform major surgery themselves.|$|E
25|$|Whereas {{medical school}} teaches {{physicians}} {{a broad range}} of medical knowledge, basic clinical skills, and supervised experience practicing medicine in a variety of fields, medical residency gives in-depth training within a specific branch of medicine. A physician may choose a residency in <b>anesthesiology,</b> ophthalmology, cardiothoracic surgery, dermatology, emergency medicine, family medicine, internal medicine, neurology, neurosurgery, obstetrics and gynecology, otolaryngology, pathology, pediatrics, plastic and reconstructive surgery, psychiatry, physical medicine and rehabilitation, radiology, radiation oncology, oral and maxillofacial surgery, general surgery, urology or other medical specialties.|$|E
25|$|The School of Medicine has {{departments}} in the following basic science subjects: Biochemistry and Biophysics, Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Cancer Biology, Cell and Developmental Biology, Genetics, Medical Ethics and Health Policy, Microbiology, Neuroscience, Pharmacology, and Physiology. The school also has {{departments in}} the following clinical practices: <b>Anesthesiology</b> and Critical Care, Dermatology, Emergency Medicine, Family Practice and Community Medicine, Medicine, Neurology, Neurosurgery, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ophthalmology (See Scheie Eye Institute), Orthopaedic Surgery, Otorhinolaryngology, Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Pediatrics (See Children's Hospital of Philadelphia), Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Psychiatry, Radiation Oncology, Radiology, and Surgery.|$|E
