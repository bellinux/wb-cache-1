5|$|After Nixon won re-election, {{inflation}} was returning. He reimposed price controls in June 1973. The price controls became unpopular {{with the public}} and businesspeople, who saw powerful labor unions as preferable to the price board bureaucracy. The controls produced food shortages, as meat disappeared from grocery stores <b>and</b> <b>farmers</b> drowned chickens rather than sell them at a loss. Despite the failure to control inflation, controls were slowly ended, and on April 30, 1974, their statutory authorization lapsed.|$|E
5|$|Gum-digging was {{the major}} source of income for {{settlers}} in Northland, <b>and</b> <b>farmers</b> often worked the gumfields in the winter months to subsidise the poor income from their unbroken land. By the 1890s, 20,000 people were engaged in gum-digging, of which 7000 worked full-time. Gum-digging was not restricted to settlers or workers in the rural areas; Auckland families would cross the Waitematā Harbour by ferry at weekends to dig in the fields around Birkenhead, causing damage to public roads and private farms, and leading to local council management of the problem.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, in {{response}} to disastrously low agricultural harvests, Malawi began a programme of fertiliser subsidies, the Fertiliser Input Subsidy Program (FISP) that were designed to re-energise the land and boost crop production. It {{has been reported that}} this program, championed by the country's president, is radically improving Malawi's agriculture, and causing Malawi to become a net exporter of food to nearby countries. The FISP fertiliser subsidy programs ended with President Bingu wa Mutharika's death; the country quickly faced food shortages again, <b>and</b> <b>farmers</b> developed reluctance to purchase fertilisers and other agricultural inputs on the open markets that remained.|$|E
5|$|John Boscawen of the Act Party {{commented that}} the NZ ETS was a grand experiment, without {{precedent}} in any other nation in the world.

Boscawen called for the NZ ETS to be scrapped or delayed indefinitely.|$|E

5|$|After the storm, {{members of}} Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni {{provided}} $2,500 {{to the town}} of Iwakuni toward cleanup and disaster relief. Soldiers also helped nearby residents <b>and</b> <b>farmers</b> to complete the rice harvest, after floods from the typhoon damaged harvesting machines. The local government of Iwakunda distributed disinfectant chemicals to flooded houses. Closed markets and decreased supplies caused the price of beef to reach record levels in the country. Following the storm, the General Insurance Association of Japan reported that insurance claims from the typhoon totaled ¥58.8billion (US$53million), the tenth-highest for any natural disaster in the country. Miyazaki Prefecture reported the highest claims with ¥12.6billion (US$11.4million). The total was split between ¥49billion (US$44million) in housing claims and ¥7.9billion (US$71million) in car claims. The Japanese government provided food, water, and rescue workers to the affected areas {{in the days after the}} storm, along with Japan Post, the local post system; trucks were mobilized to affected towns, accompanied by a mobile bank and insurance agent.|$|E
5|$|At {{the height}} of the revolt, Hananu {{effectively}} created a quasi-independent state between Aleppo and the Mediterranean Sea. Hananu's rebels first began administering captured territory in Armanaz, where the rebels coordinated with that town's municipality to impose taxes on landowners, livestock owners <b>and</b> <b>farmers</b> to fund their operations. From there, Hananu's administrative territory expanded to other towns and villages, including Kafr Takharim, and the district centers Harim, Jisr al-Shughur and Idlib. The municipal councils of these towns were not replaced, but repurposed to support the financial needs of the rebels and promote their social convictions. Kafr Takharim became the legislative center of rebel territory with a legislative committee in place to collect money and weapons from local sources, and a supreme revolutionary council to oversee judicial matters.|$|E

Opinion within the party was overwhelmingly in favor of renominating Blaine.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the earlier}} {{negative}} associations with oil among many ranchers <b>and</b> <b>farmers,</b> demand for kerosene and other petroleum derivatives drove oil prospecting in Texas after the American Civil War at known oil-producing springs and accidental finds while drilling for water. One {{of the first}} significant wells in Texas was developed {{near the town of}} Oil Springs, near Nacogdoches. The site began production in 1866. The first oilfield in Texas with a substantial economic impact was developed in 1894 near Corsicana. In 1898, the field built the state's first modern refinery. The success of the Corsicana field and increasing demand for oil worldwide led to more exploration around the state.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{their legal}} {{privileges}} over that of merchants, {{the work of}} artisans was considered by Han Confucian scholars to be of secondary importance to that of farmers. This is perhaps largely because scholars and officials could not survive without the farmer's product and taxes paid in grain. The government relied on taxed grain to fund its military campaigns and stored surplus grain to mitigate widespread famine during times of poor harvest. Despite the prominence given to farmers, Confucian scholars did accept that artisans performed a vital economic role. This view was only rejected by {{a small minority of}} Legalists, who advocated a society of only soldiers <b>and</b> <b>farmers,</b> and certain Daoists who wanted everyone to live in self-sufficient villages and without commercial interests.|$|E

5|$|In 1861, {{there were}} {{concerns}} that the old-style Poitevin was becoming extinct, and {{questions about whether the}} Poitou mule retained the quality that it previously had. The large Poitevin mares became rarer, due to large amounts of crossbreeding and a lack of care shown towards breeding stock selection. Thoroughbreds and Thoroughbred crosses, especially at the stud farms in Saint-Maixent and La Roche-sur-Yon, created the Anglo-Poitevin type, a half-blood used by the army. The continued draining of the marshes also influenced the breed. Many Poitevins at this point were actually a mix of Breton and old-type Poitevin bloodstock. However, a distinction persisted between the real Poitevin and mixed-blood horses, <b>and</b> <b>farmers</b> who preferred the former preserved the type, which formed the base for the creation of the breed studbook.|$|E
5|$|In 1920, Parkinson {{was part}} of the Fiji Expeditionary Force.

In 1925, he was sent to a gunnery course in England and, for the following two years, was seconded to the Royal Artillery. He returned to New Zealand in 1927, accompanied by his wife Barbara Waiohine Howe, who he had married in Birmingham on 30 August the previous year. A series of staff and instructional postings in Wellington, and then Auckland, followed. He was promoted to major in 1932.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of Wyoming most of the land was in public domain, which was open to stock raising as an open range and farmlands for homesteading. Large numbers of cattle were turned loose on the open range by large ranches. Each spring, round-ups were held to {{separate}} the cattle belonging to different ranches. Before a roundup, an orphan or stray calf was sometimes surreptitiously branded, which was the common way to identify the cow's owners. Lands and water rights were usually distributed to whoever settled the property first, <b>and</b> <b>farmers</b> and ranchers had to respect these boundaries (the doctrine was known as Prior Appropriation). However, as more and more homesteaders moved into Wyoming, competition for land and water soon enveloped the state, and the cattle companies reacted by monopolizing large areas of the open range to prevent newcomers from using it. They also forbade their employees from owning cattle for fear of additional competition, and threatened anyone they suspected to be rustlers.|$|E
