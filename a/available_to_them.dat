5|$|Starting {{from the}} second act, players can journey between field screen {{locations}} via the world map, a downsized representation of Final Fantasy VIIs world. Players can freely navigate the world map screen unless restricted by geographical obstacles, such as water or mountains. To overcome this, players can ride emu-like chocobos and various vehicles <b>available</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> though usage is limited. As in other Final Fantasy-related games, travel across the world map screen and hostile areas is frequently interrupted by random enemy encounters.|$|E

5|$|The game {{includes}} a research function. When new objects are {{encountered in the}} game, especially enemies, their organs can be collected and, when combined with chemicals found in storage rooms, the player can research the enemies and thus improve their damage against them. Similarly, some exotic weapons and items can only be used after being researched. OSA agents effectively have a separate weapons tree <b>available</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> Psionic powers can be learned, such as invisibility, fireballs, and teleportation.|$|E
5|$|Although {{attacks against}} living humans are rare, the spotted hyena readily feeds on human corpses. In the {{tradition}} of the Maasai and the Hadza, corpses are left in the open for spotted hyenas to eat. A corpse rejected by hyenas is seen as having something wrong with it, and liable to cause social disgrace, therefore {{it is not uncommon for}} bodies to be covered in fat and blood from a slaughtered ox. In Ethiopia, hyenas were reported to feed extensively on the corpses of victims of the 1960 attempted coup and the Red Terror. Hyenas habituated to scavenging on human corpses may develop bold behaviours towards living people; hyena attacks on people in southern Sudan increased during the Second Sudanese Civil War, when human corpses were readily <b>available</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

5|$|As the {{intelligence}} <b>available</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> was not conclusive, the Allies believed that Tirpitz still posed a potential threat. Accordingly, Nos. 9 and 617 Squadrons made two further {{attacks on the}} battleship after she moved to Tromsø on 15 October; these operations were more straightforward to conduct than Operation Paravane as the port was {{within the range of}} Lancasters flying from airfields in northern Scotland. The first raid, Operation Obviate, took place on 29 October but caused only minor damage to the battleship. During the subsequent attack conducted on 12 November, Operation Catechism, Tirpitz was struck by several Tallboy bombs and capsized with heavy loss of life among her crew.|$|E
5|$|Compared to Final Fantasy XI, where party-based {{gameplay}} is forefront at all times, the gameplay in XIV is adjusted so {{that players}} {{can go for}} longer periods without joining a party. There is no auto-attack option, with each action needing a manual input while an enemy is targeted. Each action uses up a stamina bar. Through defeating monsters, crafting items, and completing quests, players accumulate EXP which, when a certain threshold is reached, automatically increments the player's level. The player's level affects attributes such as HP (health/hit points), MP (magic/mana points), {{and the number of}} abilities <b>available</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
5|$|For {{the third}} {{successive}} tournament, Wales had {{missed out on}} qualification by a slender margin, having missed the 1982 World Cup on goal difference, and the 1984 European Championship by a single point. Despite this setback, which {{was followed by a}} 3–0 home defeat to Hungary in October, the team went {{through the rest of the}} season with only one other defeat, against Canada in May 1986. There was also the sense of history repeating itself in that, just as in 1977, it was a controversial penalty decision that ended up costing them dearly. Despite this however, there was also a feeling that, given the group of players <b>available</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> they would qualify for the next tournament. As it was, Wales failed to qualify for a major tournament until the 2016 European Championships.|$|E

5|$|Herodotus {{suggests}} that the Allied ships were heavier and, by implication, less maneuverable. Their weight would further {{reduce the likelihood of}} the Allied ships employing the diekplous. The source of this heaviness is uncertain; possibly the Allied ships were bulkier in construction. Another suggestion is that the heaviness was caused by the weight of fully armoured hoplite marines. The Allies may have had extra marines on board if their ships were less maneuverable, since boarding would then be the main tactic <b>available</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> (at the cost of making the ships even heavier). Indeed, Herodotus refers to the Greeks capturing ships, rather than sinking them.|$|E
5|$|Players {{assume the}} role of a person {{suffering}} from depression, and the story centers on their daily life, including encounters at work and their relationship with their girlfriend. The story also features various treatments for depression. Players are periodically faced with choices that alter the course of the story. To make a choice, the player must click on the corresponding hyperlink. However, choices are often crossed out and cannot be clicked on, a mechanism that Depression Quest uses to portray the character's mental state and the fact that logical decisions may not be <b>available</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> Beneath the choices presented to the player are a set of statements about the character, indicating their level of depression, {{whether or not they are}} in therapy, and whether or not they are currently on medication.|$|E
5|$|The {{blurring}} or {{diffusion of}} the Republic's more rigid hierarchies led to increased social mobility under the Empire, both upward and downward, {{to an extent}} that exceeded that of all other well-documented ancient societies. Women, freedmen, and slaves had opportunities to profit and exercise influence in ways previously less <b>available</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> Social life in the Empire, particularly for those whose personal resources were limited, was further fostered by a proliferation of voluntary associations and confraternities (collegia and sodalitates) formed for various purposes: professional and trade guilds, veterans' groups, religious sodalities, drinking and dining clubs, performing arts troupes, and burial societies.|$|E

5|$|From the 2007–08 season onwards, former Slovenian internationals Zlatko Zahovič as {{the sport}} director, and soon afterwards, Darko Milanič {{as the head}} coach, were {{appointed}} to head the club's sports department. On 10 May 2008, the club re-opened the renovated Ljudski vrt, which had undergone a major reconstruction that lasted almost 20months. The first match played in the newly refurbished stadium was a league match against Nafta and was won 3–1 in front of 12,435spectators. At the start of 2008–09 season, Maribor entered history books as the first club who won 1,000points in the Slovenian top division, after a 2–1 away win against Rudar Velenje on 26 July 2008. Under the guidance of head coach Darko Milanič, Maribor won all three domestic trophies <b>available</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> (the Slovenian League, Cup, and Supercup) in only two seasons with the club, thus becoming the first coach with all three domestic trophies won in Slovenian football. On 12 December 2010, the club celebrated its 50th anniversary. With the 2–1 away victory over Primorje, on 21 May 2011, Maribor secured its ninth Slovenian league title. Four days later the team played the Slovenian cup final at Stožice stadium and lost to Domžale 4–3.|$|E
5|$|Halo 4 {{takes place}} in a futuristic science fiction setting in the year 2557, four years after the events of Halo 3. Backstory details that {{hundreds}} of thousands of years before the modern era, humans were one of several interstellar civilizations. Following a war with the parasitic Flood, the humans came into conflict with the Forerunners, a powerful race that upheld a policy of benevolent shepherding of other races known as the Mantle of Responsibility. Humanity had begun an aggressive campaign of destroying any Flood infestations on a planet, which was misinterpreted as a desire for conquest. After centuries of war the Forerunners defeated the humans, ancestors of the contemporary human race, and stripped them of their technology and empire. The Forerunners soon fought the Flood themselves; after exhausting every other strategic option <b>available</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> the Forerunners activated weapons of mass destruction known as the Halo Array. The Array's firing killed all sentient life in the galaxy to deprive the Flood of their food. Life that the Forerunners cataloged was then reseeded throughout the galaxy.|$|E
5|$|However, {{it is not}} {{yet clear}} whether the {{citizenship}} rights in articles 18 and 21 TFEU are partly <b>available</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> as British Citizens, given the limited restriction of their rights under article 2 of the Protocol. That restriction on the exercise of certain freedoms does not apply to all Community or Union rights. The freedom of movement under the prior EC régime was and remains a separate set of rights from the Citizen rights under article 20 and 21 TFEU which include the right to move and reside. Those rights are primary citizenship rights, not a mere freedom. It might not need a Treaty change to perfect this, merely a preliminary ruling from the CJEU, and supplementary implementation measures from the Council, given the effective right of entrance and residence granted to EU nationals via Article 4 of the Protocol. Jersey residents presently do not have a right to vote in elections for the European Parliament.
