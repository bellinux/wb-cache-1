5|$|Bob {{has been}} fooled by Jeanie's lies {{about why they}} <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> out, and is enlightened when Sidney lets slip that Larry and Jeanie are seeing each other. Bob demands proof, and Sidney tells Bob to watch {{what happens in the}} wings during the {{upcoming}} Act 1 finale to Me and Juliet. Bob sees Larry and Jeanie kiss after she comes offstage with a tray of flowers, an action caught by Bob's spotlight. Mac enters, grasps the situation, sends Larry away, then puts the tray back in Jeanie's hands and pushes her onstage. She is pursued by Bob's spotlight, which relentlessly follows her around the stage as {{more and more of the}} dancers become aware something has gone badly wrong. Bob drops a sandbag from the light bridge; it knocks the tray Jeanie is holding to the ground. Mac orders the curtain lowered in front of a stage in panic.|$|E

25|$|You cannot surely mean {{to degrade}} the Joan of Arc into a pot girl. You <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going,</b> I hope, to annex to that most splendid {{ornament}} of Southey's poem all this cock and a bull story of Joan the publican's daughter of Neufchatel, with the lamentable episode of a waggoner, his wife, and six children; the texture {{will be most}} lamentably disproportionate. The first forty or fifty lines of these addenda are, no doubt, in their way, admirable, too; but many would prefer the Joan of Southey.|$|E
25|$|Delaware {{experienced}} all {{the contention}} and bitterness of a border {{state in the}} Civil War and the {{events leading up to}} it, but because of its location and certain decisive military action, was spared much of the bloodshed of Kentucky and Missouri. Nevertheless, the divisions in communities and families, and their corresponding strong feelings were the same. A slave state with very few slaves or slaveholders, many in Delaware had an attitude they called “states rights,” which really meant, “Outsiders <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to tell us what to do.” Given the close economic ties to Philadelphia, and the geographical separation from the Confederacy, there was little sentiment for actual secession. However, the opposition to the abolitionist and voting rights agenda of the Republican federal government were strong enough to create considerable contentiousness. These feeling were strongest in the two lower counties, which still had a majority of the population in 1860, and completely dominated the General Assembly, the real decision maker in the state.|$|E
25|$|The {{other major}} {{sticking}} point, which is reportedly causing concern at government level, {{is that the}} majority of people going to Potsdamer Platz are visitors to the city, implying that the original vision of the development as a linking element attracting Berliners themselves, and Berliners {{from both sides of the}} former divide, has not really materialised. There are criticisms that the development does not sit easily with or connect with its surroundings, and as a result Berliners have had difficulty accepting it as theirs (despite the fact that the choice of Hilmer & Sattler's masterplan was partly because it was the only one to address the way the development juxtaposed with the Cultural Forum immediately to the west, although the Cultural Forum has itself faced similar criticisms of its own). Another, more psychological factor that has played a part here is that a long-standing mutual distrust or antipathy felt between former East Berliners and West Berliners (Ossis and Wessis according to the well-known slang terms), is still very much in evidence in the city and elsewhere in Germany, and bold civil engineering projects and architectural statements <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to make it go away by themselves. Politicians past and present have been accused of short-sightedness in speculating that they would.|$|E

500|$|The Irish Republican Army (IRA) {{also had}} a bombing {{campaign}} ongoing, and in December 1975 Bond [...] "saturated" [...] the centre of London with plainclothes police officers. Four IRA members took two people hostage in Balcombe Street, following a police chase which involved a shoot out on 7 December. The terrorists called the police, in a call which was routed to Bond; who refused their demands of a plane to fly to Ireland, proclaiming that [...] "They <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> anywhere {{and they are not}} getting any plane to Ireland. We <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to make any deals at all." [...] The gunmen gave up on 12 December, their surrender sparking fears of reprisals, after what Bond called a [...] "rather humiliating episode," [...] Bond [...] "masterminded" [...] the operation to regain the hostages. He retired the following year, in 1976, and received the Order of the British Empire in the New Year's honours list. Upon his retirement in February 1976, he had served in the police for 30 years, full of [...] "exemplary conduct." [...] In his time, Bond received 12 Commissioner's Commendations and 7 for [...] "courage, diligence and determination in the course of investigations." ...|$|E

500|$|Arguably the {{highlight}} of the year was the defeat of the Centre Praying Colonels by a score of 24 to 0. It was Centre's first loss to a southern team since 1916. A story goes that tackle Bill Fincher sought to knock Centre quarterback [...] "Bo" [...] McMillin out of the game, taking with him brass-knuckles or [...] "something equally diabolical." [...] Before the game, Fincher said [...] "You're a great player Bo...I feel awful sorry about it because you <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to be in there very longabout three minutes." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{an attempt}} to deflect the pressure, Carney and PRTEU {{contacted}} [...] Virginia congressman Howard W. Smith, {{who at the time}} was the Chair of the House Committee to Investigate Executive Agencies. Smith, known for his segregationist views and eager to embarrass and possibly destroy the FEPC, quickly scheduled a hearing. In the meantime, the union informed the PTC that it refused to comply with the FEPC order, and the PTC management told Ross that, given the union's position, the PTC would not comply with the FEPC directive either. [...] The hearing in front of Smith's committee took place on January 11, 1944. The hearing was inconclusive, with Ross reiterating the FEPC position, and the union representatives falling back on the [...] "customs clause" [...] and their claims about seniority issues. Several white workers testifying at the hearing predicted that there would be trouble and unrest if promotions of black employees at the PTC were allowed: [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to accept them [...] as fellow workers. ... We <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to work with them. If anybody believe it, let them try it". A petition, signed by 1776 workers, presented at the hearing, read: [...] "Gentlemen: We, the white employees of the Philadelphia Transportation Co., refuse to work with Negroes as motormen, conductors, operators and station trainmen".|$|E
500|$|In The Enchanted Forest, the Ogre Wars {{continue}} but <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> {{well for}} the lands controlled by Sir Maurice (Eric Keenleyside). Rumpelstiltskin (Robert Carlyle) arrives and agrees to aid the battle in exchange for Maurice's daughter, Belle (Emilie de Ravin) to be his servant. Belle's fiancée, Gaston (Sage Brocklebank), and her father are against the terms but Belle agrees. At his castle, Rumpelstiltskin gives Belle a list of tasks, including skinning the children that he hunts for their pelts. At this Belle drops and chips a teacup in shock, but he explains {{that it is a}} joke and doesn't mind about the chipped cup.|$|E
500|$|One of Sherman's main {{concerns}} in postwar commands {{was to protect}} the construction and operation of the railroads from attack by hostile Indians. Sherman's views on Indian matters were often strongly expressed. He regarded the railroads [...] "as {{the most important element}} now in progress to facilitate the military interests of our Frontier". Hence, in 1867, he wrote to Grant that [...] "we <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to let a few thieving, ragged Indians check and stop the progress of [...]" [...] After the 1866 Fetterman Massacre, Sherman wrote Grant that [...] "we must act with vindictive earnestness against the Sioux, even to their extermination, men, women and children." ...|$|E

500|$|McMillin {{also had}} his only loss {{to a team}} from the South, to Georgia Tech by a 20–0 score. Tech tackle Bill Fincher {{reportedly}} tried to knock McMillin {{out of the game}} with brass knuckles or [...] "something equally diabolical." [...] Before the game, Fincher said [...] "You're a great player Bo...I feel awful sorry about it because you <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to be in there very long—about three minutes." [...] The Atlanta Constitution reported, [...] "McMillin's forward passes outdid anything of the kind seen here in many years, but Tech seemed to know where they were going". According to one writer, [...] "Even the great [...] "Bo" [...] McMillin was powerless against the Tech players".|$|E
500|$|Donayre {{became the}} center of an {{international}} controversy on November 24, 2008, when Peruvian media showed a YouTube video in which the general said [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to let Chileans pass by (...) [...] Chilean who enters will not leave. Or will leave in a coffin. And if there aren't sufficient coffins, there will be plastic bags". The video, dated to 2006 or 2007, was recorded during a [...] party at a friend's house attended by army officials and civilians. These comments caused widespread indignation in Chile, making headlines in the El Mercurio newspaper. The Peruvian president, Alan García, called his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet, to explain that these remarks did not reflect official Peruvian policy. Bachelet declared herself satisfied with the explanations.|$|E
500|$|The {{introduction}} of the Bosman ruling in 1995 had negative consequences for Ajax in the 1996–97 season. The club lost several players, and reinvested poorly according to Winner. Injuries also affected their challenge for honours; many players were exhausted {{as a result of}} UEFA Euro 1996 and the short summer break that came with it. Chairman Michael van Praag was determined to keep the club's players and revealed Overmars had signed a four-year contract in 1996. He added, [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to allow them to break their contracts so they are not leaving." [...] On the pitch, Overmars made his return from injury against AZ on 28 August 1996. He had his least productive season for Ajax, scoring two goals. The club finished the season in fourth position.|$|E
