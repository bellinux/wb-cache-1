25|$|Accelerated {{low-water}} corrosion (ALWC) is {{a particularly}} aggressive form of MIC that affects steel piles in seawater near the low water tide mark. It is characterized by an orange sludge, which smells of hydrogen sulfide when treated with acid. Corrosion rates can be very high and design corrosion allowances can soon be exceeded leading to premature failure of the steel pile.

For unprotected piles, sacrificial anodes can be installed locally to the affected areas to inhibit the corrosion or a complete retrofitted sacrificial <b>anode</b> <b>system</b> can be installed.

40|$|This {{conference will}} serve as an {{introduction}} to the Workshop untitled « Cathodic Protection of Steel in Concrete by galvanic anodes and will present the French state of the art on the use of this type of repair. Galvanic (or sacrificial) <b>anode</b> <b>systems</b> can be applied in many structures like bridges, harbours, industrial silos, buildings, car parks, for example. These structures exist in various environments : carbonated, chlorinated, marine, etc. Galvanic <b>anode</b> <b>systems</b> can be surface installed or embedded within the concrete. The following different key aspects of the galvanic <b>anode</b> <b>systems</b> will be discussed: Galvanic current directly depends on the steel current demand. As corrosion rate varies with weather conditions (humidity, temperature) and with concrete cover components (old concrete, marine salts, de-icing salts, new concrete,), the galvanic current is never constant and can even be nil if the steel is not corroding anymore. Thus the current variations of the electrochemical cell with time needs to be explained. Design of these systems is essential to ensure that the required protection will work efficiently. The number, size, capacity and location of galvanic anodes is dependent on the current demand, the electrolyte resistivity, the structure geometry, etc. In a classical design of cathodic protection in sea water for instance, resistivity of the media is constant whereas concrete is not a homogeneous material. Different design parameters will be considered. Galvanic <b>anode</b> <b>systems</b> monitoring is at the option of the purchaser and this is often understood as an advantage compared to impressed current cathodic protection that obviously needs to be checked all life through. But without monitoring, no evidence of the performance of the system can be achieved. Embedded reference electrodes, special connexion systems, electrical and electronic devices are available for monitoring galvanic current and will be referred to. Performance criteria can be based on potential measurements (current off, on, cartography), polarisation tests (upon time), current density monitoring. Nevertheless, more studies and analysis are necessary to find out or develop proper performance criteria that has been difficult to obtain if we look back over past experiences. Durability of the galvanic <b>anode</b> <b>systems</b> has not been sufficiently and scientifically explored yet. Examinations could be made on old <b>anode</b> <b>systems</b> that are still in service (visual examination, chemical analysis, estimation of the anode consumption rate) in order to estimate it. All these points will be presented and discussed during this introducing conference...|$|R

This {{study was the}} first of its kind which looked at long term {{performance}} of hybrid <b>anode</b> <b>systems</b> in reinforced concrete while also using a holistic approach to corrosion risk assessment. An independent appraisal of the site performance of DuoGuard™ Hybrid Anode™ systems was conducted on six bridges structures between 2013 and 2014. The hybrid systems had been installed on six reinforced concrete bridge structures in the UK between 2006 and 2013. The aim of the study was to investigate the efficiency of current design approach to meet the residual service life when the anodes are operating in the galvanic phase. This was achieved by analysing data on the general condition of the structures, the ongoing performance of the installed hybrid anodes, and assessing the overall corrosion risk of the structures. It was found that the six structures were generally in good condition, with low associated corrosion risks. More specifically, the areas protected by the hybrid <b>anode</b> <b>systems</b> had no associated defects or evidence of corrosion. This is a positive finding for the wider implementation of hybrid <b>anode</b> <b>systems</b> as an alternative corrosion management technique. The reinforcement in the protected areas remained predominately in a passive condition, with calculated corrosion rates below the ISO 12696 : 2012 recommended threshold of 2 mA/m². On some occasions the corrosion rates exceeded the recommended threshold; in these instances, corrosion risk was assessed by analysing the trends of long term monitoring data (e. g. open steel circuit potentials) for signs of corrosion initiation.

40|$|A {{dissertation}} thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the award of the degree Doctor of Engineering (EngD), at Loughborough University. Galvanic anode technology has in recent years {{come to the fore}} as a cost-effective method of successfully mitigating the corrosion of reinforcing steel in concrete structures. Developments in the field of cathodic protection have included the introduction of a novel Hybrid <b>anode</b> <b>system,</b> which uses the same sacrificial anode to pass a short-term impressed current before being connected to the steel directly to provide a long-term galvanic current. Galvanic and hybrid technologies are often seen as less powerful solutions in the treatment of reinforcement corrosion, and the test methodologies which determine the efficacy of cathodic protection systems favour impressed current technologies. The work completed has investigated the application of traditional and novel corrosion assessment techniques to laboratory samples to assess the protection offered by the hybrid treatment methodology in both treatment phases. In addition, the response of both galvanic and hybrid anodes to environmental conditions has been recorded and assessed before being discussed in the context of steel protection criteria. Finally, an investigation is presented into the on-site deterioration of commercially pure titanium feeder wire installed as part of the hybrid <b>anode</b> <b>system</b> and potential solutions to the problem have been documented. The research undertaken found that the hybrid <b>anode</b> <b>system</b> is capable of protecting steel in challenging, aggressive environments. This was confirmed by steel corrosion rate and indicative steel potential measurements. The responsive behaviour investigation showed that the current output of galvanic and hybrid anodes responds rapidly to changes in the corrosion risk posed to the steel and that this has a direct effect on <b>anode</b> <b>system</b> lifetimes. An assessment of the polarisation-based protection criteria applied to steel in concrete has found that the standard inhibits the use of responsive behaviour, and that revisions which consider the present risk of steel corrosion by considering the corrosion current resulting from the relative aggressivity of the concrete environment would be more valid in their application. A cathodic protection system based on the concepts of pit re-alkalisation and pH maintenance can fully utilise galvanic anode responsive behaviour. It was discovered that the deterioration of commercially pure titanium feeder wire seen on site installations was due to anodising in the presence of chloride media which had the potential to lead to pitting corrosion. The pitting risk varied depending on the duration of the treatment and proximity to the installed anode. An anodically grown oxide delayed the onset of corrosion in aqueous KBr solution, but did not significantly increase the pitting potential...|$|E

This is also valid for tool and mould making. Therefore, in this field strategies such as rapid tooling are required which allow for a fast and low-cost manufacturing of small or pilot series. This dissertation shows a new approach in the field of rapid tooling by applying directed electro-chemical layers to laser-sintered tools and moulds in particular In the first part of this study, those physical and chemical parameters of this coating method which may have an effect on quality are worked out. It can be demonstrated that apart from the characteristics of the electric field, hydro-dynamic effects decisively influence the quality of a coating. A simulation model, which fundamentally differs from current approaches, is based on these results. The effectiveness of the simulation has been proved in experiments with two different electrolytes. Anodes have to be adapted to the geometry of a work-piece in order to ensure the required identical conditions concerning current and electrical field in every point of the work-piece's surface. Due to the costs of manufacturing, such work-piece dependent anodes, have up to now have been employed in line production only. This constraint could be compensated by a flexible <b>anode</b> <b>system</b> adjustable to variously shaped surfaces. In the second part of this study, the principle of such an <b>anode</b> <b>system</b> usable for different work-pieces is described and its use in a real coating process successfully verified.

40|$|Since mid- 80 ‟s {{cathodic}} protection (CP) has been recognised as the „‟only technique known to stop corrosion {{regardless of the}} levels of chloride contamination in concrete‟‟ (FHWA, 1982) and is {{proved to be the}} most cost effective means to extend the useful life of the structure. Cathodic protection is an electrochemical technique to stop/mitigate corrosion by supplying „current‟ from an external source in order to suppress the „internally generated‟ current flow due to corrosion processes. The „external‟ current source could be obtained simply by coupling the steel to another electrochemically more active metal, e. g. zinc; alternatively the „external‟ current may be derived from a mains operated low voltage DC power source, viz. transformer/rectifier unit. These two different approaches to supply „external‟ current to stop corrosion are generically termed as: „Sacrificial Anode Cathodic Protection (SACP) ‟ system and „Impressed Current Cathodic Protection (ICCP) ‟ system, respectively. Both approaches have proved to be feasible, but the impressed current CP system offers greater flexibility with regard to its ability to provide the necessary current in situations where concrete resistivity is relatively high and variable. The sacrificial <b>anode</b> <b>system</b> is most effective if the concrete resistivity is very low or the anode is placed in a very low resistivity environment such as soil with low resistivity, as the inherent driving voltage is low e. g. the potential difference between zinc and corroding steel in concrete is limited to approximately 0. 7 volts. Other contra-distinction between the two approaches are that the design life of the sacrificial anode systems are usually range between 10 - 15 years; on the other hand the design life of the ICCP systems could be well in excess of 60 + years (depending on the type of <b>anode</b> <b>system).</b> Page 2 Following the successful application of first CP system, based on impressed current CP (ICCP), on a bridge deck in California, USA 1973, the technology has advanced significantly, particularly the anode systems (which is the main arbiter of a CP system) to deliver the protection current efficiently providing adequate protection (i. e. meeting the criteria recommended in BS EN ISO 12696 : 2012 and other International Standards). Most of the CP installations worldwide are operating in ICCP mode. However, due to the escalating cost of anode systems and associated external power supply as well as monitoring/control units for ICCP installation has led researchers to actively pursue different means of developing low cost anode systems. Researchers have mainly focused on sacrificial anode CP (SACP) systems, as SACP does not require an external power supply and control units, but the drawback to this <b>anode</b> <b>system</b> is that it has a shorter life span (usually 10 - 15 years compared to 60 + years for ICCP anodes).

40|$|Corrosion {{of steel}} {{reinforcement}} in concrete bridges and parking garages {{due to the}} intrusion of chloride ions from deicing salt {{is a serious problem}} in northern climates. A number of approaches have been used in the past to mitigate steel corrosion. Cathodic protection is considered to be the only technique to slow down corrosion in salt contaminated concrete to a negligible rate. This is accomplished by either an impressed current anode or a sacrificial anode in the system. The impressed current <b>anode</b> <b>system,</b> with metallized zinc as the anode material, has been used with success on a number of bridges. The sacrificial <b>anode</b> <b>system</b> has been used on a limited number of bridges under marine environment. An impressed current system is difficult to apply to parking garages because of the thickness of concrete cover in these structures. Cover in concrete parking garages is typically much thinner than that used in bridges, and may easily cause electrical shorts between the anode and the reinforcing bar. Systems with sacrifical anodes, commonly referred to as galvanic cathodic protection systems, instead, take advantage of the reduced thickness of concrete cover, thus becoming a feasible form of protection for parking structures. The goal of this research project is to develop a sacrificial anode for cathodic protection of steel reinforcement in parking garages and bridges. Although {{it is too early to}} draw conclusions, certain trends have been reported on performance of sacrificial anode systems. So far the results indicate that the effectiveness of galvanic cathodic protection increases with decreasing the thickness of concrete cover.

In this study, the scale-up of electrochemical flow system was investigated by treating petrochemical wastewater using platinized titanium (Ti/Pt) and boron-doped diamond (BDD) anodes. It was demonstrated that flow cell was successfully scaled-up because when it was compared with batch mode (Rocha et al. 2012 b), higher performances on organic matter removal were achieved. Under the suitable operating conditions and better anode material, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) of petrochemical wastewater was reduced from 2, 746 to 200 mg L− 1 within 5 h with an energy consumption of only 56. 2 kWh m− 3 in the scaled-up BDD <b>anode</b> <b>system.</b> These results demonstrate that anode flow system is very promising in practical bio-refractory organic wastewater treatment...|$|E
40|$|In this dissertation, the {{catalytic}} growth of nano fibrils over solid surface of different geometric types is studied and their applications are also investigated. The new experimental results on olefin polymerization with metallocene catalyst over silica supports of different geometries are presented. Flat surface silica, nano-sized spherical silica, straight cylindrical pore silica, macroporous silica, and conventional silica {{are used as}} support materials. The {{presence or absence of}} intraparticle monomer diffusion resistance and particle fragmentation has been shown to have significant effects on the catalytic activity. Also the effects of support geometry on the morphology of polymers and intrinsic catalytic activity are analyzed. The {{catalytic growth}} of olefin nano fibrils are applied in micro/milli reactors. Unlike many conventional olefin reactors, the reaction temperature, heat transfer and bimodal distribution of polymer molecular weight can easily be controlled in the micro/milli reactor systems developed during this study. The catalytic growth of carbon nano fibrils on silicon has been investigated for application as anode materials in Li-ion batteries. This research is aimed at developing a binder free silicon <b>anode</b> <b>system</b> that consists of a modified Cu foil (current collector), Si nanoparticles (SiNPs), and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). This <b>anode</b> <b>system</b> includes the nanostructured Cu surface layer as a hub for the Si nanoparticles that undergo deformation and fragmentation during the charge/discharge cycles. SiNPs are deposited with Fe-Co bimetallic catalyst and CNTs are grown in situ at the catalyst sites. The surface layer of the Cu is modified via an oxidation and reduction processes to have knife-like nanostructures with high void fractions. The SiNPs are deposited on/in to the nanostructured Cu foil without any binders. The CNTs growing at the surface of the SiNPs serve as the electron conductor and also holds the SiNP during the lithiation/delithiation cycles. Since Si/CNT particles are surrounded by thin protrusions on the surface of Cu current collector, the maximum connectivity between silicon and current collector can be obtained, and excellent cycle stability of the battery can be maintained without any binders...|$|E
40|$|This aim of {{this work}} is to {{determine}} carbon formation when methane is reformed directly inside the SOFC anodes, from thermodynamic equilibrium and kinetic approaches. Two carbon formation determination approaches - carbon-steam equilibrium and carbon activity approaches were then presented, compared and discussed. The consideration of the reversed syngas formation reaction {{is important to the}} carbon activity approach, which {{is expected to be a}} useful tool for determining carbon formation in the <b>anode</b> recirculation <b>system.</b> The investigation of the combined steam and dry methane reforming, both thermodynamic equilibrium computational modelling approach and kinetic experimental validation were presented in this work. Different ratios among methane, steam and carbon dioxide, leading to different oxygen to carbon atomic were used to examine the methane reforming and the carbon formation prevention abilities. Finally, a kinetic modelling for a methane fed SOFC with <b>anode</b> recirculation <b>system</b> was built based on the integration of different functions for a more detailed investigation. The combination of different fuel current densities (i. e. 0. 5, 1. 0 and 1. 4), steam to methane ratios (i. e. 0. 25 - 4. 0) in the fuel and different recycling rate (i. e. 10...|$|R
40|$|The {{nature and}} {{kinetics}} of electrode reactions and processes occurring for four lightweight <b>anode</b> <b>systems</b> {{which have been}} utilised in reinforced concrete cathodic protection systems have been studied. The anodes investigated were flame sprayed zinc, conductive paint and two activated titanium meshes. The electrochemical properties of each material were investigated in rapidly stirred de-oxygenated electrolytes using anodic potentiodynamic polarisation. Conductive coating electrodes were formed on glass microscope slides, whilst mesh strands were immersed directly. Oxygen evolution occurred preferentially for both mesh anodes in saturated Ca (OH) 2 /CaC 12 solutions but was severely inhibited in less alkaline solutions and significant current only passed in chloride solutions. The main reactions for conductive paint was based on oxygen evolution in all electrolytes, although chlorides increased the electrical activity. Self-corrosion of zinc was controlled by electrolyte composition and the experimental set-up, chlorides increasing the electrical activity. Impressed current cathodic protection was applied to 25 externally exposed concrete slabs {{over a period of}} 18 months to investigate anode degradation mechanisms at normal and high current densities. Specimen chloride content, curing and reinforcement depth were also variables. Several destructive and non-destructive methods for assessing the performance of anodes were evaluated including a site instrument for quantitative "instant-off- potential measurements. The impact of cathodic protection on the concrete substrate was determined for a number of specimens using appropriate methods. Anodic degradation rates were primarily influenced by current density, followed by cemendtious alkalinity, chloride levels and by current distribution. Degradation of cementitious overlays and conductive paint substrates proceeded by sequential neutralisation of cement phases, with some evidence of paint binder oxidation. Sprayed zinc progressively formed an insulating layer of hydroxide complexes, which underwent pitting_ attack in the presence of sufficient chlorides, whilst substrate degradation was minimal. Adhesion of all <b>anode</b> <b>systems</b> decreased with increasing current density. The influence of anode material on the ionic gradients which can develop during cathodic protection was investigated. A constant current was passed through saturated cement paste prisms containing calcium chloride to central cathodes via anodes applied or embedded at each end. Pore solution was obtained from successive cut paste slices for anion and cation analyses. Various experimental errors reduced the value of the results. Characteristic S-shaped profiles were not observed and chloride ion profiles were ambiguous. Mesh anode specimens were significantly more durable than the conductive coatings in the high humidity environment. Limited results suggested zinc ion migration to the cathode region. Electrical data from each investigation clearly indicated a decreasing order of anode efficiency by specific anode material...|$|R
