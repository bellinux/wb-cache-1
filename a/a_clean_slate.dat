5|$|Charles V {{ascended the}} thrones of both Spain and the Holy Roman Empire {{following}} {{the deaths of}} his grandfathers, Ferdinand in 1516 and Maximilian in 1519. Francis I likewise became king of France upon the death of Louis in 1515, leaving three relatively young rulers and an opportunity for <b>a</b> <b>clean</b> <b>slate.</b> The careful diplomacy of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey had resulted in the Treaty of London in 1518, aimed at uniting the kingdoms of western Europe {{in the wake of}} a new Ottoman threat, and it seemed that peace might be secured. Henry met Francis I on 7 June 1520 at the Field of the Cloth of Gold near Calais for a fortnight of lavish entertainment. Both hoped for friendly relations in place of the wars of the previous decade. The strong air of competition laid to rest any hopes of a renewal of the Treaty of London, however, and conflict was inevitable. Henry had more in common with Charles, whom he met once before and once after Francis. Charles brought the Empire into war with France in 1521; Henry offered to mediate, but little was achieved and by the end of the year Henry had aligned England with Charles. He still clung to his previous aim of restoring English lands in France, but also sought to secure an alliance with Burgundy, then part of Charles' realm, and the continued support of Charles. A small English attack in the north of France made up little ground. Charles defeated and captured Francis at Pavia and could dictate peace; but he believed he owed Henry nothing. Sensing this, Henry decided to take England out of the war before his ally, signing the Treaty of the More on 30 August 1525.|$|E

Adam's season-long romance with Blake's secretary Dana Waring (Leann Hunley) culminates in a wedding, which is punctuated in the May 6, 1987 season finale by Alexis's car plunging off a bridge into a river and the violent return of a vengeful Matthew Blaisdel.

The naivety of this view has, however, been exposed by commentators such as Shapiro, Reidenberg, and Lessig who have clearly demonstrated the inherent regulability of networked space. The question no longer is: can networked space be regulated? but rather, how and by whom is it regulated? This paper examines the regulation of rights in networked space. Property rights and rights to free speech, or free expression, are examined in relation to a number of issues that have emerged in the networked environment, or cyberspace.

40|$|The {{transmission}} control protocol (TCP) is the major trans- port layer protocol in the Internet today. TCP and its vari- ants have the drawback of not knowing the explicit rate share of flows at bottleneck links. The Rate Control Proto- col (RCP) is <b>a</b> major <b>clean</b> <b>slate</b> congestion control protocol which has been recently proposed to address these draw- backs. RCP tries to get explicit knowledge of flow shares at bottleneck links. However, RCP under or over estimates the number of active flows which it needs to obtain the flow fair rate share. This causes under or over utilization of bot- tleneck link capacity. This in turn can result in very high queue length and packet drops which translate into a high average file completion time (AFCT). In this paper we present the design and analysis of a Network congestion Control Protocol (NCP). NCP can give flows their fair share rates and hence resulting in the minimum AFCT. Unlike RCP, NCP can also use accurate formula to calculate the number of flows sharing a network link. This enables NCP to assign fair share rates to flows without over or under-utilization of bottleneck link capacities. Simula- tion results confirm the design goals of NCP in achieving minimum AFCT when compared with RCP. unpublishednot peer reviewe...|$|R
