Kadyrov also tightened his control over information coming from Tsentoroy by not allowing any of the village's 5,000 inhabitants to leave {{in the days after the}} attack; the citizenry were also allegedly under the threat of death not to talk about the siege or the damage inflicted by the rebels.|$|E

25|$|Chromosomes {{in humans}} {{can be divided}} into two types: autosomes (body chromosome(s)) and {{allosome}} (sex chromosome(s)). Certain genetic traits are linked to a person's sex and are passed on through the sex chromosomes. The autosomes contain the rest of the genetic hereditary information. All act in the same way during cell division. Human cells have 23 pairs of chromosomes (22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes), giving a total of 46 per cell. In addition to these, human cells have many hundreds of copies of the mitochondrial genome. Sequencing of the human genome has provided {{a great deal of information}} <b>about</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> the chromosomes. Below is a table compiling statistics for the chromosomes, based on the Sanger Institute's human genome information in the Vertebrate Genome Annotation (VEGA) database. Number of genes is an estimate, as it is in part based on gene predictions. Total chromosome length is an estimate as well, based on the estimated size of unsequenced heterochromatin regions.|$|E

He readily engages with them and speaks with remarkable candor {{on a wide variety}} of subjects – his illness, his impressions of Switzerland, art, philosophy, love, death, the brevity of life, capital punishment, and donkeys. In response to their request that he speaks of the time he was in love, he tells a long anecdote from his time in Switzerland about a downtrodden woman—Marie—whom he befriended, along with a group of children, when she was unjustly subjected to cruel persecution and universal moral condemnation. The Prince ends by describing what he divines <b>about</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> their characters from studying their faces and surprises them by saying that Aglaya is almost as beautiful as Nastassya Filippovna.|$|E

500|$|When {{the monsters}} battle {{each other at}} the end of the episode, a Japanese man sings songs <b>about</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> the monsters while they approach. This mirrors a common element {{throughout}} actual Japanese monster movies, which commonly have theme songs for the monster characters. Parker wrote the songs in Japanese language. The English translation for the lyrics sung when Robert Smith transforms translates are, [...] "I really like Robert Smith", and the lyrics sung about Mecha-Streisand translate, [...] "Barbra, Barbra, she's a bitch, Barbra". When Streisand becomes Mecha-Streisand, the line was written in Japanese, [...] "From this moment on, I am Mecha-Streisand!", but Parker said Bergman misread some of the words so the on-air translation was imperfect.

500|$|The IOC Evaluation Commission {{arrived in}} Rio de Janeiro on April 27, 2009, {{to assess the}} quality of the bid, stating that the {{welcoming}} activities prepared by the city had been the best. Unlike the first evaluation, the committee did not assign scores, but analyzed the probability of execution of the plans. During the first two days of the visit, the Evaluation Commission held internal meetings at Copacabana Palace, the host hotel. Between April 29 and 30, the Commission attended technical presentations in a large ballroom equipped with lighting and multi-media resources, where it participated in question-and-answer sessions <b>about</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> the seventeen themes presented in the Candidature File. May Day was marked by the inspectors' visits to all existing venues across the city. On May 2, 2009, the Evaluation Commission made a press conference to highlight the main points of the visit. According to El Moutawakel, the Commission was very impressed with the unity of government support, {{the quality of the}} presentations and the level of integration of the Games in the country's long-term development plan. After seven days of inspections involving 300 professionals, the thirteen members of the IOC Evaluation Commission left Rio de Janeiro on May 3, 2009, on the way to Madrid. One month before the election, on September 2, 2009, Rio officials welcomed the released of the 2016 Evaluation Commission Report. It gave a very positive assessment to the city and described the documents submitted by Rio de Janeiro as [...] "of a very high quality".|$|E
