5|$|In 1833, the Tolpuddle Martyrs {{founded the}} Friendly Society of Agricultural Labourers. Trade unions were legal {{but because the}} members swore an oath of allegiance, they were arrested and tried in the Shire Hall. Beneath the {{courtroom}} are cells where the prisoners were held while <b>awaiting</b> <b>trial.</b> Dorchester Prison was constructed in the town during the 19th century and was used for holding convicted and remanded inmates from the local courts until it closed in December 2013.

5|$|The assailants were {{apparently}} targeting Rami Amira, {{who was sitting}} at a table nearby with Moti Hassin and Simantov Hatayeb, who are all identified with the Abergil group, in an effort to resolve an internal dispute. Amira sustained a slight injury in his cheek {{as a result of the}} attack. He was killed on 2 February 2011 in Rishon Letzion, presumably by the Abergil organization which, according to police sources, continued to operate while the two Abergil brothers were extradited and <b>awaiting</b> <b>trial</b> in the United States.|$|E
5|$|After his arrest, Edwards {{was imprisoned}} in the Tombs, New York City's jail. When he was arrested, {{he had more}} than $44,000 in a trunk in his room. While in jail <b>awaiting</b> <b>trial,</b> Edwards forged a letter alleging he had funds in New Orleans, and then showed the letter {{to one of his}} lawyers in order to reassure the lawyer about Edwards' ability to pay for legal counsel. In an attempt to delay his trial, Edwards also forged a letter from a {{supposed}} witness, Charles Johnson, stating that he was in Cuba and {{would not be able to}} come and testify for Edwards for a while; this gained Edwards a three-month delay.|$|E

5|$|During {{protracted}} enquiries {{before the}} case {{went to court}} in 1871, details emerged suggesting that the Claimant might be Arthur Orton, a butcher's son from Wapping in London, {{who had gone to}} sea as a boy and had last been heard of in Australia. After a civil court had rejected the Claimant's case, he was charged with perjury; while <b>awaiting</b> <b>trial</b> he campaigned throughout the country to gain popular support. In 1874, a criminal court jury decided that he was not Roger Tichborne and declared him to be Arthur Orton. Before passing a sentence of 14 years, the judge condemned the behaviour of the Claimant's counsel, Edward Kenealy, who was subsequently disbarred because of his conduct.|$|E
5|$|The police {{continued}} the investigation, {{under pressure to}} finish quickly. Two reconstructions of the murder were conducted, drawing hundreds of spectators. One was done with Sumaji {{playing the role of}} the murderer, without his lawyers' knowledge; when the counsel found out, they removed him from the reconstruction. Eventually, police agreed to a deal with the counsel, in which Sumaji's pre-trial release was guaranteed in exchange for a promise from his lawyers to not sue for wrongful arrest. Sumaji was released on 17 December, <b>awaiting</b> <b>trial.</b> In early 1997, Sumaji's case was refused by the prosecutor's office several times due to weak evidence.|$|E
5|$|Plays {{were being}} {{performed}} while Corder was still <b>awaiting</b> <b>trial,</b> and an anonymous author published a melodramatic {{version of the}} murder after the execution, a precursor of the Newgate novels which quickly became best-sellers. The Red Barn Murder was a popular subject, along {{with the story of}} Jack Sheppard and other highwaymen, thieves and murderers, for penny gaffs, cheap plays performed in the back rooms of public houses. James Catnach sold more than a million broadsides (sensationalist single sheet newspapers) which gave details of Corder's confession and the execution, and included a sentimental ballad supposedly written by Corder himself (though {{more likely to have been}} the work of Catnach or somebody in his employ). It was one of at least five ballads about the crime that appeared directly following the execution.|$|E

5|$|Suter {{reached the}} 70 point {{mark in the}} next two seasons, {{finishing}} with 76 in 1989–90 and 70 in 1990–91. His latter campaign earned him his fourth All-Star Game appearance. Suter also played much of the season while <b>awaiting</b> <b>trial</b> after he was arrested following a June 1990 scuffle with police as they tried to arrest fellow NHL player Chris Chelios. The issue was resolved in February 1991 when he agreed to a plea bargain on reduced charges and paid an $8,250 fine. A knee injury caused Suter to miss ten games in 1991–92, but he reached two milestones during the season. He scored his 100th career goal on February 25, 1992, against the Buffalo Sabres, and played in his 500th game on March 12 against the Philadelphia Flyers.|$|E
5|$|While Croitoru was <b>awaiting</b> <b>trial</b> for the bombing, the Hamilton {{branch of}} Satan's Choice {{was shut down}} after an {{informant}} gave the police information about the gang's involvement with drug dealing and extortion. The gang's clubhouse was confiscated and the club's national leadership decided to disband the Hamilton chapter. Croitoru got in a fight in Hamilton with another former Satan's Choice member on January 13, 1998. A police officer saw Croitoru punch the other man {{in the face and}} arrested Croitoru for assault. In addition to the assault charge, Croitoru was charged with extortion from an unrelated incident as well as carrying a concealed weapon and breaking the conditions of his release following the police station bombing. In September 1998, Croitoru was brought to trial {{for his role in the}} bombing. He was convicted and sentenced to 33 months in prison.|$|E
5|$|In December 1984, Silcott {{was arrested}} {{for the murder of}} a 22-year-old boxer, Anthony Smith, at a party in Hackney. Smith had been slashed more than once on his face, there were two wounds to his abdomen, a lung had been lacerated and his aorta cut. Silcott was charged with the murder in May 1985 and was out on bail when Blakelock was killed in October that year. At first he told police he had not known Smith and had not been at the party, {{although}} at trial he acknowledged having been there. He said Smith had started punching him, and that he had pushed Smith back but had not been carrying a knife. Silcott was convicted of Smith's murder in February 1986, while <b>awaiting</b> <b>trial</b> for the Blakelock murder, and was sentenced to life imprisonment; he was released in 2003 after serving 17 years. After the conviction he told his lawyer he had indeed known Smith, that there had been bad blood between them, and that he had stabbed the man in self-defence, because one of Smith's friends had had a knife.|$|E

5|$|William Cragh {{was born}} in about 1262 in the Welsh parish of Llanrhidian, Gower, to Rhys ap Gwilym and his wife Swanith. Between 1282 and 1283 King Edward I of England waged a {{military}} campaign in Wales that concluded with his annexation of that country. One of Edward's allies, Rhys ap Maredudd, found the post-war settlement unsatisfactory and launched a rebellion against the king in 1287. Edward's vastly superior forces soon crushed the uprising, but Rhys ap Maredudd remained at liberty until his capture and execution in 1292. Cragh probably {{took part in the}} rebellion on the Welsh side. He was apprehended in 1290 by the son of William de Briouze, the Lord of Gower, who was defending his father's lands against incursions by the rebels still at large. Cragh was one of 14prisoners captured by de Briouze, 12 of whom were subsequently released. He was taken to Swansea Castle, where he was held in the dungeons <b>awaiting</b> <b>trial,</b> accused of killing 13men.|$|E
5|$|In August 1997, Carl Doyle and {{his wife}} Catherine Doyle were stabbed to death in Ballintubber, Co Roscommon by Mark Nash, a 25-year-old {{resident}} of Drumcondra in North Dublin. During his interview with the gardaí, he said that about three months prior to his arrest, as he was walking to Stoneybatter, he broke into a house through the back, and had stabbed two women in their sleep. In his statement, {{there were at least}} two aspects of the crime scene that were not known to the public at the time. Nash later retracted his confession. Nash's confession caused some consternation amongst the gardaí, as Dean Lyons had been charged at that point and was on remand <b>awaiting</b> <b>trial.</b> Two camps emerged within the gardaí, one which believed that Nash's confession threw doubt on Lyons' guilt, the other which believed that Lyons was the murderer. On 27 August 1997, the Garda Commissioner appointed Assistant Commissioner James McHugh to carry out a review of the available evidence. He released a preliminary report on 10 September 1997, and an interim report on 9 January 1998; while these reports did not come to a conclusion about Lyons' guilt, they did raise a number of doubts about his testimony.|$|E
