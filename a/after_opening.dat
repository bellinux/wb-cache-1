5|$|Several months <b>after</b> <b>opening</b> in December 2015, a Sefton Council {{committee}} meeting recorded {{that the road}} was being very well used, with noticeably less traffic on the roads it was bypassing, those being the Northern Perimeter Road and Lydiate Lane respectively. It was subsequently reported in January 2016 that {{a section of the}} road would need to undergo a series of repair works during the evenings of a three-week period, just five months after the road opened to traffic. A year <b>after</b> <b>opening,</b> road users were giving generally positive feedback, with some confirming that travel times had been reduced and offers a more convenient means of accessing the motorways, although a common recurring concern were the junction issues at Switch Island.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} <b>after</b> <b>opening,</b> the Uno Chicago Grill was sued for not paying the builders, suppliers, and utilities. It soon {{changed its name}} to La Sha's West Virginia Bistro and was headed by Powerball winner Jack Whittaker; however, it closed on February 22, 2007 after another lawsuit was filed after Metropolitan Huntington LLC complained that the Bistro owed {{thousands}} for rent.|$|E

5|$|In North America, Nightcrawler earned $500,000 {{from early}} screenings, and <b>after</b> <b>opening</b> to 2,766 theaters, grossed $3.2 million {{on its first}} day of release. It {{finished}} its opening weekend with $10.9 million; journalists attributed the low sales to Halloween festivities. In its second weekend, Nightcrawler dropped forty-nine percent in sales, and grossed $5.4 million. After grossing $28.8 million by December, Nightcrawler reentered North American theaters due to several nominations during the 2014 film awards season. The film eventually finished with $32.4 million in North America.|$|E

5|$|The Senators {{played the}} first game at the Palladium (today called Canadian Tire Centre) on January 17, 1996. One month <b>after</b> <b>opening,</b> Corel Corporation bought the naming rights in a ten-year deal and the arena was renamed the Corel Centre. The naming rights were then {{purchased}} by Scotiabank in a 25-year deal and the arena was re-branded Scotiabank Place. Seven years later, Scotiabank sold the naming rights to Canadian Tire Corporation in a deal which saw the facility receive its current name.|$|E
5|$|These {{fears were}} to prove {{justified}} as, during the line's {{first month of}} operation, {{there were a number}} of well-publicised problems ranging from overcrowding resulting in passengers standing for the whole journey to timekeeping difficulties due to excessive dwell times at stations. Furthermore, signalling problems led to disruption on the line nearly a month <b>after</b> <b>opening.</b>|$|E
5|$|WhiteWater World {{performed}} above expectations <b>after</b> <b>opening</b> {{with approximately}} 23,000 guests between 8 December and 31 December 2006.

5|$|A copy of {{the film}} leaked onto {{peer-to-peer}} file sharing networks just hours <b>after</b> <b>opening</b> in theaters. The film was a time-stamped workprint, suggesting it {{may have come from}} within the industry rather than from someone who videotaped an advance screening. Eight people were later charged with copyright infringement and distributing material illegally. Documents filed by the Los Angeles District Attorney allege that a {{copy of the}} film was taken from an unnamed Californian post-production office by an employee, who later pleaded guilty to his charges. The illegal copy was passed among seven people until reaching an eighth party, who also pleaded guilty to uploading to an unnamed P2P network.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the move}} to Newark, the Devils hired their 14th coach in a 26-season span, Brent Sutter. As the Devils' {{pre-season}} came to an end, prospects Nicklas Bergfors and David Clarkson made the final roster. The Devils opened their new arena, the Prudential Center, on October 27, 2007, against Ottawa <b>after</b> <b>opening</b> {{the season with a}} nine-game road trip. The game ended with a 4–1 win for Ottawa. In the last game of the 2007–08 season against the Rangers, the Devils won in a shootout, giving them home ice advantage over the Rangers in the playoffs. The Devils lost the series against the Rangers 4–1, losing all three games at home. Brodeur won the Vezina Trophy for the fourth time in five years for his performance in the regular season.|$|E
5|$|By 3 May 1975, North Vietnamese forces {{controlled}} all of South Vietnam, just 55 days <b>after</b> <b>opening</b> {{their attack}} on Buôn Ma Thuột. During that time period, {{an army of}} approximately three-quarters of a million men was defeated by a force one-fourth its size. Since {{the end of the}} war, there has been much historical recrimination and discussion as to how and why such a lopsided victory had occurred. Four main lines of thought have remained particularly viable, all of which possess some validity, but all are also open to argument.|$|E

5|$|Chairman Kelvin Thomas {{stepped down}} during the 2012 close season, to be {{replaced}} by owner Ian Lenagan. The 2012–13 season was blighted by injuries and patchy form: <b>after</b> <b>opening</b> the season with three wins and briefly heading the table, United lost their next six games, a pattern of inconsistency that was to continue throughout the season. United finished outside the play-offs for the third consecutive season, but manager Chris Wilder was given a further one-year contract in April 2013. Some Oxford fans were unhappy about the decision to renew Wilder's contract, having pressed for his sacking {{during the second half of}} the 2012–13 season.|$|E
5|$|During {{planning}} and construction, and {{for about half}} a year <b>after</b> <b>opening,</b> the road had no official name and {{was known as the}} Diagonal Highway, Newark–Jersey City Viaduct, or High-Level Viaduct. On May 3, 1933, the New Jersey Legislature passed a bill sponsored by Assemblyman Eugene W. Hejke of Jersey City naming the road the General Casimir Pulaski Memorial Skyway after Casimir Pulaski, the Polish military leader who helped train and lead Continental Army troops in the American Revolutionary War. An official ceremony was held on October 11, 1933, including the unveiling of signs with an abbreviated designation, Gen. Pulaski Skyway.|$|E
5|$|During the party, Tony Yayo enters {{another room}} of the mansion and removes a {{painting}} {{from one of the}} walls, revealing a hidden safe: <b>after</b> <b>opening</b> it and removing a silver necklace, a woman (Buffie Carruth) who has followed him from the party enters the room and the pair begin to embrace. At this point, the police suddenly enter the room, searching for Tony Yayo, although it is shown that he has escaped just in time through an open door in the room. Reunited in the Mercedes-Benz with 50 Cent, Tony Yayo gives the necklace to 50 Cent: at this point, Tony Yayo abruptly wakes up, in his jail cell, showing the preceding events of the video to have been a dream.|$|E
