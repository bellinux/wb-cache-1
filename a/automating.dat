5|$|The {{need for}} the second crewman was an obvious problem with the Mk. XII, {{especially}} as few bombers of the era had enough room for the operator. Working with Henry Braddick, Blackett developed {{a new version of}} the calculator that included aircraft instruments inside the computor, eliminating the {{need for the}} needle-on-needle matching and completely <b>automating</b> the calculations. After the initial design was complete, Blackett moved onto other matters with RAF Coastal Command, where he continued development of his theories of operational research.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s and early 2000s, the MTA began <b>automating</b> the subway by Communication-Based Train Control (CBTC). CBTC supplements, rather than replaces, the fixed-block signal system; it allows trains to operate closer together. The BMT Canarsie Line, {{on which the}} L train runs, was chosen for pilot testing {{because it is a}} {{self-contained}} line that does not operate in conjunction with other lines. CBTC became operational in February 2009. Due to an unexpected ridership increase, the MTA ordered additional cars, and increased service from 15 trains to 26 trains per hour, an achievement beyond the capability of the block system. The total cost of the project was $340 million.|$|E
5|$|The JMP Scripting Language (JSL) is an {{interpreted}} {{language for}} recreating analytic results and for <b>automating</b> or extending the functionality of JMP software. JSL {{was first introduced}} in JMP version 4 in 2000. JSL has a LISP-like syntax, structured {{as a series of}} expressions. All programming elements, including if-then statements and loops, are implemented as JSL functions. Data tables, display elements and analyses are represented by objects in JSL that are manipulated with named messages. Users may write JSL scripts to perform analyses and visualizations not available in the point-and-click interface or to automate a series of commands, such as weekly reports. SAS, R, and Matlab code can also be executed using JSL.|$|E

Because of this, the task of <b>automated</b> proof verification is much simpler than that of <b>automated</b> theorem proving, allowing <b>automated</b> proof checking software to be much simpler than <b>automated</b> theorem proving software.|$|R

5|$|The Microsoft Malware Protection Center {{identified}} a trend away from WSF files {{in favor of}} LNK files and PowerShell scripting. These LNK shortcut files install Locky ransomware by <b>automating</b> infection operations {{rather than relying on}} traditional user downloads of WSF files—all of which is made possible by the universal PowerShell Windows application. Unfortunately, cyber criminals have been able to leverage PowerShell for their attacks for years. In a recent report, the application was found to be involved in nearly 40% of endpoint security incidents. While attackers have been finding weaknesses in the Windows operating system for years, it’s clear that there’s something problematic with PowerShell scripting.|$|E
5|$|The story {{focuses on}} the {{activities}} of the three species {{in a part of the}} Milky Way known as the Koprulu Sector. Millennia before any of the events of the games, a species known as the Xel'Naga genetically engineer the Protoss and later the Zerg in attempts to create pure beings. These experiments backfire and the Xel'Naga are largely destroyed by the Zerg. Centuries before the beginning of StarCraft in 2499, the hardline international government of Earth, the United Earth Directorate (UED), commissions a colonization program as part of a solution to overpopulation, however the computers <b>automating</b> the colony ships malfunction, propelling the Terran colonists far off course to the edge of Protoss space. Out of contact with Earth, they form various factions to maintain their interests. Intrigued by the behavior and mentality of the Terrans, the Protoss remain hidden to examine the humans, while protecting them from other threats without their knowledge. The Zerg, however, target the Terrans for assimilation to harness their psionic potential, forcing the Protoss to destroy tainted Terran colonies to contain the Zerg infestation.|$|E

According to the surveys, public attitudes were positive towards implementation of <b>automated</b> buses in urban areas. The most attractive benefit of <b>automated</b> buses would be lower bus fares because of no driver costs. About two thirds of people surveyed would consider taking <b>automated</b> buses if both <b>automated</b> and conventional buses were available on a route.

40|$|While {{accident}} {{data show that}} human error {{is the cause of}} most of the on-road accidents, the move towards assisting or replacing the human driver with an <b>automated</b> system is not a straightforward one.
