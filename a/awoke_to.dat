5|$|Manning {{became the}} target of {{bullying}} at the school {{because she was the}} only American and was viewed as effeminate. Manning had come out to two friends in Oklahoma as gay, but was not open about it at school in Wales. The students would imitate her accent, and apparently abandoned her once during a camping trip; her aunt told The Washington Post that Manning <b>awoke</b> <b>to</b> an empty camp site one morning, after everyone else had packed up their tents and left without her.|$|E
5|$|The last {{remaining}} {{forces from the}} now evacuated northern camp arrived in Malakand South at 8:30am on the 27th, coinciding {{with the arrival of}} more Pashtun reinforcements. In Nowshera, the 11th Bengal Lancers <b>awoke</b> <b>to</b> news describing the situation, and, together with the 38th Dogras, the 35th Sikhs, No.1 and No.7 British Mountain Batteries, they set off to relieve the besieged garrison. Meanwhile, at Malakand South, fresh Pashtun attacks were repulsed by elements of the 24th led by Climo, whose unit captured a Pashtun standard.|$|E

5|$|After {{resting on}} their arms through the night, the 21st <b>awoke</b> <b>to</b> light {{fighting}} in their front. Over {{the course of}} the morning, Union forces gradually shifted to the left, including the 21st, and it became apparent that the Union right flank had collapsed. Meanwhile, Lee's forces had joined Jackson's and were pressing the Union left flank with a massive and rapid assault. Pope's entire army was soon in retreat. Ferrero's brigade was moved by Brig. Gen. Reno to a position on Henry House Hill to cover the Union retreat along the Centreville Turnpike. The brigade, with the 21st in the center, successfully held off Confederate advances from 7 to , buying critical time for the Union army. Finally, under the cover of darkness, the brigade quietly retired across Bull Run. During this defeat for the Union army, the 21st suffered light casualties of seven wounded, or two percent.|$|E
5|$|The chaos {{continued}} as other royal guards were found and beaten; {{at least one}} more was killed and his head too appeared atop a pike. Finally, the fury of the attack subsided enough to permit some communication between the former French Guards, who formed the professional core of Lafayette's National Guard militia, and the royal gardes du corps. The units had a history of cooperation and a military sense of mutual respect, and Lafayette, who had been snatching a few hours of sleep in his exhaustion, <b>awoke</b> <b>to</b> make the most of it. To the relief of the royals, the two sets of soldiers were reconciled by his charismatic mediation and a tenuous peace was established within the palace.|$|E
5|$|The party aboard Alceste, having {{determined}} that the ship was in no immediate danger of sinking, decided to remain aboard overnight. However, at dawn they <b>awoke</b> <b>to</b> discover the ship surrounded by Dayak (or Malay) proas armed with swivel guns. The party escaped on the raft, only reaching the island ahead of the pursuing proas {{with the assistance of}} boats sent to meet them carrying armed Royal Marines. With the wreck vacated, the Dayaks began enthusiastically looting it and several proas approached the island, landing their crews on offshore rocks to both observe the British and store their salvage. Maxwell hastily organised defensive positions in case the Dayaks attacked the island, completing the stockade on the island's hill and preparing sharpened stakes and hundreds of improvised cartridges for the group's 30 muskets. Over the next few days the proas approached the island several times, but despite attempts by the British to communicate with them, never landed. Eventually, on 22 February, Maxwell took advantage of the divided Dayak positions to drive their observers off the rocks, with the intention of recapturing the wreck. This was initially successful, but the departing Dayaks set fire to Alceste, burning her to the waterline. The destruction of the frigate's upper works exposed her hold, and the next morning the stranded sailors were able to collect some supplies that had floated out.|$|E

25|$|A fort {{was first}} erected {{at the site}} by the Spanish between 1584 and 1591 during the Eighty Years' War. The able Spanish general Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma had {{captured}} Ypres and Veurne (Furnes). The fort was intended to block raiding parties of Dutch rebels coming from the port of Ostend. The successful Siege of Ostend removed the Dutch threat in 1604 and the fort fell into disuse. Spain <b>awoke</b> <b>to</b> the location's strategic importance during the Franco-Spanish War. In 1649 a new fort was constructed in the fork between the Yser River and the Ypres Canal.|$|E
25|$|Saladin had his guards {{supplied}} with link lights and had chalk and cinders strewed around his tent outside Masyaf—which he was besieging—to detect any footsteps by the Assassins. According to this version, one night Saladin's guards noticed a spark glowing {{down the hill}} of Masyaf and then vanishing among the Ayyubid tents. Presently, Saladin <b>awoke</b> <b>to</b> find a figure leaving the tent. He saw that the lamps were displaced and beside his bed laid hot scones of the shape peculiar to the Assassins with a note at the top pinned by a poisoned dagger. The note threatened {{that he would be}} killed if he didn't withdraw from his assault. Saladin gave a loud cry, exclaiming that Sinan himself was the figure that had left the tent.|$|E

25|$|Although {{most of the}} Jewish {{people during}} this period, {{especially}} the wealthy families, were {{to be found in}} Babylonia, the existence they led there, under the successive rulers of the Achaemenids, the Seleucids, the Parthians, and the Sassanians, was obscure and devoid of political influence. The poorest but most fervent of the exiles returned to Judah / the Land of Israel during the reign of the Achaemenids (c. 550–330 BCE). There, with the reconstructed Temple in Jerusalem as their center, they organized themselves into a community, animated by a remarkable religious ardor and a tenacious attachment to the Torah as the focus of its identity. As this little nucleus increased in numbers with the accession of recruits from various quarters, it <b>awoke</b> <b>to</b> a consciousness of itself, and strove once again for national independence and political enfranchisement and sovereignty.|$|E
25|$|After {{the meeting}} Sir William fitz Warin {{returned}} to Urquhart Castle accompanied his escort of men-at-arms. A few {{miles to the}} south of Inverness, Sir William was ambushed by a force led by Andrew Moray and Alexander Pilche. He was fortunate to escape with his life to the safety of the loch-side stronghold. Next day, Sir William <b>awoke</b> <b>to</b> find his castle besieged by Moray, who demanded its surrender. The Countess of Ross unexpectedly arrived on the scene with her retinue. The countess, whose husband was held by King Edward in the Tower of London, advised him to surrender. She did not move against Moray. Although her advice was ignored, her actions were later commended to the king by Sir William. Moray, with no heavy siege equipment available to him, tried to take the castle in a night attack and having failed, was forced to abandon siege. He left Sir William in possession of the castle to lick his wounds and send an account of this mêlee to his king.|$|E
25|$|On 25 April, Berthold lost a dogfight. He made an {{emergency}} landing after enemy bullets crippled his Fokker's engine. He took off again in Pfalz E.IV serial number 803/15. Its engine quit as he climbed to about 100 meters altitude, and he crashed. When his limp body was pulled from the wreckage, he was believed dead until he revived momentarily with a fit of cursing. After a passing faint, Berthold <b>awoke</b> <b>to</b> find himself blind. He begged bystanders to shoot him, then again swooned. He reawakened two days later in Kriegslazarett 7 (Military Hospital 7) in Saint Quentin, in a room next to a British observer he had downed. Besides a badly broken left leg, Berthold had suffered a broken nose and upper jaw, with attendant damage to his optic nerves. He was prescribed narcotic painkillers for chronic pain. At that time, German military doctors used three narcotics as remedies—opium, morphine, and codeine. Cocaine was used to counteract the somnolence of these three depressant drugs. Berthold's exact prescription is unknown.|$|E

25|$|On {{the morning}} of May 31, in a {{farmhouse}} on a hill just above the South Fork Dam, Elias Unger, president of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, <b>awoke</b> <b>to</b> the sight of Lake Conemaugh swollen after a night-long heavy rainfall. Unger ran outside in the still-pouring rain to assess the situation {{and saw that the}} water was nearly cresting the dam. He quickly assembled a group of men to save the face of the dam by trying to unclog the spillway; it was blocked by the broken fish trap and debris caused by the swollen waterline. Other men tried digging a ditch {{at the other end of}} the dam, on the western abutment which was lower than the dam crest. The idea was to let more water out of the lake to try to prevent overtopping of the crest, but without success. Most remained on top of the dam, some plowing earth to raise it, while others tried to pile mud and rock on the face to save the eroding wall.|$|E
25|$|Winyah {{was one of}} {{the best}} known {{landmarks}} of the vicinity of New Rochelle up until May 5, 1897, when the residence burned to the ground along with its many valuable contents. The mansion was purchased from Col. Richard Lathers by Col. C. H. Green, President of Columbia Construction and Navigation Company. He occupied it with his wife and four-year-old nephew, and three servants including a 'waitress', 'laundress' and cook. In the early morning hours the waitress <b>awoke</b> <b>to</b> the smell of smoke alerting the other occupants to flee the house. The cook ran into New Rochelle village to secure assistance. The Fire Department, with two engines, a horse cart, and a truck, responded, though the mansion was about one and a half miles from the center of town. When they arrived, however, their attempt to get water from a hydrant was unavailable due to pebbles stuck within it. Nearly 100 men came with fire apparatus, but without water they could do nothing to stop the flames. Green offered a reward if anyone could save two pictures from the gallery within the home however nothing could be saved and within two hours the entire structure was in ruins. The sixty-nine-foot tower in the front of the home collapsed into the center of the burning building and only two brick chimneys were left standing in the end.|$|E
