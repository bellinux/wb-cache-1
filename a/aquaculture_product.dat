This study quantified {{for the first time}} the effect of key factors on the reproduction of a tropical species of filamentous Ulva (Ulva sp. 3). The controlled timing of release of swarmers (motile reproductive bodies) was achieved when experiments were initiated in the early afternoon by exposing the thalli to a temperature shock (4 °C) for 10 min and subsequently placing them into autoclaved filtered seawater under a 12 h light: 12 h dark photoperiod at 25 °C. The release of swarmers then peaked two days after initiation. In contrast, segmentation, dehydration, salinity or time of initiation of experiments had no effect of any magnitude on reproduction. The released swarmers were predominantly biflagellate (95 %), negatively phototactic and germinated without complementary gametes. This indicates that Ulva sp. 3 has a simple asexual life history dominated by biflagellate zoids. © 2014 Carl et al...|$|E

40|$|Tiger shrimp {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{candidate}} species for export oriented aquaculture which dominates the seafood market in regions of European Union, Japan and USA. Carotenoid content in seafood has now become one of the important criteria in determining the quality of edible product.

In this context, green algae Enteromorpha intestinalis was selected as a source of natural pigment for inclusion in the diet of tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon. Astaxanthin being an important category of carotenoid pigment was monitored in shrimp muscle tissue during the feeding trial. Significant variation (p< 0. 05) was observed between the experimental groups as confirmed through ANOVA thus exhibiting higher astaxanthin content of shrimps (18. 70 Å} 4. 48 ppm) fed with E. intestinalis incorporated diet as compared to control (15. 80 Å} 2. 33 ppm).

Adult shrimp were either exposed to hypoxia (1 mg O 2 /L) for 6, 12, or 24 h followed by 1 -h reoxygenation, or exposed to hypoxia for 24 h followed by 1 - to 6 -h reoxygenation. In all cases, shrimp maintained at constant normoxia were used as controls. Spectrophotometric techniques were applied to analyze lactate concentration, superoxide radical (O 2 [dot above]-) production, lipid peroxidation (TBARS), and antioxidant capacity status in muscle, hepatopancreas, and gill samples. Results indicate differences among tissues, even under control conditions. O 2 [dot above]- production and TBARS levels were higher in hepatopancreas than in gill or muscle. No effect of exposure to hypoxia was found. However, reoxygenation following exposure to hypoxia was found to affect the oxidative metabolism of muscle and hepatopancreas from cultured shrimp.

However, there are {{significant differences in the}} industry's performance among and within these places, especially in terms of yield. These differences can be explained by different factor (land, labor, capital) endowments and by the fact that producers have generally been responsive to these conditions. In Taiwan and the Philippines, milkfish production is becoming less profitable over time. In both places, brackishwater pond producers of milkfish are caught in a cost-price squeeze as input costs have increased more rapidly than market prices. Indonesian producers also face market constraints because high regional transport costs often isolate them from major market centers. In response to declining profitability of milkfish, producers have been changing their production techniques and shifting to the culture of other species such as tilapia that currently have greater domestic or export market potential. Although total milkfish production continues to increase, in the Philippines and Indonesia at least, milkfish's traditional share of total aquaculture production in all these places has declined quite dramatically over the last 10 years, and this trend is likely to continue...|$|E
