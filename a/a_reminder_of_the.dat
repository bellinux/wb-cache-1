5|$|The EPB {{was founded}} by Filiberto Ojeda Ríos, Juan Enrique Segarra-Palmer and Orlando González Claudio on July 26, 1976, with the date being symbolically used as <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States {{invasion}} during the Spanish–American War. It can trace its origins back to the Armed Forces of National Liberation (FALN).|$|E
5|$|Between 1873 and 1875, mineowners Fletcher Burrows built a small {{model village}} at Howe Bridge, {{comprising}} cottages, shops, a village club, and a bath house for their employees. This Victorian village {{on either side}} of Leigh Road, together with St Michael and All Angel's Church, is a conservation area. The Ena Mill, one of Atherton's large spinning mills, complete with chimney, survives as <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> textile industry.|$|E
5|$|In {{the post-war}} era, {{the park was}} long known chiefly for its {{isolated}} location and primitive camping facilities. In August 1952it played host to the first Woodsmen's Carnival, an annual celebration of the lumbering industry, which was again active in the second growth forests in the area. The festival, originally sponsored by the Penn-York Lumbermen's Club, features lumberjack competitions as <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past, as well as displays of new equipment. In 1987the Galeton Rotary Club took over sponsorship, and renamed the event the Woodsmen's Show in 1990.|$|E

5|$|Shapinsay {{is one of}} the Orkney Islands off {{the north}} coast of {{mainland}} Scotland. There is one village on the island, Balfour, from which roll-on/roll-off car ferries sail to Kirkwall on the Orkney Mainland. Balfour Castle, built in the Scottish Baronial style, {{is one of the}} island's most prominent features, <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Balfour family's domination of Shapinsay during the 18th and 19th centuries; the Balfours transformed life on the island by introducing new agricultural techniques. Other landmarks include a standing stone, an Iron Age broch, a souterrain and a salt-water shower.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it is hard}} to {{test the}} hearing of sharks, they may have a sharp sense of hearing and can {{possibly}} hear prey from many miles away. A small opening on each side of their heads (not the spiracle) leads directly into the inner ear through a thin channel. The lateral line shows a similar arrangement, and is open to the environment via a series of openings called lateral line pores. This is <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> common origin of these two vibration- and sound-detecting organs that are grouped together as the acoustico-lateralis system. In bony fish and tetrapods the external opening into the inner ear has been lost.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from being}} an {{obligatory}} religious duty, the Hajj is seen to have a spiritual merit that provides the Muslims with an opportunity of self-renewal. Hajj serves as <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Day of Judgment when Muslims believe people will stand before God. Hadith literature (sayings of Muhammad) articulates various merits a pilgrim achieves upon successful completion of their Hajj. After successful pilgrimage, pilgrims can prefix their names with the title 'Al-Hajji', and are held with respect in Muslim society. However, Islamic scholars suggest Hajj should signify a Muslim's religious commitment, {{and should not be}} a measurement of their social status. Hajj brings together and unites the Muslims from {{different parts of the world}} irrespective of their race, colour, and culture, which acts as a symbol of equality.|$|E
30|$|The {{intervention}} {{column is}} filled in with descriptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> task {{that the system}} asks the user to perform. As a descriptive column, it serves as <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> what <b>the</b> names <b>of</b> <b>the</b> systems mean, {{but it is the}} systems, in their entireties, that support the relationship between the body and spatial cognition. This relationship is fully encompassed by <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system. <b>The</b> descriptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interventions are primarily <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> how <b>the</b> systems support that relationship.|$|R
50|$|From January 2011, the new EUROPA logo, {{preceded by}} <b>a</b> {{symbolic}} <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mailbox, applies, and a Jury Prize Competition is designed by seven philatelic experts.|$|R
50|$|Devanahalli fort, {{spread over}} {{an area of}} 20 acres that {{includes}} twelve bastions is <b>a</b> magnificent <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> power that the ruling dynasties held since the 15th century.|$|R
5|$|Engine {{anti-ice}} {{was turned}} {{on for the}} two engines during taxi. The captain announced to passengers that the flaps would remain up during taxi, and {{they should not be}} worried seeing them in the retracted position. He placed an empty coffee cup on the flap handle as <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> position of the flaps, a procedure used by many flight crews. The captain told the first officer they would use standard USAir contaminated runway procedures that included the use of 18 degrees flaps, and also decided that they would take off with a reduced V1 speed of 110 knots.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Sunderland {{moved to}} their present ground, Stadium of Light in Monkwearmouth, which was opened by Prince Andrew, Duke of York. Built with an {{original}} capacity of 42,000, it hosted its first game against Dutch team Ajax. The stadium bears a similar {{name to the}} Portuguese club Benfica's ground Estádio da Luz, albeit in a different language. Stadium expansion in 2000 saw the capacity increase to 49,000. A Davy lamp monument stands outside the stadium, and a miners banner {{was presented to the}} club by the Durham Miners' Association, as <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Monkwearmouth Colliery pit the stadium was built on.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the burial}} was first {{reported}} in the press, there had been doubts as to its veracity and scope, leading to it being frequently dismissed as an urban legend. In either case the event had become a cultural icon and <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North American video game crash of 1983; {{it was the end}} result of a disastrous fiscal year which saw Atari, Inc. sold off by its parent company Warner Communications. Though it was believed that millions of copies of E.T. were disposed of in the landfill, Atari officials later verified the numbers to be around 700,000 cartridges of various titles, including E.T.|$|E

5|$|Stretford Urban District {{became the}} Municipal Borough of Stretford in 1933, giving it borough {{status in the}} United Kingdom. Stretford Borough Council was granted its arms on 20 February 1933. The roses are the red roses of Lancashire, and the lion in the centre {{represents}} John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster. Above the lion are a crossed flail and scythe; the flail comes from {{the arms of the}} de Trafford family; the scythe is <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> agricultural history of the area; the thunderbolts above represent the importance of electricity in Stretford's industrial development. The boat at the bottom represents Stretford's links to the sea via the Manchester Ship Canal.|$|E
5|$|Before her stasis {{aboard the}} Spear of Adun, Rohana was a driven protoss {{who was not}} afraid to seek out tasks others thought impossible. She {{displayed}} strict adherence to tradition, yet was creative {{when faced with the}} issues. After she was awakened, Rohana held on to the old ways of the Protoss Empire, openly speaking out against her Nerazim crew, Artanis' Terran allies, and the reawakening of the Purifiers. She served as <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past, clinging to old traditions and ways, and refusing to cut her connection from the Khala even as Amon continued to possess her, stating knowledge and history {{was the only thing that}} brought unity to the protoss. Though Artanis valued her memories and her ability to see into Amon's thoughts, he began to grow weary of her adherence to the old ways and her objections to his choices, becoming more of a critic than a councilor. Eventually, she came to terms with the Daelaam, and cut herself from the Khala, stating that perhaps history did not need to be recorded with perfect clarity.|$|E

25|$|<b>A</b> long-standing <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ethnic {{past was}} the former St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church, which was {{destroyed}} in the September 11 attacks. An additional historic church, St. George's Syrian Catholic Church, still stands at 103 Washington Street.|$|R
