5|$|The game {{features}} an artificial intelligence system by which hostile human enemies react to combat. If enemies discover the player, they may take cover or call for assistance, <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> advantage of players {{when they are}} distracted, out of ammunition, or in a fight. Player companions, such as Ellie, can assist in combat by throwing objects at threats to stun them, announcing the location of unseen enemies, or using a knife and pistol to attack enemies.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to following the main storyline, the player character will witness <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> part in random events they encounter as they explore the game world. These include public hangings, ambushes, pleas for assistance, encounters with strangers, ride-by shootings, and dangerous animal attacks. For example, if {{a group of}} people ride into town firing guns in the air, Marston can kill them, and will receive a bonus of honor and fame for protecting the town. The player character can also take part in optional side activities, most of which give the player money. These side activities include dueling, in which the player character must be a faster draw than their opponent; bounty hunting, where Marston can hunt down bounties on wanted posters; herb collecting, which involves gathering exotic plants from around the game map for town medics; gambling, where people can be found playing games such as poker and Five Finger Fillet; and hunting, in which the player can kill wild animals and skin their hides.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} extreme {{examples}} of colonial behavior in rodents are the eusocial naked mole rat and Damaraland mole rat. The naked mole rat lives completely underground and can form colonies of up to 80 individuals. Only one female and up to three males in the colony reproduce, {{while the rest of}} the members are smaller and sterile, and function as workers. Some individuals are of intermediate size. They help with the rearing of the young <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> the place of a reproductive if one dies. The Damaraland mole rat is characterized by having a single reproductively active male and female in a colony where the remaining animals are not truly sterile, but become fertile only if they establish a colony of their own.|$|E
5|$|On Valentine's Day, Liz {{goes to her}} dentist {{appointment}} and tells the receptionist {{that she did not}} sign the waiver. After her surgery, Liz reassures the dental staff that the anesthesia is having no effect on her <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> herself home. In the lobby, Liz sees her former boyfriends Drew Baird (Jon Hamm), Dennis Duffy (Dean Winters), and Floyd DeBarber (Jason Sudeikis), and is moved that they came back so that she not be alone on Valentine's Day. Liz is hallucinating, however, and the people she sees as Drew, Dennis, and Floyd are actually the three Jamaican women who are dental assistants at the oral surgeon's office. One of them calls Jack, Liz's boss, asking if he could come pick up Liz and take her home. Jack had just spent the night with Avery, who thinks that the phone call was made up by Jack as an excuse to end the date, but when he invites her to come along, she is impressed by his kindness to Liz.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the effects listed above, use of high-dose steroids {{for more than a}} week begins to produce suppression of the patient's adrenal glands because the exogenous glucocorticoids suppress hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone and pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone. With prolonged suppression, the adrenal glands atrophy (physically shrink), <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> months to recover full function after discontinuation of the exogenous glucocorticoid.|$|E
25|$|A typical {{clinical}} trial goes through multiple phases <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> {{up to eight}} years. Clinical endpoints or outcomes are used {{to determine whether the}} therapy is safe and effective. Once a patient reaches the endpoint, he or she is generally excluded from further experimental interaction. Trials that rely solely on clinical endpoints are very costly as they have long durations and tend to need large numbers of patients.|$|E

25|$|Unisexuality {{occurs when}} a species is all-male or all-female. Unisexuality occurs in some fish species, <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> complex forms. Squalius alburnoides, a minnow found in several river basins in Portugal and Spain, {{appears to be an}} all-male species. The {{existence}} of this species illustrates the potential complexity of mating systems in fish. The species originated as a hybrid between two species, and is diploid, but not hermaphroditic. It can have triploid and tetraploid forms, including all-female forms that reproduce mainly through hybridogenesis.|$|E

These then form into islands of ordered SAMs, where they grow into phase 3, as seen below.|$|E

25|$|Yeast {{is added}} to the wort in a large vessel (often tens of {{thousands}} of litres) called a washback. Washbacks are commonly made of Oregon Pine or stainless steel. The yeast feeds on the sugars, and as a by-product, produces both carbon dioxide and alcohol. This process is called fermentation <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> up to three days to complete. When complete, the liquid has an alcohol content of 5 to 7% by volume, and is now known as wash. Up until this point the process has been quite similar to the production of beer.|$|E
25|$|The {{trees are}} made from clay fired in gas ovens at a low temperature. Most trees are from between 26 to 60cm in height <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> {{anywhere}} from two weeks to three months to create. Extremely large pieces {{can take up to}} three years. These trees vary in size from miniatures to gigantic public sculptures. Many trees have unique themes but the most common is the duality of life and death and the relationship of man with the natural world. Most trees are created and sold by artisans who have learned how to make them from their parents and grandparents.|$|E
