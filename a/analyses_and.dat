5|$|With the {{description}} of Skorpiovenator in 2008, Canale et al. published another phylogenetic analysis focusing on the South American abelisaurids. In their results, they found that all South American forms, including Ilokelesia (except Abelisaurus), grouped together as a sub-clade of carnotaurines, which they named Brachyrostra. In the same year Matthew T. Carrano and Scott D. Sampson published new large phylogenetic analysis of ceratosaurian. With {{the description}} of Eoabelisaurus, Diego Pol and Oliver W. M. Rauhut (2012) combined these <b>analyses</b> <b>and</b> added ten new characters. The following cladogram follows their analysis.|$|E
5|$|A {{criticism}} {{of this method}} {{is that it can}} be statistically weak. Schaefer in particular has questioned how robust the claimed alignments in the Caracol are. Because of the wide variety of evidence, which can include artefacts as well as sites, there is no one way to practice archaeoastronomy. Despite this it is accepted that archaeoastronomy is not a discipline that sits in isolation. Because archaeoastronomy is an interdisciplinary field, whatever is being investigated should make sense both archaeologically and astronomically. Studies {{are more likely to be}} considered sound if they use theoretical tools found in archaeology like analogy and homology and if they can demonstrate an understanding of accuracy and precision found in astronomy. Both quantitative <b>analyses</b> <b>and</b> interpretations based on ethnographic analogies and other contextual evidence have recently been applied in systematic studies of architectural orientations in the Maya area and in other parts of Mesoamerica.|$|E
5|$|The ENA {{operates}} {{an instance}} of the Sequence Read Archive (SRA), an archival repository of sequence reads and analyses which are intended for public release.

Currently, the archive accepts sequence reads generated by next-generation sequencing platforms such as the Illumina Genome Analyzer and ABI SOLiD {{as well as some}} corresponding <b>analyses</b> <b>and</b> alignments. The SRA operates under the guidance of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) and is the fastest-growing repository in the ENA.|$|E

5|$|The JMP Scripting Language (JSL) is an {{interpreted}} {{language for}} recreating analytic results and for automating or extending the functionality of JMP software. JSL {{was first introduced}} in JMP version 4 in 2000. JSL has a LISP-like syntax, structured {{as a series of}} expressions. All programming elements, including if-then statements and loops, are implemented as JSL functions. Data tables, display elements and analyses are represented by objects in JSL that are manipulated with named messages. Users may write JSL scripts to perform <b>analyses</b> <b>and</b> visualizations not available in the point-and-click interface or to automate a series of commands, such as weekly reports. SAS, R, and Matlab code can also be executed using JSL.|$|E

Several books have resulted from the project, among them Sites of Gender: Women, Men and Modernity, 1890–1939, edited by B. Brookes, A. Cooper, and R.
