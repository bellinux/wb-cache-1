5|$|On January 1, 1994, Clinton {{signed the}} North American Free Trade Agreement into law. Throughout {{his first year}} in office, Clinton {{consistently}} supported ratification of the treaty by the U.S. Senate. Clinton and most of his allies in the Democratic Leadership Committee strongly supported free trade measures; there remained, however, strong disagreement within the party. Opposition came chiefly from <b>anti-trade</b> Republicans, protectionist Democrats and supporters of Ross Perot. The bill passed the house with 234 votes against 200 opposed (132 Republicans and 102 Democrats voting in favor; 156 Democrats, 43 Republicans, and 1 independent against). The treaty was then ratified by the Senate and signed into law by the president.|$|E
25|$|Qing China {{followed}} a Confucian-Modernist economic philosophy {{that called for}} strict government intervention in industry {{for the sake of}} preserving societal stability. While the Qing state was not explicitly <b>anti-trade,</b> a perceived lack of need for imports limited pressure on the government to open further ports to international trade. Qing China's rigid merchant hierarchy also blocked efforts to open ports to foreign ships and businesses. Chinese merchants away from the coast wanted to avoid market fluctuations caused by importing foreign goods that would compete with domestic production, while the Hong houses of Canton profited greatly by keeping their city the only entry point for foreign products. The Cohong was made up of between (depending on the politics of Canton) 6 to 10 merchant families. Most of the houses had been established by low-ranking mandarins, but several were Cantonese or Han in origin.|$|E
25|$|Though a High Court judge {{eventually}} {{ruled in}} favour of McDonald's on some counts, John Vidal called it a Pyrrhic victory. The extended legal battle was a PR disaster, with {{every aspect of the}} company's working practices being scrutinised and the media presenting the case as a David and Goliath battle. Additionally, the damages received were negligible compared to the company's estimated £10 million legal costs because the court ruled {{in favour of}} a number of the defendants' claims, including that McDonald's exploited children in its advertising, was <b>anti-trade</b> union and indirectly exploited and caused suffering to animals. McDonald's was awarded £60,000 damages, which was later reduced to £40,000 by the Court of Appeal. Steel and Morris announced they had no intention of ever paying, and the company later confirmed it would not be pursuing the money. Steel and Morris went on to challenge UK libel laws in the European Court of Human Rights, claiming that the lack of access to legal aid and the heavy burden of proof that lay with them, as the defendants' requirement to prove their claims under UK law was a breach of the right to a fair trial and freedom of expression. The court ruled in their favour and the UK Government was forced to introduce legislation to change defamation laws.|$|E
25|$|The {{climate of}} Kilimanjaro is {{influenced}} by the height of the mountain, which allows the simultaneous influence of the equatorial trade winds and the high altitude <b>anti-trades,</b> and the isolated position of the mountain. Kilimanjaro has daily upslope and nightly downslope winds, a regimen stronger on the southern than the northern side of the mountain. The flatter southern flanks are more extended and affect the atmosphere more strongly.|$|R

500|$|... c.Mazowiecki and Balcerowicz had {{a vastly}} greater freedom of {{economic}} action than their predecessors, because neither Gierek nor Jaruzelski could consider triggering high unemployment (it {{would violate the}} symbolic legitimation of workers as the ruling class). The Western economies responded to crisis situations from the 1970s onward by utilizing the existing free market flexibilities (deregulation, downsizing, <b>anti-trade</b> union legislation, moving cheap manufacturing to the Third World countries etc.) ever more liberally under the newly dominant neoliberal policies. Such remedies were not available before 1989 for the ruling establishments in Central and Eastern Europe.|$|E
2500|$|A day later, on June 25, 2013, Glenn [...] "Doc" [...] Rivers, {{a former}} Clippers player {{best known for}} his nine-year tenure as the head coach of the Boston Celtics, was {{announced}} as Del Negro's replacement. As compensation for Boston allowing Rivers to leave his contract with the Celtics and join the Clippers, Los Angeles traded two future first-round draft picks, in addition to an <b>anti-trade</b> clause preventing the Clippers and Celtics from engaging in further transactions amongst each other, including the exchanging of players, {{for the duration of the}} 2013–14 season.|$|E
2500|$|In 1969, the Labour {{government}} {{came into}} conflict with the trade unions over its In Place of Strife white paper which was later withdrawn. Militant's national secretary Taaffe outlined how [...] "the trade union and Labour Movement scored a tremendous victory in forcing the Labour government to climb down over its proposed <b>anti-trade</b> union legislation" [...] in {{the first issue of}} the Militant International Review (Autumn 1969), Militant's quarterly theoretical journal. Several strikes had taken place, the [...] "first directly political strikes" [...] in what threatened to be an [...] "irreparable breach between the Labour leaders and their base in the Labour Movement".|$|E
500|$|The westerlies, <b>anti-trades,</b> or {{prevailing}} westerlies, are [...] prevailing winds {{from the}} west toward the east in the middle latitudes between 30 and 60 degrees latitude. They originate from the high-pressure areas in the horse latitudes and tend towards the poles and steer extratropical cyclones in this general manner. Tropical cyclones which cross the subtropical ridge axis into the westerlies recurve due to the increased westerly flow. The winds are predominantly from the southwest in the Northern Hemisphere and from the northwest in the Southern Hemisphere.|$|R
5000|$|Willi Bleicher {{remained}} a consistent advocate of trades union unity. This, for him, {{was one of}} the most important lessons from Germany's recently catastrophic history. The Communist Party's <b>anti-trades</b> union policies must accordingly have played a decisive role in triggering his (second) resignation from it in April 1950, even though it was not till the [...] "Munich Party Conference" [...] (actually, and confusingly, held in Weimar in East Germany) of March 1951 that the Communist Party in West Germany (heavily influence by the Soviet backed [...] "communists" [...] in East Germany) were savagely attacked in the grotesque [...] "Thesis 37", accused of running their organisation [...] "at the direction and in the interests of American imperialism and in collusion with German monopolists ... in service to preparation for the next war". In the end the IG Metall union executive reacted very forcefully to the clear threat of factionalism inside the union generated by Communist Party actions. In May 1951 all union officers who were Communist Party members were invited to conform to a declaration of commitment to distance themselves from [...] "Thesis 37". The age of [...] "coat-tail politics" [...] with respect to Soviet directed communism, which had been well entrenched, remained present in IG Metall till the end of 1955, by which time almost all the communist union officials had either removed themselves from the party or else lost their positions in the union.|$|R
2500|$|As it {{was founded}} by the unions to {{represent}} the interests of working-class people, Labour's link with the unions {{has always been a}} defining characteristic of the party. In recent years this link has come under increasing strain, with the RMT being expelled from the party in 2004 for allowing its branches in Scotland to affiliate to the left-wing Scottish Socialist Party. Other unions have also faced calls from members to reduce financial support for the Party and seek more effective political representation for their views on privatisation, public spending cuts and the <b>anti-trade</b> union laws. Unison and GMB have both threatened to withdraw funding from constituency MPs and Dave Prentis of UNISON has warned that the union will write [...] "no more blank cheques" [...] and is dissatisfied with [...] "feeding the hand that bites us". Union funding was redesigned in 2013 after the Falkirk candidate-selection controversy. The Fire Brigades Union, which [...] "severed links" [...] with Labour in 2004, re-joined the party under Corbyn's leadership in 2015.|$|E
60|$|How {{does this}} {{apparently}} anomalous state of things come about? If we suppose {{the globe to}} be covered with a universal ocean, it can hardly be doubted that the cold of the regions towards the poles must tend to cause the superficial water of those regions to contract and become specifically heavier. Under these circumstances, it would have {{no alternative but to}} descend and spread over the sea bottom, while its place would be taken by warmer water drawn from the adjacent regions. Thus, deep, cold, polar-equatorial currents, and superficial, warmer, equatorial-polar currents, would be set up; and as the former would have a less velocity of rotation from west to east than the regions towards which they travel, they would not be due southerly or northerly currents, but south-westerly in the northern hemisphere, and north-westerly in the southern; while, by a parity of reasoning, the equatorial-polar warm currents would be north-easterly in the northern hemisphere, and south- easterly in the southern. Hence, as a north-easterly current has the same direction as a south-westerly wind, the direction of the northern equatorial-polar current in the extra-tropical part of its course would pretty nearly coincide with that of the <b>anti-trade</b> winds. The freezing of the surface of the polar sea would not interfere with the movement thus set up. For, however bad a conductor of heat ice may be, the unfrozen sea-water immediately in contact with the undersurface of the ice must needs be colder than that further off; and hence will constantly tend to descend through the subjacent warmer water.|$|E

[...] Ross has {{also said that the}} government [...] "should provide access to our markets to those countries who play fair, play by the rules and give everybody a fair chance to compete. Those who do not should not get away with it -they should be punished." [...] Initially in favor of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Ross has said that after examining the agreement, he found it was [...] "not consistent with what was advertised." ...|$|E

50|$|Major critiques in {{the feminist}} {{presence}} of global politics {{have not received}} as much attention in the media, due to more attention being given to the arguments of environmentalists and labor issues at <b>anti-trade</b> rallies, {{as opposed to those}} of feminist ideologies. However, some places were found to be very ambivalent towards anti-globalization, an example being women in India who weren't concerned with the demands that linked trade liberalization with the enforcement of work standards.|$|E
