6000|$|... "Tut, tut, child, you do {{not know}} what you are talking <b>about!</b> <b>Your</b> <b>mother</b> has given me her word, and you ought to bow to the inevitable." ...|$|E
6000|$|REV. S. Frank: Mrs Warren and her {{daughter}} are coming across the heath with Crofts: I saw them from the study windows. What am I to say <b>about</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother?</b> ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, I don't {{really believe}} you," [...] said the man, with an angry frown; [...] "but I'll soon {{find out if}} you're telling lies. I'll go to the {{hospital}} and inquire for myself. D'ee know anything <b>about</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> affairs?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do care <b>about</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> money going," [...] he said, {{when she}} was seated again and sewing quickly. [...] "I wanted to ask you, Mary--don't you think that Mr. Featherstone--if you were to tell him--tell him, I mean, about apprenticing Alfred--would advance the money?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And drag us {{all through}} the mire? Surely, my son, {{whatever}} you feel <b>about</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> and sister, you can't wish your poor father to suffer anything more on that wretch's account?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lie back quite comfortably, and don't worry," [...] said Jane Hubbard. [...] "I'm {{going to}} my room to get a book to read you to sleep. I shan't be five minutes. And forget <b>about</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother.</b> I'll look after her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You've told {{me stories}} about grand-dukes and lion-tamers and financiers' widows and a {{postmaster}} in Herzegovina," [...] said the Baroness, [...] "and about an Italian jockey and an amateur governess {{who went to}} Warsaw, and several <b>about</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother,</b> but certainly never anything about a saint." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes indeed," [...] Strether {{answered}} for her, [...] "Mrs. Pocock knows <b>about</b> Miss Gostrey. <b>Your</b> <b>mother,</b> Sarah, {{must have}} told you <b>about</b> her; <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> knows everything," [...] he sturdily pursued. [...] "And I cordially admit," [...] he added with his conscious gaiety of courage, [...] "that she's as wonderful a woman as you like." ...|$|R
50|$|Nearly {{a decade}} ago Agent Kate Drew left home to {{neutralize}} a biochemical weapon in Scotland. While her assignment was a success, Kate {{died in a car}} accident. Or so we were told. Now the echoes of a similar plot reverberate and it's up to you, as detective Nancy Drew, to thwart the sleeper cell and expose the truth <b>about</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> tragic demise.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Sidney Wilton was {{speaking}} to me very much the other day <b>about</b> <b>your</b> royal <b>mother,</b> sir, Queen Agrippina. She must have been fascinating." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Cynthia," [...] said Miss Lucretia, [...] "I have {{a meeting}} now of a girls' charity to which I must go, but you will come {{to me at the}} offices of the Woman's Hour to-morrow morning at ten. I wish to talk to you <b>about</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> and yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh I've {{been having}} that out with him," [...] said Mrs. Beale. [...] "He'll behave well enough. You {{see the great}} {{difficulty}} is that, though he changes every three days about {{everything else in the}} world, he has never changed <b>about</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother.</b> It's a caution, the way he hates her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear!" [...] said Cartwright. [...] "Perhaps my remark was unlucky, but the cleverest {{of us is}} {{sometimes}} cheated, and you were not cheated long. We'll let it go. I'm bothered <b>about</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother.</b> She feels the damp and cold and is not picking up. Perhaps we ought to send her South. I must talk to the doctor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But do {{you know}} {{absolutely}} nothing <b>about</b> him--did <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> never mention him to you? How do you come to know that Joseph Harrod was not your father?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Old is {{the tree}} and the fruit good, [...] Very old and thick the wood. [...] Woodman, is your courage stout? [...] Beware! the root is wrapped <b>about</b> [...] <b>Your</b> <b>mother's</b> heart, <b>your</b> father's bones; [...] And like the {{mandrake}} comes with groans.|$|R
500|$|The {{gang member}} likes insignias that are {{prominent}} on sweaters and their creator. Among the 28 stories, other notable tales include {{one about the}} influence of Madonna (with discourse including [...] "Any American woman under 40 who says she's never dressed as Madonna is either lying or Amish."); one about dressing room anxiety (a story revolving around the concept that [...] "I'm an 8. I've always been an 8"); and one <b>about</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> tastes in clothes ("I don't understand, you could look so good if you tried"). [...] Three of the characters sometimes work as a trio and all characters have monologues.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, indeed. As to Felix I {{think that}} Lady Carbury {{has done the}} best thing in her power. No doubt she has been advised by Mr Broune, and Mr Broune {{seems to be a}} prudent man. And <b>about</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> herself, I hope that she may now be comfortable. But I was not {{alluding}} to Felix and your mother. I was thinking of you--and of myself.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are to {{come here}} {{as often as you}} like," [...] he told her. [...] "When a young lady and I make a compact of {{friendship}} I am going to live up to it. But you are not to talk to me <b>about</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother.</b> Remember, we are friends because I am I and you are you, and there is no question of anybody else." ...|$|E
6000|$|The doctor {{rose and}} took up his hat; then he {{suddenly}} turned toward Miss Drane and said, [...] "La Fleur, our cook, came {{to speak to me}} this morning <b>about</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother.</b> She says she thinks that you are not well lodged; that the street is in the hottest part of the town, and that Mrs. Drane's health will suffer if you stay there. Does your mother object to your present quarters?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Capt. G. (Aside.) Well! I {{wonder what}} she'll say next. I've never known a woman {{treat me like}} this before. I might b--Dash it, I might be an Infantry subaltern! (Aloud.) Oh, please don't trouble. I'm not worth {{thinking}} <b>about.</b> Isn't <b>your</b> <b>Mother</b> ready yet? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Philip, I {{have been}} hearing all <b>about</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> life, {{as well as that}} of your uncle and aunt. Now let us hear <b>about</b> <b>your</b> own, which must needs differ widely from that to which Francois has been accustomed. Your aunt says that your English schools differ {{altogether}} from ours. With us our sons are generally brought up at home, and are instructed by the chaplain, in Huguenot families; or by the priest in Catholic families; or else they go to religious seminaries, where they are taught what is necessary of books and Latin, being under strict supervision, and learning all other matters such as the use of arms after leaving school, or when at home with their families." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; there's our own correspondent," [...] Warrington said. [...] "Every man has his secrets, look you. Before {{you told}} me the story of your money-matters, I had no idea but {{that you were a}} gentleman of fortune, for, with your confounded airs and appearance, anybody would suppose you to be so. From what you tell me <b>about</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> income, it is clear that you must not lay any more hands on it. You can't go on spunging upon the women. You must pay off that trump of a girl. Laura is her name?--here is your health, Laura!--and carry a hod rather than ask for a {{shilling}} from home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And a brother?--no matter, he is a man. But a sister?' Her head drooped a quavering 'Yes.' 'Younger? Very much?' 'Seven years.' 'And {{you have}} thought well about this matter? About them? <b>About</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother?</b> And your sister? She {{stands on the}} {{threshold}} of her woman's life, and this wildness of yours may mean much to her. Could you go before her, look upon her fresh young face, hold her hand in yours, or touch your cheek to hers?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. No, I can't do it now. It {{would be}} ridiculous." [...] She was silent, and {{presently}} she asked, [...] "Is {{there anything else}} <b>about</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> that I ought to know?" [...] She {{looked at him with}} a sort of impending discipline in her eyes which he had learned to dread; it meant such a long course of things, such a very great variety of atonement and expiation for him, that he could not bring himself to confront it steadily.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{looked at}} that garden," [...] Euphrasia went on, [...] "and cried out. I didn't callate she was like that. And the first thing I knew I was talking <b>about</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother,</b> and I'd forgot who I was talking to. She wahn't like a stranger--it was just as if I'd known her always. I haven't {{understood}} it yet. And after a while I told her about that verse, {{and she wanted to}} see it--the verse about the skylark, you know--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes. You {{will find}} it {{pleasant}} enough, by and bye. I am the ship's doctor. The purser has been telling me <b>about</b> you and <b>your</b> <b>mother.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} on well, Ned; {{at least so}} the doctors say. I feel I shall be but a {{battered}} old hulk when I get <b>about</b> again; but <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> will not mind that, I know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't {{know about}} promising," [...] said Dan, {{laughing}} {{a little more}} uneasily, but still laughing. [...] "As nearly as I can remember, I wasn't consulted <b>about</b> the matter. <b>Your</b> <b>mother</b> proposed one thing, and my mother proposed another." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Waboose," [...] said I, {{during the}} {{conversation}} above referred to, [...] "you {{need not be}} anxious <b>about</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother.</b> I feel assured that her complaint is of such a nature that her general health will be benefited by a trip over the snow--provided she is kept warm and does not travel too far each day. Of course there is no fear of that, with you and Miss Macnab to look after her, and I have given careful directions to Mr Macnab how to treat her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "From {{what he told}} me," [...] his vis-a-vis continued, handing again his cigarette-case, {{and looking}} {{steadily}} into the fire, [...] "he seems to have left England with the secret determination never to return. But why I do not know. One thing is certain. His mental state was not altogether healthy. His desire for solitude was almost a passion. Towards the end, however, his mind was clear enough. He told me <b>about</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> and you, and he handed me all the papers, which I subsequently sent to London. He spoke of no trouble, and his transition was quite peaceful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The same! You do not {{suppose that}} Ned pays me compliments. He never {{did such a}} thing in his life. No: I first {{discovered}} his talent in that direction at Palermo, where I surprised him in an animated discourse with the dark-eyed daughter of an innkeeper there. That was the first conversation in Italian I succeeded in following. A week later I could understand the language almost as well as he. However, dont let us waste the whole afternoon talking stuff. I {{want to ask you}} <b>about</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother.</b> I should greatly like to call upon her; but she has never made me any sign since my marriage; and Mrs. Leith Fairfax tells me that she never allows my name to be mentioned to her. I thought she was fond of me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, {{a perfect}} stranger, {{if you think}} of it. What do any of you know <b>about</b> me? <b>Your</b> <b>mother</b> never saw my mother; your father knew nothing of my father; there is no kindred blood common to us. Harry Norman, there, is your near cousin; but what am I that I should be thus allowed to live with you, and walk with you, and have a common {{interest}} in all your doings?' ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2005, Kang {{released}} his fifth album, Who Gives a Damn <b>About</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Mother's</b> Marriage (管你媽媽嫁給誰). It did poorly in both commercial sales and critical acclaim. In the same year, Kang hit bottom low with his TV career, {{as he was}} kicked off from Zhang Fei's show [...] "Big Brother in Showbizz" [...] (綜藝大哥大) due to creative differences. Even though he had the most TV offers in the same year, his popularity declined due to negative tabloid exposure. Critics often panned him as [...] "egotistically self-minded, a language abuser, and arrogant as a mule". Worse still {{is that he was}} often spotted in pubs and other adult-oriented places by paparazzi. He was also hampered by the media as a playboy, often hailing his own sexual prowess and innuendos in public. Kang responded with the remark that his behaviour was only {{for the sake of the}} show.|$|R
6000|$|... "Off Durban. But {{this whole}} sheet {{about it is}} marked 'Private--only for Julius,' so I could say nothing <b>about</b> it before <b>your</b> <b>mother.</b> I have hardly glanced at it myself as yet, but I think he says Mr. Douglas made him promise not to tell her or Joanna Bowater." ...|$|R
