5000|$|An <b>angular</b> <b>contact</b> {{ball bearing}} uses axially {{asymmetric}} races. An axial load passes {{in a straight}} line through the bearing, whereas a radial load takes an oblique path that tends to want to separate the races axially. So the angle of contact on the inner race is the same as that on the outer race. <b>Angular</b> <b>contact</b> bearings better support [...] "combined loads" [...] (loading in both the radial and axial directions) and the contact angle of the bearing should be matched to the relative proportions of each. The larger the contact angle (typically in the range 10 to 45 degrees), the higher the axial load supported, but the lower the radial load. In high speed applications, such as turbines, jet engines, and dentistry equipment, the centrifugal forces generated by the balls changes the contact angle at the inner and outer race. Ceramics such as silicon nitride are now regularly used in such applications due to their low density (40% of steel). These materials significantly reduce centrifugal force and function well in high temperature environments. They also tend to wear in a similar way to bearing steel—rather than cracking or shattering like glass or porcelain.|$|E

50|$|All {{parts of}} a bearing are subject to many design constraints. For example, {{the inner and outer}} races are often complex shapes, making them {{difficult}} to manufacture. Balls and rollers, though simpler in shape, are small; since they bend sharply where they run on the races, the bearings are prone to fatigue. The loads within a bearing assembly are also affected by the speed of operation: rolling-element bearings may spin over 100,000 rpm, and the principal load in such a bearing may be momentum rather than the applied load. Smaller rolling elements are lighter and thus have less momentum, but smaller elements also bend more sharply where they contact the race, causing them to fail more rapidly from fatigue. Maximum rolling-element bearing speeds are often specified in 'nDm', which is the product of the mean diameter (in mm) and the maximum RPM.

40|$|Thirteen runs {{were made}} in a small {{recirculating}} flume to simulate the deposition of the climbing-ripple sequences commonly present in fine-grained facies of fluvial and deltaic deposits. These sequences consist of intergradational climbing-ripple cross laminae and draped laminae. The experiments {{were based on the}} assumption that stratification type depends mainly on near-bottom flow structure and uniform sediment fallout from an overloaded flow. Various combinations of curves of velocity versus time and of sediment feed versus time in runs lasting from 45 to 840 min were used in an exploratory program; conditions for each run were selected on the basis of experience in previous runs. The runs verified that Type A (erosional-stoss) climbing ripples are produced by aggradation rates that are small relative to ripple migration rate, and Type B (depositional-stoss) climbing ripples are produced by aggradation rates that are large relative to ripple migration rate. Draped lamination results from continued fallout of sediment from suspension after ripple migration ceases or almost ceases. Com-parison of geometric details of the ripple stratification produced in the flume runs with that in natural sequences, supplemented by considerations on maximum and minimum migration rates of ripples, suggests times of no more than a few tens of hours for the deposition of the climbing-ripple portions of sequences 10 - 20 cm thick.

40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{investigates the}} {{diagenesis}} and reservoir quality of Upper Jurassic Sandstones from the Central Graben. Petrophysical and petrographical {{studies have been}} done on cored interval from well 2 / 1 - 6. Precipitation of quartz cement is the main porosity destroying process in deeply buried quartz rich sandstone reservoirs of the North Sea. Quartz cement precipitate in the form of syntaxial overgrowth over detrital grain of quartz. Grain coatings like micro-quartz and illite are the main reasons of preservation of porosity in the area. Grain coats preserve porosity by covering the grain and inhibiting the quartz overgrowth. Petrographical and petrophysical data in this study clearly indicates that grain coatings are present in the Central Graben. Micro-quartz grain coating is the most common grain coat in the Upper Jurassic Sandstones of Ula Formation. Micro-quartz grain coat are generated from the transformation of siliceous sponge spicules known as Rhaxella Perforata. Though micro-quartz is present in all low and high porosity zones but it could not preserve porosity in low porosity zones. Clay grain coats like illite and chlorite grain coats are also present but in variable amounts. Relation between Intergranular volume (IGV) vs matrix and quartz cementation vs porosity have been also been studied. IGV is strongly affected by mechanical compaction, grain size, grain shape, quartz cementation, and carbonate cement. Sandstones with high amount of matrix and fine grained grains have high IGV as compared to coarse grained sandstones because coarse grained sandstones are compacted more when they are subjected to mechanical compaction. Grain shape has also a pronounced affect on the porosity in the area. Angular grains loose porosity as they are subjected to stress. In <b>angular</b> grains <b>contact</b> forces are more concentrated because of small contact areas. This is the reason we have low porosity zones which have angular grains and were not influenced by micro-quartz grain coatings...|$|R
40|$|International audienceHow {{particle}} shape affects the complex rheology of granular materials {{is a vast}} topic which is now being increasingly addressed both experimentally and numerically. However, a systematic and quantitative investigation of shape-dependence is still largely elusive since {{particle shape}} character- istics such as elongation, angularity, slenderness and nonconvexity are described by distinct groups of parameters, {{and the effect of}} each parameter is not easy to isolate experimentally. In this work, we introduce a low-order parameter n which describes the degree of distortion from a perfectly circular/spherical shape in 2 D/ 3 D. We shows that, for several simulated packings composed of different particle shapes (Fig. 1), the shear strength is an increasing function of n whereas the solid fraction increases first to a maximum value but declines as n increases. Another interesting finding is that the effect of specific shape parameters (angularity, nonconvexity, elonga- tion, [...] .) is of second order.

The particles are irregular polyhedra with varying numbers of face from spheres to "double pyramid" shape with a constant aspect ratio.

An interesting finding is that the shear strength first increases with angularity up to a maximum value and then saturates as the particles become more angular. Analyzing the anisotropies induced by the <b>angular</b> distributions of <b>contacts</b> and forces orientations, we show that the saturation of the shear strength at higher angularities is a consequence of fall-off of the texture anisotropies compensated by an increase of the tangential force anisotropy. This is attributed to the fact that at higher angularity, particles are bet-ter connected (or surrounded) leading to an increase of friction mobilization in order to achieve the deformation. Moreover, the most angular particles also have very few sides so that, this effect is enhanced by the increase of the proportion of face-side and side-side contacts with angularity...|$|R

40|$|In {{the thesis}} a unified control-oriented {{modeling}} approach is proposed {{to deal with}} the kinematics, linear and <b>angular</b> momentum, <b>contact</b> constraints and dynamics of a free-flying space robot interacting with a target satellite. This developed approach combines the dynamics of both systems in one structure along with holonomic and nonholonomic constraints in a single framework. Furthermore, this modeling allows considering the generalized contact forces between the space robot end-effecter and the target satellite as internal forces rather than external forces. As a result of this approach, linear and angular momentum will form holonomic and nonholonomic constraints, respectively. Meanwhile, restricting the motion of the space robot end-effector {{on the surface of the}} target satellite will impose geometric constraints. The proposed momentum of the combined system under consideration is a generalization of the momentum model of a free-flying space robot. A physical interpretation of holonomy/nonholonomic constraints is analyzed based on d'Almberts-Lagrange dynamics and reveals geometric conditions that generate such a behavior. Moreover, a nonholonomy criterion is proposed to verify the integrability of momentum constraints by using a linear transformation via orthogonal projection techniques and singular value decomposition. This criterion can be used to verify the holonomy of a free-flying space robot with or without interaction with a target satellite and to check whether these constraints or their initial conditions are violated. Based on this unified model, three reduced models are developed. The first reduced dynamics can be considered as a generalization of a free-flying robot without contact with a target satellite. In this reduced model it is found that the Jacobian and inertia matrices can be considered as an extension of those of a free-flying space robot. Since control of the base attitude rather than its translation is preferred in certain cases, a second reduced model is obtained by eliminating the base linear motion dynamics. For the purpose of the controller development, a third reduced-order dynamical model is then obtained by finding a common solution of all constraints using the concept of orthogonal projection matrices...|$|R

We adopt an elastoplastic micropolar constitutive model, recently developed for dense cohesionless granular materials within the framework of thermomicromechanics. The internal variables and their evolution laws are conceived from a direct consideration of the dissipative mechanism of force chain buckling. The resulting constitutive law is cast entirely in terms of the particle scale properties. It thus presents a unique opportunity to test the potential of micromechanical continuum formulations to reproduce key stages in the deformation history: the development of material instabilities and failure following an initially homogeneous deformation. Progression of failure, initiating from frictional sliding and rolling at contacts, followed by the buckling of force chains, through to macroscopic strain softening and shear banding, is reproduced. Bifurcation point, marking the onset of shear banding, occurred shortly after the peak stress ratio. A wide range of material parameters was examined to show the effect of particle scale properties on the progression of failure. Model predictions on the thickness and angle of inclination of the shear band and the structural evolution inside the band, namely the latitudinal distribution of particle rotations and the <b>angular</b> distributions of <b>contacts</b> and the normal contact forces, are consistent with observations from numerical simulations and experiments...|$|R
