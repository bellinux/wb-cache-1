5|$|Some theory {{requires}} {{selecting a}} fixed {{point on the}} sphere, calling the pair (sphere, point) a pointed sphere. For some spaces the choice matters, but for <b>a</b> <b>sphere</b> all points are equivalent so the choice {{is a matter of}} convenience. The point (1, 0, 0, …, 0), which is on the equator of all the spheres, works well for geometric spheres; the (collapsed) rim of the disk is another obvious choice.|$|E
5|$|The Reuleaux {{triangle}} {{may also}} be interpreted as the conformal image of a spherical triangle with 120° angles.

Experiments were undertaken, within a MATLAB environment, by running computer simulations that tested the directivity of <b>a</b> rigid <b>sphere</b> microphone array in both near and far field. The simulations performed calculated the directivity of three different microphone arrays with 128 microphones: placed circularly around <b>a</b> rigid <b>sphere,</b> placed uniformly distributed in <b>a</b> rigid <b>sphere</b> and placed randomly distributed in <b>a</b> rigid <b>sphere.</b> It is shown that the directivity of the array of microphones placed uniformly in the <b>sphere</b> show <b>a</b> better directivity than the other arrays since it shows a narrower mainlobe and less sidelobes. 1...|$|R

5|$|A planet's {{defining}} {{physical characteristic}} {{is that it}} is massive enough for the force of its own gravity to dominate over the electromagnetic forces binding its physical structure, leading to a state of hydrostatic equilibrium. This effectively means that all planets are spherical or spheroidal. Up to a certain mass, an object can be irregular in shape, but beyond that point, which varies depending on the chemical makeup of the object, gravity begins to pull an object towards its own centre of mass until the object collapses into <b>a</b> <b>sphere.</b>|$|E
5|$|Apollonius' {{problem has}} stimulated much further work. Generalizations to three dimensions—constructing <b>a</b> <b>sphere</b> tangent to four given spheres—and beyond have been studied. The {{configuration}} of three mutually tangent circles has received particular attention. René Descartes gave a formula relating the radii {{of the solution}} circles and the given circles, now known as Descartes' theorem. Solving Apollonius' problem iteratively in this case leads to the Apollonian gasket, {{which is one of}} the earliest fractals to be described in print, and is important in number theory via Ford circles and the Hardy–Littlewood circle method.|$|E

5|$|Han-era astronomers {{adopted a}} geocentric {{model of the}} universe, theorizing that it was shaped like <b>a</b> <b>sphere</b> {{surrounding}} the earth in the center. They assumed that the Sun, Moon, and planets were spherical and not disc-shaped. They also thought that the illumination of the Moon and planets was caused by sunlight, that lunar eclipses occurred when the Earth obstructed sunlight falling onto the Moon, and that a solar eclipse occurred when the Moon obstructed sunlight from reaching the Earth. Although others disagreed with his model, Wang Chong accurately described the water cycle of the evaporation of water into clouds.|$|E
5|$|Ibn Tulun {{stands out}} as the first {{governor}} of a major province of the Abbasid Caliphate to not only establish himself as its master independently of the Abbasid court, but to also pass power on to his son. He was thus also the first ruler since the Ptolemaic Pharaohs to make Egypt an independent political power again, with <b>a</b> <b>sphere</b> of influence encompassing Syria {{and parts of the}} Maghreb, setting the tone for later Egypt-based Islamic regimes, from the Ikhshidids to the Mamluk Sultanate of Cairo.|$|E

The Swedish consulate commissioned the piece, created by Swedish sculptor Gustav Kraitz. The sculpture, Hope, is a replica of Wallenberg’s briefcase, <b>a</b> <b>sphere,</b> five pillars of black granite, and paving stones (setts) which were formerly used {{on the streets of the}} Budapest ghetto. There is also Wallenberg Forest in Riverdale, Bronx, established in 1990 and named Wallenberg Forest in 1996.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{consider}} the relation between public sphere and social functional systems in modern society from a viewpoint of Luhmann’s social theory. In the 1960 s Habermas thought that <b>a</b> public <b>sphere</b> is the place where citizens argue freely and public opinion is formed. But since the place of social determination is specialized, the function of <b>a</b> political public <b>sphere</b> is reduced in modern society. Moreover, the ideal combination of <b>a</b> political public <b>sphere</b> and <b>a</b> rational public <b>sphere</b> also becomes less realistic. It has been diversified and decentralized.
