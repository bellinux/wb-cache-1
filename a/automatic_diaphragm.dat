25|$|The {{first attempt}} to make {{high-end}} professional camera by KMZ was the Start in 1958. This camera had {{a full set of}} shutter speeds (from 1 sec to 1/1000), a lens with an <b>automatic</b> <b>diaphragm</b> in a unique breech-lock mount, and even a knife for cutting-off part of the unexposed film. The photographer could choose between a pentaprism and waist-level finders. The grave disadvantage of the Start is blamed on lack of lenses; only one lens (the Helios-44 f2/58) was ever made for the proprietary Start mount directly.|$|E
2500|$|The first SLR cameras with {{internal}} (“through-the-lens” or “TTL”) meters (e.g., the Pentax Spotmatic) {{required that the}} lens is stopped down to the working aperture when taking a meter reading. [...] With a small aperture, this darkened the viewfinder, making viewing, focusing, and composition difficult. Subsequent models soon incorporated mechanical coupling between the lens and the camera body, indicating the working aperture to the camera while allowing the lens to be at its maximum aperture for composition and focusing; this feature became known as automatic aperture control or <b>automatic</b> <b>diaphragm</b> control.|$|E
2500|$|During 1967 through 1969 KMZ {{built an}} {{automatic}} die-cast moulding line, allowing mass camera production. Camera production {{switched to the}} M42×1 thread (also known as Praktica thread) and an instant-return mirror was also developed. This led {{to one of the}} most famous Zenits — Zenit-E which saw (including its subtypes) over 12 million produced. A heavy and tough camera with a mechanism that was of exceedingly simple design along the lines of [...] "what isn't there, can't go wrong". [...] <b>Automatic</b> <b>diaphragm</b> functionality was not available until the introduction of the Zenit-EM, which used a direct mechanism linking the shutter release button to the aperture mechanism, significantly increasing the effort required to release the shutter. [...] Production included both M39×1 and M42×1 mounts for the Zenit E and Zenit B models. [...] Later models were only produced in the M42×1 with the Pentax K mount available for the latest models.|$|E

50|$|The Yashica Company {{introduced}} its own SLR in 1959, the Pentamatic, an advanced, modern 35mm SLR camera with a proprietary bayonet-mount. The Pentamatic featured an <b>automatic</b> stop-down <b>diaphragm</b> (offered {{only with the}} Auto Yashinon 50mm/1.8 lens), instant-return mirror, a fixed pentaprism, and a mechanical focal-plane shutter with speeds of 1-1/1000 second, along with additional interchangeable lenses.|$|R
50|$|In 2008, Nikon {{introduced}} its PC-E perspective-control lenses withelectromagnetic <b>diaphragms.</b> <b>Automatic</b> aperture control {{is provided with}} the D300, D500, D600/610, D700, D750, D800/810, D3, D4 and D5 cameras. With some earlier cameras, the lenses offer preset aperture control {{by means of a}} pushbutton that controls the electromagnetic diaphragm; with other earlier cameras, no aperture control is provided, and the lenses are not usable.|$|R

50|$|An {{improved}} version, Start-2, {{was produced}} ca. 1963-1964. It had <b>automatic</b> <b>diaphragm</b> and meteric prism.|$|E
25|$|Canon EF lenses, {{introduced}} in 1987, have electromagnetic diaphragms, {{eliminating the need}} for a mechanical linkage between the camera and the lens, and allowing automatic aperture control with the Canon TS-E tilt/shift lenses. Nikon PC-E perspective-control lenses, {{introduced in}} 2008, also have electromagnetic <b>diaphragms.</b> <b>Automatic</b> aperture control is provided with the newer Nikon digital SLR cameras; with some earlier cameras, the lenses offer preset aperture control by means of a pushbutton that controls the electromagnetic diaphragm.|$|R
50|$|Peleng 3.5/8A is an 8 mm super-wideangle {{circular}} fisheye photographic lens, and {{is designed}} as an interchangeable lens for Canon, Nikon, Pentax, Olympus digital or film cameras which have or don't have the instant-return <b>diaphragm</b> <b>automatic</b> control device. The lens has a variable diaphragm from f/3.5 to f/16. The lens has antireflective coating. This lens casts a 24mm image circle on a 24x36mm frame. It occupies only part of frame 24x36 and fits in a small side of a frame with a small cutting along the edges. The geometric centers of the image and the frame coincide.|$|R
50|$|In 1902 Krebs {{invented the}} <b>automatic</b> <b>diaphragm</b> {{carburettor}} which gave cars continuous power during acceleration {{by providing a}} constant air-fuel ratio at all times; this also led to dramatic improvement in fuel economy.|$|E
50|$|The Zunow SLR, {{which went}} on sale in 1958 (in Japan only), was the first 35mm SLR camera with an <b>automatic</b> <b>diaphragm,</b> which stopped down to the {{preselected}} aperture upon release of the shutter. (Although this invention had been anticipated by the 1954 Praktina FX-A which featured a semi-automatic diaphragm, which stopped down automatically, but had to be opened manually after the exposure.) The <b>automatic</b> <b>diaphragm</b> feature eliminated one downside to viewing with an SLR: the darkening of the viewfinder screen image when the photographer selected a small lens aperture. The Zunow Optical Company also supplied the Miranda Camera Company with lenses for their Miranda T SLR cameras.|$|E
5000|$|Auto — Designation for F-type lenses {{indicating}} an <b>automatic</b> <b>diaphragm</b> (aperture). Not to {{be confused}} with automatic exposure or auto focus, the designation fell out of use in the early 1970s and was not carried onto K-type lenses.|$|E
50|$|As {{a common}} {{mechanical}} interface, the T-mount allows components of various manufacturers to be interchanged and assembled. The T-mount is a solely mechanical specification. Electrical or mechanical connections (such as for autofocus) {{are generally not}} provided, although Sigma’s YS Mount featured an <b>automatic</b> <b>diaphragm</b> coupling.|$|E
50|$|The Yashica Pentamatic, an advanced, modern 35mm Single Lens Reflex (SLR) {{camera with}} a {{proprietary}} bayonet-mount, <b>automatic</b> <b>diaphragm</b> (offered {{only with the}} Auto Yashinon 50mm/1.8 lens), and interchangeable lenses, was introduced in 1959. As before, Yashica continued to source its lenses from the Tomioka Optical factory.|$|E
50|$|When {{the shutter}} release is pressed the mirror flips {{up against the}} viewing screen, the {{diaphragm}} closes down (if automatic), the shutter opens and closes, the mirror returns to its 45-degree viewing position (on most or all 35 mm SLRs made since 1970) and the <b>automatic</b> <b>diaphragm</b> re-opens to full aperture.|$|E
50|$|The {{carburettor}} is an <b>automatic</b> <b>diaphragm</b> Krebs type. The {{automatic throttle}} is coupled to the centrifugal governor which {{is mounted on}} the same shaft as the fan and can only be controlled by the accelerator pedal. The magneto is driven from the inlet valves' camshaft as is also the commutator and the pump for the engine lubrication system.|$|E
5000|$|All lenses {{for these}} mounts are {{interchangeable}} between older and newer Minolta manual focus 35mm film SLR bodies. There are exceptions, such as, the lenses before 1961 feature {{a slightly different}} aperture leverage, and thus the <b>automatic</b> <b>diaphragm</b> may not work correctly on post-1961 cameras, and later MC/MD tabs may hit a screw of the front cover on earlier cameras. Four design enhancements, all forwardly inclusive and backwardly compatible, are: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{front brake}} caliper was resited {{to the rear}} of the fork leg and the front master {{cylinder}} reservoir shape was changed. A hazard switch was added. Needle roller bearings were fitted to the swingarm instead of the earlier plain bushings. Tuning modifications were made to the carbs to improve low speed operation. The manual operation fuel tap was replaced with an <b>automatic</b> <b>diaphragm</b> unit. A rear disc brake replaced the earlier drum.|$|E
50|$|In May 1959, the Canonflex SLR was introduced. The camera {{featured}} a quick return mirror, an <b>automatic</b> <b>diaphragm</b> and was introduced with an interchangeable black pentaprism housing. It also featured newly developed 'R' series breech lock mount lenses. This SLR was superseded by the Canonflex RM, a fixed prism SLR which {{featured a}} built-in selenium cell meter. Later came the Canonflex R2000, {{with a top}} shutter speed of 1/2000 of a second. This model was also superseded by the Canonflex RM.|$|E

5000|$|Like its FL predecessor, the FD {{mount system}} allowed <b>automatic</b> <b>diaphragm</b> function, but in addition, a new signal pin {{supported}} full-aperture metering. A second signal pin for the [...] "auto" [...] {{setting of the}} aperture dial, plus a linkage to allow the camera to set the degree of diaphragm opening, enabled integral auto-exposure. The first camera to utilize this was the 1971 Canon F-1, when equipped with the Servo EE Finder. Later, the Canon EF of 1973 had automatic exposure built-in, as did the very popular Canon A-series cameras (save the AT-1) beginning in 1976.|$|E
50|$|In 1959, Nippon Kogaku {{released}} its first 35 mm SLR, the professional level Nikon F. The F combined every SLR technological advance available in 1959 (<b>automatic</b> <b>diaphragm</b> lenses, instant return mirror and eyelevel pentaprism viewfinder) into one superbly integrated package with bulletproof mechanical durability and reliability, plus topnotch optical quality. It also offered {{the most complete}} system of accessories in the world, including interchangeable viewfinder heads, viewfinder screens, motor drives, flashbulb units, bulk film backs and eventually over fifty world class Nikkor lenses. The F quickly became a preferred 35 mm camera among professional photographers, especially photojournalists, and amateurs who could afford the best cameras.|$|E
5000|$|A lens with an [...] "automatic" [...] {{diaphragm}} {{allows the}} photographer {{to forget about}} closing the diaphragm to shooting aperture; such diaphragms have been taken for granted for decades. Usually this means a pin or lever {{on the back of}} the lens is pushed or released by a part of the shutter release mechanism in the camera body; the external automatic diaphragms on lenses for Exakta and Miranda cameras were the exception to that. Some lenses had [...] "semi-automatic" [...] diaphragms that closed to shooting aperture like an <b>automatic</b> <b>diaphragm</b> but had to be re-opened manually with a flip of a ring on the lens.|$|E

5000|$|The company {{retained}} the same lens mount on the Swiss made cameras from 1942 until they ended production. The back {{focus of the}} body was the thinnest of any 35 mm camera, and as a result, {{it was possible to}} make adapters to use lenses designed for almost any other 35 mm SLR on an Alpa. Adapters offered included Exakta, M42 (<b>automatic</b> <b>diaphragm</b> and manual), Nikon (auto and manual), Leicaflex, T-mount, and Contax. Other adapters included one to allow mounting Alpa lenses to C-mount movie cameras and another to mount the Alpa bodies to a microscope. Alpa did not make their own lenses, and sourced them through some of the best lens makers—Angenieux, Kern, Kinoptik, Schneider, and others. They were the only company to guarantee optical quality of the lenses they sold. The clearness of the pentaprism in the Alpa models, and the use of [...] "rings" [...] of different surfaces in the eyepiece of the 11 series especially made them a great choice for using on a T-mount, attached to large telescopes. Coupled with the manual mirror raise switch, even the vibration of the mirror slap was removed.|$|E
