5|$|In 1993, Collins' husband, Bill, {{was charged}} in an influence-peddling scandal. The {{prosecution}} claimed that while Collins was governor, Dr. Collins exploited {{a perception that}} he could influence the awarding of state contracts through his wife. It was alleged that he exploited this perception to pressure people who did business with the state to invest nearly $2million with him. He was convicted on October 14, 1993, after a seven-week trial; {{he was given a}} sentence of five years and three months in federal prison, which was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>low</b> <b>end</b> of the range prescribed by the federal sentencing guidelines. He was also fined $20,000 for a conspiracy charge that involved kickbacks disguised as political contributions. Governor Collins was called to testify in the trial, but was not charged. The scandal tarnished her image, however, and may have cost her an appointment in the administration of President Bill Clinton. Collins was also rumored to be considering running for the U.S. Senate, a bid which never materialized following her husband's conviction. The Collinses reunited following Dr. Collins' release from prison on October 10, 1997.|$|E
5|$|The Tokyo Mew Mew manga {{series was}} well {{received}} by English-speaking audiences. In March and April 2003, {{the first volume}} sold an estimated 1,597 and 1,746 copies respectively. This put the volume <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>low</b> <b>end</b> of the top 50 sales for each month. By 2004, {{with most of the}} series released, it became a mild success for licensor Tokyopop. It was ranked number 16 on the list of Manga Top 50 for the first quarter of 2004 in the ICv2 Retailers Guide to Anime/Manga, based on sales from both mainstream bookstores and comic book shops. Sales of the sixth and seventh volumes dropped slightly; however, both were among the top 100 best-selling graphic novels in March and May 2004. The first volume of Tokyo Mew Mew à la Mode debuted 63rd on the list of top 100 best-selling graphic novels of May 2005, with nearly double the sales figures of the last volume of the main series. On the Nielsen Bookscan charts, the volume debuted at rank 39 before quickly climbing to the 14th spot. The second volume of à la Mode saw similar success, debuting in the 69th slot before advancing to the 12th position, a result of the Mew Mew Power show appearing on 4Kids TV.|$|E

25|$|The {{choice of}} Jordal had the {{drawback}} of poor ground conditions {{and that the}} site was a hill.

The overruns were largely caused by difficult ground conditions and the hillside location, with a more conventional location estimated to have halved the construction costs. Half a million krone were also spent because the venue used a year to receive a building permit, so the bulk of construction could not start until early 1951, a year after schedule, although preliminary construction started in August 1950.

Updating a concept introduced by TV hostess Vampira over three decades before, MST3K presented cheap, low-grade movies, primarily science fiction of the 1950s and 1960s, along with running voiceover commentary highlighting the films' shortcomings.

40|$|Objective: Some {{researchers}} {{have reported that}} distribution of total depressive symptom scores {{in the general population}} may follow an exponential pattern except <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>end</b> of <b>the</b> scores. To understand the mechanism responsible for this phenomenon, we investigated the mathematical patterns of the individual distributions for each item of a depressive symptom scale. Methods: We analysed data from 32 022 participants in the general population who participated in the Active Survey of Health and Welfare, Japan. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Japanese version of Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). CES-D has 20 items, each of which is scored in 4 grades: 'Rarely', 'Some', 'Much' and 'Most of the time'. Results: The individual distributions of 16 negative items belonging to the depressive mood, somatic symptoms and retarded activities, and interpersonal relations categories, followed a common mathematical pattern, which displayed different distributions with a boundary <b>at</b> 'Some'. <b>The</b> distributions for the 16 items between 'Rarely' and 'Some' appeared to cross at a single point. On the other hand, the distributions of the 16 items between 'Some' and 'Most' followed a linear pattern when plotted using a log-normal scale. The remaining 4 items in the positive affect subscale showed non-specific patterns. Conclusions: The common mathematical pattern of the 16 negative item distributions may contribute to the exponential pattern of the distribution of total depressive symptom scores except <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>end</b> of <b>the</b> scores...|$|R
