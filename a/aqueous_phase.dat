Tetravalent americium {{has also been}} observed in the <b>aqueous</b> <b>phase.</b> For this purpose, black Am(OH)4 was dissolved in 15-M NH3F with the americium concentration of 0.01 M. The resulting reddish solution had a characteristic optical absorption spectrum {{which is similar to}} that of AmF4 but differed from other oxidation states of americium. Heating the Am(IV) solution to 90°C did not result in its disproportionation or reduction, however a slow reduction was observed to Am(III) and assigned to self-irradiation of americium by alpha particles.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possible}} way {{to separate the}} trivalent actinides is via solvent extraction chromatography using bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (abbreviated as HDEHP) as the stationary organic phase and nitric acid as the mobile <b>aqueous</b> <b>phase.</b> The actinide elution sequence is reversed {{from that of the}} cation-exchange resin column, so that the heavier actinides elute later. The mendelevium separated by this method has the advantage of being free of organic complexing agent compared to the resin column; the disadvantage is that mendelevium then elutes very late in the elution sequence, after fermium.|$|E

Differentiation of these two <b>aqueous</b> <b>phases,</b> studying the effect of manufacturing technology on droplet structure, quantitative determination of phase volumes and any changes occurring during storage are essential when planning w/o/w emulsions.

40|$|The solvent {{extraction}} performance of N,N’-dimethyl-N,N’-dicyclohexylthiodiglycolamide (DMDCHTDGA) towards Pt(IV) and Pd(II) in HCl solutions {{has recently been}} published. It was shown that these two platinum-group metals (PGMs) are efficiently extracted from 8 M HCl <b>aqueous</b> <b>phases,</b> being subsequently separated by sequential strippings: 1 M HCl allows Pt(IV) recovery, whereas Pd(II) is only back-extracted by thiourea in HCl. In this work, selectivity tests were carried out to evaluate the performance of DMDCHTDGA towards the recovery of both PGMs, from 8 M HCl <b>aqueous</b> <b>phases...</b>|$|R
5|$|Both 256Lr and 260Lr have half-lives {{too short}} to allow a {{complete}} chemical purification process. Early experiments with 256Lr therefore used rapid solvent extraction, with the chelating agent thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTA) dissolved in methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) as the organic phase, and with the <b>aqueous</b> <b>phase</b> being buffered acetate solutions. Ions of different charge (+2, +3, or +4) will then extract into the organic phase under different pH ranges, but this method will not separate the trivalent actinides and thus 256Lr must be identified by its emitted 8.24MeV alpha particles. More recent methods have allowed rapid selective elution with α-HIB {{to take place in}} enough time to separate out the longer-lived isotope 260Lr, which can be removed from the catcher foil with 0.05Mhydrochloric acid.|$|E
5|$|Buffer {{solutions}} {{also play}} a key role in analytical chemistry. They are used whenever there is a need to fix the pH of a solution at a particular value. Compared with an aqueous solution, the pH of a buffer solution is relatively insensitive to the addition of a small amount of strong acid or strong base. The buffer capacity of a simple buffer solution is largest when pH=pKa. In acid–base extraction, the efficiency of extraction of a compound into an organic phase, such as an ether, can be optimised by adjusting the pH of the <b>aqueous</b> <b>phase</b> using an appropriate buffer. At the optimum pH, the concentration of the electrically neutral species is maximised; such a species is more soluble in organic solvents having a low dielectric constant than it is in water. This technique is used for the purification of weak acids and bases.|$|E
25|$|The {{partition}} coefficient is defined at a specified temperature and, if applicable, pH of the <b>aqueous</b> <b>phase.</b> Partition coefficients {{are very important}} in pharmacology because they {{determine the extent to}} which a substance can pass from the blood (an aqueous solution) through a cell wall which is like an organic solvent. They are usually measured using water and octanol as the two solvents. Many pharmaceutical compounds are weak acids or weak bases. Such a compound may exist with a different extent of protonation depending on pH and the acid dissociation constant. Because the organic phase has a low dielectric constant the species with no electrical charge will be the most likely one to pass from the <b>aqueous</b> <b>phase</b> to the organic phase. Even at pH7–7.2, the range of biological pH values, the <b>aqueous</b> <b>phase</b> may support an equilibrium between more than one protonated form. logp is determined from the analytical concentration of the substance in the <b>aqueous</b> <b>phase,</b> that is, the sum of the concentration of the different species in equilibrium.|$|E

A detailed comparison between theory and experiment provides strong evidence that the intrinsic contact angle θin represents a material parameter, in contrast to the effective contact angles...|$|R
40|$|<b>Aqueous</b> two <b>phase</b> {{partition}} {{explores the}} possibility of solutions of two polymers or one polymer and one salt separating into two immiscible <b>aqueous</b> <b>phases,</b> when certain critical concentrations are exceeded. Each one of these <b>aqueous</b> <b>phases</b> is more concentrated {{in one of the}} phase forming chemicals. Both exhibit a high water content, usually more than 80 % (w/w) and in some cases as much as 95 %. Due to this high water content, these biphasic systems provide a gentle environment for molecules and particles with biological activity. The main subject of this thesis is the characterisation of new <b>aqueous</b> two <b>phase</b> systems based on crude polymers as phase forming polymers, since the cost of the phase forming polymers is the main drawback on the large scale application of <b>aqueous</b> two <b>phase</b> partition. <b>Aqueous</b> two <b>phase</b> systems based on crude polymers are less expensive and so the applicability of this technique can be increased. The presented work is performed exclusively on polymer polymer two phase systems.

25|$|To a first approximation, the {{non-polar}} {{phase in}} such experiments is usually {{dominated by the}} un-ionized form of the solute, which is electrically neutral, though {{this may not be}} true for the <b>aqueous</b> <b>phase.</b> To measure the partition coefficient of ionizable solutes, the pH of the <b>aqueous</b> <b>phase</b> is adjusted such that the predominant form of the compound in solution is the un-ionized, or its measurement at another pH of interest requires consideration of all species, un-ionized and ionized (see following).|$|E

40|$|The {{instability}} {{behavior of}} several supported liquid membranes (SLMs) {{has been studied}} for {{a system in which}} nitrate ions are removed from an <b>aqueous</b> feed <b>phase</b> and concentrated in a stripping phase. The composition of the <b>aqueous</b> <b>phases</b> and of the membrane liquid has been determined after the <b>aqueous</b> <b>phases</b> had flowed parallel to the membranes for a period of six days. From the experimental data it can be concluded that SLM-failure results from the removal of LM-phase from the support.

50|$|The term {{microemulsion}} {{was first}} used by T. P. Hoar and J. H. Shulman, professors of chemistry at Cambridge University, in 1943. Alternative names for these systems are often used, such as transparent emulsion, swollen micelle, micellar solution, and solubilized oil. More confusingly still, the term microemulsion can refer to the single isotropic phase that {{is a mixture of}} oil, water and surfactant, or to one that is in equilibrium with coexisting predominantly oil and/or <b>aqueous</b> <b>phases,</b> or even to other non-isotropic phases. As in the binary systems (water/surfactant or oil/surfactant), self-assembled structures of different types can be formed, ranging, for example, from (inverted) spherical and cylindrical micelles to lamellar phases and bicontinuous microemulsions, which may coexist with predominantly oil or <b>aqueous</b> <b>phases.</b>|$|R

In hybrid- aligned shells, with planar outer and homeotropic inner boundary (or vice versa), the N–I transition splits into two steps, with a consequent three-step textural transformation.
