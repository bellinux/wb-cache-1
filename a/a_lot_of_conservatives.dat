She also wanted schools to incorporate LGBTQ issues and material into their curriculums; more specifically, she hoped this would happen in all English composition classes from elementary school to high school because this could prevent homophobia and educate kids on the concept of identity. de la tierras writing style was not only progressive but it was also very humorous and daring. One of Conmocións issues, published by a collective in San Francisco during one of tatianas illness, included a quiz titled [...] "100% Latina Lesbian Checklist" [...] that poked fun at the symbol of 100% Latina Lesbian Vision that graced each issue. The quiz was funny and entertaining, giving the readers points for having a [...] "penis-free zone" [...] (hinting at owning any dildos or similar objects). <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>conservative</b> people were offended by her writing because she spoke and wrote unapologetically. de la tierra did not hold back when it came to eroticism, and she was so free in her speech that her writing was compared to pornography. However, some writers found de la tirras work inspirational and empowering. de la tierra was shameless about discussing sexuality and this encouraged others to speak freely about sexuality, sex, and the human body as well.|$|R

In 1992 the South African government decided to call an end-of-apartheid referendum with the question whether {{the negotiations}} with the ANC and other parties for a new constitution should continue. During the campaign the National Party-led government swore that she would never accept a proportional electoral system, because this would mean that white minority (12% of the population) should lose all power to the black majority (74% of the population). The NP would only accept a form of power sharing. And a second referendum would be called to test the results of the negotiations among white voters. Ultimately, 68,7% of the white voters voted in favour for the continue of the negotiations.|$|R

2500|$|In 2009, {{after years}} of trying to persuade the Conservative {{movement}}’s Rabbinical Assembly that the movement needed a stronger presence in the nation’s capital, the group made the decision to appoint a Director of Public Policy, turning to Moline to serve in that position as a volunteer. He had argued that other Jewish movements had such a presence, such as the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism and the Orthodox Union’s Institute for Public Affairs, both of which are “active players in the capital.” [...] Understanding that there is a “diverse RA membership behind him and an even more diverse population <b>of</b> <b>Conservative</b> Jews,” Moline’s responsibilities were expected to focus on “broad consensus positions of the movement and on laying out broad principles based on Conservative thinking.” However, as one Washington Jewish Week article noted, “… he is also an experienced Washington player; <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> the new <b>Conservative</b> movement’s impact may be under the radar with Moline at the helm.” Rabbi Jeffrey Wohlberg, then President of the Rabbinical Assembly, praised the choice of Moline for the new position, saying that “Rabbi Moline is that perfect combination of smart, well-connected, socially-savvy and thoroughly conversant on the issues of the day. In addition, he knows {{the ins and outs of}} the Washington world. His appointment ushers in an exciting new era for the Rabbinical Assembly and Conservative Judaism.” ...|$|R
40|$|I {{would like}} {{to make the case for}} a {{conservative}} alternative to originalism. Much of the discussion that has taken place over the last two days has proceeded on the assumption that there are two choices. One is Robert Bork's originalism, justified by various values near and dear to conservative hearts, such as the rule of law, continuity with the past, the principle of democratic accountability, and so forth. The other is to flee into the hands of the so-called nonoriginalists, and embrace, to quote Judge Easterbrook quoting Justice Brennan, the judge's "personal confrontation with the well-springs of our society. " My thesis is that there is a third option, which I will call conventionalism. Conventionalism draws much of its inspiration from the writings of a British politician and man of letters, Edmund Burke. I will argue that there is a Burkean or conventionalist approach to interpretation that is distinct from both Borkean originalism and from the various types of nonoriginalism favored in the legal academy, which I will lump together under the label normativism. I will also argue that the conventionalist approach can be justified by the same conservative values [...] the rule of law, promotion of democracy, and so on [...] that are commonly invoked in support of originalism. Indeed, I will go further and maintain that conventionalism does even better than originalism when considered in light of these values. My thesis, in short, is that the choice is not just Bork v. Brennan. It is also Bork v. Burke. And, at least for someone who puts <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> stock in <b>conservative</b> values, Burke beats Bork...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background & purpose. The overactive bladder is {{a highly}} {{prevalent}} syndrome. Conservative treatment is recommended as first treatment option by <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> practice guidelines. <b>Conservative</b> therapy is often conducted by pelvic physiotherapists. The primary purpose of this case series was to describe the treatment and its results for patients with overactive bladder syndrome with pelvic physiotherapy. The secondary purpose was to evaluate the research protocol used for feasibility. Case descriptions. Three female patients with overactive bladder syndrome were included in a 12 -week pelvic physiotherapy program. The program included information and education, bladder training and, pelvic floor muscle exercises. The primary outcome measures were the Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC) and number of urgency urinary incontinence episodes/ 24 hours. Secondary outcome measures were the Protection, Amount, Frequency, Adjustment and Body image (PRAFAB), Patient Perception of Intensity of Urgency scale (PPIUS), Incontinence Quality Of Life (I-QOL), number- and volume of voids/ 24 hours and, number of urgency- and nocturia episodes/ 24 hours according to a 3 -day micturition diary. Outcomes of PPBC, PRAFAB and, I-QOL were registered at baseline and 12 -weeks. Outcomes of the 3 -day micturition diary and PPIUS were registered at baseline, 6 - and, 12 -weeks. To test the feasibility of the protocol a tailor-made questionnaire regarding the protocol was developed. Outcomes. The three patients completed the 12 -week pelvic physiotherapy program. No urinary incontinence episodes were reported. One patient improved significantly on the PPBC. All patients had a significant improvement on the PRAFAB and a mean micturition frequency of < 8 / 24 hours. I-QOL outcomes showed a general improvement. Layout of form 1 scored a mode of 1 on 5, “not very clear”, in the feasibility questionnaire. Discussion. A significant outcome was reported for 1 patient after completion of the pelvic physiotherapy program. However, the findings are only indicative. Methodologically sound studies with large numbers are needed to confirm these results. The study protocol seems feasible and may be implemented in future studie...|$|R
