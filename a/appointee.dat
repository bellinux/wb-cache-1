5|$|Cleveland's {{trouble with}} the Senate {{hindered}} {{the success of his}} nominations to the Supreme Court in his second term. In 1893, after the death of Samuel Blatchford, Cleveland nominated William B. Hornblower to the Court. Hornblower, the head of a New York City law firm, was thought to be a qualified <b>appointee,</b> but his campaign against a New York machine politician had made Senator David B. Hill his enemy. Further, Cleveland had not consulted the Senators before naming his <b>appointee,</b> leaving many who were already opposed to Cleveland on other grounds even more aggrieved. The Senate rejected Hornblower's nomination on January 15, 1894, by a vote of 30 to 24.|$|E
5|$|On August 12, 1867, {{during a}} Senate recess, President Johnson {{suspended}} Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, a Lincoln <b>appointee</b> who sympathized with Congressional Reconstruction. To keep Grant under control {{as a potential}} political rival, Johnson asked {{him to take the}} post. Grant recommended against the move, in light of the Tenure of Office Act, which required Senate approval for cabinet removals. Johnson believed the Act did not apply to officers appointed by the previous president and forced the issue by making Grant an interim <b>appointee</b> on the same day. Grant agreed to accept the post temporarily, and Stanton vacated the office until the Senate reconvened.|$|E

25|$|Surprisingly, the palace/privy council {{rejected}} the slate of senate <b>appointees</b> {{proposed by the}} military. It instead filled the senate with princes, nobles, and palace-friendly businessmen, leaving only eight <b>appointees</b> from the military's slate.

50|$|Judicial {{vacancies}} {{have also}} become a problem as well with numerous open seats for circuit and district judges left to be filled. At the end of President Obama's first term, thirteen percent of presidential-appointee positions had not been filled. Political <b>appointees</b> also come under heat for their own actions including Ben Bernanke's involvement with private banks and also Michael Brown's involvement in Hurricane Katrina. One {{study published in the}} Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory by Nick Gallo and David Lewis evaluated more than 350 managers with a program assessment rating tool ("PART") to determine efficacy and found that programs run by political <b>appointees</b> tended to be less effective. Furthermore, those with previous government experience or <b>appointees</b> who had not worked for a political campaign tended be more effective than <b>appointees</b> with experience in the business or non-profit sectors. Gallo and Lewis stated that they thought careerist and <b>appointees</b> should work in a balanced atmosphere to be more productive and share skills. Professional rapport between careerists and <b>appointees</b> is considered in a study of presidential environmental <b>appointees</b> by Matthew Auer. Auer found that oft-mentioned problems in the appointment system, such as short time-in-office and lack of government experience were less pronounced among top federal environmental <b>appointees,</b> across both Republican and Democratic administrations.|$|R
5|$|Cleveland was {{the first}} Democratic President subject to the Tenure of Office Act which {{originated}} in 1867; the act purported to require the Senate to approve the dismissal of any presidential <b>appointee</b> who was originally subject to its advice and consent. Cleveland objected to the act in principle and his steadfast refusal to abide by it prompted its fall into disfavor and led to its ultimate repeal in 1887.|$|E

5|$|Jackson reluctantly {{supported}} Al Gore when {{he became}} the Democratic presidential nominee, saying Gore and his running mate Joe Lieberman were not liberal enough but that he supported Gore as the only alternative to George W.

Jackson was still considered a likely <b>appointee</b> for United States Secretary of Education if Gore was elected.|$|E
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The federal government runs an incentive awards program, consisting of monetary and nonmonetary awards, to recognize individual employees or teams for outstanding contributions that enhance government operations. Congress has placed prohibitions on cash awards to political <b>appointees.</b> Overall, 32 of the 46 agencies reported that 297 political <b>appointees</b> received 373 monetary awards from September 1999 through April 2001. The remaining 14 agencies reported {{that they did not}} provide any awards to political <b>appointees</b> during that period. Political <b>appointees</b> in each of the government's pay groups received both monetary and time-off awards less frequently than did regular federal employees, but at a larger mean dollar value. The mean dollar value of all monetary awards to political <b>appointees</b> exceeded that of awards to regular federal employees. The number, rates, and mean dollar value of awards to political and regular federal employees also varied by type of award. Individual political <b>appointees</b> and regular federal employees often received more than one award. Agencies reported that 46 political <b>appointees,</b> or about 17 percent of the <b>appointees</b> who received monetary awards, received multiple awards from September 1999, through May 2000. Six departments [...] the Departments of Agriculture, Energy, Labor, State, Treasury, and Veterans Affairs [...] gave out 15 cash awards totaling $ 38, 149 to 14 political <b>appointees</b> during the moratorium. Agency officials said that these awards were made in error and that they had rescinded all of them and had recovered, or {{were in the process of}} recovering, the money.

25|$|Lee Myung-bak faced strong {{criticism}} {{over his}} choice of political <b>appointees,</b> {{many of whom were}} wealthy. The concern was that Lee's <b>appointees</b> would favor policies that protect the rich, while failing {{to address the needs of}} the underprivileged. Another criticism was that these <b>appointees</b> have mostly chosen from the nation's southeast region (Gyeongsangbuk-do and Gyeongsangnam-do), which is known as a GNP stronghold.|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we examine {{what we call the}} president’s {{invisible}} appointments. We designate Senior Executive Service and Schedule C <b>appointees</b> as invisible because, in lieu of a scandal, these <b>appointees</b> serve in the bureaucracy, generally with significantly less direct attention from the press or scholars. In addressing the invisible <b>appointees,</b> we use new data from an ongoing research project that collects and codes data from the résumés of political <b>appointees</b> in the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations. In {{this article we}} examine data from the résumés of <b>appointees</b> serving in the Department of Labor during these two adminis-trations. We describe the characteristics presidents consider when making appointments, explain which factors are most important for which positions, and compare the results to existing expectations about the factors presidents consider when making appointments. The George W. Bush administration was plagued with allegations that its appoin-tees politicized the bureaucracy. Critics charged that presidential <b>appointees</b> injected ideology into apolitical decisions at the Departments of Justice (DOJ) and Interior...|$|R

40|$|This thesis uses {{statistical}} methods to investigate if political <b>appointees</b> {{working for the}} Swedish government are good representatives {{for the members of}} the ruling party.

The consequences of differences on these characteristics between political <b>appointees</b> and the party elite could be that some interest in society are wrongly overrepresented while others are wrongly underrepresented by the unelected political <b>appointees.</b> There could also be consequences for which policies are promoted. In the bigger picture these differences could eventually damage the legitimacy of the parliamentary system.
