5|$|The {{spring of}} 1973 passed with no {{offensive}} being launched. On 21 August of that year, in complete secrecy, six senior Syrian commanders, using false names and passports, arrived from Latakia at Alexandria harbor in a Soviet passenger liner carrying holiday makers. Among the Syrian commanders were, principally, the Minister of Defense General Mustafa Tlass and the Chief of Staff General Yusuf Shakkour. For {{the next two}} days, they convened with their Egyptian counterparts at Egyptian Naval Headquarters in Ras El Tin Palace. By August 23, two documents were ratified by Shazly and Shakkour concluding that the Egyptian and Syrian armed forces were ready for war. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>remained</b> <b>was</b> to choose a date; either September 7–11 or October 5–10. The date was to be chosen jointly by Presidents Sadat and Hafez al-Assad, and {{they were required to}} communicate their decision to their commanders fifteen days before the date of attack.|$|E
5|$|Alumni Hall was {{constructed}} by the Benedictine monks and local contractors from 1891 through the winter of 1892; the building was designed by Patrick W. Ford, an Irish-American architect from Boston. Nearing completion in February 1892, <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>remained</b> <b>was</b> for workers to continue to plaster the interior walls; sadly, a fire which was most likely caused by a heating stove's gate not closed completely, sparked an ember and destroyed the entire structure. Thankfully, no one was seriously hurt because of the fire. The monks were forced to rebuild the college, spending considerably less money on the construction, as they had only received $55,000 from the Insurance Commissioner of the State of New Hampshire. In an effort to save money, many bricks were salvaged from the previous structure and pieces of granite were cut from large granite rocks still visible on the current quad. In 1893, the current building that remains the center of campus was completed; the fire delayed the first academic semester by one year. To avoid the possibility of another fire, a power house {{was constructed}} separately from the building. Farmland complete with livestock, beanpoles and tomato plants lined the present-day quad and adjacent fields, as the monks were completely self-sufficient. In 1912, the bell tower (the inside is pictured to the right) and ivy {{were added to the}} building; in 1923, the college's second chapel (the first being located on the second floor at the present-day business office) was constructed as a connecting wing. Today this second chapel is the college's Chapel Arts Center, which hosts art exhibits and other cultural events. It still boasts ornate stained glass windows and painted ceilings.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} three years, the line between Dunedin and Christchurch was completed; Christchurch and Timaru were linked on 4 February 1876, {{followed}} by Oamaru on a year later, and the difficult section between Oamaru and Dunedin was finally completed on 7 September 1878. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>remained</b> <b>was</b> the Balclutha-Gore link, which was opened on 22 January 1879, completing the Main South Line.|$|E
25|$|In fact <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>remained</b> <b>were</b> two lines. The {{route from}} the Forth Bridge to Dunfermline Lower and Townhill Junction {{continued}} {{as an important}} passenger and goods route, and this remains in use at the present time.|$|R
50|$|During {{the spring}} of 1942 all the {{railings}} surrounding the churchyard {{and most of those}} round the monuments were removed to provide scrap iron help the war effort. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>remained</b> <b>were</b> the north and south gates.|$|R

25|$|The current All Saints' Church {{was built}} on the site of a great Norman church, All Hallows, which was almost {{completely}} destroyed by the Great Fire of Northampton in 1675. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>remained</b> <b>was</b> the medieval tower and the fine vaulted crypt, but by 1680 All Saints had been rebuilt, with the help of donations from all over England, including 1,000 tons of timber from King Charles II, whose statue can be seen above the portico. Famously, the poet John Clare liked to sit beneath the portico of the church. It is home to a choral foundation, with choral services sung three times a week by one of its choirs, who also record commercially and tour throughout the world.|$|E
25|$|The {{start of}} the fourth quarter saw the Seahawks blow another scoring chance when Raiders {{defensive}} back Vann McElroy intercepted a pass from Zorn after the team had recovered Plunkett's fumbled pitch to Allen on the Los Angeles 25-yard line. Then {{the next time they}} had the ball, they drove to the LA 40-yard line, only to see Greg Townsend sack Zorn for a 23-yard loss on fourth down and 4. After the turnover on downs, Bahr kicked a 35-yard field goal to give the Raiders an insurmountable 30–7 lead with 3:57 left. At this point, <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>remained</b> <b>was</b> Zorn's meaningless touchdown pass to tight end Charle Young, making the final score 30–14.|$|E
25|$|In 66CE, the Jewish {{population}} {{rebelled against}} the Roman Empire {{in what is}} now known as the First Jewish–Roman War or Great Revolt. Roman legions under future emperor Titus reconquered and subsequently destroyed much of Jerusalem in 70CE. Also the Second Temple was burnt and <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>remained</b> <b>was</b> the great external (retaining) walls supporting the esplanade on which the Temple had stood, a portion of which has become known as the Western Wall. Titus' victory is commemorated by the Arch of Titus in Rome. AgrippaII died c. 94CE, which brought the Herodian dynasty to an end almost thirty years after the destruction of the Second Temple. After the end of this revolt, Jews continued to live in Jerusalem in significant numbers, and were allowed to practice their religion, only if they paid the Jewish Tax.|$|E

50|$|Nearly all of {{the public}} lands in the region had been claimed by 1912. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>remained</b> <b>were</b> {{extremely}} isolated or undesirable sections. Between November 1910 and 1917, a total of 18,919 land patents were issued for 8933257 acre of land.|$|R
50|$|The town {{began its}} decline when the Ratcliff Mine, in Pleasant Canyon east of town, {{suspended}} operations. Other mines nearby {{also began to}} play out, and in 1917 the post office closed and <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>remained</b> <b>were</b> a few diehard prospectors and desert rats.|$|R
25|$|The {{next major}} {{operation}} was Operation DRAGOON, {{the invasion of}} southern France. The Mediterranean theatre's troop carrying aircraft had been drawn down by the requirements of OVERLORD, and the XII Troop Carrier Command (Provisional) had been disbanded. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>remained</b> <b>was</b> the 51st Troop Carrier Wing, albeit at full strength following the return of a detachment from China Burma India Theater. General Eisenhower agreed to send the 50th Troop Carrier Wing and 53rd Troop Carrier Wing {{with a total of}} 416 aircraft. In addition, 12 pathfinder planes were sent, bringing with them radar and visual aids, and pathfinder teams from the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions. The planes flew from the United Kingdom to Italy via Gibraltar or Marrakech and moved to recently captured airfields in the Rome area. They brought with them 225 glider pilots. To provide co-pilots for the gliders, another 375 despatched by the Air Transport Command. Only about 140 gliders were on hand, but the US War Department agreed to ship another 350 on the next convoy. They had to be given special priority in order to clear the congested port of Naples, but by 9 August, 327 gliders had been delivered and assembled.|$|E
500|$|<b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>remained</b> <b>was</b> {{to find a}} {{suitable}} site for the new zoo. Gillespie hoped for a site with plenty of sun and with shelter {{from the north and}} east winds. He also intended the zoo to be cheaply and quickly accessible via public transport. The society secured an option to purchase the [...] Corstorphine Hill House estate for £17,000. The house had been built in 1793 as the home of Scottish accountant William Keith. Its current Scottish Baronial architecture is mostly thanks to remodelling by the Macmillan family in 1891.|$|E
500|$|Brownlee {{attempted}} to leverage {{his relationship with}} King to win provincial control of natural resources. [...] He won such an agreement in 1926, but it was soon scuttled by the federal addition of a clause requiring Alberta to continue supporting separate Roman Catholic schools. [...] Wrangling over this clause persisted until 1929, when a compromise was reached. [...] <b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>remained</b> <b>was</b> the question of compensation to Alberta for land given away by the federal government, {{and by the end}} of 1929 agreement on this too was reached. [...] Brownlee returned from Ottawa to Alberta, where he was greeted by 3,000 cheering supporters.|$|E
50|$|In 1946 the war {{was over}} and Camp Forrest and Northern Field were {{declared}} surplus property. Buildings were sold at auction, torn down and carted away. Water and sewage systems and electrical systems were sold as salvage. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>remained</b> <b>were</b> roads, brick chimneys and concrete foundations.|$|R
50|$|PIR {{is built}} on the former {{location}} of Vanport, Oregon, which was destroyed on Memorial Day, May 30, 1948, when a dike on the Columbia River broke and flooded the city. After the flood, <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>remained</b> <b>were</b> the paved streets and concrete foundations of destroyed buildings.|$|R
50|$|In {{time the}} Empire fragmented, and the resurgent nomads broke {{many of the}} {{successor}} states dotted across the Northern Plains, until <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>remained</b> <b>were</b> isolated city states, mostly on the coast. In the south the Empire endured until it too was smashed by wars with the desert nomads.|$|R
500|$|The Act {{was drafted}} by Haldane, {{in the winter of}} 1906, with the {{assistance}} of John Kemp and Frederick Liddell and the support of Douglas Haig. A final draft was sent to the King on 12 January and <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>remained</b> <b>was</b> to ensure its passage through the House of Commons. He was confident of the support of the Prime Minister, and privately discussed the bill with Arthur Balfour, the Leader of the Opposition, in order to ensure there would not be significant Conservative Party opposition. At the time, the governing Liberal Party was mostly absorbed with problems of social reform, and it was not guaranteed that there would be time to present a defence bill. At the beginning of the year, however, Haldane discovered that a bill scheduled for the session was not yet ready, and offered [...] "a small Bill of his own which might conveniently fill the gap".|$|E
500|$|In September 1942, MacArthur {{decided to}} outflank Japanese {{troops on the}} Kokoda Trail by sending an American regimental combat team over the Owen Stanley Range. Two {{alternate}} means of crossing the mountains seemed possible. One, the Kapa Kapa Trail was known to climb to elevations above [...] and present formidable obstacles. The other, known as the Abau Trail held the possibility. Casey and Sverdrup took charge of investigating the Abau Trail. They reached Abau on 18 September. Casey explored the harbor, taking depth soundings from a native canoe. Sverdrup set out for Jaure with a party of one American, two Australians from the Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit, ten native police from the Royal Papuan Constabulary and 26 native carriers. After eight days on the trail, scaling heights of , Sverdrup concluded {{that it would not}} be practical for troops to traverse the route and turned back, reaching Abau on 3 October. Meanwhile Casey had concluded that the harbor was too shallow even for lighters. However, the trip was not a total loss, for Sverdrup had sighted a plateau north of the Owen Stanley Range that he believed could be suitable for airstrips, allowing troops to be flown across the Owen Stanley Range. His opinion was supported by Cecil Abel, a missionary who knew the area well, who recommended establishing an airstrip at Fasari in the Musa River valley. Abel was flown to Fasari to make a start on an airstrip on 11 October, while Sverdrup set out from Abau with 190 men, including Flight Lieutenant M. J. Leahy, an expert on Papua, who knew many of the tribal chiefs personally. They reached Fasari on 18 October. Abel had cleared the site by burning and <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>remained</b> <b>was</b> some stumping and grubbing. A DC-3 was able to land the next day on the strip, which became known as Abel's Landing. Sverdrup and Leahy set out on 20 October to explore further north and found another suitable airstrip site near the village of Embessa and Kinjaki, which Sverdrup had cleared. A message dropped by air instructed him to go to Pongani, where he found troops of Company C, 114th Engineer Battalion that had flown to Wanigela airstrip and had made their way to Pongani by travelling along the coast by boat. Sverdrup supervised the construction of Pongani airstrip. All three airstrips were soon in use. In December 1942, Sverdrup made a third trip, from the Australian base at Bena Bena through the Markham Valley to the vicinity of the Japanese base at Lae. On each expedition he submitted detailed reports on the possibility of construction in the area. Sverdrup was awarded the Silver Star. His citation read: ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{trial began}} September 15, 1864 and lasted four months, with the Navy {{questioning}} {{fewer than a}} dozen transactions among 12,554 items totalling $1.2 million in government purchases from the Smith Brothers. Only one article [...] a delivery of Revely Tin metal was supplied instead of the Banca variety [...] shorted the Navy, by $100200. Predictably, the trial ended in judgment against the defendants, who were sentenced to two years in prison and fined $25,000. The judgment and sentence were approved by the Secretary of the Navy; <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>remained</b> <b>was</b> a presidential sanction.|$|E
2500|$|In 1911 the new {{propeller}} steamer Nisqually was built at Quartermaster Harbor and {{acquired by the}} Olympia Tacoma Navigation Co. to replace Greyhound, which was then relegated to relief boat service. [...] By 1924, Greyhound {{had been out of}} service for many years, and <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>remained</b> <b>was</b> her hull. [...] She was still in good enough shape to warrant hauling her out in Tacoma in 1924, for repair, caulking and painting. [...] Just what happened to her hull is not clear, probably it was just left to rot on a beach or a mud bank like so many others had been.|$|E
2500|$|In the baptism service, {{the signing}} with the cross was moved {{until after the}} baptism and the exorcism, the anointing, the putting on of the chrysom robe and the triple {{immersion}} were omitted. Most drastic {{of all was the}} removal of the Burial service from church: it was to take place at the graveside [...] In 1549, there had been provision for a Requiem (not so called) and prayers of commendation and committal, the first addressed to the deceased. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>remained</b> <b>was</b> a single reference to the deceased, giving thanks for their delivery from 'the myseryes of this sinneful world'. This new Order for the Burial of the Dead was a drastically stripped-down memorial service designed to undermine definitively the whole complex of traditional beliefs about Purgatory and intercessory prayer [...]|$|E

2500|$|The figurehead of the Centurion, a [...] lion, was {{presented}} to the Duke of Richmond by George III when the ship was broken up. It was used for a while as an inn sign at Goodwood, but William IV asked for it from the Duke, and used it as a staircase ornament at Windsor Castle. The King later on presented it to Greenwich Hospital, with directions to place it in one of the wards, which he desired should be called the Anson Ward. It remained there until 1871 when it was removed to the playground of the Naval School, where owing to the action of the weather it unfortunately crumbled to pieces. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>remained</b> <b>was</b> a four-foot high lion’s paw which was eventually recognised as a piece of significant historical interest and returned to Shugborough Hall during the 1920s. [...] Today it adorns a wall in the mansion house's Verandah Passage.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} reredos and altar {{screen at}} Beverley Minster was erected in {{the reign of}} Edward III between c. 1320 and 1340. At {{the time of the}} dissolution of the Beverley College of Secular Canons in 1547, [...] the eastern face of the screen remained nearly as it was when built but the statuary on the western front was demolished and much of the carving mutilated. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>remained</b> <b>was</b> covered over with plaster upon which was painted the Commandments, the Lord's Prayer and the Apostles' Creed. [...] In 1825–26 the reredos was rebuilt by Mr. Comins, the master mason, but this reconstruction fell short of filling the 12 niches and decorating the 36 panels. In 1897, [...] and to John Loughborough Pearson’s designs, Churches carved twelve statues for the screen, this due to the generosity of Canon Nolloth who put up the required funds. Nolloth also funded completion of the thirty six panels which were filled by opus sectile mosaic by Messrs. Powell.

2500|$|Kumas wreck was {{discovered}} in March 2004 {{by a group of}} divers including Australian explorer Kevin Denlay [...] operating off the research vessel MV Empress, based out of Singapore. The wreck was found to be on its starboard side in [...] of water, covered in fishing nets and snagged fishing lines. The bridge structure was fairly intact, although half-buried in bottom silt, and her funnels had fallen off. The port side waist 5.5-inch gun was basically intact, as were the two on the fore-deck, although the top of the waist mount enclosure had partially disintegrated. The circular rotating base of the forward port torpedo rack was intact, but there were no torpedo tubes mounted on it. However, the aft port rotating torpedo tube mount had completely fallen off the ship. The glass in many of the portholes, especially amidships, has been melted and fused due to the intensity of the fire that raged while the vessel was sinking. The ship's stern was missing completely aft of where the torpedoes hit; <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>remained</b> <b>was</b> a jagged edge, although the outboard port propeller and shaft were still visible protruding from the wreck.|$|E
