They dream about a perfect America where effort and morals will lead to good fortune. However, they must seek to attain this perfection during a period characterized by Prohibition and xenophobic anti-immigration legislation. Middlesex depicts the tribulations of attaining an identity, especially while dealing with the revelation that the <b>American</b> <b>Dream</b> is a delusion that has already disappeared.|$|E

5|$|Plans {{were made}} to improve Route 3 near the Meadowlands Sports Complex with the {{construction}} of <b>American</b> <b>Dream</b> Meadowlands. An overpass between eastbound Route 3 and northbound Route 120 was completed in May 2009 at a cost of $38.1 million, a flyover from southbound Route 120 to eastbound Route 3 was completed in early 2010 at a cost of $13 million, and improvements to the New Jersey Turnpike interchange was completed in the later part of 2010 at a cost of $49 million.|$|E
5|$|Production {{was led by}} West himself, {{alongside}} a variety of high-profile record producers including Mike Dean, No I.D., Jeff Bhasker, RZA, S1, Bink and DJ Frank E. Noted by critics for its maximalist aesthetic, opulent production quality, and dichotomous themes, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy incorporates aspects of West's previous works, including soul, baroque, electro, and symphonic styles. The album deals with themes of excess and celebrity, and explores such issues as consumer culture, race, and the idealism of the <b>American</b> <b>Dream.</b>|$|E

5|$|Primarily a coming-of-age story (Bildungsroman) {{and family}} saga, the novel chronicles {{the effect of}} a mutated gene on three generations of a Greek family, causing momentous changes in the protagonist's life. According to scholars, the novel's main themes are nature versus nurture, rebirth, and the differing {{experiences}} of what society constructs as polar oppositesâ€”such as those found between men and women. It discusses the pursuit of the <b>American</b> <b>Dream</b> and explores gender identity. The novel contains many allusions to Greek mythology, including creatures such as the Minotaur, half-man and half-bull, and the Chimera, a monster composed of various animal parts.|$|E
5|$|The <b>American</b> <b>Dream,</b> or the {{perception}} that Americans enjoy high social mobility, {{plays a key role}} in attracting immigrants. Whether this perception is realistic has been a topic of debate. While mainstream culture holds that the United States is a classless society, scholars identify significant differences between the country's social classes, affecting socialization, language, and values. Americans' self-images, social viewpoints, and cultural expectations are associated with their occupations to an unusually close degree. While Americans tend greatly to value socioeconomic achievement, being ordinary or average is generally seen as a positive attribute.|$|E

5|$|The Great Gatsby is a 1925 novel {{written by}} American author F. Scott Fitzgerald that follows {{a cast of}} {{characters}} living in the fictional town of West Egg on prosperous Long Island {{in the summer of}} 1922. The story primarily concerns the young and mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his quixotic passion and obsession for the beautiful former debutante Daisy Buchanan. Considered to be Fitzgerald's magnum opus, The Great Gatsby explores themes of decadence, idealism, resistance to change, social upheaval, and excess, creating a portrait of the Jazz Age or the Roaring Twenties that {{has been described as a}} cautionary tale regarding the <b>American</b> <b>Dream.</b>|$|E
5|$|Author Jeremy Rifkin had {{previously}} written several books that, like The Empathic Civilization, {{have attempted to}} extrapolate trends in the economy, technology, and society. For example, his 1995 book The End of Work concerns the changes that tele-commuting {{would have on the}} workplace, his 1998 book The Biotech Century concerns the expected impacts of genetic engineering, and his 2002 book The Hydrogen Economy concerns the economic and social effects that will result from the expected replacement of fossil fuels with hydrogen as an energy storage medium. His last book before writing The Empathic Civilization was The European Dream, published in 2004, comparing the <b>American</b> <b>Dream</b> with the values expressed by Europeans in the post-industrial economy. At the time of publication, the 64-year-old Rifkin was working as an advisor to the European Union concerning issues relating to the economy, climate change, and energy security, as well as president of the American non-profit organization the Foundation on Economic Trends.|$|E
5|$|Calhoun's father, Patrick Calhoun, {{helped shape}} his son's {{political}} views. He was a staunch supporter of slavery who taught his son that social standing depended not merely on {{a commitment to}} the ideal of popular self-government but also on the ownership of a substantial number of slaves. Flourishing {{in a world in which}} slaveholding was a hallmark of civilization, Calhoun saw little reason to question its morality as an adult. He further believed that slavery instilled in the remaining whites a code of honor that blunted the disruptive potential of private gain and fostered the civic-mindedness that lay near the core of the republican creed. From such a standpoint, the expansion of slavery decreased the likelihood for social conflict and postponed the declension when money would become the only measure of self-worth, as had happened in New England. Calhoun was thus firmly convinced that slavery was the key to the success of the <b>American</b> <b>dream.</b>|$|E

5|$|I think {{everyone}} who disses the Columbine RPG is gutless. Most haven't played the game, or have played it with such preconceptions that they're blinded to the genuis , the honesty, {{the beauty of}} its social commentary. Super Columbine Massacre RPG is riddled with design flaws and has mediocre graphics by 1995, the maker of the game admits this, but it regardless {{is a work of}} art. It puts you in the mindset of the killers and provides a very clear suggestion of why they did what they did; they were enacting an ideological demonstration through a terrorist act, and the game shines light on this as an indictment of the <b>American</b> <b>dream</b> and way of life painfully close to the main nerve.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the {{movement}} has drawn many followers from {{the middle class and}} is most popular in commuter towns and urban areas. In Exporting the American Gospel: Global Christian Fundamentalism Steve Brouwer, Paul Gifford, and Susan Rose speculate that {{the movement}} was fueled by a prevailing disdain for social liberalism in the United States that began in the 1970s. Rosin argues that prosperity theology emerged because of broader trends, particularly American economic optimism in the 1950s and 1990s. Tony Lin of the University of Virginia has also compared the teaching to manifest destiny, the 19th-century belief that the United States was entitled to the West. Marvin Harris argues that the doctrine's focus on the material world is a symptom of the secularization of American religion. He sees it as an attempt to fulfill the <b>American</b> <b>Dream</b> by using supernatural power.|$|E
5|$|Since Reagan {{left office}} in 1989, {{substantial}} debate has occurred among scholars, historians, {{and the general}} public surrounding his legacy. Supporters have pointed to a more efficient and prosperous economy as a result of Reagan's economic policies, foreign policy triumphs including a peaceful end to the Cold War, and a restoration of American pride and morale. Proponents also argue Reagan restored faith in the <b>American</b> <b>Dream</b> with his unabated and passionate love for the United States, after a decline in American confidence and self-respect under Jimmy Carter's perceived weak leadership, particularly during the Iran hostage crisis, as well as his gloomy, dreary outlook {{for the future of the}} United States during the 1980 election. Critics contend that Reagan's economic policies resulted in rising budget deficits, a wider gap in wealth, and an increase in homelessness and that the Iranâ€“Contra affair lowered American credibility.|$|E
