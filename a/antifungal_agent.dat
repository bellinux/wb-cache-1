40|$|A {{number of}} triazoles are broad {{spectrum}} <b>antifungal</b> <b>agents</b> used as pesticides and pharmaceuticals. They inhibit the biosynthesis of ergosterol, {{which is an}} essential component of fungal membranes. Triazole <b>antifungal</b> <b>agents</b> are extensively used. The general population can be exposed {{as a result of the}} use of triazole pharmaceuticals and through consumption of food or water containing triazole pesticide residues. Occupational exposure may occur to workers involved in the manufacture or use of triazole <b>antifungal</b> <b>agents.</b> Triazole moiety Triazole <b>antifungal</b> <b>agents</b> (as a chemical group) passed the animal data screen, underwent a preliminary toxicological evaluation, and are being brought to the Carcinogen Identification Committee (CIC) for consultation.

25|$|Thiomersal's main use is as an {{antiseptic}} and <b>antifungal</b> <b>agent,</b> {{due to the}} oligodynamic effect. In multidose injectable {{drug delivery}} systems, it prevents serious adverse effects such as the Staphylococcus infection that, in one 1928 incident, killed 12 of 21 children vaccinated with a diphtheria vaccine that lacked a preservative. Unlike other vaccine preservatives used at the time, thiomersal does not reduce the potency of the vaccines that it protects. Bacteriostatics such as thiomersal are not needed in single-dose injectables.|$|E
25|$|Many {{inhibitor}}s of glycosyltransferases are known. Some {{of these}} are natural products, such as moenomycin, an inhibitor of peptidoglycan glycosyltransferases, the nikkomycins, inhibitors of chitin synthase, and the echinocandins, inhibitors of fungal b-1,3-glucan synthases. Some glycosyltransferase inhibitors are of use as drugs or antibiotics. Moenomycin is used in animal feed as a growth promoter. Caspofungin has been developed from the echinocandins and is in use as an <b>antifungal</b> <b>agent.</b> Ethambutol is an inhibitor of mycobacterial arabinotransferases and {{is used for the}} treatment of tuberculosis.

40|$|Recovery of Candida spp. {{using the}} BD Bactec FX blood culture (BC) system (Bactec Plus Aerobic/F medium) and the VersaTREK system (aerobic Redox medium) was {{evaluated}} using seeded BC bottles {{with and without}} the addition of commonly used <b>antifungal</b> <b>agents.</b> BC bottles (n = 1, 442) were each inoculated with 10 ml human whole blood and 0. 1 ml of suspensions of Candida spp., with or without <b>antifungal</b> <b>agents.</b> BC bottles were incubated in the corresponding system for a maximum of 5 days. In the absence of <b>antifungal</b> <b>agents,</b> Bactec FX recovered 97. 4 % of Candida spp., and VersaTREK recovered 99. 1 % (P = 0. 154). With regard to length of time to detection (LTD) and overall recovery, both systems had various levels of effectiveness in recovering C. glabrata. In bottles containing <b>antifungal</b> <b>agents,</b> Bactec FX recovered 83. 1 % of isolates, whereas VersaTREK recovered 50. 7 % of Candida spp. (P < 0. 001). For BC bottles without the addition of <b>antifungal</b> <b>agents,</b> the median LTD for VersaTREK was 2. 2 h faster than that of Bactec FX (P < 0. 001). In the presence of <b>antifungal</b> <b>agents,</b> the Bactec FX recovery time was significantly faster than that of VersaTREK (median difference of 10. 8 h, P < 0. 001). We conclude that both systems have comparable abilities to recover Candida spp. from seeded blood cultures {{in the absence of}} <b>antifungal</b> <b>agents.</b> In the presence of therapeutic levels of commonly used <b>antifungal</b> <b>agents,</b> the Bactec FX system demonstrated a significantly greater recovery of various Candida spp., as well as a shorter LTD...|$|R

25|$|The most {{commonly}} described technique, known as sparing, involves using an <b>antifungal</b> <b>agent</b> to clear spores from airways adjacent to corticosteroid therapy. The antifungal aspect aims to reduce fungal causes of bronchial inflammation, whilst also minimising the dose of corticosteroid required {{to reduce the}} immune system’s input to disease progression. The strongest evidence (double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trials) is for itraconazole twice daily for four months, which resulted in significant clinical improvement compared to placebo, and was mirrored in CF patients. Using itraconazole appears to outweigh the risk from long-term and high-dose prednisone. Newer triazole drugs—such as posaconazole or voriconazole—have not yet been studied in-depth through clinical trials in this context.|$|E
25|$|It is {{produced}} by the bacterium Streptomyces hygroscopicus and was isolated {{for the first time}} in 1972 by Surendra Nath Sehgal and colleagues from samples of Streptomyces hygroscopicus found on Easter Island. The compound was originally named rapamycin after the native name of the island, Rapa Nui. Sirolimus was initially developed as an <b>antifungal</b> <b>agent.</b> However, this use was abandoned when it was discovered to have potent immunosuppressive and antiproliferative properties due to its ability to inhibit mTOR. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in September 1999 and is marketed under the trade name Rapamune by Pfizer (formerly by Wyeth).|$|E

2500|$|Effective {{clinical}} {{treatments of}} infections caused by Exserohilum {{are still very}} scarce. Recent cases of sinusitis and cutaneous infections report successful results when treated with amphotericin B, itraconazole and/or voriconazole. Although E. rostratum is sensitive to amphotericin B, a common <b>antifungal</b> <b>agent,</b> the severe and potentially lethal side-effects of this drug have limited its use in certain patients, particularly those of older age. A recent drug repurposing screening of antifungal agents suggests the triazoles posaconazole and lanoconazole as useful alternative agents for treating E. rostratum infection. Posaconazole is highly potent and can be taken orally for the prolonged treatment of non-CNS infections like septic joints. It {{has also been shown}} to cross the blood-brain barrier and thus has potential as a treatment for CNS infections as well, though not reaching levels as high as the azoles.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Tissue conditioners {{are used}} for healing of abused oral tissues. They may harbour {{microorganisms}} causing oral diseases such as candidiasis compromising {{the health of the}} patient. Also, addition of <b>antifungal</b> <b>agents</b> into tissue conditioner may alter its properties. This study compares the anti-fungal property and mechanical properties of tissue conditioner containing different <b>antifungal</b> <b>agents.</b> Methods: Three <b>antifungal</b> <b>agents,</b> one synthetic – fluconazole, and two natural - oregano oil and virgin coconut oil were added into the tissue conditioner (Viscogel) in different concentrations. The antifungal property, tensile bond strength and viscoelasticity of Viscogel containing these <b>antifungal</b> <b>agents</b> were assessed after 24 hours, three days and seven days. Results: While, the highest antifungal activity was shown by Viscogel containing fluconazole, the maximum tensile bond strength was found to be of Viscogel alone (control). Although Viscogel alone and in combination of fluconazole showed deterioration in viscoelasticity, Viscogel in combination of natural agents showed no significant changes over the period of seven days. Conclusion: Incorporation of the natural agents in the tissue conditioner can be used as an effective alternative to systemic or topical synthetic <b>antifungal</b> <b>agents...</b>|$|R

40|$|Candida infections {{have created}} a great burden on the public {{healthcare}} sector. The situation is worsened by recent epidemiological changes. Furthermore, the current arsenal of <b>antifungal</b> <b>agents</b> is limited and associated with undesirable drawbacks. Therefore, new <b>antifungal</b> <b>agents</b> that surpass the existing ones are urgently needed. High-throughput screening of small molecule libraries enables rapid hit identification and, possibly, increases hit rate. Moreover, the identified hits could be associated with unrecognized or multiple drug targets, which would provide novel insights into the biological processes of the pathogen. Hence, it is proposed that high-throughput screening of small molecules is particularly important {{in the pursuit of}} the ideal <b>antifungal</b> <b>agents</b> for Candida infections...|$|R
