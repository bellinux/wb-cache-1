5|$|Augustine {{believed}} that a physical Hell exists, but that physical punishment is secondary to the punishment of being separated from God. He proposed two reasons for this: Firstly, humans have free will, and only those who choose to follow God will be forgiven and able to avoid Hell. Secondly, he {{believed that}} Adam and Eve's choice to sin affected our free choice, and that humans are left unable to resist sin. Augustine proposed that the grace of Jesus Christ freed humans from original sin, but he maintained that humans can only be saved {{if they choose to}} receive grace, and that this choice is formed by the character of individual humans. Accepting that even those who will be saved continue to sin, Augustine proposed that those who choose God's grace will still go to Hell for <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> purge them of their sin, before going to Heaven.|$|E
5|$|Constantine IV {{used the}} peace to proceed against the {{mounting}} Bulgar menace in the Balkans, but his huge army, comprising {{all the available}} forces of the Empire, was decisively beaten, opening {{the way for the}} establishment of a Bulgar state in the northeastern Balkans. In the Muslim world, after the death of Mu'awiya in 680, the various forces of opposition within the Caliphate manifested themselves. The Caliphate's division during this Second Muslim Civil War allowed Byzantium to achieve not only peace, but also a position of predominance on its eastern frontier. Armenia and Iberia reverted for <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> Byzantine control, and Cyprus became a condominium between Byzantium and the Caliphate. The peace lasted until Justinian II (r. 685–695 and 705–711) broke it in 693, with devastating consequences: the Byzantines were defeated, Justinian was deposed and a twenty-year period of anarchy followed. Muslim incursions intensified, leading to a second Arab attempt at conquering Constantinople in 717–718, which also proved unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|Creutz {{became a}} professor, {{the head of}} the Physics Department, and the head of Nuclear Research Center at the Carnegie Institute of Technology in 1948.

In addition to his work on nuclear physics, he cultivated flowers and orchids at his home. He published eight papers on floral species, and named three varieties of violets after his children. One 1966 paper, published in the New York Botanical Garden Journal was on Apetahia raiateensis, a rare flower found only on the island of Raiatea in French Polynesia. He travelled to Polynesia many times, and translated Grammar of the Tahitian language from French into English.

5|$|Despite the UERL's {{success in}} {{financing}} and constructing the railway, its opening {{did not bring}} the financial success that had been expected. In the Bakerloo Tube's first twelve months of operation it carried 20.5million passengers, less than sixty per cent of the 35million that had been predicted during the planning of the line. The UERL's pre-opening predictions of passenger numbers for its other new lines proved to be similarly over-optimistic, as did the projected figures for the newly electrified DR– in each case, numbers achieved only around fifty per cent of their targets. 37,000 people used the line on the first day, but {{in the months following}} the line's opening only about 20,000–30,000 passengers a day used the service. The number of carriages used by the BS was cut back to three per train at peak times and only two during off-peak hours. The Daily Mail reported in April 1906 that the rush-hour trains were carrying fewer than 100 people at <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> <b>To</b> add to the line's misfortunes, it suffered its first fatality only two weeks after opening when conductor John Creagh was crushed between a train and a tunnel wall at Kennington Road station on 26 March.|$|E
5|$|Earp {{resigned}} from the sheriff's office on November 9, 1880, and Shibell immediately appointed Behan as the new deputy sheriff for eastern Pima County. Democrat Johnny Behan had considerably more political experience than Republican Wyatt Earp. Behan had previously served as Yavapai County sheriff from 1871 to 1873. He had been elected to the Arizona Territorial Legislature twice, representing Yavapai Country in the 7th Territorial Legislature in 1873 and Mohave County in the 10th in 1879. Behan moved for <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> the northwest Arizona Territory, where he served as the Mohave County recorder in 1877 and then deputy sheriff of Mohave County at Gillet, in 1879.|$|E
5|$|Edward Norton {{flew out}} to Austin and met Malick, {{who had been}} {{impressed}} by the actor's screen test for Primal Fear. Matthew McConaughey reportedly took a day off filming <b>A</b> <b>Time</b> <b>to</b> Kill to see Malick. Others followed, including William Baldwin, Edward Burns, Josh Hartnett, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Stephen Dorff, and Leonardo DiCaprio; the latter flew up from the Mexico set of Romeo + Juliet to meet Malick at the American Airlines lounge in the Austin airport. Before the casting was finalized, Nicolas Cage had lunch with Malick in Hollywood in February 1996. Malick went off to scout locations and tried calling Cage that summer {{only to find out}} that his phone number had been disconnected. Tom Sizemore, however, was offered a more substantial role in Saving Private Ryan and, when he could not contact Malick for several days, decided to do Steven Spielberg's film instead. Actors Bill Pullman, Mickey Rourke, and Lukas Haas filmed scenes for the movie but were cut from the final film due to time contraints. Publicity stills of Pullman (as Sgt. MacTae, in a scene opposite Brody and Chaplin) can be seen online, Haas is pictured in the booklet of the CD soundtrack, and one of Rourke's scenes was restored for the Criterion Blu-Ray/DVD release of the film.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the war, the government's immediate response was to announce on 5 September 1939 that it would begin calling up 10,000 militiamen at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> provide sixteen days continuous service manning guard posts at selected points around the country. This was later expanded on 15 September to include all of the Militia, in two drafts of 40,000 men, for one month's continuous training, however, the suspension on compulsory training introduced in 1929 was not amended until January 1940. On 5 September 1939 it was also announced that a division would be raised for overseas service, but there was still large-scale opposition to the concept of conscription and the provisions of the Defence Act still precluded conscripts from serving outside of Australian territory, so it was announced that this force would be raised from volunteers only and would not be raised directly from the Militia. Conscripts, however, were required to serve in the Militia, with the result being that the Militia's ranks were filled with both volunteers and conscripts during this time.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of the}} 20th century, the {{diagnosis}} of Alzheimer's disease was reserved for individuals {{between the ages of}} 45 and 65 who developed symptoms of dementia. The terminology changed after 1977 when a conference on AD concluded that the clinical and pathological manifestations of presenile and senile dementia were almost identical, although the authors also added that this did not {{rule out the possibility that}} they had different causes. This eventually led to {{the diagnosis}} of Alzheimer's disease independent of age. The term senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT) was used for <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> describe the condition in those over 65, with classical Alzheimer's disease being used to describe those who were younger. Eventually, the term Alzheimer's disease was formally adopted in medical nomenclature to describe individuals of all ages with a characteristic common symptom pattern, disease course, and neuropathology.|$|E
