5|$|Accumulated Cyclone Energy (<b>ACE)</b> is {{a measure}} of how active a {{hurricane}} season is. It is calculated by squaring the windspeed of a cyclone with at least tropical storm-force winds every six hours, summing the results, and dividing that total by 104. This explains why Hurricane Guillermo has a higher <b>ACE</b> than Linda. It was not as strong as that storm, but because it was above tropical storm force for a longer time, it reached a higher <b>ACE</b> level. As a tropical cyclone does not have gale-force winds until it becomes a tropical storm, tropical depressions are not included in these tables. For all storms, <b>ACE</b> is given to three significant figures. The <b>ACE</b> in the east Pacific proper (140°W to North America) is given; the <b>ACE</b> in the central Pacific (the international dateline to 140°W) is given in brackets.|$|E

50|$|<b>Aces</b> of the Deep is a World War II {{submarine}} simulator game {{developed and}} published by Dynamix for MS-DOS in 1994. The game was re-released by Sierra On-Line for Windows in 1995 as Command: <b>Aces</b> of the Deep. <b>Aces</b> of the Deep was the last installment of Dynamix's <b>Aces</b> series, which included the flight simulators Red Baron, <b>Aces</b> of the Pacific, and <b>Aces</b> Over Europe. However, unlike its predecessors, <b>Aces</b> of the Deep simulates a Kriegsmarine U-boat during World War II.|$|R
5|$|<b>Ace</b> Attorney Investigations 2 was {{produced}} by Motohide Eshiro and directed by Takeshi Yamazaki, and features character designs by Tatsuro Iwamoto and music by Noriyuki Iwadare. Takuro Fuse, who would later become the character designer and art director for <b>Ace</b> Attorney, {{was in charge of}} the game's event images, and the opening and ending sequences to the episodes. While the original <b>Ace</b> Attorney Investigations had taken longer than usual for an <b>Ace</b> Attorney game to develop due to its several new gameplay systems that had to be created from scratch, <b>Ace</b> Attorney Investigations 2 went faster due to it already having a base game to build upon, resulting in the developers being able to put more focus on the game's story. According to Eshiro and Yamazaki, one of the major changes compared to the first <b>Ace</b> Attorney Investigations was the addition of an interrogation game mechanic; they chose to present it metaphorically as a game of chess, which was Edgeworth's favorite game. Another such change was the graphical improvements to the game's sprites and background art.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ace,</b> {{along with}} Ballantine Books, {{was one of}} the leading science fiction {{publishers}} for its first ten years of operation. With the death of owner A. A. Wyn in 1967, however, the company's fortunes began to decline. Two prominent editors, Donald A. Wollheim and Terry Carr, left in 1971, and in 1972 <b>Ace</b> was sold to Grosset & Dunlap. Despite financial troubles, there were further successes, particularly with the third <b>Ace</b> Science Fiction Specials series, for which Carr was the editor. Further mergers and acquisitions resulted in the company becoming a part of Berkley Books. <b>Ace</b> then became an imprint of Penguin Group (USA).|$|E
5|$|Before {{the release}} of <b>Ace,</b> Cascade Games was infamous for their Cassette 50 (1983) game {{compilation}} that featured simplistic and subpar games. Stevens points out that without the income from the compilation, the project {{would not have been}} possible. The developers estimate the production cost of <b>Ace</b> at £40k. Following {{the release of}} <b>Ace,</b> Cascade moved into mainstream AAA game development. Wilhelmy says that Cascade boasted over a million GBP in turnover over the following years. The company produced two sequels, <b>Ace</b> 2 (1987) and <b>ACE</b> 2088 (1989), and various other games before closing down in 1990.|$|E

50|$|To {{adjust for}} <b>aces,</b> Goren {{recommended}} deducting one HCP for an aceless hand and adding one for holding four <b>aces.</b> Some adjust for tens by adding 1/2 HCP for each. Alternatively, some treat <b>aces</b> and tens {{as a group}} and add one HCP if the hand contains three or more <b>aces</b> and tens; Richard Pavlicek advocates adding one HCP if holding four or more <b>aces</b> and tens.|$|R
5|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, <b>Ace</b> Books {{became a major}} {{division}} of the old publisher, Charter Communications, which was based out of the Hippodrome Building, 1120 Avenue of the Americas, in New York City. In 1972, <b>Ace</b> was acquired by Grosset & Dunlap, and in 1982, Grosset & Dunlap was in turn acquired by G.P. Putnam's Sons. <b>Ace</b> was reputedly the only profitable element of the Grosset & Dunlap empire by this time. <b>Ace</b> soon became the science fiction imprint of its parent company.|$|E
5|$|Carr {{returned}} to <b>Ace</b> Books in 1984 {{as a freelance}} editor, launching {{a new series of}} <b>Ace</b> Specials devoted entirely to first novels. This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, William Gibson's Neuromancer, Kim Stanley Robinson's The Wild Shore, Lucius Shepard's Green Eyes, and Michael Swanwick's In the Drift. All were first novels by authors now regarded as major figures in the sf genre. Other prominent sf publishing figures who have worked at <b>Ace</b> include Tom Doherty, who left to start Tor Books, and Jim Baen, who left to work at Tor and who eventually founded Baen Books. Writers who have worked at <b>Ace</b> include Frederik Pohl and Ellen Kushner.|$|E

5|$|The season's {{activity}} {{can be quantified}} in an accumulated cyclone energy (<b>ACE)</b> rating of 61. <b>ACE</b> is, broadly speaking, {{a measure of the}} power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed; therefore, storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high <b>ACE</b> ratings.|$|E
5|$|The season's {{activity}} {{was reflected in}} a low cumulative accumulated cyclone energy (<b>ACE)</b> rating of 32. <b>ACE</b> is, broadly speaking, {{a measure of the}} power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. <b>ACE</b> is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34knots (39mph, 63km/h) or tropical storm strength.|$|E
