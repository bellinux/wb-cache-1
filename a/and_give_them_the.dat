25|$|In 2006, {{due to a}} lack {{of action}} by all the state governments, the Supreme Court ordered the state governments to report to it why the reform {{measures}} outlined were not implemented. After being questioned in front of the judges of the Supreme Court, the state governments are finally starting to reform the police forces <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> operational independence they need for fearless and proper law enforcement. Tamil Nadu Police has been in the forefront of application of the new referendum.|$|E

In search of a visual style for their act, they remembered the poverty of their childhood and their ability to improvise, and used their experience to assemble a collection of vintage 1940s clothes from thrift shops, that would comprise their costumes <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> distinctive look they were searching for.|$|E

25|$|The {{story begins}} with the Israelites in slavery in Egypt. Moses leads them out of Egypt and through the {{wilderness}} to Mount Sinai, where Yahweh reveals himself and offers them a Covenant: they are to keep his torah (i.e. law, instruction), and in return he will be their god <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> land of Canaan. The Book of Leviticus records the laws of God. The Book of Numbers tells how the Israelites, led now by their god Yahweh, journey on from Sinai towards Canaan, but when their spies report that the land is filled with giants they refuse {{to go on and}} Yahweh condemns them to remain in the desert until the generation that left Egypt passes away. After thirty-eight years at the oasis of Kadesh Barnea the next generation travel on to the borders of Canaan, where Moses addresses them for the final time and gives them further laws. The Exodus ends with the death of Moses on Mount Nebo and his burial by God, while the Israelites prepare for the conquest of the land.|$|E
500|$|Leaving Victor Verster Prison on 11 February, Mandela held Winnie's hand {{in front}} of amassed crowds and the press; the event was {{broadcast}} live across the world. Driven to Cape Town's City Hall through crowds, he gave a speech declaring his commitment to peace and reconciliation with the white minority, but {{made it clear that the}} ANC's armed struggle was not over, and would continue as [...] "a purely defensive action against the violence of apartheid". He expressed hope that the government would agree to negotiations, so that [...] "there may no longer be the need for the armed struggle", and insisted that his main focus was to bring peace to the black majority <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> right to vote in national and local elections. Staying at Tutu's home, in the following days Mandela met with friends, activists, and press, giving a speech to an estimated 100,000 people at Johannesburg's Soccer City.|$|E
500|$|Kala {{is named}} after M.I.A.'s mother, in {{contrast}} to her previous album, Arular, which was named after her father. She contends that Arular was a [...] "masculine" [...] album, but that Kala [...] "is about my mum and her struggle–how do you work, feed your children, nurture them <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> power of information?" [...] She further summed the album up as [...] "shapes, colours, Africa, street, power, bitch, nu world, and brave." [...] According to Dominic Horner of The Independent, the album's music may not be appropriately described exclusively as either dance or world music, {{but it is a}} mixture of the two. Music critic Robert Christgau characterised its music as an [...] "eclectic world-underclass dance amalgam", and Jonathan Brown of the Irish Independent cited Kala as a proper introduction to [...] "world fusion", a genre that [...] "blends sounds from across the globe which wouldn't – and some say shouldn't – be put together." [...] By contrast, NPR's Oliver Wang argued that, rather than a [...] "so-called world music fusion" [...] attempt, Kala is [...] "agitated, propulsive pop" [...] informed by international sounds. Music journalist Jody Rosen called it [...] "an agitprop dance record" [...] that reappropriates hip hop in an international setting with beatbox riddims, [...] "playground" [...] rhymes, unconventional samples, and gunshot sounds.|$|E

500|$|The Radcliffe Commission, {{dividing}} Bengal and Punjab, {{completed its}} work and reported to Mountbatten on 12 August; the last Viceroy held the maps until the 17th, {{not wanting to}} spoil the independence celebrations in both nations. There had already been ethnically charged violence and movement of populations; publication of the Radcliffe Line dividing the new nations sparked mass migration, murder, and ethnic cleansing. Many on the [...] "wrong side" [...] of the lines fled or were murdered, or murdered others, hoping to make {{facts on the ground}} which would reverse the commission's verdict. [...] Radcliffe wrote in his report that he knew that neither side would be happy with his award; he declined his fee for the work. [...] Christopher Beaumont, Radcliffe's private secretary, later wrote that Mountbatten [...] "must take the blame—though not the sole blame—for the massacres in the Punjab in which between 500,000 to a million men, women and children perished". As many as 14,500,000 people relocated between India and Pakistan during and after partition. Jinnah did what he could for the eight million people who migrated to Pakistan; although by now over 70 and frail from lung ailments, he travelled across West Pakistan and personally supervised the provision of aid. According to Ahmed, [...] "What Pakistan needed desperately in those early months was a symbol of the state, one that would unify people <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> courage and resolve to succeed." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{multiple}} {{murders of}} Mexican journalists, senators made {{a proposal for}} a new law stating that journalists who are attacked would be guaranteed medical care.

2500|$|In March 1823, Canning {{declared}} that [...] "when a whole nation revolts against its conqueror, the nation cannot {{be considered as}} piratical but as a nation {{in a state of}} war". In February 1823 he notified the Ottoman Empire that Britain would maintain friendly relations with the Turks only under the condition that the latter respected the Christian subjects of the Empire. The Commissioner of the Ionian Islands, which belonged to Britain, was ordered to consider the Greeks in a state of war <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> right to cut off certain areas from which the Turks could get provisions.|$|E

2500|$|The {{capture of}} the Union guns turned the tide of battle. Although McDowell had brought 15 regiments into the fight on the hill, outnumbering the Confederates two to one, {{no more than two}} were ever engaged simultaneously. Jackson {{continued}} to press his attacks, telling soldiers of the 4th Virginia Infantry, [...] "Reserve your fire until they come within 50 yards! Then fire <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> bayonet! And when you charge, yell like furies!" [...] For the first time, Union troops heard the disturbing sound of the Rebel yell. At about 4 p.m., the last Union troops were pushed off Henry House Hill by a charge of two regiments from Col. Philip St. George Cocke's brigade.|$|E
2500|$|Tensions between first generation, , {{and second}} generation, , Japanese-Canadians were {{exacerbated}} during internment. The language gap that many [...] dealt with was intensified {{when they were}} given instructions within the camp. This often left children, whose English was generally better, to translate for their mothers <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> commands. This led to an imbalance in power between mothers and their children. Due {{to their ability to}} understand English better than their mothers, children often found themselves in a position of power over their mothers. Mothers were no longer the guardians and could not shield their children from adult responsibilities. Because of this, children were forced to grow up and accept these positions of power before they were of an appropriate age.|$|E
2500|$|The {{children}} {{were one of}} the chief inspirations for producing the Living Bible. Our family devotions were tough going because of the difficulty we had understanding the King James Version, which we were then using, or the Revised Standard Version, which we used later. All too often I would ask questions to be sure the children understood, and they would shrug their shoulders—they didn't know what the passage was talking about. So I would explain it. I would paraphrase it for them <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> thought. It suddenly occurred to me one afternoon that I should write out the reading for that evening thought by thought, rather than doing it on the spot during our devotional time. So I did, and read the chapter to the family that evening with exciting results—they knew the answers to all the questions I asked! ...|$|E

2500|$|Half {{a million}} people had starved in Somalia when President George H. W. Bush ordered U.S. troops to enter the country on a {{humanitarian}} mission. [...] As clans started fighting over the aid, the humanitarian mission quickly became a struggle against Mohamed Farah Aideed. [...] The CIA station in Somalia had been shuttered for two years. [...] The CIA was given an impossible mission in Somalia, as was the military. [...] Casualties came quickly and were high in the eight man team the CIA sent. [...] A post mortem carried out by now FISA member Admiral Crowe stated that the National Security Council had expected the CIA to both make decisions, <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> intelligence to base those decisions on. [...] The NSC couldn't understand why intelligence didn't advise them correctly on what to do. [...] Bill Clinton entered the ranks of Presidents unhappy {{with the results of}} the CIA; Clinton's inattention to the CIA did not help the matter.|$|E
2500|$|Ultimately, U2 {{felt that}} Pop {{had not been}} {{completed}} to their satisfaction. The Edge described the finished album as [...] "a compromise project by the end. It was a crazy period trying to mix everything and finish recording and having production meetings about the upcoming tour... If you can't mix something, it generally means there's something wrong with it..." [...] Mullen said, [...] "If we had {{two or three more}} months to work, we would have had a very different record. I would like someday to rework those songs <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> attention and time that they deserve." [...] McGuinness disagrees that the band did not have enough time, saying, [...] "It got an awful lot of time, actually. I think it suffered from too many cooks [...] There were so many people with a hand in that record it wasn't surprising to me that it didn't come through as clearly as it might have done... It was also the first time I started to think that technology was getting out of control." [...] The band ended up re-working and re-recording many songs for the album's singles, {{as well as for the}} band's 2002 compilation The Best of 1990-2000.|$|E
2500|$|Around 4 p.m, Tyler {{attacked}} Fulkerson and Garnett {{by using}} an unorthodox approach with his brigade in [...] "close column of divisions"—a brigade front of two companies with 48 companies lined up behind them in 24 lines, in all about 75 yards wide, and 400 yards long, a formation difficult to control and lacking offensive power at the front. The Confederates were temporarily able to counter this attack with their inferior numbers by firing fierce volleys from behind the stone wall. Jackson, finally realizing {{the strength of the}} force opposing him, sent out Col. Jesse Burks's brigade, which had been held in reserve, but by the time they arrived around 6 p.m., Garnett's Stonewall Brigade had run out of ammunition and he pulled them back, leaving Fulkerson's right flank exposed. Panic set in among the Confederates, and as Burks's brigade arrived, it was caught in the fleeing mob and forced to retreat. Jackson tried in vain to rally his troops. He called out to a soldier [...] "Where are you going, man?" [...] The soldier replied that he was out of ammunition. [...] "Then go back <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> bayonet!" [...] Jackson said. However, the soldier ignored him and kept running. Kimball organized no effective pursuit. That night, a cavalryman sat with Jackson by a campfire alongside the Valley Pike and jokingly said [...] "It was reported that they were retreating, General, but I guess they were retreating after us." [...] Jackson, not known for his sense of humor, replied, [...] "I think I am satisfied, sir." ...|$|E

2500|$|Goblins are reptilian fairies, often {{described}} as upright, raptor like creatures (minus the claws and feathers). They are quite stupid as they have brains the size of rats, but they can still talk and (to a certain extent) work machinery like lasers and sometimes even computers. They {{have the ability to}} create fireballs in their hands, or shoot them through their nostrils (sometimes by inhaling fireballs created in their own hands). Groups of goblins are involved in an ongoing turf war with groups of dwarves. They make their clothing from their own shed skin. In Book 3, Holly describes goblins as [...] "Evolution's little joke", with the reasoning, [...] "pick the dumbest creatures on the planet, <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> ability to conjure fire". Notable goblins include General Scalene who was killed along with Julius Root in book 4, also a general in the goblin revolution and public enemy No.2 [...] (after Opal Koboi). [...] Also there are Generals Sputa and Phlebum, leaders of the triad, and captain (now lieutenant after killing D'Nall and Aymon) [...] Nyle, a young, cocky goblin captain also enlisted in the goblin revolution. Another notable goblin is Lieutenant Poll. He was the leader of the goblin hit squad who nearly killed Root and Butler in book 2. After straying too close to an avalanche to inspect the [...] "bodies" [...] of Butler and Root, a one-ton pane of ice put [...] "some big hole in Lieutenant Poll. I could see right through 'im.
