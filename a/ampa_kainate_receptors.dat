50|$|Glutamate exerts {{its effects}} by binding to and {{activating}} cell surface receptors. In mammals, four families of glutamate receptors have been identified, known as <b>AMPA</b> <b>receptors,</b> <b>kainate</b> <b>receptors,</b> NMDA receptors, and metabotropic glutamate receptors. The first three families are ionotropic, meaning that when activated they open membrane channels that allow ions to pass through.

In order to address the mutual regulation of NMDA, <b>AMPA,</b> and <b>kainate</b> <b>receptor</b> expression in rat hippocampus, we conducted two experiments examining the effects of NMDA and non-NMDA glutamate receptor modulators on NMDA, <b>AMPA,</b> and <b>kainate</b> <b>receptor</b> expression using in situ hybridization and receptor autoradiography. NMDA receptor expression was preferentially affected by systemic treatments, as all drugs significantly altered [3 H]MK- 801 binding, and several drugs increased [3 H]ifenprodil binding. GYKI 52466 and aniracetam treatments resulted in changes in both [3 H]ifenprodil binding and NR 2 B mRNA levels, consistent with the association of this subunit and binding site in vitro. There were more modest effects on <b>AMPA</b> and <b>kainate</b> <b>receptor</b> expression, even by direct antagonists.

In addition, <b>AMPA</b> and <b>kainate</b> <b>receptors</b> share similar pharmacological and biophysical properties in that they are activated by common agonists and display rapid activation and desensitization characteristics. However, we show here that in contrast to AMPA receptor-mediated responses (native or recombinant GluR 3 receptor), the response of native and recombinant (GluR 6) <b>kainate</b> <b>receptors</b> to glutamate was drastically reduced in the absence of extracellular Na � (i. e., when replaced by Cs �). Removal of Na � increases the rate of desensitization, indicating that external Na � modulates channel gating.

These results indicate the existence of different gating mechanisms for <b>AMPA</b> and <b>kainate</b> <b>receptors.</b> By using chimeric <b>AMPA</b> – <b>kainate</b> <b>receptors</b> derived from GluR 3 and GluR 6, we have identified a key residue in the S 2 segment of GluR 6 (M 770) that is largely responsible for the sensitivity of the receptor to external Na �.

40|$|No direct {{evidence}} has been found for expression of functional AMPA receptors by dorsal root ganglion neurons despite immunocytochemical evidence suggesting they are present. Here we report evidence for expression of functional AMPA receptors by a subpopulation of dorsal root ganglion neurons.

We demonstrate that activation of presynaptic AMPA receptors by exogenous agonists causes inhibition of glutamate release from the terminals, possibly via primary afferent depolarization (PAD).

40|$|AbstractThe potent {{excitatory}} {{amino acid}} glutamate mediates its excitatory effects through {{a great variety}} of specific ionotropic receptors, including NMDA, <b>AMPA</b> and <b>kainate</b> <b>receptors.</b> Despite the identification, isolation and cloning of several subunits of the <b>kainate</b> <b>receptor,</b> this receptor has been rather elusive and its function remains enigmatic. Recent results indicate that <b>kainate</b> <b>receptors</b> can be reached by synaptically released glutamate and that their activation downregulates GABAergic inhibition by modulating the reliability of GABA synapses.

40|$|Some interneurons of the {{hippocampus}} exhibit NMDA receptor-independent long-term potentiation (LTP) that is induced by presynaptic glutamate release when the postsynaptic membrane potential is hyperpolarized. This "anti-Hebbian" form of LTP is prevented by postsynaptic depolarization or by blocking <b>AMPA</b> and <b>kainate</b> <b>receptors.</b> Although both <b>AMPA</b> and <b>kainate</b> <b>receptors</b> {{are expressed in}} hippocampal interneurons, their relative roles in anti-Hebbian LTP are not known. Because interneuron diversity potentially conceals simple rules underlying different forms of plasticity, we focus on glutamatergic synapses onto a subset of interneurons with dendrites in stratum oriens and a main ascending axon that projects to stratum lacunosum moleculare, the oriens-lacunosum moleculare (O-LM) cells. We show that anti-Hebbian LTP in O-LM interneurons has consistent induction and expression properties, and is prevented by selective inhibition of AMPA receptors. The majority of the ionotropic glutamatergic synaptic current in these cells is mediated by inwardly rectifying Ca(2 +) -permeable AMPA receptors. Although GluR 5 -containing <b>kainate</b> <b>receptors</b> contribute to synaptic currents at high stimulus frequency, they are not required for LTP induction.

40|$|Sustained {{activation}} of <b>AMPA</b> and <b>kainate</b> <b>receptors</b> in rat oligodendrocytes induces cytosolic calcium overload, mitochondrial depolarization, {{and an increase}} of reactive oxygen species, resulting in cell death. Here, we provide evidence that Bax, a proapoptotic member of the Bcl- 2 protein family, is involved in excitotoxic apoptotic death of oligodendrocytes and that calpain mediates Bax activation. Cultured Bax �/ � oligodendrocytes, obtained from the optic nerve of Bax knock-out mice, were resistant to <b>AMPA</b> and <b>kainate</b> receptor-mediated insults. In turn, both mitochondrial calcium uptake and mitochondrial alterations after excitotoxic insults were diminished in Bax-null oligodendrocytes. Moreover, pretreatment with furosemide, a blocker of Bax translocation to mitochondria, significantly protected rat and mouse oligodendrocytes from AMPA- and kainate-induced damage; in contrast, bongkrekic acid, a blocker of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, had no effect. Finally, we analyzed the participation of calpain, which cleaves Bax and is activated by <b>AMPA</b> and <b>kainate,</b> in oligodendrocyte death. Pretreatment with 3 -(4 -iodophenyl) - 2 -mercapto-(Z) - 2 -propenoic acid (PD 150606), a broad cellpermeable calpain inhibitor, and two additional calpain inhibitors diminished Bax activation, inhibited its translocation to mitochondria, and attenuated all apoptotic events resulting from excitotoxic insults to rat oligodendrocytes.

Blocking ionisation of the uracil ring by adding a methyl group to the N 3 position was not sufficient to convert willardiine into an antagonist. However, willardiine derivatives with a side-chain bearing a carboxylic acid group at the N 3 -position of the uracil ring could antagonise <b>AMPA</b> and <b>kainate</b> <b>receptors.</b> S stereochemistry was optimal for antagonism. When compounds with differing interacidic group chain lengths were compared, a group chain length of two methylene groups was preferable for AMPA receptor antagonism in the series of compounds bearing a carboxyalkyl side chain (UBP 275, UBP 277 and UBP 279 reduced the fDR-VRP with IC 50 values of 287 ± 41, 23. 8 ± 3. 9 and 136 ± 17 μM, respectively).

40|$|International audienceL-Glutamate, the {{principal}} excitatory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate central nervous system, acts on three classes of ionotropic glutamate receptors, {{named after the}} agonists <b>AMPA,</b> NMDA and <b>kainate.</b> <b>AMPA</b> <b>receptors</b> are known to mediate fast synaptic responses and NMDA receptors to mediate slow synaptic responses at most excitatory synapses in the brain. <b>Kainate</b> <b>receptors</b> are formed from a separate set of genes (GluR 5 - 7, KA- 1 and KA- 2) and are widely distributed throughout the brain. They are implicated in epileptogenesis and cell death. However, the physiological functions of <b>kainate</b> <b>receptors</b> are not known. The development of 2, 3 -benzodiazepine antagonists that are selective for <b>AMPA</b> <b>receptors</b> enables <b>kainate</b> <b>receptors</b> to be specifically activated by exogenous ligands, such as kainate. Here we demonstrate that high-frequency stimulation of mossy fibres in rat hippocampal slices, {{in the presence of}} the highly selective AMPA receptor antagonist GYKI 53655 plus NMDA- and GABA-receptor antagonists, activates an inward current in CA 3 neurons that has a pharmacology typical of <b>kainate</b> <b>receptors.</b> The finding that <b>kainate</b> <b>receptors</b> can be activated synaptically adds to the diversity of information transfer at glutamatergic synapses...|$|R

The binding affinities reveal that CBG-IV has high affinity at the <b>AMPA</b> and <b>kainate</b> <b>receptor</b> subtypes. Appreciable binding affinity of CBG-IV was not observed at NMDA receptors, where the introduction of the carbocyclic ring is expected to lead to a steric clash with binding site residues.

CBG-IV showed high affinity binding to GluK 1 compared to GluA 2, GluK 2 and GluK 3, which exhibited lower affinity for CBG-IV. The structure of GluA 2 LBD and GluK 3 LBD in complex with CBG-IV revealed similar binding site interactions to those of (S) -glutamate. No major conformational rearrangements compared to the (S) -glutamate bound conformation were found in GluK 3 in order to accommodate CBG-IV, in contrast with GluA 2 where a shift in lobe D 2 binding site residues occurs, leading to an increased binding cavity volume compared to the (S) -glutamate bound structure...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{relative}} {{contribution of}} <b>kainate</b> <b>receptors</b> to ongoing glutamatergic activity is at present unknown.

The densities of most binding sites differed significantly between the strains in the subfields of Ammon's horn (CA 1 and CA 3) and the dentate gyrus, except for serotonin binding sites in CA 1. By comparing the different strains, significant receptor-behavioral correlations between the densities of the GABA(A) receptors and the activity-dependent behavior in the water maze as well as the spatial learning in the radial maze were found. The densities of D,L-alpha-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxalone propionate (<b>AMPA)</b> and <b>kainate</b> <b>receptors</b> correlated positively with learning capacity in the spatial eight-arm radial maze.

40|$|SummaryA {{prominent}} {{feature of}} ionotropic glutamate receptors from the <b>AMPA</b> and <b>kainate</b> subtypes is their profound desensitization {{in response to}} glutamate—a process thought to protect the neuron from overexcitation. In AMPA receptors, it is well established that desensitization results from rearrangements of the interface formed between agonist-binding domains of adjacent subunits; however, {{it is unclear how}} this mechanism applies to <b>kainate</b> <b>receptors.</b> Here we show that stabilization of the binding domain dimer by the generation of intermolecular disulfide bonds apparently blocked desensitization of the <b>kainate</b> <b>receptor</b> GluR 6. This result establishes a common desensitization mechanism in both <b>AMPA</b> and <b>kainate</b> <b>receptors.</b> Surprisingly, however, surface expression of these nondesensitizing mutants was drastically reduced and did not depend on channel activity. Therefore, in addition to its role at the synapse, we now propose an intracellular role for desensitization in controlling maturation and trafficking of glutamate receptors...|$|R

Understanding the molecular mechanism of synaptic plasticity has been one of center pieces of neuroscience research for more than three decades.
