The samples from the Sargelu and Upper Neyriz zones contain similar amounts of fractions.

However due to measurement uncertainties, the magnitude and distribution of BC is hardly known. In this study, a rapid and inexpensive spectroscopic technique, as it is mid-infrared spectroscopy in combination with oxidation procedures is proposed to quantify the recalcitrant <b>aromatic</b> <b>fraction</b> resistant, which can effectively determine the proportion of BC in soils. This method was tested by using a wide variety soil samples of various origin, composition and properties. Results were contrasted by those obtained by applying solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Mid-infrared spectroscopy showed a very high predicting potential in the case of samples with large concentrations of BC by taking advantage of the relative optical density of the 2920 cm- 1 C–H stretching band. In the case of soils with low BC contents, the application of Partial Least Square Regression to baseline-subtracted, second-derivative Fourier-Transformed Infra-red (FT-IR) spectra lead to significant (P< 0. 05) cross-validation models.

The polar fractions were also desulfurized with Raney Ni and the hydrocarbons formed were analyzed by GC-MS. Major sulfur compounds in the <b>aromatic</b> <b>fractions</b> were identified as alkylbenzo- and alkyldiben-zothiophenes. The flash pyrolyzates of the asphaltene contained alkylthiophenes and alkylbenzothiophenes as major compounds, depending on the thermal maturity of the oil. Generally, the sulfur-rich crude oils contained relatively more sulfur compounds. The flash pyrolyzates of polar fractions contained a variety of sulfur compounds (alkylthiolanes, alkylthianes, terpenoid sulfides, alkylbenzothiophenes) with substantial differences between different crude oils. Raney Ni desulfurization of the polar fraction yielded hydrocarbons dominated by n-alkanes, but isoprenoid alkanes, n-alkylcyclohexanes, mid-chain methylalkanes, tricyclic terpanes, hopanes and steranes were also present. These hydrocarbons show a potential to fingerprint crude oils since their distribution patterns are more characteristic {{than those of the}} hydrocarbons present in the saturated hydrocarbon fraction...|$|R

It is found that review of TPH-fractions is significant with respect to both human and ecological risks, since risks by exposure to TPH-fractions could be more pronounced. It is concluded that the present method could underestimate the (non-carcinogenic) human-toxicological risk of TPH in light fuels (=C 12) like petrol.

Calculation of molecular maturity parameters based on hopanes and PAHs gives values typical of high thermal stress such as exhibited by high rank coals and petroleums with equivalent vitrinite reflectances of ~ 0. 6 - 1. 5 %. The interpretations based on molecular compositions are corroborated by isotopic data.

Data modeling was carried out using the Peng-Robinson equation of state with the classical mixing rule proposed by van der Waals (PR) and the empirical composition mixing rule of Stryjek-Vera (PR-SV) to describe the behaviour of the supercritical fluid phase. These models were used to determine the binary interaction parameters for 2 -methylpyrazine(2) -SC-CO 2 (1), 2 -furfurylalcohol(3) -SC-CO 2 (1), 2, 5 -dimethylpyrazine(4) -SC-CO 2 (1), γ-butyrolactone(5) -SC-CO 2 (1) and 2 -furfurylacetate(6) -SC-CO 2 (1).

A key question is whether these effects are mediated by the particles or their chemical compounds. In this article we show that aliphatic, aromatic, and polar organic compounds, fractionated from diesel exhaust particles (DEPs), exert differential toxic effects in RAW 264. 7 cells. Cellular analyses showed that the quinone-enriched polar fraction was more potent than the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) -enriched <b>aromatic</b> <b>fraction</b> in O 2 •- generation, decrease of membrane potential (ΔΨm), loss of mitochondrial membrane mass, and induction of apoptosis. A major effect of the polar fraction was to promote cyclosporin A (CsA) -sensitive permeability transition pore (PTP) opening in isolated liver mitochondria. This opening effect is dependent on a direct effect on the PTP at low doses {{as well as on}} an effect on ΔΨm at high doses in calcium (Ca 2 +) -loaded mitochondria. The direct PTP effect was mimicked by redox-cycling DEP quinones. Although the aliphatic fraction failed to perturb mitochondrial function, the <b>aromatic</b> <b>fraction</b> increased the Ca 2 + retention capacity at low doses and induced mitochondrial swelling and a decrease in ΔΨm at high doses. This swelling effect was mostly CsA insensitive and could be reproduced by a mixture of PAHs present in DEPs. These chemical effects on isolated mitochondria could be reproduced by intact DEPs as well as ambient ultrafine particles (UFPs). In contrast, commercial polystyrene nanoparticles failed to exert mitochondrial effects. These results suggest that DEP and UFP effects on the PTP and ΔΨm are mediated by adsorbed chemicals rather than the particles themselves...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{organic matter}} (SOM) {{is one of}} the main global carbon pools. It is a measure of soil quality as its {{presence}} increases carbon sequestration and improves physical and chemical soil properties. The determination and characterisation of humic substances gives essential information of the maturity and stresses of soils as well as of their health. However, the determination of the exact nature and molecular structure of these substances has been proven difficult. Several complex techniques exist to characterise SOM and mineralisation and humification processes. One of the more widely accepted for its accuracy is nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Despite its efficacy, NMR needs significant economic resources, equipment, material and time. Proxy measures like the fluorescence index (FI), cold and hot-water extractable carbon (CWC and HWC) and SUVA- 254 have the potential to characterise SOM and, in combination, provide qualitative and quantitative data of SOM and its processes.
