5|$|Agharta {{was first}} {{released}} in Japan by CBS/Sony in August 1975 just before Davis temporarily retired due to increasingly poor health and exhaustion. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>record</b> label's suggestion, it was titled after the legendary subterranean city. Davis enlisted Japanese artist Tadanori Yokoo to design its artwork, which depicted the cityscape of an advanced civilization with elements inspired by Eastern subterranean myths and Afrofuturism. An alternate cover was produced for its 1976 release in North America by Columbia Records.|$|E

5|$|After signing to Mercury Records, the New York Dolls {{recorded}} the album <b>at</b> <b>The</b> <b>Record</b> Plant in New York with producer Todd Rundgren, {{who was known}} for his sophisticated pop tastes and held a lukewarm opinion of the band. Despite stories of conflicts during the recording sessions, lead singer David Johansen and guitarist Sylvain Sylvain later said Rundgren successfully captured how the band sounded live. Their music on the album incorporates carefree rock and roll, Brill Building pop influences, and campy sensibilities, while Johansen's colloquial and ambiguous lyrics explore themes of urban youth, teen alienation, adolescent romance, and authenticity.|$|E
5|$|In late August and September 2008, while Dewees was touring with Reggie and the Full Effect, {{he began}} making hints that The Get Up Kids would be reuniting {{to commemorate the}} tenth anniversary of the band's second album Something to Write Home About. The reunion was finally {{confirmed}} by a post on the official music blog of The Kansas City Star, confirming rumors that the band would be playing a surprise reunion show <b>at</b> <b>The</b> <b>Record</b> Bar in Kansas City on November 16, 2008. According to the article, the band had made the decision over the summer and had Dewees intentionally leak the information to gauge fan interest.|$|E
5|$|Rundgren {{contemplated}} recording more {{tracks to}} make up a double album in a similar manner, but following an earthquake, he decided to relocate to New York City and hold a live recording session <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Record</b> Plant with session players. The basic idea was to create songs with sing-along choruses. Rundgren did not pre-plan who would play on the sessions, but simply wanted anyone who happened to be in or near the studio to turn up and learn the material.|$|E

5|$|The Ecstatic is the 2009 fourth studio album by American rapper Mos Def. After venturing {{further away}} from hip hop with an acting career and two poorly {{received}} albums, Mos Def signed with Downtown Records and recorded The Ecstatic primarily <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Record</b> Plant in Los Angeles. He worked with producers such as Preservation, Mr. Flash, Oh No, and Madlib, the latter two of whom reused instrumentals they had produced on Stones Throw Records. Singer Georgia Anne Muldrow, formerly of the record label, {{was one of the}} album's few guest vocalists, along with rappers Slick Rick and Talib Kweli. For its front cover, a still from Charles Burnett's 1978 film Killer of Sheep was reproduced in red tint.|$|E
5|$|The reunion {{show was}} officially {{announced}} on Friday, November 14, {{along with the}} official confirmation of the album re-release and a 2009 national tour.

The show took place Sunday, November 16, 2008 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>record</b> bar in Kansas City. The band played their album Something To Write Home About from beginning to end, {{as well as a}} six song encore.|$|E
5|$|West {{took over}} a year and {{invested}} two million dollars towards the construction of Late Registration. The majority of the recording sessions for the album took place at Sony Music Studios in New York City and <b>at</b> <b>The</b> <b>Record</b> Plant in Hollywood, California; other sessions took place at Chalice Recording Studios and Grandmaster Recording Studios in Hollywood. He began working in the studio after he finished touring with Usher on the R singer's The Truth Tour. By November 2004, West had completed nearly seventy-five percent of the album. However he felt unsatisfied with its outcome and in March of the following year, he brought in Jon Brion, which drastically altered the project's direction.|$|E
