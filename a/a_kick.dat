5|$|A soccer kick, {{also known}} as a soccer ball kick in puroresu and shoot fighting, is a {{reference}} to <b>a</b> <b>kick</b> that is similar to kicks used in association football. It is the colloquial term for <b>a</b> <b>kick</b> performed against a prone, kneeling, rising or supine opponent by a fighter who is in a standing or semi-standing position, to any part of a downed opponent. The soccer kick was used in the first match of the Ultimate Fighting Championship at UFC 1 in 1993. Gerard Gordeau defeated Teila Tuli with a soccer kick, which also knocked out one of Tuli's teeth. The technique is banned under the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts however other rulesets, including the ones used by Pride Fighting Championships do permit them. Soccer kicks have been regularly discussed as to potential damage. There has been a regular debate on the usage of them within MMA. Some MMA fans and fighters support them while a fight doctor and politicians have opposed them.|$|E
5|$|After the season, the Atlantic Coast Sports Media Association named Smith to the All-ACC {{second team}} {{as both a}} wide {{receiver}} and return specialist. Phil Steele's and The Sporting News named him to their All-ACC first teams as a wide receiver. Phil Steele's and Rivals.com named him to their All-ACC second teams as <b>a</b> <b>kick</b> returner. Smith submitted his name to a panel of NFL scouts after the season, which evaluated him as a third- or fourth-round selection in the 2010 NFL Draft.|$|E
50|$|Unlike <b>a</b> direct free <b>kick,</b> <b>an</b> offence {{punishable}} by <b>an</b> indirect free <b>kick</b> does {{not result in}} <b>a</b> penalty <b>kick</b> when it occurs in the penalty area; rather, {{it continues to be}} taken as <b>an</b> indirect free <b>kick.</b>|$|R
50|$|Regardless of position, {{there is}} no offside offence if a player {{receives}} the ball directly from <b>a</b> goal <b>kick,</b> <b>a</b> corner <b>kick,</b> or <b>a</b> throw-in. However, an offside offence may occur if a player receives the ball directly from either <b>a</b> direct free <b>kick</b> or <b>an</b> indirect free <b>kick.</b>|$|R
50|$|A goal {{may not be}} scored {{directly}} from <b>an</b> indirect free <b>kick,</b> rather it must be touched by a second player before a goal can be scored. If the ball goes in goal {{directly from}} <b>an</b> indirect free <b>kick,</b> <b>a</b> goal <b>kick</b> is awarded to the defending team. As with all restarts of play, if the ball goes directly into the kicker's own goal from <b>an</b> indirect free <b>kick</b> <b>a</b> corner <b>kick</b> is awarded to the opposing team.|$|R
5|$|Alston played college {{football}} for the East Carolina Pirates as a quarterback, running back, and wide receiver. While at East Carolina University, Alston studied economics. After failing {{to make the}} Browns' regular season roster in 2003, he was allocated to the Berlin Thunder of NFL Europe, where he became a World Bowl champion. Alston played as <b>a</b> <b>kick</b> returner for the Browns in 2004 before playing in the CFL from 2006 to 2007.|$|E
5|$|Each {{team found}} success {{on special teams}} as well. Cincinnati punter Kevin Huber, a first-team All-American, kicked the ball four times, {{averaging}} 45.8 yards per punt. A 56-yard punt {{in the first quarter}} marked the ninth consecutive game he had <b>a</b> <b>kick</b> of at least 50 yards. Virginia Tech placekicker Dustin Keys missed his first field goal attempt of the game but successfully converted his next two kicks, giving him 23 field goals and the Tech single-season record in that category.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Alston {{returned}} to the Browns. While he was not valuable to the Browns at wide receiver, the team used him as a return specialist. In a November game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Alston scored his first NFL touchdown after returning the opening kickoff 93 yards. He played in nine regular season games in 2004 returning kickoffs. Alston {{returned to}} the Browns' training camp in 2005, where he competed with André Davis and Josh Cribbs to remain <b>a</b> <b>kick</b> returner. The Browns released Alston in their final round of cuts.|$|E

5|$|Originally drafted as a cornerback, Hester quickly made {{an impact}} as <b>a</b> <b>kick</b> returner, {{and later became}} one of the team's {{starting}} wide receivers. Hester holds the NFL record for most all-time return touchdowns (punt and kickoff combined) and most all-time punt return touchdowns. He is widely {{regarded as one of the}} best return specialists in NFL history, and was the first person ever to return the opening kick of the Super Bowl back for a touchdown.|$|E
5|$|The Toledo Maroons {{were the}} Tigers' next opponent. The Maroons were an {{independent}} team but joined the APFA in 1922. Prior to this game, the Maroons did not score a point against an APFA tem all season, and that streak continued into this game. In the first quarter, Baston blocked <b>a</b> <b>kick</b> and ran {{it for a}} touchdown. He would later score the game's final points in the fourth as he caught a receiving touchdown from Pierotti.|$|E
5|$|The fair catch kick rule states that, after {{a player}} has {{successfully}} made a fair catch or {{has been awarded}} a fair catch (as {{the result of a}} penalty such as kick catch interference), their team can attempt <b>a</b> <b>kick</b> from the spot of the catch; the NFHS also allows <b>a</b> <b>kick</b> to be made if the down following the fair catch or awarded fair catch has to be replayed. Prior to the kick, the opposing team must be lined up at least ten yards beyond the spot of the ball. The kick itself can be either a place kick or drop kick; a kicking tee cannot be used at the professional level, but use of a tee up to two inches in height is permitted at the high school level. Like other field goal attempts, the kicking team is awarded three points if the kick goes above the crossbar and between the goalposts of the opposing team's goal and did not touch a player of the offensive team after the kick. If the attempt fails, the opposing team is awarded control of the ball from the spot of the kick. The opposing team can also return the kick if it does not go out of bounds.|$|E

5|$|Cardiff won {{the coin}} toss and elected to kick first. Ben Blair and Julien Dupuy, the goal-kickers {{used during the}} match {{were the first to}} attempt kicks for their {{respective}} sides, were both successful. The teams then nominated other players on their team who had experience at goal-kicking, both teams being successful with their second and third kicks. Cardiff's fourth player Ceri Sweeney, was also an experienced goal-kicker and was successful; however, Leicester selected Johne Murphy, who was not a regular kicker, and he missed to make the score 4–3 after four of the five rounds. This meant if Cardiff were successful with their next kick, they would have an unassailable lead and would win the match. With no more experienced goal kickers to choose from, winger Tom James stepped up to take the kick, but missed, allowing Leicester the chance to draw level. Scott Hamilton scored with his kick to bring the scores to 4–4 after five kicks and take the shoot-out to sudden death. The teams were both successful with their next two kicks, including Craig Newby for Leicester who was the first forward to take <b>a</b> <b>kick</b> in the shoot-out. With all seven backs having already attempted <b>a</b> <b>kick,</b> Cardiff were required to select a forward player for their eighth kick, and chose flanker Martyn Williams. He missed, giving Leicester the chance to win the match if they were successful with their eighth kick. Number 8 Jordan Crane was selected for the attempt and was successful, resulting in Leicester winning the shoot-out 7–6 and advancing to the 2009 Heineken Cup Final.|$|E

5|$|The event {{opened with}} a tag team match between America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm; AMW) and the team of Alex Shelley and Michael Shane, who were {{accompanied}} by Traci. The duration of the bout was 11 minutes and 47 seconds. At one point, Storm lifted up Shane, so Harris could dive off the top rope and bash {{him in the chest}} with his forearm. Later, Storm was thrown out of the ring but held on to the top rope. He attempted to pull himself back in, however, Shelley dropkicked him from inside the ring, knocking him to the outside. AMW won the match after Storm pinned Shelley following <b>a</b> <b>kick</b> to the chin.|$|E
5|$|The game uses {{medals and}} rewards, which are awarded for certain tasks. As of v1.50, the game {{supports}} trophies, {{which will be}} used in the online service PlayStation Home. Players are also able to customize their characters with armor squad markings, Warhawk paint schemes, and other accessories. More customization options are unlocked as the player increases in rank. Warhawk also allows the creation of clans, which may participate in online events and competitions. The game also makes use of arbiters, paid anonymous players who are tasked to find cheaters within the game. They are able to punish offending players in several ways, such as an email warning, a forum post, <b>a</b> <b>kick,</b> or a temporary/permanent ban. Arbiters can also request that the player's stats be erased.|$|E
5|$|The goal {{shifted the}} balance of the game in Barcelona's favour, as United had been on top in terms of shots and {{possession}} up to that point. Almost immediately after the restart, Vidić gave away an unnecessary corner. In a rehearsed corner move, Xavi played the ball back {{to the edge of the}} penalty area towards Messi, but the tournament's top scorer was unable to make a proper connection. Nevertheless, Barça retained possession through some sharp inter-passing involving Xavi and Iniesta. When United did manage to regain the ball, however, it was quickly given away by a poor pass from Carrick, while Anderson mis-timed <b>a</b> <b>kick</b> and completely missed the ball. It was now Barcelona's turn to pressurise the United players, forcing them into backward passes or long, hopeful balls forward.|$|E

50|$|A field goal, {{also called}} <b>a</b> flying <b>kick</b> or speculator, {{was a way}} of scoring in the game of rugby football.

This method of scoring was abolished in rugby union in 1905 and in rugby league in 1950.|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>Kicking</b> {{specialist}} or kick {{specialist and}} {{sometimes referred to}} a [...] "kicker", especially when referring to a placekicker, is a player on American football and Canadian football special teams who performs punts, kickoffs, field goals and/or point after touchdowns.

5|$|As Manchester United and Arsenal won the Premier League and FA Cup respectively, {{both teams}} met in another heated match at the Millennium Stadium {{a month earlier}} for the 2003 Community Shield. Phil Neville was booked in the first minute for a {{challenge}} on Patrick Vieira, and a minute later Ashley Cole received a booking for fouling Ole Gunnar Solskjær. Yellow cards were also given to Quinton Fortune and Paul Scholes for United and Patrick Vieira for Arsenal, Arsenal substitute Francis Jeffers was shown a straight red for <b>a</b> <b>kick</b> on Phil Neville and, despite originally going unpunished, Sol Campbell was later given a three-match ban by the FA for kicking out at Eric Djemba-Djemba. The game finished 1–1 after 90 minutes and United eventually won the Shield 4–3 on penalties. Ruud van Nistelrooy had his spot kick saved by debutant Jens Lehmann {{but it was his}} opposite number and fellow debutant Tim Howard who was the hero, saving penalties from Giovanni van Bronckhorst and Robert Pirès.|$|E
5|$|Cardiff {{suffered}} an early setback when their captain, Paul Tito, was injured after nine minutes {{and had to}} be replaced. Ben Blair gave Cardiff the lead with a penalty kick before the 15-minute mark, but Leicester were then awarded three penalties in quick succession due to infringements by Cardiff. For each, Julien Dupuy elected to attempt <b>a</b> <b>kick</b> at goal, but was unsuccessful with all three attempts. Leicester's first score {{came in the form of}} a try from Scott Hamilton after 21 minutes, following a line break by Toby Flood, who then drew two defenders towards him before passing the ball to Hamilton. The try was converted by Dupuy, and a successful Dupuy penalty kick on 24 minutes made the score 10–3 to Leicester. Cardiff hit back with three successful penalty kicks of their own, one from Blair and two from Leigh Halfpenny, before Dupuy successfully kicked another penalty just before half-time to give Leicester a 13–12 lead at the break.|$|E
50|$|Drop kicks are {{optional}} for <b>a</b> conversion <b>kick</b> after <b>a</b> try {{has been}} scored. This is rare, as place kicks {{are almost always}} used for the conversion; <b>a</b> drop <b>kick</b> is sometimes used late in a game if the scoring team needs to score again quickly, and taking <b>a</b> place <b>kick</b> would be slower. Also, if {{a gust of wind}} blows the ball over on <b>a</b> place <b>kick</b> attempt after the kicker has begun his run-up, thus allowing the opposing team to begin a charge down, then there is no time to reset the ball, and the kicker may attempt <b>a</b> quick drop <b>kick.</b> Drop kicks are also optional for <b>a</b> penalty <b>kick</b> to score <b>a</b> penalty goal. This is rare, as place kicks are almost always used. When kicking for touch (the sideline) from a penalty, <b>a</b> drop <b>kick</b> may be used. This is rare, as the option of <b>a</b> punt <b>kick</b> is almost always taken instead.|$|R
