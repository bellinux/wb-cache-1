5|$|The <b>Arabian</b> <b>Horse</b> Association in the United States {{has created}} a {{foundation}} that supports research efforts to uncover the roots of genetic diseases. The organization F.O.A.L. (Fight Off Arabian Lethals) is a clearinghouse for information on these conditions.

5|$|In 1908, the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Horse</b> Registry of America was established, {{recording}} 71 animals, and by 1994, {{the number}} had reached half a million. Today {{there are more}} Arabians registered in North America than {{in the rest of}} the world put together.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} crossbreeding influence used {{to revitalize}} the Appaloosa was the <b>Arabian</b> <b>horse,</b> as evidenced by early registration lists that show Arabian-Appaloosa crossbreeds as ten of the first fifteen horses registered with the ApHC. For example, one of Claude Thompson's major herd sires was Ferras, an Arabian stallion bred by W.K. Kellogg from horses imported from the Crabbet Arabian Stud of England. Ferras sired Red Eagle, a prominent Appaloosa stallion added to the Appaloosa Hall of Fame in 1988. Later, Thoroughbred and Quarter Horse lines were added, as well as crosses from other breeds, including Morgans and Standardbreds. In 1983 the ApHC {{reduced the number of}} allowable outcrosses to three main breeds: the <b>Arabian</b> <b>horse,</b> the American Quarter Horse and the Thoroughbred.|$|E

5|$|<b>Arabian</b> <b>horses</b> also {{spread to}} the rest of the world via the Ottoman Empire, which rose in 1299. Though it never fully {{dominated}} the heart of the Arabian Peninsula, this Turkish empire obtained many <b>Arabian</b> <b>horses</b> through trade, diplomacy and war. The Ottomans encouraged formation of private stud farms in order to ensure a supply of cavalry horses, and Ottoman nobles, such as Muhammad Ali of Egypt also collected pure, desert-bred <b>Arabian</b> <b>horses.</b>|$|R
50|$|Among Nichols' {{personal}} pursuits was {{a lifelong}} interest in <b>Arabian</b> <b>horses.</b> From 1968 to 2004, {{he owned a}} farm in Connecticut and was a noted horse breeder. Over the years, he also imported quality <b>Arabian</b> <b>horses</b> from Poland, some of which later resold for record-setting prices.|$|R
5|$|Because of {{the genetic}} {{strength}} of the desert-bred <b>Arabian</b> <b>horse,</b> Arabian bloodlines have {{played a part in}} the development of nearly every modern light horse breed, including the Thoroughbred, Orlov Trotter, Morgan, American Saddlebred, American Quarter Horse, and Warmblood breeds such as the Trakehner. Arabian bloodlines have also influenced the development of the Welsh Pony, the Australian Stock Horse, Percheron draft horse, Appaloosa, and the Colorado Ranger Horse.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, Brown {{traveled}} to Egypt and Syria with Arabian expert Carl Raswan {{in search of}} desertbred horses. According to Brown's wife, the two apparently did not get along well, and the five horses purchased during their journey somehow {{never made it to}} America. Following that trip, Brown wrote The Horse of the Desert, still considered {{to be one of the}} best works written about the <b>Arabian</b> <b>horse.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, more Arabian horses, mostly of Crabbet bloodlines, arrived in Australia. The first Arabians of Polish {{breeding}} arrived in 1966, and Egyptian lines were first imported in 1970. Arabian horses {{from the rest}} of the world followed, and today the Australian <b>Arabian</b> <b>horse</b> registry is the second largest in the world, next to that of the United States.|$|E

5|$|Ironically, some pure-blooded desert-bred Arabians in Syria had {{enormous}} difficulties being accepted as registrable purebred Arabians {{because many of}} the Bedouin who owned them saw no need to obtain a piece of paper to verify the purity of their horses. However, eventually the Syrians developed a stud book for their animals that was accepted by the World <b>Arabian</b> <b>Horse</b> Association (WAHO) in 2007.|$|E

5|$|Crosses {{began to}} be made between the <b>Arabian</b> <b>horse</b> and the Welsh Pony in Sussex, England the early 1900s, by Lady Wentworth of the Crabbet Arabian Stud. She began {{breeding}} Arabian stallions, including Skowronek (1909–1930), a Polish Arabian stud, to Welsh mares from North Wales, especially the Coed Coch stud farm, which she imported {{beginning in the early}} 1920s. Other breeders in England and North America soon followed suit, although at this time they were not focused on creating a new breed, and the cross became known as the Welara.|$|E

5|$|Following the Hijra in AD 622 (also {{sometimes}} spelled Hegira), the <b>Arabian</b> <b>horse</b> {{spread across}} the known world of the time, and became recognized as a distinct, named breed. It {{played a significant role}} in the History of the Middle East and of Islam. By 630, Muslim influence expanded across the Middle East and North Africa, by 711 Muslim warriors had reached Spain, and they controlled most of the Iberian Peninsula by 720. Their war horses were of various oriental types, including both Arabians and the Barb horse of North Africa.|$|E
5|$|Native ponies {{existed in}} Wales before 1600 BC, and a Welsh-type cob {{was known as}} early as the Middle Ages. They were {{influenced}} by the <b>Arabian</b> <b>horse,</b> and possibly also by the Thoroughbred and the Hackney horse. In 1901, the first stud book for the Welsh breeds was established in the United Kingdom, and in 1907 another registry was established in the United States. Interest in the breed declined during the Great Depression, but revived in the 1950s. Throughout their history, the Welsh breeds have had many uses, including as a cavalry horse, a pit pony, and as a working animal on farms.|$|E
5|$|The Arabian {{developed}} in a desert climate and was prized by the nomadic Bedouin people, often being brought inside the family tent for shelter and protection from theft. Selective breeding for traits including an ability to form a cooperative relationship with humans created a horse breed that is good-natured, quick to learn, and willing to please. The Arabian also developed the high spirit and alertness needed in a horse used for raiding and war. This combination of willingness and sensitivity requires modern <b>Arabian</b> <b>horse</b> owners to handle their horses with competence and respect.|$|E

The study was carried out on information concerning 278 Polish bred (national and private) <b>Arabian</b> <b>horses</b> winning as champion or vice-champion in regional, national, international, European, All Nations Cup and World Championships between 1997 and 2010. Results of the study showed a spectacular domination of Saklawi I and Kuhailan Haifi sire lines and Milordka dam line among Polish <b>Arabian</b> <b>horses</b> winning championships all over the world. These lines were the most numerous, the highest scoring and with the highest points score for one horse. These results can help breeders to plan the breeding program for show horses based on the best sires descending from the mentioned above sire and dam lines...|$|R
5|$|The Welara is a part-Arabian pony breed {{developed}} from the <b>Arabian</b> <b>horse</b> and the Welsh pony. It was originally bred in England by Lady Wentworth at the Crabbet Arabian Stud in the early 1900s from imported Arabian stallions and Welsh pony mares. Breeding then spread throughout North America. In 1981, a breed registry was formed in the United States, and a studbook began to be published. They are used for many disciplines of English riding, and {{are known for their}} refinement, hardiness and spirit.|$|E
5|$|Today, people cross Arabians {{with other}} breeds to add refinement, endurance, agility and beauty. In the USA, Half-Arabians {{have their own}} {{registry}} within the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Horse</b> Association, which includes a special section for Anglo-Arabians (Arabian-Thoroughbred crosses). Some crosses originally registered only as Half-Arabians became popular enough {{to have their own}} breed registry, including the National Show Horse (an Arabian-Saddlebred cross), the Quarab (Arabian-Quarter Horse), the Pintabian the Welara (Arabian-Welsh Pony), and the Morab (Arabian-Morgan). In addition, some Arabians and Half Arabians have been approved for breeding by some Warmblood registries, particularly the Trakehner registry.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, {{researchers}} from Switzerland and the United States published a paper identifying the genetic cause of dominant white spotting in horses from the Franches Montagnes horse, Camarillo White Horse, <b>Arabian</b> <b>horse</b> and Thoroughbred breeds. Each of these dominant white conditions had occurred separately and spontaneously {{in the past}} 75 years, and each represents a different allele (variation or form) of the same gene. These same researchers identified a further seven unique causes of dominant white in 2009: three in distinct families of Thoroughbreds, one Icelandic horse, one Holsteiner, a large family of American Quarter Horses and a family of South German Draft horses.|$|E

5|$|In November 2015, Varian {{announced}} {{that she would be}} working with the California Rangeland Trust to place her ranch into a conservation easement to protect it from development. She had begun the project with the intent that her longtime ranch manager, Angela Alvarez, would operate the horse breeding program after Varian was no longer able to do so, and then once Alvarez was no longer able to run the ranch, the property would be gifted to the Trust to be sold, the conservation easement running with the land, and attempts made to find a buyer that would also be interested in maintaining the <b>Arabian</b> <b>horse</b> breeding program.|$|E
5|$|This period also {{marked a}} phase of {{considerable}} travel to the Middle East by European civilians and minor nobility, and in the process, some travelers noticed that the <b>Arabian</b> <b>horse</b> as a pure breed of horse was under threat due to modern forms of warfare, inbreeding and other problems that were reducing the horse population of the Bedouin tribes at a rapid rate. By the late 19th century, the most farsighted began in earnest to collect the finest Arabian horses they could find {{in order to preserve}} the blood of the pure desert horse for future generations. The most famous example was Lady Anne Blunt, the daughter of Ada Lovelace and granddaughter of Lord Byron.|$|E
5|$|While {{only a few}} Arabians were {{exported}} {{from behind}} the Iron Curtain during the Cold War, those who did come to the west {{caught the eye of}} breeders worldwide. Improved international relations between eastern Europe and the west led to major imports of Polish and Russian-bred Arabian horses to western Europe and the United States in the 1970s and 1980s. The collapse of the former Soviet Union in 1991, greater political stability in Egypt, {{and the rise of the}} European Union all increased international trade in Arabian horses. Organizations such as the World <b>Arabian</b> <b>Horse</b> Association (WAHO) created consistent standards for transferring the registration of Arabian horses between different nations.
