25|$|The taskbar {{has seen}} the biggest visual changes, where the old Quick Launch toolbar has been {{replaced}} {{with the ability to}} pin applications to taskbar. Buttons for pinned applications are integrated with the task buttons. These buttons also enable Jump Lists to allow easy access to common tasks. The revamped taskbar also allows the reordering of taskbar buttons. To the far right of the system clock is a small rectangular button that serves as the Show desktop icon. By default, hovering over this button makes all visible windows transparent for <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> desktop.

6000|$|His Eminence threw <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> young man, a look half of pity, half of contempt. For {{a moment}} {{it seemed as if}} an angry retort hovered upon his lips. But he merely shrugged his {{shoulders}} and said blandly-- ...|$|E
60|$|So quiet was the {{interior}} that for an instant, without {{glancing at the}} bed, he cast <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> window, which, till then, he had forgotten, and which he remembered gave upon the veranda roof. But it was still closed, and {{as he approached the}} bed, he saw his wife still lying there, in the attitude in which he had left her. But her eyes were ringed, and slightly filmed, as if with recent tears.|$|E
6000|$|Hilda {{glanced at}} me and smiled. I {{snatched}} <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> lady again. She was dressed with an amount of care and a smartness of detail that seemed somewhat uncalled for on the Indian Ocean. A cruise on a P. and O. steamer is not a garden party. Her chair was most luxurious, and had her name painted on it, back and front, in very large letters, with undue obtrusiveness. I read it from where I sat, [...] "Lady Meadowcroft." ...|$|E

60|$|As Francesca {{entered the}} hall she gave <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> table; several packages, evidently an early batch of Christmas presents, were there, {{and two or}} three letters. On a salver by itself was the {{cablegram}} for which she had waited. A maid, who had evidently been on the lookout for her, brought her the salver. The servants were well aware of the dreadful thing that was happening, and there was pity on the girl's face and in her voice.|$|E
6000|$|The youth drew himself rather stiffly erect. [...] "Her {{features}} are rather coarse, I think," [...] he replied. There was a peculiar {{quality to the}} tone which caused Bridge to turn <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> boy's face, just as the match flickered and went out. The darkness hid the expression upon Bridge's face, but his conviction that the girl was pretty was unaltered. The light of the match had revealed an oval face surrounded by dark, dishevelled tresses, red, full lips, and large, dark eyes.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> map {{will show}} how Fort Strong's central {{location}} {{made it so}} well suited for harbor defense. Its principal armament (the 10-inch guns) could engage any ship attempting to enter either the northern or southern approaches to the harbor, while its smaller rapid fire (3-inch) guns could fire directly over all approach channels and the mine fields that criss-crossed them.|$|E

50|$|On {{the pillar}} on the {{northern}} transition from the west transept to the central aisle of the nave is a monumental statue of St Christopher (5.). Statues of this saint have been common in entrance ways since the Middle Ages: <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> statue is meant to protect from sudden death. The sculpture dates to 1627. It was made by Johann von Bocholt.|$|E
50|$|The shuttle {{closed in}} on the space station. The crew used a 50 ft (15 m) laser-tipped boom to inspect its wings and nose {{for any sign of}} launch damage.

Section 1500 is a newly revised factory finishing section. Section 1600 addresses a generic method of specifying institutional cabinetry; and Section 1700 is about installation. The sections are accessed by black thumb tab indicators.|$|E

50|$|Scott Guy {{was shot}} dead {{at the end of}} his {{driveway}} after he stopped to open a farm gate early in the morning of 8 July 2010. He died from shotgun wounds to his neck, face and arm. His body was discovered by truck driver David Berry at about 7.00am. Mr Berry called the police at 7.08am and then called his landlord, Bruce Johnstone. When Johnstone arrived, he took <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> body and phoned Macdonald at 7.16am; two police cars soon arrived and Macdonald arrived on his quadbike shortly after that. Macdonald immediately rang Scott's father at 7.21am sounding distressed and incoherent.|$|E
5000|$|Shawn and Gus {{check out}} Orso's cabin, where they find Camden's [...] "missing" [...] dog. Shawn {{goes back to}} the cops to {{convince}} them he had a psychic vision of Orso's cabin. The police go inside the cabin and find both Camden and Orso dead in an apparent suicide murder situation. Shawn takes <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> room, and he is not convinced. Especially because Mr. McCallum had a cut on his wrist that could be a dog bite. Shawn visits his estranged father, Henry (Corbin Bernsen). Henry says Shawn's powers are getting soft and he's trusting people he shouldn't be. Shawn then suspects Camden's sister, Katarina.|$|E
5000|$|As Rick Moody writes, Daniele's {{approach}} {{seems to}} come more from the wilds of literature, and particularly from the wilds of European philosophy, than from any rigorous background in music. Both the two released records are, in fact, loaded with literature references, as <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> booklets points out. They both include [...] "theoretical line texts" [...] which look like essays or manifestos; on one hand these essays explain the foundation of Daniele's musical activity, coming mostly from contemporary philosophy, in particular from the French philosophy by Gilles Deleuze, Jacques Derrida, Roland Barthes and the theoretic-linguistic vision by Pier Paolo Pasolini; on the other hand, as Dionisio Capuano remarks, [...] "her theoretic will can hamper the total fruition".|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> score {{demonstrates}} {{that even though}} Bartók wrote the Divertimento very quickly, he still provided his customary highly detailed instructions for performance. The first 24 measures contain two highly coordinated allargandi, which serve to exaggerate the slightly off-kilter rhythm and sense of melodic propulsion. Bartók shifts timbres continually in this movement by alternating between tutti strings and soloists. The first mistake that a conductor may make is to allow his soloists {{to play with the}} typical orchestral solo attitude of “now it is my chance to be heard”. Nearly all the solo portions of the first movement are marked piano or mezzo-piano, and are often inserted between forte statements by the tutti strings. Clearly, by drastically reducing both the musical forces and the written dynamic Bartók was striving for some rather extreme shifts of aural mass. These shifts serve to heighten the lively, spontaneous character of the movement.|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, {{the monkey}} catcher {{thought he had}} plotted a great plan by tricking the group into {{entering}} an apartment by providing their favorite cookies and treats. His ultimate plan was to relocate the twins about 90 miles outside of the city, into a forest with other macaques. The monkey catcher's hope was to catch the thieving twins, but {{only one of them}} went in with several others in the group. The monkey catcher closed the door, thinking that catching one was better than none. Watching outside were Bipin and the other twin. They heard the screams and cries of the other monkeys and wanted to do something about it. So, after <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> door, the twin unlocked it and Bipin pushed it open. Soon, all the monkeys in the group were free and the monkey catcher's plans were again foiled! And after his heroics, Bipin was welcomed into the gang with open arms! ...|$|E
