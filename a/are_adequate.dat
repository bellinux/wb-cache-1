5|$|Radiotherapy is {{used when}} drug {{treatment}} is failing {{to control the}} pain of a growing tumor, such as in bone metastisis (most commonly), penetration of soft tissue, or compression of sensory nerves. Often, low doses <b>are</b> <b>adequate</b> to produce analgesia, thought {{to be due to}} reduction in pressure or, possibly, interference with the tumor's production of pain-promoting chemicals. Radiopharmaceuticals that target specific tumors have been used to treat the pain of metastatic illnesses. Relief may occur within a week of treatment and may last from two to four months.|$|E
5|$|The root {{structure}} of B.prionotes exhibits two common environmental adaptations. Firstly, this species is phreatophytic, that is, its long taproot extends {{down to the}} water table, securing it a continuous water supply through the dry summer months, when surface water is generally unavailable. This not only helps ensure survival over summer, but allows plants to grow then. Though the supply of water is the taproot's primary function, the ground water obtained typically contains ionic concentrations of chloride, sodium, magnesium, calcium and potassium that <b>are</b> <b>adequate</b> for the plant's nutritional needs.|$|E

A study showed that even when screenings services <b>are</b> <b>adequate,</b> patient follow-up and treatment after abnormal results is of poor quality. A low-cost early detection alternative to PAP smears used in Nicaragua involves visual inspection of cancerous cervical legions with acetic acid.|$|E

25|$|The {{respiratory}} {{protective devices}} (RPD) can protect workers only if their protective properties <b>are</b> <b>adequate</b> {{to the conditions}} in the workplace. Therefore, specialists have developed criteria for the selection of proper, adequate respirators, including the Assigned Protection Factors (APF) - the decrease of the concentration of harmful substances in the inhaled air, which (is expected) to be provided with timely and proper use of a certified respirator of certain types (design) by taught and trained workers (after individual selection with a tight-fitting mask and fit testing), when the employer performs an effective respiratory protective device programme.|$|E
25|$|Psychometricians {{have also}} {{developed}} methods {{for working with}} large matrices of correlations and covariances. Techniques in this general tradition include: factor analysis, a method of determining the underlying dimensions of data; multidimensional scaling, a method for finding a simple representation for data {{with a large number}} of latent dimensions; and data clustering, an approach to finding objects that are like each other. All these multivariate descriptive methods try to distill large amounts of data into simpler structures. More recently, structural equation modeling and path analysis represent more sophisticated approaches to working with large covariance matrices. These methods allow statistically sophisticated models to be fitted to data and tested to determine if they <b>are</b> <b>adequate</b> fits.|$|E
25|$|While {{the concept}} has been {{suggested}} {{in a number of}} cases, the only example in the world of a drop lock that has actually been constructed is at Dalmuir on the Forth and Clyde Canal in Scotland. This lock, of the single chamber type, was incorporated during the restoration of the canal, to allow the replacement of a swing bridge (on a busy A road) by a fixed bridge, and so answer criticisms that the restoration of the canal would cause frequent interruptions of the heavy road traffic. It can be emptied by pumping – but as this uses a lot of electricity the method used when water supplies <b>are</b> <b>adequate</b> is to drain the lock to a nearby burn. A series of pictures showing the operation of the lock can be seen here.|$|E

25|$|When {{the star}} {{exhausts}} the hydrogen fuel in its core, nuclear reactions {{can no longer}} continue and so the core begins to contract due to its own gravity. This brings additional hydrogen into a zone where the temperature and pressure <b>are</b> <b>adequate</b> to cause fusion to resume in a shell around the core. The outer layers of the star then expand greatly, thus beginning the red-giant phase of the star's life. As the star expands, the energy produced in the burning shell of the star is spread over a much larger surface area, resulting in a lower surface temperature and {{a shift in the}} star's visible light output towards the red – hence it becomes a red giant. At this time, the star is said to be ascending the red-giant branch of the Hertzsprung–Russell (H–R) diagram.|$|E
25|$|All {{four of the}} innermost, rocky planets of the Solar System {{may have}} had large {{variations}} of their obliquity in the past. Since obliquity is the angle between the axis of rotation and the direction perpendicular to the orbital plane, it changes as the orbital plane changes due {{to the influence of}} other planets. But the axis of rotation can also move (axial precession), due to torque exerted by the sun on a planet's equatorial bulge. Like Earth, all of the rocky planets show axial precession. If the precession rate were very fast the obliquity would actually remain fairly constant even as the orbital plane changes. The rate varies due to tidal dissipation and core-mantle interaction, among other things. When a planet's precession rate approaches certain values, orbital resonances may cause large changes in obliquity. The amplitude of the contribution having one of the resonant rates is divided by the difference between the resonant rate and the precession rate, so it becomes large when the two are similar. Mercury and Venus have most likely been stabilized by the tidal dissipation of the Sun. Earth was stabilized by the Moon, as mentioned above, but before its capture, Earth, too, could have passed through times of instability. Mars's obliquity is quite variable over millions of years and may be in a chaotic state; it varies as much as 0° to 60° over some millions of years, depending on perturbations of the planets. Some authors dispute that Mars's obliquity is chaotic, and show that tidal dissipation and viscous core-mantle coupling <b>are</b> <b>adequate</b> for it to have reached a fully damped state, similar to Mercury and Venus.|$|E
