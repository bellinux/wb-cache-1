The game was a commercial failure; by February 2006, it had sold only 70,000 units across all three platforms in the United States.|$|E

5|$|In April 1956, Marshall led a {{delegation}} to London to negotiate for complete self-rule in the Merdeka Talks, but the talks failed when the British {{were reluctant to}} give up control over Singapore's internal security. The British were concerned about communist influence and labour strikes which were undermining Singapore's economic stability, <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> that the local government was ineffective in handling earlier riots. Marshall resigned following {{the failure of the}} talk.|$|E
5|$|Jon Favreau, the writer, {{director}} and star of Chef, wrote the film's script {{in about two}} weeks.

5|$|Other themes include {{chance and}} coincidence. During Chasing Vermeer, Charles Fort's book, Lo!, inspires the {{children}} to list {{and pay attention to}} coincidences as they realize that they are more than what they seem and explore the concept that they make up one unexplained pattern.

5|$|The {{game was}} well {{received}} by gaming critics on all platforms.

The game was designed to be simple, as Takumi wanted it to be easy enough for even his mother to play. It was originally going to be a detective game, with Phoenix being a private investigator, but at one point Takumi realized that finding and taking apart contradictions was not related to detective work, <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> that the main setting of the game should be courtrooms.|$|E

50|$|Most fungal {{tissue is}} filamentous; {{its very nature}} predisposes it to grow into tangles that lend {{themselves}} to felting.

Practically every mass of mushroom tissue, including cords and membranes, is formed of anastomosed <b>and</b> <b>felted</b> hyphae. The picturesque spots on the caps of Amanita muscaria consist of felted patches of remnant tissue from the volva.|$|R
