25|$|In 1965, Coppola won {{the annual}} Samuel Goldwyn Award {{for the best}} {{screenplay}} (Pilma, Pilma) written by a UCLA student. This secured him {{a job as a}} scriptwriter with Seven Arts. In between, he co-wrote the scripts for This Property Is Condemned (1966) and Is Paris Burning? (1966). However, with fame still eluding him and partly out of desperation, Coppola bought the rights to the David Benedictus novel You're <b>a</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> Now and fused it with a story idea of his own, resulting in You're <b>a</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> Now (1966). This was his UCLA thesis project that also received a theatrical release via Warner Bros. This movie brought him some critical acclaim and eventually his Master of Fine Arts Degree from UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television in 1967.|$|E

500|$|On 24 August 2010, Forster joined Celtic, {{originally}} on a season-long {{loan from}} Newcastle. Celtic manager Neil Lennon described Forster by saying, [...] "He's <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>boy,</b> he's come highly recommended, his age {{is the only}} thing going against him because otherwise he's all the qualities you look for." [...] He made his Celtic debut on 29 August 2010 away at Motherwell and kept a clean sheet as Celtic won 1–0. He then went on to play in every match of Celtic's season with the exception of two cup matches.|$|E

"He {{was very}} soon frightened," [...] said the Colonel; [...] "it was only that little witch Una {{who could have}} deluded him into such a crowd, and, {{as soon as she}} saw <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>boy</b> to beguile, she {{instantly}} deserted Keith, so I relieved Rachel of him." ...|$|R

6000|$|I {{have said}} I {{was not allowed}} to shoot before the age of ten, but the desire had come long before that; I was no more than seven when I used to wish to be <b>a</b> <b>big,</b> or at all events <b>a</b> <b>bigger,</b> <b>boy,</b> so that, like my brother, I too might carry a gun and shoot big wild birds. But he said [...] "No" [...] very emphatically, and there was an end of it.|$|R
500|$|... "Big Boy" [...] (also {{known as}} [...] "I'm <b>a</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> Now") is the debut single by The Jackson 5 {{and the first}} song sung by Michael Jackson. [...] "Big Boy was {{released}} by Steeltown Records, a record company in Gary, Indiana, in January 1968. After it was released, the song played on radio stations in the Chicago-Gary area and was a local hit. Beginning in March 1968, Steeltown Records sold thousands of copies of [...] "Big Boy" [...] nationally through a distribution deal with Atlantic Records, but it was neither a critical nor commercial success. The Jackson family, however, were delighted with the outcome nonetheless. The Jackson 5 would release a second single on the [...] "Steeltown" [...] label before signing with Motown Records in Detroit, the 26th of July 1968. The group played instruments on many of their Steeltown compositions, including [...] "Big Boy". The group's recordings at Steeltown Records {{were thought to be}} lost, but they were rediscovered more than 25 years later. They were remastered and released in 1995, with [...] "Big Boy" [...] as the promotional lead single.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the success}} of You're <b>a</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> Now, Coppola was offered the reins of the movie version of the Broadway musical Finian's Rainbow, {{starring}} Petula Clark in her first American film and veteran Fred Astaire. Producer Jack L. Warner was nonplussed by Coppola's shaggy-haired, bearded, [...] "hippie" [...] appearance and generally left him to his own devices. He took his cast to the Napa Valley {{for much of the}} outdoor shooting, but these scenes were in sharp contrast to those obviously filmed on a Hollywood soundstage, resulting in a disjointed look to the film. Dealing with outdated material {{at a time when the}} popularity of film musicals was already on the downslide, Coppola's result was only semi-successful, but his work with Clark no doubt contributed to her Golden Globe Best Actress nomination. The film introduced to him George Lucas, who became his lifelong friend as well as production assistant in his next film The Rain People in 1969. It was written, directed and initially produced by Coppola himself, though as the movie advanced, he exceeded his budget and the studio had to underwrite the remainder of the movie. The film won the Golden Shell at the 1969 San Sebastian Film Festival.|$|E
