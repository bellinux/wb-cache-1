When I dropped down {{through a hole in the}} ice, I was completely surrounded by ice: a tunnel maybe twenty feet across. Everything above me on the land was roaring with wind and down there, there was absolutely no sound except for the distant trills of Weddell seals.|$|E
500|$|Hosseini {{disclosed}} {{that in some}} ways, A Thousand Splendid Suns was more difficult to write than his first novel, The Kite Runner. This is partly because when he penned The Kite Runner, [...] "no one was waiting for it." [...] He also found his second novel to be more [...] "ambitious" [...] than the first due to its larger number of characters, its dual focus on Mariam and Laila, and its covering of a multi-generational-period of nearly forty-five-years. However, he stated, [...] "As I began to write, as the story picked up pace <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> immersed {{in the world of}} Mariam and Laila, these apprehensions vanished on their own. The developing story captured me and enabled me to tune out the background noise and get on with the business of inhabiting the world I was creating." [...] The characters [...] "took on a life of their own" [...] at this point and [...] "became very real for [...] ".|$|E

It was added on the DVD Live at Roseland: Elements of 4, which was released in late November 2011. The video begins with Beyoncé onstage in a shimmery silver minidress, giving the crowd {{a bit of a}} windup about where [...] "I Was Here" [...] came from. She says: [...] "It's taken {{a lot of hard work}} to get to where I am. I searched all around the world, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself.</b> You all are my inspiration. I want to sing this last song and dedicate it to all of you guys." [...] The video then turns into a career retrospective in the form of Beyoncé's home movies and her professional highlights. It splices poignant memories throughout Beyoncé's life, from her childhood, to partying and vacations with her family, to most of the locations she visited around the world, to her rise with Destiny's Child into solo stardom and her love story with Jay-Z. Also containing footage from major performances and awards shows, the clip begins with a young Beyoncé thanking the judges in a talent show and later doing the snake in her living room, performing in her TLC-inspired neon overalls.|$|E

[...] The Washington Post commentator Jen Chaney opined that [...] "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] evoked elements of various films of George Romero, {{as well as the}} historical epic film Gone with the Wind (1939). Writing for Paste, Josh Jackson issued the episode an 8.8 out of 10 rating, signifying a [...] "commendable" [...] rating. [...] "'Beside the Dying Fire' wasted no time getting straight to the action, assuming a season’s worth of character development was more than enough." [...] The Huffington Post Maureen Ryan echoed synonymous sentiments, ultimately declaring that the telecast was the best since the series' pilot episode, [...] "Days Gone Bye." [...] Ryan summated: [...] "The first two acts of The Walking Dead Season 2 finale were full of excitement, honest to God suspense and characters who came up with pretty decent plans on the fly. When the braaaains finally hit the fan at Hershel Greene's farm, my pulse quickened <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> wondering and even caring about the survival of characters who'd done little more than irritate me for weeks." [...] Julia Rhodes from California Literary Review uttered that the show returned to form in [...] "Beside the Dying Fire," [...] while Buddy TV writer Megan Cole summed up the episode as [...] "intense." ...|$|E

2500|$|Justin Calvert of GameSpot {{gave the}} game a 6.5/10, noting the PvP {{matchmaking}} system, enemy AI, and pricing as weak points, but stated, [...] "Age of Empires Online effectively infuses its conventional real-time strategy gameplay with massively multiplayer online-style loot and leveling mechanics." [...] IGN gave the game a 7/10, with reviewer Nick Kolan {{critical of the}} game's best features being restricted to the premium content purchases. However, Kolan closed by saying, [...] "For all its flaws, I can’t help but like Age of Empires Online. Caught somewhere between massively-multiplayer online role-playing game and hardcore competitive real-time strategy, Age of Empires Online delivers {{some of the most}} addictive parts of both." [...] PC Magazine gave the game 3.5 out of 5 stars, and complimented the in-game artwork as [...] "well done" [...] and [...] "nicely scalable", but felt the free to play aspect should have offered more to the player. Reviewer Matthew Murray wrote, [...] "Age of Empires Online is highly enjoyable, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> afflicted with one-more-turn-itis when a fiendish mission objective captivated (or frustrated) me.

2500|$|We flew at 13,440 feet (4,800 meters) {{above sea}} level and our speed was 540 knots. [...] A little bit after {{completing}} a turn to the northwest, we identified a patrol of four MiG-21s in spread formation {{at a distance of}} 5 miles –about 8 km- at ‘2 o’clock’ and below us. Two more MiGs appeared 2 miles –about 3 km - behind[...] [...] [...] When the MiGs crossed in front of Stone, he started to follow, breaking left and losing height. Due to that, the flight spread wide to the right, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> higher and somewhat {{to the right of the}} others. I kept the throttle to the minimum during the first phase of the combat. So, when the MiGs broke to the left, and the engagement began. I chose one of the MiGs and followed him with my radar. I don't think that we ever exceeded 4G's during the whole engagement. I decided to follow the Navy pilots' tactics - at close range foregoing the radar tracking, but looking through the reticle instead. When I realized that I was in the right position, I pushed the fire button, released it, pushed it again, and waited. I did not even see the first Sparrow. However, I followed the entire trajectory of the second one, from launch to impact. I fired the missiles at less than 2,000 yards from the MiG’s tail, at a height of 9,800 feet (3,500 meters) while turning to the left. The second one hit the tail section of the enemy aircraft. A second later, I saw a huge, orange ball of fire.|$|E

6000|$|These words fairly {{overwhelmed}} me. I did {{not even}} make an attempt to answer them.
