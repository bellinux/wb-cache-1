5|$|Each {{character}} can summon a specific Eidolon into battle. These summoned creatures include series staples Odin, Shiva, Alexander, and Bahamut, and newcomers Hecatoncheir and Brynhildr. When summoned, the Eidolon stays in combat while the characters accompanying the summoner leave the party. While an Eidolon is summoned, the player can trigger a feature called Gestalt Mode, {{in which the}} Eidolon transforms into <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>form</b> and performs different attacks while the summoning character rides them.|$|E
5|$|First {{announced}} in February 2014, {{it was released}} the following month on iOS. The Android release followed several months later. The Vita port released the following year. By April 2015, the mobile version had over two million active players, and later the Vita version achieved 150,000 downloads by August 2015. It received generally positive opinions from critics: while many praised its graphics, story and gameplay, there were opinions {{that it was not}} a worthy part of the Mana series. The game was discontinued as a free-to-play title in March 2016, and Square Enix is seeking to release the game in <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>form.</b>|$|E

5|$|In New York, Sanders {{encountered}} <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>form</b> of racism. At Montefiore Hospital, {{where she}} performed her clinical training, black nurses were given worse assignments than white nurses. White patients sometimes were abusive toward black nurses.

5|$|Among Hindus, Shashthi {{is widely}} {{regarded}} the benefactor and protector of children and tutelary deity of every household. She is also worshipped as a bestower of children to the childless, and regarded as the foremost goddess for blessing children. One of the earliest scriptural sources to describe a ritual in her honour is the second century BCE composition Manava Grhya Sutra, appended to the Yajurveda (written between the 14th and 10th centuries BCE), which describes a ritual called Shashthi-kalpa. In the Shashthi-kalpa rite, which was described as performed on the sixth lunar day of every fortnight, Shashthi was invoked to provide sons, cattle, treasures, corn, and the fulfilment of wishes. Today, Shashthi continues to be worshipped on the sixth day {{of each of the}} twelve lunar months of the Hindu calendar, {{as well as on the}} sixth day after childbirth in the lying-in chamber where the birth has taken place. Shashthi is worshipped in <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>form</b> in each of these lunar months as the deities Chandan, Aranya, Kardama, Lunthana, Chapeti, Durga, Nadi, Mulaka, Anna, Sitala, Gorupini or Ashoka.|$|E
5|$|During the Late Period, <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>form</b> {{of worship}} {{involving}} animals developed. In this case, laymen paid the priests to kill, mummify, and bury an animal {{of a particular}} species as an offering to a god. These animals were not regarded as especially sacred, but as a species they {{were associated with the}} god because it was depicted in the form of that animal. The god Thoth, for instance, could be depicted as an ibis and as a baboon, and both ibises and baboons were given to him. Although this practice was distinct from the worship of single divine representatives, some temples kept stocks of animals that could be selected for either purpose. These practices produced large cemeteries of mummified animals, such as the catacombs around the Serapeum of Saqqara where the Apis bulls were buried along with millions of animal offerings.|$|E

5|$|The {{squadron}} {{arrived at}} Ubon Air Base in the Ubon Ratchathani Province of eastern Thailand on 1June 1962 and flew its first operational patrol four days later. Facilities at Ubon were initially spartan, and the pilots and ground crew lived in tents. Construction of permanent accommodation began {{under the supervision}} of No. 5 Airfield Construction Squadron in September 1962, however, and facilities were later further improved. Despite Malaysia's policy of neutrality in regards the conflict in Southeast Asia, No.79 Squadron operated as a detachment of the RAAF force (No.78 Wing) based at Butterworth throughout its time in Thailand. Aircraft and personnel were regularly transferred between Butterworth and Ubon, and most pilots' nominally six-month-long tours of duty in Thailand were broken into several shorter periods during which they and their aircraft were illegally rotated between the two bases. In March 1963 the Defence Committee, which was the highest decision-making body of the Department of Defence, recommended to Cabinet that No.79 Squadron be withdrawn from Thailand {{on the grounds that the}} British and New Zealand contingents had left the country. The Cabinet's Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee decided against this on 28March as it was believed that maintaining the squadron at Ubon helped maintain good relationships with Thailand and the United States. The Thai Government was discreetly asked if it would prefer <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>form</b> of assistance, however.|$|E
