25|$|Mr. Ament left us {{this morning}} after a delay here of five days. The Mark Twain article in the North American Review cut him like a knife and weighs deeply on him, but he takes it in a most {{beautiful}} spirit. The sympathy of all the Peking missionaries, and their absolute confidence in his integrity and the uprightness of his course {{has been a great}} help to him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> goes back well prepared to set things right so far as he can in person. He plans to write a series of articles telling exactly what he has done. It will be a story worth telling, even if there were no occasion for it as a vindication of his character. I have been with him all this first week since he heard about the Sun and the Review articles. The calm and sweet spirit in which he has taken it and his brave resolution to set the matter right so far as in him lies, is answer enough for those who know of it.|$|E
25|$|Jim Wyatt, of the Tennesseean, {{reports that}} Ringer is the {{favorite}} for the 3rd string job, and almost a lock to make the roster. Fullback Ahmard Hall said “He’s a character guy, and you could tell that from the start, He’s the total package. You rarely get that combination of humility and natural athletic ability <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> has that great combination. You combine those two and you get someone who could be unstoppable.’’ Of all the praise, Ringer responded, “I have to give credit to how I was brought up. I {{grew up in a}} religious family and I know without God none of this would be possible for me anyway, so that definitely keeps me humble. My personality is not to boast and brag about the accomplishments and things I am trying to do. Actions speak louder than words and that is what I try and strive for.’’ In a 17-23 loss to the Cleveland Browns, Ringer only had one run for two yards. Ringer finished off the pre-season with a 7 carry 18 yard performance, in a 27-13 win over the Green Bay Packers.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Spike Lee. Asked why he chose Lee to direct the video, Jackson responded, [...] "'They Don't Care About Us' has an edge, and Spike Lee had approached me. It's a public awareness song and that's what he is all about. It's a protest kind of song... <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> was perfect for it".|$|E

500|$|On June 7, 2008, Franken was {{endorsed}} by the DFL. In a July 2008 interview with CNN, he was {{endorsed by}} Ben Stein, a noted entertainer, speechwriter, lawyer and author known for his conservative views, who generally supported Republican candidates. Stein said of Franken, [...] "He is my pal, {{and he is a}} really, really capable smart guy. I don't agree with all of his positions, but he is a very impressive guy, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> should be in the Senate." ...|$|E
500|$|Peirsol {{qualified}} {{for his first}} Olympics {{at the age of}} seventeen after finishing second to Lenny Krayzelburg in the 200-meter backstroke at the 2000 U.S. Olympic Team Trials. Peirsol also competed in the 100-meter backstroke, but did not qualify for the event, finishing 4th. At the 2000 Summer Olympics, Peirsol finished second to Krayzelburg in the 200-meter backstroke. Afterwards Peirsol said, [...] "I think I'm getting to a point where I'm becoming more of a threat to (Lenny) <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> knows that." ...|$|E
500|$|Further {{incidents}} came {{in subsequent}} years. During the 2006 World Championship, Maguire said [...] "I don't {{want to be}} a fat world champion", a reference to Murphy. After beating Murphy in the 2007 Welsh Open, Maguire said of the chalk incident, [...] "That put the icing on the cake, but we've always had a rivalry. I dislike him <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> dislikes me. I try hard to beat everyone, but it would have hurt more if I'd lost to him." [...] Murphy currently leads the head-to-head 12–10.|$|E

5000|$|... "If we'd {{lost the}} war, we'd {{all have been}} prosecuted as war criminals." [...] <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> right. <b>He,</b> <b>and</b> I'd say <b>I,</b> were {{behaving}} as war criminals. LeMay recognized {{that what he was}} doing would be thought immoral if his side had lost. But what makes it immoral if you lose and not immoral if you win? ...|$|R
5000|$|... "He is aggressive, quick, {{is good in}} the air <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> a {{very good}} player {{for the future and}} also for the present. He is very competitive, but his mentality for me is very good". He made his league debut against Aston Villa, wearing the number 37 for Liverpool. Benítez also {{compared}} Škrtel to legendary Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher.|$|R
500|$|While announcing her {{retirement}} from rallying, Mouton stated her intention {{to start a}} family with Corsican sports journalist Claude Guarnieri. She had her daughter Jessie (Jessica) in 1987. Mouton credited her father Pierre's support as the secret for her success: [...] "He loved driving. He loved fast cars. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> would have loved to do what I did. He was a prisoner of war for five years and when he came back he never had the opportunity to compete. But he came to all the rallies I did. And my mother came, too." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{architectural}} historian Megan Aldrich writes, [...] "He founded no school... had few adherents {{outside the}} circle of his practice... and trained no further generation of designers." [...] In comparison with more prolific contemporaries, he completed relatively few works and lost many architectural competitions. Burges's collaborator, the artist Nathaniel Westlake, lamented [...] "competitions are seldom given to the best man– {{look at the number}} poor Burges won, or should have won, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> executed only one." [...] Burges occasionally acted as a judge in architectural competitions and Eastlake also commented on Burges's failure to win them; [...] "in one case only has he traversed this always arduous road to fame with anything like substantial success." ...|$|E
500|$|The North County Times {{referred}} to him observing, [...] "Page {{is one of the}} most recognizable artists in the entertainment industry for his iconic designs." [...] Director of exhibitions and collections at the Oceanside Museum of Art, Teri Sowell, reflected of the exhibition featuring Page's work to The San Diego Union-Tribune, [...] "These creatures are so embedded in our minds, we take them for granted. It's really handcrafted art." [...] Film director J. J. Abrams commented on Page's work on his film Super 8, [...] "the designer of the creature, Neville Page, did an amazing job <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> gave us something that took a ton of iterations but he really nailed it".|$|E

500|$|On 2 October 2011 Radio Netherlands Worldwide {{reported}} that a retired Dutch politician of the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) Frits Bolkestein, who is sometime called the 'mentor' of Geert Wilders, [...] "does not share his views". He reportedly said that [...] "Wilders says things that are just not right <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> totally exaggerates." [...] While giving his opinion on burqa ban Mr Bolkestein said that he [...] "disagrees with the recent introduction of a burqa ban, an idea championed by Geert Wilders." [...] The Netherlands, he said, is the third European country to introduce such a ban after France and Belgium. [...] "A ban makes martyrs of the few burqa wearers {{there are in the}} Netherlands", he said.|$|E
500|$|Renwick {{has stated}} that the {{production}} of any further Jonathan Creek specials will depend on reception to [...] "The Grinning Man", {{as well as his}} own schedule. Davies is amenable to reprising the lead role in future, stating: [...] "If David writes more, I'm happy to do them. Unless they turned up and they were awful - but it hasn't happened so far. And he wouldn't send me an awful one anyway. But I don't know if he will come up with another one. He always says that the writing is so difficult, I'm not sure it gives him any pleasure. But I think the shooting gave him a lot of pleasure this time. He was directing for the first time <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> really enjoyed it. So, we'll see." ...|$|E
500|$|HIStorys {{music videos}} {{displayed}} different themes and elements, {{while some of}} them encouraged awareness of poverty and had {{a positive effect on}} their shooting locations. The promo for [...] "They Don't Care About Us" [...] was directed by Spike Lee; Jackson said that Lee chose to direct the video because the song [...] "has an edge, and Spike Lee had approached me. It's a public awareness song and that's what he is all about. It's a protest kind of song... <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> was perfect for it". Jackson also collaborated with 200 members of the cultural group Olodum, who played music in the video. The resulting media interest exposed Olodum to 140 countries, bringing them worldwide fame and increasing their status in Brazil. Lúcia Nagib, of The New Brazilian Cinema, said of the music video: ...|$|E

500|$|The reader's {{experience}} of Lucy is {{filtered through the}} narrator's perception. Her death suggests that nature can bring pain to all, even to those who loved her. According to the British classical and literary scholar H. W. Garrod (1878–1960), [...] "The truth is, as I believe, that between Lucy's perfection in Nature and her death there is, for Wordsworth, really no tragic antithesis at all." [...] Hartman expands on this view to extend the view of death and nature to art in general: [...] "Lucy, living, is clearly a guardian spirit, not of one place but of all English places... while Lucy, dead, has all nature for her monument. The series is a deeply humanized version {{of the death of}} Pan, a lament on the decay of English natural feeling. Wordsworth fears that the very spirit presiding over his poetry is ephemeral, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> refuses to distinguish between its death in him and its historical decline." ...|$|E
500|$|Dogmeat was {{inspired}} by the unnamed dog of Max Rockatansky (Mad Max) from the 1981 post-apocalyptic film Mad Max 2. His initial name had been [...] "Dogshit" [...] and his ultimate name was derived from the opening scene of the 1975 post-apocalyptic film A Boy and His Dog, in which the main character Vic calls his dog Blood [...] "dog meat". According to Fallout producer, lead programmer and designer Tim Cain, [...] "Leonard Boyarsky, the [...] art director ... had that movie running continuously in his office, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> remarked on several occasions that having a dog in the game would be really cool. [...] why we wanted a dog in the first place." [...] Fallout programmer and designer Jesse Heinig was credited by Cain as probably [...] "one person to thank for Dogmeat." [...] Heinig himself said: [...] "My understanding is that [...] Scott Bennie settled on the name 'Dogmeat' for the character, and it's likely that he did pick that from the story in question." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} of Dunglass's {{appointment}} Chamberlain was generally seen as {{the heir to the}} premiership, and in 1937 the incumbent, Stanley Baldwin, retired, and Chamberlain succeeded him. He retained Dunglass as his PPS, a role described by the biographer D R Thorpe as [...] "the right-hand man... the eyes and ears of Neville Chamberlain", and by Dutton as [...] "liaison officer with the Parliamentary party, transmitting and receiving information and [...] his master informed of the mood on the government's back benches". This was particularly important for Chamberlain, who was often seen as distant and aloof; Douglas Hurd wrote that he [...] "lacked the personal charm which makes competent administration palatable to wayward colleagues– a gift which his parliamentary private secretary possessed in abundance". Dunglass admired Chamberlain, despite his daunting personality: [...] "I liked him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> liked me. But if one went in {{at the end of the}} day for a chat or a gossip, he would be inclined to ask 'What do you want?' He was a very difficult man to get to know." ...|$|E

500|$|After the {{departure}} of Duchovny, the show garnered much criticism by fans and critics alike, with many saying that the bond between Mulder and Scully was what actually kept the show {{together for the first}} seven seasons of the show. Realizing his importance in the series, Chris Carter and his crew opened negotiations with Duchovny in the hopes that he would reprise his character for the finale. Initially, they were unsure if he would appear, but he eventually elected to return. Spotnitz said, [...] "My impression from talking to him was that he still cares about the show. He's still invested in it and certainly cares about [...] <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> recognized that {{it was the best thing}} for the show and the audience [...] to come back and give closure to nine years of the series." [...] Not only did Duchovny return for the finale, he also returned to write and direct the episode [...] "William"; he even had a small cameo in the episode, appearing as a reflection in Scully's eye. Three episodes later, Duchovny returned as an actor for the season finale, [...] "The Truth".|$|E
500|$|Kyle Busch, who {{finished}} second, said, [...] "He {{was on a}} mission today, that's for sure. When Jeff Gordon has a good car {{and he has the}} opportunity to beat you, he's going to beat you. He's my hero. I've always watched him and what he's been able to accomplish over the years." [...] In the subsequent press conference, pole position winner, Edwards, stated his frustration at his accident, [...] "I’m not exactly sure what happened. I’ll have to talk to Kyle about it. I thought at first he was just frustrated and he turned left to get back in line and he didn’t know I was there, but I watched the tape <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> really did get loose. He hit me hard and I was left with nothing. I got rammed to the infield." [...] Rick Hendrick, the owner of Hendrick Motorsports, expressed his enjoyment of winning the race, stating, [...] "When you're a champion like Jeff Gordon, you know you can still do it, (even) when people overlook you. He's been right there but he hasn't had that edge. I think we're {{going to see a lot}} of momentum out of that team right now." ...|$|E
500|$|Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their}} book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three stars out of five. The two were {{critical}} of the storyline, noting that it [...] "doesn't really work as either a Don't Look Now ghost story or as a conspiracy piece", but praised the acting of Pileggi and the dialogue written by Gordon; the two called the former [...] "great" [...] and the latter [...] "so terse and so real". Paula Vitaris of Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. She referred to the scenes between Skinner and Sharon as [...] "contrived" [...] and derided Skinner's bedside confession as [...] "simply poor writing". Vitaris was positive of Duchovny and Hetrick's acting, and wrote that Pileggi gave [...] "his best" [...] {{despite the fact that}} there was little chemistry between the characters to make it effective. David Duchovny, on the other hand, was very pleased with the episode and Mitch Pileggi's performance; he later noted, [...] "It was nice for Mitch, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> deserved an episode after two years. He did a great job".|$|E
