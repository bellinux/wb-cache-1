25|$|Copper acetate hydrate adopts {{the paddle}} wheel {{structure}} seen also for related Rh(II) and Cr(II) tetraacetates. One oxygen atom on each acetate {{is bound to}} one copper at 1.97Å (197pm). Completing the coordination sphere are two water ligands, with Cu–O distances of 2.20Å (220pm). The two five-coordinate copper atoms are separated by only 2.62Å (262pm), which {{is close to the}} Cu–Cu separation in metallic copper. The two copper centers interact resulting in a diminishing of the magnetic moment such that near 90K, Cu2(OAc)4(H2O)2 is essentially diamagnetic due to cancellation of the two opposing spins.

Small-angle x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy experiments show that the layers are heavily intermixed although a composition gradient is maintained. When the spacer layer is an amorphous iron silicide, the magnetic properties of the multilayers {{are similar to those of}} bulk Fe. When the spacer layer is a crystalline silicide with the B 2 or DO 3 structure, the multilayers show <b>antiferromagnetic</b> interlayer <b>coupling</b> like that observed in ferromagnet/paramagnet multilayers such as Fe/Cr and Co/Cu. Depending on the substrate type and the growth temperature, the multilayers grow in either the (011) or (001) texture. The occurrence of the <b>antiferromagnetic</b> interlayer <b>coupling</b> is dependent on the crystallinity of the iron and iron silicide layers, but does not seem to be strongly affected by the perfection of the layering or the orientation of the film. Since the B 2 - and DO 3 -structure FexSi 1 −x compounds are known to be metallic, <b>antiferromagnetic</b> interlayer <b>coupling</b> in Fe/Si multilayers probably originates from the same quantum-well and Fermi surface effects as in Fe/Cr 1 and Co/Cu multilayers...|$|R

Such systems exhibit a lower saturation field and a larger δH than superlattices with <b>antiferromagnetic</b> <b>coupling.</b> A similar effect is observed in Co/Cu structures. The existence of these structures means that GMR does not require interlayer coupling, and can originate from a distribution of the magnetic moments that can be controlled by an external field.|$|E

50|$|The {{concept of}} nearly free valence {{electrons}} in metallic alloys explained the special {{stability of the}} Hume-Rothery phases if the Fermi sphere of the sp Valence electron, treated as free, would be scattered by the Brillouin zone boundaries of the atomic structure. The description of the impurities in metals by the Thomas Fermi approximation would explain why such impurities would not interact at long range. Finally the delocalisation of the valence d electrons in transitional metals and alloys would explain the possibility for the magnetic moments of atoms to be expressed as fractions of Bohr magnetons, leading to ferro or <b>antiferromagnetic</b> <b>coupling</b> at short range. This last contribution, produced at the first international conference on magnetism, held in Strasbourg in May 1939, reinforced similar points of view defended {{at the time in}} France by the future Nobel laureate Louis Néel. In 1949, Mott suggested to Jacques Friedel to use the approach developed together with Marvey for a more accurate description of the electric-field screening of the impurity in a metal, leading to the characteristic long range charge oscillations. Friedel also used the concept developed in that book of virtual bound level to describe a situation when the atomic potential considered is not quite strong enough to create a (real) bound level of symmetry e ≠ o. The consequences of these remarks on the more exact approaches of cohesion in rp as well as d metals were mostly developed by his students in Orsay.|$|E
