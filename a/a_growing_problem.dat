A law promoting tourism came into force in Turkey in 2003, further exacerbating the threats to their habitat. The law reduced bureaucracy and {{made it easier for}} developers to build tourism facilities and summer houses in the coastal zone where woodland loss is <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> <b>problem</b> for the nuthatch.|$|E
5|$|Prevention of TB {{involves}} screening {{those at}} high risk, {{early detection and}} treatment of cases, and vaccination with the bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine. Those at high risk include household, workplace, and social contacts of people with active TB. Treatment {{requires the use of}} multiple antibiotics {{over a long period of}} time. Antibiotic resistance is <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> <b>problem</b> with increasing rates of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB).|$|E

5|$|Drug {{resistance}} poses <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> <b>problem</b> in 21st-century malaria treatment. Resistance is now common {{against all}} classes of antimalarial drugs apart from artemisinins. Treatment of resistant strains became increasingly dependent on {{this class of}} drugs. The cost of artemisinins limits their use in the developing world. Malaria strains found on the Cambodia–Thailand border are resistant to combination therapies that include artemisinins, and may, therefore, be untreatable. Exposure of the parasite population to artemisinin monotherapies in subtherapeutic doses for over 30 years {{and the availability of}} substandard artemisinins likely drove the selection of the resistant phenotype. Resistance to artemisinin has been detected in Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam, and there has been emerging resistance in Laos.|$|E
5|$|The castle formed part of {{a network}} of defences around the {{entrance}} to the Solent during the First World War, and was re-armed again during the Second World War. The military decommissioned the fort in 1956 and it passed into the control of the Ministry of Works. In the 21st century, it is run jointly by English Heritage and the Friends of Hurst Castle as a tourist attraction, receiving around 40,000 visitors during 2015. Coastal erosion has become <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> <b>problem</b> despite government intervention to protecting the spit. Four lighthouses have been built at Hurst from the 18th century onwards, one of which, a high lighthouse first opened in 1867, remains in active service.|$|E
5|$|The {{largest number}} {{exist in the}} gut flora, {{and a large number}} on the skin. The vast {{majority}} of the bacteria in the body are rendered harmless by the protective effects of the immune system, though many are beneficial particularly in the gut flora. However several species of bacteria are pathogenic and cause infectious diseases, including cholera, syphilis, anthrax, leprosy, and bubonic plague. The most common fatal bacterial diseases are respiratory infections, with tuberculosis alone killing about 2 million people per year, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. In developed countries, antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections and are also used in farming, making antibiotic resistance <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> <b>problem.</b> In industry, bacteria are important in sewage treatment and the breakdown of oil spills, the production of cheese and yogurt through fermentation, and the recovery of gold, palladium, copper and other metals in the mining sector, as well as in biotechnology, and the manufacture of antibiotics and other chemicals.|$|E

5|$|While {{investments}} in consumer goods were below projections, the expansion in output increased the Soviet people's standard of living. Refrigerators, owned by only 32 {{percent of the}} population in the early 1970s, had reached 86% of households by the late 1980s, and the ownership of color televisions increased from 51% in the early 1970s to 74% in the 1980s. On the other hand, though some areas improved during the Brezhnev era, the majority of civilian services deteriorated, with the physical environment for the common Soviet citizen falling apart rapidly. Diseases were on the rise because of the decaying health care system, and living space remained rather small by First World standards, with the common Soviet person living in 13.4 square metres. At the same time thousands of Moscow inhabitants were homeless, most of them living in shacks, doorways and parked trams. Authorities often conducted sweeps of movie theaters, restaurants, and saunas to locate people slacking off from work, particularly during major events like the 1980 Summer Olympics that attracted large numbers of foreign visitors. Nutrition ceased to improve in the late 1970s, with rationing of staple food products returning to locales such as Sverdlovsk. Environmental damage and pollution became <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> <b>problem</b> due to the Soviet government's policy of development at all costs, and {{some parts of the country}} such as the Kazakh SSR suffered particularly badly due to being used as a testing ground for nuclear weapons. While Soviet citizens in 1962 had enjoyed higher average life expectancy than the United States, by 1982 it had fallen by nearly five years.|$|E
25|$|Malaria is {{widespread}} in tropical and subtropical regions, including {{parts of the}} Americas, Asia, and Africa. Each year, there are approximately 350–500 million cases of malaria.

25|$|Hypothyroidism is <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> <b>problem</b> in the Rhodesian ridgeback, {{and this}} {{condition}} causes {{a multitude of}} symptoms, including weight gain and hair loss. Treatment for hypothyroidism in dogs consists of an inexpensive once-daily oral medication. Dr. Lorna Kennedy at the University of Manchester’s Centre for Integrated Genomic Medical Research in England has found the haplotype (group of genes), which, when present, double {{the chances of a}} Ridgeback becoming hypothyroid due to lymphocytic thyroiditis. This is important to the breed because lymphocytic thyroiditis is the overwhelming cause of hypothyroidism in ridgebacks.|$|E
25|$|Expanding {{intermittent}} electrical {{sources such}} as wind power, creates <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> <b>problem</b> balancing grid fluctuations. Some of the plans include building pumped storage or continental super grids costing billions of dollars. However instead of building for more power, {{there are a variety}} of ways to affect the size and timing of electricity demand on the consumer side. Designing for reduced demands on a smaller power grid is more efficient and economic than having extra generation and transmission for intermittentcy, power failures and peak demands. Having these abilities is one of the chief aims of a smart grid.|$|E

25|$|International child {{abduction}} in Japan {{refers to the}} illegal international abduction or removal of children from their country of habitual residence by an acquaintance or family member to Japan or their retention in Japan in contravention {{to the law of}} another country. Most cases involve a Japanese mother taking her children to Japan in defiance of visitation or joint custody orders issued by Western courts. The issue is <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> <b>problem</b> as the number of international marriages increases. Barring exceptional circumstances, the effects of {{child abduction}} are generally detrimental to the welfare of children. Parental abduction often has a particularly devastating effect on parents who may never see their children again.|$|E

Although it is <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> <b>problem,</b> obesity is not as prevalent as in other developed countries. Iceland has many campaigns for health and wellbeing, including the famous television show Lazytown, starring and created by former gymnastics champion Magnus Scheving. Infant mortality {{is one of the}} lowest in the world, and the proportion of the population that smokes is lower than the OECD average. Almost all women choose to terminate pregnancies of children with Down syndrome in Iceland.

25|$|E-waste is <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> <b>problem,</b> {{accounting}} for 20–50 {{million metric tons}} of global waste per year according to the EPA. It is also the fastest growing waste stream in the EU. Many recyclers do not recycle e-waste responsibly. After the cargo barge Khian Sea dumped 14,000 metric tons of toxic ash in Haiti, the Basel Convention was formed to stem the flow of hazardous substances into poorer countries. They created the e-Stewards certification to ensure that recyclers are held to the highest standards for environmental responsibility and to help consumers identify responsible recyclers. This works alongside other prominent legislation, such as the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive of the EU the United States National Computer Recycling Act, to prevent poisonous chemicals from entering waterways and the atmosphere.|$|E

TB is <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> <b>problem</b> regionwide, especially in Brazil, Peru, Argentina, and the Dominican Republic where drug-resistant cases also are on the rise. Haiti does not provide data but probably also has a high infection rate. HIV/AIDS also is spreading rapidly, placing Latin America third behind Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia in HIV prevalence. Prevalence is high in Brazil and especially in the Caribbean countries (except Cuba), where 2 percent of the population is infected. Malaria is prevalent in the Amazon basin. Dengue reemerged in the region in 1976, presenting both as the usual form and the more lethal dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). Hepatitis B and C prevalence is greatest in the Amazon basin, Bolivia, and Central America, while DHF is particularly prevalent in Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela. Yellow fever has made a comeback over the last decade throughout the Amazon basin, and there have been several recent outbreaks of gastrointestinal disease attributed to E. coli infection in Chile, Argentina, Bolivia and Peru Hemorrhagic fevers are present in almost all South American countries, and most hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occurs in the southern cone.|$|E
