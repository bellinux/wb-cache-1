40|$|Identify costs {{associated}} with using tankers to transport and apply liquid manure to farms. Content file updated by author on 13 January 2015. The collection, storage, and <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>manure</b> are important activities taking place on farms every year. These activities require ever increasing levels of investment and management. Increasing farm size, bedding availability, environmental regulations, and nutrient management plans have led more farms to utilize liquid manure systems. The manner in which these activities are structured and managed can impact the profitability of the dairy farm through many different avenues. One {{important aspect of the}} manure management system is the cost to apply manure. The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify the {{costs associated}} with using tankers to transport and apply liquid manure, while developing a template that can be used to collect, summarize, and analyze costs for any manure application system. By knowing the {{costs associated with}} <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>manure</b> through transporting and spreading with tankers, one can better understand the impact that the total manure system has on the farm...|$|E

Haller et al. [2] quantified SMZ in the manure of treated pigs and calves of six farms mainly {{in the range of}} mg kg− 1. By <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>manure</b> to fields, the risk of contaminating other environmental compartments is thus heightened [7, 8]. Christian et al.

These non-lethal concentrations can select resistant microorganisms [10, 11] which can then potentially transfer resistance to other soil bacteria, including human pathogens, via gene transfer [12 – 16].|$|E

40|$|The major {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to address water quality problems associated with <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>manure</b> to subsurface-drained agricultural lands. There are over 600 large and medium sized confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs) in New York, most of which utilize land application to manage this waste stream. Due to the regions shallow soil and humid weather, most fields have been equipped with tile drainage. The concern is that handling the manure in a liquefied state may enhance the likelihood of contamination of the tile drainage discharge and its potential impacts on downstream water quality. Laboratory studies were used to investigate how manure liquidity (percent solids) affects the transport of manure constituents through the soil. Soil columns were constructed, subjected to simulated rainfall. Effluent samples were analyzed for soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP). As expected, results show enhanced SRP transport through macropores with decreasing percent solids (i. e., more liquidy manure) ...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} field was established during 1982 - 83 on a sandy soil at Mellby in the south-western part of Sweden. The field {{was divided into}} ten separate tile-drained plots, each with an area of 0. 16 hectare. An investigation was carried out during a five year period wight the objective to elucidate the effects of different nitrogen fertilizer regimes on leaching losses of nitrogen from the root zone. The amount of drainage water from each plot was measured and water samples collected twice monthly for analysis of pH, electrical conductivity, nitrogen, phosphorus and ptassium. The losses of nitrogen by water percolating to the groundwater were estimated with a simulation model. The fertilizer regimes were: unfertilized, commercial N-fertilizer according to general recommendations (90 - 110 N kg/ha), liquid manure in spring (110 total-N kg/ha) with and without winter rye as a catch crop sown after the main crop, liquid maure in the early autumn; (55, 110 and 220 total-N kg/ha) and lage autumn (110 total-N kg/ha). All the manure treatments recived a complementary addition of commersial N-fertilizer in the spring according to 50 % of the general recommendations. The nitrogen losses from the unfertilized treatment were slightly reduced compared with the spring fertilized treatments. The amount of mineral nitrogen in the soil {{as well as the}} leaching losses were of the same order of magnitude from the treatment with commersial fertilizer and the treatment with spring <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>manure</b> without catch crop. The catch crop reduced the amount of mineral nitrogen in the soil during the late autumn and winter and thereby reduced the leaching losses by almost half, providning the catch crop was well established in the autumn. Spreading of liquid manure in autumn resulted in high enrichment of leachable nitrate nitrogen in the soil during winter time. As a consequence, the leaching losses were always higher compared to spring application. There were only small and variable differences in leaching losses between the treatments with liquid manure application in early and late autumn. Increasing doses of liquid manure strongly increased leaching losses of nitrogen from the soil profile. The harvest from the unfertilized treatment was reduced to almost half of the spring fertilized treatments. The harvest from the treatments with commercial fertilizer and spring <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>manure,</b> with and without cath crop, were of the same order of magnitude. Harvest from treatment with autumn <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>manure</b> were reduced {{as a result of the}} nitrogen losses. Only in the treatment with the largest dose of liquid manure, was the harvest of approximatley the same order of magnitude as in spring fertilized treatments. Kväveutlakningen från åkermark är en av flera bidragande orsaker till de rapporterade algblomningarna och därav följande döda havsbottnar, som under längre eller kortare perioder förekommer längs kusterna (DSH 1989 : 2). Speciellt har situationen i Laholmsbukten blivit uppmärksammad (Rosenberg et al., 1990). Jordbruket i södra Halland kännetecknas av intensiv växtodling med stor andel vårsådda grödor. De lätta jordarna och den höga nederbörden med åtföljande hög avrinning medför att lättrörliga växtnäringsämnen löper stor risk att utlakas till yt- och grundvatten (Bring och Gustavsson, 1984; Fleischer et al., 1989). Den omfattande djurhållningen har många gånger medfört att mycket nötkreatursgödsel spridits på en förhållandevis liten area (Joelsson Pettersson, 1982). En del av gödseln har av utrymmes- och arbetstekniska skäl spridits under hösten och vintern.

40|$|Injection {{of liquid}} manure (slurry) {{into the soil}} is an {{alternative}} to the traditional surface application. By the injection method,it is possible to place nutrients closer to the crop sown, thus offering the crop a competitive advantage over weeds. This study compares the response in crop yield, weed density and weed biomass to injection vs. surface <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>manure</b> through three growing seasons in barley and oats. The manure applications were combined with treatments of weed harrowing or herbicide spraying or no treatment at all. The levels of weed control and crop yield obtained by harrowing and herbicides were larger when slurry was injected compared with surface application. Without any weed control treatments,the injection method decreased the ﬁnal weed biomass in barley. The in ﬂuence of nutrient injection on yield and weed control seemed to be modulated by the time of emergence and the early growth rate of the crop relative to weeds. Thus, because of its early root growth and development, barley responded more quickly to the injection treatment than oats. Consequently, barley became a more competitive crop...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{increase}} of livestock husbandry and {{the extension of}} biogas production in north-west Germany {{has led to a}} rising production of organic manure and an increasing acreage of maize. Although the nutrient demand of maize is more or less already covered by broadcast <b>application</b> <b>of</b> organic manure, usually a mineral nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) fertilizer (“starter fertilizer”) is side dressed to ensure proper early growth development. This fertilization practice often leads to nutrient surpluses which might be lost into non-agricultural ecosystems. Most recent techniques for slurry injection allow the banded <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>manures</b> below the maize seeds. Due to high nutrient concentrations in the fertilizer band N immobilization and nitrification is reduced and roots have a better spatial access to the applied P. This might lead to an increased nutrient use efficiency from organic manures and the substitution of starter fertilizer without impairing maize yields and quality. In 2013 3 -year field trials at eight sites (factorial block design, 4 replications) started in cooperation with the chambers of agriculture in Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia and Schleswig-Holstein to compare slurry injection (with/without addition of a nitrification inhibitor) versus broadcast application with starter fertilizer. During the vegetation period maize growth was assessed and at harvest yield, silage quality and nutrient uptake were determined. Compared to slurry broadcast application with starter fertilizer no significant differences in yield, quality or nutrient uptake were observed for slurry injection treatments. However, at least a trend to higher yield (+ 2 % on average for 8 sites) and N-uptake (+ 3 %) for slurry injection as well as a yield increase (+ 4 %) and higher N-uptake (+ 6 %) for slurry injection with nitrification inhibitor were found. Based on these preliminary results it can be concluded that slurry injection might lead to a reduced N and P input for maize growing...|$|R
50|$|Repeated <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> hog <b>manure</b> {{in excess}} to crop needs can have {{detrimental}} effects on soil phosphorus status. Also, <b>application</b> <b>of</b> biosolids may increase available phosphorus in soil. In poorly drained soils or {{in areas where}} snowmelt can cause periodic waterlogging, dereducing conditions can be attained in 7-10 days. This causes {{a sharp increase in}} phosphorus concentration in solution and phosphorus can be leached. In addition, reduction of the soil causes a shift in phosphorus from resilient to more labile forms. This could eventually increase the potential for phosphorus loss. This is of particular concern for the environmentally sound management of such areas, where disposal of agricultural wastes has already become a problem. It is suggested that the water regime of soils that are to be used for organic wastes disposal is taken into account in the preparation of waste management regulations.|$|R
30|$|Even {{though the}} slurry had much lower labile P content (50 % NH 4 Cl-extractable) than {{superphosphate}} (> 95 % water soluble), surface-applied slurry resulted in DRP concentrations that were 50 % (not significant) and other-P concentrations that were 180 % (significant) {{higher than the}} mineral P application for the clay loam. A similar finding, that higher P leached from <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>manure</b> than from mineral fertilizers, was shown in a previous column study where {{a high rate of}} P (166 kg ha- 1) was applied on a fine sandy loam (Tarkalson and Leytem 2009). One explanation could be that organic acids and other organic materials in the manure can increase the mobility of P in soil by competing with P for sorption sties and increasing solubilization of P compounds (Bolan et al. 1994; Eghball et al. 1996). However, Borggaard et al. (2005) demonstrated that sorption of P to Fe and Al oxides is much stronger than to the organic acids such as humic and fulvic acids. Therefore, the high concentrations of P, especially other-P (colloidal P, DOP and PP), observed after application of slurry were probably mainly derived from the slurry.|$|E

In these nutrient-poor mountain grasslands, a moderate management regime could enhance overall conditions for biodiversity. This study experimentally assessed, at the site scale, among low-input montane and subalpine meadows, the short-term effects (1 year) of a moderate intensification (slurry fertilization: 26. 7 – 53. 3 kg N·ha− 1 ·year− 1; irrigation with sprinklers: 20 mm·week− 1; singly or combined together) on plant species richness, vegetation structure, hay production, and arthropod abundance and biomass in the inner European Alps (Valais, SW Switzerland). Results show that (1) montane and subalpine hay meadow ecological communities respond very rapidly to an intensification of management practices; (2) on a short-term basis, a moderate intensification of very low-input hay meadows has positive effects on plant species richness, vegetation structure, hay production, and arthropod abundance and biomass; (3) vegetation structure {{is likely to be}} the key factor limiting arthropod abundance and biomass.

40|$|Introduction The bread making {{potential}} of wheat flour is largely {{related to the}} gluten protein. It has until now been stated that the genotype (cultivar) {{is the most important}} factor for the gluten properties and protein composition, whereas environmental factor like fertilisation has a great impact on the quantity of gluten proteins (Daniel and Triboi, 2000). In organic farming, {{there seems to be a}} stronger interaction between genotype and environment on the gluten properties and the baking properties, due to the restricted nutrient availability. Therefore, the influence of environmental factors, and especially the influence of fertilisation in organic farming must be investigated in order to grow organic bread wheat with good quality. The importance o the wheat gluten is due to its unique viscoelastic properties. Rheological characterisation of the gluten protein network is essential to explain differences due to genotype and/or environmental factors. The dynamic rheological parameters (G', G", and d) differ between cultivars with good and poor bread making quality. Differences in rheological parameters are mainly related to the ratio between the gliadins and glutenins (Khatkar et al., 1995, 2002). As some environmental factors influence this ratio, fundamental rheological testing may be valid for the testing of the influence of environmental factors on the gluten properties. Experiments At The Askov Long-term Experiments on Animal Manure and Mineral Fertilizer, an organic farming workshop was established in 1996 with the aim to study the influence of the nutrients. Three nutrients levels are compared with unmanured treatments. The spring wheat cultivar Vinjett was grown with application of two organic manures, slurry (GY) and liquid manure (FG), in three N-levels (0, 75, and 150 kg N/Ha). Additionally, FG was added at 225 kg N/Ha. Wheat grain was milled, and the gluten was isolated using a Glutomatic 2100 (ICC standard 137). The gluten was measured in oscillation in a frequency range of 0. 05 Hz to 20 Hz. The stress amplitude was 100 Pa. Results Frequency sweeps from two samples are shown in Figure 1. In the gluten elastic behaviour is dominating. The modulus G' and G" increased for increasing frequency. The slope (log G'/log w) was slightly different for the two samples, 0. 20 for the sample with no manure added, and 0. 22 with liquid manure (75 kg N/Ha). However, the phase angle d increased with increasing frequency up to 20 Hz. Increasing levels of N increased the gluten content of the flour (Fig. 2.). <b>Application</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>manure</b> resulted in higher gluten contents at all N-levels. The viscoelastic behaviour of gluten in relation to type of manure and level of N is shown in Figure 3. The modulus seemed to be influenced by the type of manure, and by the level of N. There was a small increase in G' and G" when N-level was increased from 0 to 75 kg N/Ha for liquid manure (FG), and similar for the slurry (GY) between 75 and 150 kg N/Ha. N-levels beyond these values decreased G' and G". At the lowest N-level (75 kg N/Ha), there was a difference in G' and G" between the two types of manure. The N-level had no effect on d for the slurry, whereas a slightly increase in d was observed for the liquid manure. These results indicate, that the type and level of manure have an impact on the amount of gluten protein and the viscoelastic properties of gluten. The variability in the moduli in relation to N-management is probably explained by differences in the protein composition, and mainly the ratio gliadins/glutenins (Khatkar et. al., 1995, 2002) Conclusions Oscillatory measurements of gluten from one wheat cultivar with different application of manures indicated that type of manure, and the level of N influenced the viscoelastic properties of gluten. Thus, measurements of G', G" and d may be valid in the studies of the influence of growth conditions on the baking quality of wheat. References Daniel, C. and Triboi, E. 2000.

Two coupled simulation models, which describe water flow and nitrogen transformations and transport in soil, were used for calculations of nitrogen mineralization and soil nitrogen balances. A more detailed study of the residual effects of ryegrass on the nitrogen supyly to the subsequent crops and nitrogen leaching was performed in lysimeters, using 'N-labelled ryegrass. Undersown catch crops efficiently reduced nitrogen losses when mineral fertilizer or manure was applied at normal rates (90 - 1 10 kg Nha). Over five years, undersown catch crops reduced nitrogen leaching by 60 %, on average, compared with soil which was conventionally tilled in August-September. Incorporation of catch crops affected nitrogen mineralization mainly during the first growing season following incorporation, when approximately 20 - 30 % of catch crop nitrogen was released. The results {{emphasize the importance of}} an early onset of nitrogen mineralization in spring after incorporation of catch crops. This is necessary in order to overcome the soil-depletion effect of nitrogen uptake induced by the catch crop. Simulations showed that incorporation of catch crop material in late autumn instead of spring can result in a time distribution of nitrogen mineralization more suitable for a subsequent cereal crop, but this was not verified by the results of the lysimeter experiment. It seems important to obtain further knowledge of how to improve the degree of synchronization between nitrogen mineralization after incorporation of catch crops and nitrogen demand of the subsequent crops. According to simulations, {{the main part of the}} catch crop nitrogen contributed to a long-term accumulation of soil organic nitrogen (+I 0 kg N per hectare and year), while it slowly declined in autumn-tilled soil given mineral fertilizer (- 30 kg N per hectare and year). However, the accumulation of soil organic nitrogen due to the catch crops was very modest compared with the total amount of organic nitrogen in the soil...|$|R

Studies have been conducted to determine the nutrient benefits <b>of</b> swine manure <b>application.</b> However, a need was also identified for information on the effects <b>of</b> manure <b>application</b> on soil physical and chemical properties. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the effect <b>of</b> repeated <b>applications</b> <b>of</b> manure on soil physical and chemical properties and to relate those effects to early plant growth and development. Four experimental sites were used, representing the Dark Brown (Plenty), Brown (Riverhurst – irrigated), Black (Dixon) and Gray (Melfort) Soil Zones <b>of</b> Saskatchewan, where <b>liquid</b> swine <b>manure</b> had been applied for four to seven years. At each site, treatments were 1) a control treatment, 2) a nitrogen based agronomic rate <b>of</b> manure <b>application,</b> 3) a high rate <b>of</b> manure <b>application</b> (2 - 4 x the agronomic rate) and 4) a urea fertilizer treatment. At the Dixon site, the same two manure treatments with cattle manure were also examined. Soil strength, as determined by penetration resistance measurements and barley (Hordeum vulgare) emergence were measured at two experimental sites (swine and cattle manure trials at Dixon, SK) in a field study. Penetration resistance was measured at 5, 10, 15 and 20 cm depths, 20, 39 and 123 days after seeding using a recording cone penetrograph. Twenty days after seeding, there were no significant differences among treatments at the 10, 15 and 20 cm depths. But, at the 5 cm depth, the control treatment had soil strength 0. 11 MPa lower than the two manure rates. The manure treatments were not significantly different from the urea treatment. Thirty-nine days after seeding, the soil strength of the low rate manure treatment was 1. 1 MPa greater than the control at the 10 cm depth, but not significantly different from the urea treatment. One hundred and twenty three days after seeding, the control treatment had greater soil strength than the high rate of manure at 5 and 10 cm depths by 0. 28 and 0. 71 MPa respectively. At the 20 cm depth, the high rate of manure had the greatest soil strength. Barley emergence on the two manured treatments did not differ significantly from the control. Aggregate size was measured in field samples collected from all sites. Aggregate size for the manured treatments did not differ from the control at any site. Soil crust strength, flax emergence, infiltration rate, salinity, sodicity, coefficient of linear extensibility (COLE) and modulus of rupture were measured under controlled conditions in intact cores of soil removed from all five experimental sites. All soils were treated with a simulated rainfall from a Guelph Rainfall Simulator II. Following the simulated rainfall, crust strength was measured with a hand-held penetrometer. Soil crust strength was measured daily for 10 days as the cores dried. Repeated <b>applications</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> swine <b>manure</b> at either low or high rates decreased soil strength in the Plenty, Riverhurst and Melfort soils, and increased soil strength in the Dixon soil. Repeated <b>applications</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> swine <b>manure</b> at low rates caused flax emergence to decrease for the Riverhurst soil compared to its control and had no significant effect at the other sites. There were no notable differences in infiltration rates among treatments. Repeated <b>applications</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> swine <b>manure</b> caused salinity (EC) to increase slightly for the Plenty and Riverhurst soils, and sodicity (ESP) to increase slightly for the Melfort and Dixon soils relative to their control. The COLE and modulus of rupture measurements indicated no significant effects and were inconclusive due to difficulties in measurement. None of the properties measured in any of the treatments exceeded threshold values for soil productivity, or where plant injury might be considered an issue. It is concluded that repeated (four to seven) annual <b>applications</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> swine or cattle manure would not cause any large alterations in soil strength, aggregation, infiltration, salinity, or sodicity that would affect early plant growth and development. This was supported by field and lab measurements of emergence that showed limited effect...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2003 The {{extent of}} {{agricultural}} drainage has created concern for its potential undesirable effects on surface water quality. Land <b>applications</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>manure</b> on tile drain fields {{have the potential}} to transport solutes and bacteria to the drains following precipitation or irrigation events and many times are directly sent to a surface water body, and have been documented as a source of contamination of surface waters. This study determined the potential for and magnitude of E. coli and solute migration to tile drains through the soil profile. Water from subsurface drains was analyzed for chemical and bacterial composition following tracer applications. Two sites were selected for the study to determine transport at large (field) and small (plot) scales. At the large-scale site, both tracers, bacteria (E. coli and Total Coliform) and Amino-G (a conservative tracer), were used to monitor the speed of transport from the surface to the tile drain following <b>liquid</b> <b>manure</b> applications, tracer applications and additionally precipitation events. The concentrations of E. coli were monitored every hour for 76 days during the spring. Both tracers, bacteria and Amino-G, were detected in the tile drainage shortly after precipitation events. The peak concentration of E. coli was observed to be 1. 2 x 10 ⁶ CFU/l 00 mL. These elevated concentrations of E. coli might be attributed to the characteristics of the soil, high organic matter and well-structured clay soils. Both the rapid breakthrough of tracer to the tile drain and the peaks of tile water temperature during precipitation events provided evidence of macropore flow. Antecedent soil moisture and warmer temperatures appeared to provide ideal conditions for bacteria growth. The small-scale study site was selected for a more focused study. The purpose of this site was to quantify more accurately the percent mass of surface applied tracer that was transported to the tile drain, allowing mass balance calculations. Experiments were conducted during the summer to control the rate and total amount of irrigation. Amino-G readings were taken every 10 seconds for 125 hours of continuous irrigation. Tracer applications were conducted at runoff and non-runoff conditions. Both types <b>of</b> tracer <b>applications</b> had Amino-G breakthrough in less than 10 minutes after initiation of irrigation. Tracer applied at runoff rates resulted in 4 to 17 times more total tracer mass migrating to the tile drain than when applied at non-runoff rates. The total mass of Amino-G migrating to the tile drain during non-runoff conditions depended on the total volume of applied tracer, regardless of the tracer concentration.

A survey <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> hog <b>manure</b> storage facilities on Prince Edward Island (P. E. I.) provided a sampling technique {{and the range of}} nutrients found on hog farms. It was concluded from the data that there were large differences between farms and on farm manure sampling was required to determine accurate nutrient applications. An infrastructure was designed, constructed and tested for storage, handling and the <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> hog <b>manure</b> at the Harrington Research Farm, Crops and Livestock Research Centre, Charlottetown, P.

Data from the first of two three year experiments determined that the placement <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> hog <b>manure</b> under the sown potato row and beside the row (0. 23 m) provided yields better than manure placed between the sown rows.

Resistance to tylosin in manure, soil and water samples was investigated at the field scale level using phenotypic based (membrane filtration) and genotypic based (qPCR) methods and compared with samples from control plots treated with urea and ammonium nitrate (UAN). Tylosin was quantified using LC-MS/MS. Plots in a corn-soybean rotation were identified for sampling from 2010 - 2012. Soil samples were collected from each manure plot, from both the direct area of injection and from the area between the manure bands and from control plots. Each one-acre plot is drained separately and tile water samples were collected directly from the discharge tile line weekly while the tiles were flowing. The results of this study suggest that tylosin usage has increased the short-term occurrence of total and tylosin-resistant enterococci, erm genes, and tylosin in soils, but has had minimal effect on tile drainage water quality under dryer than average condition...|$|R
40|$|Ammonia {{emissions}} from dairy and livestock operations are of significant environmental {{and human health}} concern in the United States. Conservation of ammonia from fall surface-applied manure could benefit farmers by retaining nitrogen for use by crops in the spring growing season. The primary goal {{of this research was}} to investigate a management strategy for mitigating ammonia volatility from cow manure at the time <b>of</b> field <b>application</b> with no incorporation in the fall before snow fall. The hypothesis is that <b>application</b> <b>of</b> manure in cooler fall temperatures will slow the rate of ammonia volatilization. The objective was achieved by measuring temperature and rates of ammonia volatility from surface-applied <b>liquid</b> dairy <b>manure</b> every month over a period of four months from September to December, 2008. Manure was surface-applied to a field cover-cropped with winter rye (Secale cerealeL.) in September. Ammonia emissions were measured using a dynamic chamber method. Colder temperatures significantly reduced rates of volatility and amounts of nitrate found in the soil. However, N-accumulation in the cover crop fluctuated and was not significantly different from month to month. The greatest spring nitrogen retention and lowest rates of ammonia volatility in the fall were from December plots. Surface <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> dairy <b>manure</b> should be conducted as late as possible in the fall before snow fall for the least amount of nitrogen loss due to ammonia volatilization. Planting a cover crop at the time of fall harvest in conjunction with a late fall (November or December) manure application is a nutrient management strategy which deserves further investigation...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{field study}} was {{conducted}} to determine impacts of corn silage production systems that included a rye cover crop and <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> dairy <b>manure</b> in the spring and fall on water quality and soil characteristics. Four management systems were each replicated four times: traditional, double-crop, roll-down, and undercut. Manure was applied below the soil surface during the undercutting process; otherwise, manure was surface applied. In the roll-down system, the rye crop was flattened with a heavy roller after manure application. Rainfall was simulated within 48 h <b>of</b> manure <b>application</b> to produce runoff events. Grab samples of runoff were collected and composited for analysis. Soil samples were collected prior to treatments in the fall and spring. The roll-down system had no significant effect on water quality (sediment, nutrients, bacteria) as compared to the traditional system. While the roll-down system may require an occasional tillage operation to prevent surface compaction, it is recommended in situations where reduction <b>of</b> residual herbicide <b>applications</b> is a primary concern. The undercut system displayed evidence of a compaction layer developing below the disturbed soil layer. The undercut system reduced loadings of all nutrients, but increased losses of total suspended solids, as compared with all other systems. Mean volume of runoff from the undercut system was less than half that from any other system. Overall, the undercut system is recommended over the other systems analyzed for preventing transport of manure constituents to surface water, but should be evaluated in a complete dairy system before it is implemented by producers...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to conduct a thorough accounting of energy used to transport <b>liquid</b> pig <b>manure</b> from farm storage to the field and to surface-apply the manure. Energy consumption was determined using both energy data from the literature plus data from field-scale research. Energy consumption was compared between two manure application systems (the drag hose and the slurry wagon systems) and two application timing treatments (single vs. twice-annual manure application). The single annual <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> pig <b>manure</b> applied at 81. 5 m 3  ha- 1 and transported 1. 8  km from storage to field consumed 2180 mJ ha- 1 with the drag hose system and 2185 mJ ha- 1 with the slurry wagon system. The twice-annual manure application regime used 2726 and 2209 mJ ha- 1 for the drag hose and slurry wagon systems, respectively. When energy use was calculated on the basis of MJ per kg <b>of</b> available N, <b>liquid</b> pig <b>manure</b> applied once annually with the slurry wagon system provided N at 17. 76 mJ kg- 1 of available N, which was 33 % of the energy cost of N from anhydrous ammonia and 23 % of the energy cost of N from urea. Manure transport distance could be increased to 8. 4  km before the energy cost per kg of available N from pig manure was equivalent to anhydrous ammonia, and up to 12. 3  km before the energy cost of manure N was equivalent to urea N. Despite the high energy cost to deliver <b>liquid</b> pig <b>manure</b> from storage to field, the much lower cost per kg of available N compared to inorganic fertilizer N highlights the opportunities that exist for improving the energy efficiency of industrial agriculture by replacing inorganic fertilizers with manure. ...|$|R
40|$|This report {{documents}} {{results from}} a six-year study (1996 - 2001) that evaluated effects <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> swine <b>manure</b> <b>application</b> management practices on soil nutrients, organic matter, pH, crop yield; and also discussed water quality implications. Swine manure management practices included single-rate (SR) and double-rate (DR) nitrogen (N) -based application rates (168 and 336 kg N ha- 1, respectively), three timings (fall injection [FI], winter broadcast [WB], and spring injection [SI]), and two methods (broadcast and injection) <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> swine <b>manure.</b> Analysis <b>of</b> these practices involved comparing levels of residual soil total phosphorus (P) as Bray- 1 available P (RSP), residual soil nitrate-N (RSN), percent organic matter (OM%), pH, carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratio, and crop yields (kg ha- 1) in a corn-soybean rotation. Results of this study indicated that long-term <b>application</b> <b>of</b> higher <b>liquid</b> swine <b>manure</b> rates during winter and spring application times resulted in significantly higher post-harvest accumulation of RSN and RSP in the soil profile, with no significant changes in soil OM%, pH, and C:N ratio. These results also showed that incorporation of swine manure during the spring application time produced significantly higher corn yields compared with fall and winter application times. Overall results suggest that while RSN and RSP content may be significantly higher from spring versus fall manure application times, N and P runoff losses and the potential threat to surface water quality may be substantially lower during spring and summer compared with fall and winter due to effects from crop nutrient uptake, microbial activity, leaching, and evapotranspiration during the growing season...|$|R
40|$|Nonpoint source {{pollution}} continuously {{draws the}} attention of both scientist and the public. Nutrient and microbial pathogens from the <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> swine <b>manure</b> (LSM) have been implicated {{as the source of}} contamination and pollution to water and soil. The overall goal of this dissertation was to investigate the effects of LSM on nutrient loss and pathogenic bacteria transport to subsurface drainage water quality under corn and soybean crop rotation. A field experiment at the plot-scale was conducted to achieve this goal. Data collected from the 6 -year experiment (2001 - 2006) at Nashua research site was used to study the effects of LSM applied to both corn and soybeans in comparison to manure applied to the corn phase only in term of NO 3 -N and PO 4 -P losses to subsurface drainage and its residual in the soil. Data used for investigation of directly connected macropores in transporting bacteria from soil surface to subsurface drainage were conducted in four different experiments in 2008 and 2009. Overall the results showed that LSM applied to soybean crop every year increased the NO 3 -N in subsurface drainage water and accumulated a high concentration of phosphorus in soil profile, especially in the top 30 cm of soil depth. So, the changes <b>of</b> this LSM <b>application</b> should be modified in terms <b>of</b> <b>application</b> rate and/or adding a land cover crop to minimize the contamination of these nutrients. Also, transport of bacteria like E. coli from LSM through macropores, especially for the ones that are directly connected from soil surface to subsurface tile drainage are clearly shown. This is specially shown in the first three hours if rainfall occurred after manure application. For these reasons, it is suggested that weather conditions should be seriously taken into consideration in the timing <b>of</b> the LSM <b>application</b> in order to minimize the transportation not only of bacteria, but also nutrients to tile drainage...|$|R
40|$|Sustainable {{grassland}} intensification aims {{to increase}} plant yields {{while maintaining the}} ability of soil {{to act as a}} sink rather than sources of atmospheric CO 2. High biomass yields from managed grasslands, however, can be only maintained through long-term nutrient fertilization, which can significantly affect soil carbon (C) storage and cycling. Key questions remain about (1)  how long-term inorganic vs. organic fertilization influences soil C stocks, and (2)  how soil C gains (or losses) contribute to the long-term C balance of managed grasslands. Using 43  years of data from a permanent grassland experiment, we show that soils not only act as significant C sinks but have not yet reached C saturation. Even unfertilized control soils showed C sequestration rates of 0. 35  Mg C ha − 1  yr − 1 (i. e. 35  g C m − 2  yr − 1; 0 – 15  cm depth) between 1970 and 2013. High <b>application</b> rates <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>manure</b> (i. e. cattle slurry) further increased soil C sequestration to 0. 86  Mg C ha − 1  yr − 1 (i. e. 86  g C m − 2  yr − 1) and a key cause of this C accrual was greater C inputs from cattle slurry. However, average coefficients of slurry-C retention in soils suggest that 85  % of C added yearly through <b>liquid</b> <b>manure</b> is lost possibly via CO 2 fluxes and organic C leaching. Inorganically fertilized soils (i. e. NPK) had the lowest C-gain efficiency (i. e. unit of C gained per unit of N added) and lowest C sequestration (similar to control soils). Soils receiving cattle slurry showed higher C-gain and N-retention efficiencies compared to soils receiving NPK or pig slurry. We estimate that net rates of CO 2 -sequestration in the top 15  cm of the soil can offset 9 – 25  % of GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions from intensive management. However, because of multiple GHG sources associated with livestock farming, the net C balance of these grasslands remains positive (9 – 12  Mg CO 2 -equivalent  ha − 1  yr − 1), thus contributing to climate change. Further C-gain efficiencies (e. g. reduced enteric fermentation and use of feed concentrates, better nutrient management) are required to make grassland intensification more sustainable...|$|R

Thus, the applied manure becomes a possible source of antimicrobials to aquatic ecosystems. Veterinary antimicrobials have been detected in surface and ground waters in Canada, the United States and Europe, however, their environmental fate is not well known. Lincomycin and spectinomycin are two antimicrobials administered as a mixture to swine in the prairie region of Canada {{for the prevention of}} post-weaning diarrhea. In order to assess the potential for contamination of prairie wetlands, concentrations of both antimicrobials were monitored in the <b>liquid</b> <b>manure</b> from the nursery area of a commercial-scale barn during a 5 -week study, and their persistence during simulated manure storage investigated. The potential for transport of lincomycin and spectinomycin to surface waters via surface runoff and to leach to groundwater was also assessed. This was achieved by monitoring manure-amended soil, simulated rainfall runoff, snow melt runoff and groundwater over a two-year period at two study sites in Saskatchewan, Canada following fall <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> swine <b>manure</b> from two commercial barns to crop and pasture land. Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry was used to quantitate these antimicrobials in all matrix extracts. In the nursery area of a commercial-scale barn, concentrations of lincomycin and spectinomycin in the cumulating <b>liquid</b> <b>manure</b> {{at the end of the}} study were equivalent to 32 and 3. 0 %, respectively, of doses administered in the feed.

Optimized manure management is essential to ensure maximum crop N utilization and to reduce the risk of N loss. A field study was conducted in central Indiana from 2011 - 2013 to assess liquid swine (Sus scrofa L.) manure N availability when applied at different times or co-applied with InstinctTM, a microencapsulated form of nitrapyrin. Soil inorganic N contents, soil N mineralization, corn yield, grain N content, whole plant N concentrations of corn at the V 6 growth stage, and ear leaf N concentrations of corn at the R 1 growth stage differed from year to year and were greatly influenced by manure application timing and climatic conditions. ^ A static cup incubation was used to assess N mineralization from soil samples collected at two depths (0 - 30 cm and 30 - 60 cm) at various times after manure application (early winter, planting and corn V 6 growth stage). The cumulative net N mineralization was fitted to a first-order exponential model to determine potentially mineralizable N (N 0) and the N mineralization rate constant (k). ^ Cumulative mineralizable N up to 16 weeks was not affected by <b>liquid</b> swine <b>manure</b> application timing or the use of InstinctTM at both soil depths. Differences in total soil inorganic N recovered after incubation were mainly due to initial inorganic N differences. Negligible amounts of NH 4 +-N were recovered from soil extracts in all treatment plots during the incubation study, indicating that nitrification occurred and that there was little efficacy from InstinctTM at controlling nitrification at the time of soil sample collection. ^ Spring <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> swine <b>manure</b> (165 kg manure total N/ha) showed greater corn grain yield and grain N content (6. 9 Mg/ha and 61. 2 kg N/ha) compared to early fall applications (138 kg manure total N/ha, 5. 1 Mg/ha and 44. 6 kg N/ha) at Location 3 in the 2013 growing season, while in the 2012 growing season corn yield was unaffected by manure application timing. Distinct climatic conditions, especially precipitation, between these two years were considered a main source of yearly inconsistence. Corn growth and yield was unaffected by the addition of InstinctTM at any location. Primary factors that could have affected the efficacy of this nitrification inhibitor include: i) InstinctTM runoff or leaching from the soil before nitrapyrin is released from the polymer microcapsules; ii) inadequate release rate and concentration of nitrapyrin from InstinctTM with time in soil; iii) sorption of released nitrapyrin by organic matter and clay minerals in soils; iv) efficacy of released nitrapyrin on nitrifiers under the varying soil moisture and temperatures encountered during this field study; and v) insufficient rainfall to cause significant N loss in the field. ...|$|R
