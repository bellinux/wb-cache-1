25|$|The {{folk music}} of Međimurje, {{a small but}} {{distinct}} region in northernmost Croatia, with its melancholic <b>and</b> <b>soothing</b> tunes became the most popular form of folk {{to be used in}} the modern ethno pop-rock songs. Beside Cimbule and Violins, there is also a tradition of Brass orchestras which used to play an important role in cultural everyday life. On one hand, they were the foundation of every regional celebration or wedding but on the other hand they were also known for playing at funerals or funeral feasts.|$|E
500|$|After World War I, Gustav Holst {{turned to}} the last section of Whitman's elegy to mourn friends {{killed in the war}} in {{composing}} his Ode to Death (1919) for chorus and orchestra. Holst saw Whitman [...] "as a New World prophet of tolerance and internationalism as well as a new breed of mystic whose transcendentalism offered an antidote to encrusted Victorianism." [...] According to Sullivan, [...] "Holst invests Whitman's vision of [...] "lovely <b>and</b> <b>soothing</b> death" [...] with luminous open chords that suggest a sense of infinite space....Holst is interested here in indeterminacy, a feeling of the infinite, not in predictability and closure." ...|$|E
500|$|Generally, Joseph's music gets airplay in {{the adult}} contemporary, smooth jazz, easy listening, and {{beautiful}} music radio formats, and while some is classified in the new age genre, he considers contemporary instrumental to fit his style of playing the best. [...] In discussing Rapture, John Blake of The Atlanta Journal notes that often new age music sounds as if it should be played in a supermarket. The songs can sound like musical cotton candy — soft, airy and ultimately uninteresting. [...] "For the most part, Bradley's music doesn't make that mistake." [...] "The music is cinematic, filled with introspective piano solos, swelling violins, and a hypnotic song pacing that allows the listener to daydream." [...] Along the same line, Michael Debbage of Mainly Piano says that Rapture almost single-handedly gave a sense of hope that {{there was much more}} that the New Age genre could offer. [...] Cicily Janus remarks that, [...] "Although Bradley has been, at times, pigeon holed into an offshoot of jazz, his message through his music is universal in its appeal <b>and</b> <b>soothing</b> qualities." ...|$|E

Writing for Playlouder, Jeremy Allen positively compared the song to {{the works of}} Theaudience, a band of which Ellis-Bextor was part of. Writing for musicOMH, Ben Hogwood observed that it was [...] "pleasant enough", despite recognising {{that it was a}} [...] "grower". He stated, [...] "Also lacking is a big chorus (...) The principal thing it does, however, is make you want to put on one of her sassier [...] ". The staff of Popjustice listed it as the eighth greatest 2007 single, and opined that the track was [...] "brilliant". This Is Fake DIY writer Stuart McCaighy characterised the song as [...] "warm, layered <b>and</b> <b>soothing</b> with a summery sheen". Emily Mackay from Yahoo! Music likened [...] "Today the Sun's on Us" [...] to [...] "The Cardigans on a bad day" [...] and to the [...] "naffer moments of Pink or Kelly Clarkson." [...] Mackay also found Ellis-Bextor's voice too light to support the track.|$|E

[...] Otis recalled that Brown used a different approach for [...] "Driftin' Blues": [...] "he poured his heart into the record—not in the Nat Cole manner—but in that deep and soulful style that soon had many young R singers trying to sound like him".

Atlus produced a CD containing five piano arrangements of tracks from the game, including a piano rendition of [...] "Historia". Titled Radiant Historia: Piano Selection, it released alongside the game for the first printing. The piano collection was suggested by Shimomura by Atlus. The core concept was for the tracks to be calm <b>and</b> <b>soothing</b> even if their original forms were more energetic. The tracks were arranged for piano by Sachiko Miyano and performed by Febian Reza Pane. The recording sessions were produced and supervised by Shimomura. Reaction to the piano album was generally negative.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the book}} has always been popular and {{considered}} a children's classic by many literary critics, a number of prominent individuals have spoken unfavorably of the novel over the years. Children's novelist and literary historian John Rowe Townsend has described the book as [...] "fantasy of an almost literally nauseating kind" [...] and accused it of [...] "astonishing insensitivity" [...] regarding the original portrayal of the Oompa-Loompas as black pygmies, although Dahl did revise this in later editions. Another novelist, Eleanor Cameron, compared the book to the sweets that form its subject matter, commenting that it is [...] "delectable <b>and</b> <b>soothing</b> while we are undergoing the brief sensory pleasure it affords but leaves us poorly nourished with our taste dulled for better fare."Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (together with Charlotte's Web [...] ) is probably the book most read aloud by those teachers who have no idea, apparently, what other books they might read to the children. Charlie, again along with Charlotte's Web, is always {{at the top of}} the best sellers among children's books, put there by fond aunts and grandmothers and parents buying it as the perfect gift, knowing no better. And I do think this a most curious coupling: on the one hand, one of the most tasteless books ever written for children; and on the other, one of the best. We are reminded of Ford Madox Ford's observation that only two classes of books are universal in their appeal: the very best and the very worst. [...] is like candy (the chief excitement and lure of Charlie) in that it is delectable <b>and</b> <b>soothing</b> while we are undergoing the brief sensory pleasure it affords but leaves us poorly nourished with our taste dulled for better fare. I think it will be admitted of the average TV show that goes on from week to week that there is no time, either from the point of view of production or the time allowed for showing, to work deeply at meaning or characterisation. All interest depends upon the constant, unremitting excitement of the turns of plot. And if character or likelihood of action – that is, inevitability – must be wrenched to fit the necessities of plot, there is no time to be concerned about this either by the director or by the audience. Nor will the tuned-in, turned-on, keyed-up television watcher give the superficial quality of the show so much as a second thought. He has been temporarily amused; what is there to complain about? And like all those nursing at the electronic bosom in McLuhan's global village (as he likes to call it), so everybody in Willy Wonka's chocolate factory is enclosed in its intoxicating confines forever: all the workers, including the little Oompa-Loompas brought over from Africa and, by the end of the book, Charlie and his entire family.}} ...|$|E
2500|$|The FBI {{captured}} a {{dispute between the}} couple {{in the middle of}} 1964, where the two both blamed each other for making the Civil Rights Movement even more difficult. Martin confessed in a 1965 sermon of his secretary having to remind him of his wife's birthday and the couple's wedding anniversary. For a time, many accompanying her husband would usually hear Coretta argue with him in telephone conversations. King resented her husband whenever he failed to call her about the children while he was away, and learned of his plans to not include her in formal visits, such as the White House. However, when King failed to meet to his own standards by missing a plane and fell into a level of despair, Coretta told her husband over the phone that [...] "I believe in you, if that means anything." [...] Author Ron Ramdin wrote [...] "King faced many new and trying moments, his refuge was home and closeness to Coretta, whose calm <b>and</b> <b>soothing</b> voice whenever she sang, gave him renewed strength. She was the rock upon which his marriage and civil rights leadership, especially at this time of crisis, was founded." [...] After she succeeded in getting Martin Luther King, Jr. Day made a federal holiday, King said her husband's dream was [...] "for people of all religions, all socio-economic levels and all cultures to create a world community free from violence, poverty, racism and war so that they could live together in what he called the beloved community or his world house concept." ...|$|E
