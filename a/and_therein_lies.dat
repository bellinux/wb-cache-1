The uniform-gravity, flat-earth parabola is clearly meant to be an approximation to a small segment of the true central-force/ellipse orbit. To look more deeply into this connection we convert earth-centered polar coordinates to ``flat-earth coordinates'' by treating radial lines as vertical, and by treating lines of constant radial distance as horizontal. With the exact trajectory and dynamics in this system, we consider such questions as whether gravity is purely vertical in this picture, and whether the central force nature of gravity is important only when the height or range of a ballistic trajectory is comparable to the earth radius. Somewhat surprisingly, the answers to both questions is ``no,'' <b>and</b> <b>therein</b> <b>lie</b> some interesting lessons. Comment: 7 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

5000|$|Calder’s wire {{sculptures of}} this period tended to be portraits, caricatures, and stylized {{representations}} of people and animals. While originally believing the medium of wire sculpture to be merely clever and amusing, as his work developed, he began to state that wire sculpture had an important place {{in the history of}} art and remarked on the great possibilities that lie within the medium.“These new studies in wire, however, did not remain the simple modest little things I had done in New York.

6000|$|In France, {{before the}} Revolution, {{property}} was divided among {{a very few}} people. A few thousand nobles and priests and merchants had all the wealth in the country; twenty-five million peasants had nothing. But in modern States, such as we see around us in the world to-day, property is very widely divided. I do not say it is evenly divided. I do not say it is fairly divided, {{but it is very}} widely divided. Especially is that true in Great Britain. Nowhere else in the world, except, perhaps, in France and the United States, are there such vast numbers of persons who are holders of interest-bearing, profit-bearing, rent-earning property, and the whole tendency of civilisation and of free institutions is to an ever-increasing volume of production and an increasingly wide diffusion of profit. <b>And</b> <b>therein</b> <b>lies</b> the essential stability of modern States. There are millions of persons who would certainly lose by anything like a general overturn, and they are everywhere the strongest and best organised millions.

He began his story quietly enough. On board that Dale Line steamer that had picked up these four floating in a boat upon the discreet sunset glow of the sea, they had been after the first day looked askance upon. The fat skipper told some story, the others had been silent, and at first it had been accepted. You don't cross-examine poor castaways you had the good luck to save, if not from cruel death, then at least from cruel suffering. Afterwards, with time to think it over, it might have struck the officers of the Avondale that there was [...] "something fishy" [...] in the affair; but of course they would keep their doubts to themselves. They had picked up the captain, the mate, and two engineers of the steamer Patna sunk at sea, and that, very properly, was enough for them. I did not ask Jim about the nature of his feelings during the ten days he spent on board. From the way he narrated that part I was at liberty to infer he was partly stunned by the discovery he had made--the discovery about himself--and no doubt was at work trying to explain it away to the only man who was capable of appreciating all its tremendous magnitude. You must understand he did not try to minimise its importance. Of that I am sure; <b>and</b> <b>therein</b> <b>lies</b> his distinction.

5000|$|Andrew Louth {{offers the}} {{following}} modern {{appraisal of the}} Areopagite; Dionysius/Denys' vision is remarkable because, on the one hand, his understanding of hierarchy makes possible a rich symbolic system in terms of which we can understand God and the cosmos and our place within it, and, on the other, he finds room within this strictly hierarchical society for an escape from it, beyond it, by transcending symbols and realizing directly one's relationship with God as his creature, the creature of his love. There is space within the Dionysian universe for a multitude of ways of responding to God's love.

60|$|The {{revolution}} in England, under Cromwell, succeeded, {{because it had}} an open Bible and liberty of conscience for its foundation, and united both the elements of faith and of reason.

Plad France, {{in the time of}} her revolution, had leaders like Admiral Coligny, her revolution might have prospered as did England's under Cromwell. But these revolutions, needlessly terrible as they have been, still have accomplished something; without them France might have died away into what Spain is. As it is, progress has been made, though at a fearful sacrifice. No country has been swept cleaner of aristocratic institutions, and the old bastiles and prisons of a past tyranny. The aspiration for democratic freedom has been so thoroughly sown in France, that it never will be rooted up again. How to get it, and how to keep it when it is got, they do not yet clearly see; but they will never rest till they learn. There is a liberty of thought and of speech in France which the tongue-tied state of the press cannot indicate. Could France receive the Bible--could it be put into the hands of all the common people--that might help her. And France is receiving the Bible.
