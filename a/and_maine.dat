5|$|At the {{national}} convention of 1856, Stone presented {{a new strategy}} suggested by Antoinette Brown Blackwell to send a memorial to the various state legislatures signed by the officers of the National Woman’s Rights Convention. Antoinette Brown had married Samuel Charles Blackwell on January 24, 1856, becoming Stone's sister-in-law in the process. Stone, Brown Blackwell and Ernestine Rose were appointed a committee {{to carry out the}} plan. Stone drafted and printed the appeal, and Brown Blackwell mailed it to twenty-five state legislatures. Indiana and Pennsylvania referred the memorial to select committees, while both Massachusetts <b>and</b> <b>Maine</b> granted hearings.

5|$|Hip {{dysplasia}} is an abnormality of the {{hip joint}} which can cause crippling lameness and arthritis. The cats most commonly affected with hip dysplasia tend to be males of the larger, big-boned breeds such as Persians <b>and</b> <b>Maine</b> Coons. The relatively smaller size and weight of cats frequently results in symptoms that are less pronounced. X-rays submitted to the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) between 1974 and 2011 indicates that 24.3% of Maine Coons in the database were dysplastic. The Maine Coon is the only cat breed listed in the database.|$|E
5|$|In 1845 and 1846, a {{line from}} Malden to Salem via Saugus and Lynnfield was {{proposed}} but did not pass the legislature due to bitter objections from the Eastern. Instead, the Saugus Branch Railroad opened from Malden to Lynn Common on February 1, 1853. Affiliated with the Eastern's primary rival, the Boston <b>and</b> <b>Maine</b> Railroad (B), it did not initially have a connection with the Eastern. In 1855, the Eastern acquired the majority stock of the Saugus Branch Railroad to keep {{it away from the}} B The connection to the B at Malden was severed, and it was connected to the Eastern at South Malden (Everett) and West Lynn. Lynn became the primary turnback point for the Saugus Branch after 1855, though a limited number of trains continued to Salem until World War I.|$|E

5|$|She {{had a short}} {{marriage}} {{characterized by}} abuse and control. A child was born to the couple, but died 11 months later. Before the child's birth, Paine had left her husband and obtained a divorce. To support herself, she taught school for a period {{and then began to}} work as a portraitist. She traveled throughout Rhode Island, Massachusetts, <b>and</b> <b>Maine</b> accepting commissions for portraits of individuals or families from 1826 through 1862. Because she lived a mobile lifestyle, she had few long-lasting relationships. The closest personal relationship of her life was with her mother. She raised a girl, however, for three years and taught her how to paint. Once she became a professional portraitist she had periods of financial security, but that and her physical health vacillated over the course of her career.|$|E

Olive Southard was descended from early residents of New Hampshire <b>and</b> <b>Maine.</b> Frederick Parker Gay, one of E. E. Southard's longtime friends and his posthumous biographer, wrote that Southard's parents were only modestly successful academically. His mother was a schoolteacher for several years; his father, who supervised a cotton-waste factory and established a trucking business, earned enough money to ensure that Southard {{did not have to}} work during his undergraduate and graduate studies.|$|E
5|$|The Boston and Lowell Railroad (B) {{opened to}} Lowell on June 24, 1835. Many {{of the present}} {{stations}} on the line opened soon after; however, the B did not open a station at Bacon Street in southern Winchester until the early 1850s. The station, located near a bridge over the Aberjona River, was variously known as Mystic, Bacons Bridge, and Symmes Bridge (the latter after a nearby landowner). After 1887, the B was leased to its former rival, the Boston <b>and</b> <b>Maine</b> Railroad, as its New Hampshire Main Line.|$|E

5|$|The Boston <b>and</b> <b>Maine</b> Railroad built a new, {{more modern}} station in 1952 but reused the 1914-built platforms. This single-story {{building}}, {{located on the}} south side of the tracks at Mt. Vernon and Exchange streets, was in the same flat-roofed brick style as Winchester Center and Wedgemere built five years later. The building was the first on the Boston & Maine system to have radiant heat, and also included a restaurant and newsstand. The 1895-built station was demolished to make room for a parking lot. Saugus Branch service ended in May 1958, leaving through service on the Eastern Route as the only trains serving Lynn. Around this time, the third and fourth tracks through the station were removed due to reduced traffic, leaving the station with effectively two side platforms serving two tracks.|$|E
