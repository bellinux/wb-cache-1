Recognition increases the visibility and prestige of the profession and promotes other efforts to advance its development.

According to the local meteorological data, the wind velocity and wind direction are analyzed separately in summer and winter according to different land-use control scenario. The simulation results reveal that the local wind environment was improved by the land-use control measure.
