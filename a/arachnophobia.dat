5|$|Spiders {{have been}} present for many decades both in film and on television, {{predominantly}} in the horror genre. Those who suffer from <b>arachnophobia,</b> an acute fear of spiders, become particularly horrified. The spider web {{is used as a}} motif to adorn dark passageways, depicting the recesses of the unknown.|$|E
5|$|<b>Arachnophobia</b> is a {{specific}} phobia—it is the abnormal fear of spiders or anything reminiscent of spiders, such as webs or spider-like shapes. It {{is one of the}} most common specific phobias, and some statistics show that 50% of women and 10% of men show symptoms. It may be an exaggerated form of an instinctive response that helped early humans to survive, or a cultural phenomenon that is most common in predominantly European societies.|$|E
5|$|While {{the venom}} {{of a few}} species is {{dangerous}} to humans, scientists are now researching the use of spider venom in medicine and as non-polluting pesticides. Spider silk provides a combination of lightness, strength and elasticity that is superior to that of synthetic materials, and spider silk genes have been inserted into mammals and plants to see if these {{can be used as}} silk factories. As a result of their wide range of behaviors, spiders have become common symbols in art and mythology symbolizing various combinations of patience, cruelty and creative powers. An abnormal fear of spiders is called <b>arachnophobia.</b>|$|E

25|$|Delena cancerides, {{the flat}} huntsman spider or social huntsman spider, is a large, brown huntsman spider native to Australia. It has been {{introduced}} to New Zealand, where it is sometimes known as the Avondale spider as they are commonly found in the suburb of Avondale, Auckland. This was the species used {{in the beginning of}} the movie Spider-Man and widely in <b>Arachnophobia,</b> and both films depict them as having a deadly venomous bite, but they are generally considered harmless to humans in real-life. It was first described by Charles Athanase Walckenaer in 1837.|$|E
25|$|Propranolol {{is being}} {{investigated}} as a potential treatment for PTSD. Propranolol works to inhibit the actions of norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter that enhances memory consolidation. Individuals given propranolol immediately after trauma experienced fewer stress-related symptoms and lower rates of PTSD than respective control groups who did not receive the drug. Due {{to the fact that}} memories and their emotional content are reconsolidated in the hours after they are recalled/re-experienced, propranolol can also diminish the emotional impact of already formed memories; for this reason, it is also being studied in the treatment of specific phobias, such as <b>arachnophobia,</b> dental fear, and social phobia.|$|E
25|$|Cameron's {{choice of}} cinematographer {{on the movie}} was Mikael Salomon – a US-based Danish {{national}} who {{would go on to}} work on other blockbusters such as Backdraft and <b>Arachnophobia</b> before moving into the director's slot on a myriad of films and TV shows including two editions of the acclaimed HBO WW2 series Band of Brothers. Salomon used three cameras in watertight housings that were specially designed. Another special housing was designed for scenes that went from above-water dialogue to below-water dialogue. The filmmakers had {{to figure out how to}} keep the water clear enough to shoot and dark enough to look realistic at 2,000 feet (700 m), which was achieved by floating a thick layer of plastic beads in the water and covering the top of the tank with an enormous tarpaulin. Cameron wanted to see the actors' faces and hear their dialogue, and thus hired Western Space and Marine to engineer helmets which would remain optically clear underwater and installed state-of-the-art aircraft quality microphones into each helmet. Safety conditions were also a major factor with the installation of a decompression chamber on site, along with a diving bell and a safety diver for each actor.|$|E
500|$|The fear of spiders {{culminates in}} <b>Arachnophobia,</b> a 1990 movie in which spiders {{multiply}} in large numbers. On the other hand, {{a person who}} admires spiders {{is referred to as}} an [...] "arachnophile"; such as Virginia, an orphan who likes to play spider games in the black comedy horror B movie, Spider Baby.|$|E
500|$|Snowy (Milou in Hergé's {{original}} version), a white Wire Fox Terrier dog, is Tintin's loyal, four-legged companion. The {{bond between}} Snowy and Tintin is very deep, {{as they have}} saved each other from perilous situations many times. Snowy frequently [...] "speaks" [...] to the reader through his thoughts (often displaying a dry sense of humour), which are not heard by the human characters in the story. Snowy has nearly let Tintin down on occasion, particularly when distracted by a bone. Like Captain Haddock, he is fond of Loch Lomond brand Scotch whisky, and his occasional bouts of drinking tend to get him into trouble. When not distracted, Snowy is generally fearless, his only fear being <b>arachnophobia.</b> [...] When Tintin gets tied up by villains (which often happens), Snowy is usually able to free him by biting through the rope.|$|E
500|$|It took {{eight months}} for Enigma {{to build the}} physics behind the web-based grapple and swing game mechanic. During early builds of the game, the motion was slower, but the {{development}} team sped up the movement, feeling it was truer to the character. The Sonic the Hedgehog series served as an inspiration for the game's pace. Significant effort was put into creating the game's visual style and making Spidy a relatable, charismatic character. Daniel Parente cited Limbo, Braid, and Patapon as influences for the game's aesthetics. Comics and cartoons served as influences for Spidy's design. The character was given a pair of large yellow eyes, which allowed the character to emote. Two of the legs were removed, bringing the total from eight to six, which Andrew McKerrow described {{as an effort to}} avoid triggering the fears of people with <b>arachnophobia</b> and [...] "make the character a little more friendly looking and little less creepy". It was only after making these changes to Spidy that the developers decided to make Spidy an extraterrestrial, as that would justify the character design's deviations from regular spiders.|$|E
500|$|Some {{aspects of}} Limbo bore out from Jensen's own past, {{such as the}} forest areas that were similar to forests around the farm where he grew up, and the spider coming from Jensen's <b>arachnophobia.</b> Jensen drew {{inspiration}} from film genres, including works of film noir, to set the art style of the game; the team's graphic artist, Morten Bramsen, is credited with recreating that art style. Much of the game's flow was storyboarded very early in development, such as the boy's encounters with spiders and mind-controlling worms, {{as well as the}} overall transition from a forest to a city, then to an abstract environment. As development progressed, some of the original ideas became too difficult for the small team to complete. The storyline also changed; originally, the spider sequences were to be present {{near the end of the}} game, but were later moved to the first part. In retrospect, Jensen was aware that the first half of the game contained more scripted events and encounters, while the second half of the game was lonelier and puzzle-heavy; Jensen attributed this to his lack of oversight during the latter stages of development. Jensen purposely left the game with an open ending though with a specific interpretation only he knew, though noted after the game's release that some players, posting in forum boards, had suggested resolutions that were [...] "scary close" [...] to his ideas.|$|E
2500|$|According to Rowling, Ron {{was among}} the {{characters}} she created [...] "the very first day". Ron is inspired by Rowling's best friend Sean Harris (to whom Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is dedicated), but she has clearly stated that she [...] "never set out to describe Sean in Ron, but Ron has a Sean-ish turn of phrase." [...] Like Harris is to Rowling, Ron is [...] "always there" [...] when Harry needs him. The character of Ron fits many of the stereotypes expected of the sidekick; he is often used as comic relief, is loyal to the hero, and lacks much of the talent Harry possesses, {{at least in terms}} of magical power; however, he proves his bravery several times, such as playing 'real wizard's chess' in the first book, and entering into the Forbidden Forest with Harry during the second book despite his <b>arachnophobia.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Still, {{the film}} {{did not perform}} as well at the box office. The trailer {{introduced}} the film to audiences by displaying a surface of water intercut with scenes from the original. A narrator goes over the rules regarding how to safely handle mogwai. After the narrator says, [...] "You didn't listen ," [...] scenes from the sequel are shown, revealing the gremlins morphing into strange new creatures and then ending with the Brain Gremlin speaking. Gremlins 2 was released into US theatres on June 15, 1990, {{the same day as}} Dick Tracy. In its first weekend it made $9,702,804, and it ultimately made $41,482,207. It was thus only the thirty-first highest-grossing film of the year, behind a few other films in the comedy, horror or fantasy genre, such as Back to the Future Part III ($87,727,583), Edward Scissorhands ($56,362,352), and <b>Arachnophobia</b> ($53,208,180). It did, however, outperform Predator 2 ($30,669,413), Child's Play 2 ($28,501,605) and The Exorcist III ($26,098,824).|$|E
