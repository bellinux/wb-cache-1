The objective for on-road navigation is {{to guide the}} vehicle traveling on paved or prepared road according to a scheduled path plan, and for on-field guidance is to guide the vehicle following crop rows without overrun on crops. In this paper, the authors have presented an on-field navigation system with redundant sensors of a vision sensor, a fiber optic gyroscope (FOG), and RTK GPS. A steering controller has been developed to implement steering control based on guidance information obtained from guidance sensors. The navigation system has evaluated on an <b>agricultural</b> <b>vehicle.</b> A research platform has been developed based on a Case-IH Magnum 1 * 8920 2 -wheel drive agricultural tractor.

Online computer controlled steering system for a vehicle utilizing two independent drive wheels can be used to avoid obstacles and to improve the ability to resist external side forces. To control the steer angles of the nondriven wheels, the mathematical relationships between the drive wheel speeds and the steer angles of the nondriven wheels are used. A fuzzy logic controller is designed to change the drive wheel speeds and to achieve the desired steer angles.

40|$|A {{feasibility}} study of machine vision applications was conducted for <b>agricultural</b> <b>vehicle</b> navigation in open field environments, {{and focused on}} solving certain fundamental issues in vision-based <b>agricultural</b> <b>vehicle</b> navigation. Those issues were: (1) camera installation pose automatic calibration; (2) vehicle heading estimation and (3) field edge detection. A stereo color camera was selected to support the research on the three issues. Stereo cameras {{have been used as}} perception sensors for <b>agricultural</b> <b>vehicle</b> navigation for years. One problem impeding their broader application is the difficulty of determining the camera’s installation pose using conventional measuring tools, especially when they are used in an open-field agricultural environment. To solve this problem, an automated calibration method was developed to determine the camera’s installation pose with respect to the vehicle frame. Based on this method, a binocular stereo camera acquired a sequence of images as the vehicle moved straight forward a short distance on relatively even ground. A machine vision algorithm was used to detect static feature points on the ground and track their three-dimensional (3 D) motions in relationship to the vehicle. A plane fitting for the ground features was then used to determine the camera roll and pitch, and the tracked motions were used to estimate the camera yaw. The result...|$|R

40|$|<b>Agricultural</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{operators}} {{are exposed to}} intense vibrations mainly induced by soil unevenness. Since most of tractors are not equipped with any chassis suspension, the seat is the only system able to reduce the vibrations experienced by the operator. Traditional passive seats amplify vibrations at frequencies close to their natural frequencies. The first natural frequency of typical passive seats with an air spring and a hydraulic shock-absorber is between 1. 5 and 4 Hz. Thus their efficiency is poor for low frequencies and high amplitudes. In order to improve comfort of operators, active or semi-active suspensions for the seat can be introduced. An active suspension system for the seat of an <b>agricultural</b> <b>vehicle</b> relying on an active air spring is presented in this paper. The capability {{of the system of}} improving comfort of operators has been evaluated through simulations carried out with a validated model of the entire vehicle. Results of the proposed active suspension system are compared with ones provided by the passive suspension and the ones provided by an active system where the traditional passive shock-absorber is substituted by a controllable hydraulic actuator...|$|R
