40|$|There is {{increasing}} interest in applying {{the concept of}} safety culture in Air Traffic Management (ATM). Using a mixed methods approach, this paper describes {{the development of a}} safety culture management toolkit that uses questionnaires and safety culture feedback workshops. The development process involved four phases. Phase 1 involved a review of the safety culture literature from 2001 to 2005 to identify relevant safety culture themes. Phase 2 involved conducting interviews with personnel (n = 52) from four geographically disparate European Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) to validate and identify themes relevant to ATM. Follow-up focus groups (n = 3) consolidated the themes, and developed a preliminary set of questionnaire items; Phase 3 involved piloting a safety culture survey instrument with ATM staff (n = 537) in four countries. Construct validity of the questionnaire was tested using both Exploratory and Confirmatory factor analysis (EFA, CFA). Substantial refinement of the item set was required to establish a consistent model, and a second sample (n = 883) was surveyed to replicate the model. Phase 4 involved conducting feedback workshops with ANSP personnel in study locations (n = 7) in order to further validate the themes identified in the questionnaire. These were used to develop qualitative insights (e. g. specific safety problems and solutions) relating to the results of the questionnaire at each ANSP. The study aimed to develop a bespoke quantitative measurement instrument (and qualitative feedback tool) with construct and discriminant validity, and the ability to consistently measure safety culture in ANSPs throughout Europe, and facilitate safety improvements in air traffic management. This aim was partially achieved, and although the safety culture toolkit was perceived as useful for exploring and highlighting safety issues at a local <b>ANSP</b> <b>level,</b> further work is required. This will involve developing the tool to ensure it operates consistently in different national and cultural setting, and designing metrics for testing the criterion validity of the safety culture toolkit...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} model and a {{numerical}} example to analyse capacity decisions within a re-designed Air Traffic Management (ATM) value-chain. We assume a new role for the Network Manager (NM), having contractual relations with Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) and Aircraft Operators (AOs). The NM orders en-route airspace capacity from <b>ANSPs</b> at strategic <b>level</b> and defines/adjusts sector opening schemes at pre-tactical level (capacity management). On the demand side, the NM offers trajectory products to AOs, which are defined based on both AOsâ€™ business/operational needs and network performance goals (demand management). In this context, we develop a mathematical model which underlines {{a part of this}} joint capacity and demand management process. The model aims at minimizing the sum of cost of capacity provision and cost of delays and re-routings, by managing airspace sector configuration over time and trajectory assignments. We use a realistic numerical study on a small-scale network to illustrate joint capacity and demand management decisions, as well as trade-offs between different performance indicators...|$|R
