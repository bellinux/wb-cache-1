25|$|Six {{months after}} Hüsker Dü's breakup, Hart {{discovered}} that his diagnosis as being HIV-positive was incorrect. In 1988 he released the solo EP, 2541, on Hüsker Dü's former label SST. The title {{is taken from}} the address of his former band's office and rehearsal house, where the members had at one time lived. Marshall Crenshaw would later cover the title song, as would the Go-Betweens' Robert Forster. After {{the release of the}} EP, Hart went further into sobriety, recording and releasing the album Intolerance and the associated EP <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>My</b> Senses in 1989 and 1990, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Since {{my life as}} a {{prisoner}} has begun, I have heard the teachings of the white man's religion, and in many respects believe it to be better than the religion of my fathers... Believing that in a wise way it is good to go to church, and that associating with Christians would improve my character, I have adopted the Christian religion. I believe that the church has helped me much during the short time I have been a member. I am not ashamed to be a Christian, and I am glad to know that the President of the United States is a Christian, for without the help of the Almighty I do not think he could rightly judge in ruling so many people. I have advised <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> people who are not Christians, to study that religion, because {{it seems to me the}} best religion in enabling one to live right.|$|E
25|$|Though it isn't {{much of a}} refrain as most of Redding's {{version is}} made up of shorter verses, this line appears as a {{conclusion}} to every verse and echoes into the next line tying it all together. Redding's short refrain comes {{at the end of each}} verse and leads into the next. “Redding’s version is characteristically funky, with his raspy-soulful singing and electric vocal charisma front and center.” His song utilizes “playful horns and sexy, mock-beleaguered vocals” to deliver lyrics without any subtext. The message of a man demanding respect from his woman for being the breadwinner is decisively clear. Redding's version was written from the perspective of a hardworking man who can only look forward to getting home and finally receiving the respect he deserves from his family. His version is less a plea for respect and more a comment on a man's feeling of worth in his work life and at home. He mentions that he’s “about to, just give you <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> money,” and that all he wants in return is respect. The woman he is singing to can even “do me wrong, honey, if you wanna to/You can do me wrong honey, while I'm gone.” The lyrics are repetitive and straightforward throughout the song; there isn’t any layering of messages or intentions.|$|E

500|$|Jaws: The Revenge {{received}} negative {{reviews from}} film critics. While {{production of the}} other three films in the series took around two years for each film, Jaws: The Revenge was made in less than nine months.

500|$|Besides 3D effects, {{the filmmakers}} also used 2D artwork and {{drawings}} for specific elements and sequences in the film, including Elsa's magic and snow sculptures, {{as well as}} freezing fountains and floors.

[...] "We can take this virtual set that's mimicking <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> actions {{and put it into}} any one of our scenes in the film," [...] said technology manager Evan Goldberg.|$|E

500|$|Patton's {{words were}} later written {{down by a}} number of troops who {{witnessed}} his remarks, and so a number of iterations exist with differences in wording. Historian Terry Brighton constructed a full speech from a number of soldiers who recounted the speech in their memoirs, including Gilbert R. Cook, Hobart R. Gay, {{and a number of other}} junior soldiers. Patton only wrote briefly of his orations in his diary, noting, [...] "as in <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> talks, I stressed fighting and killing." [...] The speech later became so popular that it was called simply [...] "Patton's speech" [...] or [...] "The speech" [...] when referencing the general.|$|E
500|$|In 1948, Hemingway and Mary {{traveled}} to Europe, staying in Venice for several months. While there, Hemingway {{fell in love}} with the then 19-year-old Adriana Ivancich. The platonic love affair inspired the novel Across the River and into the Trees, written in Cuba during a time of strife with Mary, and published in 1950 to negative reviews. The following year, furious at the critical reception of Across the River and Into the Trees, he wrote the draft of The Old Man and the Sea in eight weeks, saying that it was [...] "the best I can write ever for <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life". The Old Man and the Sea became a book-of-the-month selection, made Hemingway an international celebrity, and won the Pulitzer Prize in May 1952, a month before he left for his second trip to Africa.|$|E

500|$|In 1962 {{she left}} Martha Jackson Gallery {{for a brief}} stint at the Sidney Janis Gallery. After an {{unsuccessful}} first show in which none of her work sold, Nevelson had a falling out with gallery owner Janis over sums he advanced her {{and was unable to}} recoup. Nevelson and Janis entered into a contentious legal battle that left Nevelson broke, depressed, and at risk of becoming homeless. However, at this time Nevelson was offered a funded, six-week artist fellowship at Tamarind Lithography Workshop (now Tamarind Institute) in Los Angeles, which allowed her to escape the drama of New York City. She explained, [...] "I wouldn't ordinarily have gone. I didn't care so much about the idea of prints at that time but I desperately needed {{to get out of town}} and <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> expenses were paid." ...|$|E

You have to go through those things and make the changes you have to make and be there and go, 'Okay, I did it.' It doesn't come that easy. [...] I just didn't hold back this time, and writing that way has made me feel really purified, like I've actually gotten a chance to break through instead of just wallowing in <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> problems. It's not about all the times that I've been afraid and tormented and sad, it's about looking at those situations and stomping them out. It feels really good to sing these songs now." ...|$|E

[...] Chamberlin stressed that the split was amicable, commenting, [...] "I am glad [...] has chosen to continue under the name. It is his right." [...] Chamberlin soon formed the band Skysaw, which has released an album and toured in support of Minus the Bear. In July 2009, Billy Corgan formed a new group called Spirits in the Sky, initially as a tribute band to Sky Saxon of The Seeds, who had recently died. The following month Corgan confirmed on the band's website that 19-year-old Spirits in the Sky drummer Mike Byrne had replaced Chamberlin and that the pair was working on new Pumpkins recordings.|$|E

No social paradox, no historic disaster, no hideous record of injustice or misery should keep me from Him. No question of Scriptural integrity, no torment over the fate of this or that atheist or gay friend, no worry for those condemned and ostracized by my church or any other church should stand between me and Him. The reason? It was magnificently simple: He knew how or why everything happened; He knew the disposition of every single soul. He wasn't going to let anything happen by accident! Nobody {{was going to go to}} Hell by mistake." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the early}} stages of her career, Perry's musical style gravitated towards gospel and she aspired to be as {{successful}} as Amy Grant. At the age of 15, she heard Queen's [...] "Killer Queen," [...] which inspired her to pursue a career in music. She cites the band's frontman, Freddie Mercury, as her biggest influence and expressed how the [...] "combination of his sarcastic approach to writing lyrics and his 'I don't give a fuck' attitude" [...] inspired her music. She paid homage to the band by naming her third fragrance Killer Queen. Perry described The Beach Boys and their album Pet Sounds as having a considerable influence on her music: [...] "Pet Sounds {{is one of my favorite}} records and it influenced pretty much <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> songwriting. All of the melody choices that I make are because of Pet Sounds."

In {{an interview with}} MTV, Beyoncé said, [...] "When I recorded 'Déjà Vu' [...] I knew that even before I started working on my album, I wanted to add live instruments to <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> songs..." [...] The album's second single [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] is noted {{for the use of}} a siren in its melody. It was called a song that [...] "shows a harder edge to Beyoncé'ss sound". [...] "Freakum Dress" [...] is a crescendo that uses a two-note riff and galloping beats. The song [...] "advises women who have partners with straying eyes to put on sexy dresses and grind on other guys in the club to regain their affections." [...] Meanwhile, the use of the [...] "uh-huh huh huh" [...] vocals and brassy stabs in the song [...] "Green Light" [...] is a direct echo to [...] "Crazy in Love", according to Peter Robinson of The Guardian.|$|E
