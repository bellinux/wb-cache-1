5|$|Transition-minimized {{differential}} signaling (TMDS) on HDMI interleaves video, {{audio and}} auxiliary data using three different packet types, called the Video Data Period, the Data Island Period and the Control Period. During the Video Data Period, the pixels of an <b>active</b> <b>video</b> line are transmitted. During the Data Island period (which occurs during the {{horizontal and vertical}} blanking intervals), audio and auxiliary data are transmitted within a series of packets. The Control Period occurs between Video and Data Island periods.|$|E

25|$|Similar to {{physical}} memory, allowing applications {{direct access to}} controller ports and registers can cause the controller to malfunction, or system to crash. With this, depending on {{the complexity of the}} device, some devices can get surprisingly complex to program, and use several different controllers. Because of this, providing a more abstract interface to manage the device is important. This interface is normally done by a Device Driver or Hardware Abstraction Layer. Frequently, applications will require access to these devices. The Kernel must maintain the list of these devices by querying the system for them in some way. This can be done through the BIOS, or through one of the various system buses (such as PCI/PCIE, or USB). When an application requests an operation on a device (Such as displaying a character), the kernel needs to send this request to the current <b>active</b> <b>video</b> driver. The video driver, in turn, needs to carry out this request. This is an example of Inter Process Communication (IPC).|$|E

Energy expenditure (kcal) derived from oxygen consumption (VO 2) was continuously assessed while children played nonactive and <b>active</b> console <b>video</b> games. Physical activity was assessed continu-ously using the Actigraph accelerometer. Significant (p <. 001) increases from baseline were found for energy expenditure (129 – 400 %), heart rate (43 – 84 %), and activity counts (122 – 1, 288 versus 0 – 23) when playing the <b>active</b> console <b>video</b> games.
