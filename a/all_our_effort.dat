To {{continue to live in}} the Spirit demands <b>all</b> <b>our</b> <b>effort,</b> all our courage and patience and faith. We cannot, as you say, promise to love for life. But the marriage service, interpreted, means that we will use all our human endeavour, {{with the help of the}} Spirit, to remain in what may be called the reborn state, since it is by the Spirit alone that true marriage is sanctified.

60|$|One morning, {{some weeks}} after her arrival at Lowick, Dorothea--but why always Dorothea? Was her {{point of view}} the only {{possible}} one with regard to this marriage? I protest against all our interest, <b>all</b> <b>our</b> <b>effort</b> at understanding being given to the young skins that look blooming in spite of trouble; for these too will get faded, and will know the older and more eating griefs which we are helping to neglect. In spite of the blinking eyes and white moles objectionable to Celia, and the want of muscular curve which was morally painful to Sir James, Mr. Casaubon had an intense consciousness within him, and was spiritually a-hungered like the rest of us. He had done nothing exceptional in marrying--nothing but what society sanctions, and considers an occasion for wreaths and bouquets. It had occurred to him that he must not any longer defer his intention of matrimony, and he had reflected that in taking a wife, a man of good position should expect and carefully choose a blooming young lady--the younger the better, because more educable and submissive--of a rank equal to his own, of religious principles, virtuous disposition, and good understanding. On such a young lady he would make handsome settlements, and he would neglect no arrangement for her happiness: in return, he should receive family pleasures and leave behind him that copy of himself which seemed so urgently required of a man--to the sonneteers of the sixteenth century. Times had altered since then, and no sonneteer had insisted on Mr. Casaubon's leaving a copy of himself; moreover, he had not yet succeeded in issuing copies of his mythological key; but he had always intended to acquit himself by marriage, and the sense that he was fast leaving the years behind him, that the world was getting dimmer and that he felt lonely, was a reason to him for losing no more time in overtaking domestic delights before they too were left behind by the years.|$|E

We draw on a great deal of previous work on notations for architectures and PLAs, and on UML as a notation for architectures and for frameworks, attempting to identify the salient points of this particular question. 1 Scope As UML becomes more widely accepted, it is inevitable that some organisations that use product line architectures will describe them using UML as their diagrammatic language, alongside other description elements. This paper attempts to identify advantages and disadvantages of doing so. As far as possible, it tries to consider the issues specific to PLAs, and to steer clear of more general architecture description issues. For reasons of space we assume considerable familiarity with UML. 2 Is this the right question? For example, why should we not put <b>all</b> <b>our</b> <b>effort</b> into inventi [...] ...|$|E

40|$|On October 8 th, 2011 the Earth {{encountered}} the dust trails left by comet 21 P/Giacobini- Zinner during its XIX and XX century perihelion approaches. The encounter was forecasted {{in great detail}} [1, 2, 3]. Geometic circumstances were very favourable to produce a meteor storm, but unfortunately the trails were older than in previous 1933 and 1946 historical encounters. As {{a consequence of the}} decreased flux number density in the comet trails, during the 2011 Draconid night the Zenital Hourly Rate (ZHR) only just reached the outburst level with about 400 meteors/hour, and the display was strongly attenuated for visual observers due to the Moon observing circumstances [4]. Despite this, the possibility of recording usual meteor activity coming from a lowgeocentric velocity meteoroid stream motivated us to develop a special observing campaign. The encounter of our planet with dense meteoroid streams in such favourable geometric circumstances could be representative of the organic and water delivery processes that probably participated in the terrestrial enrichment due to the massive disruption of comets that occurred {{at the time of the}} Late Heavy Bombardment [4]. Consequently, we put <b>all</b> <b>our</b> <b>effort</b> in studying this presentday rare encounter using the multistation CCD and video monitoring available in the Spanish Meteor Network (SPMN) infrastructure together with additional amateur monitoring stations. SPMN high sensitivity CCD and video cameras were able to record hundreds of meteors that are allowing us to get valuable flux and orbital information on the meteoroids that produced the outburst. Some of the campaign highlights are really astonishing as, for example, the detection of a - 11 absolute magnitude Draconid bolide over Andalusia, Spain produced by a 14 kg Giacobinid meteoroid [5]. In this abstract we present some preliminary results on the magnitude of the meteoroid flux arrived to Earth and the first orbits computed so far by our team...|$|E
