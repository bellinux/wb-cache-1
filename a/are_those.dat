5|$|Both innate and {{adaptive}} immunity {{depend on the}} ability of the immune system to distinguish between self and non-self molecules. In immunology, self molecules <b>are</b> <b>those</b> components of an organism's body that can be distinguished from foreign substances by the immune system. Conversely, non-self molecules <b>are</b> <b>those</b> recognized as foreign molecules. One class of non-self molecules are called antigens (short for antibody generators) and are defined as substances that bind to specific immune receptors and elicit an immune response.|$|E

30|$|The {{following}} definitions {{were used}} for study parameters: True positive (TP) scans <b>were</b> <b>those</b> in which a breast lesion was histologically proven to be an invasive breast cancer or a ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). True negative (TN) scans <b>were</b> <b>those</b> without a suspicious lesion seen on imaging and no breast cancer was diagnosed in the next 12  months. False negative (FN) scans <b>were</b> <b>those</b> that did not detect a suspicious breast lesion, but a breast cancer was detected in the following 12  months. False positive (FP) scans <b>were</b> <b>those</b> that resulted in biopsy that was subsequently benign. Sensitivity (Se) was defined as TPR = TP/(TP + FN), and specificity (Sp) was defined as TNR = TN/(TN + FP).|$|R
