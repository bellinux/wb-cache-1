5|$|<b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>changed</b> {{with the}} {{assassination}} of Tsar Alexander II. The mourning for the tsar meant {{there would be no}} performances in the capital; in addition the political climate of Russia turned sharply against the Jews. Goldfaden's troupe soldiered on for a time—to Minsk, to Bobruisk where they played mainly to Russian soldiers, and to Vitebsk, where he and Sonya ended up having to sue Goldfaden for their pay, and left to rejoin Rosenberg, who was playing in a tent theater in Nezhin. However, matters there proved even worse: Nezhin soon fell prey to a pogrom. The troupe managed to avoid bodily harm, partly by convincing the rioters that they were a French theater troupe and partly by making judicious use of the money the Adlers had won in court from Goldfaden.|$|E

25|$|<b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>changed</b> when Mike Holmgren {{became the}} Packers {{head coach in}} 1992. During his first year, the team {{improved}} to a 9–7 regular season record, barely missing the playoffs. One of the significant players on the 1992 Packers team was second-year quarterback Brett Favre, who spent his rookie season as a third-string quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons. During a September 20, 1992 game against the Cincinnati Bengals, Favre replaced injured starter Don Majkowski and proceeded to lead the team to a comeback victory. Afterwards, Favre became the starter {{for the rest of}} that season and held that position with the Packers until his purported retirement and subsequent conditional trade to the New York Jets in 2008 (followed by a departure for Minnesota in 2009).|$|E

2500|$|But in the 1540s, <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>changed.</b> [...] "With the {{conscious}} patronage {{and support of}} the crown", notes historian N. A. M. Rodger, [...] "the established iron industry in the Weald of Kent and Sussex was encouraged to experiment with gunfounding iron. The first iron muzzle-loaders were cast at Buxted in 1543." [...] In 1545, Parson Levett was ordered to produce 120 of his state-of-the-art cannons as well as a large amount of ammunition. Suddenly the English iron-masters had become the yardstick by which armorers were measured. Because of the proximity of timber, the importation of foreign (primarily French) ironworkers, and effective new forging methods, the English guns were superior to those manufactured on the European continent. The new English guns were so effective that laws were quickly passed to prevent their export to enemies on the continent.|$|E

Alexander, whose {{paternal}} family roots could {{be traced back to}} Portugal, was a lifelong resident of San Leandro, California. He would inherit the family business, The Santos Linguica Factory and then would proclaim himself the [...] "Sausage King," [...] {{after the death of his}} father, who had successfully run the once thriving business for many years, (apparently without complaints from and apparently favors from state and federal inspectors) in 1993. Alexander's father, Tweedy, had been well known in the local and national business circles as an astute businessman, and had been recognized and renowned for making arguably the finest linguica sausage in the Bay Area, if not nationwide. He had been grooming the young Stuart for years, particularly after the death of his eldest son, Stefen (August 8, 1958 – May 25, 1977), who died at the age of eighteen in a motorcycle accident. Stefen was set to inherit the reins of the company, but after his passing, <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>changed.</b> Tweedy had no choice but to pass the reins to the next eldest son, Stuart. However, Tweedy had little faith that Stuart could run the company. Stuart's father was verbally abusive to his son, often telling him that he would [...] "never amount to anything".|$|E

2500|$|After {{performing}} Camelot for six months, in July 1961, Burton met producer Walter Wanger {{who asked}} him to replace Stephen Boyd as Mark Antony in director Joseph L. Mankiewicz's magnum opus Cleopatra. Burton was paid $250,000 for four months work in the film. The gigantic scale of the film's troubled production, Taylor's bouts of illness and fluctuating weight, Burton's off-screen relationship with the actress, (which he gave the sardonic nickname [...] "Le Scandale") all generated enormous publicity; Life magazine proclaimed it the [...] "Most Talked About Movie Ever Made". Fox's future appeared to hinge on what became the most expensive movie ever made until then, with costs reaching almost $40million. During filming, Burton met {{and fell in love}} with Elizabeth Taylor, who was then married to Eddie Fisher. According to Alpert, at their first meeting on the set while posing for their publicity photographs, Burton said, [...] "Has anyone ever told you that you're a very pretty girl?" [...] Taylor later recalled, [...] "I said to myself, Oy gevalt, here's the great lover, the great wit, the great intellectual of Wales, and he comes out with a line like that." [...] Bragg contradicts Alpert by pointing out that Burton could not stand Taylor at first, calling her [...] "Miss Tits" [...] and opined to Mankiewicz, [...] "I expect she shaves"; he saw her simply as another celebrity with no acting talent. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>changed</b> when, in their first scene together, Burton was shaky and forgot his lines, and she soothed and helped him; it was at this instance, according to Taylor, that she fell for him. Soon the affair began in earnest; both Fisher and Sybil were unable to bear it. While Fisher fled the sets for Gstaad, Sybil went first for Céligny and then headed off to London. Olivier, shocked by Burton's affair with Taylor, cabled him: [...] "Make up your mind, dear heart. Do you want to be a great actor or a household word?". Burton replied [...] "Both".|$|E
