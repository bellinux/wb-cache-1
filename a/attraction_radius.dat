40|$|At {{auditing}} a fair {{the measure}} {{and evaluation of}} the exhibitors’ distance is a important task {{and can be used}} for further promotion of the fair. In analyzing the <b>attraction</b> <b>radius</b> of different fairs one can discover some figures that may raise questions regarding a simple averaging of the attraction distances. According to the research of the author, the bias in the <b>attraction</b> <b>radius</b> can be caused by two factors: the size of the attraction region and the distance from the region’s business center. Authors explored the bias factors and suggest a correction method to remedy it. A theoretical correction model was applied to evaluate three agribusiness fairs.

For comparison, Hebbian correlation LR retrieves only up to 14 %N prototypes (N is the size of the network).

40|$|The {{fact that}} {{reducing}} self-connections improves {{the performance of}} the autoassociative networks built by the pseudo-inverse learning rule is known already for quite a while, but is not studied completely yet. In particular, it is known that decreasing of self-connection increases the direct <b>attraction</b> <b>radius</b> of the network, but it also known that it increases the number of spurious dynamic attractors. Thus, it has been concluded that the optimal value of the coefficient of self-connection reduction D lies somewhere in the range (0; 0. 5). This paper gives an explicit answer to the question what is the optimal value of the self-connection reduction. It shows how the indirect <b>attraction</b> <b>radius</b> increases with the decrease of D. The summary of the results pertaining to the phenomenon is presented. I.

However, {{it is not}} well known how {{the strength of a}} stimulus source affects the geometry of animal movement in architecturally complex environments. We mapped the 3 D vegetation architecture of four apple trees of varying morphology and age and recorded the paths of apple maggot flies Rhagoletis pomonella foraging for artificial fruit. We compared the observed movement with the one obtained from a random walk model on a graph to estimate both 1) the <b>attraction</b> <b>radius</b> and strength of a fruit and 2) the relative roles of the architecture of vegetation and of the strength of attraction of a fruit on the movement of flies. The <b>attraction</b> <b>radius</b> is the maximal distance at which a stimulus source biases the movement of individuals and the attraction strength measures how strong this bias is. Plant architectural complexity is defined according to both foliage density and its 3 D distribution within the canopy. A single fruit induces a bias in the path orientation of an insect that is at a large distance, relative to a tree volume, but it has no effect on the step length of moves. The plant complexity makes a minor contribution to defining the radius of the sphere of attraction, but a large contribution to the attraction strength. Conditional on visiting the location, the plant architecture plays a minor role compared to that of the presence of the fruit. Our findings show that the complexity of the environment can alter the use of sensory information, which has important implications for animal movements in complex environments. The importance of our results in animal dispersal and foraging is considered...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe global {{convergence}} and asymptotic {{stability of}} Hopfield neural networks {{are known to}} be bases of successful applications of networks in various computing and recognition tasks. However, all previous studies on the networks assumed that the interconnection matrix is symmetric or antisymmetric. In this paper the two fundamental properties of the networks are studied without a symmetry assumption. It is proved that the networks will be globally convergent to a stable state if the interconnection matrix is weakly diagonally dominant in a sense to be defined. Furthermore, under any one of conditions assuring global convergence of the network, the maximal <b>attraction</b> <b>radius</b> of any one of stable states is found to be half of the distribution distance of the state to the network. The obtained results not only generalize the existing results, but also provide a theoretical foundation of performance analysis and new applications of the Hopfield networks...|$|E

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{presents a}} novel method of image processing using the polynomial bidirectional hetero-associative network (PBHAN). This network {{can be used}} for industrial application of optical character recognition. According to the results of detailed simulations, the PBHAN has a higher capacity for pattern pair storage than do the conventional bidirectional associative memories and fuzzy memories. The practical capacity of a PBHAN considering fault tolerance is discussed. The fault tolerance requirement leads to the discovery of the <b>attraction</b> <b>radius</b> of the basin for each stored pattern pair. PBHAN takes advantage of fuzzy characteristics in evolution equations such that the signal-noise-ratio is significantly increased.

40|$|Summary &mdash; The {{dispersal}} {{range and}} the flight behaviour of lps sexdentatus in pine forest were studied using mark-recapture experiments. 9 614 beetles were marked by the elytra engraving meth-od and released just after emergence. They were caught at different distances in pheromone baited traps. Less than 10 % of the beetles failed to take off. Flyers were captured at distances up to 4 km. The main dispersal occurred during the first day. When wind speed rose> 3 m/s, beetles were main-ly caught in the upwind direction at the shortest trapping distances and mainly in the downwind di-rection at the longest trapping distances. For the same trap density, the number of beetles captured increased with trapping distance. This was interpreted as a flight exercise requisite prior to chemo-tropic orientation. The trapping <b>attraction</b> <b>radius</b> was estimated at 80 m. These findings bring into question {{the use of the}} pheromone trapping system for the control and prognosis of lps sexdentatus...|$|E

Assuming nearly straight flight paths, a "filtering " equation model predicts recapture percentages on several trap rings of specified radii, trap numbers, and effective <b>attraction</b> <b>radius</b> (EAR) of a pheromone trap. Equations were used to calculate recapture percentages on concentric trap rings as a function of increasing EAR and gave polynomial relationships for each ring with terms equal to the number of inner rings plus one. Results were confirmed by computer simulations. Filtering equations were iterated with increasing EAR values to find one that gave a recapture percentage for the innermost trap ring that matched the field results. The estimated EAR for a synthetic pheromone bait of /. typographus was similar in five tests (range 1. 39 - 1. 78 m), but in two other tests was larger (3. 27 and 15. 9 m).

Previous simulation studies of blood vessel growth {{based on the}} Cellular Potts model (CPM) proposed that elongated, adhesive or mutually attractive endothelial cells suffice {{for the formation of}} blood vessel sprouts and vascular networks. Because each mathematical representation of a model introduces potential artifacts, it is important that model results are reproduced using alternative modelling paradigms. Here, we present a lattice-free, particle-based simulation of the cell elongation model of vasculogenesis. The new, particle-based simulations confirm the results obtained from the previous Cellular Potts simulations. Furthermore, our current findings suggest that the emergence of order is possible with the application of a high enough attractive force or, alternatively, a longer <b>attraction</b> <b>radius.</b> The methodology will be applicable to a range of problems in morphogenesis and noisy particle aggregation in which cell shape is a key determining factor.

40|$|Optical {{techniques}} for performing two computing tasks are investigated. First, acousto-optical systems that implement adaptive filtering structures are presented for operation in environments {{that are not}} well characterized a priori or are time-varying. Theoretical analyses along with experimental confirmations are given to identify the important system parameters that affect the performance. Extensions of the systems to the multidimensional domain of phased array signal processing are discussed as well as novel implementations that use photorefractive crystals as time-integrating elements. Also investigated are various associative memory models. An acousto-optic implementation of the so-called Hopfield model is presented. The system's storage capacity and <b>attraction</b> <b>radius</b> are characterized experimentally and are shown to agree with computer simulations. Secondly, an upper bound is derived for the storage capacity of holographic associative memories that use planar holograms. It is shown that if the space bandwidth product of the hologram is N 2, then the holographic memory can store at most N 2 /N 3 associations, where N 3 {{is the number of}} pixels in each output item.

40|$|Abstract Methods and {{equations}} {{have not}} been developed previously to estimate insect flight densities, {{a key factor in}} decisions regarding trap and lure deployment in programs of monitoring, mass trapping, and mating disruption with semiochemicals. An equation to estimate densities of flying insects per hectare is presented that uses the standard deviation (SD) of the vertical flight distribution, trapping time, the trap’s spherical effective radius (ER), catch at the mean flight height (as estimated from a best-fitting normal distribution with SD), and an estimated average flight speed. Data from previous reports were used to estimate flight densities with the equations. The same equations can use traps with pheromone lures or attractive colors with a measured effective <b>attraction</b> <b>radius</b> (EAR) instead of the ER. In practice, EAR is more useful than ER for flight density calculations since attractive traps catch higher numbers of insects and thus can measure lower populations more readily. Computer simulations in three dimensions with varying numbers of insects (density) and varying EAR were used to validate the equations for density estimates of insects in the field. Few studies have provided data to obtain EAR, SD, speed, and trapping time to estimate flight densities per hectare. However, the necessary parameters can be measured more precisely in future studies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] The {{catches of}} bark beetles (Coleoptera: Scolytidae) were {{compared}} between attractive traps releasing semiochemicals and passive traps (cylindrical sticky screens hung, at 10 heights of 0. 7 - 11. 5 m, on poles). A central attractive-trap pole {{was surrounded by}} three passive-trap poles spaced 50 or 100 m away at the apices of an equilateral triangle. The catches of Tomicus piniperda and other scolytid species on the attractive-trap pole baited with host monoterpenes, or the catches of Ips typographus attracted to synthetic pheromone, were compared to passive trap catches in a Scots pine forest or in a Norway spruce clear-cut, respectively. Information about flight height distributions of the above scolytid species, and Hylurgops palliatus, Cryphalus abietis, Pityogenes chalcographus, P. quadridens, P. bidentatus, and Trypodendron domesticum were obtained on the passive and attractive trap poles. A new method is presented for determining the densities of flying insects based on the passive trap's dimensions and catch, duration of test, and speed of insect. Also, a novel concept, the effective <b>attraction</b> <b>radius</b> (EAR), is presented for comparing attractants of species, which is independent of insect density, locality, or duration of test. The EAR is obtained by the ratio of attractive and passive trap catches and {{the dimensions of the}} passive trap, and thus should correlate positively with the strength of the attractant and the distance of attraction. EARs are determined from catch data of T. piniperda and L typographus {{as well as from the}} data of previous investigations on the same or other bark beetles...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The release rate of a {{semiochemical}} lure {{that attracts}} flying insects has a specific effective <b>attraction</b> <b>radius</b> (EAR) {{that corresponds to}} the lure’s orientation response strength. EAR {{is defined as the}} radius of a passive sphere that intercepts the same number of insects as a semiochemical-baited trap. It is estimated by calculating the ratio of trap catches in the field in baited and unbaited traps and the interception area of the unbaited trap. EAR serves as a standardized method for comparing the attractive strengths of lures that is independent of population density. In two-dimensional encounter rate models that are used to describe insect mass trapping and mating disruption, a circular EAR (EAR c) describes a key parameter that affects catch or influence by pheromone in the models. However, the spherical EAR, as measured in the field, should be transformed to an EAR c for appropriate predictions in such models. The EARc is calculated as (π/ 2 EAR 2) /FL, where FL is the effective thickness of the flight layer where the insect searches. F L was estimated from catches of insects (42 species in the orders Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera, and Thysanoptera) on traps at various heights as reported in the literature. The EARc was proposed further as a simple but equivalent alternative to simulations of highly complex active-space plumes with variable response surfaces that have proven exceedingly difficult to quantify in nature. This hypothesis was explored in simulations where flying insects, represented as coordinate points, moved about in a correlated random walk in an area that contained a pheromone plume, represented as a sector o...|$|E
40|$|Simulation {{models of}} insects encountering sex {{pheromone}} {{with or without}} mass trapping in which the searching sex is either male (moths and many insect species) or female (some true bugs, beetles, and flies) were developed. The searching sex moved as a correlated random walk, while the opposite sex remained stationary (calling) and released an attractive sex pheromone. The searching sex was caught when encountering a pheromone-baited trap, and females mated when encountering a male. An encounter with pheromone was defined by the searcher’s interception of a circle termed the effective <b>attraction</b> <b>radius</b> (EARc). Parameters of movement (speed and duration), initial numbers of calling sex and searching sex, number of traps, area, and EARc of traps and calling sex were varied individually to evaluate effects on the percentage of females mating. In the natural condition without traps, female mating success in both models was identical. Increasing the EARc of the calling sex caused diminishing increases in female mating success, suggesting that evolution of larger pheromone release and EARc is limited by increasing costs (production/sensitivity) relative to diminishing increases and benefits of mating encounters. With mass trapping, increasing the EARc of traps or density of traps caused similar declines in female mating in both models, but the female-searching model predicted slightly lower mating success than the male-searching model. Increasing the EARc of calling insects or the initial density of insects caused similar increases in female mating in both models, but again the female-searching model had slightly lower mating success than the male searching model. The models have implications for mating lek formation and for understanding the variables affecting the success of mass trapping programs for insect pests with either male or female sex pheromones...|$|E
40|$|The {{first part}} of this {{dissertation}} discusses a new classifier based on a multilayer feed-forward network architecture. The main idea is to map irregularly-distributed prototypes in a classification problem to codewords that are organized in some way. Then the pattern classification problem is transformed into a threshold decoding problem, which is easily solved using simple hard-limiter neurons. At first we propose the new model and introduce two families of good "internal representation" codes. Then some analyses and software simulation concerning the storage capacity of this new model are done. The results show that the new classifier is much better than the classifier based on the Hopfield model in terms of both the storage capacity and the ability to classify correlated prototypes. A general model for neural network associative memories with a feedback. structure is proposed. Many existing neural network associative memories can be expressed as special cases of this general model. Among these models, there is a class of associative memories, called correlation associative memories, that are capable of storing a large number of memory patterns. If the function used in the evolution equation is monotonically nondecreasing, then a correlation associative memory can be proved to be asymptotically stable in both the synchronous and asynchronous updating modes. Of these correlation associative memories, one stands out because of its VLSI implementation feasibility and large storage capacity. This memory uses the exponentiation function in its evolution equation; hence it is called exponential correlation associative memory (ECAM). It is further proved that the storage capacity of ECAM scales exponentially with N (the number of components in memory patterns) when N approaches infinity. A programmable ECAM chip is designed, simulated, fabricated, and then tested. The performance of the ECAM chip is shown to be not much worse than that of a computer-simulated ECAM model in terms of error correcting ability (<b>attraction</b> <b>radius).</b> Finally, the speed of the prototype ECAM chip is demonstrated by employing it to do vector quantization on binary images. And it is found that the ECAM chip can process binary images in real time. </p...|$|E
