500|$|Eurogamer's Kristan Reed was unimpressed {{with the}} game, calling it [...] "a bit half-baked". He praised {{the opening of}} the game, arguing that, like Hansen himself, the player feels a strong sense of {{disorientation}} as they get used to being on the ship {{in the middle of a}} storm. However, he felt the strong opening soon gives way to clichés. He was highly critical of the absence of a map, arguing that because the environments all look similar, getting lost is a regular occurrence. GameSpot's Carrie Gouskos scored the PlayStation 2 version 6.9 out of 10 and the Xbox version 7.2 out of 10. She argued [...] "Atmospherically, Cold Fear is derivative and predictable, which is a shame considering that it is, at times, an enjoyable action game." [...] Although she praised the outdoor scenes on the boat, she felt there were not enough of them, with too many [...] "generic indoor locations." [...] She was also highly critical of the lack of a map and the <b>autosave</b> feature, feeling the save points were unevenly distributed.|$|E
500|$|GameSpy's Will Tuttle {{scored the}} PlayStation 2 version 3 out of 5 and the Xbox version 3.5 out of 5. He praised the setting, {{atmosphere}} and over-the-shoulder camera, but {{was critical of}} the lack of a map. He remarked, [...] "While it's not going to overthrow Resident Evil 4 as King of All Horror Games, Cold Fear is a solid little thriller." [...] Game Revolution's JP Hurh gave the game a B-. He too criticized the length of the game, the lack of a map and the <b>autosave</b> feature, which he found too random. He praised the graphics and sound, but concluded [...] "With so much attention paid to the environments, Darkworks almost made a great game. Unfortunately, it's only half a great game [...] The ending as well as many portions along the way feel rushed." [...] IGN's Ed Lewis scored the PlayStation 2 version 7.2 out of 10 and the Xbox version 7.6 out of 10. He praised the over-the-shoulder camera and the setting, but also criticized the lack of a map.|$|E
500|$|Commenting on the combat, Paprocki {{said that}} despite the {{simplified}} combo system, the developers have [...] "managed to infuse the sheer brutality and force God of War is known for {{within the confines of}} the [...] platform." [...] Because of the simplified system, situations which call for Kratos' magical abilities are rare. [...] However, if players do choose to use these abilities, selecting them is a [...] "burden in the haste of a battle", requiring players to cycle through their entire inventory. Paprocki also criticized the lack of an <b>autosave</b> feature, as the game does not save the player's position when receiving a phone call, which [...] "can lead to unbearable frustration." [...] Freeman said that the combination of the weapons and quick time events make the combat [...] "a convincing interpretation of the action in the original console games". Davis said that although there are puzzle and platforming elements, the focus is [...] "clearly on the combat" [...] and felt that the combat system was [...] "a little shallow". He said it seems as if the abundance of enemies [...] "exist solely to act as punching (or slicing, as it were) bags for Kratos".|$|E
5000|$|A game can {{be saved}} / loaded at any point during gameplay; Driftmoon {{provides}} eight [...] "Save" [...] slots. In addition, the game generates <b>autosaves</b> (for example, upon entering an area).|$|R
50|$|There is {{only one}} savegame slot, and the game {{frequently}} <b>autosaves,</b> by design, if the party moves to another location, or a party member dies. A party, once killed, needs a new party to resurrect them.|$|R
50|$|OmegaT's {{internal}} {{translation memory}} format is not {{visible to the}} user, but every time it <b>autosaves</b> the translation project, all new or updated translation units are automatically exported and added to three external TMX memories: a native OmegaT TMX, a level 1 TMX and a level 2 TMX.|$|R
500|$|Rare Replay is a {{compilation}} of 30 games developed by Rare and its predecessor, Ultimate Play the Game, over their 30-year history across platforms from the ZX Spectrum to the Xbox 360 (1983 to 2008), up until Rare's Kinect Sports series. The 30 games span multiple genres, including fighting, first-person shooter, simulation, 3D platforming, racing, and skiing. The compilation opens with a musical number featuring Rare characters. Each game has a landing page with a variation on its theme music. While the core gameplay remains unedited, Rare added extra features to the older releases. The player can toggle the visual appearance of scanlines and [...] "rewind" [...] up to ten seconds of gameplay in pre-Nintendo 64 games. The older games can be saved at will and <b>autosave</b> progress upon the player's exit. Rare also added an infinite lives cheat setting for some older games and fixed a game-breaking bug in Battletoads. The [...] "Snapshots" [...] feature presents small segments of the older games as challenges for the player, such as collecting a set amount of points in a set {{amount of time in}} a set scenario, similar in function to the NES Remix series. Some Snapshots are connected sequentially as a playlist.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2000, {{after the}} release of the Dreamcast version but prior to the release of the PC version, BioWare {{announced}} two significant changes had been made to the game. The Dreamcast version had been criticized for being too difficult, and so for the PC version, Bioware were adding four difficulty settings ("Easy", [...] "Medium", [...] "Hard" [...] and [...] "Jinkies"), as well as the ability to manually save anywhere (although the <b>autosave</b> checkpoints from the Dreamcast versions would remain in place).|$|E
2500|$|IGN's Steve Butts {{scored the}} PC version 6.5 out of 10, praising the game's {{fidelity}} to the novel and its inclusion of characters such as Tom Bambadil, but criticizing the truncation of the narrative, suggesting players unfamiliar with the book or film {{would not be able}} to follow the plot. However, he did argue [...] "the artists here have done a really excellent job of creating a world that's similar enough to be familiar but distinct enough to stand on its own." [...] GameSpot's Andrew Park scored it 5.7 out of 10, writing [...] "thanks to Fellowship of the Rings limited gameplay, only true Tolkien enthusiasts will enjoy the game for very long." [...] He concluded [...] "the game generally looks and sounds quite good, but unfortunately, it just isn't that much fun to play." [...] GameSpy's Avi Fryman scored it 2 out of 5, and was critical of the gameplay, controls, camera and the lack of an <b>autosave,</b> although he did praise the graphics and voice acting.|$|E
50|$|Some puzzles, if not {{completed}} {{within a short}} span of time (always less than a minute), {{will result in a}} game over. To ensure that the player does not get stuck by saving their game at a point from which they cannot possibly complete a puzzle in time, the game <b>autosaves</b> onto a separate save file {{at the beginning of each}} timed puzzle.|$|R
25|$|A version {{based on}} Nintendo DS remake was {{released}} in Japan on April 17, 2014 for Android and iOS. It {{was released in}}ternationally on August 7, 2014. The Android version of the game features cloud saving, <b>autosaves,</b> a quick save feature, and a pause feature for ease of use on the mobile platform. This version also reintroduces the party talk feature removed from the international Nintendo DS releases, being translated into the appropriate language.|$|R
50|$|Some games suspend saves {{in which}} the game is {{automatically}} saved upon exiting and reloaded upon restarting. The aim of suspend save is to allow the gameplay to be temporarily interrupted; as such, suspend saves are erased when the player resumes the game. Savescumming, the act of capturing or reusing suspend saves, {{is a form of}} cheating. Ironman is a game mode in some games where reloading from <b>autosaves</b> or other saves is disabled, to avoid savescum cheating.|$|R
2500|$|EGMNow {{praised the}} Xbox 360 version and stated it {{features}} impressive visuals, brutal and satisfying combat, fluid animations and advanced enemy AI, numerous entertaining side-missions, and an addictive multiplayer component. The one complaint they had with Rage {{was that the}} final boss fight was unsatisfying compared {{to the rest of}} the game's impressive combat scenarios. GameZone gave the same console version 8.5 out of 10 and called it [...] "a great experience that’s coupled with some intensely fun gunplay and some incredibly impressive graphics. It's not quite the Borderlands meets Fallout experience that gamers were expecting. It isn't very long, and it does skimp out on character development, but it focuses more on what id knows best--shooting things in the face. This is one post-apocalyptic wasteland that you’ll definitely want to venture into." [...] Ars Technica gave a more negative review of the Xbox 360 version, criticizing lack of story, undeveloped characters, uninteresting quests and a [...] "broken save system" [...] (<b>autosave</b> checkpoints being too far apart, forcing frequent manual saves which are slow on the Xbox 360), while acknowledging the quality of the visuals. Edge gave it seven out of ten and called it [...] "a stunningly rendered FPS, but one that seems caught between a desire to innovate and the desire to be true to the template its creators defined." ...|$|E
2500|$|IGN's Douglass C. Perry {{scored the}} PlayStation 2 version 7.5 out of 10, writing [...] "the {{inclusion}} of chapters {{from the book}} skipped over in the movie, and the general variety of missions, spread out over the large landscapes work to its favor." [...] However, he was critical {{of the lack of}} an <b>autosave</b> feature, the implementation of the Ring, which he felt was completely optional, and the combat system, which he called [...] "basic and repetitive." [...] He concluded [...] "what this game has that the EA game doesn't have - chapters, characters and events from the book - is important to a Tolkien fan, and it warrants playtime [...] but without this license, this game is very, very average." [...] GameZone's Michael Knudson scored it 7.4 out of 10 arguing [...] "the game has a lot of potential, but a few gameplay quirks ruin it." [...] He concluded [...] "this game will only suit hardcore fans of the J.R.R. Tolkien series." [...] GameSpot's Brad Shoemaker scored it 5.5 out of 10 calling it [...] "an average adventure game with a high-profile license attached." [...] GameSpy's Bryan Stratton scored it 1.5 out of 5, comparing it unfavorably with the film; [...] "the reason that the movie worked was that Peter Jackson knew what to keep from the book, what to fast-forward through, and what to cut altogether. Fellowship doesn't have the benefit of so capable an editor." [...] Game Informers Andy McNamara scored it 3 out of 10, writing [...] "There are so many things wrong with this one, it's hard to decide. For one, the story is delivered with all the emotion of a grade school play. This wouldn't be such a bad thing, if the gameplay weren't absolutely abysmal." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Autosave</b> {{is common}} in video games. Many video games have an <b>autosave</b> feature that saves {{progress}} during a session. For example, in an adventure game, it may <b>autosave</b> after completing a level or mission, or in fighting games, it might save after winning a match. Such points are called savepoints; sometimes the distinction from a checkpoint is blurred. Some games use <b>autosave</b> as the only method of saving data, and the player must complete a set amount of the game before saving takes place. Still another use of autosaving is as an anti-cheating device; for example in all MegaMan Battle Network games (except the first), the chip trader machines <b>autosave</b> upon giving out a new battle chip so the player can't cheat by soft resetting after each try of the chip trader until the desired chip is received.|$|E
50|$|Both the PC and Xbox {{versions}} of the game are relatively easy to play, with conventional and reconfigurable shooter-style controls. The first mission is an interactive tutorial that guides the player through a typical robbery, set in an Inn. The player may save progress at any point, and must do so manually from time to time, since the game never <b>autosaves.</b> The Xbox version has considerably more tactile controls since it uses a game controller instead of an all purpose keyboard. Within the lock-picking minigame, a rumble effect can be felt based on {{the relation between the}} lock picks and tumblers. Movement of the right analog stick also allows Garrett to turn his head while picking locks, allowing the player to survey their surroundings and pick locks simultaneously. Moving the left analog stick gently makes Garrett creep, and forcefully makes him run.|$|R

50|$|Shaun McInnis of GameSpot spoke well of its {{striking}} atmosphere, tense combat {{that encourages}} resourcefulness, and rewarding skill progression system, but criticizing the nonsensical story and forgettable characters, <b>autosave</b> system, {{and a few}} frustrating boss fights.|$|E
5000|$|Database Applications like FoxPro and SQL Server use [...]bak {{files to}} back up their {{databases}} and other applications, like XML shell, create [...]bak files in their <b>Autosave</b> process.

50|$|The first {{widely known}} web {{application}} written in Objective-J/Cappuccino was 280 Slides, an online presentation preparation system. 280 Slides features {{the ability to}} import existing documents, an <b>autosave</b> recovery, is able to save documents as Microsoft PowerPoint, PDF, and OpenDocument formats, and has {{a wide range of}} themes.|$|E
50|$|This was {{the first}} Colin McRae game {{released}} for the Xbox, {{as well as the}} PlayStation 2. A GameCube version was announced but it was cancelled. It uses an <b>autosave</b> feature. IGN ranked it as the 91st best PlayStation 2 game. The staff praised its improvement and technology.|$|E
5000|$|Teampage Spring 2013 release: Unified {{search for}} quick lookup of people, spaces, tasks, {{projects}} and milestones; [...] "finish later" [...] and <b>autosave</b> support for articles, tasks, projects, milestones and comments; updated IOS 6 iPad and iPhone support; streamlined header design and navigation; Cloud pricing options, first month free; developer updates.|$|E
5000|$|Game {{progress}} is marked with an <b>autosave</b> feature allowing the player {{to resume the}} game from any [...] "chapter", or review any of the previously-seen cutscenes. In a few points of the game, the player is faced with a dilemma, which will affect the difficulty in the final battle of the game.|$|E
5000|$|Mac OS 10.7 Lion {{added an}} <b>autosave</b> feature that is {{available}} to some applications, and {{works in conjunction with}} Time Machine-like functionality to periodically save all versions of a document. This eliminates the need for any manual saving, as well as providing versioning support through the same system. A version is saved every five minutes, during any extended periods of idle time, or when the user uses [...] "Save a version," [...] which replaces the former [...] "Save" [...] menu item and takes its Command-S shortcut. Saves are made on snapshots of the document date and occur in a separate thread, so the user is never paused during this process. Applications need to be updated {{to take advantage of this}} functionality, and a number of Apple's built-in programs were updated with the release. <b>Autosave</b> cannot be disabled in Lion.|$|E
50|$|<b>Autosave</b> is a {{function}} in many computer applications and video games which automatically saves the current changes or progress, helping {{to reduce the risk}} or impact of data loss in case of a crash, freeze or user error. Autosaving is typically done either in predetermined intervals or before a complex editing task is begun.|$|E
50|$|Office Online {{can open}} and edit documents, {{spreadsheets}} and presentations in Office Open XML formats on the web. Starting on July 2013, they can render PDF documents or {{convert them to}} Microsoft Word documents, although the formatting of the document may deviate from the original. Since November 2013, the apps have supported real-time co-authoring and <b>autosave</b> Word files.|$|E
50|$|Gmail also {{features}} <b>Autosave</b> — {{a system for}} avoiding loss of data {{in case of a}} browser crash or other error. During the composition of an e-mail, Gmail automatically saves a draft copy of the message and of any attachments. Although messages begin to be saved once a minute, saving times vary {{depending on the size of}} the message. Draft messages that are discarded are not recoverable.|$|E
50|$|Many {{operating}} systems, file managers, {{and other}} software provide a facility where a file is not immediately deleted when the user requests that action. Instead, the file is {{moved to a}} holding area, making it easy for the user to undo a mistake. Similarly, many software products automatically create backup copies of files that are being edited, to allow the user to restore the original version, or to recover from a possible crash (<b>autosave</b> feature).|$|E
5000|$|GameSpot's Carolyn Petit scored {{both the}} PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 {{versions}} 6 out of 10. Although she praised the graphics, she {{was critical of}} the collision detection, the <b>autosave</b> feature, enemy AI and technical issues with multiplayer. She concluded [...] "there are times when War in the North shows you the game {{it could have been}} ... But each time the game starts to hit its stride, it soon stumbles and falls on its face." ...|$|E
5000|$|The 2012 iOS version adds {{several new}} {{features}} to the game, {{such as an}} optional help feature (which highlights interactive zones on each screen), a [...] "quick inventory" [...] (which allows the player to hold one item and access it without having to enter the inventory screen), an <b>autosave</b> feature, and a [...] "Compass Look" [...] feature (which utilises the gyroscopic-based iDevice accelerometer controls to mimic looking around in the 360 degree environment).|$|E
