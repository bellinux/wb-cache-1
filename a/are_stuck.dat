He, Maggie, and Jimmy (James Allen McCune) bring Rick to a forest swamp where two walkers <b>are</b> <b>stuck.</b> Hershel insists that if Rick's group is to stay on his farm, they must treat the walkers as people, and shows Rick how to snare and lead the walkers back.|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} A.subrubescens are usually solitary, but {{sometimes}} several (typically {{between two and}} eight) <b>are</b> <b>stuck</b> together by the stem bases or {{on the sides of}} their caps. A strictly terrestrial species, it is not found fruiting on wood. It prefers to grow in pine woods, but has occasionally been associated with silver fir in Europe; fruit bodies associated with the latter tree species tend to be less robust than those found growing with pine. It is suspected that A.subrubescens may be mycorrhizal with two- and three-needle pines (i.e., those species that have their needles attached in bundles of two or three), although its ecological preferences are not known with certainty. Ginns, relating a personal communication with David Arora, wrote that Arora encountered several clumps of fruit bodies in an area in California containing mostly knobcone pine (a three-needle pine), manzanita, huckleberry and a few mandrones.|$|E

5|$|Initially, {{the crew}} {{are unaware of}} the loop. However, Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) begins to hear noises before she goes to bed {{following}} the poker game. Having a sense of déjà vu during the poker game and able to predict the cards Data will deal during a subsequent loop, Crusher takes a tricorder with her to her room, records the voices, and later analyzes them to discover they are the panicked commands and broadcasts of the crew. The senior staff work out that they <b>are</b> <b>stuck</b> in the loop; the voices they are hearing are those of themselves from the previous loop {{just prior to the}} destruction of the ship. They evaluate the voices to determine that the loop is restarted due to the collision of the two ships but {{do not know how to}} avoid that collision in the first place. Data suggests that his positronic brain can be used to send a short message to himself in the next loop which may help them to avoid the collision. When they arrive at the anomaly, and after the collision, Data sends the message.|$|E
5|$|On the {{following}} loop, Crusher again has {{a feeling of}} déjà vu during the poker game, but when Data deals the next hand, all the cards are threes, followed by a hand where all players have three of a kind. The number 3 begins appearing throughout {{other parts of the}} ship's operations while, again, they determine they <b>are</b> <b>stuck</b> in a time loop. When they reach the anomaly and the ship appears from it, Data suddenly realizes that the 3 stands for the number of command pips on Riker's uniform, and executes Riker's option instead of his own. This allows Enterprise to safely clear the oncoming ship. The anomaly disappears and the time loop ends, and the crew realize they have been trapped in the loop for over 17 days, while the other ship, the USS Bozeman, has been missing for over 90 years. Picard welcomes the Bozemans crew to the 24th century.|$|E

Her sister, coming to help her, <b>is</b> <b>stuck</b> fast too. And the youngest (Least of Three), determined not to be left out of the riches, <b>is</b> <b>stuck</b> to the second. Dummling makes his way to the castle, and each person who attempts to interfere is joined to the unwilling parade: the parson, his sexton, and two laborers.|$|R

25|$|Another {{interesting}} {{property is}} that even if u has a discontinuity at an initial time t=t0, the temperature becomes smooth as soon as t>t0. For example, if a bar of metal has temperature 0 and another has temperature 100 and they <b>are</b> <b>stuck</b> together end to end, then very quickly the temperature {{at the point of}} connection will become 50 and the graph of the temperature will run smoothly from 0 to 50.|$|E

However, murders, rapes, and riots happen as the 21st-century people try to mix with the locals. Kolhammer is flown to California to meet President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Albert Einstein. As time goes by with no sight of the JRV Nagoya, more and more 21st-century personnel start to realize they <b>are</b> <b>stuck</b> in 1942.|$|E

They rescue Kal-El from the ship before the government arrives. The Kents slip past them by presenting the baby as their own and offering instead the body of a deformed calf as the alien occupant. Ultimately, Superman meets and battles the Collector of Worlds, saving the Earth and receiving the public's trust as the world's first Super-Hero.|$|E
25|$|The North West Tower (Arundel Tower) {{contains}} the cathedral's clock chime.

Desperate to make the trip, Brit and Candy, after getting high on cocaine, don ski masks and use hammers and realistic-looking squirt guns to rob a local restaurant. They are assisted by Cotty, who drives (and later burns) the getaway car stolen from one of their professors.|$|E
25|$|In Canada, inequalities {{of access}} to social and {{economic}} resources contribute significantly to poverty levels across Canada, i.e., those in poverty are often First Nation people, immigrants and refugees, single adults {{between the ages of}} 45-64, and single mothers with children, disabled, those in the lowest-paying jobs, full or part-time. People in poverty in Canada more often access food banks, are often homeless, or in low-cost, sub-standard housing; {{they are part of the}} 'working poor' who rely on low wages, or <b>are</b> <b>stuck</b> in the poverty trap of welfare, and face hunger.|$|E
25|$|The Social Suicide Bomber (Raskopoulos) is an awkward-looking {{man in a}} {{burgundy}} {{blazer and}} salmon-pink shirt who is summoned by people who <b>are</b> <b>stuck</b> in unpleasant social situations - such as an unattractive man flirting {{with a woman who}} doesn't want that kind of attention - by pressing a large red button. He drives away the unwanted person with banal comments or bizarre actions, like demonstrating his pterodactyl impersonation. Unfortunately, with that person gone, the Social Suicide Bomber then often turns his sights to the person who called him, creating a situation that was more awkward than the one to begin with.|$|E

25|$|Baby mice, called pinkies or pups, {{are born}} blind, naked, and deaf. Their {{eyes are closed}} and their ears <b>are</b> <b>stuck</b> {{to the sides of}} their heads.

Eyes open at 14 days, and the babies will start {{exploring}} the world around them. At three weeks old they look like miniature versions of adult mice. At four weeks the males in the litter should be separated out so as to not cause the mother and sisters to become pregnant, while the females can be left in with the mother.|$|E
25|$|Silk fibers {{from the}} Bombyx mori {{silkworm}} have a triangular cross section with rounded corners, 5–10 μm wide. The fibroin-heavy chain is composed mostly of beta-sheets, {{due to a}} 59-mer amino acid repeat sequence with some variations. The flat surfaces of the fibrils reflect light at many angles, giving silk a natural sheen. The cross-section from other silkworms can vary in shape and diameter: crescent-like for Anaphe and elongated wedge for tussah. Silkworm fibers are naturally extruded from two silkworm glands {{as a pair of}} primary filaments (brin), which <b>are</b> <b>stuck</b> together, with sericin proteins that act like glue, to form a bave. Bave diameters for tussah silk can reach 65 μm. See cited reference for cross-sectional SEM photographs.|$|E
25|$|Ceramic {{is on the}} {{one hand}} a very solid material; on the other hand, it breaks even at {{relatively}} low mechanical stress. MLCC chips as surface-mounted components are susceptible to flexing stresses since they are mounted directly on the substrate. They <b>are</b> <b>stuck</b> between soldered joints on the printed circuit board (PCB), and are often exposed to mechanical stresses, for example, if vibration or a bump impacts the circuit board. They are also more sensitive to thermal stresses than leaded components. Excess solder fillet height can multiply these stresses and cause chip cracking. Of all influencing factors, causing a mechanical shock stress to the PCB proved to be the most critical one. The reason is that forces induced by those kinds of stresses are more or less transmitted undampened to the components via the PCB and solder joints.|$|E
