40|$|The {{status of}} a study for a European Spallation Source (ESS) is {{reported}} along {{with a description of}} the reference design. The design of the 5 MW, 1. 334 GeV machine is dominated by the need to keep beam loss at a low enough level to allow hands on maintenance for most areas. All accelerator sections are designed to be far away from space charge limits. The design allows scraping of the H- Linac beam in all three phase planes (horizontal, vertical and momentum) prior to injection into the two <b>accumulators.</b> Key <b>elements</b> of the R & D programme that will validate the design are identified. 1 ESS DESIGN STUDY STATUS The first phase of the ESS Project was completed at the end of 1996, with the conclusion of the Feasibility Study and publication of the Reference Design [1].

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{contribution}} is to describe some phenomena arising in hydraulic systems. By a hydraulic system we call a network of tubes, pumps, valves, <b>accumulators</b> and other <b>elements</b> designed to fulfil certain function, for example pumping water from one tank to another. To quantify the fluid flow through the system in question we use fundamental physical principles, namely conservation of mass, momentum and energy. In pipes it leads to Navier-Stokes equations simplified {{with regard to the}} special properties of the flow. For description of the fluid flow through other hydraulic elements different models are used which must be identified by the help of experiments performed on an appropriately designed test ring...|$|R

40|$|A dynamic {{accumulator}} is an algorithm, which gathers {{together a}} large set of elements into a constant-size value such {{that for a}} given element accumulated, there is a witness confirming that the element was indeed included into the value, with a property that accumulated elements can be dynamically added and deleted into/from the original set such {{that the cost of}} an addition or deletion operation is independent of the number of accumulated elements. Although the first accumulator was presented ten years ago, there is still no standard formal definition of accumulators. In this paper, we generalize formal definitions for accumulators, formulate a security game for dynamic <b>accumulators</b> so-called Chosen <b>Element</b> Attack (CEA), and propose a new dynamic accumulator for batch updates based on the Paillier cryptosystem.

40|$|Choosing native {{vascular}} {{plants as}} nutrient and toxic <b>element</b> <b>accumulators</b> for passive biomonitoring of urban river quality {{is not an}} easy task in Mediterranean rivers, due to the particular climate determining high variations in river hydrology. To identify potential biomonitors for this area, the roots of seven species (Angelica sylvestris, Apium nodiflorum, Tradescantia fluminensis, Nasturtium officinale, Persicaria lapathifolia, Arctium lappa, Typha latifolia), growing in seven sites along the River Irno (Southern Italy), were collected in July 2010 and analyzed regarding their capability to accumulate Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Pb, V, and Zn through atomic absorption spectrometry. Notwithstanding the expected different accumulation degree among the species, they highlighted similar spatial contamination gradients, and all of them appeared suitable, alone or in combination, for river passive biomonitoring. A. nodiflorum, in particular, appeared the best biomonitor for the River Irno, where severe anthropogenic impacts were detected: high Cu and Cd contamination from vine cultivation in the upper stretch, and Pb, Zn, and Mn contamination in the medium stretch from airborne dusts coming from a cast iron foundry...|$|R

40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia do Ambiente - Tecnologias Ambientais - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaPanasqueira mine {{is one of}} {{the last}} three mines {{actually}} in labour. Tungsten, copper and tin are explored for over a century. The visual and chemical impact of the exploration is due to active and old huge tailings and due to draining from mine, water plant treatment and seepage water. The objective of this study was to evaluate the biogeochemical impact of the mine activity in soil, water and strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo L.). Soil is contaminated with copper, zinc, arsenic, tungsten and lead and the consequent impact was observed in microbial soil enzymes. Selective chemical extraction of trace elements allows to assess elements in soils and their absorption in plant roots and translocation to branches, leaves and fruits. Arbutus unedo is a manganese and zinc tolerant, and is not <b>accumulator</b> of trace <b>elements.</b> However, this species presented high concentration of cadmium in the aerial parts. The analysis of sediments and water from Ribeira of Bodelhão indicate that trace elements are dispersed from the primary contaminated area, to Zêzere River, where the dilution drastically eliminates the contamination effects. The strawberry tree fruits can be used to produce alcohol as they are not contaminated. A. unedo can be used in phytostabilisation programs of contaminated soils and tailings...|$|R
40|$|Eight {{species of}} desert {{vegetation}} and associated soils {{were collected from}} the Nevada National Security Site (N 2 S 2) and analyzed for 238 Pu and 239 + 240 Pu concentrations. Amongst the plant species sampled were: atmospheric elemental accumulators (moss and lichen), the very slow growing, long-lived creosote bush and the rapidly growing, short-lived cheatgrass brome. The diversity of growth strategies provided insight into the geochemical behavior and bio-availability of Pu at the N 2 S 2. The highest concentrations of Pu were measured in the onion moss (24. 27 Bq kg- 1 238 Pu and 52. 78 Bq kg- 1 239 + 240 Pu) followed by the rimmed navel lichen (8. 18 Bq kg- 1 and 18. 4 Bq kg- 1 respectively), pointing {{to the importance of}} eolian transport of Pu. Brome and desert globemallow accumulated between 3 and 9 times higher concentrations of Pu than creosote and sage brush species. These results support the importance of species specific elemental accumulation strategies rather than exposure duration as the dominant variable influencing Pu concentrations in these plants. Total vegetation elemental concentrations of Ce, Fe, Al, Sm and others were also analyzed. Strong correlations were observed between Fe and Pu. This supports the conclusion that Pu was accumulated {{as a consequence of the}} active accumulation of Fe and other plant required nutrients. Cerium and Pu are considered to be chemical analogs. Strong correlations observed in plants support the conclusion that these elements displayed similar geochemical behavior in the environment as it related to the biochemical uptake process of vegetation. Soils were also sampled in association with vegetation samples. This allowed for the calculation of a concentration ratio (CR). The CR values for Pu in plants were highly influenced by the heterogeneity of Pu distribution among sites. Results from the naturally occurring elements of concern were more evenly distributed between sample sites. This allowed for the development of a pattern of plant species that accumulated Ce, Sm, Fe and Al. The highest <b>accumulators</b> of these <b>elements</b> were onion moss, lichen flowed by brome. The lowest accumulators were creosote bush and fourwing saltbush. This ranked order corresponds to plant accumulations of Pu...|$|R
40|$|Moss Isopterygium albescens {{was used}} to {{determine}} heavy metals concentration in different altitude at Lawa Mandau Hill. The objectives of this study were to determine heavy metal (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni and Pb) pollution in Lawa Mandau Hill by using Isopterygium albescens as bioindicator, to compare the accumulation of heavy metal concentration in different altitude of Lawa Mandau Hill and to analyses the function of local climate conditions on the altitude distribution of heavy metal at Lawa Mandau Hill. There are three replicates of the moss samples taken from each sampling stations and each replicates were duplicated. Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES) {{was used to}} determine the accumulated concentration of each element As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni and Pb. The result from the ICPOES shows that station 5 and station 6 has the highest heavy metals contain in every station, whilst station 2 has the lowest amount. The accumulation concentration for element As is high in station 6, followed by station 1, station 5, station 7, station 3, station 2 and the lowest arsenic concentration is in station 4 with the accumulation mean and standard deviation 20. 12 ± 0. 0032 pg/g, 17. 26 ± 0. 0031 pg/g, 17. 22 ± 0. 0038 pg/g, 16. 75 ± 0. 0029 pg/g, 15. 59 ± 0. 0038 pg/g, 14. 10 ± 0. 0039 pg/g and 13. 68 ± 0. 0041 pg/g respectively.

For element Ni, the high accumulation concentration of heavy metal is in station 5 followed by station 6, station 1, station 3, station 7, station 4 and last is station 2 with the accumulation mean and standard deviation 45. 33 ± 0. 0197 pg/g, 36. 19 ± 0. 0167 pg/g, 22. 49 ± 0. 0059 pg/g, 17. 84 ± 0. 0037 pg/g, 17. 01 ± 0. 0043 pg/g, 16. 85 ± 0. 0007 pg/g and 13. 69 ± 0. 0019 pg/g respectively. Accumulation concentration of heavy metal for element Pb is high in station 6 followed by station 4, station 5, station 7, station 3, station 2 and last is station 1 with the accumulation mean and standard deviation 78. 50 ± 0. 0687 pg/g, 10. 43 ± 0. 0021 pg/g, 6. 81 ± 0. 0023 pg/g, 6. 33 ± 0. 0023 pg/g, 5. 70 ± 0. 0023 pg/g, 5. 13 ± 0. 0020 pg/g and 4. 77 ± 0. 0016 pg/g respectively. But for element Cd, ICP-OES cannot detect the element for the whole station in this study. The local climate does affect the amount of the deposition of heavy metals in Lawa Mandau as it was related to the long range pollution transport as the source of heavy metals from biomass burning and anthropogenic was swept by the wind factors, deposited at the east side of Lawa Mandau where orographic precipitation occur and accumulated by the moss over the years. As a conclusion, I albescens is a good bioindicator and <b>accumulator</b> for <b>element</b> As, Cr, Cu, Ni and Pb but not for Cd and the local climate or the meteorological distribution around Lawa Mandau Hill does affecting the accumulation of heavy metals in the study area...|$|R
