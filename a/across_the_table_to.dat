25|$|Intention to touch: A nonverbal {{communication}} haptic code or cue is {{the intention}} behind it. Reaching your hand <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>to</b> a somewhat unknown person {{is used as}} a way to show readiness to touch.|$|E
500|$|Peggy meets Ted Chaough from Cutler Gleason and Chaough {{to discuss}} job {{opportunities}} and he praises her work. She writes her job requirements, [...] "Copy Chief $18,000/year", {{on a piece}} of paper and slides it <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>to</b> him. Chaough crosses out $18,000 and writes $19,000.|$|E
500|$|War for Cybertron {{developer}} High Moon Studios {{and publisher}} Activision {{worked closely with}} Hasbro to create the design and story for the game. [...] "I {{want to make the}} game I've been waiting 25 years to play" [...] said Tieger. [...] The studio brought the concept and idea to Hasbro for approval. It began with a sketch of Bumblebee. [...] "That was that first sketch that we slid <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>to</b> Hasbro and said 'What do you guys think?' [...] And that's where it all started" [...] said Tieger. High Moon presented the idea of setting the game on Cybertron during the Transformers' civil war between the Autobots and Decepticons. [...] Aaron Archer, Senior Design Director for Hasbro, stated of the Cybertron-based setting [...] "that's a really cool place [...] and the early days of that civil war between the Autobots and Decepticons was a story that hadn't really been fleshed out in any format." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Some," [...] {{the daring}} {{bachelor}} said, [...] "think {{it ought to}} be made impossible." [...] <b>The</b> girl <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> began <b>to</b> laugh hysterically, but caught herself up and tried to look as if she had not laughed at all.|$|R
60|$|She moved {{a little}} uneasily in her chair. It {{might have been}} his fancy, but he {{imagined}} that she glanced under her eyelids toward the Prince of Seyre. The prince, however, had turned almost ostentatiously away from her. He was leaning <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> talking <b>to</b> Faraday.|$|R
6000|$|Miss Maria {{dropped a}} handful of pods into the pan, and sent {{a handful of}} peas {{rattling}} <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> on <b>to</b> <b>the</b> floor. [...] "Well, who in Time"--the expression was strong, but she used it without hesitation, and was never known to repent it [...] "will she go to, then?" ...|$|R
60|$|He lit a {{cigarette}} and passed the box <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>to</b> her.|$|E
60|$|Phipps scowled <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>to</b> where Wingate's {{head was}} nearly {{touching}} Josephine's.|$|E
60|$|She made {{a motion}} {{as if to}} toss the letter <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>to</b> Nevada.|$|E
30|$|In principle, a SPLIT {{encrypted}} database {{can handle}} updates, insertions, and deletions {{to the original}} database. All these operations require updating of all <b>the</b> ciphertext <b>tables</b> corresponding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plaintext <b>table</b> being updated. However, if these operations are done one row at a time, then they allow the adversary to correlate <b>the</b> corresponding rows <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>tables.</b> <b>To</b> prevent this correlation leakage, we resort to batch updates. That is, all pending updates are kept at the security agent (SA) until a full batch is accumulated. Then this batch update is applied at one go by making random passes over the set of updates in the batch for each encrypted table. Batch updates are common in databases designed for analytical workloads, since they are populated periodically using ETL scripts.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, by Jove, I have!" [...] Harold answered, {{laying down}} the Times, and looking <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> with {{interest}} <b>to</b> his brother; [...] "which one was yours?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'For sure we can't {{remake the}} world.' De Forest {{glanced at the}} map flowing {{smoothly}} <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> from west <b>to</b> east. 'We ought to be over our ground by nine to-night. There won't be much sleep afterwards.' ...|$|R
60|$|He {{took out}} his pocket-book, looked through its contents, and passed it <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>to</b> her.|$|E
60|$|He {{pushed the}} open book <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>to</b> me, {{and pointed to}} a passage, marked by pencil lines.|$|E
60|$|Jovial Mr. Vimpany {{pushed the}} bottle <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>to</b> his guest, {{and held out}} a handful of big black cigars.|$|E
60|$|There {{was much}} {{laughter}} and clapping of glasses upon <b>the</b> <b>table</b> at <b>the</b> conclusion of old Buckhorse's story, and I saw the Prince of Wales hand {{something to the}} waiter, who brought it round and slipped it into the skinny hand of the veteran, who spat upon it before thrusting it into his pocket. <b>The</b> <b>table</b> had in <b>the</b> meanwhile been cleared, and was now studded with bottles and glasses, while long clay pipes and tobacco-boxes were handed round. My uncle never smoked, thinking that the habit might darken his teeth, {{but many of the}} Corinthians, and the Prince amongst the first of them, set the example of lighting up. All restraint had been done away with, and the prize-fighters, flushed with wine, roared <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> <b>to</b> each other, or shouted their greetings to friends {{at the other end of}} the room. The amateurs, falling into the humour of their company, were hardly less noisy, and loudly debated the merits of the different men, criticizing their styles of fighting before their faces, and making bets upon the results of future matches.|$|R
50|$|She {{held the}} water glass flat against her face. Then {{she used a}} napkin to wipe the dew away. The {{waitress}} brought their drinks. The iced coffee was in a tall glass, and she spilled some of it {{as she put it}} down. Reachers was in an insulated plastic carafe, and she shoved an empty china mug <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> next <b>to</b> it. She left the check face down halfway between the two drinks, and walked away without saying anything at all.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{man came}} to see father. He drove from Wells. He looked like a Frenchman, but he gave no name. He was in the library for an hour. When he left he walked {{straight}} {{out of the house and}} drove away again. I went into the library, and--you know how strong father is--he was crouching forward <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> muttering <b>to</b> himself. It was like some sort of a fit. He did not know me when I spoke to him. Lord Chelsford, what does it all mean?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'T'otherest!' he said, hoarsely, as he bent <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>to</b> {{touch his}} arm. 'The news {{has gone down}} the river afore you.' ...|$|E
60|$|He rapidly {{sorted out}} some notes, and pushed them <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>to</b> Tuppence, then stood up, {{obviously}} impatient {{for her to}} go.|$|E
6000|$|I {{tossed the}} cheque <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>to</b> him. [...] "Do {{you believe in}} THAT part of her ladyship's letter?" [...] I said, indignantly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{just as you}} say, Squire," [...] Mrs. Reverdy snickered, and she {{submitted}} to pull up the chair which Mrs. Braile's glance had suggested. [...] "It beats all what a excitement there is in this town about the goun's on at the camp-meetun', last night. If I've heard it from one I've heard it from a dozen. I s'pose Abel's tol' you?"--she addressed herself impartially <b>to</b> Mrs. Braile <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Squire tilted against the wall in his chair, smoking behind his wife.|$|R
60|$|It {{may be that}} my even accents stung her; {{perhaps she}} read in them some measure of reproof of the ingratitude that lay in her altered bearing towards me. Her eyes met mine <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> and seemed <b>to</b> harden as she looked. Her answer came in a vastly altered tone.|$|R
50|$|The serve {{must always}} {{be made to the}} person {{standing}} diagonally <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and needs <b>to</b> hit both sides of <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> If it doesn’t, the opposing team has the choice to accept the serve or to call out “One Side” or “No Sides” and give the ball back to the serving team.|$|R
60|$|She leaned <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>to</b> {{interrupt}} him, and {{he observed}} that her breathing had grown labored, that her eyes were dilating in alarm.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Lambert," [...] said Lord Ballindine, <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>to</b> the stingy gentleman {{with the}} squint, [...] "are {{you going to}} ride hard to-day?" ...|$|E
60|$|The man moved away, and I {{saw him in}} {{a corner}} talking to Louis. Lamartine served the grouse, and leaned <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>to</b> me.|$|E
6000|$|The {{third man}} drank his {{cocktail}} and spoke no word. He was the strategist, but unfortunately {{his knowledge of}} life was limited. He picked a letter from his breast-pocket and threw it <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> That epistle <b>to</b> <b>the</b> heathen contained some very concise directions from the First Three in New York. It said - ...|$|R
6000|$|The tone {{in which}} this was said admitting of nothing more, Mr Chick relapsed into low spirits and silence. Not so Miss Tox, who, having listened to Mr Dombey with even a more {{emphatic}} attention than usual, and with a more expressive tendency of {{her head to one}} side, now leant <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> and said <b>to</b> Mrs Chick softly: ...|$|R
6000|$|Suddenly {{rising from}} his chair, Mr. Bashwood {{stretched}} <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> and tried <b>to</b> take the papers from his son. [...] "I {{want to look}} at them," [...] he burst out, eagerly. [...] "I want to see what they say about the captain from Cuba. He was at the bottom of it, Jemmy--I'll swear he was at the bottom of it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] cried Smithers, leaning <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>to</b> secure it. [...] "Good old Lewisham!... Now we have it. This {{is better}} than the tambourine." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{two were}} soon {{seated at a}} corner table in the hotel dining room. Ives chucked one of his pennies <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>to</b> Forster.|$|E
6000|$|He {{pushed a}} pencil and some sheets of writing-paper <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>to</b> me. I wrote my reply: [...] "The place makes me sorry for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Even at this moment, {{when the}} Siberian millionaire's neck {{literally}} and metaphorically {{hung in the}} balance, an expectant titter went round the fair spectators as Sir Arthur stretched out his long loose limbs and lounged <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> He waited <b>to</b> make his effect--Sir Arthur is a born actor--and {{there is no doubt}} that he made it, when in his slowest, most drawly tones he said quietly; ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't {{answer your}} letter. What was the use--there wasn't {{anything}} to answer. I {{wanted to see}} you instead." [...] She held out both her hands, and Jon grasped them <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> He tried <b>to</b> say something, but all his attention was given to trying not to hurt her hands. His own felt so hard and hers so soft. She said almost defiantly: ...|$|R
50|$|Hewlett Packard and Tektronix {{produced}} small, desktop-sized flatbed plotters in {{the late}} 1960s and 1970s. The pens were mounted on a traveling bar, whereby the y-axis was represented by motion {{up and down the}} length of the bar and the x-axis was represented by motion of the bar back and forth <b>across</b> <b>the</b> plotting <b>table.</b> Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mass of the bar, these plotters operated relatively slowly.|$|R
