40|$|Background: Asymmetric <b>alpha-carotene,</b> a {{provitamin}} A carotenoid, is cleaved {{to produce}} retinol (vitamin A) and alpha-retinol (with negligible vitamin A activity). The vitamin A activity of alpha-carotene-containing foods is likely overestimated because traditional analytic methods do not separate alpha-retinol derivatives from active retinol. Objective: This study aimed to accurately characterize intestinal <b>alpha-carotene</b> cleavage and its relative contribution to postprandial vitamin A in humans after consumption of raw carrots. Design: Healthy adults (n = 12) consumed a meal containing 300 g raw carrot (providing 27. 3 mg beta-carotene and 18. 7 mg <b>alpha-carotene).</b> Triglyceride-rich lipoprotein fractions of plasma were isolated and extracted, and alpha-retinyl palmitate (alpha RP) and retinyl palmitate were measured over 12 h postprandially via high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The complete profile of all alpha-retinyl esters and retinyl esters was measured at 6 h, and total absorption of alpha- and beta-carotene was calculated. Results: alpha RP was identified and quantified in every subject. No difference in preference for absorption of beta- over <b>alpha-carotene</b> was observed (adjusting for dose, 28 % higher, P = 0. 103). After absorption, beta-carotene trended toward preferential cleavage compared with <b>alpha-carotene</b> (22 % higher, P = 0. 084). A large range of provitamin A carotenoid conversion efficiencies was observed, with <b>alpha-carotene</b> contributing 12 - 35 % of newly converted vitamin A (predicted contribution = 25. 5 %). In all subjects, {{a majority of}} alpha-retinol was esterified to palmitic acid (as compared with other fatty acids). Conclusions: alpha-Retinol is esterified in the enterocyte and transported in the blood analogous to retinol. The percentage of absorption of <b>alpha-carotene</b> from raw carrots was {{not significantly different from}} beta-carotene when adjusting for dose, although a trend toward higher cleavage of beta-carotene was observed. The results demonstrate large interindividual variability in <b>alpha-carotene</b> conversion.

A nonisothermal kinetics analysis of the 1 st-order reaction (micronutrient degradation) induced by deep-fat frying, particularly in terms of the spatial distribution of temperature, was proposed. The kinetic parameters (pre-exponential factor k(0), activation energy E-a) were identified by nonlinear optimization, minimizing the residual variance between the experimental and theoreticalmicronutrient content. Agreement between model and experimental values was checked. During 1 st and 2 nd frying, potassium was well retained while carotenoid contents decreased significantly.

40|$|Objective: The aim in {{this study}} was to assess the {{association}} between individual plasma carotenoid levels (<b>alpha-carotene,</b> beta-carotene, lycopene, beta-cryptoxanthin, lutein, zeaxanthin) and fruit and vegetable intakes recorded by a calibrated food questionnaire (FQ) and 24 - h dietary recall records (24 HDR) in nine different European countries with diverse populations and widely varying intakes of plant foods. Design: A stratified random subsample of 3089 men and women from nine countries participating in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC), who had provided blood samples and dietary and other lifestyle information between 1992 and 2000, were included. Results: beta-Cryptoxanthin was most strongly correlated with total fruits (FQ r = 0. 52, 24 HDR r = 0. 39), lycopene with tomato and tomato products (FQ r = 0. 38, 24 HDR r = 0. 25), and <b>alpha-carotene</b> with intake of root vegetables (r = 0. 39) and of total carrots (r = 0. 38) for FQ only. Based on diet measured by FQ and adjusting for possible confounding by body mass index (BMI), age, gender, smoking status, alcohol intake, and energy intake, the strongest predictors of individual plasma carotenoid levels were fruits (R-partial(2) = 17. 2 %) for beta-cryptoxanthin, total carrots (R-partial(2) = 13. 4 %) and root vegetables (R-partial(2) = 13. 3 %) for <b>alpha-carotene,</b> and tomato products (R-partial(2) = 13. 8 %) for lycopene. For 24 HDR, the highest R-partial(2) was for fruits in relation to beta-cryptoxanthin (7. 9 %). Conclusions: Intakes of specific fruits and vegetables as measured by food questionnaires are good predictors of certain individual plasma carotenoid levels in our multicentre European study.

Methods and results: Data from 37, 846 participants of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Netherlands study were analyzed. Dietary intakes of beta-carotene, <b>alpha-carotene,</b> beta-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, lutein & zeaxanthin and the sum of these carotenoids were assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Incident type 2 diabetes was mainly self-reported, and verified against general practitioner information. Mean +/- SD total carotenoid intake was 10 + 4 mg/day. During a mean +SD follow-up of 10 + 2 years, 915 incident cases of type 2 diabetes were ascertained. After adjustment for age, sex, diabetes risk factors, dietary intake, waist circumference and BMI, higher beta-carotene intakes associated inversely with diabetes risk [Hazard Ratio quartile 4 versus quartile 1 (HRQ 4) : 0. 78 (95 %CI: 0. 64, 0. 95), P-linear trend 0. 01].

40|$|BACKGROUND: Biochemical {{measurement}} of fat-soluble vitamins would allow direct assessment in epidemiological studies of {{their association with}} disease. However, the perceived instability of these compounds and typically high cost of collection and analysis may make their measurement impractical, particularly in large-scale studies. Using a high performance liquid chromatography assay developed in-house, we have investigated the separate effects of temperature and light on the stability of vitamins in whole blood over several days. METHODS: Multiple blood samples from 10 volunteers were stored at 20 degrees C or 4 degrees C and in dark or light conditions. Immediately after collection and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 days later, samples stored under each condition were centrifuged, and the plasma was aliquoted and stored at - 80 degrees C. Subsequently, all aliquots from each individual were analysed in one analytical run. RESULTS: In whole blood stored under {{any of the four}} conditions for up to 7 days, concentrations of <b>alpha-carotene,</b> beta-carotene, lutein, lycopene, retinol, and alpha-tocopherol changed by less than 8 %, and cryptoxanthin and gamma-tocopherol by less than 11 %. Although significant temperature effects were observed for <b>alpha-carotene,</b> and alpha- and gamma-tocopherol, and a significant effect of light was observed for <b>alpha-carotene,</b> cryptoxanthin, and lycopene, these analytes changed by less than 1 % per day under all conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Concentrations of these fat-soluble vitamins change by only a few per cent in whole blood during storage at room temperature for several days. Hence, delayed separation of blood samples (which may be required for practical reasons in large-scale epidemiological studies) does not preclude reliable {{measurement of}} fat-soluble vitamins...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{responses to}} self-administered brief questions regarding consumption {{of vegetables and}} fruit by comparison with blood levels of serum carotenoids and red-cell folate. Design: A cross-sectional study in which participants reported their usual intake of fruit and vegetables in servings per day, and serum levels of five carotenoids (<b>alpha-carotene,</b> beta-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, lutein/zeaxanthin and lycopene) and red-cell folate were measured. Serum carotenoid levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography, and red-cell folate by an automated immunoassay system. Settings and subjects: Between October and December 2000, a sample of 1598 adults aged 25 years and over, from six randomly selected urban centres in Queensland, Australia, were examined {{as part of a}} national study conducted to determine the prevalence of diabetes and associated cardiovascular risk factors. Results: Statistically significant (P < 0. 01) associations with vegetable and fruit intake (categorised into groups: = 4 servings per day) were observed for <b>alpha-carotene,</b> beta-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, lutein/zeaxanthin and red-cell folate. The mean level of these carotenoids and of red-cell folate increased with increasing frequency of reported servings of vegetables and fruit, both before and after adjusting for potential confounding factors.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Carotenoids are potent {{antioxidants}} mainly transported {{in the low}} density lipoprotein (LDL) fraction. They {{may also}} influence the immune response and inverse associations with inflammatory markers have been reported. We investigated whether simvastatin, by exerting both lipid-lowering and anti-inflammatory effects, altered the carotenoid status in plasma. METHODS AND RESULTS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study design was applied. Eighty volunteers with mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia received either simvastatin 40 mg or placebo for 6 weeks. Lipids, oxidized LDL (ox-LDL), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL) - 6, oxygenated carotenoids (lutein, zeaxanthin, beta-cryptoxanthin) and hydrocarbon carotenoids (<b>alpha-carotene,</b> beta-carotene, lycopene) were measured in plasma. Simvastatin use was associated with significant reductions in total cholesterol, LDL, ox-LDL and CRP. Simvastatin therapy also resulted in reduced plasma levels of both oxygenated and hydrocarbon carotenoids. However, when adjusted for lipids, all carotenoids except beta-cryptoxanthin showed significant increases after simvastatin therapy. Both crude and lipid-adjusted carotenoids were inversely correlated with CRP and IL- 6 in plasma but the change in carotenoid status during simvastatin therapy was not specifically related to any changes in inflammatory markers. CONCLUSIONS: To summarize, the change in carotenoid status during simvastatin therapy was mainly attributed to the lowering of cholesterol {{and not to the}} suppression of inflammatory activity. After adjustment for lipids, the levels of lutein, lycopene, <b>alpha-carotene</b> and beta-carotene were significantly increased by simvastatin suggesting an increased ratio of carotenoids per particle.

Adipose tissue carotenoid levels in men were 50 - 76 % of those in women, whereas the retinol level in men was 116 % of that in women (p < 0. 001). When all significant predictors of antioxidant levels were considered in men, waist circumference was shown to be an independent predictor of adipose tissue alpha-carotene; age, waist circumference, and alcohol use were independent predictors of beta-carotene; age, body mass index, and waist circumference were predictors of lycopene; and waist circumference, smoking, and alcohol consumption were predictors of retinol. In the same way, in women waist circumference was shown to be an independent predictor of <b>alpha-carotene</b> level, BMI was a predictor of beta-carotene, smoking was a predictor of retinol, and alcohol consumption was a predictor of lycopene.

Objective: To examine effects of vegetarian diet and variations in the habitual intakes of foods and nutrients on blood antioxidants. Subjects and Setting: Thirty-one vegetarians (including six vegans) and 58 omnivores, non-smokers, in Northern Ireland. Design: A diet history method was used to assess habitual diet. Antioxidant vitamins, carotenoids, uric acid, zinc-and ferric-reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) were measured in fasting plasma and activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPX), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) and level of reduced glutathione (GSH) were measured in erythrocytes. Results: Vegetarians had approximately 15 % higher levels of plasma carotenoids compared with omnivores, including lutein (P <= 0. 05), a-cryptoxanthin (P <= 0. 05), lycopene (NS), <b>alpha-carotene</b> (NS) and beta-carotene (NS).

40|$|Latin America has a {{wide variety}} of carotenogenic foods, notable for the {{diversity}} and high levels of carotenoids. A part of this natural wealth has been analyzed. Carrot, red palm oil and some cultivars of squash and pumpkin are sources of both beta-carotene and <b>alpha-carotene.</b> beta-carotene is the principal carotenoid of the palm fruits burití, tucumã and bocaiuva, other fruits such as loquat, marolo and West Indian cherry, and sweet potato. Buriti also has high amounts of <b>alpha-carotene</b> and gamma-carotene. beta-Cryptoxanthin is the major carotenoid in caja, nectarine, orange-fleshed papaya, orange, peach, tangerine and the tree tomato. Lycopene predominates in tomato, red-fleshed papaya, guava, pitanga and watermelon. Pitanga also has substantial amounts of beta-cryptoxanthin, gamma-carotene and rubixanthin. Zeaxanthin, principal carotenoid of corn, is also predominant only in piquí. delta-Carotene is the main carotenoid of the peach palm and zeta-carotene of passion fruit.

40|$|Background: Antioxidants {{in plant}} foods have been {{proposed}} {{to reduce the risk}} of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) by reducing oxidative stress. The objective was to confirm prospective studies on CVD and traditional antioxidants (beta-carotene, alpha-tocopherol), and to investigate emerging antioxidants (<b>alpha-carotene,</b> gamma-tocopherol, cocoa flavanols), and oxidative stress (enzyme activity of glutathione peroxidase- 3) with CVD risk. Methods: In cross-cultural studies, the Cretan (Greece) and Zutphen (The Netherlands) cohorts of Seven Countries Study were compared with respect to long-term mortality of coronary heart disease (CHD), diet, and indicators of oxidative stress. In prospective cohort studies, data were used from the Zutphen Elderly Study (~ 500 men aged 65 - 84 y), the ‘Survey in Europe on Nutrition and the Elderly: a Concerted Action’ (SENECA, 1168 men and women aged 70 - 75 y), and the Minnesota Heart Survey (270 men and women aged 26 - 85 y). Results: The comparison between the Cretan and Zutphen cohorts revealed a 3 -fold lower 40 -year CHD mortality rate in Crete. This lower mortality in Crete was paralleled by a higher consumption of fruit, tomatoes, and olive oil, amongst others, and by a lower consumption of meat, poultry, and dairy. Consequently, the Cretan men had higher intakes of carotenoids, alpha-tocopherol, vitamin C, and dietary fiber, and lower intakes of trans and saturated fatty acids. This was confirmed at the age of ≥ 80 years, when the Cretan men had higher plasma concentrations of major dietary antioxidants (major carotenoids and alpha-tocopherol), a lower iron status, and a lower level of oxidative stress. In the Zutphen Elderly Study, the relative risk (RR) of 15 -y CVD mortality for 1 standard deviation (SD) increase in dietary intake was 0. 81 [95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 66 - 0. 99] for <b>alpha-carotene</b> and 0. 80 (95 % CI: 0. 66 - 0. 97) for beta-carotene. The intake of tocopherols was not related to CVD death. In SENECA, plasma concentrations of carotene (sum of alpha- and beta-carotene) were inversely related to CVD mortality (RR for 1 SD increase: 0. 83; 95 % CI: 0. 70 - 1. 00), but plasma concentrations of alpha-tocopherol were not. The daily use of 4 grams of cocoa, a rich source of flavanols, was related to a 3. 7 mm Hg lower systolic (95 % CI: – 7. 1 to – 0. 3) and a 2. 1 mm Hg lower (95 % CI: – 4. 0 to – 0. 2) diastolic blood pressure. The same amount of cocoa was also related to a 50 % lower risk of 15 -year CVD mortality (RR: 0. 50; 95 % CI: 0. 32 - 0. 78). Finally, in the Minnesota Heart Survey, the odds ratio of CVD mortality for the highest vs. the lowest quartile of glutathione peroxidase- 3 activity was 0. 42 (95 % CI: 0. 21 - 0. 86). This inverse relation was confined to those with low concentrations of HDL cholesterol (odds ratio highest vs. lowest quartile: 0. 17; 95 % CI: 0. 06 - 0. 47). Conclusion: The Cretan Mediterranean diet is rich in antioxidants, which may partly contribute to the low observed CHD mortality. The findings on beta-carotene support previous observational studies suggesting that this carotenoid relates to a lower CVD risk. We showed that <b>alpha-carotene</b> is correlated with beta-carotene in the diet, and <b>alpha-carotene</b> was also related to a lower CVD mortality. The results on alpha-tocopherol are in line with the outcomes of clinical trials and do not indicate a role for this vitamin in lowering CVD mortality in elderly populations...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the alpha- and beta-carotene content of supermarket vs roadside stand produce using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The fruits and vegetables were obtained from a major local supermarket chain (Doug's Shop'n Save, Bangor Mall, Bangor, ME) and three roadside stands in Dixmont, Etna and Charleston, ME. Thirteen vegetables and one fruit were sampled during a ten week period between July and September of 1985. Significant differences at the 0. 05 level were observed between supermarket and roadside stand produce for only Swiss chard and green peppers with roadside stands having higher beta-carotene levels in both instances. <b>Alpha-carotene</b> was shown to be non significant among sources at the 0. 05 level in all cases...|$|E
40|$|Background: Reliability or {{validity}} {{studies are}} important {{for the evaluation of}} measurement error in dietary assessment methods. An approach to validation known as the method of triads uses triangulation techniques to calculate the validity coefficient of a food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Objective: To assess the validity of an FFQ estimates of carotenoid and vitamin E intake against serum biomarker measurements and weighed food records (WFRs), by applying the method of triads. Design: The study population was a sub-sample of adult participants in a randomised controlled trial of beta-carotene and sunscreen in the prevention of skin cancer. Dietary intake was assessed by a self-administered FFQ and a WFR. Nonfasting blood samples were collected and plasma analysed for five carotenoids (<b>alpha-carotene,</b> beta-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, lutein, lycopene) and vitamin E. Correlation coefficients were calculated between each of the dietary methods and the validity coefficient was calculated using the method of triads. The 95 % confidence intervals for the validity coefficients were estimated using bootstrap sampling. Results: The validity coefficients of the FFQ were highest for <b>alpha-carotene</b> (0. 85) and lycopene (0. 62), followed by beta- carotene (0. 55) and total carotenoids (0. 55), while the lowest validity coefficient was for lutein (0. 19). The method of triads could not be used for b- cryptoxanthin and vitamin E, as one of the three underlying correlations was negative. Conclusions: Results were similar to other studies of validity using biomarkers and the method of triads. For many dietary factors, the upper limit of the validity coefficients was less than 0. 5 and therefore only strong relationships between dietary exposure and disease will be detected...|$|E
40|$|Several {{components}} of the metabolic syndrome, particularly diabetes and cardiovascular disease, {{are known to be}} oxidative stress-related conditions and there is research to suggest that antioxidant nutrients may play a protective role in these conditions. Carotenoids are compounds derived primarily from plants and several {{have been shown to be}} potent antioxidant nutrients. The aim of this study was to examine the associations between metabolic syndrome status and major serum carotenoids in adult Australians. Data on the presence of the metabolic syndrome, based on International Diabetes Federation 2005 criteria, were collected from 1523 adults aged 25 years and over in six randomly selected urban centers in Queensland, Australia, using a cross-sectional study design. Weight, height, BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting and 2 -hour blood glucose and lipids were determined, as well as five serum carotenoids. Mean serum <b>alpha-carotene,</b> beta-carotene and the sum of the five carotenoid concentrations were significantly lower (p< 0. 05) in persons with the metabolic syndrome (after adjusting for age, sex, education, BMI status, alcohol intake, smoking, physical activity status and vitamin/mineral use) than persons without the syndrome. Alpha, beta and total carotenoids also decreased significantly (p< 0. 05) with increased number of {{components of}} the metabolic syndrome, after adjusting for these confounders. These differences were significant among former smokers and non-smokers, but not in current smokers. Low concentrations of serum <b>alpha-carotene,</b> beta-carotene and the sum of five carotenoids appear to be associated with metabolic syndrome status. Additional research, particularly longitudinal studies, may help to determine if these associations are causally related to the metabolic syndrome, or are a result of the pathologies of the syndrome...|$|E
40|$|Dietary {{carotenoids}} {{have been}} hypothesized {{to protect against}} epithelial cancers. The authors analyzed the associations between intakes of specific carotenoids (<b>alpha-carotene,</b> beta-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, lutein þ zeaxanthin, and lycopene) and risk of colorectal cancer using the primary data from 11 cohort studies carried out in North America and Europe. Carotenoid intakes were estimated from food frequency questionnaires administered at baseline in each study. During 6 – 20 years of follow-up between 1980 and 2003, 7, 885 incident cases of colorectal cancer were diagnosed among 702, 647 participants. The authors calculated study-specific multivariate relative risks and then combined them using a random-effects model. In general, intakes of specific carotenoids were not associated with colorectal cancer risk. The pooled multivariate relative risks of colorectal cancer com...|$|E
