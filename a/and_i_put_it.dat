The same article also noted a humorous ode to black {{as a part of a}} wardrobe or in fact as a wardrobe, when one character notes: [...] "Sometimes I buy something that isn't black, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> on and I am so sorry".|$|E
500|$|... "Young Girls" [...] {{was first}} {{performed}} on Saturday Night Live {{and was released}} as the first promotional single taken from Unorthodox Jukebox, on November 6, 2012 on iTunes. Later, it was reported by Mars that the record {{was scheduled to be}} the second single from the album. This release involved little planning according to Mars [...] "I felt [...] was good. None of these things are planned, which one goes first, which one goes second. One day I wake up and I say, 'You know what? I want the world to hear this song that I wrote called 'Young Girls,' <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> out". However, a week later, while performing [...] "When I Was Your Man" [...] on the third season finale of The Voice, he announced that the track played would be the second official single from the album. The fifth and overall single, [...] "Young Girls", was first liberated on Australian contemporary hit radio, on November 26, 2013, after being promoted by Mars in radio station, Nova. Subsequently, the song was released to United States and United Kingdom contemporary hit radios on December 10, 2013 and February 17, 2014, respectively. Italian radio stations began adding the track onto their playlist on February 26, 2014. Later, on April 4, 2014 a CD single containing the track as released in Finland.|$|E
500|$|Qs Mat Snow called Achtung Baby U2's [...] "heaviest {{album to}} date. And best." [...] Snow praised {{the band and}} its {{production}} team for making [...] "music of drama, depth, intensity and, believe it, funkiness". Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune felt the record [...] "shows the band in a grittier light: disrupting, rather than fulfilling, expectations". He praised Lanois' production and said that due to the Edge's guitar playing, [...] "U2 sounds punkier than it has since its 1980 debut, Boy". Kot concluded his review by calling the album [...] "a magnificent search for transcendence {{made all the more}} moving for its flaws". Niall Stokes of Hot Press wrote, [...] "Ostensibly decadent, sensual and dark, it is a record of, and for, these times." [...] The New Zealand Herald found it [...] "pretty damn good" [...] and its sound [...] "subdued, tightly controlled, [...] introverted". However, it said that too many [...] "downbeat moments where songs seem to be going nowhere" [...] prevented it from being a [...] "truly wondrous affair". In Spin, Jim Greer was more critical of the album, calling it an [...] "ambitious failure"; the review welcomed its experimentation but judged that when the group [...] "strays from familiar territory, the results are hit-and-miss". Village Voice critic Robert Christgau rated it a dud, and in 1994, he reflected on this sentiment: [...] "After many, many tries, Achtung Baby still sounded like a damnably diffuse U2 album to me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in the hall unable to describe a single song." [...] In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the band's musical transformation as [...] "thorough", [...] "effective", and [...] "endlessly inventive". Erlewine concluded that few artists at that stage in their career could have [...] "recorded an album as adventurous or fulfilled their ambitions quite as successfully as U2 [...] ".|$|E

2500|$|During {{the fourth}} round, Ali coasted, keeping his distance. However, when he {{returned}} to his corner, he started complaining that there was something burning in his eyes and he could not see. [...] "I didn't know what the heck was going on", Angelo Dundee, Ali's trainer, recalled on an NBC special 25 years later. [...] "He said, 'cut the gloves off. I want to prove to the world there's dirty work afoot.' And I said, 'whoa, whoa, back up baby. C'mon now, this is for the title, this is the big apple. What are you doing? Sit down!' So I get him down, I get the sponge and I pour the water into his eyes trying to cleanse whatever's there, but before I did that I put my pinkie in his eye <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> into my eye.

2500|$|In February 2014, {{during a}} Q session for the album, at SONOS Studios in Los Angeles, California, Schoolboy Q {{described}} the song [...] "Prescription/Oxymoron", {{as the most}} personal: [...] "I came up selling OxyContin," [...] he said. [...] "The karma behind it was that I never took an OxyContin before but I did get addicted to Percocets, Xanax, Codeine—shit like that. When my daughter was one and two , I used to get into sleep comas, like 'Xan comas'—just dead to the world <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> into the music." [...] Schoolboy Q said he arranged the song to juxtapose the process of selling prescription pills and addiction: [...] "I put the OxyContin and selling {{it at the end}} of the relapse or the addiction," [...] he said. [...] "I sold OxyContin and then I got addicted [...] This way, I showed that I got addicted then I sold it. That was a crazy record. That's true shit—the first part of it when my daughter tried to wake me up and I was dead to the world. That was my little secret. I always had the cup with me. They just never knew I had a gang of pills in the other bottle. That was a little story about me and how I was addicted, too." ...|$|E

6000|$|Another {{baffling}} metaphor.
