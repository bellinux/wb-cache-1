5|$|Many Polistes species {{aggregate}} over winter. Polistes exclamans clump {{in rather}} large aggregations while hibernating. “These aggregations are frequently found in protected places called hibernacula {{that can be}} <b>as</b> <b>varied</b> as crevices and cracks of rocks or trunks, beneath the bark of trees, between walls of buildings, or any other natural or artificial structures that provides protection during hibernation.” Although Polistes exclamans {{have been found in}} organ-pipe muddauber nests, a mud nest that can provide a certain level of protection, it is not thought to actually house hibernating Polistes exclamans over the winter.|$|E

5|$|Most {{settlers}} in every colony were small farmers, but other industries developed {{within a few}} decades <b>as</b> <b>varied</b> as the settlements. Cash crops included tobacco, rice and wheat. Extraction industries grew up in furs, fishing and lumber. Manufacturers produced rum and ships, and by the late colonial period Americans were producing one-seventh of the world's iron supply. Cities eventually dotted the coast to support local economies and serve as trade hubs. English colonists were supplemented by waves of Scotch-Irish and other groups. As coastal land grew more expensive, freed indentured servants pushed further west.|$|E
5|$|Salford is {{credited}} as {{the birthplace of}} the Bush Roller Chain. Hans Renold, a Swiss-born engineer, came to Salford in the late 19th century. In 1879 he purchased a small textile-chain making business in Ordsall from James Slater and founded the Hans Renold Company, what is now Renold, a firm which still produces chains. Renold invented the bush roller chain shortly after and began producing it. It is the type of chain most commonly used for transmission of mechanical power on bicycles, motorbikes, to industrial and agricultural machinery to uses <b>as</b> <b>varied</b> as rollercoasters and escalators.|$|E
5|$|The Trust {{has some}} 50 members {{of staff and}} 500 volunteers who work {{together}} on activities <b>as</b> <b>varied</b> as water management, chalk grassland restoration, helping people with special needs and giving children {{an opportunity to go}} pond-dipping. The Trust collaborates with government agencies, local authorities, housing associations, commercial companies, building developers and sponsors to create plans and strategies at local, regional and national level, including the All London Green Grid and Biodiversity Action Plans. The Trust's reserves receive over 230,000 visitors per year. The trust is supported by over 14,000 members.|$|E

50|$|Daenerys {{returns and}} Drogon allows Jon to pet him. Jorah has {{returned}} and Daenerys welcomes him. Varys and Tyrion privately discuss {{the brutality of}} Daenerys's executions, and the morality of serving a ruler who puts others to death (<b>as</b> <b>Varys</b> did for the Mad King). Varys implores Tyrion to make Daenerys listen.|$|R
5|$|Wearing either {{all black}} or all white dresses ordered from Paris, Marrash hosted the mixed evening get-togethers in which {{literary}} topics <b>as</b> <b>varied</b> as the Mu`allaqat—a cycle of seven pre-Islamic poems—or {{the work of}} Rabelais were discussed. Chess and card games were played, and complicated poetry competitions took place; wine and 'araq flowed freely; participants sang, danced, and listened to records played on a phonograph.|$|E
5|$|Film noirs {{tend to have}} unusually {{convoluted}} story lines, frequently involving flashbacks {{and other}} editing techniques that disrupt and sometimes obscure the narrative sequence. Framing the entire primary narrative as a flashback is also a standard device. Voiceover narration, sometimes used as a structuring device, {{came to be seen}} as a noir hallmark; while classic noir is generally associated with first-person narration (i.e., by the protagonist), Stephen Neale notes that third-person narration is common among noirs of the semidocumentary style. Neo-noirs <b>as</b> <b>varied</b> as The Element of Crime (surrealist), After Dark, My Sweet (retro), and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (meta) have employed the flashback/voiceover combination.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo was, and is, renowned {{primarily}} as a painter. Among his works, the Mona Lisa is the most famous and most parodied portrait and The Last Supper the most reproduced religious painting of all time. Leonardo's drawing of the Vitruvian Man is also regarded as a cultural icon, being reproduced on items <b>as</b> <b>varied</b> as the euro coin, textbooks, and T-shirts. Perhaps fifteen of his paintings have survived. Nevertheless, these few works, together with his notebooks, which contain drawings, scientific diagrams, and his thoughts {{on the nature of}} painting, compose a contribution to later generations of artists rivalled only by that of his contemporary, Michelangelo.|$|E

5|$|The Edict on Maximum Prices (Edictum De Pretiis Rerum Venalium) {{was issued}} {{two to three}} months after the coinage edict, somewhere between 20 November and 10 December 301. The best-preserved Latin {{inscription}} surviving from the Greek East, the edict survives in many versions, on materials <b>as</b> <b>varied</b> as wood, papyrus, and stone. In the edict, Diocletian declared that the current pricing crisis resulted from the unchecked greed of merchants, and had resulted in turmoil for the mass of common citizens. The language of the edict calls on the people's memory of their benevolent leaders, and exhorts them to enforce the provisions of the edict, and thereby restore perfection to the world. The edict goes on to list in detail over one thousand goods and accompanying retail prices not to be exceeded. Penalties are laid out for various pricing transgressions.|$|E
5|$|The University of Alaska also grew {{during this}} period. In 1946, Congress {{appropriated}} money {{for construction of}} a Geophysical Institute to study Arctic phenomena such as the aurora borealis. The institute was established in 1949 and spurred the university's growth as the GI Bill simultaneously boosted the student population. Elementary education also developed as the Fairbanks Independent School District (the precursor to today's Fairbanks North Star Borough School District) was established in 1947 to collect school taxes from areas outside city limits that were sending students to Fairbanks' school. The Golden Valley Electric Association, an electrical cooperative, was founded in the 1940s to provide electricity to areas outside Fairbanks city limits. In 1953, it bought the FE Co. power plant that served Fairbanks and provided electricity to customers <b>as</b> <b>varied</b> as Fairbanks' second radio station, KFRB, and the town's largest farm, Creamer's Dairy.|$|E
5|$|Because A Trip to the Moon {{preceded the}} {{development}} of narrative film editing by filmmakers such as Edwin S. Porter and D. W. Griffith, it does not use the cinematic vocabulary to which American and European audiences later became accustomed, a vocabulary built on the purposeful use of techniques such <b>as</b> <b>varied</b> camera angles, intercutting, juxtapositions of shots, and other filmic ideas. Rather, each camera setup in Méliès's film is designed as a distinct dramatic scene uninterrupted by visible editing, an approach fitting the theatrical style in which the film was designed. Similarly, film scholars have noted that the most famous moment in A Trip to the Moon plays with temporal continuity by showing an event twice: first the capsule is shown suddenly appearing {{in the eye of}} an anthropomorphic moon; then, in a much closer shot, the landing occurs very differently, and much more realistically, with the capsule actually plummeting into believable lunar terrain. This kind of nonlinear storytelling—in which time and space are treated as repeatable and flexible rather than linear and causal—is highly unconventional by the standards of Griffith and his followers; before {{the development of}} continuity editing, however, other filmmakers performed similar experiments with time. (Porter, for instance, used temporal discontinuity and repetition extensively in his 1903 film Life of an American Fireman.) Later in the twentieth century, with sports television's development of the instant replay, temporal repetition again became a familiar device to screen audiences.|$|E

5|$|Cannel coal (also called candle coal) {{is a type}} of {{terrestrial}} shale, which is hydrogen-rich brown to black coal, sometimes with shaly texture, composed of resins, spores, waxes, cutinaceous and corky materials derived from terrestrial vascular plants as well <b>as</b> <b>varied</b> amounts of vitrinite and inertinite. Lacustrine shales consist of Lamosite and Torbanite. Lamosite is a pale-brown and grayish-brown to dark-gray to black oil shale whose chief organic constituent is lamalginite derived from lacustrine planktonic algae. Torbanite, named after Torbane Hill in Scotland, is a black oil shale whose organic matter is telalginite derived from lipid-rich Botryococcus and related algal forms. Marine shales consist of three varieties, namely Kukersite, Tasmanite, and Marinite. Kukersite, named after Kukruse in Estonia, is a light-brown marine oil shale whose principal organic component is telalginite derived from the green alga, Gloeocapsomorpha prisca. Tasmanite, named after Tasmania, is a brown to black oil shale whose organic matter consists of telalginite derived chiefly from unicellular tasmanitid algae of marine origin. Marinite is a gray to dark-gray to black oil shale of marine origin in which the chief organic components are lamalginite and bituminite derived from marine phytoplankton with varied admixtures of bitumen, telalginite, and vitrinite.|$|E
5|$|Facing {{competition}} <b>as</b> <b>varied</b> {{as television}} and football, baseball attendance {{at all levels}} declined. While the majors rebounded by the mid-1950s, the minor leagues were gutted and hundreds of semipro and amateur teams dissolved. Integration proceeded slowly: by 1953, only six of the 16 major league teams had a black player on the roster. That year, the Major League Baseball Players Association was founded. It was the first professional baseball union to survive more than briefly, but it remained largely ineffective for years. No major league team had been located west of St. Louis until 1958, when the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants relocated to Los Angeles and San Francisco, respectively. The majors' final all-white bastion, the Boston Red Sox, added a black player in 1959. With {{the integration of the}} majors drying up the available pool of players, the last Negro league folded the following year. In 1961, the American League reached the West Coast with the Los Angeles Angels expansion team, and the major league season was extended from 154 games to 162. This coincidentally helped Roger Maris break Babe Ruth's long-standing single-season home run record, one of the most celebrated marks in baseball. Along with the Angels, three other new franchises were launched during 1961–62. With this, the first major league expansion in 60 years, each league now had ten teams.|$|E

60|$|The second Problem of Knot VI. is {{an example}} in {{ordinary}} Double Rule of Three, whose essential feature is that the result depends on the variation of several elements, which are so related to it that, if all but one be constant, it <b>varies</b> <b>as</b> that one: hence, if none be constant, it <b>varies</b> <b>as</b> their product. Thus, for example, the cubical contents of a rectangular tank <b>vary</b> <b>as</b> its length, if breadth and depth be constant, and so on; hence, if none be constant, it <b>varies</b> <b>as</b> {{the product of the}} length, breadth, and depth.|$|R
