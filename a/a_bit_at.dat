500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the suite has always been mixed, and all band members have expressed negativity toward it in recent times. Gilmour has said the album was [...] "a load of rubbish. We were at a real down point ... I think we were scraping the barrel <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>at</b> that period" [...] and [...] "a good idea but it was dreadful... Atom Heart Mother sounds like we didn't have any idea between us, but we became much more prolific after it." [...] Similarly, in a 1984 interview on BBC Radio 1, Waters said [...] "If somebody said to me now – right – here's a million pounds, {{go out and play}} Atom Heart Mother, I'd say you must be fucking joking." [...] Alec Dubro of Rolling Stone gave Atom Heart Mother a negative review, ultimately stating [...] "if Pink Floyd is looking for some new dimensions, they haven't found them here." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 1970, Pink Floyd {{released}} Atom Heart Mother. An early version premièred in France in January, but {{disagreements over}} the mix prompted {{the hiring of}} Ron Geesin {{to work out the}} sound issues. Geesin worked to improve the score, but with little creative input from the band, production was troublesome. Geesin eventually completed the project with the aid of John Alldis, who was the director of the choir hired to perform on the record. Smith earned an executive producer credit, and the album marked his final official contribution to the band's discography. Gilmour said it was [...] "A neat way of saying that he didn't... do anything". Waters was critical of Atom Heart Mother, claiming that he would prefer if it were [...] "thrown into the dustbin and never listened to by anyone ever again". Gilmour was equally dismissive of the album and once described it as [...] "a load of rubbish", stating: [...] "I think we were scraping the barrel <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>at</b> that period". Pink Floyd's first number 1 album, Atom Heart Mother was hugely successful in Britain, spending 18 weeks on the UK chart. It premièred at the Bath Festival on 27 June 1970.|$|E
