In 1966, Slodki reported discovering an acidic polysaccharide from haploid cells of T.mesenterica that closely resembled those produced by the species Cryptococcus laurentii. The structural similarity of the polysaccharides from the two species suggested a phylogenetic relationship between them. Subsequently, researchers chemically synthesized the polysaccharide, and determined the chemical identities of the component sugar units. The polysaccharide, known as glucuronoxylomannan—produced by fruit bodies and in pure culture conditions—has been shown to consist of a mannan backbone that is glycosylated with xylan chains in a regular repeating structure. Laboratory tests have associated a number of biological activities with T.mesenterica glucuronoxylomannan, including immunostimulatory, protecting against radiation, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, hypocholesterolemic, hepatoprotective, and <b>antiallergic</b> effects.|$|E

Asthma severity was classified as : 1) intermiitent; 2) mild persistent; 3) moderate persistent; 4) severe persistent. 1. The total cost of drugs used for each patient for 1 year was the highest (￥ 263, 710) in patients of stage 4 (severe persistent) and the lowest (￥ 74, 670) in those of stage 1 (intermittent). The costs of bronchodilators and <b>antiallergics</b> were predominant at all stages, and their cost increased significantly with increasing severity. 2. The costs of drugs such as <b>antiallergics</b> and bronchodilators were predominant, {{and the costs of}} drugs such as inhaled corticosteroids and mucolytics were considerably high in pa-tients of all stages. 3.

40|$|Common drugs {{intended}} for action in plasma (antibacterials, <b>antiallergics,</b> diuretics¿) often display both acidic and basic behavior, {{and some of}} these amphoteric compounds can appear as zwitterions. In such cases, accurate profiling of lipophilicity vs. pH, which plays a fundamental role in drug pharmacokinetics, might be complex. In the present work two common lipophilicity estimation methods based on the drug distribution between 1 -octanol and aqueous buffer i. e. phase equilibration (shake-flask) and two-phase titration (potentiometry), were compared with a high-throughput lipophilicity index, the Chromatographic Hydrophobicity Index (CHI). The results were also compared with log Do/w pH-profiles calculated by different algorithms from ACD/Labs. Accurate and similar results were obtained for both octanol-water approaches but, due to the lower determination times and the absence of different ion-pairing buffers, potentiometry was shown to be the most convenient method. CHI vs. pH profiles provide rapid and efficient information, which is very convenient for lipophilicity screening purposes, but may differ slightly from shake-flask and potentiometric results...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Depression {{is one of}} {{the five}} most {{frequent}} disorders in primary care practice and often remains unrecognized. One of the reasons why depression often passes unnoticed is comorbidity – a number of different chronic diseases coexist with depression, especially in elderly patients. Aim: The aim of this research was to assess the difference between depressed and non-depressed patients regarding somatic and mental comorbidity. The differences in drug use were also examined. Subjects and Methods: Five hundred successive adult patients visiting family physicians in Rijeka, Croatia, were polled using the Beck Depression Inventory and a general questionnaire which was created for the purpose of the study. The existing medical records were also used. Results: Elevated depression level was determined in 48. 1 % of the examinees. These patients were suffering from larger number of chronic diseases (X= 1. 23) than non-depressed patients (X= 0. 70; t= 5. 07; p< 0. 001; z= 4. 93; p< 0. 001), especially cardiac, mental, renal and osteomuscular diseases. Depressed persons used significantly more drugs (X= 1. 28) than non-depressed patients (X= 0. 58; t= 6. 10; p< 0. 001; z= 5. 78; p< 0. 001), especially antirheumatics, analgesics, sedatives, antidepressants, <b>antiallergics</b> and diuretics.

40|$|Introduction: Epidemiology of skin {{diseases}} {{has been}} studied and evaluated occasionally. In view of high incidence of skin diseases and economic burden that it poses, {{there is a need}} to evaluate the present epidemiology and prescribing pattern of skin disorders. Objective: To assess common skin conditions, drug utilization patterns and cost analysis in Dermatology Out patients Department (OPD) of Tertiary Care hospital. Methodology: After taking Ethics committee’s permission, prescriptions of 600 patients attending Dermatology OPD were audited. The prescriptions were analyzed for common skin conditions drug utilization and cost analysis. Results: The common skin conditions found were Pyoderma and Scabies while common classes of drugs prescribed were <b>antiallergics,</b> antifungals and steroids. Drugs prescribed by Generic name were 16. 6 % and Brand names were 83. 4 %. It was revealed that 30 % of total drugs dispensed from hospital pharmacy and 70 % from outside pharmacy. Average hospital and outside pharmacy costs were INR 19. 40 and INR 116. 20, respectively. The outside pharmacy cost of prescription (Spearman’s Rho = - 0. 130, p < 0. 01) as well as cost paid by the patients (Spearman’s Rho = 0. 408, p < 0. 001) had a negative correlation with the socioeconomic score as the drugs were prescribed irrespective of the socioeconomic class. Conclusion: The dermatological prescription analysis gives a message to the prescribing physician to achieve rational and cost effective medical care. The drugs which are made available in the hospital pharmacy should be based on clinical evidence generated from meta-analysis of drug studies, pharmacoepidemiology and pharmacoeconomic studies. There is dire need for physicians training with regards to rational use of drugs and pharmacoeconomics. Hospital should make essential drugs available with continuous monitoring to improve the prescribing pattern. The limitation of this study is that the actual direct costs and indirect costs were not studied. It opens the scope for further study in this area...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Prescription of {{medicines}} by non-doctors {{is an issue}} with serious global implications. To our knowledge prescription of drugs by medical and non-medical students has not been studied before. We aimed to determine the practice and attitudes of drug prescription by medical students and: a) how non-medical students respond to this practice, b) How this compares with the attitudes and practices of non-medical students. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on a sample of 600 students randomly selected from 2 medical and 2 non-medical universities. Ethical requirements were ensured and data was collected using self administered questionnaires. The Chi square tests and logistic univariate regression analyses were performed using SPSS v 14 to identify associations and differences. Results A total of 572 forms were completed and {{the sample consisted of}} 295 medical students and 277 non-medical students with no significant difference in their demographic profile. Of the 295 medical students 163 (55. 3 %) had prescribed a medicine independently and most (48. 5 %) said that they did this 2 – 3 times a year. The commonest reasons for this were 'previous experience' (68. 7 %), 'problem too trivial' (34. 4 %) and 'we knew everything about the condition' (31. 3 %). One-third (33. 6 %) of the undergraduate medical students thought that it was alright to independently diagnose an illness while a vast majority (78. 3 %) thought that it was alright for them to prescribe medicines to others. Common prescriptions were pain-killers, antipyretics, <b>antiallergics</b> and antibiotics. Medical students who prescribed medicines were of lesser age (CI = 1. 366 – 1. 887) and more likely to belong to the 1 st (CI = 3. 588 – 21. 731), 2 nd (CI = 2. 059 – 10. 869) or 3 rd (CI = 4. 331 – 26. 374) year of medical college. One-third (33. 9 %) of the non-medical students reported that a medical student had prescribed medicines to them and 21. 3 % said that they trusted medical students and would follow their advice blindly. Many students thought it alright for medical students to diagnose and treat illnesses. A similar proportion of non-medical students (58. 5 %) reported prescribing medicines to others. Conclusion Prescription {{of medicines}} by non-doctors is rampant and urgent corrective measures are warranted. We have highlighted areas for future research and intervention and have given a few recommendations. </p...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{review is}} {{provoked}} {{because of lack}} of awareness of the medical practitioners in Bulgaria concerning of the ethnology, pathogenesis, clinical symptoms and treatment of the ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP). This can be a source of prolonged diagnostic delays, as some cases reporting in another country in Europe, for example Germany, Spain and UK. Varna is the sea town with many sailor crews returning from tropical and subtropical regions, or CFP can affect people who travel to the Pacific and Caribbean or ate exotic fish from supermarket. The information of this fish food-borne poisoning is part of student’s education in discipline “Marine medicine” in Medical University, Varna. Materials and methods: To present better information from different authors and last scientific data, we made review of published materials of 58 issues to construct definition, history, etiology, pathogenesis (toxins and mechanisms of action), clinical symptoms, treatment and prevention of the Ciguatera or ichtyosarcotoxicosis, a wide spread food-born poisoning. Results: Ciguatera poisoning is ichtyosarcotoxicosis, a wide-spread foodborne poisoning in people after consumption of flesh of different kinds of fishes in which toxins produced by poisonous microorganisms (Dinoflagellates) have accumulated. The poisoning develops by accumulating toxins higher up the food chain starting with toxin producing dinoflagellates (species: Gambierdiscus toxicus, Prorocentrum concavum, Pr. lima, Ostreoposis lenticularis, Ostr. Siamensis and others), continuing with the poisoned algae (species: Portieria, Halymenia, Turbinaria, Sargassum), and after that involving small crustacea and small fishes to greater fishes (vector fishes, genus Herbivores and Carnivores), in which the toxins have been stored in amount, great enough to cause foodborne poisoning in humans. This poisoning is widespread in tropical and subtropical regions, but because of its delayed toxic effects, lasting for months and years, {{there is a possibility that}} every medic can encounter its unusual symptoms, requiring specific treatment. The following toxins cause the poisoning: ciguatoxin, meitotoxin, ostreotoxin, domoic acid and some other unspecified toxins. They are lipid soluble, thermo stable and cannot be decomposed by culinary processing. These toxins have neurotoxic, cardiotoxic, hemolytic properties and cause diarrheic syndrome. Clinical presentation is characterized by average latent period of 12 hours after the consummation, vomiting and diarrhea next 24 hours and neurological symptoms that appear at the beginning of the poisoning with paresthesias along the body, changing feeling of hot and cold, strong myalgia. Disturbances in cardiac rhythm and conduction, strong dehydration or shock are possible in severe cases. Light cases pass over in several days, but, more often the poisoning has a chronic course – from 3 - 4 months to 1 year, with prevalence of neurologic symptoms: myalgia, paresthesias, skin itching with scratches, depression. The management is not specific and includes stomach lavage with activated charcoal, fluids replacement during the first 24 hours, corticosteroids, <b>antiallergics,</b> high doses of vitamins from group B (Vit. B 1, Vit. B 6, Vit. B 12), mannitol IV, nootropic medicaments, antidepressants and other symptomatic medicaments.
