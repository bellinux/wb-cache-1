She also believes the government should address concerns about the mental health of unemployed young people.|$|E
5|$|There {{are still}} intense areas of shadow which throw the Cumaean Sibyl into relief. But {{it is more}} than relief; it is the three-dimensionality which art-lovers expect to see {{in the work of the}} man who sculpted Moses. Critics of the {{restoration}} claim that this was Michelangelo's aim and that many frescoes had brightly contrasting colours laid side-by-side that were then worked over a secco to achieve this effect <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> what has been lost by a too-scrupulous cleaning.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, Anthony Camp {{challenges}} {{the belief that}} Sophia had a child and provides a detailed summary of the available evidence. In his book Royal Babylon: the Alarming History of European Royalty, author Karl Shaw writes {{of the possibility that}} the Duke raped his sister, citing evidence from Charles Greville's diaries, as well as other factors. Historian Gillian Gill believes that Sophia secretly gave birth to the child <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the reason Sophia never married. Alison Weir and others, however, write of a possible marriage between Sophia and Garth the same year as the child's birth, but {{there is no evidence to}} back this assertion other than the presence of a wedding ring in a portrait of an aged Sophia.|$|E

5|$|The Bronze Age– {{defined by}} the use of metal– began around 2500 BC, with {{technology}} changing people's everyday lives during this period through innovations such as the wheel; harnessing oxen; weaving textiles; brewing alcohol; and skilful metalworking, which produced new weapons and tools, along with fine gold decoration and jewellery, such as brooches and torcs. According to John T. Koch and others, Ireland in the Late Bronze Age was part of a maritime trading-network culture called the Atlantic Bronze Age that also included Britain, western France and Iberia, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> where Celtic languages developed. This contrasts with the traditional view that their origin lies in mainland Europe with the Hallstatt culture.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of the G-spot has not been proven, nor has the source of female ejaculation. Although the G-spot has been studied since the 1940s, disagreement persists over its existence as a distinct structure, definition and location. A 2009 British study concluded that its existence is unproven and subjective, based on questionnaires and personal experience. Other studies, using ultrasound, have found physiological evidence of the G-spot in women who report having orgasms during vaginal intercourse. It is also hypothesized that the G-spot {{is an extension of}} the clitoris <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the cause of orgasms experienced vaginally.|$|E
25|$|Brain imaging {{studies show}} that during cocaine withdrawal, {{metabolism}} is increased in the OFC <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> proportional to drug craving. In contrast, during protracted (up to 3–4 months) withdrawal cocaine abusers show reduced activity in the OFC compared to healthy controls.|$|E

25|$|Controversial {{statements}} about human races {{can be found}} in the book. Gardner believes that William S. Sadler, who wrote some eugenicist works, had a hand in editing or writing the book, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> how the ideas were included.|$|E
25|$|In {{a number}} of Muslim-majority {{countries}} the law requires women to cover either their legs, shoulders and head, or the whole body apart from the face. In strictest forms, the face as well must be covered leaving just a mesh to see through. These hijab rules for dressing cause tensions, concerning particularly Muslims living in Western countries, where restrictions are considered both sexist and oppressive. Some Muslims oppose this charge, and instead declare that the media in these countries presses on women to reveal too much {{in order to be}} deemed attractive, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> itself sexist and oppressive.|$|E
25|$|In {{his message}} to the {{faithful}} of the Diocese for that occasion, Patriarch Alexei of Moscow and All Russia stressed that the Cathedral {{is home to a}} 'multitudinous and multilingual flock', <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> quite proper for the Church, being 'a single body made up of many and dissimilar members, filled with one Spirit'. Alexei exhorted the members of the Diocese to 'bear one another's burdens and so fulfil the law of Christ' (Gal. 6:2). He hoped that the celebrations would contribute to the 'healing' of the 'wounds' inflicted upon the Diocese in recent times.|$|E
25|$|The {{controversy}} around Saunière originally {{centered on}} parchments {{that he is}} said to have found hidden in the old altar of his church, that related to the treasure of Blanche of Castile, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the theoretical source of his income.|$|R

2500|$|In a {{footnote}} of his 1909 work, Analysis of a Phobia in a Five year old Boy, Freud theorized that the universal fear of castration was provoked in the uncircumcised when they perceived circumcision <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> [...] "the deepest unconscious root of anti-Semitism".|$|R
25|$|Chapter 2 {{is about}} {{economics}} {{as it has}} been practised in the years leading up to 2009. The author refers to Keynes's view that an over-reliance on maths is a mistake, because mathematical models will always depend on the validity of their underlying assumptions. Skidelsky says that modern mainstream macroeconomics has become closely integrated with maths, {{at the expense of other}} disciplines such as political economy and history, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> partly why it became so unreliable at making accurate predictions or offering good advice. Various schools of thought within modern economics are briefly discussed, such as rational expectations, real business cycle theory and efficient market theory.|$|E
25|$|According to the 2002 census, {{there were}} 572 Serbian {{citizens}} of Greek ethnicity. Greek community associations in Serbia estimate {{a total of}} 4,500 Serbian citizens of Greek ethnic descent. The Greek Foreign Ministry asserts that marriages between Serbs and Greeks living in Serbia are quite common, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> both a cause and result of the close bonds shared by many Greeks and Serbs. In February 2008, the Greek minority living in Serbia turned to Greece to not recognize the unilateral secession in Kosovo by the Kosovo Albanians. They stated that the independence of Kosovo would endanger the stability in the Balkans and weaken the traditional Serbian-Greek relations.|$|E
25|$|On July 12, Marissa finally admits her {{feelings}} for Bianca and they kiss. Bianca then pulls away during the kiss, {{saying that she}} can't do this <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a mistake. Bianca then explains that all her relationships have been a dead end – that, in the end, she ends up losing her lover and best friend. However, later on, Bianca walks in as Marissa tells JR that she wants Bianca. Marissa then confesses to both Bianca and JR that she {{is in love with}} Bianca. In the following weeks, Bianca and Marissa start dating, much to JR's fury, and discuss moving in together.|$|E

25|$|The Sautrāntika school ('those {{who rely}} on the sutras') {{rejected}} {{the status of the}} Abhidharma as being Buddhavacana (word of the Buddha), they held it was the work of different monks after his death, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the reason different Abhidharma schools varied widely in their doctrines.|$|R
25|$|In an {{interview}} with the School for Communication and Journalism at the University of Southern California in 2010, Chao expressed his opinions about topics such as the effects of economic globalization on social inequality. He explained how he believes that the global market is causing social inequality, and how issues in education and immigration are connected to this. In this interview he expressed a worry that mafias are the greatest threat to democracy <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> already evident in certain places, like Russia and Mexico. He stated that this is one reason that he is for the legalization of drugs such as Marijuana - he explained that mafias are making capital off of the distribution of illegal drugs which gives them more economic power, thus making it easier for them to potentially overthrow governments.|$|E
25|$|The {{trial of}} Socrates is the central, unifying event of Plato's dialogues. Because of this, Apology {{is among the}} most {{frequently}} read of his works. In the Apology, Socrates tries to dismiss rumors that he is a sophist and defends himself against charges of disbelief in the gods and corruption of the young. Socrates insists that long-standing slander will be the real cause of his demise, and says the legal charges are essentially false. Socrates famously denies being wise, and explains how his life as a philosopher was launched by the Oracle at Delphi. He says that his quest to resolve the riddle of the oracle put him at odds with his fellow man, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the reason he has been mistaken for a menace to the city-state of Athens.|$|E
25|$|Abrictosaurus {{is usually}} {{considered}} the most basal {{member of the family}} Heterodontosauridae. Lycorhinus and Heterodontosaurus both had high-crowned cheek teeth, which overlapped each other in the jaw, forming a continuous chewing surface analogous to those of Cretaceous hadrosaurids. Abrictosaurus had more widely separated cheek teeth, with lower crowns, more similar to other early ornithischians. It has been suggested that Abrictosaurus lacked tusks <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> another primitive feature. However, caniniforms were clearly present on one of the two specimens of Abrictosaurus. The upper caniniform measured 10.5millimeters (0.4inches) high, while the lower reached 17mm (0.67in). These caniniforms were serrated only on the anterior surface, unlike those of Lycorhinus and Heterodontosaurus, which were serrated on both anterior and posterior edges. Abrictosaurus also had smaller, less powerful forelimbs than Heterodontosaurus and one fewer phalanx bone in both the fourth and fifth digits of the forelimb.|$|E
25|$|Upon declassification, the {{documents}} were used {{contend that the}} British had supported the slaughter <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> done in three ways: encouragement of the killing; giving the Indonesian military a free hand by furnishing assurances {{that there would be}} no British intervention while PKI was being crushed; and propaganda operations.|$|R

25|$|Given the city's central {{position}} in both Israeli nationalism and Palestinian nationalism, the selectivity required to summarize more than 5,000 years of inhabited history is often influenced by ideological bias or background (see Historiography and nationalism). For example, the Jewish periods of the city's history {{are important to}} Israeli nationalists, whose discourse states that modern Jews descend from the Israelites and Maccabees, while the Islamic periods of the city's history are important to Palestinian nationalists, whose discourse suggests that modern Palestinians descend from all the different peoples who {{have lived in the}} region. As a result, both sides claim the history of the city has been politicized by the other in order to strengthen their relative claims to the city, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> borne out by the different focuses the different writers place on the various events and eras in the city's history.|$|E
25|$|These {{studies suggest}} {{that men and women}} are {{different}} in terms of sexual arousal patterns <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> also reflected in how their genitals react to sexual stimuli of both genders or even to non-human stimuli. Sexual orientation has many dimensions (attractions, behavior, identity), of which sexual arousal is the only product of sexual attractions which can be measured at present with some degree of physical precision. Thus, the fact that women are aroused by seeing non-human primates having sex does not mean that women's sexual orientation includes this type of sexual interest. Some researchers argue that women's sexual orientation depends less on their patterns of sexual arousal than men's and that other components of sexual orientation (like emotional attachment) {{must be taken into account}} when describing women's sexual orientations. In contrast, men's sexual orientations tend to be primarily focused on the physical component of attractions and, thus, their sexual feelings are more exclusively oriented according to sex.|$|E
25|$|Synthetic ikaite was {{discovered}} {{in the nineteenth century}} in a study by Pelouze.

Cold water is certainly required for formation, and nucleation inhibitors like phosphate ions for the growth of anhydrous calcium carbonate phases, such as calcite, aragonite, and vaterite probably aid its formation and preservation. It is thought that perhaps the structure of calcium carbonate in a concentrated aqueous solution also consists of an ion pair, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> why ikaite readily nucleates at low temperatures, outside of its thermodynamic stability range. When removed from its natural cold water environment, ikaite rapidly disintegrates into monohydrocalcite or anhydrous calcium carbonate phases and water, earning the nickname of the melting mineral.|$|E
