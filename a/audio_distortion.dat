50|$|Aarktica was {{conceived}} {{in the winter}} of 1998 with DeRosa's permanent loss of hearing in one ear as a distraction from his other musical interests. As his hearing loss became less of a distraction and more of a new way of listening, Aarktica became a means to execute the soundtrack of the life in mono now thrust upon him. One of <b>audio</b> <b>distortions,</b> aural hallucinations and a reliance on painkillers.

50|$|Because {{measured}} <b>audio</b> <b>distortion</b> {{is higher}} in electromechanical components such as microphones, turntables, tonearms, phono cartridges, and loudspeakers than in purely electronic components such as preamplifiers and power amplifiers, objectivists generally do not accept that very subtle differences in the latter can have an appreciable effect on the perceived quality of reproduced sound.|$|E
5000|$|With {{the advent}} of digital {{recording}} in the late 1970s, many mastering ideas changed. Previously, creating new masters meant incurring an analogue generational loss; in other words, copying a tape to a tape meant reducing the signal-to-noise ratio. This means {{how much of the}} original intended [...] "good" [...] information is recorded against faults added to the recording {{as a result of the}} technical limitations of the equipment used (noise, e.g. tape hiss, static, etc.). Although noise reduction techniques exist, they also increase other <b>audio</b> <b>distortions</b> such as azimuth shift, wow and flutter, print-through and stereo image shift.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{a method}} of applying non-linear processing and effects to multi-point spatial distributions of sound spectra. The technique is based on previous research by the author on non-linear spatial distributions of spectra, that is, timbre spatialisation in the frequency domain. One of the primary applications here is the further elaboration of timbre spatialisation in the frequency domain to account for distance cues incorporating loudness attenuation, reverb, and filtration. Further to this, the same approach may also give rise to more non-linear distributions of processing and effects across multi-point spatial distributions such as <b>audio</b> <b>distortions</b> and harmonic exciters, delays, and other such parallel processes used within a spatial context...|$|R
30|$|This {{was a key}} {{aspect of}} testing. The audio samples were {{subjected}} to various types of <b>audio</b> <b>distortions</b> {{that occur in the}} real world. The tests done included speed changes, pitch changes, tempo changes and the addition of noise to the audio samples. From research, Rublee et al. [9] proposed that using image processing techniques for audio identification had an advantage of robustness to distortions such as speed and pitch changes which algorithms such as Shazam was difficult to resist. This was also investigated from the results. The tests were done to test the ability of the two algorithms to accurately identify the query samples. The Shazam-based algorithm and the ORB prototype were tested, and the results were compared.|$|R
50|$|In this context, {{distortion}} {{refers to}} any kind of deformation of an output waveform compared to its input, usually clipping, harmonic distortion, or intermodulation distortion (mixing phenomena) caused by non-linear behavior of electronic components and power supply limitations. Terms for specific types of nonlinear <b>audio</b> <b>distortion</b> include: crossover distortion, slew-Induced Distortion (SID) and transient intermodulation (TIM).|$|E
50|$|Some {{users have}} {{reported}} a minor <b>audio</b> <b>distortion</b> with lower dosages. Higher dosages increase the polarity of the distortion. It {{is defined as}} being slightly lower in pitch and creating several different effects, such as pitch bend, volume distortion, and rate distortion. As with most DiPT psychedelics, music can become more dissonant and less harmonious. Users have also reported a visual distortion widely comparable to the hallucinogen LSD.|$|E

5000|$|Distortion {{in music}} is often {{intentionally}} {{used as an}} effect when applied to an electric guitar signal in styles of rock music such as heavy metal and punk rock (see also overdrive and distortion synthesis). Other forms of <b>audio</b> <b>distortion</b> that may be referred to are non-flat frequency response, compression, modulation, aliasing, quantization noise, wow and flutter from analog media such as vinyl records and magnetic tape. The human ear cannot hear phase distortion, except that it may affect the stereo imaging. (See also: Audio system measurements.) ...|$|E
50|$|In practice, the THDF is {{commonly}} used in <b>audio</b> <b>distortion</b> specifications (percentage THD); however, THD is a non-standardized specification and the results between manufacturers are not easily comparable. Since individual harmonic amplitudes are measured, it is required that the manufacturer disclose the test signal frequency range, level and gain conditions, and number of measurements taken. It is possible to measure the full 20-20 kHz range using a sweep (though distortion for a fundamental above 10 kHz is inaudible). For all signal processing equipment, except microphone preamplifiers, the preferred gain setting is unity. For microphone preamplifiers, standard practice is to use maximum gain.|$|E
5000|$|An {{advanced}} {{version of}} Varispeech—the Time Compressor 1200—was introduced in 1981. The device coupled audio time-compression with visual components, allowing broadcasters to show movies and recorded programs at an accelerated rate without <b>audio</b> <b>distortion.</b> Programming and advertisements {{could be made}} to fit time slots without cutting. Technicians referred to this process as [...] "lexiconning." [...] Lexicon CEO Ron Noonan described the technology avoiding the [...] "tyranny of scissors." [...] The device was also promoted for creative uses, such as heightening excitement in a TV program or news broadcast by speeding up time. Lexicon's Time Compressor Model 1200 received an Emmy in 1984 from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences for its technical contributions to editing.|$|E

30|$|The {{remainder}} {{of this paper is}} organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the basic principles of MPEG- 1 Layer III, bit stream data format, the concept of Zernike moment, and its effectiveness as a robust audio compressed domain feature. Section 3 details the steps of deriving MDCT low-order Zernike moment-based audio fingerprint and the searching strategy. Experimental results on retrieval hit rate under various <b>audio</b> signal <b>distortions</b> are given in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 concludes this paper and points out some possible ways for future work.|$|R
25|$|However, {{in order}} for a {{receiver}} to reproduce the transmitted <b>audio</b> without <b>distortion,</b> it must be tuned to exactly the same frequency as the transmitter. Since this is difficult to achieve in practice, SSB transmissions can sound unnatural, and if the error in frequency is great enough, it can cause poor intelligibility. In order to correct this, a small amount of the original carrier signal can be transmitted so that receivers with the necessary circuitry to synchronize with the transmitted carrier can correctly demodulate the audio. This mode of transmission is called reduced-carrier single-sideband.|$|R

50|$|The signal {{strength}} of radio waves decreases the farther they travel from the transmitter, so {{the range of}} a system depends {{on the power of}} the transmitter and the sensitivity of the receiver. AM broadcast band radio waves travel as ground waves which follow the contour of the Earth, so AM radio stations can be reliably received at hundreds of miles distance. Due to their higher frequency, FM band radio signals do not travel far beyond the visual horizon; limiting reception distance to about 40 miles (64 km), and can be blocked by hills between the transmitter and receiver. However FM radio is less susceptible to interference from radio noise (RFI, sferics, static) and has higher fidelity; better frequency response and less <b>audio</b> <b>distortion,</b> than AM. So in many countries serious music is only broadcast by FM stations, and AM stations specialize in radio news, talk radio, and sports.|$|E
5000|$|Another song, [...] "Being Born", {{was being}} worked on concurrently.

The [...] "let me in the sound" [...] chant from the song [...] "Get on Your Boots" [...] was edited into the [...] "Fez" [...] section at a low volume, serving as the song's opening lyric. By June 2008, the song was almost finished.|$|E
30|$|Audio {{identification}} via fingerprint {{has been}} an active research field for years. However, most previously reported methods work on the raw audio format {{in spite of the}} fact that nowadays compressed format audio, especially MP 3 music, has grown into the dominant way to store music on personal computers and/or transmit it over the Internet. It will be interesting if a compressed unknown audio fragment could be directly recognized from the database without decompressing it into the wave format at first. So far, very few algorithms run directly on the compressed domain for music information retrieval, and most of them take advantage of the modified discrete cosine transform coefficients or derived cepstrum and energy type of features. As a first attempt, we propose in this paper utilizing compressed domain auditory Zernike moment adapted from image processing techniques as the key feature to devise a novel robust audio identification algorithm. Such fingerprint exhibits strong robustness, due to its statistically stable nature, against various <b>audio</b> signal <b>distortions</b> such as recompression, noise contamination, echo adding, equalization, band-pass filtering, pitch shifting, and slight time scale modification. Experimental results show that in a music database which is composed of 21, 185 MP 3 songs, a 10 -s long music segment is able to identify its original near-duplicate recording, with average top- 5 hit rate up to 90 % or above even under severe <b>audio</b> signal <b>distortions.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Drug {{injection}} {{by turning}} the drug into a solution provides the highest blood levels of drug in the shortest amount of time. Subjective effects not commonly shared with other methods of administration include a ringing in the ears moments after injection (usually when in excess of 120 milligrams) lasting 2 to 5 minutes including tinnitus and <b>audio</b> <b>distortion.</b> This is colloquially {{referred to as a}} [...] "bell ringer". In a study of cocaine users, the average time taken to reach peak subjective effects was 3.1 minutes. The euphoria passes quickly. Aside from the toxic effects of cocaine, there is also danger of circulatory emboli from the insoluble substances that may be used to cut the drug. As with all injected illicit substances, there is a risk of the user contracting blood-borne infections if sterile injecting equipment is not available or used. Additionally, because cocaine is a vasoconstrictor, and usage often entails multiple injections within several hours or less, subsequent injections are progressively more difficult to administer, which in turn may lead to more injection attempts and more consequences from improperly performed injection.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of the game takes place in abandoned areas (house, defunct mine, etc.), each with different objectives. Slender: The Arrival uses similar mechanics to its predecessor, The Eight Pages. The character is armed only with a flashlight. This limited defense forces a sense of helplessness, {{as the best way}} to survive in the game is to run whenever in danger. The Slender Man's behavior changes slightly between levels. In the first level, the Slender Man can be seen outside the window, and after going through the gate outside he can be seen on the top of hills well away from the player. In level two, he most often teleports off-screen or just out of the character's line of sight, but is capable of appearing {{directly in front of the}} player. It is observed that his motion centers around following the player, but consists largely of jumping from place to place, the inconvenience of which is increased as each of the eight pages are collected. His behavior is much the same as this in level four, except more active. In level three, he pursues much less aggressively, though is capable of teleporting directly in front of the player and ending the game. In this level, the main antagonist is a girl who chases the player (most often following her path directly, but has been seen teleporting. It is unknown whether this is a glitch or an in-game mechanic). The only way of subduing her is by focusing the flashlight (on its second setting) on her. While looking at the Slender Man, the camera succumbs to electronic distortions such as static, blurring, color spots, <b>audio</b> <b>distortion,</b> etc., which obstructs the player's vision unless facing away, and far enough from it. The player cannot pause while this occurs, to prevent them taking a break due to being frightened. When caught, the death or game over screen is also different; while in Slender: The Eight Pages, the player saw a white static background with Slender Man's faceless head, the one for Slender: The Arrival is black, with an overhead-lit and color-distorted hue and less static.There are also new choices in difficulty (which must first be unlocked by completing the game once) being easy, normal, and hardcore. The differences being that hardcore allows the flashlight to run out, enemies are more aggressive and the player's stamina runs out quickly. Easy has infinite flashlight, a great deal of stamina, and the enemies are not very aggressive.|$|E

30|$|At present, it is {{difficult}} to quantitatively compare with other algorithms because different datasets or even different evaluation measures are used. It is also unrealistic to precisely reimplement these methods {{due to the lack of}} adequate details. In fact, one important task of our work is to collect enough songs (21, 185 songs in the experiment) and queries (296.590 distorted queries) under various distortions (13 kinds of <b>audio</b> signal <b>distortions)</b> so that the experimental results are more convincing. Since this dataset is much larger and more comprehensive than those used in the cited references, the source codes will be published to the research community and serve as a baseline system.|$|R

40|$|This circuit aims {{to distort}} an audio signal input {{in a novel}} and aesthetically {{pleasing}} manner. When {{it comes to the}} timbre of a note, even harmonics generally sound better than odd harmonics. Most forms of <b>audio</b> signal <b>distortion</b> (usually for electric guitar) primarily add odd harmonics to a signal, as this is easily accomplished by clipping the waveform. This project instead utilizes a signal multiplier in a feedback loop, with one multiplier input coming from the circuit’s input, and the other from the multiplier’s own output. This process creates even harmonics. A delay line is placed in the loop, adding complexity to the sound. The circuit as a whole consists entirely of analog solid-state electronics...|$|R
