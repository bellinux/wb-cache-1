When a delivery woman arrived at 9:14p.m., there was no <b>answer</b> <b>at</b> the door, and no one answered when the restaurant called Weissman's cell phone.|$|E

She was fined 1000 marks for having {{refused to take}} the oath ex officio, and £500 for having harboured the secret press. It was also ordered that she be imprisoned during the Queen's pleasure, although no records are extant documenting her further imprisonment.|$|E

Rasmussen's sister also called without <b>answer.</b> <b>At</b> noon, two men, who the neighbor believed were gardeners in the compound, gave her and her husband a purse they had found that turned out to be Rasmussen's. A maid cleaning a nearby unit said she heard something that sounded like two people fighting, and then something falling, at around 12:30p.m.|$|E

25|$|Since {{his death}} White has been {{described}} as a satyr. To answer this by saying that he was a great architect is not to <b>answer</b> <b>at</b> all…what is more important is that he was a most kindhearted, most considerate, gentle and manly man, who could no more have done the things attributed to him than he could have roasted a baby on a spit. Big in mind and in body, he was incapable of little meanness. He admired a beautiful woman as he admired every other beautiful thing God has given us; and his delight over one was as keen, as boyish, as grateful over any others.|$|E
25|$|From 1974 until 1999, {{the exam}} had 30 {{questions}} and was 90 minutes long, scoring 5 points for correct answers. Originally {{during this time}} period, 1 point was awarded for leaving an answer blank, however it was changed in the late 1980s to 2 points for omitted questions. When the exam was shortened {{as part of the}} 2000 rebranding, the value of a correct answer was increased to 6 points (keeping 150 as a perfect score). In 2001, the score of a blank was increased to 2.5 to penalize guessing. The 2007 exams were the first with only 1.5 points awarded for a blank, to discourage students from leaving a large number of questions blank in order to assure qualification for the AIME. For example, on the AMC 12, a student could advance with only 11 correct answers, presuming the remaining questions were left blank. Now, a student must <b>answer</b> <b>at</b> least 14 questions correctly to reach 100 points.|$|E
25|$|Further entries of the subject, {{or middle}} entries, occur {{throughout}} the fugue. They must state the subject or <b>answer</b> <b>at</b> {{least once in}} its entirety, and may also be heard {{in combination with the}} countersubject(s) from the exposition, new countersubjects, free counterpoint, or any of these in combination. It is uncommon for the subject to enter alone in a single voice in the middle-entries as in the exposition; rather, it is usually heard with {{at least one of the}} countersubjects and/or other free contrapuntal accompaniments. Middle-entries tend to occur at pitches other than the initial. As shown in the typical structure above, these are often closely related keys such as the relative dominant and subdominant, although the key structure of fugues varies greatly. In the fugues of J. S. Bach, the first middle-entry occurs most often in the relative major or minor of the work's overall key, and is followed by an entry in the dominant of the relative major or minor when the fugue's subject requires a tonal answer. In the fugues of earlier composers (notably Buxtehude and Pachelbel), middle entries in keys other than the tonic and dominant tend to be the exception, and non-modulation the norm. One of the famous examples of such non-modulating fugue occurs in Buxtehude's Praeludium (Fugue and Chaconne) in C, BuxWV 137.|$|E

500|$|Asch's {{conformity}} {{experiment was}} conducted using 123 male {{participants who were}} told that they would be part of an experiment in visual judgment. Each subject was put into a group with 5 to 7 confederates (people who knew the true aims of the experiment, but were introduced as participants to the naive [...] "real" [...] participant). The group was shown a card with a line on it, followed by another card with 3 lines on it labeled a, b, and c. The participants were then asked to say which line matched in length the line on the first card. Each line question was called a [...] "trial". The [...] "real" [...] participant answered last or penultimately. For the first two trials, the subject would feel at ease in the experiment, as he and the other [...] "participants" [...] gave the obvious, correct answer. However, after the fourth trial, all of the confederates respond with the clearly wrong <b>answer</b> <b>at</b> certain points such that in 12 of the 18 trials they all gave the wrong answer. The 12 trials in which the confederates answered incorrectly were the [...] "critical trials". [...] The participant could thus either ignore the majority and go with his own senses or he could go along with the majority and ignore the clearly obvious fact. The aim was to see whether the real participant would change his answer and respond {{the same way as the}} confederates or stick with what his eyes plainly told him.|$|E

500|$|The {{historian}} Bartolomé Mitre wrote Historia de Belgrano y de la Independencia Argentina (...) , whose scope expanded on {{the simple}} biography of Belgrano himself, and detailed instead the Argentine War of Independence as a whole. The work followed the Great Man theory, linking the {{success in the}} war of independence to the figure of Belgrano and his natal Buenos Aires. This book included as well the autobiography of Belgrano, which was discovered by Mitre. The book was criticised by contemporary Argentine authors, such as Dalmacio Vélez Sarsfield and Juan Bautista Alberdi, born in other provinces, and Vicente Fidel López. Vélez Sarsfield dismissed the Great Man theory and maintained that the work of the other provinces for the Argentine independence was as important as that of Buenos Aires. He criticised the work of Mitre at [...] "Rectificaciones históricas: General Belgrano, General Güemes" [...] (Historical rectifications: General Belgrano, General Güemes) which dealt with Martín Miguel de Güemes as well, and Mitre would <b>answer</b> <b>at</b> [...] "Estudios históricos sobre la Revolución de Mayo: Belgrano y Güemes" [...] (Historical studies about the May Revolution: Belgrano and Güemes). Both books were written in 1864. Vicente López provided a biography of Belgrano from a different angle, his book was [...] "Debate histórico, refutaciones a las comprobaciones históricas sobre la Historia de Belgrano" [...] (Historical debate, rebuttals to the historical checkings about the history of Belgrano), and Mitre replied with [...] "Nuevas comprobaciones sobre historia argentina" [...] (New checkings about the history of Argentina). López considered history as an art form, and Mitre considered it a science, rejecting historical narrations that could not be backed by primary sources. These disputes about Belgrano are considered the starting point of the Historiography of Argentina. Historiographical studies of Manuel Belgrano are currently held by the Belgranian National Institute.|$|E

2500|$|A {{property}} {{of a theory}} or logical system weaker than decidability is semidecidability.

A logical system is semidecidable if there is an effective method for generating theorems (and only theorems) such that every theorem will eventually be generated. This is different from decidability because in a semidecidable system there may be no effective procedure for checking that a formula is not a theorem.|$|E

Even more difficult are the undecidable problems, such as the halting problem.
