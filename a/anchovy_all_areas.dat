50|$|Christmas Eve {{dinner is}} usually the time when all family membersjoin. It is {{typically}} done with spaghetti alle vongole followed by capitone fritto and baccalà fritto (deep fried eel and stockfish); as a side-dish there is the , a salad made with steamed cauliflower, giardiniera, spicy and sweet peppers (pupaccelle), olives and <b>anchovies,</b> <b>all</b> dressed with oil and vinegar.|$|R
50|$|Quite {{distinct}} from the classic Café de Paris sauce are various compound butters {{commonly referred to as}} Café de Paris butter. These typically contain a mixture of herbs, spices, and other condiments such as mustard, marjoram, dill, rosemary, tarragon, paprika, capers, chives, curry powder, parsley, shallot, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, and <b>anchovies,</b> <b>all</b> whipped into the butter. The resulting compound butter is shaped into a roll using aluminium foil and chilled. When the dish is served, a piece of the butter is sliced off and allowed to melt on the hot meat.|$|R
5000|$|Mom's sons Walt, Larry, and Igner conspire {{with the}} head of Pamela Anderson to steal Fry's ATM card and PIN. They tranquilize Fry and fool him into believing it is still the year 2000, using a crude mock-up of Panucci's to make him think he fell asleep on the job. Anderson orders a cheese pizza and a large soda, whereupon Fry {{inadvertently}} reveals his PIN as he rings up the total, which was $10.77. Walt, Larry, and Igner empty Fry's bank account, and except for the <b>anchovies,</b> <b>all</b> of his 20th century artifacts are repossessed.|$|R

50|$|Fish can be obligate or facultative shoalers. Obligate shoalers, such as tunas, {{herrings}} and <b>anchovy,</b> spend <b>all</b> {{of their}} time shoaling or schooling, and become agitated if separated from the group. Facultative shoalers, such as Atlantic cod, saiths and some carangids, shoal {{only some of the}} time, perhaps for reproductive purposes.|$|R
40|$|In {{the absence}} of the {{availability}} of Age Length Keys for anchovy catch data, assumptions about the age composition of the anchovy catches are needed. Previous assessments and management procedures have been based upon the assumption that <b>all</b> <b>anchovy</b> caught from April to October were recruits (0 -year-olds), while <b>all</b> <b>anchovy</b> caught from November to March were 1 -year-olds, with 2 -year-old and older fish not appearing in the catches at all. These assumptions were based upon the life-history characteristics of anchovy and general fishing patterns (De Oliveira 2003). This document considers whether a (monthly varying) cut-off length could instead be used to split the anchovy catch into juveniles and adults (1 year-olds only) for each month of the year...|$|R
