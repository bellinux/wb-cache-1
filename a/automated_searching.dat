40|$|We {{investigate}} a Web information structuring mechanism called lightweight deductive databases. Lightweight deductive databases enable more sophisticated <b>automated</b> <b>searching,</b> extraction, and processing, and can facilitate agent-based programming. We also explore how these deductive databases benefit from being distributed on the Web. 1 Introduction Our {{aim is to}} enhance the Web with information which is more susceptible to sophisticated <b>automated</b> <b>searching,</b> extraction, and processing. Such information needs to be stored in a structured form, and be sufficiently high-level (or abstract) to be programmable, while remaining readable. An interesting candidate as a representation formalism is logic programming [22]. Logic programming is based on mathematical logic, where computation is treated as deduction from a set of axioms or rules. Logic programming provides a uniform means for representing data and computations, is declarative (compared to imperative languages), and has a solid sema [...] ...|$|E
