50|$|A <b>studio</b> <b>{{audience}}</b> is {{an audience}} {{present for the}} filming of {{all or part of}} a television program, or to a smaller extent, radio programs. The primary purpose of the <b>studio</b> <b>audience</b> is to provide applause and/or laughter to the program's soundtrack (as opposed to canned laughter). Additionally, live <b>studio</b> <b>audiences</b> produce an energy from which the actors can feed off of, as well as push them to perform {{to the best of their}} abilities. Unlike relying on the ideal chuckles that a laugh track consistently provides, actors have to work for the laughs. A <b>studio</b> <b>audience</b> can also provide volunteers, a visual backdrop and discussion participants. On some game shows, contestants are taken from the <b>studio</b> <b>audience,</b> such as with The Price Is Right.|$|R
