Kraus's followers saw in him an infallible authority who would do <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> those he supported. Kraus considered posterity his ultimate audience, and reprinted Die Fackel in volume form {{years after it was}} first published.|$|E
25|$|After {{the killing}} of Husayn ibn Ali in Karbala, Kufans were regretful and blamed {{themselves}} for not having <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> the Imam. Following these emotions the first uprising was begun {{by a group of}} Shia of Kufa that {{came to be known as}} Tawwabin. The uprising started under leadership of five followers of Ali ibn Abi Talib, father of Husayn ibn Ali, with the following of one hundred of Kufa's people. They held the first meeting in the house of Sulayman ibn Surad Khuzai, one of the Sahabah of prophet of Islam, Muhammad, in 61 AH. In this meeting Sulayman was elected as the leader of uprising. Also, they decided to remain secret their uprising. This uprising remained secret until 65 AH. One of the reasons that is narrated for absence of Sulayman in battle of Karbala is he was imprisoned by Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad during that battle.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{also argued}} that when people {{participate}} in Twitter activism they don't feel the need <b>to</b> do <b>anything</b> else <b>to</b> <b>help</b> the effort. In an article for Newuniversity.org, Alex Guardado argues that after contributing their say, people just [...] "continue on with their day, liking other posts or retweeting." [...] Some may {{think of themselves as}} activists while never bothering to attend a single rally or extend their message beyond their Twitter fan base. Fourth-wave feminism can therefore get a reputation as being lazy.|$|R
25|$|The {{scheme was}} opposed during the {{consultation}} phase by {{a range of}} stake holders: The Freight Transport Association proposed an alternative scheme, reliant on a replacement cycle of vehicles, with lorries over 8 years old being liable, with higher years for other vehicles. They also stated that the standards were different from the forthcoming Euro5 requirements as well suggesting the scheme did not do <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> reduce CO2 emissions. The Road Haulage Association opposed the scheme, stating the costs to hauliers and benefits to the environment did not justify its introduction. Schools and St.John Ambulance have {{expressed concern about the}} additional costs that the scheme will bring them, particularly in light of the restricted budgets they operate under. London First, a business organisation, criticised aspects of the scheme with relation to the categorisation of vehicles, but supported the principle. The scheme has been supported by the British Lung Foundation and the British Heart Foundation.|$|E

2500|$|A {{spokesman}} for the Canadian Taxpayers Federation has criticized the CAW's [...] "no-concession" [...] stance, saying that it only serves to strengthen the opposition to a taxpayer-funded bailout for the struggling Detroit Three automakers. The CTF further pointed out that [...] "It is especially difficult to understand anyone asking for government help that refuses to do <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> itself to begin with", since they [...] "fail to realize they've existed at the substantial largesse of taxpayers for decades". Kelly McParland, {{a columnist for the}} National Post, has suggested that [...] "if he won't give anything, he and his members are likely to lose everything." [...] He also said that the problem facing the North American auto industry was borne equally by management and labour alike, criticizing labour for building up pay and benefits for themselves that was as unsustainable as it was enviable, while attacking management for its short-term strategy of selling gas-guzzling trucks and sales tactics (price cuts, rebates, free gas and cash-back schemes).|$|E
