5|$|On December 24, 2014, the PTC {{announced}} it was going forward with plans to replace the Allegheny Mountain Tunnel. Six options are being considered, three of which would include building bypasses via rock blasting (like what {{was done with the}} Laurel Hill Tunnel) while the other three would include boring two new tunnels, presumably three lanes each to accommodate the PTC's long-term plans to widen the entire mainline turnpike to six lanes except at the existing tunnels. If the PTC goes through with building new tunnels, the existing Allegheny Mountain Tunnels would be shut down. Although the projected costs for building a bypass would be {{less than half of the}} projected costs to bore new tunnels (as well as $3 million in <b>annual</b> <b>maintenance</b> on each tunnel), the aforementioned hunting group opposes the bypass options. Funding has not been identified for the project, which would open to traffic in a best-case scenario in the early 2020s.|$|E

At this point a dispute broke out over who would be responsible for the maintenance of the park. The £5,000 offer from the Treasury was conditional upon the CPF reassigning to the Post Office the £200 <b>annual</b> <b>maintenance</b> grant that it currently gave to St Botolph's Aldersgate; the CPF maintained that it was happy to do so on condition that the Post Office maintain the park in place of St Botolph's Aldersgate, but that the Post Office was unwilling to do so. With all parties unable to agree on responsibility for maintenance, on 19 February 1898 the Treasury withdrew its offer altogether, leaving the appeal £5,000 short.|$|E

5|$|The {{financing}} plan involved {{public and private}} funding. At the time, the city planned to pay $75million for the acquisition {{of the land and}} construction of the stadium project. However, a 2017 audit revealed that it had actually paid $91million after accounting for additional costs associated with the expedited schedule and infrastructure work around the project site. The stadium is owned by the city and is leased to the team for 30years, until 2045. The Sounds ownership group spent $50million on a new, mixed-use and retail development next to the facility. The construction of two apartment buildings with retail space beyond the left field wall is scheduled to be completed in early 2018. North of the site, Embrey Development Corp. built a privately funded apartment complex called The Carillon. The city's original $75million planned expenditure resulted in taking on $4.3million in annual debt, paid for by five city revenue streams: an annual $700,000 Sounds' lease payment, $650,000 in stadium-generated sales tax revenue, $750,000 in property taxes from the Sounds development, $675,000 in property taxes from the Embrey development, and $520,000 in tax increment financing. The additional overage was paid with existing Metro capital funds. The city pays $345,000 for <b>annual</b> <b>maintenance</b> of the stadium.|$|E

Both major candidates in the 2006 gubernatorial election, Democrat and eventual victor Eliot Spitzer and Republican John Faso, had pledged to remove the tolls on I-190 if elected.

25|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, {{industrialist}} Andrew Carnegie began funding dozens of public libraries in Pennsylvania. In 1901 the Carnegie Corporation received plans from the Easton Library Association asking for a donation for a new building to be constructed on Church Street. The committee sent plans for a two story 90 x 70 square foot building of Modern Renaissance architecture style on the best available piece of property in town, an old graveyard no longer in use. Included in the plans were a fireproof vault for the protection of books of rare and historic value, and an auditorium with a seating capacity of 400 to 500 people. The final building proposal would be large enough to house 34,500 volumes. After reviewing the plans Carnegie donated $50,000 under the condition that the citizens of Easton provide land for the construction of the library, and allocate a $5,000 <b>annual</b> <b>maintenance</b> and upkeep fee through the city government.

To meet these requirements, the highway would be lowered, with some sections below-grade.
