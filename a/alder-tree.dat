40|$|Plants are {{adapted to}} an oxygen supply of their rhizoms and roots {{buried in the}} {{anaerobic}} sediments of lakes or in the soil of wetland plains. A spongy tissue in the roots of <b>alder-trees</b> and the aerenyma formation in the aquatic vascular macrophytes facilitate the air movement throughout these plants and {{make it possible for}} O 2 to travel long distances from the atmosphere to the submerged parts of the plant. The higher water solubility of CO 2 leads to a pressure decrease in the intercellular system of the dissimilating tissues. The created pressure difference initiates an air stream throughout the plant competing with the O 2 supply by diffusion. (IFU...|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that oxygen {{according to the}} gradient of its partial pressure {{from the surface of}} the plants into the heterotrophic tissues through the intercellular spaces. The present experiment show evidence of an additional manifold higher oxygen supply due to a gas transport in leaved as well as leafless trees of Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertner. This gas transport is directed from the stems to the roots. It is driven by a thermo-osmotic pressurisation within the air space system of the stems, resulting from temperature gradients up to 3. 6 K between the stem and the ambient air following the absorption of light energy by th brownish pigments of the bark. This gas phase phenomena appears to enable the <b>alder-trees</b> to survive and grow in wet soil resulting from a high water table or in waterlogged soil. (IFU...|$|R

60|$|Short as was {{the time}} since the snow had cleared off the ground, spring had come in with marvellous rapidity. The grass was already well-nigh knee-deep, and flowers of various kinds were in full bloom. Where the ground was {{comparatively}} bare of grass, it was studded with the yellow blossoms of wild heart's-ease, and amongst some stunted <b>alder-trees</b> Godfrey found a dwarf rose already in bud, and wild onions and wild rhubarb in flower. Then he came upon a broad expanse of a shrub that looked to him like a rhododendron, with a flower with a strong aromatic scent. Several times he heard the call of a cuckoo. On a patch of sand there were some wild anemones in blossom. Godfrey pulled a bulb of wild onion, cut off a slice and tasted it. It was similar in flavour to the cultivated plant, but very sharp and acrid. However he set to work, and pulled up several dozen bulbs. They were small, not exceeding {{the size of a}} radish, but they would be very valuable, as one of them chopped fine would be sufficient to give a savour to a whole goose.|$|R
60|$|And I heard several horses {{galloping}} to and fro, {{with the}} kind purpose, doubtless, of executing these denunciations. I was immediately awakened {{to the sense of}} my situation, and to the certainty that armed men, having no restraint whatever on their irritated and inflamed passions, would probably begin by shooting or cutting me down, and afterwards investigate the justice of the action. Impressed by this belief, I leaped from my horse, and turning him loose, plunged into a bush of <b>alder-trees,</b> where, considering the advancing obscurity of the night, I thought there was little chance of my being discovered. Had I been near enough to the Duke to have invoked his personal protection, I would have done so; but he had already commenced his retreat, and I saw no officer on the left bank of the river, of authority sufficient to have afforded protection, in case of my surrendering myself. I thought there was no point of honour which could require, in such circumstances, an unnecessary exposure of my life. My first idea, when the tumult began to be appeased, and the clatter of the horses' feet was heard less frequently in the immediate vicinity of my hiding-place, was to seek out the Duke's quarters when all should be quiet, and give myself up to him, as a liege subject, who had nothing to fear from his justice, and a stranger, who had every right to expect protection and hospitality. With this purpose I crept out of my hiding-place, and looked around me.|$|R
60|$|September 18th.--How the summer-time flits away, {{even while}} {{it seems to}} be {{loitering}} onward, arm in arm with autumn! Of late I have walked but little over the hills and through the woods, my leisure being chiefly occupied with my boat, which I have now learned to manage with tolerable skill. Yesterday afternoon I made a voyage alone up the North Branch of Concord River. There was a strong west-wind blowing dead against me, which, together with the current, increased by the height of the water, made {{the first part of the}} passage pretty toilsome. The black river was all dimpled over with little eddies and whirlpools; and the breeze, moreover, caused the billows to beat against the bow of the boat, with a sound like the flapping of a bird's wing. The water-weeds, where they were discernible through the tawny water, were straight outstretched by the force of the current, looking as if they were forced to hold on to their roots with all their might. If for a moment I desisted from paddling, the head of the boat was swept round by the combined might of wind and tide. However, I toiled onward stoutly, and, entering the North Branch, soon found myself floating quietly along a tranquil stream, sheltered from the breeze by the woods and a lofty hill. The current, likewise, lingered along so gently that it was merely a pleasure to propel the boat against it. I never could have conceived that there was so beautiful a river-scene in Concord as this of the North Branch. The stream flows through the midmost privacy and deepest heart of a wood, which, as if but half satisfied with its presence, calm, gentle, and unobtrusive as it is, seems to crowd upon it, and barely to allow it passage; for the trees are rooted on the very verge of the water, and dip their pendent branches into it. On one side there is a high bank, forming the side of a hill, the Indian name of which I have forgotten, though Mr. Thoreau told it to me; and here, in some instances, the trees stand leaning over the river, stretching out their arms as if about to plunge in headlong. On the other side, the bank is almost on a level with the water; and there the quiet congregation of trees stood with feet in the flood, and fringed with foliage down to its very surface. Vines here and there twine themselves about bushes or aspens or <b>alder-trees,</b> and hang their clusters (though scanty and infrequent this season) so that I can reach them from my boat. I scarcely remember a scene of more complete and lovely seclusion than the passage of the river through this wood. Even an Indian canoe, in olden times, could not have floated onward in deeper solitude than my boat. I have never elsewhere had such an opportunity to observe how much more beautiful reflection is than what we call reality. The sky, and the clustering foliage on either hand, and the effect of sunlight as it found its way through the shade, giving lightsome hues in contrast with the quiet depth of the prevailing tints, --all these seemed unsurpassably beautiful when beheld in upper air. But on gazing downward, there they were, the same even to the minutest particular, yet arrayed in ideal beauty, which satisfied the spirit incomparably more than the actual scene. I am half convinced that the reflection is indeed the reality, the real thing which Nature imperfectly images to our grosser sense. At any rate, the disembodied shadow is nearest to the soul.|$|R
