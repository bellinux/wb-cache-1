5|$|DDT {{pollution}} in the environment was <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> decline of brown pelican populations in North America in the 1950s and 1960s. It entered the oceanic food web, contaminating and accumulating in several species, including one of the pelican’s primary food fish – the northern anchovy. Its metabolite DDE is a reproductive toxicant in pelicans and many other birds, causing eggshell thinning and weakening, and consequent breeding failure through the eggs being accidentally crushed by brooding birds. Since an effective ban {{on the use of}} DDT was implemented in the US in 1972, the eggshells of breeding brown pelicans there have thickened and their populations have largely recovered.|$|E

In the United States, Canada, and many western European countries, all shot used for waterfowl must now be non-toxic, and therefore may not contain any lead.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDue to bounded rationality, {{we cannot}} make {{decision}} rationally. Our cognitive information processing is conducted by System 1 or System 2. While System 2 {{requires us to}} conduct effortful, demanding and deliberate mental activities, System 1 operates quickly, automatically, without time consuming, and intuitively {{with little or no}} efforts. Although heuristic approaches that we adopt when we have no time to deliberate are based on System 1, and are very simple and intuitive, such approaches constantly suffer from cognitive biases. In this study, using about 190 crucial accident analyses, it was explored how cognitive biases are include as <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> crucial accidents. It has been clarified that optimistic bias and loss aversion are more frequently observed in the range of this study. In conclusion, we are susceptible to cognitive biases, and never behave rationally. Due to such property (irrationality), we repeatedly commit similar error as we see in the statistical analysis of 190 cases of crucial accidents. This means that how we actually behave (irrationality) is more important than how we should behave (rationality) ...|$|R

Interferon-γ mediates immunity to mycobacteria and rare mutations in the interferon-γ receptor- 1 gene (IFNGR 1) result in increased susceptibility to mycobacterial infection, including TB, in affected families.

In accidents, damage can be reduced by use of seat belts, child safety seats and motorcycle helmets, and presence of roll bars and airbags. Education programs exist to lower the number of crashes. In addition, changes to public policy and safety laws can be made; these include speed limits, seat belt and helmet laws, and road engineering practices.|$|E
5|$|The {{adult cattle}} egret has few predators, but birds or mammals may raid its nests, and chicks {{may be lost}} to starvation, calcium {{deficiency}} or disturbance from other large birds.

The cattle egret removes ticks and flies from cattle and consumes them. This benefits both species, but it has been implicated in the spread of tick-borne animal diseases.|$|E

In comparison, other species of grebes cover up their eggs when leaving the nest. Predation is usually not {{the primary cause of}} egg loss, with most nesting failures occurring after the chicks have hatched. <b>A</b> <b>major</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> this is the chilling of the young.|$|E
5|$|H. pylori is <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> certain {{diseases}} of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Rising antibiotic resistance increases the need to search for new therapeutic strategies; this might include prevention {{in the form of}} vaccination. Much work has been done on developing viable vaccines aimed at providing an alternative strategy to control H. pylori infection and related diseases, including stomach cancer. Researchers are studying different adjuvants, antigens, and routes of immunization to ascertain the most appropriate system of immune protection; however, most of the research only recently moved from animal to human trials. An economic evaluation of the use of a potential H. pylori vaccine in babies found its introduction could, at least in the Netherlands, prove cost-effective for the prevention of peptic ulcer and stomach cancer. A similar approach has also been studied for the United States.|$|E
