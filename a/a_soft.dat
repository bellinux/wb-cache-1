50|$|Mower is a Hardcore/Punk {{jazz band}} from San Diego, California {{formed in the}} early '90s. The band {{released}} their debut album Mower in 2003 on Suburban Noize Records. The band's alter ego Slower is <b>a</b> <b>softer</b> version of the band with more of <b>a</b> <b>softer</b> Jazz/Lounge punk sound.|$|R

5|$|The episode focuses upon a thirteen-year-old girl, Maria Jackson, {{discovering}} {{the existence of}} aliens.

5|$|The {{painting}} book displays Potter's willingness {{to exploit the}} commercial possibilities of her characters and tales. The purchaser was alerted {{to the existence of}} other Potter books on the inside front cover and directed to a list of books on the back cover. Other merchandise included sets of linen or silk placemats painted by Potter for friends with an abridged text and 12 of the illustrations. In 1910, Potter patented a design for <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> toy duck based on her model of Jemima in a Paisley handkerchief shawl and bonnet. <b>A</b> <b>soft</b> Jemima doll was manufactured by J. I. Farnell of Acton.|$|E

40|$|Are we {{heading for}} <b>a</b> <b>softer</b> Brexit after the Conservatives’ electoral setback? Piers Ludlow doubts it. There {{is little to}} suggest voters were warning Theresa May off a hard Brexit. The Cabinet {{reshuffle}} is unlikely to tip the balance, and even if she returns from Brussels with <b>a</b> <b>softer</b> deal {{it is far from}} clear that Labour would back it...|$|R
5|$|This small martin's {{flight is}} {{typically}} slow and leisurely, {{but it is}} capable of considerable speed when required. The calls {{are similar to those of}} the Eurasian crag martin and include <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> chi, chi contact call and a twittering song.|$|E
5|$|Ytterbium is <b>a</b> <b>soft,</b> {{malleable}} and ductile {{chemical element}} that displays a bright silvery luster when pure. It {{is a rare}} earth element, and it is readily dissolved by the strong mineral acids. It reacts slowly with cold water and it oxidizes slowly in air.|$|E
5|$|Actinium is <b>a</b> <b>soft,</b> silvery-white, radioactive, {{metallic}} element. Its estimated {{shear modulus}} {{is similar to}} that of lead. Owing to its strong radioactivity, actinium glows in the dark with a pale blue light, which originates from the surrounding air ionized by the emitted energetic particles. Actinium has similar chemical properties to lanthanum and other lanthanides, and therefore these elements are difficult to separate when extracting from uranium ores. Solvent extraction and ion chromatography are commonly used for the separation.|$|E

5|$|Barium is a {{chemical}} element with symbolBa and atomic number56. It {{is the fifth}} element in group 2 and is <b>a</b> <b>soft,</b> silvery alkaline earth metal. Because of its high chemical reactivity, barium is never found in nature as a free element. Its hydroxide, known in pre-modern history as baryta, does not occur as a mineral, but can be prepared by heating barium carbonate.|$|E
5|$|Barium is <b>a</b> <b>soft,</b> silvery-white metal, with {{a slight}} golden shade when ultrapure. The silvery-white color of barium metal rapidly vanishes upon {{oxidation}} in air yielding a dark gray oxide layer. Barium has a medium specific weight and good electrical conductivity. Ultrapure barium {{is very difficult to}} prepare, and therefore many properties of barium have not been accurately measured yet.|$|E
5|$|Being <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> metal, mercury forms {{very stable}} {{derivatives}} with the heavier chalcogens. Preeminent is mercury(II) sulfide, HgS, which occurs in nature as the ore cinnabar {{and is the}} brilliant pigment vermillion. Like ZnS, HgS crystallizes in two forms, the reddish cubic form and the black zinc blende form. Mercury(II) selenide (HgSe) and mercury(II) telluride (HgTe) are also known, these as well as various derivatives, e.g. mercury cadmium telluride and mercury zinc telluride being semiconductors useful as infrared detector materials.|$|E

5|$|Berkelium is <b>a</b> <b>soft,</b> silvery-white, {{radioactive}} metal. The berkelium-249 isotope emits low-energy {{electrons and}} thus is relatively safe to handle. It decays with a half-life of 330days to californium-249, which is a strong emitter of ionizing alpha particles. This gradual transformation is an important consideration when studying the properties of elemental berkelium and its chemical compounds, since the formation of californium brings not only chemical contamination, but also free-radical effects and self-heating from the emitted alpha particles.|$|E
5|$|Cadmium is <b>a</b> <b>soft,</b> malleable, ductile, bluish-white {{divalent}} metal. It {{is similar}} in many respects to zinc but forms complex compounds. Unlike most other metals, cadmium is resistant to corrosion and {{is used as a}} protective plate on other metals. As a bulk metal, cadmium is insoluble in water and is not flammable; however, in its powdered form it may burn and release toxic fumes.|$|E
5|$|Columbia is {{also known}} for its MKT Trail, a spur of the Katy Trail State Park, which allows foot and bike traffic across the city, and, conceivably, the state. It {{consists}} of <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> gravel surface for running and biking. Columbia also is preparing to embark on construction of several new bike paths and street bike lanes thanks to a $25 million grant from the federal government. The city is also served by American Airlines at the Columbia Regional Airport, the only commercial airport in mid-Missouri.|$|E
