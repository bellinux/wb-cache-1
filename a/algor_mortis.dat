50|$|<b>Algor</b> <b>mortis</b> (Latin: algor—coldness; mortis—of death), {{the second}} stage of death, is the change in body {{temperature}} post mortem, until the ambient temperature is matched. This is generally a steady decline, although if the ambient temperature is above the body temperature (such as in a hot desert), the change in temperature will be positive, as the (relatively) cooler body acclimates to the warmer environment. External factors can have a significant influence. <b>Algor</b> <b>mortis</b> also occurs when the body dies.|$|E
5000|$|... 1-2 days: Pallor Mortis, <b>Algor</b> <b>Mortis,</b> Rigor Mortis, and Livor Mortis are {{the first}} steps {{in the process of}} {{decomposition}} before the process of putrefaction.|$|E
5000|$|Among coroners {{and other}} investigators, such as {{homicide}} and forensic detectives, livor mortis {{is not considered}} an exact way to measure time of death, but instead {{is a way to}} approximate it. Livor mortis, along with <b>algor</b> <b>mortis,</b> rigor mortis, and practices such as forensic entomology are frequently combined by investigators to more accurately pinpoint the estimated time of death.|$|E
50|$|In {{forensic}} investigation, {{the time}} of occurrence of an event (such as time of death, time of incident) {{is one of the}} most important things to determine accurately as soon as possible. Sometimes this can only be estimated. Some indicators that investigators use are rigor mortis, livor mortis, <b>algor</b> <b>mortis,</b> clouding of the corneas, state of decomposition, presence/absence of purged fluids and level of tissue desiccation.|$|E
50|$|Transient {{evidence}} is frequently relied upon in {{the determination of}} time of death. The condition of rigor mortis begins to manifest after about 3 hours after death, and lasts about 72 hours. It then disappears as proteolytic enzymes from lysosomes break down the stiffness of the corpse. The reduction in internal temperature after death, {{a process known as}} <b>algor</b> <b>mortis,</b> {{can also be used to}} estimate demise.|$|E
5000|$|The fresh {{stage of}} {{decomposition}} is generally {{described as the}} period between the moment of death and when {{the first signs of}} bloat are apparent. [...] There are no outward signs of physical change, though internal bacteria have begun to digest organ tissues. [...] No odor is associated with the carcass. [...] Early post-mortem changes, used by pathologists as medical markers for early post-mortem interval estimations, have been described by Goff and include livor mortis, rigor mortis and <b>algor</b> <b>mortis.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Among {{those animals}} {{that have a}} heart, the [...] "fresh" [...] stage begins {{immediately}} after the heart stops beating. From the moment of death, the body begins cooling or warming to match {{the temperature of the}} ambient environment, during a stage called <b>algor</b> <b>mortis.</b> [...] Shortly after death, within three to six hours, the muscular tissues become rigid and incapable of relaxing, during a stage called rigor mortis. Since blood is no longer being pumped through the body, gravity causes it to drain to the dependent portions of the body, creating an overall bluish-purple discolouration termed livor mortis or, more commonly, lividity.|$|E
50|$|The other {{secretary}} reportedly {{spoke of}} the pope's back and feet still being warm when he lifted him. Even if the Pope had died in bed, Cornwell believes <b>algor</b> <b>mortis</b> would mean his corpse would have been externally cold {{by the time he}} was found (around 5.30 a.m., by which time rigor mortis had set in). There is dispute over this suggestion, since Cornwell also claims that the summer of 1978 saw a high air temperature in Rome that was behind the decision to embalm the Pope as soon as possible (see above). Cornwell's conclusion of rigor mortis onset also contradicts his conclusion that the Pope's corpse was manipulated into position (sitting up in bed, holding papers) after discovery.|$|E
5000|$|Putrefaction is {{the fifth}} stage of death, {{following}} pallor mortis, <b>algor</b> <b>mortis,</b> rigor mortis, and livor mortis. This process references the breaking down of a body of a human or animal post mortem (meaning after death). In broad terms, it {{can be viewed as}} the decomposition of proteins, and the eventual breakdown of the cohesiveness between tissues, and the liquefaction of most organs. This is caused by the decomposition of organic matter by bacterial or fungal digestion, which causes the release of gases that infiltrate the body's tissues, and leads to the deterioration of the tissues and organs. The approximate time it takes putrefaction to occur is dependent on various factors. Internal factors that affect the rate of putrefaction include the age at which death has occurred, the overall structure and condition of the body, the cause of death, and external injuries arising before or after death. External factors include environmental temperature, moisture and air exposure, clothing, burial factors, and light exposure.|$|E

30|$|By {{using the}} rate-of-change methodology, early TSD can be {{estimated}} {{on the basis of}} observational changes occur in human body after the death. The cooling of the body after death (<b>algor</b> <b>mortis),</b> the gradual stiffening of the body (rigor mortis) and the fixed pooling of the blood resulting in discoloration of the lower portions of the body (livor mortis) can be easily assessed with minimal instrumentation (Clark et al. 1997).|$|E
30|$|Since decades, many {{methods have}} been used to {{determine}} the PMI including physical, biochemical and entomological methods (Sato et al., 2015). The earliest changes after death (within the first 24  h postmortem) include the development and regression of rigor mortis, the progression of livor mortis and <b>algor</b> <b>mortis.</b> Although these methods are applied to assess the PMI in daily forensic work, there are still great inaccuracies and limitations (Pittner et al., 2016). Several days postmortem, forensic entomology has shown to provide valuable information about the time since death. Yet, this method is still affected by changes in weather conditions, and exposure of the body (Verma & Paul, 2013).|$|E

40|$|Decomposition is {{degradation}} process of a corpse into basic respective constituents macroscopically and microscopically by action of microorganisms, arthropods and scavengers. Post mortem changes could be separated into early post mortem changes (i. e. <b>algor</b> <b>mortis,</b> rigor mortis and livor mortis) and putrefaction stages of corpse. These changes function as suitable indicators for determination of post mortem interval (PMI). In this paper, {{different stages of}} post mortem changes, possible variations such as mummification and formation of adipocere and special circumstances such as burial condition is discussed. This article also refers to several arguments in the different texture of adipocere {{and the influence of}} different types of fabric in affecting the post mortem changes and formation of adipocere. This is largely due to the property of permeability and resistance of material against {{degradation process}}. Undeniably, decomposition process involves numerous potential variables including burial condition, presence of clothing, potential formation of adipocere and mummification. Hence, studies in forensic taphonomy combined with real case scenario are crucial in understanding the nature of decomposition and estimation of PMI with higher accuracy...|$|E
40|$|IDENTIFICATION Of CORPSES AND SKELETAL FINDINGS For a {{topic of}} my thesis I chose Identification of dead bodies and {{skeletal}} findings. This topic is one of issues which belong to criminal science. My work consists of eight chapters including the Introduction and Conclusion. In the beginning I described the basic terms of Forensic Science which relate to death as post-mortem changes, mummification and <b>algor</b> <b>mortis.</b> In the Chapter three I deal with a general procedure when a dead body occurs. In this part {{you can find the}} legal regulations of coroner's inquest, autopsy and search of premises. Next chapter is devoted to regulation of a medicine doctor's activity as an expert and following chapter describes exhumation procedure. Chapter six deals with identification process generally. Chapter seven describes particular methods of identification. The first method what I describe is forensic anthropology. This method use external features of a man for the identification process. These features are: sex, age, body height, DNA analysis or blood group. Then I define method of superprojection which use the skulk and photography of dead persons. With the technical progress this method use nowadays equipment of modern technique as special scanner or digital pictures. After that I define method of portrait [...] ...|$|E

To directly determine mortality and predation in the endangered western Steller sea lion Eumetopias jubatus, we deployed implanted, satellite-linked post-mortem data transmitters in 21 juveniles. Data recovered from 4 of 5 detected mortalities exhibited precipitous drops in ambient temperatures followed by immediate onset of transmissions (N = 3), or gradual cooling and delayed transmissions (N = 1). Precipitous drop data sets were classified as acute death at sea by trauma. A model to estimate <b>algor</b> <b>mortis</b> (body cooling) as a function of mass and ambient conditions was validated through simulations on 4 carcasses. Model outputs suggest that cooling rate masses can be qualitatively distinguished if well outside the prediction uncertainties. The observed gradual cooling rate was best described by a modeled mass one-sixth the animal’s mass at release, supporting the classification of the fourth event as acute death at sea by trauma. This suggests that at least 4 in 5 detected mortalities likely represent acute deaths at sea, probably due to predation. We conclude that precipitous drop events with immediate transmissions can be classified as acute death likely by predation, but gradual cooling events with delayed transmission should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. In 3 cases that provided both ante-mortem and post-mortem locations from external and implanted transmitters, respectively, these differed by less than 17 km, illustrating that this technique provides spatially explicit data of predation on individual sea lions...|$|E
40|$|Post mortem {{interval}} (PMI – {{the time}} elapsed since death and discovery) {{is important to}} medicolegal investigations. It helps to construct crucial time lines and assists with the identification of unknown persons by inclusion or exclusion of a suspect’s known movements. Accurate methodologies for establishing PMI are limited to about 48 -hours. Such methods involve use of increasing levels of potassium in vitreous humour, and <b>algor</b> <b>mortis.</b> This study is two-fold. Firstly, it explores the biomolecular changes in degrading porcine cartilage buried in soil environments and its potential to determine PMI in the crucial two days to two months period. Trotters were interred {{in a number of}} graves at two distinct locations exhibiting dissimilar soil environments. Weekly disinterments (for 6 weeks) resulted in dissection for cartilage samples which were processed for protein immunoblot analyses and cell vitality assays. Results demonstrate that aggrecan, a major structural proteoglycan, produces high (230 kDa) and low (38 kDa) molecular weight cross-reactive polypeptides (CRPs) within cartilage extracellular matrix. The 230 kDa CRP degrades in a reproducible manner irrespective of the different soil environments utilised. As PMI increases, aggrecan diminishes and degrades forming heterogeneous subpopulations with time. Immunodetection of aggrecan ceases when joint exposure to the soil environment occurs. At this time, aggrecan is metabolised by soil microbes. The molecular breakdown of cartilage proteoglycans has potential for use as a reliable indicator of PMI, irrespective of differing soil environments, beyond the 48 -hours period. Likewise, vitality assays also demonstrated viable chondrocytes for as long as 35 PM days. The second component of this study examined the fungal activity associated with trotters buried below ground. Results indicate that fungal growth was considerably influenced by soil chemistry and changes in the environment. Fungal colonisation did not demonstrate temporal patterns of succession. The results {{of this study indicate that}} cartilage has the potential to prolong PMI determination well beyond the current 48 - and 100 -hour limitations posed by various other soft tissue methods. Moreover, the long-term post mortem viability of chondrocytes presents an opportunity to explore DNA extraction from these cells for the purpose of establishing a positive identification for unidentified remains. On the contrary, the growth and colonisation patterns of post putrefactive fungi in relation to decomposing porcine trotters proved to be futile for estimating PMI. Therefore, fungi may not be a suitable candidate for evaluating PMI during the early phase fungal activity...|$|E
