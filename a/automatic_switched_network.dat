40|$|The {{growth of}} {{bandwidth}} demand for data traffic drives {{the evolution of}} the current transport networks towards the introduction of the <b>Automatic</b> <b>Switched</b> Optical <b>Network</b> (ASON). Introducing <b>automatic</b> <b>switching</b> capabilities in optical networks means designing and implementing control functionalities. Such as functionalities are hosted at the network Control Plane, and mainly consist of providing signalling and routing mechanisms distributed throughout the network. This paper addresses some issues still under discussion on the definition of a suitable control plane for optical core networks. Specifically, we deal with the routing protocol, which defines the distribution of topology information, the path selection and the association of nodes in a network; and with the routing mechanism, which allows selecting the path according to attributes of the connection requests and the available resources in the network. We also deal with the traffic engineering strategies used to optimise the use of these resources and give a quick view of future trends in Optical Networks.

50|$|ASTN (<b>Automatic</b> <b>Switched</b> Transport <b>Network)</b> allows traffic {{paths to}} be set up through a <b>switched</b> <b>network</b> automatically. The term ASTN replaces the term ASON (Automatically <b>Switched</b> Optical <b>Network)</b> and is often used interchangeably with GMPLS (Generalized MPLS). This is not {{completely}} correct as GMPLS is a family of protocols, but ASON/ASTN is an optical/transport network architecture. The requirements of the ASON/ASTN architecture can be satisfied using GMPLS protocols developed by the IETF or by GMPLS protocols that have been modified by the ITU. Furthermore, the GMPLS protocols are applicable to optical and non-optical (e.g., packet and frame) networks, and can be used in transport or client networks. Thus, GMPLS is a wider concept than ASTN.|$|R

The {{control plane}} {{has emerged as}} the key entity of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU-T) <b>Automatic</b> <b>Switched</b> Optical <b>Network</b> (ASON) architecture, {{enabling}} both soft-permanent and switched connection establishment. The fundamental control plane functional module is the Optical Connection Controller (OCC) which in turn, is divided in four sub-modules.

40|$|Abstract: Optical {{transport}} networks, {{based on}} wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) with <b>automatic</b> <b>switching</b> capabilities (ASON, <b>Automatic</b> <b>Switching</b> Optical <b>Networks)</b> {{appear as a}} potential solution {{to cope with the}} increasingly growth of Internet traffic demands. In {{spite of the fact that}} adaptive routing mechanisms based on global information performs better than the ones based on local information, they are only suitable for those networks where frequent network state changes are not expected. Therefore, assuming distributed lightpath control in this optical scenario, maintaining precise global network state information on each node is almost impossible. Many factors, such as non-negligible propagation delay, frequent state updates and hierarchical topology aggregation, can affect the precision of the global network state information. Thus, when the lightpath selection process is performed based on outdated routing information a connection blocking increment is produced. In this paper a new routing mechanism named BYPASS Based Optical Routing (BBOR) for reducin g the effects of selecting lightpaths under inaccurate network state information are suggested and evaluated by simulation. The BBOR mechanism is based on adding optical capabilities to the BYPASS Based Routing (BBR) mechanism already introduced by the authors in an IP/MPLS scenario...|$|R

This paper focuses {{in the context of the}} ASON control plane. In this context, an Optical NNI (O-NNI) has to be defined. For some time it seemed clear that such an O-NNI would be based on Generalised Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS). Nevertheless recently the idea of an O-NNI based on the ATM Private Network to Network Interface (PNNI) paradigm is wining partisans. In this paper a preliminary attempt to adapt the ATM PNNI protocol to be used as the new O-NNI will be done. In particular, this paper will be addressed to define an ATM PNNI based protocol to cope with the routing information exchange in an ASON. We call such a protocol Private Optical NNI (PONNI). We think that PONNI can be more appropriated for this purpose than the OSPF protocol, the one used in the GMPLS paradigm. The main reason for that is that, while OSPF has to be modified in order to achieve the capabilities needed to distribute both internal and external information on the available resources (e. g. remaining bandwidth, wavelengths, etc.), the PNNI has these capabilities by nature. 1...|$|R
40|$|Although the Optical Transport Network, {{based on}} {{technologies}} such as Wavelength Division Multiplexing and Optical Cross-Connects, offers tremendous transportation capacity, its management requires frequent manual intervention. However, as the traffic pattern offered to today's transport networks is subject to continuous changes due to the Internet traffic dominance, an optical transport network with a smart, automatic and real-time control system, denoted as Intelligent Optical <b>Network</b> (ION) or <b>Automatic</b> <b>Switched</b> Optical <b>Network</b> (ASON), is desired by network operators. Duly and correctly retrieving the changing traffic load information {{is a very important}} factor for the successful deployment of an ION. In this paper, we discuss the influence of the observation window size used for collecting the traffic load information, on the performance of an ION. By comparing the performance of an ION using different traffic observation window sizes, we show that a smaller observation window harms the network stability; while a too large observation window worsens the network reliability. We demonstrate that a suitable traffic observation window size improves the offered Quality of Service (QoS) by reconfiguring the logical layer network at the right time and in the right way...|$|R
40|$|Next {{generation}} <b>automatic</b> <b>switched</b> optical <b>networks</b> (ASON) show {{great promise}} {{in coping with}} increasing bandwidth demands, as they provide both on-demand bandwidth and improved switching flexibility. In a multi-layer data-centric networks such an ASON acts as a server layer and provides the topology for a client EP network. Multi-layer Traffic Engineering (MTE) enhances single-layer traffic engineering (i. e. adaptive routing) with the possibility to reconfigure the logical IP topology, utilizing the aforementioned optical flexibility in setting up and tearing down end-to-end lightpaths. To provide a robust network service, the multi-layer networks must be recoverable from different types of failures. Resilience mechanisms such as various forms of protection and restoration allow to recover from optical layer failures. In a multi-layer network however, some traffic will be forwarded through the IP layer routers, requiring a survivability scheme in this IP layer. This paper shows how MTE strategies that normally cope with changing traffic demands, {{can be used to}} provide this IP layer resilience. Ibis is done through diverting affected IP traffic and replacing failing optical lightpaths, effectively leading to a dynamic restoration scheme. We will evaluate and compare failure performance of different types of resilience mechanisms, based on an existing MTE strategy...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{progress}} has been made in the Generalized Multi–Protocol Label <b>Switching</b> (GMPLS) and <b>Automatic</b> <b>Switched</b> Optical <b>Networks</b> (ASON) standardizations. These technologies realize construction of large–scaled optical networks, interconnections among single–domain Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) networks, and direct communication over multi–domain WDM networks. Meanwhile, it is known that the topology of the Internet exhibits the power–law attribute. Since the topology of the Internet, which is constructed by interconnecting ASs, exhibits the power–law, there is a possibility that large–scale WDM networks, which are constructed by interconnecting WDM networks, will also exhibit the power–law attribute. One of the structural properties of a topology that adheres to the power–law is that most nodes have just a few links, although some have a tremendous number of them. Another property is that the average distance between nodes is smaller than in a mesh–like network. A natural question is how such a structural property performs in WDM networks. In this paper, we first investigate the property of the power–law attribute of physical topologies for WDM networks. We compare the performance of WDM networks with mesh–like and power–law topologies, and show that links connected to high–degree nodes are bottlenecks in power–law topologies. To relax this, we introduce a concept of virtual fiber, which consists of two or more fibers, and propose its configuration method to utilize wavelength resources more effectively. We compare performances of power–law networks with and without our method by computer simulations. The results show that our method reduces the blocking probabilities by more than one order of magnitude...|$|R

40|$|L (Logarithmic space) versus NL (Non-deterministic {{logarithmic}} space) {{is one of}} {{the great}} open problems in computational complexity theory. In the paper "Bounds on monotone <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> for directed connectivity", we separated monotone analogues of L and NL using a model called the <b>switching</b> <b>network</b> model. In particular, by considering inputs consisting of just a path and isolated vertices, we proved that any monotone <b>switching</b> <b>network</b> solving directed connectivity on N vertices must have size at least N^Ω((N)) and this bound is tight. If we could show a similar result for general <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> solving directed connectivity, then this would prove that L ≠ NL. However, proving lower bounds for general <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> solving directed connectivity requires proving stronger lower bounds on monotone <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> for directed connectivity. To work towards this goal, we investigated a different set of inputs which we believed to be hard for monotone <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> to solve and attempted to prove similar lower size bounds. Instead, we found that this set of inputs is actually easy for monotone <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> for directed connectivity to solve, yet if we restrict ourselves to certain-knowledge <b>switching</b> <b>networks,</b> which are a simple and intuitive subclass of monotone <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> for directed connectivity, then these inputs are indeed hard to solve.

In such a model, the generalized MPLS protocol suite could provide the IP centric control plane component {{that will be used}} to deliver rapid and dynamic circuit provisioning of end-to-end optical light paths between the routers. This is called an <b>automatic</b> <b>switched</b> optical (transport) <b>network</b> (ASON). An ASON enables reconfiguration of the logical IP topology by setting up and tearing down light paths. This allows to up- or downgrade link capacities during a router failure to the capacities needed by the new routing of the affected traffic. Such survivability against (single) IP router failures is cost-effective, as capacity to the IP layer can be provided flexibly when necessary. We present and investigate a logical topology optimization problem that minimizes the total amount or cost of the needed resources (interfaces, wavelengths, WDM line-systems, amplifiers, etc.) in both the IP and the optical layer. A novel optimization aspect in this problem is the possibility, {{as a result of the}} ASON, to reuse the physical resources (like interface cards and WDM line-systems) over the different network states (the failure-free and all the router failure scenarios).
