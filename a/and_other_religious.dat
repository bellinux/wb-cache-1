5|$|Although {{previously}} favourable to the Crown, the Cavalier Parliament was alienated by the king's {{wars and}} religious policies during the 1670s. In 1672, Charles issued the Royal Declaration of Indulgence, {{in which he}} purported to suspend all penal laws against Catholics <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>religious</b> dissenters. In the same year, he openly supported Catholic France and started the Third Anglo-Dutch War.|$|E

5|$|While devotional {{paintings}} – especially altarpieces – remained {{dominant in}} Early Netherlandish art, secular portraiture became increasingly common in both {{northern and southern}} Europe as artists freed themselves from the prevailing idea that portraiture should be restricted to saints <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>religious</b> figures.

5|$|During {{his time}} as bishop Foliot served for many years as a papal judge-delegate, {{especially}} in his later years. He was active in both of his dioceses in supporting his cathedral chapters <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>religious</b> houses of the dioceses. He kept in constant contact with his archdeacons and deans about {{the administration of the}} dioceses. He also gathered about himself a group of clerks who compiled a collection of decretals known as the Belvoir collection. This collection mainly relates to Foliot's activities at London, and probably dates to before 1175.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{incidents}} of harassment and hate crimes against Muslims and South Asians {{were reported in}} the days following the attacks. Sikhs were also targeted because Sikh males usually wear turbans, which are stereotypically associated with Muslims.

5|$|A {{centre of}} Buddhist {{learning}} and culture, Gangtok's most notable Buddhist institutions are the Enchey monastery, the Do-drul Chorten stupa complex and the Rumtek Monastery. The Enchey monastery is the city's oldest monastery {{and is the}} seat of the Nyingma order. The two-hundred-year-old baroque monastery houses images of gods, goddesses, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>religious</b> artifacts. In the month of January, the Chaam, or masked dance, is performed with great fanfare. The Dro-dul Chorten is a stupa which was constructed in 1945 by Trulshik Rimpoché, head of the Nyingma order of Tibetan Buddhism. Inside this stupa are complete set of relics, holy books, and mantras. Surrounding the edifice are 108 Mani Lhakor, or prayer wheels. The complex also houses a religious school.|$|E
5|$|According to David A. Norris, {{a scholar}} specializing in Serbian {{cultural}} history, conditions in 19th-century Serbia were unsuitable {{for the development}} of visual art. Materials were difficult to come by, studio and exhibition spaces were virtually non-existent, and there were no art patrons willing to financially support painters and purchase their finished works. In {{the first half of the}} 19th century, Serbian visual artists dedicated themselves almost exclusively to decorating the walls of churches and producing icons <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>religious</b> objects. There were some painters of Serb heritage living outside Serbia, such as Uroš Knežević and Jovan Popović, who resided in the Austrian Empire.|$|E
5|$|After the {{foundation}} of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932, the mosque underwent several major modifications. In 1951 King Ibn Saud (1932–1953) ordered demolitions around the mosque to make way for new wings to the east and west of the prayer hall, which consisted of concrete columns with pointed arches. Older columns were reinforced with concrete and braced with copper rings at the top. The Suleymaniyya and Majidiyya minarets were replaced by two minarets in Mamluk revival style. Two additional minarets were erected to the northeast and northwest of the mosque. A library was built along the western wall to house historic Qurans <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>religious</b> texts.|$|E

5|$|In July 2008, {{the then}} Governor-General of Jamaica Sir Kenneth O. Hall, {{indicated}} that he wished to step down due to declining health. He was persuaded {{to remain in the}} post for an additional half-year. On 13 January 2009, the Prime Minister of Jamaica, Bruce Golding (of the Jamaica Labour Party), announced that Allen would succeed Kenneth Hall as governor-general. The announcement generated controversy, both because Allen had strong ties to the Seventh Day Adventist Church, and because as an Adventist, Allen might be unable to attend events due to his strict observation of the sabbath. On 28 January 2009, Allen resigned from his presidency of the West Indies Union. He also resigned as {{chairman of the board of}} Northern Caribbean University, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>religious</b> organisations in 2009.|$|E

5|$|News of {{the initial}} events in London also reached York around 17 June, and attacks at once broke out on the {{properties}} of the Dominican friars, the Franciscan friaries <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>religious</b> institutions. Violence continued over the coming weeks, and on 1 July a group of armed men, under the command of John de Gisbourne, forced their way into the city and attempted to seize control. The mayor, Simon de Quixlay, gradually began to reclaim authority, but order was not properly restored until 1382. The news of the southern revolt reached Scarborough where riots broke out against the ruling elite on 23 June, with the rebels dressed in white hoods with a red tail at the back. Members of the local government were deposed from office, and one tax collector was nearly lynched. By 1382 the elite had re-established power.|$|E

5|$|Robert Bloet (sometimes Robert Bloett; died 1123) was Bishop of Lincoln 1093-1123 and Chancellor of England. Born into a noble Norman family, {{he became}} a royal clerk under King William I. Under William I's son and {{successor}} King William II, Bloet was first named chancellor then appointed to the See of Lincoln. Continuing to serve the king while bishop, Bloet remained a close royal councillor to William II's successor, King Henry I. He did much to embellish Lincoln Cathedral, and gave generously to his cathedral <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>religious</b> houses. He educated a number of noblemen, including illegitimate children of Henry I. He also was the patron of the medieval chronicler Henry of Huntingdon, and was an early patron of Gilbert of Sempringham, {{the founder of the}} Gilbertine monastic order.|$|E
5|$|Several signal {{events from}} the 4th to 6th centuries mark {{the period of}} {{transition}} during which the Roman Empire's Greek East and Latin West divided. Constantine I (r. 324–337) reorganised the empire, made Constantinople the new capital, and legalised Christianity. Under Theodosius I (r. 379–395), Christianity became the Empire's official state religion <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>religious</b> practices were proscribed. Finally, under the reign of Heraclius (r. 610–641), the Empire's military and administration were restructured and adopted Greek for official use instead of Latin. Thus, although the Roman state continued and Roman state traditions were maintained, modern historians distinguish Byzantium from ancient Rome insofar as it was centred on Constantinople, oriented towards Greek rather than Latin culture, and characterised by Orthodox Christianity.|$|E
5|$|According to Carroll family tradition, Powis {{told his}} new clerk that he {{believed}} King James was receiving bad advice related to the religious turmoil in England. Powis {{was concerned about the}} consequences for English Catholics. He supposedly spoke on Carroll's behalf to an associate of his, Charles Calvert, proprietor of the Maryland colony. Charles Calvert's grandfather, George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, was a former member of Parliament and Secretary of State to James I, whose Catholicism had effectively ended his political career. Intense lobbying by George Calvert had led to the granting of a hereditary charter to the Calvert family. The Maryland colony was established in the 1630s on land granted by this charter. It was intended as a haven for English Catholics <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>religious</b> minorities. Powis may have encouraged Carroll to emigrate to Maryland with the hope that the younger man's career would come to greater fulfillment in a place with less religious conflict than England at the time.|$|E

5|$|It was not {{uncommon}} for wealthy or powerful families to facilitate the construction of large temple complexes, usually by donating {{a portion of their}} family estate to a Buddhist sect. Often the land already contained buildings that could be re-purposed for religions use. The Fei (費) family of the town of Jinze, located just west of Shanghai, converted a mansion on their property into a Buddhist sutra-recitiation hall, and later built several other religious buildings around the hall. This spurred a boom in temple construction in the area, causing Jinze to become a major center of the White Lotus sect of Buddhism, which in turn spurred the construction of more temples and lead the town to become a significant location within the Song. The nearby town of Nanxiang gained prominence shortly {{after the fall of the}} Song in large part to the construction of temples <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>religious</b> buildings, which spanned the entire Song empire.|$|E
5|$|Within the interior, {{the upper}} and middle floors are State floors; they are in turn divided into several {{reception}} rooms, throne rooms and galleries complete with royal portraits of every Chakri Monarchs (including Second King Pinklao) and their consorts. More specifically, to the east gallery are Buddhist Images <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>religious</b> images, while to the west are reception rooms for State guests and other foreign dignitaries. In {{other parts of the}} throne hall there are also libraries and rooms where the ashes of Kings (Rama IV to Rama VIII) and their Queens are housed. Many of the European-made chandeliers inside the Hall initially belonged to Chao Phraya Si Suriyawongse; however they proved too big for his own residence and he eventually gave them to King Chulalongkron as gifts. The throne hall was also the first structure in Thailand in which electricity was installed, at the insistence of Prince Devavongse Varopakar. The lower floor or ground floor is reserved for servants and the Royal Guards. Currently there is a museum displaying old weapons.|$|E
