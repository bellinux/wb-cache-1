40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} of this work is to study the feasibility of a more objective and rigorous classification of the calices of Hibiscus sabdariffa based on their physicochemical profile. To do so, <b>19</b> <b>analyses</b> were carried out on 4 varieties of calices cultivated in Senegal: Vimto, Koor, Thaï and CLT 92. Principal component analysis results showed that 15 physicochemical and biochemical parameters could be potentially used to discriminate the varieties of calices. Polyphenolic and anthocyanin contents were anti-correlated to protein content and {{could be used to}} differentiate the Vimto/CLT 92 and the Koor/Thaï varieties. Within these two clusters, pH and lipid content could discriminate each variety. Finally, factorial discriminant analysis showed that total anthocyanin content, lipid content and chromaticity C* were the 3 parameters enabling the most efficient classification of calices according to variety and led to 100 % classification accuracy...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of a subset of T lymphocytes with an irregular phenotype has been identified in the peripheral blood of 22 subjects, selected among more than 5000 individuals evaluated for peripheral blood lymphocyte subset distribution {{as part of a}} routine procedure. By Southern Blot Analysis 13 out of 14 of the analysed samples presented additional non-germline bands, indicative of monoclonal or oligoclonal T cell expansions. Moreover, the cytometric analysis showed that 7 out of <b>19</b> <b>analysed</b> samples were restricted for a subfamily of the TCR variable regions. Thus, lymphocyte subsets with phenotypic irregularities could represent the clonally driven expansion of otherwise normally subpopulations, which may be present in peripheral blood below the limit of detection of routine phenotypic analyses. Such clonal populations could exert a regulatory activity either on the pathogenetic mechanisms of the disease or in maintaining homeostasis in healthy people...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{explores the}} shift from course-based to state-wide exit {{examinations}} {{at the end of}} upper secondary education in Germany between 2007 and 2011, and whether this resulted in an increased standardisation of teacher-assigned course-based semester grades. The sample consisted of 253 (2007) and 338 students (2011) in math courses at advanced level (schools: N = <b>19).</b> <b>Analyses</b> of subgroups of students based on gender, ethnicity, and family background revealed a significant difference in grades. Perhaps the enhanced correlations between the achievement test and the course-based semester grades are an effect of standardisation due to state-wide exit examinations. In contrast, when achievement was controlled for, the implementation of state-wide exit examinations did not increase the standardisation of course-based semester grades in the given time in the intended manner. The course-based semester grades continue to differ depending on students’ background. Several possible explanations for this result are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{mapping of}} {{recombination}} hot {{spots in the}} human genome has demonstrated that crossover is a nonrandom process that occurs at well-defined positions along chromosomes. However, the mechanisms that direct hot-spot turnover in complex mammalian genomes are poorly understood. Analyses {{of the human genome}} are impaired by the inability to genetically dissect and molecularly manipulate recombinogenic regions to test their roles in regulating hot spots. Here, using the BXD recombinant inbred strains as a crossover library, three new recombination hot spots have been identified on mouse chromosome <b>19.</b> <b>Analyses</b> of a highly polymorphic recombination hot spot (HS 22) revealed that approximately 4 % of recombinant molecules display complex and incomplete repair with discontinuous conversion tracts, as well as persistent heteroduplex DNA at crossover sites in mature spermatozoa. Also, sequence analysis of the wild house mouse revealed instability {{at the center of this}} hot spot. This suggests that complete repair is not required for completion of mammalian meiosis, a scenario that leaves duplex DNA containing mismatches at crossover sites...|$|R
40|$|Supported by {{evidence}} for assortative mating and polygynandry, sexual selection through mate choice was suggested {{as the main}} force driving the evolution of colour diversity of haplochromine cichlids in Lakes Malawi and Victoria. The phylogenetically closely related tribe Tropheini of Lake Tanganyika includes the genus Tropheus, which comprises over 100 colour variants currently classified into six morphologically similar, polyphyletic species. To assess the potential for sexual selection in this sexually monochromatic maternal mouthbrooder, we used microsatellite-based paternity inference to investigate the mating system of Tropheus moorii. In contrast to haplochromines in Lake Malawi, multiple paternity is rare or even absent in broods of T. moorii. Eighteen of the <b>19</b> <b>analysed</b> families were consistent with genetic monogamy, while either a mutation or more than one sire explained the genotype of one offspring in another brood. We discuss the differences in breeding behaviour between T. moorii and the Lake Malawi haplochromines, and evaluate additional factors or alternatives to sexual selection as promoters of colour diversification. A preliminary survey of other Tropheini species suggested that multiple paternity is infrequent in the entire tribe...|$|R

In this paper are <b>19</b> <b>analyses</b> by 18 different research groups, often using quite different methodologies, of 12 extreme events that occurred in 2012. In addition to investigating the causes of these extreme events, the multiple analyses of four of the events, the high temperatures in the United States, the record low levels of Arctic sea ice, and the heavy rain in northern Europe and eastern Australia, provide an opportunity to compare and contrast {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the various methodologies. The differences also provide insights into the structural uncertainty of event attribution, that is, the uncertainty that arises directly from the differences in analysis methodology. In these cases, there was considerable agreement between the different assessments of the same event. However, different events had very different causes. Approximately half the analyses found some evidence that anthropogenically caused climate change was a contributing factor to the extreme event examined, though the effects of natural fluctuations of weather and climate on the evolution of many of the extreme events played key roles as well.

40|$|Can {{international}} {{non-governmental organizations}} (INGOs) influence domestic policy? This paper offers new quantitative {{evidence of the}} impact of INGOs in one specific policy area—Freedom of Information (FOI) laws—as well as highlighting an under-studied mechanism of INGO influence on the design of domestic laws. I test this argument by examining the effect of legal analyses of draft FOI legislation published by the INGO Article <b>19.</b> These <b>analyses</b> provide expert legal assessments and make normative evaluations—both information politics and symbolic politics. I find that in countries in which Article <b>19</b> conducted legal <b>analyses,</b> the design of the subsequently passed FOI laws was significantly stronger than in countries that were not subject to such analyses. I demonstrate that this finding is not an artifact of Article 19 ’s selection process.

Finally, I examine the process of FOI drafting and adoption in Serbia to illustrate the argument and specific mechanisms at work...|$|R

Furthermore, more than half of the countries which considered national media policy on appointment procedures to be well defined in safeguarding PSM’s independence, declared some degree of risk in the implementation of this policy, pointing to situations in which the government or other political groupings have in the past few years tried to interfere with the appointment processes. Also, results show that there are large differences in the mechanisms of PSM funding.

Because these aberrant transcripts are both infrequent (incidence < 5 %) and mutually exclusive, multiplex assays are required to detect them in tumor samples. MethodsAberrant transcripts of the six aforementioned oncogenes (36 transcripts in total) were examined in a molecular counting (MC) assay, which counts RNA molecules by simultaneous hybridization of several probes. Forty-one samples of surgically resected lung adenocarcinoma tissue found to express one of these aberrant oncogenic transcripts upon whole transcriptome sequencing (test cohort: n = 22) or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (validation cohort: n = <b>19)</b> <b>analyses</b> were subjected to MC, after which biopsies were performed on tumor tissue samples.

40|$|MBA thesis (WBS) International {{marketing}} communication programmes {{that work in}} other parts of the world are often of mediocre success only in the Middle East and Africa. Consumers as well as business and government prospects in these regions do not respond to the same {{marketing communication}} stimuli as the cultural environments in Africa and the Middle East differ from the ones in Europe and North America where such international marketing communication programmes are usually designed. Drawing on intercultural studies of the African and Arabian cultures and cross-cultural marketing communications, this report examines to what level culture impacts marketing communications across Africa and the Middle East. Based on qualitative semi-structured expert interviews with 14 marketing executives and cultural experts from these regions and a resulting content analysis, this report reveals a number of striking parallels when deploying marketing communications programmes in Africa and the Middle East. The research elicits some interesting findings. The analysis of the cultural landscapes of Africa and the Middle East reveals that both regions are characterised by strong power distance and collectivistic structures, two cultural dimensions which have a serious impact on preferred marketing communications messages and successful promotional tactics across Africa and the Middle East. These cultural parallels result in 15 out of <b>19</b> <b>analysed</b> marketing communications tools having similar relevance to both regions when executed correctly. They also dictate preferred messages (product usage in groups, status and progression in life) and advertising appeals (family, sports, status symbols, celebrities).

The framework takes into consideration cultural relevance and infrastructure readiness and suggests a number of suitable marketing communications elements to apply in the Middle East and Africa, including TV advertising, events, personal selling, and government relations...|$|R
40|$|Unmanned {{aircraft}} systems (UAS) {{will have}} a major impact on future aviation. Medium and large UA operating at altitudes above 3000 feet will require access to non-segregated, that is, controlled airspace. In order for unmanned aircraft to be integrated into the airspace and operate with other commercial aircraft, a very reliable command and control (C 2, a. k. a. control and non-payload communications, (CNPC)) link is required. For operations covering large distances or over remote locations, a beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS) CNPC link would need to be implemented through satellite. Significant progress has taken place on several fronts to advance the integration of UAS into controlled airspace, including the recent completion of Minimum Operational Performance Standards (MOPS) for terrestrial line-of-sight (LOS) UAS command and control (C 2) links. The development of MOPS for beyond line-of-sight C 2 satellite communication links is underway. Meanwhile the allocation of spectrum for UAS C 2 by the International Telecommunications Union Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R) has also progressed. Spectrum for LOS C 2 was allocated at the 2012 World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC- 12), and for BLOS C 2 an allocation was made at WRC- 15, under WRC- 15 Resolution 155. Resolution 155, however, does not come into effect until several other actions have been completed. One of these required actions is the identification of a power flux density (pfd) limit on the emissions of UAS Ku-Band satellite communications transmitters reaching the ground.
