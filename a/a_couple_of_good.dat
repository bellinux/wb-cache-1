5|$|In {{the first}} leg Celtic went a goal down through an own goal from Joos Valgaeren on 48 minutes. Larsson {{equalised}} seconds later, but then missed a penalty kick on 75 minutes. Despite <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> chances {{near the end of}} the game, Celtic were unable to score a winning goal. The 1–1 draw, watched by around 60,000 fans, was Martin O'Neill's 50th unbeaten match at Celtic Park, a record of results that stretched back to their last home defeat which was against Ajax in August 2001.|$|E
25|$|Leadbeater was a {{right-handed}} lower order batsman, and a leg-break and googly bowler, who had <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> {{seasons for}} Yorkshire in 1950 and 1951, {{but failed to}} keep {{his place in the}} side. He reappeared for Warwickshire County Cricket Club in 1957 and 1958, as a possible replacement for Eric Hollies, who retired after the 1957 season; but he failed to take enough wickets and his contract was not renewed.|$|E
25|$|The South Africans {{travelled}} to Australia {{the following}} summer and then met up again on home soil. Throughout both legs of the series Prince had trouble facing up against Shane Warne, being dismissed by him seven times in the six Test matches. Along with his debut series which was played against Australia Prince had fallen victim to Warne a total of eleven times. Despite this he still managed <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> innings. The first came in the third Test at Sydney where he again batted well with Kallis and made 119. Three matches later but this time in South Africa, Prince top scored in South Africa's first innings at the Wanderers and made 93.|$|E

500|$|Brett Alan Weiss, {{writing for}} Allgame, gave the game {{two out of}} five stars. Weiss wrote the game was not [...] "a {{particularly}} engaging gaming experience" [...] and {{referred to it as}} [...] "an interesting failure. The designers had <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> ideas, but the execution of those ideas in conjunction with the shoot-'em-up action is second rate". In his book Classic Home Video Games, 1972–1984, Weiss wrote that the game's box art was better than the actual game.|$|E
500|$|On {{the other}} hand, while {{reviewing}} the most overrated albums of all time, where Morning Glory ranked number 16, writer Max Easton of FasterLouder {{wrote that the}} album is [...] "full of anthems {{for the sake of}} anthems," [...] and that [...] "they're all variations on only <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> ideas." [...] He concluded by saying, [...] "What's the Storys lasting place in '90s folklore is less {{about the quality of the}} album, and more about the celebrity status and faux imagery attached to it." ...|$|E
500|$|Since airing, [...] "Grift of the Magi" [...] has {{received}} generally mixed to negative reception from critics. While reviewing the eleventh season of The Simpsons, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson {{commented that the}} episode [...] "feels like an amalgamation of elements from prior holiday programs and never really elicits much humor. Christmas is commercialized and corporations use and abuse their customers? Those aren’t exactly rich insights, so [...] {{comes across as a}} below average episode." [...] In his review of the DVD Christmas With the Simpsons, Digitally Obsessed critic Joel Cunningham wrote that the episode [...] "comes from Season 11, well past the point when the series had sacrificed character for absurdist humor. Unless you don't think evil toy marketers, sentient Furbys, and Gary Coleman qualify. Anyway, after the school nearly goes bankrupt, Principal Skinner signs a contract with corporate backers who use the kids to conduct market research. There are some good gags, but the story doesn't hang together very well." [...] Adam Tyner of DVD Talk argued that the episode [...] "has <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> gags (Gary Coleman chatting on the phone being my favorite) but is quickly forgettable". Brian James of PopMatters described Coleman's cameo as [...] "hysterical" [...] in 2004, and Meghan Lewit of the same website listed [...] "Grift of the Magi" [...] at number eight on her 2009 list of the [...] "10 best holiday themed TV episodes." ...|$|E

50|$|The village itself (in {{architectural}} {{and aesthetic}} terms) is nothing very special but the landscape really pays off!

500|$|Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} four stars, saying [...] "The film may be animated, and largely taken up with rats, but its pulse is gratifyingly human. And you {{have never seen a}} computer-animated feature with this sort of visual panache and detail." [...] Rafer Guzman of Newsday gave the film three out of four stars, saying [...] "So many computer-animated movies are brash, loud and popping with pop-culture comedy, but Ratatouille has the warm glow of a {{favorite}} book. The characters are {{more than the sum of}} their gigabyte-consuming parts – they feel handcrafted." [...] Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel gave the film three out of five stars, saying [...] "Has Pixar lost its magic recipe? Ratatouille is filled with fairly generic animated imagery, a few modest chases, <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> gags, not a lot of laughs." [...] Scott Foundas of LA Weekly gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "Bird has taken the raw ingredients of an anthropomorphic-animal kiddie matinee and whipped them into a heady brew about nothing less than the principles of artistic creation." [...] Colin Covert of the Star Tribune gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "It's not just the computer animation that is vibrantly three-dimensional. It's also the well-rounded characters... I defy you to name another animated film so overflowing with superfluous beauty." [...] Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "With Ratatouille, Bird once again delivers not just a great, witty story, but dazzling visuals as well." [...] Bill Muller of The Arizona Republic gave the film four and a half stars out of five, saying [...] "Like the burbling soup that plays a key part in Ratatouille, the movie is a delectable blend of ingredients that tickles the palette and leaves you hungry for more." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Beautiful Tonight" [...] was {{confirmed}} as the follow-up single {{on the third}} week of January through the Daily Star. The release date is yet to be announced. They stated, [...] "You can imagine our next single Beautiful Tonight being played in a club. Yes, it’s that different to what we usually release. John Shanks wrote it and it’s up-tempo and will open a few eyes and ears. People who don’t usually like Westlife might like it and hopefully people who do like us won’t not like it. It’s young, fresh and exciting so we feel brilliant about it coming out. When they first hear it, some people might go: [...] "Whoa, who is that?” and that’s why we wanted it as our first song on the album. It’d be cool to get <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> dance remixes off it but we won’t be coming up with a dance routine for it on tour, except for maybe a few clicks and putting {{one foot in front of}} the other. The song reminds us of the early days when we put out [...] "World of Our Own". The song was performed live on Irish national television show Paul O'Grady Show. After that, the track peaked at the top 40 of Irish Radio Airplay Chart.|$|E

"If {{we had had}} <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> shovels with us, Luka, {{we should}} have made short work of this," [...] Godfrey said as they retired below into their tent.

Their first-rate horses, however, {{were not to be}} procured from them on any terms. They almost invariably use ponies; but of a breed infinitely superior to any in the United States. They are fond of trying their speed and bottom, and of betting upon them.|$|E
50|$|Excluding the {{approach}} to Butts Junction, the line was entirely single track. Only Herriard station was provided with two platforms. As a light railway, the line had an overall speed limit of 25 miles per hour, and the journey from Basingstoke to Butts Junction took typically 45 minutes. When it opened, there were three return trips to Alton daily, which rose to six {{by the summer of}} 1909, with <b>an</b> extra <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> trains.|$|R
6000|$|... "I did {{not expect}} to be suited so soon," [...] he said to himself, [...] "and {{certainly}} {{did not expect}} to find such a mount here.

I don't think there is any fear of your being interfered with, by the Dervishes.

60|$|I nestled {{against the}} pillows, the brow a bit drawn. It {{is all very}} well {{to try to do}} old school friends a spot of good, but I could not but feel that in espousing the cause of a lunkhead capable of mucking things up as Gussie had done, I had taken on a {{contract}} almost too big for human consumption. It seemed to me that what Gussie needed was not so much the advice of a seasoned man of the world as a padded cell in Colney Hatch and <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> keepers to see that he did not set the place on fire.|$|E
6000|$|... "This Princess had commissioned, {{direct from}} Lyon, a very {{beautiful}} dress; which arrived duly, addressed to her at Stettin. As this kind of stuffs is charged with very heavy dues, the DOUANIER, head Custom-house Personage of the Town, had the impertinence to detain the dress till payment were made. The Princess, in a lofty indignation, sent word to this person, To bring the dress instantly, and she would pay the dues on it. He obeyed: but,"--mark the result,--"scarcely had the Princess got eye on him, when she seized her Lyon Dress; and, giving the Douanier <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> slaps on the face, ordered him out of her apartment and house.|$|E

2500|$|In Campo: Still Entertaining Campese {{writes that}} Cardiff Arms Park is [...] "Certainly the venue I have fondest {{memories}} of after {{a standing ovation}} the crowd there gave me in 1988.

[...] "Our own {{regiment}} had left, {{and we did}} not care to ask for two soldiers from another regiment, as these might have turned out badly. We thought it better, therefore, to delay until we joined the army, and wait till we could obtain <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> men from one of the cavalry regiments there. As it is, Monsieur Kennedy's servant can look after the three of us, and, I have no doubt, two of the soldiers of the escort will not object to earn a few livres by looking after our horses on the way." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jim {{examined}} the walls. [...] "There {{would not be}} much difficulty in working through them if we had <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> knives, they are made of sun-dried bricks. However, we will hunt about among this rubbish {{and see if we}} can find some more bits of iron. Anyhow, we can wait a day or two before we make up our minds about it and see what comes of it. I vote we clear up this litter a bit, and chuck it out through the opening. There is a close, musty smell in the place. The opening will be very handy for chucking everything out and keeping the place as clean as we can." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is quite}} certain, Ralph; and therefore, {{if it is}} done by a boat, it must be by one so small and {{insignificant}} that they would pay but little attention to it if they caught sight of it. My idea {{is that we should}} take our own little boat, which is a fast one, paint it black, to give it the appearance of a fisherman's boat, and hire <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> rowers from the village. This, with one knight dressed as a fisherman, should go ahead of us, and explore every inlet where ships could be sheltered. We would follow ten miles behind. When we get near the places where the natives think the fleet is likely to be, the boat must go on at night, while we anchor. In that way they {{ought to be able to}} discover the corsairs, while themselves unseen, and to gain some idea of their numbers and the position in which they are anchored, and bring us back news." ...|$|E

2500|$|Between 618 and 621 AD, the Sassanid Persian army {{defeated}} the Byzantine forces in Egypt and occupied the province.
