During warm rolling, blackplate can be manufactured to thicknesses of 1.5 mm or more. Cold rolled blackplate, by contrast, can be made thinner - thicknesses of 0.4 to 1.5 mm being attainable - and produces better surface qualities.|$|E

The investigated GO steels for experiments were taken from one industrial line after final cold rolling reduction and subsequent <b>box</b> <b>annealing.</b> It was shown that application of short time heat treatment conditions could lead to complete abnormal grain growth in the investigated GO steel. The texture and microstructure obtained in the laboratory treated material {{is similar to that}} observed in the same GO steel taken after industrial final box-annealing. However, some “parasitic” grains were observed in the secondary recrystallized matrix of the laboratory treated GO steel. These “parasitic” grains possess the unwanted from magnetic properties point of view { 111 } orientation components...|$|R
40|$|The main process {{variable}} examined was {{the rate of}} heating to the annealing temperature. Interactions between precipitates, nuclei, and migrating grain boundaries resulted {{in a range of}} recrystallization textures in the Fe-Cu alloy from almost random after rapid heating to well-defined textures after slower heating rates. The most noticeable variation was in the amount of near- left brace 100 right brace orientation, which was very low in a simulated <b>box</b> <b>anneal,</b> but which was strong when the heating programme involved holding at a temperature high in the recovery range. The observed differences in recrystallization textures are ascribed to the heterogeneous precipitation of Cu and to different nucleation processes for near- left brace 111 right brace and near- left brace 100 right brace grains. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Biological {{processes}} are random {{in nature and}} studying them through laboratory experiments alone is costly and time-consuming. Applying mathematical modeling provides a more efficient method for understanding and modifying them. Recently we proposed an algorithm Box to assist in modeling and controlling any biological pathway. In the Box algorithm, the output (protein concentration) control and optimization is carried out by applying simulated annealing to selective high-sensitivity reactions. Here we apply an alternative approach, a genetic algorithm, in place of simulated <b>annealing,</b> in the <b>Box</b> algorithm. The improved Box algorithm compares outputs derived by simulated annealing with outputs derived by the genetic algorithm and chooses the better set of values. We thus provide a tool to guide the modification of biological pathways that is both accurate and easy to apply. We illustrate our technique using the TNFα-mediated NF-κB pathway...|$|R

A textura cristalogrÃfica e o tamanho de grÃo sÃo extremamente influenciados pelo tratamento tÃrmico de recozimento realizado apÃs o processo de laminaÃÃo a frio para obtenÃÃo de tiras metÃlicas desses aÃos.

Amostras do material nas condiÃÃes laminado a frio, parcialmente recristalizadas a 580, 585, 590, 595, 600, 605, 610, 615 e 620 ÂC e recozidas a 730 ÂC por 12 horas (recozimento em caixa) foram analisadas quanto Ã microestrutura, textura cristalogrÃfica e perdas magnÃticas por histerese. O material tambÃm foi submetido a tratamentos tÃrmicos para crescimento de grÃo e estes tambÃm foram avaliados com respeito Ã microestrutura e a textura cristalogrÃfica. Os resultados mostraram o inÃcio da recristalizaÃÃo primÃria nas condiÃÃes parcialmente recristalizadas e os tratamentos tÃrmicos para crescimento de grÃo provocaram a ocorrÃncia de recristalizaÃÃo secundÃria. A textura cristalogrÃfica foi modificada pelas condiÃÃes parcialmente recristalizadas, pelo recozimento em caixa e pela recristalizaÃÃo secundÃria. Quanto Ãs perdas magnÃticas por histerese, o recozimento em caixa promoveu uma diminuiÃÃo destas. Non-oriented electrical steels {{are widely used}} {{in the manufacture of}} cores for electric motors being the performance of this equipment affected by the presence of crystallographic texture in these materials. In other hand, the grain size considerably affects the magnetic losses. The crystallographic texture and grain size are greatly influenced by the annealing process performed after cold rolling of these steels. Annealing promotes recrystallization in the microstructure of the material which is closely related with the crystallographic texture. The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the influence of recrystallization on the evolution of crystallographic texture and hysteresis magnetic losses by in non-oriented grain electrical steel with 1. 28 % Si that was cold rolled with reductions of 50 and 70 % in an industrial plant. Samples of the material in the conditions cold rolled and partially recrystallized at 580, 585, 590, 595, 600, 605, 610, 615 and 620 ÂC and annealed at 730 ÂC for 12 hours (<b>box</b> <b>annealing)</b> were analyzed in the aspects of microstructure, crystallographic texture and magnetic hysteresis losses. The material was also subjected to heat treatment for grain growth and they were also evaluated with respect to the microstructure and crystallographic texture. The results showed the evolution of primary recrystallization and also the microstructure and texture when the material is subjected to final heat treatment that promotes grain growth and secondary recrystallization.

40|$|Strain {{localization}} {{is inevitable}} during the rolling process and this manifests itself most clearly in ferrite by {{the formation of}} shear bands and deformation and transition bands. Nucleation of recrystallisation is strongly associated with these microstructures {{and it is clear}} that nucleation is a process of subgrain growth out of these features. In this work it is shown that the γ fibre component of the rolling texture is most prone to strain localization, and that the rotation of materials in the shear bands and deformation bands is around /ND, which gives rise to the { 111 } rolling texture. For shear band and deformation band nuclei to dominate the final texture it is necessary to break the recrystallisation process into two stages, nucleation by growth of subgrains, and "impingement growth" of strings of small grains allowing invasion of all other material. The impingement growth provides, in effect, a super-nucleus, and these comprise strings of { 111 } recrystallised material in cold and warm rolled IF steel, and also in a low carbon steel alloy suitable for <b>box</b> <b>annealing.</b> link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
