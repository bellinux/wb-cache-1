50|$|Various green {{chemistry}} routes {{are being developed}} for the synthesis of acrylonitrile from renewable feedstocks, such as lignocellulosic biomass, glycerol (from biodiesel production), or glutamic acid (which can itself be produced from renewable feedstocks). The lignocellulosic route involves fermentation of the biomass to propionic acid and 3-hydroxypropionic acid which are then converted to acrylonitrile by dehydration and <b>ammoxidation.</b> The glycerol route begins with pyrolysis to acrolein, which undergoes <b>ammoxidation</b> to give acrylonitrile. The glutamic route employs oxidative decarboxylation to 3-cyanopropanoic, followed by a decarbonylation-elimination to acrylonitrile.

40|$|S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: <b>Ammoxidation</b> of {{technical}} lignins {{under mild conditions}} is a suitable approach to artificial humic substances. However, carbohydrates as common minor constituents {{of technical}} lignins have been demonstrated to be a potential source of N-heterocyclic ecotoxic compounds. Ethyl acetate extracts of <b>ammoxidation</b> mixtures of the monosaccharides glucose and xylose exhibited considerable growth inhibiting activity in the OECD 201 test, with 4 -methyl- 1 H-imidazole, 4 -(hydroxymethyl) - 1 H-imidazole, and 3 -hydroxypyridine being the most active compounds. The amount of N-heterocyclic compounds formed at moderate <b>ammoxidation</b> conditions (70 °C, 0. 2 MPa O 2, 3 h) was significantly lower for the polysaccharides cellulose and xylan (16 − 30 μg/g of educt) compared to glucose (15. 4 mg). <b>Ammoxidation</b> at higher temperature is not recommendable for carbohydrate-rich materials as much higher amounts of N-heterocyclic compounds were formed from both monosaccharides (100 °C: 122. 4 − 160. 5 mg/g of educt) and polysaccharides (140 °C: 5. 52 − 16. 03 mg/g of educt) ...|$|E

40|$|The bulk mixed MoV(Te,Sb) (Nb,Ta) O {{catalysts}} containing nanoscale intergrowths {{of so-called}} M 1 and M 2 phases display uniquely high reactivity in propane <b>ammoxidation</b> to acrylonitrile {{associated with the}} surface ab planes of the M 1 phase. The current controversy surrounding this catalytic system {{is focused on the}} role of the M 2 phase, which is unable to activate propane but was suggested in some studies to function in synergy with the M 1 phase by efficiently converting the propylene intermediate to acrylonitrile. The present study systematically examined the catalytic behavior of pure M 1 phases prepared by selective dissolution of the M 2 phase in MoV(Te,Sb) (Nb,Ta) O catalysts in aqueous hydrogen peroxide. It confirmed that the MoV(Te,Sb) (Nb,Ta) O M 1 phases are highly active and selective for propane and propylene <b>ammoxidation,</b> while the MoV(Te,Sb) (Nb,Ta) O M 2 phases were active and selective in propylene <b>ammoxidation</b> only. Most importantly, the kinetic study of the MoV(Te,Sb) (Nb,Ta) O M 1 and M 2 phases in propylene <b>ammoxidation</b> revealed for the very first time that that the M 2 phases are significantly less active than the M 1 phase in propylene <b>ammoxidation.</b> The findings of this study do not support the existence of the synergy effect for any M 1 /M 2 compositional variant. Instead, the observed behavior of MoV(Te,Sb) (Nb,Ta) O catalysts was consistent with partial loss of some surface active species from the M 1 phase surface during the H 2 O 2 treatment and generation of fresh ab planes of the M 1 phase via mechanical grinding of the H 2 O 2 -treated M 1 phase.

40|$|Unsupported {{vanadium}} antimonate catalysts with Sb/V {{ratios of}} 1 and 5 and samples {{with the latter}} ratio supported on alumina were studied in toluene and propane <b>ammoxidation</b> to benzonitrile and acrylonitrile, respectively, and were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis before and after catalytic tests. Activity data for toluene <b>ammoxidation</b> suggest that excess antimony {{with respect to the}} stoichiometric amount required for forming the VSbO 4 rutile phase affects the dispersion of the latter phase giving smaller particles. Vanadium sites are involved both in the activation of toluene and in the insertion of nitrogen in this reaction, whereas antimony does not play a specific role in the reaction mechanism. In propane <b>ammoxidation,</b> on the other hand, due to a higher reaction temperature with respect to toluene (500 °C vs. 370 °C), free vanadia {{on the surface of the}} catalyst has a negative influence on the selectivity because it promotes the conversion of ammonia to nitrogen, decreasing the surface nitrogenous species required for the selective formation of acrylonitrile. Excess antimony is thus necessary for completing the reaction between antimony and vanadium oxides, but antimony also participates in the reaction mechanism. In propane <b>ammoxidation,</b> in fact, XPS data show that both vanadium and antimony sites are reduced. Tentatively, vanadium sites are involved in the activation of propane, while antimony sites insert nitrogen. The differences between the toluene and propane <b>ammoxidation</b> mechanisms are interpreted to be primarily related to the different reaction temperatures...|$|E
