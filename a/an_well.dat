40|$|All-optical {{multicasting}} is a {{key technology}} of future transparent photonic network, and in this paper it is presented and experimentally demonstrated based on four-wave mixing (FWM) with multi-frequency pump in 100 m dispersion flattened highly nonlinear photon crystal fiber (HNL-PCF). A signal together with double orthogonal pumps is input into the PCF, and four idlers at new frequencies can be generated through degenerate multi-frequency pump FWM processes, which carry the same data information as the input signal and then a 4 x 10 Gbit/s wavelength multicasting has been obtained with a tunable operation wavelength range of 35. 2 nm and total channel span of 4. 4 THz. The optimal conversion efficiency and the optimal Q factor are - 22 dB and 5. 3, respectively. The system is transparent to both bit rate and modulation format. The advantage of this scheme consists {{in the ability of}} bandwidth, and the multicasting channel scalable due to dispersion flattening of PCF is used.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the expression of}} pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (PSTI) in colorectal cancer by immunohistochemical staining using an anti-PSTI antiserum, an in situ hybridisation technique utilising sulphonated PSTI cDNA probe, and a Northern blot hybridisation method, using a 32 P-labelled PSTI cDNA probe. Immunohistochemically, PSTI was detected in 80 of 95 (84 %) colorectal cancer cases. Analyses with in situ hybridisation as well as Northern blot hybridisation demonstrated PSTI mRNAs in immunohistochemically positive cases, showing PSTI could be produced in colorectal cancerous cells. Histologically well or moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma showed higher incidence of PSTI immunoreactivitity than the other types. Furthermore, {{the intensity of the}} immunohistochemical staining for PSTI increased the more cases advanced, particularly in regard to depth of invasion and tumour size. Thus, PSTI expression is widespread in colorectal cancer, and occurs more commonly in advanced cases. Considering the suggestion that PSTI is a growth-stimulating factor as <b>an</b> <b>well</b> as inhibitor to proteolytic proteinase, the present findings may indicate that PSTI expressed in colorectal cancerous cells may play a role possibly closely associated with tumour development.

There have been many proposals to obtain <b>an</b> <b>well</b> posed action principle for general relativity, e. g., addition of the Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term to the Einstein-Hilbert action. These boundary terms are dependent on what one fixes on the boundary and in particular on spacetime dimensions as well.

Then we will connect these dynamical variables and boundary term obtained thereof to existing literature and shall comment on a few properties of Einstein-Hilbert action which might have been unnoticed earlier in the literature. Before concluding with future prospects and discussions, we will perform a general analysis of the boundary term of Einstein-Hilbert action for null surfaces as well.

A surface sensitive technique known as Auger electron spectroscopy is ideal for studying graphene due to {{the thickness of the}} graphene. A complete understanding of how the various peak in the graphene Auger spectra occur is not yet available. Towards explaining these peaks a simulation which predicts the Auger energies of neutral free carbon has been scripted. Growth of graphene which is mostly likely to see the greatest implementation in industry occurs in chemical vapor deposition systems. In order to avoid time-consuming and potentially damaging transfer processes, a type of graphene growth which occurs at the interface of a nickel catalyst and the underlying substrate which requires no transfer is experimented with. Here, growths have occurred on a remote plasma inductively coupled plasma chemical vapor deposition system at various gas ratios of methane to hydrogen, temperatures, and plasma conditions to explore growth optimization. The growths are subsequently analyzed using Raman spectroscopy, X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Auger electron spectroscopy. In general growths without plasma tended to be more graphite like and growths with plasma tended to be more diamond like...|$|E
40|$|WOS: 000368004600050 International audienceModern diesel {{injectors}} {{operate at}} very high injection pressures of about 2000 bar resulting in injection velocities as high as 700 m/s near the nozzle outlet. In order to better predict {{the behavior of the}} atomization process at such high pressures, high-resolution spray images at high repetition rates must be recorded. However, due to extremely high velocity in the near-nozzle region, high-speed cameras fail to avoid blurring of the structures in the spray images due to their exposure time. Ultrafast imaging featuring ultra-short laser pulses to freeze the motion of the spray appears as <b>an</b> <b>well</b> suited solution to overcome this limitation. However, most commercial high-energy ultrafast sources are limited to a few kHz repetition rates. In the present work, we report the development of a custom-designed picosecond fiber laser generating similar to 20 ps pulses with an average power of 2. 5 W at a repetition rate of 8. 2 MHz, suitable for high-speed imaging of high-pressure fuel jets. This fiber source has been proof tested by obtaining backlight images of diesel sprays issued from a single-orifice injector at an injection pressure of 300 bar. We observed a consequent improvement in terms of image resolution compared to standard white-light illumination. In addition, the compactness and stability against perturbations of our fiber laser system makes it particularly suitable for harsh experimental conditions. (C) 2015 Optical Society of Americ...|$|E
