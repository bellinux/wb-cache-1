50|$|The {{terrain is}} hilly, forcing the road through some gentle curves {{as it passes}} through the district. Despite the {{extensive}} residential development in the area, it is still heavily wooded, with many tall trees shading the houses and few clearings. Streams in the <b>area</b> <b>drain</b> into the Saw Mill River, which rises in the woods to the east. Quaker Road climbs approximate 140 ft from south to north through the district.Within this boundary, along a 0.6-mile (1 km) stretch of Quaker, are 33 acre with 30 buildings, half of which are contributing properties. All of them, whether contributing or not, are wood frame houses of two to three stories with gabled roofs. Those of more modern construction are sympathetic to their historic neighbors. Except for the meeting house, all are still used as residences.

5000|$|The {{most common}} {{complications}} of boils are scarring and infection or abscess of the skin, spinal cord, brain, kidneys, or other organs. Infections may also {{spread to the}} bloodstream (bacteremia) and become life-threatening. [...] S. aureus strains first infect the skin and its structures (for example, sebaceous glands, hair follicles) or invade damaged skin (cuts, abrasions). Sometimes the infections are relatively limited (such as a stye, boil, furuncle, or carbuncle), but other times they may spread to other skin areas (causing cellulitis, folliculitis, or impetigo). Unfortunately, these bacteria can reach the bloodstream (bacteremia) and end up in many different body sites, causing infections (wound infections, abscesses, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, pneumonia) that may severely harm or kill the infected person. S. aureus strains also produce enzymes and exotoxins that likely cause or increase the severity of certain diseases. Such diseases include food poisoning, septic shock, toxic shock syndrome, and scalded skin syndrome. Almost any organ system can be infected by S. aureus. Squeezing or cutting boils (and even smaller pimples) in the danger triangle of the face can be particularly dangerous if done outside a medical setting, as blood vessels in this <b>area</b> <b>drain</b> into the brain and can carry serious infections there.|$|E
40|$|Three of the world's largest {{rivers in}} terms of water {{discharge}} and catchment basin <b>area</b> <b>drain</b> the Siberian Arctic: the Lena, Yenisei and Ob rivers (Milliman, 1991). Their water and solid discharges vary by several orders of magnitude during the year. Snow and ice melting waters get into these Siberian rivers mostly during spring and summer, carrying large amounts of terrestrial OM (organic matter). This material ultimately reaches the shallow seas surrounding the northern Eurasian continent and accumulates in coastal sediments. Here we report on carbon stable isotope (813 C) andhydrocarbon data in the suspended matter (SM) and surface sediments of the Ob and Yenisei estuaries and Kara Sea shelf (Fig. 1). The preservation f terrestrially derived OM in shelf sediments is estimated based on the sedimentary OC (organic arbon) and 813 C values. FZG. 1.

40|$|Currently the {{multiple}} wireless data transmission technologies have been commercially implemented, such as long-term evolution (LTE), Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. There is a keen requirement {{to combine the}} power amplifiers for those technologies into a single one which can amplifies concurrent multi-band signals. On the physically layer, there are two popular architectures, namely parallel single-band power amplifiers and concurrent multi-band power amplifiers. In this thesis, quantitative comparison between parallel single-band power amplifiers and concurrent multi-band power amplifiers has been presented theoretically in the aspects of <b>area,</b> <b>drain</b> efficiency and linearity. Methods of calculating drain efficiency is derived for concurrent multi-band PAs for different frequency ratios. Linearity issues of concurrent multi-band power amplifiers have been addressed based on the concepts of gain compression and intermodulation distortion. Final, area consumption has been compared for both architectures with current technologies. Results of the drain efficiency map versus 2 -D frequency ratio are plotted in figures for class A, B and C. Linearity degradation of concurrent multi-band has been derived mathematically...|$|E

40|$|Historic {{mines in}} New Almaden, CA {{such as the}} New Almaden Quicksilver Mine (NAQM), {{are a source of}} mercury {{contamination}} throughout South San Francisco Bay, California. Mines in this <b>area</b> <b>drain</b> into the Coyote Creek (CC) and Guadalupe River (GR). Water quality and sediment assessments for mercury show increasing levels with increasing proximity to the New Almaden. Tellingly, birds captured at upper GR and CC had some of the highest reported concentrations of mercury in the feathers and blood within the United States. Thus, organisms living within the riparian habitats along the CC, GR, and their tributaries may be affected by local environmental mercury. This study investigates of the feather mercury from Common Yellowthroats (Geothlypis trichas) caught at varying distances from NAQM and the relationship between feather mercury and of body condition and individual quality. Birds in upper GR and CC and at Llagas Creek had higher mass, primary wear, and rectrice wear compared to birds in lower CC and GR. Bib size and fluctuating asymmetry of barbule density in rectrices was greater in birds located in CC and GR. Hue of bib feathers was significantly greater in birds caught at lower GR and CC and upper CC. Total mercury concentrations in rectrices were highest in birds caught in upper GR. All comparisons were significant with a p-value of {{less than or equal to}} 0. 05...|$|E

The fixing of prices charged for the use of water resources is based on the volume captured, extracted or derived, the volume consumed, and the load of effluents in water bodies. The proposed charges for the use of the waters of rivers under the State of São Paulo in UGRHI 09 is the result of broad disclosure process conducted in seminars and technical workshops organized on the subject within the State Water Resources Council CRH, the State Coordinator Water Resources CRHi-SMA, and especially of the Watershed Committee of the Guaçu Mogi (Mogi CBH), especially in meetings and discussions of the Technical Collection and presentations during the plenary meetings of CBH shares Mogi...|$|E
40|$|Ten common {{herbaceous}} {{species were}} {{selected based on}} a survey of a 6. 4 -km² upstream catchment named « Bourdic » in southern France. Approximately 74 % of the catchment is agricultural (mainly vineyards), and 26 % is semi-natural (mainly woodlands and shrubs). The catchment has a Mediterranean climate with heavy rainfalls causing significant Hortonian runoff. The mean annual temperature is 14 °C, and precipitation ranges from 600 to 800 mm per year with a drier period from March to October. Annual potential evapotranspiration is about 1100 mm. The altitude ranges from 55 a. s. l. at the outlet at the northeast to 128 m a. s. l. at the northwest. The surveys were conducted in July-August 2013 according to a non-destructive sampling procedure using GPS with an Android self-developed application; this enabled a location accuracy of 2 m. Agricultural ditches, including roadside ditches, {{were part of the}} study. Thirty-five kilometres of the drainage network (46 %) were surveyed for presence/absence of the species. The remaining ditches were excluded from the analysis because surveying them was impractical or because recent management practices impaired species identification. After the survey, the georeferenced data were exported in a shapefile data format with line features. Also, explanatory variables of the dataset were reported, such as the geomorphological variables at the landscape scale that included the distance to the outlet (Doutlet), the drained surface <b>area</b> (<b>Drain),</b> the Multiresolution Index of Valley Bottom Flatness (Mrvbf), and the sun exposure of the slopes (Northness). The geomorphological variables at the local (ditch) scale were the slope (Slope) and solar radiation (Solar). All these variables are derived from a Digital Elevation Model (MNT) and a Digital Surface Model (MNS) taken in 2001 using an aerial lidar. We added also the distance to natural lands (Dnat) and distance to roads (Droad) {{on the basis of the}} manual classification of an orthophoto of the area taken in 2012...|$|E
