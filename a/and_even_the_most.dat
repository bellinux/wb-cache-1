This, however, isn't true; the alphabet was already regarded as a failure during Young's time. Only 500 copies of the full Book of Mormon translated into the Deseret alphabet sold for US$2 each, and even Young realized that the venture was too expensive <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> devout Mormons could not be convinced to purchase and study the Deseret edition books over the books in the traditional orthography. In the winter of 1870, just one year after their publication, advertisements for the Deseret alphabet books were quietly removed from the Deseret News.|$|E

25|$|Inadequate medical supplies, {{water and}} {{environmental}} contamination, frequent power failures, and outdated training {{led to a}} health care crisis that added to the overall devastation. According to a 1997 UNICEF delegation, hospitals were clean but wards were devoid {{of even the most}} rudimentary supplies and equipment; sphygmomanometers, thermometers, scales, kidney dishes, spatulas, IV giving sets, etc. The mission saw numerous patients being treated with home made beer bottle IV sets, clearly unsterile.

25|$|He was {{the leading}} all-rounder for Derbyshire between the wars and at his peak {{probably}} the most deadly bowler on a sticky wicket Derbyshire ever produced, owing to his perfect length and ability to turn the ball back from the off.

25|$|The {{building}} {{stood for}} 14 years before being {{destroyed by a}} great fire on April 23, 1879. About eleven {{in the morning on}} Wednesday morning, 23 April 1879, smoke and flames could be seen rising from the roof of the Main Building. The causes of the fire were impossible to ascertain. Workmen had been working on repairs on the roof until around 10 o'clock, and the fire might have started due to the dry timber on the roof. The fire was first spotted from the minim's courtyard, and soon word of the event spread {{to the rest of the}} students and faculty. Early attempts at putting out the fire were made, with lines of people passing buckets of waters towards the roof of the building. Water was forced into the great tanks on the roof by steam pressure. Despite these efforts, the fire had spread to the entire roof and quickly consumed the upper floors. The South Bend Fire Department was not able to arrive in time to save the main building, because of the long time needed to round up the volunteer firemen and set up the machines. The supports of the dome burned away and the statue went crashing below in a billow of sparks and flame, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> courageous abandoned the hope of saving the building and focused on rescuing whatever valuable effects might be carried out of the burning building. In the zeal to save precious objects students threw many of the valuables from the windows, yet despite the well-intentioned effort, almost all of these were lost in crashing on the ground. This was especially true for many of the most precious books and manuscripts.|$|E

500|$|Bush has a {{dramatic}} soprano vocal range. Her vocals contain elements of British, Anglo-Irish and most prominently (southern) English accents and, in its utilisation of musical instruments from many periods and cultures, her music has differed from American pop norms.

500|$|The {{negative}} reviews generally {{disliked the}} film's Cold War-period setting, using various adjectives {{to describe it}} such as [...] "stuffy", [...] "stiff", [...] "bor", [...] "oddly hollow", [...] "embalmed", [...] "truncated", and [...] "psychic suffocation". They cited the film's much-advertised reverence of the source material as a fault, referring to the story as [...] "trapped" [...] in a faithful representation of Alan Moore's graphic novel. [...] "Watchmen is a bore [...] It sinks {{under the weight of}} its reverence for the original," [...] wrote Philip Kennicott of The Washington Post. Devin Gordon wrote for Newsweek, [...] "That's the trouble with loyalty. Too little, and you alienate your core fans. Too much, and you lose everyone—and everything—else." [...] Owen Gleiberman's Entertainment Weekly review reads, [...] "Snyder treats each image with the same stuffy hermetic reverence. He doesn't move the camera or let the scenes breathe. He crams the film with bits and pieces, trapping his actors like bugs wriggling in the frame." [...] " [...] never pause to develop a vision of his own. The result is oddly hollow and disjointed; the actors moving stiffly from one overdetermined tableau to another," [...] said Noah Berlatsky of the Chicago Reader. David Edelstein of New York agrees: [...] "They've made the most reverent adaptation of a graphic novel ever. But this kind of reverence kills what it seeks to preserve. The movie is embalmed." [...] A reviewer in The Wall Street Journal wrote, [...] "Watching 'Watchmen' is the spiritual equivalent of being whacked on the skull for 163 minutes. The reverence is inert, the violence noxious, the mythology murky, the tone grandiose, the texture glutinous." [...] Donald Clarke of The Irish Times was similarly dismissive: [...] "Snyder, director of the unsubtle 300, has squinted hard at the source material {{and turned it into a}} colossal animated storyboard, augmented by indifferent performances and moronically obvious music cues." [...] The trade magazines Variety and The Hollywood Reporter were even less taken with the film. Variety's Justin Chang commented that, [...] "The movie is ultimately undone by its own reverence; there's simply no room for these characters and stories to breathe of their own accord, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> fastidiously replicated scenes can feel glib and truncated," [...] and Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter writing, [...] "The real disappointment is that the film does not transport an audience to another world, as 300 did. Nor does the third-rate Chandler-esque narration by Rorschach help...Looks like we have the first real flop of 2009." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Times Literary Supplement {{reviewed}} the novel in its issue of 25 September 1924. The review appreciated the [...] "thriller-cum-adventure" [...] {{style of the}} book and concluded, [...] "The author sets so many questions to the reader in her story, questions which will almost certainly be answered wrongly, that no one is likely to nod over it, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> experienced reader of romances will fail to steer an unerring course and reach the harbour of solution through the quicksands and shoals of blood, diamonds, secret service, impersonation, kidnapping, and violence with which the mystery is guarded." ...|$|E
2500|$|James Berardinelli of Reelviews.net {{gave the}} film {{two and a}} half out of four stars, saying [...] "There's a mesmerizing appeal to the director's in-your-face style, even if the images he {{displays}} are often repugnant. Unfortunately, Tykwer is working with a flawed screenplay <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> arresting visuals cannot compensate for the movie's schizophrenic story." [...] Roger Ebert was very enthusiastic giving the film four out of four stars and wrote [...] "It took imagination to tell it, courage to film it, thought to act it, and from the audience it requires a brave curiosity about the peculiarity of obsession." [...] Ebert later named Perfume as [...] "the most underappreciated movie of the year".|$|E

2500|$|Four-wheel {{disc brakes}} were also {{introduced}} in 1965. The brakes had a four-piston design with two-piece calipers and cooling fins for the rotors. Pads were in frequent {{contact with the}} rotors, but the resulting drag was negligible and did not affect fuel economy. Further, the light touching kept the rotors clean and did not diminish pad life, which was, in fact, quite high: a projected [...] for the front brakes and about twice that distance for the rear binders.

2500|$|Another {{advantage}} for the Mongols was the fact that, compared to most of China, Korea, Central/Western Europe, and many other areas, Khwarezmia was deficient in terms of fortifications. In most of the empire there was no system of forts outside of the walls of major cities, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> important cities such as Samarkand and Otrar had their walls constructed out of mud bricks which could be easily reduced by Mongol siege engines.Morgan, p. 67 This meant that the Mongols, rather than getting bogged down in dozens of small sieges or single multi-year ones as sometimes happened in China, could simply sweep through {{large areas of the}} empire and conquer cities at will in a short time. They had more difficulty in subduing Afghanistan, which had a fortress network, though the relative scarcity of fortresses in the whole of the empire and the ease with which the Mongols subdued large sections of it meant that this didn't matter on a strategic scale. The fortress of Ashiyar held for 15 months of besiegement before falling (requiring the attention of a significant chunk of the Mongol army) while Saif-Rud and Tulak took heavy casualties for the Mongols to subdue. The siege of Bamyan also claimed the life of Chagatai's favorite son, Mötüken.Minhaj Siraj Juzjani, Tabakat-i-Nasiri: A General History of the Muhammadan Dynasties of Asia, trans. H. G.
