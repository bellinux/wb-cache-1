50|$|Adam Frederik Oluf <b>Arndtsen</b> (15 December 1829 - 7 August 1919) was a Norwegian physicist.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} {{utilizing}} the counteranion {{as the source}} of chirality in catalysis was first proposed by <b>Arndtsen</b> and coworkers in 2000, who applied chiral borate anions to copper-catalyzed olefin aziridination and cyclopropanation. The enantioselectivities observed were low: <10% ee in cases where the chiral borate was the only source of chirality. However, the observation that enantioinduction occurred only in nonpolar solvents supports the proposed role of the borate as the chiral counteranion.|$|E

In 1859 he lost out to Hartvig Caspar Christie in a {{competition}} to succeed Lorentz Christian Langberg as an academic of physics at Royal Frederick University. [...] He later became the first director of the Norwegian Metrology Service, serving from 1875 to 1914. From 1900 to 1914 he also represented Norway in the International Bureau of Weights and Measures.|$|E
50|$|He {{finished}} {{secondary school}} at Trondheim Cathedral School in 1844, {{and took the}} cand.miner. degree in 1848. He worked at Kongsberg Silver Mines from 1849 to 1851, and was hired at the Royal Frederick University in 1851. After a hiatus {{in the second half}} of the 1850s, he was hired as a lecturer in 1859. He succeeded Lorentz Christian Langberg, who died in 1857, and was hired in competition with Adam <b>Arndtsen.</b> He also became a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters. He was a professor at the Royal Frederick University from 1866 to his death. He also held lectures in physics, geognosy and mineralogy at the Norwegian Military College, and helped establish Kristiania Technical School (today a part of Oslo University College).|$|E
5000|$|The first {{reported}} {{example of this}} type of catalysis is attributed to Dolling, Davis & Grabowski who in 1984 used a chiral cinchonidine based phase transfer catalyst in the synthesis of indacrinone. Important chiral cation scaffolds are quaternary ammonium cations and quaternary phosphonium cations. The {{first reported}} example of asymmetric cation-binding catalysis originates from Cram and Sogah who in 1981 used a chiral crown ether in combination with a potassium base in an enantioselective Michael addition. The development of chiral anionic catalysists is a more recent research field. In 2000 Llewellyn, Adamson & <b>Arndtsen</b> used a chiral borate anion in olefin aziridination and cyclopropanation. Another regularly encountered scaffold is a chiral phosphate anion together with iminium, carbocationic or oxocarbenium counterions. Chiral anion phase-transfer catalysis was introduced by Toste in 2007.|$|E
40|$|Recently, chiral anions {{have been}} {{uncovered}} as a potent means for inducing asymmetry in catalytic reactions. 1 Introduced {{in the arena}} of cationic transition metal catalysis in 2000 by <b>Arndtsen</b> and co-workers, 2 the strategy has recently been demonstrated by our group and others to be capable of providing products with exceptional enantioselectivity, even in cases where chiral ligands have failed. 3, 4 Parallel to these discoveries, work spearheaded by List has successfully utilized chiral counteranions as supplements or alternatives to chiral amines in iminium-based organocatalytic reactions. 5 Instrumental to all these successes has been the use of axially chiral phosphate ions initially developed by Akiyama and Terada as chiral Br√∏nsted acids for enantioselective additions to imines. 6 - 8 A goal of our laboratory has been probing the stereo-differentiating ability of these chiral phosphates beyond cases involving a putative hydrogen bond to an imine or other electrophile...|$|E
