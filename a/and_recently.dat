5|$|In 2001, Lisa Rosenberger {{published}} a phylogenetic analysis of 14 Dasyatis species, based on morphology. The common stingray {{was reported to}} be the most basal member of the genus, other than the bluespotted stingray (D. kuhlii) and pelagic stingray (D. violacea). However, D. violacea has generally been recognized as belonging to its own genus Pteroplatytrygon, <b>and</b> <b>recently</b> D. kuhlii has also been placed in a different genus, Neotrygon.|$|E
5|$|In November 1849, {{the young}} <b>and</b> <b>recently</b> ordained priest Albert Lacombe arrived in Pembina and {{immediately}} started {{to learn the}} Chippewa language. Despite claiming to {{have to resort to}} manual labour to pay for his food, Belcourt supported a household that included a school teacher, a housekeeper, a Chippewa cook and several servants. Thirty miles to the west, he established a mission at Turtle Mountain to serve as a base for expansion toward the Canadian Rockies.|$|E

5|$|Anna Jai {{moved with}} about 70 former slaves to the Arlington {{neighborhood}} of Jacksonville {{to live out}} her remaining years. The ownership of the island and farms immediately following its sale by Gibbs is unknown, but after the American Civil War, the Freedmen's Bureau managed the island <b>and</b> <b>recently</b> emancipated freedmen lived in the former slave quarters and farmed the land. A New Hampshire farmer named John Rollins purchased the island in 1869 and, finding agriculture in Florida not as successful as he wished, transitioned the island into a tourist resort, building a large luxury hotel and attracting celebrities such as banker William Astor and writer Harriet Beecher Stowe. The slave quarters were displayed as tourist attractions. After the hotel burned down in 1888, the Rollins family successfully cultivated citrus until a freeze in 1894 destroyed their crop. Rollins' daughter's family {{was the last to}} live in the main house; she sold the island to private investors in 1923.|$|E

5|$|Erythranthe, the monkey-flowers and musk-flowers, is {{a diverse}} plant genus {{with at least}} 111 members (as of 2017) in the family Phrymaceae.

Diplacus was segregated from Mimulus as a separate genus at the same time. Mimulus remains as a small genus of eastern North America and the Southern Hemisphere.

There were 52concessionaires in all, nine of them with exhibits in addition to their food for sale. Beginning in 1963, the Food Circus also housed a variety of museums, including Jones' Fantastic Show, the Jules Charbneau World of Miniatures, and the Pullen Klondike Museum.|$|E

He also formed a New Zealand Staff Corps to train and administer the Territorial Force. The quality of small arms and other personal equipment provided to the country's military personnel were improved and orders placed for new artillery pieces and machine-guns.|$|E

5|$|Mallards {{frequently}} interbreed {{with their}} closest {{relatives in the}} genus Anas, such as the American black duck, and also with species more distantly related, such as the northern pintail, leading to various hybrids that may be fully fertile. This is quite unusual among such different species, and is apparently because the mallard evolved very rapidly <b>and</b> <b>recently,</b> during the Late Pleistocene. The distinct lineages of this radiation are usually kept separate due to non-overlapping ranges and behavioural cues, but have not yet {{reached the point where}} they are fully genetically incompatible. Mallards and their domesticated conspecifics are also fully inter-fertile.|$|E
5|$|No.75 Wing {{was raised}} on 13October 1943 at Garbutt in Townsville, Queensland, {{under the command}} of Wing Commander (later Group Captain) Edgar Bruce Courtney. On {{formation}} it had a staff of ten, including three officers. The wing was responsible for RAAF units at Horn Island, Thursday Island, and Higgins Field on Cape York Peninsula. An advance party departed Garbutt for Horn Island on 21October, and the wing headquarters was fully established there six days later. The same month, No.84 Squadron, based at Horn Island <b>and</b> <b>recently</b> converted from CAC Boomerangs to P-40 Kittyhawks, was transferred from the control of No.72 Wing (headquartered at Merauke, New Guinea) to No.75 Wing.|$|E

5|$|The Jugal Region, or Neala, is {{a region}} of the wing that is usually a small {{membranous}} area proximal {{to the base of}} the vannus strengthened by a few small, irregular veinlike thickenings; but when well developed it is a distinct section of the wing and may contain one or two jugal veins. When the jugal area of the forewing is developed as a free lobe, it projects beneath the humeral angle of the hindwing and thus serves to yoke the two wings together. In the Jugatae group of Lepidoptera it bears a long finger-like lobe. The jugal region was termed the neala ("new wing") because it is evidently a secondary <b>and</b> <b>recently</b> developed part of the wing.|$|E

5|$|The {{election}} of Ernst of Bavaria expanded the local feud {{into a more}} German-wide phenomenon. The pope committed 55,000crowns to pay soldiers to fight for Ernst, and another 40,000directly into the coffers of the new Archbishop. Under the command of his brother, Ernst's forces pushed their way into Westphalia, threatening Gebhard and Agnes at their stronghold at Arensburg. Gebhard and Agnes escaped to the rebellious provinces of the Netherlands with almost 1000cavalry, where Prince William gave them a haven in Delft. There, Gebhard solicited the impecunious William for troops and money. After William's assassination in July 1584, Gebhard wrote to Queen Elizabeth requesting assistance. Elizabeth responded {{toward the end of}} 1585, directing him to contact Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, her deputy with the rebellious Dutch, <b>and</b> <b>recently</b> commissioned as the commander-in-chief of her army in the Netherlands.

5|$|There were gardens at Aberdour Castle from {{at least}} 1540. The terraced garden dates {{from the time of}} the 4th Earl of Morton, who succeeded in 1553, and {{comprises}} four broad L-shaped terraces. At the bottom of the terraces was an orchard, laid out in 1690, <b>and</b> <b>recently</b> replanted. The extent of the terracing was only rediscovered following excavations in the 1970s, after parts of the garden had been in use as a market garden. Archaeological investigations were undertaken between 1977 and 1980, to determine whether the lower terraces, which were depicted on a map of 1740, had indeed existed. Although the foundations of the terraces were found, the remains could not be precisely dated, but are thought to have been constructed in the second half of the 16th century. The high retaining walls were rebuilt in 1981, and the terraces were laid with grass, since the excavations had not revealed any evidence of historic planting schemes.|$|E
