5|$|<b>After</b> <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> {{ambitious and}} {{successful}} free-lance acting, Bosse found her options narrowing in the 1930s.

Her technique was still often praised, but also sometimes perceived as old-fashioned and mannered, {{in comparison with the}} more ensemble-oriented style of the times. Finding herself unneeded by any Swedish repertory theatre, she only managed to return as a member of Dramaten by means of skillful persuasion and pointed reminders of her long history there. A humble employee at a humble salary, she played only fifteen roles, all minor, during her last ten years at Dramaten, 1933–43.|$|E
