50|$|Bomb damage {{assessment}} (BDA), {{also known as}} battle {{damage assessment}}, is the practice of assessing damage inflicted on a target from a stand-off weapon, most typically a bomb or <b>air</b> <b>launched</b> <b>missile.</b> It {{is part of the}} larger discipline of combat assessment. Assessment is performed using many techniques including footage from in-weapon cameras, gun cameras, forces on the ground near the target, satellite imagery and follow-up visits to the target. Preventing information on battle damage reaching the enemy is a key objective of military censorship. For nuclear weapons special techniques may be required due to the extensive damage caused and difficulty in approaching the site.|$|E

50|$|Wing KC-135 aerial refuelers {{supported}} tanker {{task forces}} worldwide. In October - November 1983, the wing supported {{the invasion of}} Grenada with aerial refueling. In the 1980s the base received several new weapons systems, including modified B-52H aircraft. In 1983, B-52 crews began training with a new weapon system, the SRAM (Short Range Attack Missile) and later, in 1985, the ALCM (<b>Air</b> <b>Launched</b> Cruise <b>Missile).</b> Also, the wing flew numerous atmospheric sampling missions during 1986 and 1987 {{in response to the}} Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident.|$|R
25|$|The {{programme}} {{ended up}} nearly 3 years late. The first ground firing of the Brimstone missile occurred in August 1999, {{followed by the}} first air-launched firing from a Tornado GR4 in September 2000.

In 1984 the wing upgraded its B-52G force to carry the AGM-86B <b>air</b> <b>launched</b> cruise <b>missile</b> (ALCM).

50|$|A 2016 {{report by}} Hans Kristensen stated that “The F-16s were {{considered}} to be the first planes that are nuclear-capable in the Pakistan arsenal and the French mirage was upgraded as well to carry a new <b>air</b> <b>launch</b> cruise <b>missile.</b> But the United States made its case. What Pakistan does once they get the planes is inevitably up to them,” he said. The report also stated that Pakistan is obliged under the terms of its contract to ask the US for permission before the fighters are converted. To date, the US has given only two countries (Pakistan and Israel) implicit permission to modify their F-16s to carry nuclear warheads.|$|R
50|$|The 596th Bomb Squadron, 2d Bomb Wing flew {{what was}} then the longest combat mission in the history of {{military}} aviation at the start of Desert Storm in 1991.

The official name of this mission was SENIOR Surprise, unofficially it was referred to as Secret Squirrel. The 2d Bomb Wing delivered one-fourth of all U.S. Air Force bombs during Desert Storm.
