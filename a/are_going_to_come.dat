500|$|The song {{has been}} well {{received}} by critics. Will Hermes of Rolling Stone magazine noted [...] "Lost!" [...] as [...] "probably" [...] the [...] "album's most sublime pop moment". NMEs critic Mark Beaumont had the same view of Hermes, complimenting, [...] "It's not until [...] – all church organ funkiness, stomporific handclap rhythms and Chris pouting like a preacher in a jacuzzi full of strippers – that [...] really hits its stride." [...] Chris Jones of BBC writes, [...] "...'Lost!' seems to sport bongos in its mix, yet it's the plaintive voice with its vague sense of regret, the lifts from minor key piano forays into vast, pumping rock and also a strident optimism that people <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> here for." [...] Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork had the same sentiment: [...] "Thanks to a bubbling bit of exotic percussion that wouldn't sound out of place on Peter Gabriel's latter-day LPs, 'Lost!' is transformed from Just Another Coldplay Song into a uniquely alluring smash and live staple for years to come." [...] An article in The Guardian lambasted [...] "Lost!": [...] "This song is a deflated balloon, or, put another way, a used empty condom. He has, I think, merged visual, audio and textual {{into a kind of}} polysensory jam; no part of it works without the other two." ...|$|E
500|$|While rehearsing {{for their}} {{performance}} at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards, Spears played a finished version of [...] "Me Against the Music" [...] to Madonna. After Madonna commented that she liked the track, Spears asked her to do the song with her. RedZone then handed [...] "Me Against the Music" [...] to Madonna, who arranged and recorded her vocal additions on her own, therefore making the song a duet. Spears, {{who has been a}} Madonna fan for years, was [...] "beyond surprised" [...] when she heard Madonna's verse. She said [...] "I just asked her to do a little thing, but she really went there. She did a lot of stuff to it." [...] Jive Records hoped [...] "Outrageous" [...] would be released as the first single from the album, but Spears pushed for [...] "Me Against the Music". After she performed the song {{for the first time at}} the 2003 NFL Kickoff Live, Spears refused to answer if it was the first single from the album, but said that [...] "there are some surprises that <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> up in the song that I'm really excited about." [...] On September 16, 2003, it was confirmed that [...] "Me Against the Music" [...] would be released as the first single from In the Zone.|$|E
2500|$|After the 2008 {{nomination}} of Sarah Palin for Vice President of the United States, senior pastor Ed Kalnins' preaching was scrutinized by the media. His sermons were {{available on the}} church website. USA Today reported the Huffington Post assertion that [...] "Kalnins has preached that critics of President Bush will be banished to hell; questioned whether {{people who voted for}} Sen. John Kerry in 2004 would be accepted into heaven; and preached that the Sept. 11 attacks and the war in Iraq were part of a world war over Christianity". Kalnins preached [...] "I believe that Alaska is one of the refuge states... in the Last Days, {{and hundreds of thousands of}} people <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to this state to seek refuge. And the church has to ready to minister to them".|$|E

2500|$|The comedian/lyricist Tom Lehrer penned {{a number}} of humorous and well known songs {{relating}} to nuclear weapons. His song Who's Next? took {{up the issue of}} nuclear proliferation, chronicling the acquisition of nuclear weapons by various nations, then theorizing on [...] "Who's Next," [...] ending with Luxembourg, Monaco, and Alabama becoming nuclear powers, while We Will All Go Together When We Go looked at the brighter side of nuclear holocaust (not having to mourn over the death of others, since [...] "if the bomb that drops on you gets your friends and neighbors too, there'll be nobody left behind to grieve"). It assumes that the entire planet will be instantaneously wiped clean by nuclear fire, and bypasses the much grimmer idea of radiation poisoning. [...] A third song by Lehrer, So Long Mom (A Song From World War III), was introduced as existing because, [...] "If any songs <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out of World War III, we had better start writing them now," [...] and tells the tale of a young soldier marching off to nuclear war, promising his mother that [...] "Although I may roam, I'll come back to my home/ Although it may be a pile of debris" [...] and also satirizing the likely extremely short duration of a major nuclear war ("And I'll look for you when the war is over/ An hour and a half from now!").|$|E
2500|$|Framton Nuttel, {{a nervous}} man, {{has come to}} stay in the country for his health. His sister, who thinks he should socialise while he is there, has given him letters of {{introduction}} to families in the neighbourhood whom she got to know when she was staying there a few years previously. Framton goes to visit Mrs Sappleton and, while he is waiting for her to come down, is entertained by her fifteen-year-old, witty niece. The niece tells him that the French window is kept open, even though it is October, because Mrs Sappleton believes that her husband and her brothers, who were drowned in a bog three years before, will come back one day. When Mrs Sappleton comes down she talks about her husband and her brothers, and how they <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back from shooting soon, and Framton, believing that she is deranged, tries to [...] distract her by talking about his health. Then, to his horror, Mrs Sappleton points out that her husband and her brothers are coming, and he sees them walking towards the window with their dog. He thinks he is seeing ghosts and runs away. Mrs Sappleton cannot understand why he has run away and, when her husband and her brothers come in, she tells them about the odd man who has just left. The niece explains that Framton Nuttel ran away because of the spaniel: he is afraid of dogs since he was hunted by a pack of stray dogs in India and had to spend a night in the newly dug grave with creatures grinning and foaming just above him. The last line summarizes the story, saying of the niece, [...] "Romance at short notice was her speciality." ...|$|E

But they have lost the art of altogether damming up the road in such cases between the author and the public, which they were once able to do as effectually as Diabolus in John Bunyan's Holy War closed up the windows of my Lord Understanding's mansion. I am sure of one thing, that you have only to be known to the British public to be admired by them, and I would not say so unless I really was of that opinion.|$|E
6000|$|This gentleman's {{article is}} an able one (as {{articles}} go, in the French, where they always tangle up everything to that degree {{that when you}} start into a sentence you never know whether you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out alive or not). It {{is a very good}} article and the writer says all manner of kind and complimentary things about me--for which I am sure I thank him with all my heart; but then why should he go and spoil all his praise by one unlucky experiment? What I refer to is this: he says my Jumping Frog is a funny story, but still he can't see why it should ever really convulse any one with laughter--and straightway proceeds to translate it into French in order to prove to his nation that there is nothing so very extravagantly funny about it. Just there is where my complaint originates. He has not translated it at all; he has simply mixed it all up; it is no more like the Jumping Frog when he gets through with it than I am like a meridian of longitude. But my mere assertion is not proof; wherefore I print the French version, that all may see that I do not speak falsely; furthermore, in order that even the unlettered may know my injury and give me their compassion, I have been at infinite pains and trouble to retranslate this French version back into English; and to tell the truth I have well-nigh worn myself out at it, having scarcely rested from my work during five days and nights. I cannot speak the French language, but I can translate very well, though not fast, I being self-educated. I ask the reader to run his eye over the original English version of the Jumping Frog, and then read the French or my retranslation, and kindly take notice how the Frenchman has riddled the grammar. I think it is the worst I ever saw; and yet the French are called a polished nation. If I had a boy that put sentences together as they do, I would polish him to some purpose. Without further introduction, the Jumping Frog, as I originally wrote it, was as follows [after it will be found the French version, and after the latter my retranslation from the French] ...|$|E
