Stowe compares the dog and the people who care for such stray animals to Christian ideals {{to take care of the}} poor and suffering.|$|E

Though diversified in style, they are united by a common function. As cathedrals, each of these buildings serves as central church for an administrative region (or diocese) and houses the throne of a bishop (cathedra, from the Greek).

Though she {{was expected to}} cede power to Francis and Joseph, {{both of whom were}} officially her co-rulers in Austria and Bohemia, Maria Theresa was the absolute sovereign who ruled with the counsel of her advisers. She criticised and disapproved of many of Joseph's actions.

5|$|The {{king and}} queen were not pleased with married life. The royal couple enjoyed periods of calm <b>and</b> <b>affection,</b> but Anne refused to play the {{submissive}} role expected of her. The vivacity and opinionated intellect that had made her so attractive as an illicit lover made her too independent for the largely ceremonial role of a royal wife and it made her many enemies. For his part, Henry disliked Anne's constant irritability and violent temper. After a false pregnancy or miscarriage in 1534, he saw her failure {{to give him a}} son as a betrayal. As early as Christmas 1534, Henry was discussing with Cranmer and Cromwell the chances of leaving Anne without having to return to Catherine. Henry is traditionally believed to have had an affair with Margaret ("Madge") Shelton in 1535, although historian Antonia Fraser argues that Henry in fact had an affair with her sister Mary Shelton.|$|E
