50|$|In a {{microbial}} process employing an auxotrophic <b>mutant</b> (nutritionally <b>requiring</b> <b>mutant),</b> {{excess supply}} of the required nutrient results in abundant cell growth with little accumulation of the desired metabolite due to feedback inhibition and /or end-product repression.

In addition, P- 28 - 24 C was found to carry a mutation conferring slow growth that lies in CYR 1, which encodes adenylate cyclase, and the slow growth phenotype caused by the cyr 1 mutation was suppressed by the pde 2 mutation.

40|$|To help {{understand}} how the tif- 1 mutation of the recA gene of Escherichia coli confers adenine activability on the recA protein, we used the fact that cytidine plus guanosine inhibits induction of prophage lambda and cell filamentation in a tif- 1 mutant, and that adenine reverses this inhibition. We varied the amount of adenine in agar plates containing a fixed amount of cytidine and scored for survivors of three different tif-dependent lethal induction processes. Much more <b>adenine</b> was <b>required</b> for cell killing when cytidine was present than when it was absent. Therefore adenine does not override cytidine inhibition, but instead appears to compete with it for a site of action which {{may be on the}} recA protein. The competition is not at the cell transport level. Our results lead to a model in which the tif form of the recA protein is an allosteric enzyme that binds both negative and positive modulators. By varying the adenine-cytidine ratio of the medium it is possible to control the degree of induction in a tif- 1 cell. For the three different tif-dependent inductions studied here, least <b>adenine</b> was <b>required</b> for lambda induction and most for lethal filamentation, presumably reflecting requirements for different amounts of activated recA protein in each process. Varying the adenine-cytidine ratio revealed two stable intermediate stages in lambda induction, as well as a stage of colicin E 1 induction in which the cells produced colicin without cell death. The rate of filament formation could be similarly controlled.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Hereditary {{neutropenia}} usually {{results from}} heterozygous germline mutations of ELANE, encoding neutrophil elastase (NE). How mutations cause disease remains uncertain. Two hypotheses have been proposed. In one, ELANE mutations lead to mislocalization of NE. In the other, ELANE mutations disturb protein folding, inducing an unfolded protein response (UPR) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Here we describe {{new types of}} mutations disrupting the translational start site. At first glance, they should block translation and are incompatible with either the mislocalization or misfolding hypotheses, which <b>require</b> <b>mutant</b> protein for pathogenicity. We find that start site mutations, instead, force translation from downstream, in-frame initiation codons, yielding amino-terminally truncated isoforms lacking ER-localizing (pre) and zymogen-maintaining (pro) sequences, yet retain essential catalytic residues. Patient-derived {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} (iPSC) recapitulate hematopoietic and molecular phenotypes. Expression of the amino-terminally deleted isoforms in vitro reduces myeloid cell clonogenic capacity. We define an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) within ELANE and demonstrate that adjacent mutations modulate IRES activity, independently of protein-coding sequence alterations. Some ELANE mutations therefore appear to cause neutropenia via production of amino-terminally deleted NE isoforms rather than by altering the coding sequence of the full-length protein...|$|R

Despite its wide {{distribution}} among living organisms, {{the presence of}} CA in fungi has been controversially discussed. Using mass spectrometric analysis of (18) O exchange from doubly labelled CO(2), {{we were able to}} measure CA activity in intact cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Intracellular CA activity was lacking in the Deltance 103 mutant, indicating that NCE 103 encodes a functional CA. This was proven by overexpressing and purification of the NCE 103 gene product showing a specific activity of around 6900 units per mg protein. Interestingly, the in vivo CA activity was 10 - 20 times higher in cells grown on low inorganic carbon (Ci; air containing 0. 035 % CO(2)) than in high-Ci cells (grown on 5 % CO(2)). The enhanced CA activity of low-Ci cells was inducible after transferring high-Ci cells to air. Northern blot analysis revealed that that expression of NCE 103 is transcriptionally regulated by low Ci which was also demonstrated by fusing the NCE 103 promoter to beta-galactosidase as a reporter gene.

40|$|Abstract Background Antibiotic {{resistance}} {{genes are}} widely used for selection of recombinant bacteria, but their use risks contributing {{to the spread of}} antibiotic resistance. In particular, the practice is inappropriate for some intrinsically resistant bacteria and in vaccine production, and costly for industrial scale production. Non-antibiotic systems are available, but <b>require</b> <b>mutant</b> host strains, defined media or expensive reagents. An unexplored concept is over-expression of a host essential gene to enable selection {{in the presence of a}} chemical inhibitor of the gene product. To test this idea in E. coli, we used the growth essential target gene fabI as the plasmid-borne marker and the biocide triclosan as the selective agent. Results The new cloning vector, pFab, enabled selection by triclosan at 1 μM. Interestingly, pFab out-performed the parent pUC 19 -ampicillin system in cell growth, plasmid stability and plasmid yield. Also, pFab was toxic to host cells in a way that was reversed by triclosan. Therefore, pFab and triclosan are toxic when used alone but in combination they enhance growth and plasmid production through a gene-inhibitor interaction. Conclusion The fabI -triclosan model system provides an alternative plasmid selection method based on essential gene over-expression, without the use of antibiotic-resistance genes and conventional antibiotics. </p...|$|R

In SPROX the differential denaturant dependence of a methionine oxidation reaction in proteins performed in the presence {{and in the absence}} of ligand is used to measure the thermodynamic properties of protein-ligand binding interactions. Recently, the SPROX technique has also been used with quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomic strategies to simultaneously assay up to hundreds of different proteins in complex biological samples. The proteomic applications of SPROX, to date, have relied on the use of a methionine-containing-peptide enhancement strategy and 1 -D liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and. The strategies presented here, including gel electrophoresis fractionation and gas-phase fractionation of derivatized methionine-containing peptides, aim to increase proteomic coverage in SPROX by facilitating the detection, identification, and quantitation of methionine-containing peptides in the proteomics experiment. The initial results obtained in this work have shown that gel electrophoresis can help increase the proteome coverage while identifying complementary peptides to the current solution-based SPROX analysis. A gas-phase fractionation strategy is also demonstrated; however, the mass spectrometric analysis needs to be optimized and further tested to achieve selectivity for methionine peptides. Both of these fractionation strategies show promise for improving the proteomic coverage in SPROX studies of protein-ligand interactions on the proteomic scale. In addition, the previously established SPROX protocol using isobaric mass tags was used in two protein-ligand binding experiments, including one experiment to identify the protein targets in a yeast cell lysate of adenosine 5 '-(&# 946;,&# 947;-imido) triphosphate (AMP-PNP), a non-hydrolyzable adenosine- 5 '-triphosphate (ATP) mimic, and second experiment to investigate the protein targets of two iron chelators, deferasirox (Exjade) and N'-[1 -(2 hydroxyphenyl) ethyliden]isonicotinoylhydrazide (HAPI), both of which protect ARPE- 19 cells from oxidative damage induced by hydrogen peroxide.

Methods of degradation and chromatography have been used to identify with reasonable certainty three crystalline products as 4 -(D-erythro-trihydroxypropyl) -imidazole, 4 -(2 -keto- 3 -hydroxypropyl) -imidazole and L- 4 -(2 -amino- 3 -hydroxypropyl) -imidazole (L-histidinol). Evidence is presented to show that two other non-crystalline products are phosphate esters of the trihydroxy and the ketohydroxy compounds. Chromatographic evidence is presented which indicates two other compounds are imidazole acetic acid and 4 -(2, 3 -dihydroxypropyl) -imidazole. A chemical synthesis of isomers of 4 -(trihydroxypropyl) -imizadole is described. The trihydroxy, ketohydroxy, and aminohydroxy compounds have been placed in that order leading to histidine, {{on the basis of the}} sequence of the mutants and the accumulations by the double mutants. Evidence is discussed suggesting that the phosphate esters of these compounds are more likely to be the true precursors of histidine. A scheme is postulated for the relation of all these substances to histidine synthesis and the possibility that a pentose- 5 -phosphate may be an early precursor of histidine is discussed. A method for the paper chromatography of imidazoles is presented and the Rf values of numerous synthetic derivatives are given...|$|R
