5|$|Despite {{being one}} of the few major {{thoroughfares}} in Rome able to cope with a high volume of traffic without congestion, it is the subject of much ire both within the Roman community and among historical scholars due to the circumstances under which it was constructed. The area around the church was rebuilt several times following the various Sacks of Rome, and again after having deteriorated due to the loss of prosperity resulting from the Papacy's relocation to Avignon during the 14th century. Through all of these reconstructions, the area in front of the short courtyard of Saint Peter's Basilica remained <b>a</b> <b>maze</b> <b>of</b> densely packed structures overhanging narrow side-streets and alleyways.|$|E
5|$|The player uses a {{joystick}} to control Pac-Man, navigating him through <b>a</b> <b>maze</b> <b>of</b> consumable dashes called Video Wafers,  opposed by {{a quartet of}} multi-colored ghosts. The goal {{of the game is}} to consume all the wafers in each level in order to proceed to the next one in search of the highest possible score. The four ghosts roam the maze, trying to kill Pac-Man. If any of the ghosts touches Pac-Man, he loses a life; when all lives have been lost, the game ends. Each game starts with four lives, and the player is awarded a bonus life upon successful completion of each level, up to a maximum of nine lives in reserve at any given time.|$|E
5|$|After {{breaking}} {{out from his}} prison, Brad falls into a moat before coming {{to a halt in}} <b>a</b> <b>maze</b> <b>of</b> an underground cavern. Reaching the surface, he arrives at a nearby village; this location is repeatedly revisited throughout the game, as Brad comes back there after traveling to the various corners of the land, encountering bizarre characters and experiencing absurd adventures: the Edge of the World cliff, the Ice Palace, and the Valley of the Lost (a place where all kinds of things lost on Earth have gone to), all while searching for an unlikely set of items that would help him emerge victorious from the game's final showdown (including a fire extinguisher and a mechanical fan). In the end, the boy enters the evil Queen's castle to find and defeat her once and for all. Once she is no more, he gets instantly transported back to the baseball field where it all had started.|$|E

5|$|During the 1950s, various {{computer}} games {{were created in}} the context of academic computer and programming research and for demonstrations of computing power, especially after the introduction later in the decade of smaller and faster computers on which programs could be created and run in real time as opposed to being executed in batches. A few programs, however, while used to showcase the power of the computer they ran on were also intended as entertainment products; these were generally created by undergraduate and graduate students and university employees, such as at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) where they were allowed on occasion to develop programs for the TX-0 experimental computer. These interactive graphical games were created by a community of programmers, many of them students and university employees affiliated with the Tech Model Railroad Club (TMRC) led by Alan Kotok, Peter Samson, and Bob Saunders. The games included Tic-Tac-Toe, which used a light pen to play a simple game of noughts and crosses against the computer, and Mouse in the Maze, which used a light pen to set up <b>a</b> <b>maze</b> <b>of</b> walls for a virtual mouse to traverse.|$|E
5|$|Goosebumps {{has spawned}} merchandise, {{including}} T-shirts, board games, puzzles, hats, fake skulls, dolls, bike helmets, fake blood, and boxer shorts. Goosebumps was also adapted into a stage play by Rupert Holmes in 1998 and a stage musical by John Maclay and Danny Abosch in 2016. Goosebumps has an official website, which garners 1.5 million page views each month as of 2008. An attraction {{based on the}} series, the Goosebumps HorrorLand Fright Show and FunHouse, opened in October 1997 at Disney-MGM Studios's New York Street. Before it closed, the attraction consisted of a stage play which featured characters from the series; this show played five times a day. The attraction also featured a funhouse, called the Goosebumps HorrorLand Hall of Mirrors, which contained <b>a</b> <b>maze</b> <b>of</b> mirrors along with other props and gags from the series. In 2008, {{it was announced that}} Sally Corporation would market Goosebumps rides.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{back in the}} restaurant, the {{waitress}} returns to find the woman missing. Believing that the woman has left without paying the bill, she angrily crumples and throws the woman's comic book into a bin. This makes the hero's two opposing racers reappear, armed with a large pipe wrench. The racers smash the looking glass with the pipe wrench, trapping {{the woman in the}} comic book. The hero punches one of the thugs and retreats with the woman into <b>a</b> <b>maze</b> <b>of</b> paper. Arriving at a dead end, he tears a hole in the paper wall so that the woman can escape as the menacing opposing racers close in on him. The woman, now back in the real world and found lying beside the bin to the surprise of restaurant guests and staff, retrieves the comic from the bin and runs home, where she attempts to smooth out the creases to learn what happens next.|$|E

5|$|A film studio set {{was created}} by photographing several reel spools with strips of film {{dangling}} {{against a background of}} blinking lights. The casting office {{was created by}} silhouetting strips of cardboard against a white background. To portray the mental anguish of the protagonist, strips of paper were cut into the shape of twisted trees, which were silhouetted against a background of moving shadows and set in motion with an electric fan. To create a scene {{near the end of the}} film, when the protagonist starts becoming delirious, the camera moves through <b>a</b> <b>maze</b> <b>of</b> different sized cubes, with geometric designs inside them, all placed on a flat, shiny service. The heaven setting was also a miniature set created from paper cubes, tin cans, cigar boxes, toy trains, and a motorized Erector Set. No still photos were taken for the film, but illustrations showing prism and kaleidoscope effects have been made by enlarging frames of negative. The paper prints were considerably softer than the movie print in order to avoid graininess. The final film was edited to a one-reel length of 1,200 feet of film strip, featuring about 150 scenes. Florey said it featured the same number of angles as full-length feature films of the time. Although the film was carefully edited to be synchronized with Rhapsody in Blue, much of the original lyrical quality has been lost in shortened and modified versions of the film.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} {{is located in}} the district of St Giles, a short distance to the east of the east end of Oxford Street. The area was once notorious for being one of the worst slums in London, known as the Rookery – <b>a</b> <b>maze</b> <b>of</b> ramshackle houses, alleys and courtyards inhabited by thousands of destitute people. It was famously depicted by William Hogarth in his 1751 print Gin Lane. Central Saint Giles stands on the site of St Giles Court, an office development originally erected in the 1950s for the Ministry of Supply and latterly used by the Ministry of Defence (MOD). It consisted of a series of linked brick blocks of six to eight storeys high, arranged in an S-shape around two inner courtyards to which there was no public access. The grim appearance of St Giles Court contributed to the area becoming a magnet for prostitutes and the homeless. The building was owned by Legal & General but was occupied by the MOD on a lease that was not due to expire until 2011. However, {{at the start of the}} 21st century the MOD began undertaking a process of reducing its London estate and discontinued the use of several buildings in the capital, including St Giles Court. It vacated the building in April 2005.|$|E

5000|$|The {{game was}} started by one {{designated}} [...] "master" [...] machine, which set rules, divided players into teams, and selected <b>a</b> <b>maze.</b> <b>A</b> number <b>of</b> <b>mazes</b> were supplied with the game, and additional mazes could be constructed using a simple text-editor or one of various third-party tools. The game was very popular at gatherings of Atari ST users {{until the end of}} the Atari ST era, circa 1993.|$|R

25|$|Diyu is {{the realm}} of the dead in Chinese mythology. It is very loosely based upon the Buddhist concept of Naraka {{combined}} with traditional Chinese afterlife beliefs and a variety of popular expansions and re-interpretations of these two traditions.

Bodson would fire his revolver if he needed assistance.|$|E
25|$|Sturt then {{proceeded}} down the Murray, {{until he reached}} the river's confluence with the Darling. Sturt had now proved that all the western-flowing rivers eventually flowed into the Murray. In February 1830, the party reached a large lake which Sturt called Lake Alexandrina. A few days later, they reached the sea. There they made the disappointing discovery that the mouth of the Murray was <b>a</b> <b>maze</b> <b>of</b> lagoons and sandbars, impassable to shipping.|$|E

25|$|As {{one expects}} of a capital city, Brussels is {{the hub of}} a range of old {{national}} roads, the main ones being clockwise: the N1 (N to Breda), N2 (E to Maastricht), N3 (E to Aachen), N4 (SE to Luxembourg) N5 (S to Rheims), N6 (S to Maubeuge), N7 (SW to Lille), N8 (W to Koksijde) and N9 (NW to Ostend). Usually named chaussées/steenwegen, these highways normally run in a straight line, but sometimes lose themselves in <b>a</b> <b>maze</b> <b>of</b> narrow shopping streets.|$|E
25|$|Porto Alegre {{has a long}} {{coastline}} on the Guaíba Lake, and its topography is {{punctuated by}} 40 hills. In the lake, a vast body of water, <b>a</b> <b>maze</b> <b>of</b> islands facing the city creates an archipelago where a unique ecosystem gives shelter to abundant wildlife. The city area concentrates 28% of the native flora of Rio Grande do Sul, with 9,288 species. Among these, there are many trees which are the vestiges of the Atlantic Forest. Fauna are also diversified, specially in the islands and hills. The Portoalegrense environs include many parks, squares and wooded streets.|$|E
25|$|Aydın {{city centre}} is still {{relatively}} small but growing, centred on one palm-lined avenue of shops and cafes, and <b>a</b> <b>maze</b> <b>of</b> narrow side streets, dotted with orange trees. The people are traditional and family-oriented, {{so there is}} little night life, or cultural amenities for young people, although presumably now they have a university this will change. There {{are a number of}} mosques, high schools, dersane (private courses cramming students for the university entrance exams) and other public buildings. Like all Turkish cities Aydın is now spreading as the middle-classes are leaving their flats in the city for smarter apartments or houses slightly out of town.|$|E
