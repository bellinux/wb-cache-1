40|$|The most {{suitable}} and generalized neural network {{that represents the}} control system dynamics is the Elman Neural Network (ENN). This is due to its ability to memorize and emulate the system states. Moreover, ENNs learned by Genetic algorithms {{are found to be}} more representative to system order in terms of its structural complexity in comparison to those learned by back propagation algorithm. This facility is utilized efficiently to find the minimum ENN structure that represents the discrete-time state space model of the DC motor. Then by comparing the ENN weights with the well-known discrete-time state space equation in terms of the motor physical parameters (moment of inertia, torque constant, <b>armature</b> <b>inductance,</b> etc.), these parameters can be obtained...|$|E
40|$|A test {{equipment}} for determination of magnetic characteristics {{of different kinds}} of electrical machines is presented. Experimental determination of magnetic characteristics of electrical machines should be understood, according to the machine studied, as determination of their corresponding inductances or as determination of their magnetization curves (flux-linkage versus current for different rotor positions). The {{test equipment}} is based on a method of measurement of inductance by means of D. C. current, proposed by C. V. Jones, in which a bridge arrangement is used in order to eliminate the resistance effects. This equipment is able to obtain <b>armature</b> <b>inductance</b> in DCM (direct current motor), d-axis and q-axis inductance in SPSM (salient-pole synchronous machine) or SYNCREL (synchronous reluctance motor) and magnetization curves of SRM with a good accuracy and in an automatic way. The main advantage of this setup is that it is an automatic system controlled by PC, that allows magnetic characteristics of almost any electrical machine to be obtained, reducing measurement time and manual errors and providing easy and user friendly presentation of the test results. Several examples of experimental determination of magnetic characteristics using the proposed equipment are shown proving their test capabilities. Postprint (published version...|$|E

5000|$|In {{a circuit}} {{known as a}} chopper, the average voltage applied to the motor is varied by {{switching}} the supply voltage very rapidly. As the [...] "on" [...] to [...] "off" [...] ratio is varied to alter the average applied voltage, {{the speed of the}} motor varies. The percentage [...] "on" [...] time multiplied by the supply voltage gives the average voltage applied to the motor. Therefore, with a 100 V supply and a 25% [...] "on" [...] time, the average voltage at the motor will be 25 V. During the [...] "off" [...] time, the <b>armature's</b> <b>inductance</b> causes the current to continue through a diode called a [...] "flyback diode", in parallel with the motor. At this point in the cycle, the supply current will be zero, and therefore the average motor current will always be higher than the supply current unless the percentage [...] "on" [...] time is 100%. At 100% [...] "on" [...] time, the supply and motor current are equal. The rapid switching wastes less energy than series resistors. This method is also called pulse-width modulation (PWM) and is often controlled by a microprocessor. An output filter is sometimes installed to smooth the average voltage applied to the motor and reduce motor noise.|$|R
40|$|Design of {{electric}} motors which fulfill {{the needs of}} Thrust Vector Control (TVC) actuators used in large rocket propelled launch vehicles is covered. To accomplish this end the methodology of design is laid out in some detail. In addition a point design of a motor {{to fulfill the requirements}} of a certain actuator specified by MSFC is accomplished and reported upon. In the course of this design great stress has been placed on ridding the actuator of internally generated heat. To conduct the heat out of the motor use is made of the unique properties of the in house MSFC designed driving electronics. This property is that as along as they are operated in a quasi-linear mode the electronics nullify the effects of <b>armature</b> <b>inductance</b> as far as the phase of the armature current versus the rotor position is concerned. Actually the additional inductance due to the extended end turns in this design is of benefit because in the shorted armature failure mode the armature current in the fault (caused by the rotor flux sweeping past the armature) is diminished at a given rotor speed when compared to a more conventional motor with lower inductance. The magnetic circuit is analyzed using electromagnetic finite element methods...|$|E
40|$|For grid integration, a low-frequency (i. e. 50 or 60 Hz) {{transformer}} {{is placed}} inside the nacelle of the {{offshore wind turbine}} to step-up the voltage to the grid voltage levels of 11 – 33 kV. The heave weight and large size of the step-up transformer significantly increase the weight and volume of the turbine. These penalties are critical in offshore applications, where cost of installation and regular maintenance are extremely high. As an alternative approach to achieve a compact and lightweight offshore and onshore wind turbine a medium voltage converter is proposed. The converter modules are cascaded to achieve medium voltage output. Each converter module is fed {{by a pair of}} generator coils with 90 phase shift to get the stable dc-link power. The power factor correction (PFC) circuit enables the generator to achieve unity power factor operation and the generator <b>armature</b> <b>inductance</b> is used as ac-side PFC boost inductance. At the grid-side, H-bridge inverters are connected in series to generate multilevel medium voltage output and the voltage-oriented vector control scheme is adopted to regulate the converter active and reactive power transferred to the grid. This new technology will enable transformer-less compact and lightweight turbine design, and has a great potential to be implemented in the future offshore wind farms and smart grid applications.

Finally, several designs from the Pareto-optimal fronts are validated using Finite Element Analysis (FEA). ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This work {{describes}} a model-reference adaptive system (MRAS) for the speed estimation of induction motor from terminal voltages and currents. The estimated speed {{is used as}} feedback in a vector control system, thus achieving good bandwidth for speed control {{without the use of}} shaft-mounted sensors. This technique uses for controlling induction Motor using Vector control. Simulation has been done in Matlab software. In MATLAB, Due to Embedded Legacy C source code can be verified through simulation with this legacy code as controller and plant model in simulink block diagram. In vector control, accuracy of internal parameter such as resister of motor <b>armature</b> and <b>inductance</b> affects control performance.

50|$|The counter-emf aids the {{armature}} resistance {{to limit the}} current through {{the armature}}. When power is first applied to a motor, the armature does not rotate. At that instant the counter-emf is zero and the only factor limiting the armature current is the <b>armature</b> resistance and <b>inductance.</b> Usually the <b>armature</b> resistance of a motor is less than 1 Ω; therefore the current through the armature would be very large when the power is applied. This current can make an excessive voltage drop affecting other equipment in the circuit and even trip overload protective devices.|$|R
40|$|Often helical flux-compressor {{generator}} (FCG) {{design codes}} are essentially circuit codes which utilize known equations for parameterizing circuit {{elements such as}} <b>armature</b> and stator <b>inductance.</b> The authors present an analytical model that is based more on first principals. The stator inductance is calculated using a definition of inductance {{in terms of the}} magnetic vector-potential. The calculation accounts for winding-pitch, bifurcations, and works for any ratio of length to diameter. The currents on the armature are calculated self-consistently and are not assumed to simply 'mirror' the stator currents. Resistive losses and magnetic diffusion losses are calculated less rigorously but they are working on better methods. Details of the model and comparison with experiment will be presented...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Permanent Magnet PMDC motors have {{outstanding}} performance {{for use in}} many modern applications like automated manufacturing systems, automobiles, office machine drives, tools and medical equipment. To control these motors, speed sensors are indispensable. A sensorless control scheme using an observeris proposed. However, this sensorless control method uses motor parameters to estimate speed, and hence estimation error is caused by parameters variations. That is why,an effective and simple on-line parameter identification scheme is proposed to estimate <b>armature</b> resistance and <b>inductance</b> of the motor. The identification method is developed {{based on the fact}} that, in practice PM flux-linkage is constant. An adaptive control method is proposed to control PMDC motor speed to maintain speed estimation accuracy. Simulation results are included to prove the effectiveness of the overall control system under different operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|An {{adaptive}} control scheme for robot manipulators including motor dynamics is proposed in this paper. The proposed scheme avoids {{the assumption that}} the values of motor parameters are known which is required in reference (13). An exponential control law is first developed under the assumption of no uncertainty. This forms a controller structure for the {{adaptive control}}. Using this control structure, a full-order adaptive control law is proposed to overcome parameter uncertainty for both robot link and motor. The stability analysis is in the Lyapunov stability sense. The method is further extended to the task space. Extensive simulations are performed to compare the direrent control schemes.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The thesis describes an optimal selective harmonic elimination strategy suitable for singlephase AC-DC converter-fed traction drives. The objective is to eliminate low-order supply current harmonics, including those injected into the supply due to load-side current ripple. Other advantages that the switching strategy has to offer over phase-control include improved supply power factor, reduced VA consumption for a given demand speed and load, reduced torque and speed ripple and smaller <b>armature</b> circuit smoothing <b>inductance.</b> The effect of field current boost on the dynamic response of the drive is also described. It is shown that field boost helps to reduce the speed rise-time by increasing the electromagnetic torque available during acceleration periods. Closed-loop control of a 4 -quadrant DC drive is described and a comparison made between the performance of PID-control and pseudo-derivative feedback control. It is shown that pseudo-derivative feedback control has several advantages to offer, amongst which are ease of tuning of the controller gains and a superior performance following load torque disturbances. A laboratory size drive system was designed and built, and used to validate simulation predictions for both the switching strategy and pseudo-derivative feedback control. A microcontroller based hardware implementation of both the switching strategy and a digital pseudo-derivative feedback controller was adopted, with the switching strategy being implemented using an off-line approach of precalculating the switching angles and storing these in look-up tables. The armature voltage controller comprises a dual-converter employing IGBTs as switching devices. The use of IGBTs allows higher switching frequencies at significant power levels than would be possible if GTOs were used. It also simplifies the gate drive circuit design and minimises the need to use snubber circuits...|$|R
