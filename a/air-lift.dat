2500|$|Jellyfish are {{not adapted}} to closed spaces. They depend on {{currents}} to transport them {{from place to}} place. Professional exhibits feature precise water flows, typically in circular tanks to avoid trapping specimens in corners. The Monterey Bay Aquarium uses {{a modified version of}} the kreisel (German for [...] "spinning top") for this purpose. The outflow is spread out over a large surface area and the inflow enters as a sheet of water in front of the outflow, so the jellyfish do not get sucked into it. As of 2009, jellyfish were becoming popular in home aquariums. These home aquariums generate this special water flow pattern using an <b>air-lift</b> pump and require special food for the jellyfish, which can be shipped from suppliers to their final destination.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the same}} evening, the Hellenic Air Force {{commenced}} a clandestine <b>air-lift</b> operation (Operation Niki) using fifteen Noratlas aircraft (354 Squadron [...] "Pegasus") {{in an effort}} to transport a battalion of commandos from Souda, Crete to Cyprus. However, the aircraft were erroneously engaged by Greek Cypriot anti-aircraft guns of the 195 MEA/AP battalion at Nicosia International Airport, and the 3rd Noratlas was shot down with the loss of four crew and 29 commandos. A further two Noratlas planes were also badly shot up, and forced to make hard landings, at which point the mistake was realised. Some of the remaining planes were able to make safe landings and offload their troops and equipment, resulting in a Greek contingent available to defend the airport. This unit was the A Commando, later given the Greek Cypriot designation 35MK Commando.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1915 a joint LEE/TEE {{company was}} formed for service in France, {{designated}} No 1 (London and Tyne) Electrical & Mechanical Company, RE. It assembled at the LEE's HQ in London, and landed at Le Havre on 15 December, {{where it was}} attached to General Headquarters (GHQ) of the BEF. It carried out a variety of duties, ranging from installing electric lighting for hospitals, water pumps and laundry equipment, to erecting a printing works and building a trench locomotive. After the Battle of the Somme {{it was decided to}} form an E & M Company for each of the Armies of the BEF and the London & Tyne Company was split to form 351 Company (Second Army) and 354 Company (Fifth Army). 354 Company was later responsible for the development of <b>air-lift</b> and belt water pumps to supply drinking water. During the German Spring Offensive of 1918, 351 and 354 E [...] Companies were entrusted with destroying electrical installations and water supplies ahead of the advancing enemy. These then had to be replaced during the Hundred Days advance.|$|E
2500|$|In 1927 Fuller {{resolved}} to think independently {{which included a}} commitment to [...] "the search for the principles governing the universe and help advance the evolution of humanity in accordance with them... finding ways of doing more with less to the end that all people everywhere can have more and more." [...] By 1928, Fuller was living in Greenwich Village and spending {{much of his time}} at the popular café Romany Marie's, [...] "Only two years before, on the brink of suicide, Fuller had decided to remake his life and the world. Why not begin on Minetta Street? In 1929, he was shopping around his first major design, plans for an inexpensive, modular home that others <b>air-lift</b> right where desired. Now, in exchange for meals, he took on the interior decoration and chairs for Marie's new location. He must have stood out in person, too, ever the talkative, handsome visionary in tie and starched collar." [...] See also: }} where he had spent an evening in conversation with Marie and Eugene O'Neill several years earlier. Fuller accepted a job decorating the interior of the café in exchange for meals, giving informal lectures several times a week, and models of the Dymaxion house were exhibited at the café. Isamu Noguchi arrived during 1929—Constantin Brâncuși, an old friend of Marie's, had directed him there—and Noguchi and Fuller were soon collaborating on several projects, including the modeling of the Dymaxion car based on recent work by Aurel Persu. It was the beginning of their lifelong friendship.|$|E

50|$|During November 1984, U.S.N.S. Hassayampa was a {{participant}} in FLEETEX 85, a major exercise involving five aircraft carrier battlegroups and sixty-five ships from various countries. At one point during a consolidation operation with M/V Falcon Champion, a giant wave struck both vessels and forced Hassayampa seven degrees to port causing a near-collision between her and Falcon Champion. A significant amount of material damage was suffered by Hassayampa, in addition to three crewmembers having to be <b>air-lifted</b> at maximum helo range, to the aircraft carrier , two of which were further <b>air-lifted</b> to Japan for emergency medical treatment. By 1987, Hassayampa was well-versed in war effort management and was operating with Battle Group Echo.|$|R

50|$|In {{the years}} {{immediately}} after World War II, the Houdriflow process and the <b>air-lift</b> TCC process were developed as improved variations on the moving-bed theme. Just like Houdry's fixed-bed reactors, the moving-bed designs were prime examples of good engineering by developing a method of continuously moving the catalyst between the reactor and regeneration sections. The first <b>air-lift</b> TCC unit began operation in October 1950 at the Beaumont, Texas refinery.|$|E

40|$|Corneal {{epithelial}} {{stem cells}} {{are located in the}} basal layer of the limbus between the cornea and the conjunctiva. Regulation of these limbal epithelial progenitor cells by the stromal niche dictates corneal surface health. To further characterize this process, limbal explants were cultured at the air-fluid interface, termed <b>air-lifting,</b> to stimulate the niche. As compared to submerged cultures, <b>air-lifting</b> significantly promoted epithelial stratification, migration, proliferation, and intrastromal invasion by limbal epithelial cells. Epithelial intrastromal invasion was noted when the limbal, but not corneal, epithelium was recombined with the limbal stroma containing live, but not dead, cells. Invading limbal basal cells displayed up-regulated nuclear expression of p 63 and Ki 67, down-regulated E-cadherin and cornea-specific keratin 3, and switched expression of β-catenin from intercellular junctions to the nucleus and cytoplasm, indicating the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Invaded cells isolated by collagenase from the stroma of <b>air-lifted,</b> but not submerged, explants showed vivid clonal growth on 3 T 3 fibroblast feeder layers and complete epithelial-mesenchymal transition by expressing nuclear p 63 and cytoplasmic S 100 A 4. These findings collectively suggest that epithelial-mesenchymal transition via the Wnt/β-catenin pathway influences the fate of limbal epithelial cells, likely to be progenitor cells, between regeneration and fibrosis when the stromal niche is activated...|$|R

25|$|In 1975, the Israeli {{religious}} {{authorities and}} government recognized the Beta Israel of Ethiopia as legally Jewish. Hundreds {{of persons who}} wanted to emigrate to Israel were <b>air-lifted</b> {{under the leadership of}} Prime Minister Menachem Begin. Begin had obtained an official ruling from the Israeli Sephardi Chief Rabbi (or Rishon LeTzion) Ovadia Yosef that the Beta Israel were descendants of the Ten Lost Tribes. Rabbis believed they were probably descendants of the Tribe of Dan; rabbinical responsa discussing issues related to the people date back hundreds of years. With this endorsement, in later decades tens of thousands of Beta Israel Jews were <b>air-lifted</b> to Israel. Significant immigration to Israel continues into the 21st century, producing an Ethiopian Jewish community of around 81,000 immigrants, who with their 39,000 children born in Israel itself, numbered around 120,000 by early 2009.|$|R
