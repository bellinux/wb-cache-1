5|$|<b>A</b> <b>unilateral</b> ceasefire was {{announced}} on 10 August by the Georgian government. An intention {{to pull out}} Georgian troops from South Ossetia was stated by the Georgian government. However, Russia did not embrace this ceasefire offer. After the ceasefire agreement was negotiated by French president Nicolas Sarkozy on 12 August, military action was to cease at 15:00 on 12 August, however Russian forces didn't stop to advance.|$|E
5|$|It also {{provided}} for the Court of First Instance (now known as the General Court) to be based in Luxembourg with the Court of Justice, which remained there. However, this agreement dropped the provision from the 1965 decision, which gave priority to Luxembourg for any new judicial and financial bodies. In response, Luxembourg attached <b>a</b> <b>unilateral</b> declaration stating it did not renounce this article. However they did renounce any claim to {{the seat of the}} judicial Boards of Appeal of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market via the Treaty of Nice.|$|E
5|$|Shoup's {{opposition}} to the war only increased over time; he initially pushed for a negotiated settlement but later supported <b>a</b> <b>unilateral</b> pullout from the country. As the Vietnamization strategy took effect and the U.S. increased its air operations, he remained opposed to any strategy that risked a nuclear war with China or the Soviet Union. His criticism attracted more press as the war became a stalemate. It also became highly publicized through discourse among the anti-war movement.|$|E

5|$|While Mugabe was imprisoned, in August 1964, the Rhodesian Front government—now {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Ian Smith—banned ZANU and ZAPU and arrested all remaining leaders of the country's African nationalist movement. Smith's government made <b>a</b> <b>unilateral</b> declaration of independence from the United Kingdom in November 1965, renaming Southern Rhodesia as Rhodesia; the UK refused to recognise the legitimacy of this and imposed economic sanctions on the country.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, Prime Minister Ian Smith {{declared}} <b>a</b> <b>unilateral</b> {{independence that}} allowed the country's white minority to dominate the government. Great Britain pressured the Mexican state to deny Rhodesia {{an invitation to the}} 1968 Summer Olympics and supported a proposed African boycott of the Games that ultimately prevented Rhodesia from taking part. The nation was positioned to compete at the Olympics in 1972 and made it to the Olympic Village before a last-minute International Olympic Committee (IOC) decision barred its athletes from participating. The National Olympic Committee was expelled permanently in 1975 and Rhodesia never again participated under that banner. Rhodesia never took part in the Winter Olympic Games and no Rhodesian competitor ever won an Olympic medal, although it was able to continue competing at the Paralympics through 1972 and reached the podium on multiple occasions.|$|E
5|$|ZAPU members {{attempted}} to bomb or burn down {{the houses of}} blacks who joined or supported white-led political parties, {{as well as the}} churches they attended. Rival nationalists also used violence against each other as they jostled for prominence. In an attempt to restore confidence in the government and end the political intimidation, Smith cracked down hard on the militant nationalists, arresting political agitators in the townships for criminal offences and jailing ZAPU leader Joshua Nkomo in Gonakudzingwa Restriction Camp, a remote detention unit in the country's south-east. The British government, worried that Southern Rhodesia might issue <b>a</b> <b>unilateral</b> declaration of independence (UDI) rather than continue with negotiations, placed troops in Aden on alert.|$|E

5|$|Amid decolonisation and the Wind of Change, the Federation {{failed to}} become a Commonwealth realm and {{collapsed}} in 1963. Two years later, following prolonged dispute with Britain over the terms for full sovereignty, the mostly white government in Southern Rhodesia (or Rhodesia, following Northern Rhodesia's independence as Zambia) issued <b>a</b> <b>Unilateral</b> Declaration of Independence (UDI). The Rhodesian government, counting several World War II veterans including the Prime Minister Ian Smith, attempted to emphasise Rhodesians' prior war record on Britain's behalf by declaring independence on Armistice Day, 11 November, at 11:00 local time. As part of its subsequent isolation of Rhodesia, the UK government banned the post-UDI authorities from {{taking part in the}} annual Armistice Day service at the Cenotaph in London. Smith's government organised its own Rhodesian wreath-laying ceremony there. Veterans of World War II and Malaya held many key positions in the Rhodesian Security Forces during the Bush War of the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|In 2000 and 2001, Ijaz was {{involved}} in efforts to broker a ceasefire in Kashmir, the cause of multiple wars between India and Pakistan since independence. He {{held a series of}} meetings with senior Indian and Pakistani government officials as well as senior Kashmiri leaders in both Indian and Pakistani-held Kashmir from November 1999 until January 2001, traveling to India secretly on out-of-passport visas. Following months of clandestine negotiations between militant Kashmiri commander Abdul Majid Dar and A. S. Dulat, then-chief of India's intelligence directorate, Dar declared <b>a</b> <b>unilateral</b> ceasefire in the Himalayan enclave on July 25, 2000. The initial ceasefire was aborted by a hard-line militant faction within Dar's Hizbul Mujahideen, widely believed to have been supported by Pakistani intelligence. In order to gain Pakistani support for India's peace efforts in Kashmir, Ijaz met Gen. Pervez Musharraf in Islamabad in May 2000. Musharraf reluctantly agreed to back the ceasefire plan despite opposition from hardliners in the ranks of Pakistan's armed forces and intelligence services.|$|E
5|$|In January 1973, {{hope was}} renewed when the Paris Peace Accord was signed, ending the {{conflict}} (for the time being) in South Vietnam and Laos. On 29 January, Lon Nol proclaimed <b>a</b> <b>unilateral</b> cease-fire throughout the nation. All U.S. bombing operations were halted {{in hopes of}} securing a chance for peace. It was not to be. The Khmer Rouge simply ignored the proclamation and carried on fighting. By March, heavy casualties, desertions, and low recruitment had forced Lon Nol to introduce conscription and, in April, insurgent forces launched an offensive that pushed into the suburbs of the capital. The U.S. Air Force responded by launching an intense bombing operation that forced the communists back into the countryside after being decimated by the air strikes. The US Seventh Air Force argued that the bombing prevented the fall of Phnom Penh in 1973 by killing 16,000 of 25,500 Khmer Rouge fighters besieging the city.|$|E

5|$|Johnson's negotiators {{hoped to}} reach a truce in Vietnam prior to the election. Nixon {{received}} astute analysis on the talks from Henry Kissinger, then a consultant to U.S. negotiator Averell Harriman, and his campaign was in regular contact with Anna Chennault (at a July 1968 meeting in Nixon's New York apartment with South Vietnamese ambassador Bùi Diễm, he had been informed that Chennault would represent Nixon during the campaign). She advised South Vietnamese president Thieu {{not to go to}} Paris to join the talks, hinting that Nixon would give him a better deal if elected. Johnson was aware of what was going on, as he had both Chennault and the South Vietnamese ambassador to Washington bugged, and was enraged by what he considered an attempt by Nixon to undermine U.S. foreign policy. On October 31, with no agreement, Johnson announced <b>a</b> <b>unilateral</b> halt to the bombing, and that peace negotiations would start in Paris on November 6, the day after Election Day. On November 2, after speaking with Chennault again, Thieu stated he would not go to Paris. Johnson telephoned Nixon, who denied any involvement; the President did not believe him. Johnson felt he could not publicly mention Chennault's involvement, which had been obtained by wiretapping, but told Humphrey, who chose not to use the information.|$|E
5|$|Men have <b>a</b> <b>unilateral</b> {{right to}} divorce their wives (talaq) without needing any legal justification. The divorce is {{effective}} immediately. The husband's obligation is then to provide {{financial support for}} the divorced wife {{for a period of}} four months and ten days. A woman can only obtain a divorce with the consent of her husband or judicially if her husband has harmed her. In practice, it is very difficult for a Saudi woman to obtain a judicial divorce. The divorce rate is high, with 50% of marriages being dissolved. In the event of divorce, fathers have automatic custody of sons from the age of 7 and daughters from the age of 9. The right for men to marry up to four wives, combined with their ability to divorce a wife at any time without cause, can translate to unlimited polygamy. King Abdul Aziz, the founder of the country, reportedly admitted to marrying over two hundred women. However, his polygamy was considered extraordinary even by Saudi Arabian standards.|$|E
5|$|On 7 July 1999, the Lomé Peace Accord was signed. Among other provisions, the {{agreement}} mandated an immediate ceasefire between the main {{parties to the}} civil war and the disarmament of the Sierra Leone Army (SLA) and the RUF. It also gave the RUF status as a legitimate political party, a role in the Sierra Leone Government, and four of the twenty-two seats in the cabinet. Foday Sankoh, leader of the RUF, was given responsibility for the diamond mines—an appointment much criticised by observers and the international media given the RUF's history of diamond smuggling. However, Peter Hain, Minister of State for Africa, suggested that the British government {{had no choice but to}} endorse the Lomé agreement given the RUF's dominance, and that the only alternative was continued civil war. A military intervention by the United Kingdom in 1999 was ruled out as the British government had received no request for military assistance and felt it lacked the backing of the international community for <b>a</b> <b>unilateral</b> intervention. An intervention was also deemed to be politically and militarily impractical given the British military's involvement with NATO operations in Yugoslavia.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} recognises {{that there}} are no viable alternative aviation fuels, and whilst it accepts that the exemption of aviation fuel from fuel tax is anomalous, it sees no scope for <b>a</b> <b>unilateral</b> approach in addressing this. The strategy adopted in the White Paper seeks to mitigate the global impact of air transport primarily through emissions trading schemes. Although the Kyoto Protocol implemented emissions trading as a means to reduce emissions at national levels, the global nature of air transport means that all air travel is excluded from this mechanism. The government is seeking to redress this through the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), which has been working on the environmental issue since 1998, but progress is slow. In the meantime efforts are being made to include aviation in the EU Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) with an original target to implement this by 2008. In 2006 the government re-affirmed this policy as the best approach for addressing the climate change impacts of aviation, and current proposals aim at accomplishing this for all flights within the EU by 2011, with the scheme being extended to include all flights to and from the EU the following year.|$|E
5|$|Within the government, Van der Byl {{was one of}} {{the loudest}} voices urging Ian Smith to proceed to <b>a</b> <b>Unilateral</b> Declaration of Independence. He angrily denounced the threat of {{sanctions}} from Britain, saying on 4 May 1965 that economic destruction of Rhodesia would mean total economic destruction of Zambia, formerly Northern Rhodesia. This statement was interpreted as a military threat by David Butler, the Leader of the Opposition. Van der Byl was given the task of selling the UDI to Rhodesian whites and to world opinion. In September 1965, it was announced that he would tour the United Kingdom to promote Rhodesian independence. According to David Steel, he claimed then that France and the United States would lead the international recognition of the UDI government. He was appointed Deputy Minister of Information on 22 October and so was present at, but did not sign, the Unilateral Declaration of Independence on 11 November 1965.|$|E
