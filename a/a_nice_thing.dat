5|$|I {{started doing}} {{different}} charity events where I did {{a combination of}} 'Never Too Far' and 'Hero'. We made it into a medley {{and put them in}} the same key and made it work. People responded really well to it. It's been interesting for me, since the events of September11, the way people have been playing 'Hero' and really even talking to me about 'Never Too Far', 'cause that song is also about loss. I figured that it would be <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> to do, to put them both out for Christmas. There's also an unreleased track on the B-side, which is called 'There for Me' which kind of has the same sentiment. The proceeds from 'Never Too Far' and 'Hero' and 'There for Me' are going to go to the Heroes Fund, and it's going to benefit police officers' families, relief workers' families.|$|E

500|$|Bushnell {{felt that}} Pong was {{especially}} significant in {{its role as}} a social lubricant, since it was multiplayer-only and did not require each player to use more than one hand: [...] "It was very common to have a girl with a quarter in hand pull a guy off a bar stool and say, 'I'd like to play Pong and there's nobody to play.' It was a way you could play games, you were sitting shoulder to shoulder, you could talk, you could laugh, you could challenge each other ... As you became better friends, you could put down your beer and hug. You could put your arm around the person. You could play left-handed if you so desired. In fact, {{there are a lot of}} people who have come up to me over the years and said, 'I met my wife playing Pong,' and that's kind of <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> to have achieved." ...|$|E
2500|$|Regarding Oliveri's backing vocal contributions, Homme noted: [...] "Nick and I {{have been}} friends since a couple weeks after {{everything}} went down in 2004. People don't know that, {{and it would be}} awkward for me to run around making sure everyone knew it. Nick recorded his new record at my studio, and then he was going to drop off some records and he said, 'Hey, need anyone to sing backup?' And I was like, 'Actually, yeah, come on in.' That's <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>thing.</b> It was easy. It's nice to know someone since you were a little kid, and still know them." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It isn't <b>a</b> very <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> to do--listening to {{a private}} conversation," [...] said the girl, [...] "but when I {{discovered}} {{they were going to}} play such a trick on Kenneth I couldn't help eavesdropping." ...|$|R

2500|$|The name of {{the album}} was chosen because the band could not agree upon any other names. Taylor {{described}} the album title as being [...] "a very dumb pun in a way" [...] and felt it was [...] "quite an ugly sounding phrase" [...] but despite this, he felt the sentiment behind made it [...] "quite <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> to say" [...] because, as in the title song, it refers to [...] "turning a one night stand into someone's whole life". Taylor stated that he liked [...] "that kind of way of expressing love towards someone" [...] {{and the idea of}} using a [...] "simple but quite clumsy turn on [...] cliché" [...] to do so.|$|E
2500|$|Craig Sheffer portrays Keith Scott, Dan's older, kinder, under-achieving brother. Sheffer {{said that}} {{characters}} like Keith {{are not the}} most enjoyable to play. [...] "Keith is a very simple character. I actually prefer more of a challenge. He wasn't a hugely interesting character. But {{he was a good}} guy and he was just a really genuine human being with good intentions", commented Sheffer. [...] "And that's <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> to play and come {{home at the end of}} the day. You don't bring too much with you. We had some good scenes within the framework of a simple character, so there was some of that stuff to play, but also a lot of cheesy stuff." [...] After Dan chose Deb rather than Karen, Keith helped Karen to raise Lucas and fell in love with her, but they only get together in season three. He had a recurring drinking problem and rivalry with his brother.|$|E
2500|$|The {{doctrine}} {{was stated}} again by Clinton in the culminating chapter of Hard Choices, her 2014 memoir {{of her time}} as secretary:... It was {{no coincidence that the}} places where women's lives were most undervalued largely lined up with the parts of the world most plagued by instability, conflict, extremism, and poverty. This was a point lost on many of the men working across Washington's foreign policy establishment, but over the years I came to view it {{as one of the most}} compelling arguments for why standing up for women and girls was not just the right thing to do but also smart and strategic ... the correlation was undeniable, and a growing body of research showed that improving conditions for women helped resolve conflicts and stabilize societies. [...] "Women's issues" [...] had long been relegated to the margins of U.S. foreign policy and international diplomacy, considered at best <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> to work on but hardly a necessity. I became convinced that, in fact, this was a cause that cut to the heart of our national security.|$|E
6000|$|... "All right, my lad of wax, all right. I {{dare say}} you won't be tried; {{but if you}} are, you'll find before six months are over, that it's <b>a</b> very <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> to master of Greshamsbury." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It wouldn't {{have been}} <b>a</b> very <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> {{for you if}} your brother had married Miss Kybird," [...] said the indignant Jem. [...] "And you said, if you remember, that you didn't mind what I did." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Peg, Andrews is <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> old <b>thing</b> if you {{approach}} him right," [...] replied Reddy, dryly. [...] "You wouldn't believe me, would you, if I said I had my heart {{in my throat}} when we went in?" ...|$|R
60|$|CHARTERIS (scandalized). That's <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> for {{a respectable}} woman to say! You {{ought to be}} ashamed of yourself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Instead {{of finding}} her dallying in the {{moonlight}} with my secretary," [...] he rallied back between good and ill humour. And he turned to Tremayne: [...] "Damned indiscreet of you, Ned," [...] he added more severely. [...] "Suppose you had been seen {{by any of the}} scandalmongering old wives of the garrison? <b>A</b> <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> for Una and <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> for me, begad, to be made the subject of fly-blown talk over the tea-cups." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> of yours," [...] I pursued, [...] "that panel. The {{foreground}} is {{a little}} clayey, perhaps, but the lagoon is excellent." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Upon my {{word you}} take it rather coolly,' said Undy; 'another man would thank a fellow for putting such <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> in his way.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She's called Lucille. <b>A</b> <b>nice</b> old <b>thing,</b> {{and seems}} to have looked after you well. When I came in she was singing you to sleep. Voice all gone, of course, but I'd like to write down the song. It sounded like the genuine article." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Any {{time when}} John is away {{and you get}} frightened, Mrs. Meg, just swing {{that out of the}} front window, and it will rouse the {{neighborhood}} in <b>a</b> jiffy. <b>Nice</b> <b>thing,</b> isn't it?" [...] and Laurie gave them a sample of its powers that made them cover up their ears.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, and so do, my dears; {{it will be}} <b>a</b> very <b>nice</b> <b>thing,</b> if you go {{this morning}} before the frost goes off. Your Aunt Roger will like to see you, and you may take the little pot of black currant jelly that I wanted to send over for poor Tom's sore mouth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Old {{enough to}} be your mother too," [...] said the skipper severely. [...] "Here’s <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> to happen aboard my ship, and afore the boy too!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Gluck aloud, {{after he}} had looked {{at it for a}} little while, [...] "if that river were really all gold, what <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> it would be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aunt Myra says I have no constitution, {{and never}} shall be strong," [...] {{observed}} Rose, in a pensive tone, {{as if it}} was rather <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> to be an invalid.|$|E
6000|$|... 'She is <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> little <b>thing,</b> and {{her father}} hardly lets her out of his sight. I have {{sometimes}} speculated whether he might not ask you to keep house for him, but last time I saw him, I fancied that he was inclined to hold aloof from you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well now, she's <b>a</b> real <b>nice</b> little <b>thing,</b> Marilla. It's {{kind of a}} pity to {{send her}} back when she's so set on staying here." ...|$|R
50|$|Thinking About Little Willie John and <b>a</b> Few <b>Nice</b> <b>Things</b> is the 25th studio album by American {{musician}} James Brown.
