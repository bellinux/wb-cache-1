Doing so, Tucker revives Sub-Commander T'Pol, and they {{try to find a}} way to stop the Ferengi. She assumes the gas-machine was intentionally placed on the surface as a 'Trojan Horse'.

500|$|Gunn had a [...] "fantastic {{rapport with}} the Norwich supporters". As a player, he liked [...] "to tease the crowd during the game". Before each half of a match, Gunn would run toward his goal and pretend to attempt to headbutt the crossbar. Gunn {{says this is a}} habit he began as a youngster, and cannot {{remember}} how or why he began to do it. Norwich fans noticed it soon after his arrival at the club and, in Gunn's words, [...] "would wait until I got to about the 18-yard line <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>start</b> a small [...] "Wooo..." [...] which would build into a full-blown [...] "WOOOO ... AH!" ... I loved it and came close to smacking my head against the woodwork a couple of times".

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Indie Journal, Joseph said that when writing music he prefers {{to concentrate on the}} melody first, stating, [...] "Basically, I write from a two-person standpoint. [...] First, I let the song take hold and I put down the idea as a raw emotional statement. Then I let it breathe and come back, approaching from more of an objective point of view. This allows me to rediscover the true meaning I intended in the beginning, shedding new light on how I can best represent that to the listener." [...] This same concept is explained again in a taped interview with the Government Television Network with Joseph explaining that a lot of times he may only come up with part of a melody. [...] Then he would let it rest and come back to it and see if it feels right. [...] Then he would start [...] "building around it", [...] like putting a car together - start with a frame <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>start</b> building things around it. Musically, he tries to connect a common bridge between such exhilarating feelings as performing at the Acropolis, to the emotions each and every one feels every day. [...] "In the end, a good melody will always stand the test of time", says Joseph.|$|E
500|$|Fruit bodies first {{appear as}} tiny white knobs {{less than a}} cubic {{millimeter}} in size. In {{a day or two}} the knobs grow into a horizontal pyramidal mass, increasing in height as the hyphae lengthen. This is soon followed by the formation of a minute cap, and lengthening of the stem. The stem is about 1mm long when the cap first begins to form. The hyphae that comprise the stem gradually cease to grow at their ends, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>start</b> to branch, with many of the branches growing in a horizontal direction. This growth, indicated by the flattening and broadening out of the top of the stem, gives rise to the cap. The horizontally aligned hyphae grow vertical branches which remain more or less parallel, ultimately forming the dorsal tissue of the cap. Other similar downward-growing branches form the fertile hymenium, which can be seen when the cap is about 2mm in diameter.The young cap is spherical and its growth is at first , its margin being curved inwards and pressed against the stem. In this way, the hymenium begins its development within a special enclosed chamber. As the hymenial surface increases and keeps pace with the growth of the dorsal tissue of the cap, the latter expands and exposes the gills. The gills are formed by the continual downward growth of some of the hyphae. The gills are exposed before the cap is completely developed, and before the spores are mature. Spores can be produced by fruit bodies as small as [...] broad, and liberation of the spores continues until the fruit body is fully grown—a period of one month to three months, depending on the conditions of temperature and moisture. The mature spores are disseminated by the wind. When the fruit body is nearing maturity, some of the terminal portions of the hyphae of the dorsal surface of the cap separate, and as a consequence, the upper surface of the fruit body becomes granular in appearance.|$|E

[...] We sort of let that settle in and then let the music go as it wishes". [...] Von Till explained that the lengthy songwriting process, which took over 5 years, was important to achieving the end result: [...] "For these songs, we had to kind of let them reconstitute themselves or transform into a new shape over time...It's basically finding the opportunities to surrender ourselves to that kind of tangible spirit that drives everything we do".|$|E
