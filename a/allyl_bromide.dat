Csp(2) -Csp(3) cross-coupling reactions have been developed, but enantioselective variations are rare and simply retaining the stereochemistry is a problem. Here we report a highly enantioselective Csp(2) -Csp(3) bond-forming method that couples arylboronic acids to racemic allyl chlorides. Both enantiomers of a cyclic chloride are converted into a single enantiomer of product via a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation.

For electron-deficient, electron-rich or ortho-substituted boronic acids better results are obtained with racemic <b>allyl</b> <b>bromides.</b> Oxygen substitution in the allyl halide is tolerated and the products can be functionalized to provide diverse building blocks.

Also R 3 SnSnR 3 compounds (R = Ph, p- and m-Tol) {{have been prepared}} via coupling of triaryltin chlorides. The stereochemical course of the reaction between R 3 SnCl and (C 4 H 7) Br (C 4 H 7 = alpha-methylallyl, trans- and cis-crotyl) has been extensively studied. Two distinct reactions {{are involved in the}} overall process: (i) the coupling reaction, which gives rise stereoselectively to the sole R 3 SnCH(CH 3) CH=CH 2 (alpha-isomer), and (ii) the subsequent isomerization of the alpha-isomer furnishing mixtures of (alpha, trans, cis) -isomers. The occurrence of reaction ii depends upon the nature either of the R group or the employed cosolvent. In cyclohexane, the alpha-isomer is exclusively obtained with R = Bu, while with R = Me, Et, and Pr it is found as a major component in the ternary isomeric mixture. In tetrahydrofuran, 2 -propanol, acetonitrile, and pyridine, the isomerization occurs to an extent which depends on the polarity and the coordinating ability of the cosolvent itself. The observed stereoselection has been hypothesized to occur through one-electron transfer from the zinc metal to the (C 4 H 7) Br to form stereoselectively an adsorbed CH 2 =CHCH(CH 3) Br. -Zn. + radical ion which is trapped by the R 3 SnCl reactant to form the alpha-isomer.

5000|$|Once Kharasch began {{determining}} the dibromopropane compositions {{of the products}} under various conditions, he made a startling discovery. When <b>allyl</b> <b>bromide</b> reacted with HBr in vacuo (in the absence of air or other oxygen source), the average reaction time took about 10 days with an approximate yield of 88%, the majority {{of which was the}} expected (according to Markovnikov's rule) 1,2-dibromopropane (65-85%). In contrast, when the reaction was run in the presence of air or oxygen, it lasted a markedly shorter time (with great variation), in one case only taking one hour to reach completion. More importantly, however, is that the major product of these additions was the 1,3-dibromopropane, constituting approximately 87% of the product. Since the only apparent variable that had changed was the presence of oxygen (other gases found in air were tested individually and did not show the same effect), Kharasch hypothesized that the rapid anti-Markovnikov addition of HBr to <b>allyl</b> <b>bromide</b> was the result of trace amounts of peroxide in the reaction mixture that could have resulted from the interaction of molecular oxygen in its diradical triplet state and <b>allyl</b> <b>bromide</b> to form <b>allyl</b> <b>bromide</b> peroxide [...] From there, the weak peroxide O-O bond (~51 kcal/mol)(3) could be cleaved by incident light, causing homolytic cleavage and creating the peroxide radical. Even trace amounts of this <b>allyl</b> <b>bromide</b> peroxide radical would then be sufficient to begin a chain reaction whereby a hydrogen atom would be abstracted from the HBr, leaving a Br radical. This Br radical would then combine with an electron from the double bond of <b>allyl</b> <b>bromide</b> at the less-highly substituted carbon, giving the more stable 2o radical. Reaction of this radical with another HBr molecule would cause the abstraction of another H molecule and would complete the anti-Markovnikov addition. Since the Br radical is regenerated, the reaction would continue to proceed at a fairly quick pace until the reactants were exhausted and/or the radical species were terminated.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this PhD thesis {{has been carried out}} mainly at the Department of Chemistry, University of Camerino, under the supervision of Prof. Marino Petrini and Prof. Alessandro Palmieri, following their ongoing research interest in the chemistry of sulfonyl azoles and Î±-amidosulfones for the synthesis and functionalization of nitrogen-heterocycles. A convenient and easy method for the synthesis of unsymmetrical 3, 3 '-bisindolyl and 3, 3 '-bisbenzazolyl structures was developed. The presence of the p-toluenesulfonyl moiety at the benzylic position enables further functionalization of these framework: elimination of the sulfonyl group, in fact, occurs under basic conditions affording a reactive indolenine intermediate that can undergo nucleophilic addition of a variety of nucleophiles. In particular, addition of hydride, Grignard and Reformatsky reagents affords the corresponding addition products. Functionalization at C- 3 of pyrrole was achieved by base-promoted addition of nitrocompounds to sulfonylalkylpyrroles; this procedure allows the synthesis of 3 -(2 -nitroalkyl) pyrroles, challenging targets by mean of a regioselective Friedel-Crafts alkylation. The obtained addition products can be easily converted into functionalized 6 -azaindoles through a three-step procedure involving reduction of the nitro group, Pictet-Spengler reaction and final oxidation on Pd/C. Reaction conditions for the synthesis of Î±-acryloylamidoalkysulfones were optimized in order to minimize the competitive conjugate addition to the acryloyl moiety. Various <b>allyl</b> <b>bromides</b> can be added under Barbier-like reaction conditions affording in good yields N-acryloyl homoallyl derivatives; the latter can undergo ring-closing metathesis to afford useful 6 -substituted tetrahydropyridinones in good yields.

The best method to fill the vesicles with magnetic materials such as magnetite or maghemite is peptisation.
