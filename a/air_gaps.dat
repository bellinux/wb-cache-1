Each scale contains cuticle layers with randomly located blocks of cuticle that {{hold them in}} place and maintain an air gap between them.

The control, navigation, and communication systems are networked with the passenger cabin's in-flight internet systems. In January 2008, FAA concerns were reported regarding possible passenger access to the 787's computer networks; Boeing has stated that various protective hardware and software solutions are employed, including <b>air</b> <b>gaps</b> to physically separate the networks, and firewalls for software separation. These measures prevent data transfer from the passenger internet system to the maintenance or navigation systems.|$|E
25|$|A {{heat sink}} is {{designed}} to maximize its surface area {{in contact with the}} cooling medium surrounding it, such as the air. Air velocity, choice of material, protrusion design and surface treatment are factors that affect the performance of a heat sink. Heat sink attachment methods and thermal interface materials also affect the die temperature of the integrated circuit. Thermal adhesive or thermal grease improve the heat sink's performance by filling <b>air</b> <b>gaps</b> between the heat sink and the heat spreader on the device. A heat sink is usually made out of copper and/or aluminium. Copper is used because it has many desirable properties for thermally efficient and durable heat exchangers. First and foremost, copper is an excellent conductor of heat. This means that copper's high thermal conductivity allows heat to pass through it quickly. Aluminium is used in applications where weight is a big concern.|$|E

As a result different <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> for designing Dual Rotor Hybrid Excitation Machine (DRHEFSM) are being investigated. 0. 4 mm <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> has been chosen because of the influence of the existing Hybrid Excitation Flux Switching Machine (HEFSM) that used total 0. 8 mm <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> and successful in performing the machine operating principle. Furthermore, the machine also successfully obtaining good result in motor torque and speed. Total 0. 8 mm <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> are being used for the new design, 0. 4 mm for the outer rotor <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> and 0. 4 mm for the inner rotor <b>air</b> <b>gap.</b> Besides that, 0. 3 mm and 0. 5 mm <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> are being investigated in order to analyse the optimum <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> for the design machine.

2500|$|The primary {{criteria}} for making sonomicrometer measurements {{is that the}} intervening space or material between the crystals must be capable of ultrasonic sound conduction in the frequency range of 100kHz to at least several MHz. [...] This typically means that the crystals must operate in or on a medium composed of fluids, gels, soft solids and some hard solids, and this includes biological tissues (blood, muscle, fat, etc.).

2500|$|Molecular effect: Though fog is {{essentially}} liquid water, the many droplets {{are separated by}} small <b>air</b> <b>gaps.</b> High-pitched sounds have a high frequency, which in turn means they have a short wavelength. To transmit a high frequency wave, air must {{move back and forth}} very quickly. Short-wavelength high-pitched sound waves are reflected and refracted by many separated water droplets, partially cancelling and dissipating their energy (a process called [...] "damping"). In contrast, low pitched notes, with a low frequency and a long wavelength, move the air less rapidly and less often, and lose less energy to interactions with small water droplets. Low-pitched notes are less affected by fog and travel further, which is why foghorns use a low-pitched tone.|$|E

The results obtained showed that the average <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> change in different modes could reach up to 2. 1 mm. Around 90 % of <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> change results from thermal expansion and 10 % were determined by centrifugal and magnetic forces. In coasting mode when the power was switched off and the speed of the generator decreased, the <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> increased up to 0. 7 mm.

50|$|An <b>air</b> <b>gap,</b> <b>air</b> wall or <b>air</b> <b>gapping</b> is {{a network}} {{security}} measure employed {{on one or}} more computers {{to ensure that a}} secure computer network is physically isolated from unsecured networks, such as the public Internet or an unsecured local area network. The name arises from the technique of creating a network that is physically separated (with a conceptual <b>air</b> <b>gap)</b> from all other networks. The <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> may not be completely literal, as networks employing the use of dedicated cryptographic devices that can tunnel packets over untrusted networks while avoiding packet rate or size variation can be considered <b>air</b> <b>gapped,</b> as there is no ability for computers {{on opposite sides of the}} gap to communicate.|$|R
25|$|The {{distance}} between the rotor and stator is called the <b>air</b> <b>gap.</b> The <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> has important effects, and is generally as small as possible, as a large gap has a strong {{negative effect on the}} performance of an electric motor. It is the main source of the low power factor at which motors operate. The <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> increases the magnetizing current needed. For this reason, the <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> should be minimal. Very small gaps may pose mechanical problems in addition to noise and losses.|$|R
2500|$|Control of Greenside Mine for {{the tests}} {{was taken over}} by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority at the end of November 1959. The tests were {{conducted}} by the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment (AWRE), but the Greenside company was contracted to carry out mining operations. Access to the mine was controlled by the police. The two explosion chambers were excavated in the 175Fathom Level, where it had been extended south of the Clay Vein and a long crosscut had been driven in an attempt to find an extension of the Greenside Vein. This site was in solid rock, well away from the fractured and mineralised vein, and [...] below ground level. Two drives at right angles to the crosscut were planned to lead to the chambers. The first of these was abandoned under political pressure for a quick result, and the large chamber was excavated directly {{at the end of the}} existing crosscut. Once the TNT had been placed in the two chambers they had to be sealed off with heavy stemming. Sealing the large crosscut was difficult, and there was no time to construct a large concrete plug. Sandbags filled with tailings from the mine dam were used, interspersed with <b>air</b> <b>gaps</b> and timber walls. The area was also sealed off by two brick walls so that the poisonous gases produced by the explosions could be contained and pumped out. All personnel were cleared from the mine and the explosions were detonated from the surface.|$|E
