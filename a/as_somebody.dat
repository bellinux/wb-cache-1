Indeed, it was hard to blame the prison officer who observed that he thought it was the Minister for Defence paying an informal visit to Mountjoy Prison yesterday because, of course, we all know the Minister for Defence is wont to use helicopters, <b>as</b> <b>somebody</b> observed already, as other Ministers are wont to use State cars.|$|E
5|$|Leader of the Opposition and Labour leader Ed Miliband, {{who knew}} Benn {{personally}} {{as a family}} friend, said:I think Tony Benn {{will be remembered as}} a champion of the powerless, as a conviction politician, <b>as</b> <b>somebody</b> of deep principle and integrity. The thing about Tony Benn is that you always knew what he stood for, and who he stood up for. And I think that's why he was admired right across the political spectrum. There are people who agreed with him and disagreed with him, including in my own party, but I think people admired that sense of conviction and integrity that shone through from Tony Benn.|$|E
5|$|Kikai {{had started}} his Asakusa series of square, {{monochrome}} portraits {{as early as}} 1973, but after this there was a hiatus until 1985, {{when he realized that}} an ideal backdrop would be the plain red walls of Sensō-ji. At that time, the great majority of his Asakusa portraits adopted further constraints: the single subject stands {{directly in front of the}} camera (originally a Minolta Autocord TLR, later the Hasselblad), looking directly at it, and is shown from around the knees upwards. Kikai may wait at the temple for four or five hours, hoping to see somebody he wants to photograph, and three or four days may pass without a single photograph; but he may photograph three people in a single day, and he has photographed over six hundred people in this way. He believes that to have a plain backdrop and a direct confrontation with the subject allows the viewer to see the subject as a whole, and <b>as</b> <b>somebody</b> on whom time is marked, without any distracting or limiting specificity.|$|E

25|$|Cork {{qualified}} {{for a third}} All-Ireland final in three seasons in 1893 and, they proved again {{that they were the}} hurling masters. The championship decider pitted Cork against Kilkenny. It was the very first meeting of these two great rivals {{in the history of the}} championship. The game was fixed for Ashtown; however, upon arrival both teams refused to play there <b>as</b> <b>somebody</b> had neglected to have the grass cut. After a long delay the goalposts were uprooted and both teams and their supporters headed to the Phoenix Park where the game took place after some delay. The game itself turned into a rout as Cork scored a huge tally of 6-8 to Kilkenny’s 0-2. It was Cork’s second All-Ireland title in-a-row.|$|E
25|$|On September 24, 2008, {{after the}} onset of the 2008 global {{financial}} crisis, McCain announced that he was suspending his campaign to return to Washington so he could help craft a $700 billion bailout package for the troubled financial industry, and he stated that he would not debate Obama until Congress passed the bailout bill. Despite this decision, McCain was portrayed <b>as</b> <b>somebody</b> not playing {{a significant role in the}} negotiations for the first version of the bill, which fell short of passage in the House. He eventually decided to attend the first presidential debate on September 26, despite Congress' lack of immediate action on the bill. His ineffectiveness in the negotiations and his reversal in decision to attend the debates were seized upon to portray McCain as erratic in his response to the economy. Days later, a second version of the original bailout bill was passed by both the House and Senate, with Obama, his vice presidential running mate Joe Biden, and McCain all voting for the measure (Hillary Clinton would as well).|$|E

500|$|The vice {{president}} had in recent administrations {{been considered a}} relatively low-level political functionary, whose activities were generally limited to the constitutional function of presiding over the Senate. Hobart, however, became a close adviser to McKinley and his Cabinet members, although he was not called upon to attend Cabinet meetings. Reporter Arthur Wallace Dunn wrote of Hobart in 1922, [...] "for {{the first time in}} my recollection, and the last for that matter, the Vice President was recognized <b>as</b> <b>somebody,</b> as a part of the Administration, and as a part of the body over which he presided".|$|E

To the author, what made Flagg interesting was [...] "the idea of the villain <b>as</b> <b>somebody</b> who was always on the outside looking in, and hated people who had good fellowship and good conversation and friends".|$|E

500|$|In February 2010 when {{accompanying}} the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on a three-day visit to Saudi Arabia, he said [...] "We feel that Saudi Arabia {{has a long}} and close relationship with Pakistan, that makes Saudi Arabia even more a valuable interlocutor for us. When we tell them about our experience, Saudi Arabia listens <b>as</b> <b>somebody</b> who is {{not in any way}} an enemy of Pakistan, but a friend of Pakistan and, therefore, will listen with sympathy and concern to a matter of this nature". He was asked whether India expected Saudi Arabia, given its close ties with Islamabad, to help address the terror threat from Pakistan. The remark about Saudi Arabia being a [...] "valuable interlocutor" [...] raised a strong reaction within the Indian political circle. The Pakistani press even went on to report that he had proposed that Saudi Arabia play a mediator's role in improving India's relationship with Pakistan. In response, Tharoor denied that 'interlocutor' meant 'mediator', and tweeted an explanation, saying, [...] "An [...] is someone you speak to. If I speak to you, you are my interlocutor. I mentioned the Saudis as our interlocutors, i.e. the people we are here to speak to".|$|E

500|$|The stage play Being Sellers premiered in Australia in 1998, {{three years}} after the release of the {{biography}} by Roger Lewis, The Life and Death of Peter Sellers. [...] In 2004, the book was turned into an HBO film with the same title, starring Geoffrey Rush. The play later transferred to New York in December 2010. The Belfast Telegraph notes how the film captured Sellers's [...] "life of drugs, drink, fast cars and lots and lots of beautiful women". Although the film was widely praised by critics, both Lord Snowdon and Britt Ekland were highly critical of the film and the enactment of Sellers; Ekland believed that the film left the audiences with the wrong idea of her former husband, saying [...] "the film leaves you with the impression that Peter Sellers was essentially a likeable man when in reality he was a monster. He may have been a brilliant actor, but as a human being he had no saving graces at all". Snowdon disagreed with Ekland's verdict, and with the film, and stated that Sellers [...] "had a light touch, a sense of humour, I can't bear to see him portrayed <b>as</b> <b>somebody</b> who was apparently without either... The man on the screen is charmless, humourless and boring—the one thing you could never say about Peter." ...|$|E
500|$|At a July 2009 Hollyoaks press day, series {{producer}} Lucy Allan {{announced that}} there would be a [...] "big stunt" [...] involving schizophrenic character Barry [...] "Newt" [...] Newton (Nico Mirallegro) in October of that year. It was later revealed that a new character, Rae, would join the serial as part of a [...] "shock suicide plot" [...] involving Newt, in which the two characters would jump off a bridge. Alice Barlow's casting as Rae was announced in October 2009. Barlow stated that she was [...] "absolutely on top of the world" [...] to receive the part, particularly as one of her childhood dreams was to appear in a soap opera. Helen Russell-Clark– who went on to play Jem Costello in the serial– also auditioned for Rae, and reached the final stages of casting. Allan said Rae was one of her favourite additions to the cast in 2009 and expressed her pride in Barlow's performance, saying, [...] "to introduce a character <b>as</b> <b>somebody</b> and then to completely change the character six weeks later, while still delivering the performances that Alice does, is a testament to a young actress." [...] In early 2011, Barlow decided to leave Hollyoaks to pursue other projects. Her departure was kept secret until her exit scenes were aired. Barlow described her time with the programme as [...] "the perfect end" [...] to her teenage years and said she could not [...] "have asked for anything better." ...|$|E
500|$|Wilson {{increasingly}} {{expanded his}} social circle {{to include a}} mix of worldly-minded friends, musicians, mystics, and business advisers. Smile was the album projected to follow Pet Sounds. This time, Wilson worked with Van Dyke Parks, whose surreal and oblique lyrics led Love to adopt the term [...] "acid alliteration" [...] when describing them. Love says that he [...] "wasn't resistant to ... I mean, crazy stupid sounds, like animals, farmyard sounds, did all that shit, laying {{in the bottom of}} an empty pool, singing up at the mic. I did all that stuff. ... I admit to wanting to make a commercially successful pop record, so I might have complained about some of the lyrics on Smile." [...] Capitol was not interested in Wilson's newest ideas for forthcoming projects, such as an album of found sounds, which led to the Beach Boys' desire to form their own label, Brother Records. According to biographer Steven Gaines, Love was [...] "the most receptive" [...] to the idea, wanting the Beach Boys to have more creative control over their work, and supported Wilson's decision to employ his newfound [...] "best friend" [...] David Anderle {{as the head of the}} label—despite the wishes of band manager Nick Grillo. By December 1966, Wilson [...] completed much of the album's backing tracks. When the Beach Boys returned from a month-long tour of Europe, they were confused by the new coterie of interlopers that surrounded him. As Gaines writes, Anderle now appeared as the leader of [...] "a whole group of strangers [...] had infiltrated and taken over the Beach Boys." [...] Anderle had been encouraging Wilson to leave the group, and he was [...] "sure they saw me <b>as</b> <b>somebody</b> ... who was fueling Brian's weirdness. And I stand guilty on those counts." ...|$|E

500|$|AJ {{brings out}} a {{different}} side to Masood, which Ganatra said could [...] "upset the status quo". He said that AJ {{was brought in}} [...] "to stir up Masood's life, and that has exciting prospects", and they would [...] "get up {{to all sorts of}} shenanigans." [...] Presenter Kate Thornton, when interviewing Ganatra, said AJ was a [...] "playmate" [...] for Masood, while Wadia said that AJ brings the comedy back to Masood. Inside Soap Kate White called AJ [...] "a world away from family man Masood", while Soaplife said AJ is [...] "not a good influence but he sure puts a smile on [...] face and a new spring in his step." [...] Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy said that AJ's influence on Masood is [...] "infectious". AJ's arrival allows people to see what Masood was like before he married Zainab, as all that was known about him to that point was his life with her. Ganatra stated: [...] "So by opening this door, you get to see what Masood was like in his childhood and as a teenager. Masood did have a naughty streak—he was in a band with his brother, and they got up to mischief. Masood [...] has been put on the straight and narrow [...] But prior to that, he was a teenager like any other—getting into trouble, and that was in cahoots with his brother AJ!" [...] Ganatra said that, as British Asians, Masood and AJ grew up going to clubs and getting into trouble with girls. Now, Masood sees AJ <b>as</b> <b>somebody</b> with [...] "no responsibilities, no children and no stress of having to provide for a family" [...] and as AJ suffers marrital problems, is feeling lonely and has no children, Ganatra said [...] "they want each other's lives, which is quite a nice dynamic to play." [...] He added that [...] "AJ would love the stability of a family life like Masood's, while Masood would love to pack his bags, get drunk and perhaps end up in a stranger's bed. I'm interested to see him bring out Masood's naughty streak—and where that could take them..." [...] AJ is accepting of Syed's homosexuality and his relationship with Christian Clarke (John Partridge).|$|E
2500|$|The {{same day}} Russia demanded his release, {{claiming}} that he was captured in the Akhalgori district of South Ossetia and taken to Tbilisi and {{that he might be}} tortured: [...] "Aleksandr Glukhov was captured by the Georgian military in South Ossetia and taken to Tbilisi. It is another information provocation by the Georgian authorities. Under physical or psychological pressure or threats, he could have said anything," [...] said Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Aleksandr Drobyshevsky. The soldier's mother was quoted as saying: [...] "We periodically talk on the phone and I have an impression that he cannot speak freely <b>as</b> <b>somebody</b> is next to him". On 13 February 2009 members of the pro-Kremlin youth movement Nashi gathered near the Georgian embassy demanding the return of Glukhov.|$|E

Both on the stump and in Obama's political ad, [...] "Seven", the gaffe was used to portray McCain <b>as</b> <b>somebody</b> unable to relate to the concerns of ordinary Americans. This out-of-touch image was further cultivated when, on September 15, the day of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, at a morning rally in Jacksonville, Florida, McCain declared that [...] "the fundamentals of our economy are strong," [...] despite what he described as [...] "tremendous turmoil in our financial markets and Wall Street." [...] With the perception among voters to the contrary, the comment appeared to cost McCain politically.|$|E
