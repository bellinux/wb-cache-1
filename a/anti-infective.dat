25|$|Vaginal infections {{often have}} {{multiple}} causes (varies between countries between 20 and 40% of vaginal infections), which present challenging cases for treatment. Indeed, when only one cause is treated, the other pathogens can become resistant to treatment and induce relapses and recurrences. Therefore, {{the key factor}} {{is to get a}} precise diagnosis and treat with broad spectrum <b>anti-infective</b> agents (often also inducing adverse effects).|$|E
25|$|These {{peptides}} {{are excellent}} candidates for development as novel therapeutic agents and complements to conventional antibiotic therapy because they generally {{have a broad}} range of activity, are bactericidal as opposed to bacteriostatic and require a short contact time to induce killing. A number of naturally occurring peptides and their derivatives have been developed as novel <b>anti-infective</b> therapies for conditions as diverse as oral mucositis, lung infections associated with cystic fibrosis (CF), cancer, and skin and wound infections.

2500|$|The serendipitous {{discovery}} and subsequent clinical success of penicillin prompted a large-scale search for other environmental microorganisms that might produce <b>anti-infective</b> natural products. [...] Soil and water {{samples were collected}} {{from all over the}} world, leading to the discovery of streptomycin (derived from Streptomyces griseus), and the realization that bacteria, not just fungi, represent an important source of pharmacologically active natural products. [...] This, in turn, {{led to the development of}} an impressive arsenal of antibacterial and antifungal agents including amphotericin B, chloramphenicol, daptomycin and tetracycline (from Streptomyces spp.), the polymyxins (from Paenibacillus polymyxa), and the rifamycins (from Amycolatopsis rifamycinica).|$|E
2500|$|A {{rigorous}} double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized {{trial of}} AZT was subsequently conducted by Burroughs-Wellcome and proved that AZT safely prolongs {{the lives of}} people with HIV. Burroughs-Wellcome filed for a patent for AZT in 1985. The <b>Anti-Infective</b> Advisory Committee to United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) voted ten to one to recommend the approval of AZT. The FDA approved the drug (via the then-new FDA accelerated approval system) for use against HIV, AIDS, and AIDS Related Complex (ARC, a now-obsolete medical term for pre-AIDS illness) on March 20, 1987. [...] The time between the first demonstration that AZT was active against HIV in the laboratory and its approval was 25 months, the shortest period of drug development in recent history.|$|E
2500|$|In 1911 arsphenamine, {{the first}} {{synthetic}} <b>anti-infective</b> drug, {{was developed by}} Paul Ehrlich and chemist Alfred Bertheim of the Institute of Experimental Therapy in Berlin. The drug was given the commercial name Salvarsan. [...] Ehrlich, noting both the general toxicity of arsenic and the selective absorption of certain dyes by bacteria, hypothesized that an arsenic-containing dye with similar selective absorption properties {{could be used to}} treat bacterial infections. [...] Arsphenamine was prepared as part of a campaign to synthesize a series of such compounds, and found to exhibit partially selective toxicity. [...] Arsphenamine proved to be the first effective treatment for syphilis, a disease which prior to that time was incurable and led inexorably to severe skin ulceration, neurological damage, and death.|$|E

2500|$|Several <b>anti-infective</b> {{medications}} {{have been}} derived from fungi including penicillin and the cephalosporins (antibacterial drugs from Penicillium chrysogenum and Cephalosporium acremonium, respectively) and griseofulvin (an antifungal drug from Penicillium griseofulvum). [...] Other medicinally useful fungal metabolites include lovastatin (from Pleurotus ostreatus), {{which became a}} lead {{for a series of}} drugs that lower cholesterol levels, cyclosporin (from Tolypocladium inflatum), which is used to suppress the immune response after organ transplant operations, and ergometrine (from Claviceps spp.), which acts as a vasoconstrictor, and is used to prevent bleeding after childbirth. Asperlicin (from Aspergillus alliaceus) is another example. [...] Asperlicin is a novel antagonist of cholecystokinin, a neurotransmitter thought to be involved in panic attacks, and could potentially be used to treat anxiety.|$|E
2500|$|Ehrlich's {{approach}} of systematically varying the chemical structure of synthetic compounds and measuring {{the effects of}} these changes on biological activity was pursued broadly by industrial scientists, including Bayer scientists Josef Klarer, Fritz Mietzsch, and Gerhard Domagk. [...] This work, also based in the testing of compounds available from the German dye industry, {{led to the development of}} Prontosil, the first representative of the sulfonamide class of antibiotics. [...] Compared to arsphenamine, the sulfonamides had a broader spectrum of activity and were far less toxic, rendering them useful for infections caused by pathogens such as streptococci. In 1939, Domagk received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for this discovery. Nonetheless, the dramatic decrease in deaths from infectious diseases that occurred prior to World War II was primarily the result of improved public health measures such as clean water and less crowded housing, and the impact of <b>anti-infective</b> drugs and vaccines was significant mainly after World War II.|$|E
2500|$|Physicians have {{described}} the successful use {{of a variety of}} discontinued antiprotozoals in treatment of Blastocystis infection. [...] Emetine was reported as successful in cases in early 20th century with British soldiers who contracted Blastocystis infection while serving in Egypt. [...] In vitro testing showed emetine was more effective than metronidazole or furazolidone. Emetine is available in the United States through special arrangement with the Center for Disease Control. Clioquinol (Entero-vioform) was noted as successful in treatment of Blastocystis infection but removed from the market following an adverse event in Japan. Stovarsol and Narsenol, two arsenic-based antiprotozoals, were reported to be effective against the infection. Carbarsone was available as an <b>anti-infective</b> compound in the United States as late as 1991, and was suggested as a possible treatment. The reduction in the availability of antiprotozoal drugs has been noted as a complicating factor in treatment of other protozoal infections. [...] For example, in Australia, production of diloxanide furoate ended in 2003, paromomycin is available under special access provisions, and the availability of iodoquinol is limited.|$|E
40|$|Natural {{products}} (NPs) {{have been}} a rich source for pharmaceutically used <b>anti-infectives</b> and other drugs. However, the application of <b>anti-infectives</b> inevitably causes the development of resistant and multiresistant pathogens, which have {{to be treated with}} novel <b>anti-infectives.</b> The industrial research for novel <b>anti-infectives</b> has been concentrating on members of the bacterial Actinomycetales for a long time. Due to several reasons, e. g. the rediscovery of already known NPs, pharmaceutical companies abandoned their NP-research and focused on drug development based on combinatorial chemistry. However, the limited structural diversity of merely synthetic compound libraries has not been a fruitful source for bioactive compounds. Hence the discovery of novel bioactive NPs as a source for <b>anti-infectives</b> is still of economical and humanitarian interest and will remain to be an important branch of research in the future. One strategy to circumvent the rediscovery of bioactive NPs is the analysis of yet unexplored bacterial taxa. Based on this assumption, this work aimed at the discovery of novel NPs from the entomopathogenic bacterial genera Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus and other promising taxa, as well as the investigation of their biosynthesis.

40|$|THE {{public and}} the medical {{profession}} generally regard the "antibiotics", by which they mean the synthetic <b>anti-infectives</b> {{as well as those}} produced by microorganisms, as the most beneficial group of drugs introduced in the last 35 years. Some concern has been expressed from time to time about the ways they are used, especially in hospital and as an additive to animal feed stuffs. But on the whole the effects of their use are thought to be beneficial. The mortality rate from some infections has fallen dramatically and the pattern of infectious diseases in the community has changed. If this has been an improvement, then the need to prescribe <b>anti-infectives</b> should dwindle. The following study of prescribing was prompted by the knowledge that the prescribing has not dwindled. It was not expected that the study would explain why the prescribing of <b>anti-infectives</b> is still. rising, but it was hoped that the results would stimulate further research into the benefits and dangers.
