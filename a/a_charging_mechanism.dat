40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} novel {{scalable}} accounting infrastructure to support charging for network usage and Quality of Service (QoS) in an Internet context. Measurement and accounting are two core processes of <b>a</b> <b>charging</b> <b>mechanism</b> that make heavy demand on resources.

40|$|Replacement of {{conventional}} cars with battery electric vehicles (BEVs) offers {{an opportunity to}} significantly reduce future carbon dioxide emissions. One possible way to facilitate widespread acceptance of BEVs is to replace the lithium-ion batteries used in existing BEVs with a lithium-sulfur battery, which operates using a cheap and abundant raw material with a high specific energy density. These significant theoretical advantages of lithium-sulfur batteries over the lithium-ion technology have generated {{a lot of interest}} in the system, but the development of practical prototypes, which could be successfully incorporated into BEVs, remains slow. To accelerate the development of improved lithium-sulfur batteries, our work focuses on the mechanistic understanding of the processes occurring inside the battery.

40|$|AbstractMost adenoviruses use the coxsackie-adenovirus {{receptor}} (CAR) {{as a major}} cellular receptor. We {{have shown}} recently that adenovirus types 8, 19 a, and 37, which are the major causes of epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, use sialic acid rather than CAR as a major cellular receptor. The predicted isoelectric point of the receptor-interacting knob domain in the adenovirus fiber protein is unusually high (9. 0 – 9. 1) in type 8, 19 a, and 37. The pKa of sialic acid is low, 2. 6, implying a possible involvement of charge in fiber knob–sialic acid interactions. Here we show that (i) positively charged adenovirus knobs require sialic acid for efficient cell membrane interactions; (ii) viral and knob interactions with immobilized sialic acid or cell-surface sialic acid are sensitive to increased ionic strength; (iii) negatively charged molecules such as sulfated glycosaminoglycans inhibit the binding of virions to target cells in a nonspecific, charge-dependent manner; and that (iv) the ability of adenovirus knobs to interact with sialic acid correlates with the overall charge on the top surface of the respective knobs as predicted by homology modeling.

All the known algorithms for this problem which improve on trivial O(1. 62 n) -time enumeration are based on dynamic programming, and require exponential space. Motivated {{by the fact that}} exponential-space algorithms are typically impractical, in this paper we address the problem of designing faster polynomial-space algorithms. Our first contribution is a simple O((27 / 4) k n O(log k)) -time polynomial-space algorithm for the problem. This algorithm is based on a variant of the classical tree-separator theorem: every Steiner tree has a node whose removal partitions the tree in two forests, containing at most 2 k/ 3 terminals each. Exploiting separators of logarithmic size which evenly partition the terminals, we are able to reduce the running time to O(4 k n O(log 2 k)). This improves on trivial enumeration for roughly k < n/ 3, which covers most of the cases of practical interest. Combining the latter algorithm (for small k) with trivial enumeration (for large k) we obtain a O(1. 59 n) -time polynomial-space algorithm for the weighted Steiner tree problem. As a second contribution of this paper, we present a O(1. 55 n) -time polynomial-space algorithm for the cardinality version of the problem, where all edge weights are one. This result is based on a improved branching strategy. The refined branching is based on <b>a</b> <b>charging</b> <b>mechanism</b> which shows that, for large values of k, convenient local configurations of terminals and non-terminals exist. The analysis of the algorithm relies on the Measure & Conquer approach: the non-standard measure used here is a linear combination of the number of nodes and number of non-terminals.

40|$|Supercapacitors (or {{electric}} double-layer capacitors) are high-power {{energy storage}} devices that store charge at {{the interface between}} porous carbon electrodes and an electrolyte solution. These devices are already employed in heavy electric vehicles and electronic devices, and can complement batteries in a more sustainable future. Their widespread application could be facilitated {{by the development of}} devices that can store more energy, without compromising their fast charging and discharging times. In situ characterization methods and computational modeling techniques have recently been developed to study the molecular mechanisms of charge storage, with the hope that better devices can be rationally designed. In this Perspective, we bring together recent findings from a range of experimental and computational studies to give a detailed picture of the charging mechanisms of supercapacitors. Nuclear magnetic resonance experiments and molecular dynamics simulations have revealed that the electrode pores contain a considerable number of ions {{in the absence of an}} applied charging potential. Experiments and computer simulations have shown that different charging mechanisms can then operate when a potential is applied, going beyond the traditional view of charging by counter-ion adsorption. It is shown that charging almost always involves ion exchange (swapping of co-ions for counter-ions), and rarely occurs by counter-ion adsorption alone. We introduce <b>a</b> <b>charging</b> <b>mechanism</b> parameter that quantifies the mechanism and allows comparisons between different systems. The mechanism is found to depend strongly on the polarization of the electrode, and the choice of the electrolyte and electrode materials. In light of these advances we identify new directions for supercapacitor research. Further experimental and computational work is needed to explain the factors that control supercapacitor charging mechanisms, and to establish the links between mechanisms and performance. Increased understanding and control of charging mechanisms should lead to new strategies for developing next-generation supercapacitors with improved performances.

40|$|Field, {{experimental}} and theoretical investigations {{have been carried}} out into the electrification of volcanic plumes. At Sakurajima volcano, Japan, ground-level perturbations of the atmospheric electric potential gradient generated by particulate plumes were recorded. Simultaneous measurements, made at up to five sites around the volcano, are shown to be capable of detecting even very small quantities of volcanic particles, and tracking a continuously produced (over a period of several hours), dilute plume as it was dispersed by the wind. Data collected during one small Vulcanian eruption suggest that charges, about 1 C in magnitude, were generated and then separated, with the positive charge centre residing above the negative charge centre. Experiments {{have been carried out}} in order to assess fracto-emission (the release of ions, neutral atoms and various frequencies of electromagnetic radiation from fracture surfaces) as <b>a</b> <b>charging</b> <b>mechanism</b> for the electrification of silicate particles in plumes. Silicate particles, generally less than 100 µm in diameter, were produced by colliding pumice samples together and were shown to have net specific charges of approximately 10 - 5 to 10 - 6 C kg- 1 (similar to previous field measurements on ashfall). Most (but not all) of the experimental samples produced net negatively charged ash, and demonstrated a positive-above-negative charge separation. Additional charge thought to have been released in the form of ions was also detected, supporting fracto-emission as the charging mechanism for volcanic plumes. The magnitude of the net ash charge is shown to be a function of the particle size, with relative humidity having only a small effect. The polarity of the net charge appears to be a function of a property of individual pumice types, possibly their geochemistry. Experiments during which the particles were separated by their polarity indicate that the net charges reflect only a small imbalance in much larger, individual particle charges (10 - 3 C kg- 1) of both polarities. The particle charges are shown to vary with the sample impact velocity, the number of impacts carried out within an experiment and, to a lesser degree, relative humidity. Variation within the results appears to be partly an effect of particle aggregation within the experiment. Investigation of any effects that this particle charging may have on the plumes observed on Io (one of Jupiter’s moons) suggests that luminous discharges and particle aggregation are both probable in this environment. It is shown that the distinct asymmetries observed in plumes are unlikely to be a result of electromagnetic interactions, but probably represent decompression features and asymmetric vent or crater morphologies...|$|E
