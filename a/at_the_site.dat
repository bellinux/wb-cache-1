40|$|Using {{measurements}} from <b>the</b> Wind spacecraft <b>at</b> 1 [*]AU, <b>the</b> heating of protons in <b>the</b> {{solar wind}} <b>at</b> locations of intense velocity shear is examined. <b>The</b> 4321 <b>sites</b> of intense shear in fast coronal hole origin plasma are analyzed. The proton temperature, the proton specific entropy, and the proton number density <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{locations of the}} shears are {{compared with the same}} quantities in the plasmas adjacent to the shears. A very slight but statistically significant enhancement of the proton temperature is seen <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> of <b>the</b> shears, but it is accompanied by a larger enhancement of the proton number density <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> of <b>the</b> shears. Consequently, there is no enhancement of the proton specific entropy <b>at</b> <b>the</b> shear <b>sites,</b> indicating no production of entropy; hence, no evidence for plasma heating is found <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> of <b>the</b> velocity shears. Since the shearing velocities have appreciable Mach numbers, the authors suggest that there can be a slight adiabatic compression of <b>the</b> plasma <b>at</b> <b>the</b> shear zones.

40|$|Field {{experiments}} were conducted from 1992 to 1995 to estimate ground water recharge rates at two sites located within a 2. 7 -hectare agricultural field. The field {{lies in a}} sand plain setting in central Minnesota and is cropped continuously in field corn. <b>The</b> <b>sites</b> are located <b>at</b> a topographically high (upland) site and a topographically low (lowland) site {{in an effort to}} quantify the effects of depression focusing of recharge. Three site-specific methods were used to estimate recharge rates: well hydrograph analysis, chlorofluorocarbon age dating, and an unsaturated zone water balance. All three recharge methods indicated that recharge rates <b>at</b> <b>the</b> lowland <b>site</b> (annual average of all methods of 29 cm) exceeded those <b>at</b> <b>the</b> upland <b>site</b> (annual average of 18 cm). On an annual basis, estimates by the individual methods ranged from 12 to 44 percent of precipitation <b>at</b> <b>the</b> upland <b>site</b> and from 21 to 83 percent <b>at</b> <b>the</b> lowland <b>site.</b> <b>The</b> difference in recharge rates between <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> is primarily attributed to depression focusing of surface water run-on <b>at</b> <b>the</b> lowland <b>site.</b> However, two other factors were also important: the presence of thin lamellae <b>at</b> <b>the</b> upland <b>site,</b> and coarser textured soils below a depth of 1. 5 m <b>at</b> <b>the</b> lowland <b>site...</b>|$|R
