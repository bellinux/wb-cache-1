At the same time, to mark the band's ten-year recording anniversary, Iron Maiden released The First Ten Years, a series of ten CDs and double 12-inch singles. Between 24 February and 28 April 1990, the individual parts were released one-by-one, each containing two of Iron Maiden's singles, including the original B-sides.|$|E
5|$|Geen got {{his second}} try after <b>another</b> <b>break</b> from Poulton. Cambridge {{meanwhile}} scored two tries and at half-time were leading 15–13. Fifteen {{minutes into the}} second half, a second try for Cambridge put them five points ahead. An injury to one of Cambridge's scoring wings reduced the team to fourteen players; a forward moved to cover the wing, giving Oxford an advantage in the forwards. Poulton capitalised on it: he scored from a dummy pass to Geen; and ran in a solo try after receiving a pass from flyhalf Freddie Knott. The end score was 23–18 to Oxford.|$|E
5|$|During {{the spring}} of 1717, Stede Bonnet {{decided to become a}} pirate, despite having no {{knowledge}} of shipboard life. He contracted a local shipyard to build him a sixty-ton sloop, which he equipped with ten guns and named the Revenge. This was unusual, as most pirates seized their ships by mutiny or boarding, or else converted a privateer vessel to a pirate ship. Bonnet enlisted a crew of more than seventy men. He relied on his quartermaster and officer for their knowledge of sailing, and as a result, he was not highly respected by his crew. In <b>another</b> <b>break</b> from tradition, Bonnet paid his crew wages, not shares of plunder as most pirates did. Royal Navy intelligence reported that he departed Carlisle Bay, Barbados under cover of darkness.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{his return}} to Romania, Cocea was for a while {{employed}} as justice of the peace, but was later virtually inactive as a lawyer. Instead, he began frequenting the Romanian socialist milieu. He {{was at the time}} married to Florica Mille, daughter of Constantin Mille. Her father was founder of Adevărul daily and co-founder of the Social-Democratic Workers' Party (PSDMR). This was <b>another</b> <b>break</b> with the Cocea family tradition: allegedly, General Dumitru Cocea had once ordered his troops to devastate the Adevărul offices.|$|E

After production on Emma was completed, Director Clarence Brown tested Cromwell for the male lead in his next feature: The Son-Daughter, which was set to star Helen Hayes. However, the part of the oriental prince ultimately went to Ramón Novarro, and Cromwell never again worked at MGM.|$|E

25|$|The fifth set {{would turn}} out to be an {{historic}} battle. Both players were dominant on serve throughout the first sixteen games without a single break point opportunity to be had. A moment of crisis arrived for Federer with him serving at 8-8 down 15-40, but he rallied to deny Roddick the opportunity to serve for the match. There was not <b>another</b> <b>break</b> opportunity until Roddick served at 14-15 and Federer broke him, for the first time in the entire match, to win a record shattering fifteenth Grand Slam championship. This set remains the longest fifth set in a Grand Slam final. It is the only time in Grand Slam final history where a player has lost despite only having their serve broken once.|$|E

25|$|As {{important}} as the success on radio was the band's ability to tour nationally – the costs {{of which had been}} formidable in previous years. Unable to raise enough money for nationwide tours in support of its previous albums, Petra received <b>another</b> <b>break</b> when the band Servant invited it to open on its 1981–82 tour. Under Hollingsworth's tutelage, the band refined its live performances, its members dressing in camouflage to emphasize the spiritual warfare theme recalled by Never Say Dies artwork, which featured an ocean war setting with an electric guitar doubling as an aircraft carrier. The tour turned Never Say Die into a commercial hit. In December 1981, it became the first Petra album to crack the Billboard Top 40 Inspirational LPs chart, debuting at No.27, peaking at No.7 in April 1982, and lasting on the chart through February 1983, more than 60 weeks after its debut.|$|E
25|$|He took {{a career}} best seven one day wickets {{in his next}} season, however, at 29.00 each, and while he only scored nine runs at 4.50 {{he was able to}} score 24 runs at 12.00 in {{first-class}} matches and take 23 wickets at 19.30. Cushen did not play any matches over the winter of 1981, however he returned for the 1982-83 season with nine wickets at 30.11 in first-class cricket, and four at 9.50 in List-A. With the bat he enjoyed his most successful season, scoring 30 runs at 18.66 in first-class cricket. He scored a career best 19* in one day batting in the 1984-84 season, following <b>another</b> <b>break</b> from the game, along with a career high 44 runs at 11.80 in first-class matches.

25|$|After <b>another</b> <b>break,</b> Southampton {{travelled}} to face fellow strugglers Newcastle United on 24 February. The game started {{well for}} the Saints, as Morgan Schneiderlin opened the scoring within three minutes with a half volley into the bottom corner from a Rickie Lambert cross knockdown. The hosts quickly increased the pace of their play though, and after several chances they scored {{half an hour later}} when Moussa Sissoko converted a saved Yoan Gouffran chance to equalise. Just before half time they made it two, as Papiss Cissé scored a long range goal to put Newcastle 2–1 up going into the break. Southampton came out dominating in the second period, with Lambert picking up his 100th goal for the club when he turned in an Adam Lallana cross from the right wing. Danny Fox and Gastón Ramírez came on for Luke Shaw and Steven Davis later on, and it was the defender who gave away a penalty for handball which was converted by Yohan Cabaye in the 67th minute. The Saints attempted {{to get back into the}} match, but the result was confirmed when an attempted clearance by Fox went into his own net off Jos Hooiveld, meaning the team dropped from 15th to 16th in the table.|$|E

25|$|One {{of the big}} {{activities}} is trips to base camp (aka trekking), which can be higher {{than some of the}} highest mountains. The other big activity is serious attempts {{to make it to the}} top of Everest, and those in support of those attempts. The peak time for this is late May, because that is when the monsoons push the jet stream away, there is another time later in the year when the monsoon ends yielding <b>another</b> <b>break</b> in the weather, but there is more snow then. Some technology for climbing include crampons, fixed ropes, various cold-weather gear, bottled oxygen, and weather prediction. Predicting the weather is critical, one of the big disasters came in 1996 when a storm hit during a summit bid. In modern times, there is greater on-demand logistical support available such as internet access, but also some new challenges like not offending the locals and watching out for oxygen-bottle thefts. Helicopter support has grown and the availability of helicopter rescues increased, but there are limits on how high and in what weather they are able to fly. Modern dangers remain unexpected avalanches (this claimed many in 2014 and 2015), sudden onset of altitude sickness, and that classic climbing danger- falling. For a price, permits are available from China in the Tibet region and from Nepal and there is a multitude of mountaineering firms world over operating on the mountain.|$|E
25|$|A week later, Federer {{played in}} the 2010 Western & Southern Financial Group Masters in Cincinnati, Ohio, still seeded third behind Nadal and Djokovic, but {{competing}} as world no. 2 {{for the first time}} since Wimbledon. He received a bye in the first round, and then got <b>another</b> <b>break</b> when Uzbekistan second-round opponent Denis Istomin was forced to retire in the first set. He advanced to the quarterfinals in a walkover, when Philipp Kohlschreiber of Germany pulled out, citing a shoulder injury. He defeated frequent tour opponent and world no. 6 Nikolay Davydenko and advanced to the semifinals. He defeated Marcos Baghdatis and advanced to the finals. There he defeated Mardy Fish and successfully defended the title. Federer began his quest for a sixth U.S. Open title with an easy win over Brian Dabul. Federer next beat Andreas Beck. In the third round, Federer defeated Paul-Henri Mathieu. In the round of 16, Federer faced Roland Garros semifinalist Jürgen Melzer and won in straight sets. Then, in the quarterfinals, he faced Robin Söderling, who had recently beaten him in the quarterfinals of the 2010 French Open, and defeated him. He narrowly lost to Novak Djokovic in the semifinals after failing to convert two match points in the final set. As a result, Djokovic rose to no. 2 in the world and Federer fell to no. 3. By reaching the semifinals, Federer achieved his 20th match win in 2010 Grand Slams; this is the seventh consecutive year he has accomplished this feat, a record matched only by Ivan Lendl.|$|E
25|$|After a break, {{he joined}} Derbyshire in the 1902 season. He played {{modestly}} in 1902 and 1903, and played just one {{game in the}} 1904 season. There was <b>another</b> <b>break</b> in his first class cricket career, and he returned in the 1910 season a considerably developed player. He made 78 runs in a match against Hampshire although his bowling did not take off until the 1911 season. In that year he took 5 for 161 against Surrey, 5 for 36 against Lancashire, 6 for 39 against Northamptonshire and 6 for 30 against Hampshire. He also made 73 runs in a match against Essex. In the 1912 season he took 5 for 76 against an Australian touring side and his best performance of 7 for 18 against Northamptonshire. He also scored 84 not out against Essex. In the 1913 season he made his top score of 87 against Essex and took 5 for 76 against Sussex, 5 for 88 against Hampshire, 6 for 72 against Lancashire and 7 for 127 against Nottinghamshire. In the 1914 season he had two ten wicket matches with 5 for 47 and 5 for 83 in the same match against Lancashire, and 7 for 89 and 7 for 124 in the same match against Essex. First class cricket was interrupted by the First World War, and Forrester played just two games in the 1920 season. Against Yorkshire he maintained form, but in his last match against Lancashire, after faiing to take a wicket in 20 overs he was absent hurt {{for the remainder of}} the game and did not play again.|$|E

25|$|In the singles tournament, Federer first played Colombian Alejandro Falla, {{who took}} him to five sets at the 2010 Wimbledon Championships. Federer took the first set with ease, but lost a few match points and his serve late in the second set, {{allowing}} Falla to make a comeback and level the match at one set all. Federer regained control over the match, however, and closed out the third set {{to advance to the}} second round. Federer then played Frenchman Julien Benneteau, who had also taken him to five sets at the 2012 Wimbledon Championships just over a month ago. Contrary to their previous matchup, Federer faced no challenge from Benneteau, and flew past him to a straight-sets win in less than an hour. Federer next played Uzbek Denis Istomin in the third round, and clinched a tight first set after a short rain delay. He then took command in the second set and defeated Istomin. In the quarterfinals, Federer faced American John Isner, and secured the first set after a break of Isner's serve allowed him to serve for the set. Federer then battled with Isner to reach a tiebreak in the second-set, which ended when a return of Isner's serve clipped the top of the net and dribbled over to win the match. In the semifinals, Federer faced Juan Martín del Potro for the sixth time this season. He found himself in a one-set deficit after del Potro broke {{him in the middle of}} the first set and held to win the set. Federer, however, fought back in the second set, and after losing two opportunities to serve for the set, won the tiebreak with an ace on his second set point. Federer and del Potro then began a third set which saw del Potro creating a one-game lead and Federer matching it in his service games. Federer managed to break del Potro after twenty games, but was unable to convert the break, and del Potro broke back to continue the pattern. Eventually, Federer engineered <b>another</b> <b>break</b> at seventeen games all, and held serve to win the match on his second match point. The match, which stretched over four hours and twenty-six minutes, broke the record for the longest best-of-three-sets system match in the Open Era, surpassing the 4 hours and 3 minutes in Rafael Nadal’s victory over Novak Djokovic in the 2009 Madrid Masters. Federer, who secured his first Olympic medal and Switzerland's first medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics with his semifinal win, played Briton Andy Murray in the final. Federer was unable to find a way to control the match, and saw his serve broken five times en route to a loss in straight sets, which resulted in earning him a silver medal. Federer’s finals finish, along with World No. 2 Novak Djokovic's semifinals finish, guaranteed that he would retain his World No. 1 ranking.|$|E
