The {{aim of this}} project is the critical evaluation {{of the concept of}} Limits of Concern introduced by EFSA for the practical implementation in GMO risk assessment. The project is comprised of several work packages, amongst others the evaluation of environmental harm thresholds applied for regulated products other than GMOs, the realisation of stakeholder interviews and expert workshops for feedback and critical discussions on the concept. Within this project, selected GMO applications according to Regulation (EC) No. 1829 / 2003 were scrutinised with the focus on the consideration of the LoC concept. This could be expected because all applications were submitted in 2010 and later and therefore should follow EFSA’s revised ERA guidance.

In this study we analyze the cost efficiency of vertical integration, by estimating a translog multiproduct cost function for a sample of 14 local electric utilities operating in both generation and distribution during the period 1994 - 2000. The empirical evidence suggests the presence of widespread cost complementarities between the two stages and points to vertical integration as a crucial success factor for local public firms.

5|$|The Commercial Import Program {{was created}} in January 1955, {{immediately}} upon the transfer of France's remaining direct influence over the State of Vietnam to the chief of state, former Emperor Bảo Đại and his Prime Minister Ngo Dinh Diem. The Americans and Diem feared a communist electoral victory and national polls never took place. In October, Diem proclaimed himself {{the president of the}} newly formed Republic of Vietnam after he won a fraudulent referendum, and the aid continued as the US wanted to build a strong and stable anti-communist state in Southeast Asia. When the program was first introduced, it generated turbulence for merchant importers in Vietnam. As {{a large proportion of the}} imports up to that point had been from France, traders who were dependent on selling French products found themselves in difficulties as their wares would now be more expensive than those of import licenseholders who now had access to cheaper American alternatives. The suppliers of French goods threatened to organize a strike, but this never materialized. At the time, South Vietnam was also suffering from a lack of foreign currency reserves and the CIP was seen as an urgent mechanism of remedying this. The introduction of the CIP brought an unprecedented new level of economic liberalism and capitalism, and at first, the entrepreneurial class struggled to meet the challenges of a deregulated market, leading to a series of significant shortages and surpluses of various goods due to their inexperience in judging market forces and resultant imbalances in the economy. Initially 25,000 <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> <b>import</b> licenses were received, many from speculators. In the early years of the initiative, a proportion of the US funding for the CIP came through the proceeds of the sale of surplus American agricultural products to France.|$|R

FhG {{was founded}} in 1949 {{and is one of the}} "big four" German non-University {{research}} organizations, and is the largest society for applied research in Europe. Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft operates 66 institutes and independent research centres in Germany. It has more than 22, 000 employees and an annual budget above 1. 9 billion Euro. The Fraunhofer Institute for Cell Therapy and Immunology was founded in April 2005 and is located in Leipzig (headquarters), Halle and Rostock in the eastern part of Germany. Fraunhofer IZI's objective is to find solutions to specific problems at the interfaces between medicine, life sciences and engineering for partners active in medicine-related industries and businesses. Currently it has more than 230 highly qualified staff members and is divided in five independent scientific departments: a.) Cell Engineering; b.) Immunology; c.) Cell Therapy; d.) Diagnostics and e.) Drug Design and Target Validation. The Department of Cell Engineering consists of the Cell Engineering GLP Unit and the Cell Engineering GMP Unit. Preclinical Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) - studies for cell-based medicinal products in small and large animal models are the main focus of the Cell Engineering GLP Unit. The Cell Engineering GMP Unit operates with more than 60 employees two state of the art clean room facilities for aseptic manufacturing according to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). The facilities are designed for manufacturing and quality control of autologous or allogeneic cell-based therapeutics so-called Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products - ATMP's (e. g. tissue engineering products, somatic cell therapeutics, gene therapeutics) for clinical trials. A comprehensive quality assurance system covering the nine chapters of the EU Guidelines to Good Manufacturing Practice is the framework for all manufacturing and quality control activities. It consists of more than 750 documents and to date has been successfully inspected eight times by the Germany pharmaceutical authorities. The Cell Engineering GMP unit offers the following services to clients: a.) contract manufacturing and quality control; b.) support in set-up and validation of GMP-compliant manufacturing processes and quality control assays (process development); c.) <b>application</b> <b>for</b> product specific manufacturing authorizations according to section 13 German Drug Act; d.) <b>application</b> <b>for</b> tissue procurement permissions according to section 20 b German Drug Act; e.) <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>import</b> permissions from countries outside of the European Union (e. g. for human derived materials used for manufacturing); f.) support in regard to Investigational Medicinal Product Dossier (IMPD) writing and g.) regulatory consultancy. The clients that perform their clinical trials together with Fraunhofer IZI's Cell Engineering GMP Unit are mainly biotechnology companies from all over the world, e. g. from USA or Australia. Manufactured products range from Dendritic Cell based immunotherapies up to stem cell based products. A wide variety of clinical trials up to phase III pivotal studies are within the current project spectrum. The annual revenue of the Cell Engineering GMP Unit in 2013 was 2, 850, 000 Euro. This was sufficient to cover all running costs and to generate a slight positive cash flow that is used as a backup if required.

2500|$|When Caledonian's senior {{management}} began evaluating competing state-of-the-art jet aircraft types as potential replacements for the Britannia in its long-haul {{role in the}} mid-1960s, the Boeing 707 320C series was favoured because of its superior range and payload compared with its contemporary rivals. [...] Caledonian planned {{to place an order}} directly with Boeing for two convertible 707-320Cs that could either be operated in an all-passenger or all-cargo configuration and featured a large freight door on the left-hand side of the forward fuselage to enable carriage of main deck cargo when configured as a freighter. The initial order needed to be placed before the end of 1965 to secure the first aircraft's delivery in May 1967, just in time for that year's summer season. To avoid paying the 14% tax the UK Government had imposed on imported, new foreign aircraft to protect competing British models, Caledonian needed to persuade the BOT that there was no equivalent home-grown alternative. It also cited the BOT's earlier decision to approve BOAC's <b>application</b> <b>for</b> an <b>import</b> duty waiver on two new Boeing 707-336Cs as a precedent. However, the BOT was unwilling to grant Caledonian the requested tax exemption and was instead assisting Vickers in selling it the Super VC10, the stretched version of the original [...] "standard" [...] VC10 and Britain's answer to the all-American 707 and DC-8. Despite the BOT's and Vickers's best efforts, Caledonian's {{senior management}} remained unconvinced that the Super VC10 was a worthy competitor of the 707. The results of its evaluation had shown that the Super VC10 was not competitive with the 707, in terms of amortisation, resale value and availability of finance due to its small production run. Apart from its insufficient range to fly non-stop from the UK to the US West Coast with a viable payload, significantly smaller cargo capacity and lack of passenger/freighter convertibility, the Super VC10 was also heavier than the 707. This increased fuel consumption. In its ongoing negotiations with the BOT, Caledonian cited these findings as evidence that there was no suitable British alternative to the 707 for the envisaged role. The BOT however continued to insist that irrespective of Caledonian's specific requirements, the 707 and Super VC10 were equivalent and, based on this assessment, refused the airline's <b>application</b> <b>for</b> an <b>import</b> duty waiver. Meanwhile, the civil engine production hold-up caused by the Vietnam War resulted in the first aircraft arriving in July rather than May 1967. This did not allow its utilisation for that year's full summer charter season precluding a profitable operation. These circumstances compelled Caledonian to lease out its first 707 to the Flying Tiger Line until May 1968. To facilitate the 707's smooth introduction into service the following summer, Caledonian required access at its Gatwick base to its second aircraft (ordered in 1966) for as much as winter 1967-68 as possible to complete aircrew and ground support training in time for the following summer season. This was not possible as long as the standoff between the airline and the BOT continued. To avoid having an expensive, new jet aircraft sit idly {{on the ground in the}} absence of a timely resolution, the airline's senior management put in place a contingency plan to transfer the 707 training programme to Shannon Airport as the BOT had no jurisdiction over the Republic of Ireland. In the event, the contingency plan was not activated as a compromise was reached in early December 1967 that resulted in the BOT granting Caledonian's request <b>for</b> an <b>import</b> duty exemption. This permitted the airline to import the aircraft into the UK free of duty, as long as non-stop sectors outside the Super VC10's economically viable range accounted for a significant share of its operations. It enabled Caledonian to take delivery of its second 707, a 399C series aircraft bearing the registration G-AVTW ("Tango Whisky"), at Gatwick on 30 December 1967. The first aircraft — Boeing 707-399C G-AVKA ("Kilo Alpha") — joined the second at Gatwick on 1 June 1968, following the end of the Flying Tigers lease. Both began operating a series of charters, carrying 15,000 passengers from Los Angeles and Oakland to the UK.|$|R
