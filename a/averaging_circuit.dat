40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} on-sensor neuromorphic vision {{hardware}} implementation of denoising spatial filter. The mean or median spatial filters with fixed window shape {{are known for}} its denoising ability, however, have the drawback of blurring the object edges. The effect of blurring increases {{with an increase in}} window size. To preserve the edge information, we propose an adaptive spatial filter that uses neuron's ability to detect similar pixels and calculates the mean. The analog input differences of neighborhood pixels are converted to the chain of pulses with voltage controlled oscillator and applied as neuron input. When the input pulses charge the neuron to equal or greater level than its threshold, the neuron will fire, and pixels are identified as similar. The sequence of the neuron's responses for pixels is stored in the serial-in-parallel-out shift register. The outputs of shift registers are used as input to the selector switches of an <b>averaging</b> <b>circuit</b> making this an adaptive mean operation resulting in an edge preserving mean filter. System level simulation of the hardware is conducted using 150 images from Caltech database with added Gaussian noise to test the robustness of edge-preserving and denoising ability of the proposed filter.

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 For many {{applications}} {{it is desirable}} {{to be able to}} experimentally determine the impulse response of a linear system while it is in operation. Use of correlation techniques allows this to be done without noticeably disturbing the quiescent output value of the system. An impulse response measurement apparatus is designed and constructed using correlation techniques. This device is based on the Input-Output Crosscorrelation Theorem. A Poisson rectangular wave is used as the input. The Poisson rectangular wave is a waveform which alternates between +Em volts and -Em volts at random intervals of time. The zero crossings of the wave, where it shifts from one value to the other, follow a Poisson probability distribution. An analytical method is developed which indicates the deviation of the apparatus output from the ideal impulse response. This error is expressed {{as a function of the}} characteristics of the Poisson rectangular input and the system under investigation. Results are obtained for the generalized second-order system, although the approach will work for any linear system. These results indicate that the error can be made sufficiently small to allow the use of a Poisson rectangular input. The Poisson rectangular input greatly simplifies the crosscorrelation circuitry. The multiplier circuit in the crosscorrelator is required to multiply the system output by +Em or -Em only. This permits the use of a very simple multiplication and <b>averaging</b> <b>circuit.</b> A closed-loop tape transport was found to be very satisfactory in achieving the variable delay required in the crosscorrelator.

A duty ratio constraint that defines the diode conduction interval is identified to be the key to accurate prediction of high-frequency behavior.

Care {{was taken to}} analyze, reduce, and correct for capacitive artifact. One dimensional cable theory {{was used to determine}} the properties of the equivalent circuit of the membrane admittance, and the errors introduced by the neglect of the three dimensional spread of current are discussed. In seven fibers the equivalent circuit of an element of the membrane admittance must contain a DC path and two capacitances, each in series with a resistance. In two fibers, the element of membrane admittance could be described by one capacitance in parallel with a resistance. In several fibers there was evidence for a third very large capacitance. The values of the elements of the equivalent circuit depend on which of several equivalent circuits is chosen. The circuit (with a minimum number of elements) that was considered most reasonably consistent with the anatomy of the fiber has two branches in parallel: one branch having a resistance Re in series with a capacitance Ce; the other branch having a resistance Rb in series with a parallel combination of a resistance Rm and a capacitance Cm. The <b>average</b> <b>circuit</b> values (seven fibers) for this model, treating the fiber as a cylinder of sarcolemma without infoldings or tubular invaginations, are Re = 21 ohm cm 2; Ce = 47 µf/cm 2; Rb = 10. 2 ohm cm 2; Rm = 173 ohm cm 2; Cm = 9. 0 µf/cm 2.
