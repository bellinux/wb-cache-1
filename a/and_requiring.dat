5|$|A serious {{incident}} involving hooliganism before, {{during and after}} a match against Millwall in 1985 caused the club's then chairman, Conservative MP David Evans, to introduce a scheme effective {{from the start of}} 1986–87 banning all visiting supporters from the ground, <b>and</b> <b>requiring</b> home fans to carry identity cards when attending matches. Conversion to an all-seater ground also began in 1986. Away fans returned for 1990–91, and grass a year later. The David Preece Stand was erected in 1991, and the conversion of the Kenilworth Stand to an all-seater was completed in 2005.|$|E

Taking twelve months to create <b>and</b> <b>requiring</b> a budget of up to half million dollars, the work was completed in 2005. The sculpture was fabricated from 380 kilograms of aluminium, and assembled by a team of eight Croatian welders.|$|E
5|$|For {{infants and}} young children, orotracheal {{intubation}} {{is easier than}} the nasotracheal route. Nasotracheal intubation carries a risk of dislodgement of adenoids and nasal bleeding. Despite the greater difficulty, nasotracheal intubation route is preferable to orotracheal intubation in children undergoing intensive care <b>and</b> <b>requiring</b> prolonged intubation because this route allows a more secure fixation of the tube. As with adults, {{there are a number}} of devices specially designed for assistance with difficult tracheal intubation in children. Confirmation of proper position of the tracheal tube is accomplished as with adult patients.|$|E

This {{version was}} a more {{accurate}} conversion of the original arcade game and was a launch title for the console, along with eleven other games. The port was also followed by conversions of Pac-Mans arcade sequels, Ms. Pac-Man and Jr. Pac-Man, for the Atari 2600. Both were better received than Atari's first Pac-Man title and addressed many critics' complaints of Pac-Man, but {{at the cost of}} excluding a two-player mode <b>and</b> <b>requiring</b> larger ROM cartridges.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the reasons}} for the {{increase}} in the numbers of skyscrapers during the period was the growth in demand for office workers. In part this demand was fuelled by many U.S firms becoming larger and more complex, and white-collar sectors such as insurance and banking grew in scale. It was also driven by changing technology. The typewriter was joined in the office by the adding machine, the telephone and filing cabinets, all adding to the demand for office space <b>and</b> <b>requiring</b> increasingly specialised workers.|$|E
