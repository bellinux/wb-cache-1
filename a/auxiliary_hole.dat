40|$|In {{this paper}} the optimum {{position}} {{and size of}} an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>hole</b> are considered {{in order to minimize}} the stress concentration due to notches and holes in plates under tension. To solve these problems, the body force method is applied. Then, the problems are formulated as a system of singular integral equations with Cauchy-type singularities, where the densities of body forces distributed in the x- and y-directions are unknown functions. In order to satisfy the boundary conditions along the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>hole</b> and the notch, eight kinds of fundamental density functions proposed in our previous paper are used; then the body force densities are approximated by a linear combination of the fundamental density functions and polynomials. To obtain the optimum conditions, the direct search method proposed by Hooke-Jeeves is employed. The results show that the position and size of the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>hole</b> are determined efficiently with high accuracy...|$|E

The topology optimization mathematical model was built by taking the quality as the constraint, overall stiffness to the maximum (complicance to the minimum) as the design goals. It also took HTM 50200 Turning Milling Center as an example, put forward an asymmetric layout structure of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>hole</b> according to the optimization results by numerical simulation and calculation of ANSYS. By verified, {{the mass of the}} structure was 2. 76 % lower than traditional structure, and the maximum deformation decreased by 16. 07 %. By applying the topology optimization method to the design process of the HTM series machining center, the utilization of materials will be improved and the production costs will be reduced...|$|E

3000|$|LLT {{gasification}} method. This method utilizes mined tunnels or constructed roadways {{to connect}} the injection well to the production well [4]. Typical long and large tunnel (LLT) systems consist of a gasification channel, two <b>auxiliary</b> <b>holes,</b> and two <b>auxiliary</b> tunnels (Figure 2). The <b>auxiliary</b> <b>holes</b> are arranged between the injection and production wells and are used as malfunction holes for the injection of air and water vapor, or to discharge gas for added gasifier control. LLT also includes an auxiliary tunnel constructed of bricks, which is an auxiliary installation for air injection that prevents blockage in the gasification channel. The mined tunnels are isolated by sealing walls to prevent leakage of combustible gases from the gasifier [35]. The location and height of the oxidant injection points and gas outlet points can be adjusted, allowing for two-dimensional control of oxidant injection and gas production [28].|$|R

Also, refinement of the chanter construction {{has made it possible}} to play as high as the tonic in the third octave. Further, the ability to hit chromatic notes has increased, turning the chanter from a completely diatonic instrument to a nearly fully chromatic one. The addition of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>holes</b> has also increased. As a further sign of modernisation, keys have been added to some variants to extend range and chromatic ability.|$|R

40|$|Introduction An {{historical}} perspective Articulatory synthesis has a natural appeal to those considering machine synthesis of speech, {{and has been}} a goal for speech researchers from the earliest days. The earliest documented example of physical modelling was due to Kratzenstein in 1779. His entry for a prize offered to encourage {{understanding of the nature of}} the five basic vowels in English, used fixed resonators (Paget 1930). By 1791, Wolfgang von Kempelen had a more complete and elaborate model that used hand control of a leather "vocal tract" to vary the sounds produced, with a bellows for lungs, <b>auxiliary</b> <b>holes</b> for nostrils, and reeds and other mechanisms for the voiced and fricative (sibilant) energy required (Dudley & Tarnoczy 1950). Alexander Graham Bell produced his own physical articulatory model, based on skull castings and internal parts that was able to generate vowels, nasals and a few simple utterances (Flanagan 1972). Riesz produced a mechanical articu...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{article is}} focused on local stress {{simulation}} {{as well as local}} deformation analysis in a cylinder of piston combustion engine. Design of the exhaust pipe system has to fulfill special requirements with regard to the combined loading due to high pressures and temperatures. There is a special role of the exhaust pipe barrier, which is situated in the exhaust gas pipe. This barrier separates the main air hole from the secondary lateral <b>auxiliary</b> air <b>holes.</b> The exhaust pipe barrier seems to be a critical point of the cylinder. The finite-element analysis applied on the silumin-cast cylinder is presented in the paper in order to prove the critical places with high stress concentration. The local strength of the cylinder material was estimated using a material model based on relation between the strength and the mean distance between the secondary dendrite arms (SDAS) in the as-cast microstructure. Due to local heterogeneities there are differences in the local strength value at the various places of the microstructure. The simulation of stress distribution was performed by use of the finite-element method. Based on the relation „local stress/local strength “ the individual critical places in the cylinder were defined and located...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{details and}} reviews the {{development}} of a Pre-Chamber Stratified Charge Combustion System developed on a Ricardo E 6 /Mk 6 single cylinder, variable compression, spark ignition research engine in the Thermodynamics Laboratory of the Mechanical Engineering Department at the University of Canterbury. Operating a spark ignition engine on an overall lean charge has tile potential to simultaneously reduce exhaust emissions and maintain good thermal efficiency. However, problems associated with ignition of the lean mixture to increased exhaust emissions and reduced thermal efficiency. Stratified charge engines offer the potential to overcome these ignition problems, and restore thermal efficiency and reduce exhaust emissions. The stratified charge combustion process developed was centred around the separate injection of methane and air into a pre-chamber, located in an <b>auxiliary</b> spark plug <b>hole</b> in the cylinder head, to form an easily ignitable mixture which would establish a flame which would propagate through a lean mixture located in the main combustion chamber. Timing and duration of the injected methane was controlled electronically, whereas the air introduced into the pre-chamber was controlled by a metering valve and a check valve connected to the pre-chamber. The main charge to the engine was formed by using a gas carburettor...|$|R
