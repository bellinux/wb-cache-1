500|$|The {{work was}} written {{sometime}} in the early 13th century, and is explicitly dedicated to Frederick II. The scholar James Wood Brown argues that the book was likely written and then presented to soon-to-be Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II in AD 1209 {{on the occasion of}} his wedding to Constance of Aragon. Brown also adds, [...] "No date suits this publication so well as 1209, <b>and</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> <b>the</b> urgent desire of Court and people that the marriage should prove fruitful can explain, one might add excuse, some passages of almost fescennine license which it contains." [...] The philosophy and religion scholar Irven Resnick argues that the work was given to Frederick so that [...] "the emperor [...] to distinguish, from outward appearances, trustworthy and wise counselors from their opposite numbers." ...|$|E

500|$|Canning, held at Newgate, was {{reported}} to be in the presence of Methodists, an unfortunate accusation for her side. [...] On the same day this report appeared, handbills were circulated asserting that the Rector of St Mary Magdalen had visited her and was satisfied that she was still a member of the Church of England. Among her visitors was Mr Justice Ledinard, who had helped deliver Virtue Hall to Gascoyne. [...] Ledinard asked Canning to confess but was told by Canning that [...] "I have said the whole truth in court, <b>and</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> <b>the</b> truth; and I don't choose to answer any questions, unless it be in court again." [...] Despite calls for clemency, she was taken to the convict ship Tryal for her voyage to British America. [...] Several threats made by the ship's crew, however, meant she eventually sailed on board the Myrtilla in August 1754. [...] Canning arrived in Wethersfield, Connecticut, and by arrangement with her supporters went to live with the Methodist Reverend Elisha Williams. [...] She was not employed as a servant, but was taken in as a member of Williams' family. [...] Williams died in 1755, and Canning married John Treat (a distant relation of the former governor Robert Treat) on 24November 1756, had a son (Joseph Canning Treat) in June 1758, and a daughter (Elizabeth) in November 1761. [...] She had two more sons (John and Salmon), but died suddenly in June 1773.|$|E

Although he was initially well received by many, his subsequent claims of divine inspiration caused friction between him and others, and he was assassinated in 1990.

2500|$|The 19th century {{brought new}} {{standards}} of accuracy and style. In regard to accuracy, observes J.M. Cohen, the policy became [...] "the text, the whole text, <b>and</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> <b>the</b> text", except for any bawdy passages {{and the addition}} of copious explanatory footnotes. In regard to style, the Victorians' aim, achieved through far-reaching metaphrase (literality) or pseudo-metaphrase, was to constantly remind readers that they were reading a foreign classic. An exception was the outstanding translation in this period, Edward FitzGerald's Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam (1859), which achieved its Oriental flavor largely by using Persian names and discreet Biblical echoes and actually drew little of its material from the Persian original.|$|E
