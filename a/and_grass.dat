Potgieter envisioned a Boer {{republic}} with himself in a prominent role; he sufficiently impressed the Krugers that they joined his party of Voortrekkers. Kruger's father continued to give the children religious education in the Boer fashion during the trek, having them recite or write down biblical passages from memory each day after lunch and dinner. At stops along the journey classrooms were improvised from reeds <b>and</b> <b>grass</b> and the more educated emigrants took turns in teaching.|$|E

5|$|A serious {{incident}} involving hooliganism before, {{during and after}} a match against Millwall in 1985 caused the club's then chairman, Conservative MP David Evans, to introduce a scheme effective {{from the start of}} 1986–87 banning all visiting supporters from the ground, and requiring home fans to carry identity cards when attending matches. Conversion to an all-seater ground also began in 1986. Away fans returned for 1990–91, <b>and</b> <b>grass</b> a year later. The David Preece Stand was erected in 1991, and the conversion of the Kenilworth Stand to an all-seater was completed in 2005.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, {{plans to}} enhance the station's {{facilities}} were approved by the Department for Transport. The works, {{part of a large}} transport scheme called the Weston Package, included expanded the car park by 320 spaces, better facilities for cyclists and motorcyclists, and a bus interchange. A bus link to the nearby Queensway retail park was also included in the scheme. The expansion took over unused land to the east and south of the station, and required the removal of slowworms <b>and</b> <b>grass</b> snakes to a nature reserve in Cheddar. The work, which started in April 2013, was completed later the same year with the new car park opening on 3 September 2013.|$|E
5|$|Of {{most vital}} {{importance}} to marshes are invertebrate animals, {{the foundation of}} food webs. Amphibious invertebrates such as apple snails (Pomacea paludosa), crayfish, <b>and</b> <b>grass</b> shrimp consume plant material, hastening its decomposition and acting as a food source for fish and birds. Insect larvae use water for breeding, feeding upon smaller copepods and amphipods that live in microscopic algae and periphyton formations. Mosquitos, born in water, are in turn the favorite food of 112 species of dragonflies and 44 species of damselflies in Florida. These animals are water hardy and adaptable to dry conditions when water levels fluctuate from one season to the next or through drought and flood cycles.|$|E

40|$|A key {{question}} in savanna ecology is how trees <b>and</b> <b>grasses</b> coexist under N limitation. We used N stable isotopes and N content to study N source partitioning across seasons from trees <b>and</b> associated <b>grasses</b> in a semi-arid savanna. We also used 15 N tracer additions to investigate possible redistribution of N by trees to grasses. Foliar stable N isotope ratio (d 15 N) values {{were consistent with}} trees <b>and</b> <b>grasses</b> using mycorrhiza-supplied N in all seasons except in the wet season when they switched to microbially fixed N. The dependence of trees <b>and</b> <b>grasses</b> on mineralized soil N seemed highly unlikely based on seasonal variation in mineralization rates in the Kruger Park region. Remarkably, foliar d 15 N values were similar for all three tree species differing in the potential for N fixation through nodulation. The tracer experiment showed that N was redistributed by trees to understory grasses in all seasons. Our {{results suggest that the}} redistribution of N from trees to <b>grasses</b> <b>and</b> uptake of N was independent of water redistribution. Although there is overlap of N sources between trees <b>and</b> <b>grasses,</b> dependence on biological sources of N coupled with redistribution of subsoil N by trees may contribute to the coexistence of trees <b>and</b> <b>grasses</b> in semi-arid savannas...|$|R
5|$|Populations are dense in {{the higher}} {{mountain}} regions of Tasmania. Widespread throughout the state, their presence is known on King Island, located north-west from Tasmania. The ant prefers rural areas, found in warm, dry, open eucalypt woodlands; the climate provides the ant with isolation and warmth. This environment also produces the ant's food, which includes nectar and invertebrate prey. In suburban areas, this ant is found in native vegetation, and use rockeries, cracks in concrete walls, dry dirt <b>and</b> <b>grass</b> to build nests. One study found suburbs with voluminous vegetation cover such as Mount Nelson, Fern Tree and West Hobart host jack jumper populations, while the heavily urbanised suburbs of North Hobart and Battery Point, do not.|$|E

5|$|Airports {{generally}} have long, fully lit, hard-surfaced runways, full air traffic control, and navigation and landing aids. They are usually located on urban fringes, support commercial and business operations, and often exclude {{certain types of}} light aircraft. At the more rurally located airfields, the lighter end of aviation, such as microlight and gliding activities, becomes increasingly prevalent, and there are few or no commercial operations other than flying schools. At this level runways are generally shorter, <b>and</b> <b>grass</b> surfaces are increasingly common. Navigation aids are increasingly scarce, being more basic where they are available, and informal ground to air radio communication replaces air traffic control. The smallest airfields {{are too small to}} feature on general purpose Ordnance Survey (OS) maps, and lack basic facilities such as fuel and maintenance. The majority of airstrips are basically single short grass runways with no supporting facilities, although the presence of a hangar is not uncommon at the larger examples. They do not feature on OS maps, and are owned by private clubs or, more commonly, individuals.|$|E
5|$|As {{recreational}} facilities <b>and</b> <b>grass</b> ovals were sparse in densely populated Fitzroy, Merv {{and his younger}} brothers played cricket in a cobblestone laneway between their terraced house.

The group also played Australian rules football, kicking around rolled up cardboard and newspaper. Much of the batting skill displayed by the Harvey brothers {{has been attributed to}} these games played on the unpredictable bounce of the bumpy laneway. The surface also had a V-shaped slope inwards towards the centre of the lane, causing balls to deviate sideways after bouncing. As the laneway meant that the playing area was long and narrow, the young boys also had to learn to play the ball straight in accordance with orthodox cricket technique. The Harveys played another form of cricket in their concreted backyard using a marble instead of a ball, and a miniature bat. This sharpened their reflexes.|$|E

Archaeological investigations were then carried out, focusing on the keep in 1970, the church and the earthwork defences during 1971 and 1972, and the inner bailey from 1973 to 1976. This research centred on archaeological excavations and the recording of remains; as with similar castles investigated during this period, the site was then preserved as a monument, <b>and</b> <b>grass</b> lawns laid down around the remaining stonework and foundations.

Ham-Kam entered an alliance with Totalprosjekt—an real estate development company working on Lillestrøm's Åråsen Stadion—who presented a concept to finance a new venue: The municipality would transfer property to a limited company jointly owned by the municipality and the major sports clubs, the real estate would be re-regulated to increase their value, and the company would use this capital to build a new professional and a new recreational stadium. Parallel with this, a municipal commission made a report that recommended a consolidation in the number of venues in town and the conversion of gravel <b>and</b> <b>grass</b> fields to artificial turf. The commission recommended that a new professional football venue be built either at Briskeby or Hamar stadion.|$|E
