30|$|Sulfur is a {{chemical}} element essential to all organisms, {{as it is}} required for the biosynthesis of cysteine and methionine; it is also involved in many redox reactions that take place in biological systems (Kertesz 2000). Microorganisms are capable of acquiring sulfur for biosynthesis by assimilating inorganic sulfates or organosulfur compounds, such as sulfonates and sulfate esters (Kertesz 2000; Stipanuk 1986). Bacterial <b>arylsulfatases</b> catalyze the hydrolysis of aromatic sulfate esters and participate in the metabolic pathways through which sulfur is procured by organosulfur compounds. Considering the ability to hydrolyze organosulfur compounds, bacterial <b>arylsulfatases</b> would be useful for many areas such as industry and agriculture (Stressler et al. 2016). In practice, bacterial <b>arylsulfatases</b> are applied in the desulfation of agar (Kim et al. 2004; Lim et al. 2004; Wang et al. 2015). Their activities are strongly influenced by bacterial growth environmental conditions and thus their measurements can be used for soil quality assessment (Garcia-Sanchez et al. 2016; Klose et al. 1999). In addition, it was suggested that sulfatase activity is related with the degradation of endosulfan, an extensively used insecticide (Kalyani et al. 2009; Narkhede et al. 2015). Recently, it was reported that sulfatases are potentially implicated in bacterial pathogenesis (Hickey et al. 2015). Furthermore, bacterial sulfatases might be involved in decomposition of sulfated mucins (Murty et al. 1992) and reconstruction of extracellular structures by desulfation of glycosaminoglycans (Mougous et al. 2002) for bacterial infection. However, despite of the various usages and the importance of sulfatase activity, only a few bacterial sulfatases were characterized.|$|R

We found that only the microsomal fraction from liver and placenta hydrolyzed iodothyronine sulfates. Among the recombinant enzymes only the endoplasmic reticulum-associated ARSC showed activity toward iodothyronine sulfates; the soluble lysosomal ARSA and ARSB were inactive. Recombinant ARSC as well as human placenta microsomes hydrolyzed iodothyronine sulfates with a substrate preference for 3, 3 '-diiodothyronine sulfate (3, 3 '-T(2) S) approximately T(3) sulfate (T(3) S) >> rT(3) S approximately T(4) S, whereas human and rat liver microsomes showed a preference for 3, 3 '-T(2) S > T(3) S >> rT(3) S approximately T(4) S. ARSC and the tissue microsomal sulfatases were all characterized by high apparent K(m) values (> 50 microM) for 3, 3 '-T(2) S and T(3) S. Iodothyronine sulfatase activity determined using 3, 3 '-T(2) S as a substrate was much higher in human liver microsomes than in human placenta microsomes, although ARSC is expressed at higher levels in human placenta than in human liver. The ratio of estrone sulfate to T(2) S hydrolysis in human liver microsomes (0. 2) differed largely from that in ARSC homogenate (80) and human placenta microsomes (150). These results suggest that ARSC accounts for the relatively low iodothyronine sulfatase activity of human placenta, and that additional <b>arylsulfatase(s)</b> contributes to the high iodothyronine sulfatase activity in human liver.

5000|$|Heparan sulfate {{proteoglycans}} (HSPGs) {{are widely}} expressed throughout most tissues {{of nearly all}} multicellular species. [...] The function of HSPGs extends beyond providing an extracellular matrix (ECM) structure and scaffold for cells. They are integral regulators of essential cell signaling pathways affecting cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and migration.

HS chains are heterogeneous structures that differ in specific and conditional cell contexts. Of particular importance is the HS sulfation pattern, which was {{once thought to be}} static after HS biosynthesis in the Golgi. However, this paradigm changed after the discovery of two extracellular 6-O-S glucosamine <b>arylsulfatases,</b> Sulf1 and Sulf2. These two enzymes allow rapid extracellular modification of sulfate content in HSPGs, impacting signaling involving Shh, Wnt, BMP, FGF, VEGF, HB-EGF, GDNF, and HGF.

40|$|Sulfonates and sulfate esters are {{widespread}} in nature, {{and make up}} over 95 % of the sulfur content of most aerobic soils. Many microorganisms can use sulfonates and sulfate esters {{as a source of}} sulfur for growth, even when they are unable to metabolize the carbon skeleton of the compounds. In these organisms, expression of sulfatases and sulfonatases is repressed in the presence of sulfate, in a process mediated by the LysR-type regulator protein CysB, and the corresponding genes therefore constitute an extension of the cys regulon. Additional regulator proteins required for sulfonate desulfonation have been identified in Escherichia coli (the Cbl protein) and Pseudomonas putida (the AsfR protein). Desulfonation of aromatic and aliphatic sulfonates as sulfur sources by aerobic bacteria is oxygen-dependent, carried out by the K-ketoglutarate-dependent taurine dioxygenase, or by one of several FMNH 2 -dependent monooxygenases.

Decrease in enzymatic activity during the composting process is related to the decline in microbial activity due to reduction in the amount of available substrates (Garcia et al. 1993; Benitez et al. 1999) and indicates the maturity of the compost. Other physiochemical parameters like water-soluble carbon (WSC), organic carbon (%), E 4 /E 6 ratio, E 2 /E 3 ratio, C:N ratio, EC, pH, etc. reflect on the stability and maturity of the compost.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Sulfatases {{constitute}} {{a family of}} enzymes with a highly conserved active site region including a CÎ±âformylglycine that is posttranslationally generated by the oxidation of a conserved cysteine or serine residue. The crystal structures of two human <b>arylsulfatases,</b> ASA and ASB, along with ASA mutants and their complexes led to different proposals for the catalytic mechanism in the hydrolysis of sulfate esters. Results: The crystal structure of a bacterial sulfatase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAS) has been determined at 1. 3 Ã. Fold and active site region are strikingly {{similar to those of}} the known human sulfatases. The structure allows a precise determination of the active site region, unequivocally showing the presence of a CÎ±âformylglycine hydrate as the key catalytic residue. Furthermore, the cation located in the active site is unambiguously characterized as calcium by both its B value and the geometry of its coordination sphere. The active site contains a noncovalently bonded sulfate that occupies the same position as the one in para-nitrocatecholsulfate in previously studied ASA complexes. Conclusions: The structure of PAS shows that the resting state of the key catalytic residue in sulfatases is a formylglycine hydrate. These structural data establish a mechanism for sulfate ester cleavage involving an aldehyde hydrate as the functional group that initiates the reaction through a nucleophilic attack on the sulfur atom in the substrate. The alcohol is eliminated from a reaction intermediate containing pentacoordinated sulfur. Subsequent elimination of the sulfate regenerates the aldehyde, which is again hydrated. The metal cation involved in stabilizing the charge and anchoring the substrate during catalysis is established as calcium...|$|R

The causative pathogen was a new strain of Vibrio vulnificus, named biotype 3, which displayed a unique biochemical and genotypic profile. Initial observations suggested that the pathogen erupted {{as a result of}} genetic recombination between two distinct populations. We applied a whole genome shotgun sequencing approach using several V. vulnificus strains from Israel in order to study the pan genome of V. vulnificus and determine the phylogenetic relationship of biotype 3 with existing populations. The core genome of V. vulnificus based on 16 draft and complete genomes consisted of 3068 genes, representing between 59 % and 78 % of the whole genome of 16 strains. The accessory genome varied in size from 781 kbp to 2044 kbp. Phylogenetic analysis based on whole, core, and accessory genomes displayed similar clustering patterns with two main clusters, clinical (C) and environmental (E), all biotype 3 strains formed a distinct group within the E cluster.

In organisms that live aerobically, molecular oxygen is used enzymatically to oxidize cysteine to FGly. Under anaerobic conditions, S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) radical chemistry is used. Here we present the structures of an anaerobic sulfatase maturating enzyme (anSME), both with and without peptidyl-substrates, at 1. 6 â 1. 8 Ã resolution. We find that anSMEs differ from their aerobic counterparts in using backbone-based hydrogen-bonding patterns to interact with their peptidyl-substrates, leading to decreased sequence specificity. These anSME structures from Clostridium perfringens are also the first of an AdoMet radical enzyme that performs dehydrogenase chemistry. Together with accompanying mutagenesis data, a mechanistic proposal is put forth for how AdoMet radical chemistry is coopted to perform a dehydrogenation reaction. In the oxidation of cysteine or serine to FGly by anSME, we identify D 277 and an auxiliary [4 Fe- 4 S] cluster as the likely acceptor of the final proton and electron, respectively. D 277 and both auxiliary clusters are housed in a cysteine-rich C-terminal domain, termed SPASM domain, that contains homology to ~ 1, 400 other unique AdoMet radical enzymes proposed to use [4 Fe- 4 S] clusters to ligate peptidyl-substrates for subsequent modification. In contrast to this proposal, we find that neither auxiliary cluster in anSME bind substrate, and both are fully ligated by cysteine residues. Instead, our structural {{data suggest that the}} placement of these auxiliary clusters creates a conduit for electrons to travel from the buried substrate to the protein surface.

A portion of 10 to 20 % of this suspended particulate matter is diverted and follows a north-western path {{under the influence of}} Guiana Current that results in a spectacular migration of 1 600 km of subtidal mud belt along the coastline of Guianas to the Orinoco Delta. In the intertidal zone, mud banks form extensive mud flats whose periodic dewatering by tide cycles progressively generates the establishment and stabilization of the upper intertidal part. Its colonization by biofilms and then by propagules imported from fringing mature mangroves, promotes extending of mangrove ecosystem. In such environment, highly constrained by a rapid and intensive hydro-sedimentary dynamic, the evolution of mangrove ecosystem gradually leads to the development of series of stages, from pioneers to matures and finally to senescents. The interactions between aboveground-belowground vegetation, organic matter and sediment are responsible of changes in ground characteristics and pore-water composition. These are to be linked with microbial community functionning which are a central component of biogeochemical processes and nutrient dynamics that take place in mangrove ecosystem. The study site corresponds to a mangrove of Avicennia germinans and Laguncularia racemosa located at Montabo (Cayenne, French Guiana). This mangrove results from silt bed colonization which has began to deposit since 2003. Our objectives were to understand which environmental factors were the main drivers of the expression of microbial functions in this intertidal sediment. With this aim, we distinguished several classes of environmental factors potentially involved in microbial function regulation: 1) vegetation successional steps defined by 4 stages, i. e. bare mud (BM), seedling (S, < 1 y), pioneer (P, < 5 y) and young (Y, < 10 y); 2) hydro-climatic conditions, i. e. two contrasted seasons: rainy (R) and dry (D); 3) hydro- and physico-chemical properties of sediment, including OM quality characterization by SS 13 C CPMAS NMR spectroscopy; 4) rhizospheric effects.
