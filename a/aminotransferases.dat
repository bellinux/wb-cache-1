40|$|BACKGROUND: The (13) C-methacetin-breath {{test and}} also several noninvasive blood tests {{comprising}} routine laboratory parameters {{have been proposed}} to predict fibrosis and cirrhosis in chronic hepatitis C. The aim {{of the study was}} to compare the diagnostic accuracy between these tests referring to hepatic histology as gold standard. METHODS: 96 patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection underwent percutaneous liver biopsy and the (13) C-methacetin-breath test. The Fibroindex, the aspartate <b>aminotransferase</b> to platelet ratio index, and the aspartate <b>aminotransferase</b> to alanine <b>aminotransferase</b> ratio were used as parameters for the staging of fibrosis. The main endpoint was the area under the characteristic curves for the diagnosis of advanced fibrosis (F 3 -F 4) and cirrhosis (F 4) according to the Batts Ludwig criteria. RESULTS: ROC analysis revealed a cut-off 1. 82 70. 4 % sensitivity and 91. 3 % specificity, for the aspartate <b>aminotransferase</b> to platelet ratio > 1. 0 a 66. 7 % sensitivity and 75. 4 % specificity, and for the aspartate <b>aminotransferase</b> to alanine <b>aminotransferase</b> ratio > 1. 0 63. 0 % sensitivity and 59. 4 % specificity in predicting liver cirrhosis. The areas under the curve for the breath test, the Fibroindex, aspartate <b>aminotransferase</b> to platelet ratio and the aspartate <b>aminotransferase</b> to alanine <b>aminotransferase</b> ratio were 0. 958, 0. 845, 0. 799, and 0. 688, respectively, when predicting cirrhosis. For identifying patients with advanced fibrosis, the areas under the curve were 0. 827, 0. 804, 0. 779, and 0. 561, respectively. Discordances between Fibroindex (21 %), aspartate <b>aminotransferase</b> to platelet ratio (29 %) or aspartate <b>aminotransferase</b> to alanine <b>aminotransferase</b> ratio (37. 6 %) and liver biopsy were significantly more frequent than between (13) C-breath test (11. 6 %) and liver biopsy (P< 0. 05).
