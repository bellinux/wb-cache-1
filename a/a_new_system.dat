The Church {{implemented}} <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>system</b> of emigration, in which wagon trains travelled east from Salt Lake City {{in the spring and}} returned with emigrants in the summer.

5|$|Following the war, the 1950s and 1960s {{saw many}} large scale {{developments}} in the city. The Sheffield Tramway was closed, and <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>system</b> of roads, including the Inner Ring Road, were laid out. Also at this time {{many of the old}} slums were cleared and replaced with housing schemes such as the Park Hill flats, and the Gleadless Valley estate.|$|E

5|$|The {{issue of}} {{military}} reform, {{which had been}} extremely contentious {{right up to the}} end of Leopold II's reign, continued to be important up to the outbreak of the First World War. Under the influence of pro-militarist lobbying, expansion and further reform of the army was discussed in parliament, and <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>system</b> of universal military conscription was adopted in 1913.|$|E
5|$|The street's {{location}} {{in the city and}} its landmark attraction has made it lately a highly prestigious area, with several new luxurious restaurants. However, the descent's sewer and water systems have not been upgraded within the past 100 years, thereby underlining the need for <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>system</b> to be installed. Although, city authorities have not yet scheduled a new sewer project system to be installed.|$|E
5|$|A new {{electoral system}} of two-round voting had been {{introduced}} for the 2004 regional elections, in part {{in an attempt to}} reduce the FN's influence in regional councils. The FN won 15.1% of the vote in metropolitan France, almost the same as in 1998, but its number of councillors was almost halved due to the new electoral system. For the 2004 European elections too, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>system</b> less favourable to the FN {{had been introduced}}. The party regained some of its strength from 1999, earning 9.8% of the vote and seven seats.|$|E

5|$|According to {{management}} researcher John J. Clancey, scientific management can involve {{the use of}} throffers. While piecework had been utilised since the Middle Ages, Frederick Winslow Taylor blended rationalised management with piecework, to create <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>system.</b> Productivity processes were standardised, after which point managers were able to present a throffer to workers: higher pay was offered if {{they were able to}} exceed the standard, while lower pay was threatened for any who did not meet expectations.|$|E
5|$|After {{devolution}} {{began to}} take place {{in other parts of the}} United Kingdom it was planned that referendums for the regions of England would take place for their own elected regional assemblies as a counterweight. London accepted in 1998: the London Assembly was created two years later. However, when the proposal was rejected by the northern England devolution referendums, 2004 in the North East, further referendums were cancelled. The regional assemblies outside London were abolished in 2010, and their functions transferred to respective Regional Development Agencies and <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>system</b> of Local authority leaders' boards.|$|E

5|$|Between 5–28 June 1926, {{the station}} was closed to allow the Southern Railway to carry out various works, {{including}} the rebuilding of the platforms, relaying of the tracks and installation of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>system</b> of electrical signalling – the four-aspect colour light scheme. The station was also renovated and the glass roof cleaned. The number of platforms was reduced from nine to eight, with five {{set aside for the}} new electric trains. The signal box spanning the width of the railway bridge was removed. In July 1939, Cannon Street was closed for a week following a fire in Borough Market which prevented any trains accessing it.|$|E
5|$|Dvenadsat Apostolov {{was built}} by the Nikolayev Admiralty Dockyard at Nikolayev. She was laid down on 21 August 1889, {{launched}} on 13 September 1890, and sailed to Sevastopol for fitting out on 11 May 1892. She joined the fleet on 17 June 1893, {{but she was not}} fully ready for service until 1894. In 1895 she was used to test <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>system</b> of laying mines by rails that had been invented by Lieutenant A. P. Ygrumov and also to evaluate the proper dimensions for anti-torpedo nets and their booms. For this last test torpedoes were fired at the ship with the anti-torpedo nets deployed.

Professor E. J. Meany succeeded Foote, followed by John Jeremiah Jacob who served as the school's principal from 1851 to 1853. Jacob later served as West Virginia's first Democratic governor. Reverend Joseph Nelson later served as the school's principal until the American Civil War, and shortly after hostilities ended.|$|E
