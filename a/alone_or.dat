5|$|Adult males live mostly <b>alone</b> <b>or</b> {{in groups}} of two to three, and join pods for short periods of time. Adult females and young {{dolphins}} normally live {{in groups of}} up to 15 animals. However, they live in fission-fusion societies of varying group size, within which individuals change associations, often on a daily or hourly basis. Group compositions are usually determined by sex, age, reproductive condition, familial relations and affiliation histories. In a dolphin community near Sarasota, Florida, the most common group types are adults females with their recent offspring, older subadults of both sexes and adult males either <b>alone</b> <b>or</b> in bonded pairs. Smaller groups can join to form larger groups of 100 or more, and occasionally exceed 1,000.|$|E
5|$|Blue whales most {{commonly}} live <b>alone</b> <b>or</b> with one other individual. It {{is not known}} how long traveling pairs stay together. In locations {{where there is a}} high concentration of food, as many as 50 blue whales have been seen scattered over a small area. They do not form the large, close-knit groups seen in other baleen species.|$|E

5|$|Females are not territorial, {{and live}} <b>alone</b> <b>or</b> with their offspring. Juveniles form mixed-sex groups after weaning, {{but most of}} the young females stay back with their mother, with whom they do not show any {{significant}} interaction. Males eventually mature and try to acquire territories.|$|E

5|$|Like most of {{the species}} of the order Phallales, Clathrus ruber is saprobic—a {{decomposer}} of wood and plant organic matter—and is commonly found fruiting in mulch beds. The fungus grows <b>alone</b> <b>or</b> clustered together near woody debris, in lawns, gardens, and cultivated soil.|$|E
5|$|This rockfowl feeds {{primarily}} on insects, though some plant matter, such as fruit and flower buds, is eaten. One feeding strategy involves following Dorylus army ant swarms, feeding on insects flushed by the ants. Rockfowl {{move through the}} forest mainly {{through a series of}} hops and bounds, or short flights in low vegetation. It travels either <b>alone</b> <b>or</b> in small groups. This species rarely flies for long distances. The grey-necked rockfowl is monogamous and pairs nest either <b>alone</b> <b>or</b> in the vicinity of other pairs, sometimes in colonies of two to five nests, though one colony of forty nests has been recorded. These nests are constructed out of mud and are formed into a deep cup that is built on rock surfaces, typically in caves or on cliffs. Two eggs are laid twice a year. Though the birds breed in colonies, infanticide exists in this species, with rockfowl attempting to kill the young of other pairs. Nestlings mature in about a month.|$|E
5|$|Tolcapone {{inhibits}} {{the activity}} COMT, an enzyme which degrades dopamine. It {{has been used}} to complement levodopa; however, its usefulness is limited by possible complications such as liver damage. A similarly effective drug, entacapone, has not been shown to cause significant alterations of liver function. Licensed preparations of entacapone contain entacapone <b>alone</b> <b>or</b> in combination with carbidopa and levodopa.|$|E

5|$|Ants are {{distinct}} in their morphology from other insects in having elbowed antennae, metapleural glands, {{and a strong}} constriction of their second abdominal segment into a node-like petiole. The head, mesosoma, and metasoma are the three distinct body segments. The petiole forms a narrow waist between their mesosoma (thorax plus the first abdominal segment, which is fused to it) and gaster (abdomen less the abdominal segments in the petiole). The petiole may be formed by one or two nodes (the second <b>alone,</b> <b>or</b> {{the second and third}} abdominal segments).|$|E

In 1047 Stigand was translated to the see of Winchester, but he retained Elmham until 1052. He may have owed the preferment to Earl Godwin of Wessex, the father-in-law of King Edward, although that is disputed by some historians. Emma, who had retired to Winchester after regaining Edward's favour, may also have influenced the appointment, either <b>alone</b> <b>or</b> in concert with Godwin. After his appointment to Winchester, Stigand was a witness to all the surviving charters of King Edward during the period 1047 to 1052.|$|E

5|$|By {{virtue of}} geography, the Royal Navy {{could keep the}} German High Seas Fleet {{confined}} to the North Sea with relative ease, {{but was unable to}} break the German superiority in the Baltic Sea. Both sides were aware, because of the greater number of British dreadnoughts, that a full fleet engagement would likely result in a British victory. The German strategy was, therefore, to try to provoke an engagement on favourable terms: either inducing a part of the Grand Fleet to enter battle <b>alone,</b> <b>or</b> to fight a pitched battle near the German coast, where friendly minefields, torpedo boats, and submarines could even the odds.|$|E

The hunters' goal is to eliminate the monster, while the monster's goal is to consume wildlife and evolve to make themselves stronger.
