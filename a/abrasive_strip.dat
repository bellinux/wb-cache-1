The knife blade shown is a lighter medical item but approximates the shape of a clicker's knife blade, fitting into a comfortable wooden handle with screw-activated jaws.

40|$|Purpose: The {{aim of this}} {{in vitro}} study was to {{evaluate}} the stripping achieved on different teeth (incisors, canines, and premolars) by two grades of <b>abrasive</b> <b>strips</b> used {{for the first and}} tenth time. Our second aim was to test the efficacy of these strips by calculating the time necessary to perform interproximal reductions of 0. 10, 0. 20, and 0. 30 mm. Methods: Four models were constructed using extracted teeth affixed in wax. The upper and lower arches were set on plaster bases and fixed in wax, carefully creating contact points. All model mouths were treated with artificial saliva (Oral Balance®) in order to simulate the biological conditions in the oral cavity. We then tested specific air-rotor strips of different grades and degrees of wear (15 -μm-grain and 25 -μm-grain Orthofile® strips). Afterwards the teeth from all samples were cut lengthwise in half, and each mesial and distal portion was gold-plated and observed under SEM at incremental magnification (30, 60, and 100 μm). Results: The 25 -μm-grain strip was more effective than the 15 -μm-grain strip, irrespective of the tooth involved. Second, the finishing phase with specific polishing strips after interproximal reduction was fundamental in reducing the number of abrasions and irregularities created by stripping, in particular after using the 25 -μm-grain strip. To achieve the best result, the entire abraded area must be polished. Conclusion: This system permits a rapid and effective stripping procedure in direct proportion to the strip's grain and in inverse proportion to the wear from its use. Further research will enable us to compare this system with similar procedures. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: In this {{in-vitro}} study, we {{aimed to}} investigate the predictability of the expected amount of stripping using 3 common stripping devices on premolars. METHODS: One hundred eighty extracted premolars were mounted and aligned in silicone. Tooth mobility was tested with Periotest (Medizintechnik Gulden, Modautal, Germany) (8. 3 ± 2. 8 units). The selected methods for interproximal enamel reduction were hand-pulled strips (Horico, Hapf Ringleb & Company, Berlin, Germany), oscillating segmental disks (O-drive-OD 30; KaVo Dental, Biberach, Germany), and motor-driven <b>abrasive</b> <b>strips</b> (Orthofile; SDC Switzerland, Lugano-Grancia, Switzerland). With each device, the operator intended to strip 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 3, or 0. 4 mm on the mesial side of 15 teeth. The teeth were scanned before and after stripping with a 3 -dimensional laser scanner. Superposition and measurement of stripped enamel on the most mesial point of the tooth were conducted with Viewbox software (dHal Software, Kifissia, Greece). The Wilcoxon signed rank test and the Kruskal-Wallis test were applied; statistical significance was set at alpha ≤ 0. 05. RESULTS: Large variations between the intended and the actual amounts of stripped enamel, and between stripping procedures, were observed. Significant differences were found at 0. 1 mm of intended stripping (P ≤ 0. 05) for the hand-pulled method and at 0. 4 mm of intended stripping (P ≤ 0. 001 to P = 0. 05) for all methods. For all scenarios of enamel reduction, the actual amount of stripping was less than the predetermined and expected amount of stripping. The Kruskal-Wallis analysis showed {{no significant differences between}} the 3 methods. CONCLUSIONS: There were variations in the stripped amounts of enamel, and the stripping technique did not appear to be a significant predictor of the actual amount of enamel reduction. In most cases, actual stripping was less than the intended amount of enamel reduction...|$|R
40|$|Factors {{affecting}} the final surface quality of polished marble {{are not yet}} fully understood. Clarifying these factors for optimization of multivariate polishing process {{by trial and error}} method is difficult, time-consuming, and costly task. In this study, the empirical practices were carried out using an experimental design, specifically, a central composite inscribed (CCI) design. The factors considered in CCI design were belt speed, rotational speed, and pressure of the polishing head, and the responses were surface glossiness and roughness. Mathematical models describing responses were produced using experimental datasets, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to assess the fit of the models generated with the experimental data. For process optimization, desirability function analysis (DFA) was used. This study has shown that the CCI could efficiently be applied for the modelling of polishing machine for surface quality of marble strips. Better surface quality generally resulted from lower belt speeds, which increased contact time between the <b>abrasives</b> and <b>strips.</b> Optimized surface quality for marble specimen was established...|$|R
40|$|To trim {{or not to}} trim beaks? It {{is always}} a good time to raise this {{difficult}} question. Indeed, since the release of the Brambell Committee report 1 on welfare in the UK in 1965, discussion on the welfare of beak-trimmed birds has continued unabated. The aim of this new book (with its 15 contributors) is not, of course, to close the debate but merely to consolidate the huge amount of scientific information available on methods welfare and alternatives to beak-trimming. In the Preface, it is stated that the book will be of interest to welfare groups, policy makers, scientists, industry leaders and students of poultry science who wish to acquaint themselves with the welfare issues associated with beak-trimming and the potential solutions for reducing the need to beak-trim poultry. This goal is achieved to the extent that most of the information (although sometimes rather concisely) is presented in the eight chapters of this 174 page book. The first chapter describes the methods and reasons for beak-trimming. Chapter 2 raises the ethical question of beak-trimming and gives some of {{the pros and cons of}} the arguments. Pain and nerve injuries induced by beak-trimming are presented in Chapters 3 – 5 and the production responses (improved liveability, plumage quality and feed efficiency during egg laying) of beak-trimmed birds are assessed in Chapter 6 with bird health and handling issues associated with beak-trimming in Chapter 7. The last chapter is devoted to alternatives to beak-trimming. It includes environmental enrichment methods; a consideration of the genetics of feather pecking and cannibalism; dietary recommendations to reduce cannibalism in chickens and laying hens; manipulation of light intensities and colour to modify behaviour; management of body weight; application of <b>abrasive</b> <b>strips</b> in the feed trough to blunt the tips of the beaks of laying hens and the use of fitted devices and stock wound spray in injured birds to prevent further pecking. Among all these alternatives, the genetic solution might well prove to be the most sustainable, efficacious and cost effective. Overall, however, throughout the book this reviewer had the feeling, rightly or wrongly, that it was mostly written by opponents of beak-trimming and that arguments of the defence were sometimes omitted.

Two hundred mini-implants were divided into 4 groups with 50 screws equally distributed in five diameters (1. 3 to 1. 7 [*]mm) : control group (CG) : unused mini-implants, G 1 : mini-implants inserted in pig iliac bone and removed, G 2 : same protocol of group 1 followed by sonication for cleaning and autoclave sterilization, and G 3 : same insertion protocol of group 1 followed by sonication for cleaning before and after sandblasting (Al 2 O 3 - 90 [*]µ) and autoclave sterilization. G 2 and G 3 mini-implants were weighed after recycling process to evaluate weight loss (W). All the screws were broken to determine the fracture torque (FT). The influence of recycling process on FT and W was evaluated by ANOVA, Mann-Whitney, and multiple linear regression analysis. Results.

40|$|There is {{currently}} a trend in favor of using fluoride as a coadjuvant in reducing caries indexes, as much in underdeveloped as in developedcountries. However, simultaneously the indexes of dental fluorosis seem to grow in an inverse proportion. This is brought about by chronic ingestion of fluoride for a prolonged length of time or in high concentration. Enamel microabrasion is an effective method to remove superficial stains caused by this condition, which affects esthetics of that tissue. The use of 18 % hydrochloric acid in association with pumice, despite being a simple and low cost method, has been gradually replaced due to its potential of causing damage to periodontal tissues.
