40|$|The {{overall project}} is a system (hardware + software) that allows {{monitoring}} and control in a building / office different security systems, energy, communications, home automation, PKI's overall business that will increase all {{the efficiency of the}} building and the business and ensure the continuity of it. My participation in this Project will mainly focus on the development of hardware components, monitoring and control system (home automation, energy, safety control elements [...] .) and software components for integration with the platform in general. The technology used is Arduino, as it gives us all we need and requires, and also the possibility that if the situation needs it, to expand the number of sensors or devices that we interact autonomously. Specifically, our system will consist of two current sensors using two clamps <b>ampmeter,</b> to take care of reading the power consumption of the electrical network installation. Besides it also will control the charging and discharging of the battery that provides all the energy used in the complex. This is important since because it is necessary to control the activation of the generator that powers this, which gives tension to the facilities. Harnessing the potential of arduino, we will add a small system that act as "ring" to open the door of the company for take control of the acceso n the building, and also to explore all the possibilities that this device provides. We will study the possibilities of communication that has Arduino whith another plattforms and compatibility with technologies and languages such as PHP, MySQL, Asterisk, etc. ...|$|E
40|$|The two magnetometers {{recently}} replaced on the Hubble Space Telescope {{during the}} STS- 61 Servicing Mission {{are now being}} used successfully for Coarse Attitude Determination during spacecraft vehicle safemode recovery operation. The magnetometer alignments relative to the spacecraft's vehicle's reference frame and the magnetic coupling of the sensors to the four magnetic torquer bars were determined. Coarse Attitude determination errors are now reduced {{to an average of}} 0. 6 deg. Magnetometer Sensing System calibration and Coarse Attitude determination testing with the new calibration parameters is a geometrical problem. Telemetered earth magnetic field data was collected at twenty-six different vehicle attitudes. The spacecraft attitudes selected were distributed as widely apart as possible throughout the Geocentric Inertial Coordinate reference frame. It is also desirable to sample the Earth's magnetic field over as many different locations of the spacecraft's passage over the Earth as possible, within the limitation of the +/- 28. 5 deg orbital inclination. A full range of magnetic moment outputs from the torquer bars needs to be sampled, +/- 3600 <b>ampmeters</b> squared, as well as data when the torquer bars have zero current. Graphic utilities were also developed to visually aid in optimizing the data collection process. Finally, a brief discussion of a method for collecting data for future calibrations is suggested...|$|R
