5000|$|Park (1990) {{found that}} [...] "only 16 {{empirical}} {{studies have been}} published on groupthink," [...] and concluded that they [...] "resulted in only partial support of his Janis's hypotheses." [...] Park concludes, [...] "despite Janis' claim that group cohesiveness is the major necessary antecedent factor, no research has showed <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> of cohesiveness on groupthink." [...] Park also concludes that research on the interaction between group cohesiveness and leadership style does not support Janis' claim that cohesion and leadership style interact to produce groupthink symptoms. Park presents {{a summary of the}} results of the studies analyzed. According to Park, a study by Huseman and Drive (1979) indicates groupthink occurs in both small and large decision-making groups within businesses. This results partly from group isolation within the business. Manz and Sims (1982) conducted a study showing that autonomous work groups are susceptible to groupthink symptoms in the same manner as decisions making groups within businesses. Fodor and Smith (1982) produced a study revealing that group leaders with high power motivation create atmospheres more susceptible to groupthink. Leaders with high power motivation possess characteristics similar to leaders with a [...] "closed" [...] leadership style—an unwillingness to respect dissenting opinion. The same study indicates that level of group cohesiveness is insignificant in predicting groupthink occurrence. Park summarizes a study performed by Callaway, Marriott, and Esser (1985) in which groups with highly dominant members [...] "made higher quality decisions, exhibited lowered state of anxiety, took more time to reach a decision, and made more statements of disagreement/agreement." [...] Overall, groups with highly dominant members expressed characteristics inhibitory to groupthink. If highly dominant members are considered equivalent to leaders with high power motivation, the results of Callaway, Marriott, and Esser contradict the results of Fodor and Smith. A study by Leana (1985) indicates the interaction between level of group cohesion and leadership style is completely insignificant in predicting groupthink. This finding refutes Janis' claim that the factors of cohesion and leadership style interact to produce groupthink. Park summarizes a study by McCauley (1989) in which structural conditions of the group were found to predict groupthink while situational conditions did not. The structural conditions included group insulation, group homogeneity, and promotional leadership. The situational conditions included group cohesion. These findings refute Janis' claim about group cohesiveness predicting groupthink.|$|E

[...] The researchers hypothesized that cognitive appraisal and coping would help moderate variables for the children, and therefore the emotional impact of parent conflict would vary based {{on the nature of}} the child's [...] "appraisals and coping strategies" [...] (Rogers & Holmbeck 1997). The researchers tested coping strategies and measured child adjustment based on the children's self-reported emotional and behavioral adjustment, determined from levels of self-worth and depression (Rogers & Holmbeck 1997). The results demonstrated <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> negative <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> of problematic cognitive appraisal on self-worth and <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> positive <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> of problematic cognitive appraisal on depression, thus showing the impact of cognitive appraisal on children's emotional well being and ability to deal with interparental conflict (Rogers & Holmbeck 1997). This study demonstrates the significance of cognitive appraisal in coping with emotionally difficult circumstances and their own behavioral adjustment and self-esteem. An understanding of the role of cognitive appraisal and cognitive appraisal theories can assist psychologists in understanding and facilitating coping strategies, which could contribute to work in the field that acts to facilitate healthy behavioral adjustment and coping strategies in individuals.|$|R
40|$|A {{biological}} pathway represents {{a set of}} genes that serves a particular cellular or a physiological function. The genes within the same pathway are expected to function together and hence may interact with each other. It is also known that many genes, and so pathways, interact with other environmental variables. However, no formal procedure has yet been developed to evaluate the pathway-environment interaction. In this article, we propose a semiparametric method to model the pathway-environment interaction. The method connects a least square kernel machine and a semiparametric mixed effects model. We model nonparametrically the environmental effect via a natural cubic spline. Both a pathway effect and an interaction between a pathway and an environmental effect are modeled nonparametrically via a kernel machine, and we estimate variance component representing an interaction effect under a semiparametric mixed effects model. We then employ a restricted likelihood ratio test and a score test to evaluate the <b>main</b> pathway <b>effect</b> and the pathway-environment interaction. The approach was applied to a genetic pathway data of Type II diabetes, and pathways with either <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>main</b> pathway <b>effect,</b> <b>an</b> interaction effect or both were identified.
