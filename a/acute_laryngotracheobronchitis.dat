40|$|Myxoviruses {{including}} 150 {{strains of}} parainfluenza 1, 15 of parainfluenza 3 {{and five of}} influenza B virus were isolated from nasopharyngeal secretions obtained from 300 children less than 3 years of age who developed <b>acute</b> <b>laryngotracheobronchitis</b> during the preceding 48 hours. The patients were examined between October 1966 and January 1967, the peak monthly rate of virus isolation (67 %) occurring during January. Parainfluenza 1 virus was isolated from air obtained {{in the vicinity of}} one of 30 children whose nasopharyngeal secretions yielded this agent. Samples comprising 150 litres of air were collected for virus assay by placing an Andersen sampler about 60 cm. from the child's face inside an oxygen tent which surrounded the patient. These findings confirm previous observations that parainfluenza 1 virus is the dominant agent associated with <b>acute</b> <b>laryngotracheobronchitis</b> in children in Toronto, and they show that this virus is disseminated in the air...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND The {{cardinal}} sign of airway obstruction stridor {{is well known}} to all medical practitioners. It may {{be defined as the}} presence of hoarse, high pitched, noisy respiration resulting from the turbulent passage of air through a narrow airway. Since stridor is nearly a manifestation of a disorder, which maybe mild or extremely grave, the process underlying the cause should be sought in every case. The investigation of an infant with stridor calls for various ancillary methods of examination in addition to clinical assessment. Though uncommon, managing a child with noisy breathing is seldom easy. A detailed history and a precise and meticulous examination are required for managing a stridulous child. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients attending ENT and Paediatric Department were included in the study. After taking a detailed history and examination, direct laryngoscopy was done. RESULTS 24 patients with stridor were studied. Of which, <b>acute</b> <b>laryngotracheobronchitis</b> were 14 cases, laryngomalacia 3 cases, foreign body bronchus 2 cases. CONCLUSION Most common cause of stridor in children includes <b>acute</b> <b>laryngotracheobronchitis</b> and laryngomalacia. They are more common in children of age less than two...|$|E
40|$|Basing upon {{proprietary}} research including data on 130 {{patients with}} <b>acute</b> steno sing <b>laryngotracheobronchitis,</b> the authors {{conclude that the}} usage of systematic and topical glucocorticosteroids promotes reduction of upper air passages obstruction within 24 chour period among 83 % of patients. Inhalation with moistened air is inefficient and cannot be {{considered as an independent}} method for croup therapy. In this research, 14 % of patients took antibiotics: in most cases with evident or probable bacterial infection; with no evident signs — just about 3 % of patients took the medication. For children with bacterial infections accompanying croup, the introduction of antibiotics had no effect on the croup symptoms dynamics.

40|$|Upper airway {{disease in}} {{childhood}} {{is very common}} and can be life-threatening. It is important to differentiate between the various causes of airway obstruction in children. A croupy cough can signal <b>acute</b> <b>laryngotracheobronchitis</b> (croup), acute epiglottitis, or aspiration of a foreign body. The problem must be quickly and accurately diagnosed, followed by appropriate management and careful monitoring. Morbidity and mortality can be high in certain instances. Therefore, the physician must know the indications for hospitalization...|$|E
40|$|Between November 1962 and March 1963, myxoviruses were {{isolated}} from 95 of 224 children (40. 5 %), {{most of whom}} were aged less than three years, who were admitted to The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, with <b>acute</b> <b>laryngotracheobronchitis</b> (tracheitis or croup). Viral isolates included 87 strains of Parainfluenza- 1, five of Parainfluenza- 3, and three of Influenza A 2. An epidemic of Influenza A 2 afflicted Toronto during March 1963, at which time this virus was isolated from tracheitis patients...|$|E
40|$|Virological {{investigations}} were undertaken on nasopharyngeal secretions from 186 {{children who}} were admitted to the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, with <b>acute</b> <b>laryngotracheobronchitis</b> between December 1961 and March 1962. Patients who required tracheotomy for relief of respiratory obstruction were excluded from this series. Myxoviruses which were isolated from 47 patients included the following antigenic types: 29 Parainfluenza- 1, four Parainfluenza- 2, five Parainfluenza- 3 and nine Influenza B. The average duration of hospitalization, 3. 0 days, was identical for the 47 virus-positive patients and the entire group of 186 patients. Ages of 135 patients were less than three years...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY One {{hundred and}} ten {{children}} were studied 9 years after each {{had been in}} hospital for croup. They were evaluated with a questionnaire, physical examination, allergy skin testing, pulmonary function tests, and a histamine inhalation challenge. Fifty-seven of them had recurrent episodes of croup, and 33 were defined as allergic. The association between allergy and recurrent croup was highly significant. Airways hyper-reactivity was found in 23 of them, and was associated with allergy and recurrent croup. The group of children {{with a history of}} recurrent croup could be distinguished from the group with one or two episodes by male predominance, onset of the disease at a younger age, familial predisposition, a significantly greater association with allergy and airways hyper-reactivity, slightly lower expiratory flow rates in pulmonary function tests, and a tendency towards the subsequent development of asthma. Viral croup (<b>acute</b> <b>laryngotracheobronchitis)</b> is a common childhood respiratory infection charac-terised by inspiratory stridor, hoarse voice, and barking cough. Some children have multiple episodes of croup. This recurrent, or spasmodic...|$|E
40|$|Hoarseness, {{whooping}} cough and strider are {{elements of a}} syndrome of upper airway obstruction. In childhood, <b>acute</b> <b>laryngotracheobronchitis</b> Is by far rile commonest cause of this syndrome. Yet, the differential diagnosis includes a number of rare and severe entities. In many cases, the traditional distinction between viral and spasmodic types is not possible. The value of humidifying therapy has nor been established. In severe cases, nebulized adrenaline is of benefit bur should be reserved for hospital. The effect lasts only two hours and at times a rebound effect is observed. It is now realized that some patients treated with adrenaline can safely be discharged after a {{two to three hours}} observation. There is a large body of evidence that all children arriving at the emergency department with croup should receive steroids without delay. Tills policy results in a much better outcome, with important reduction in hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions and incubations. Oral dexamethasone is the drug of choice it is as effective, easier to administer and cheaper than nebulised budesonide. In most studies, dexamethasone has been used at a dose of 0. 6 mg/kg but {{there is some evidence that}} 0. 15 mg/kg may be just as effective. (C) 1999 Elsevier, Paris...|$|E
40|$|The {{successful}} {{application of}} data mining in highly visible fields like e-business and marketing {{have led to}} the popularity of its use in knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) in other industries and sectors. Among these sectors that are just discovering data mining are the fields of medicine and public health. The medical industries collect huge amounts of healthcare data which, unfortunately, are not “mined” to discover hidden information. We can describe this data as being ‘information rich’ yet ‘knowledge poor’. In the present study, we briefly examine the use of the most important data mining techniques such as Artificial Neural Network to massive volume of data in medical field which is pediatric respiratory disease. After we had trained the network with 699 cases contains input vector and target vector, we tested it with 20 cases without the target vector. The output of the tested cases is one of the following eight examinations (bronchiolitis, pneumonia, acute epiglottitis, pleurisy, emphysema, <b>acute</b> <b>laryngotracheobronchitis,</b> bronchial asthma and bronchiectasis). The present data explained that 90 % of all test cases represent the correct examination. This mean that the experimental results on this medical data illustrate that neural networks are important in Diagnosis of medical data, especially for a large amount of data in a high-dimensional space...|$|E
