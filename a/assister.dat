In spite of their popularity, there are some weak points. The most serious drawback is their hardness to operate especially for the weak users in information technology such as the elderly and blind users. The tactile feedback function has a potential ability for enabling the weak to make full use of the devices. We propose an approach for effectively designing user-friendly haptic applications especially targeted at supporting the weak users. We exemplify our approach through the design and development of an electronic voting system. The system uses a touch panel haptic display for helping the weak to operate with straightforward touch sensations. It allows them to easily confirm, select, and vote their supporting candidate without any <b>assisters.</b> We also conducted a preliminary evaluation to verify the effectiveness of the system.

This second open enrollment period is shorter than the first- only 15, 2015. The health insurance Marketplace is the official source for people to get information about and enroll in health coverage under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The mechanisms the ACA has put in place to connect people with the Marketplace are the ACA website, healthcare. gov; the toll free call center, 1 - 800 - 318 - 2596; and individual <b>assisters</b> such as navigators, non-navigator assistance personnel, and certified application counselors, who are trained and employed by local organizations. There are also various other informal ways a person can learn about the Marketplace, but ultimately enrollment is accomplished through healthcare. gov. Texas data from the June 2014 Health Reform Monitoring Survey (HRMS) tell us which Marketplace resources people utilized the most, which methods were easiest, and where improvements can be made. We provide this data to inform those engaged in enrollment activities so that they will understand what Texans found most helpful and where improvements are needed. As the data show, some enrollment methods were widely utilized and perceived as very helpful. As we move into the second open enrollment period, each available method will need to be at peak performance to facilitate the enrollment of {{the hundreds of thousands of}} Texans who are eligible for subsidized plans but remain uninsured...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the {{experiences}} of gay and lesbian college students engaged in leadership and the meaning they made of their leadership self-efficacy development, particularly as it related to their identity development and various environmental <b>assisters</b> and constraints. The study sought to identity what shaped the development of leadership self-efficacy for these students and generated additional questions for future research. Using Grounded Theory Methodology, this study explored the primary research question: How do gay and lesbian college students engaged in leadership develop their leadership self-efficacy? Three interviews were held each with 10 students who self-identified as gay, lesbian, queer, or sexually fluid who were highly involved in leadership activities on campus. The theory that emerged from the participants' experiences centered on the individual's self-efficacy to engage in leadership defined within the context of their beliefs about the nature of leadership engagement. The self-efficacy of the students was enhanced by support, success, and deep and broad involvement and was diminished by failure and active criticism. The students&# 8223; gay, lesbian, or queer identities served to either improve self-efficacy or leadership or had no demonstrable effect, according to the participants&# 8223; stories. Sexual orientation served to improve self-efficacy for engagement in leadership by broadening perspectives, improving relationships and comfort within groups, allowing the participants to bring their full selves to their experiences, creating empathy and understanding, and improving personal awareness. Participants also shared that their identities were integral to their involvements, that being out increased their overall self-confidence, that greater comfort led to greater involvement, and that visibility and voice was important to their leadership self-efficacy. Students also shared that their sexual orientation did not have an appreciable effect on their leadership self-efficacy when they already had a great deal of confidence to engage in leadership, when they had already integrated their sexual orientations, when situations did not relate to their sexual orientations, or when the saliency of their sexual orientations was lower than other aspects of their personality...|$|R
