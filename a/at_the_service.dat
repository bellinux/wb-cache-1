The {{memorial}} service, held at Westminster Abbey on 26 February, {{was attended}} by Major-General Peter Gillett and Secretary of State for Defence Michael Heseltine, who represented the Queen and Prime Minister respectively. Thirty regiments and many other formations and associations were represented <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>service.</b>|$|E
5|$|Services {{were held}} at the National Cathedral, and over 1,000 persons attended.

5|$|After Evans {{sold the}} Klan's former headquarters, it was {{purchased}} by the Catholic Church. The Cathedral of Christ the King was later built on the site. Evans attended the building's dedication and spoke highly of the service, surprising many observers. His attendance <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> was his last significant public appearance as Imperial Wizard: he stepped down soon afterwards, having become deeply unpopular {{with members of the}} Klan, who felt that he had embraced their enemies. He resigned on June10, 1939, and was replaced as Imperial Wizard by Colescott.|$|E

5|$|Banks {{died of a}} {{heart attack}} at a Chicago {{hospital}} on January 23, 2015, eight days before his 84th birthday. Following a public visitation, a memorial service was held at the Fourth Presbyterian Church.

After the service, a procession moved from Downtown Chicago past Wrigley Field.|$|E
5|$|Cagney died at his Dutchess County farm in Stanfordville, New York, on Easter Sunday 1986, {{of a heart}} attack. He was 86 years old. A funeral Mass {{was held}} at Manhattan's St. Francis de Sales Roman Catholic Church. The eulogy at the funeral was given by his close friend, who was also the President of the United States at the time, Ronald Reagan. His pallbearers {{included}} the boxer Floyd Patterson, the dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov (who had hoped to play Cagney on Broadway), actor Ralph Bellamy, and the director Miloš Forman. Governor Mario M. Cuomo and Mayor Edward I. Koch were also in attendance <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>service.</b>|$|E

5|$|Macdonald {{suggests}} thatunlike Wagner, Alkan did {{not seek}} to refashion the world through opera; nor, like Berlioz, to dazzle the crowds by putting orchestral music <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> of literary expression; nor even, as with Chopin or Liszt, to extend the field of harmonic idiom. Armed with his key instrument, the piano, he sought incessantly to transcend its inherent technical limits, remaining apparently insensible to the restrictions which had withheld more restrained composers.|$|E
5|$|The Aggie Band {{is unique}} among college bands; no other band eats and lives {{together}} as a military unit, even <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Service</b> Academies and military colleges. Bandsmen wear their cadet uniforms to class, drill, meetings, and other functions on campus. As a requested component of football away games, they perform at more football games than any other band. As of 1993, the band performed at 125 of the last 131 football games, including a streak of 42 straight from 1981 to 1984. Demand is extremely high for the band and one person, upon finding out the Aggie Band would not be performing at the local football game versus A, returned and requested a refund for 40 tickets.|$|E
5|$|Albert and Victoria {{chose the}} names Louisa Caroline Alberta. She was baptized on 13 May 1848 in Buckingham Palace's private chapel by John Bird Sumner, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Though she was christened Louisa <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>service,</b> she was {{invariably}} known as Louise throughout her life. Her godparents were Duke Gustav of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (her paternal great-great-uncle, for whom Prince Albert stood proxy); the Duchess of Saxe-Meiningen (for whom her great-aunt Queen Adelaide stood proxy); and the Hereditary Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (her first cousin once-removed, {{for whom the}} Duchess of Cambridge stood proxy). During the ceremony, the Duchess of Gloucester, {{one of the few}} children of King George III who was still alive, forgot where she was, and suddenly got {{up in the middle of}} the service and knelt at the Queen's feet, much to the Queen's horror.|$|E

5|$|Barker was cremated at {{a private}} humanist funeral at Banbury Crematorium, which was {{attended}} only by family and close friends. A public memorial service for Barker was held on 3 March 2006 at Westminster Abbey, with some 2,000 people in attendance. Corbett, Richard Briers, Josephine Tewson, Michael Grade, and Peter Kay all read <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>service,</b> while others in attendance included David Jason, Stephen Fry, Michael Palin, Leslie Phillips, Lenny Henry, Dawn French and June Whitfield. A recording of Barker's rhyming slang sermon from The Two Ronnies was played, and while the cross was in procession in the aisle of the abbey, it was accompanied by four candles {{instead of the usual}} two, in reference to the Four Candles sketch. Barker was the third comedy professional to be given a memorial at Westminster Abbey, after Joyce Grenfell and Les Dawson.|$|E
5|$|DuMont {{struggled}} to get its programs aired {{in many parts of}} the country, in part due to technical limitations of network lines maintained by the telephone company AT Corporation. During the 1940s and 1950s, television signals were sent between stations via coaxial cable and microwave links which were owned by <b>AT</b> <b>The</b> <b>service</b> provider did not have enough cable lines and microwave circuits to provide signal relay service from all four networks to all of their affiliates at the same time, so AT allocated times when each network could offer live programs to their affiliates. In 1950, AT allotted NBC and CBS each over 100 hours of live prime time network service, but gave ABC only 53 hours, and DuMont just 37. AT also required each television network to lease both radio and television lines. DuMont was the only television network without a radio network, but was forced to pay for a service it did not use. DuMont protested AT's actions with the Federal Communications Commission, and eventually received a compromise.|$|E
5|$|Henry died in 1542 and his son, Henry Clifford, 2nd Earl of Cumberland, {{inherited}} the family estates. During the Rising of the North, in which Catholic magnates rebelled against ElizabethI, Henry remained {{loyal to the}} Tudor dynasty despite the Cliffords being a Catholic family. He dismantled Appleby Castle {{to prevent it from}} being used against royal forces, {{and at the same time}} put Brougham <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> of the Elizabethan government, although there was no fighting at the castle. Under the second and third earls, Henry and George, the castle was still used as a residence, with the third earl being born at Brougham Castle. However, it was under George that the building began to decay and by 1592 it was deserted. George Clifford spent much time either in southern England in his role as Queen's Champion or at Skipton. An inventory of the castle's contents in 1595 demonstrates that the structure was a neglected, meagrely furnished place, and what little furniture there was old and in disrepair.|$|E
5000|$|In 1910, Edward VII died. The {{words of}} the Reverend D. J. Garland <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>services</b> of Sunday 8 May 1910 {{reflected}} {{the mood of the}} congregation. Garland said the King's death had [...] "come with a suddenness which had been so shocking that it was impossible for anyone to speak calmly of the calamity which had befallen the Empire". Many of those present <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>services</b> were wearing mourning clothes. The Holy Trinity Women's Guild along with many other groups, delivered a wreath to <b>the</b> Brisbane mayoress <b>at</b> <b>the</b> town hall.

5|$|Oswald Watt drowned at Bilgola Beach, near Newport, New South Wales, on 21May 1921. Cuts and {{bruising}} on {{his body}} indicated that he had slipped on rocks, struck his head, and rolled unconscious into relatively shallow water. Survived by his 15-year-old son, he was accorded a military funeral two days later at St Jude's Church, Randwick. Members of the AFC, Royal Air Force, and Australian Aero Club formed a guard of honour <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>service,</b> {{one of the largest}} in the suburb's history, which also included representatives of the Royal Australian Navy and Australian Army. Among the tributes was a floral wreath from an anonymous group of French admirers, and another that was dropped by parachute from a low-flying plane. On 31May, Watt's body was cremated and his ashes interred in the family vault at St Jude's.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} appointment, Ramon Perellos became {{very active in}} {{correcting}} cases of corruption and abuse within the Order. One such case involved the request by knights to receive graces and be nominated to the title of Gran Croce di Grazia (literally: great cross by grace). This title implied that a graced knight could replace a knight of the Great Cross upon the latter's death. This procedure was not well reputed among elder knights who spent their lifetime <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> of the Order, and resulted in many of them retiring {{to return to their}} homelands and leave their inheritances to their respective families, against the rules of the Order. The pleas of Perellos to eliminate such prejudicial recommendations were considered legitimate by Pope Innocent XII who agreed to forbid them.|$|E
