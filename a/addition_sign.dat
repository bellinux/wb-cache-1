50|$|In January 2010, {{complaints}} against the VADOC were filed in US District Court stating deaf and {{hard of hearing}} inmates could not properly communicate {{with friends and family}} outside the facility, had no visual notifications for safety announcements in the facilities, and had limited access to sign-language interpreters.

In <b>addition,</b> <b>sign</b> language versions of rules, proceedings, medical appointments, meals, and events were also made available, and interpreters were brought in twice a week.|$|E
50|$|One type of {{directional}} control is the directional pad or D-Pad. The D-Pad {{is designed to}} look like an <b>addition</b> <b>sign</b> with each branch being one of the four cardinal directions; left, right, up, and down. It has been around since the original Nintendo Entertainment System, and has been in every Nintendo system since. Another feature in the recent console controllers are the analog sticks, used for 360ْ {{directional control}}. Often used for camera angle control, the idea is to give the player full control by allowing any direction to be used. The analog controls made their first appearance in the 1970s consoles under the name joystick; they made a reappearance in console systems with the Nintendo 64. Analog sticks have been used in every modern console since. There is no analog stick on the Wii Remote, but it is present on the Nunchuk attachment bundled with the Wii console. The most recent development in directional controls is free motion control. Using accelerometers in the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, acceleration in any direction can be detected and measured. This is still a new type of control scheme and is fully taken advantage of in the Wii as well as the PlayStation 3's SIXAXIS controller, and PlayStation MOVE controller that has tilt detection.|$|E

40|$|Even the {{simplest}} narratives combine multiple strands of information, integrating different characters and their actions by expressing multiple perspectives of events. We examined {{the emergence of}} referential shift devices, which indicate changes among these perspectives, in Nicaraguan Sign Language (NSL). Sign languages, like spoken languages, mark referential shift grammatically with a shift in deictic perspective. In <b>addition,</b> <b>sign</b> languages can mark the shift with a point or a movement {{of the body to}} a specified spatial location in the three-dimensional space in front of the signer, capitalizing on the spatial affordances of the manual modality. We asked whether the use of space to mark referential shift emerges early in a new sign language by comparing the first two age cohorts of deaf signers of NSL. Eight first-cohort signers and ten second-cohort signers watched video vignettes and described them in NSL. Narratives were coded for lexical (use of words) and spatial (use of signing space) devices. Although the cohorts did not differ significantly in the number of perspectives represented, second-cohort signers used referential shift devices to explicitly mark a shift in perspective in more of their narratives. Furthermore, while {{there was no significant difference}} between cohorts in the use of non-spatial, lexical devices, there was a difference in spatial devices, with second-cohort signers using them in significantly more of their narratives. This suggests that spatial devices have only recently increased as systematic markers of referential shift. Spatial referential shift devices may have emerged more slowly because they depend on the establishment of fundamental spatial conventions in the language. While the modality of sign languages can ultimately engender the syntactic use of three-dimensional space, we propose that a language must first develop systematic spatial distinctions before harnessing space for grammatical functions...|$|E
40|$|Background: A {{growing body}} of {{research}} is raising concern regarding the prevalence of poor vitamin D status among athletes. Besides it’s well known association with low bone mineral density, an <b>addition</b> <b>sign</b> of vitamin D deficiency is muscular weakness and soreness, suggesting that deficiency in athletic populations may inhibit optimal physical performance and increase the risk of injury. It is difficult to achieve optimal vitamin D status through diet alone, so it is important to assess all sources of vitamin D, including dietary intake, supplementation, and amount and frequency of sun exposure to obtain a comprehensive profile of vitamin D risk. Currently, there are no studies that include such a complete profile of vitamin D risk in collegiate football players. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the associations between sun exposure and diet, as markers of vitamin D status, and training-induced muscle soreness in collegiate football players. More specifically, this study assesses if total sun exposure and dietary vitamin D intake are related to muscle soreness. Methods: Twenty-four male collegiate football players were recruited for this cross-sectional study in October 2015. Player body composition was measured using a multi-current bioelectrical impedance analyzer (BIA). Dietary intake, sun exposure, and muscle soreness data were collected via interview. The Sun Exposure Questionnaire and the Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) were used to assess weekly sun exposure and muscle soreness, respectively. Results: The mean vitamin D intake (10. 8 ± 9. 5 mcg) was below the RDA for vitamin D (15 mcg), with only 7 participants (29. 2 %) meeting or exceeding the RDA. Dietary vitamin D intake was inversely associated with portion of muscle sore (rs = - 0. 393, p = 0. 029). SF-MPQ total and affective scores were each inversely associated with weekly time outdoors (rs = - 0. 362, p = 0. 041; rs = - 0. 449, p = 0. 014, respectively). T-test analysis found that the mean SF-MPQ affective pain score was significantly lower for players with a time outdoors score above the mean (p = 0. 04). Conclusion: There is a high prevalence of insufficient dietary vitamin D intake (70. 8 %) identified in a collegiate football team. Our findings suggest that higher dietary vitamin D intake and more time spent outdoors are associated with a lower proportion of muscular soreness and decreased perceived pain. Thus, achieving a satisfactory vitamin D status, through a combination of diet and sun exposure, may reduce vitamin D deficiency associated risks, including lowering muscle soreness, thereby serving to enhance athletic performance...|$|E
