This was a three-day match completed on the Tuesday with MCC winning by 5 wickets. Derbyshire won the toss, elected to bat and Grace proceeded to bowl {{them out for}} a mere 36. His figures were 8–23. Derbyshire then bowled MCC out for 74, Grace scoring 7. Grace took 2 more wickets in Derbyshire's second innings of 118 to give him his second 10-wicket match of the season. He scored 37 in the second innings as MCC made 81–5 to take the match.|$|E

Scott Burns reprised his role as producer and audio engineer, and now with a major advantage: Sepultura were at his home studio, Morrisound, a studio properly equipped to record their music style. Their label Roadrunner granted a $40,000 budget, which helped explain the album's improved production values. That allowed Igor and Burns, for example, to spend <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>week</b> just testing the drum kit's tunings and experimenting with microphone practice.|$|E

As a result, he is forced to attend a seminar camp being held on a remote island in order to be allowed to pass to his next grade. Three other {{students}} are at the camp: Yuka Kawashima, the leader of the group; Haruka Higuchi, a quiet girl who is an ace student; and Okuhiko Iida, a wealthy playboy who is the heir of the Iida Financial Group. Makoto also meets three girls unrelated to the seminar camp: a wealthy girl named Saki Asakura; and the sisters Kurumi and Izumi Morino, who are temporarily running the café Lunabeach on the island. The seven find they cannot leave the island due to a tropical cyclone that makes the boats unable to leave for <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>week,</b> and become friends during the week.|$|E

Highlights for Best {{included}} hat-tricks against West Ham United and Southampton, {{as well as}} a goal against Sheffield United that came after he beat four defenders in a mazy run. However, he was also sent off against Chelsea, was the subject of death threats, and failed to turn up for training for <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>week</b> in January as he instead spent his time with Miss Great Britain 1971, Carolyn Moore. On 17 November, he was the subject of Eamonn Andrews's This Is Your Life when he was surprised at a central London restaurant.

25|$|As a {{university}} professor {{for much of his}} life, Dijkstra saw teaching not just as a required activity but as a serious research endeavor. His approach to teaching was unconventional. His lecturing style has been described as idiosyncratic. When lecturing, the long pauses between sentences have often been attributed to the fact that English is not Dijkstra's first language. However the pauses also served as a way for him to think on his feet and he was regarded as a quick and deep thinker while engaged in the act of lecturing. His courses for students in Austin {{had little to do with}} computer science but they dealt with the presentation of mathematical proofs. At the beginning of each semester he would take a photo of each of the students, in order to memorize their names. He never followed a textbook, with the possible exception of his own while it was under preparation. When lecturing, he would write proofs in chalk on a blackboard rather than using overhead foils. He invited the students to suggest ideas, which he then explored, or refused to explore because they violated some of his tenets. He assigned challenging homework problems, and would study his students' solutions thoroughly. He conducted his final examinations orally, over <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>week.</b> Each student was examined in Dijkstra's office or home, and an exam lasted several hours.|$|E
