25|$|This is a sub-diffraction technique. Examples of {{scanning}} probe microscopes are the <b>atomic</b> <b>force</b> <b>microscope</b> (AFM), the Scanning tunneling microscope, the photonic force microscope and the recurrence tracking microscope. All such methods use the physical contact {{of a solid}} probe tip to scan the surface of an object, {{which is supposed to}} be almost flat.|$|E
25|$|First, the {{invention}} of the scanning tunneling microscope in 1981 which provided unprecedented visualization of individual atoms and bonds, and was successfully used to manipulate individual atoms in 1989. The microscope's developers Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer at IBM Zurich Research Laboratory received a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1986. Binnig, Quate and Gerber also invented the analogous <b>atomic</b> <b>force</b> <b>microscope</b> that year.|$|E
25|$|Determining {{the forces}} {{required}} to move atoms {{past each other}} is a challenge in designing nanomachines. In 2008 scientists {{for the first time}} were able to move a single atom across a surface, and measure the forces required. Using ultrahigh vacuum and nearly zero temperature (5 K), a modified <b>atomic</b> <b>force</b> <b>microscope</b> was used to drag a cobalt atom, and a carbon monoxide molecule, across surfaces of copper and platinum.|$|E

Nanosurf’s <b>atomic</b> <b>force</b> <b>microscopes</b> (AFM) and scanning tunneling microscopes (STM) are used for metrological surface inspections and for the visualization of structures on the nanometer scale.|$|R
50|$|SGMs were {{developed}} in the late 1990s from <b>atomic</b> <b>force</b> <b>microscopes.</b> Most importantly, these had to be adapted for use at low temperatures, often 4 kelvin or less, as the samples under study do not work at higher temperatures. Today an estimated number of ten research groups worldwide use the technique.|$|R
25|$|Structurally, {{pentacene}} {{is one of}} {{the linear}} acenes, the previous one being tetracene (four fused benzene rings) and the next one being hexacene (six fused benzene rings). In August 2009, a group of researchers from IBM published experimental results of imaging a single molecule of pentacene using an <b>atomic</b> <b>force</b> <b>microscope.</b> In July 2011, they used a modification of scanning tunneling microscopy to experimentally determine the shapes of the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{important}} modern developments. The <b>atomic</b> <b>force</b> <b>microscope</b> (AFM) and the Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) are two early versions of scanning probes that launched nanotechnology. There are {{other types of}} scanning probe microscopy. Although conceptually similar to the scanning confocal microscope developed by Marvin Minsky in 1961 and the scanning acoustic microscope (SAM) developed by Calvin Quate and coworkers in the 1970s, newer scanning probe microscopes have much higher resolution, since they are not limited by the wavelength of sound or light.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, there was {{evidence}} that in the radial direction they are rather soft. The first transmission electron microscope observation of radial elasticity suggested that even the van der Waals forces can deform two adjacent nanotubes. Later, nanoindentations with <b>atomic</b> <b>force</b> <b>microscope</b> were performed by several groups to quantitatively measure radial elasticity of multiwalled carbon nanotubes and tapping/contact mode atomic force microscopy was also performed on single-walled carbon nanotubes. Young's modulus of {{on the order of}} several GPa showed that CNTs are in fact very soft in the radial direction.|$|E
40|$|A {{method to}} {{determine}} the spring constant of colloid probe cantilevers used in <b>atomic</b> <b>force</b> <b>microscopes</b> (AFM) was described.

Giessibl is the inventor of the qPlus sensor, a sensor for Non-contact <b>atomic</b> <b>force</b> microscopy that relies on a quartz cantilever. His invention has enabled <b>atomic</b> <b>force</b> microscopy to obtain subatomic spatial resolution on individual atoms and submolecular resolution on organic molecules. Today, the qPlus sensor is used in many commercial and homebuilt <b>atomic</b> <b>force</b> <b>microscopes.</b>|$|R
5|$|Silicon nitride is {{also used}} in xerographic process {{as one of the}} layer of the photo drum. Silicon nitride {{is also used}} as an {{ignition}} source for domestic gas appliances. Because of its good elastic properties, silicon nitride, along with silicon and silicon oxide, is the most popular material for cantilevers — the sensing elements of <b>atomic</b> <b>force</b> <b>microscopes.</b>|$|R
25|$|Dip-pen {{nanolithography}} is {{a process}} that uses an <b>atomic</b> <b>force</b> <b>microscope</b> to transfer molecules on the tip to a substrate. Initially the tip is dipped into a reservoir with an ink. The ink on the tip evaporates and leaves the desired molecules attached to the tip. When the tip is brought into contact with the surface a water meniscus forms between the tip and the surface resulting in the diffusion of molecules from the tip to the surface. These tips can have radii in the tens of nanometers, and thus SAM molecules can be very precisely deposited onto a specific location of the surface. This process was discovered by Chad Mirkin and co-workers at Northwestern University.|$|E
25|$|Nano-FTIR (nanoscale Fourier {{transform}} infrared spectroscopy) is a {{scanning probe}} technique {{that can be}} considered as a combination of two techniques: Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM). As s-SNOM, nano-FTIR is based on atomic-force microscopy (AFM), where a sharp tip is illuminated by an external light source and the tip-scattered light (typically back-scattered) is detected as a function of tip position. A typical nano-FTIR setup thus consists of an <b>atomic</b> <b>force</b> <b>microscope,</b> a broadband infrared light source used for tip illumination, and a Michelson interferometer acting as Fourier transform spectrometer. In nano-FTIR, the sample stage is placed in one of the interferometer arms, which allows for recording both amplitude and phase of the detected light (unlike conventional FTIR that normally does not yield phase information). Scanning the tip allows for performing hyperspectral imaging (i.e. complete spectrum at every pixel of the scanned area) with nanoscale spatial resolution determined by the tip apex size. The use of broadband infrared sources enables the acquisition of continuous spectra, which is a distinctive feature of nano-FTIR compared to s-SNOM.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a concise {{survey of the}} most {{commonly}} used feedback loops for <b>atomic</b> <b>force</b> <b>microscopes.</b> In addition it proposes feedback control loops in order to minimize the effect of thermal noise on measurements of weak forces, and to improve the manipulability of the AFM. Growing requirements to study and fabricate systems of ever-shrinking size mean that ever-increasing performance of instruments like <b>atomic</b> <b>force</b> <b>microscopes</b> (AFM) is needed. A typical AFM consists of a micro-cantilever with a sharp tip, a sample positioning system, a detection system and a control system. Present day commercial AFMs use a standard PI controller to position the micro-cantilever tip at a desired distance from the sample. There is still a need for studies showing the optimal way to tune these controllers in order to achieve high closed-loop positioning performance. The choice of other controller structures, more suitable for dealing with the robustness/performance compromise can also be a solution. ...|$|R
40|$|Development of {{microelectronics}} requires {{solution of}} the problem ensuring unity of linear measurements in a submicron range.

Calibration results of an optical measuring microscope are given in the paper. The paper reveals that an additive error depends on parameters of a material and the form of measured elements for an optical measuring microscope. The methodical error of <b>atomic</b> <b>force</b> <b>microscopes</b> is predicated on the probe point shape.
