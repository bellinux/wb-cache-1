One of these factors is restricted brain coverage so that whole-brain <b>ASL</b> <b>fMRI</b> studies have never been reported. The present study tested the ability of a multislice continuous <b>ASL</b> (CASL) <b>fMRI</b> approach using a small surface coil placed on the subject's neck to map changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) throughout the brain while healthy individuals (N = 15) performed memory-guided sequential finger movements at a mean rate of similar to 0. 5 Hz. As predicted by results from a large number of studies, reliable task-related increases in flow were detected across subjects not only in primary and associative cortical areas but also in subcortical brain regions. When normalized to baseline, rCBF increased 31 % in the hand representation area (HRA) of left primary motor cortex (M 1) 13 % in the left supplementary motor area proper (SMA), 10 % in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), 10 - 18 % in the bilateral intraparietal sulci, 6 % in the HRA of left putamen, 10 % in the left thalamus, and 17 % in the right anterior cerebellum. In addition to these increases, 6 % and 4 % decreases in rCBF were detected in the HRA of the right M 1 and the bilateral posterior cingulate sulci, respectively. These results demonstrate that perfusion-based fMRI using CASL with a separate labeling coil can now be used to characterize task-related flow changes in most of the brain volume with adequate accuracy and sensitivity.

Recently, more and more researches have started to investigate functional connectivity in PTSD subjects using BOLD-fMRI. Functional connectivity analysis has been demonstrated as a powerful approach to identify biomarkers of different brain diseases. This study aimed to detect resting-state functional connectivity abnormities in patients with PTSD using arterial spin labeling (<b>ASL)</b> <b>fMRI.</b> As a completely non-invasive technique, ASL allows quantitative estimates of cerebral blood flow (CBF). Compared with BOLD-fMRI, <b>ASL</b> <b>fMRI</b> has many advantages, including less low-frequency signal drifts, superior functional localization, etc. In the current study, ASL images were collected from 10 survivors in mining disaster with recent onset PTSD and 10 survivors without PTSD. Decreased regional CBF in the right middle temporal gyrus, lingual gyrus, and postcentral gyrus was detected in the PTSD patients. Seed-based resting-state functional connectivity analysis was performed using an area in the right middle temporal gyrus as region of interest. Compared with the non-PTSD group, the PTSD subjects demonstrated increased functional connectivity between the right middle temporal gyrus and the right superior temporal gyrus, the left middle temporal gyrus. Meanwhile, decreased functional connectivity between the right middle temporal gyrus and the right postcentral gyrus, the right superior parietal lobule was {{also found in the}} PTSD patients. This is the first study which investigated resting-state functional connectivity in PTSD using ASL images. The results may provide new insight into the neural substrates of PTSD.

40|$|Abstract. Although {{the study}} of {{cerebral}} vasoreactivity using fMRI is mainly conducted through the BOLD fMRI modality, owing to its relatively high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), <b>ASL</b> <b>fMRI</b> provides a more interpretable measure of cerebral vasoreactivity than BOLD <b>fMRI.</b> Still, <b>ASL</b> suffers from a low SNR and is hampered by {{a large amount of}} physiological noise. The current contribution aims at improving the recovery of the vasoreactive component from the ASL signal. To this end, a Bayesian hierarchical model is proposed, enabling the recovery of perfusion levels as well as fitting their dynamics. On a single-subject ASL real data set involving perfusion changes induced by hypercapnia, the approach is compared with a classical GLM-based analysis. A better goodness-of-fit is achieved, especially in the transitions between baseline and hypercapnia periods. Also, perfusion levels are recovered with higher sensitivity and show a better contrast between gray- and white matter...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} {{applicability}} of arterial spin labeling (ASL) in comparison to blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) contrast fMRI in detecting brain activations elicited by active and passive hand movements. Materials and Methods: A block design for <b>ASL</b> and BOLD <b>fMRI</b> was applied in 8 healthy subjects using active and passive hand tasks. Data analyses were performed at individual and group level, comparing both the different movements {{and the performance of}} the two techniques. Results: Group analyses showed involvement of the same areas during both tasks, as the contralateral sensorimotor cortex, supplementary motor area, cerebellum, inferior parietal lobes, thalamus. ASL detected smaller activation volumes than BOLD, but the areas had a high degree of colocalization. Few significant differences (P < 0. 05) were found when the two tasks were compared for the number of activated voxels, coordinates of center of mass, and CBF estimates. Considering together all the areas, the mean %BOLD change was 0. 79 ± 0. 27 and 0. 73 ± 0. 24 for the active and passive movements respectively, while the mean %CBF changes were 34. 1 ± 8. 9 and 27. 1 ± 14. 8.

40|$|At present, {{there are}} few {{clinically}} effective pain therapies available to treat chronic pain. One reason {{is due to a}} lack of understanding about how pain emerges in the brain. Excitingly, an emerging body of work suggests that the perfusion imaging technique, arterial spin labelling (ASL), is particularly well-suited to investigate this issue. The primary aim of this thesis is to develop and optimise a quantitative perfusion imaging approach to investigate the neural correlates of both experimental and pathological tonic pain. In Chapter 2, we explore different methods of inducing ongoing pain in healthy subjects. Results from this study show that mechanically induced pain is well suited for use in <b>ASL</b> <b>FMRI</b> experiments. In Chapter 3, we compare currently available <b>ASL</b> <b>FMRI</b> approaches for investigating tonic states, using a range of sensory paradigms. Results from these experiments support the use of an optimised version of Continuous <b>ASL</b> (CASL) <b>FMRI</b> to obtain whole-brain perfusion. Additionally, we discuss our decision to proceed with the newly acquired pseudo-continuous ASL (pCASL); a novel ASL technique that benefits from maximal signal-to-noise (SNR) across a whole-brain volume. In Chapter 4 we implement the pCASL FMRI approach to image the neural correlates of ongoing experimental pain. Results from the investigation of parametrically modulated ongoing mechanical pain show robust pain-related activation of key pain related regions that are monotonically active with an increase in stimulus intensity. Additionally, data from this experiment shows the presence of complex perfusion dynamics relative to pain worthy of further study. In Chapter 5, we optimised the pCASL sequence to obtain absolute perfusion changes across the whole-brain volume, using multi-inversion times, so that we could investigate the perfusion dynamics observed in Chapter 4. Results show that absolute perfusion changes during tonic pain are considerably less than for regions recruited during a non- pain task. Additionally, dynamic perfusion changes show complex stimulus responses across all active regions regardless of stimulus type. We conclude that while the technique is well suited to quantify absolute perfusion, the mechanisms underlying the dynamic changes in CBF (neuronal signal, neurovascular coupling) need further study. Finally, in Chapter 6, we implement the absolute perfusion approach developed in Chaper 5 to interrogate the neural correlates of the genetic pain disease, Erythromelalgia, and pleasurable relief. The results of this study show pain-related activation (and relief-induced reduction) of key pain-related regions. We conclude from these results that the ASL technique developed over the course of this thesis can be used to study a range of pain pathologies. Taken together, the results of this thesis document the development of a powerful perfusion imaging technique capable of quantifying absolute perfusion changes across a whole-brain volume. The data presented here from investigations of both experimental and pathological pain states supports the use of this technique in future tonic pain studies, as well as other neuroscience applications. We are confident that implementation of this imaging approach will provide integral insight into the mechanisms of ongoing pain states; and further the development of novel efficacious pain treatment options.

Serial perfusion measures for 30 min during two self-limited periods of partnered penis stimulation, and during post-stimulatory periods, revealed novel sexual activity-related cerebral blood flow (rCBF) changes, mainly in subcortical parts of the brain. Ventral pallidium rCBF was highest during the onset of penile erection, and lowest after the termination of penis stimulation. The perceived level of sexual arousal showed the strongest positive association with rCBF in the right basal forebrain. in addition, our results demonstrate that distinct subregions of the hypothalamus and cingulate cortex subserve opposite functions during human male sexual behavior. The lateral hypothalamus and anterior part of the middle cingulate cortex showed increased rCBF correlated with penile erection. By contrast, the anteroventral hypothalamus and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex exhibited rCBF changes correlated with penile detumescence after penile stimulation. Continuous rapid and high-resolution brain perfusion imaging during normal sexual activity has provided novel insights into the central mechanisms that control male sexual arousal.

Arterial spin labeling (ASL) is an MRI method that can provide direct measures of functional cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes. Because CBF is a well-defined physiological quantity that contrib-utes to BOLD contrast, CBF measures can be used to improve the quantitative interpretation of fMRI studies. However, {{due in part to the}} low intrinsic signal-to-noise ratio of the ASL method, measures of functional CBF changes in the LGN are challenging and have not previously been reported. In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of using <b>ASL</b> <b>fMRI</b> to measure the CBF response of the LGN to visual stimulation on a 3 T MRI system. The use of background suppression and physiological noise reduction techniques allowed reliable detection of LGN activation in all five subjects studied.

40|$|By {{comparing}} hemodynamic signals acquired {{immediately before}} and during activation, {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) is well suited for mapping acute changes in brain function. However, it remains unclear whether fMRI can map functional changes over longer periods. Here, we address this issue by empirically testing the feasibility of arterial spin labeling (<b>ASL)</b> <b>fMRI</b> to detect changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) with baseline and task separated by 1 month. To increase the sensitivity of the method, we applied an algorithm that yielded flow density (CBFd) images that were independent of tissue content. To increase the accuracy, we developed a technique that generated arterial transit time at each voxel, independently. Results showed that activation changes in CBFd during the same session were statistically the same as across 30 days. The activation CBFd on day- 30 was 34 % (motor) and 25 % (visual) higher than the respective baselines of 83 and 107 [*]mL/ 100 [*]g/min obtained on day- 1. Furthermore, the signal-to-noise ratio of the CBFd measurement was 2. 1 and 2. 9 times higher than that of the conventional CBF for within-subject and across-subjects comparisons, respectively (n= 9 healthy young subjects). Taken together, these results indicate that CBFd measure could be better suited than net CBF to map long-term changes in brain function...|$|R

Knowing this is important to allow appropriate inferences from functional imaging studies of epileptic activity. Recent blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) studies have demonstrated negative BOLD responses (NBR) in frontal, parietal and posterior cingulate cortices during generalised spike wave activity (GSW). We hypothesized that GSW-related NBR commonly reflect decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF). We measured BOLD and cerebral blood flow responses using simultaneous EEG with BOLD and arterial spin label (<b>ASL)</b> <b>fMRI</b> at 3 T. Four patients with epilepsy were studied; two with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) and two with secondary generalized epilepsy (SGE). We found GSW-related NBR in frontal, parietal and posterior cingulate cortices. We measured the coupling between BOLD and CBF changes during GSW and normal background EEG and found {{a positive correlation between}} the simultaneously measured BOLD and CBF throughout the imaged volume. Frontal and thalamic activation were seen in two patients with SGE, concordant with the electro-clinical features of their epilepsy. There was striking reproducibility of the GSW-associated BOLD response in subjects previously studied at 1. 5 T. Our results show a preserved relationship between BOLD and CBF changes during rest and GSW activity consistent with normal neurovascular coupling in patients with generalized epilepsy and in particular during GSW activity.

The established method relies on an epoch of iso-metabolic blood flow increase, typically induced by CO 2 breathing, to calibrate the BOLD-CBF relationship at resting-state CMR(O 2). Here, we discuss the systematic bias in CMR(O 2) -CBF data that can be introduced depending on the value derived for the calibration constant (M) from the CO 2 breathing epoch. We demonstrate that the fidelity of BOLD-CBF data acquired during the neural activation task have low impact on the tightness of CMR(O 2) -CBF coupling, as well as the coupling slope, when the derived calibration value is of a relatively moderate amplitude (M in the range of, or greater than, 10 - 15 at 1. 5 T). Via the standard reformulation of a grid in BOLD-CBF space into the CMR(O 2) -CBF plane, we demonstrate the non-linear transformation that takes place and the sources of systematic bias that result. We find that the outcome of a neurovascular coupling study may be predicted to a large extent purely from the value of the calibration constant, M, that is used.

However, the cerebral blood flow (CBF) measurements obtained with <b>ASL</b> <b>fMRI</b> have not been fully validated, particularly during global CBF modulations. We present a comparison of cerebral blood flow changes (ΔCBF) measured using a flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery (FAIR) ASL perfusion method to those obtained using H 2 15 O PET, which is the current gold standard for in vivo imaging of CBF. To study regional and global CBF changes, a group of 10 healthy volunteers were imaged under identical experimental conditions during presentation of 5 levels of visual stimulation and one level of hypercapnia. The CBF changes were compared using 3 types of region-of-interest (ROI) masks. FAIR measurements of CBF changes were found to be slightly lower than those measured with PET (average ΔCBF of 21. 5 ± 8. 2 % for FAIR versus 28. 2 ± 12. 8 % for PET at maximum stimulation intensity). Nonetheless, there was a strong correlation between measurements of the two modalities. Finally, a t-test comparison of the slopes of the linear fits of PET versus ASL ΔCBF for all 3 ROI types indicated no significant difference from unity (P>. 05). Copyright © 2008 Jean J. Chen et al.

Taking advantage of the ASL noise properties, we were able to study tonic CBF changes during uninterrupted 6 -min continuous performance of working memory and sustained attention tasks. For the visual sustained attention task, regional CBF increases (6 – 12 ml/ 100 g/min) were detected in the right middle frontal gyrus, the bilateral occipital gyri, and the anterior cingulate/medial frontal gyri.

However, {{the debate surrounding}} whether {{the origin of this}} response phase is neuronal or vascular, and whether it provides functionally relevant information, that is additional to what is contained in primary response, means that undershoots are widely overlooked. We simultaneously recorded electroencephalography (EEG), BOLD and cerebral blood-flow (CBF) [obtained from arterial spin labelled (<b>ASL)</b> fMRI] <b>fMRI</b> responses to hemifield checkerboard stimulation to test the potential neural origin of the fMRI post-stimulus undershoot. The post-stimulus BOLD and CBF signal amplitudes in both contralateral and ipsilateral visual cortex depended on the post-stimulus power of the 8 - 13 Hz (alpha) EEG neuronal activity, such that trials with highest EEG power showed largest fMRI undershoots in contralateral visual cortex. This correlation in post-stimulus EEG-fMRI responses was not predicted by the primary response amplitude. In the contralateral visual cortex we observed a decrease in both cerebral rate of oxygen metabolism (CMRO 2) and CBF during the post-stimulus phase. In addition, the coupling ratio (n) between CMRO 2 and CBF was significantly lower during the positive contralateral primary response phase compared with the post-stimulus phase and we propose that this reflects an altered balance of excitatory and inhibitory neuronal activity. Together our data provide strong evidence that the post-stimulus phase of the BOLD response has a neural origin which reflects, at least partially, an uncoupling of the neuronal responses driving the primary and post-stimulus responses, explaining the uncoupling of the signals measured in the two response phases. We suggest our results are consistent with inhibitory processes driving the post-stimulus EEG and fMRI responses. We therefore propose that new methods are required to model the post-stimulus and primary responses independently, enabling separate investigation of response phases in cognitive function and neurological disease...|$|R
50|$|Bimodal bilinguals are {{individuals}} who are fluent in both sign language and oral language. The effect of this language experience on the brain compared to brain regions in monolinguals or bilinguals of oral languages has only recently become a research interest, but is now used to provide insight on syntactic integration and language control of bilinguals. PET scans of a 37-year-old, right handed, bilingual (English and American Sign Language) male with left frontal lobe damage revealed evidence of increased right hemisphere activity compared to normal controls during spontaneous generation of narrative in both English and American Sign Language (<b>ASL).</b> Research with <b>fMRI</b> has found that showing sign language to deaf and hearing signers and showing written English to hearing non-signers activates the classical language areas of the left hemisphere in both cases.Studies in this area generally compare the behaviour or brain activity in normally hearing monolingual speakers of an oral language, genetically deaf, native signers, and normally hearing bimodal bilinguals. With the use of functional Near-Infrared Imaging (fNIR), Kovelman (2009) compared the performance and brain activity of these three groups in picture-naming tasks. These researchers found that, although performance in all groups was similar, neuroimaging revealed that bilinguals showed greater signal intensity within the posterior temporal regions (Wernicke's area) while using both languages in rapid alternation than when they were only using one language.|$|R
40|$|Combined blood {{oxygenation}} level-dependent (BOLD) and {{arterial spin labeling}} (<b>ASL)</b> functional MRI (<b>fMRI)</b> {{was performed}} for simultaneous investigation of neurovascular coupling in the primary visual cortex (PVC), primary motor cortex (PMC), and supplementary motor area (SMA). The hypercapnia-calibrated method was employed to estimate the fractional change in cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMR(O 2)) using both a group-average and a per-subject calibration. The group-averaged calibration showed significantly different CMR(O 2) -CBF coupling ratios in the three regions (PVC: 0. 34 +/- 0. 03; PMC: 0. 24 +/- 0. 03; and SMA: 0. 40 +/- 0. 02). Part of this difference emerges from the calculated values of the hypercapnic calibration constant M in each region (M(PVC) = 6. 6 +/- 3. 4, M(PMC) = 4. 3 +/- 3. 5, and M(SMA) = 7. 2 +/- 4. 1), while a relatively minor part comes from the spread {{and shape of the}} sensorimotor BOLD-CBF responses. The averages of the per-subject calibrated CMR(O 2) -CBF slopes were 0. 40 +/- 0. 04 (PVC), 0. 31 +/- 0. 03 (PMC), and 0. 44 +/- 0. 03 (SMA). These results are 10 - 30 % higher than group-calibrated values, and are potentially more useful for quantifying individual differences in focal functional responses. The group-average calibrated motor coupling value is increased to 0. 28 +/- 0. 03 when stimulus-correlated increases in end-tidal CO(2) are included. Our results support the existence of regional differences in neurovascular coupling, and argue for the importance of achieving optimal accuracy in hypercapnia calibrations to resolve method-dependent variations in published results...|$|R
40|$|Neuroanatomic {{substrates}} {{of specific}} cognitive functions have been inferred from anatomic distributions of activated pixels during fMRI studies. With declarative memory tasks, interest {{has focused on}} the extent to which various medial temporal lobe anatomic structures are activated while subjects encode new information. The aim of this project was to examine how commonly used variations in fMRI data processing methods affect the distribution of activation in anatomically defined medial temporal lobe regions of interest (ROIs) during a complex scene-encoding task. ROIs were drawn on an MRI anatomic template formed from 3 D SPGR scans of eight subjects combined in Talairach space. Separate ROIs were drawn for the posterior and anterior hippocampal formation, parahippocampal gyrus, and entorhinal cortex. Twelve different activation maps were created for each subject by using four correlation coefficients and three cluster volumes. Friedman’s two-way ANOVA by ranks was used to test the hypothesis that the distribution of activated pixels among defined anatomic ROIs varied as a function of the data processing method. By simply varying the combination of correlation coefficient and cluster volume, significantly different distributions of activation within named medial temporal lobe structures were obtained from the same <b>fMRI</b> datasets (<b>P</b> < 0. 015; P < 0. 001). The number of subjects studied (n � 8) is in a range commonly found in the literature yet this clearly resulted in spurious associations between processing parameter variations and activation distribution. Using data processing methods that are independent of the arbitrary selection of cutoff values for thresholding activation maps may reduce the likelihood of obtaining spurious results. © 2001 Academic Pres...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} few years much has been {{published}} to validate new technology in brain mapping for clinical purposes, but there have been few clinical results. In this report we describe our five-year experience in the surgical management of malignant gliomas around motor areas with an evaluation of the impact of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) plus navigator and intraoperative neurophysiology (IN). End-points were extent of removal, morbidity, and survival. Variables describing patient and tumor characteristics and treatment modalities were statistically weighted in relation to treatment outcome. Tumor depth (P = 0. 01), midline shift >/= 1 cm. (P = 0. 05), and insular location (P = 0. 001) negatively affected extent of removal, whereas IN (P 65 years (P = 0. 01) were associated with the occurrence of complications. Overall survival was significantly higher in patients operated with IN or <b>fMRI</b> plus navigator (<b>P</b> < 0. 01). Comparing different surgical strategies used in the same period, we observed that supportive technologies in glioma surgery have their primary impact on the quality of resection and survival. IN led to transient motor impairment and some additional complications which did not affect functional outcome...|$|R
40|$|Context Working memory (WM) {{deficits in}} {{patients}} with schizophrenia have mainly been associated with prefrontal dysfunction. However, the contribution of perceptual deficits and abnormalities in sensory areas has not been explored. The present study closes this important gap {{in our understanding of}} WM dysfunction in schizophrenia by monitoring neural activity during WM encoding and retrieval with event-related potentials (ERPs) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Objective To investigate the neurophysiological changes that contribute to WM impairment in early-onset schizophrenia at perceptual and cognitive stages using the ERP components P 1, P 3 a, P 370, and <b>P</b> 570 and <b>fMRI</b> data from extrastriate visual areas. Design We conducted the study between June 1, 2003, and December 20, 2006. Electroencephalographic and fMRI data were acquired separately during a visual delayed discrimination task. Participants encoded up to 3 abstract shapes that were presented sequentially for 600 milliseconds each and decided after a 12 -second delay whether a probe matched 1 of the sample stimuli. Setting Between-group study at an inpatient psychiatric hospital and outpatient psychiatric facilities. Participants Seventeen adolescents with early-onset schizophrenia according to DSM-IV criteria and 17 matched controls participated in the study. Main Outcome Measures Amplitude of the ERP components P 1, P 3 a, P 370, and P 570 and the fMRI signal from extrastriate visual areas. Results The P 1 amplitude was reduced in patients during encoding and retrieval. The P 1 amplitude increased with WM load during encoding only in controls. In this group, a stronger P 1 amplitude increase predicted better WM performance. The P 1 reduction was mirrored by reduced activation of visual areas in patients in <b>fMRI.</b> The <b>P</b> 370 amplitude during encoding and retrieval was also reduced in patients. Conclusions The P 1 amplitude reduction indicates an early visual deficit in adolescents with schizophrenia. Our findings suggest that P 1 is of particular relevance for successful WM encoding. Early visual deficits contribute to impaired WM in schizophrenia in addition to deficits in later memory-related processes...|$|R
40|$|The {{affinity}} {{and temporal}} course of functional fields in middle and posterior superior temporal cortex for the categorization of complex sounds was examined using functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) and event-related potentials (ERPs) recorded simultaneously. Data were compared before and after subjects were trained to categorize a continuum of unfamiliar nonphonemic auditory patterns with speech-like properties (NP) and a continuum of familiar phonemic patterns (<b>P).</b> <b>fMRI</b> activation for NP increased after training in left posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). The ERP P 2 response to NP also increased with training, and its scalp topography was consistent with left posterior superior temporal generators. In contrast, the left middle superior temporal sulcus (mSTS) showed fMRI activation only for P, and this response was not affected by training. The P 2 response to P was also independent of training, and its estimated source was more anterior in left superior temporal cortex. Results are consistent with a role for left pSTS in short-term representation of relevant sound features that provide the basis for identifying newly acquired sound categories. Categorization of highly familiar phonemic patterns is mediated by long-term representations in left mSTS. Results provide new insight regarding the function of ventral and dorsal auditory streams...|$|R
40|$|The {{emerging}} technique of real-time fMRI neurofeedback trains individuals to regulate their own brain activity via feedback from an fMRI measure of neural activity. Optimum feedback presentation {{has yet to}} be determined, particularly when working with clinical populations. To this end, we compared continuous against intermittent feedback in subjects with tinnitus. Fourteen participants with tinnitus completed the whole experiment consisting of nine runs (3 runs ×  3  days). Prior to the neurofeedback, the target region was localized within the auditory cortex using auditory stimulation (1  kHz tone pulsating at 6  Hz) in an ON-OFF block design. During neurofeedback runs, participants received either continuous (n =  7, age 46. 84  ±  12. 01, Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) 49. 43  ±  15. 70) or intermittent feedback (only after the regulation block) (n =  7, age 47. 42  ±  12. 39, TFI 49. 82  ±  20. 28). Participants were asked to decrease auditory cortex activity that was presented to them by a moving bar. In the first and the last session, participants also underwent arterial spin labeling (<b>ASL)</b> and resting-state <b>fMRI</b> imaging. We assessed tinnitus severity using the TFI questionnaire before all sessions, directly after all sessions and six weeks after all sessions. We then compared neuroimaging results from neurofeedback using a general linear model (GLM) and region-of-interest analysis as well as behavior measures employing a repeated-measures ANOVA. In addition, we looked at the seed-based connectivity of the auditory cortex using resting-state data and the cerebral blood flow using ASL data. GLM group analysis revealed that a considerable part of the target region within the auditory cortex was significantly deactivated during neurofeedback. When comparing continuous and intermittent feedback groups, the continuous group showed a stronger deactivation of parts of the target region, specifically the secondary auditory cortex. This result was confirmed in the region-of-interest analysis that showed a significant down-regulation effect for the continuous but not the intermittent group. Additionally, continuous feedback led to a slightly stronger effect over time while intermittent feedback showed best results in the first session. Behaviorally, there was no significant effect on the total TFI score, though on a descriptive level TFI scores tended to decrease after all sessions and in the six weeks follow up in the continuous group. Seed-based connectivity with a fixed-effects analysis revealed that functional connectivity increased over sessions in the posterior cingulate cortex, premotor area and part of the insula when looking at all patients while cerebral blood flow did not change significantly over time. Overall, these results show that continuous feedback is suitable for long-term neurofeedback experiments while intermittent feedback presentation promises good results for single session experiments when using the auditory cortex as a target region. In particular, the down-regulation effect is more pronounced in the secondary auditory cortex, which might be more susceptible to voluntary modulation in comparison to a primary sensory region...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the development, implementation {{and application of}} various quantitative {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) approaches at ultra-high magnetic field including the assessment with regards to applicability and reproducibility. Functional MRI (fMRI) commonly uses the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contrast to detect functionally induced changes in the oxy-deoxyhaemoglobin composition of blood which reflect cerebral neural activity. As these blood oxygenation changes do not only occur at the activation site but also downstream in the draining veins, the spatial specificity of the BOLD signal is limited. Therefore, the focus has moved towards more quantitative fMRI approaches such as arterial spin labelling (ASL), vascular space occupancy (VASO) or calibrated fMRI which measure quantifiable physiologically and physically relevant parameters such as cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV) or cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO 2), respectively. In this thesis a novel MRI technique was introduced which allowed the simultaneous acquisition of multiple physiological parameters in order to beneficially utilise their spatial and temporal characteristics. The advantages of ultra-high magnetic field were utilised to achieve higher signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios compared to lower field strengths. This technique was successfully used to study the spatial and temporal characteristics of CBV, CBF and BOLD in the visual cortex. This technique is the first one that allows simultaneous acquisition of CBV, CBF and BOLD weighted fMRI signals in the human brain at 7 Tesla. Additionally, this thesis presented a calibrated fMRI technique which allowed the quantitative estimation of changes in cerebral oxygen metabolism at ultra-high field. CMRO 2 reflects the amount of thermodynamic work due to neural activity and is therefore a significant physical measure in neuroscience. The calibrated fMRI approach presented in this thesis was optimised for the use at ultra-high field by adjusting the MRI parameters as well as implementing a specifically designed radio-frequency (RF) pulse. A biophysical model was used to calibrate the fMRI data based on the simultaneous acquisition of BOLD and CBF weighted MRI signals during a gas-breathing challenge. The reproducibility was assessed across multiple brain regions and compared to that of various physiologically relevant parameters. The results indicate that the degree of intra-subject variation for calibrated fMRI is lower than for the classic BOLD contrast or <b>ASL.</b> Consequently, calibrated <b>fMRI</b> is a viable alternative to classic fMRI contrasts with regards to spatial specificity as well as functional reproducibility. This calibrated fMRI approach was also compared to a novel direct calibration technique which relies on complete venous oxygenation saturation during the calibration scan via a gas-breathing challenge. This thesis introduced several reliable quantitative fMRI approaches at 7 Tesla and the results presented are a step forward to the wider application of quantitative fMRI...|$|R
