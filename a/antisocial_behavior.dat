5|$|In a 1989 {{review of}} the {{research}} on juvenile delinquency and violence, Lisabeth DiLalla and Gottesman found delinquency could be transitory or continuous, and genes contributed more to the continuous type. In 1991 the same authors published a critique of the then-prevalent idea of <b>antisocial</b> <b>behavior</b> being transmitted through generations by child abuse alone in antisocial families. They stated that a review by Cathy Spatz Widom and the studies she cited had missed an element: children maltreated in families might have been targets because their genes might have influenced them into committing antisocial acts and attracting such treatment from parents.|$|E
5|$|The Javan rhino is {{much less}} vocal than the Sumatran; very few Javan rhino vocalizations have ever been recorded. Adults have no known predators other than humans. The species, {{particularly}} in Vietnam, is skittish and retreats into dense forests whenever humans are near. Though a valuable trait from a survival standpoint, it has made the rhinos difficult to study. Nevertheless, when humans approach too closely, the Javan rhino becomes aggressive and will attack, stabbing with the incisors of its lower jaw while thrusting upward with its head. Its comparatively <b>antisocial</b> <b>behavior</b> may be a recent adaptation to population stresses; historical evidence suggests they, like other rhinos, were once more gregarious.|$|E

40|$|In adolescence, youth <b>antisocial</b> <b>behaviors</b> reach a peak. Parents can use {{different}} strategies, such as parental solicitation and control, {{to monitor their}} children’s activities and try to prevent or reduce their <b>antisocial</b> <b>behaviors.</b> However, it is still unclear if, and for which adolescents, these parental monitoring behaviors are effective. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine if the impact of parental solicitation and control on adolescent <b>antisocial</b> <b>behaviors</b> depends on adolescent empathy. In order to comprehensively address this aim, we tested the moderating effects of multiple dimensions (affective and cognitive) of both trait and state empathy. Participants were 379 Dutch adolescents (55. 9 % males) involved in a longitudinal study with their fathers and mothers. At T 1 (conducted when adolescents were 17 -years-old) adolescents filled self-report measures of <b>antisocial</b> <b>behaviors</b> and trait empathy during one home visit, while their state empathy was rated during a laboratory session. Furthermore, parents reported their own monitoring behaviors. At T 2 (conducted one year later, when adolescents were 18 -years-old), adolescents reported again on their <b>antisocial</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Moderation analyses indicated that both affective and cognitive state empathy moderated the effects of parental solicitation on adolescent <b>antisocial</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Results highlighted that solicitation had unfavorable effects on <b>antisocial</b> <b>behaviors</b> in adolescents with high empathy whereas the opposite effect was found for adolescents with low empathy. In contrast, neither state nor trait empathy moderated the effects of control on adolescent <b>antisocial</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationships}} between parental behavioral control, psychological control and self-esteem, life satisfaction, <b>antisocial</b> <b>behaviors</b> and depression among Turkish adolescents. Participants for the present study consisted of 333 adolescents (168 girls, 163 boys) between the age of 13 to 15 with a mean of 13. 90 (SD=. 514) years. Participants completed measures on behavioral control, psychological control and self-esteem, life satisfaction, <b>antisocial</b> <b>behaviors</b> and depression. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that behavioral control positively predicted life satisfaction, self-esteem, and negatively predicted <b>antisocial</b> <b>behaviors</b> and depression. Psychological control was significantly and positively predicted <b>antisocial</b> <b>behaviors</b> and depression, negatively predicted life satisfaction. Present study provided evidence for the role of behavioral and psychological control in adolescents’ self-esteem, life satisfaction, depression and <b>antisocial</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Also, findings underscore the role of differential associations of parental behavioral and psychological control with the well-being and ill-being of adolescents.

Participants for the current study were 497 Dutch adolescents (56. 9 % males) followed from age 13 to 18, and their mothers. A series of cross-lagged panel models revealed reciprocal associations between maternal empathy and mother-adolescent relationship quality and between mother-adolescent relationship quality and adolescent <b>antisocial</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Interestingly, we also found some indirect effects of adolescent <b>antisocial</b> <b>behaviors</b> on maternal empathy mediated by mother-adolescent relationship quality.

40|$|Poster Session: Social Neuroscience: Social InteractionIntroduction: Psychopathy is {{characterized}} by its shallow affect, callous lack of empathy or remorse and a parasitic and impulsive lifestyle. It {{is closely related to}} <b>antisocial</b> <b>behaviors</b> (Hare & Neumann, 2008). Previously, structural brain imaging studies examined the gray matter volumes (GMV) in various brain regions that were associated with psychopathy and <b>antisocial</b> <b>behaviors.</b> To be specific, it was shown that psychopathic traits were associated with brain structural abnormalities in both cortical and subcortical regions including striatum (Buckhotz et al., 2010) and insula (Ly et al., 2012). However, the volumetric findings regarding <b>antisocial</b> <b>behaviors</b> were mixed. On the other hand, cortical thickness analyses in psychopathy and <b>antisocial</b> <b>behaviors</b> received much less attention than the brain volumetric ones until recent years (Narayan, 2007). Previously, it was found that psychopaths had significantly cortical thinning in a number of brain regions including left insula (Ly et al., 2012). Nevertheless, prior studies suffered from four major limitations: psychopathy was studied as a categorical variable (Wahlund & Kristiansson, 2009); the specific part or side of hemisphere in the striatum or insula relating to psychopathy or <b>antisocial</b> <b>behaviors</b> was not examined; uni-modal neuroimaging method was applied; and sample size was small. The present study aimed to address the literature gap by examining the relationship of specific brain structural abnormalities in terms of cortical thickness and GMV with specific subtypes of psychopathy and <b>antisocial</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Methods: Eighty nine participants (38 murderers, 51 non-murderers) (77 males, 12 females) were recruited from Nanjing Brain Hospital in Nanjing, China. Murderers were detainees accused of homicide who were undergoing forensic psychiatric evaluation. Their structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) data and psychopathic traits as well as IQ were measured. All sMRI data was acquired using a 1. 5 T GE Signa scanner with a single-shot gradient echo MPRAGE sequence (TR = 25 ms, TE = 6 ms, field of view = 24 cm, matrix = 256 x 256, flip angle = 45 °, thickness = 1. 2 mm, 124 continuous sagittal slices without gap). Cortical thickness and volumetric segmentation was estimated using FreeSurfer software (FreeSurfer 4. 0. 5, [URL] (Dale, Fischl, & Sereno, 1999; Fischl et al., 1999, 2002). Further manual tracing on volumetric segmentation was done using BrainSuite (Shattuck et al., 2002). Results: The cortical thickness analysis revealed significant differences (p< 0. 05) in insula in murderers as well as in high psychopathy group. Specifically, cortical thinning in both left and right insula was found in murderers when compared to non-murderers, controlling for IQ and psychopathy factor. Also, it was found that high psychopathy group had significant greater cortical thickness in both left and right insula controlling for IQ and <b>antisocial</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Moreover, the correlations between cortical thickness in insula and psychopathy scores were significantly different between murderers and non-murderers (p< 0. 05). Correlation sesults showed that murderers had significantly more psychopathic traits and reduced GMV in left caudate and total caudate (p< 0. 05). In addition, positive correlations were only found between right putamen GMV and psychopathic traits, particularly for the total and factor one score of PCL-R (p< 0. 05). Conclusions: Cortical thickness and gray matter volumetric (GMV) findings revealed that specific subtypes of psychopathic traits and <b>antisocial</b> <b>behaviors</b> were related to brain structural abnormalities in striatum GMV and insula cortical thickness. In particular, the brain volumetric findings suggested that the two components of striatum (caudate and putamen) were distinctly related to psychopathic traits and <b>antisocial</b> <b>behaviors.</b> These help us better understand the neural mechanisms in psychopathy and <b>antisocial</b> <b>behaviors...</b>|$|R

40|$|Introduction: This {{study was}} aimed {{to find out}} the effect of CBT on the {{behaviors}} i. e. depressive, agressive and <b>antisocial</b> <b>behaviors</b> as well as cognitive functions of patients who were treated in rehabilitation unit at a drug addiction hospital (Rumah Sakit Ketergantungan Obat) in Jakarta. Method: The research design was Quasi experimental pre-post test without control group by providing intervention: CBT for 6 sessions (10 – 12 times intervention). The population was all patients in the rehabilitation unit with a nursing diagnosis: low self esteem and/or inffective coping strategies. There were 23 participants who involved in this investigation. The data was analized by using dependent and independent sample t, and anova tests. Result: The results showed that p value for depressive behaviours, agressive behaviurs, <b>antisocial</b> <b>behaviors,</b> and cognitive functions were 0. 914; 0. 001; 0. 039; 0. 003 respectively. The outcomes indicated that there was significant impact of CBT on agressive <b>behaviors,</b> <b>antisocial</b> <b>behaviors,</b> and cognitive functions (α = 0. 05, p value 0. 05). Discussion: It is argued that depressive symptoms might not be apparent for the users in rehabilitative phase. The findings also showed that there was significant relation between <b>antisocial</b> <b>behaviors</b> and the length of drug USAge. This affirms exsiting concepts in that long drug USAge brings about serious damage in the users 2 ̆ 7 behaviors and cognitive functions.
