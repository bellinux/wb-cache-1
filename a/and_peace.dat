60|$|It {{was very}} strange to me to {{discover}} this; and very dreadful--but I saw it to be quite an undeniable fact. The common notion that <b>peace</b> <b>and</b> the virtues of civil life flourished together, I found, to be wholly untenable. <b>Peace</b> <b>and</b> the vices of civil life only flourish together. We talk of <b>peace</b> <b>and</b> learning, <b>and</b> of <b>peace</b> <b>and</b> plenty, <b>and</b> of <b>peace</b> <b>and</b> civilisation; but I found that those were not the words which the Muse of History coupled together: that on her lips, the words were--peace <b>and</b> sensuality, <b>peace</b> <b>and</b> selfishness, <b>peace</b> <b>and</b> corruption, <b>peace</b> <b>and</b> death. I found, in brief, that all great nations learned their truth of word, and strength of thought, in war; that they were nourished in war, and wasted by peace; taught by war, and deceived by peace; trained by war, and betrayed by peace;--in a word, that they were born in war, <b>and</b> expired in <b>peace.</b>|$|R
