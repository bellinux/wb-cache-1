The change is shown in E with aging time at 160 C (320 F) for the three alloys.

This decrease in E generally follows the strength reversion. On further aging beyond the reversion well, E increases and then decreases again as the alloy overage. The slightly higher modulus in the T 8 than in the T 3 temper is consistent with the presence of the high modulus T sub 1 phase in the T 8 temper.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} was performed to determine the hydrogen isotope fractionation factors between water vapor and “water” dissolved as hydroxyl groups in rhyolitic and feldspathic glasses and melts. Experiments were carried out in quartz tubes with a large excess of water at 530 – 850 °C and P_(H 2 O) = 1. 4 – 2. 8 bars. Infrared measurements of water concentration profiles and isotopic reversal experiments indicate that equilibrium was attained during the 210 – 5400 hr runs. The fractionation factors ([D/H_(vapor) ]/[D/H_(glass) ]) between the vapor and dissolved water in the glasses decrease from <b>about</b> <b>1.</b> 051 to 1. 040 for rhyolite glass and <b>1.</b> <b>049</b> to <b>1.</b> 035 for albite-orthoclase glass as temperature increases from 530 to 750 °C. These fractionations are greater than those observed for most hydrous mineral-water systems at these temperatures, perhaps reflecting the strong hydrogen bonding of hydroxyl groups in the studied glasses. The measured fractionation factor for rhyolitic melt accounts for the observed decreases in δD with decreasing water contents of obsidians erupted from young rhyolitic volcanoes and supports a two-stage degassing history of these magmas.

Temperatures between 1, 224 and <b>1,</b> <b>049</b> C were investi-gated at fO 2 QFM. DVDP 2 basanite {{appears to be}} an intermediate pressure liquid or a cumulate, because only olivine coexists with melt from above 1, 224 – 1, 160 C. High-Ca pyroxene joins olivine in the crystallization sequence at 1, 138 C. These minerals are joined by pla-gioclase at a temperature between 1, 120 and 1, 104 C. In contrast, DVDP 2 hawaiite appears to be relatively evolved, because it is multiply saturated with olivine, plagioclase, and high-Ca pyroxene near its liquidus (between 1, 120 and 1, 104 C). Plagioclase crystallizes in the Ne-hawaiite by 1, 160 C followed by olivine below 1, 120 C. The liquidus of anorthoclase phonolite is be-tween the lowest temperatures investigated, 1, 089 and <b>1,</b> <b>049</b> C, and plagioclase is the liquidus mineral. Our results indicate that DVDP 2 hawaiite can be derived from a DVDP 2 basanitic parental magma by crystal fractionation at low pressures, that the nepheline ha-waiite is an olivine cumulate, and that the liquids parental to the anorthoclase phonolite represent the end products of crystal fractionation.

These dimers are connected by slipped – {{interactions between the}} benzene rings of neighbouring molecules [centroid–centroid distance = 3. 671 (3) A ̊ and slippage = <b>1.</b> <b>049</b> (3) Å].

40|$|HJQuinpirole is a {{dopamine}} agonist {{with high}} {{affinity for the}} D 2 and D 3 dopamine receptor subtypes. A variety of drugs, most notably monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOls), inhibit the bind-ing of [H]quinpirole, but not H]spiperone or [H 1 (-) -N-n-pro-pylnorapomorphine, in rat striatal membranes by a mechanism that {{does not appear to}} involve the enzymatic activity of MAO. This study extends the characterization of MAOI-displaceable [3 H}quinpirole binding in rat brain. Clinically antidepressant MAOIs exhibited selectivity between sites labeled by [H]quin-pirole and H]spiperone as did a number of structurally related propargylamines and N-acylethylenediamine derivatives and other drugs such as debrisoquin and phenylbiguanide. The MAOIs clorgyline and Ro 41 - <b>1</b> <b>049</b> were the most potent. Anti-depressant MAOls inhibited [H]quinpirole binding with the fol...|$|R
