5|$|In 1884, {{after four}} years in the workhouse, Merrick {{contacted}} a showman named Sam Torr and proposed that Torr should exhibit him.

Norman's shop, directly <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> London Hospital, was visited by a surgeon named Frederick Treves, who invited Merrick to be examined and photographed.

5|$|In 1914, {{while working}} for the Balboa Amusement Producing Company, William Jossey wrote the {{screenplay}} for the first feature-length film adaptation.

Contemporary writers credited Bertram Bracken as director, as do some modern sources, including the American Film Institute. Others consider the film the directorial debut of J. Gordon Edwards. Both men subsequently had long careers directing for Fox Film.|$|E

5|$|Now {{an escape}} seemed like Berkman's only option. The {{plan was to}} rent a house <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> prison and dig an {{underground}} tunnel from {{the house to the}} prison. Berkman had been given access to {{a large portion of the}} prison and had grown familiar with its layout. In April 1900, a house was leased. The tunnel would be dug from the cellar of the house to the stable inside the prison yard. When the digging was complete, Berkman would sneak into the stable, tear open the wooden flooring, and crawl through the tunnel to the house.|$|E
