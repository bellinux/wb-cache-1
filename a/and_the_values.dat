5|$|By {{combining}} {{the distance between}} the aircraft and satellite, speed, and heading with aircraft performance constraints (e.g. fuel consumption, possible speeds and altitudes), investigators generated candidate paths that were analysed separately by two methods. The first assumed the aircraft was flying on one of the three autopilot modes (two are further affected by whether the navigation system used magnetic north or true north as a reference), calculated the BTO and BFO values along these routes, and compared them with the values recorded from Flight 370. The second method generated paths which had the aircraft's speed and heading adjusted at the time of each handshake to minimise the difference between the calculated BFO of the path <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>values</b> recorded from Flight 370. A probability distribution for each method at the BTO arc of the sixth handshake of the two methods was created and then compared; 80 percent of the highest probability paths for both analyses combined intersect the BTO arc of the sixth handshake between 32.5°S and 38.1°S, which can be extrapolated to 33.5°S and 38.3°S along the BTO arc of the seventh handshake.|$|E

Ground check was implemented in August 2016. This study utilized Geographic Information System technology (GIS), remote sensing and by utilizing Google Earth to capture aerial photo. The result from this research showed that each year the shoreline changes, either it was abrasion or accretion.

In democratic nations where the public elects those in charge of establishing or administering the tax system, these choices reflect the type of community that the public wishes to create. In countries where the public does not have a significant amount of influence over the system of taxation, that system may reflect more closely the values of those in power.|$|E
25|$|Given that {{a factor}} {{is used in}} the {{production}} of a range of first-order goods, its value is determined by the good that is worth the least among all the goods in the range. This value is determined at the margin, the marginal utility of the last unit of the least valuable good produced by the factor. In connection with his opportunity cost, the value so derived represents an opportunity cost across all industries, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>values</b> of the factors of production and goods are determined in the whole system. Thus, supply and demand do not develop into the determinants of value; the determinant of value is the marginal utility.|$|E
25|$|The {{essence of}} {{asymptotic}} safety is {{the observation that}} nontrivial renormalization group fixed points {{can be used to}} generalize the procedure of perturbative renormalization. In an asymptotically safe theory the couplings {{do not need to be}} small or tend to zero in the high energy limit but rather tend to finite values: they approach a nontrivial UV fixed point. The running of the coupling constants, i.e. their scale dependence described by the renormalization group (RG), is thus special in its UV limit in the sense that all their dimensionless combinations remain finite. This suffices to avoid unphysical divergences, e.g. in scattering amplitudes. The requirement of a UV fixed point restricts the form of the bare action <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>values</b> of the bare coupling constants, which become predictions of the asymptotic safety program rather than inputs.|$|E

25|$|Chern–Simons {{theory is}} a gauge theory, {{which means that}} a {{classical}} configuration in the Chern–Simons theory on M with gauge group G is described by a principal G-bundle on M. The connection of this bundle {{is characterized by a}} connection one-form A which is valued in the Lie algebra g of the Lie group G. In general the connection A is only defined on individual coordinate patches, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>values</b> of A on different patches are related by maps known as gauge transformations. These are characterized by the assertion that the covariant derivative, which is the sum of the exterior derivative operator d and the connection A, transforms in the adjoint representation of the gauge group G. The square of the covariant derivative with itself can be interpreted as a g-valued 2-form F called the curvature form or field strength. It also transforms in the adjoint representation.|$|E
