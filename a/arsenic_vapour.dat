40|$|The {{investigation}} {{object is}} the elementary arsenic in the cleaning processes. The {{aim is to}} study physical-chemical bases for cleaning of the arsenic in the elementary form and to investigate the constitution diagram of As-Se and As-Te. The pressure of the <b>arsenic</b> <b>vapour</b> in the wide temperature range has been measured firstly. The constitution diagrams of liquid - vapour in the arsenic - selenium system and crystal - liquid - vapour in the arsenic - tellurium system have been constructed. The distribution coefficient values of the selenium and tellurium additions have been determined firstly and experimentally for development and production process of the high-pure arsenic. The results can be used at the Institute of General and Non-Organic Chemistry of High-Pure Substances (Russian Academy of Sciences) and State Research and Design Institute of Rare-Metallic Industry "Giredmet"Available from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|A {{technique}} {{has been developed}} for growing large, strain-free, single crystals of the rhombohedral (ɑ) semimetallic form of <b>arsenic</b> from <b>vapour</b> phase. Previously, only small crystals have been obtained: large crystals can only be grown when the deposition temperature is above a critical value of 700 ºc. Temperature fluctuations must be kept within 0. 2 ºC to prevent the development of severe mosaic structure. Dislocations have been examined by etching techniques. Due to the 'puckered layer' structure of arsenic, either trigonal or hexagonal pits may be produced at the same site of emergence of dislocations on the (lll) cleavage plane: the etch determines the pit shape. Galvanomagnetic effects in arsenic have been studied for the low-field condition µH<< 1 by systematically measuring the twelve coefficients that define the isothermal magnetoresistivity tensor to second order in magnetic field, at selected temperatures between 77 ºK and 305 ºK. Because the effects are small, their measurement requires certain experimental refinements: the measuring system has a resolution of 10 (^- 9) v: electronic systems {{have been designed to}} stabilize. a sample current of 5 amps, to 1 in 10 ^ and the sample temperature to 0. 001 K. A two carrier, multivalley ellipsoidal model of the energy bands of arsenic is invoked to interpret the galvanomagnetic measurements and so determine carrier densities and mobilities and tilt angles of the Fermi ellipsoids. To solve the consequent twelve equations in nine unknowns, a new method of computation, incorporating a least-mean-squares criterion, has been devised. The electrons are sited in pockets tilted at + 82 to the trigonal axis and holes in pockets tilted at + 40 º; equal carrier densities are essentially temperature independent, ranging from 1. 9 x 10 (^ 20) cm. (^- 3) at 77 ºK to 2. 1 x 10 (^ 20) cm. (^- 3) at 305 ºK. These findings are in close agreement to recent theoretical calculations and measurements of the de Haas-van Alphen effect. Carrier mobility~ 1 7 temperature dependences are close to T(^- 1. 7), considerably greater than the expected T(^- 1. 0) probably owing to intervalley scattering. A measurement of the two components of the thermoelectric-power tensor has shown that S(_ 33) is negative, not positive, as reported previously...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of dimeric (As 2) vs tetrameric (As 4) <b>arsenic</b> <b>vapour</b> {{species on the}} electrical and optical properties of undoped and of Ge-doped GaAs grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) has been studied by using Hall effect, photoluminescence (PL) and DLTS measurements. The arsenic molecular beam was obtained from separate As 2 and As 4 sources, resp., and from a single source providing adjustable As 4 /As 2 flux ratios. The occurrence of the defect related bound exciton lines in the 2 K PL spectra {{was found to be}} directly correlated with-the existence of three deep states (M 1, M 3, M 4) which are characteristic of MBE grown GaAs. The intensity of these extra PL lines and simultaneously the electron trap concentration could be reduced substantially by decreasing the As 4, vs As 2 flux ratio. In addition, a considerably lower autocompensation ratio in Ge-doped n-GaAs was achieved with As 2 molecular beam species which provide a much higher steady-state arsenic surface population. These results demonstrate that the incorporation of defect related centers as well as of amphoteric dopants strongly depends on the surface chemistry involved in the film growth process...|$|E
40|$|The {{form and}} {{location}} of gold {{in the structure of}} arsenopyrite and pyrite minerals, and the mechanisms for the mobility agglomeration of gold in arsenopyrite during thermal treatment, have been studied using a combination of Rietveld X-ray diffraction refinement, Convergent Beam Electron Diffraction (CBED) and Atomic Location by Channelling Enhanced Microanalysis. The basic structure of all the arsenopyrite compositions studies, {{has been shown to be}} monoclinic P 2 (subscript) 1 /c, regardless of the variation in stoichiometry. An increase in the arsenic to sulfur ratio in the natural arsenopyrites was found to be associated with an increase in unit cell dimensions accompanied by expansions within the iron-centred octahedra along the [101] direction of the monoclinic cell and concommitant contractions of the octahedra in the (101) plane. There was no obvious relationship between variation in stoichiometry and structure of arsenopyrite which could provide information as to possible substitution of gold in its structure. However, atomic displacements caused by twinning or disorder, may help to incorporate gold. The synthesis of auriferous arsenopyrites showed that gold has to be in an ionic form to be taken up in the structure. The form of the gold species affects the distribution of gold in the structure, being chemically zoned when derived from a dichloro complex and more evenly distributed when derived from a hydrosulfido complex. It is suggested that rapid crystallisation, with resultant displacement faults along the b-axis, may contribute to higher concentrations of gold in the natural arsenopyrite structure. Electron probe microanalysis showed a possible slight iron-deficiency in some of the auriferous arsenopyrite grains analysed. However, the errors in the analyses were too high to provide conclusive evidence of gold substitution in the iron sites, as has been ++proposed in the literature. Analyses of natural and synthetic pyrites showed no deviations in structural parameters which could indicate possible substitution of gold or other impurities within the structure. Electron channelling experiments showed that gold was located on the sulfur sites in pyrite. In arsenopyrite, there was some evidence for gold located on the iron sites, however, most gold was interstitial, probably situated between the octahedra. This location is probably facilitated by the presence of the displacement faults as observed by CBED in the synthetic auriferous arsenopyrite. Breakdown of arsenopyrite under thermal treatment was topotactic along its b-axis, which converts to the a-axis in the pyrrhotite structure, following a reconstruction mechanism based on the preferential removal of arsenic over sulfur. Gold was visually recorded exsolving from the arsenopyrite structure and agglomerating as liquid metal globules as the arsenopyrite was chemically altered during thermal treatment under the Transmission Electron Microscopy electron beam. Gold became mobile on the decomposition of arsenopyrite, but this was not observed until a temperature of approximately 470 degrees celsius was reached. Above the temperature both solid solution and particulate gold became mobile. The interaction of <b>arsenic</b> <b>vapour</b> and gold reduced the melting point of gold. The observations on the effects of arsenic residence time, and the relative mobility of solid solution and particulate gold during the thermal decomposition of auriferous arsenopyrite and pyrite, have significant implications for improved industrial extraction of gold from these minerals...|$|E
