Phenolic acids have also been shown tocated as important components {{in a variety of}} soil processes. To regulate the residue decomposition rate (Meentemeyerevaluate the role of plant PAs in soil processes, a quantitative alkaline extraction, solid-phase purification, and gas chromatographic protocol 1978; Berendse et al., 1987; Martens, 2000 a), nutrient was developed for identification of the composition and concentration release from plant residues in soil (Tian et al., 1992) and of plant and soil PAs. Water-soluble or EDTA-exchangeable PAs increase long-term soil structure (Griffiths and Burns, were not detected in soil.
