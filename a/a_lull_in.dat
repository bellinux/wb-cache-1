5|$|Although {{there were}} minor exchanges {{of fire and}} some patrol activity, there was <b>a</b> <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> the battle on 14March in the {{northern}} sector. The following day, three Japanese infantry battalions fell on the US positions before dawn. They made some progress around Cox's Creek, but US forces counterattacked with air support, bazookas and flamethrowers, retaking part of the line. A platoon of M4 Sherman tanks arrived during the afternoon, and at around 3:00pm they attacked the Japanese with supporting artillery fire and regained more of the perimeter. From there, the battle followed a similar pattern, with <b>a</b> <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> the fighting on 16March, followed by a renewed effort by the Japanese the next day, with several US positions being overrun.|$|E

During <b>a</b> <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> filming caused by inclement weather, Irwin decided to snorkel in shallow waters while being filmed in an effort to provide footage for his daughter's television programme.|$|E
5|$|French and Wabanaki Confederacy raiding {{activity}} {{continued in}} northern Massachusetts in 1705, {{against which the}} English colonists were unable to mount an effective defense. The raids happened too quickly for defensive forces to organize, and reprisal raids usually found tribal camps and settlements empty. There was <b>a</b> <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> the raiding while the French and English leaders negotiated the exchange of prisoners, with only limited success. Raids by Indians persisted {{until the end of}} the war, sometimes with French participation.|$|E

5|$|There was <b>a</b> <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> {{fighting}} over the winter of 1812–13 while both the Russians and the French rebuilt their forces; Napoleon was able to field 350,000 troops. Heartened by France's loss in Russia, Prussia joined with Austria, Sweden, Russia, Great Britain, Spain, and Portugal in a new coalition. Napoleon assumed command in Germany and inflicted a series of defeats on the Coalition culminating in the Battle of Dresden in August 1813.|$|E
5|$|After this {{there was}} <b>a</b> <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> {{fighting}} in the Zadar area {{until the end of}} the month, with only sporadic small-arms fire and minor skirmishes. During that period, the JNA's efforts were concentrated on the Battle of Šibenik and an advance towards Sinj. Although the ZNG defended Šibenik and Sinj it lost Drniš, abandoning it before the JNA's arrival on 23 September. During the last week of September the JNA returned its focus to Zadar, stepping up its artillery bombardment of the city and ending its naval blockade on 23 September. On 29 September the JNA edged towards Zadar, capturing the villages of Bulić, Lišane Ostrovičke and Vukšić and announcing its intention to evacuate its Zadar barracks (which was affected by desertions).|$|E
5|$|At 21:50 the British {{artillery}} opened fire, and the Germans {{responded with}} their own artillery and mortars which forced most of the British to take cover, for the next fifteen minutes, until <b>a</b> <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> the German fire allowed them to continue. In the lead 'C' Company had crossed the start line at 22:00, however all its officers and the company sergeant major (CSM) became casualties and a senior non-commissioned officer took command of the company. They continued to advance through the artillery and mortar bombardment, guided towards their objective by tracer rounds from the Hussars tanks. Repeatedly hit by the artillery and tanks, Bréville was in flames {{by the time the}} company's fifteen survivors reached the village.|$|E

5|$|Back at the front, Potemkin {{won more}} {{military}} acclaim, but then fell ill; rejecting medicine, he recovered only slowly. After <b>a</b> <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> hostilities in 1772 his movements are unclear, {{but it seems}} that he returned to St. Petersburg where he is recorded, perhaps apocryphally, to have been one of Catherine's closest advisers. Though Orlov was replaced as her favourite, it was not Potemkin who benefited. Alexander Vasilchikov, another Horse-Guardsman, replaced Orlov as the queen's lover. Potemkin returned to war in 1773 as Lieutenant-General to fight in Silistria. It appears that Catherine missed him, and that Potemkin took a December letter from her as a summons. In any case Potemkin returned to St. Petersburg as a war hero.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} 198284 Suresh Srivastava, a GSI {{geologist}} at the Palaeontology Division of the GSI's Western Region, collected {{large numbers of}} bone fossil fragments from Rahioli, and also precisely mapped the area. These fossils {{were taken to the}} Palaeontology Division at Jaipur for identification. U. B. Mathur and Suresh Srivastava, under the supervision of S. C. Pant, meticulously cleaned many of the skeletal parts (braincase, dorsal and caudal vertebrae, sacrum, thigh bone, upper arm, shin bones, and others), leading to the publication of multiple research papers. There was <b>a</b> <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> further activity until a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed with Punjab University in 199495.|$|E
5|$|Estate house design {{declined}} in {{importance in the}} twentieth century. An exception was the work undertaken by John Kinross (1855–1955). Beginning with the reconstruction of Thurston House, Dunbar, from 1890, he undertook a series of major country house designs. The most important was Manderston House (1901–03), built for James Miller in the Adam style. Skibo Castle was rebuilt for industrialist Andrew Carnegie (1899–1903) by Ross and Macbeth. English architect C. H. B. Quennell designed a neo-Georgian mansion at Altmore (1912–14) for {{the owner of a}} Moscow department store. There was <b>a</b> <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> building after the First World War and social change undermined the construction of rural country houses.|$|E

5|$|In Pennsylvania, Governor Ed Rendell {{declared}} a disaster emergency {{across the entire}} state on the 15th. PPL Electric Utilities Corporation reported 1,542 customers were without power for a time during the storm in the Lancaster, Harrisburg and Allentown areas. Snow began across between 6 AM and 7 AM EST on the 13th in Philadelphia, Delaware, Chester, Montgomery and Berks counties. The snow then overspread Bucks, Northampton, Lehigh, Carbon, Berks, and most of Schuylkill counties between 8 AM and 10 AM EST, but held off in Monroe County until the early afternoon hours. There was <b>a</b> <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> the precipitation during the evening hours of the 13th especially across southeastern Pennsylvania, however the precipitation became widespread overnight and during {{the early morning hours}} of the 14th.|$|E
5|$|The initial Abbasid {{invasion}} {{was led by}} Ishaq ibn Kundaj, {{appointed as}} the nominal governor of Syria and Egypt, and another general, Muhammad ibn Diwdad Abu'l-Saj. After receiving encouragement from al-Muwaffaq, who promised to send them reinforcements, the two commanders marched into Syria in mid-884. The Tulunid governor of Damascus soon defected to their side, {{and they were able}} to take control of Antioch, Hims and Aleppo. Upon learning of the Abbasid advance, Khumarawayh sent troops to Syria. The Tulunid army first proceeded to Damascus, where they succeeded in forcing its rebel governor to flee, and then advanced to Shayzar on the Orontes. The onset of winter, however, resulted in <b>a</b> <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> hostilities, and both sides remained in their camps to wait out the season.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Typhoon Angela trace {{back to a}} {{tropical}} disturbance in the monsoon trough that became very active after <b>a</b> <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> convection. The disturbance developed over the western Caroline Islands, and persisted for two days until it was noted in a Significant Tropical Weather Advisory issued by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). It rapidly matured, and prompted a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert shortly thereafter. Enhanced upper-level outflow assisted the storm's intensification. At 0600 UTC on September 28, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) recognized the storm as a tropical depression. The JTWC issued their first advisory on the depression, designated 34W, at 0600 UTC on September 29. However, at the same time, the JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm.|$|E

5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the plague caused <b>a</b> <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> the fighting during the year 543. The following year Khosrau defeated a Byzantine army of 30,000 men, but unsuccessfully besieged the major city of Edessa. Both parties made little headway, and in 545 a truce was agreed upon for {{the southern part of}} the Roman-Persian frontier. After that the Lazic War in the North continued for several years, until a second truce in 557, followed by a Fifty Years' Peace in 562. Under its terms, the Persians agreed to abandon Lazica in exchange for an annual tribute of 400 or 500 pounds of gold (30,000 solidi) to be paid by the Romans.|$|E
5|$|The {{version of}} events {{recorded}} by history {{is based on the}} accounts of Burnham, Ingram and Gooding, the Matabele present at the battle (particularly inDuna Mjaan), and the men of Forbes's column. Burnham, Ingram and Gooding's stories closely corroborate each other; their {{version of events}} was accepted as true by the Court of Inquiry at Bulawayo in December 1893. First-hand Matabele accounts such as Mjaan's, which were first recorded during 1894, appear to confirm the character of the break-out, saying that three of the white men they were fighting—including Burnham, whom several of them recognised—left during <b>a</b> <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> the battle, just after Wilson withdrew to his final position.|$|E
5|$|Amidst much {{pomp and}} ceremony, with Justinian and the Patriarch of Constantinople in attendance, the Roman fleet set sail around 21 June 533. The initial {{progress}} was slow, as the fleet spent five days at Heraclea Perinthus waiting for horses and further four days at Abydus {{due to lack}} of wind. The fleet left the Dardanelles on 1 July, and crossed the Aegean Sea to the port of Methone, where it was joined by the last contingents of troops. Belisarius took advantage of an enforced stay there due to <b>a</b> <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> the wind to train his troops and acquaint the disparate contingents with each other. It was at Methone, however, that 500 men died of dysentery caused by mouldy bread. According to Procopius, the responsibility fell on John the Cappadocian, who had cut costs by baking it only once, with the result that the bread went bad. Justinian was informed, but John {{does not appear to have}} been punished. Belisarius took steps to remedy the situation, and the army soon recovered.|$|E
50|$|The {{start of}} 2004 {{was marked by}} <b>a</b> {{relative}} <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> violence. Guerrilla attacks lessened in intensity while insurgent forces reorganized, studying the multinational forces' tactics and planning a renewed offensive.|$|R

5|$|Following the German {{destroyer}} attack, the High Seas Fleet disengaged, and Collingwood and {{the rest}} of the Grand Fleet saw no further action in the battle. This was, in part, due to confusion aboard the fleet flagship over the exact location and course of the German fleet; without this information, Jellicoe could not bring his fleet to action. At 21:30, the Grand Fleet began to reorganise into its night-time cruising formation. Early on the morning of 1 June, the Grand Fleet combed the area, looking for damaged German ships, but after spending several hours searching, they found none. Collingwood fired a total of 52 armour-piercing, capped and 32 HE shells from her main armament and 35 four-inch shells during the battle. Prince Albert was a sub-lieutenant commanding the forward turret during the battle and sat in the open on the turret roof during <b>a</b> <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> the action.|$|E
5|$|In September 1940, 237 Squadron was {{relieved}} by {{units of the}} South Arican Air Force and redeployed in Sudan, where the Operations Record {{for the last three}} months of 1940 showed it was involved in reconnaissance, dive-bombing and pamphlet-dropping. At the start of 1941, the Squadron was re-equipped with less antiquated aircraft. The Hardys were replaced by Westland Lysander II army co-operation planes as well as Gloster Gladiator fighter biplanes. 237 Squadron moved out of East Africa after the defeat of the Italians in May 1941. They had seen active service in Kenya, Sudan, Eritrea and Abyssinia. The Squadron was involved in the Western Desert Campaign against Rommel. After <b>a</b> <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> the summer of 1941, it took heavy casualties in the closing months inflicted on it by Me109F and Macchis. It was withdrawn to the Canal Zone in February 1942 after five months in the Western Desert.|$|E
5|$|The {{increases}} of the 1630s corresponded with <b>a</b> <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> the Thirty Years' War. In 1634/5 the German and Swedish armies lost {{ground in the}} South of Germany; then Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria moved north. After the Peace of Prague (1635) the French (and the Dutch) decided to support the Swedish and German protestants with money and arms against the Habsburg empire, and to occupy the Spanish Netherlands in 1636. Hence market prices (at least initially) were responding rationally to a rise in demand. However, the fall in prices was faster and more dramatic than the rise. Data on sales largely disappeared after the February 1637 collapse in prices, but a few other data points on bulb prices after tulip mania show that bulbs continued to lose value for decades thereafter.|$|E
