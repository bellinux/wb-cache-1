Reference {{values for the}} dynein arms <b>and</b> <b>spokes</b> were calculated based on biopsies from non-PCD patients as well as after ciliogenesis in culture. The mean values in the biopsies (n = 251) were 8. 4 +/- 0. 5, 2. 9 +/- 0. 7 and 4. 7 +/- 1. 0 for the outer dynein arms, inner dynein arms <b>and</b> <b>spokes</b> respectively. After ciliogenesis in culture (n = 462) identical values were found: 8. 7 +/- 0. 4, 3. 0 +/- 0. 4 and 5. 5 +/- 0. 6. The lower limits of normality can be set at 7. 0 and 1. 2 for the outer and inner dynein arms respectively. The dynein arms <b>and</b> <b>spokes</b> were not influenced by the percentage of secondary abnormalities. In conclusion, dynein arms <b>and</b> <b>spokes</b> are readily identified after ciliogenesis in culture. These parameters are independent of secondary ciliary dyskinesia. status: publishe...|$|R
