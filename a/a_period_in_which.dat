5|$|Christianity {{arose in}} Cappadocia {{relatively}} late with {{no evidence of}} a Christian community before the late second century AD. Alexander of Jerusalem was the first bishop of the province in the early to mid third century, <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Christians suffered persecution from the local Roman authorities. The community remained very small throughout the third century: when Gregory Thaumaturgus acceded to the bishopric in c. 250, according to his namesake, the Nyssen, there were only seventeen members of the Church in Caesarea.|$|E

5|$|Construction of the B Station began {{shortly after}} the A station was completed. The {{stations}} were built during <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> there were great advances in power station technology, and in the scale of production, which led to them having a variety of intermediate generator set sizes along {{with a mix of}} design styles. Blyth A had a generating capacity of 480megawatts (MW) and the B Station 1,250MW. Their combined capacity of 1,730MW briefly made Blyth Power Station the largest electricity generation site in England, until Ferrybridge C Power Station came into full operation in 1966. The stations were capable of generating enough electricity to power 300,000homes.|$|E
5|$|English has {{developed}} {{over the course of}} more than 1,400 years. The earliest forms of English, a set of Anglo-Frisian dialects brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the 5th century, are called Old English. Middle English began in the late 11th century with the Norman conquest of England, and was <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the language was influenced by French. Early Modern English began in the late 15th century with the introduction of the printing press to London and the King James Bible, and the start of the Great Vowel Shift.|$|E
5|$|In 1981–82 {{they began}} <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> they were {{competitive}} in European competition. In a six-year spell they reached one UEFA final, another semi-final and two quarter finals. After their only Premier Division win in 1983, the team reached the resulting semi-final of the European Cup in 1984, losing 3–2 on aggregate to Roma. In 1987, the club went one better, reaching {{the final of}} the UEFA Cup. Despite the 2–1 aggregate loss to IFK Gothenburg, the club won the first-ever FIFA Fair Play Award for their supporters' sporting behavior after the final defeat.|$|E

5|$|In 2003 Ian Davis, {{the head}} of the London, UK office, was elected to the {{position}} of managing director. Davis promised a return to the company’s core values, after <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the firm had expanded rapidly, which some McKinsey consultants felt was a departure from the company's heritage. Also in 2003, the firm established a headquarters for the Asia-Pacific region in Shanghai, China. By 2004, more than 60 percent of McKinsey's revenues were generated outside the U.S. The company started a Social Sector Office (SSO) in 2008, which is divided into three practices: Global Public Health, Economic Development and Opportunity Creation (EDHOC) and Philanthropy. McKinsey does much of its pro-bono work through the SSO, whereas a Business Technology Office (BTO), founded in 1997, provides consulting on technology strategy.|$|E
5|$|Modern Vampires of the City is the 2013 third studio album by American indie {{rock band}} Vampire Weekend.

With no deadline in mind, the band brought in an outside record producer for the first time, Ariel Rechtshaid, to record the album.|$|E
5|$|Previous films by Hepworth and {{his company}} had been {{considered}} {{a continuation of the}} cinema of attractions. The first few years of the 20th century were <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> many film-makers began placing a higher emphasis on portraying a narrative story, and lesser so more on the image and the ability to show something. The film is considered a step forward in both film grammar and structure. Contemporary audiences may find it rather hoary, although one scholar has noted the format would be familiar to fans of the dog character Lassie.|$|E

5|$|Recorded {{over six}} weeks in late 2004, Commit This to Memory was created largely at Seedy Underbelly Studios, a {{suburban}} home converted into a studio in Los Angeles' Valley Village region. The album was written partially in their hometown of Minneapolis and partially in Los Angeles, during <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> frontman Justin Pierre was seeking treatment for alcohol abuse. He hoped for his lyricism to better emphasize storytelling, inspired by the lyrics of Tom Waits, Ben Folds and John K. Samson. Hoppus mainly worked with the band on completing song arrangements.|$|E
5|$|The Bulls {{qualified}} for the playoffs just twice between 1976 and 1984, <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the team used eight different head coaches, including former player Jerry Sloan. They {{had a chance to}} win the first pick of the 1979 NBA Draft, which would have allowed them to select future Hall of Famer Magic Johnson. However, they lost a coin flip to the Los Angeles Lakers, and went on to choose David Greenwood with the second pick. Although Greenwood averaged 12.6 points over six seasons with the Bulls, he never became an NBA All-Star.|$|E
5|$|The O'Brien Brewing and Malting Company, {{also known}} as the Klondike Brewery, was a brewery founded by Thomas O'Brien in Klondike City, an {{adjoining}} settlement to Dawson City, Yukon Territory, Canada from 1904 to 1919. It was established during <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Dawson City was expected to become an important regional city, and used modern techniques and equipment imported from California. It was initially successful, selling 68,748 gallons of beer in 1905, but Dawson's population declined and growing temperance attitudes threatened the business. O'Brien sold the company in 1915, and in 1919 prohibition forced its closure. The brewery was abandoned, and the remains of the site are now owned by the Tr'ondek Hwech'in First Nation.|$|E

5|$|The {{establishment}} of the Council in Ludlow Castle gave it a new lease of life, during <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> many similar fortifications were falling into decay. By the 1530s, the castle needed considerable renovation; Lee began work in 1534, borrowing money to do so, but Sir Thomas Engleford complained the following year that the castle was still unfit for habitation. Lee repaired the castle roofs, probably using lead from the Carmelite friary in the town, and using the fines imposed and the goods confiscated by the court. He later claimed that {{the work on the}} castle would have cost around £500, had the Crown had to pay for it all directly. The porter's lodge and prison were built in the outer bailey around 1552. The woods around the castle were gradually cut down during the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|Wessel soon {{impressed}} Goebbels, and in January 1928, <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the Berlin city {{authorities had}} banned the SA {{in an effort}} to curb political street violence, Wessel was sent to Vienna to study the National Socialist Youth Group, as well as the organisational and tactical methods of the Nazi Party there. He returned to Berlin in July 1928 to recruit local youths, and was involved in helping to implement a reorganisation of the NSDAP in the city into a cell-structure similar to that used by the German Communist Party (KPD). Wessel did this despite SA rules forbidding its members from working for the party.|$|E
5|$|After {{establishing}} {{itself around}} Ravenshoe, Queensland, {{the next three}} months was a period of flux for the battalion, with many men taking leave or being discharged due to tropical diseases or injuries from the previous campaign. The battalion was brought up to strength with a large draft of volunteers from the 11th Motor Regiment, a motorised Militia light horse unit consisting largely of Queenslanders and New South Welshmen. A period of rest and reorganisation followed during which the units of the 2nd AIF were converted to the Jungle Division establishment. After this, large scale divisional manoeuvres took place in mid-July, after which the battalion received orders to sail for overseas again. Embarking upon the transport Canberra from Townsville, they arrived in Port Moresby in early August. After <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the 18th Brigade was held back in reserve at Port Moresby to defend the approaches to Lae, in December 1943 the 2/10th was sent into the Finisterre Mountains, where they joined the rest of the 7th Division whose campaign through the Markham and Ramu Valleys had culminated in heavy fighting around Shaggy Ridge during the first months of 1944. This proved to be the most significant action for the 2/10th and in May 1944 they withdrawn to Australia, being transported home on the Duntroon.|$|E

5|$|In 1732, an Act of Parliament {{was passed}} which {{permitted}} {{the construction of}} a turnpike from Manchester, then in Lancashire, to Salters Brook in Cheshire. The road passed through Ashton-under-Lyne as well as Audenshaw, Mottram-in-Longdendale, and Stalybridge. A Turnpike Trust was responsible for collecting tolls from traffic; the proceeds were used for road maintenance. The Trust for Manchester to Salters Brook was one of over 400established between 1706 and 1750, <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> turnpikes became popular. It was the first turnpike to be opened in Tameside, and driven by economic growth, more turnpikes were opened in the area in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Acts of Parliaments were passed in 1765, 1793, and 1799 permitting the construction turnpikes from Ashton-under-Lyne to Doctor Lane Head in Saddleworth, Standedge in Saddleworth, and Oldham respectively. Towards the end of the 19th century, many Turnpike Trusts were wound up as they were superseded by local government; the last in Tameside to close was the Ashton-under-Lyne to Salters Brook road in 1884.|$|E
5|$|In the 1903 CAHL season, Ottawa and the Montreal Victorias both {{finished}} {{in first place}} with 6–2 records. The top scorers were the Victorias' Russell Bowie, who scored seven goals in one game and six in another, and McGee, whose top performance saw him score five goals in a game. The two clubs faced off in a two-game total goals series to decide the league championship and Stanley Cup. The first game, played in Montreal on slushy ice that made it a desperate struggle to score, ended 1–1. The return match in Ottawa, witnessed by three thousand fans, was on ice coated with an inch of water. The conditions did not hinder Ottawa, as they won 8–0, with McGee scoring three goals and the other five shared among the three Gilmour brothers, Dave (3), Suddy (1) and Bill (1), to win their first Cup. This started <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the team held the Stanley Cup and defeated all challengers until March 1906.|$|E
5|$|Osiris's {{death is}} {{followed}} either by an interregnum or by <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Set assumes the kingship. Meanwhile, Isis searches for her husband's {{body with the}} aid of Nephthys. When searching for or mourning Osiris, the two goddesses are often likened to falcons or kites, possibly because kites travel far in search of carrion, because the Egyptians associated their plaintive calls with cries of grief, or because of the goddesses' connection with Horus, who is often represented as a falcon. In the New Kingdom, when Osiris's death and renewal came {{to be associated with the}} annual flooding of the Nile that fertilized Egypt, the waters of the Nile were equated with Isis's tears of mourning, or with Osiris's bodily fluids. Osiris thus represented the life-giving divine power that was present in the river's water and in the plants that grew after the flood.|$|E
