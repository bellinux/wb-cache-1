5|$|Chris Carter was {{inspired}} to write this episode based on an interest in dendrochronology, <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> <b>that</b> involves analyzing annual growth rings found in non-tropical tree species. Carter credits the episode's ominous ending with his experience {{growing up in the}} era following the Watergate scandal, having spent his life coming to mistrust the government profoundly.|$|E
5|$|In later times, {{the term}} has {{continued}} {{to be used to}} describe conservative letter writers who complain to newspapers about <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> <b>that</b> they morally or personally disagree with. It is often used in relation to news stories regarding Royal Tunbridge Wells. Some residents of the town have criticised the term as being obsolete, but several continue to embrace it.|$|E
5|$|A major {{branch of}} {{numerical}} analysis {{is devoted to}} the development of efficient algorithms for matrix computations, <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> <b>that</b> is centuries old and is today an expanding area of research. Matrix decomposition methods simplify computations, both theoretically and practically. Algorithms that are tailored to particular matrix structures, such as sparse matrices and near-diagonal matrices, expedite computations in finite element method and other computations. Infinite matrices occur in planetary theory and in atomic theory. A simple example of an infinite matrix is the matrix representing the derivative operator, which acts on the Taylor series of a function.|$|E

5|$|About 1270, he {{returned}} to England to teach at Oxford, and was elected provincial minister of the Franciscans in England in 1275. He did not long remain in that post, being summoned to Rome as lector sacri palatii, or theological lecturer at the papal palace. It is likely that he composed his Expositio super Regulam Fratrum Minorum, a work that included information on preaching, <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> <b>that</b> Peckham felt was of great importance. In 1279 he was appointed Archbishop of Canterbury by Pope Nicholas III who had prohibited the election of Robert Burnell, Edward I's preferred candidate. He was provided (appointed by the pope to the see) on 25 January 1279 and consecrated on 19 February 1279.|$|E
5|$|After {{just over}} a year with Cheerleader, Rollason left the company to {{concentrate}} on her broadcasting career, and became a freelance reporter. She covered the 1987 World Student Games from Zagreb for Thames Television, and then presented the 1988 World Junior Athletics championships from Sudbury, Ontario for Channel 4. Later on in 1988, she provided coverage of that year's Summer Olympics, held in Seoul, for ITV. During the mid-1980s, she also joined the presenting team of the BBC children's news programme, Newsround, with a view to increasing its sports coverage, and presented several features on topics such as gymnastics and female jockeys, as well as presenting Newsround Extra, a show that covered a specific issue in more detail. One such programme was a report on the street children of Bogotá, <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> <b>that</b> deeply moved her and reduced her to tears on screen.|$|E
5|$|Géricault {{chose to}} depict this event {{in order to}} launch his career with a {{large-scale}} uncommissioned work on <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> <b>that</b> had already generated great public interest. The event fascinated him, and before he began work on the final painting, he undertook extensive research and produced many preparatory sketches. He interviewed two of the survivors and constructed a detailed scale model of the raft. He visited hospitals and morgues where he could view, first-hand, the colour and texture of {{the flesh of the}} dying and dead. As he had anticipated, the painting proved highly controversial at its first appearance in the 1819 Paris Salon, attracting passionate praise and condemnation in equal measure. However, it established his international reputation, and today is widely seen as seminal in the early history of the Romantic movement in French painting.|$|E

5|$|In early 1922 Marquis started {{considering}} {{working as}} an Indian agency physician. This would both satisfy his longstanding interest in the Native Americans of the West, and provide <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> <b>that</b> might {{be of interest to}} publishers. In May, Marquis applied to the Civil Service Commission. While waiting, he began work on a novel, Boute, an unfinished story based on his wartime experiences. In June, Marquis was appointed agency physician to the Northern Cheyenne. He arrived in the agency village of Lame Deer, Montana, in early July.|$|E
5|$|In 1680, Zotov {{embarked}} on a three-year diplomatic mission to the Crimea; sources disagree on whether this was before or after he tutored Peter. When Peter left the Kremlin to spend his childhood at Preobrazhenskoye, two years after Zotov's departure, his memories of the tutors who had taught his siblings, Feodor and Sophia, were so negative that he cut himself off from traditional academic subjects for a time. He later resumed his studies under Afanassyi Nesterov and Zotov after the latter's return from the Crimea. Although Peter sought to learn of nature and military matters rather than literature or theology, he nevertheless {{learned a great deal}} of the latter from his tutors. Zotov (and later his sons) later worked with Peter to translate books about fortification from a Western European language into Russian. Peter did not learn, or forgot, a great deal about mathematics, <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> <b>that</b> he had to learn properly in his late teens for use in siege warfare and fortification. In later years, Peter regretted his lack of a fuller education, and sought to give his daughters Anne and Elizabeth educations equivalent of any European princess.|$|E
5|$|Jabarona {{was filled}} with Dinka {{refugees}} who had fled the fighting {{in the south of}} Sudan and were forced to live together in sub-standard conditions. Bok settled among people who were from the Aweil area of North Bahr al Ghazal and began using his Christian name of Francis once again. Bok was quickly arrested by the Sudanese police for telling his friends and neighbors that he was a slave. Slavery in Sudan is <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> <b>that</b> was largely denied by the government in Khartoum and anybody that spoke of it could be arrested or even killed. Francis was interrogated numerous times while he was imprisoned and each time he denied that he was a slave. He was finally released from prison after seven months. Once he was released Bok decided that he must leave Sudan. Through the help of some Dinka tribesman he was able to acquire a Sudanese passport on the black market and obtain a ticket for passage to Cairo.|$|E

30|$|Four {{different}} structures can {{be identified}} for the V-DE construction (see 83). The de-part in most V-DE constructions can be analyzed as being a clause with or without <b>an</b> overt <b>subject.</b> <b>That</b> is, the de-part in most cases are [+Predicative]. Moreover, on my analysis sentences like Huang et al.’s example in 72 do not involve a Pro or null subject. In fact, the de-part in such sentences has <b>an</b> overt <b>subject</b> <b>that</b> can also be semantically interpreted as the Patient argument of the verb before -de.|$|R

La Forest began by considering which head of power had authority over the [...] "environment". He concluded that [...] "environment" [...] was not <b>a</b> distinct <b>subject</b> matter <b>that</b> could be allocated to either the province or the federal government, rather, it is <b>a</b> diffuse <b>subject</b> <b>that</b> can be divided among the two governments.|$|R
25|$|Which title {{should be}} used is <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> <b>that</b> has {{generated}} controversy amongst fans of the series. Fan researchers such as David J. Howe argue that since 100,000 BC {{was used by the}} production team at the time of transmission, it is the most accurate title. However, the BBC markets the story as An Unearthly Child. Consequently, this became the most common title used for the story.|$|E
25|$|Another {{link between}} Latin communis sensus and Aristotle's Greek was in rhetoric, <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> <b>that</b> Aristotle {{was the first}} to systematize. In rhetoric, a prudent speaker must take account of {{opinions}} (Greek doxai) that are widely held. Aristotle referred to such commonly held beliefs not as koinai doxai, which is a term he used for self-evident logical axioms, but with other terms such as endoxa.|$|E
25|$|Representation {{theory is}} a useful method because it reduces {{problems}} in abstract algebra to problems in linear algebra, <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> <b>that</b> is well understood. Furthermore, the vector space on which a group (for example) is represented can be infinite-dimensional, and by allowing it to be, for instance, a Hilbert space, methods of analysis {{can be applied to}} the theory of groups. Representation theory is also important in physics because, for example, it describes how the symmetry group of a physical system affects the solutions of equations describing that system.|$|E

25|$|The {{current state}} of {{dissection}} in India is deteriorating. The number of hours spent in dissection labs during medical school have decreased substantially over the last twenty years. The future of anatomy education will probably be an elegant mix of traditional methods and integrative computer learning. The use of dissection in early stages of medical training has been shown more effective in the retention of the intended information than their simulated counterparts. However, there is use for the computer generated experience as review in the later stages. The combination of these methods are intended to strength the students understanding and confidence of anatomy, <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> <b>that</b> is infamously difficult to master. There is a growing need for anatomist—seeing as most anatomy labs are taught by graduates hoping to complete degrees in anatomy—to continue the long tradition of anatomy education.|$|E
25|$|In August 1865 Royer {{returned}} from Lausanne {{to live in}} Paris while Duprat, proscribed by the Second Empire, joined her and secretly shared her apartment. Three months later in December they went to live together openly in Florence (then the capital of Italy) where her only son, René, was born on 12 March 1866. With a small child to care for {{she could no longer}} easily travel but she continued to write, contributing to various journals and publishing a series of three articles on Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. She also worked on a book on the evolution of human society, L’origine de l’homme et des sociétés, published in 1870.
