[...] Areas covered in the regulations include the requirement for <b>lifting</b> <b>equipment</b> to be strong and stable enough for safe use and to be marked to indicate safe working loads; ensuring that any equipment is positioned and installed so as to minimise risks; that the equipment is used safely ensuring that work is planned, organised and performed by a competent person; that equipment is subject to ongoing thorough examination and where appropriate, inspection by competent people.|$|R
40|$|Investigations of {{hydraulic}} {{operating conditions}} of <b>air</b> <b>lift</b> pump with {{three types of}} air-water mixers. The paper presents the analysis of results of the investigations concerning the influence of various constructive solutions of the air-water mixers on hydraulic operating conditions of the <b>air</b> <b>lift</b> pump. The scope of the investigations encompassed the determination of characteristics of delivery head and delivery rate for three types of air-water mixers applied in the constructed <b>air</b> <b>lift</b> pump. Using the obtained results, {{the efficiency of the}} three types of air-water mixers applied in this <b>air</b> <b>lift</b> pump was determined. The analysis was carried out and there was checked whether the improved analytical Stenning-Martin model can be used to design <b>air</b> <b>lift</b> pumps with the air-water mixers of these types. The highest capacity in the water transport was reached by the <b>air</b> <b>lift</b> pump with the 1 st type air-water mixer, the lowest one – with the 3 rd type air-water mixer. The water flow in the <b>air</b> <b>lift</b> pump increases along with the rise in the air flow. The lower are the hydraulic losses generated during flow of the air flux by the air-water mixer, the higher is the <b>air</b> <b>lift</b> pump capacity. Along with the rise in the water delivery head, the capacity of the <b>air</b> <b>lift</b> pump decreases. The highest efficiency is reached by the <b>air</b> <b>lift</b> pump with the 1 st type air-water mixer, the lowest – with the 3 st type air-water mixer. The efficiency of the <b>air</b> <b>lift</b> pump for the three investigated types of air-water mixers decreases along with the rise in air flow rate and water delivery head. The values of submergence ratio (h/L) of the delivery pipe, calculated {{with the use of the}} improved analytical Stenning-Martin model, coincide quite well with the values of h/L determined from the measurements...|$|R

40|$|Sustainable {{development}} {{is an integral}} concept for achieving quality of limits, interdependence, fundamentals and equity. Virtual reality means existing or resulting in essence or effect though not in actual fact, form, or name. Machine design is always interesting for most people, it is also {{becoming more and more}} popular now a days. Showing the performance of a machine design during the design phase is possible to do using 3 D Max and ANSYS software. Car <b>lifting</b> <b>equipment</b> is a device to lift a car for several workshop purposes as replace oil, fix car&# 65533;s break, overhaul engine, periodical maintenance and many others. Conventional car <b>lifting</b> <b>equipment</b> design needs a lot of cost, time, and materials because it needs doing the real test to understand the performance of the car <b>lifting</b> <b>equipment</b> design. The primary target of this research is to search and decide which mechanism is the most suitable for this machine and also the virtual reality to show its performance during the design phase. In this research, sustainable product development using virtual reality with 3 D Max and ANSYS software is used rather than conventional design. The goal of this research is to show the performance of the machine during the design phase using 3 D Max and ANSYS software. Finally, car <b>lifting</b> <b>equipment</b> has been designed in this research using 3 D Max and ANSYS software as a solution of sustainable product development. Designing car <b>lifting</b> <b>equipment</b> using 3 D Max and ANSYS virtual reality software can reduce materials, cost and time of product development.

Muscle use was measured during all forms of exercise and exercise using conventional weight <b>lifting</b> <b>equipment</b> was compared to exercise during Pilates with and without a resistive device called the “Zone Pilates Sculpter ” (Savvier LP, Santa Fe Springs, Calif). The ability of the Pilates device to restrict movement in adverse directions and thereby, reduce potential injuries during exercise was also assessed. The results of the experiments showed that Pilates, while good for endurance training, resulted in only minimal muscle activity in core muscles (abdominal and paraspinal muscles) compared to exercise on commercial weight <b>lifting</b> <b>equipment.</b> However, the addition of the resistive device to Pilates exercise, increased the workload substantially, such that exercise during Pilates was equivalent to a medium intensity workout on commercial weight <b>lifting</b> <b>equipment.</b> However, unlike commercial exercise equipment, Pilates and the resistive device exercised multiple muscle groups simultaneously and thereby provided a more efficient workout than commercial weight <b>lifting</b> <b>equipment.</b> The resistive device also restricted adverse movement at the joints during exercise making exercise smoother and safer...|$|R
