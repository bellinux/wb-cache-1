5|$|The game {{begins in}} the Arizona Territory in 1876 with Jericho {{attempting}} to rob a Darkwatch train that is transporting the captured Lazarus Malkoth to the Darkwatch Citadel, a frequently mentioned and often visited location in the game. His actions inadvertently release Lazarus into the West. In a seeming bit of mercy, Lazarus bites Jericho and gives him {{the curse of the}} vampire, causing him to slowly turn into one. The game continues with the introduction of Darkwatch agent Cassidy Sharp as well as the appearance of Shadow, Jericho's undead horse whom he fed on and turned in <b>a</b> <b>frenzy</b> after being bitten by Lazarus.|$|E
5|$|After {{only six}} games in Milwaukee, McGrattan was traded {{back to the}} Flames, in {{exchange}} for Joe Piskula, on February 28, 2013. McGrattan's positive influence {{in the locker room}} as a player always prepared to play was cited as a reason why Calgary re-acquired him. The Flames also expected he would add a physical presence to the team, which he did in his re-debut with the Flames, a 4–2 victory over Vancouver that included several hits and a fight with Tom Sestito – his first NHL fight in over a year. He gave the crowd a salute following the fight, sending the fans into <b>a</b> <b>frenzy</b> and earning a ten-minute misconduct. He finished the season with three goals and 49 PIM in 19 games with the Flames, and earned a two-year contract extension from the team.|$|E
5|$|As the two champions {{appeared}} {{they were}} greeted by <b>a</b> <b>frenzy</b> of excitement and everyone was on their feet to acclaim the two heroes. It was difficult to recognise them. Garin was first, followed by the mud-soaked figure of Cordang. Suddenly, to the stupefaction of everyone, Cordang slipped and fell on the velodrome's cement surface. Garin could not believe his luck. By the time Cordang was back on his bike, he had lost 100 metres. There remained six laps to cover. Two miserable kilometres in which to catch Garin. The crowd held its breath as they watched the incredible pursuit match. The bell rang out. One lap, there remained one lap. 333 metres for Garin, who had a lead of 30 metres on the Batave.|$|E

5|$|Celtic {{began the}} 2013–14 season with further Champions League success in their sights. Celtic were drawn with Cliftonville {{in their first}} {{qualifying}} round and easily disposed of the Northern Irish champions 50 on aggregate. They were next drawn with IF Elfsborg and squeezed by with a 10 aggregate win, with Kris Commons scoring the only goal in the first leg at Celtic Park. Although favoured {{to qualify for the}} group stages with minimal challenge after being drawn with Kazakh champions Shakhter Karagandy, Celtic found themselves losing the first leg in Karagandy 20. Celtic returned to Scotland to an electric atmosphere at Celtic Park in the home leg, in what proved to be the high point of their 2013–14 Champions League campaign. They overcame the 20 deficit to level the aggregate thanks to goals by Kris Commons and Georgios Samaras. James Forrest completed the comeback for Celtic with a 90th-minute strike, sending Celtic Park into <b>a</b> <b>frenzy.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the 18th century, {{there was}} <b>a</b> <b>frenzy</b> of vampire {{sightings}} in Eastern Europe, with frequent stakings and grave diggings {{to identify and}} kill the potential revenants. Even government officials engaged in the hunting and staking of vampires. Despite being called the Age of Enlightenment, during which most folkloric legends were quelled, the belief in vampires increased dramatically, resulting in a mass hysteria throughout most of Europe. The panic began with an outbreak of alleged vampire attacks in East Prussia in 1721 and in the Habsburg Monarchy from 1725 to 1734, which spread to other localities. Two famous vampire cases, {{the first to be}} officially recorded, involved the corpses of Petar Blagojevich and Miloš Čečar from Serbia. Blagojevich was reported to have {{died at the age of}} 62, but allegedly returned after his death asking his son for food. When the son refused, he was found dead the following day. Blagojevich supposedly returned and attacked some neighbours who died from loss of blood.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the castle}} of the Grail, Amfortas is {{brought before the}} Grail shrine and Titurel's coffin. He cries out, asking his dead father to grant him rest from his sufferings and expresses the desire {{to join him in}} death (""). The Knights of the Grail passionately urge Amfortas to uncover the Grail again but Amfortas, in <b>a</b> <b>frenzy,</b> says he will never again show the Grail. He {{commands}} the Knights, instead, to kill him and end his suffering and the shame he has brought on the Knighthood. At this moment, Parsifal steps forth and says that only one weapon can heal the wound (""). He touches Amfortas' side with the Spear and both heals and absolves him. Parsifal commands the unveiling of the Grail. As all present kneel, Kundry, released from her curse, sinks lifeless to the ground as a white dove descends and hovers above Parsifal.|$|E

5|$|During {{this time}} in the 18th century, there was <b>a</b> <b>frenzy</b> of vampire {{sightings}} in Transylvania, with frequent stakings and grave diggings taking place to identify and kill the potential revenants; even government officials were compelled into the hunting and staking of vampires. Despite being called the Age of Enlightenment, during which most folkloric legends were quelled, the belief in vampires increased dramatically, resulting in what could only be called a mass hysteria throughout most of Europe. The panic began with an outbreak of alleged vampire attacks in East Prussia in 1721 and in the Habsburg Monarchy from 1725 to 1734, which spread to other localities.

Blagojevich was reported to have {{died at the age of}} 62, but allegedly returned after his death asking his son for food. When the son refused, he was found dead the following day. Blagojevich soon supposedly returned and attacked some neighbours who died from loss of blood. In the second case, Arnold Paole, an ex-soldier turned farmer who allegedly was attacked by a vampire years before, died while haying. After his death, people began to die in the surrounding area and it was widely believed that Paole had returned to prey on the neighbours.|$|E

25|$|The {{re-establishment}} of the Roman Catholic ecclesiastical hierarchy in England in 1850 by Pope Pius IX, {{was followed}} by <b>a</b> <b>frenzy</b> of anti-Catholic feeling, often stoked by newspapers. Examples include an effigy of Cardinal Wiseman, {{the new head of}} the restored hierarchy, being paraded through the streets and burned on Bethnal Green, and graffiti proclaiming 'No popery!' being chalked on walls. Charles Kingsley wrote a vigorously anti-Catholic book Hypatia (1853). The novel was mainly aimed at the embattled Catholic minority in England, who had recently emerged from a half-illegal status.|$|E
