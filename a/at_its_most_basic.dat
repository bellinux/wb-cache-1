25|$|The {{tricarboxylic acid}} (TCA) cycle – or citric acid cycle – is an {{important}} step in cellular respiration. In the TCA cycle, a six carbon sugar will be oxidized. This oxidation produces the CO2 and H2O from the sugar. Plants, fungi, animals and bacteria all use this cycle to convert organic compounds to energy. This is how the majority of soil respiration occurs <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> level. Since the process relies on oxygen to occur, this is referred to as aerobic respiration.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Slife and Williams {{write that}} one of the hidden {{assumptions}} in CBT is that of determinism, or the absence of free will. They argue that CBT invokes a type of cause-and-effect relationship with cognition. They state that CBT holds that external stimuli from the environment enter the mind, causing different thoughts that cause emotional states. Nowhere in CBT theory is agency, or free will, accounted for. <b>At</b> <b>its</b> <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> foundational assumptions, CBT holds that human beings have no free will and are just determined by the cognitive processes invoked by external stimuli.|$|E
25|$|Through Takizaki he met {{and became}} close {{friends with the}} painter Mark Tobey, which led Horiuchi to re-examine his own {{approach}} to art. He became increasingly interested in collage, and began experimenting with the fusion of elements of traditional Japanese collage with more modern techniques, styles, and materials. <b>At</b> <b>its</b> <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> level, he was combining 'Eastern' shikishi design with 'Western' abstract expressionism, but injecting it with a unique energy, perhaps born of Horiuchi's numerous personal ups and downs and dislocations. He gradually gained command of this new style and, in the late 1950s, his work became increasingly popular.|$|E

25|$|The {{appearance}} of multimodality, <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> level, {{can change the}} way an audience perceives information. The most basic understanding of language comes via semiotics – the association between words and symbols. A multimodal text changes its semiotic effect by placing words with preconceived meanings in a new context, whether that context is audio, visual, or digital. This in turn creates a new, foundationally different meaning for an audience. Bezemer and Kress, two scholars on multimodality and semiotics, argue that students understand information differently when text is delivered {{in conjunction with a}} secondary medium, such as image or sound, than when it is presented in alphanumeric format only. This is due to it drawing a viewer’s attention to “both the originating site and the site of recontextualization”. Meaning is moved from one medium to the next, which requires the audience to redefine their semiotic connections. Recontextualizing an original text within other mediums creates a different sense of understanding for the audience, and this new type of learning can be controlled by the types of media used.|$|E
500|$|Privity is a {{doctrine}} in English contract law {{that covers the}} relationship between parties to a contract and other parties or agents. <b>At</b> <b>its</b> <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> level, the rule is that a contract can neither give rights to, nor impose obligations on, anyone {{who is not a}} party to the original agreement, i.e. a [...] "third party". Historically, third parties could enforce the terms of a contract, as evidenced in Provender v Wood, but the law changed in a series of cases in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the most well known of which are Tweddle v Atkinson in 1861 and Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre v Selfridge and Co Ltd in 1915.|$|E

2500|$|Adorno's work {{sets out}} from a central insight he shares with all early 20th century avant-garde art: the {{recognition}} of what is primitive in ourselves and the world itself. Neither Picasso's fascination with African sculpture nor Mondrian's reduction of painting to its most elementary component—the line—is comprehensible outside this concern with primitivism Adorno shared with the century's most radical art. At that time, the Western world, beset by world-wars, colonialist consolidation and accelerating commodification, sank into the very barbarism civilization had prided itself in overcoming. According to Adorno, society's self-preservation had become indistinguishable from societally sanctioned self-sacrifice: of [...] "primitive" [...] peoples, primitive aspects of the ego and those primitive, mimetic desires found in imitation and sympathy. Adorno's theory proceeds from an understanding of this primitive quality of reality which seeks to counteract whatever aims either to repress this primitive aspect or to further those systems of domination set in place by this return to barbarism. From this perspective, Adorno's writings on politics, philosophy, music and literature are a lifelong critique {{of the ways in}} which each tries to justify self-mutilation as the necessary price of self-preservation. According to Adorno's translator Robert Hullot-Kentor, the central motive of Adorno's work thus consists in determining [...] "how life could be more than the struggle for self-preservation". In this sense, the principle of self-preservation, Adorno writes in Negative Dialectics, is nothing but [...] "the law of doom thus far obeyed by history." [...] <b>At</b> <b>its</b> <b>most</b> <b>basic,</b> Adorno's thought is motivated by a fundamental critique of this law.|$|E
