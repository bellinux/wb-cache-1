40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [93]- 94) In telecommunication, {{the echo}} canceler using an adaptive filter {{is the most}} effective technique for controlling echoes. Because the precision of speech detection significantly affects how the echo path is modeled, this thesis presents the structures of two echo cancelers and two speech detectors. Of the two echo cancelers, one is based on <b>echo</b> path <b>loss</b> (EPL) of 6 dB and the other uses two different echo path models. The speech detectors using a three variable-length windows technique are implemented as the far-end speech detector. Double-talk detectors based on EPL and <b>echo</b> return <b>loss</b> enhancement (ERLE) are also developed and evaluated. Different adaptation algorithms on the adaptive filter are discussed. The normalized partial block least-mean-square (NPBLMS) algorithm is discussed and compared with the normalized least-mean-square (NLMS) algorithm. The results show that the former algorithm achieves a better performance. The center clipper is also introduced and implemented to compress the residual echo. The overall programs have been implemented on the digital signal processor TMS 320 C 54 x, where the partial maximum algorithm is also developed for the echo canceler in order to save more computation on DSP program.

40|$|In 5 {{roosting}} bats the resting frequency, that is {{the mean}} frequency of the cf-portion of consecutive sounds, is kept constant {{with a standard deviation}} which varies between 30 120 Hz in different bats and at different days. In 15 bats the emitted sounds were electronically shifted in frequency and played back as <b>artificial</b> <b>echoes.</b> Upward frequency shifts were responded by a decrease of the emission frequency. This frequency compensation occurred at frequency shifts of up to 4400 Hz in all bats and up to 6000 ttz in a few bats. The frequency decrease in different bats over the whole compensation range was 50 - 300 tIz smaller than the frequency shifts in the echoes. The echoes, therefore, returned at a frequency, called the reference frequency, which was by this compensation offset higher than the resting frequency. The standard deviations of the emission frequency in compensating bats were only slightly larger than in roosting bats and the same in the whole compensation range. All bats started to compensate frequency shifts when they were slightly larger than the compensation offset. Downward frequency shifts were not responded by a change of the emission frequency, but the accuracy with which the emission frequency was kept decreased somewhat. From these results it is concluded that the Doppler shift compensation system of the Horseshoe bats compares the echo frequency with the reference frequency and compensates deviations of upward frequency shifts. ...|$|R

40|$|Binaural auralizations using {{headphones}} {{have become}} increasingly pop-ular in virtual reality applications to create a realistic three dimensional sound scape. Conventional methods use dummy heads to capture the sig-nals that arise at the ears of a listener. Such recordings cannot be played back with head-tracking, which is a significant limitation. Spherical micro-phone arrays allow capture of the spatial structure of a sound field. It is possible to impose the acoustic properties {{of the human body}} onto such a sound field and to calculate the signals that would arise at the ears of a listener who is coincident with the microphone array. Rotations of the listener, and therefore head-tracking, are straightforward to achieve. This thesis investigates signal processing of sound fields captured with spherical microphone arrays in combination with spherical measurements of head related impulse responses. When implemented, such signal processing enables true three dimensional audio with possible head tracking for all rotations, without limitations on the number of simultaneous users. The thesis has three major parts; the theory behind sound field expan-sions to the spherical harmonics domain and the related signal process-ing, controlled simulations to quantify the e˙ects di˙erent signal processing chains have on the resulting binaural signals, and a user study to see the subjective e˙ects of the proposed signal processing chains. A magnitude-phase separated expansion method is proposed to reduce time domain errors due to discrete spatial sampling, which is evaluated both with simulations and in the user study.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this paper}} is to propose a transoesophageal {{echocardiography}} (TOE) image acquisition protocol which provides a systematic manner of acquiring a minimal number of overlapping 3 D TOE datasets allowing the reconstruction of a wide 3 D view of the left atrium (LA) with anatomical landmarks that are important for atrial fibrillation catheter ablation. Methods: In eight cardiac surgical patients, 3 D TOE datasets were acquired with a six-step protocol. In the protocol, step 1 aims to acquire the central view of the mitral valve (MV), aortic valve (AV) and left atrial appendage (LAA). Step 2 was developed to acquire the left pulmonary veins (PVs) and step 3 to acquire the right PVs. Steps 4, 5 and 6 were developed to create a sufficient overlap between different datasets. 3 D TOE datasets were registered and fused manually in end diastole. Results: The image acquisition protocol was feasible in all patients. In the fused 3 D dataset, a wide 3 D view of the LA is shown, and left and right PVs could be seen simultaneously. The LAA, MV, AV and fossa ovalis (FO) were visualised clearly in the 3 D TOE datasets. The PV ostia, which are located at the edges of the 3 D datasets, suffered more from the artefact of <b>echo</b> <b>loss.</b> The volume overlaps between neighbouring TOE datasets were 50 - 75 %. Conclusion: The major part of the LA anatomy incorporating the PVs, LAA, MV, AV and FO as important anatomical landmarks can be reconstructed by registering and fusing 3 D datasets acquired with the six-step TOE image acquisition protocol. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York...|$|R
