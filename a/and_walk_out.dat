25|$|As {{the year}} moves on, Den decides {{that he wants}} to leave Angie so he can marry Jan. He finally gets round to telling Angie his {{intentions}} in October, after which Angie becomes distraught. Desperate to hold on to her husband, she announces that she is terminally ill and only has six months to live. Upon hearing this, Den becomes wracked with guilt, and so decides to revise his plans and stay with Angie. He sets about organising a second honeymoon for them in Venice. However, their holiday is ruined when Jan arrives, and upon seeing her and Den together, Angie starts drinking again having not long given up. On the way home from Venice on the Orient Express, a drunk Angie tells the barman all about her big lie. Unfortunately for Angie, Den overhears every word, and from that moment on he reverts to his original plan to leave her, although he decides to wait a while before letting Angie know that he knows about her lie. On Christmas Day that year, Den decides to get his revenge. Thinking that her marriage is safe, Angie is happier than ever - until Den informs her that he'd overheard her conversation with the barman, and he then serves her divorce papers as a Christmas present. This episode had the highest number of viewers the show has ever seen - with more than 30 million viewers (more than half of the British population) tuning in to see it. In response, Angie and Sharon pack their bags <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> of the pub, choosing to take the route through the public area to cause Den the most embarrassment possible.|$|E

500|$|The time loop {{continues}} ad nauseam, {{though each}} time Pam speaks to Mulder, he comes closer {{to being able}} to remember her. She is finally able to convince him that events are repeating themselves, and before he is killed by the blast, Mulder begins repeating [...] "he's got a bomb" [...] to himself, in an attempt to recall it the next time around. In the following iteration of the day Mulder finds himself repeating the phrase in the bank, and acting on his hunch, calls Scully and then confronts Bernard before he begins the holdup, changing events on a fundamental level. Scully, acting on Mulder's phone call, brings Pam into the Bank. Mulder and Pam convince Bernard to give up <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> with Pam. The sirens of the approaching Police response become audible and Bernard becomes agitated and attempts to shoot Mulder, but Pam throws herself in front of Mulder as he fires. As she lies dying, she admits, [...] "This never happened before." [...] Bernard collapses to his knees, horrified by what he has done, and is peacefully arrested. The bomb blast averted, time continues as normal.|$|E

500|$|On November 11, 2011, The Artists Music Guild {{held its}} inaugural {{convention}} {{at the historic}} Heritage USA complex. The inaugural convention was filmed for a PBS special, A Walk Through the History of Music in the United States, with more than 2000 people in attendance. Cook has stated that his main goal for making the Heritage USA the official home of the Artists Music Guild's convention was to heal the broken people who were affected {{by the fall of}} PTL. The convention reunited several of the former PTL Singers, including Toni Bogart, Brian Keith, Lee Young and Sandy and Russell Hosey. Also in attendance were many of the employees who lost their jobs amid the sexual and financial scandal which caused the fall of the Bakker's ministry. Cook posited that [...] "by reuniting these individuals who have not performed together in over twenty plus years it would allow them to come together on their own terms <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> of the complex without someone telling them they could never come back. It was the ultimate form of healing the hurts from the past." [...] In 2015 the Guild became the parent company for the Mississippi Music Foundation in an effort to build a youth orchestra and a better outreach to educating and developing young and upcoming artists. Cook was added to the advisory board and became the official spokesperson and face of the foundation.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to that, Lee {{noted that the}} song was also inspired by other events in her life, including people who she was collaborating with, [...] "holding me down and manipulating me and betraying me", eventually leading her {{to make the decision}} of [...] "put my foot down <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> the door". During a 2011 interview with Spin magazine, Lee described [...] "Call Me When You're Sober" [...] as [...] "mostly a chick anthem: 'You only want me when you're drunk. You only want me because I'm not there'" [...] and deemed it empowering for her female audience of listeners due to the response she had received from them. In retrospect, Lee mentioned in 2016, [...] "I love this song because it has this fun spirit that was new for us as a band. You can still be heavy with a smile on your face." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jane Espenson {{described}} Jilly as a [...] "scene-stealer {{who uses}} her klutziness to both {{draw attention to}} herself and divert attention from her agenda". Though Oswald believes that Jilly was his assistant, Espenson feels that she acted more as his keeper; The Guardians Dan Martin notes that the character of Oswald is played for laughs against Ambrose's [...] "high heeled career bitch". Russell T Davies provided Jilly's response to the Blessing in [...] "The Gathering", where she looks into the crevasse and finds conviction. When asked about this scene, Espenson commented that she felt this sequence gave insight into Jilly's [...] "self-delusion" [...] and [...] "the ego of someone who can look into the void <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> of it with confidence", though added the caveat that [...] "I think the line is meant to hang there, unexplained and fantastically question-raising." [...] In the final episode of the fourth series, Jilly's own political views are demonstrated as she launches a morally nihilistic attack on the hypocrisies of modern society; {{in light of this}} rant Martin describes her as [...] "the only woman who can make a Guardianista flirt with the right wing through lipstick and compassion alone." ...|$|E
2500|$|Like the {{transistor}} {{radio in}} the 1950s and 1960s, the portable CD player in the 1990s, and the MP3 player in the 2000s, the Walkman defined the portable music market for {{the decade of the}} '80s, with cassette sales overtaking those of LPs. Total vinyl record sales remained higher well into the 1980s due to greater sales of singles, although cassette singles achieved popularity for a period in the 1990s. Another barrier to cassettes overtaking vinyl in sales was shoplifting; compact cassettes were small enough that a thief could easily place one inside a pocket <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> of a store without being noticed. To prevent this, retailers would place cassettes inside oversized [...] "spaghetti box" [...] containers or locked display cases, either of which would significantly inhibit browsing, thus reducing cassette sales. During the early 1980s some record labels sought to solve this problem by introducing new, larger packages for cassettes which would allow them to be displayed alongside vinyl records and compact discs, or giving them a further market advantage over vinyl by adding bonus tracks. Willem Andriessen wrote that the development in technology allowed [...] "hardware designers to [...] discover and satisfy one of the collective desires of human beings all over the world, independent of region, climate, religion, culture, race, sex, age and education: the desire to enjoy music at any time, at any place, [...] in any desired sound quality and almost at any wanted price.|$|E
