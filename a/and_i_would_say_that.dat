60|$|I {{leave the}} {{impression}} {{noted in the}} foregoing pages to tell its own small story, but have it on my conscience to wonder, in this connection, quite candidly and publicly and by way of due penance, at the scantness of such first-fruits of my sensibility. I was to see Siena repeatedly {{in the years to}} follow, I was to know her better, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I was to do her an ampler justice didn't that remark seem to reflect a little on my earlier poor judgment. This judgment strikes me to-day as having fallen short--true as it may be that I find ever a value, or at least an interest, even in the moods and humours and lapses of any brooding, musing or fantasticating observer to whom the finer sense of things is on the whole not closed. If he has on a given occasion nodded or stumbled or strayed, this fact by itself speaks to me of him--speaks to me, that is, of his faculty and his idiosyncrasies, and I care nothing for the application of his faculty unless it be, first of all, in itself interesting. Which may serve as my reply to any objection here breaking out--on the ground that if a spectator's languors are evidence, of a sort, about that personage, they are scarce evident about the case before him, at least if the case be important. I let my perhaps rather weak expression of the sense of Siena stand, at any rate-- for the sake of what I myself read into it; but I should like to amplify it by other memories, and would do so eagerly if I might here enjoy the space. The difficulty for these rectifications is that if the early vision has failed of competence or of full felicity, if initiation has thus been slow, so, with renewals and extensions, so, with the larger experience, one hindrance is exchanged for another. There is quite such a possibility as having lived into a relation too much {{to be able to make}} a statement of it.|$|E

The feminist movement exponentially expanded what art is, and how we look at art, and who is considered to be included in the discourse of art-making. I think that it caused a tremendous, radical change. You don’t want to have a cultural notion that one specific gender embodies creativity. All humanity - and all aspects of gender and sexuality and how people define themselves - are inherently creative. It’s against the interests of the culture at large not to embrace feminism as a model, just like many other models of liberation, because they don’t only liberate women, they liberate everybody." ...|$|E

5000|$|Filmmaker Aaron Ziegelman {{stated the}} {{following}} about his experience of Luboml, his inspiration {{to make its}} Jewish history known, and about the making of his documentary: I was a teenager when I received the news that my whole family in Luboml was killed.

It was only years later that I truly understood {{the enormity of the}} tragedy <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I felt guilty about my own initial reaction. Of course, the reality was that the whole world was silent including most of the Jewish community in America.I believe the first instinct came after seeing the movie Schindler's List. I wanted to know about the people in the camps before they were brought there. The idea was also reinforced when I started having the Luboml Book translated from Yiddish into English. I realized that this was a good starting point {{to tell the story of}} life before death and destruction.The part of the film shot in Luboml was exciting and emotional. Reliving my childhood, going to places that I remembered and the scene at the mass grave was very profound. I kept thinking of my uncle and aunt and their two daughters. These girls were my playmates and I saw them [...] I imagined the terror they must have had being marched, all together, to their deaths.

40|$|My {{interest}} in the topic of Mimamsa and ritual comes from an involvement {{with the kind of}} comparative theology that Francis Clooney has been pursuing. I have tried to comment a bit on some of his books, and so it was natural {{to take a look at}} his early book, a rather technical one, called Thinking Ritually. Clooney has been concerned with reading strategies in interpretation, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> my reading skill when it comes to Mimamsa and studies of it is very rudimentary. Mimamsa deals with the way grammatical constructions determine the meaning of ritual injunctions. My initial idea was to try to write about this as a ritual ontology. This article will present a few general conjunctions on Mimamsa and Eucharist. The point is to stay as close as possible to the actual texts and practices. I believe this method of doing comparative theology of ritual by limited scale comparisons of actual rites and texts is more productive and revealing then vast generalizations about 2 ̆ 2 the sacred 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 the sacrifice 2 ̆ 2. The Mimamsa tradition occupies an unusual place in the history of Indian thought between 2 ̆ 2 the sacred 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 the sacrifice 2 ̆ 2. Is it a philosophy, or a theory of ritual, or an odd form of mysticism, or something of all three...|$|E
40|$|Usability {{does not}} exist in any {{absolute}} sense; it can only be defined with reference to particular contexts. This, in turn, means that there are no absolute measures of usability, since, if the usability of an artefact is defined by the context in which that artefact is used, measures of usability must of necessity be defined by that context too. Despite this, {{there is a need for}} broad general measures which can be used to compare usability across a range of contexts. In addition, there is a need for “quick and dirty ” methods to allow low cost assessments of usability in industrial systems evaluation. This chapter describes the System Usability Scale (SUS) a reliable, low-cost usability scale that can be used for global assessments of systems usability. Usability and context Usability is not a quality that exists in any real or absolute sense. Perhaps it can be best summed up as being a general quality of the appropriateness to a purpose of any particular artefact. This notion is neatly summed up by Terry Pratchett in his novel “Moving Pictures”: “ ‘Well, at least he keeps himself fit, ’ said the Archchancellor nastily. ‘Not like the rest of you fellows. I went into the Uncommon Room this morning and it was full of chaps snoring!’ ‘That would be the senior masters, Master, ’ said the Bursar. ‘I would say they are supremely fit, myself. ’ ‘Fit? The Dean looks like a man who’s swallered a bed!’ ‘Ah, but Master, ’ said the Bursar, smiling indulgently, ‘the word “fit”,as I understand it, means “appropriate to a purpose”, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the body of the Dean is supremely appropriate to the purpose of sitting around all day and eating big heavy meals. ’ The Dean permitted himself a little smile. “ (Pratchett, 1990) In just the same way, the usability of any tool or system has to be viewed in terms of the context in which it is used, and its appropriateness to that context. With particular reference to information systems, this view of usability is reflected in the current draft international standar...|$|E
