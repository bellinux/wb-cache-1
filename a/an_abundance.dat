40|$|We {{consider}} potential systematic {{effects on}} oxygen abundances {{derived from the}} 6300 A (OI) line and the 7774 A OI triplet. Our solar intensity spectra of the 7774 A triplet confirm previous results which indicate a discrepancy between the observed equivalent widths of Altrock (1968) and the values predicted by Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) and recent NLTE models. However, this disagreement (at low micron(s)) {{does not seem to}} affect the solar O abundance as derived from flux spectra. We derive O <b>abundances</b> for <b>a</b> selection of relatively metal-rich F and G dwarfs from both the 6300 A (OI) line and 7774 A OI triplet and detail the various uncertainties which enter into the analyses. Minimizing possible systematic effects to the extent possible, we find for T(sub eff) approximately less than 6200 - 6300 K no systematic difference between the 6300 and 7774 <b>A</b> <b>abundances.</b> For T(sub eff) approximately greater than 6200 - 6300 K, however 7774 <b>A</b> <b>abundances</b> are substantially larger than the 6300 <b>A</b> <b>abundances.</b> This agreement in O abundances from the two features at cooler T(sub eff) conflicts with that of others and we suggest that the discrepancy {{may be due to the}} different model atmospheres utilized. If recently proposed, hotter T(sub eff) values for metal-poor dwarfs are correct, then there appears to be no discrepancy between the 6300 <b>A</b> <b>abundances</b> of metal-poor giants are correct, then there appears to be no discrepancy between the 6300 <b>A</b> <b>abundances</b> of metal-poor giants or dwarfs and the 7774 <b>A</b> <b>abundances</b> for dwarfs. This would seem to rule out substantial LTE departures or atmospheric inhomogeneity effects skewing metal-poor O abundances from the 7774 A triplet (for cooler stars having low metallicity anyway). Given the repeated inability of authors to reproduce each others' O abundances from the 6300 A (OI) line and the uncertainties in the solar equivalent width, we question the usual assumption that the 6300 A (OI) line and the uncertainties in the solar equivalent width, we question the usual assumption that the 6300 <b>A</b> (OI) <b>abundances</b> are more reliable than those from the permitted triplet...|$|R

40|$|It {{is assumed}} that the {{abundance}} of Agriotes wireworms (Coleoptera: Elateridae) is affected by agro-ecological factors such as climatic and edaphic factors and the crop/previous crop grown at the sites investigated. The aim of this study, conducted in three different geographic counties in Croatia from 2007 to 2009, {{was to determine the}} factors that influence the abundance of adult click beetle of the species Agriotes brevis Cand., Agriotes lineatus (L.), Agriotes obscurus (L.), Agriotes sputator (L.), and Agriotes ustulatus Schall. The mean annual air temperature, total rainfall, percentage of coarse and fine sand, coarse and fine silt and clay, the soil pH, and humus were investigated as potential factors that may influence abundance. Adult click beetle emergence was monitored using sex pheromone traps (YATLORf and VARb 3). Exploratory data analysis was preformed via regression tree models and regional differences in Agriotes species 2 ̆ 7 abundance were predicted based on the agro-ecological factors measured. It was found that the best overall predictor of <b>A.</b> brevis <b>abundance</b> was the previous crop grown. Conversely, the best predictor of <b>A.</b> lineatus <b>abundance</b> was the current crop being grown and the percentage of humus. The best predictor of <b>A.</b> obscurus <b>abundance</b> was soil pH in KCl. The best predictor of <b>A.</b> sputator <b>abundance</b> was rainfall.
