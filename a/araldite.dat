During this time, Platt imprinted the a prediction on Waterlow that, [...] "Nutrition will be the problem of the future". He was sent to the Caribbean in 1945 to investigate why large numbers of children there were dying and discovered that many had oedematous malnutrition and fatty livers, but was unsure why this was the case. To investigate the cases, he made a microbalance using the newly invented adhesive <b>araldite,</b> to weigh 2 mg samples of liver tissue and also a microrespirometer to measure the enzyme activity in the samples. The microrespirometer {{is said to have been}} much more sensitive than those used by other biochemists at the time and the microbalance was sensitive to within one millionth of a gram. He subsequently discovered that the syndrome he was observing was the same as Kwashiorkor which had been described a few years earlier in Africa.

Right after the team's elimination to Minas, it was announced that Jefferson Sobral, Marcão and Rômulo would not have their contracts extended. Five players were immediately confirmed for 2011: C/PF João Victor, PF Augusto, SF Bristott, SF Audrei and PG Espiga. In mid-May, EC Pinheiros announced a deal with former starting shooting guard André Góes, then obligating Joinville to look for a good replacement to the key member of the squad.That replacement for the SG position ended up being former starting PG Manteguinha, and the team later hired PG Paulinho Boracini, who played for EC Paulistano in the 09-10 season. Another big deal for the team was the deal with CR Flamengo, which brought center Fernando Coloneze to the team, filling a need for a big man inside, as the two centers weren't very tall and the team needed more points in the paint. Espiga, who was a very good option off the bench, retired a couple of months before NBB3 started, in a game between Araldite/Univille and a team made up of his friends. Fans filled the stadium, generating a lot of donations in food to the poor in Joinville. Three other big deals brought Luis Gruber, Renato Scholz and Guilherme Schneider to Joinville.

Model tests on stiffened plates made of <b>Araldite</b> and steel sheeting are reported and the test results are compared with theoretical predictions.

Models made of <b>Araldite</b> are shown to be useful in simulating buckling modes and in obtaining magnified values of the likely plate and stiffener deformations in the serviceability and ultimate limit states. The ultimate capacity predicted from models is, however, significantly lower than the values of the corresponding steel prototypes on account of the early loss of stiffness of the members caused by the large deformations. ...|$|E

40|$|Epoxy resin {{appears to}} be the best {{embedding}} material for preserving tissues for electron microscopy. Its low linear coefficient of contraction I ensures that no appreciable distortion can occur owing to polymerization damage or excessive shrinkage (1). This plastic also is exceptionally stable in the electron beam, so that surface damage to the section is slight. Although <b>Araldite</b> blocks are often more difficult to cut than those of methacrylate, the introduction of the diamond knife (2) with its superior cutting abilities over The linear contraction is less than 1 per cent, an amount even lower than that of the polyester resins like Vestopal W, which contract about 2. 5 per cent (author's measurements, unpublished data). the glass knife has considerably reduced this difficulty. The greatest disadvantage of <b>Araldite</b> is the low contrast of sections of osmium tetroxidefixed material in the electron microscope. In the author's experience, satisfactory lead staining (3, 4) of <b>Araldite</b> sections is difficult to obtain. More contrast is achieved by staining <b>Araldite</b> sections with potassium permanganate (5, 6), but a fine precipitate on the stained sections is troublesome. Potassium permanganate-fixed tissues (7) show satisfactory contrast in <b>Araldite,</b> but permanganate fixation appears less perfect than osmium tetroxide fixation in several respects (8). Mitochondria are nearly always swollen, and some structures, e. g. 492 B R I E F N O • ~. SRNA granules and fat vacuoles, either are not stained or are oxidized or leached away during fixation. On the other hand, permanganate has proved especially useful for the study of membranous structures of the cell (9). In recent experiments to study the effects of ionizing radiation on cell membranes, many attempts were made to prevent the swelling and breaking-up of mitochondria during fixation by permanganate solutions. The combined use of a modified osmium tetroxide fixative, <b>Araldite</b> embedding, and staining of the tissue in an acetone solution of potassium permanganate was found to give good preservation and increased contrast of these structures...|$|E

40|$|Comparative {{studies were}} carried out on the curing kinetics, {{physical}} and mechanical properties of conventionally and microwave cured epoxy resins. Epoxy resins <b>Araldite</b> LY 5052 and DLS 772 were used for this study. 4 4 ' Diaminodiphenyl sulfone was used as a hardener in the preparation of both systems. Nuclear magnetic resonance and gel permeation chromatography were used to identify the chemical structure of the resins. Differential scanning calorimetry was used to monitor the curing kinetics of conventionally cured epoxy samples while a microwave heating calorimeter was used to monitor the curing kinetics of microwave cured epoxy samples 'in situ'. These studies {{were carried out}} under non-isothermal and isothermal conditions. For both conditions, there was {{a significant increase in the}} fractional conversion of the microwave cured samples compared to the conventionally cured samples. The curing reactions for samples cured using microwave heating took place over a smaller temperature range. Higher reaction rates were observed in the samples cured using microwave heating. There were some differences in the kinetic parameters of the non-isothermal curing reactions of samples cured using microwave and conventional heating. For the <b>Araldite</b> LY 5052 / 4 4 ' DDS epoxy system, the microwave cured samples had higher activation energy than conventionally cured samples, while for the <b>Araldite</b> DLS 772 / 4 4 ' DDS epoxy system, the microwave cured samples had lower activation energy. The activation energies of the microwave isothermal curing of both <b>Araldite</b> LY 5052 / 4 4 ' DDS and <b>Araldite</b> DLS 772 / 4 4 'DDS epoxy systems were lower than the activation energies of the conventionally cured samples. Infrared spectroscopy showed that the curing reaction followed the same path during conventional and microwave heating. It also revealed that the reaction rate of the microwave cured samples was higher than the conventionally cured samples. For both epoxy systems, the microwave cured samples had a higher glass transition temperature (Tg), higher cross-link density (v) and lower molecular weight between cross-links. These showed that the microwave cured samples had a more compact network structure than the conventionally cured samples, which is an indication of better mechanical properties.
