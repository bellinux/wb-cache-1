50|$|More {{specific}} citations may <b>add</b> <b>line</b> numbers, e.g. Symposium 209a5-9, {{but these}} generally {{refer to the}} lines in John Burnet's Oxford Classical Text, not to Estienne's line divisions.|$|E
40|$|Line item veto, {{a feature}} present in most American States, gives the {{governor}} {{the power to}} veto single appropriation items from the budget. Its effects on the tax level, however, are still controversial in the empirical and theoretical literature (cf. Holtz-Eakins (1988) and Besley and Case (2003)). Line item veto is mostly a time invariant feature and to asses its effects previous studies have interacted it with political control variables such as a divided government. The endogenity problems that arise from using a political variable to explain a policy variable, however, have not been dealt with in these studies. We use three empirical approaches to tackle the problem and show that line item veto does have a significant {{negative effect on the}} tax rate in the States: diffs-in-diffs estimation with instrumental variables (election results in lower offices at the state level), regression discontinuity design, and a dynamic panel. Our prior on its effects comes from adapting the separation of powers model by Persson, Roland and Tabellini (2000) to the American States setup: we <b>add</b> <b>line</b> item veto and an executive. Our model delivers a clear prediction on the tax level, on the amount of public good, and on the importance of group specific transfers. ...|$|E

5000|$|Patch {{commutation}} {{requires that}} the exact changes that made derivative files are stored or can be reconstructed. From these exact changes {{it is possible to}} compute how one of them should be changed in order to rebase it on the other. For instance, if patch A <b>adds</b> <b>line</b> [...] "X" [...] after line 7 of file F and patch B <b>adds</b> <b>line</b> [...] "Y" [...] after line 310 of file F, B has to be rewritten if it is rebased on A: the <b>line</b> must be <b>added</b> on <b>line</b> 311 of file F, because the <b>line</b> <b>added</b> in A offsets the line numbers by one.|$|R

30|$|From Table  4, {{it can be}} {{seen that}} the {{reliability}} indices of system and bus 5 have been greatly improved, after <b>adding</b> <b>line</b> 3 - 5 to the gird.|$|R
30|$|Comparing Table  8 with Table  7, it is {{interesting}} to note that <b>adding</b> <b>line</b> 1 greatly improves the reliability at the bus 39 and thus increases the system reliability, as well as decrease the reliability at some other buses (such as bus 4 and 8). The reason is that <b>adding</b> the <b>line</b> changes the system structure and then changes the power flow.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] (yuan) {{denotes the}} unknown , so the numerals on that line mean [...] The line below is the {{constant}} term (...) {{and the line}} above is the coefficient of the quadratic (...) term. The system accommodates arbitrarily high exponents of the unknown by <b>adding</b> more <b>lines</b> on top and negative exponents by <b>adding</b> <b>lines</b> below the constant term. Decimals can also be represented.|$|R

5000|$|The [...] (yuan) {{denotes the}} unknown x, so the numerals on that line mean 18x. The line below is the {{constant}} term (-316) {{and the line}} above is the coefficient of the quadratic (x2) term. The system accommodates arbitrarily high exponents of the unknown by <b>adding</b> more <b>lines</b> on top and negative exponents by <b>adding</b> <b>lines</b> below the constant term. Decimals can also be represented. Later, the line order was reversed so that the first line is the lowest exponent.|$|R
40|$|With the {{development}} of the public transportation, bus network becomes complicated and hard to evaluate. Transfer time is a vital indicator to evaluate bus network. This paper proposed a method to calculate transfer times using Space P. Four bus networks in China have been studied in this paper. Some static properties based on graph theory and complex theory are used to evaluate bus topological structure. Moreover, a bus network evolution model to reduce transfer time is proposed by <b>adding</b> <b>lines.</b> The <b>adding</b> method includes four types among nodes with random choice, large transfer time, degree, and small degree. The results show that <b>adding</b> <b>lines</b> with nodes of small degree is most effective comparing with the other three types. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

He significantly improved {{the level of}} detail in the cohesive part of the diagram, and <b>added</b> <b>lines</b> for different modes of transportation.

Woodward <b>added</b> <b>lines</b> to the traditional refrain in a style characteristic of his delight in archaic poetry. It was published in A Cambridge Carol Book: Being Fifty-two Songs for Christmas, Easter and Other Seasons in 1924.|$|R
50|$|In 1889, the C.O. & S. {{railroad}} {{line was}} purchased by the Illinois Central system. At that time the ICRR connected Chicago with Fulton, KY. The ICRR <b>added</b> <b>lines</b> going to New Orleans and {{changed its name to}} the I.C. Gulf R.R. For years the passenger train through Frayser was called the Fulton Accommodation.|$|R
5000|$|The {{position}} of the <b>added</b> <b>line</b> is then irrelevant. When one projects on [...] the {{position of}} the line does not matter because one is working on the space of diffeomorphism invariant states and so the line can be moved [...] "closer" [...] or [...] "further" [...] from the vertex without changing the result.|$|R
30|$|Note that DONEs are {{propagated}} from bottom-left to top-right in {{the forward}} sweep, so the termination proceeds from bottom-left to top-right. Thus, the if statement that checks whether the down or left adjacent grid points have terminated is <b>added</b> (<b>Line</b> 6) to avoid infinite waiting when waiting for messages from the down or left adjacent grid points (Line 7).|$|R
5000|$|In 1982, MCA Home Video {{released}} Voyager {{from the}} Unknown, which edited together two episodes ("Voyagers" [...] pilot episode and [...] "Voyagers of the Titanic") into one feature-length film that also incorporated new video special effects, some voice-over dubbing for Peluce's character {{to change or}} <b>add</b> <b>lines</b> and <b>added</b> footage to include a super-computer which directed Voyager missions.|$|R

The inscription refers to a certain Sivin, who appears to have held that position at the time of Prince Boris I (852-889). Sivin was among the Bulgarian boyars who supported the official Christianization, as the subsequently <b>added</b> <b>line</b> [...] "May God help" [...] suggests.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Add</b> a <b>Line</b> was {{a daytime}} radio game show which aired on ABC July 4, 1949, to September 26, 1949. [...] The title {{came from the}} show's format, which [...] "called for players to <b>add</b> the final <b>line</b> to a rhyme given {{to them by the}} host." ...|$|R

This was in {{contrast}} to their main inspiration, Thomas Percy, who often polished up vernacular text by <b>adding</b> <b>lines</b> or merging different incomplete versions. Like Percy, they omitted obscene songs and verses. Unlike Percy they tried to find the tunes to songs. John Payne Collier founded the Shakespeare Society in 1841.|$|R
