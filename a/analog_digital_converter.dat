40|$|Pipelined <b>analog</b> to <b>digital</b> <b>converters</b> {{are widely}} used in {{telecommunication}} systems and instrumentation systems, where wide bandwidth analog input signals need to be converted into medium to high resolution digital signals. A pipelined <b>analog</b> to <b>digital</b> <b>converter</b> is sensitive to distortion introduced by its residue amplifiers, because such distortion leaks into the digital output signal, thus affecting the converter resolution. To reduce distortion, high performance operational amplifiers are usually required {{in the first few}} pipeline stages, but this causes the power consumption, the area occupation and therefore the cost of the converter to increase. An alternative approach is to design low performance operational amplifiers to reduce area and power, and compensate for the distortion they introduce by calibrating the signal in the digital domain. This dissertation presents a new digital background calibration technique called Harmonic Distortion Correction, which allows the estimation and correction of the distortion introduced by residue amplifiers in pipelined <b>analog</b> to <b>digital</b> <b>converters.</b> Implemented in a prototype pipelined <b>analog</b> to <b>digital</b> <b>converter</b> together with another digital calibration technique known in literature as DAC Noise Cancellation, Harmonic Distortion Correction has been proven to facilitate low-voltage operation and to enable reductions in power consumption relative to comparable conventional state-of-the-art pipelined <b>analog</b> to <b>digital</b> <b>converters.</b> Chapter 1 provides a mathematical model for the analysis of the distortion introduced by residue amplifiers in pipelined <b>analog</b> to <b>digital</b> <b>converters,</b> outlines the theory behind the Harmonic Distortion Correction algorithm, and presents the behavioral model of an example pipelined <b>analog</b> to <b>digital</b> <b>converter</b> implementing such technique.

40|$|The {{commercialization of}} Marconi’s radio {{transmission}} and reception, {{along with the}} development of integrated circuits in the 1960 ’s have facilitated many new consumer products for wireless communication, where the mobile phones or handsets are one. These handsets started out as a portable phone, mounted in cars, and have with time added additional services as Short Message Service, and have today become a media center with global positioning, and high-speed internet connection. This has been possible with the use of multistandard radios, that can receive and transmit information using many different wireless communication standards. Many of these handsets have one dedicated integrated radio chain for each communication standard used, which results in a large and expensive integrated circuit for these modern handsets. The challenge of today is to make modern handsets cheaper, smaller, and lower in power consumption. The power consumption is an issue of particular importance since the capacity of the available power sources do not increase with the demands of the handsets. One proposed method {{to do this is to}} move towards Software Defined Radio, where software of the handset control a single reconfigurable radio, and set which communication standard that the handset is to use. In this way, the handset can be reconfigured to communicate in the most power or data efficient way, depending on the choice of the user. The area of the Software Defined Radio receiver is also smaller than the parallel chains that are implemented today, which reduces the cost of production. The Software Defined Radio receiver is very challenging to design, since there is a large number of wireless communication standards, sometimes even within the same frequency bands. This make the reception of a weak desired signal difficult, when there may be a strong interferer in the same frequency band. A key component in the Software Defined Radio receiver is the <b>Analog</b> to <b>Digital</b> <b>Converter.</b> The development of new wireless communication standards requires higher performance of the <b>Analog</b> to <b>Digital</b> <b>Converter</b> in the receiver. This performance is hard to achieve, when the power consumption should be low, and the area should be small, especially in the modern integrated circuit technologies. This thesis put the development of the communication industry into a historical perspective, and gives a review of the fundamental development of wireless communication applications. The fundamental concepts and implementations of <b>Analog</b> to <b>Digital</b> <b>Converters</b> for multistandard wireless receiver chains are also covered. Finally two case studies on the design of multistandard <b>Analog</b> to <b>Digital</b> <b>Converters</b> for Software Defined Radio applications are presented. These <b>Analog</b> to <b>Digital</b> <b>Converters</b> implement different methods of reconfiguration in order to comply with the requirements of the standards.
