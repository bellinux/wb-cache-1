5|$|De Veer and Thomson {{prepared}} <b>a</b> <b>classified</b> 150-page {{report on}} the setting up of the gendarmerie. There were discussions of 5,000 gendarmes led by Dutch officers provided {{by the government of}} the Netherlands. On February24,1914, 13Dutch officers arrived at Vlorë: Captain Fabius, Major Kroon, Major De Waal, Major Sluys, Captain Doorman, Major Roelfsema, Dr. De Groot, Captain Sar, Major Verhulst, Major Snellen van Vollenhoven, First Lieutenant Mallinckrodt, Captains Reimers and Sonne.|$|E
5|$|On 9 October, Banksy {{unveiled}} one of {{the more}} elaborate and politically strong pieces of the series. It featured armed soldiers and horses spray-painted on a car and trailer in an empty lot in the Lower East Side. Instead of commentary about the work, the accompanying audio was that of <b>a</b> <b>classified</b> video from the July 12, 2007 Baghdad airstrike. After being dismantled, the car was towed away to prevent further defacement.|$|E
5|$|The Lockheed Senior Prom was <b>a</b> <b>classified</b> black program {{conducted}} by the United States Air Force {{in conjunction with the}} Lockheed Corporation's Skunk Works for the development and testing of a cruise missile using stealth technology. Based on the company's Have Blue demonstrator, the six Senior Prom vehicles proved successful in testing conducted at Area 51 in the late 1970s; despite this, the aircraft was not selected to enter production, and the program was terminated in the early 1980s.|$|E

5|$|Critchfield left Los Alamos in 1946 and {{returned}} to George Washington University, but soon left to join Wigner at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. In 1947 he became {{an assistant professor at}} the University of Minnesota, where he participated, with Edward P. Ney and John R. Winckler, in <b>a</b> <b>classified</b> project to improve balloon technology. Here, with Leland S. Bohl, he invented and patented the natural shape balloon, and participated, with Ney and his student Sophie Oleksa, in an early search for primary cosmic ray electrons.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1950s {{at the height}} of the Cold War, the United States Army {{conducted}} <b>a</b> <b>classified</b> feasibility study that proposed the construction of a manned military outpost on the Moon called Project Horizon with the potential to conduct a wide range of missions from scientific research to nuclear Earth bombardment. The study included the possibility of conducting a lunar-based nuclear test. The Air Force, which at the time was in competition with the Army for a leading role in the space program, developed its own similar plan called Lunex. However, both these proposals were ultimately passed over as the space program was largely transferred from the military to the civilian agency NASA.|$|E

5|$|En {{route to}} <b>a</b> <b>classified</b> S.H.I.E.L.D. facility, {{tensions}} among the agents are high due to poor communication during the fight. This concerns Reyes, who decides to double-cross Coulson {{and secure the}} 0-8-4 for her government. Together, the agents devise a plan to activate the weapon, blowing {{a hole in the}} Bus. The drop in pressure opens the interior doors, allowing the agents to subdue the soldiers. At the facility, Reyes and her men are incarcerated and the 0-8-4 is launched into the sun in a rocket. The team watch the launch together, celebrating their combined efforts, while Ward agrees to supervise Skye's S.H.I.E.L.D. training. Skye secretly confirms her allegiance to the hacktivist group the Rising Tide.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1982, Deputy Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci sent a {{memorandum}} to the Air Force and Navy, encouraging them to seek out potential foreign customers to procure FX aircraft. However, four months later Carlucci sent <b>a</b> <b>classified</b> memo to the same services to abandon the FX, and green-lighting the exporting of front-line fighters overseas. In December, after prompting from the White House, Carlucci reversed his position again, and directed the Air Force to fund {{a small number of}} F-20s in the fiscal year 1984 budget.|$|E
5|$|The China National Space Administration offers NASA the Taiyang Shen, <b>a</b> <b>classified</b> {{booster rocket}} that {{can carry a}} payload to Mars. Meanwhile, JPL astrodynamicist Rich Purnell devises a {{trajectory}} to divert Hermes back to Mars for a rescue {{more than two years}} earlier, using the Chinese booster to resupply Hermes for an additional eighteen months. Sanders rejects the plan, refusing to risk the crew, but Henderson surreptitiously sends the details to Hermes. The crew unanimously vote for the plan, and NASA — powerless to stop them — resupplies Hermes as it uses Earth's gravity to slingshot back to Mars.|$|E

5|$|The game closely {{follows the}} plot of the film. MI6 agent James Bond is sent to Bilbao, Spain to meet a Swiss banker and {{retrieve}} money for Robert King, a friend of M who purchased <b>a</b> <b>classified</b> report from the Russian Atomic Energy Department. The report, which was taken from a dead MI6 agent, is believed to contain information about terrorists who have attacked King's oil pipeline in Kazakhstan. Bond asks the banker who killed the MI6 agent, but he is quickly killed by an assassin before he can reveal the name. Bond escapes with the money and takes it to the MI6 headquarters in London. A terrorist group then launches an attack on the MI6 headquarters, prompting Bond to pursue the assassin through a London Underground station. Bond offers her protection, but she ultimately kills herself by exploding a hot air balloon.|$|E
5|$|This {{policy was}} {{realized}} as NSC-68, <b>a</b> <b>classified</b> report {{issued by the}} United States National Security Council in April 1950 and written by Paul Nitze, Kennan's successor as director of policy planning. Kennan and Charles Bohlen, another State Department expert on Russia, argued about the wording of NSC-68, which became the basis of Cold War policy. Kennan rejected the idea that Stalin had a grand design for world conquest implicit in Nitze's report and argued that he actually feared overextending Russian power. Kennan even argued that NSC-68 {{should not have been}} drafted at all, as it would make U.S. policies too rigid, simplistic, and militaristic. Acheson overruled Kennan and Bohlen, endorsing the assumption of Soviet menace implied by NSC-68.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in medias res, while Piz (Chris Lowell) and Mac (Tina Majorino) {{are at a}} party, a bloodied Veronica stumbles to Piz’s {{door and}} collapses. The episode flashes back to two days earlier. As the Lilith House celebrates {{the end of the}} Greek system, Logan (Jason Dohring) {{abruptly}} breaks up with Veronica. Weevil helps Dean O’Dell (Ed Begley, Jr.) fix his TV. A man comes into the Dean’s office and implicitly threatens to remove his funding if the Greek system stays closed. The Dean tells Keith (Enrico Colantoni) to track his wife, and Veronica sobs in the shower due to her breakup with Logan. The Dean unexpectedly reinstates the Greek system, to the delight of Dick (Ryan Hansen). The Dean and Veronica spot <b>a</b> <b>classified</b> ad that states that a mysterious person will find his next victim at a party. After receiving an A on her paper, she visits Tim Foyle (James Jordan) and sees an investigation board. Veronica enlists Wallace (Percy Daggs III), Piz, and Mac for help in investigating an upcoming Pi Sig party.|$|E

5|$|In 1895 Bain first played {{competitive}} {{ice hockey}} when he answered <b>a</b> <b>classified</b> ad {{placed in a}} newspaper by the Winnipeg Victorias, who were looking for new players. Though he played with a broken stick held together by wire, Bain made the team only five minutes into the tryout. Bain quickly became a star centre and leader for the Victorias. This was proven during a February 14, 1896 game against the Montreal Victorias for the Stanley Cup, the trophy for the national hockey championship in Canada. It was a 2–0 victory for Winnipeg that gave them the Cup. This victory {{marked the first time}} a team outside of Quebec had won the trophy. The team was greeted by a huge crowd at the Canadian Pacific Railway station when their train, decorated with hockey sticks and the Union Jack, returned to Winnipeg. They were led to a feast in their honour in a parade of open sleighs, where fans gathered to celebrate the championship.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, {{calculations}} by the Polish mathematician Stanislaw Ulam and his collaborator Cornelius Everett, {{along with}} confirmations by Fermi, {{had shown that}} not only was Teller's earlier estimate of the quantity of tritium needed for the H-bomb a low one, but that even with higher amounts of tritium, the energy loss in the fusion process would be too great to enable the fusion reaction to propagate. However, in 1951 Teller and Ulam made a breakthrough, and invented a new design, proposed in <b>a</b> <b>classified</b> March 1951 paper, On Heterocatalytic Detonations I: Hydrodynamic Lenses and Radiation Mirrors, for a practical megaton-range H-bomb. The exact contribution provided respectively from Ulam and Teller to {{what became known as the}} Teller–Ulam design is not definitively known in the public domain, and the exact contributions of each and how the final idea was arrived upon has been a point of dispute in both public and classified discussions since the early 1950s.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} segment, Mr. Burns fires Homer for his laziness and incompetence. Looking for work, Homer answers <b>a</b> <b>classified</b> ad {{to become a}} grave digger. Meanwhile, Mr. Burns is nearing the {{completion}} of his giant robotic laborer, which he hopes will eventually replace weak-bodied human workers. The only remaining step is to implant a human brain into the machine's body. Searching a graveyard the following night, Mr. Burns mistakes Homer, snoring in an open grave, for a newly buried corpse and, despite signs that Homer may still be alive, removes Homer's brain with an ice cream scoop and places it in the robot. However, Robo-Homer is just as lazy and incompetent as he was as a human, using his X-ray vision to locate donuts. Mr. Burns declares the experiment a failure and, after restoring the brain to Homer's still-living body, kicks the robot, which topples over and crushes Mr. Burns. Afterward, he tells Smithers to get some surgical tools and ether.|$|E

2500|$|By {{construction}} the Outer space Xn is a finite-dimensional {{simplicial complex}} {{equipped with a}} natural action of Out(F'n) which is properly discontinuous and has finite simplex stabilizers. The main result of Culler–Vogtmann 1986 paper, obtained via Morse-theoretic methods, was that the Outer space Xn is contractible. Thus the quotient space Xn /Out(F'n) is [...] "almost" [...] <b>a</b> <b>classifying</b> space for Out(F'n) {{and it can be}} thought of as <b>a</b> <b>classifying</b> space over Q. Moreover, Out(F'n) is known to be virtually torsion-free, so for any torsion-free subgroup H of Out(F'n) the action of H on Xn is discrete and free, so that Xn/H is <b>a</b> <b>classifying</b> space for H. For these reasons the Outer space is a particularly useful object in obtaining homological and cohomological information about Out(F'n). In particular, Culler and Vogtmann proved that Out(F'n) has virtual cohomological dimension 2n−3.|$|R
