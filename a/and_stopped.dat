5|$|Hundreds of {{thousands}} of protesters camped out in Tahrir Square where a symbolic funeral procession was held for Ahmad Mohamed Mahmoud of Al-Ta'awun.

40|$|AbstractVoluntary action control {{requires}} {{selection of}} appropriate responses <b>and</b> <b>stopping</b> of inappropriate responses. Selection <b>and</b> <b>stopping</b> are often investigated separately, but {{they appear to}} recruit similar brain regions, including the pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA) and inferior frontal gyrus. We therefore examined the evidence for overlap of selection <b>and</b> <b>stopping</b> using two approaches: a meta-analysis of existing studies of selection <b>and</b> <b>stopping,</b> <b>and</b> a novel within-subject fMRI study in which action selection <b>and</b> a <b>stop</b> signal task were combined factorially. The novel fMRI study also permitted us to investigate hypotheses regarding a common mechanism for selection <b>and</b> <b>stopping.</b> The preSMA was identified by both methods as common to selection <b>and</b> <b>stopping.</b> However, stopping a selected action did not recruit preSMA more than stopping a specified action, nor did stop signal reaction times differ significantly across the two conditions. These {{findings suggest that the}} preSMA supports both action selection <b>and</b> <b>stopping,</b> but the two processes may not require access to a common inhibition mechanism. Instead, the preSMA might represent information about potential actions that is used in both action selection <b>and</b> <b>stopping</b> in order to resolve conflict between competing available responses...|$|R

5|$|From 1952 to 1962, M-28 crossed US2 at Wakefield going south <b>and</b> <b>stopped</b> at the Wisconsin border, {{connecting}} with a county road.
