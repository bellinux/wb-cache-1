He put this new product on the market and during the Great Depression, the Lee Hunter, Jr., Manufacturing Co. sold the $497 Kwikurent charger as fast as the company could make them. After serving in both the U.S. Army Engineering Corps and Ordnance Corps during World War II, Hunter returned to St. Louis in 1946 and reopened his business under the name of Hunter Engineering. Lee Hunter also laid the foundation for a global distribution base for Hunter products. In 1955 Hunter developed a new wheel alignment system called 'Lite-A-Line,' which became the industry standard. In 1962, Hunter's 'Tune-Align' became the first mechanical alignment system capable of compensating for wheel run-out, a major factor affecting wheel <b>alignment</b> <b>precision.</b> Hunter Engineering continued to expand its export markets and in 1964 was named by the U.S. Department of Commerce as a winner of the E-Award for excellence in the development of export trade.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{generation}} of multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) {{is a crucial}} step for many bioinformatic analyses. Thus improving MSA accuracy and identifying potential errors in MSAs is important {{for a wide range}} of post-genomic research. We present a novel method called MergeAlign which constructs consensus MSAs from multiple independent MSAs and assigns an <b>alignment</b> <b>precision</b> score to each column. RESULTS: Using conventional benchmark tests we demonstrate that on average MergeAlign MSAs are more accurate than MSAs generated using any single matrix of sequence substitution. We show that MergeAlign column scores are related to <b>alignment</b> <b>precision</b> and hence provide an ab initio method of estimating <b>alignment</b> <b>precision</b> in the absence of curated reference MSAs. Using two novel and independent alignment performance tests that utilise a large set of orthologous gene families we demonstrate that increasing MSA performance leads to an increase in the performance of downstream phylogenetic analyses. CONCLUSION: Using multiple tests of alignment performance we demonstrate that this novel method has broad general application in biological research...|$|E
