5|$|Farther south, in Guinea-Bissau, a {{storm surge}} flooded roads and low-lying establishments, such as offices and {{military}} barracks. The sea water submerged {{vast amounts of}} cropland in the Tombali Region, resulting in great losses of rice. Offshore, waves as high as 23feet (7m) capsized <b>a</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>boat</b> with a crew of 19; twelve members were rescued, but the remaining seven disappeared at sea and were presumed dead.|$|E
5|$|Off {{the coast}} of Los Cabos in Baja California Sur, large swells capsized <b>a</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>boat</b> with seven people aboard on August25. Four were able to swim back to shore while the other three {{remained}} missing and were later presumed dead. Strong rain bands along the outer fringes of Hurricane Marie brought heavy rain to parts of the state. Landslides blocked several roads near Los Cabos while gusty winds downed trees and power lines. Owing to the dangerous conditions, all schools Los Cabos were closed on August25.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the number}} of Spanish bishops who {{attended}} is unknown, the Archbishop of Toledo, Raymund, did attend. King Alfonso VII of León and Castile interceded with the pope to lift the sentences against those bishops who did not attend. King Stephen of England refused permission {{for any of the}} English bishops to attend, except for the bishops of Hereford, Norwich and Chichester. It was the papal summons which caused the Archbishop of Canterbury, Theobald of Bec, to quarrel with his king, after Stephen refused the archbishop permission to go to the council. Theobald instead managed to evade the guards placed on him and hired <b>a</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>boat</b> to take him across the English Channel to attend the council.|$|E
5|$|As Utor was {{traversing}} the South China Sea, <b>a</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>boat</b> became stranded near Langhua Reef in the Paracel Islands; {{the occupants}} were rescued by a rescue ship {{operated by the}} Hainan Maritime Bureau, though five were flown to hospitals for medical treatment. A total of 140sheds on the islands of Yongxing, Yayong, Zhaoshu, and Bei Dao were flattened by the passing typhoon, while a ship at harbor sank and five others ran aground. On the Qilian Yu island sub-group, 98fishermen on the islands were rescued by the Nanhai Rescue Bureau following days without clean water and food supplies. Utor had destroyed all of the islands' bunkhouses, resulting in requests for rescue.|$|E
5|$|The first St. John's dog {{was said}} to be brought to England in or around 1820, but the breed's {{reputation}} had already spread to England; there is a story that the 2nd Earl of Malmesbury saw a St. John's dog on <b>a</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>boat</b> and immediately made arrangements with traders to have some of these dogs imported to England. These ancestors of the first labradors so impressed the Earl with their skill and ability for retrieving anything within the water and on shore that he devoted his entire kennel to developing and stabilising the breed.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Dottie was {{the ninth}} {{tropical}} cyclone and fourth named storm of the 1976 Atlantic hurricane season. The precursor to Dottie {{formed in the}} Gulf of Mexico on August 17 and organized into a tropical depression on August 18. The storm drifted towards the east, and, after peaking as a moderate tropical storm, it accelerated northeastward and made landfall on Florida. Upon re-emerging in the Atlantic, Dottie turned northward and moved ashore near Charleston, South Carolina. Damage from the storm was primarily insignificant and limited to gusty winds, heavy rainfall, and high tides; however, <b>a</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>boat</b> capsized in the Bahamas, resulting {{in the deaths of}} four people.|$|E
5|$|Additional Jaeger pilots include Charles Luu, Lance Luu and Mark Luu as the Wei Tang {{triplets}} (China), and Robert Maillet and Heather Doerksen as Sasha and Aleksis Kaidanovsky (Russia). Joe Pingue portrays Captain Merrit, {{the captain}} of <b>a</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>boat</b> caught in a battle between Jaeger and Kaiju. Santiago Segura plays an aide to Hannibal Chau. Brad William Henke and Larry Joe Campbell portray members of a construction team Raleigh joins after retiring from the Pan Pacific Defense Corps. Robin Thomas, Julian Barnes, and David Richmond-Peck portray U.N. representatives from the United States, Great Britain, and Canada, respectively. Sebastian Pigott appears as a Jaeger engineer and Joshua Peace appears as an officer, Jonathan Foxon appears as a frantic civilian. David Fox plays an old man on a beach, while Jane Watson portrays Raleigh and Yancy's mother in a flashback sequence. Producer Thomas Tull makes a cameo appearance.|$|E
5|$|Low's tactics {{consisted}} {{primarily of}} hoisting false colours and approaching an unsuspecting vessel. Off {{the coast of}} St John's, Newfoundland, Low mistook a fully armed man-of-war for <b>a</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>boat,</b> and barely escaped. He moved on to Conception Bay, capturing a number of boats around the Grand Banks southeast of Newfoundland before crossing the Atlantic to the Azores. There, he captured a French (or Portuguese—sources differ) pink, a narrow-sterned former man of war, which Low rearmed and refitted as his new flagship, naming it the Rose Pink. He also captured an English vessel with two Portuguese passengers aboard. Low had his crew hoist them up and drop them back down from the yard arm several times, until they died. He {{moved on to the}} Canaries, Cape Verde and then back across to the coast of Brazil, where he was driven back by foul weather.|$|E

5|$|Low, still captaining the Fancy, sailed north. He {{captured}} a whaling vessel 80miles (130km) out at sea, {{and in a}} foul mood following the encounter with the Greyhound {{and the loss of}} Harris, tortured the captain before shooting him through the head. He set the whaler's crew adrift with no provisions, intending them to starve to death. They were lucky, and reached Nantucket, Massachusetts, after a difficult journey. Remaining off the coast of North America, Low's crew took <b>a</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>boat</b> near Block Island. Low decapitated the ship's master, and sent the crew ashore. When he captured two more fishing boats near Rhode Island, his actions became so savage his crew refused to carry out his orders to torture the fishermen.|$|E
5|$|Near Boston, Massachusetts, a 25‑year‑old man was {{reported}} missing in the Ipswich River north of Cape Ann after a motorboat capsized in the rough surf; two other occupants including an infant were rescued. Elsewhere in the state, two deaths were reported, {{both of which were}} related to rough surf. The United States Coast Guard rescued two surfers in New Hampshire, while looking for a swimmer who {{was reported}} missing earlier. In Tenants Harbor, Maine, a 19‑year‑old woman drowned after slipping off a rock shoreline. Two men who were with her tried to rescue the woman but to no avail as the rough seas overpowered them. The men themselves were later rescued by the crew of <b>a</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>boat.</b> Overall, Gabrielle caused eight fatalities along the East Coast of the United States.|$|E
5|$|This war also {{proceeded}} disastrously for the Stadtholder's forces, and in {{the severe}} winter of 1794/95 a French army under general Charles Pichegru, with a Dutch contingent under general Herman Willem Daendels, crossed the great frozen rivers that traditionally protected the Netherlands from invasion. Aided {{by the fact that}} a substantial proportion of the Dutch population looked favorably upon the French incursion, and often considered it a liberation, the French were quickly able to break the resistance of the forces of the Stadtholder, and his Austrian and British allies. However, in many cities revolution broke out even before the French arrived and Revolutionary Committees took over the city governments, and (provisionally) the national government also. William was forced to flee to England on <b>a</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>boat</b> on 18 January 1795.|$|E

5|$|Along the Kanto Plain near Tokyo, Thad wrecked 22houses, damaged 31 bridges, damaged {{roads in}} 145places, and flooded 27rivers. According to police reports, five {{individuals}} drowned and six others were initially reported missing in Suzaka, because of flooding {{from the nearby}} Ayu River that crushed houses along the bank. In Akita, <b>a</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>boat</b> with nine people aboard was capsized by strong winds; all nine were rendered as missing by police. Elsewhere, one person {{was killed by a}} falling tree and a fisherman drowned when his boat overturned. In the Ibaraki Province, just north of Tokyo, officials ordered the evacuation of 5,000dwellings in the city of Ryugasaki, 2,500 of which were flooded. After the nearby Kogai River threatened to overflow their banks, over 1,000families were evacuated. Another 4,000families were evacuated in Fujishiro, though by August25, the majority of the evacuated had returned to their homes. In the island of Hokkaido, air service was suspended; damage was severe in the area. However, the capital city of Tokyo avoided the worst of the storm. In all, Thad was considered the worst storm to strike the nation in two years.|$|E
5|$|Offshore the Arabian Peninsula, the cyclone {{produced}} rough {{waves that}} disabled an oil tanker; {{the crew was}} rescued by the Omani Coast Guard after being stranded for a few days. <b>A</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>boat</b> was damaged after being washed ashore near Ras Madrakah, killing {{one person in the}} crew of nine. Near where the storm moved ashore, the storm's strong winds heavily damaged the village of Ras Madrakah. Considered the worst storm in memory, the cyclone wrecked workshops and buildings, including damaging the roof of the desalination plant, leaving residents without water for several days. Strong winds of over 93km/h (58mph) knocked down 20trees in Rima that were planted to provide shade for government buildings. Across the storm's track through Oman, the rains replenished water levels in aquifers, while also washing out roads and isolating villages. This lack of transportation prevented prompt repair work. The Jiddat al-Harasis desert was flooded for over a month due to the storm, killing two people due to drowning in Al-Ghubra. The floods provided grazing for the endangered oryx population, although many livestock were killed. Three airports in the country were closed due to floods up to four days.|$|E
5|$|Theobald {{was back}} in Paris in May 1147 {{to meet with the}} new pope, Eugene III; among the issues {{probably}} discussed was Theobald's dispute with Bernard of St David's. Relations at this time between Theobald and Stephen seem to have been good, but when Eugene summoned the English bishops to the Council of Rheims in April 1148 the king forbade all of them from attending except for three he nominated: Chichester, Hereford and Norwich. Despite having been specifically refused permission Theobald sneaked away in <b>a</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>boat,</b> presumably accompanied by Gilbert Foliot, who attended the council with him. Theobald had a number of reasons for defying the king: chiefly his obedience to the pope's order commanding his attendance, but also to keep the papacy from favouring the newly elected Archbishop of York, Henry Murdac, in the disputes between York and Canterbury. Murdac was known to be close to his fellow Cistercian Eugene.|$|E
