40|$|Agriculture {{and food}} {{security}} are key sectors for intervention under climate change. Agricultural production is highly vulnerable even to 2 C (low-end) predictions for global mean temperatures in 2100, with major implications for rural poverty and for both {{rural and urban}} food security. Agriculture also presents untapped opportunities for mitigation, given the large land <b>area</b> <b>under</b> <b>crops</b> and rangeland, and the additional mitigation potential of aquaculture. This paper presents a summary of current knowledge on options to support farmers, particularly smallholder farmers, in achieving food security through agriculture under climate change. Actions towards adaptation fall into two broad overlapping areas: (1) accelerated adaptation to progressive climate change over decadal time scales, for example integrated packages of technology, agronomy and policy options for farmers and food systems, and (2) better management of agricultural risks associated with increasing climate variability and extreme events, for example improved climate information services and safety nets. Maximization of agriculture’s mitigation potential will require investments in technological innovation and agricultural intensification linked to increased efficiency of inputs, and creation of incentives and monitoring systems that are inclusive of smallholder farmers. Food systems faced with climate change need urgent, broad-based action in spite of uncertainties...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1997 The overall {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate biomass production and soil ameliorative potential of alley farming in sub-humid India. Effect of the cutting height (40, 80, 120, 160 cm) of Leucaena hedges and root barriers on biomass yield of Leucaena and maize and wheat crops were examined. Trees were pruned at sowing of crops and pruned biomass recycled as surface mulch at the rate of 0, 1. 5, 3, 4. 5 and 6 Mg ha⁻¹ twice every year. Biomass production from the trees increased with increasing cutting height up to 120 cm without any substantial reduction in the crop yields. Root barriers had little effect on trees, no effect on maize, but significantly increased wheat grain and straw yield near the trees indicating competitive below ground interaction between Leucaena and wheat. Some alteration in pruning timing may help to minimize tree-crop competition. Crop yields sharply increased with increasing mulch levels when compared on a net-cropped-area basis. However, growing of higher levels of mulch material rapidly reduced <b>area</b> <b>under</b> <b>crops.</b> When adjusted for loss in crop area, a reduction in the grain production was estimated with increasing mulch levels.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of organizational and economic activities, {{the most important}} of which is the mechanism of state support, is ensured by high efficiency of land use while maintaining soil fertility. In order to adapt to the requirements of the WTO, the order of distribution and the provision of subsidies to decoupled support to farmers in crop production (per hectare subsidies) was introduced in Russia since the beginning of 2013. These payments are directed to the compensation of the costs for the purchase of fertilizers and plant protection chemicals, financing measures to improve soil fertility and soil quality. The order of per hectare subsidies to farmers in specific subject of the Russian Federation is fixed on regional legislative level. In addition, each region has the right to establish its own criteria for budget allocation. The main conditions of the subsidy per hectare in the Krasnodar region are sown <b>area</b> <b>under</b> <b>crops,</b> the area sown to perennial grasses, and the area on which organic fertilizers have ever been put. This approach will contribute to the unjustified expansion of acreage by land users in the conditions of extensive production in violation of the science-based zonal technologies of field crops cultivation and, consequently, a violation of the process of soil fertility reproduction. In order to overcome the problem, the regional criteria for granting per hectare subsidies are specified in the article.

40|$|The issues being {{addressed}} in this paper are as follows. Has there been significant change in cost of groundwater pumping due to diesel price shock in regions where it matters? If so, how that has impacted millions of irrigation water buyers? How farmers respond to increase in irrigation costs? Such responses include: how the well owning farmers change their farming enterprise, including the farming system itself; how their willingness to take risk changes, and finally, how the economic prospects of irrigated farming itself changes as a result? It is found {{that the impact of}} diesel price on irrigation cost incurred by diesel well owners is not significant. One {{reason for this is that}} the regions which are heavily dependent on diesel pumps for irrigation have shallow groundwater table. Also, this burden is not passed on to the water buyers owing to increasing competition and reducing monopoly power of pump owners. The analysis of the farming enterprise of irrigators under differential cost (irrigation) regimes presented here shows that farmers would be able to cope with very high rise in irrigation costs through irrigation efficiency improvements and allocating more <b>area</b> <b>under</b> <b>crops</b> that give higher returns per unit of land and water, that enhance the farming returns from every unit of water and energy used. By doing this, they are able to maintain almost the same net returns from farming as in the past.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Photovoltaic (solar) cells (Corkish, 2004) are {{semiconductor}} devices that directly create electric current and voltage {{from the collection}} of photons (quanta of light). They convert sunlight to electricity silently and without moving parts, require little maintenance, are reliable, being sold with warranties of up to twenty-five years, generate no greenhouse gases in operation and are modular, rapidly deployable and particularly suited to urban rooftops, façades and similar applications. Hence, they are easily located close to where electricity is consumed. Solar cells of 15 % efficiency covering an area equivalent to just 0. 25 % of the global <b>area</b> <b>under</b> <b>crops</b> and permanent pasture could meet all the world's primary energy requirements today (Archer and Hill, 2001), yet most or all of that area could be otherwise alienated land, such as on buildings, for example. "On any given day, the solar energy falling on a typical oilfield in the Middle East is far greater than the energy contained in the oil extracted from it. " (CarbonFree, 2006). However, solar cells remain an expensive option for most power generation requirements relative to fossil and nuclear sources, especially if the natural environment is attributed little or no value, and to some other sustainable options such as the enhancement energy efficiency, solar thermal (eg. solar water heating) or wind energy. Photovoltaics are synergistic with efficiency enhancement and solar thermal use and are usually more easily applied in urban situations than are wind turbines. Here, we aim to acquaint practising architects, builders and engineers with the fundamentals of solar photovoltaic energy production and devices and building-related applications (Green, 1995, Wenham et al., 2006, Prasad & Snow, 2005, Strong et al., 2005, Sick, 1996) ...|$|E

For this purpose, the area of agronomy and horticulture crops was obtained for the years of 2001 to 2010. Water requirement of these crops was extracted from the water national document. Working hours of wells for every months would be calculated by deviding gross irrigation requirement to average hydromodul of three maximum months. The calculations to assess the effect of sowing pattern was done separately in two phases, for all crops pattern and for major crops pattern.

40|$|Growth in the {{agriculture}} sector {{may well be}} judged by the increase in agricultural production over time. In economic terms, relative changes in prices of different crops also may effect substitution. In the Indian context, rice, wheat, maize, millets and pulses are the major food crops. Oilseeds, sugarcane, cotton, jute & mesta, and potatoes are the major cash crops. Tobacco, chillies, ginger, onion, turmeric, tapioca, sweat potatoes, etc. are minor cash crops. Among plantation crops tea, coffee and rubber are important. We observe that cereals and pulses occupy about 3 / 4 th of the gross area under cultivation. A clear trend in an increase in the percentage area under the cash crops is discernible. Plantation crops occupy a very small percentage (less than 1 %) of the total <b>area</b> <b>under</b> <b>crops.</b> Among the food crops, area under wheat has the highest growth rate followed by maize, rice and pulses in that order. The growth rate of area under millets is negative. Among the major cash crops, area under potatoes has grown fastest, followed by oilseeds, sugarcane, cotton and jute in that order. Among the food crops, wheat exhibited the highest growth rate of yield per hectare. Maize followed wheat. These two crops experienced over three fold increase in the yield rate. Rice experienced a little less than three fold increase in the yield rate. Millets and pulses also showed about 30 - 35 percent increase in the yield rate. Introduction of high yielding varieties in wheat, maize and rice coupled with an improved irrigation facilities led to the said spectacular increase in the yield rates of these crops. Among the major cash crops, cotton, sugarcane and jute exhibited two-fold increase in their yield rates.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} the relative profitability of certified organic and conventional farming operations in tropical Africa {{as well as}} differences between organic and conventional farmers in rates of adoption of farming practices and in household factor endowments. The paper is based on three surveys in Uganda of smallholder farmers of respectively, organic coffee, cocoa, and pineapple and of matching control groups of conventional farmers. Organic production was in all cases organised on a contract farming-type basis, in schemes operated by the firm exporting the organic product. The central conclusion from the study is that farms that engaged in certified organic export production were significantly more profitable in terms of net farm income earnings than those that engaged only in conventional production. This {{was the result of}} generally significant differences between organic and conventional farmers 2 ̆ 019 gross farm incomes, although these differences were further amplified by differences in costs. Income differences related partly to differences between organic and conventional farmers 2 ̆ 019 factor endowments. Preliminary analyses indicted that, among factor endowments, <b>area</b> <b>under</b> <b>crops</b> subject to organic certification (CSC) and numbers of CSC plants had the strongest relations to farmers 2 ̆ 019 sales volume and incomes,. Labour availability and average age of CSC plants had a much lower level of importance. As for other factors, yields were strongly related to sales volumes, but average price received was of lesser importance. The precise relative contribution of these different factors to sales volumes and incomes remains to be established in a further paper, however. The results for average net income also show enormous differences in profitability between organic farmers of different cash crops, with pineapple farmers earning three and five times more than cocoa and coffee farmers, respectively. It is worth underlining that, in contrast to the experience in developed countries, we found that organic conversion in tropical Africa is associated with increases rather than reductions in yield, which relates to the low-input characteristics of conventional farming on the continent. Focus group interviews suggest that organic farmers enjoyed higher yields due to more effective farm management technique, but the survey results on rates of adoption of yield-enhancing farming practices could not verify this...|$|E

Analysis was done to evaluate the utilization and productivity of agricultural factor inputs, calculate and simulate soil erosion rates using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) techniques in Nyota Ward of Chiweshe Communal Land, Zimbabwe and Balley Hooley Farm, Glendale, Zimbabwe. Results from the two areas were used for comparing factor use efficiency and respective rates of land degradation through soil erosion in the two agricultural systems. Crop production figures, crop market prices, variable and fixed costs of production were obtained from Zimbabwe Government publications. These figures were used to calculate rates of return to labor and capital for each of the systems under study. Land use classes of the area delineated from aerial photographs were digitized into an Arc/Info GIS. This was used to determine the <b>area</b> <b>under</b> <b>crops</b> and grazing. Range forage production figures in kilograms per hectare for the area were obtained from Agricultural Technical and Extension Services inventories. These were manipulated using the Grazing Land Applications 2. 0. 1 software package to calculate a Data on soil particulate composition, rainfall energy and vegetation cover were collected from a survey of the area. Relief data was obtained from orthophotos of the area. This information was digitized into the Arc/Info GIS and used for the calibration of Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) and Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (MUSLE) which were both used to predict soil erosion and sediment yield rates. Results from this analysis show higher returns to labor and capital on the commercial fan-n than the communal area. Maize was the only crop that yielded positive returns to labor and capital in the communal area. Returns to land and labor were positive for all crops grown on Balley Hooley farm. Soil erosion figures for the communal area have a higher mean than the commercial farm. Livestock grazing levels in the communal farming were higher than ecologically sound grazing capacity.

40|$|Over the centuries, {{farmers in}} the tropics have survived through good and bad years, in balance with the environment. But today {{population}} pressure on the land precludes practices that enable the environment to recover from extensive cropping systems. As a result the forests are dying, the soil is disappearing, the desert is spreading. Destruction of natural resources - the soil and vegetation cover - due to constant clearance of new ground {{as a result of}} exponential population growth, destroys the balance of the environment and mortgages the means of future production. The productivity of the land, both in terms of yields and of the intensity of cultivation, must be improved. But this raises a fundamental question. What are the effects on the environment of intensive agricultural practices? Does agricultural intensification adversely affect the environment or is it a means of preserving it? What are the ultimate consequences of non-intensification? Should we intensify agriculture in the tropics or not? Can one compare the situation in the Third World to that in the industrialized countries where large quantities of agrochemicals are regularly used to produce uneconomic surpluses? Shifting cultivation has in the past, allowed the population of tropical countries to maintain a balance between their needs and the resources of the natural environment. In the course of its history, traditional agriculture has evolved gradually over centuries in a stable human environment. Such conditions no longer exist. As V Drachoussoff underlined, (1) 'one should not overestimate the ability of traditional agricultural systems to evolve. They can adapt to rapid but slight changes, or to those that are profound but slow. But change is now both rapid and profound (for example, in a population with a high growth rate and galloping urbanization), and these systems cannot support traditional cultural practices and conserve the soil, water and vegetation resources. ' Is it better to build a dam or use chemical fertilizers, and deal with their drawbacks, rather than to pillage the last forests to gain a few thousand hectares of new land thus passing on the problem to the future generations? All these questions arise from a central preoccupation: how can developing populations avoid a terrible dilemma - to eat today at the risk of dying tomorrow or to make sacrifices and preserve the future? Is the development of food production compatible with the protection of the environment? Water, fertilizers, agrochemicals and mechanization are among the most important elements of modern agriculture. Most would agree that their intensive use has consequences for the quality of the environment. It is therefore important to review the impact of agricultural intensification in the tropics. Water: large or small-scale projects The example of the irrigated area of Gezira in the Sudan demonstrates the problems, even today, of large-scale irrigation schemes with major infrastructure requirements. The Gezira is the oldest and, at present, the largest irrigated area in Africa. During the last 12 years, yields of cotton have fluctuated around half a tonne per hectare and cereal yields have remained between one, and one-and-a-half tonnes per hectare. These can hardly be considered high yields in irrigated agriculture. However, since the rainfall of the region rarely reaches 400 mm per year, and in some years an almost complete absence of rain precludes any harvest, it must be recognized that the Gezira scheme has provided, for almost half a century, subsistence for an environmentally underprivileged population. It is a fact that the large quantities of insecticides required to grow cotton cause pollution of soil and water. Thirty million dollars' worth of insecticides and six million dollars' worth of herbicides are used each year and their effects are felt by the population. It is clear that projects of this size can be damaging to the environment and this should be taken into consideration at the decision-making and planning stage. On the other hand, small-scale irrigation in the Sahel consists of many small developments fed by pumped ground-water. Successes have been achieved: in addition to providing water for the people these developments have permitted profitable agricultural activities, such as fruit growing and market gardens, tree nurseries and construction of watering points for livestock. In short, these schemes have been instrumental in rational development of the region. The effect of such developments on the environment is, at first sight, very positive. But the ill-considered use of ground water is not without consequence for future supplies of water. The increase in boreholes, has, unfortunately, resulted in chaotic management of the grazing areas with profound effects on the environment. Plant cover has been considerably impoverished, disappearing in many places over large areas around watering points and leading to wind erosion. Boreholes, combined with improved veterinary services have led to a rapid increase in livestock numbers. The herds are then forced to move south where the same practices which originally led to desertification in their countries of origin are repeated. It should be noted that, during the past ten years, remarkable successes have been obtained with a number of small-scale schemes entirely managed by the farmers themselves. (1) Spectacular results, with rice yields exceeding 10 tonnes per hectare in two growing seasons each year, have been recorded. These yields, which show the real potential of irrigation, should be compared with the yields from traditional cereal crops (millet and sorghum) which on average do not reach a half tonne per hectare. (2) Small-scale irrigation schemes in Madagascar have led to greatly increased productivity in traditional rice paddies, thanks to better water management in harmony with the social and ecological environment. Agrochemicals The industrialized countries use large quantities of chemical fertilizers and often optimum application rates have been exceeded. Furthermore, optimum rates of application from an economic standpoint do not correspond to those required to maintain the balance of the environment. In the African context, however, if lack of purchasing power has averted the drawbacks of overuse of fertilizers, it has also denied the continent the benefits of their rational use. In tropical countries, improved soil productivity resulting from fertilizer use has other advantages: increased biomass, better soil cover and, consequently, reduced risk of erosion and better preservation of soil organic matter derived from leaves and roots. Considering that agricultural losses due to pests amount to 30 % of production, it is clear that pest control is essential, including the use of chemical products. But chemical pesticides have their drawbacks. They are expensive, dangerous to store and have a limited shelf-life. If used unwisely they are also hazardous to the environment. Experience has shown the dangers of accumulation of toxic residues both for humans and for the environment. Integrated pest control offers encouraging prospects for methods of crop protection that are less likely to alter the natural environment. These methods integrate chemical control with cultural practices, plant breeding and biological control. In view of me limits of intensive chemical control {{as well as those of}} biological control alone, integrated pest management rests on a thorough understanding of the interactions between pests, plants and beneficial organisms. Mechanization In Africa, whereas 80 % of the population is involved in agriculture, food production levels remain inadequate. Therefore the profitability of labour must be improved. Agricultural mechanization has considerable prospects in this field so long as it is managed efficiently. Care must be taken not to leave fields badly cleared, insufficiently ploughed, and without protection against erosion or without restoration of organic matter. Mechanization should aim at maximizing the use of arable land, promoting the use of other production factors and it should lead to the improvement of crop performance. In regions with livestock, draught power is undoubtedly the type of mechanization most widely available and with the least financial risk since it requires a small investment and a minimum of family labour. Use of draught animals is, with penning of livestock for manure production, one of the best ways of integrating livestock and crop production. These two aspects of agriculture can be complementary rather than competitive. However, draught power has its limitations. It is difficult to implement in farming communities with no livestock tradition and it is limited by animal diseases. On its own it does not allow the mechanization of all cropping practices. Productivity levels are only modest. Mechanization with tractors helps to alleviate problems due to labour shortage when the interval between harvesting and planting of another crop is very short. This method can be highly profitable by increasing the number of harvests per cycle and when rainfall is poor, it makes it possible to use the whole area available. Perhaps the greatest advantage of tractorization is that it enables farmers to extend the <b>area</b> <b>under</b> <b>crops</b> where a lot of land is available or where it is too difficult to cultivate by hand or draught power because of compacted soi 1. The consequences of agricultural intensification for the environment were examined during a one-day meeting in Brussels in June 1990, which was organized jointly by the Academie Royale des Sciences d'Outre-Mer de Belgique and CTA. The main conclusions reached were: - that agricultural intensification leads to economies in land use which are indispensable if the environment is to be saved and restored, and - that there would be no point in protecting the environment by intensive crop practices if these practices lead to other forms of environmental deterioration. The experience of the industrialized countries shows that over-intensification is as harmful to the quality of life and the environment as excessive population growth combined with extensive farming in developing countries. There are no miraculous solutions to agricultural problems. But there is a range of methods that research workers can offer to farmers. However, the excessive use of one method over another, can lead to imbalances and result in the deterioration of the environment. In fact, each of these methods represents a single stone within a whole building and good agriculture requires proper integration of each method with all the other production factors. Good agriculture leads to an increase in production and thus, to economical land-use. It results therefore in the conservation of the natural heritage and safe-guarding the future. Like industrialized countries, developing countries undeniably have the right to agricultural intensification. In the present population context, it is a right to survival. One can only hope that they will not commit excesses that will in turn jeopardize their future. Intensification is of course expensive. 'I'd rather fell some trees than buy fertilizers' said an African; but intensification can be a profitable investment. Nowadays, the disastrous consequences of extensive farming, linked to overpopulation, in the tropical world are evident. In many industrialized countries, it is easy to foresee the even more disastrous consequences of the excesses of intensive commercial agriculture. Faced with problems that can already be identified, if the new farmers of the Third World repeat the same errors, they will be responsible for mortgaging their future for ever.

This means that every 1 % increase in rice output increased agricultural GDP by 3.84 %. Our results, according to Anyanwu (2010), show {{a positive relationship between}} rice crop output and agricultural GDP. Further, the coefficient of the <b>area</b> <b>under</b> rice <b>crop</b> production is also highly significant at both the 1 % and 5 % of significance levels, indicating a significant and positive relationship between the <b>area</b> <b>under</b> rice production and agricultural GDP. This implies that every 1 % increase in <b>area</b> <b>under</b> rice <b>crop</b> production leads to a 0.10 % increase in agricultural GDP. Moreover, the results indicate a negative relationship between water availability and agricultural GDP. In Pakistan, agricultural productivity is much lower compared to developed countries due to low water availability.|$|R

Horticulture {{has been one of the}} fastest growing sectors within the larger agriculture activities in India, and the State of Karnataka is at the forefront in this context. With the help of secondary data and by employing Simpson’s Diversification Index, crop diversification toward horticulture across the districts of Karnataka was explored. Using regression growth trends, the districts have been categorized as high, medium, low, and negative growth trend of horticulture crop area, and the districts have been further regrouped according to their agro-climatic zones. The study found that the districts of Gulbarga, Raichur, Bijapur, Bidar, Koppal, Bagalkot, and Bellary showed a complete diversification toward horticulture crops, whereas the districts of Kolar, Udupi, and Dakshina Kannada were found to be diversified the least. The study also explored that the districts having complete diversification toward horticulture sector were found to have devoted a lesser share of their cultivable <b>area</b> <b>under</b> horticulture <b>crops.</b> Also, most of the highly diversified districts have come under the dry agro-climatic zones and experienced a high growth rate of horticulture crops cultivation from triennium ending (TE) 2002 - 2003 to TE 2009 - 2010.
