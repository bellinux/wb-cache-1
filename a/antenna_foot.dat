The next challenge is to use shorter sub-second integration times in combination with interferometric programmes to resolve spatial structure within the main radar beam, and so relate enhanced filaments to individual auroral rays. This paper presents initial studies of a technique, using optical and spectral satellite signatures, to calibrate the received phase of a signal with the position of the scattering source along the interferometric baseline of the EISCAT Svalbard Radar. It is shown that a consistent relationship can be found only if the satellite passage through the phase fringes is adjusted from the passage predicted by optical tracking. This required adjustment is interpreted as being due to the vector between the theoretical focusing points of the two antennae, i. e. the true radar baseline, differing from the baseline obtained by survey between the <b>antenna</b> <b>foot</b> points. A method to obtain a measurement of the true interferometric baseline using multiple satellite passes is outlined...|$|E
40|$|Background and Objectives: {{with the}} {{developments}} of technology, contact with various frequencies of electromagnetic fields (EMF) has significantly increased, while the abundant benefits of using microwaves in routine life cannot be neglected. During recent years {{there have been}} reports of adverse effects caused by contact with electric and magnetic fields of these waves that spread from BTS antennas. The {{purpose of this study is}} the measurement of microwaves spreading around BTS antennas in Tehran. Materials and Methods:  according to the location of BTS antennas in Tehran, power density of electromagnetic waves around 63 antennas in near and distant fields in different distances was measured. The measurements were performed using the standard method of IEEE Std C 95. 1 by Hi- 4333 device. in order to analysis data we used spss 16 and descriptive and deductive statistical tests. Results: results of this study show that in the near field, with increase of distance from the foot of antenna, the average power density of electromagnetic waves increase in a way that in the distance of 10 meters from the <b>antenna</b> <b>foot,</b> the increase of average power density is hardly conceivable and from 10 to 15 meters distance is perfectly noticeable. But in the distant field, with increase of distance from 20 meters, the average power density of the electromagnetic waves decreases; and from 100 meter and further, the gradient of the diagram will get almost linear and the rate of power density reaches the base limit in a way that with the increase of distance there would be no significant decrease. Conclusion: All the measures of power density of electromagnetic waves caused by BTSs are about 0. 06 % of recommended measures of environmental standards and 0. 0000013 % of occupational standards. The results of this study are close to the results of other studies...|$|E

Volatile pheromones are characterized as sex pheromones or defensive pheromones and usually form a specific odor and are focused on alarm sensitivity.
