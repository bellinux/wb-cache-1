Most of the damage worldwide is caused by <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>small</b> <b>number</b> of species, chiefly rats and mice. In Indonesia and Tanzania, rodents reduce crop yields by around fifteen percent, while in some instances in South America losses have reached ninety percent.

In Asia, rats, mice and species such as Microtus brandti, Meriones unguiculatus and Eospalax baileyi damage crops of rice, sorghum, tubers, vegetables and nuts. In Europe, as well as rats and mice, species of Apodemus, Microtus and in occasional outbreaks Arvicola terrestris cause damage to orchards, vegetables and pasture as well as cereals. In South America, a wider range of rodent species, such as Holochilus, Akodon, Calomys, Oligoryzomys, Phyllotis, Sigmodon and Zygodontomys, damage many crops including sugar cane, fruits, vegetables, and tubers.|$|E
5|$|Despite the orders, <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>small</b> <b>number</b> {{of people}} {{evacuated}} for the hurricane. According to a telephone {{survey conducted by}} the United States Department of Commerce, the highest participation rate was for residents in the Northern Neck in areas potentially affected by the storm surge from a Category2 hurricane, of which 41% in the survey stated they left their houses for a safer location. In Surry, only 9% of those in a Category2 hurricane storm surge zone left. 30% who participated in the survey along the Eastern Shore left. The primary reasons for the choice whether to evacuate or not were due to the track of Isabel, its strength, or influence from the media. Most participants in the survey stated they did not hear any sort of evacuation notice from public officials in their location, however. Of those who evacuated, about 64% left for the house of a friend or a relative, with about 24% evacuating to a hotel or a motel. Most of those in Hampton and Norfolk left for elsewhere in the state, while the majority of those in the Northern Neck evacuated to destinations in their own neighborhood or community. The evacuation destinations on the Eastern Shore of Virginia were varied, with 23% leaving for Maryland and 46% staying in their own neighborhood or community. The length of the evacuation process varied between a few hours to two days, with the worst evacuation problems being closed or flooded roads. The Virginia Army National Guard and State Police troopers assisted in the evacuations. In all, more than 160,000 residents in southeastern Virginia were told to evacuate, including 11,000 in vulnerable locations along the Chesapeake Bay and all residents in mobile home parks in Chesapeake and Newport News. A total of about 16,325people evacuated to 67 shelters. Some of the reported problems were shortages of supplies, unanticipated medical issues, overcrowding, and lack of security.|$|E
40|$|International aid {{is often}} {{analysed}} {{as if it}} was a homogeneous product exclusively distributed between <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>small</b> <b>numbers</b> of public agencies. In contrast, this paper contributes to thinking about aid as a quasi-market with many different suppliers, users, channels, products and brands. More specifically, it suggests drawing a stronger distinction between development finance and development assistance. A simple graph shows how this entails distinguishing between social impact and financial sustainability. Given that these characteristics are often far from transparent, the paper also illustrates the limitations of a rational choice approach to analysing aid. The difficulties entailed in assessing aid impact and sustainability help to explain why brand reputations matter. The argument is illustrated with references to UK aid, aid to Ethiopia, and NGO promotion of smallholder linkages into agricultural value chains in Africa...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, an {{expectation}} maximization (EM) algorithm based iterative receiver is utilized in the underwater acoustic OFDM system {{to improve the}} spectrum efficiency. <b>A</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>number</b> of pilots are {{used to determine the}} initial value for the EM-based channel estimation process. The intermediate estimates of the channel state information generated by the EM algorithm are fed forward to the BCJR decoding unit to achieve the a posterior probability of the transmitted bit sequence. The a posterior probability is then fed back to the EM algorithm to estimate channel state information. The iterative receive process is expected to realize a better channel estimate and bit error rate (BER) performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the EM-based iterative underwater acoustic OFDM system has a fast convergence property, and can achieve a low mean square error (MSE) for the channel estimation and a near optimal BER performance...|$|R

Case–control, cohort studies, and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) provide an ascending hierarchy of levels of evidence (Colditz 2010). RCTs are the most rigorous design but expensive to conduct, whereas prospective cohort studies require a long-term follow up and less powerful for the population with a low incidence of the disease. Case–control studies, being retrospective in nature with <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>number</b> of participants, are suitable in resource-limited settings (Wang and Attia 2010). In particular, hospital-based case–control studies, with supporting clinical and laboratory services, are less costly and preferable than their community-based counterparts (Schlesselman and Schneiderman 1982). Therefore, a hospital-based case–control study protocol has been developed to ascertain the role of lifestyle and diet in relation to the T 2 D risk for adults in Vietnam.|$|R
40|$|Pareto {{dominance}} is {{an important}} concept and is usually used in multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) to determine the nondominated solutions. However, for many-objective problems, using Pareto dominance to rank the solutions even in the early generation, most obtained solutions are often the nondominated solutions, which results in a little selection pressure of MOEAs toward the optimal solutions. In this paper, a new ranking method is proposed for many-objective optimization problems to verify <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>number</b> of representative nondominated solutions with a uniform and wide distribution and improve the selection pressure of MOEAs.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relation}} between firms’R&D incentives and their compatibility decisions regarding durable, imperfectly substitutable network goods {{in the presence of}} forward looking consumers. Non drastic product innovation is sequential and both an initially dominant firm and a smaller rival are potential inventors. For sufficiently innovative future products, our first key result is that the dominant firm invests more when there is compatibility and voluntarily decides to supply interoperability information. This happens as the probability that he is the only inventor increases, allowing him to enjoy a higher expected future profit that outweighs the current lost revenue. For economies whose initial market size is considerably large, the rival also demands compatibility but this is no longer true in industries with <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>number</b> of existing consumers. For less innovative new versions, the dominant firm rejects compatibility and there is a cutoff in network externalities below which he invests more when there is incompatibility.
