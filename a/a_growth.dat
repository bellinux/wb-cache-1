40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{growth rates of}} {{atmospheric}} carbon dioxide and human population, by comparing {{the relative merits of}} two benchmark models, the exponential law and the finite-time-singular (FTS) power law. The later results from positive feedbacks, either direct or mediated by other dynamical variables, as shown in our presentation of a simple endogenous macroeconomic dynamical growth model. Our empirical calibrations finds that the human population has decelerated from its previous super-exponential growth until 1960 to <b>a</b> slower-than-exponential <b>growth</b> associated with <b>a</b> decreasing <b>growth</b> rate. However, the past decade is found to be characterized by <b>an</b> almost stable <b>growth</b> rate approximately equal to r(2010) ~ 1 % per year, suggesting that the population growth is stabilizing at "just" <b>an</b> exponential <b>growth.</b> <b>As</b> for atmospheric CO 2 content, we find that it is at least exponentially increasing and most likely characterized by <b>an</b> accelerating <b>growth</b> rate as off 2009, consistent with an unsustainable FTS power law regime announcing a drastic change of regime. The coexistence of <b>a</b> quasi-exponential <b>growth</b> of human population with <b>a</b> super-exponential <b>growth</b> of carbon dioxide content in the atmosphere is a diagnostic that, until now, improvements in carbon efficiency per unit of production worldwide has been dramatically insufficient.
