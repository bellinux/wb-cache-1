5|$|After {{the arrival}} of white {{settlers}} to the baytown of Hynesville in the 19th century, the Karankawa began to commit offenses against the settlers, including the unsanctioned slaughter of their livestock. As a result, the settlers engaged the Indians at the 1852 Battle of Hynes Bay, near the San Antonio Bay extension of Hynes Bay. The Karankawa were swiftly defeated, and the survivors agreed to never return; finding refuge across the Rio Grande in Tamaulipas. A few years later, the Hynes extension began to fill with mud, leaving it shallow <b>and</b> <b>hard</b> to navigate. Reports from Hynesville suggest that alligators infested the bay, killing a few residents.|$|E

5|$|An {{attack by}} sea across Lake Constance on Rheineck and Rorschach on July 21 {{was one of}} the few {{successful}} Swabian operations. The small Swiss detachment was taken by surprise, the villages plundered and burnt. A much larger attack of an army of about 16,000 soldiers in the west on Dornach, however, met a quickly assembled but strong Swiss army. In the battle of Dornach on July 22, 1499, the Swabian and mercenary troops suffered a heavy defeat after a long <b>and</b> <b>hard</b> battle. Their general Heinrich von Fürstenberg fell early in the fight, about 3,000 Swabian and 500 Swiss soldiers died, and the Swabians lost all of their artillery again.|$|E

5|$|Arnold's Marsh and {{the other}} lagoons nearest the beach are salty due to the {{percolation}} of seawater through the shingle bank.

Little whirlpool ramshorn snail {{has been found in}} a freshwater channel. Rare beetles associated with these coastal environments include yellow pogonus, Bembidion ephippium and Tachys scutellaris.
