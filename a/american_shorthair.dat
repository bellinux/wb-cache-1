500|$|The Free Collars are a group a stray cats {{who have}} removed their collars {{and refuse to}} have any {{relationship}} with humans. Cyan is a young Abyssinian who joins the Free Collars after being abandoned. He tends to be childlike, which sometimes irritates {{other members of the}} group. Scottie is a Scottish Fold who spends much of her time with the Free Collars but is not a member. She was discovered by Amesho, an old <b>American</b> <b>Shorthair</b> and leader of the Free Collars, in a bookstore. Char is a Chartreux and was once part of the [...] "Cat House Kingdom", a household of high-class cats, but left, feeling she was being used by humans. Rat is a Korat and the most talented with gadgets and technology within the group. Coon is an easily angered Maine Coon who specializes in swimming. Minky is a Tonkinese who befriends Cyan and Scottie and is named after her mink-like fur.|$|E
500|$|Jones, nicknamed [...] "Jonesy", is an <b>American</b> <b>Shorthair</b> {{who is the}} rodent-control ship's cat on the Nostromo. After {{the birth}} and escape of the Alien, Jones is {{detected}} by the crew and risks interfering with the ship's motion sensors (which could mistake the cat's movements for those of the Alien). Brett finds Jones in the cargo room, where the Alien kills Brett as Jones watches. When the remaining crew members prepare to escape the ship, Ripley loads Jones into a pet carrier but must temporarily abandon him as the Alien approaches her. The Alien inspects Jones but leaves him alone, since the cat poses no threat. Ripley retrieves Jones and flees {{with him on a}} shuttle. She and the cat are in cryosleep for fifty-seven years, until they are rescued. Jones remains Ripley's pet for the duration of her new employment until she departs on the Sulaco, leaving him behind. Four cats were used in Alien, with each exhibiting specific feline behaviors such as scampering and hissing. According to Ridley Scott's audio commentary on the Alien DVD, to capture Jones' fearful reaction to the Alien a screen was placed between the cat and a German Shepherd; when the screen between the animals was removed, the cat immediately hissed.|$|E

50|$|The Ocicat is an all-domestic {{breed of}} cat which resembles a wild cat {{but has no}} wild DNA in its gene pool. The breed is unusual {{in that it is}} spotted like a wild cat but has the {{temperament}} of a domestic animal. It is named for its resemblance to the Ocelot. The breed was established from Siamese and Abyssinian stock; later, <b>American</b> <b>Shorthairs</b> (silver tabbies) were added to the mix and gave the breed their silver color, bone structure and distinct markings.|$|R

50|$|According to the CFA, <b>American</b> <b>Shorthairs</b> are low-maintenance cats {{that are}} {{generally}} healthy, easy-going, affectionate with owners and social with strangers. Males are significantly larger than females, weighing eleven to fifteen pounds when fully grown. Mature females weigh six to twelve pounds when they achieve full growth at {{three to four}} years of age. With a quality diet and plenty of attention, love, and care, they can live 15 years or longer, requiring annual vaccinations and veterinary checkups. These cats have solidly built, powerful, and muscular bodies with well-developed shoulders, chests, and hindquarters.|$|R

5000|$|In the 1960s, a cat, {{owned by}} Siamese cat breeder Dorothy Hinds-Daugherty, {{produced}} {{a litter of}} Siamese kittens in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Three of the kittens had unique markings, consisting of white points and feet. Intrigued by their looks, she began working to breed cats like them, using seal point Siamese with bicolor <b>American</b> <b>Shorthairs.</b> The offspring of those cats lacked the Siamese points, but by breeding the offspring to Siamese cats, the desired look was accomplished. Hinds-Daugherty named the breed [...] "Snowshoe" [...] because of their white feet. Hinds-Daugherty promoted the Snowshoe at local cats shows, though they were not recognized at the time. Hinds-Daughtery eventually abandoned the Snowshoe breeding program, and it was taken up by Vikki Olander.|$|R

The crossbreed look gained {{recognition}} in the show ring, but unhappy <b>American</b> <b>Shorthair</b> breeders successfully produced a new breed standard that would disqualify ASH that showed signs of crossbreeding. One ASH breeder who saw the potential of the Persian/ASH cross proposed and eventually managed to get the Cat Fanciers' Association judge and <b>American</b> <b>Shorthair</b> breeder Jane Martinke to recognize them as a new breed in 1966, under the name Exotic Shorthair. Since 1987, the CFA closed the Exotic to shorthair outcrosses, leaving Persian as the only allowable outcross breed.|$|E

5000|$|American Wirehairs {{are similar}} to <b>American</b> <b>Shorthairs,</b> with the {{exception}} of a springy, wiry coat, including ear fur, and whiskers. [...] This coat is similar to the wire coats of some dog breeds, such as terriers. Their fur requires little grooming, although lighter cats may require sunblock. Wirehairs are of a moderate, sturdy build, with round heads, high cheekbones, and a pronounced muzzle. [...] Females are generally smaller than males. American Wirehairs display the full spectrum of possible cat coat colors, although Himalayan, Chocolate and Lilac are not accepted for competition. The Wirehair coat trait is dominant, so any breeding between a Wirehair and another cat can produce wired kittens. Wirehairs have golden eyes, except for some white ones that have blue or amber eyes.|$|R

5000|$|The Snowshoe {{is a rare}} breed, {{partly due}} to the {{difficulty}} of breeding cats with markings and patterns that conform well to breed standards. The Snowshoe's pattern relies on recessive genes and other factors to produce desired results. One gene, which causes the [...] "V" [...] facial pattern is an example of incomplete dominance. If the offspring produced has two dominant genes for the marking, then the feature will be larger than a cat with one dominant gene. However, other factors may influence the feature, which makes it difficult to predict the outcome. Another issue is the white boots, which can be caused by a piebalding gene or a gloving gene. The genes are difficult to control, and many cats' boots extend too far up the leg, do not reach far enough up the leg, or the cat completely lacks white. As such, pet-quality Snowshoes usually have too much white, too little white, or white features are mismarked. The cats' body type further complicates breeding, as the breeder must achieve the correct head shape and ear set, while still maintaining the <b>American</b> <b>Shorthair's</b> body structure and the length of the Siamese.|$|R

40|$|There are few {{reports of}} {{naturally}} occurring muscular dystrophy in domestic animals.

Macroscopic muscular hypertrophy and histologic evidence of myofiber size variation, mineralization, myofiber degeneration, and necrosis were compatible with a diagnosis of muscular dystrophy. Extensive endomysial fibrosis was noted histologically in the diaphragm. A complete absence of dystrophin protein in Western blot confirmed the diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed reduced levels of dystrophin-associated proteins and an upregulation of utrophin at the sarcolemma. Anesthetic deaths can occur in dystrophin-deficient cats, and therefore muscular dystrophy and the associated cardiomyopathy {{should be considered in}} the differential diagnoses for perianesthetic death in cats...|$|R

A geriatric, male castrate, <b>American</b> Domestic <b>Shorthair</b> cat {{was presented}} to Cornell University Hospital for Animals (CUHA) for evaluation of an eccrine adenocarcinoma involving the right metacarpal pad. Bleeding associated with the right front paw was first noticed by the owners in August of 2003. The cat presented to the referring veterinarian on August 26 th 2003, at which time an ulcerated mass was noted on the right metacarpal pad. An incisional biopsy was obtained, and histopathologic assessment was consistent with an eccrine adenocarcinoma. Two-view thoracic radiographs were unremarkable. A complete blood count, chemistry panel, and urinalysis were performed. The chemistry panel revealed renal parameters at {{the upper end of}} normal [creatinine = 2. 0 mg/dL (0. 7 - 2. 1 mg/dL), BUN = 33. 1 mg/dL (17 - 35 mg/dL), phosphate = 13. 3 mg/dL (3. 0 - 6. 6 mg/dL) ]. Urine specific gravity was > 1. 045, and occasional cocci were seen in urinary sediment. The cat was treated with enrofloxacin for the urinary tract infection. On presentation to the Oncology Service at the CUHA, the cat was quiet but alert and responsive. Physical examination confirmed an ulcerated mass associated with the right metacarpal pad that measured 1. 0 x 1. 0 x 0. 5 cm. The mass was not painful on palpation, and the cat showed no signs of lameness. Thoracic auscultation was unremarkable. Abdominal palpation revealed no abnormalities. All peripheral lymph nodes palpated normal in size and consistency. The remainder of the physical exam was unremarkable. A complete blood count, chemistry panel, and urinalysis were performed. Results showed no significant abnormalities. The two lateral thoracic referral radiographs were reviewed, a third dorsoventral view was obtained, and an abdominal ultrasound was performed. No evidence of metastatic diseases was identified in either imaging modality. Slides from the initial metacarpal biopsy were reviewed by the CUHA Surgical Biopsy Service, and confirmed a sweat gland carcinoma. The described diagnostic evaluation generated a problem list that consisted of a mildly overconditioned, mildly stressed, geriatric, male castrated feline, with an ulcerated right metacarpal sweat gland carcinoma. Forelimb amputation was recommended by the CUHA Oncology Service as the primary treatment to provide local control and the best long-term prognosis. Locally aggressive resection combined with radiation therapy was suggested as an alternative treatment, but was declined by the owners due to uncertain efficacy.

5000|$|Colorpoint Shorthairs are {{a variety}} of {{domestic}} cat. Depending on the cat registry, they may be considered a separate breed of cat, or more often a variant of a pre-existing one, if accepted at all. These cats are distinguished by their conformance to wide range of sixteen different point colors, beyond the four standard Siamese colors. The variety was initially created by crossbreeding Siamese with the <b>American</b> <b>Shorthair</b> - the same mixture that created the Oriental Shorthair, but with different goals. The Colorpoint Shorthair shares the point-coloration pattern with the Siamese, but in the nontraditional colors of red, cream, tortoiseshell, and lynx (tabby) points, and minor variations thereof. In body style, head shape, and other features, it may be intermediate between the two foundation breeds, which show cats leaning toward Siamese traits. Those who favour the Traditional Siamese look may also favour the more moderate-typed Colourpoint Shorthairs that take after their <b>American</b> <b>Shorthair</b> ancestors in shape.|$|E
