60|$|Her head {{suddenly}} bobbed over sideways. She awoke, sat straight, <b>and</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> eyes. The Man from Nome was gone.|$|E
60|$|All but Tootles popped {{down their}} trees. He had {{a bow and}} arrow with him, and Tink noted it, <b>and</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> little hands.|$|E
60|$|So the farmer's wife {{shook the}} girl by the arm, and Miss Muffet {{sat up in}} the cart <b>and</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> eyes and {{wondered}} where she was.|$|E
60|$|Mara huddled against Jan, {{trembling}} <b>and</b> <b>rubbing</b> <b>her</b> bare arms.|$|R
60|$|Exit, and reappears, {{after five}} minutes, flushed, <b>and</b> <b>rubbing</b> <b>her</b> fingers.|$|R
60|$|Miss Jelks {{drew back}} <b>and,</b> <b>rubbing,</b> <b>her</b> arm, eyed him haughtily.|$|R
60|$|Miss Adams, who {{had been}} frozen into silence during the long cold night, began to thaw now in the cheery warmth of the rising sun. She looked about her, <b>and</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> thin hands together.|$|E
60|$|She {{blew her}} breath upon {{the piece of}} blue glass <b>and</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> thumb upon it. Instantly, as with a clap of thunder, the great red Genie stood before her, and the poor prime-minister sat shaking and trembling.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! I suppose {{one must}} make oneself {{moderately}} agreeable to the baser sort. They have their uses. This thing controls the dairy." [...] The Cat, pincing on her toes, came forward <b>and</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> {{head against the}} Miller's knee.|$|E
60|$|Eben {{went home}} with Bay Billy. Potter gazed after him until Mrs. Theodora ordered him to put Marshall's mare in the stable <b>and</b> <b>rub</b> <b>her</b> down.|$|R
6000|$|But Cupid with a Satyr comes; [...] Both {{softly to}} the cradle creep; Both stroke <b>her</b> hands, <b>and</b> <b>rub</b> <b>her</b> gums, [...] While the poor child lay fast asleep.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What! Fanfaronade,' {{said the}} Princess, sitting up <b>and</b> <b>rubbing</b> <b>her</b> eyes, 'is it {{possible}} that when I am here with you you can want anything else? You ought to be thinking all the time how happy you are.' ...|$|R
60|$|Alice was released, {{but she did}} not move. She {{sat with}} {{wrinkled}} forehead trying his cigarette. She blew out little tiny whiffs of smoke, and thought about it; she sent a small puff down her nostrils, <b>and</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> nose.|$|E
60|$|Trot {{stared up}} in alarm <b>and</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> eyes; Cap'n Bill {{rolled over and}} blinked, hardly remembering where he was; Button-Bright {{was on his feet}} in an instant. Advancing toward them were four of the natives of the Pink Country.|$|E
6000|$|The {{guests were}} gone; the Gilsons upstairs. Claire came running, seized Milt's sleeve, coaxed {{him to the}} {{davenport}} in the drawing-room--then sighed, <b>and</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> forehead, and looked so tired that he could say nothing but, [...] "Hope you haven't been overdoing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So it is; but I {{must do it}} a few times, or Joe will plague me and spoil my fun to-night," [...] {{answered}} Jill, shaking <b>her</b> skirts <b>and</b> <b>rubbing</b> <b>her</b> blue hands, wet {{and cold}} with the snow.|$|R
50|$|Adding to Birdee's heartache is {{her former}} {{status as the}} school queen bee and a beauty pageant winner, which alienated many of her former classmates. They also haven't {{forgotten}} Birdee's high school snobbery <b>and</b> <b>rub</b> <b>her</b> nose in her televised embarrassment.|$|R
6000|$|... "But then--I wouldn't anger you, father, {{for all the}} world; indeed I wouldn't, for {{you always}} are so good to me, and I know I don't deserve it," [...] and poor Annot {{continued}} sobbing <b>and</b> <b>rubbing</b> <b>her</b> eyes with her apron.|$|R
6000|$|Edith bent {{the same}} fixed look upon her, as she sobbed <b>and</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> eyes; {{and said in}} the same low steady voice, which had neither risen nor fallen since she first {{addressed}} her, 'I have said that Florence must go home.' ...|$|E
60|$|As we had {{arranged}} {{to say nothing}} at first, my aunt was not a little discomfited. She darted a hopeful glance at me, when I said 'Agnes'; but seeing that I looked as usual, {{she took off her}} spectacles in despair, <b>and</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> nose with them.|$|E
60|$|Christian bent {{her head}} forward <b>and</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> cheek against Greta's, then without another word ran upstairs and locked herself into her room. The child stood listening; hearing the key turn in the lock, she sank down on the bottom step and took Scruff in her arms.|$|E
50|$|Females secrete {{small amounts}} of sex pheromones, which leave a trail the males follow using their tongues and Jacobson's organs as guides. Once a {{receptive}} female has been located, the male often spends several days following her around (a behavior not common outside of the mating season), frequently touching <b>and</b> <b>rubbing</b> <b>her</b> {{in an attempt to}} stimulate her.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh a proud, hard gentleman!' chuckled the old woman, shaking <b>her</b> head, <b>and</b> <b>rubbing</b> <b>her</b> shrivelled hands, 'oh hard, hard, hard! But your worship {{shall see}} {{with your own}} eyes and hear with your own ears; not with ours--and if your worship's put upon their track, you won't mind paying {{something}} for it, will you, honourable deary?' ...|$|R
60|$|She obeyed, <b>and</b> having <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> lids {{well with}} the leaf, she again {{opened her eyes and}} beheld the real Fairyland.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Burdett was our {{housekeeper}} and sole domestic. She was a hard-featured but kindly old woman, with a caustic {{tongue and}} a soft heart. She heard my story unmoved, betraying neither enthusiasm or disapproval. When I had finished, she simply set her cap straight <b>and</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> hands upon her apron.|$|E
6000|$|The {{next night}} was full moon, and Dame Margery came {{and looked out}} over the fine bed of tulips, of which she was very proud. [...] "Hey-day!" [...] she cried, <b>and</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> eyes, in doubt as to whether she was asleep or awake, for the whole place was alive with little folks.|$|E
60|$|The {{good old}} woman, not knowing very well {{what to do}} in this affair, cried out for help. People came in from every quarter in great numbers; they threw water upon the Princess's face, unlaced her, struck her on the palms of her hands, <b>and</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> temples with Hungary-water; but nothing would bring her to herself.|$|E
60|$|Mary {{turned her}} large blue eyes {{up to the}} ceiling, <b>and</b> reflectively <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> dimpled chin with a very pretty finger.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs Nickleby curtseyed and smiled, and curtseyed again, <b>and</b> remarked, <b>rubbing</b> <b>her</b> {{hands as}} she did so, that she hadn't the--really--the honour to-- ...|$|R
60|$|The artist stared a moment, gave {{a little}} pout, shrugged her shoulders, put down her palette and brushes, <b>and</b> stood <b>rubbing</b> <b>her</b> hands.|$|R
60|$|She had {{certainly}} not broken her neck. She {{looked at him}} with eyes that seemed not to take him in; and though not particularly large in general they appeared so now. She pressed her side <b>and</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> arm, as if conscious of pain; then stood up, averting her face, in evident distress at his gaze.|$|E
60|$|She greeted Agnes heartily, nevertheless; and we {{were soon}} in the lighted parlour downstairs, at dinner. My aunt put on her {{spectacles}} twice or thrice, {{to take another look}} at me, but as often took them off again, disappointed, <b>and</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> nose with them. Much to the discomfiture of Mr. Dick, who knew this to be a bad symptom.|$|E
60|$|They saw the old nurse, still kneeling, {{take the}} stopper {{out of the}} black strange bottle, and turn the open mouth gently on her hand. Then she {{carefully}} put in the stopper, <b>and</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> eyes {{with the palm of}} her hand. Then she crawled along in their direction, very slowly, as if she were looking for something in the grass.|$|E
6000|$|... "To the {{smallest}} snuff-box. The last load went yesterday. The same people did it. Poor little Ricks is empty." [...] Then as if, for a crowning splendor, to check all deprecation, [...] "They're yours, you goose!" [...] Mrs. Gereth concluded, holding up <b>her</b> handsome head <b>and</b> <b>rubbing</b> <b>her</b> white hands. Fleda {{saw that there}} were tears in her deep eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "My rouge won't come off." [...] <b>and</b> Amy <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> {{brilliant}} cheek, <b>and</b> {{showed him}} her white glove with a sober simplicity {{that made him}} laugh outright.|$|R
50|$|Capricornis crispus is {{socially}} monogamous. Females reach sexual maturity at 30 months. First breeding {{takes place at}} age 2.5-3 years; breeding occurs once a year, between September and January. In a courtship ritual resembling that of goats or gazelles, the male Japanese serow licks the female's mouth, strikes her on the hind legs with his forelegs, <b>and</b> <b>rubs</b> <b>her</b> genitalia with his horns. Both sexes display Flehmen responses.|$|R
