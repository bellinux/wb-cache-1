40|$|To {{increase}} contact conductance {{between two}} <b>mating</b> <b>surfaces,</b> a conductive tape {{has been developed}} by growing dense arrays of carbon nanotubes (CNTs, graphite layers folded into cylinders) {{on both sides of}} a thermally conductive metallic foil. When the two <b>mating</b> <b>surfaces</b> are brought into contact with the conductive tape in between, the CNT arrays will adhere to the <b>mating</b> <b>surface.</b> The van der Waals force between the contacting tubes and the <b>mating</b> <b>surface</b> provides adhesion between the two <b>mating</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Even though the thermal contact conductance of a single tube-to-tube contact is small, the tremendous amount of CNTs on the surface leads to a very large overall contact conductance. Interface contact thermal resistance rises from the microroughness and the macroscopic non-planar quality of <b>mating</b> <b>surfaces.</b> When two surfaces come into contact with each other, the actual contact area may be much less than the total area of the surfaces. The real area of contact depends on the load, the surface roughness, and the elastic and inelastic properties of the surface. This issue is even more important at cryogenic temperatures, where materials become hard and brittle and vacuum is used, which prevents any gas conduction through the interstitial region. A typical approach to increase thermal contact conductance is to use thermally conducting epoxies or greases, which are not always compatible with vacuum conditions. In addition, the thermal conductivities of these compounds are often relatively low. The CNTs used in this approach can be metallic or semiconducting, depending on the folding angle and diameter. The electrical resistivity of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) has been reported. MWCNTs can pass a current density and remain stable at high temperatures in air. The thermal conductivity of a MWCNT at room temperature is measured to be approximately 3, 000 W/m-K, which is much larger than that of diamond. At room temperature, the thermal conductance of a 0. 3 sq cm array of CNTs was measured to be as high as 10 W/K. The high thermal conductivity and the nanoscale size make CNTs ideal as thermal interface materials. The CNT-based thermal tape can be used for the thermal management of microelectronic packages and electronic systems. It also can be integrated with current device technology and packaging. The material would allow for an efficient method to manage excess heat generation without requiring any additional power. Lastly, the CNT tape can be used to enhance thermal contact conductance across two <b>mating</b> <b>surfaces</b> on some NASA missions...|$|R

Of the coatings evaluated, alumimum bronze with a polyester additive was most effective at reducing wear and minimizing fretting damage to the <b>mating</b> uncoated <b>surface,</b> by means of a self-lubricating film that developed on the fretting surfaces.

40|$|Surface {{topography}} of harder <b>mating</b> <b>surface</b> {{plays an important}} role in metal forming operations as it predominantly controls the frictional behavior at the interface. In the present investigation, an inclined scratch tester was used to understand the effect of direction of surface grinding marks on interface friction and transfer layer formation. EN 8 steel flats were ground to attain different surface roughnesses with unidirectional grinding marks. Al–Mg alloy pins were then scratched against the prepared EN 8 steel flats. The grinding angle (angle between direction of scratch and grinding marks) was varied between 0 deg and 90 deg during the scratch tests. Scanning electron micrography of the contact surfaces revealed the transfer layer morphology. The coefficient of friction and transfer layer formation were observed to depend primarily on the direction of grinding marks of the harder <b>mating</b> <b>surface,</b> and independent of the surface roughness of harder <b>mating</b> <b>surface.</b> The grinding <b>angle</b> effect was attributed to the variation of plowing component of friction with grinding angle...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{characteristics}} of thermally sprayed WC-Cr-Ni cermet coating under lubricated rolling with sliding contact condition were examined experimentally. Experiments were performed using a two-roller testing machine. The coating was formed onto the blasted or ground roller specimens made of thermally refined carbon steel or induction hardened carbon steel by high energy type flame spraying (Hi-HVOF). A mirror-like finished cermet coated steel roller was mated with a noncoated carburized hardened steel roller. In {{the case of}} thermally refined steel substrate and for the <b>mating</b> <b>surface</b> roughness R max= 0. 1 µm, coating on the ground substrate showed lower durability than that on the blasted substrate. For the <b>mating</b> <b>surface</b> roughness Rmax= 3. 0 µm, coating on the ground substrate showed an extremely short life as compared with that on the blasted substrate. In general, durability of cermet coating was greatly increased due {{to the increase in}} the coating thickness. In the case of induction hardened steel substrate, coating on the blasted or ground substrate showed high durability for both R max= 0. 1 µm and 3. 0 µm. Coefficient of friction and oil film thickness were markedly influenced by the <b>mating</b> <b>surface</b> roughness but these were hardly affected by the substrate material. In addition, depending on the <b>mating</b> <b>surface</b> roughness, significant differences in the surface roughness of coated roller and depth of flaking on the coated roller were found...|$|R
