25|$|Aiki is {{different}} from the victory of sen sen, and is applied in situations of go no sen, such as when an opponent thrusts at you. Therein lies the essence of katsujinken and setsuninken. You block the attack when an opponent approaches; at his second attack you break his sword and spare his life. This is katsujinken. When an opponent strikes <b>at</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> your sword pierces his stomach it is setsuninken. These two concepts are the essence of the sword.|$|E
25|$|The {{series was}} militaristic in nature, with each enemy sprite having a {{corresponding}} information {{section in the}} pause menu, relating details {{of the real world}} weapon (or a fictionalized version, in the case of non-existent weapons, such as the Mohican helicopter from Urban Strike). The next generation titles, Soviet Strike and Nuclear Strike, featured plots based heavily on present day geopolitics, such as the instability of post-USSR states, or tensions at the DMZ between North and South Korea. However, in contrast, the games often displayed a quirky sense of humor, featuring numerous appearances by Elvis including outside a castle where he cannot be killed or even harmed, he just laughs <b>at</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> even Santa Claus, as well as wisecracks from the player character in the earlier games (in Urban Strike, the player's character, on being told the villain is an evil genius, comments: 'Great, another evil genius. Why can't I ever fight an evil idiot?') Although ostensibly serious in nature, the games were often quite tongue-in-cheek in their execution.|$|E
500|$|After his conviction, Chandler {{was named}} by media {{as one of}} Florida's most notorious criminals. He said that his last words before his {{execution}} would be: [...] "Kiss my rosy red ass". In May 2011, comparisons were drawn between Chandler's case and trial in 1994, and the murder case and the upcoming trial of Casey Anthony. In both cases heightened media attention forced the selection of jurors who lived outside the county where the crime had been committed. One of the jurors in Chandler's 1994 trial, identified as Roseann Welton, said that: [...] "He scared some of the jurors when he would sit there and stare <b>at</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> have that stupid grin on his face. He would make your skin crawl." ...|$|E

500|$|... "It's All Too Much" [...] was remixed for {{inclusion}} on the Yellow Submarine album on 16 October 1968. The vocals and handclaps were processed using automatic double tracking, so allowing these parts to be split across the stereo image. For this version, {{the song was}} edited down from the original eight minutes to a running time of 6:28, making it the longest officially released Beatles track written by Harrison. The edit was achieved by cutting a 35-second portion from around the three-minute mark, thereby removing the third chorus and the fourth verse (the last of which, beginning with the line [...] "Time for me to look <b>at</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> {{you to look at}} me", had appeared in the film), and by fading out before the final minute of the coda.|$|E
500|$|Balzac was {{fiercely}} {{proud of}} Louis Lambert {{and believed that}} it elegantly represented his diverse interests in philosophy, mysticism, religion, and occultism. When he sent an early draft to his lover at the time, however, she predicted the negative reception it would receive. [...] "Let the whole world see you for themselves, my dearest," [...] she wrote, [...] "but do not cry out to them to admire you, because then the most powerful magnifying glasses will be directed <b>at</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> what becomes of the most exquisite object when it is put under a microscope?" [...] Critical reaction was overwhelmingly negative, due mostly to the book's lack of sustaining narrative. Conservative commentator Eugène Poitou, on the other hand, accused Balzac of lacking true faith and portraying the French family as a vile institution.|$|E
500|$|Rinder {{told the}} Tampa Bay Times that interrogations [...] "would {{be carried out}} by whoever {{happened}} to be there– 20 people, 30 people, 50 people, all standing up and screaming <b>at</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> ultimately it sort of devolved into physical violence, torture, to extricate these 'confessions' out of people." [...] According to Rinder, the confessions were sometimes dictated by Miscavige, but more usually the inmates of the Hole would force each other to confess: [...] "The 50 people there are all screaming at me, telling me I've got to confess– I've done that, why don't I just admit it? I stole money, I had affairs– people would just literally dream up bullshit and start screaming it out, and then the mob goes crazy: 'Oh yeah, it must have been that!'" [...] Tom De Vocht, who was also in the Hole, recalled that [...] "everybody in that damned room— people are wild and out of control, I punched somebody. Everybody was punched. And screaming and yelling. It just got like, 'What {{the hell is going on}} here?'" [...] De Vocht rationalized his own involvement on the grounds of self-defense: [...] "If I don't attack I'm going to be attacked. It's a survival instinct in a weird situation that no one should be in." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{responsibility}} {{principle is}} that a clear conscience results when people {{realize that they are}} responsible to God for every thought, word, action, and motive. Part of this principle is asking forgiveness from whomever has been offended so that no one can point a finger <b>at</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> say, [...] "You've offended me and never asked for my forgiveness." ...|$|E
2500|$|In negotiations, one of Grossman's {{favorite}} techniques was silence. Musician manager Charlie Rothschild said of Grossman, [...] "He {{would simply}} stare <b>at</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> say nothing. He wouldn't volunteer any information, {{and that would}} drive people crazy. They would keep talking to fill the void, and say anything. He had a remarkable gift for tipping {{the balance of power}} in his favor." ...|$|E

[...] Both sides made concessions after a letter from Ribbentrop to Stalin convinced him that a deal must be completed. [...] Stalin was involved with {{the details of the}} discussion, with Hitler noting that he was impressed by Stalin's technical knowledge when he chaired a meeting of experts discussing the ordnance of gun turrets to be included on a cruiser the Germans would deliver to the Soviets under an agreement. [...] Germany agreed that the plans for the battleship Bismarck could be included in the war [...] to be provided to the Soviet Union. The final cost of the Lützow, [...] was discounted to 104 million Reichsmarks. Joseph Stalin noted in discussion with Politburo members – “ship, which you've bought from expected enemy, is equal to two ships - one more <b>at</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> one less at enemy”.|$|E
2500|$|Girls Aloud {{worked closely}} with Brian Higgins and his songwriting and {{production}} team Xenomania throughout their career. Xenomania produced all of Girls Aloud's albums and singles, excluding nine songs from their debut album Sound of the Underground, the charity single [...] "Walk This Way" [...] and two songs from Ten. Of Higgins and Xenomania, Girls Aloud's former manager Louis Walsh says, [...] "He just makes great songs for radio. They just jump out <b>at</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> stay in your brain." [...] In {{a review of the}} group's debut single [...] "Sound of the Underground", The Guardians Alexis Petridis exclaimed it [...] "proved a first: it was a reality pop record that didn't make you want to do physical harm to everyone involved in its manufacture." [...] In response to Girls Aloud's debut album, Jacqueline Hodges of BBC Music said that [...] "Higgins injects an element of instant-catchy-cool to the songs without going overboard in trying to shape uber-chic dance floor hits." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dance in the Rain is the {{follow-up}} to Coulter's third studio album Fear & Freedom (2012), which debuted at number seven on the ARIAAlbumsChart and became her first top-ten album. Coulter {{began working on}} Dance in the Rain shortly {{after the completion of}} Fear & Freedom. As executive producer of Dance in the Rain, Coulter had full control over the songwriters and producers she wanted to work with. She also spent her own money to travel overseas to write and record material for the album. Coulter intended for DanceintheRain to be an honest album and wanted to avoid following a certain sound and concept. She worked on it for two years in various places around the world, including Bali, Brisbane, Los Angeles, Melbourne, Nashville, New York City, Paris, Sweden and Sydney. Stuart Crichton co-produced a majority of the album's songs alongside Coulter. Speaking of the inspiration behind Dance in the Rain, Coulter stated: [...] "Life throws so much <b>at</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> I write about it all...I figured I had a lot to say and there were so many things I wanted to express – and I managed to pull it all together for this one album." ...|$|E
