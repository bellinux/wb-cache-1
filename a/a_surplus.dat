5|$|The 1984 Summer Olympics {{became a}} {{watershed}} moment in Olympic history. The Los Angeles-based organising committee, led by Peter Ueberroth, {{was able to}} generate <b>a</b> <b>surplus</b> of US$225million, which was an unprecedented amount at that time. The organising committee {{had been able to}} create such <b>a</b> <b>surplus</b> in part by selling exclusive sponsorship rights to select companies. The IOC sought to gain control of these sponsorship rights. Samaranch helped to establish The Olympic Programme (TOP) in 1985, in order to create an Olympic brand. Membership in TOP was, and is, very exclusive and expensive. Fees cost US$50million for a four-year membership. Members of TOP received exclusive global advertising rights for their product category, and use of the Olympic symbol, the interlocking rings, in their publications and advertisements.|$|E
5|$|After a directors' special run between Ayr (north of the river, at Newton-on-Ayr) and Irvine on 19 July 1839, {{the line}} {{opened to the}} public between those points on 5 August 1839. This was an {{enormous}} success and that limited section of the line made <b>a</b> <b>surplus</b> of £500 in the remainder of the year.

5|$|Another {{contentious}} financial {{issue at}} the time was the protective tariff. While it had not been a central point in his campaign, Cleveland's opinion on the tariff was that of most Democrats: that the tariff ought to be reduced. Republicans generally favored a high tariff to protect American industries. American tariffs had been high since the Civil War, and by the 1880s the tariff brought in so much revenue that the government was running <b>a</b> <b>surplus.</b>|$|E
5|$|Domitian's {{tendency}} towards micromanagement {{was nowhere}} {{more evident than}} in his financial policy. The question of whether Domitian left the Roman Empire in debt or with <b>a</b> <b>surplus</b> {{at the time of his}} death has been fiercely debated. The evidence points to a balanced economy for the greater part of Domitian's reign. Upon his accession he revalued the Roman currency dramatically. He increased the silver purity of the denarius from 90% to 98% — the actual silver weight increasing from 2.87grams to 3.26grams. A financial crisis in 85 forced a devaluation of the silver purity and weight to 93.5% and 3.04grams respectively.|$|E
5|$|Germany {{has come}} under {{pressure}} due to not having a government budget deficit and funding it by borrowing more. As of late 2014, the government (federal and state) has spent less than it receives in revenue, {{for the third year}} in a row, despite low economic growth. The 2015 budget includes <b>a</b> <b>surplus</b> {{for the first time since}} 1969. Current projections are that by 2019 the debt will be less than required by the Stability and Growth Pact.|$|E

5|$|Governments {{do not use}} {{the terms}} profit and loss to {{describe}} the net results of their operations. The difference between revenues and expenditures during a year is either <b>a</b> <b>surplus</b> or a deficit. Since making a profit is not {{the purpose of a}} government, a significant surplus generally means a choice between tax cuts or spending increases. A significant deficit will result in spending cuts or borrowing. Ideally, surpluses and deficits should be small.|$|E
5|$|In 1983 Neal {{made plans}} to {{challenge}} Theodore Dimauro, the Democratic incumbent Mayor of Springfield. This pressure led Dimauro to retire and Neal was elected mayor. Neal was re-elected in 1985 and 1987. As mayor, Neal oversaw a period of significant economic growth, with over $400 million of development and investment in the city, and <b>a</b> <b>surplus</b> in the city budget. He worked to strengthen Springfield's appearance, pushing to revive and preserve the city's historic homes and initiating an influential Clean City Campaign to reduce litter.|$|E
5|$|In March, Finance Minister Walter Harris, who was {{believed}} to be St. Laurent's heir apparent, introduced his budget. The budget anticipated <b>a</b> <b>surplus</b> of $258million, of which $100million was to be returned in the form of increased welfare payments, with an increase of $6 per month (to a total of $46) for old age pensioners—effective after the election. Harris indicated that no more could be returned for fear of increasing inflation. Diefenbaker attacked the budget, calling for higher old age pensions and welfare payments, more aid to the poorer provinces, and aid to farmers.|$|E

5|$|Once {{the canals}} were {{owned by the}} London and North Western Railway, {{restrictions}} were imposed on what they could carry, and the canals failed to make sufficient money to cover the interest on mortgages. However, they made a substantial operating profit for some years. Around 1850, the average annual income was £104,638, which yielded <b>a</b> <b>surplus</b> of £45,885. Most of the income was from carrying, and by 1870, income had risen to £143,976, although this only yielded <b>a</b> <b>surplus</b> of £11,727. Total traffic was 855,462 tons in 1858, but this had dropped to 742,315 tons in 1868. The carrying business was expanded in the 1870s, but although turnover increased, operating profits fell dramatically, to just £1,568 in 1876. By 1905, total traffic was 469,950 tons, nearly all of it in boats owned by the company, and between the 1870s and {{the onset of the}} First World War the company sometimes made a small operating profit and sometimes a loss. Following the end of the war, working hours were cut, wages increased, and the cost of materials increased. Losses escalated, to £153,318 on an income of £227,845 in 1920, and carriage by the company ceased in 1921, in an attempt to reduce losses. 433,230 tons of goods carried in 1929 had dropped to 151,144 tons in 1940, by which time income from tolls was £17,763, and total income was £40,985.|$|E

The state is known for its handicraft, particularly hand-woven cotton fabric, wood carvings, and bamboo products. High quality timber including sal, garjan, teak and gamar are found abundantly in the forests of Tripura.
