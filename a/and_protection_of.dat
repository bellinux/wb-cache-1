Describing the tasks <b>of</b> social <b>and</b> legal <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> children {{in the case of}} dissolution of marriage in which unprovided children live was the main objective of this work. Identifying eventual shortcomings of valid legislation <b>of</b> social <b>and</b> legal <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> children was the second objective. Family conceptions, its characteristics and basic functions as well as a legal definition of divorce and its consequences are specified in the theoretical part of the work. Another chapter deals with social <b>and</b> legal <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> children in general; it describes its historical development, bodies, procedures and basic principles. The social <b>and</b> legal <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> children in divorce situations is solved in the last chapter of the theoretical part of the work. Tasks of a guardian ad litem are particularly described there. To meet the objectives, a qualitative research was made, namely with a method of non-standardized questioning. An interview was used as a technique of data collection. The research was made in two departments <b>of</b> social <b>and</b> legal <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> children in the South Bohemian Region, and six guardians ad litem in total participated in it...|$|R
40|$|The diploma thesis named Introducing quality {{standards}} for social <b>and</b> legal <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> {{children from the}} point of view of social workers of the institution <b>of</b> social <b>and</b> legal <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> children enables an insight into the issue of how social workers of the institution <b>of</b> social <b>and</b> legal <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> children view the introduction of {{quality standards}} for social <b>and</b> legal <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> children. The amendment of Act No. 359 / 1999 Coll., on social <b>and</b> legal <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> children, has brought significant changes in the activity of institutions <b>of</b> social <b>and</b> legal <b>protection</b> (OSPOD / BSLPC), especially in the field of applying instruments of social work. The conditions for a quality performance of the contents of this responsible work are created by means of standardisation. Standardisation means determining obligatory procedures in the performance of particular management activities as well as minimum parameters for a quality performance thereof (Macela, 2012). The thesis is divided into several parts. The first chapter defines the basic terms of the subject in question. The thesis is devised theoretically and draws on relevant professional literature. It deals with the specifications <b>of</b> social <b>and</b> legal <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> children (SLPC), what kinds of principles <b>of</b> social <b>and</b> legal <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> children there are, the SLPC social workers, the conditions for the performance of the profession of SLPC social workers. Further, the chapter explains terms of quality, social work, the family and the child. It defines perception and which factors may influence perception. Appropriate attention is given to the legislation of quality standards for the institutions <b>of</b> social <b>and</b> legal <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> children, the content and objective of quality standards of the institutions <b>of</b> social <b>and</b> legal <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> children, the process of standardisation and the availability <b>of</b> social <b>and</b> legal <b>protection</b> <b>and</b> the conditions for the performance thereof. The second chapter determines the objective of the thesis and research questions. The third chapter characterises the set examined and the methodology of work chosen for this purpose, the techniques of collecting data, analysis of data and the realisation of the actual research, including the ethics of the research. The fourth chapter deals with the outcomes of the thesis. The main objective of the thesis was to identify how social workers perceive the introduction of quality standards for social <b>and</b> legal <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> children. To achieve the objective of the thesis, I chose the strategy of the qualitative research, method of questioning and the technique of a semi-structured interview. The interviews were realised in the course of July 2016 in the research sample of ten staff members of the institution <b>of</b> social <b>and</b> legal <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> children who work at the position of a SLPC social worker in communities with extended powers, situated in the Region of South Bohemia. The communication partners were chosen by the method of purposive sampling. Based on the objective of the thesis two research questions were set up: Which factors influence the perception of social workers of the institution <b>of</b> social <b>and</b> legal <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> children within the introduction of quality standards for social <b>and</b> legal <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> children? Which aspects of the introduction of quality standards for social <b>and</b> legal <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> children are perceived by social workers of the institution <b>of</b> social <b>and</b> legal <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> children as positive or negative? As has emerged from the research, the changes resulting from the introduction of the standards that social workers of the institution <b>of</b> social <b>and</b> legal <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> children regarded as positive included the improvement in workplace equipment and setting a limit for the number of families that a social worker may work with at one time. The majority of social workers gave a positive evaluation to the introduction of supervision. Work quality has been...|$|R
5|$|As their landscapes {{have similar}} scenic qualities, AONBs may be {{compared}} to the national parks of England and Wales. AONBs are created under the same legislation as the national parks, the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. In contrast to national parks, which have their own authorities and legal power to prevent unsympathetic development, very few statutory duties are imposed on the local authorities within an AONB. However, further regulation <b>and</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> AONBs was added by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000.|$|E
5|$|Besides the {{buildings}} of Fort Yellowstone, the army left {{a legacy of}} policies and practices that served as precedents for the future National Park Service management of national parks. The army military commanders implemented backcountry patrols, wildlife protection and management, <b>and</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> natural features. Army educational programs were later adopted by the National Park Service {{as part of their}} resource management. The army effectively implemented law enforcement priorities and developed a ranger force that provided for prosecution and punishment of those engaged in illegal activity in the national parks. The National Park Service carried over a version of the campaign hat worn by members of the army during the last years of their management of Yellowstone National Park for use by Park Rangers.|$|E

An attempt to protect the integrity of the French Limousin Herd Book by opposing the entry of foreign purebreds that may have been subject to less stringent selection criteria is prohibited under EU legislation because it is considered to hinder intra-Community trade. Current EU legislation with its focus on free trade thus has the potential to result in the dilution of purebred breeds and loss of efficiency gains arising from crossbreeding.|$|E
