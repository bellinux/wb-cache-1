In firms with many employees and various different projects, this <b>assignment</b> <b>decision</b> involves a complex optimization procedure. Obviously, the employees' productivities in the respective projects are crucial for the employer's optimal <b>assignment</b> <b>decision,</b> but assignment can also be affected by risk-incentive trade-offs. Moreover, taxation can alter the <b>assignment</b> <b>decision,</b> especially if employees are sent abroad as expatriates so that international tax law {{has to be taken}} into account. To address these issues simultaneously, we combine a human resource assignment problem with a principal-agent problem of the LEN type. Both wage taxation at the agents' level and corporate taxation at the principal's level are integrated. We show that national tax rules as well as the methods for avoiding double taxation and the agents' tax characteristics are important determinants for international assignment decisions. The effects of tax rate variations can be ambiguous and depend on whether the exemption method or the credit method are applied, in particular if agents make differing choices of residence. From a tax policy perspective, the exemption method should be preferred because the tax effects are more transparent than under the credit method. Special deductions for incoming expatriates have only little effects on the optimal <b>assignment</b> <b>decision...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract — IEEE 802. 11 WLANs are {{becoming}} more and more popular in homes and urban areas. As opposed to traditional WLANs, the access points (APs) in these networks are often deployed by network non-specialists in an uncoordinated manner, leading to unplanned topology, interference and unsatisfactory throughput performance. We consider in this paper a distributed channel assignment algorithm for uncoordinated WLANs, where APs can selfconfigure their operating channels to minimize interference. We propose an efficient, simple and distributed algorithm termed CACAO (Client-Assisted Channel Assignment Optimization). In CACAO, an AP makes use of the traffic information fed back by its clients to make channel <b>assignment</b> <b>decision.</b> This leads to better knowledge on network environment and better channel <b>assignment</b> <b>decision</b> at the APs. We conduct extensive simulation study and comparisons using Network Simulator 2 (NS 2).

40|$|Resource {{flexibility}} {{is an important}} tool for firms to better match capacity with demand so as to increase revenues and improve service levels. However, in service contexts that require dynamically deciding whether to accept incoming jobs and what resource to assign to each accepted job, harnessing the benefits of flexibility requires using effective methods for making these operational decisions. Motivated by the resource deployment decisions facing a professional service firm in the workplace training industry, we address the dynamic job acceptance and resource assignment problem for systems with general resource flexibility structure, i. e., with multiple resource types that can each perform different overlapping subsets of job types. We first show that, for systems containing specialized resources for individual job types and a versatile resource type that can perform all job types, the exact policy uses a threshold rule. With more general flexibility structures, since the associated stochastic dynamic program is intractable, we develop and test three optimization-based approximate policies. Our extensive computational tests show {{that one of the}} methods, which we call the Bottleneck Capacity Reservation policy, is remarkably effective in generating near-optimal solutions over a wide range of problem scenarios. We also consider a model variant that requires dynamic job acceptance decisions but permits deferring resource <b>assignment</b> <b>decisions</b> {{until the end of the}} horizon. For this model, we discuss an adaptation of our approximate policy, establish the effectiveness of this policy, and assess the value of postponing <b>assignment</b> <b>decisions.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a simulation {{study of the}} relative impact of due-date assignment, dispatching and labor <b>assignment</b> <b>decision</b> rules {{on the performance of}} a hypothetical dual-constrained job shop. Six criteria are used to measure the performance of the decision rules. They are mean flow-time, variance of flow-time, mean lateness, variance of lateness, proportion of jobs late, and total labor transfers. Multiple regression is the principal method of analysis {{of the results of the}} experiments. This technique provides regression coefficients and analysis of variance statistics for the decision rules for the various performance measures. Since the objective of this study is to go beyond simple statements of the significance of the various decision rules, the multiple regression results are used with analysis of variance statistics to indicate the relative impact of the decision rules. The regression coefficients and the omega squared (ω 2) indices [Hays, W. L. 1962. Statistics. Holt, Rinehart and Winston, New York, 406 - 408. ] indicate that the relative importance of the due-date assignment, dispatching and labor <b>assignment</b> <b>decision</b> rules is dependent upon the measure of performance considered. In addition, the relative importance and optimality of the dispatching rules is dependent upon the due-date tightness for selected performance measures. ...|$|E

30|$|In {{conventional}} {{spectrum management}} schemes, spectrum <b>assignment</b> <b>decisions</b> are often static, with spectrum allocated to licensed users (PUs) {{on a long}} term basis for large geographical regions. Under these schemes, PUs hold exclusive rights to access the spectrum. Unfortunately, recent spectrum utilization measurements {{have shown that the}} usage of spectrum is concentrated on certain portions of the spectrum while significant amounts are severely underutilized. As a result, spectrum scarcity problem occurs due to the static and rigid nature of these schemes [1]. Moreover, these schemes prevent spectrum owners to trade the unused spectrum in secondary markets. Spectrum scarcity problem motivates developing new communication paradigms to exploit the unused spectrum efficiently and meet the exponential growth of spectrum demand nowadays.|$|R

30|$|The {{influence}} of wage tax regimes on pay-performance sensitivities {{is closely related}} to the wage tax effect on managerial effort. In the standard LEN model, the optimal pay-performance sensitivity is not affected by wage taxation when wage tax is modeled with a proportional tax rate. Ewert and Niemann (2012) show that this result carries over to an extended scenario with two periods and two action choices. However, if the wage tax burden is modeled as a function of gross pay with a progressive marginal tax rate, the optimal pay-performance sensitivity varies with the marginal wage tax rate. In this case, an increase in the marginal tax rate implies an increase in the pay-performance sensitivity (Brunello et al. 2011). Based on the tax-related results regarding pay-performance sensitivities in the LEN model, Martini and Niemann (2015) analyze the effects of taxation on a human resource <b>assignment</b> <b>decision.</b> In their model, the principal is faced with the decision to assign two agents to two jobs that are associated with a foreign subsidiary of a multinational enterprise. The authors show that the <b>assignment</b> <b>decision</b> depends on whether the credit or the exemption method is applied to eliminate double taxation. In the binary model of Halperin et al. (2001), both components of the manager’s compensation, variable and fixed salary, increase with the level of wage taxation. An increase in wage taxation forces the principal to provide higher total compensation to ensure that the manager accepts the contract. Niemann (2011) finds that this effect does not depend on whether profits and losses are taxed in the same way and shows that the wage tax penalizes performance-based contracts more heavily than fixed-salary schemes.|$|E

40|$|Traceability {{schemes for}} {{aquaculture}} species {{are essential for}} tracing market product to farm of origin {{in the event of}} detection of disease or toxins in the market fish. DNA markers have been proposed as a tool for traceability. These markers can be used to genotype fish by taking a sample from live fish or fish product at any stage along the production chain. In this paper, we consider three alternate traceability schemes using DNA markers. The example of the Norwegian farmed Atlantic salmon industry was used. This industry, like many aquaculture industries, has three tiers, the nucleus, multiplier and commercial tiers. The nucleus individuals are grandparents of the commercial fish, and the multiplier individuals are the parents of the commercial fish. The traceability strategies we considered were: (1) FS, assignment of market place fish to full sib families based on the marker information (this strategy assumes all individuals from a full sib family are allocated to a single farm and a limited number of fish, representing all full sib families on that farm, are genotyped); (2) PAR, assignment of market place fish to parents (multiplier individuals) and (3) GRAND, assignment of market place fish to grandparents (nucleus individuals). Using simulation, we determined the number of DNA markers required to achieve 95 % of correct <b>assignment</b> <b>decisions</b> for each strategy. The simulation included a wild population which contributed to market place fish. The wild fish were correctly assigned if they were excluded from belonging to the farmed population in each strategy, otherwise they were incorrectly assigned. Both microsatellite markers or single nucleotide polymorphism markers were considered. Seventy five, 15, and 50 microsatellites were required to achieve 95 % correct <b>assignment</b> <b>decisions</b> for FS, PAR and GRAND, respectively. Four hundred, 75 and 200 SNPs were required to achieve 95 % correct <b>assignment</b> <b>decisions</b> for FS, PAR and GRAND, respectively. If the cost of genotyping microsatellites is assumed to be five times as high as genotyping a SNP, GRAND using SNP markers is the cheapest strategy. The logistics of implementing each strategy are discussed. GRAND in particular and PAR in some industries requires complicated logistics. The most suitable and cost effective traceability strategy for a particular industry will depend heavily on the organisation of that industry, for example the degree of recording transfer of fish, eggs and larvae between tiers. Even if complicated logistics prevent the adoption of marker based schemes by some industries, traceability with DNA markers may still be important for verification of labelling-based schemes...|$|R
