5|$|The Malaysian federal {{government}} operates one television channel, TVi and two state radio channels for the state, known as Sabah FM and Sabah vFM along with district channels such as Sandakan FM, Tawau FM and Keningau FM. Other radio channels such as KK FM is operated by Universiti Malaysia Sabah, while Bayu FM is only available through Astro, the Malaysian main satellite television. Several newly independent radio station have been {{launched in the}} state, namely Kupi-Kupi FM in 2016, KK12FM and VOKFM in 2017. Other Peninsular-based radio stations also had set up their offices {{in the state to}} tap the emerging market. Sabahan DJs are mostly hired and local state songs will be played to meet Sabahan listeners taste and slang. Television broadcasting in the state are divided into terrestrial and satellite television. As Malaysia aims for digital television transition, all <b>analogue</b> <b>signal</b> will be shutdown soon. There is two types of free-to-air television provider such as MYTV Broadcasting (digital terrestrial) and Astro NJOI (satellite). The state first established newspaper is the Sabah Times (rebranded as the New Sabah Times), founded by the late Fuad Stephens, who became the first Chief Minister of Sabah. Other main newspapers include the independent Daily Express, Overseas Chinese Daily News, the Sarawak-based The Borneo Post, the Peninsular-based Sin Chew Daily and the Brunei-based Borneo Bulletin.|$|E

25|$|The <b>analogue</b> <b>signal</b> for NTD {{was shut}} off at 9.00am CST on Tuesday 30 July 2013.|$|E
50|$|Mechanical, pneumatic, hydraulic, {{and other}} systems may also use <b>analogue</b> <b>signals.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{rest of the}} <b>analogue</b> <b>signals</b> were {{switched}} off permanently just after midnight on 9 September 2009. Once the digital signals were reshuffled {{to take advantage of}} the space left by the {{switched off}} <b>analogue</b> <b>signals,</b> they were then brought up to full power (digital signals were broadcast at a much lower power pre-switchover). This completes Caradon Hill's switchover to digital. This also completes the West Country region's digital switchover.|$|R

25|$|Lower Normandy, {{including}} Bagnoles, was {{the first}} region in France, together with Alsace, to change over completely to digital television reception, giving more channels with a higher quality of image and sound to residents. Digital signals were broadcast alongside analogue from December 2009 until March 2010, when the <b>analogue</b> <b>signal</b> was switched off.|$|E
25|$|As video {{recorder}} technology improved it became possible to modify them and use analogue to digital converters (codecs) for digital sound recording. This brought greater dynamic range to tape mastering, combined with low noise and distortion, {{and freedom from}} drop outs as well as pre- and post-echo. The digital recording was played back providing a high quality <b>analogue</b> <b>signal</b> to master the lacquer–aluminium cut.|$|E
25|$|Concorde's Air Intake Control System also {{pioneered the}} use of digital data {{highways}} (multiplexed serial data buses) which connected the Air Intake Sensor Units that collected aerodynamic data at {{the nose of the}} aircraft (total pressure, static pressure, angle of attack and sideslip) and sent it to the Air Intake Control Units located nearer the air intakes using screened, twisted pair cables to replace a much greater weight in aircraft wiring had only <b>analogue</b> <b>signal</b> wiring been used.|$|E
50|$|In December 2011, RTQ's <b>analogue</b> <b>signals</b> in {{regional}} Queensland were turned off {{as part of}} the switchover to digital television.|$|R
50|$|The initial {{plan was}} that Boxer would start {{broadcasting}} on November 1, 2009, when the <b>analogue</b> <b>signals</b> were shut down.|$|R
50|$|From {{midnight on}} 31 October 2012, <b>analogue</b> <b>signals</b> were {{switched}} off in Delhi and Mumbai. Pirated signals {{were available in}} parts of Delhi even after the date. In Kolkata, on 30 October 2012, the state government refused to switch off <b>analogue</b> <b>signals</b> citing low penetration of set-top boxes (STBs) required for receiving digital signals. The I&B Ministry did not push for switching off of <b>analogue</b> <b>signals</b> in Kolkata. After approximately the Centre estimated that 75% of Kolkata households had installed STBs, the ministry issued a directive to stop airing analogue channels {{in some parts of}} the city beginning 16 December and completely switch off <b>analogue</b> <b>signals</b> after 27 December. On 17 December 2012, the West Bengal government openly defied the directive and stated that it would not implement it. The state government then announced that it would extend the deadline to 15 January 2013. The I&B ministry had initially threatened to cancel the license of multi system operators (MSOs) in Kolkata if they did not switch off all analogue channels. However, the ministries softened their stand following a letter from MSOs, explaining how it they were sandwiched between divergent orders from the Central and State Governments.|$|R
25|$|On 9 February 2005, Ofcom {{issued a}} {{proposed}} timetable for ending analogue terrestrial television transmissions {{as part of}} the switchover to digital television. Tyne Tees was the penultimate region to cease broadcasting in analogue, which occurred during September 2012. Tyne Tees took over the relay transmitter at Berwick-upon-Tweed in December 2006 from Border Television in order to extend the deadline of the town's upgrade to digital TV by four years, since Border was the first to switch off its <b>analogue</b> <b>signal</b> in 2008.|$|E
25|$|A {{portable}} {{media player}} (PMP) or digital audio player (DAP) is a portable consumer electronics device capable of storing and playing digital media such as audio, images, and video files. The data is typically stored on a CD, DVD, flash memory, microdrive, or hard drive. Most portable media players {{are equipped with}} a 3.5mm headphone jack, which users can plug headphones into, or connect to a boombox or hifi system. In contrast, analogue portable audio players play music from non-digital media that use <b>analogue</b> <b>signal</b> storage, such as cassette tapes or vinyl records.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a typical}} installation, {{data for the}} {{transmit}} pulses are stored in digital memory as a sequence of baseband I/Q samples (see quadrature phase), or as samples of a low IF waveform, and read out to a high speed D/A converters, as required. [...] The <b>analogue</b> <b>signal,</b> so formed, is up-converted for transmission. [...] On reception, returning signals are amplified and, typically, converted to a low IF or to baseband I/Q signals before being digitised by A/D converters. [...] The compression of the chirps and additional signal processing is all performed by a digital computer, which has stored within it the chirp pulse data needed {{to carry out the}} compression process numerically.|$|E
40|$|At {{the input}} to the {{calorimeter}} {{part of the}} Level- 1 Trigger a Pre-Processor system performs the preprocessing of about 7200 <b>analogue</b> trigger-tower <b>signals.</b> The preprocessing includes digitisation, identification of the corresponding bunch-crossing in time (BCID), calibration of the transverse energy, rate monitoring, readout of raw trigger data, and high-speed data transmission to the following processors. The preprocessing {{of a large number}} of <b>analogue</b> <b>signals</b> requires a compact Pre-Processor system with fast hard-wired algorithms implemented in application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). In this paper we present the tasks of the Pre-Processor, measurement results, and advanced technologies used for the preprocessing of about 7200 <b>analogue</b> <b>signals...</b>|$|R

25|$|Game seven was {{the final}} major {{sporting}} event on analogue television in the United States, with the DTV transition finishing less than an hour-and-a-half after the game ended and just one hour after NBC coverage ended. NBC affiliates WDIV-TV in Detroit and WPXI in Pittsburgh – who months before the Stanley Cup playoffs began electing to keep their own respective <b>analogue</b> <b>signals</b> on until June 12, well past the original February 17 deadline – both remained on the air for game seven before cutting their <b>analogue</b> <b>signals</b> at 11:59 EDT.|$|R
2500|$|In October 2007, {{following}} a 15-month publicity and information campaign, {{and an early}} digital launch in August by Channel 5, the Whitehaven, Eskdale Green and Gosforth transmitters switched off <b>analogue</b> <b>signals</b> on the BBC Two frequency, and began broadcasting a temporary digital service for the main channels. On 14 November, all <b>analogue</b> <b>signals</b> were switched off, and the permanent three-multiplex digital service began (albeit with Channel 5 only on the Whitehaven transmitter, until 2009). Unfortunately, as had been feared, {{a small number of}} homes among the hills, which had received [...] "fuzzy" [...] <b>analogue</b> <b>signals,</b> particularly in Eskdale, were unable to receive a decodable Freeview signal. The only other serious problem resulted from the [...] "rescan" [...] command in some models of set-top box defaulting to frequencies used by the nearest main transmitter, instead of the strongest digital signals; this could be overcome by using the [...] "add channel" [...] option to select channels one-by-one, and in the long term by corrections to the boxes' software.|$|R
5000|$|Work {{began on}} a new {{temporary}} 217.7 m stayed mast (Wenvoe [...] "C") on 14 June 2006 and it was completed in September 2006. This carried the <b>analogue</b> <b>signals</b> whilst Wenvoe [...] "A" [...] was to be structurally improved and extended by 23 m. Wenvoe [...] "A" [...] was fitted with a new high-power digital antenna and a full reserve antenna. New high-power digital TV transmitters were installed in the buildings, which would allow Wenvoe [...] "A" [...] to broadcast all six main digital TV multiplexes, {{as well as a}} seventh currently proposed by OFCOM [...] after the <b>analogue</b> <b>signals</b> were switched off in 2010.|$|R

50|$|Digital {{television}} {{replaced the}} old <b>analogue</b> <b>signals</b> during October 2012. An additional multiplex named NImux including TG4, RTÉ One, RTÉ Two and RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta launched at switchover here and at two other transmitters in Northern Ireland.|$|R
30|$|Moreover, {{using the}} {{proposed}} simulation model, RTDS can produce analogue {{voltage and current}} signals reflecting fault characteristics of distribution network with inverter-based DGs.
