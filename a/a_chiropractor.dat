500|$|... "Pokey Mom" [...] {{was written}} by Tom Martin and {{directed}} by Bob Anderson {{as part of the}} twelfth season of The Simpsons (2000–2001).

500|$|On July 30, Richard {{went to see}} <b>a</b> <b>chiropractor</b> who rotated {{his neck}} to fix {{the flow of blood}} in his upper torso region. Later that day, Richard was {{participating}} in warm-ups before the game when he suffered a major stroke and collapsed in the outfield. Before the stroke, he had a headache and a feeling of weakness through his body. Eventually, that progressed into vision problems and paralysis in {{the left side of his}} body. A massive blockage in his right carotid artery necessitated emergency surgery that evening. An examination by neurologist William S. Fields showed that Richard was still experiencing weakness in his extremities and on the left side of his face. He also had blurred vision through his left eye. A CAT scan of Richard's brain later showed that Richard had experienced three separate strokes from the different obstructions in his arterial system. Furthermore, the arteries in his right arm were still obstructed. Later examinations showed that Richard was suffering from extensive arterial thoracic outlet syndrome. While pitching, his clavicle and first rib pinched his subclavian artery. As a result of this problem, Richard would feel normal for the first few innings of the game but after putting repeated pressure on his subclavian artery, his arm would start to ache in pain and eventually start to feel [...] "heavy". His wife at the time, Carolyn, told reporters, [...] "It took death, or nearly death, to get an apology. They should have believed him." ...|$|E
