5|$|Under the {{governance}} of the jurists Gregorius, Aurelius Arcadius Charisius, and Hermogenianus, the imperial government began issuing official books of precedent, collecting and listing all the rescripts that had been issued from the reign of Hadrian (r. 117–38) to the reign of Diocletian. The Codex Gregorianus includes rescripts up to 292, which the Codex Hermogenianus updated with a comprehensive collection of rescripts issued by Diocletian in 293 and 294. Although the very <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>codification</b> was a radical innovation, given the precedent-based design of the Roman legal system, the jurists were generally conservative, and constantly looked to past Roman practice and theory for guidance. They were probably given more free rein over their codes than the later compilers of the Codex Theodosianus (438) and Codex Justinianus (529) would have. Gregorius and Hermogenianus' codices lack the rigid structuring of later codes, and were not published {{in the name of}} the emperor, but in the names of their compilers. Their official character, however, was clear in that both collections were subsequently acknowledged by courts as authoritative records of imperial legislation up to the date of their publication and regularly updated.|$|E

We find that the presence of strong industry norms governing the division of labour discourages knowledge transfer through codification, as suggested by the existing qualitative studies. The presence of a system integrator {{plays an important role in}} driving the use <b>of</b> <b>codification</b> for knowledge transfer, to some extent embodying an organizational memory in volatile project environments. Finally, the level of use of administrative control in the project is a robust predictor of attempts to transfer knowledge via codification.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{four categories}} of knowledge management strategies used by multinational corporations (MNCs). Codification strategies involve {{the transformation of}} tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge {{in order to facilitate}} flows of organizational knowledge. Tacitness strategies keep organizational knowledge tacit in order to prevent flows of knowledge to competitors. Focused knowledge management strategies regulate knowledge flows by controlling the degree to which knowledge is encoded in forms which match the information intensity and ambiguity of their knowledge. Unfocused knowledge management strategies attempt to regulate knowledge flows by controlling the overall level <b>of</b> <b>codification</b> <b>of</b> knowledge without special consideration of the capabilities of specific forms <b>of</b> <b>codification.</b> Empirical analyses <b>of</b> the effects of these strategies on subunit performance in a sample of U. S. and Danish subsidiaries suggest that the focused strategies are superior to the other strategies. Our results also indicate that different kinds of organizational knowledge require matching forms <b>of</b> <b>codification</b> in order to increase performance. The results give rise to a nested contingency model of knowledge management...|$|R
40|$|The {{coordination}} of effort within and among different expert groups {{is a central}} feature of contemporary organizations. Within the existing literature, however, a dichotomy has emerged {{in our understanding of}} the role played by codification in coordinating expert groups. One strand <b>of</b> literature emphasizes <b>codification</b> as a process that supports coordination by enabling the storage and ready transfer of knowledge. In contrast, another strand highlights the persistent differences between expert groups that create boundaries to the transfer of knowledge, seeing coordination as dependent {{on the quality of the}} reciprocal interactions between groups and individuals. Our research helps to resolve such contested understandings of the coordinative role played by codification. By focusing on the offshore-outsourcing of knowledge-intensive services, we examine the role played by codification when expertise was coordinated between client staff and onsite and offshore vendor personnel in a large-scale outsourcing contract between TATA Consultancy Services (TCS) and ABN AMRO bank. A number of theoretical contributions flow from our analysis of the case study, helping to move our understanding beyond the dichotomized views <b>of</b> <b>codification</b> outlined above. First, our study adds to previous work where codification has been seen as a static concept by demonstrating the multiple, coexisting, and complementary roles that codification may play. We examine the dynamic nature <b>of</b> <b>codification</b> and show changes in the relative importance of these different roles in coordinating distributed expertise over time. Second, we reconceptualize the commonly accepted view <b>of</b> <b>codification</b> as focusing on the replication and diffusion of knowledge by developing the notion <b>of</b> the <b>codification</b> <b>of</b> the "knower" as complementary to the <b>codification</b> <b>of</b> knowledge. Unlike previous studies <b>of</b> expertise directories, <b>codification</b> <b>of</b> the knower does not involve representing expertise in terms of occupational skills or competences but enables the reciprocal interrelating of expertise required by more unstructured tasks...|$|R
40|$|Modern Law Codes {{answer to}} the enlightened ideal of purifying and {{recording}} once and for all, setting the law by means of legislation: ius in legem redigere.

40|$|Professional Doctorate - Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) The {{landmark}} {{article by}} Hansen, Nohria and Tierney alerts companies against adopting a dual {{emphasis on the}} strategies <b>of</b> <b>codification</b> and personalization. This research investigates whether companies can adopt a hybrid strategy by straddling both codification and personalization without affecting organizational performance. Based on a survey of 219 MSC-status companies in Malaysia, the research determined that organizational culture, leadership and organizational structure do not contribute to codification-personalization strategy. Statistically, the strength of organizational culture {{and the degree of}} transactional leadership are highly correlated; the extent of organic structure and the strength of organizational culture are moderately correlated; and the degree of transactional leadership and the extent of organic structure are uncorrelated. While level <b>of</b> <b>codification</b> does not contribute to organizational performance, a strong organizational culture and a high degree of transactional leadership contribute positively to organizational performance, whereas the extent of organic structure is insignificant in predicting organizational performance. There is no statistical evidence to show that the further a company progresses along the knowledge life-cycle, the higher the level of codification; nor does firm size contribute to level <b>of</b> <b>codification.</b> However, knowledge life-cycle and firm size are highly correlated with each other. The level <b>of</b> <b>codification</b> differs significantly across the six sectors of MSC-status companies. There is a difference in the choice of codification-personalization strategy between local- and foreign-owned companies, whereby the level <b>of</b> <b>codification</b> for local-owned companies is significantly higher than foreign-owned companies. Companies adopting a hybrid strategy have higher organizational performance than companies adopting either a codification or a personalization strategy, but the difference is not statistically significant. The low Cronbach’s alpha for local-owned companies indicates the absence of knowledge management strategy among Malaysian companies. In this light, the alignment of knowledge management strategy with business strategy is proposed for further study...|$|R
