5|$|A {{shipyard}} {{was established}} in Faversham by James Pollock & Sons (Shipbuilders) in 1916 {{at the request of}} Lord Fisher, the First Lord of The Admiralty, for manufacturing barges for landing craft. Faversham <b>already</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> tradition of shipbuilding, and it soon became a major contributor to markets throughout the world, producing vessels such as the Molliette and the Violette, both constructed of concrete. Over 1200 ships were built and launched from Faversham between 1916 and 1969.|$|E

5|$|Bill Haywood {{had left}} the WFM and was {{organizing}} for the IWW {{by the time the}} Lawrence Textile Strike in Lawrence, Massachusetts garnered national attention. On January 11, 1912, textile mill workers in Lawrence left their jobs in protest of lowered wages. Within a week, twenty thousand workers were on strike. The IWW <b>already</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> presence in Lawrence and assumed leadership of the strike.|$|E
5|$|During his campaign, Chandler {{had promised}} {{that he would}} fund a medical school at the University of Kentucky, {{despite the fact that}} the University of Louisville <b>already</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> medical school and a poll of state {{physicians}} showed overwhelming opposition to the plan because of this. Nevertheless, Chandler delivered on his promise, allocating $5million to the establishment of what became known as the Albert B. Chandler Medical Center. Chandler said the establishment of the school was his proudest achievement as governor.|$|E
5|$|Eva Perón {{spent her}} {{childhood}} in Junín, Buenos Aires province. Her father, Juan Duarte, was descended from French Basque immigrants, meanwhile her mother Juana Ibarguren, was descended from Spanish Basque immigrants.

5|$|In 2007, Neighbours {{suffered}} one of {{its worst}} decline in viewers and several key changes took place to boost the ratings. Network Ten drama executive, Dan Bennett revealed that the show would return to its focus on relationships and family dynamics. Writers created and introduced a new family, the Parkers, who <b>already</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> link to Ramsay Street {{in the form of}} Ned Parker (Daniel O'Connor). The family made their first on-screen appearance in July 2007, marking the start of the show's renovation.|$|E
5|$|In April 2015 Polygon {{published}} an article describing the development process of Alan Wake 2 that started shortly after the first game released. Alan Wake 2 <b>already</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> working prototype and Remedy was prepared to pitch the game to Microsoft. However, according to Sam Lake, Remedy's founder, Microsoft wanted something else {{and development of the}} sequel has shifted to Quantum Break. Most of the ideas for Alan Wake 2 were implemented on American Nightmare. Like the game's location, the Arizona Desert.|$|E
5|$|Overall {{identified}} {{a number of}} reasons why residents opposed self-government. Along with the previously mentioned fear of increases in taxation or decreases in services, he argued that those living in the ACT would have felt that they <b>already</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> voice in the governance of the territory, through federal electoral representation. Canberra also had a high proportion of public servants who felt that they were already a part of the government, and knew how to work with the system.|$|E

5|$|Several of {{the actors}} were {{specialised}} comedians, notably Joseph Haines who played the false-wit character Sparkish, Alithea's original fiancé. At the outset of his high-profile career as comedian and song-and-dance man, young Haines <b>already</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> reputation for eccentricity and dominant stage presence, suggesting that Sparkish {{is not merely a}} comic butt for the truewits Horner, Harcourt, and Dorilant to mock, but also a real threat to the romance of Harcourt and Alithea.|$|E
5|$|Both {{families}} were largely Unitarian, though the Wedgwoods were adopting Anglicanism. Robert Darwin, himself quietly a freethinker, had baby Charles baptised in November 1809 in the Anglican St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury, but Charles and his siblings attended the Unitarian chapel with their mother. The eight-year-old Charles <b>already</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> taste for {{natural history and}} collecting {{when he joined the}} day school run by its preacher in 1817. That July, his mother died. From September 1818, he joined his older brother Erasmus attending the nearby Anglican Shrewsbury School as a boarder.|$|E
5|$|By 1795, Bonaparte {{had become}} engaged to Désirée Clary, {{daughter}} of François Clary. Désirée's sister Julie Clary had married Bonaparte's elder brother Joseph. In April 1795, {{he was assigned}} to the Army of the West, which was engaged in the War in the Vendée—a civil war and royalist counter-revolution in Vendée, a region in west central France on the Atlantic Ocean. As an infantry command, it was a demotion from artillery general—for which the army <b>already</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> full quota—and he pleaded poor health to avoid the posting.|$|E

5|$|City {{planning}} and urban lifestyles had {{been influenced by}} the Greeks from an early period, and in the eastern Empire, Roman rule accelerated and shaped the local development of cities that <b>already</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> strong Hellenistic character. Cities such as Athens, Aphrodisias, Ephesus and Gerasa altered some aspects of city {{planning and}} architecture to conform to imperial ideals, while also expressing their individual identity and regional preeminence. In the areas of the western Empire inhabited by Celtic-speaking peoples, Rome encouraged the development of urban centres with stone temples, forums, monumental fountains, and amphitheatres, often on or near the sites of the preexisting walled settlements known as oppida. Urbanization in Roman Africa expanded on Greek and Punic cities along the coast.|$|E
5|$|Ed Roberts and Bill Yates {{finished}} the first prototype in October 1974 and shipped it to Popular Electronics in New York via the Railway Express Agency. However, it never arrived {{due to a}} strike by the shipping company. Solomon <b>already</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> number of pictures of the machine and the article was based on them. Roberts got to work on building a replacement. The computer on the magazine cover is an empty box with just switches and LEDs on the front panel. The finished Altair computer had a completely different circuit board layout than the prototype shown in the magazine.|$|E
5|$|Ellis {{started the}} 1967 season with Columbus. He {{believed}} {{that he was not}} on the major league club because the Pirates <b>already</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> number of African American players; he felt that the team did not want to alienate white fans. Ellis was sent down to the Macon Peaches of the Southern League, which Ellis believed was due to the length of his hair. Ellis said that he was promoted back to Columbus after shaving his head. He had a 2–0 win-loss record with Macon and a 5–7 record with Columbus.|$|E

5|$|In 1907, Georges Passerieu {{broke away}} from a small leading group just before Douai because he knew he couldn't outsprint them if they all {{finished}} together. He was chased {{all the way to}} Roubaix by a Belgian, Cyrille van Hauwaert, and tension in the velodrome was high. The crowd heard that Passerieu had reached the stadium but nobody rode on to the track. The leader was just about to ride in when a gendarme stepped into his path to check if his bicycle had the obligatory tax plate attached to it. Passerieu had <b>already</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> hard day and a shouting match broke out before he was allowed to continue.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, the {{gendarmerie}} was reorganized as the Garde d'Haïti {{and became}} the nucleus of what would eventually evolve into the reconstituted Haitian army. The later politicization of the Haitian military has been attributed by some to Haiti's early experience with the Gendarmerie d'Haïti. The gendarmerie's special access to U.S. resources and influence vested in it a measure of social control within Haiti that would become institutionalized in later years. On the other hand, former Haitian President Prosper Avril has observed that Haiti <b>already</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> long tradition of military involvement in government prior to the occupation, with 25 of its 26 pre-occupation presidents being either military officers or leaders of rebel groups. Avrill also contends the gendarmerie worked to instill a respect for political neutrality in its men.|$|E
5|$|In late 1999, a {{group of}} men from Hamburg, Germany arrived in Afghanistan, {{including}} Mohamed Atta, Marwan al-Shehhi, Ziad Jarrah, and Ramzi bin al-Shibh. Bin Laden selected these men because they were educated, could speak English, and had experience living in the West. New recruits were routinely screened for special skills and al-Qaeda leaders consequently discovered that Hani Hanjour <b>already</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> commercial pilot's license. Mohammed later said that he helped the hijackers blend in by teaching them how to order food in restaurants and dress in Western clothing.|$|E
