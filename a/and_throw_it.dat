5|$|In 1634, another tale with a trickster cat as hero was {{published}} in Giambattista Basile's collection Pentamerone although neither the collection nor the tale were published in France during Perrault's lifetime. In Basile, the lad is a beggar boy called Gagliuso (sometimes Cagliuso) whose fortunes are achieved {{in a manner similar}} to Perrault's Puss. However, the tale ends with Cagliuso, in gratitude to the cat, promising the feline a gold coffin upon his death. Three days later, the cat decides to test Gagliuso by pretending to be dead and is mortified to hear Gagliuso tell his wife to take the dead cat by its paws <b>and</b> <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> out the window. The cat leaps up, demanding to know whether this was his promised reward for helping the beggar boy to a better life. The cat then rushes away, leaving his master to fend for himself. In another rendition, the cat performs acts of bravery, then a fairy comes and turns him to his normal state to be with other cats.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} agents arrive, {{revealing that}} Douchebag went into hiding to escape {{them because of}} his ability to quickly make friends on social networks such as Facebook, which the government wanted to use for its own ends. Learning of the Stick's supposed power, the chief agent takes it and bargains with Douchebag to help him use it. Douchebag refuses but Princess Kenny betrays the group, uses the Stick to fight them and infects himself with the Nazi Zombie virus. Unable to defeat Nazi Zombie Princess Kenny, Cartman tells Douchebag to break their sacred rule by farting on Kenny's balls, which he does. The resulting explosion defeats Kenny and cures the town of the Nazi Zombie virus. In the epilogue as South Park is rebuilt, the group retrieves the Stick of Truth; they decide its power is too great for any person to hold <b>and</b> <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> into Stark's Pond.|$|E

5|$|Skyscrapers in {{the sets}} were oblong cubes that were shot from an angle that exaggerated their height. To create {{the effect of}} {{sunlight}} glimmering off the buildings, one person would stand {{on one side of}} the cubes with a mirror, and another would stand on the opposite side with a light bulb and swing it back and forth, so the mirror could catch reflections of the swinging light <b>and</b> <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> back onto the skyscrapers. To create a sense of hysteria and excitement surrounding an opening night performance, a skyscraper was photographed with the camera swinging quickly up and down from side to side. While scenes from miniature sets were composed of long shots, scenes were actors were shot entirely in close-ups, which make up about 300 feet of the final film reel. Rather than attempting to put the actor into the miniature backgrounds through trick photography, the scenes were cut rapidly and successively, so the viewer first sees the actor and then the set, creating the impression they are in the same place. Sets involving actors were minimalistic, with some consisting of only a few elements like a table, telephone, two chairs, and a cigar.|$|E
5|$|Stengel, hired {{only days}} before spring training, had but a limited {{opportunity}} to shape his new ballclub. The Dodgers quickly settled into sixth place, {{where they would}} end the season. Stengel, in later years, enjoyed discussing one 1934 game in Philadelphia's Baker Bowl: with Dodger pitcher Boom-Boom Beck ineffective, Stengel {{went out to the}} mound to take out the angry pitcher, who, instead of giving Stengel the baseball, threw it into right field, where it hit the metal wall with a loud noise. The right fielder, Hack Wilson, lost in thought, heard the boom, assumed the ball had been hit by a batter, and ran to retrieve it <b>and</b> <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> to the infield, to be met by general laughter. Stengel got the last laughs on the Giants as well. The Giants, six games ahead of the Cardinals on Labor Day, dissipated that lead, and with two games in the season were tied with St. Louis—with the final two games against Brooklyn at the Polo Grounds, games played in front of raucous crowds, who well remembered Terry's comments. Brooklyn won both games, while the Cardinals won their two games against the Cincinnati Reds, and won the pennant. Richard Bak, in his biography of Stengel, noted that the victories over the Terry-led Giants represented personal vindication for the Dodger manager.|$|E
25|$|Participation {{required}} little organization, and had {{an element}} of spontaneity. Dina Matar, then 14, from the refugee camp of Dheisheh, recalls that one was told to watch the street, and then join in stone-throwing. At the same time, leaflets did circulate asserting that every child 'must carry the stone <b>and</b> <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> at the occupier'. School children in the Jenin Refugee Camp created a game where Jews used guns and Palestinians threw stones, with the latter always winning.|$|E

A player may also go Blind Nil In The Dark where they never even look at their cards. This is scored the same as a Big Mo. Nil In The Dark is usually only bid if they have no trump cards.|$|E
25|$|On February 16, 2017, Revis was {{involved}} in a street brawl in Pittsburgh around 2:40a.m. Revis was suspected to have attacked two men, knocking them unconscious. One follower attempted to record Revis on a cell phone, prompting Revis to snatch the phone <b>and</b> <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> out at the street. That night, Revis was charged for aggravated assault, robbery, terroristic threats and conspiracy stemming. Revis turned himself into police the following day and was released on non-monetary bond. All charges were dismissed March 15 after a friend of Revis testified that he was responsible for knocking the two men out.|$|E
25|$|P. snelleni {{exists in}} {{temperate}} locations, where cold and hot weather conditions can arise. When the temperature becomes hot, as it often does in Japan {{during the summer}} months when the P. snelleni nests are in existence, the paper wasps need to take measures to cool down the nest. Water transport to the nest occurs after the appearance of larvae, and once it starts, it occurs about 10-15 times in succession. Water drops are carried by the wasps and put on the concave nest roof. This aids in cooling the nest. When there is shade over the nest, the wasps move the water <b>and</b> <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> away.|$|E

25|$|When the cricket ball {{is inside}} the boundary, it is live. When the ball is {{touching}} the boundary, grounded beyond the boundary, or being touched by a fielder who is himself either touching the boundary or grounded beyond it, it is dead and the batting side usually scores 4 or 6 runs for hitting the ball over the boundary. Because of this rule, fielders near the boundary attempting to intercept the ball while running or diving, often flick the ball back in {{to the field of}} play rather than pick it up directly, because their momentum could carry them beyond the rope while holding the ball. They then return to the field to pick the ball up <b>and</b> <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> back to the bowler.|$|E
25|$|Collected Chirps will {{disperse}} if the their chain {{comes in}} contact with an enemy. Some of the chirps wear sunglasses; these chirps behave more unpredictably when dispersed. There are two enemy types in the standard rounds, house cats called Tigers and green iguanas called Iggys. These enemies can be simply avoided but can also be defeated with throwable items available on some levels. These items include telephones, flower pots, cups, and bottles. Flicky can pick up an item by walking into it, <b>and</b> <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> by jumping. Sometimes diamonds may appear, which cannot be thrown but rather provide bonus points. There are also bonus rounds in which Flicky attempts to catch as many falling Chirps as possible in a net.|$|E
25|$|Netball {{rules do}} not permit players to let their landing foot touch the ground again if it is lifted at all while in {{possession}} of the ball, so players can take 1.5 steps while holding the ball. Pivoting does not count as a step. Players are entitled to balance {{on the other foot}} if the landing foot is lifted. An infraction of this rule is usually called stepping or travelling , as in the similar rule in basketball. Consequently, the only way to move the ball towards the goal is to throw the ball to a teammate. The ball can be held by a player for less than three seconds at any time. A player may tap or deflect the ball, let it bounce and then take possession <b>and</b> <b>throw</b> <b>it.</b> The player cannot catch the ball with both hands, drop it and pick it up again; this is called a replayed ball. The duration before it is called a drop is determined by the umpire. These rules, combined with the restrictions on where one player of a particular position can move, ensure that everyone on the team is regularly involved in play.|$|E

25|$|Greg Madden {{is found}} dead weeks later. In {{the months that}} follow, Zach and Kendall enjoy their time with the newborn child. Problems arise here and there, but none {{like that of the}} Satin Slayer, a serial killer murdering the women of Fusion, a {{cosmetics}} company run by Kendall and her friends who helped to define it. The Satin Slayer takes Kendall hostage, and when it is revealed that the Satin Slayer is actually Zach's estranged father, Alexander Cambias, Sr., thought to be dead, but obviously still very much alive and that all he wanted is for Zach to have followed in his footsteps, Zach does everything in his power to save Kendall, as it all culminates on a balcony outside of a hotel room. Zach's father sets a contraption around Kendall's neck, which will kill her if its detonator goes off. Zach and Alexander struggle as Zach gets a hold of the detonator and will not let it go, even as he is shot in the arm by Alexander. Zach is able to sneak a spare knife from the sheath at his ankle <b>and</b> <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> hard enough at Alexander so that Alexander drops his gun. Zach rescues Kendall. He is determined to kill his father, but help soon arrives, and Alexander is sent to jail.|$|E
500|$|Elephants {{were widely}} used across the Indian subcontinent and South Asia {{as a method}} of execution. The English sailor Robert Knox, writing in 1681, {{described}} a method of execution by elephant which he had witnessed while being held captive in Sri Lanka. Knox says the elephants he witnessed had their tusks fitted with [...] "sharp Iron with a socket with three edges". After impaling the victim's body with its tusks, the elephant would [...] "then tear it in pieces, <b>and</b> <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> limb from limb".|$|E

[...] Dunlap {{was known for his}} range in getting to balls that others of his era could not, and he was reportedly able to dive for a ball and throw while lying on the ground with enough velocity to sting the first baseman's hand. Dunlap was ambidextrous and was able to catch and throw a baseball with the same skill and accuracy with either hand. Moreover, Dunlap reportedly never wore a glove.|$|E

500|$|By {{targeting}} Lincoln {{and his two}} immediate successors to the presidency, Booth {{seems to}} have intended to decapitate the Union government <b>and</b> <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> {{into a state of}} panic and confusion. The possibility of assassinating the Union Army's commanding general as well was foiled when Grant declined the theatre invitation at his wife's insistence. Instead, the Grants departed Washington by train that evening for a visit to relatives in New Jersey. Booth had hoped that the assassinations would create sufficient chaos within the Union that the Confederate government could reorganize and continue the war if one Confederate army remained in the field or, that failing, to avenge the South's defeat. In his 2005 analysis of Lincoln's assassination, Thomas Goodrich writes: ...|$|E
