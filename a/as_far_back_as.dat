5000|$|Behind the Screen is an American late-night weekly serial which {{aired on}} CBS (Fridays, 11:30 PM EST) from October 9, 1981 to January 8, 1982. It {{was created by}} David Jacobs (Dallas, Knots Landing) for CBS, which wanted to {{experiment}} with late night programming as a counterpoint to ABC and NBC's more successful efforts {{at that time of}} night. Drawing upon his experience with the prime-time serials, Behind the Screen was a dramatization of the goings-on at a fictional TV soap opera called Generations. This was not the first attempt to explore the concept of a [...] "soap within a soap" [...] as radio soaps had used the idea <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>back</b> <b>as</b> the 1940s (A Woman To Remember), and Ryan's Hope had used the idea for a story in the early 1980s.|$|R

2500|$|The {{anaphora}} or Eucharistic Prayer {{that is part}} of this liturgy is {{of particular}} interest, being one of the oldest in Christianity, possibly dating back to 3rd-century Edessa, even if the outline of the current form can be traced <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>back</b> only <b>as</b> the time of the Patriarch Mar Isho-Yab III in the 7th century.

50|$|The {{most popular}} {{hypothesis}} {{on the origin}} of Griko is the one by Gerhard Rohlfs and Georgios Hatzidakis, that Griko's roots go <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>back</b> in history <b>as</b> the time of the ancient Greek colonies in Southern Italy and Sicily in the eighth century BC. The Southern Italian dialect is thus considered to be the last living trace of the Greek elements that once formed Magna Graecia.|$|R

25|$|Deborah Gewertz (1981) {{studied the}} Chambri (called Tchambuli by Mead) in 1974–1975 {{and found no}} {{evidence}} of such gender roles. Gewertz states that <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>back</b> in history <b>as</b> there is evidence (1850s) Chambri men dominated over the women, controlled their produce and made all important political decisions. In later years there has been a diligent search for societies in which women dominate men, or for signs of such past societies, but none have been found (Bamberger, 1974).|$|R
5000|$|An Occupational Stratum {{containing}} microlithic {{tools and}} ceramics (less in numbers) were found below Lustrous Red Ware occupation(which is important ceramic of Post-Urban Phase of this arae) at this site.

60|$|The cathedral, though imperfect, is a {{noble and}} a curious monument: the choir is modern, {{that is to}} say, of Gothic workmanship, and only five hundred years old, while the main body is an antique rotunda, that dates more than twice <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>back,</b> or <b>as</b> {{remotely}} as the reign of Charlemagne himself. There is a circular gallery in it, around which the thrones of the Emperor and Electors were formerly placed, at the ceremonies of coronations. Each of these thrones was flanked by small antique columns, brought from Rome, but which {{during the reign of}} Napoleon, in the spirit of monopoly and desecration[23] that marked the era, had been transferred to Paris, where some of them are still seen standing in the gallery of the Tuileries. A chair that was found in Charlemagne's tomb stands in this gallery, and was long used as a throne for the Emperors.|$|R
5|$|Bitterness {{between the}} Assyrians and the Arabs was {{reported}} by British historians <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>back</b> <b>as</b> 1920. This was made worse by the British officers of the levies who encouraged the Assyrians {{to think that they}} were first-class troops, which had the effect of increasing the natural pride of the Assyrians. This, coupled {{with the fact that the}} British and Assyrian levies succeeded in suppressing Kurdish revolts when the Iraqi Army failed created an inferiority complex among some Iraqi corps towards the British and the Assyrians.|$|E
5|$|Centuries {{before the}} conquest of Sogdiana by the Achaemenid Empire of Persia, Sogdiana possessed a Bronze Age urban culture that was {{gradually}} displaced by the Indo-European migrations of the Iron Age. This large-scale migration included Eastern Iranian speaking peoples such as the Sogdians. The original Bronze Age towns appear in the archaeological record beginning with the settlement at Sarazm, Tajikistan, spanning <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>back</b> <b>as</b> the 4th millennium BC and then at Kök Tepe, near modern-day Bulungur, Uzbekistan, from at least the 15th century BC.|$|E
5|$|Chariots {{existed in}} the Minoan civilization, as they were {{inventoried}} on storage lists from Knossos in Crete, dating to around 1450 BC.

The high point of chariot use in China was in the Spring and Autumn period (770476 BC), although they continued in use up until the 2nd century BC.|$|E
40|$|Measurements {{have been}} carried out on the average {{radiocarbon}} activity of a sediment core of eupelagic chalk ooze and the agc of the lower boundary was calculated by integra-tion of the radiocarbon decay function.

50|$|The idea {{of using}} {{techniques}} developed in chemistry to study food {{is not a new}} one, for instance the discipline of food science has existed for many years. Kurti and This acknowledged this fact and though they decided that a new, organized and specific discipline should be created within food science that investigated the processes in regular cooking (as food science was primarily concerned with the nutritional properties of food and developing methods to process food on an industrial scale), there are several notable examples throughout history of investigations into the science of everyday cooking recorded <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>back</b> to 18th century.|$|R

I do not believe in fashions or theories. I want to be myself.” ...|$|R
