25|$|Using {{clues to}} retrace their steps, the trio travel to a {{hospital}} where they discover they were drugged with Rohypnol ("roofies"), causing their memory loss, and that {{they came to the}} hospital from a chapel. At the chapel, they learn that Stu married a stripper named Jade, despite being in a long-term relationship with his abusive, domineering girlfriend Melissa. Outside the chapel, the trio is attacked by gangsters saying they are looking for someone. They flee and visit Jade, discovering that she is the mother of the baby, whose real name is Tyler. They are then arrested by the police for stealing the police cruiser. After being told that the Mercedes has been impounded, the trio is released when they unknowingly volunteer to be targets for a taser demonstration. While driving the Mercedes, they discover a naked Chinese man named Leslie Chow in the trunk. Chow jumps out of the trunk, beats the trio up with a crowbar and flees. Alan confesses that he drugged their drinks to ensure they had <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>night,</b> believing the drug to be ecstasy.|$|E
25|$|Booth {{followed}} up his first career defeat with victory {{back at home}} beating Mark Reynolds in Coventry before getting a fight with the current holder of the British and Commonwealth flyweight titles Keith Knox. The fight due {{to take place in}} Belfast on 16 October 1999 would have both titles on the line with Booth eventually winning in the 10th round. The new champion defended his Commonwealth title first when in January 2000 he beat South African Abbey Mnisi. In November 2000 he put both titles on the line when defending against 8-0 prospect Ian Napa eventually winning a 12-round unanimous decision. In February 2001, he made the second defence of his Commonwealth belt knocking out Zimbabwean, Nogthula Tshabangu at the Harvey Hadden Leisure Centre in Nottingham. Booth's brother, Nicky, was also on the bill and defeated Adey Lewis with a seventh round stoppage to crown <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>night</b> for the brothers and a unique one in British boxing history in that {{it was the first time}} that two siblings had defended titles on the same night.|$|E

500|$|Ripken's 1999 {{season ended}} early due to injury {{when he was}} only nine hits away from joining the 3,000 hit club. He {{achieved}} the milestone early in the 2000 season in an April game against the Twins at the Metrodome when he singled off reliever Héctor Carrasco. Ripken had <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>night</b> at the plate, recording three hits, the third of which was the milestone. Ripken missed all of July and August with a back injury. He was selected to the All-Star Game but sat out due to the injury, marking the first All-Star Game that he missed since his rookie season. In 83 games, Ripken batted [...]256 (his lowest total since 1992) with 15 home runs and 56 RBI.|$|E
500|$|In addition, {{there were}} several {{connections}} with SNL: Fey, Morgan, Dratch, Bill Hader, Louis-Dreyfus, Parnell, and director McCarthy-Miller are all SNL alumni (fellow alumnus Will Ferrell was asked to reprise his recurring [...] "Bitch Hunter" [...] character, but had a scheduling conflict); the show was filmed in SNLs Studio 8H before a live audience; the ending sequence was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>night</b> from the cast while the credits scrolled (and the credits used the same font as SNL); and promos {{leading up to the}} episode were voiced by long-time SNL announcer Don Pardo. The music for the episode—both for the TGS sequences and incidental underscore—was provided live by the SNL house band under the direction of Fey's husband Jeff Richmond and Leon Pendarvis. Furthermore, long-time SNL producer Lorne Michaels attended the rehearsal and performances to give his advice. Each commercial break during the show was predicated on an emergency commercial break on TGS, including a fictional commercial and a fake NBC technical difficulties screen.|$|E
500|$|In April 1994, {{the label}} {{arranged}} her {{to fly to}} London and meet with producer Tom Bailey. They recorded the songs [...] "I Want You", [...] "Fly" [...] and [...] "Just Like Honey", which was later re-recorded by Keith Fernley of Bailey's group Babble with {{a different set of}} lyrics and became the song [...] "Father's Field". Lords used lyrics she had previously written in New Zealand based on her personal journals she kept since she was a child. After finishing her recording with Bailey, Lords wanted something with a harder edge to add another dimension to her album. She was introduced to producer Ben Watkins of the electronic group Juno Reactor and decided to incorporate more rave sound. Mainly inspired by the music she would hear at warehouse parties during her stay in London, Lords teamed up with American singer Wonder with whom she created the lyrics to the song [...] "Control". Lords later commented on the inspiration behind the album's sound: [...] "It was in England that I fell in love with techno music. I was working in the UK doing some modelling a couple of years ago, and I was sharing a flat with some other girls in South London. We were really broke, and the cheapest place to go and have <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>night</b> out were raves - you could get in for about three bucks. So I went to a lot of raves and clubs, and I {{fell in love with the}} music - it was something that wasn't happening in the States at the time." [...] Lords recorded three more songs with Watkins; [...] "Good-N-Evil", [...] "Outlaw Lover" [...] and [...] "Fallen Angel".|$|E

500|$|The {{bodies of}} six Viet Cong {{soldiers}} {{were also found}} by the Australians. Among the dead was the commander of C3 Company, D445 Battalion and his second-in-command, while others were identified as personnel from the command elements of the battalion and the heavy weapons company. Three of the dead were NVA soldiers, possibly from 275th Regiment, although this {{was not able to}} be confirmed. Many more bodies were thought to have been carried away, while one AK-47 assault rifle and a small quantity of ammunition and equipment was also located. The Viet Cong position was found to have been hastily prepared overnight, and consisted of well-sited, but shallow weapon pits rather than bunkers, approximately half of which had overhead protection. Assessed as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>night</b> defensive position rather than a position designed for a deliberate defensive battle, it had been laid out {{in the shape of a}} half-moon; by the fortunes of war B Company had directly assaulted into the centre of the position. Yet the flat terrain had offered good fields of fire, while the dense vegetation provided excellent concealment. The Australians believed that the Viet Cong had withdrawn to the east, and B Company subsequently patrolled through the [...] "Light Green" [...] up to the small village of Ap Gia Thanh, [...] east, supported by the APCs, hooking south along the jungle tracks towards the swamps along the Song Rai river. Although signs of heavy foot traffic were obvious the Viet Cong had long since left the area, while no evidence of blood trails or discarded equipment were found, indicating an orderly retirement from the battlefield. B Company returned to Nui Dat by 17:30, while the remainder of 6 RAR was extracted by helicopter. The last APCs from A Squadron finally returned by 20:10 that evening as Operation Bribie concluded.|$|E
2500|$|Boom Boom Room was Singapore's only drag queen cabaret nightclub {{and thought}} by many {{also to be}} Singapore's only real {{national}} institution in the same uninhibited spirit as the original Bugis Street.

2500|$|In The Guardian, Michael Billington {{gave the}} show {{three out of}} five stars, commenting, [...] "There is much to enjoy in Andrew Lloyd Webber's new musical. The score {{is one of the}} composer's most seductive." [...] However, Billington said, [...] "The {{problems}} lie within the book ... which lacks the weight to support the imaginative superstructure." [...] He continues, [...] "the staging is a constant source of iridescent pleasure. But, as one of the lyrics reminds us, [...] "diamonds never sparkle bright unless they are set just right". ... With a libretto to match the melodies, this might have been a stunner rather than simply <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>night</b> out". Tim Walker of The Sunday Telegraph praised the production for [...] "what are undoubtedly the most impressive special effects to be had in the West End" [...] and said the principals sang [...] "with gusto, charisma and sexiness." [...] Still, he found himself, [...] "yearning after a while for the big showstopper ... but it never came." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Aviators {{opened their}} {{season with a}} four-game series against the Orange County Breakers, who were {{returning}} to Southern California after playing the previous two seasons as the Austin Aces. When the Breakers last called Orange County their home in 2013, the Aviators had not yet moved to California and were known as the New York Sportimes. While the teams {{did not have any}} history as geographic rivals, the franchises did meet in the 2005 WTT Finals with the Sportimes earning the title with a 21–18 victory over the Newport Beach Breakers. The two franchises also boasted the best regular-season records in WTT over the past two seasons with the Aviators achieving the feat in 2014, and the Aces doing so in 2015. The Aviators and Breakers split the series with each team winning both of its home matches. The four matches in four nights quickly developed the feel of a rivalry. [...] "It definitely starts to get a little personal," [...] said the Breakers' Nicole Gibbs. [...] "Things got a little feisty tonight, so it was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>night</b> to bring the cameras. We were getting in each other's faces, and there were some big 'Come ons'. Definitely some emotional moments." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nine {{years have}} passed. The Stage Manager opens the act with a lengthy {{monologue}} emphasizing eternity, bringing the audience's {{attention to the}} cemetery outside of town and the characters who have died since the wedding, including Mrs. Gibbs (pneumonia, while traveling), Wally Webb (burst appendix, while camping), Mrs. Soames, and Simon Stimson (suicide by hanging). Town undertaker Joe Stoddard is introduced, as {{is a young man}} named Sam Craig who has returned to Grover's Corners for his cousin's funeral. That cousin is Emily, who died giving birth to her and George's second child. Once the funeral ends, Emily emerges to join the dead; Mrs. Gibbs urges her to forget her life, but she refuses. Ignoring the warnings of Simon, Mrs. Soames, and Mrs. Gibbs, Emily returns to Earth to relive one day, her 12th birthday. The memory proves too painful for her, and she realizes that every moment of life should be treasured. When she asks the Stage Manager if anyone truly understands the value of life while they live it, he responds, [...] "No. The saints and poets, maybe—they do some." [...] Emily returns to her grave next to Mrs. Gibbs and watches impassively as George kneels weeping over her. The Stage Manager concludes the play and wishes the audience <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>night.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In May 1960, Toole {{accepted}} a three-year fellowship {{to study for}} a Ph.D. in Renaissance literature at the University of Washington at Seattle. However, when he was offered a teaching position at Hunter College in New York, which suited his desire to study at Columbia, he chose to go there instead. At 22, he became the youngest professor in Hunter's history. Although he pursued a doctorate at Columbia, he became unhappy with his Ph.D. However, he wrote to Fletcher that he still liked Hunter, [...] "principally because the aggressive, pseudo-intellectual, 'liberal' girl students are continuously amusing." [...] Fletcher surmised that from these girls the character of Myrna Minkoff from Dunces was born. Toole, although generally only a [...] "Christmas-and-Easter churchgoer", had some apprehension about the anti-Catholic intellectualism {{of some of his}} students, and about them seeming ever watchful for a cause they could throw their liberal zeal behind. [...] "Every time the elevator door opens at Hunter, you are confronted by 20 pairs of burning eyes, 20 sets of bangs and everyone waiting for someone to push a Negro" [...] he is reported to have said. When he first arrived back in New York Toole dated Emilie Dietrich Griffin, another Louisiana transplant, with whom he had worked on the Hullabaloo staff, and later he dated another Louisianan, Clayelle Dalferes, whom he had learned of through Fletcher. The couple loved the cinema and movie-going was a constant staple of their dates. Both women said their relationships with Toole never progressed beyond the level of <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>night</b> kiss.|$|E
