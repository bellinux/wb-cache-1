40|$|Humor is {{the topic}} of many psychological, social, and {{cultural}} studies, but this project examines humor under a new lens. Humor 2 ̆ 7 s unique qualities explored in this study prove that humor is capable of more than just causing laughter; the nature of humor allows it to unveil truths about humanity, both spiritual and physical, through exposing man 2 ̆ 7 s flaws. This quality is especially important to consider when analyzing humor {{in the context of}} literature, in which humor also works <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>aesthetic</b> <b>element.</b> This study searches several short stories by Eudora Welty and Flannery O 2 ̆ 7 Connor along with Marilynne Robinson 2 ̆ 7 s Gilead to reveal that each author implements in her works the element of humor in her own style, making humor an integral component in her fiction. Considering the unique qualities of humor and recognizing humor <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>aesthetic</b> <b>element</b> in the selected works show that these authors use humor <b>as</b> more than <b>a</b> mere literary element; their uses of humor, though they vary in form, work to convey significant themes of redemption throughout their stories. The term redemption defined in this thesis refers to a new and truthful perspective that humor creates for the characters, audience, or both. Since this new perspective ultimately points to spiritual truths about man 2 ̆ 7 s nature, this discovery lends more credit to humor than other scholars have previously offered...|$|R

First, indirect methods were applied {{by means of}} a mapping procedure, which identified the physical components of major relevance.

Secondly, we developed direct methods to identify and describe the re-resentative elements of the landscape, analyzing the “perceived ” landscape. The identification and delimitation of these landscape units with geographical information systems provide detailed maps facilitate the tasks of planning and mana-gement.

5000|$|Emo Urbanism {{is another}} {{philosophy}} critical of Landscape Urbanism. The movement contends that Landscape Urbanism views ecology <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>aesthetic</b> <b>element</b> {{of style and}} not urban ecology. The artificial ecology replaces the entropic state to re-create a landscape that fits a particular brand or aesthetic. The loss is a dynamic, adaptive, and certainly essential urban system. Emo urbanism differs by making evolving [...] "nature" [...] {{a key component of}} the design process. The realization of this process is called “Urbanature" [...] and [...] "Big Nature." [...] As an evolving urban ecology, Charles Morris Anderson has described this connection as the “thinness.” It is the simultaneous perception and implicit understanding of the past, present, and future. Emo Urbanist projects include the built work of Charles Anderson at the Olympic Sculpture Park in Seattle, WA; The Anchorage Museum Common in Anchorage, AK; the yet to be constructed Project Phoenix in Haiti and Hellinikon's Metropolitan Park in Athens, Greece.|$|R
40|$|This essay investigates two aesthetically {{innovative}} Chinese American prose narratives, Crossings (1968) by Chuang Hua and Steer Toward Rock (2008) by Fae Myenne Ng, {{which have}} so far inspired relatively few scholarly readings. Although published forty years apart, both texts convey a melancholic image of displaced desires—loved ones who are lost, beyond reach, or unresponsive—that is echoed by their complex narrative structure and rich stylistic repertoire. Drawing from the psychoanalytically informed notion of racial melancholia, this essay argues that in Chuang’s Crossings and in Ng’s Steer Toward Rock the dynamics of melancholia manifest most prominently in the ways their dislocated characters negotiate between a melancholic desire to preserve a lost object of love, on one hand, and a persistent quest for an integrated sense of self, on the other. By examining their dislocated Asian American subjects, transnational love affairs, and melancholic desire, this essay suggests that both writers contribute to a particular aesthetics and ethics of melancholia, in which identificatory and narrative boundaries alike are contested and transgressed. It further argues that melancholia is present in these two narratives not only <b>as</b> <b>an</b> ethical or political construct but equally <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>aesthetic</b> <b>element</b> that significantly adds to the ethical import of Chuang’s and Ng’s fiction...|$|R

This invitation to present reflects the significance the international community attach to it. It is also published in the book Responsive Architectures. Vocal Voids pushes the boundaries of sonic knowledge within the fields of interactive acoustics, music composition and immersive sound/imagery. It combines the pioneering work of Thomas Funkhouser’s Interactive Acoustic Modelling (www. cs. princeton. edu/-funk) and Bose 3 D architectural software with interactive sonic visual mapping as created for the games industry by Luigi Agostini of See‘n’Sound (www. seensound. aegweb. com). Whilst Agostini’s system extracts in real-time 3 D movement from 2 D imagery through a MIDI algorithm and Funkhouser’s work enables a walk-through acoustic simulation of a virtual building in real-time, neither system assesses the potential for combining the two theorems into a new hybrid form where the sonic possibilities in adaptive acoustics could be simultaneously explored within a ‘musical’ context. By making this connection it opens up a new world of artistic expression especially in music where the MIDI language acts <b>as</b> <b>a</b> translation medium between the visual and musical construct. Importantly, MIDI code is the key in my research process to integrate a third vital element into the equation - computational generative music or music that adapts to external stimuli. Vocal Voids uniquely uses this trinity for a ‘composer’ to conduct a fly-through singing avatar in the exploration of spatial environs that can be acoustically manipulated on-the-fly <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>aesthetic</b> <b>element</b> in the music composition. This is a significant breakthrough in real-time acoustic performance within the virtual world, and whilst well received in the academic forum, its application in the wider context is on-going...|$|R

40|$|Architecture is {{inherently}} {{an art form}} {{of the body and}} all our senses. it creates a meaningful framework for the activities of the man by controlling and regulating the interrelationship between the man and his living environment Since architecture should be an occasion of making a place by adding continuous articulation of human habitat, the reproduction of freestanding buildings will become an environmental destruction. So, an architect, beyond the authentic artist, must engage to make concrete the ideal view of life. Architecture, as meaningful buildings, should communicate its meaning through the organization of elements, which are considered as timeless and fundamental vocabulary in architecture. However, the required state of mind or the mood in architectural spaces could be generated through various combinations and relationships of so called spatial volumes. In consideration of acoustics <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>aesthetic</b> <b>element,</b> the architect has before him the aesthetic problem of unfamiliar forms because, in architecture, beauty and familiarity are closely linked in a manner more binding than in other arts. However, in designing an acoustically favorable space, architect should recognize and use acoustic character as the basics of his idea. Although he has new materials, there is no other process of making it beautiful than the old process used by long ago by Greek Architects of contemplative design - emphasizing the essential character, economizing effects and adding ornaments. So, it is obvious that, the factors making for good or bad acoustics are not all new: some of them were most fundamental to buildings in old period and have been recognized in the past by acute designers such as the builders of Greek Theatres. When {{attention has been paid to}} special acoustic requirements, certain standard types of architecture have arisen such as classic theatres, the Leipzig concert hall, the Italian opera house, and the English House of Commons. These types have given satisfaction for generation So, the great history of architecture has to be touched to see the good performance of great architecture They have been created through symbolic and emotional ideas of their traditions and the culture.
