5|$|The Central Recreation Ground also hosted {{many games}} aside from Hastings Festival matches. Australian teams played <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> 18 times, with one match in 1878 {{involving}} a side with eighteen Hastings players, of whom six played for Kent, three played for Sussex and three played for Surrey. In a 1902 match between Sussex and Surrey <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> C.B. Fry and Joe Vine scored an opening partnership of 238 runs, and KS Ranjitsinhji scored the first double-century <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> as Sussex scored 705–8d, the highest total in a first-class match <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> The match also saw Surrey batsmen Bobby Abel and Thomas Hayward score an opening partnership of 246, the highest partnership ever {{for the first}} wicket in a match at the Central Recreation Ground. In 1908, a match took place <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> between an English 11 and the Melbourne Cricket Club. A first-class match between Sussex and Kent in 1984 ended in a tie. In the same year, the England women's cricket team played a 55 overs a side One Day International match against New Zealand. Jan Brittin scored 101, as England scored 194–8, and in reply New Zealand made 148–7. The last Sussex first-class match <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> took place in 1996.|$|E
5|$|The first Test century (100 or more runs in {{a single}} innings) scored <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> was by Australian Mark Taylor in the third innings of the first Test match against Sri Lanka in 1989. In the same innings Dean Jones and Steve Waugh also scored centuries. As of December 2015, 31 Test centuries have been scored <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> in 12 Test matches. As of December 2015, Adam Voges 269*, scored against West Indies in 2015, is the highest Test innings {{achieved}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and only the second double century (200 or more {{runs in a}} single innings) in this ground, after Ricky Ponting's 209, against Pakistan in 2010. The highest Test score by an overseas player is 192 by the Sri Lankan Kumar Sangakkara in 2007. Michael Hussey has scored three Test centuries <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> the most by any batsman.|$|E
5|$|A {{concrete}} wall was {{built at the}} Grosvenor Road End for over £3,000 in 1956, as a safety precaution and as a support for additional banking and terracing. These improvements saw capacity extended to 23,600. Two FA Cup ties against First Division opposition were held <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> in 1957–58: Birmingham City were beaten 3–0, followed by a 0–0 draw with Bolton Wanderers, which drew a capacity crowd of 23,600. Floodlights were installed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> {{in the summer of}} 1959, costing £14,500, a substantial part of which was raised by a supporters' club. They were officially switched on for a friendly against Newcastle United on 28 October 1959, which Newcastle won 8–2 before a crowd of 9,414.|$|E

5|$|Hampden Park was {{the biggest}} stadium in the world from its opening in 1903 until it was surpassed by the Maracanã in 1950. Along with Celtic Park and Ibrox, the city of Glasgow possessed the three largest {{football}} stadia {{in the world at}} the time Hampden opened. In the stadium's first match, on 31 October 1903, Queen's Park defeated Celtic 1–0 in the Scottish league. The first Scottish Cup Final played <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> was an Old Firm match in 1904, attracting a record Scottish crowd of 64,672. The first Scotland v England match <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> was played in April 1906 with 102,741 people in attendance, which established Hampden as the primary home of the Scotland team.|$|E
5|$|In the match, Zimbabwe batted first, and {{the public}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> {{were not aware of}} the protest until the 22nd over, when Flower came out to bat wearing a black armband. Olonga was also seen wearing a black armband on the Zimbabwe team balcony. The crowd of 4,000 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> were {{supportive}} of the protest, and a number of them made their own black armbands during the match. In the match itself, Flower scored 39, as Zimbabwe reached 340/2, and Olonga took 0/8 in 3 overs, as Zimbabwe won a rain-affected match by 86 runs (D/L method).|$|E

5|$|The Central Recreation Ground was a cricket {{ground in}} Hastings, East Sussex, used for {{first-class}} and List A cricket between 1864 and 1996. The ground was frequently used by Sussex County Cricket Club {{as one of}} their outgrounds from 1865; in total, Sussex played 143 first-class and 17 List A matches <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Between 1887 and the 1960s, the Central Recreation Ground also played host to the Hastings & St Leonards cricket festival, which attracted many other teams and notable players. In the early twentieth century, the ground hosted seven Gentlemen v Players matches, and notable players to have played <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> include W.G. Grace, Don Bradman, Jack Hobbs and Denis Compton. Grace made over 40 appearances <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> whilst both Hobbs and Compton broke the record for most first-class centuries in a season at the Central Recreation Ground. The ground also hosted a women's one-day international between England and New Zealand in 1984. In the 1980s, planning permission was given for the ground be demolished, and the land used to build a shopping centre. After the demolition of the ground in 1996, the Priory Meadow Shopping Centre was built on the site.|$|E

40|$|Marine ice {{sheets are}} {{continental}} ice masses resting on bedrock below sea level. Their dynamics {{are similar to}} those of land-based ice sheets except that they must couple with the surrounding floating ice shelves <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounding</b> line, where <b>the</b> ice reaches a critical flotation thickness. In order to predict the evolution of the ground-ing line as a free boundary, two boundary conditions are required for the diffusion equation describing the evolution of the grounded-ice thickness. By analogy with Stefan problems, one of these conditions imposes a prescribed ice thickness <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounding</b> line and arises from the fact that the ice becomes afloat. The other condition must be determined by coupling the ice sheet to the surrounding ice shelves. Here we employ matched asymptotic expansions to study the transition from ice-sheet to ice-shelf flow for the case of rapidly sliding ice sheets. Our principal results are that <b>the</b> ice flux <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounding</b> line in a two-dimensional ice sheet is an increasing function of the depth of the sea floor there, and that ice thicknesses <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounding</b> line must be small compared with ice thicknesses inland. These results indicate that marine ice sheets have a discrete set of steady surface profiles (if they have any at all) and that the stability of these steady profiles depends on the slope of <b>the</b> sea floor <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounding</b> line. 1...|$|R

5|$|By {{the late}} 1990s the West Indian team {{had begun to}} decline. It was {{defeated}} by Australia in a 1994–95 series, the Third Test of which was played at the Queen's Park Oval, as {{were two of the}} ODI matches. The ground hosted two Tests of the 1997–98 tour by England, the second of which in February saw the West Indies defeated by England. The West Indian captain during the match, Brian Lara, went on to be the leading run scorer at the Queen's Park Oval in ODI matches, as well as hold record for the highest score made there. The West Indies lost heavily again to Australia <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> in 1999, by a margin of 312 runs. This, the opening Test of the series, set the tone for a five-nil whitewash of the host team by the visiting Australians. The retirement of Ambrose and Courtney Walsh in 2001 further hampered West Indian efforts, and they were defeated at the Queen's Park Oval by South Africa in March, and India in August 2001. They were likewise defeated in ODI matches <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> by both sides. The West Indies dropped to eighth in the Test rankings, with another heavy loss at the Queen's Park Oval against England in 2004, amid complaints {{about the quality of the}} pitch from England players. The West Indies also suffered at the hands of South Africa during ODI matches played <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|E
