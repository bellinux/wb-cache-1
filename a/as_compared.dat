The sample of 250 (125 working and 125 non-working) women were recruited from different areas of Karachi through purposive sampling technique. Their age ranged between 28 years to 45 years (mean age = 34. 126; SD= 4. 129). For working women different organizations were approached to collect the data. After taking informed consent on individual basis, Zeab Insecurity Scale, Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale and Depression Anxiety and stress Scale (DASS, 1995) were administered on the participant women. The sample of control group was taken by convenient sampling and same scales were administered individually. The data was statistically analyzed through SPSS.

40|$|The present work aim was “Formulation Strategy for Dissolution Enhancement of Simvastatin”. Simvastatin is lipid {{lowering}} drug {{which is}} known as HMG CoA reductase. The objective {{of this study was}} to increase the solubility of poorly water soluble drug, namely simvastatin, by the formation of solid dispersion and complex and also using the microwave induction technique on these formations. For solid dispersion method dispersion carrier used were poloxamer 407 and gelucire 44 / 14. The fusion method was used to prepare the dispersions. For inclusion complexation method β-cyclodextrin derivative of cyclodextrin was used to prepare complex with drug. Kneading method was used for formulation. After completion of these two techniques these polymers were used for the microwave induced fusion method. All the ratio of drug and polymer were used to heat for different time interval. These samples were used for solubility measurement. In the solid dispersion technique, simvastatin show higher increase in solubility with gelucire 44 / 14 in the ratio of 1 : 5 <b>as</b> <b>compare</b> to poloxamer 407.
