Since the beginning of 1945, 77 people had been killed in accidents in aircraft operated by <b>ANA.</b> In late 1948, <b>ANA</b> suffered 4 crashes in 4 months. The loss of ANA's reputation as a safe airline, together with the unblemished safety record and growing commercial success of its rival Trans Australia Airlines, sent <b>ANA</b> into decline. In 1957 <b>ANA</b> was taken over by Ansett Transport Industries Limited and merged with Ansett Airways to form the domestic airline Ansett-ANA.|$|E

5|$|<b>ANA</b> was of {{the opinion}} that if a small amount of water entered a fuel tank during {{refuelling}} it would only reach the drain cocks when the aircraft was in level flight so it could not be detected immediately after re-fuelling. For 15 years <b>ANA</b> had operated in the knowledge that the only satisfactory time to check fuel tanks for the presence of water was prior to the first flight of the day, after the aircraft had been stationary overnight. Throughout this time <b>ANA</b> checked fuel tanks for the presence of water prior to the first flight of the day.|$|E

5|$|Below Prado Dam, the Santa <b>Ana</b> River crosses into Orange County, {{and cuts}} between the Santa <b>Ana</b> Mountains and Chino Hills via the narrow Santa <b>Ana</b> Canyon. The river roughly bisects the county as it flows {{southwest}} towards the ocean. In Anaheim, the entire {{flow of the}} river (except during wet seasons) is diverted into spreading grounds for groundwater recharge of the north Orange County aquifer, providing {{about half of the}} county's municipal water supply. Downstream of there, the river is mostly confined to a concrete channel, serving only for flood control and urban runoff drainage, and is usually dry or a small trickle. At Orange it receives Santiago Creek from the east before entering Santa <b>Ana.</b> After crossing under Interstate 5 it passes through the River View Golf Course, one of its few non-concreted sections within Orange County, and then becomes a concrete channel again through most of Santa <b>Ana</b> and Fountain Valley to a point below the 405 Freeway, where the river bed becomes natural (though the banks remain concrete). The mouth of the river is located in a small tidal lagoon between Huntington Beach and Costa Mesa, at the northern end of Santa <b>Ana</b> River County Beach.|$|E

5|$|By August16, {{the forward}} motion of <b>Ana</b> began to increase, and the storm quickly entered {{a region of}} dry, stable air. By the afternoon, a Hurricane Hunter {{reconnaissance}} mission {{did not find any}} evidence of tropical storm-force winds, resulting in <b>Ana</b> being downgraded to a tropical depression. It was determined in post-storm analysis, that <b>Ana</b> had degenerated into a tropical wave shortly afterwards, and was no longer a tropical cyclone. Several hours later, the system redeveloped convection as it raced towards the west-northwest at 26mph (42km/h). Early on August17, radar imagery from Guadeloupe and San Juan, Puerto Rico depicted a system without a closed, low-level circulation. Despite this, the NHC continued operational advisories until confirmation could be made with visible satellite imagery. Later that day, a final reconnaissance plane flew into the storm and did not find a low-level circulation. Following this, the NHC stated that <b>Ana</b> had dissipated off the coast of Puerto Rico, despite having already degenerated into a tropical wave the previous day. The remnants of <b>Ana</b> were once more monitored for signs of regeneration, but land interaction with Hispaniola and Cuba spoiled the system's chances of redevelopment.|$|E
5|$|One {{proposal}} considered was {{to merge}} JAL with <b>ANA,</b> which {{would create a}} single larger international airline and replace Japan Airlines International; however, media reports suggested that this proposal would be opposed by <b>ANA</b> given its comparatively better financial performance as an independent carrier.

5|$|Tropical Storm <b>Ana</b> was {{the first}} named storm of the 2009 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season and the first tropical cyclone to impact the Caribbean islands during 2009. Forming out of an {{area of low pressure}} associated with a tropical wave on August11, <b>Ana</b> briefly attained tropical storm intensity on August12 before weakening back to a depression. The following day, the system degenerated into a non-convective remnant low as it tracked westward. On August14, the depression regenerated roughly 1,075mi (1,735km) east of the Leeward Islands. Early on August15, the storm re-attained tropical storm status, at which time it was named <b>Ana.</b> After reaching a peak intensity with winds of 40mph (65km/h) and a barometric pressure of 1003mbar (hPa; 29.65inHg), the storm began to weaken again due to increasing levels of wind shear and the unusually fast movement of <b>Ana.</b> In post-storm analysis, it was discovered that <b>Ana</b> had degenerated into a tropical wave once more on August16, before reaching any landmasses.|$|E
