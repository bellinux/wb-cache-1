Brown initially rebuffed an offer, but after further discussions with the club Brown resigned as manager at Motherwell to be announced <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> manager at Aberdeen two days later.

5|$|At {{the end of}} the play, {{the actors}} file out slowly (most {{important}} first, with gaps between actors), and while they are on the bridge (hashigakari), the audience claps restrainedly. Between actors, clapping ceases, then begins again <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> actor leaves. Unlike in western theatre, there is no bowing, nor do the actors return to the stage after having left. A play may end with the shite character leaving the stage as part of the story (as in Kokaji, for instance)—rather than ending with all characters on stage—in which case one claps as the character exits.|$|E
5|$|Charles Anthoni Brooke succeeded {{his uncle}} in 1868 <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> White Rajah. Under his rule, Sarawak gained Limbang and the Baram and Trusan valleys from the Sultan of Brunei, later {{becoming}} a protectorate in 1888 with Britain handling foreign affairs but the Brooke government retaining administrative powers. Domestically, Brooke established the Sarawak Museum – the oldest museum in Borneo – in 1891, and brokered a peace in Marudi by ending intertribal wars there. Economic development continued, with oil wells drilling from 1910 and the Brooke Dockyard opening two years later. Anthony Brooke, {{who would become}} Rajah Muda (heir apparent) in 1939, was born in 1912.|$|E

5|$|In April 2011, {{media reports}} linked Brown {{with the role}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> {{managing}} director of the International Monetary Fund following the scheduled retirement of Dominique Strauss-Kahn. Brown's successor and Leader of the Opposition, Ed Miliband, supported Brown for the role while the Prime Minister, David Cameron, voiced opposition to this. Following the arrest of Strauss-Kahn for alleged sexual assault in May 2011, and his subsequent resignation, these reports re-surfaced. Support for Brown among economists was mixed but British Government backing for his candidature was not forthcoming and instead supported Christine Lagarde – the eventual successful candidate – for the post.|$|E

When it was suggested that a monk should hold Canterbury, as had been the custom previously, Hilary asked if the questioners thought that only one way of life was satisfactory to God.|$|E
