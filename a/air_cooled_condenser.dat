40|$|R&D Dynamics, Bloomfield, CT in {{partnership}} with the State of Connecticut has been developing a high technology, oil-free, energy-efficient centrifugal compressor called CENVA for commercial air conditioning systems under a program funded by the US Department of Energy. The CENVA compressor applies the foil bearing technology used in all modern aircraft, civil and military, air conditioning systems. The CENVA compressor will enhance the efficiency of water and <b>air</b> <b>cooled</b> chillers, packaged roof top units, and other air conditioning systems by providing an 18 % reduction in energy consumption in the unit capacity range of 25 to 350 tons of refrigeration The technical approach for CENVA involved the design and development of a high-speed, oil-free foil gas bearing-supported two-stage centrifugal compressor, CENVA encompassed the following high technologies, which are not currently utilized in commercial air conditioning systems: Foil gas bearings operating in HFC- 134 a; Efficient centrifugal impellers and diffusers; High speed motors and drives; and System integration of above technologies. Extensive design, development and testing efforts were carried out. Significant accomplishments achieved under this program are: (1) A total of 26 builds and over 200 tests were successfully completed with successively improved designs; (2) Use of foil gas bearings in refrigerant R 134 a was successfully proven; (3) A high speed, high power permanent magnet motor was developed; (4) An encoder was used for signal feedback between motor and controller. Due to temperature limitations of the encoder, the compressor could not operate at higher speed and in turn at higher pressure. In order to alleviate this problem a unique sensorless controller was developed; (5) This controller has successfully been tested as stand alone; however, it has not yet been integrated and tested as a system; (6) The compressor successfully operated at water <b>cooled</b> <b>condensing</b> temperatures Due to temperature limitations of the encoder, it could not be operated at <b>air</b> <b>cooled</b> <b>condensing</b> temperatures.

40|$|In {{power plant}} {{locations}} with adequate supply of cooling water the steam from the steam turbine is condensed {{in a water}} cooled condenser. In most instances circulating water from the cooling tower is used to condense the turbine exhaust steam.

In water challenged locations or locations where wet cooling cannot be deployed due to permitting or regulatory issues, the steam from the steam turbine is condensed in an <b>air</b> <b>cooled</b> <b>condenser</b> (ACC) wherein ambient air is used to cool and condense the turbine exhaust steam. In a combined cycle plant, during normal operation, the water or <b>air</b> <b>cooled</b> <b>condenser</b> condenses the turbine exhaust steam.

During the heating seasons, the system works in reverse. Instead of discharging the heat into the exhaust airstream, the system draws heat from the exhaust airstream in order to pre-heat the incoming air. At this stage, the air passes through a primary unit and then into a space.

The purpose of research is to find substances with the best thermodynamic, thermal and environmental properties. Research conducted {{on the basis of the}} analysis of thermodynamic and thermal properties of substances from the base "REFPROP" and with the help of numerical simulation of combined-cycle plant utilization triple cycle, where the lower cycle is an organic Rankine cycle. Base "REFPROP" describes and allows to calculate the thermodynamic and thermophysical parameters of most of the main substances used in production processes. On the basis of scientific publications on the use of working fluids in an organic Rankine cycle analysis were selected ozone-friendly low-boiling substances: ammonia, butane, pentane and Freon: R 134 a, R 152 a, R 236 fa and R 245 fa. For these substances have been identified and tabulated molecular weight, temperature of the triple point, boiling point, at atmospheric pressure, the parameters of the critical point, the value of the derivative of the temperature on the entropy of the saturated vapor line and the potential ozone depletion and global warming. It was also identified and tabulated thermodynamic and thermophysical parameters of the steam and liquid substances in a state of saturation at a temperature of 15 °C. This temperature is adopted as the minimum temperature of heat removal in the Rankine cycle when working on the water. Studies have shown that the best thermodynamic, thermal and environmental properties of the considered substances are pentane, butane and R 245 fa.

50|$|One type {{of solar}} {{desalination}} unit is a solar still, {{it is also}} similar to a condensation trap. A solar still is a simple way of distilling water, using {{the heat of the}} Sun to drive evaporation from humid soil, and ambient <b>air</b> to <b>cool</b> a <b>condenser</b> film. Two basic types of solar stills are box and pit stills. In a solar still, impure water is contained outside the collector, where it is evaporated by sunlight shining through clear plastic. The pure water vapor <b>condenses</b> on the <b>cool</b> inside plastic surface and drips down from the weighted low point, where it is collected and removed. The box type is more sophisticated. The basic principles of solar water distillation are simple, yet effective, as distillation replicates the way nature makes rain. The sun's energy heats water to the point of evaporation. As the water evaporates, water vapor rises, condensing on the glass surface for collection. This process removes impurities, such as salts and heavy metals, and eliminates microbiological organisms. The end result is water cleaner than the purest rainwater.|$|R
