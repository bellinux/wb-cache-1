40|$|Rapid {{activation}} of phospholipase A (PLA) by auxin or plant-pathogen interaction suggests a function in signal transduction for this enzyme, but the molecular {{identification of a}} cytosolic PLA carrying out this function remains open. We isolated four cDNA sequences from Arabidopsis (ecotype Columbia), <b>AtPLA</b> I, <b>AtPLA</b> IIA, <b>AtPLA</b> IVA, and <b>AtPLA</b> IVC, which {{are members of the}} patatin-related PLA gene family in plants and which are homologous to the animal Ca 2 +-independent PLA 2 gene family. Expression was measured by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and <b>AtPLA</b> I transcripts were found preferentially in shoots, <b>AtPLA</b> IIA and <b>AtPLA</b> IVA in roots, and <b>AtPLA</b> IVC in flowers. Transient expression of the four PLA-green fluorescent protein fusion proteins in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) leaves showed they were located in the cytosol and not in the vacuoles. Surprisingly, AtPLA::green fluorescent protein was also localized to chloroplasts. The enzymatic activity of the purified recombinant <b>AtPLA</b> IVA toward phosphatidylcholine was dependent on Ca 2 +, saturated at 0. 5 mm, and had a pH optimum of about 7. 0. It had both PLA 1 and PLA 2 specificity. The enzyme showed in vitro highest sensitivity toward the PLA 2 inhibitors palmitoyltrifluoromethyl ketone (PACOCF 3, Ki approximately 30 nm), arachidonyltrifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF 3, Ki approximately 25 μm), and tetrahydro- 3 -(1 -naphtalenyl) - 2 H-pyran- 2 -one (Ki approximately 200 nm) and was also sensitive to other previously used inhibitors 5, 8, 11, 14 -eicosatetraynoic acid (Ki approximately 3 μm) and nordihydroguajaretic acid (Ki approximately 15 μm). The influence of these PLA 2 inhibitors on elongation in etiolated Arabidopsis seedlings was tested, and tetrahydro- 3 -(1 -naphtalenyl) - 2 H-pyran- 2 -one and 5, 8, 11, 14 -eicosatetraynoic acid inhibited hypocotyl elongation maximally at concentrations close to their Ki in vitro...|$|E
40|$|In {{contrast}} to the well characterized secreted phospholipases A 2 (sPLA 2) from animals, their homologues from plants have been less explored. Their production in purified form is more difficult, and no data on their stability are known. In the present paper, different variants of the sPLA 2 isoform from Arabidopsis thaliana (<b>AtPLA</b> 2) were designed using a new homology model with the aim to probe the impact of regions that {{are assumed to be}} important for stability and catalysis. Moreover tryptophan residues were introduced in critical regions to enable stability studies by fluorescence spectroscopy. The variants were expressed in Escherichia coli and the purified enzymes were analyzed to get first insights into the peculiarities of structure stability and structure activity relationships in plant sPLA 2 s in comparison with the well-characterized homologous enzymes from bee venom and porcine pancreas. Stability data of the <b>AtPLA</b> 2 variants obtained by fluorescence or CD measurements of the reversible unfolding by guanidine hydrochloride and urea showed that all enzyme variants are less stable than the enzymes from animal sources although a similar tertiary core structure can be assumed based on molecular modeling. More extended loop structures at the N-terminus in <b>AtPLA</b> 2 are suggested to be the main reasons for the much lower thermodynamic stabilities and cooperativities of the transition curves. Modifications in the N-terminal region (insertion, deletion, substitution by a Trp residue) exhibited a strong positive effect on activity whereas amino acid exchanges in other regions of the protein such as the Ca 2 +-binding loop and the loop connecting the two central helices were deleterious with respect to activity...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, due {{to growing}} {{environmental}} awareness, considerable {{attention has been}} given to the development and production of natural fibre reinforced polymer (both thermoset and thermoplastic) composites. The main objective {{of this study was to}} reinforce epoxy and polylactic acid (PLA) with hemp fibre to produce improved composites by optimising the fibre treatment methods, composite processing methods, and fibre/matrix interfacial bonding. An investigation was conducted to obtain a suitable fibre alkali treatment method to: (i) remove non-cellulosic fibre components such as lignin (sensitive to ultra violet (UV) radiation) and hemicelluloses (sensitive to moisture) to improve long term composites stability (ii) roughen fibre surface to obtain mechanical interlocking with matrices (iii) expose cellulose hydroxyl groups to obtain hydrogen and covalent bonding with matrices (iv) separate the fibres from their fibre bundles to make the fibre surface available for bonding with matrices (v) retain tensile strength by keeping fibre damage to a minimum level and (vi) increase crystalline cellulose by better packing of cellulose chains to enhance the thermal stability of the fibres. An empirical model was developed for fibre tensile strength (TS) obtained with different treatment conditions (different sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and sodium sulphite (Na 2 SO 3) concentrations, treatment temperatures, and digestion times) by a partial factorial design. Upon analysis of the alkali fibre treatments by single fibre tensile testing (SFTT), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), zeta potential measurements, differential thermal analysis/thermogravimetric analysis (DTA/TGA), wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXRD), lignin analysis and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, a treatment consisting of 5 wt% NaOH and 2 wt% Na 2 SO 3 concentrations, with a treatment temperature of 120 oC and a digestion time of 60 minutes, was found to give the best combination of the required properties. This alkali treatment produced fibres with an average TS and Young's modulus (YM) of 463 MPa and 33 GPa respectively. The fibres obtained with the optimised alkali treatment were further treated with acetic anhydride and phenyltrimethoxy silane. However, acetylated and silane treated fibres were not found to give overall performance improvement. Cure kinetics of the neat epoxy (NE) and 40 wt% untreated fibre/epoxy (UTFE) composites were studied and it was found that the addition of fibres into epoxy resin increased the reaction rate and decreased the curing time. An increase in the nucleophilic activity of the amine groups in the presence of fibres is believed to have increased the reaction rate of the fibre/epoxy resin system and hence reduced the activation energies compared to NE. The highest interfacial shear strength (IFSS) value for alkali treated fibre/epoxy (ATFE) samples was 5. 2 MPa which was larger than the highest value of 2. 7 MPa for UTFE samples supporting that there was a stronger interface between alkali treated fibre and epoxy resin. The best fibre/epoxy bonding was found for an epoxy to curing agent ratio of 1 : 1 (E 1 C 1) followed by epoxy to curing agent ratios of 1 : 1. 2 (E 1 C 1. 2), 1 : 0. 8 (E 1 C 0. 8), and finally for 1 : 0. 6 (E 1 C 0. 6). Long and short fibre reinforced epoxy composites were produced with various processing conditions using vacuum bag and compression moulding. A 65 wt% untreated long fibre/epoxy (UTLFE) composite produced by compression moulding at 70 oC with a TS of 165 MPa, YM of 17 GPa, flexural strength of 180 MPa, flexural modulus of 10. 1 GPa, impact energy (IE) of 14. 5 kJ/m 2, and fracture toughness (KIc) of 5 MPa. m 1 / 2 was found to be the best in contrast to the trend of increased IFSS for ATFE samples. This is considered to be due to stress concentration as a result of increased fibre/fibre contact with the increased fibre content in the ATFE composites compared to the UTFE composites. Hygrothermal ageing of 65 wt% untreated and alkali treated long and short fibre/epoxy composites (produced by curing at 70 oC) showed that long fibre/epoxy composites were more resistant than short fibre/epoxy composites and ATFE composites were more resistant than UTFE composites towards hygrothermal ageing environments as revealed from diffusion coefficients and tensile, flexural, impact, fracture toughness, SEM, TGA, and WAXRD test results. Accelerated ageing of 65 wt% UTLFE and alkali treated long fibre/epoxy (ATLFE) composites (produced by curing at 70 oC) showed that ATLFE composites were more resistant than UTLFE composites towards hygrothermal ageing environments as revealed from tensile, flexural, impact, KIc, SEM, TGA, WAXRD, FTIR test results. IFSS obtained with untreated fibre/PLA (UFPLA) and alkali treated fibre/PLA (<b>ATPLA)</b> samples showed that <b>ATPLA</b> samples had greater IFSS than that of UFPLA samples. The increase in the formation of hydrogen bonding and mechanical interlocking of the alkali treated fibres with PLA could be responsible for the increased IFSS for <b>ATPLA</b> system compared to UFPLA system. Long and short fibre reinforced PLA composites were also produced with various processing conditions using compression moulding. A 32 wt% alkali treated long fibre PLA composite produced by film stacking with a TS of 83 MPa, YM of 11 GPa, flexural strength of 143 MPa, flexural modulus of 6. 5 GPa, IE of 9 kJ/m 2, and KIc of 3 MPa. m 1 / 2 was found to be the best. This could be due to the better bonding of the alkali treated fibres with PLA. The mechanical properties of this composite have been found to be the best compared to the available literature. Hygrothermal and accelerated ageing of 32 wt% untreated and alkali treated long fibre/PLA composites <b>ATPLA</b> composites were more resistant than UFPLA composites towards hygrothermal and accelerated ageing environments as revealed from diffusion coefficients and tensile, flexural, impact, KIc, SEM, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), WAXRD, and FTIR results. Increased potential hydrogen bond formation and mechanical interlocking of the alkali treated fibres with PLA could be responsible for the increased resistance of the <b>ATPLA</b> composites. Based on the present study, it can be said that the performance of natural fibre composites largely depend on fibre properties (e. g. length and orientation), matrix properties (e. g. cure kinetics and crystallinity), fibre treatment and processing methods, and composite processing methods...|$|E
40|$|Na,K-ATPase al subunit gene (<b>ATPlA</b> 1) {{is one of}} the {{housekeeping}} genes {{involved in}} homeostasis of Na+ and K+ in all animal cells. We identified and characterized the cis-acting elements that regulate the expression ofATPAL 1. The region between- 155 and- 49 was determined as a positive regulatory region in five cultured cell lines of different tissue origins (MDCK, B 103, L 6, 3 Y 1, and HepG 2). The region was divided into three subregions: from- 120 to- 106 (including the Spl binding site), from- 102 to- 61, and from- 58 to- 49 (including an Spl consensus sequence). Cell type-specific factors binding to the middle subregion (from- 102 to- 61) were detected by gel retardation analysis, using nuclear extracts prepared from MDCK and B 103 cells. Two gel retardation complexes were formed in the B 103 nuclear extract, and three were formed in the MDCK nuclear extract. DNA binding regions of these factors were located at- 88 to- 69 and differed from each other in DNase I footprinting experiments. These factors also showed different binding characteristics in gel retardation competition and methylation interference experiments. The identified cis element was named the ATPL 1 A regulatory element. The core sequence of this element is found in several other genes involved in cellular energy metabolism, suggesting that the sequence is a common regulatory element responsive to the state of energy metabolism. Na,K-ATPase is an integral membrane protein which i...|$|E
