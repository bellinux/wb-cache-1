5|$|Springfield is in {{the midst}} of a massive heat wave. Every {{building}} in the town has installed a large air conditioning device. However, this draws <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> from the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. Despite the safety measures Mr. Burns has taken (cutting power to the orphanage), the plant is at full power. At home, without an air conditioning device, the Simpsons have to follow an old-fashioned fan. Homer decides to give them a taste of winter by plugging in his dancing Santa Claus. This overloads the plant and causes a town-wide blackout. Eventually, widespread rioting and looting occur. The police try to intervene, but are powerless to stop the massive crime wave.|$|E

He learns that the man in the picture was extremely wealthy and lucky for a short period, before he died with a giant oversized penis. Mulder believes the woman in the picture is responsible for everything, and determines she is a jinniyah, or a female jinn. Mulder goes to the Stokes residence and asks Leslie to hand her over, presuming her to be kept in a box. It turns out, however, that she is not in the box, but back in the storage facility, where Mulder also finds pictures of the jinniyah next to Benito Mussolini in the 1930s and next to Richard Nixon in the 1960s, two men that had <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> and lost it in a bad way.|$|E

25|$|Initially {{there were}} hopes that post-occupation Iran {{could become a}} {{constitutional}} monarchy. The new, young Shah Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi initially took a very hands-off role in government, and allowed parliament to hold <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>power.</b> Some elections were held in the first shaky years, although they remained mired in corruption. Parliament became chronically unstable, and from the 1947 to 1951 period Iran saw {{the rise and fall}} of six different prime ministers. Pahlavi increased his political power by convening the Iran Constituent Assembly, 1949, which finally formed the Senate of Iran—a legislative upper house allowed for in the 1906 constitution but never brought into being. The new senators were largely supportive of Pahlavi, as he had intended.|$|E
25|$|Because of the unorthodox {{nature of}} hand and body position, {{it is often}} {{difficult}} to get <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> behind a reverse sweep; in many situations, the intention is to glance or cut the ball to the backward leg area. However, in rare occasions, players have been able to execute reverse sweeps for a six. Kevin Pietersen, who pioneered switch hitting, is adept at this, but one could argue that the resulting shot is basically a sweep rather than a reverse sweep. A more classic example of such a shot would be Yusuf Pathan's six off Robin Peterson. South Africa's AB de Villiers is well known for his ability to hit sixes with the reverse sweep at ease and Glenn Maxwell also often plays reverse sweep.|$|E

25|$|Nasser, by contrast, {{thought that}} {{any talk of}} democracy, or of a multi-party system, or of the {{withdrawal}} of the army from politics, would allow the Wafd, the Muslim Brotherhood and the other political parties to regain the ground they had lost in 1952. In addition, although on paper Naguib appeared to wield <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>power,</b> being simultaneously president and prime minister, his authority was curtailed {{by the fact that he}} needed a majority vote of the RCC for any decision to be taken, and his opinion was often ignored by the other members of the RCC. The offices he occupied meant that Naguib was responsible for the government's decisions, even though he rarely sanctioned or supported them, and this meant that he was increasingly becoming merely the puppet of others. Eventually, Naguib presented Nasser, by now the real power in the RCC, with an ultimatum: either he was given real power, or he would resign.|$|E
25|$|Mirroring the {{historical}} political {{conflicts between the}} freethought and Catholic segments of the population, the Flemish educational system is split into a secular branch controlled by the communities, the provinces, or the municipalities, and a subsidised religious—mostly Catholic—branch. For the subsidised schools, the main costs such as the teacher's wages and building maintenance completely borne by the Flemish government. Subsidised schools are also free to determine their own teaching and examination methods, but in exchange, they {{must be able to}} prove that certain minimal terms are achieved by keeping records of the given lessons and exams. It should however be noted that—at least for the Catholic schools—the religious authorities have very limited power over these schools, neither do the schools have <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> on their own. Instead, the Catholic schools are a member of the Catholic umbrella organisation VSKO. The VSKO determines most practicalities for schools, like the advised schedules per study field. However, there's freedom of education in Flanders, which doesn't only mean that every pupil can choose his/her preferred school, but also that every organisation can found a school, and even be subsidised when abiding the different rules. This resulted also in some smaller school systems follow 'methodical pedagogies' (e.g. Steiner, Montessori, or Freinet) or serve the Jewish and Protestant minorities.|$|E
25|$|Pinochet {{organized}} a plebiscite on 11 September 1980 to ratify a new constitution, replacing the 1925 Constitution drafted during Arturo Alessandri's presidency. The new Constitution, partly drafted by Jaime Guzmán, a close adviser to Pinochet who later founded the right-wing party Independent Democratic Union (UDI), gave <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> to the President of the Republic—Pinochet. It created some new institutions, {{such as the}} Constitutional Tribunal and the controversial National Security Council (COSENA). It also prescribed an 8-year presidential period, and a single-candidate presidential referendum in 1988, where a candidate nominated by the Junta would be approved or rejected for another 8-year period. The new constitution was approved {{by a margin of}} 67.04% to 30.19% according to official figures; the opposition, headed by ex-president Eduardo Frei Montalva (who had supported Pinochet's coup), denounced extensive irregularities such as the lack of an electoral register, which facilitated multiple voting, and said that the total number of votes reported to have been cast was very much larger than would be expected from the size of the electorate and turnout in previous elections. Interviews after Pinochet's departure with people involved with the referendum confirmed that fraud had, indeed, been widespread. The Constitution was promulgated on 21 October 1980, taking effect on 11 March 1981. Pinochet was replaced as President of the Junta that day by Admiral Merino.|$|E

500|$|Theron Martin of Anime News Network {{considered}} Gamma to be {{a typical}} [...] "bad-ass anti-hero," [...] good at creating mayhem {{and not much}} else. IGN's review of the series treated him similarly, saying his role of [...] "protagonist who wields <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> and hides a dark secret" [...] was done effectively but not remarkably, and was typical of shōnen action manga. Alexander Gorban of the Russian Animemaniacs Magazine believed Gamma's typical nature as a hero with an inner demon was offset by the character's [...] "devilish charm" [...] and portrayed willingness {{to fight to the}} last breath to not lose his humanity. He noted that aspects of this personality were reused for Bleach protagonist Ichigo Kurosaki, who would also bear some similarities in physical appearance to Gamma. Gorban felt, however, that these same strengths of character made Gamma dominate the cast, and that Zombiepowder. would have been improved if he had simply been its sole protagonist.|$|E
500|$|In an {{electricity}} {{system without}} grid energy storage, generation from stored fuels (coal, biomass, natural gas, nuclear) must be {{go up and}} down in reaction to {{the rise and fall of}} solar electricity (see load following power plant). [...] While hydroelectric and natural gas plants can quickly follow solar being intermittent due to the weather, coal, biomass and nuclear plants usually take considerable time to respond to load and can only be scheduled to follow the predictable variation. [...] Depending on local circumstances, beyond about 20–40% of total generation, grid-connected intermittent sources like solar tend to require investment in some combination of grid interconnections, energy storage or demand side management. Integrating large amounts of solar power with existing generation equipment has caused issues in some cases. For example, in Germany, California and Hawaii, electricity prices have been known to go negative when solar is generating <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>power,</b> displacing existing baseload generation contracts.|$|E

500|$|Gangsta rap {{has been}} criticized for its extreme lyrics, which are often accused of glamorizing gang {{violence}} and black-on-black crime. The Gangsta rappers responded that they were simply describing the realities of life in places such as Compton, California, and Long Beach, California. Describing Doggystyle in 1993, Snoop Doggy Dogg likewise points to the album's realism, {{and the extent to which}} it is based on his personal experience. [...] He said, [...] "I can't rap about something I don't know. You'll never hear me rapping about no bachelor's degree. It's only what I know and that's that street life. It's all everyday life, reality." [...] Explaining his intentions, Snoop Doggy Dogg claims he feels he is a role model to many young black men, and that his songs are designed to relate to their concerns. [...] "For little kids growing up in the ghettos," [...] he said, [...] "it's easy to get into the wrong types of things, especially gangbanging and selling drugs.
