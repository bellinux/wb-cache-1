5|$|Wellesley's {{understanding}} of logistics was to prove valuable in leading an expeditionary force against the French invasion of Portugal and Spain. He was adept at planning long marches through unknown territory, understanding {{that he not}} only had thousands of men to manage efficiently, but that {{a huge amount of}} supplies were required to adequately feed and sustain his army. Secure supply lines to the Portuguese coast were of vital importance if he was to maintain his <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> the French.|$|E

Elements of multiple philosophies and religions, occultism, cyberpunk and early science fiction have all been incorporated into the series at different times.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of May 30, the 54th Battalion's 1st Company {{attacked}} the area around Isdud's railway station, but was outgunned and had to retreat with four wounded. According to the company's report, the food {{that was given to}} them was rotten and further deteriorated the soldiers' <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight.</b> On May 31, the Egyptian radio described the attack as a victory, and claimed hundreds of dead Israelis. The 3rd Company was unsuccessful, as intelligence on precise Egyptian positions was sparse, while the company gave its position away quickly. An Egyptian mortar scored a direct hit on one of the company's squads, which caused casualties and panic. One of the soldiers ran for cover, but lost direction, and ended up in Isdud. He walked around the village unnoticed and found a chance to return to Givati, and provided the command with invaluable information for the operation.|$|E

5|$|Ultimately the Australian {{operation}} on New Britain achieved its objectives, with the AN destroying the wireless station before seizing the colony, reducing a strategic German possession in the Pacific and thereby denying its use {{to support their}} naval forces in the region. Yet although successful, {{it had not been}} well-managed, and the Australians had been effectively delayed by a few reserve officers and a half-trained Melanesian police force. They finally prevailed because of their unexpected <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> in close terrain, while their outflanking of the German positions had unnerved their opponents. The Battle of Bita Paka was Australia's first major military engagement of the war, yet it soon became little more than a sideshow in a conflict which grew to assume much greater proportions. Later, many men of the AN volunteered for the AIF and served in Egypt, Gallipoli, Sinai and Palestine and on the Western Front. A large number became casualties, including Holmes, who was killed in action in 1917.|$|E
5|$|North Korean {{troops had}} the {{advantage}} of planning the invasion in advance and organizing a pre-set logistics network, but they were not able to keep this logistics network running efficiently. Their largest disadvantage was the successful large-scale UN interdiction effort, as North Korean supplies and supply lines were subjected to UN bombing raids. This effort was not successful in stopping the North Korean supplies, and the North Koreans have also been praised by historians for {{the way in which they}} were able to maintain a supply network in the face of a massive bombing campaign. However, the North Koreans did suffer reduced supply because of this, and inefficiencies in transporting supplies from railroads to individual units negated the railroads' advantage. North Korean forces, though initially successful, were unable to counter UN forces with effective air defense, and were also unable to conduct successful interdiction of their own. This meant their supply network limited the combat actions that they could undertake; logistics could not keep up with units on the offensive, and North Korean units went almost completely unsupported during key engagements, reducing their <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> effectively. North Korean logistical inefficiency prevented them from overwhelming UN units in the Pusan Perimeter and enabled the defending UN troops to hold on long enough for a counterattack to be launched at Inchon. This landing, coming behind North Korean lines, had the effect of collapsing the North Korean front and ultimately ended the battle around Pusan in September.|$|E

5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1794, the French Republic, {{under the rule of}} the National Convention, was at war with all its neighbours. With famine imminent, the French Committee of Public Safety looked to France's colonies and the United States to provide an {{infusion}} of grain; this was to be convoyed across the Atlantic during April, May and June, accompanied by a small escort squadron and supported by a second, larger squadron in the Bay of Biscay. However, political upheaval had severely reduced the French Navy's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> coherently and supply shortages had devastated its morale, significantly weakening the fleet. Britain, by contrast, was at a high state of readiness with a well-organised command structure, but was suffering from a severe shortage of trained seamen with which to man its large navy. The French Atlantic Fleet, under Admiral Villaret de Joyeuse, was tasked with keeping the British Channel Fleet occupied long enough for the convoy to reach France safely. The Channel Fleet, commanded by Lord Howe, knew of the convoy's passage, and dispatched squadrons to protect British commerce while pursuing Villaret himself with {{the main body of the}} Royal Navy's Channel Fleet. For over a week the two battlefleets manoeuvred around one another, Villaret drawing Howe deeper westwards into the Atlantic and away from the convoy. Two partial but inconclusive fleet actions on 28 and 29 May followed, during which Howe seized the weather gage from Villaret, granting him freedom to choose the time and place of his next attack.|$|E
