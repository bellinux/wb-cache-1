A separate alarm within the pavilion did sound when smoke and heat reached that area, [...] but the guards reported no ringing alarm before the fire was seen. Investigation afterwards discovered a faulty relay in the <b>alarm</b> <b>panel</b> which failed to switch power to the siren circuits when an alarm was triggered. However, the panel also contained a failed fuse in one siren circuit which suggested that the siren had activated but the fire shorted it out, and this might have also caused the relay to fail. The failed relay would have shut off power to the second siren circuit. Statements from workers suggested that weekly tests of the alarm system had not been carried out.|$|E

50|$|Many panels {{today have}} the {{capability}} of alerting building personnel of a situation which can arise into a potentially serious problem. Fire <b>alarm</b> <b>panels</b> indicate an abnormal condition via a solid or flashing LED. Some panels also contain a small sounder, {{used in conjunction with}} the visual alert. A number of indicators are shown below. Note that not all fire <b>alarm</b> <b>panels</b> have all of these indicators.|$|R

50|$|Addressable {{panels are}} usually more {{advanced}} than their conventional counterparts, with greater information capacity and control flexibility. Addressable fire <b>alarm</b> <b>panels</b> were introduced by many manufacturers during the microcontroller boom in the mid 1980s.|$|R
50|$|The {{grinder pump}} “station” {{consists}} of the pump, a tank, and an <b>alarm</b> <b>panel.</b> A pump for household use is usually 1 hp, 1.5 hp or 2 hp. A cutting mechanism macerates waste and grinds items that are not normally found in sewage, but may get flushed down the toilet. The pump has a level sensor either built into the pump, called “sensing bells,” or attached externally to the pump, called “floats.” (The level sensing devices vary among grinder pump manufacturers.)If the pump malfunctions and the waste level in the holding tank rises above a certain level, the <b>alarm</b> <b>panel</b> should alert the homeowner that the pump is experiencing problems. The <b>alarm</b> <b>panel</b> should have both a buzzer and an indicator light.|$|E
50|$|Because {{the heat}} sensing {{elements}} {{present in the}} automatic sprinklers have been removed (resulting in open sprinklers), the deluge valve must be opened as signaled by a fire alarm system. The type of fire alarm initiating device is selected mainly based on the hazard (e.g.pilot sprinklers, smoke detectors, heat detectors, or optical flame detectors). The initiation device signals the fire <b>alarm</b> <b>panel,</b> which in turn signals the deluge valve to open. Activation can also be manual, depending on the system goals. Manual activation is usually via an electric or pneumatic fire alarm pull station, which signals the fire <b>alarm</b> <b>panel,</b> which in turn signals the deluge valve to open.|$|E
5000|$|Also {{known as}} [...] "Fire" [...] or [...] "General Alarm". This {{indicator}} is lit when an alarm condition {{exists in the}} system, initiated by smoke detectors, heat detectors, sprinkler flow switches, manual pull stations, manual call points, or otherwise. Along with the indicator on the panel, notification appliances, such as horns and strobes, are also activated, signaling a need to evacuate to building occupants. In an alarm condition, the fire <b>alarm</b> <b>panel</b> indicates where the alarm originated. The <b>alarm</b> <b>panel</b> can be reset once the device which initiated the alarm is reset, such as returning the handle of a manual pull station to its normal position.|$|E

50|$|Increasing {{deployment}} of voice over IP technology (VoIP) {{is driving the}} adoption of broadband signaling for alarm reporting. Many sites requiring alarm installations no longer have conventional telephone lines (POTS), and <b>alarm</b> <b>panels</b> with conventional telephone dialer capability do not work reliably over some types of VoIP service.|$|R
50|$|In {{landline}} telephony, an 8P8C jack is used at {{the point}} a line enters the building to allow the line to be broken to insert automatic dialling equipment, including intrusion <b>alarm</b> <b>panels.</b> In analogue mobile telephony, the 8P8C connector was used to connect an AMPS cellular handset to its (separate) base unit; this usage is now obsolete.|$|R
50|$|Operation - Activation of a {{fire alarm}} {{initiating}} device, or a manual pull station, signals the fire <b>alarm</b> <b>panel,</b> which in turn signals the deluge valve to open, allowing water to enter the piping system. Water flows from all sprinklers simultaneously.|$|E
50|$|Close {{proximity}} strikes {{by lightning}} will always {{set off the}} ground fault circuit and at times blow the system out if the system did not follow NEC code Art. 250.94 which illustrates how {{to get rid of}} grounding differentials. A good ground filter/notch filter will prevent a feedback loop up case ground which causes false alarms. Also surge suppression improperly installed inside a fire <b>alarm</b> <b>panel</b> will also cause a feedback loop up case ground and cause false alarms. So the surge suppression must be outside the box, in a plastic box and not grounded directly to the fire panel, rather the grounded to the ground side/line side of the in-line series three stage two tank circuit designed AC surge suppression. Parallel will not protect a fire <b>alarm</b> <b>panel</b> nor prevent false alarms. In series surge suppression will at least help one control where the surges are coming from and the ground filter will also help. Tie three to four knots in the low voltage wire between the low voltage surge suppress and the fire <b>alarm</b> <b>panel,</b> and tie at least one knot in the phase/neutral/and ground wire attached to the power supply. This will help mitigate false alarms, as well as help one's surge suppression do a better job.|$|E
5000|$|Also {{known as}} [...] "Manual Evacuation" [...] or [...] "Evacuate". On panels {{containing}} this function, the [...] "Drill" [...] indicator {{shows that the}} alarm condition was activated from the fire <b>alarm</b> <b>panel,</b> often in order to conduct a fire drill. When an alarm is initiated for a drill, the fire department or monitoring company is usually not notified automatically.|$|E

5000|$|Although quasi-standards {{exist that}} allow panels from {{different}} manufacturers to be networked with each other, {{they are not}} in favor with a lot of companies. One of the most common protocols used is BACnet which is common for various type of industrial networks. At least one system manufacturer, The Mircom Group of Companies provides a networkable Fire <b>Alarm</b> Control <b>Panel</b> with a BACnet inteface allowing non-proprietary interoperability of the Fire <b>Alarm</b> Control <b>Panel</b> FACP with other building systems. Typical interconnected systems to the Fire <b>Alarm</b> Control <b>Panel</b> include HVAC, Building Automation Controllers, Security/Access Control or Elevator Controllers. Interoperable systems greatly reduce the long term maintenance cost of a system and can provide greater emergency response than proprietary offerings.|$|R

50|$|Most {{systems may}} also be {{equipped}} with smoke, heat, and/or carbon monoxide detectors. These are also known as 24-hour zones (which are on at all times). Smoke and heat detectors protect from the risk of fire using different detection methods. Carbon monoxide detectors help protect from the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning. Although an intruder <b>alarm</b> <b>panel</b> may also have these detectors connected, it may not meet all the local fire code requirements of a fire alarm system.|$|E
50|$|Each KWT-37 filled {{an entire}} relay rack with five stacked modules. A {{precision}} time reference occupied the bottom, three key generators (stream cyphers in civilian parlance) occupied {{the middle and}} an <b>alarm</b> <b>panel</b> occupied the top position. The outputs of the three key generators were combined in a voting circuit. If one of the units' output did not match the other two, an alarm was sounded and the output from the two units that did agree continued to be used.|$|E
5000|$|The Audible Silence {{indicator}} is used {{in conjunction}} with the [...] "Alarm" [...] indicator. It indicates that the fire <b>alarm</b> <b>panel</b> is still in an alarm condition, but that notification appliances have been silenced. While the alarm is silenced, other functions in an alarm condition continue to operate, such as emergency service for elevators, stairway pressurization, and ventilation functions. A new alarm initiation while the alarm is silenced will take the panel out of Audible Silence and reactivate the notification appliances.|$|E

When the Internet is used as a primary signaling method for critical security and life safety applications, frequent supervision messages are configured to overcome concerns about backup power for network equipment and signal delivery time. But for typical applications, connectivity concerns are controlled by normal supervision messages, sent daily or weekly.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to controlling the building's internal environment, BMS systems are sometimes linked to access control (turnstiles and access doors controlling who is allowed {{access and egress}} to the building) or other security systems such as closed-circuit television (CCTV) and motion detectors. Fire alarm systems and elevators are also sometimes linked to a BMS, for monitoring. In case a fire is detected then only the fire <b>alarm</b> <b>panel</b> could shut off dampers in the ventilation system to stop smoke spreading and send all the elevators to the ground floor and park them to prevent people from using them.|$|E
50|$|A second video {{solution}} can {{be incorporated}} into to a standard panel, which sends the central station an alarm. When a signal is received, a trained monitoring professional accesses the on-site digital video recorder (DVR) through an IP link to determine the cause of the activation. For this type of system, the camera input to the DVR reflects the <b>alarm</b> <b>panel's</b> zones and partitioning, which allows personnel to look for an alarm source in multiple areas.|$|R

5000|$|A Fire Alarm Control Panel (FACP), [...] Fire Alarm Control Unit (FACU), {{or simply}} Fire <b>alarm</b> <b>panel</b> is the {{controlling}} {{component of a}} Fire alarm system. The panel receives information from devices designed to detect and report fires, monitors their operational integrity and provides for automatic control of equipment, and transmission of information necessary to prepare the facility for fire based on a predetermined sequence. The panel may also supply electrical energy to operate any associated initiating device, notification appliance, control, transmitter, or relay. There are four basic types of panels: coded panels, conventional panels, addressable panels, and multiplex systems.|$|E
5000|$|In Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Asia, pull {{stations}} {{are generally not}} used; instead a manual call point is used, which is usually referred to as an MCP, call point or Fire Point within the fire protection industry and as a [...] "transmitter" [...] in Japan. They are used to allow building occupants to signal that a fire or other emergency exists within the building. They are usually connected to a central fire <b>alarm</b> <b>panel</b> which is in turn connected to an alarm system in the building, and often to a local fire brigade dispatcher as well. The first modern MCP arrived in Europe in 1972 and was developed by KAC.|$|E
