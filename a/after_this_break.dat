2500|$|Even with Duran Duran on hold, {{band members}} were soon anxious to record new music, {{leading to a}} {{supposedly}} temporary split into two side projects. John and Andy Taylor wanted {{to break away from}} the Duran Duran sound and pursue hard rock material; they collaborated with Robert Palmer and Tony Thompson to form the rock/funk supergroup the Power Station, which released two Top 10 singles. Simon Le Bon and Nick Rhodes, on the other hand, wanted to further explore Duran Duran's atmospheric aspect and formed Arcadia, who released one LP (So Red the Rose) from which the single [...] "Election Day" [...] was released. Contributors to that album included guitarist Masami Tsuchiya, bassist Mark Egan, percussionist David Van Tieghem, drummer Steve Jordan, Sting, Herbie Hancock, and David Gilmour. Roger Taylor was a drummer for Arcadia as well, but also contributed percussion to the Power Station album. Duran Duran were never the same <b>after</b> <b>this</b> <b>break.</b> According to Rhodes, the two side projects [...] "were commercial suicide... But we've always been good at that." [...] The band was still off balance when they regrouped to contribute [...] "A View to a Kill" [...] to the 1985 James Bond movie of the same name. This single was the first Bond theme to go to number 1 on the US charts, and was at the time the joint highest-placed Bond theme on the UK chart where it reached number 2. It was the last single the band recorded as the original five-piece for close to twenty years.|$|E

Regarding the Ceylonese LSSP, the meeting suggested that LSSP be give a special invitee status provided that the LSSP break its relations to the Trotskyist Fourth International. At the Tokyo meeting the LSSP leader Colvin R. de Silva participated. The LSSP could not accept the condition to break its affiliation to the Fourth International, and thus declined the proposal from ASC. <b>After</b> <b>this</b> <b>break,</b> the ASC began considering links with the Sri Lanka Freedom Party instead.|$|E

50|$|Esperanza López Mateos {{had been}} {{cooperating}} with B. Traven {{since at least}} 1941 when she translated his first novel The Bridge in the Jungle into Spanish. Later she also translated seven other novels of his. Esperanza, the sister of Adolfo López Mateos, later the President of Mexico, played an increasingly important role in Traven's life. For example, in 1947, she went to Europe to represent him in contacts with his publishers; finally, in 1948, her name (along with Josef Wieder from Zurich) appeared as the copyright holder of his books. Wieder, as {{an employee of the}} Büchergilde Gutenberg book club, had already been cooperating with the writer since 1933. In that year, the Berlin-based book club Büchergilde Gutenberg, which had been publishing Traven's books so far, was closed by the Nazis after Adolf Hitler took power. Traven's books were forbidden in Nazi Germany between 1933 and 1945, and the author transferred the publication rights to the branch of Büchergilde in Zurich, Switzerland, where the publishers also emigrated. In 1939, the author decided to end his cooperation with Büchergilde Gutenberg; <b>after</b> <b>this</b> <b>break,</b> his representative became Josef Wieder, a former employee of the book club who had never met the writer personally. Esperanza López Mateos died, committing suicide, in 1951; her successor was Rosa Elena Luján, Hal Croves' future wife.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigated}} {{whether the}} effect of the shale gas revolution on the U. S. gas market is still a domestic phenomenon or this revolution is influencing the global natural gas market. We used the Bai-Perron test to identify the break date related to the shale gas revolution and tested the price linkages among the U. S., European and Japanese gas markets for the periods before and <b>after</b> <b>this</b> <b>break</b> date. The result indicated that the U. S. gas market had a price linkage with the international market for the period before the revolution affected the U. S. gas production, but this price linkage disappeared for the period after the revolution. This result implied that the U. S. gas market became independent after the shale gas revolution occurred and that the price linkage between the U. S. and international gas market became weaker after the shale gas revolution occurred. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{discovery}} of the short GRB 090510 has raised considerable attention mainly because it had a bright optical afterglow and it {{is among the most}} energetic events detected so far within the entire GRB population. The afterglow was observed with swift/UVOT and swift/XRT and evidence of a jet break around 1. 5 ks after the burst has been reported in the literature, implying that <b>after</b> <b>this</b> <b>break</b> the optical and X-ray light curve should fade with the same decay slope. As noted by several authors, the post-break decay slope seen in the UVOT data is much shallower than the steep decay in the X-ray band, pointing to an excess of optical flux at late times. We reduced and analyzed new afterglow light-curve data obtained with the multichannel imager GROND. Based on the densely sampled data set obtained with GROND, we find that the optical afterglow of GRB 090510 did indeed enter a steep decay phase starting around 22 ks after the burst. During this time the GROND optical light curve is achromatic, and its slope is identical to the slope of the X-ray data. In combination with the UVOT data this implies that a second break must have occurred in the optical light curve around 22 ks post burst, which, however, has no obvious counterpart in the X-ray band, contradicting the interpretation that this could be another jet break. The GROND data provide the missing piece of evidence that the optical afterglow of GRB 090510 did follow a post-jet break evolution at late times.

40|$|Context. The Swift {{discovery}} of the short burst GRB 090510 has raised considerable attention mainly because of two reasons: first, it had a bright optical afterglow, and second it {{is among the most}} energetic events detected so far within the entire GRB population (long plus short). The afterglow of GRB 090510 was observed with Swift/UVOT and Swift/XRT and evidence of a jet break around 1. 5 ks after the burst has been reported in the literature, implying that <b>after</b> <b>this</b> <b>break</b> the optical and X-ray light curve should fade with the same decay slope. Aims. As noted by several authors, the post-break decay slope seen in the UVOT data is much shallower than the steep decay in the X-ray band, pointing to a (theoretically hard to understand) excess of optical flux at late times. We assess here the validity of this peculiar behavior. Methods. We reduced and analyzed new afterglow light-curve data obtained with the multichannel imager GROND. These additional g'r'i'z' data were then combined with the UVOT and XRT data to study the behavior of the afterglow at late times more stringently. Results. Based on the densely sampled data set obtained with GROND, we find that the optical afterglow of GRB 090510 did indeed enter a steep decay phase starting around 22 ks after the burst. During this time the GROND optical light curve is achromatic, and its slope is identical to the slope of the X-ray data. In combination with the UVOT data this implies that a second break must have occurred in the optical light curve around 22 ks post burst, which, however, has no obvious counterpart in the X-ray band, contradicting the interpretation that this could be another jet break. Conclusions. The GROND data provide the missing piece of evidence that the optical afterglow of GRB 090510 did follow a post-jet break evolution at late times. The break seen in the optical light curve around 22 ks in combination with its missing counterpart in the X-ray band could be due to the passage of the injection frequency across the optical bands, as already theoretically proposed in the literature. This is possibly the first time that this passage has been clearly seen in an optical afterglow. In addition, our results imply that there is no more evidence for an excess of flux in the optical bands at late times...|$|E

50|$|A {{defamation}} trial {{against his}} father forced Kraus to interrupt his studies {{for one year}} and {{to move back to}} Buchen. He spent his time in Buchen writing his tragedy Tolon, a drama in three acts, and several musical works for the town-church of St. Oswald. Among others, Kraus wrote a Te Deum in D major and the motet Fracto Demum Sacramento in D Major. <b>After</b> <b>this</b> one-year <b>break,</b> he continued his studies of law in Göttingen. Although the Göttinger Hainbund (the German poet group that flourished 1772-74) no longer existed, Kraus found himself very much attracted to the ideas of this group of young poets that offered an almost fanatical devotion to the poet Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock. In this period Kraus composed a book of poetry, named Versuch von Schäfersgedichte, which is now lost, and consisted of nineteen poems. More and more, he became involved with the Sturm und Drang movement, which influenced both his writing and his music.|$|R
