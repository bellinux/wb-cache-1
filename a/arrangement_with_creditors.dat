2500|$|Because the {{essential}} problem of insolvent companies is excessive indebtedness, the Insolvency Act 1986 sections 1 to 7 contain a procedure {{for companies to}} ask creditors to reduce the debt they are owed, {{in the hope that}} the company may survive. For instance, directors might propose that each creditor accepts 80 per cent of the money owed to each, and to spread repayments out over five years, in return for a commitment to restructure the business' affairs under a new marketing strategy. Under chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code this kind of debt restructuring is usual, and the so-called [...] "cram down" [...] procedure allows a court to approve a plan over the wishes of creditors if they will receive a value equivalent to what they are owed. However, under UK law, the procedure remains predominantly voluntary, except for small companies. A company's directors may instigate a voluntary <b>arrangement</b> <b>with</b> <b>creditors,</b> or if already appointed, an administrator or liquidator can also propose it. Importantly, secured and preferential creditors' entitlements cannot be reduced without their consent. The procedure takes place under the supervision of an insolvency practitioner, to whom the directors will submit a report on the company's finances and a proposal for reducing the debt.|$|E

The CMR reconstructed the line and converted it to the [...] standard gauge, rebuilding and extending the jetties at Carne Point also. The CMR had a Fowey station a short distance south of the L&FR terminal, and the CMR constructed a connection to link the two railways.

40|$|Title {{devised by}} {{cataloguer}} {{based on information}} from acquisition documentation.; "AIS [Australian Information Services photograph] 9 / 4 / 80 " [...] In pen on compactus card.; Also available in an electronic version via the Internet at: [URL] Bond was born 22 April 1938 in the Hammersmith district of London, England, and emigrated to Australia with his parents and sister Geraldine in 1950. He became a public hero in his adopted country after bankrolling challenges for the yachting trophy the America's Cup, finally winning the trophy (which had been held by the USA since 1851) in 1983. Bond was awarded the accolade of Australian of the Year in 1978. He made his fortune initially in property development and at one time was one of Australia's most prominent businesspeople. He later extended his business interests into other fields including brewing (he controlled Castlemaine Tooheys), gold mining and television. Australia's first private university, Bond University, bears his name. He purchased QTQ- 9, Brisbane and settled an outstanding dispute the station had with the Queensland premier, Joh Bjelke-Petersen by paying out $ 400, 000. In 1987 he paid $ 1 billion for the Australia-wide Nine television network. Among his flamboyant purchases was Vincent Van Gogh's painting, Irises, for 54 million Australian dollars, but he didn't {{have enough money to}} pay for it and it had to be re-sold. The stock market crash in 1987 was {{one of a number of}} factors that led to the downfall of Bond's business empire, and he eventually went to prison for a time after being convicted of hiding some of his assets from Bond Corporation's receivers. These efforts, however, were somewhat successful; he appears to have retained several luxury properties and other assets sufficient to support a luxurious lifestyle. Bond was originally jailed in August 1996 for a $ 15 million charge involving the Manet painting La Promenade. In 1997 he was sentenced to a further four years after pleading guilty to siphoning off $ 1. 2 billion from one of his companies, Bell Resources, to prop up his ailing Bond Corporation. Journalist Paul Barry has pointed out that Bond's release after 1, 298 days meant that he spent roughly one day behind bars for every million dollars he stole. In 1995 Bond and his family bought him out of bankruptcy, using about $ 12 million they held in offshore trusts to reach an <b>arrangement</b> <b>with</b> <b>creditors</b> who were owed $ 1. 8 billion, a payout of a little over half a cent in the dollar...|$|E
40|$|Universitat Jaume I. Departament d'Administració d'Empreses i MàrquetingOne of the {{critical}} aspects for the good progress of companies with growth potential and which are in their expansion phase {{is the ability to}} find funding sources. These companies usually have interesting products, with a already existing business model, although they need to obtain more external resources in order to explode and become larger companies. There comes a time when the contribution of the partners who run the company or the potential benefits the company has obtained in previous years are not enough to enable the company {{to take the next step}} in its natural path. In order to get this financing, the companies have several options in the world today, each with its pros and cons, which the companies themselves should take into account. In addition, it is especially important evolution in terms of results of the exercises the company develops. These results can mark out, of course, the path of society and its funding needs in coming years. This situation is what we see in the company we will talk about in this document, Zinkia Entertainment S. A. A company with a thriving product in its field, which is beginning to gain international recognition and which needs an extra push to liberate all the potential of a newborn trend. We will see which decisions the company administration takes, how the company walked the first steps in the search for funding and what different path the company chose at any given time. We will reflect on why the company decided to carry out a change of strategy and we will think about the consequences those decisions will have in the coming years. We will also discuss the situation of the company before and after the decisions taken, and what is the company situation when the results turn out not to be the expected ones. In this process for raising finance, external entities were involved, and we should also focus on them briefly. So, we will describe what additional options Zinkia has as a part of a stock market as the AIM. Also, we will detail which differences exist between this market and other better known markets, and if these differences may have been meaningful when explaining the situation the company undergoes nowadays. In addition, we will see what happens when a body such as the CNMV gives a negative judgment when a company in a difficult situation, as Zinkia, tries to capture funding. On the other hand, the importance of shareholder stability within a company trying to expand should also be remarked. This does not happen in Zinkia, and we shall describe briefly the struggle for power, which is still in force in society; a struggle, compounded by the decisions of a president who makes decisions with the sole support of majority shareholder, against the opinion of other important at a particularly delicate moment in the life of Zinkia. In order to analyze the path of Zinkia, we will structure information as follows. First, we will briefly describe the objectives of this document and the methodology to be followed. Then, we will divide the path of Zinkia into three sections. In the first section, we will narrate the situation of the company since 2008 until the end of 2010. It is at this time, at the end of 2010, when Zinkia changes course regarding its funding strategy. After this first block, we will analyze the situation of the company since late 2010 until the end of 2013. At this moment, the most critical time for the company occurs, which marks its evolution to the present. A failed attempt to get more funding requires the company to enter a pre-arrangement with creditors. In the third section, we will describe the situation of Zinkia since the pre-arrangement with creditors until today. Although we only have the annual accounts until 2014, we will see how the <b>arrangement</b> <b>with</b> <b>creditors</b> ends and what is the situation of the company today. Finally, we will dedicate a section to analyze the AIM, describe some of its differences concerning regulated markets and reflect on how these differences can foster cases like Zinkia’s...|$|E
