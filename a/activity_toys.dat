40|$|Background: The 2010 Cochrane review {{regarding}} Botulinum Toxin A (BoNT-A) {{upper limb}} injections {{in children with}} CP, underlined the need to better define the associated physiotherapy treatment. Through an RCT involving 24 children with hemiplegic CP, {{an attempt was made}} to define the physiotherapy protocol. The results confirmed the determinant role of intensive individualized goaldirected physiotherapy in activity domain improvement. Objective: To define precise criteria for individualized physiotherapy planning and a functional exercise inventory after BONT-A injections. Method: After BONT-A injection an individualized physiotherapy programme was created for each child considering not only injected muscles and functional goals but also motor learning capacity and modifiability, pointing, reaching, grasping, manipulating, releasing strategies, sensoryperceptual disorders, bottom-up components, cognitive level, age, sex and personality. Physiotherapeutic treatment consisted of everyday stretching maneuvers, therapeutic exercises and activities organized in three 45 minute weekly sessions, for 24 weeks. Functional individualized goals were established with family and child. The treatment was combined with nighttime positional splints and daytime functional orthoses aimed at facilitating grasping and handling. The therapeutic approach was specific timed to BONT-A action. During the first month therapists focused on segmental treatment such as stretching, with simple unimanual or bimanual exercises; both transitive and intransitive tasks were proposed, aimed at activating muscles antagonistic to injected ones. From the second to the sixth post-injection month increasing complex functional activities, bimanual and unimanual tasks, with or without functional orthoses were utilized. Either motor tasks, requiring previously selective then sequential executive control, or perception oriented tasks were considered. Setting was particularly important in guiding and supporting activities, every exercise was incorporated into a game or routine <b>activity.</b> <b>Toys,</b> common objects or specifically constructed items were used. Repetition was often needed to fix newly learned abilities, but each exercise was slightly modified every few repetitions in order to maintain interest, limit frustration and improve generalization. Family cooperation helped transfer exercised abilities to daily life. Video recording and testing before, during and after treatment were performed. Conclusion:Functional intensive individualized child-focused approach, combining physiotherapy and orthoses, is effective in improving manipulation after botulinum injection. Positive standardized test results (AHA, Abilhand-kids, Shuee, soon to be released data) are encouraging. This approach is limited by the time required for preparing individualized treatments and personalizing settings...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{describe}} the development of the HERS - Home Environment Resources Scale. The HERS is based on an ecological view of development. It assesses support resources available to the child at home, which can contribute for school achievement. These resources relate to three domains: resources that promote proximal processes; activities that signal stability in family processes; parental practices that promote a home–school linkage. Previous research using the HERS has indicated acceptable indexes of internal consistency, as well as significant associations between HERS scores and measures of academic achievement and adjustment. Leisure <b>activities,</b> <b>toys,</b> books, and opportunities for the child to interact with parents at home were all related to child achievement and adjustment.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has demonstrated that young children hold strong gender stereotypes for <b>activities</b> and <b>toy,</b> preferences. Some researchers have argued that this rigid gender-typing displayed by young children is associated with peer reinforcement for stereotypical behaviour and punishment of counterstereotypical behaviour. The present study tests the hypothesis that the gender-typing displayed by young children is at least in part an active self-presentational effort to win positive evaluation from peers. Sixty-four children aged between 4 and 9 years described themselves in terms of their <b>activity</b> and <b>toy</b> preferences, once when alone and once when in front of a group of same-sex peers. They also completed a task measuring the rigidity of their gender stereotypes. It was found using both group-bused and individual-based analyses that the children with the most rigid stereotypes-young boys-were more likely to present themselves as sex-typed in front of the peer audience than when alone. The older boys and the girls in all age groups tended to have less rigid stereotypes and their self-descriptions were in general not influenced by the presence of an audience. These results show that self-presentational concerns do influence children's gender-typed behaviour; and that these concerns may vary with age and gender...|$|R
40|$|This diploma thesis The {{analysis}} of palying interactions {{of a child}} at toddler age in a nursery {{is divided into two}} parts - the theoretical part and the empirical part. The theoretical part is divided into four main chapters. The first chapter deals with the characteristics of a child at toddler age. The individual stages of child development are described here. The second chapter focuses on the child's play activities and the third characterises nursery care in the Czech Republic and abroad. The fourth chapter contains summary of the theoretical part. The survey presented in the empirical part of the thesis consists of an {{analysis of}} play interaction between two and three-year old children and their teacher in a nursery facility. The following actions of children were monitored: vocalisation, eye contact with other people and expression of emotions, motor <b>activity,</b> <b>toy</b> preference and mutual physical contact between the teacher and a child. Video records were analysed using applications V. I. P. (Video Interactive Procesor) and MS Excel.
