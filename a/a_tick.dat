Though he no longer serves in Congress, Bedell remains active in Iowa politics, strongly supporting Howard Dean in 2004 over John Kerry.

5|$|Bedell {{decided not}} to seek reelection in 1986 after {{contracting}} Lyme Disease from <b>a</b> <b>tick</b> bite. Since then, he has founded a center for alternative medicine and is a noted advocate of health freedom. Due largely to his friendship with Tom Harkin, he remains an important political figure in Iowa, with politicians such as Howard Dean meeting him in their trips to the state. Also, the Elinor Bedell State Park was established in 1998 on land donated by Berkley and Elinor Bedell. The park is named after the Congressman's wife.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{created for}} deer hunting, Richmond Park now has 630 red and fallow deer that roam freely within {{much of the}} park. A cull takes place each November and February to ensure numbers can be sustained. Some deer are also killed in road accidents, through ingesting litter such as small items of plastic, or by dogs; three deer were killed by dogs in 2012. Many of the deer in Richmond Park are {{infected}} with a bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi which can be transmitted to humans through <b>a</b> <b>tick</b> bite causing Lyme disease.|$|E
5|$|The Ixodidae {{contains}} over 700 {{species of}} hard ticks with a scutum or hard shield, which the Argasidae lack. The Argasidae contains about 200 species; the genera accepted as of 2010 are Antricola, Argas, Nothoaspis, Ornithodoros and Otobius. They have no scutum, and the capitulum (mouth and feeding parts) is concealed beneath the body. The family Nuttalliellidae contains {{only a single}} species, Nuttalliella namaqua, <b>a</b> <b>tick</b> found in southern Africa from Tanzania to Namibia and South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{infectious}} diseases {{of humans and}} other animals can be transmitted by ticks, the species of tick involved tending to be those with a wide host range. Spread of disease {{in this way is}} enhanced by the extended time during which <b>a</b> <b>tick</b> remains attached, during which time the mobile host can be carried long distances, {{or in the case of}} bird hosts, across the sea. The infective agents can be present not only in the adult tick but also in the eggs produced plentifully by the females. Many tick species have extended their ranges as a result of the movements of people, their pets and livestock. With increasing participation in outdoor activities such as wilderness hikes, more people and their dogs may find themselves exposed to attack.|$|E

25|$|The dog or cat {{may show}} {{a great variety}} of signs that may be very subtle in the early stages. Early signs include lethargy, loss of appetite, {{apparent}} groaning when lifted, altered voice (bark/meow), noisy panting, coughing, drooling of saliva, gagging, regurgitation (dogs) and enlarged pupils (cats). Occasionally a single limb may appear to be weak or lame. <b>A</b> <b>tick</b> attached {{to the side of the}} face may cause loss of blink reflex, corneal ulceration and an ocular discharge. <b>A</b> <b>tick</b> attached near the anus can cause anal incontinence.|$|E

40|$|Amblyomma americanum is <b>a</b> hard <b>tick</b> species {{found in}} {{southern}} Indiana. Once a notorious pest to humans and livestock, A. americanum has now {{taken on a}} role as vector to pathogenic organisms. This study aimed to detect and quantify three microbes in A. americanum: Rickettsia amblyommii, Ehrlichia chaffeensis, and Borrelia lonestari. A primary objective {{of this study was}} to determine microbial interaction within a single <b>A.</b> americanum <b>tick</b> through quantification of each microbe within <b>a</b> co-infected <b>tick.</b> <b>A</b> second objective was to determine the density of R. amblyommii within the salivary glands of <b>A.</b> americanum <b>ticks.</b> Infection rates were 44 %, 1 %, and 0 % for R. amblyommii, E. chaffeensis, and B. lonestari respectively.

25|$|Neurological {{problems}} following tick bites {{were recognized}} {{starting in the}} 1920s. French physicians Garin and Bujadoux described a farmer with a painful sensory radiculitis accompanied by mild meningitis following <b>a</b> <b>tick</b> bite. A large, ring-shaped rash was also noted, although the doctors did not relate it to the meningoradiculitis. In 1930, the Swedish dermatologist Sven Hellerström {{was the first to}} propose EM and neurological symptoms following <b>a</b> <b>tick</b> bite were related. In the 1940s, German neurologist Alfred Bannwarth described several cases of chronic lymphocytic meningitis and polyradiculoneuritis, some of which were accompanied by erythematous skin lesions.|$|E
25|$|If {{an unusual}} black scab (eschar) {{develops}} {{at the site}} of <b>a</b> <b>tick</b> bite, or if there are any other signs of illness occurring within a few weeks of <b>a</b> <b>tick</b> bite (especially 'flu-like' symptoms, fever, generalised skin rash, muscular or joint pain), it is recommended that a doctor be consulted and informed about the tick bite – a Rickettsial infection (Rickettsia australis, or Rickettsia honei) may be the cause. Whilst many such Rickettsial infections are self-limiting, early treatment with antibiotics can prevent longer-term problems in some individuals. Doctors in Australia may also wish to investigate the possibility of a Lyme-like disease, particularly if there is also a 'bullseye' or 'target' shaped skin rash (known as erythema migrans).|$|E
25|$|The flaviviruses can {{be divided}} into 2 clades: one with the vector borne viruses and the other with no known vector. The vector clade in turn can be {{subdivided}} into a mosquito borne clade and <b>a</b> <b>tick</b> borne clade. These groups {{can be divided}} again.|$|E

25|$|If {{a person}} has {{difficulty}} removing <b>a</b> <b>tick,</b> or has {{reason to be concerned}} about allergic reactions, it is best to seek professional medical attention. The process of removing ticks in humans has been associated with anaphylactic reactions and so it is best to have appropriate medical supplies (oxygen, adrenaline) ready.|$|E
25|$|Treatment of Lyme-like Disease. Early {{treatment}} with antibiotics {{is important to}} prevent more serious problems. Pregnant women bitten by <b>a</b> <b>tick</b> should see their doctor.

25|$|In {{recent years}} {{there have been}} 5 to 10 cases a year of a disease similar to Lyme {{occurring}} in Montana. It occurs primarily in pockets along the Yellowstone River in central Montana.

25|$|Coinfections complicate Lyme symptoms, {{especially}} {{diagnosis and}} treatment. It {{is possible for}} <b>a</b> <b>tick</b> to carry and transmit one of the coinfections and not Borrelia, making diagnosis difficult and often elusive. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention studied 100 ticks in rural New Jersey, and found 55% of the ticks were infected {{with at least one}} of the pathogens.|$|E
