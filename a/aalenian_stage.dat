50|$|There are {{important}} exposures of rocks {{of the lower}} and middle Jurassic Periods. The lowest part of the exposure consists of Cotswold Sand Formation which is overlain by the 'Cephalopod bed'. The 'Cephalopod bed' exposure is relatively thick and contains valuable fossil molluscs ammonites. The 'Cephalopod bed' is overlain by the 'scissum' beds (Leckhampton Limestone) of the Middle Jurassic, <b>Aalenian</b> <b>Stage.</b> The upper exposure consists of lower Inferior Oolite (Fiddler’s Elbow Limestone and Frocester Hill Oolite). This is overlain by Upper 'Trigonia' Grit.|$|E
50|$|The International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) {{has defined}} {{the base of}} the Bajocian Stage of the Jurassic as the lowest {{occurrence}} of the genus Hyperlioceras, at 170.3 ± 1.4 million years ago, which defines base of the Hyperlioceras discites Zone. This point also marks the end of the preceding <b>Aalenian</b> <b>Stage.</b> The upper boundary of the Bajocian is indicated by the lowest occurrence of the ammonite Parkinsonia (G.) convergens, at about 167.7 Ma , which defines base of Zigzagiceras zigzag Zone.|$|E
50|$|The site {{is in the}} Cotswold Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and is a {{significant}} geological location which shows a thick section of Lower and Middle Jurassic rocks. These span the junction between the Aalenian and Bajocian Stages.The lowest stratum which may be seen is the Cotswold Sand Formation of the Upper Lias. This is exposed in the sunken lane cuttings. The section above, which is the Cephalopod bed (top of the <b>Aalenian</b> <b>Stage),</b> {{is similar to the}} exposures on Wotton Hill. The Lower Inferior Oolite Freestones, are topped by 'hardground', which is a thin layer of tough limestone which is encrusted with fossil mollusc shells. One of the best fossiliferous sections is the Upper Trigonia Grit, which lies above the Freestone. There is an absence of Middle Inferior Oolite {{as a result of the}} effect of an important phase of uplift (warping) of the crust during the Lower Bajocian time interval. This demonstrates an important phase in earth movement in the region.|$|E
50|$|The site {{is in the}} Cotswold Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty to {{the north}} of the county. It {{provides}} significant exposures of a succession in the Inferior Oolite strata of the Middle Jurassic time interval. These exhibit characteristics unique to the north Cotswolds. They span the Junction between the <b>Aalenian</b> and Bajocian <b>Stages.</b>|$|R
50|$|The holotype {{specimen}} of Nebulasaurus taito LDRC-v.d.1 was {{recovered from the}} Zhanghe Formation, near Xiabanjing, in Yuanmou County of YunnanProvince, China. The specimen was collected in terrestrial sediments deposited during the <b>Aalenian</b> and Bajocian <b>stages</b> of the Jurassic period, approximately 174 to 168 million years ago.

50|$|The geology at {{this site}} {{provides}} a section spanning {{the division of the}} Middle Jurassic known as the <b>Aalenian</b> and Bajocian <b>Stages</b> and a sequence of rocks placed in the subdivision known as the discites zone, named after the characteristic fossil ammonite Hyperlioceras discites. This is one of the thickest sequences in Britain and may be used as the basis for defining these new subzones.|$|R
40|$|The Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) for the <b>Aalenian</b> <b>Stage,</b> {{formally}} defined at {{the base}} of bed FZ 107 in the Fuentelsaz section, Castilian Branch of the Iberian Range (Spain), has been ratified by the IUGS. Multidisciplinary biostratigraphical data, based on ammonites, brachiopods, ostracods, bivalves, foraminifera, calcareous nannofossils assemblages and palynomorphs, assure worldwide correlations; magnetostratigraphic data increase this correlation power. The position of the boundary coincides with the first occurrence of the ammonite assemblage characterized by Leioceras opalinum and Leioceras lineatum and corresponds with a normal polarity interval correlated with the up-to-date Jurassic magnetic polarity time scale (Gradstein and others, 1994; Ogg, 1995) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this work is to present a biostratigraphic zonal scheme of the Aalenian of Northern Lusitanian Basin (Portugal) based on ammonite distribution. Several {{sections}} have been logged, {{as well as the}} systematic descriptions of their ammonite associations, which include five new species (Vacekia striata, V. robusta, Asthenoceras vacekiformis, Leioceras intermedium, Haplopleuroceras nov. sp.). The present work consists of two major parts: paleontology (1) and biostratigraphy (2). (1) Paleontology This part includes the systematic descriptions of all the species which have been recognized in the studied area. They include representatives of Hildoceratidae (7 species), Graphoceratidae (29 species) and Erycitidae (6 species). (2) Biostratigraphy This part includes: - a discussion on the meaning and boundaries of the <b>Aalenian</b> <b>stage,</b> as well as a commented summary of all biostratigraphic zonal schemes known in West Tetyan basins; - the descriptions and interpretations of all the sections logged in the studied area; - a lithostratigraphic synthesis of all the units where sections have been logged; - a biostratigraphic synthesis including the definition of the criteria used to establish the biostratigraphic units recognized: Opalinum (Opalinum and Comptum Subzones), Murchisonae (Bradfordensis Subzone) and Concavum (Concavum and Limitatum Subzones) Biozones; - a paleobiogeographic analysis including a discussion of the affinities found between portuguese and betic ammonite associationa; - a paleogeographic interpretation of the geodynamic evolution of the Northern Lusitanian Basin during AalenianAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

They are located online at: [URL] of the study: Triassic and Jurassic fossils record structural changes in conifer seed cones through time, provide the earliest evidence for crown-group conifer clades, and further clarify sister-group relationships of modern conifer families. A new and distinct seed-cone from the Isle of Skye in western Scotland provides the oldest detailed evidence for the ancestral morphology of the phylogenetically contentious family Cupressaceae. Methods: A single isolated cone was prepared as serial sections by the cellulose acetate peel technique, mounted on microscope slides, and viewed and photographed using transmitted light. The three-dimensional structure of the cone was first reconstructed from the serial sections and then refined through imaging with x-ray microtomography. Key results: Scitistrobus duncaanensis, gen. et sp. nov., is a 7. 5 mm-diameter cylindrical seed cone with helically arranged bract-scale complexes in which three scale tips separate from a large bract, each tip bearing one adaxial seed. Seeds are near-inverted, show 180 degrees rotational symmetry, and have a diminutive wing in the major plane. Conclusions: Scitistrobus duncaanensis extends the fossil record for anatomically preserved seed cones of the Cupressaceae backward from the Upper Jurassic to the <b>Aalenian</b> <b>Stage</b> of the Middle Jurassic. The cone displays a previously unknown combination of characters that we regard as diagnostic for seed cones of early-divergent Cupressaceae and helps to clarify the sequence of structural changes {{that occurred during the}} transition from ancestral voltzialean conifers to morphologically recognizable Cupressaceae. Hypotheses of homology underpinning such transformational series can be tested by ongoing reciprocal illumination between the morphology of fossil taxa and the morphogenesis and developmental genetics of their extant crown-group relatives...|$|E

50|$|Nebulasaurus is an extinct genus of basal eusauropod dinosaur {{known from}} the early Middle Jurassic Zhanghe Formation (<b>Aalenian</b> or Bajocian <b>stage)</b> of Yunnan Province, China. It is known only from the holotype braincase LDRC-v.d.1. A phylogenetic {{analysis}} found Nebulasaurus to be a sister taxon to Spinophorosaurus from the Middle Jurassic of Africa. This discovery is significant paleontologically because it represents a clade of basal eusauropods previously unknown from Asia.|$|R
50|$|The {{exposures}} are of Middle Jurassic sediments of the <b>Aalenian</b> and Bajocian <b>Stages,</b> and are nationally {{important for}} {{research of the}} period in the United Kingdom. The strata are Lower Inferior Oolite which is overlain with Upper Trigonia Grit. There are no Middle Inferior Oolite strata present. This is {{as a consequence of}} a period of uplift and warping of the crust. This site is a significant example of the effects of this tectonic occurrence.|$|R
5000|$|Amygdalodon ( [...] ; [...] "almond tooth" [...] for its almond shaped teeth) was a genus of herbivorous dinosaur {{with a long}} neck. The dinosaur {{itself is}} from the Toarcian to <b>Aalenian</b> or Bajocian <b>stage</b> of the Jurassic (about 170 million years ago), {{and only a few}} bone {{fragments}} and teeth have been discovered.

40|$|Jurassic radiolarians from 220 {{samples in}} Queen Charlotte Islands, B. C., Williston Lake, B. C., east-central Oregon, Baja California Sur, {{southern}} Spain, Austria, Slovenia, Turkey, Oman, Japan and Argentina were studied {{in order to}} construct global zonation for the Pliensbachian, Toarcian and <b>Aalenian</b> <b>stages.</b> Well-preserved faunas from continuous stratigraphic sections in Queen Charlotte Islands provide the most detailed record for this time interval, and all collections are tied to North American ammonite zones or assemblages. Collections from nearly all other areas lack independent dating except for early Toarcian carbon-isotope dating in Slovenia and late Aalenian ammonites in Spain. A database of 197 widely distributed updated taxonomic species was used to construct a Unitary Association (UA) zonation for the interval. A global sequence of 41 UAs was obtained for {{the top of the}} Sinemurian {{to the base of the}} Bajocian. The first and the last UAs represent the Late Sinemurian and the Early Bajocian respectively. The remaining 39 UAs were merged into nine zones (four Early Pliensbachian, one Late Pliensbachian, one Early Toarcian, one Middle-Late Toarcian, and two Aalenian) according to prominent radiolarian faunal breaks and ammonite data. The new zones are the Canutus tip pen - Katroma clara Zone (latest Sinemurian/earliest Pliensbachian); Zartus mostleri - Pseudoristola megaglobosa, Hsuum mulleri - Trillus elkhornensis and Gigi fustis - Lantus sixi zones (Early Pliensbachian); Eucyrtidiellum nagaiae - Praeparvicingula tlellensis Zone (Late Pliensbachian); Napora relica - Eucyrtidiellum disparile Zone (Early Toarcian); Elodium pessagnoi - Hexasaturnalis hexagonus Zone (Middle and Late Toarcian); Higumastra transversa - Napora nipponica Zone (early Aalenian); and Mirifusus proavus - Transhsuum hisuikyoense Zone (late Aalenian). These zones can be correlated worldwide and link previously established UA zonations for the Hettangian-Sinemurian and the Middle to Upper Jurassic. The new zonation allows high-resolution dating in the studied interval and provides a solid basis for analyzing faunal turnovers and the paleobiogeography of Jurassic radiolarians.
