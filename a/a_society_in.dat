5|$|In a status-conscious society {{like that}} of the Romans, {{clothing}} and personal adornment gave immediate visual clues about the etiquette of interacting with the wearer. Wearing the correct clothing was supposed to reflect <b>a</b> <b>society</b> <b>in</b> good order. The toga was the distinctive national garment of the Roman male citizen, but it was heavy and impractical, worn mainly for conducting political business and religious rites, and for going to court. The clothing Romans wore ordinarily was dark or colourful, and the most common male attire seen daily throughout the provinces would have been tunics, cloaks, and in some regions trousers. The study of how Romans dressed in daily life is complicated by a lack of direct evidence, since portraiture may show the subject in clothing with symbolic value, and surviving textiles from the period are rare.|$|E
25|$|In his {{writings}} from that period, Mariátegui observed that fascism {{was a response}} to deep social crisis, that it based itself on the petty bourgeoisie of town and country, and that it relied heavily on a cult of violence. According to him, fascism was the price that <b>a</b> <b>society</b> <b>in</b> crisis paid for the failures of the left.|$|E
25|$|Unlike similar formulations, {{as in the}} Labour Party’s {{original}} {{wording of}} Clause IV, it deliberately excludes the means of exchange. This highlights a central characteristic of the party as remaining advocates of socialism as <b>a</b> <b>society</b> <b>in</b> which the need for money is eliminated. As such it rejects that the economic calculation problem is a barrier to such a society.|$|E

25|$|In 1766, Reverend Laurence Coughlan {{arrived in}} Newfoundland {{and opened a}} school at Black Head in Conception Bay. In the late 1760s, two Methodist lay preachers emigrated to America and formed societies. Philip Embury began the work in New York at the {{instigation}} of fellow Irish Methodist Barbara Heck. Soon, Captain Webb from the British Army aided him. He formed <b>a</b> <b>society</b> <b>in</b> Philadelphia and traveled along the coast.|$|E
25|$|The Puritans {{had created}} <b>a</b> <b>society</b> <b>in</b> which Congregationalism {{was the state}} church, its ministers were {{supported}} by tax payers, and only full church members could vote in elections. To ensure that the colony had a supply of educated ministers, Harvard University was founded in 1636. By 1640, 18 churches had been gathered in Massachusetts. In addition, Puritans established the Connecticut Colony in 1636 and New Haven Colony in 1637. Eventually, there were 33 Congregational churches in New England.|$|E

25|$|Gopal Baba Walangkar (ca. 1840-1900) is {{generally}} considered to be the pioneer of the Dalit movement, seeking <b>a</b> <b>society</b> <b>in</b> which they were not discriminated. This is despite the work of Harichand Thakur (ca. 1812-1878) with his Matua organisation that involved the Namasudra (Chandala) community in Bengal Presidency, British India. Ambedkar himself believed Walangkar to be the progenitor. Another early social reformer who worked to improve conditions for Dalits was Jyotirao Phule (1827-1890).|$|E
25|$|His {{care in the}} {{institution}} of a pagan hierarchy in opposition {{to that of the}} Christians was due to his wish to create <b>a</b> <b>society</b> <b>in</b> which every aspect {{of the life of the}} citizens was to be connected, through layers of intermediate levels, to the consolidated figure of the Emperor— the final provider for all the needs of his people. Within this project, there was no place for a parallel institution, such as the Christian hierarchy or Christian charity.|$|E
25|$|Feminist {{science fiction}} {{is focused on}} {{theories}} that include {{but are not limited}} to gender inequality, sexuality, race, economics, and reproduction. Feminist SF is political because of its tendency to critique the dominant culture. Some of the most notable feminist science fiction works have illustrated these themes using utopias to explore <b>a</b> <b>society</b> <b>in</b> which gender differences or gender power imbalances do not exist, or dystopias to explore worlds in which gender inequalities are intensified, thus asserting a need for feminist work to continue.|$|E

25|$|Les Baigneuses—as Robert Delaunay's 1912 City of Paris, and to {{some extent}} Jean Metzinger's 1913 Meudon Landscape—juxtaposes sharply {{contrasting}} elements. On the one hand the artist includes elements from <b>a</b> <b>society</b> <b>in</b> the process of inexorable industrialization, and on the other, the sereneness of timeless classical nude figures (something rarely painted by Gleizes, as Brooke points out). Yet the relationships between the two are formally resolved. This aspect of simultaneity—the optimistic reconciliation of classical tradition and contemporary life—was of particular interest to Gleizes, as it was to the Section d'Or group of Cubists (also known as the Passy group, or Puteaux group).|$|E
25|$|Each of the {{societies}} had {{a link to}} <b>a</b> <b>society</b> <b>in</b> the class year before it and after it; that is, members of one freshman society would all get elected to the same sophomore society year after year, and so on, so {{that there were two}} or three parallel sets of linked societies. From time to time, there would be a coup, and one society would break the pattern, forcing the other societies to likewise change election strategies, or cause {{the creation of a new}} society. Delta Kappa Epsilon, a junior society, was created in reaction to a botched election process to the junior class societies in 1844.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the Japanese occupation, the Government of Hong Kong held a {{monopoly}} on the purchase and distribution of food and raw materials including rice and cotton yarn. Price controls by the Government were not eliminated until 1953. The period can best be summarised by low resources and an endless increase in population. Many mainlanders would cross the border to Hong Kong and establish illegal huts on rooftops and edge of mountains. The integration of different groups from China and original tenants of Hong Kong would also create <b>a</b> <b>society</b> <b>in</b> which everyone had to wrestle with the overwhelming number of language dialects.|$|E

25|$|Ilium also {{includes}} allusions {{to the work}} of Nabokov. The most apparent of these are the inclusion of Ardis Hall and the names of Ada, Daeman and Marina, all borrowed from Ada or Ardor: A Family Chronicle. The society that the old-style humans live in also resembles that of Antiterra, a parallel of our Earth circa 19th century, which features <b>a</b> <b>society</b> <b>in</b> which there exists a lack of repression and Christian morality, shown by Daeman's intent to seduce his cousin. Simmons {{also includes}} references to Nabokov's fondness for butterflies, such as the butterfly genetics incorporated in the old-style humans and Daeman's enthusiasm as a lepidopterist.|$|E
25|$|Tsjalling Halbertsma's oeuvre {{was fairly}} limited, and {{consisted}} {{for a large}} part of rhymes written for the occasion of Shrove Tuesday and New Year, weigh-house notes, accompanying texts for prints, and fortune-telling notes, partly in West Frisian, but to a considerable degree, especially in the early years, in Dutch. Furthermore, it is known that, even before his brothers Justus and Eeltsje published their De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar in 1822, Tsjalling Halbertsma also wrote small tales and poems for <b>a</b> <b>society</b> <b>in</b> Grou. It is unclear what sort of society this was, but it seems very likely it was a remnant of a so-called 'people's society' from the French period, such as were established all over Friesland from 1795 on.|$|E
25|$|But it is {{possible}} that the politicians of the 1850s were not inept. More recent studies have kept elements of the revisionist interpretation alive, emphasizing the role of political agitation (the efforts of Democratic politicians of the South and Republican politicians in the North to keep the sectional conflict at the center of the political debate). David Herbert Donald (1920–2009), a student of Randall, argued in 1960 that the politicians of the 1850s were not unusually inept but that they were operating in <b>a</b> <b>society</b> <b>in</b> which traditional restraints were being eroded in the face of the rapid extension of democracy. The stability of the two-party system kept the union together, but would collapse in the 1850s, thus reinforcing, rather than suppressing, sectional conflict. The union, Donald said, died of democracy.|$|E

25|$|Much {{as that of}} Les Baigneuses and Man on a Balcony (Portrait of Dr. Théo Morinaud) {{painted the}} same year, {{the subject matter of}} Harvest Threshing—a semi-urban {{landscape}} that possesses both rural and semi-industrial components, juxtaposing sharply contrasting elements of both traditional and modern life—is derived from an unsentimental observation of the world. On the one hand the artist makes illusion to the traditional process of threshing—a step in grain preparation after harvesting and before winnowing, now mostly done by machine—and on the other, the artist includes elements from <b>a</b> <b>society</b> <b>in</b> the process of inexorable industrialization. Yet the compositional relationships between the two are formally resolved. The representation of this transition between classical tradition and contemporary life was noticeably of interest to Gleizes, as it was to other artists of the Section d'Or.|$|E
25|$|The {{politicians}} of the 1850s were acting in <b>a</b> <b>society</b> <b>in</b> which the traditional restraints that suppressed sectional {{conflict in the}} 1820s and 1850s– {{the most important of}} which being the stability of the two-party system– were being eroded as this rapid extension of democracy went forward in the North and South. It was an era when the mass political party galvanized voter participation to 80% or 90% turnout rates, and a time in which politics formed an essential component of American mass culture. Historians agree that political involvement was a larger concern to the average American in the 1850s than today. Politics was, in one of its functions, a form of mass entertainment, a spectacle with rallies, parades, and colorful personalities. Leading politicians, moreover, often served as a focus for popular interests, aspirations, and values.|$|E
25|$|Political, {{economic}} and artistic shifts provided {{a context for}} the early manifestations of expressionist architecture; particularly in Germany, where the utopian qualities of expressionism found strong resonances with a leftist artistic community keen to provide answers to <b>a</b> <b>society</b> <b>in</b> turmoil {{during and after the}} events of World War I. The loss of the war, the subsequent removal of Kaiser Wilhelm II, the depravations and the rise of social democracy and the optimism of the Weimar republic created a reluctance amongst architects to pursue projects initiated before the war and provided the impetus to seek new solutions. An influential body of the artistic community, including architects, sought a similar revolution as had occurred in Russia. The costly and grandiose remodelling of the Grosses Schauspielhaus, was more reminiscent of the imperial past, than wartime budgeting and post-war depression.|$|E
