40|$|The {{automated}} teller machine (ATM) {{has become}} an increasinglymore {{important part of the}} <b>average</b> modern consumer’s <b>financial</b> <b>life</b> and for this reason presents an ever-more pressing set of difficult antitrust questions for networks, financial institutions and government decisionmakers. Thirty-two years ago, the Supreme Court emphasized in its landmark Philadelphia National Bank decision that convenience and location were key to competition in the retail banking sector and ruled that “the fact that banking is a highly regulated industry critical to the Nation’s welfare makes the play of competition not less important, but more so. ” Today ATMs are the key to consumer convenience in banking, and yet {{it is not at all}} clear that the Supreme Court’s Philadelphia National Bank message about the importance of competition has gotten through to the policymakers and courts making decisions about ATM networks. In the last decade, large and successful ArM networks have been created, and such names as MAC, NYCE, STAR and HONOR have become familiar landmarks in different parts of the country Meanwhile, the number of ATM network alternatives available in any particular region has continued to decrease. Why has antitrust policy been such a random—and not particularly construe...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) {{on the cost of}} equity capital (COE) for a sample of companies in the European continent. Contrary to expectation, the initial finding suggests that CSR has a positive relationship with COE. However, a more in-depth analysis reveals that for companies with above <b>average</b> <b>financial</b> performance, there is a negative relationship between CSR and COE. However, in the case of companies with below <b>average</b> <b>financial</b> performance, the study did not find any significant relationship between CSR and COE. The results also show that participation in manufacturing industry, retail trade industry and transportation, communication and electric services industry by the companies with above <b>average</b> <b>financial</b> performance results in a lower COE. On the other hand, participation in mining industry, which has a negative impact on the environment, results in a higher COE. These results are specific for the companies in the European region for the period 2005 to 2010, a period which was tainted with economic recession...|$|R
