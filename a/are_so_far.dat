5|$|Tantalum is {{estimated}} to make up about 1ppm or 2ppm of the Earth's crust by weight. There are many species of tantalum minerals, only some of which <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> being used by industry as raw materials: tantalite, microlite, wodginite, euxenite, polycrase. Tantalite (Fe, Mn)Ta2O6 {{is the most important}} mineral for tantalum extraction. Tantalite has the same mineral structure as columbite (Fe, Mn) (Ta, Nb)2O6; when there is more tantalum than niobium it is called tantalite and when there is more niobium than tantalum is it called columbite (or niobite). The high density of tantalite and other tantalum containing minerals makes the use of gravitational separation the best method. Other minerals include samarskite and fergusonite.|$|E

5|$|At the Middle Preclassic city of Nakbe in {{the central}} lowlands, Maya sculptors were {{producing}} {{some of the earliest}} lowland Maya stelae, depicting richly dressed individuals. Nakbe Stela1 has been dated to around 400BC. It was broken into pieces, but originally represented two elaborately dressed figures facing each other, and perhaps represents the transference of power from one ruler to his successor, however it also has features that recall the myth of the Maya Hero Twins, and would be the earliest known presentation of them. Around 200BC the enormous nearby city of ElMirador had started to erect stela-like monuments, bearing inscriptions that appear to be glyphs but that <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> unreadable. Stela dating to the Late Preclassic period are also known from the sites of El Tintal, Cival, and San Bartolo in Guatemala, and Actuncan and Cahal Pech in Belize.|$|E
25|$|For this viewpoint, {{one should}} {{consider}} how the archetypical scattering experiment is performed. The initial particles are prepared in well defined states where they <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> apart that they don't interact. They are somehow made to interact, and the final particles are registered when they <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> apart that they have ceased to interact. The idea {{is to look for}} states in the Heisenberg picture that in the distant past had the appearance of free particle states. This will be the in states. Likewise, an out state will be a state that in the distant future has the appearance of a free particle state.|$|E

25|$|The only {{difficulty}} is that most systems like the Hulse–Taylor binary <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> away. The amplitude of waves given off by the Hulse–Taylor binary at Earth would be roughly h ≈ 10−26.

25|$|Unfortunately, TNOs <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> {{from the}} Sun {{that they are}} very cold, hence {{producing}} black-body radiation around 60 micrometres in wavelength. This wavelength of light is impossible to observe on the Earth's surface, but only from space using, e.g. the Spitzer Space Telescope. For ground-based observations, astronomers observe the tail of the black-body radiation in the far infrared. This far infrared radiation is so dim that the thermal method is only applicable to the largest KBOs.|$|E

25|$|With a 455kHz IF {{it is easy}} to get {{adequate}} {{front end}} selectivity with broadcast band (under 1600kHz) signals. For example, if the station being received is on 600kHz, the local oscillator will be set to 600 + 455 = 1055kHz. But a station on 1510kHz could also potentially produce an IF of 455kHz and so cause image interference. However, because 600kHz and 1510kHz <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> apart, {{it is easy to}} design the front end tuning to reject the 1510kHz frequency.|$|E
25|$|P. gibbosus has a sting that {{is painful}} and menacing enough to deter most {{potential}} predators. P. gibbosuss black and yellow coloring {{serves as a}} warning to other organisms, as that color pattern often indicates a dangerous species. Additionally, the burrowing behavior of P. gibbosus provides the species with a suitable hiding spot to avoid predators. Because the burrows <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> into the ground, usually around two feet, P. gibbosus is able to avoid predation by remaining in its burrow.|$|E
25|$|Taqī al-Dīn {{tried to}} {{disprove}} the widely held belief that light is emitted by {{the eye and}} not the object that is being observed. He explained that, if light came from our eyes at a constant velocity it would take much too long to illuminate the stars {{for us to see}} them while we are still looking at them, because they <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> away. Therefore, the illumination must be coming from the stars so we can see them as soon as we open our eyes.|$|E

25|$|A ship will sink if the {{transverse}} bulkheads <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> apart that flooding {{a single}} compartment would consume all the ship's reserve buoyancy. Aside from the possible protection of machinery, or areas most susceptible to damage, such a ship {{would be no}} better than a ship without watertight subdivision, and is called a one-compartment ship. A ship capable of remaining afloat when any single watertight compartment is flooded is called a two-compartment ship, but damage destroying the tightness of a transverse bulkhead may cause flooding of two compartments and loss of the ship. A ship able to remain afloat with any two compartments flooded is called a three-compartment ship, and will withstand damage to one transverse bulkhead.|$|E

According to GWI's Turnaround Plan, the utility's average billing efficiency in the 2003-2006 period was only 68%, meaning that 32% of its customers did not pay their bills. In 2006 GWI collected revenues of only G$ 1.2billion, while {{operation and maintenance costs}} stood at G$ 3.5billion, including more than 60% paid for electricity, mainly for pumping. The difference was partly made up by a government subsidy of G$ 1.4billion, and partly resulted in unpaid bills to GWI's suppliers and deferred maintenance.|$|E

25|$|Moths {{frequently}} {{appear to}} circle artificial lights, although {{the reason for}} this behavior remains unknown. One hypothesis to explain this behavior is that moths use a technique of celestial navigation called transverse orientation. By maintaining a constant angular relationship to a bright celestial light, such as the moon, they can fly in a straight line. Celestial objects <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> away that, even after travelling great distances, the change in angle between the moth and the light source is negligible; further, the moon will always be in {{the upper part of the}} visual field, or on the horizon. When a moth encounters a much closer artificial light and uses it for navigation, the angle changes noticeably after only a short distance, in addition to being often below the horizon. The moth instinctively attempts to correct by turning toward the light, thereby causing airborne moths to come plummeting downward, and resulting in a spiral flight path that gets closer and closer to the light source.|$|E
