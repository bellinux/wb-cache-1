2500|$|I've {{given up}} {{speaking}} to them. I've said basically everything that possibly {{can be said}} to this bunch. I'm basically leaving it up to them now. They <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> me if they really want to play for Australia and whether they really want to play under me. I'll find out over the next three games and my decision will be made as to my future as a captain and a player after that... I don't think it's my captaincy... but if we continue to lose, you've just got to start saying: [...] "Right, someone else has to come in and see if they can do something different." [...] It just gets as simple as that. That's the way I see it. The fellows are not responding to me and that's that. I'll find out over the next three games if that's the case or not.|$|E

6000|$|... "You <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> us," [...] said Rollo's mother, [...] "that {{there are}} two {{different}} kinds of magnetisms in the two ends of the bar." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> {{off your}} nasty temper," [...] {{said the girl}} severely, [...] "you’d better go forward. It’s not quite the thing after all {{for you to be}} down here—not that I study {{appearances}} much." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't you {{remember}} you {{said last night}} that you thought the world a very stupid, grown-up place, {{because there were no}} giants and fairies in it now? Well, perhaps there are fairies, and they <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> themselves to you, if you watch well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{great and}} good friend, I {{hear that you}} <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> us your navy, in order to impress us {{with a sense of}} your power. How needless the expense! To prove to you that we already know all about it, I inclose {{herewith}} a list and description of all the ships you have." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You—you <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> me a {{photograph}} of your first ship," [...] said the latter, after a long pause. [...] "Don’t trouble if it’s upstairs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> {{you there}} <b>is</b> nothing in that charge. Not quite logical, is it, but sit still there {{and listen to}} me." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, Sally Dows, YOU here! who'd {{have thought}} of seeing you to-day? Why, Chet Brooks allowed that you danced every set last night and didn't get home till daylight. And you--you that <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> up at another party to-night too! Well, I reckon I haven't got that much {{ambition}} these times. And out with your new bonnet too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not going}} to be a {{lecturer}} to-day. I'm {{not going to}} analyze the plays of Shaw which I assigned to you. You're supposed to have read them yourselves. I am going to imagine that I am at tea in New Haven, or down in New York, at dinner in the basement of the old Brevoort, talking with a bunch of men who are trying to find out where the world is going, and why and when and how, and asking who are the prophets who <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> it the way. We'd be getting excited over Shaw and Wells. There's something really worth getting excited over.|$|E
6000|$|... "Apparently, no. In reality, yes. Your manner {{was exactly}} right. Reserved, yet not haughty. Just what an eminent cat-fancier's manner should be. I {{could see that}} you made a {{pronounced}} hit with Comrade Jarvis. By the way, if you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> up at the office to-morrow, {{perhaps it would be}} as well if you were to look up a few facts bearing on the feline world. There is no knowing what thirst for information a night's rest may not give Comrade Jarvis. I do not presume to dictate, but if you were to make yourself a thorough master of the subject of catnip, for instance, it might quite possibly come in useful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, then; it's all right. I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> you. I did not {{suppose that}} you knew {{how to take care}} of {{yourself}} so well." ...|$|R

After the execution, she said [...] "We are going to prove his innocence, and when we do, we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> that Gov.

And that only they could happen to the French. Mmmm I said, in this movie <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> to the French that here in Mexico too there is imagination. I sent for a bag of black nylon panties in every sizes. On the beach scene did you put to all the dancers, so when lifted their legs, it seemed that they did not bring anything. This goes for the French.|$|E
5000|$|... it is a VERY {{ambitious and}} amazing game, {{not only one}} with {{stunning}} graphics. The key feature is, of course, the ability to capture the enemy's weapons and special units, {{and the use of}} wind and fire - which has never been done in a RTS game before in the way we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> you ... When we look into the communities of various RTS games, we always see a high demand for realistic features. In Sparta, players {{will be able to get}} most of them, so they can actually FEEL the new features - and you can imagine what this means for new tactics and strategic decisions during matches.
