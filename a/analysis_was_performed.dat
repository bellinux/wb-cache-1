5|$|A {{radiocarbon}} dating {{analysis of the}} papyrus by the Arizona Accelerator Mass Spectrometry Laboratory in 2013 dated the papyrus to between 404 and 209 BC. However, the cleaning protocol had to be interrupted during processing to preserve the fragment. A second <b>analysis</b> <b>was</b> <b>performed</b> by Harvard University and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution found a mean date of AD 741. A Raman spectroscopy analysis at Columbia University found that the ink was consistent with those in manuscripts from 400 BC to AD 700–800. These analyses suggest that the fragment as a material artifact is probably medieval and not modern.|$|E
5|$|While the BTO {{is able to}} {{determine}} {{the distance between the}} satellite and the aircraft at the time of each handshake, it was still necessary {{to determine}} where along the BTO arcs the aircraft was. To accomplish this, an <b>analysis</b> <b>was</b> <b>performed</b> on another attribute of received signals that was recorded by the ground station: the burst frequency offset (BFO)—the difference between the expected and actual frequencies of the signal received from the aircraft. The BFO is primarily caused by the Doppler shift—a shift in frequency caused by the relative movement of the aircraft, satellite, and ground station—along with several other factors which can be calculated and removed, allowing the Doppler shift between the aircraft and satellite to be isolated. The Doppler shift between the aircraft and satellite indicates the relative motion of the aircraft relative to the satellite, although multiple combinations of aircraft speed and heading exist that match a given Doppler shift value.|$|E

Y-chromosomes are paternally inherited, so Y-STR analysis can help {{in the identification of}} paternally related males. Y-STR <b>analysis</b> <b>was</b> <b>performed</b> in the Sally Hemings controversy to determine if Thomas Jefferson had sired a son with one of his slaves.|$|E
25|$|In a 2008 study a joint <b>analysis</b> <b>was</b> <b>performed</b> for {{the first}} time on Swedish and Finnish {{autosomal}} genotypes. Swedish-speakers from Ostrobothnia (reference population of the study representing 40% of all Swedish-speakers in Finland) did not differ significantly from the neighbouring, adjacent Finnish-speaking populations but formed a genetic cluster with the Swedes and also the amount of genetic admixture between the groups which have taken place historically. According to a 2008 Y-DNA study, a Swedish-speaking reference group from Larsmo, Ostrobothnia, differed significantly from the Finnish-speaking sub-populations in the country in terms of Y-STR variation. This study however was comparing one small Swedish-speaking municipality of 4652 inhabitants to Finnish-speaking provinces and only tells about the origin of two different Y-DNA haplotypes.|$|E
25|$|Expert ESA {{personnel}} were immediately dispatched from Europe to the United States to direct operations. Days passed without contact from SOHO. On July 23, the Arecibo Observatory and Goldstone Solar System Radar combined to locate SOHO with radar, {{and to determine}} its location and attitude. SOHO was close to its predicted position, oriented with its side versus the usual front Optical Surface Reflector panel pointing toward the Sun, and was rotating at one revolutions every 53 seconds. Once SOHO was located, plans for contacting SOHO were formed. On August 3 a carrier was detected from SOHO, the first signal since June 25. After days of charging the battery, a successful {{attempt was made to}} modulate the carrier and downlink telemetry on August 8. After instrument temperatures were downlinked on August 9, data <b>analysis</b> <b>was</b> <b>performed,</b> and planning for the SOHO recovery began in earnest.|$|E

In 1958, Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann reported {{a relatively low}} concentration of 0.02% psilocybin, but this <b>analysis</b> <b>was</b> <b>performed</b> on two-year-old specimens. Jonathan Ott and Guzmán indicated the presence of psilocybin in the variety bonartii. In terms of psychoactive potency, Paul Stamets rates P.aztecorum as [...] "moderately to highly active".|$|E
500|$|Prior to September 2005, {{comparative}} bullet-lead <b>analysis</b> <b>was</b> <b>performed</b> on bullets {{found at}} a scene that were too destroyed for striation comparison. The technique would attempt to determine the unique elemental breakdown of the bullet and compare it to seized bullets possessed by a suspect. Review of the method found that the breakdown of elements found in bullets could be significantly different enough to potentially allow for two bullets from separate sources to be correlated to each other. However, {{there is not enough}} differences to definitely match a bullet from a crime scene to one taken from a suspect's possession. An additional report in 2004 from the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) found that the testimony given regarding comparative bullet-lead analysis was overstated and potentially [...] "misleading under the federal rules of evidence". In 2005, the Federal Bureau of Investigation indicated that they would no longer be performing this type of analysis.|$|E

2500|$|Such an <b>analysis</b> <b>was</b> <b>performed</b> by Di Ventra and Pershin {{with regard}} to the genuine current-controlled memristor. As the {{proposed}} dynamic state equation [...] provides no physical mechanism enabling such a memristor to cope with inevitable thermal fluctuations, a current-controlled memristor would erratically change its state in course of time just under the influence of current noise. Di Ventra and Pershin thus concluded that memristors whose resistance (memory) states depend solely on the current or voltage history would be unable to protect their memory states against unavoidable Johnson–Nyquist noise and permanently suffer from information loss, a so-called [...] "stochastic catastrophe". A current-controlled memristor can thus not exist as a solid state device in physical reality.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{aircraft}} {{of the era}} {{are often}} described a constructed of sticks and canvas their construction was of considerable sophistication. [...] Wooden construction typically involved several different types of timber, with careful use of different woods according to their mechanical properties; ash and spruce were the most commonly used, although hickory, mahogany and poplar were among the other timbers employed. [...] Struts were frequently [...] hollow members formed by spindling out two pieces of wood and then glueing them together, usually using a tongue in groove joint to strengthen the joint. Wing spars were also often composite members, and the wing ribs were complex structures. [...] When flying replicas of the 1910 Bristol Boxkite were made for the 1966 film Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines, a modern stress <b>analysis</b> <b>was</b> <b>performed,</b> {{and concluded that the}} airframe was close to conforming to modern requirements.|$|E
