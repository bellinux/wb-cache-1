50|$|In {{concordance}} {{with the}} introduction of the Integra's platform mate, the seventh-generation Civic being introduced in 2000, the Integra joined the Civic in abandoning Honda's traditional double-wishbone suspension at both ends and adopted MacPherson struts in the front and trailing <b>arm</b> <b>type</b> suspension in the rear along with the new K-series engine supplanting the B-series.|$|E
5000|$|The {{suspension}} incorporated {{rack and}} pinion steering and MacPherson strut suspension at the front, and semi-trailing <b>arm</b> <b>type</b> independent suspension at the rear.

50|$|The push <b>arm</b> <b>type</b> {{stair climber}} have an arm fitted {{to the bottom}} of the truck that folds out and down, pushing on the step above and in so doing lifting the truck up in an arc to rest on that step. Repetitions of this {{movement}} allow the truck to move up the stairs. The mechanical opposite of this motion allows the unit move down stairs, many units also employ a forward only braking system to stop the stair climber rolling of the edge of a step. There a few notable variants of this type.|$|E
5000|$|The basic {{vehicle is}} powered by indigenously {{manufactured}} 6-cylinder, opposed piston, vertical in line, water cooled, two stroke CI engine with uni-flow scavenging coupled to a semiautomatic transmission with 6 forward and 2 reverse speed [...] suspension is provided by trailing <b>arm</b> <b>type</b> torsion bar with all road wheel stations the vehicle also has secondary torsion bars and double acting telescope shock absorbers in the two front and rear stations. Low ground pressure, adequate power-to-weight ratio improved suspension and final drive result in good mobility of the vehicle.|$|E
50|$|Like its predecessor, the three-litre engine had a {{cast iron}} block, an {{aluminium}} head with hemispherical combustion chambers, two valves per cylinder, angled 90° and timed by directly acting, chain driven dual overhead camshafts. Fed by a twin-choke carburettor, it developed , {{sent to the}} rear wheels through a 4-speed all-synchromesh gearbox with a column-mounted shifter as on the 6C 2500.The car used unit body construction, had a wheelbase of 3.05 m and a dry weight of 1,400 kg. The all-independent suspension was of the double wishbone type with coil springs upfront, and trailing <b>arm</b> <b>type</b> with transverse torsion bars at the rear.|$|E

25|$|NGC 3981 is {{a spiral}} galaxy with two wide spiral <b>arms,</b> of <b>type</b> SBbc. It is {{magnitude}} 12 with {{a diameter of}} 3'. This galaxy was discovered by William Herschel in 1785.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two main}} types of apparatus: an arm-type {{parallelogram}} apparatus based on a hinged arm; and a track-type apparatus which moves on a rail mounted {{to the top of}} the drawing board. The accuracy of the <b>arm</b> <b>type</b> apparatus is better in the middle of the board, decreasing towards the edges, whereas a track machine has a constant accuracy over the whole board. The drawing head of a track-type drafting machine slides on bearings in a vertical rail, which in turn is moved along a horizontal, top-mounted rail. Both apparatus types have an adjustable drawing-head with rules attached to a protractor scale so that the angle of the rules may be adjusted.|$|E
5000|$|Rice states: The {{military}} {{definition of}} STOL (500 ft to a 50 ft obstacle) allows takeoff and landing {{in most of}} the areas in which limited war might be fought. In addition, the airplane was designed to use roads so that operation would even be possible in jungle areas where clearings are few and far between. As a result the wingspan was to be limited to twenty feet and a heavy trailing <b>arm</b> <b>type</b> landing gear with a tread of 6.5 ft was provided for operation from roads. Float operation was to be feasible......it is quite feasible to design the various components {{so that it can be}} disassembled easily and stored in a box that would fit in a 6×6 truck bed together with the equipment needed for re-assembly in the field. It could thus be transported by amphibious shipping and either heli-lifted or driven ashore by a 6×6 truck.|$|E
50|$|Next Giacosa and {{his team}} {{designed}} a replacement for the Fiat Topolino. The last version of the 500C had been discontinued the previous year 1954. The 600 was a totally new car, and for Fiat a new layout with the engine at the rear as well as unitary construction. When the 600 were introduced in 1955, rear-engined cars had been produced {{for well over a}} decade and their advantages and disadvantages by then well known. Giacosa used the advantages to produce a four-seat car, although with limited luggage space, that had a reasonable performance from an engine of only 633 cc, due to its low weight of 585 kg and also compact dimensions. Capable of almost 100 km/h (62 mph) and returning a fuel consumption of 16 to 20 km/l and the ability to cruise at 80 km/h (50 mph). He overcame the stability problems associated with other rear-engined designs by identifying that the problem was not the weight distribution of the cars, but the simple swing axle rear suspension used in those designs. His answer was to use a semi-trailing <b>arm</b> <b>type</b> of rear suspension that eliminated the large change in the camber of the rear wheels that was inherent with the simple swing axle suspension system.|$|E
2500|$|As {{aerial warfare}} developed, the Allies (especially the French) gained a lead over the Germans by {{introducing}} machine-gun <b>armed</b> <b>types</b> {{such as the}} Vickers F.B.5 Gunbus fighter and the Morane-Saulnier L. By early 1915, the German Oberste Heeresleitung (OHL, Army High Command) had ordered the development of machine-gun-armed aircraft, to counter those of the Allies. The new [...] "C" [...] class armed two-seaters and twin-engined [...] "K" [...] (later [...] "G") class aircraft such as the AEG G.I were attached in ones and twos to Feldflieger Abteilungen (artillery-observation and reconnaissance detachments) for [...] "fighter" [...] sorties, mostly for the escort of unarmed aircraft.|$|R

40|$|The {{dependence}} of molecular gas emission on various global galaxy properties is tested by examining {{a series of}} correlations. CO luminosities of entire galaxies are correlated with their H I content, blue luminosity, disk area, far-infrared luminosity, Hubble type, Elmegreen <b>arm</b> <b>type,</b> DDO luminosity class, total B-V color, disk B-V color, and H-alpha emission. A weighted correlation test is derived and applied to correct for the strong Malmquist bias in the available CO observations of galaxies. The relative strengths of the correlations indicate that molecular emission has a strong dependence on galaxy scale, a weak dependence on galaxy form, and is closely linked to tracers of star forming regions...|$|E

40|$|Shinkansen noise can be {{classified}} into four categories; pantograph noise, aerodynamic noise from the train nose, aerodynamic noise from the upper parts of cars, and noise from the lower parts of cars and structure-borne noise as shown Fig. 1. Pantograph noise is one of main sources of noise. Pantograph noise is composed of aerodynamic noise from the pantograph itself, spark noise caused by contact loss, and sliding noise generated between the contact strips and the overhead contact line. If there is a decreased amount of contact loss, most of the pantograph noise is due to aerodynamic noise from the pantograph itself (including insulators). Therefore, the noise sources of the PS 207 type pantograph (Fig. 2) were investigated in detail, and two types of low-noise pantograph were developed; a<-shaped <b>arm</b> <b>type</b> pantograph, which is an improve...|$|E
