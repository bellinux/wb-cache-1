The study also examined {{the nature of these}} relationships in a longitudinal assessment over the course <b>of</b> a university <b>semester.</b> 213 first year undergraduate students (146 females and 67 males) completed the Aitken Procrastination Inventory, the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale, the Academic Locus of Control Scale, and the Perceived Stress scale within the first four weeks <b>of</b> a university <b>semester,</b> and again one week before the end <b>of</b> <b>semester</b> examination period. High procrastination at both the start and the end <b>of</b> the <b>semester</b> was related to an external academic locus of control and low levels of self-oriented perfectionism.

Three research questions were addressed: students’ responses toward the implementation of TBL, oral communication strategies used, and shifts in use of oral communication strategies after the implementation of TBL for one semester. The study employed both quantitative and qualitative measurement of the data. Findings at the beginning <b>of</b> <b>semester</b> were compared to those at the end <b>of</b> <b>semester.</b> Reliability <b>of</b> the data was maintained through multi methods employed, including Oral Communication Strategy Inventory (OCSI) administered {{at the beginning and}} end <b>of</b> <b>semester,</b> learning journals <b>of</b> 26 students administered throughout the semester, focus group discussion with twelve students conducted at the end <b>of</b> <b>semester,</b> in-depth interviews with ten students to confirm the findings from the OCSI, stimulated recall interviews with fourteen students conducted at the end <b>of</b> <b>semester,</b> and video-taped classroom activities held throughout the semester. Findings indicate positive responses to TBL. Toward the end <b>of</b> <b>semester,</b> students believed their oral communication skills had improved. There was evidence of increased self-esteem, risk-taking behaviour, and motivation to learn English. Quantitative findings suggest that, toward the end <b>of</b> <b>semester,</b> students increasingly used positive strategies for coping with both speaking and listening problems. Use of negative strategies was significantly reduced. Qualitative findings confirm quantitative findings, suggesting students’ improved strategic competence in oral communication skills. Positive strategies were increasingly used while negative strategy use was reduced. There was also some evidence that the higher the students’ levels of oral proficiency, the greater the likelihood of their increasing use of positive strategies and reducing the use of negatives strategies. Reasons for this shift reported by students included higher self-esteem, higher motivation to be more actively engaged in communication and to learn English as well as improved linguistic competence, especially in the area of vocabulary...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to examine the link between emotional intelligence abilities, psychological distress levels and mood states among university undergraduates over the duration <b>of</b> a <b>semester</b> <b>of</b> study. The research also focused on the ability to predict student exam performance utilising the constructs of emotional intelligence, psychological distress and mood. This was accomplished through two related studies, both involving data collected from first year students. A sample of 218 undergraduate students from an Australian university completed the Trait Meta Mood Scale (TMMS) to establish their emotional intelligence abilities. They then completed the Brunel Mood Scale (BRUMS) and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS- 21) on three occasions during a university semester to monitor affective responses. Examination performance at the end <b>of</b> <b>semester</b> was recorded. Emotional intelligence was found to influence affective responses, showing a stronger influence on psychological distress than mood states. However, clarity, a component of emotional intelligence, was more closely related to mood states than psychological distress. Of the psychological distress variables, stress scores showed the strongest influence on mood responses. Psychological distress and mood responses both predicted examination performance whereas emotional intelligence did not. High emotional intelligence among students is conducive to a more pleasant and less distressing university experience but does not appear to benefit examination performance. Further, negative affective responses are not necessarily an indication that students will underperform academically. Indeed high negative affect during the beginning <b>of</b> <b>semester</b> and mid-semester is an indicator of success in end <b>of</b> <b>semester</b> examinations. It appears to be important that negative affect abates during the period from mid-semester to the end <b>of</b> <b>semester.</b> Rising negative affect from midsemester to end <b>of</b> <b>semester</b> may be an indication that a student is facing difficulties and could potentially fail their examinations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Today {{there is}} much debate about why {{telemedicine}} has stalled. Teleradiology is the only widespread telemedicine application. Other telemedicine applications appear to be promising candidates for widespread use, but they remain in the early adoption stage. The objective of this debate paper is to achieve a better understanding <b>of</b> the <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> telemedicine, to assist those trying to move applications from pilot stage to routine delivery. Discussion We have investigated the reasons why telemedicine has stalled by focusing on two, high-level topics: 1) the process <b>of</b> <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> telemedicine in comparison with other technologies; and 2) the factors involved in the widespread <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> telemedicine. For each topic, we have formulated hypotheses. First, the advantages for users are the crucial determinant of the speed <b>of</b> <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> technology in healthcare. Second, the <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> telemedicine {{is similar to that}} of other health technologies and follows an S-shaped logistic growth curve. Third, evidence of cost-effectiveness is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the widespread <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> telemedicine. Fourth, personal incentives for the health professionals involved in service provision are needed before the widespread <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> telemedicine will occur. Summary The widespread <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> telemedicine is a major [...] and still underdeveloped [...] challenge that needs to be strengthened through new research directions. We have formulated four hypotheses, which are all susceptible to experimental verification. In particular, we believe that data about the <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> telemedicine should be collected from applications implemented on a large-scale, to test the assumption that the <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> telemedicine follows an S-shaped growth curve. This will lead to a better understanding of the process, which will in turn accelerate the <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> new telemedicine applications in future. Research is also required to identify suitable financial and professional incentives for potential telemedicine users and understand their importance for widespread adoption. </p...|$|R
