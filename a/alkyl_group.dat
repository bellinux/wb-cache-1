40|$|For {{reactions}} of alkyldioxaborolanes with halomethyllithium reagents, migrations of tertiary <b>alkyl</b> <b>groups</b> and benzylic groups often give lower yields of migrated products. The only published computational study calculated {{the barriers to}} tert-alkyl migration to be lower than for other types of simple <b>alkyl</b> <b>groups.</b> In contrast to this, the present work shows that, when detailed conformational analysis is carried out, tert-alkyl and benzylic groups have significantly higher gas phase barriers to migration than for other types of <b>alkyl</b> <b>groups,</b> such that for tertiary <b>alkyl</b> <b>groups,</b> oxygen migration of the ethylenedioxy group could compete. The barriers are reduced when a solvent model is included, which reduces the importance of oxygen migration...|$|R
50|$|The {{increase}} in stability associated with additional substitutions {{is the result}} of several factors. <b>Alkyl</b> <b>groups</b> are electron donating, and increase the electron density on the π bond of the alkene. Also, <b>alkyl</b> <b>groups</b> are sterically large, and are most stable when they are far away from each other. In an alkane, the maximum separation is that of the tetrahedral bond angle, 109.5°. In an alkene, the bond angle increases to near 120°. As a result, the separation between <b>alkyl</b> <b>groups</b> is greatest in the most substituted alkene.|$|R

High diastereoselectivities and excellent enantioselectivities for the major diastereomer (93 - 95 % ee) were achieved with large <b>alkyl</b> <b>groups.</b> For smaller <b>alkyl</b> <b>groups</b> the diastereoselectivities were moderate, but excellent enantioselectivities were obtained for both diastereomers (79 - 94 % ee). 10475...|$|R
25|$|An <b>alkyl</b> <b>group,</b> {{generally}} abbreviated {{with the}} symbol R, is a functional group that, like an alkane, consists solely of single-bonded carbon and hydrogen atoms connected acyclically—for example, a methyl or ethyl group.|$|E
25|$|These {{results show}} that a {{medium-sized}} hydroxy <b>alkyl</b> <b>group,</b> such as CHMeOH and CMe2OH, is favorable for the substituent of the 4-position on the imidazole ring. Furthermore, the ionizable group is favorable for the binding affinity.|$|E
25|$|Alkylation {{occurs when}} a {{molecule}} replaces a hydrogen atom with an <b>alkyl</b> <b>group</b> that generally comes from an organic molecule. Alkyl groups that are found naturally occurring in the environment are organometallic compounds. Organometallic compounds generally contain a methyl, ethyl, or butyl derivative which is the <b>alkyl</b> <b>group</b> that replaces the hydrogen. Other organic compounds, such as methanol, can provide alkyl groups for alkylation. Methanol is found naturally in the environment in small concentrations, and {{has been linked to}} the release from biological decomposition of waste and even a byproduct of vegetation. The following reactions are alkylations of soluble compounds found in creosote preservatives with methanol.|$|E

5000|$|The {{effects of}} steric strain in the {{reaction}} of trialkylamines and trimethylboron were studied by Brown et al. [...] They found that as {{the size of the}} <b>alkyl</b> <b>groups</b> on the amine were increased, the equilibrium constant decreased as well. The shift in equilibrium was attributed to steric strain between the <b>alkyl</b> <b>groups</b> of the amine and the methyl groups on boron.|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} was undertaken {{to determine the}} conformations of <b>alkyl</b> <b>groups</b> that are forced into small spaces. Unbranched <b>alkyl</b> <b>groups</b> assume fully extended conformations in the free space of solutions, because any bends in the structure create steric clashes between hydrogens along the chain. We synthesized a series of alkyl esters of a carboxylic acid attached to the inner surface of a vase-shaped container structure. The shorter esters (ethyl and propyl) can be accommodated in extended conformations, and even small solvent molecules can share the container’s space. Longer (butyl-octyl) esters adopt increasingly coiled conformations that writhe rapidly in the limited space of the cavity. Even longer esters (nonyl and decyl) can be synthesized, but their containers become distorted, and their spectra indicate slowed internal motions of the <b>alkyl</b> <b>groups</b> within the space. In general, <b>alkyl</b> <b>groups</b> are readily contorted when their internal strains are compensated by attraction with the inner surfaces and the proper filling of space...|$|R
25|$|It {{has also}} been {{reported}} that an hydroxy group in the 4-position on the imidazole ring, {{plays an important role}} in the binding affinity and compensates for the disadvantage of lipophilicity of the bulky <b>alkyl</b> <b>group.</b>|$|E
25|$|Friedel–Crafts {{alkylation}} {{involves the}} alkylation of an aromatic ring with an alkyl halide using a strong Lewis acid catalyst. With anhydrous ferric chloride as a catalyst, the <b>alkyl</b> <b>group</b> attaches {{at the former}} site of the chloride ion. The general mechanism is shown below.|$|E
25|$|Alkenyl- and alkynylaluminates {{are most}} {{commonly}} generated through {{the addition of}} n-butyllithium to the alkenylalane. The alkenyl and alkynyl groups, which {{are better able to}} stabilize negative charge, are transferred in preference to the <b>alkyl</b> <b>group.</b> When these intermediates react with alkyl halides, functionalized olefins are produced.|$|E

50|$|Typical anionic {{detergents}} are alkylbenzenesulfonates. The alkylbenzene {{portion of}} these anions is lipophilic and the sulfonate is hydrophilic. Two different varieties have been popularized, those with branched <b>alkyl</b> <b>groups</b> {{and those with}} linear <b>alkyl</b> <b>groups.</b> The former were largely phased out in economically advanced societies because they are poorly biodegradable. An estimated 6 billion kilograms of anionic detergents are produced annually for domestic markets.|$|R
25|$|One set of {{experiments}} involved collected heats of hydrogenation data during gas-phase reactions {{of a range}} of compounds that contained one alkene unit. When comparing a range of monoalkyl-substituted alkenes, they found any <b>alkyl</b> <b>group</b> noticeably increased the stability, but that the choice of different specific alkyl groups had little to no effect.|$|E
25|$|In this {{reaction}} dichloromethyllithium converts the boronic ester into a boronate. A Lewis acid then induces a rearrangement of the <b>alkyl</b> <b>group</b> with {{displacement of the}} chlorine group. Finally an organometallic reagent such as a Grignard reagent displaces the second chlorine atom effectively leading to insertion of an RCH2 group into the C-B bond. Another reaction featuring a boronate alkyl migration is the Petasis reaction.|$|E
25|$|For example, in a {{multiple}} addition of ethyl bromide to benzene, ortho and para substitution is expected {{after the first}} monosubstitution step because an <b>alkyl</b> <b>group</b> is an activating group. However, the actual reaction product is 1,3,5-triethylbenzene with all alkyl groups as a meta substituent. Thermodynamic reaction control makes sure that thermodynamically favored meta substitution with steric hindrance minimized takes prevalence over less favorable ortho and para substitution by chemical equilibration. The ultimate reaction product is thus {{the result of a}} series of alkylations and dealkylations.|$|E
40|$|Recently, a {{new group}} of {{nanostructures}} called "silicone nanofilaments (SNs) " were prepared via polymerization of organosilanes with small <b>alkyl</b> <b>groups.</b> Organosilanes with long <b>alkyl</b> <b>groups</b> tend to form self-assembled monolayers and cannot form SNs because. of their bulky steric hindrance. Here we report the one-step self-assembly of organosilanes with long <b>alkyl</b> <b>groups</b> into SN coatings at room temperature by using tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) or tetrachlorosilane (TCS) as the molecular spacer. The SNs should grow according to a "limiting growth" mechanism via a "seeding-asymmetric growth-further growth" process. The growth of SNs could be controlled simply by the composition of the precursor and the water concentration (C-water) in toluene. All the precursors studied can form SNs successfully under proper conditions, indicating universality of this method. The wettability of the SN coatings ranges from hydrophilic to superhydrophobic and even to superamphiphobic. Moreover, these coatings are transparent and can be easily applied onto various substrates besides the glass slide. This facile fabrication of SNs using organosilanes with tong <b>alkyl</b> <b>groups</b> will shed light on their application in generating unique nanostructures besides self-assembled monolayers...|$|R

25|$|Hydrolysis, a {{reaction}} in which water breaks a bond, {{is a good}} example of the nucleophilic nature of haloalkanes. The polar bond attracts a hydroxide ion, OH− (NaOH(aq) being a common source of this ion). This OH− is a nucleophile with a clearly negative charge, as it has excess electrons it donates them to the carbon, which results in a covalent bond between the two. Thus C–X is broken by heterolytic fission resulting in a halide ion, X−. As can be seen, the OH is now attached to the <b>alkyl</b> <b>group,</b> creating an alcohol. (Hydrolysis of bromoethane, for example, yields ethanol). Reaction with ammonia give primary amines.|$|E
25|$|Silyl ethers are a {{group of}} {{chemical}} compounds which contain a silicon atom covalently bonded to an alkoxy group. The general structure is R1R2R3Si−O−R4 where R4 is an <b>alkyl</b> <b>group</b> or an aryl group. Silyl ethers are usually used as protecting groups for alcohols in organic synthesis. Since R1R2R3 can be combinations of differing groups which can be varied {{in order to provide}} a number of silyl ethers, this group of chemical compounds provides a wide spectrum of selectivity for protecting group chemistry. Common silyl ethers are: trimethylsilyl (TMS), tert-butyldiphenylsilyl (TBDPS), tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS/TBDMS) and triisopropylsilyl (TIPS). They are particularly useful because they can be installed and removed very selectively under mild conditions.|$|E

Tour and his team at Rice University used the NanoPutians in their NanoKids educational outreach program.

25|$|Where {{the radical}} anion is {{initially}} protonated determines {{the structure of}} the product. With an electron donor such as methoxy (MeO) or with an <b>alkyl</b> <b>group,</b> protonation has been thought by some investigators as being ortho (i.e. adjacent or 1,2) to the substituent. Other investigators have thought the protonation is meta (1,3) to the substituent. Arthur Birch favored meta protonation. With electron withdrawing substituents, protonation has been thought to occur {{at the site of the}} substituent (ipso), or para (1,4). Again, there has been varied opinion. A. J. Birch's empirical rules say that for the donor substituents the final product has the maximum number of substituents on the final double bonds. For electron withdrawing groups the double bonds of the product avoid the substituents. The placement preference of groups in the mechanism and in the final product is termed regioselectivity.|$|E
25|$|Alkylating {{agents are}} the oldest group of {{chemotherapeutics}} in use today. Originally derived from mustard gas used in World War I, {{there are now}} many types of alkylating agents in use. They are so named because {{of their ability to}} alkylate many molecules, including proteins, RNA and DNA. This ability to bind covalently to DNA via their <b>alkyl</b> <b>group</b> is the primary cause for their anti-cancer effects. DNA is made of two strands and the molecules may either bind twice to one strand of DNA (intrastrand crosslink) or may bind once to both strands (interstrand crosslink). If the cell tries to replicate crosslinked DNA during cell division, or tries to repair it, the DNA strands can break. This leads to a form of programmed cell death called apoptosis. Alkylating agents will work at any point in the cell cycle and thus are known as cell cycle-independent drugs. For this reason the effect on the cell is dose dependent; the fraction of cells that die is directly proportional to the dose of drug.|$|E
