5|$|Based at RAF Scampton, it {{operates}} {{a fleet of}} 12 Mk 58 and three two-seaters (T.7 and T.8), {{as well as other}} aircraft to provide high speed <b>aerial</b> <b>threat</b> simulation, mission support training and trials support services.|$|E
5|$|The North Vietnamese also {{responded to}} the American <b>aerial</b> <b>threat</b> by the {{increased}} use of heavy concentrations of anti-aircraft artillery. By 1968 this was mainly composed of 37mm and 57mm radar-controlled weapons. The next year, 85mm and 100mm guns appeared, {{and by the end of}} Commando Hunt, over 1,500 guns defended the system.|$|E
5|$|Its primary {{task was}} to protect convoys from the German Kriegsmarines U-boat force. It also {{protected}} Allied shipping from the <b>aerial</b> <b>threat</b> posed by the Luftwaffe. The main operations of Coastal Command were defensive, defending supplies lines in the various theatres of war, most notably the Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres and {{the battle of the}} Atlantic. It also served in an offensive capacity. In the Mediterranean theatre and the Baltic sea it carried out attacks on German shipping moving war materials from Italy to North Africa and from Scandinavia to Germany. By 1943 Coastal Command finally received the recognition it needed and its operations proved decisive in the victory over the U-boats.|$|E
5000|$|Against <b>aerial</b> <b>threats</b> the cruisers {{were armed}} with four 57mm L/80 DP guns {{situated}} in two twin mountings. They also had four 30mm AK-630 CIWS mountings. They were armed with two twin launchers for the 48 SA-N-3 surface-to-air missiles they carried.|$|R
50|$|The Sea Viper is {{the main}} weapon of the Type 45 destroyers and {{provides}} all-round defence for an entire naval task group against all <b>aerial</b> <b>threats</b> at some 70 miles away. It races towards its target at speeds in excess of Mach Four (over 3,000 mph) using a series of tiny jets to manoeuvre, carrying out sharp turns.|$|R
50|$|An {{air defense}} variant, these {{vehicles}} are modified M2A2 ODSs with the TOW missile system {{replaced with a}} four-tube Stinger missile system. From 2005 to 2006, M6 Linebackers had their Stinger missile systems removed and were converted to standard M2 Bradley ODS infantry fighting vehicles. By 2017, the Army was exploring reintroducing air defense Bradleys with the reemergence of hostile <b>aerial</b> <b>threats.</b>|$|R
25|$|In central Norway, Royal Navy aircraft-carriers and RAF fighter squadrons {{could not}} keep the {{established}} bases secure, and the British had to evacuate them. In the north, the Germans were driven out of Narvik after they had captured it. However, as Luftwaffe aircraft came into range with the German advances, it was again found to be impossible to sustain bases {{in the face of}} <b>aerial</b> <b>threat.</b> British forces in Narvik were withdrawn as well.|$|E
500|$|Engen is {{a strong}} defender in {{one-on-one}} situations and has stated that she believes this to be her strongest asset.

500|$|São Paulo manager Paulo Autuori {{was adamant}} {{that his team}} would have to improve on their {{performance}} in the semi-final {{if they were to}} win the match: [...] "We're going to have to improve certain aspects of our play if we want to win the final." [...] Autouri was not worried about Liverpool's <b>aerial</b> <b>threat,</b> but was expecting them to keep the ball during the match: [...] "English teams are well known for their aerial excellence, But Liverpool are a side that can keep the ball very well too as they proved when winning the Champions League." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1948 France {{embarked}} {{on a number of}} programs to develop guided missile systems, the aim being {{to keep pace with the}} other Great Powers. The proliferation of high-speed threats, be they underwater, surface or <b>aerial</b> <b>threats,</b> required the development of effective defences. High-priority programs were initiated to cover all areas: anti-aircraft, anti-surface and anti-submarine. Of these programs two achieved operational status; these were: ...|$|R
50|$|As patrol vessels, {{they are}} lightly armed. They carry various sensors, {{including}} the Furuno navigation radar and sonar. Armament on board includes a 30mm CRN-91 automatic cannon {{with an electronic}} day-night fire control system of Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) and Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) origin. The vessels also mount two 12.7mm heavy machine guns (HMG) and multiple medium machine guns, besides carrying shoulder-launched Igla surface-to-air missiles to combat <b>aerial</b> <b>threats.</b>|$|R
50|$|CONR is one {{of three}} NORAD regions. NORAD is the bi-national Canadian and American command that employs a network of space-based, aerial and {{ground-based}} sensors, air-to-air refuelling tankers and fighter aircraft, controlled by a sophisticated command and control network to deter, detect and defend against <b>aerial</b> <b>threats</b> that originate outside or within North American airspace. The two other Regions consist of the Canadian NORAD Region (CANR) and the Alaskan NORAD Region (ANR).|$|R
500|$|When up front, Henry is {{occasionally}} {{known to}} move out wide to the left wing position, something which enables him to contribute heavily in assists: between 2002–03 and 2004–05, the striker managed almost 50 assists in total and this was attributed to his unselfish play and creativity. Henry would also drift offside to fool the defence then run back onside before the ball is played and beat the offside trap, although he never provided Arsenal a distinct <b>aerial</b> <b>threat.</b> Given his versatility {{in being able to}} operate as both a winger and a striker, the Frenchman is not a prototypical [...] "out-and-out striker", but he has emerged consistently as one of Europe's most prolific strikers. In set pieces, Henry was the first-choice penalty and free kick taker for Arsenal, having scored regularly from those positions.|$|E
500|$|Air {{attacks on}} Arawe dropped off after 1January. As {{a result of}} the heavy losses they {{suffered}} during attacks on Arawe and Cape Gloucester, and the damage caused by Allied raids on Rabaul, Japanese air units conducted only small-scale raids at night after this date. The IJN fighter units based at Rabaul and nearby Kavieng were also kept busy throughout January and February 1944 defending their bases from continuous Allied air attacks. Few raids were made against the Arawe area after 90mm anti-aircraft guns were established there on 1February. These weak attacks did not disrupt the Allied convoys. In the three weeks after the landing, [...] of supplies as well as 541 artillery guns and vehicles were transported to Arawe. On 20February, the Japanese air units at Rabaul and Kavieng were permanently withdrawn to Truk, ending any significant <b>aerial</b> <b>threat</b> to Allied forces in New Britain from the IJN.|$|E
2500|$|Pan American Airways, Incorporated (PAA) {{was founded}} as a shell company on March 14, 1927 by Air Corps Majors Henry H. [...] "Hap" [...] Arnold, Carl A. Spaatz, and John H. Jouett as a {{counterbalance}} to the German-owned Colombian carrier SCADTA, operating in Colombia since 1920. SCADTA lobbied hard for landing {{rights in the}} Panama Canal Zone, ostensibly to survey air routes for {{a connection to the}} United States, which the Air Corps viewed as a precursor to a possible German <b>aerial</b> <b>threat</b> to the canal. Arnold and Spaatz drew up the prospectus for Pan American when SCADTA hired a company in Delaware to obtain air mail contracts from the U.S. government. Pan American was able to obtain the U.S. mail delivery contract to Cuba, but lacked any aircraft to perform the job and did not have landing rights in Cuba.|$|E

50|$|The tests {{conducted}} in 2013 at the Denel Overberg Test Range {{were carried out}} primarily to test an extended range version of the Umkhonto Block 2 missile, but it also served {{as an opportunity to}} test the capability of the Denel Umkhonto Ground-based Launcher (GBL). This system is being developed to provide the South African Army with a short- to medium-range air defence system, able to target high-speed <b>aerial</b> <b>threats</b> as part of the army's Ground-Based Air Defence System Phase II project (GBADS II).|$|R
5000|$|Like {{many other}} {{reptiles}} the Chinese water dragon possesses a small, iridescent, photosensitive spot between their eyes {{referred to as}} the pineal eye (or parietal eye, or colloquially as the third eye) that is thought to help thermoregulate their bodies by sensing differences in light to assist with [...] and seeking shelter after sunset. Since it recognizes differences in light, the parietal eye can also help the lizard avoid predation from birds and other <b>aerial</b> <b>threats,</b> and can awaken from deep sleep from even slight changes in light from overhead. These animals are very docile and allow physical activity.|$|R

40|$|Detecting {{potential}} <b>aerial</b> <b>threats</b> like drones {{with computer}} vision {{is at the}} paramount of interest {{for the protection of}} critical locations. This type of a system should prevent efficiently the false alarms caused by non-malign objects such as birds, which intrude the image plane. In this paper, we propose an improved version of a previously presented Speeded-up Robust Feature Transform (SURF) based algorithm, referred as Ordered Minimum Distance Bag-of-Words (omidBoW) to discriminate drones, birds and background from the patches, using an extended histogram set. We show that a SURF based object recognition can be well integrated to this context and this improved algorithm can increase accuracy up to 16 % compared to regular bag-ofwords approach...|$|R
50|$|Maremma used as {{livestock}} guardian {{dogs are}} introduced to sheep flocks as puppies so they bond to the sheep. Some ranchers place Maremma puppies as young as 3-4 weeks old with young lambs though beginning this bonding process at 7-8 weeks is more typical. Although it is easiest to bond Maremma to sheep and goats, cattle ranchers {{have found that the}} dogs bond with cows and Maremma are increasingly used to protect range cattle. Some ranchers have successfully trained Maremmas to protect free-range fowl, such as chickens, from predation from both ground threats such as coyotes, stray dogs and foxes as well as <b>aerial</b> <b>threats</b> such as raptors (hawks, eagles, owls, etc.).|$|R

50|$|Due {{to their}} small size, buffy-headed {{marmosets}} {{are susceptible to}} a wide range of predators. Common threats include ocelots, anacondas, and hawks, but many other animals such as toucans prey on them. The buffy-headed marmoset has four distinct patterns of predator avoidance. Primarily, buffy-headed marmosets avoid aerial predators through low-intensity alarm signals, emitting soft, closed-mouth whistles to warn other group members. A secondary behavior in dealing with <b>aerial</b> <b>threats</b> is a high-intensity alarm. These marmosets will send out a half-mouthed, open whistle to alert other members to take cover under branches or trees, sometimes immediately ceasing movement for the purpose of avoiding exposure. This pattern of avoidance is instinctive, and at times can result in these primates leaping downward from canopy to canopy in 10m jumps.|$|R
50|$|The {{mission of}} the {{regiment}} revolves around {{the protection of the}} Guiana Space Centre (Centre Spatial Guyanais, CSG). Prior and before each space launch, under a prefectoral requisition at the corps of an inter-armed contingent, the 3rd Foreign Infantry Regiment conducts search reconnaissance patrols in the exterior zones around the launching area in order to prevent any compromising intrusion. Each planetary space launch requires the prevention deployment of 2-3 combat companies. Simultaneously, the regiment also ensures the defense of the sensitive installations in relation to the launch site towards low altitude <b>aerial</b> <b>threats</b> by the CA (Compagnie d'Appui). End of 2011, the Guiana Space Center, integrated the Soyouz and Vega launchers, to which the 3rd Foreign Infantry Regiment would ensure the usual front line surrounding protection.|$|R
40|$|A {{model for}} a phased-array radar {{in the context of}} a {{defensive}} Naval system has been developed using hierarchical finite state machines. This model is used to study resource management for a fleet of ships equipped with one radar unit each. This fleet is under attack from aerial enemy agents. A control algorithm formulated on this specific model is used to dynamically generate a greedy policy for radar operation. The defense system is evaluated in its capability to acquire and track those <b>aerial</b> <b>threats,</b> in two configurations -centralized and decentralized (independent). The performance is quantified on the basis of time taken to establish the threat trajectory, time to compute the policy and the number of threats the system fails to track. A comparison of performance in the two configurations is provided. © 2013 IEEE...|$|R
