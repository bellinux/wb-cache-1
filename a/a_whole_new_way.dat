25|$|Since 2000, {{scholarly}} {{research has}} focused on aspects of Ruskin's legacy, including his impact on the sciences; John Lubbock and Oliver Lodge admired him. Two major academic projects have looked at Ruskin and cultural tourism (investigating, for example, Ruskin's links with Thomas Cook); the other focuses on Ruskin and the theatre. The sociologist and media theorist, David Gauntlett, argues that Ruskin's notions of craft can be traced to today's online community at YouTube and throughout Web 2.0. Similarly, architectural theorist Lars Spuybroek has argued that Ruskin's understanding of the Gothic as a combination of two types of variation, rough savageness and smooth changefulness, opens up <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>new</b> <b>way</b> of thinking leading to digital and so-called parametric design.|$|E

40|$|The {{idea that}} masculinity {{has a history}} is fairly recent. This {{collection}} opens new paths in literary and theatre studies by addressing not only how literary texts represented masculinity but how different representational strategies in such texts produce masculinity. They thus offer provocative answers {{to the question of}} what it meant to be a “man” on the newly global stage. While the volume as <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> offers <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>way</b> of thinking about literary histories, the individual articles offer reflections on the relationship between gendered meanings and the sophisticated, self-conscious, representational form of language that is called literature. What is especially innovative about this collection is its success in moving beyond the obvious cultural focus of the topic to consider how literary genre also affected the way masculinity was viewed. Such an approach brings a fresh perspective on current debates about the nature, extent and contemporary meaning of male/male sexual practices in the pre-modern and early modern period...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{resistance to}} surveillance {{in everyday life}} and, in doing so, responds to gaps {{within the field of}} surveillance studies through the development of a more rigorous framework for understanding power, surveillance and resistance. This framework reflects the development of more technologically enhanced forms of surveillance and takes into account the cultural and social influences upon notions of privacy and monitoring which hinder opposition to surveillance. As opposed to earlier frameworks for understanding power and surveillance, this framework places resistance as a central focus. This is developed through engagement with the work of Henri Lefebvre and Guy Debord with a focus on their critiques of everyday life, depiction of rhythms for understanding power, the notion of the spectacle for understanding the seductive aspects of surveillance and the use of their practices of resistance as conceptual tools for developing a theoretical framework for understanding practices of resistance to surveillance in everyday life. This framework is developed through the exploration of these conceptual tools within the context of contemporary forms of surveillance and engagement with contemporary theorists whose ideas resonate with those of Henri Lefebvre and Guy Debord in their depiction of contemporary forms of monitoring, control and resistance. Three sites of surveillance are explored within this thesis through which this framework is explored and deployed. The first examines the difficulties of resistance within the urban environment. The second explores the seductive aspects of surveillance through an exploration of how surveillance is consumed and embraced, these things complicating the development of practices of resistance. The third case explores artistic engagements with surveillance practices and illustrates the framework developed through examples from these artists. These case studies demonstrate the importance of the framework developed here. The thesis as <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> suggests <b>new</b> <b>ways</b> of thinking about surveillance and resistance to surveillance...|$|R

40|$|Social phobia (SP) is {{a common}} and {{disabling}} condition for which cognitive-behavioral treatments (CBT) have demonstrated efficacy. However, there remains room for improvement. Hence, further exploration of {{the means by which}} CBT helps patients with SP is warranted. Studies examining patients' perspectives on which aspects of treatment were most or least helpful may augment other established methodologies for identifying the more or less effective components and thus help to increase the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of CBT for SP. The current study used interpretive phenomenological analysis to analyze the transcripts of interviews with eight patients who had completed cognitive therapy (CT) for SP. Four related themes were identified: (i) social phobia as a way of being; (ii) learning to challenge social phobia as a way of being: transformative mechanisms of therapy; (iii) challenges faced in the pursuit of change; (iv) <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>new</b> world: <b>new</b> <b>ways</b> of being. This analysis of patients' experiences of CT for SP confirmed that the factors hypothesized to be important in maintaining SP in cognitive-behavioral models of the disorder are evident in patients' descriptions of the processes of change in CT for SP (e. g., reducing internal focus of attention and reducing safety behaviors and avoidance). Helpful components of CT for SP were identified as areas where the protocol could be enhanced. Recommendations for the way in which CT for SP is implemented are made...|$|R
5000|$|In her 2008 book Sex, Culture, and Justice: the Limits of Free Choice, Chambers is {{concerned}} about what the state's response should be to cultural practices which individuals freely choose to partake in {{as a way of}} securing certain goods, when those practices impose disproportionate costs on vulnerable members of the community. She defends three main claims. First, individual preferences to pursue certain activities are shaped by social construction: if individuals are raised to follow certain practices which are deemed choiceworthy in their community, then they will be more disposed to follow these practices later in life. Second, if social construction brings individuals to form preferences for activities that are self-degrading or self-harmful, the individuals in question are victims of an unjust process of social construction. Third, the state is permitted to prohibit self-degrading or self-harmful activities that individuals freely choose to follow when their preference for following these activities was shaped by an unjust process of social construction; this is because preferences formed by an unjust process of social construction are morally suspect, and the state has a greater obligation to free individuals from pernicious practices that harm and degrade them than to satisfy morally suspect preferences.According to Marion Smiley, Chambers' use of the notion of an unjust process social construction [...] "to justify, as well as to limit, prohibition, provides us with <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>new</b> and productive <b>way</b> of using the state to promote gender equality," [...] and she argues that a particular virtue of Chambers' work is that it [...] "makes clear why {{we do not have to}} choose between gender equality and autonomy in our efforts to prevent harm in the lives of women and all others." ...|$|R
40|$|My {{research}} interests involve {{looking at the}} system as <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> to identify <b>new</b> <b>ways</b> that I can innovate in some combination of the compiler, operating system, and hardware, {{for the sake of}} solving important systems problems. My particular emphasis is on software performance and reliability. I believe that my broad, end-to-end view of system behavior enables me to find creative ways to match the relative strengths of one part of the system with the relative weaknesses of other parts of the system, so that the pieces come together in a complementary way and my overall solution is effective. For example, my thesis research on a decoupled approach to monitoring the behavior of device drivers at run-time and preventing them from corrupting device state has involved novel hardware [1] and compiler [2] support to reduce monitoring overhead, along with novel operating system support [4] to enable the monitoring and prevent device corruption. Through this whole-system approach, I was able to create a new capability (that was previously impractical) for protecting systems from bugs in critical software with negligible run-time overhead in most cases. Looking ahead, I believe that my strengths as a researcher in this broad set of systems areas equip me well to tackle important challenges in executing software reliably and efficiently in future systems (especially in a cloud computing environment). 1 Research to date: Making correctness checking fast and effective The error-prone nature of software development has made it necessary for end users to carefully evaluate the inherent risks of running defective software.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{experiences}} of survivors of cancer. Eight participants, who were all diagnosed with cancer and had undergone various treatments, were interviewed. These participants had all survived the prognosis and treatment for cancer and continue to live as survivors. Their stories of survival were transcribed and analysed using a phenomenological approach. Initially, the research question was aimed at the type of personal qualities these survivors have; for example, a fighting spirit, positive attitude, or internal locus of control, and whether they attributed their survival {{to a change in}} life-style or behaviour through, for example, meditation, diet, prayer, or beliefs. However, during the interview and transcribing process it became clear that, while their stories of survival were exceptional, the participants themselves did not attribute their survival to anything outstanding. They did not necessarily have exceptional personal qualities and were not highly motivated {{at the time of their}} diagnoses to change their lifestyle or way of being. None of them had remarkable reasons that they could attribute their survival to. Some attributed their survival to luck. This is consistent with the research by Killoran, Schlitz and Lewis (2002) who found that long-term survivors framed their recoveries as "being largely unremarkable". What was very apparent in all of the survivors stories was that, with survival comes <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>new</b> and different <b>way</b> of being and it poses new psychological issues that have to be faced daily, for the rest of their lives. While each participant's story was one of amazing courage, strength, hope and positiveness, it was also found that surviving cancer can and does have a dark side. Fear of recurrence is always in the forefront of the survivor's mind. Depression and mal-adaptive coping strategies occur in some survivor's lives. Changes in body image, employment, abilities, stress on relationships and ongoing health problems can render a person incapable of coping. Therefore, the research question changed from one of looking at the personalities and life styles of survivors, to that of "what is it like to live as a survivor of cancer?" As a phenomenological study, this shift in focus was significant and necessary. The interviews were analysed and data was formulated into four main clusters; "Why me?": cause, effect & making meaning & sense out of it all; "I just want life to be normal again": the issue of normality, redefining oneself and the physical legacy of surviving treatment; "I've been told that canccr will eventually get me": remission or cure? Living with uncertainty, fear of recurrence and "Keeping busy and my mind off of it helps": coping styles, control and attitude...|$|R

40|$|Voice and {{telephony}} {{services have}} been viewed as constants for over the past hundred+ years. Picking up the telephone and hearing 2 ̆ 2 dial tone 2 ̆ 2 is something we don 2 ̆ 7 t think about, a simple thing in the life that households and organizations 2 ̆ 7 {{all over the world}} take for granted. Over the past several decades, Private Branch Exchange (PBX) technology has proved its existence with great staying power. The phrase 2 ̆ 2 five 9 s 2 ̆ 2 reliability has been a subject of many conversations pertaining to voice, and as time passes on, the PBX still gams more valuable trust and respect from its 2 ̆ 7 users. It wasn 2 ̆ 7 t until approximately three to four years ago where the term 2 ̆ 2 PBX 2 ̆ 2 took on <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>whole</b> <b>way</b> of life. Traditional time-division multiplexing (TDM) technology {{was on the verge of}} being changed from one that provided digital capabilities, to one that provided full Internet Protocol (IP) integration into an existing data network. The TDM PBX was literally transformed overnight into an IP platform, causing a hundred years of technology and development to be readdressed and most likely looked upon as 2 ̆ 2 legacy 2 ̆ 2 technology moving forward. IP telephony technology is being looked at as the future of voice communications and as the integration of what used to be two separate worlds: voice and data. The overall architecture and feature parity with traditional PBX technology makes an easy selling point; however, it is the extra benefits and the overall reduction in costs that organizations 2 ̆ 7 are seeing that makes this new technology so attractive. In general, IP telephony consists of transporting voice packets over a data infrastructure that supports the quality of service and resiliency that voice telephony demands. The underlying architecture is based upon IP technology and specific signaling standards that IP telephones and applications utilize to make IP telephony possible. As a result of the discussion aforementioned, the aim and direction of this thesis is built upon technical information, specifically regarding architecture, applications, protocols and the overall underlying principles of IP telephony. It is not intended as a sales pitch, rather intended to show the many advantages of IP telephony and how it is positioned as another IP-based solution into your existing data network.
