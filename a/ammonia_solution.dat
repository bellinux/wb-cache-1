5|$|Silver fulminate, AgCNO, a powerful, touch-sensitive {{explosive}} used in percussion caps, {{is made by}} {{reaction of}} silver metal with nitric acid {{in the presence of}} ethanol. Other dangerously explosive silver compounds are silver azide, AgN3, formed by reaction of silver nitrate with sodium azide, and silver acetylide, Ag2C2, formed when silver reacts with acetylene gas in <b>ammonia</b> <b>solution.</b> In its most characteristic reaction, silver azide decomposes explosively, releasing nitrogen gas: given the photosensitivity of silver salts, this behaviour may be induced by shining a light on its crystals.|$|E

2500|$|The {{hazards of}} <b>ammonia</b> <b>{{solutions}}</b> {{depend on the}} concentration: [...] "dilute" [...] <b>ammonia</b> <b>solutions</b> are usually 5–10% by weight (<5.62nbsp&mol/L); [...] "concentrated" [...] solutions are usually prepared at >25% by weight. A 25% (by weight) solution has a density of 0.907 g/cm3, and a solution that has a lower density will be more concentrated. The European Union classification of <b>ammonia</b> <b>solutions</b> is given in the table.|$|R
25|$|<b>Ammonia</b> <b>solutions</b> {{should not}} be mixed with halogens, as toxic and/or {{explosive}} products are formed. Prolonged contact of <b>ammonia</b> <b>solutions</b> with silver, mercury or iodide salts {{can also lead to}} explosive products: such mixtures are often formed in qualitative inorganic analysis, and should be lightly acidified but not concentrated (<6% w/v) before disposal once the test is completed.|$|R
40|$|International audienceExplosion risks {{resulting}} from the industrial handling of aqueous <b>ammonia</b> <b>solutions</b> are often not {{taken into account in}} risk assessments, especially for dilute solutions, although accidental explosions implying ammonia vapors are reported in the literature. In fact, <b>ammonia</b> <b>solutions</b> do not show any flash point, but are able to form an explosive atmosphere. In this study, explosivity characteristics of several <b>ammonia</b> <b>solutions,</b> more or less diluted, were determined in a 20 -L sphere device. It appears that the explosion range of <b>ammonia</b> <b>solutions</b> depends on the temperature and on the ammonia concentration. The explosion severity is smaller than for pure ammonia {{because of the presence of}} water and it tends to decrease slightly with dilution. However, the maximal explosion pressure is still above 3 bar with the 10 % solution. Hence, such aqueous solutions, even diluted, handled in enclosed spaces can generate great disasters...|$|R
25|$|Ammonia {{can act as}} a ligand in {{transition}} metal complexes. It is a pure σ-donor, {{in the middle of the}} spectrochemical series, and shows intermediate hard-soft behaviour. For historical reasons, ammonia is named ammine in the nomenclature of coordination compounds. Some notable ammine complexes include tetraamminediaquacopper(II) (2+), a dark blue complex formed by adding ammonia to a solution of copper(II) salts. Tetraamminediaquacopper(II) hydroxide is known as Schweizer's reagent, and has the remarkable ability to dissolve cellulose. Diamminesilver(I) (+) is the active species in Tollens' reagent. Formation of this complex can also help to distinguish between precipitates of the different silver halides: silver chloride (AgCl) is soluble in dilute (2M) <b>ammonia</b> <b>solution,</b> silver bromide (AgBr) is only soluble in concentrated <b>ammonia</b> <b>solution,</b> whereas silver iodide (AgI) is insoluble in aqueous ammonia.|$|E
25|$|In this solvent, {{acetic acid}} as solute {{is a strong}} acid and ionizes completely, and has the same {{strength}} as HCl (at the same concentration. The acidities of both acetic acid and HCl are leveled to that of NH4+ which is the strongest acid that exists in liquid <b>ammonia</b> <b>solution.</b>|$|E
25|$|Another {{oxidation}} {{reaction is}} the basis of the silver mirror test. In this test, an aldehyde is treated with Tollens' reagent, which is prepared by adding a drop of sodium hydroxide solution into silver nitrate solution to give a precipitate of silver(I) oxide, and then adding just enough dilute <b>ammonia</b> <b>solution</b> to redissolve the precipitate in aqueous ammonia to produce + complex. This reagent will convert aldehydes to carboxylic acids without attacking carbon–carbon double bonds. The name silver mirror test arises because this reaction will produce a precipitate of silver, whose presence can be used to test for the presence of an aldehyde.|$|E
25|$|The {{range of}} {{thermodynamic}} stability of liquid <b>ammonia</b> <b>solutions</b> is very narrow, {{as the potential}} for oxidation to dinitrogen, E° (N2 + 6NH4+ + 6e− ⇌ 8NH3), is only +0.04nbsp&V. In practice, both oxidation to dinitrogen and reduction to dihydrogen are slow. This is particularly true of reducing solutions: the solutions of the alkali metals mentioned above are stable for several days, slowly decomposing to the metal amide and dihydrogen. Most studies involving liquid <b>ammonia</b> <b>solutions</b> are done in reducing conditions; although oxidation of liquid ammonia is usually slow, {{there is still a}} risk of explosion, particularly if transition metal ions are present as possible catalysts.|$|R

In the 1950s and 60s, in order to obtain high quality images of celestial objects in the very near infrared part of the spectrum (the I-band, 680–880nm), he used chemically hyper-sensitized standard Eastman emulsions I-N. To achieve the hyper-sensitization he immersed them in 5% <b>ammonia</b> <b>solution</b> for 3–5 minutes. This procedure increased their sensitivity by an order of magnitude. Between 1957 and 1967 Maffei observed many different objects using this technique, including globular clusters and planetary nebulae.

Moreover, a key point is that NH 4 OH solutions, after undergoing adequate processing (oxidation and acidification) allow also precise MTE measurements by using standard ICP-MS methods.

500|$|Metallic sodium is used {{mainly for}} the {{production}} of sodium borohydride, sodium azide, indigo, and triphenylphosphine. A once-common use was the making of tetraethyllead and titanium metal; because of the move away from TEL and new titanium production methods, the production of sodium declined after 1970. Sodium is also used as an alloying metal, an anti-scaling agent, and as a reducing agent for metals when other materials are ineffective. [...] Note the free element is not used as a scaling agent, ions in the water are exchanged for sodium ions. Sodium plasma ("vapor") lamps are often used for street lighting in cities, shedding light that ranges from yellow-orange to peach as the pressure increases. By itself or with potassium, sodium is a desiccant; it gives an intense blue coloration with benzophenone when the desiccate is dry. In organic synthesis, sodium is used in various reactions such as the Birch reduction, and the sodium fusion test is conducted to qualitatively analyse compounds. Sodium reacts with alcohol and gives alkoxides, and when sodium is dissolved in <b>ammonia</b> <b>solution,</b> {{it can be used to}} reduce alkynes to trans-alkenes.

2500|$|Following the {{invention}} of coal gas early in the 19th century, {{it was discovered that}} numerous organic and inorganic chemicals could be obtained when purifying the gas. Processes began to be developed to recover these, and a major branch of the British chemical industry – the coal tar and ammonia by-products industry – came into existence. By 1876 a nearby company, Burt, Boulton and Haywood of Silvertown, was distilling each year [...] of coal tar to manufacture ingredients for disinfectants, insecticides and dyes. Sulphur from the gas works was the raw material for local manufacturers of sulphuric acid needed by other nearby companies producing products such as fertilizers. Subsequently the GLCC decided that it would carry out the processing of by-products itself, rather than sell them to independent chemical companies. A purpose-built chemical works, Beckton Products Works, was constructed in 1879. It was the largest tar and ammonia by-products works in the UK, possibly in the world. Besides millions of gallons of road tar, products included phenol, the cresols and xylenols, naphthalene, pyridine bases, creosote, benzene, toluene, xylene, solvent naphtha, ammonium sulphate and <b>ammonia</b> <b>solution,</b> sulphuric acid, picolines, quinoline, quinaldine, acenaphthene, anthracene and dicyclopentadiene.
