5|$|Amid rising tensions, the {{air traffic}} {{controllers}} began staging a series of work actions, including slowdowns, walkouts, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> hunger strike. This led to chaos in Brazil's aviation industry: major delays and disruptions in domestic and international air service, stranded passengers, canceled flights, and public demonstrations. Those who blamed various civilian and military officials for the growing crisis called for their resignation.|$|E
5|$|Authors Joyce Murdoch and Deb Pryce {{say another}} {{effect of the}} case was a {{softening}} of the Court's attitude towards the gay community.

5|$|Captain Archibald Haddock (Capitaine Haddock in Hergé's {{original}} version) is a Merchant Marine sea {{captain and}} Tintin's best friend. Introduced in The Crab with the Golden Claws, Haddock is initially {{depicted as a}} weak and alcoholic character, but later evolves to become genuinely heroic <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> socialite after he finds a treasure from his ancestor, Sir Francis Haddock (Chevalier François de Hadoque in the original version). The Captain's coarse humanity and sarcasm act as a counterpoint to Tintin's often-implausible heroism; he is always quick with a dry comment whenever the boy reporter seems too idealistic. After he and Tintin find Red Rackham's treasure, Captain Haddock lives in the luxurious mansion Marlinspike Hall (Le château de Moulinsart in the original French).|$|E
5|$|De Mauro {{was kidnapped}} {{on the evening}} of September 16, 1970, while coming back home from work, in the via delle Magnolie in Palermo.

De Mauro’s body has never been found, a victim of the so-called lupara bianca, despite intensive search efforts by Palermo police assisted by top-level forces from Rome <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> special investigative committee of the Italian Parliament.|$|E
5|$|During {{development}}, Square Enix {{did not pay}} Grin {{over several}} months, and disapproved of the game's Nordic art style. Grin worked to bring the game's art style closer to the Final Fantasy series, but {{after six months of}} development was told that no funding would ever come from Square Enix, and the developer filed for bankruptcy several days later. Word of the project leaked out through art portfolios of those who worked on the project <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> tech demo surfaced. In 2011, Fortress was thought to have been in development by an undisclosed studio, but this was also suspended and the game will not be released in any form.|$|E

5|$|Mortal Kombat II {{proved to}} be an {{enormous}} commercial success <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> cultural phenomenon. WMS Industries, owner of Midway at the time, reported its 1993 sales in the quarter ending December 31 rose to $101 million from $86 million and said much of its revenue gain was related to the sale of the arcade version of MKII. By 1996, the number of arcade machines sold approached 25,000 units; at that time, arcade games that sold 5,000 units were considered strong titles (Midway printed special T-shirts to celebrate 300 machines being manufactured in one day) and an arcade cabinet cost $3,0004,000. MKII was considered an arcade game of the year, taking over from the original Mortal Kombat.|$|E
5|$|On {{the eve of}} battle, Grant's and Johnston's armies were of {{comparable}} size, but the Confederates were poorly armed with antique weapons, including shotguns, hunting rifles, pistols, flintlock muskets, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> few pikes; however, some regiments, such as the 6th and 7th Kentucky Infantry, had Enfield rifles. The troops approached the battle with very little combat experience; Braxton Bragg's men from Pensacola and Mobile were the best trained. Grant's army included 32 out of 62 infantry regiments who had combat experience at Fort Donelson. One half of his artillery batteries {{and most of his}} cavalry were also combat veterans.|$|E

5|$|She was {{acutely aware}} of the {{importance}} of promptly publishing her discoveries and thus establishing her priority. Had not Becquerel, two years earlier, presented his discovery to the Académie des Sciences the day after he made it, credit for the discovery of radioactivity, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> Nobel Prize, would instead have gone to Silvanus Thompson. Curie chose the same rapid means of publication. Her paper, giving a brief and simple account of her work, was presented for her to the Académie on 12 April 1898 by her former professor, Gabriel Lippmann. Even so, just as Thompson had been beaten by Becquerel, so Curie was beaten in the race to tell of her discovery that thorium gives off rays in the same way as uranium; two months earlier, Gerhard Carl Schmidt had published his own finding in Berlin.|$|E
5|$|Since her surrender, Power and {{her story}} {{have been the}} basis for a variety of books <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> {{television}} episode of Law & Order.

In the show, her character is called Susan Forrest and she is found after money from the robbery turns up in a private safety deposit box after a robbery. William Kunstler appears in the episode playing himself as Forrest's lawyer. The fifth season episode aired on October 19, 1994. Later her story was the basis for Dana Spiotta’s novel Eat the Document (2006).|$|E

5|$|The Beaver Mill Lumber Company {{became one}} of the largest single lumber {{operations}} in all of Pennsylvania, and four lumber boomtowns, Beaver Mills, Star Mill, Underwood Mills, and Antes, altered the landscape in the Black Moshannon area. A dam was built at the site of an old beaver dam, and the mill ponds for the lumber mills flooded the old beaver ponds. The communities featured general stores, blacksmith shops, liveries, taverns, schools, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> ten-pin bowling alley. The area helped to meet the nation's need for timber in mining operations, construction, and railroads.|$|E
5|$|The Beckwourth Trail was the {{earliest}} predecessor of SR 70, {{which was a}} spur of the California Trail. This {{was followed by the}} railroad, mostly built on the route of the trail; a dirt road was needed for construction that was later converted into part of the present state highway. Construction on the highway began in 1928, which involved the boring of three tunnels. Previously, the road was signed as U.S. Route 40 Alternate, crossing the Sierra Nevada at a lower elevation than Donner Pass on US 40, now Interstate 80 (I-80). The road was renumbered SR 70 in the 1964 state highway renumbering. Today, portions of SR 70 have been upgraded to a four-lane expressway, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> freeway in a few locations.|$|E
5|$|The C5 was {{launched}} on 10 January 1985 at Alexandra Palace in North London.

The vehicle was given a dramatic unveiling; six C5s driven by girls dressed in grey and yellow burst out of six cardboard boxes, drove around the arena, and lined up side by side. Sinclair announced the launch of a £3 million, three-month-long advertising print and television advertising campaign. The C5 would be available initially by mail order at a cost of £399 and would subsequently be sold via high-street stores.|$|E
