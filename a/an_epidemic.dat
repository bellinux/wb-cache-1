5|$|A {{graduate}} of the University of Melbourne, Fairley joined the Australian Army Medical Corps in 1915. He investigated <b>an</b> <b>epidemic</b> of meningitis that was occurring in Army camps in Australia. While with the 14th General Hospital in Cairo, he investigated schistosomiasis (then known as bilharzia) and developed tests and treatments for the disease. In the inter-war period he became renowned as an expert on tropical medicine.|$|E
5|$|His {{prolific}} output, {{mainly in}} chemical pathology, included {{research into the}} metabolism of glycogen, uric acid, and urea; studies into <b>an</b> <b>epidemic</b> of cholera in Amsterdam; the toxicity of Atropa belladonna (deadly nightshade); various pigmented substances in the blood (including porphyrins); {{the nature of the}} heart sounds; and several contributions in tropical medicine, in which he was considered an expert. He also described the blood disorder methaemoglobinaemia.|$|E
5|$|In 1481 and 1482, {{earthquakes}} {{destroyed the}} Jewish quarter, {{so that only}} 22 families remained in the city. After <b>an</b> <b>epidemic</b> of plague in 1498–1500, the Knights Hospitaller, who ruled the island at that time, expelled those of the remaining Jews who would not be baptized. In the next two decades, the Hospitallers brought to the island between 2,000 and 3,000 captured Jews who were kept as slaves to work on fortifications.|$|E

5|$|In 17th-century Germany, the {{physician}} Eberhard Gockel discovered lead-contaminated wine {{to be the}} cause of <b>an</b> <b>epidemic</b> of colic. He had noticed that monks who did not drink wine were healthy, while wine drinkers developed colic, and traced the cause to sugar of lead, made by simmering litharge with vinegar. As a result, Eberhard Ludwig, Duke of Württemberg issued an edict in 1696 banning the adulteration of wines with litharge.|$|E
5|$|After {{his service}} in the Senate, Rowan {{returned}} to Kentucky, dividing his time between Louisville and Bardstown. During <b>an</b> <b>epidemic</b> of cholera that spread through Bardstown in 1833, three of Rowan's children (William, Atkinson, and Mary Jane) died. The spouses of William and Mary Jane also died of cholera, as did Mary Jane's daughter, and Rowan's sister Elizabeth and her husband. Aid from Bishop Joseph Flaget {{and a group of}} nuns who traveled to Federal Hill during the epidemic probably spared the life of Rowan's orphaned granddaughter, Eliza Rowan Harney.|$|E
5|$|Fairley {{joined the}} Australian Army Medical Corps with {{the rank of}} captain on 1 August 1915 and was posted to Royal Melbourne Hospital as a {{resident}} medical officer. He investigated <b>an</b> <b>epidemic</b> of meningitis that was occurring in local Army camps, and his first published paper was an analysis of this disease, documenting fifty cases. In 1916, he co-authored a monograph published by the Federal government detailing 644 cases, of which 338 (52%) were fatal, this being before the invention of antibiotic drugs.|$|E
40|$|We {{employed}} {{recently developed}} statistical methods {{to explore the}} epidemic behaviour of hepatitis C subtype 1 a and subtype 3 a among injecting drug users (IDUs) in Flanders, Belgium, using new gene sequence data sampled among two geographically distinct populations of IDUs. First the extent of hepatitis C transmission across regions/countries was studied through calculation of association indices. It was shown that viral exchange had occurred between both populations in Flanders as well as across international borders. Furthermore, evidence was found suggestive of subtypes 1 a and 3 a predominantly circulating in subpopulations of Flemish IDUs, exhibiting different degrees of travelling/migration behaviour. Secondly, through coalescent-based analysis the viral epidemic history of the hepatitis C subtype 1 a and 3 <b>a</b> <b>epidemics</b> was inferred. Evidence was found for different dynamic forces driving both epidemics. Moreover, results suggested that the hepatitis C subtype 3 <b>a</b> <b>epidemic</b> has reached <b>a</b> steady state, while the hepatitis C 1 <b>a</b> <b>epidemic</b> has not, which therefore might become the predominant subtype among IDUs. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|In Atlanta, {{representatives of}} the Department of Homeland Security meet with Dr. Ellis Cheever (Laurence Fishburne) of the CDC and express fears that the disease is a bio weapon {{intended}} to cause terror over the Thanksgiving weekend. Dr. Cheever dispatches Dr. Erin Mears (Kate Winslet), <b>an</b> <b>Epidemic</b> Intelligence Service officer, to Minneapolis to begin investigating. Mears traces the outbreak back to Emhoff while negotiating with local bureaucrats initially reluctant to commit resources for a proper public health response to the virus. Dr. Mears later becomes infected and dies.|$|E
5|$|In General Sir Thomas Blamey's {{reorganisation}} of the Australian Army in April 1942, Fairley {{was appointed}} director {{of medicine at}} Allied Land Forces Headquarters (LHQ) in Melbourne. Fairley was soon facing a series of medical emergencies caused by the Kokoda Track campaign. <b>An</b> <b>epidemic</b> of bacillary dysentery was headed off by Fairley's decision to rush all available supplies of sulphaguanadine to New Guinea. On Fairley's advice every man who complained of diarrhoea was given the drug and the epidemic was brought under control in ten days.|$|E
5|$|In spring, new {{reinforcements}} {{were sent}} by the new caliph, Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz (r. 717–720), by sea from Africa and Egypt and over land through Asia Minor. The crews of the new fleets were composed mostly of Christians, who began defecting in large numbers, while the land forces were ambushed and defeated in Bithynia. As famine and <b>an</b> <b>epidemic</b> continued to plague the Arab camp, the siege was abandoned on 15 August 718. On its return, the Arab fleet suffered further casualties to storms and an eruption of the volcano of Thera.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, an unexplained {{decline in the}} alpine pika {{population}} occurred throughout the western Sayan Mountains. Although in 1977 Khlebnikov suggested {{it was due to}} <b>an</b> <b>epidemic,</b> it was difficult to ascertain if such a large territory had been affected all at once. By 1986 or 1987, a few localities that had high alpine pika population densities 16 to 17 years earlier became devoid of the species, due to its low reproductive rate and the insular nature of its habitat.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in Jakarta, <b>an</b> <b>epidemic</b> {{of the flu}} is underway. Among {{those who}} fall ill is President Sukarno, who writes to Chairman Mao Zedong to request some doctors.

5|$|Nancy Lea {{died of an}} undiagnosed set of flu-like ailments on February 7, 1864, and was entombed on {{the grounds}} of her home. Margaret died on December 3, 1867, having {{contracted}} yellow fever during <b>an</b> <b>epidemic.</b> Walter Reed would not make his discovery of the cause of yellow fever through mosquito bite until 1900; contamination through contact was the pervading fear in 1867, and prevented Margaret's remains from being interred in a public cemetery with her husband's. She was buried in the ground beside Nancy's tomb at 11 p.m. by her servant Bingley, family friend Major Eber Cave, and her two daughters Nettie and Mary Willie. No funeral service was performed.|$|E

5|$|The French {{defenders}} of the island were weakened by years of isolation caused by the British blockade. Although the available French troops numbered between 3,000 and 4,000, there was <b>an</b> <b>epidemic</b> {{on the island and}} a significant proportion of the garrison, principally formed by the 66e Régiment, were unfit for duty. Apart from the capital, the rest of the island's defences were manned by a militia formed from local inhabitants, among whom morale was low and desertion rates high. Military and food stores of all kinds were in short supply and the governor, General Jean Augustin Ernouf was unable to maintain garrisons around the island's extensive perimeter.|$|E
5|$|After the Norman Conquest in 1066, feudal {{rule was}} {{established}} in Dorset and {{the bulk of the}} land was divided between the Crown and ecclesiastical institutions. The Normans consolidated their control over the area by constructing castles at Corfe, Wareham and Dorchester {{in the early part of}} the 12th century. Over the next 200 years Dorset's population grew substantially and additional land was enclosed for farming to provide the extra food required. The wool trade, the quarrying of Purbeck Marble and the busy ports of Weymouth, Melcombe Regis, Lyme Regis and Bridport brought prosperity to the county. However, Dorset was devastated by the bubonic plague in 1348 which arrived in Melcombe Regis on a ship from Gascony. The disease, more commonly known as the Black Death, created <b>an</b> <b>epidemic</b> that spread rapidly and wiped out a third of the population of the country.|$|E
5|$|After the {{reinforcements}} {{had settled}} in, the Spanish began digging siege lines and trenches towards the confederate positions. The first attack came on 26 October when Spanish guns {{opened fire on}} the confederate defences around the Round Tower, causing considerable damage. A French force carried out a simultaneous raid of Gibraltar's harbour, burning the bomb ship. Villadarias then carried out a heavy bombardment of the San Pablo bastion using 27 guns and 16 mortars, which managed to breach it. Among the casualties were the two feuding colonels, Fox and Nugent, who were killed on successive days. At the same time, <b>an</b> <b>epidemic</b> disease broke out among the Gibraltar garrison, reducing their effective numbers to about 1,300 men.|$|E

40|$|Until the mid- 1970 s, Neisseria meningitidis {{expressing the}} {{serogroup}} A capsular polysaccharide caused numerous epidemics of meningitis and septicemia, with annual incidence rates> 100 / 100, 000 (1).

In 1997, N. meningitidis caused approximately 500, 000 cases of disease and 50, 000 deaths worldwide, half of them in Africa (5). Serogroup A meningococci are currently isolated only rarely in western Europe and the United States, and a rise in either the healthy carriage rate or the proportion of serogroup A cases would be cause for concern...|$|R

5|$|<b>An</b> <b>epidemic</b> of {{dysentery}} {{broke out}} on the Kokoda Track that threatened the entire force. Some 1,200 casualties, mostly dysentery, reached Ilolo in September. Simple hygiene procedures involving the disposal of rubbish and excrement were required, but were neglected {{in the early stages}} of the campaign. Lieutenant Colonel Edward Ford arranged for supplies of a new drug, sulphaguanidine, to be shipped from Australia. The widespread use of a scarce drug was a gamble, as it used up all the stocks in Australia, but one that paid off; it arrested the epidemic, and allowed sick men to travel, thereby saving lives. When the Australians advanced on Kokoda in October, special details constructed latrines, buried the dead, and, in extreme cases, burned villages that the Japanese had fouled beyond redemption.|$|E
5|$|Following this, the {{regiment}} undertook basic training including weapons handling, ceremonial drill, mounted and dismounted tactics and regimental manoeuvres. In late April, they marched through {{the centre of}} Sydney {{as part of a}} farewell before deploying overseas. On 11 June, after the brigade had concentrated, {{the regiment}} embarked upon the troopship SS Suevic. After four days steaming, the ship put into Adelaide, South Australia, where the regiment disembarked their horses due to concerns about death rates among horses travelling at that time of year. The men continued on their journey three days later, undertaking rifle and signals training on deck during the day. They crossed the equator in the early afternoon on 5 July; a short time later <b>an</b> <b>epidemic</b> of measles broke out.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, a purported {{new species}} of Streptococcus, named S.shiloi, was {{identified}} {{as one of the}} causes of <b>an</b> <b>epidemic</b> of meningoencephalitis (an inflammation of the brain and its surrounding membranes) affecting farmed rainbow trout and tilapia in Israel since 1986. Since S.shiloi was alpha-hemolytic, had a G+C% content of 37% and did not ferment sugar galactose, it was not classified as S.iniae, which is beta-hemolytic, has a G+C% content of 32%, and ferments galactose. In 1995, S.shiloi was found in fact to be beta-hemolytic, and after DNA-DNA hybridization techniques with the ATCC type S.iniae and recalculation of the G+C% content, was reclassified by the same group as a junior synonym of S.iniae.|$|E
