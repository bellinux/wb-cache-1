25|$|Theoretically, the {{likelihood}} of survival of an individual microorganism is never zero. To compensate for this, the overkill method is often used. Using the overkill method, sterilization is performed by sterilizing for longer than is required to kill the bioburden present on or in the item being sterilized. This provides a sterility <b>assurance</b> <b>level</b> (SAL) equal to {{the probability of a}} non-sterile unit.|$|E
2500|$|A {{widely used}} method for heat {{sterilization}} is the [...] autoclave, sometimes called a converter or steam sterilizer. Autoclaves use steam heated to 121-134°C under pressure. To achieve sterility, {{the article is}} placed in a chamber and heated by injected steam until the article reaches a time and temperature setpoint. [...] Almost all the air {{is removed from the}} chamber, because air is undesired in the moist heat sterilization process (this is one trait that differ from a typical pressure cooker used for food cooking). The article is held at the temperature setpoint {{for a period of time}} which varies depending on what bioburden is present on the article being sterilized and its resistance (D-value) to steam sterilization. A general cycle would be anywhere between 3 and 15 minutes, (depending on the generated heat) at 121°C at 100 kPa, which is sufficient to provide a sterility <b>assurance</b> <b>level</b> of 10−4 for a product with a bioburden of 106 and a D-value of 2.0 minutes. Following sterilization, liquids in a pressurized autoclave must be cooled slowly to avoid boiling over when the pressure is released. This may be achieved by gradually depressurizing the sterilization chamber and allowing liquids to evaporate under a negative pressure, while cooling the contents.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. There is an {{increasing}} demand to certify the security of systems according to the Common Criteria (CC). The CC distinguish several evaluation <b>assurance</b> <b>levels</b> (EALs), level EAL 7 being the highest and requiring the application of formal techniques. We present a method for requirements engineering and (semi-formal and formal) modeling of systems to be certified according to the higher evaluation <b>assurance</b> <b>levels</b> of the CC. The method is problem oriented, i. e. it {{is driven by the}} environment in which the system will operate and by a mission statement. We illustrate our approach by an industrial case study, namely an electronic purse card (EPC) to be implemented on a Java Smart Card. As a novelty, we treat the mutual asymmetric authentication of the card and the terminal into which the card is inserted. ...|$|R

This revision expands the design assurance concept for application at the aircraft and system level and standardizes {{on the use}} of the term development assurance. As a consequence, Functional Development <b>Assurance</b> <b>Level</b> (FDAL) is introduced for aircraft and systems concerns and the term Design <b>Assurance</b> <b>Level</b> has been renamed Item Development <b>Assurance</b> <b>Level</b> (IDAL). [...] Furthermore, the addition of definitions for Error, Failure, and Failure Condition are acknowledge as derived from AMC 25.1309.
