25|$|The {{look-ahead}} {{function is}} designed to overcome the problem of being forced to compromise between slow attack rates that produce smooth-sounding gain changes, and fast attack rates capable of catching transients. Look-ahead is a misnomer in that the future is not actually observed. Instead, the input signal is split, and one side is delayed. The non-delayed signal is used to drive the compression of the delayed signal, which then appears at the output. This way a smooth-sounding slower <b>attack</b> <b>rate</b> {{can be used to}} catch transients. The cost of this solution is that the signal is delayed.|$|E
25|$|Case-control {{studies are}} usually {{faster and more}} cost {{effective}} than cohort studies, but are sensitive to bias (such as recall bias and selection bias). The main challenge is to identify the appropriate control group; the distribution of exposure among the control group should {{be representative of the}} distribution in the population that gave rise to the cases. This can be achieved by drawing a random sample from the original population at risk. This has as a consequence that the control group can contain people with the disease under study when the disease has a high <b>attack</b> <b>rate</b> in a population.|$|E
40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} whether changes in <b>attack</b> <b>rates</b> of fecal-orally transmitted diseases among travelers {{are related to}} changes in pretravel vaccination practices or better hygienic standards at travel destination. Methods. National surveillance data on all laboratory-confirmed cases of travel-related hepatitis A, shigellosis, and typhoid fever diagnosed in the Netherlands from 1995 to 2006 were matched {{with the number of}} Dutch travelers to developing countries to calculate region-specific annual <b>attack</b> <b>rates.</b> Trends in <b>attack</b> <b>rates</b> of non-vaccine-preventable shigellosis were compared with those of vaccine-preventable hepatitis A and typhoid fever. Trends were also compared with three markers for hygienic standards of the local population at travel destinations, drawn from the United Nations Development Programme database: the human development index, the sanitation index, and the water source index. Results. <b>Attack</b> <b>rates</b> among Dutch travelers to developing regions declined for hepatitis A, shigellosis, and typhoid fever. Region-specific trends in <b>attack</b> <b>rates</b> of shigellosis resembled trends of hepatitis A and typhoid fever. Declining <b>attack</b> <b>rates</b> of the three fecal-orally transmitted diseases correlated with improvements in socioeconomic, sanitary, and water supply conditions of the local population at travel destination.

25|$|Vomiting, in particular, transmits {{infection}} effectively, {{and appears}} to allow airborne transmission. In one incident, a person who vomited spread infection right across a restaurant, suggesting that many unexplained cases of food poisoning may have their source in vomit. In December 1998, 126 people were dining at six tables; one woman vomited onto the floor. Staff quickly cleaned up, and people continued eating. Three days later others started falling ill; 52 people reported a range of symptoms, from fever and nausea to vomiting and diarrhea. The cause was not immediately identified. Researchers plotted the seating arrangement: more than 90% {{of the people at}} the same table as the sick woman later reported becoming ill.

To date, there are minimal published data on seasonal variations in rates of stroke and subsequent case fatality in the Southern Hemisphere. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine stroke seasonality through the use of data from a hospital-based stroke register in the Hunter Region of New South Wales, Australia. Methods: From July 1, 1995, to June 30, 2000, 3803 stroke events were registered in residents of the Hunter Region, New South Wales, Australia. We analyzed the trend of seasonal and monthly stroke <b>attack</b> <b>rates</b> and case-fatality rates using Poisson regressions with age and sex as covariates.

Williams and W.D. Hamilton proposed that group living evolved because it provides benefits to the individual rather than to the group as a whole, which becomes more conspicuous as it becomes larger. One common example is the shoaling of fish. Experiments provide direct evidence for the decrease in individual <b>attack</b> <b>rate</b> seen with group living, for example in Camargue horses in Southern France. The horse-fly often attacks these horses, sucking blood and carrying diseases. When the flies are most numerous, the horses gather in large groups, and individuals are indeed attacked less frequently. Water striders are insects that live on the surface of fresh water, and are attacked from beneath by predatory fish. Experiments varying the group size of the water striders showed that the <b>attack</b> <b>rate</b> per individual water strider decreases as group size increases.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Understanding {{transmission}} {{dynamics of}} the pandemic influenza A (H 1 N 1) virus in various exposure settings and determining whether transmissibility differed from seasonal influenza viruses was a priority for decision making on mitigation strategies {{at the beginning of}} the pandemic. The objective of this study was to estimate household secondary <b>attack</b> <b>rates</b> for pandemic influenza in a susceptible population where control measures had yet to be implemented. Methods All Ontario local health units were invited to participate; seven health units volunteered. For all laboratory-confirmed cases reported between April 24 and June 18, 2009, participating health units performed contact tracing to detect secondary cases among household contacts. In total, 87 cases and 266 household contacts were included in this study. Secondary cases were defined as any household member with new onset of acute respiratory illness (fever or two or more respiratory symptoms) or influenza-like illness (fever plus one additional respiratory symptom). <b>Attack</b> <b>rates</b> were estimated using both case definitions. Results Secondary <b>attack</b> <b>rates</b> were estimated at 10. 3 % (95 % CI 6. 8 - 14. 7) for secondary cases with influenza-like illness and 20. 2 % (95 % CI 15. 4 - 25. 6) for secondary cases with acute respiratory illness. For both case definitions, <b>attack</b> <b>rates</b> were significantly higher in children under 16 years than adults (25. 4 % and 42. 4 % compared to 7. 6 % and 17. 2 %). The median time between symptom onset in the primary case and the secondary case was estimated at 3. 0 days. Conclusions Secondary <b>attack</b> <b>rates</b> for pandemic influenza A (H 1 N 1) were comparable to seasonal influenza estimates suggesting similarities in transmission. High secondary <b>attack</b> <b>rates</b> in children provide additional support for increased susceptibility to infection. </p...|$|R

40|$|Development of {{strategies}} for mitigating {{the severity of}} a new influenza pandemic is now a top global public health priority. Influenza prevention and containment strategies can be considered under the broad categories of antiviral, vaccine and non-pharmaceutical (case isolation, household quarantine, school or workplace closure, restrictions on travel) measures. Mathematical models are powerful tools for exploring this complex landscape of intervention strategies and quantifying the potential {{costs and benefits of}} different options. Here we use a large-scale epidemic simulation to examine intervention options should initial containment of a novel influenza outbreak fail, using Great Britain and the United States as examples. We find that border restrictions and/or internal travel restrictions are unlikely to delay spread by more than 2 - 3 weeks unless more than 99 % effective. School closure during the peak of a pandemic can reduce peak <b>attack</b> <b>rates</b> by up to 40 %, but has little impact on overall <b>attack</b> <b>rates,</b> whereas case isolation or household quarantine could have a significant impact, if feasible. Treatment of clinical cases can reduce transmission, but only if antivirals are given within a day of symptoms starting. Given enough drugs for 50 % of the population, household-based prophylaxis coupled with reactive school closure could reduce clinical <b>attack</b> <b>rates</b> by 40 - 50 %. More widespread prophylaxis would be even more logistically challenging but might reduce <b>attack</b> <b>rates</b> by over 75 %. Vaccine stockpiled in advance of a pandemic could significantly reduce <b>attack</b> <b>rates</b> even if of low efficacy.
