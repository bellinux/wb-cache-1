25|$|Ephaptic {{transmission}} is when two nerves {{communicate with each}} other via an artificial synapse between nerves. Healthy peripheral nerves are insulated with a myelin sheath that helps to both enhance electric transmission and to prevent cross-talk between parallel nerves. After a lesion, it has been observed that regenerating nerves might not be myelinated effectively. Consequently, the two nerve fibers can come into contact and provide a means for <b>an</b> <b>impulse</b> <b>to</b> be directly conducted through the nerve membrane. An analogy for this is having two uninsulated electrical wires placed adjacent to each other. Thus, the two nerves are able to “cross-talk” and send action potentials in both directions.|$|E
500|$|Nagy {{said it was}} {{important}} that the screenplay remained authentic to the early 1950s. [...] "There was a different protocol then, a different etiquette, a different way people related to each other physically", she said. [...] "It does you no service to spoon-feed a contemporary audience their own emotional codes and value systems." [...] While various directors and investors had input in the script throughout the long gestation period, Nagy rejected recurrent suggestions that Carol or Therese [...] "should feel guilty about being gay and suffer some kind of breakdown scene about it." [...] "What I knew going in to the adaptation", Nagy said, [...] "was that Pat's lack of psychologizing about Carol and Therese's sexual attraction and ultimately their love, had to be maintained. It could not be corrupted by <b>an</b> <b>impulse</b> <b>to</b> indulge in any number of dramatic narrative cliches about guilt concerning one's sexuality or the like." ...|$|E
500|$|After marrying Mary Chappel on January 31, 1828, {{they moved}} to Middleburg Township in Cuyahoga County, Ohio in April of that year. It was there that Baldwin joined forces with James Gilbrith, a disciple of Josiah Holbrook who wanted to found a lyceum village. In the village, {{which was founded in}} 1837 and {{situated}} just north of his farm, Baldwin ran the Lyceum Village School for five years until June 1842, when it went bankrupt. However, one day while walking home, he had <b>an</b> <b>impulse</b> <b>to</b> take a new route across the river on his farm. He noticed a grouping of exposed rocks, which would make superior grindstones. This {{was the beginning of the}} Berea grindstone industry. Baldwin shipped his grindstones to Cleveland by ox carts. After the Big Four Railroad was built from Cleveland to Cincinnati, Baldwin built a railroad which would connect his quarries to the Big Four Depot. It was then that Baldwin and the others of the Lyceum Village tried to think of a name for their new town. After Gilbrith proposed Tabor, John Baldwin suggested Berea, citing [...] After a coin flip, Berea was chosen.|$|E
50|$|During {{the nineteenth}} century and early twentieth century, {{monomania}} appears in treatises on criminal law: Monomania is a state of madness, or derangement of the mind, with respect to one subject only. Homicidal mania is <b>an</b> insane <b>impulse</b> <b>to</b> kill; pyromania is <b>an</b> insane <b>impulse</b> <b>to</b> burn buildings; and kleptomania is <b>an</b> insane <b>impulse</b> <b>to</b> steal. <b>A</b> person, therefore, may be insane and irresponsible as to one subject {{and at the same time}} sane and responsible to others. He may be punished unless impelled to crime by his monomania. But many courts hold that monomania causing <b>an</b> irresistible <b>impulse</b> <b>to</b> crime is no defense when the offender knew the act was wrong. Thomas Welburn Hughes The aberrations of pyromania and kleptomania still are recognized as impulse control disorders or conduct disorders, and the notion of irresistible <b>impulse</b> still plays <b>a</b> legal role in the insanity defense.|$|R

500|$|Jake Coyle of the Associated Press {{was more}} {{critical}} of the film, calling it [...] "terribly overstuffed {{and many of the}} jokes get drowned out by the special effects... The pervasive movie references detract from the stab at freshness, and Guardians depends all too much on the whimsy of '70s anthems for an original beat." [...] He also felt that Close, Reilly and del Toro were underused in the film. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said, [...] "In place of wit, Guardians offers a sort of generalized willingness to be amusing, an atmosphere of high spirits that feels like lots of people pumping air into a tire that has a hole in it. Everyone is clearly working, but nothing is really happening–and yet the effort is so evident that there's <b>an</b> <b>impulse</b> <b>to</b> reward it." [...] Kyle Smith of the New York Post also had a negative response to the film, comparing it to Howard the Duck and Green Lantern, and criticizing the dialogue, villains, soundtrack, lack of suspense, and the characters of Quill, Rocket, and Drax. The film received mixed reviews in China, where viewers complained that the film's [...] "poor subtitle translation not only spoiled the fun of watching it, but also made it difficult to understand its humor." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Protestant Reformation {{came about}} through <b>an</b> <b>impulse</b> <b>to</b> repair the Church {{and return it}} to what the reformers saw as its {{original}} biblical structure, belief, and practice, and was motivated by a sense that [...] "the medieval church had allowed its traditions to clutter the way to God with fees and human regulations and thus to subvert the gospel of Christ." [...] At the heart of the Reformation was an emphasis on the principle of [...] "scripture alone" [...] (sola scriptura). [...] As a result, the authority of church tradition, which had taken practical precedence over scripture, was rejected.|$|E
2500|$|German philosopher Max Scheler distinguishes {{two ways}} in which the strong can help the weak.

Another way is merely [...] "one of the many modern substitutes for love, ... nothing but the urge to turn away from oneself and to lose oneself in other people’s business." [...] At its worst, Scheler says, [...] "love for the small, the poor, the weak, and the oppressed is really disguised hatred, repressed envy, <b>an</b> <b>impulse</b> <b>to</b> detract, etc., directed against the opposite phenomena: wealth, strength, power, largesse." ...|$|E

2500|$|Two notable books {{addressed}} {{the relations between}} contemporary Judaism and Christianity, Abba Hillel Silver's Where Judaism Differs and Leo Baeck's Judaism and Christianity, both motivated by <b>an</b> <b>impulse</b> <b>to</b> clarify Judaism's distinctiveness [...] "in {{a world where the}} term Judeo-Christian had obscured critical differences between the two faiths." [...] Reacting against the blurring of theological distinctions, Rabbi Eliezer Berkovits wrote that [...] "Judaism is Judaism because it rejects Christianity, and Christianity is Christianity because it rejects Judaism." [...] Theologian and author Arthur A. Cohen, in The Myth of the Judeo-Christian Tradition, questioned the theological validity of the Judeo-Christian concept and suggested that it was essentially an invention of American politics, while Jacob Neusner, in Jews and Christians: The Myth of a Common Tradition, writes, [...] "The two faiths stand for different people talking about different things to different people." ...|$|E
2500|$|His notion {{was that}} Western society has become [...] "sick" [...] and is {{undergoing}} a [...] "healing process", {{in the same way}} that the human body begins to produce antibodies when it feels itself to be sick, humanity as a collective whole (in the Jungian, sense) was creating [...] "strategies for overcoming the condition of dis-ease" [...] and trying to cure itself, by what he termed as [...] "a reversion to archaic values." [...] McKenna pointed to phenomena including surrealism, abstract expressionism, body piercing and tattooing, psychedelic drug use, sexual permissiveness, jazz, experimental dance, rave culture, rock and roll and catastrophe theory, amongst others, as his evidence that this process was underway. This idea is linked to McKenna's [...] "stoned ape" [...] theory of human evolution, with him viewing the [...] "archaic revival" [...] as <b>an</b> <b>impulse</b> <b>to</b> return to the symbiotic and blissful relationship he believed humanity once had with the psilocybin mushroom.|$|E
2500|$|Scope - A {{practical}} {{issue is}} whether {{the fact that an}} accused is labouring under a [...] "mental disability" [...] should be a necessary but not sufficient condition for negating responsibility i.e. whether the test should also require an incapacity to understand what is being done, to know that what one is doing is wrong, or to control <b>an</b> <b>impulse</b> <b>to</b> do something and so demonstrate a causal link between the disability and the potentially criminal acts and omissions. For example, the Irish insanity defence comprises the M'Naghten Rules and a control test that asks whether the accused was debarred from refraining from committing the act because of a defect of reason due to mental illness (see Doyle v Wicklow County Council 1974) 55 IR 71. The Butler Committee recommended that proof of severe mental disorder should be sufficient to negate responsibility, in effect creating an irrebuttable presumption of irresponsibility arising from proof of a severe mental disorder. This has been criticized as it assumes a lack of criminal responsibility simply because there is evidence of some sort of mental dysfunction, rather than establishing a standard of criminal responsibility. According to this view, the law should be geared to culpability not mere psychiatric diagnosis.|$|E

The Crida organised a series of protests that culminated in a massive demonstration in the Camp Nou on 24 June 1981. Beginning as a cultural organisation, the Crida soon began to demand independence. In 1982, at a time of political uncertainty in Spain, the [...] (LOAPA) was introduced in the Spanish parliament, supposedly to [...] "harmonise" [...] the autonomy process, but in reality to curb the power of Catalonia and the Basque region. There was a surge of popular protest against it. The Crida and others organised a huge rally against LOAPA in Barcelona on 14 March 1982. In March 1983, it was held to be ultra vires by the Spanish Constitutional Court. During the 1980s, the Crida was involved in nonviolent direct action, among other things campaigning for labelling in Catalan only, and targeting big companies.

2500|$|Since gaining {{its first}} chapter in 1874, Minnesota administrators have {{maintained}} an open, {{if not always}} supportive relationship with its chapters [...] <b>An</b> <b>impulse</b> <b>to</b> exert administrative management on these highly visible registered student organizations has at times been offset by interest in limiting liability exposure where it could be claimed that the administration was responsible but did not do enough to prevent an unsafe or illegal occurrence. Minnesota's Greek System has, on balance, avoided the frequency of harmful events, as have occurred at other large schools; this primarily {{as the result of}} self-policing. The original, more active relationship between the Greeks and the Administration had been marginalized somewhat after the turbulent late 1960s and during the lassaiz-faire commuter-student years of 1970–90. This coincided with national scrutiny and bad publicity over hazing events elsewhere in the US. With the return to a more residential campus, both the Minnesota Greek System and its relationship with the University are thriving: An estimated 2,800 Greeks on campus participate in 58 separate undergraduate Academic and Social chapters. In addition, Professional and honor societies, many accepting undergraduates, number more than 80. Because of this and other factors, the University is again improving its relationship with the Greek Community: [...] "In March 2012, President Kaler announced the formation of a Greek Community Strategic Task Force (GCSTF) and issued a Charge to the GCSTF Steering Committee which emphasized the need to develop a “sustainable and robust relationship between the University and the Greek community.” ...|$|E
