Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr., but being {{concerned}} with something as minor as keeping the Buffalo Bills from winning the Super Bowl. Chris Carter said [...] "I had to speak with Bill several times; I spent hours with him on the telephone talking about the character, because the actor felt that the episode really made the character something that it wasn't. I tried to explain to him, as I think Jim and Glen were trying to express, that even if your mission in life is a destroyer, that you still have some hope {{in the back of your}} mind that you can be a creator— and that this all of a sudden, this vanity, is his vanity. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> so clearly here and it makes him sort of a silly person".|$|E

2500|$|Laurent Cleenewerck {{suggests}} that the East-West schism could even be argued to have started with Victor's attempt to excommunicate the Asian churches. Despite Victor's failure {{to carry out his}} intent to excommunicate the Asian churches, many Catholic theologians point to this episode as evidence of papal primacy and authority in the early Church, citing the fact that none of the bishops challenged his right to excommunicate but rather questioned the wisdom and charity of doing so. From the Orthodox perspective, Victor had to relent in the end <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the Eastern Churches never grant him presidency over anything other than his own church, his own synod. [...] Cleenewerck points out that Eusebius of Caesarea simply refers to Victor as one of the [...] "rulers of the Churches", not the ruler of a yet unknown or unformed [...] "universal Church". As the date of observance of the Resurrection of Christ as being {{on the day of the}} week Sunday rather than the 14th day of the month was not resolved by Papal authority it was only finally resolved by an Ecumenical Council.|$|E

6000|$|For well {{it is with}} us--as St Augustine says--when God {{takes away}} from us our own spirit, the spirit of pride and self-will and self-righteousness; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> we are but dust and ashes; worse than the animals, in that we have sinned, and they have not. Confess--he says--thy {{weakness}} and thy dust: and then listen to what follows:--Thou shalt take away from them their own spirit; but Thou shalt send forth Thy Spirit on them, and they shall be made and created anew. As the Apostle says, [...] "We are God's own workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works." [...] And so--he says--God will indeed renew {{the face of the}} earth with converted and renewed men, who confess that they are not righteous in themselves, but made righteous by the grace of the Spirit of God; and so the Lord shall rejoice in His works; you will be indeed His work, and He will rejoice in you.|$|E
60|$|By another obvious {{application}} of the same reasoning, it will be seen, {{that there is a}} real foundation for the notion, that a country may be benefited by receiving from another country the concession {{of what used to be}} termed commercial advantages, or by restraining its colonies from purchasing goods of any country except itself. In the figured illustration last used (p. 34) [not available, M.D.], it is evident, that if England had been bound by a treaty with Germany to buy linen exclusively from her, Germany would have retained the trade which we supposed her to lose, and would have continued to purchase cloth at a comparatively cheap rate from England, instead of producing it by a more costly process at home. Suppose that England had been a colony of Germany, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> by compelling colonies to deal at her shop, she may obtain a real advantage, though of a nature which we may hazard the assertion that the founders of our colonial policy little dreamt of.|$|E

6000|$|Natural {{selection}} tends only to {{make each}} organic being as perfect as, or slightly more perfect than, the other inhabitants of the same country with which it has to struggle for existence. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> this is the degree of perfection attained under nature. The endemic productions of New Zealand, for instance, are perfect one compared with another; but they are now rapidly yielding before the advancing legions of plants {202} and animals introduced from Europe. Natural selection will not produce absolute perfection, nor do we always meet, {{as far as we}} can judge, with this high standard under nature. The correction for the aberration of light is said, on high authority, not to be perfect even in that most perfect organ, the eye. If our reason leads us to admire with enthusiasm a multitude of inimitable contrivances in nature, this same reason tells us, though we may easily err on both sides, that some other contrivances are less perfect. Can we consider the sting of the wasp or of the bee as perfect, which, when used against many attacking animals, cannot be withdrawn, owing to the backward serratures, and so inevitably causes the death of the insect by tearing out its viscera? ...|$|E
6000|$|Romance is a {{language}} in which many persons learn to speak with a certain appearance of fluency; but there are few who can ever bend it to any practical need, few who can ever be said to express themselves in it. It has become abundantly plain in the foregoing examination that Victor Hugo occupies a high place among those few. He has always a perfect command over his stories; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> they are constructed with a high regard to some ulterior purpose, and that every situation is informed with moral significance and grandeur. Of no other man can the same thing be said in the same degree. His romances {{are not to be}} confused with [...] "the novel with a purpose" [...] as familiar to the English reader: this is generally the model of incompetence; and we see the moral clumsily forced into every hole and corner of the story, or thrown externally over it like a carpet over a railing. Now the moral significance, with Hugo, is of the essence of the romance; it is the organising principle. If you could somehow despoil [...] "Les Misérables" [...] or [...] "Les Travailleurs" [...] of their distinctive lesson, you would find that the story had lost its interest and the book was dead.|$|E
60|$|There are {{degrees in}} idealism. We learn first {{to play with}} it academically, as the magnet was once a toy. Then {{we see in the}} heyday of youth and poetry that it may be true, that it is true in gleams and fragments. Then its countenance waxes stern and grand, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> it must be true. It now shows itself ethical and practical. We learn that God is; that he is in me; and that all things are shadows of him. The idealism of Berkeley is only a crude {{statement}} of the idealism of Jesus, and that again is a crude statement of the fact that all nature is the rapid efflux of goodness executing and organizing itself. Much more obviously is history and the state of the world at any one time directly dependent on the intellectual classification then existing in the minds of men. The things which are dear to men at this hour are so on account of the ideas which have emerged on their mental horizon, and which cause the present order of things, as a tree bears its apples. A new degree of culture would instantly revolutionize the entire system of human pursuits.|$|E

60|$|In birds {{also the}} {{similarities}} {{to our own}} familiar songsters first strike us, though the differences are perhaps really greater than in the quadrupeds. We see thrushes and wrens, tits and finches, and what seem to be warblers and flycatchers and starlings in abundance; but a closer examination shows the ornithologist that what he took for the {50} latter are really quite distinct, {{and that there is}} not a single true flycatcher of the family Muscicapidæ, or a single starling of the family Sturnidæ in the whole continent, while there are very few true warblers (Sylviidæ), their place being taken by the quite distinct families Mniotiltidæ or wood-warblers, and Vireonidæ or greenlets. In like manner the flycatchers of America belong to the totally distinct family of tyrant-birds, Tyrannidæ, and those that look like starlings to the hang-nests, Icteridæ; and these four peculiar families comprise about a hundred and twenty species, and give a special character to the ornithology of the country. Add to these such peculiar birds as the mocking thrushes (Mimus), the blue jays (Cyanocitta), the tanagers, the peculiar genera of cuckoos (Coccygus and Crotophaga), the humming-birds, the wild turkeys (Meleagris), and the turkey-buzzards (Cathartes), <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> if there is any doubt as to the mammals of North America being sufficiently distinct to justify the creation of a separate region, the evidence of the birds would alone settle the question.|$|E
60|$|Elizabeth, no less {{moving and}} attractive, is also {{depicted}} with masterly skill. If she returns {{the passion of}} her amiable and once betrothed lover, we but guess at the fact; for so horrible a thought has never once been whispered to her own gentle and spotless mind. Yet her heart bleeds for Carlos; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> did not the most sacred feelings of humanity forbid her, there is no sacrifice she would not make to restore his peace of mind. By her soothing influence she strives to calm the agony of his spirit; by her mild winning eloquence she would persuade him that for Don Carlos other objects must remain, when his hopes of personal felicity have been cut off; she would change his love for her into love {{for the millions of}} human beings whose destiny depends on his. A meek vestal, yet with the prudence of a queen, and the courage of a matron, with every graceful and generous quality of womanhood harmoniously blended in her nature, she lives in a scene that is foreign to her; the happiness she should have had is beside her, the misery she must endure is around her; yet she utters no regret, gives way to no complaint, but seeks to draw from duty itself a compensation for the cureless evil which duty has inflicted. Many tragic queens are more imposing and majestic than this Elizabeth of Schiller; but there is none who rules over us with a sway so soft and feminine, none whom we feel so much disposed to love as well as reverence.|$|E
6000|$|Thus {{it often}} is with us, we take a course, and we keep to it, {{as if we were}} infallible, and we allow nothing to alter our convictions.

Death steps in: and now, when the past is irrevocable, the scales that have so long darkened our eyes, fall at once to the ground, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> we were wrong after all. How much cruel conduct, how many harsh words, how many little unkindnesses do we wish unspoken and undone when we look upon a dead face we have loved, or stand by the side of a new-made grave! how we wish--how we wish that we could but have the time over again! Perhaps in past times we were quite content with our own conduct; we had no doubts in our mind but that we always did what was right and kind, and that we were in every way doing our duty. But now in what a different light do right and duty appear! how we regret that we ever caused tears to flow from those dear eyes, now never to open again! why could we not have made those small concessions which would have cost us so little, why were we so hard upon that trifling fault, why so impatient with that little failing? Ah me! ah me! if we could but live our lives over again, how different, oh, how different it should be! And yet while we say this, we do not think that there are others yet alive upon whose faults we are just as hard, with whose failings we bear just as little, and that these, too, may some day go down into the quiet grave, and that we may again have to stand beside and cry [...] "peccavi." ...|$|E
