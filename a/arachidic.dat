25|$|The lipids {{found in}} green coffee include: {{linoleic}} acid, palmitic acid, oleic acid, stearic acid, <b>arachidic</b> acid, diterpenes, triglycerides, unsaturated long-chain fatty acids, esters, and amides. The total content of lipids in dried green coffee is between 11.7 and 14 g/100 g. Lipids are {{present on the}} surface and in the interior matrix of green coffee beans. On the surface, they include derivatives of carboxylic acid-5-hydroxytryptamides with an amide bond to fatty acids (unsaturated C6 to C24) making up to 3% of total lipid content or 1200 to 1400 microgram/g dried green coffee bean. Such compounds form a wax-like cover {{on the surface of the}} coffee bean (200 to 300mg lipids/100g dried green coffee bean) protecting the interior matrix against oxidation and insects. Further, such molecules have antioxidative activity due to their chemical structure. Lipids of the interior tissue are triglycerides, linoleic acid (46% of total free lipids), palmitic acid (30% to 35% of total free lipids), and esters. Arabica beans have a higher content of lipids (13.5 to 17.4g lipids/100g dried green coffee beans) than robustas (9.8 to 10.7g lipids/100g dried green coffee beans). The content of diterpenes is about 20% of the lipid fraction. The diterpenes found in green coffee include cafestol, kahweol and 16-O-methylcafestol. Some of these diterpenes have been shown in in vitro experiments to protect liver tissue against chemical oxidation. In coffee oil from green coffee beans the diterpenes are esterified with saturated long chain fatty acids.|$|E

50|$|The {{manufacturing}} process {{does not produce}} chemically pure lactylates (e.g. stearoyl-2-lactylate) for two reasons. First, the source fatty acid is not chemically pure since it is typically derived from natural sources. The source fatty acid may contain varying ratios of different fatty acids (e.g. lauric acid (C12:0), myristic acid (C14:0), palmitic acid (C16:0), stearic acid (C18:0), <b>arachidic</b> acid (C20:0), behenic acid (C22:0), etc.). Second, lactic acid readily undergoes self-esterification producing a variety of polylactyls (typically numbering from one to three lactyl groups).|$|E
50|$|It {{is often}} used in Chinese, South Asian and Southeast Asian cuisine, both for general cooking, {{and in the case}} of roasted oil, for added flavor. Peanut oil has a high smoke point {{relative}} to many other cooking oils, so is commonly used for frying foods. Its major component fatty acids are oleic acid (46.8% as olein), linoleic acid (33.4% as linolein), and palmitic acid (10.0% as palmitin). The oil also contains some stearic acid, <b>arachidic</b> acid, behenic acid, lignoceric acid and other fatty acids.|$|E

Kusum oil is unusual, with just 37% of common glycerol esters. The oil also contains Linoleic acid (43-50%), Palmitic acid (5-8%), and hydrocyanic acid, which is poisonous and must also be removed prior to consumption. The oil is yellowish brown, semi-solid, with the faint odour of bitter almond. When allowed to settle, a light coloured solid fat separates. Kusum oil contains a cyanogenic compound in concentration of 0.03-0.05% as HCN. But {{the exact location of}} the cyanogenic compound in the oil or its nature has not been reported.|$|E
50|$|Incidence of Insulin {{resistance}} is lowered with diets higher in monounsaturated fats (especially oleic acid), while {{the opposite is}} true for diets high in polyunsaturated fats (especially large amounts of arachidonic acid) as well as saturated fats (such as <b>arachidic</b> acid). These ratios can be indexed in the phospholipids of human skeletal muscle and in other tissues as well. This relationship between dietary fats and insulin {{resistance is}} presumed secondary to the relationship between insulin resistance and inflammation, which is partially modulated by dietary fat ratios (Omega-3/6/9) with both omega 3 and 9 thought to be anti-inflammatory, and omega 6 pro-inflammatory (as well as by numerous other dietary components, particularly polyphenols and exercise, with both of these anti-inflammatory). Although both pro- and anti-inflammatory types of fat are biologically necessary, fat dietary ratios in most US diets are skewed towards Omega 6, with subsequent disinhibition of inflammation and potentiation of insulin resistance. But this is contrary to the suggestion of more recent studies, in which polyunsaturated fats are shown as protective against insulin resistance.|$|E
5000|$|The aril is {{attached}} to the seed in some commercial cultivars, but [...] "freestone" [...] cultivars are available and in high demand. Usually, a single light brown seed is found, which is high in certain fats and oils (primarily oleic acid and <b>arachidic</b> acid) valuable to industry, and used in cooking and the manufacture of soap. Rambutan roots, bark, and leaves have various uses in traditional medicine and in the production of dyes.In some areas, rambutan trees can bear fruit twice annually, once in late fall and early winter, with a shorter season in late spring and early summer. Other areas, such as Costa Rica, have a single fruit season, with the start of the rainy season in April stimulating flowering, and the fruit is usually ripe in August and September. The fragile fruit must ripen on the tree, then they are harvested over a four- to seven-week period. The fresh fruit are easily bruised and have a limited shelf life. An average tree may produce 5,000-6,000 or more fruit (60-70 kg or 130-155 lb per tree). Yields begin at 1.2 tonnes per hectare (0.5 tons/acre) in young orchards and may reach 20 tonnes per hectare (8 tons per acre) on mature trees. In Hawaii, 24 of 38 cultivated hectares (60 of 95 acres) were harvested producing 120 tonnes of fruit in 1997. Yields could be increased by improved orchard management, including pollination, and by planting high-yielding compact cultivars.|$|E

40|$|X-Ray {{diffraction}} {{was used}} to characterize the profile structures of ultrathin lipid multilayers having a bound surface layer of cytochrome c. The lipid multilayers were formed on an alkylated glass surface, using the Langmuir-Blodgett method. The ultrathin lipid multilayers of this study were: five monolayers of <b>arachidic</b> acid, four monolayers of <b>arachidic</b> acid with a surface monolayer of dimyristoyl phosphatidylserine, and four monolayers of <b>arachidic</b> acid acid with a surface monolayer of thioethyl stearate. Both the phosphatidylserine and the thioethyl stearate surfaces were found previously to covalently bind yeast cytochrome c, while the <b>arachidic</b> acid surface electrostatically binds yeast cytochrome c.

Well-defined circular islands and holes were observed which disappeared with the increase in pH. Polarized absorption studies indicated that the dye molecules are oriented uniaxially with their long axis titled at a constant angle to the surface normal of the LB film. Within the restricted geometry of the LB film, the PS dye was electropolymerized to form a two-dimensional film of poly(phenosafranine) sandwiched between <b>arachidic</b> acid layers.

The polymer film showed highly anisotropic electrical conductivity of ca. 10 orders of magnitude. This indicates the formation of two-dimensional polyPS layers between <b>arachidic</b> acid layers resulting in a layered heterostructure film having alternate conducting and insulating regions.
