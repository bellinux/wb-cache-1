5|$|Although the {{tradition}} {{declined in the}} early to mid-twentieth century, in part due to opposition from some local Christian clergy and changing social conditions, it was revived in new forms in the mid-to-latter part of the century. The tradition has also inspired various artistic depictions, appearing, for instance, {{in the work of the}} painter Clive Hicks-Jenkins <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>poet</b> Vernon Watkins.|$|E
5|$|In Wallonia, {{literature}} in French began a revival in 1881 {{with the creation}} of the La Jeune Belgique ("The Young Belgium") movement, which supported the creation of distinctively Belgian literature and opposed romanticism. Among the members of the Jeune Belgique were the writer Camille Lemonnier, whose works were often set against the background of Belgian peasant life in the naturalist style, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>poet</b> Charles Van Lerberghe. French language poetry flourished in Belgium in the early 20th century under Émile Verhaeren and Maurice Maeterlinck; Maeterlinck was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1911.|$|E

5|$|Meyerbeer's birthname was Jacob Liebmann Beer; he {{was born}} in Tasdorf (now a part of Rüdersdorf), near Berlin, then the capital of Prussia, to a Jewish family. His father was the {{enormously}} wealthy financier Judah Herz Beer (1769–1825) and his mother, Amalia (Malka) Wulff (1767–1854), to whom he was particularly devoted, also came from the moneyed elite. Their other children included the astronomer Wilhelm Beer <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>poet</b> Michael Beer. He was to adopt the surname Meyerbeer on the death of his grandfather Liebmann Meyer Wulff (1811) and the first name Giacomo during his period of study in Italy, around 1817.|$|E
5|$|Nell's story {{alternates}} {{between the}} perspectives of Nell Golightly, a seventeen-year-old girl, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>poet</b> Rupert Brooke. The novel begins as Nell's father dies while tending to the family's bee hives. Because she is the oldest child and her mother is long dead, Nell Golightly decides finds {{a job as a}} maid at The Orchard, a boarding house and tea room outside of Cambridge which caters to the students at the University there. There she, along with several other young women, serves guests and cleans the facilities. She also helps a local beekeeper tend his hives.|$|E

5|$|Ono {{is often}} {{associated}} with the Fluxus group, whose founder George Maciunas was her friend during the 1960s. Maciunas admired and promoted her work enthusiastically and gave Ono her U.S. show at his AG Gallery in 1961. He formally invited her to join the Fluxus group, but she declined because she wanted to remain independent. She did, however, collaborate with him, Charlotte Moorman, George Brecht, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>poet</b> Jackson Mac Low, among others associated with the group.|$|E
5|$|The novel's {{characters}} represent polarities of contrasting morality. The vengeful Bette and disingenuous Valérie {{stand on}} one side, with the merciful Adeline and her patient daughter Hortense on the other. The {{patriarch of the}} Hulot family, meanwhile, is consumed by his own sexual desire. Hortense's husband, the Polish exile Wenceslas Steinbock, represents artistic genius, though he succumbs to uncertainty and lack of motivation. Balzac based the character of Bette in part on his mother <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>poet</b> Marceline Desbordes-Valmore. At least one scene involving Baron Hulot was likely based on an event {{in the life of}} Balzac's friend, the novelist Victor Hugo.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War began, Bax {{moved to}} Sussex, taking up {{residence}} at the White Horse Hotel, Storrington, where he lived {{for the rest of}} his life. He abandoned composition and completed a book of memoirs about his early years, Farewell, My Youth. The Times found it at times waspish, at times reticent, surprising in parts, and regrettably short. Later in the war Bax was persuaded to contribute incidental music for a short film, Malta G. C.; he subsequently wrote music for David Lean's Oliver Twist (1948) and a second short film, Journey into History (1952). His other works from the period include the short Morning Song for piano and orchestra, and the Left-Hand Concertante (1949), both written for Cohen. Bax <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Poet</b> Laureate, John Masefield, worked on a pageant, The Play of Saint George in 1947, but the project was not completed.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the writers}} who {{fell victim to}} the regime of Sejanus and its aftermath, were the historians Aulus Cremutius Cordus and Velleius Paterculus <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>poet</b> Phaedrus. Cordus was brought to trial in AD 25 by Sejanus, under accusations of treason. He was charged for having eulogized Marcus Junius Brutus and spoken of Gaius Cassius Longinus {{as the last of}} the true Romans, which was {{considered}} an offence under the Lex Maiestatis; the Senate ordered the burning of his writings. His fall is elaborated upon by Seneca the Younger, in his letter to Cordus' daughter Marcia To Marcia, On Consolation. Seneca tells us that her father most likely incurred Sejanus' displeasure for criticising him because he had commissioned a statue of himself. We also know from this source that Cordus starved himself to death. Marcia was instrumental in saving her father's work so that it could be published again under Caligula.|$|E

The American Civil Liberties Union issued a press release criticizing the book burning, although coverage of the release was poor, and Reich ended up asking them not to help because he was annoyed that they had failed to criticize {{the destruction of the}} accumulators. In England A.S. Neill <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>poet</b> Herbert Read signed a letter of protest, but it was never published. On 23 July the remaining accumulators in New York were destroyed by S. A. Collins and Sons, who had built them.|$|E
5|$|Pinker {{was born}} in Montreal, Quebec, in 1954, to a middle-class Jewish family. His parents were Roslyn and Harry Pinker. His {{grandparents}} immigrated to Canada from Poland and Bessarabia in 1926, and owned a small necktie factory in Montreal. His father, a lawyer, first worked as a manufacturer's representative, while his mother was first a home-maker then a guidance counselor and high-school vice-principal. He has two younger siblings. His brother Robert is a policy analyst for the Canadian government, while his sister, Susan Pinker, is a psychologist and writer who authored The Sexual Paradox and The Village Effect. Pinker married Nancy Etcoff in 1980 and they divorced in 1992; he married Ilavenil Subbiah in 1995 and they too divorced. His third wife, whom he married in 2007, is the novelist and philosopher Rebecca Goldstein. He has two stepdaughters: the novelist Yael Goldstein Love <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>poet</b> Danielle Blau.|$|E

The controversy surrounding the paintings was described in Émile Zola's novel L'Œuvre (1886). The reception Whistler's painting received was mostly favourable, however, and largely vindicated him after the rejection he had experienced both in London and in Paris. It was greatly admired by his colleagues and friends Manet, the painter Gustave Courbet <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>poet</b> Charles Baudelaire. The art critic Théophile Thoré-Bürger {{saw it in the}} tradition of Goya and Velázquez. There were, however, those who were less favourable; certain French critics saw the English Pre-Raphaelite trend as somewhat eccentric.|$|E
