2500|$|This {{defensive}} {{strategy is}} often referred to as [...] "bait and switch". In this case, when the two players the defenders <b>are</b> <b>covering</b> are standing close to each other in the stack, one defender will move over to shade them deep, and the other will move slightly more towards the thrower. When one of the receivers makes a deep cut, the first defender picks them up, and if one makes an in-cut, the second defender covers them. The defenders communicate and switch their marks if their respective charges change their cuts from in to deep, or vice versa. The clam can also be used by the entire team, with different defenders covering in cuts, deep cuts, break side cuts, and dump cuts.|$|E

2500|$|Legend {{has it that}} Monongy, the man-fish, {{lives in}} the river. Some claim that there are records {{as far back as}} the French and Indian War (1754-1763) that {{describe}} encounters between British soldiers and strange aquatic creatures. The local Indian tribes referred to this creature as [...] "Monongy". There was even a Monongy craze in the early 1930s through the late 1950s. Sightings occurred on a weekly basis and the police department created a task force whose sole purpose was to investigate sightings of the creature. No evidence was ever produced to lend credence to the claims until May 12, 2003, when a privately owned fishing vessel was the first to take photos of the creature. The photos were available online for a short time until they were inexplicably taken down. Speculation persists that the government has procured the photographs and <b>are</b> <b>covering</b> up the existence of Monongy. Crypto-zoologists from around the world still visit the Monongahela every year to catch a glimpse of the elusive water beast.|$|E
2500|$|Hollyoaks had {{a long-running}} theme {{of having a}} [...] "dark gangster corner of the show" [...] first created with the {{character}} Scott Anderson (Daniel Hyde). Grace was brought into the show to fill that role of the gangster running The Loft night club. When Grace arrives in the village she is determined {{to find out the}} truth behind Clare's death. She knows Doctor Browning (Joseph Thompson) killed her sister in a hit and run incident and wants revenge. She notices Lindsey Butterfield (Sophie Austin) and Cindy Cunningham (Stephanie Waring) behaving suspiciously and begins to monitor them. She also confronts Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe) about Clare. Grace does not realise the three characters <b>are</b> <b>covering</b> up the murder of Doctor Browning. Lindsey becomes suspicious of Grace as soon as they meet. Austin told Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy that [...] "Grace is quite intimidating. Considering her relations, I don't think she's going to be the nicest of characters." [...] She also has an problematic relationship with Fraser because she believes that he loved Clare more. The show began to develop Grace's first feud storyline for Grace with Mercedes. When Mercedes receives Doctor Browning's life insurance money she flaunts her wealth in the village. This infuriates Grace and her hatred for Mercedes grows. She visits Trevor and makes it clear she intends to get revenge.|$|E

"Nay! nay! good Endicott," [...] said Sir Marmaduke, {{speaking}} in tones {{that were so}} conciliatory, so unlike his own quarrelsome temper, quick at taking offense, that Richard Lambert could not help wondering what was causing this change, [...] "Master Lambert hath no such intention--'pon my honor ...

6000|$|If {{you teach}} {{a man to}} keep his eyes upon what others think of him, unthinkingly to lead the life and hold the {{principles}} of the majority of his contemporaries, you must discredit in his eyes the one authoritative voice of his own soul. He may be a docile citizen; he will never be a man. It is ours, on the other hand, to disregard this babble and chattering of other men better and worse than we are, and to walk straight before us by what light we have. They may be right; but so, before heaven, are we. They may know; but we know also, and by that knowledge we must stand or fall. There {{is such a thing as}} loyalty to a man’s own better self; and from those who have not that, God help me, how am I to look for loyalty to others? The most dull, the most imbecile, at a certain moment turn round, at a certain point will hear no further argument, but stand unflinching by their own dumb, irrational sense of right. It is not only by steel or fire, but through contempt and blame, that the martyr fulfils the calling of his dear soul. Be glad if you are not tried by such extremities. But although all the world ranged themselves in one line to tell you ‘This is wrong,’ be you your own faithful vassal and the ambassador of God—throw down the glove and answer ‘This is right.’ Do you think you are only declaring yourself? Perhaps in some dim way, like a child who delivers a message not fully understood, you are opening wider the straits of prejudice and preparing mankind for some truer and more spiritual grasp of truth; perhaps, as you stand forth for your own judgment, you <b>are</b> <b>covering</b> a thousand weak ones with your body; perhaps, by this declaration alone, you have avoided the guilt of false witness against humanity and the little ones unborn. It is good, I believe, to be respectable, but much nobler to respect oneself and utter the voice of God. God, if there be any God, speaks daily in a new language by the tongues of men; the thoughts and habits of each fresh generation and each new-coined spirit throw another light upon the universe and contain another commentary on the printed Bibles; every scruple, every true dissent, every glimpse of something new, is a letter of God’s alphabet; and though there is a grave responsibility for all who speak, is there none for those who unrighteously keep silence and conform? Is not that also to conceal and cloak God’s counsel? And how should we regard the man of science who suppressed all facts that would not tally with the orthodoxy of the hour? ...|$|E
