5|$|Heydrich {{developed}} close professional relationships {{only within}} the circle of the SS security forces. Heinrich Müller was one such example, and Heydrich appears to have trusted him.

Herbert Kappler, who was appointed <b>as</b> <b>commander</b> of all SS security forces in Rome, {{was said to have}} been a protégé of Heydrich. SS personnel favoured by Heydrich, especially those who attended the Wannsee conference, possessed similar traits of devotion to SS, lack of remorse regarding brutal or genocidal orders, and above all personal loyalty to Heydrich in his capacity <b>as</b> <b>commander</b> of the security forces. On the other hand, Heydrich's dislike and distrust of Arthur Nebe and Walter Schellenberg may have stemmed from their independence and ambition.|$|E
