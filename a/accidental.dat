5|$|On December 27, 1880, Wyatt {{testified that}} White's {{shooting}} was <b>accidental.</b> Brocius expressed regret, {{saying he had}} not intended to shoot White. Gunsmith Jacob Gruber testified that Curly Bill's single-action revolver was defective, allowing it to be discharged at half-cock. A statement from White before he died was introduced stating that the shooting was <b>accidental.</b> The judge ruled that the shooting was <b>accidental</b> and released Brocius. Brocius, however, remained intensely angry about how Wyatt had pistol-whipped him and became an enemy to the Earps. Virgil was also appointed acting town marshal of Tombstone.|$|E

5|$|Norwegian ethnographer Thor Heyerdahl {{hypothesized}} that the Pacific was settled by voyages from South America {{and set out to}} prove that with his Kon-Tiki expedition. Scholars did not take Heyerdahl's hypothesis seriously. New Zealander Andrew Sharp proposed the <b>accidental</b> voyaging hypothesis in 1957, which (erroneously) argued that Oceania was too vast to have been settled by intentional voyaging so migrations must have happened by <b>accidental</b> drift voyages. Sharp granted that Polynesians likely settled the Pacific from Asia, but held the opinion that their crude vessels and navigational tools were not reliable for intentional sailing from Tahiti to Hawaii or New Zealand. He stated that voyages of more than 300 miles were likely <b>accidental</b> voyages, with landfall at the mercy of wind and current. A 1973 study and computer simulation by Levison, Ward, and Web investigated the probability of Sharp's hypothesis but found it improbable.|$|E

5|$|The medieval {{doctrine}} of divine simplicity also poses problems for religious language. This suggests that God has no <b>accidental</b> propertiesâ€“ these are properties that a being can have {{which do not}} contribute to its essence. If God has no <b>accidental</b> properties, he cannot be as he is traditionally conceived, because properties such as goodness are <b>accidental.</b> If divine simplicity is accepted, then to describe God as good would entail that goodness and God have the same definition. Such limits can also be problematic to religious believers; for example, the Bible regularly ascribes different emotions to God, ascriptions which would be implausible according to the {{doctrine of}} divine simplicity.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Accidentals</b> (e.g., added sharps, {{flats and}} natural {{that change the}} notes) were not always specified, {{somewhat}} as in certain fingering notations for guitar-family instruments (tablatures) today. However, Renaissance musicians would have been highly trained in dyadic counterpoint and thus possessed this and other information necessary to read a score correctly, even if the <b>accidentals</b> were not written in. As such, [...] "what modern notation requires <b>accidentals</b> would then have been perfectly apparent without notation to a singer versed in counterpoint." [...] (See musica ficta.) A singer would interpret his or her part by figuring cadential formulas with other parts in mind, and when singing together, musicians would avoid parallel octaves and parallel fifths or alter their cadential parts in light of decisions by other musicians [...] It is through contemporary tablatures for various plucked instruments that we have gained much information about which <b>accidentals</b> were performed by the original practitioners.|$|R
