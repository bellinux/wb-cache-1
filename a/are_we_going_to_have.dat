500|$|Another pivotal romantic {{relationship}} {{for the character}} occurred when Chloe began dating her best friend Kevin Fisher (Greg Rikaart). The decision to develop the friendship into a romance was debated by the writers, as it was Hendrickson and Rikaart who approached the writers wanting to work together. Due to their real-life friendship, Rikaart said of the storyline turn, [...] "The level of comfort is so easy, certainly for portraying the friendship part of the Kevin/Chloe relationship, that is a no-brainer. [...] So it was like, when <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> to start acting?" [...] The relationship is plagued with constant issues, such as interference from Kevin's mentally unstable ex-wife Jana Hawkes (Emily O'Brien), and mob princess Angelina Veneziano's (Diana DeGarmo) intense crush on Kevin (which leads to a brief marriage, with Angelina's mob father threatening to kill Kevin if he doesn't wed his daughter). Angelina leaves town and Chloe and Kevin finally marry. In 2013, Kevin and Chloe have financial troubles which Kevin thinks can be solved through criminal acts; Hendrickson said, [...] "Money is usually a common issue between couples. They’re kind of battling through this struggle. He’s trying to do his best {{to take care of}} the family and morally, it just doesn’t sit well with her. Especially with what he’s been through in the past." [...] Rikaart told On-Air On-Soaps that he and Hendrickson have discussed wanting the characters to break up, [...] "We always say, 'We have done this. We have played this.

40|$|What time is it?', 'When <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a break?' These {{questions}} are probably recognised by {{most people who}} are working in the school. The questions demonstrate clearly how time controls {{a large part of the}} everyday life of the school. Time is linked to one of the most basic questions of philosophy, and several philosophers in the course of history have discussed questions concerning time. The present paper tries to elucidate time as a phenomenon, and especially to focus on the school's relation to time. To provide a historical background, the paper begins with a short retrospective survey of what certain philosophers have thought and written on the subject of time. Does time exist in itself? Or does time exist only through people's experience of it ? We can pause to reflect on the thesis that time, considered from one perspective, exists through people's being-in-the-world and through their experience of the same. Within different organisations, for example the school, time must be regarded as being under strict chronological control. This time-control influences, of course, the experience of time within the school, and the subject experience of time can be called 'subjective time', or rather - lived time.

40|$|To help {{clarify the}} {{relationship}} between climate change and Joplin tornadoes, some questions need to be asked, such as: (1) Can the prediction of the Joplin tornado outbreak be improved without considering climate change? (2) Is the Joplin tornado outbreak influenced by climate change and related to other severe weather-related events? (3) <b>Are</b> <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> more and stronger tornado outbreaks in the future? I believe that the author is trying to address the first question and get people focused on improving the prediction of a single tornado outbreak or a severe local storm in general, without {{having to worry about}} climate change. In this regard, I agree with the author’s point of view. What {{we need to do is}} to improve the accuracy of a numerical weather prediction (NWP), which requires more accurate initial and boundary conditions and better modeling techniques. With a better NWP model, the location and intensity of a tornado outbreak can be more accurately predicted. More importantly, we will have improved lead times, accuracy, and dissemination of severe weather warnings by the National Weather Service (NWS), which has been doing a reasonably good job in predicting recent severe tornado outbreaks. The answer to the second question is yes, based on numerous scientific evidence, from my poin...|$|E
