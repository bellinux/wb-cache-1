40|$|Abstract — Swarm {{intelligence}} {{deals with}} the behavior of natural or <b>artificial</b> <b>swarms.</b> Swarms are systems that consist of many individuals that are organized and coordinated by principles of decentralized control, indirect communication, and self-organization. The concept is employed in work on artificial intelligence introduced by Gerardo Beni and Jing Wang in 1989, {{in the context of}} cellular robotic systems. Clustering is the unsupervised classification of patterns (observations, data items, or feature vectors) into groups (clusters). The clustering problem has been addressed in many contexts and by researchers in many disciplines; this reflects its broad appeal and usefulness as one of the steps in exploratory data analysis. This paper explores the role of SI in clustering different kinds of datasets. It finally describes a new SI technique for partitioning any dataset into an optimal numb er of groups through one run of optimization...|$|R

This paper {{presents}} a microscopic model (agent positions, directions, and interactions are explicitly modeled) of mobile agents (or self-propelled particles) that {{is inspired by}} the “complex transport networks ” reported by [4].

At least most of the irregular and complex patterns are transient. The patterns found during the transient are more complex than those the system converges to. Still, this transient behavior is relevant. I empirically investigate the transient times in dependence of the system’s size and give examples. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this work, {{we propose}} {{a method for}} self-organized {{adaptive}} task partitioning in a swarm of robots. Task partitioning refers to the decomposition of a task into less complex subtasks, which can then be tackled separately. Task partitioning {{can be observed in}} many species of social animals, where it provides several benefits for the group. Selforganized task partitioning in <b>artificial</b> <b>swarm</b> systems is currently not widely studied, although it has clear advantages in large groups. We propose a fully decentralized adaptive method that allows a swarm of robots to autonomously decide whether to partition a task into two sequential subtasks or not. The method is tested on a simulated foraging problem. We study the method’s performance in two different environments. In one environment the performance of the system is optimal when the foraging task is partitioned, in the other case when it is not. We show that by employing the method proposed in this paper, a swarm of autonomous robots can reach optimal performance in both environments. ...|$|E
