5|$|At the Simpsons' home, Bart and Ralph {{discover}} that the penitentiary will once again {{be used by the}} town, <b>and</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> they forgot to disable the power. Unaware that the power is active, Mayor Quimby straps himself into the electric chair in a publicity attempt. Ralph then tells Bart that Lisa can probably {{figure out a way to}} warn the Mayor. She decides to launch a model rocket with a warning message attached and aims it toward the penitentiary. However, the rocket is blown off-course and crashes through Mr. Burns' office window. Mr. Burns reads the note and disables the penitentiary's power. In the aftermath, the Simpsons congratulate Ralph, for pointing out that Lisa could solve the problem.|$|E
5|$|Antibodies are {{secreted}} by B {{cells of}} the adaptive immune system, mostly by differentiated B cells called plasma cells. Antibodies can occur in two physical forms, a soluble form that is secreted from the cell to be free in the blood plasma, and a membrane-bound form that {{is attached to the}} surface of a B cell and {{is referred to as the}} B-cell receptor (BCR). The BCR is found only on the surface of B cells and facilitates the activation of these cells and their subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories called plasma cells or memory B cells that will survive in the body <b>and</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> same antigen so the B cells can respond faster upon future exposure. In most cases, interaction of the B cell with a T helper cell is necessary to produce full activation of the B cell and, therefore, antibody generation following antigen binding. Soluble antibodies are released into the blood and tissue fluids, as well as many secretions to continue to survey for invading microorganisms.|$|E
5|$|No one {{familiar}} {{with the history of}} this country can deny that congressional committees are useful. It is necessary to investigate before legislating, but the line between investigating and persecuting is a very fine one, and the junior Senator from Wisconsin has stepped over it repeatedly. His primary achievement has been in confusing the public mind, as between the internal and the external threats of Communism. We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law. We will not walk in fear, one of another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason, if we dig deep in our history and our doctrine, <b>and</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> we are not descended from fearful men—not from men who feared to write, to speak, to associate and to defend causes that were, for the moment, unpopular.|$|E

25|$|Culture is {{definitely}} beyond ethnicity and race. Healthcare professionals {{need to learn}} about the tolerance of other's beliefs <b>and</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> the professional care is about meeting patients' needs even if they do not align with our personal beliefs. Discovering our own beliefs and why we have them (from upbringing or modeling of parents, for example) helps understand what is believed and actions at time when others are cared firwith different beliefs. As a result, it is essential for healthcare professionals to practice cultural competence and recognize the differences as well as cultural sensitivities to provide holistic care for the patients.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to recent}} deaths, littering, and vandalism, the {{pinnacle}} {{has been under}} strict evaluation and observation by local Shiprock Pinnacle Tribal Advocates and by two Navajo Chapter government organizations since early 2016. They oversee the area and encourage the public to not drive around the formation as an open access. Hiking, filming, and driving is all prohibited to the public due to its sacred nature and its sacred space. According to the Navajo traditionalists, there is an ecosystem of living and non-living matter {{that needs to be}} protected and unharmed. In the Navajo traditional way, people are to respect the ecosystem and not disrupt its processes. It is recommended that the public respect the Navajo people who visit on a daily basis for religious activities and other miscellaneous purposes, as it is Navajo trust land. A core/protection and buffer zones will be established soon. Local Shiprock Pinnacle Tribal Advocates and the two Navajo Chapter organizations also encourage visitors to use common sense etiquette <b>and</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> the Navajo Nation is a sovereign, self-governed nation with rules and laws that must be followed.|$|E

She explained, [...] "But what happens is as soon as you put the dialogue in, the dancing just goes to pot! So it's all about putting the movement and the dialogue together and remembering what your character is supposed to be thinking at the same time – that's quite tricky!" [...] Jones praised Mythen and said the teacher often reminded the actors to relax into the dance <b>and</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> their character would have been doing it for years, as they would have learnt at an early age. Jones added [...] "the novelty for us with three weeks of dancing is not quite the same!" ...|$|E

500|$|... "La Llamada" [...] was {{the first}} song {{recorded}} for Live! (1993). It was written by Selena y Los Dinos backup singer Pete Astudillo and Selena's brother, principal record producer and songwriter A. B. Quintanilla III. It was produced by Quintanilla III and Argentine music producer Bebu Silvetti. The song {{was intended to be}} one of three studio tracks for Selena's Live! album. Astudillo and Quintanilla III had spent an hour writing a song together. They wanted to write a song on a topic that many women face with their boyfriends. Quintanilla III had wanted to empower women, letting them know that they should hold their heads up <b>and</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> life goes on. Selena favored the lyrical content and central theme, a common one in her songs. [...] "La Llamada" [...] was recorded in Corpus Christi, Texas, at Selena's father and manager Abraham Quintanilla, Jr.'s recording studio Q-Productions. Before Live! was released, the song was mixed by Brian [...] "Red" [...] Moore, a family friend. Because Selena favored the song, the band released a music video. It was filmed in a beach house in Malibu, California. The video features Selena dancing with guys on one side and woman on the other. In other scenes, Selena is belting the lyrics behind blue curtains.|$|E
500|$|On 11 August 1586, {{after being}} {{implicated in the}} Babington Plot, Mary was arrested while out riding and taken to Tixall. In a {{successful}} attempt to entrap her, Walsingham had deliberately arranged for Mary's letters to be smuggled out of Chartley. Mary was misled into thinking her letters were secure, while in reality they were deciphered and read by Walsingham. From these letters {{it was clear that}} Mary had sanctioned the attempted assassination of Elizabeth. She was moved to Fotheringhay Castle in a four-day journey ending on 25 September, and in October was put on trial for treason under the Act for the Queen's Safety before a court of 36 noblemen, including Cecil, Shrewsbury, and Walsingham. Spirited in her defence, Mary denied the charges. She told her triers, [...] "Look to your consciences <b>and</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> the theatre of the whole world is wider than the kingdom of England". She protested that she had been denied the opportunity to review the evidence, that her papers had been removed from her, that she was denied access to legal counsel and that as a foreign anointed queen she had never been an English subject and thus could not be convicted of treason.|$|E

2500|$|In the aftermath, Borges {{found himself}} much in demand as a {{lecturer}} {{and one of}} the intellectual leaders of the Argentine opposition. In 1951 he was asked by anti-Peronist friends to run for president of SADE. Borges, then suffering from depression caused by a failed romance, reluctantly accepted. He later recalled that he would awake every morning <b>and</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> Perón was President and feel deeply depressed and ashamed. Perón's government had seized control of the Argentine mass media and regarded SADE with indifference. Borges later recalled, however, [...] "Many distinguished men of letters did not dare set foot inside its doors." [...] Meanwhile, SADE became an increasing refuge for critics of the regime. SADE official Luisa Mercedes Levinson noted, [...] "We would gather every week to tell the latest jokes about the ruling couple and even dared to sing the songs of the French Resistance, as well as 'La Marseillaise'".|$|E
2500|$|The Chronicles have a British Victorian era flavour {{that was}} much in fashion during Lewis's lifetime, but may now be seen as {{politically}} incorrect. Of Lewis, Kyrie O'Connor writes: [...] "In his time, {{people thought it was}} amusing to make fun of other cultures. We don't. Read the stories, ask questions, <b>and</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> the person who wrote this story was altogether too human." [...] Claims of racism can be seen as countered by Lewis's positive portrayal of two Calormenes and the lack of racism shown to them by Narnian nobility. In The Horse and His Boy, the female protagonist Aravis is a Calormene noblewoman who is accepted whole-heartedly by the Archenlanders and Narnians, and comes to marry Shasta/Cor, a prince of a more European ethnicity; a progressive and bold statement by Lewis in a time when mixed relationships were neither as common nor accepted as they have been in more recent years. Accordingly, the moral critique that Lewis provides does not rest on any qualities supposed to be inherent in the Calormene race, such as skin color, but rests on the tyrannical values of the hegemonical Calormene culture, in which freedom is scorned and the weak must give way to the strong. [...] Depicting Lewis’ moral critique of the Calormene culture as a ‘racist’ critique would therefore require making the tacit and racist claim, and one not made by Lewis, that morality is an inherent racial rather than cultural characteristic. In The Last Battle, the young Calormene warrior Emeth (whose name is Hebrew for 'truth') is deemed a worthy person by Aslan regardless of his skin colour {{and despite the fact that}} he was a worshipper of Tash. Indeed, Lewis goes on to mention in The Last Battle that those who worship Tash and who are virtuous are in fact worshipping Aslan, and those who are immoral and who worship Aslan are in fact worshipping Tash: ...|$|E
