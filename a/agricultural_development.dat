5|$|At first, human {{activity}} had not posed a significant {{threat to the}} Puerto Rican amazon. The Taíno hunted the parrot but without much effect on its population. In the past two hundred years, however, many factors {{have led to a}} drastic decrease in the birds' numbers: <b>agricultural</b> <b>development,</b> the construction of roads, hydroelectric development, and the adoption of young chicks as pets. Especially during {{the latter half of the}} 19th century, most of Puerto Rico's virgin forests, a historical habitat of the species, were cleared for <b>agricultural</b> <b>development,</b> primarily for the production of sugar, cotton, corn and rice. The amazon quickly came to rely on these crops as its main food source and so became seen as a pest; local farmers repelled or hunted the bird if possible. As agriculture expanded, the amazon's habitat disappeared further and its population declined.|$|E

5|$|Human {{activity}} {{is arguably the}} main reason for the population decline of the Puerto Rican amazon. Early settlers of Puerto Rico, such as the Taíno, hunted it for food consumption but managed to maintain a healthy ecological balance. Later, habitat destruction, capture of immature individuals for the pet industry, hunting and predation contributed to the sharp population decline. The clearing of mature forests for <b>agricultural</b> <b>development</b> is {{the main reason for}} the decline of population.|$|E

5|$|Oryzomys albiventer is a rodent in {{the genus}} Oryzomys of family Cricetidae from {{interior}} western Mexico, {{in the states}} of Jalisco, Guanajuato, and Michoacán. First described in 1901 as a separate species, it was later lumped under O.couesi and the marsh rice rat (O.palustris) until it was reinstated as a species in 2009. It differs from neighboring Oryzomys populations in size and measurements and is a large, brightly colored species with a long tail and robust skull and molars. Its range has been much impacted by <b>agricultural</b> <b>development,</b> but isolated populations are thought to persist.|$|E
5|$|Plantations {{continued}} to develop along {{the fringes of}} present-day West Virginia. By {{the close of the}} 18th century, Harman Blennerhassett had constructed a mansion on his plantation on Blennerhassett Island and Moses Shepherd had built Shepherd Hall near Wheeling, both in the Ohio River valley. Despite the <b>agricultural</b> <b>development</b> of then western Virginia's bottomlands and the resulting wealth of the plantation owners, the hinterlands of the Allegheny Mountains and Allegheny Plateau regions remained underpopulated and inhabited by subsistence farmers of meager means {{into the middle of the}} 19th century. By the 1860 United States Census, Berkeley, Greenbrier, Hampshire, Hardy, Jefferson, Kanawha, and Monroe counties consequently had the largest populations of slaves in present-day West Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the early}} 19th century the Everglades {{have been a}} subject of {{interest}} for <b>agricultural</b> <b>development.</b> The first attempt to drain the Everglades occurred in 1882 when a Pennsylvania land developer named Hamilton Disston constructed the first canals. Though these attempts were largely unsuccessful, Disston's purchase of land spurred tourism and real estate development of the state. The political motivations of Governor Napoleon Bonaparte Broward resulted in more successful attempts at canal construction between 1906 and 1920. Recently reclaimed wetlands were used for cultivating sugarcane and vegetables, while urban development began in the Everglades.|$|E

5|$|The native Mesolithic {{populations were}} slow in {{gradually}} assimilating the agricultural way of life, beginning {{with just the}} use of ceramics. It took a thousand years into the Neolithic period before they adopted animal husbandry (which became especially important to them) and plant cultivation to any appreciable degree. When they eventually developed interest in the more fertile areas utilized by the late Danubian cultures, they became the threat that compelled the Danubian farmers to fortify their settlements.

5|$|The farm invasions {{severely}} impacted <b>agricultural</b> <b>development.</b> Zimbabwe {{had produced}} over two {{million tons of}} maize in 2000; by 2008 this had declined to approximately 450,000. By October 2003, Human Rights Watch reported {{that half of the}} country's population were food insecure, lacking enough food to meet basic needs. By 2009, 75% of Zimbabwe's population were relying on food aid, the highest proportion of any country at that time. Zimbabwe faced continuing economic decline. In 2000, the country's GDP was US $7.4 billion; by 2005 this had declined to US $3.4 billion. Inflation resulted in economic crisis. By 2007, Zimbabwe had the highest inflation rate in the world, at 7600%. By 2008, inflation exceeded 100,000% and a loaf of bread cost a third of the average daily wage. Increasing numbers of Zimbabweans relied on remittances from relatives abroad.|$|E
5|$|The rufous-crowned sparrow {{is treated}} as a species of least concern, or not {{threatened}} with extinction, by BirdLife International due to its large geographical range of about , estimated population of 2.4million individuals, and lack of a 30% population decline over the last ten years. In years without sufficient rains, many birds fail to breed {{and those that do}} produce fewer offspring. Some of the local populations of this bird are threatened and declining in number. The island subspecies and populations have declined in some cases: A. r. sanctorum of the Todos Santos Islands is believed to be extinct, and the populations on Santa Catalina Island and Baja California's Islas de San Martin have not been observed since the early 1900s. Populations of the species in southern California are also becoming more restricted in range because of urbanization and <b>agricultural</b> <b>development</b> in the region. Additionally, the sparrow is known to have been poisoned by the rodenticide warfarin, though {{more research is needed to}} determine the effects of pesticides on the rufous-crowned sparrow.|$|E

5|$|Plantations that {{operated}} {{within the}} present-day boundaries of West Virginia {{were located in}} the counties of the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians and in the Kanawha and Ohio River valley regions. Beginning in the mid-to-late 18th century, members of the Washington family and other prominent Virginia families began to build elegant Georgian mansions on their plantations in the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians region of present-day West Virginia. Plantations initially developed in the counties lying within the Northern Neck Proprietary of Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron within the Shenandoah Valley and South Branch Potomac River valleys. Slavery as practiced through plantations in the American South was carried over from the plantations of the Piedmont and Tidewater regions of Virginia, where plantations had become the foundation of society and industry. Following the French and Indian War, settlement and <b>agricultural</b> <b>development</b> continued unabated in the Shenandoah and South Branch Potomac valleys. Early instances of western Virginia plantations with grand homes include the John Ariss-designed Harewood (1774) for George Washington's brother Samuel Washington and Happy Retreat (1780) built by Washington's younger brother Charles Washington, {{both of which are}} located near Charles Town in present-day Jefferson County.
