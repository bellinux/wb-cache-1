He testified that he learned of Watada's feelings about the war soon after Watada concluded, in early January 2006, that the war was illegal. Antonia stated, [...] "I told him I was concerned.

He sharply cut the state budget, producing {{a million dollars}} surplus. He was defeated for reelection in 1940, but was elected governor again in 1942 and 1944. He supervised a complex system of civil defense and statewide services on the homefront during the war.

As chairman of a subcommittee of the Armed Services committee, Baldwin engaged in a long-running dispute with Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy, McCarthy alleged that Baldwin was whitewashing an episode in which <b>Army</b> <b>prosecutors</b> in 1944 gained the death penalty for German soldiers accused of massacring Americans at the Malmedy Massacre.
