5|$|After the {{valuable}} coins were issued, Lépes demanded the tithe {{for the previous}} years in one sum. Historians estimate that the peasant families were required to pay six to nine gold florins, although {{the value of an}} average peasant lot was only about 40 florins. Most peasants were unable to pay this amount, especially because they <b>also</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> pay the seigneurial taxes to the owners of their parcels.|$|E
5|$|Disaster Transport {{originally}} {{opened on}} May 11, 1985 as Avalanche Run and was entirely outdoors. It was built {{next to the}} beach, on the former spot of Jumbo Jet and later, WildCat. Many other rides <b>also</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be relocated. The original ride cost $3.4 million: $1.9 million to manufacture and $1.5 million to install.|$|E
5|$|Flamininus also {{separated}} all {{coastal cities}} of Laconia from Spartan rule {{and placed them}} under Achean protection. The remains of Sparta's fleet were put under custody of these coastal cities. Nabis <b>also</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> withdraw his garrisons from Cretan cities and revoke several social and economic reforms that had strengthened Sparta's military capabilities.|$|E

5|$|Göring {{ordered that}} no more {{transport}} flights be made. Albert Kesselring complained that this would deny the Axis forces vital supplies, and Göring once again permitted flights. This time they were to travel via Sardinia, {{but no more than}} 60–70 flights would be allowed per night; some 250 had been mounted daily before Flax. The transports <b>also</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> run the gauntlet of radar-equipped Bristol Beaufighters but these rarely were successful at intercepting them.|$|E
5|$|Horses {{used for}} chariot warfare {{were not only}} trained for combat conditions, but because many chariots were pulled {{by a team of}} two to four horses, they <b>also</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> learn to work {{together}} with other animals in close quarters under chaotic conditions.|$|E
5|$|In June 2010, Costa {{returned}} to the Colchoneros, initially as a backup to Sergio Agüero and Diego Forlán – Atlético also paid an undisclosed sum to Braga to buy all the residual 30% economic rights (the former <b>also</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> pay in excess of €833,000 in agent's fees to Gestifute). He was an unused substitute as Atlético won the 2010 UEFA Super Cup on 27 August.|$|E

5|$|In the Grisons, the {{situation}} also reverted to pre-war conditions. The Habsburgs could keep their rights over {{eight of the}} communes of the Zehngerichtebund, but <b>also</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> accept that league's alliance with the two other leagues and with the Swiss Confederacy. Ultimately, this arrangement {{would lead to the}} Habsburgs losing the Prättigau to the Three Leagues, {{with the exception of a}} temporary re-occupation during the Thirty Years' War nearly 130 years later.|$|E
5|$|Ljudevit Posavski, Croatian Duke of Pannonian Croatia, led a {{resistance}} to Frankish domination. Ljudevit <b>also</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> fight against Dalmatian Croatia, as their prince Borna was a Frankish ally. After unsuccessful resistance by Ljudevit and Pannonian Croats, the Franks again controlled Istria, Dalmatia, and Pannonia. Nevertheless, Dalmatian Croatia remained a semi-independent duchy {{between the two}} Empires, as they {{had a right to}} elect their own prince.|$|E

50|$|Independent suspension: The arms <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{transmit}} traction and braking loads, usually accomplished via {{a longitudinal}} link. They <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> control caster. Note that brake torques <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be reacted - either {{by a second}} longitudinal link, or by rotating the hub, which forces the lateral arms out of plane, so allowing them to react 'spin' forces, or by rigidly fixing the longitudinal link to the hub.|$|R
5|$|Part of {{the battle}} was shot at Ústí nad Labem in the Czech Republic. Only the {{entrance}} to Aslan's How was built on location. Adamson wanted Peter and Miraz's duel to feel unique and not like a controlled, overly choreographed fencing match: Moseley and Castellitto began training for the scene in November 2006. The stunt coordinator Allan Poppleton doubled for Castellitto in some shots because they are similar in size. For claustrophobic shots, cameras were built into their shields. The main camera was placed on a 360 degree track surrounding the ruin it takes place on. The filmmakers dug a large {{hole in the ground}} for the scene where the Narnians cause the pillars supporting the growth near Aslan's How to collapse on the Telmarines. The earth was then restored following completion of the scene. They <b>also</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> restore the grass after filming numerous cavalry charges. 18,000 fern plants were imported to the Czech Republic to create a forest. A scene shot in Poland, which involved building a cliff face, <b>also</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> leave no trace behind. Filming finished by September 8, 2007.|$|E
5|$|Sweden had won {{its most}} prestigious victory, and Denmark had {{suffered}} its most costly defeat. Denmark {{was forced to}} yield the provinces of Scania, Halland, Blekinge and the island of Bornholm. Halland had already been under Swedish control since {{the signing of the}} Treaty of Brömsebro in 1645, but they now became Swedish territory indefinitely. Denmark <b>also</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> surrender the Norwegian province Trøndelag to Sweden.|$|E
5|$|Tickets for the 2009 final {{were similar}} to ATM cards, with an {{integrated}} chip storing the ticket holder's personal information {{in order to ensure}} that the ticket is being presented by its legitimate owner. As further security, tickets <b>also</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be presented with an adequate form of photographic identification. However, despite these security measures, counterfeit tickets were still produced, forcing UEFA to issue a statement warning people against buying tickets from touts.|$|E

5|$|About {{the time}} of the first landing in 1969, it was decided to use an {{existing}} Saturn V to launch the Skylab orbital laboratory pre-built on the ground, replacing the original plan to construct it in orbit from several Saturn IB launches; this eliminated Apollo 20. NASA's yearly budget also began to shrink in light of the successful landing, and NASA <b>also</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> make funds available for the development of the upcoming Space Shuttle. By 1971, the decision was made to also cancel missions 18 and 19. The two unused Saturn Vs became museum exhibits at the John F. Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island, Florida, George C. Marshall Space Center in Huntsville, Alabama, Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, Louisiana, and Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.|$|E
5|$|After a {{company-wide}} {{contest to}} name the aircraft, the initial prototype received the name Pirate and made its first flight on 2 October 1946. Flight testing revealed severe aerodynamic problems, mostly caused by the airfoil section and thickness of the wing. The vertical stabilizer <b>also</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be redesigned to smooth out the airflow {{at the intersection of}} the horizontal and vertical stabilizers. Other changes included the addition of dive brakes {{on the sides of the}} fuselage and the replacement of the Metalite panels near the engine's exhaust with stainless steel ones.|$|E

The letters requested monetary compensation for downloads of the company's licensed material. The recipients were asked to contact Odex within one week and pay settlement fees from S$3,000 to S$5,000 or face legal action.

5|$|Artificial {{lighting}} {{of any sort}} was largely absent during the industrial development of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Using candles or oil lamps to illuminate a textile factory was costly, and economically unsound. With the advent of industrial means of production, not only were new textile halls physically larger, but they <b>also</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be lit more brightly {{for longer periods of}} time. Driven by great demand, and made possible through Lavoisier's theoretical work regarding the role of oxygen in combustion, the end of the 18th century saw a continuous series of improvements in lighting technology.|$|E
5|$|As a {{security}} measure, The Football Association secretly manufactured {{a replica of}} the trophy for use in exhibitions rather than the original. This replica was used on subsequent occasions up until 1970 when the original trophy had to be handed back to FIFA. Since FIFA had explicitly denied the FA permission to create a replica, the replica <b>also</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> disappear from public view and was for many years kept under its creator's bed. This replica was eventually sold at an auction in 1997 for £254,500, when it was purchased by FIFA. The high auction price, ten times the reserve price of £20,000–£30,000, was led by speculation that the auctioned trophy was not the replica trophy but the original itself. Subsequent testing by FIFA, however, confirmed the auctioned trophy was indeed a replica and FIFA soon afterwards arranged for the replica to be lent for display at the English National Football Museum, which was then based in Preston but is now in Manchester.|$|E
5|$|As {{commander}} of the 3rd Air Division and later the Third Air Force, he was subordinate to United States Air Forces in Europe, but <b>also</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> deal with USAF headquarters and the Strategic Air Command. He was also designated the point of contact {{for dealing with the}} British government. Despite his lowly rank of major general, he was able to hold his own in dealings with more senior British officers, and with senior British officials, including the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Clement Attlee. His command was understaffed, lacked a clear mission, and there was no agreement with the British government regarding base rights or financial responsibilities. Nor was it easy dealing with his Strategic Air Command colleagues like Archie J. Old, Jr., who were not renowned for diplomatic skill. Johnson's deft touch was perhaps exemplified by his order that the Royal Air Force Ensign be flown over US bases in the UK alongside the flag of the United States.|$|E
