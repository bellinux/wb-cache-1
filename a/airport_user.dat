5000|$|In addition, to Modern Air's {{abortive}} {{attempts to}} launch a regular, year round long-haul charter programme from West Berlin in partnership with Berliner Flugring, the airline and its long-standing business partner also attempted {{for a number of}} years to gain all necessary approvals for West Berlin's first-ever charter flight to Moscow as part of a one-off, all-inclusive city break package in the Soviet capital. Modern Air's management hoped to be able to build on its earlier success of 1968, when interventions at the highest level of the US government with its Soviet counterpart had resulted in Modern Air becoming the first US non-scheduled airline to be given permission at short notice to fly a US charter party to Moscow for a brief stopover on its first transpolar flight ("Polar Byrd I"). In addition to being a test of the limits of East-West cooperation in the then prevailing political climate of Détente (which aimed to create a more stable and predictable political environment by easing Cold War tensions), it was thought that this would be a major publicity coup for the airline and help it to raise its public profile further. Despite appearing cooperative initially, the Soviet authorities imposed increasingly onerous conditions on the airline and tour operator for the programme to go ahead. These ultimately proved unworkable and forced its abandonment. Similar to the case of the Bulgarian communist authorities' sudden and unexplained withdrawal of landing and overflight rights for flights originating/terminating in West Berlin (despite the much-needed hard currency Bulgaria earned from air navigation fees and <b>airport</b> <b>user</b> charges paid by the American and British airlines that operated these flights), some Western political observers at the time suspected behind-the-scenes East German lobbying of its Warsaw Pact ally and chief political backer respectively to have caused this to ensure East Germany's political and economic interests were not ignored in its Cold war allies' interactions with the West, especially where these concerned relations with West Berlin.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this research, {{we used a}} multinomial logit (MNL) {{discrete}} choice analysis {{technique to}} deepen {{the understanding of the}} mode choice behavior of various <b>airport</b> <b>user</b> groups categorized by trip purpose and trip distance for ground airport access. We used revealed preference (RP) data collected by an on-site-survey administrated by the Korea Transport Institute (KOTI) at the Kimpo International Airport passenger terminal in South Korea. Initially, four basic models were selected from a variety of model specifications, and these were analyzed to address general preferences in mode choice. The models were then evaluated in terms of the resulting estimation. The best-fitting model specification among four models was chosen for further study. Both trip distance models (standard-distance (SD) and long-distance (LD)) and trip purpose models (departing (D) and non-departing (ND)) were estimated. The results analyzed in this study encompass an unambiguous spectrum of mode choice behaviors associated with distinct <b>airport</b> <b>user</b> groups. The fundamental information, either revealed or reflected by modeling ground airport access for various <b>airport</b> <b>user</b> groups, could be essential not only to transportation planners-especially at the first phase of airport planning- but also to airport authorities faced with difficulties in managing ground transportation facilities to effectively serve airport users...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the airport}} {{privatization}} and deregulation trend in recent years, {{whether or not}} the privatized or commercialized airports should be left unregulated is still an open question. Related to this issue, one question that has received a very little attention to date is if and how pricing behavior of unregulated airports affect downstream airline competition, especially the competition between airlines offering differentiated services such as the case of full service airlines (FSA) vis-a-vis low cost carriers (LCC). If the upstream monopoly (airport) hinders downstream (airline) competition, the welfare effects of the upstream unregulated monopoly may be much larger than initially suspected. This aspect of airport pricing has not been formally incorporated in the debate on airport price regulation. In this paper, we study a duopoly model to capture the differential competitive effects of changing <b>airport</b> <b>user</b> charges on FSAs and LCCs. By making reasonable assumptions on differential price elasticities, unit costs and competitive behavior as manifested by firmspecific conduct parameters, we perform numerical simulations to measure differential effects on an FSA and an LCC of increasing airside user charge by an unregulated upstream monopolist airport. Our analytical and numerical results suggest existence of the asymmetric effects of an airport's monopoly pricing on LCC and FSA. That is, LCCs suffer more from an identical cost increase than FSAs and are, therefore, more vulnerable to monopolistic pricing practices of an unregulated airport. This implies that unregulated airport pricing would reduce the extent of competition in downstream airline markets, and thus, cause a further detrimental effect on welfare over and above the first-order dead weight loss of airport's monopolistic pricing. Considering that LCCs have brought considerable reduction of average fares and the associated welfare gains, {{it is important for the}} governments to take into account of these asymmetric effects of increasing <b>airport</b> <b>user</b> charges on FSAs and LCCs when they consider the form and extent of regulation or deregulation. Although our model and simulation work deal specifically with the effect of airport pricing on downstream airline markets, our framework of analysis may be applicable to analysis of any policy affecting costs of FSAs and LCCs including security levies as well as potentially adaptable to other upstream-downstream industry cases. ...|$|E

40|$|An {{essential}} task of {{airport authorities}} is to plan airport facilities that meet future traffic needs in a dynamic and uncertain environment. Major technical difficulties in airport facility development stem from: (1) distinct construction and operating characteristics of different airport components; (2) nonlinear congestion effects affecting most airport facilities; and (3) complex interactions between <b>airport</b> <b>user</b> flows and facilities, {{which means that}} decisions regarding various facilities are interrelated. Potential demand fluctuations in a deregulated aviation market, combined with various other uncertainties, add further dimensions to the airport capacity planning problem. The core of airport facility development {{is to determine the}} timing and sizing of facility expansion projects. The traditional airport master planning has been criticized for its limited ability to cope with future uncertainties. Although there are several general procedures and frameworks for improving the planning flexibility or adaptability in uncertain environments, these macro analyses are considered only conceptually useful and cannot generate detailed plans for implementation. Very few relevant studies are found and all of them focus on a single component (e. g., passenger terminal) or specific facility. However, an airport is a system of many components, which can operate in parallel or in series. In airport development, it is desirable to roughly equalize the capacities of facilities operating in-series. Therefore, the present work is distinguished by the design of global planning models which can coordinate the development of various components under several sources of uncertainties. Due to the intricacy of the airport facility development problem, this dissertation presents a series of applied decision tools sequentially. Practical considerations, such as economies of scale, future cost discounting, nonlinear congestion, and project implementation time requirement, are captured in proposed optimization models which combine the difficulty of optimizing over binary variables and handling nonlinear relations. After examining the structural properties of optimization models, some simplification techniques are proposed, such as the out-approximation and discrete-approximation linearization methods, for enhancing solution efficiency and quality. Computational experiments demonstrate the benefits of such models. For instance, the total cost could be reduced significantly (e. g., by 18. 8 % in one test) with the proposed stochastic model, compared with decisions based on the average conditions. The decision tools developed can augment the airport master planning process in its ability to address future uncertainties. This work also offers methodological contributions in the field of infrastructure development, such as modeling of complex facility performances and a method for coordinating the development of various types of facilities...|$|E
