A common symbol that appears in Nevelson's work is the bride, as seen in Bride of the Black Moon (1955). The symbol of the bride referred to Nevelson's own escape from matrimony in her early life, and her own independence as a woman {{throughout the rest of}} her life. Her Sky Cathedral works often took years to create; Sky Cathedral: Night Wall, {{in the collection of the}} Columbus Museum of Art, took 13 years to build in her New York City studio. On the Sky Cathedral series, Nevelson commented: [...] "This is the Universe, the stars, the moon– <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> everyone." ...|$|E
