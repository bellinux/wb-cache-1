40|$|Abstract. Several Finnish {{projections}} for future electricity demand {{and the need}} for peak load capacity indicate a demand growth of about 2 GW from the present to the year 2030. The retirement of existing fossil fuel plants and old nuclear power plants will cause increased net import needs during 2020 ’s, even when assuming <b>additional</b> <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> measures and the commissioning of two new nuclear power plants recently approved by the Finnish Parliament. By the year 2030, the need for additional new capacity will be about 6 GW. The increased dependence on import is in contradiction with the official Government targets. This situation is not unique to Finland, but rather {{is likely to be the}} case in many other European countries as well. Both the energy company Fortum and energy-intensive industry in Finland see nuclear energy as a viable future generation technology.

40|$|The European Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), a {{cornerstone}} of the EU climate change policy, has entered its second trading period (2008 - 2012). The present design of the ETS has limited impact on certain types of end-use energy efficiency measures. Although promotion of energy efficiency is not {{the objective of the}} EU ETS, its extension to less energy intensive sectors, and the inclusion of fuel use in sectors not covered by the EU ETS at present, could foster energy savings. The paper looks at those features of the current EU ETS that may have unintended or limited effects on additional efforts in end-use energy efficiency, discusses design modifications proposed by the European Commission and explores practical solutions in line with the recent proposal of the Commission for amending Directive 2003 / 87 /EC.

However, the impact of increased energy efficiency on indoor air quality (IAQ) is poorly understood. We conducted a longitudinal study to compare IAQ and occupant comfort in 12 low income single-family homes renovated to a DER or ES standard. Quarterly visits were conducted for a median of 18 months post-renovation; IAQ was assessed in 4 rooms per visit {{for a total of}} 237 measurements. Multivariable regression models accounted for repeated measurements and controlled for house- and family-related covariates. In fully adjusted models, average difference (95 % confidence interval) in IAQ parameters in DER homes versus ES homes were: temperature: − 0. 3  °C (− 1. 2, 0. 6); relative humidity: 0. 4 % (− 1. 1, 1. 8); carbon dioxide: 43. 7  ppm (− 18. 8, 106. 2); and total volatile organic compounds: 198  ppb (− 224, 620).

40|$|Large {{appliances}} {{are major}} power consumers in households of industrialized countries. Although their energy efficiency {{has been increasing}} substantially in past decades, still <b>additional</b> <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> potentials exist. Energy policy that aims at realizing these potentials faces, however, growing concerns about possible adverse effects on commodity prices. Here, we address these concerns by applying the experience curve approach to analyze long-term price and energy efficiency trends of three wet appliances (washing machines, laundry dryers, and dishwashers) and two cold appliances (refrigerators and freezers). We identify a robust long-term decline in both specific price and specific energy consumption of large appliances. Specific prices of wet appliances decline at learning rates (LR) of 29 ± 8 % and thereby much faster than those of cold appliances (LR of 9 ± 4 %). Our results demonstrate that technological learning leads to substantial price decline, thus indicating that the introduction of novel and initially expensive energy efficiency technologies does not necessarily imply adverse price effects in the long term. By extending the conventional experience curve approach, we find a steady decline in the specific energy consumption of wet appliances (LR of 20 – 35 %) and cold appliances (LR of 13 – 17 %). Our analysis suggests that energy policy {{might be able to}} bend down energy experience curves...|$|E

Investment in climate protection will reduce energy consumption {{in the long term}} and shift it towards low or zero carbon energy carriers. Scenarios are implemented in the model PANTA RHEI. Results of more ambitious climate protection measures are positive: Annual gross domestic product will be 25 to 30 billion Euros higher in the ETS compared to the CPS. Positive employment impacts are in the range of 200 thousand <b>additional</b> jobs. <b>Energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> improvements increasingly contribute via reduced energy imports in the long term...|$|R

40|$|As {{part of the}} EU project Energy Efficient Demo Multiresidential {{highrise}} Building (EE-highrise), {{this thesis}} work evaluates and changes the Slovenian Eco Silver House (ESH) high rise building model {{in order to see}} if it can be classifiable as a passive house in different European regions. The purpose of this thesis work was to evaluate if the ESH could meet the European and Swedish passive house classification in Sibernik, Ljubljana, Lund, Östersund, Sundsvall and Kiruna. The purpose was also to make a sensitivity analysis of different energy efficiency measures in the energy performance of the building. This analysis was conducted to understand which of the selected energy efficiency measures made the most significant improvements in the results. The measures included in the sensitivity analysis were the building envelopes wall insulation thickness, changing the window frames, altering the ventilation air duct length and width as well as increasing the air duct insulation thickness. Finally, simulations with solar panels {{on the roof of the}} ESH were carried out. For the European passive house classification, the study involved constructing the model in the Passive House Planning Package (PHPP) and simulating each region and energy efficiency measures separately. PHPP is however made specifically for verifying buildings according to the European passive house standard. So the demands for the Swedish passive house classification cannot be calculated in the PHPP simulations. Because of this, the data available through PHPP was used to manually calculate the Swedish passive house requirements. The results showed that the original ESH model, was only passive house certifiable according to the European classification in Sibernik. When including the <b>additional</b> <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> measures it was possible for the ESH to become passive house certifiable in Lund, Ljubljana and Sibernik. The Swedish passive house classification results suggests that the ESH may be passive house certifiable in Lund. Also, with <b>additional</b> <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> measures the ESH may meet the passive house requirements in Sundsvall and Kiruna. However, all the passive house classification parameters could not be considered in this study. Accordingly, additional analysis are required to draw final conclusions on whether the ESH building could meet the Swedish passive house certification in the different Swedish climate zones. The conclusions drawn were that all the energy efficiency measures contribute to reducing the primary energy demand, heating demand and the heating load. However, these same energy efficiency measures would at the same time increase the cooling demand. Because of this, it was discussed that specific regional models should be made. Because some regional models might benefit from not including the energy efficiency measures used in this thesis at all. They might instead benefit from finding and implementing energy efficiency measures that reduce the cooling demand...|$|E

40|$|The Government has {{identified}} energy efficiency as the fourth ‘major element ’ of its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions mitigation strategy. This note shows how energy efficiency {{has the potential}} to harness larger cost greenhouse gas emissions abatement than through emissions trading in the Government’s Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS). It is likely that some 40 million tonnes of GHG emissions reductions could be achieved each year by 2030 from energy efficiency in the building sector. These figures are based on expected outcomes given the application of well known, tried and tested energy efficiency techniques to the stock of buildings. While not costless, the costs of these measures would be more than offset by the value of energy savings over time.

The authors offer a solution to build adaptive large residential and commercial area with the possibility of achieving cheaper and more competitive construction with the same gain (profit) in relation to the set of the classic construction and a high selling price. If you require the ability to achieve high capacity with longer spans, less weight and less prone to earthquakes, you can easily come to the conclusion that light grate cluster AB boards have an advantage over other solutions for building floor slabs. Excitation due to possible levelling of supports or torsion rotation of the object is practically possible.

Unfortunately, society’s reliance on fossil fuel for power generation has occurred {{at the expense of the}} environment, coal being a major contribution to carbon dioxide (CO 2) emission. Carbon dioxide is classified as a greenhouse gas (GHG); it contributes to the phenomenon of climate change (Haw & Hughes, 2007, p. 1). According to Worrell (2011), industry uses nearly 40 percent of worldwide energy on economic activities. Value chain activities alone contribute almost 37 percent to global GHG. Organisations are socially and ethically required to minimise the carbon footprint of their operations. Reducing energy use makes perfect business sense; it saves money, enhances corporate reputations and helps everyone participate the fight against climate change (Carbon Trust, 2011). Gielen, Newman, and Patel (2008) strongly believe the overall energy and emissions trends can be mitigated through <b>additional</b> <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> measures. However, implementing EnMS will enable organisations to establish systematic approaches and the processes necessary to improve energy performance, including energy efficiency, use and consumption (SANS 50001, 2011). The objective of this paper was to evaluate the current energy management strategy adopted by selected automotive manufacture in Eastern Cape. The research was motivated by the fact that previous researchers have focused more on technological aspects and less of management functions. The research paradigm followed in this paper was qualitative because a case study is used to gain an insight and understanding about more and less successful energy management strategies. In this report, background about the global energy outlook and its significant to economic development, factors behind energy demands, the link to climate change and providing effective energy management principles are covered. The energy management principles covered key elements for delivering successful energy management. Literature highlighted that, senior management commitment is the foundation of good energy management, which is delivered through a formal energy policy and a supporting energy strategy with action plan. High level commitment will provide: • Advocacy from senior managers • Visibility of the issues across your organisation • Impetus for the organisation to implement energy management • Resources, both human and financial. It will also demonstrate that good energy management is part of your organisation’s mission and as relevant as other management aspects. The empirical study is focused on the characteristics of the current management system and organisational structure employed with its relevant functions. Based on these reference points the paper concludes with recommendations for the case study organisation...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a part of the major EU project EE-Highrise which {{is a part}} of the European 7 th Framework Research Program (FP 7 -ENERGY). In order to {{demonstrate}} and test new technologies and concepts, a demo building has been constructed in Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia. The approach during the development of the building has been to consider all its elements with the purpose to increase the energy efficiency and sustainability of the building. Umeå University’s objective is to develop regional specific models of the demo high-rise building. The objective of this thesis is to evaluate whether a simplified model of the high rise building, Eco Silver House, can meet the passive house classifications in four selected cities; Ljubljana, Sibenik, Umeå and Dubai and then to suggest improvements of the models for the different regions. Drawings of the building were provided along with an IFC file for construction of the model in PHPP. The simulation tool used for simulations, PHPP, contained all necessary tools for designing a properly functioning Passive House. By preparing an energy balance, the annual energy demand of the building was calculated based on input related to building characteristics. Results from the simulations have then been compared to the requirements for the German Passive House classification. The performance of the building in Umeå has also be compared to the Swedish passive house standards. Improvements to the climate shell and the ventilation system were after that examined depending on the results. It was shown that it is possible to construct regional specific models that fulfill the passive house requirements in three of four regions. The model achieved passive house standard without any <b>additional</b> <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> measures in Ljubljana and Šibenik while a combination of measures was needed to fulfill all the criteria’s in Umeå. The Swedish requirements used for evaluation of the model in Sweden were easier to fulfill since they have been developed for the cold climate present in Umeå. Since no regional passive house classification was used to evaluate the performance of the model in Dubai the cooling and primary energy demand exceeded the limiting criteria’s. The energy efficiency measure with reduced window area had the greatest impact on heating and cooling demand in all climates. This measure should be included in all future models which also is suggested by parallel studies on similar models of the same building. The only climate where an increased U-value of the external envelope resulted in improved performance of the model was in Šibenik. For all the other climates where a lowered U-value was implemented did the overall performance improve. EE-Highrise (European 7 th Framework Research Program...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} {{between public and private}} sector efforts to optimise <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> finance initiatives in an emerging country context, using Thailand as a case study. Demand-side <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> measures could significantly reduce pressures on energy systems in emerging economies in Southeast Asia {{while at the same time}} reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Rapidly increasing energy needs, combined with dependence on fossil fuel imports have put energy systems in the region under pressure. Due to high urbanisation growth rates, and comparatively inefficient industries, demand-side <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> measures could be part of the solution. The lack of external <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> finance for industry and building owners is a major barrier, but reports and country examples contain mixed messages about how to best overcome this challenge. The dominant discourse around <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> finance originates from international organisations who advocate for the public sector to focus all efforts on maximising private sector investments. However, developed country experience and some emerging country examples, suggest that the problem is more complex. Therefore, this thesis focuses on how to optimise <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> finance. Thailand serves as a case study due to the range of <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> initiatives designed and implemented in that country since the early 1990 s. Transition studies and Multi-Level Perspective, were chosen as the theoretical framework and heuristic tool for the analysis. Qualitative data in the form of interviews with forty-eight experts from government, the private sector and academia form the core of this research. The research found that in Thailand, after more than 10 years of public sector support for <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> finance initiatives, success in the private sector has been limited. Challenges identified include: (1) a lack of de-risking measures (2) renewable energy projects receiving most funding; (3) lack of guidance from the Central Bank of Thailand and (4) missing cross-coordination with relevant ministries to create <b>additional</b> demand for <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> finance services. Suggestions for next steps are provided. The main finding from this research is that EEF in an emerging country context will never be transitioned 100 % to the private sector, but will be reliant on long-term consistent support from the public sector. Policy makers and international organisations must therefore carefully evaluate the existing framework conditions before choosing which <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> finance initiatives to support. The Multi-Level Perspective analytical framework could provide such an analytical tool to further unleash the <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> potential in Southeast Asia...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. As the nodes {{have limited}} battery power in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> and fault {{tolerance}} {{should be the}} two major issues in designing WSNs. However, previous studies on positioning base stations (BSs) in WSNs are focused on <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> only. Yet, mission-critical applications like emergency medical care systems should be guaranteed continuous services considering fault tolerance. In this paper we propose to place multiple BSs considering not only <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> but also fault tolerance. We present two strategies to find the optimal position of BSs; (1) minimizing the average transmission energy for energy efficiency; and (2) minimizing <b>additional</b> <b>energy</b> consumption after a BS failure for fault tolerance. The optimal positions for multiple BSs are derived by the metric that considers both <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> and fault tolerance, with a weight factor. Our simulation results show that fault tolerance is important and strongly related to elongation of network lifetime. In addition, we show that our proposed scheme is more energy-effective than previously suggested strategies on unexpected environmental changes which occur commonly in WSNs and sustain the network lifetime effectively under BS failures. ...|$|R
40|$|Improvements in {{technology}} certainly play {{a pivotal role}} in the quest for increased <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency.</b> However, sophisticated industrial energy users are increasingly learning that technology alone cannot drive long-term, sustainable reductions in energy cost. The role of people within an organization {{is just as important as}} technology. In fact, as companies continue to improve their <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> technology, and their production processes, the role of people, and the management approach they are engaged in, takes on an increasingly prominent role in driving <b>additional</b> <b>energy</b> management improvements. This paper will highlight how instituting a systematic approach to the people, or management aspect of energy management, can help ensure that a company first of all undertakes the most beneficial and cost effective technology improvements, and that the benefits of those improvements are, in fact, achieved. Moreover, the paper will demonstrate how such a systematic approach can help identify improvements in <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> that require little or no capital investment, and can lay the groundwork for building on initial <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> improvements in order to achieve long-term, continuous improvement in energy management results...|$|R
