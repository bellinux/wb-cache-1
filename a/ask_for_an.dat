5|$|Although {{they failed}} to achieve their objectives, by nightfall the ANZACs had formed a beachhead, albeit much smaller than intended. In places they were {{clinging}} onto cliff faces with no organised defence system. Their precarious position convinced both divisional commanders to <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> evacuation, but after taking advice from the Royal Navy about how practicable that would be, the army commander decided they would stay. The exact number of the day's casualties is not known. The ANZACs had landed two divisions but over two thousand of their men had been killed or wounded, together {{with at least a}} similar number of Turkish casualties.|$|E
5|$|For the new attack, Nelson was to {{take three}} ships of the line, three frigates, {{including}} Emerald, and 200 marines, for an amphibious landing outside the Spanish stronghold. The frigates would then engage the batteries to the north-east of Santa Cruz while the marines stormed the town. However, a combination of strong currents and heavy Spanish fire forced the British to abandon the attack. Several further attempts were made between 22 and 25 July; although the British were able to land troops, Spanish resistance was too strong and the British had to <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> honourable withdrawal.|$|E
5000|$|In {{some rules}} of Marjapussi, {{the options for}} declaring marriages are ordered: Self-declaring comes first, <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> whole comes second, and <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> half comes last. In your first opportunity, you are allowed to choose freely which {{alternative}} you use, {{but you are not}} allowed to self-declare after you have <b>asked</b> either <b>for</b> <b>a</b> whole or a half, and you are not allowed to <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> whole after you have <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> half. The restrictions apply only per hand, and start of a new hand nullifies the restrictions. In some variants, a team that has not <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> whole is not allowed to <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> half.|$|R

If the husband <b>asks</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> divorce and intercourse has occurred, he pays full mahr; if the husband <b>asks</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> divorce and the intercourse has not occurred, the husband pays half the dower; if the wife <b>asks</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> divorce and intercourse has occurred, the husband pays half the mahr; and if the wife <b>asks</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> divorce and is still an intercourse has not occurred, then no mahr is required to be paid by the husband.|$|R
5|$|Under those chaotic {{circumstances}} a Bulgarian delegation {{arrived in}} Thessaloniki to <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> armistice. On 29 September, the Bulgarians were granted the Armistice of Salonica by General d'Esperey. The Bulgarian downfall turned the strategic and operational {{balance of the}} war against the Central Powers. The Macedonian Front was brought to an end at noon on 30 September, when the ceasefire came into effect, and the Radomir Rebellion was put down, by Bulgarian forces, as of the 2 October. Tsar Ferdinand I of Bulgaria abdicated and went into exile the following day.|$|E
5|$|The Ottoman Turkish Empire {{entered the}} First World War {{on the side}} of the Central Powers on 31 October 1914. The {{stalemate}} of trench warfare on the Western Front convinced the British Imperial War Cabinet that an attack on the Central Powers elsewhere, particularly Turkey, could be the best way of winning the war. From February 1915 this took the form of naval operations aimed at forcing a passage through the Dardanelles, but after several setbacks it was decided that a land campaign was also necessary. To that end, the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force was formed under the command of General Ian Hamilton. Three amphibious landings were planned to secure the Gallipoli Peninsula, which would allow the navy to attack the Turkish capital Constantinople, in the hope that would convince the Turks to <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> armistice.|$|E
5|$|The final {{demobilisation}} plan assigned differing {{scales of}} points for service men and women. Service men were allocated two points {{for each year}} of age based on their age at enlistment and a further two points for each month of service {{if they did not}} have dependent children or three points if they did. Service women received three points for each year of age at enlistment and a point for each month of service. Women with children were given priority for demobilisation, followed by those who had married {{before the end of the}} war. Service women who married after the war could <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> early discharge on compassionate grounds. Men were also eligible for early discharge on compassionate or health grounds, if they had skills which were important to the Australian economy or had been accepted into a full-time training course.|$|E

25|$|Some logical {{systems are}} not {{adequately}} represented by the set of theorems alone. (For example, Kleene's logic has no theorems at all.) In such cases, alternative definitions of decidability of a logical system are often used, which <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> effective method for determining something more general than just validity of formulas; for instance, validity of sequents, or the consequence relation {(Г, A) | Г ⊧ A} of the logic.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{etymology}} {{states that}} michelada is a portmanteau of mi chela helada. The word chela is <b>a</b> popular term <b>for</b> <b>a</b> beer in Mexico.

25|$|Discouraged by his cabinet's hostile {{reaction}} to a British proposal to unite France and Britain to avoid defeat, and believing that his ministers no longer supported him, Reynaud resigned on 16 June. He was succeeded by Marshal of France Philippe Pétain, who delivered a radio address to the French people announcing his intention to <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> armistice with Germany.

25|$|In foreign policy, Johnson {{escalated}} American {{involvement in}} the Vietnam War. In 1964, Congress passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which granted Johnson the power {{to use military force}} in Southeast Asia without having to <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> official declaration of war. The number of American military personnel in Vietnam increased dramatically, from 16,000 advisors in non-combat roles in 1963 to 525,000 in 1967, many in combat roles. American casualties soared and the peace process bogged down. Growing unease with the war stimulated a large, angry antiwar movement based especially on university campuses.|$|E

25|$|By November 2008 most {{hardware}} and software development was complete, and testing continued. At this point, cost overruns were approximately $400 million. In the attempts to meet the launch date, several instruments and a cache for samples were removed and other instruments and cameras were simplified to simplify testing and integration of the rover. The next month, NASA delayed the launch to late 2011 because of inadequate testing time. Eventually the costs for developing the rover reached $2.47 billion, that for a rover that initially had been classified as a medium-cost mission with a maximum budget of $650 million, yet NASA still had to <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> additional $82 million to meet the planned November launch.|$|E

The men then asked Royal Marine Lieutenant Scott to intercede for them. When Scott presented a petition to Captain Herbert on behalf of the men, Herbert had Scott arrested. The captain then explained to the crew that he did not know how long it would be until they could leave the island, and then read them the Articles of War. The next day the captain increased the water ration by one pint per man.|$|E

25|$|In 2000, the Israel Supreme Court {{upheld the}} right of the Rishon LeZion Orchestra to perform Wagner's Siegfried Idyll. At the Israel Festival in Jerusalem in July 2001, Barenboim had {{scheduled}} to perform the first act of Die Walküre with three singers, including tenor Plácido Domingo. However, strong protests by some Holocaust survivors, as well as the Israeli government, led the festival authorities to <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> alternative program. (The Israel Festival's Public Advisory board, which included some Holocaust survivors, had originally approved the program.) The controversy appeared to end in May, after the Israel Festival announced that a selection by Wagner would not be included at the 7 July concert. Barenboim agreed to substitute music by Schumann and Stravinsky.|$|E
25|$|On 24 October, the Italians began a {{push that}} rapidly {{recovered}} territory lost after the Battle of Caporetto. This {{culminated in the}} Battle of Vittorio Veneto, which {{marked the end of}} the Austro-Hungarian Army as an effective fighting force. The offensive also triggered the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. During the last week of October, declarations of independence were made in Budapest, Prague, and Zagreb. On 29 October, the imperial authorities asked Italy for an armistice, but the Italians continued advancing, reaching Trento, Udine, and Trieste. On 3 November, Austria-Hungary sent a flag of truce to <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> armistice (Armistice of Villa Giusti). The terms, arranged by telegraph with the Allied Authorities in Paris, were communicated to the Austrian commander and accepted. The Armistice with Austria was signed in the Villa Giusti, near Padua, on 3 November. Austria and Hungary signed separate armistices following the overthrow of the Habsburg Monarchy. In the following days the Italian Army occupied Innsbruck and all Tyrol with 20 to 22,000 soldiers.|$|E
25|$|Porter met up {{with the}} van after Goodson called dispatchers to <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> officer to come check on Gray. He was {{requested}} twice by Gray for a medic, but did not call for one. He was charged with involuntary manslaughter; second degree assault; misconduct in office. Porter posted a 350,000 bail. The grand jury indicted Porter on all charges and added an indictment of reckless endangerment. On December 16, 2015, a mistrial was declared on all charges, after the jury was hung and could not come to a decision. Porter's second trial was scheduled for June 13, 2016. Analysts stated that the Porter's retrial could have caused problems for the other trials, under the presumption {{that he could not}} be compelled to testify while there are pending charges against him. After several appeals and reversals, the Maryland Court of Appeals ruled that Porter would be required to testify in the cases against the other officers. Officer Porter's retrial date was originally scheduled for September 6, 2016. On July 27, 2016, all charges against him were dropped.|$|E
