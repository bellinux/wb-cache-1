5000|$|Real or Fake: Studies in Authentication {{draws on}} Nickell's earlier {{works for the}} {{technicalities}} <b>of</b> <b>paper,</b> ink, typefaces, pens, and other keys to determining <b>authenticity</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> documents. New material details the step-by-step investigations of specific cases—the diary of Jack the Ripper (fake), the Bondwoman's Narrative (date authenticated, author unknown), Lincoln's Lost Gettysburg Address (fake), and An Outlaw's Scribblings (fake). Nickell described a typical analysis: I decided to test the brown ink of the [...] "Bonney" [...] writing on page 10 of the album, lifting a sample onto chromatography paper dampened with distilled water. It transferred surprisingly easily (and thus suspiciously) and tested negative for iron (using hydrochloric acid digestion followed by potassium ferrocyanide reagent). The ink thus had {{the characteristics of a}} brown-colored ink and not a black-colored ink that had turned brown with age through oxidation. The availability of a brown-colored ink in 1881—especially on the western frontier—seems very unlikely. It could well be that the forger used brown ink to avoid the difficulty of having to artificially age an iron ink and thus transform it from black to brown.|$|R

50|$|The {{argument}} is that Gauden had prepared the book to inspire sympathy with the king by a representation of his pious and forgiving disposition, and so to rouse public opinion against his execution. In 1693 further correspondence between Gauden, Clarendon, the Duke of York (later James II & VII, and Sir Edward Nicholas was published by Arthur North, who had found them among the <b>papers</b> <b>of</b> his sister-in-law, a daughter-in-law of Bishop Gauden; but doubt has been thrown on the <b>authenticity</b> <b>of</b> these <b>papers.</b> Gauden stated that he had begun the book in 1647 and was entirely responsible for it.

40|$|Contemporary {{historical}} preservation practice includes olfactory preservation as {{an experimental}} method of architectural preservation. The implementation of manufactured scents in historic buildings raises important issues <b>of</b> <b>authenticity.</b> This <b>paper</b> focuses on three important {{issues in the}} relation between olfactory preservation and authenticity: the importance of phenomenology in memory evocation; the relative character <b>of</b> the <b>authenticity</b> concept; and the significance of social values in historic preservation. This requires a critical examination of charters, documents and theoretical interpretations which reflect a broader concept <b>of</b> <b>authenticity.</b> The <b>paper</b> discusses certain articles of the Venice Charter, the Nara Document on Authenticity, {{as well as the}} sense of smell in architectural experience through critical analysis of the theories of John Ruskin, Viollet-le-Duc, Roger Scruton and Juhani Pallasmaa and their concepts <b>of</b> <b>authenticity.</b> Authenticity issues are illustrated by the examples of olfactory preservation: olfactory reconstruction of Philip Johnson’s Glass House; interior restoration and olfactory reconstruction of the Arts Club in Mayfair, London; and the creation process of the perfume brand Arquiste, a meaningful example which relocates the olfactory reconstruction context. These critical analyses raise the question of scent in historic buildings as a value in itself...|$|R
25|$|Although the Shakespeare papers had {{prominent}} believers (including James Boswell), sceptics had questioned their authenticity {{from the}} beginning, {{and as the}} premiere of Vortigern approached, the press was filled with arguments over whether the papers were genuine or forgeries. On 31 March 1796, Shakespearean scholar Edmond Malone published his own exhaustive study, An Inquiry into the <b>Authenticity</b> <b>of</b> Certain Miscellaneous <b>Papers</b> and Legal Instruments, about the supposed papers. His attack on the papers, stretching to more than 400 densely printed pages, showed convincingly that the papers could be nothing other than modern forgeries. Although believers tried to hold their ground, scholars were convinced by Malone's arguments.|$|R

In February 1795 however he issued a general invitation to literary men to come to his house and examine them. The exhibition was a roaring success. Samuel Parr and Joseph Warton on hearing Samuel Ireland read the [...] "Profession of Faith" [...] proclaimed it superior to anything in the English liturgy. James Boswell got down on his knees to kiss the relics.

After reading the play, Sheridan noted its relative simplicity compared to Shakespeares known works. Actor John Philip Kemble, the manager of Drury Lane, and who would play the title role in the plays only production, had serious doubts about Vortigerns authenticity. Sarah Siddons, who had been cast as the title female role, dropped out one week before the scheduled opening for unknown reasons, though it is suspected that Kemble had successfully turned the famous actress against the work as well.

60|$|The <b>authenticity</b> <b>of</b> this <b>paper</b> {{has been}} questioned. It has been said, {{that there was}} no {{probability}} of Columbus having resort to a usage with which he was, most likely, unacquainted. The objections are not cogent. Columbus was accustomed to the peculiarities of a military life, and he repeatedly wrote letters, in critical moments, as a precaution against some fatal occurrence that seemed to impend. The present codicil, from its date, must have been written a few days previous to his death, perhaps at a moment when he imagined himself at extremity. This may account for any difference in the handwriting, especially as he was, at times, so affected by the gout in his hands as {{not to be able to}} write except at night. Particular stress has been laid on the signature; but it does not appear that he was uniform in regard to that, and it is a point to which any one who attempted a forgery would be attentive. It does not appear, likewise, that any advantage could have been obtained by forging the paper, or that any such was attempted.|$|R

The challenges facing remote area tourism are described, and two case studies are presented. The first is concerned with the 2 ̆ 7 special interest 2 ̆ 7 activity of bird watching and the second with the more general interest international backpacker market. A review of previous research into these markets suggests that the tourist will seek out remote area destinations where the experiential outcomes are not substitutable, are specific (as opposed to general) in nature and relate to the unique qualities of the setting. In other cases, the costs of remote area travel outweigh the perceived value <b>of</b> <b>authenticity.</b> The <b>paper</b> introduces the concept of 2 ̆ 7 comparative authenticity 2 ̆ 7 as a way of understanding the role authenticity plays in destination selection. Remote area tourism destinations are more likely to find competitive advantage in special interest tourism markets that are less willing to trade the <b>authenticity</b> <b>of</b> a setting for reduced travel costs...|$|R

40|$|Chinese {{calligraphy}} is a Chinese traditional cultural symbol, {{acting as}} an art form unifying literature, history, and painting. Calligraphic landscapes are common attractions in China 2 ̆ 7 s tourism destinations.

A confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling were performed using LISREL 8. 51. This research concludes that public ignorance of traditional culture affects perceptions <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> and leads tourists to attribute importance to the aesthetics and form of the objective material, rather than to focus on the inner experience found in the traditional Chinese calligraphic arts. Thus tourists remain stuck in the shallow level of heritage and cultural tourism experiences.
