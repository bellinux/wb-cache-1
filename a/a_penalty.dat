2500|$|The {{team of the}} {{offending}} player must choose a substitute player to place in the box {{from any of the}} eligible players, excluding the goaltender [...] The substitute serves <b>a</b> five-minute <b>penalty</b> similar to <b>a</b> major <b>penalty</b> (except in overtime, goals scored against the penalized team do not end the penalty early).
