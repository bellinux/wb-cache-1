40|$|This article {{studies the}} optimal use of fines and {{imprisonment}} when an offender’’s level of wealth is private information that cannot {{be observed by the}} enforcement authority. In {{a model in}} which there are two levels of wealth, I derive the optimal mix of sanctions, including the imprisonment sentence imposed on offenders who do not pay the fine – referred to as the “alternative” imprisonment sentence. Among other things, I demonstrate that if imprisonment sanctions are used, the optimal <b>alternative</b> <b>imprisonment</b> sentence is sufficiently high that high-wealth individuals prefer to pay a fine exceeding the wealth level of low-wealth individuals and bear a lower (possibly no) imprisonment sentence rather than to pretend to be low-wealth individuals. I also show that if the optimal enforcement system would rely exclusively on fines when wealth is observable, the inability to observe wealth is detrimental because higher fines then could not be levied on higher-wealth individuals. In this case, it may be desirable when wealth is unobservable to impose an imprisonment sentence on offenders who do not pay the fine – who will be low-wealth offenders – in order to induce high-wealth offenders to pay the fine. However, if the optimal enforcement system would employ both fines and imprisonment sentences when wealth is observable, the inability to observ...|$|E
40|$|In this {{contribution}} {{a number}} of procedural issues related to sentencing of child offenders, and emanating from the Child Justice Act 75 of 2008, is considered in some detail. As a general rule, the Act requires pre-sentence reports to be obtained from probation officers before sentencing any child offender, with {{only a limited number}} of exceptions. The article argues that the peremptory nature of the Act means that a probation report is always required, even if reports by other experts might also be available. The exceptions are limited to instances other than those where the child offender is sentenced to any form of imprisonment or to residence in a care centre. The article addresses the question whether the reference to imprisonment includes <b>alternative</b> <b>imprisonment,</b> which is imposed only as an alternative to a fine. It suggests that <b>alternative</b> <b>imprisonment</b> should, generally, not be imposed on child offenders. When an exception is not prevented because of the sentence, a pre-sentence report may be dispensed with only when the offence is a schedule- 1 offence (the least serious offences) or when obtaining a report would prejudice the child. It is argued that these exceptions are likely to be rather rare events. A final aspect of the Act’s provisions on pre-sentence reports is to require that reasons be given for a departure from the recommendations in a pre-sentence report: this requirement merely confirms the status quo. The Act permits the prosecutor to provide the court with a victim impact statement. Such a statement is defined in the Act: it is a sworn statement, by a victim or someone authorised by the victim, explaining the consequences of the crime on the victim. The article also addresses the issue whether the child justice court might mero motu obtain a victim impact statement, when the prosecution does not do so. Finally, the article addresses appeals against and reviews of the trial courts’ sentences. It notes that appeal by the child offender is made somewhat easier, as some child offenders need not obtain leave to appeal. These include children under the age of 16, or older children who had been sentenced to imprisonment. Again, the meaning of “imprisonment” is at least somewhat ambiguous. The provisions on automatic review have attracted considerable judicial attention already. The majority of these judgments confirmed the apparently clear wording of the Act, in terms of which the cases of all child offenders under the age of 16 should be reviewed, regardless whether they had been legally represented, or of the sentence imposed. In the case of child offenders aged 16 or 17, only custodial sentences are reviewable. The judgments which found this to be an incorrect interpretation are dealt with in some detail, with the conclusion that they have been incorrectly decided. Criminal and Procedural La...|$|E

Author tried to present proposals based on studying literature, laws, judicial decisions and comparison with foreign legislations, which could lead to improving Czech legal regulation in this area. The thesis is composed of 8 chapters. In the introductory chapter readers are informed about content of the thesis, purpose of the thesis and methods used. Next three chapters deal with topics related to the purpose and functions of punishment, the benefits of <b>alternatives</b> to <b>imprisonment</b> and factors, which counteract against the efforts to reduce prison population. Author deemed necessary to analyze purpose of punishment, before he examined specific alternatives.

40|$|Many jurisdictions have {{introduced}} other non-custodial measures {{to decrease the}} usage of fines, nevertheless they are still a popular sanction. Although the majority of offenders fined pay their fine, some are {{unable or unwilling to}} do so and as a consequence can be imprisoned. At a time when prisons are overcrowded and short term sentences are a substantial administrative endeavour, with little to no re-socializing potential, many jurisdictions have implemented other measures to prevent imprisonment for fine default such as unpaid work. Both Austria and Scotland have implemented the possibility of unpaid work as an <b>alternative</b> to <b>imprisonment</b> for fine default. While Scotland has almost 20 years of experience, Austria has just recently implemented the option of community work for fine defaulters in 2008. This article examines the experience of unpaid work as an <b>alternative</b> to <b>imprisonment</b> for fine default in these two contrasting jurisdictions and discusses the key differences between them. It considers whether the implementation of unpaid work as an <b>alternative</b> to <b>imprisonment</b> for fine default in each jurisdiction fulfilled the original policy intentions and what wider lessons can be learned from their experiences of unpaid work for offenders who fail to pay their fines...|$|R

However, its implementation as an alternative sentence is currently proceeding at a slow pace. The Ugandan law still allows courts to exercise their discretionary powers with regard to either using prison sentences or community service. Courts still seem to prefer to use imprisonment irrespective of the nature of the offence, thus leading to unwarranted government expenditure and prison overcrowding. An additional problem is that some offenders come out of prison having been negatively affected by their interaction with even more serious offenders.
