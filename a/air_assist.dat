40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} laser {{machining}} of silicon wafer at various process parameters. The {{objective of this}} thesis is to investigate the effect of laser machining parameters on the cut surface quality and determine the feasible laser machining parameters that can machine silicon wafer. The thesis describes how machining parameters and <b>air</b> <b>assist</b> gas affects cut surface quality. The silicon wafer was machined by laser with and without air assists. Principally, two experimental sets with different cutting speed and laser power were designed in statistical software. The kerf widths and quality were observed under microscopes. The results then were analyzed using statistica software. The analysis indicated that cutting speed has significant effect to the kerf width and laser cutting with air assists produced wider kerf. Result obtained also showed that laser cutting without air assists produced better cut surface quality. The feasible machining parameter of silicon is estimated at 1. 0 - 2. 0 mm/min for cutting velocity, 0. 80 - 0. 94 watt for laser power in laser cutting without <b>air</b> <b>assist</b> and 1. 0 - 4. 0 mm/min for cutting velocity, 0. 80 - 0. 90 watt for laser power in laser cutting with <b>air</b> <b>assist...</b>|$|E

40|$|Detailed {{measurements}} of mean drop size (SMD) and size distribution parameters {{have been made}} using a Fraunhofer diffraction particle sizing instrument {{in a series of}} sprays generated by an <b>air</b> <b>assist</b> swirl atomizer. Thirty-six different combinations of fuel and air mass flow rates were examined with liquid flow rates up to 14 lbm/hr and atomizing air flow rates up to 10 lbm/hr. Linear relationships were found between SMD and liquid to air mass flow rate ratios. SMD increased with distance downstream along the center line and also with radial distance from the axis. Increase in obscuration with distance downstream was due to an increase in number density of particles as the result of deceleration of drops and an increase in the exposed path length of the laser beam.

40|$|ReportThe {{goals of}} this project were to {{identify}} equipment that maximizes spray coverage {{on the underside of}} leaves of cucurbits and to determine if powdery mildew can be controlled effectively with nonsystemic fungicides when coverage is maximized. Conventional nozzles and sprayers deliver little spray material to the underside of leaves. Thus systemic fungicides are currently essential for controlling powdery mildew in cucurbits. Fungicide resistance is a major concern because systemic fungicides are at-risk for resistance development due to their single-site mode of action and because the powdery mildew fungus has demonstrated high potential for developing resistance. Organic growers would also benefit from identification of a means to improve spray deposition as there are no systemic fungicides approved for organic production. The contact fungicide Bravo was applied using an <b>air</b> <b>assist</b> sprayer and using two novel nozzles (twin jet and air induction) and three traditional nozzles (flat fan, hollow cone, and cone jet) on a conventional boom.

40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} to evolve and evaluate a premixing-prevaporizing fuel system {{to be used with}} a catalytic combustor for possible application in an automotive gas turbine. Spatial fuel distribution and degree of vaporization were measured using Jet A fuel. Three types of air blast injectors, an <b>air</b> <b>assist</b> nozzle and a simplex pressure atomizer were tested. Air swirlers with vane angles up to 30 deg were used to improve the spatial fuel distribution. The work was done in a 12 -cm (4. 75 -in.) diameter tubular rig.

Complete vaporization of the fuel was achieved with air blast configurations at inlet air temperatures of 550 K (530 F) and higher.

40|$|Apples at 24 ± 2 °C were heated in a {{pilot scale}} hot <b>air</b> <b>assisted</b> (40 °C) {{continuous}} pentagonal microwave system, {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of this treatment on insect mortality (variety Mutsu) and fruit quality (variety Granny Smith). An average temperature of 53. 4 ± 1. 3 °C at core, bottom and flesh of the apple was recorded at the end of the treatment. One hundred percent mortality of the most tolerant stage of Queensland fruit fly (Bactrocera tryoni, Froggatt) and Jarvis's fruit fly (Bactrocera jarvisi, Tryon), were observed when the Mortality value (M 52, equivalent time of isothermal treatment at 52 °C) at the slowest heating point applicable for each experiment was ≥ 50 min and ≥ 37 min, respectively. Results showed that microwave heat treatment is effective for insect disinfestation without any adverse impact on total soluble solids, flesh or peel firmness of the treated apples. The treated apples recorded a significantly higher pH and lower ion leakage than the untreated apples after 3 or 4 weeks. Therefore, the microwave heat treatment has the potential to be developed as an alternative chemical free quarantine treatment against economically significant insect pests. Industrial relevance Hot <b>air</b> <b>assisted</b> microwave heating of fruits and vegetables, is more cost effective compared to vapour heat treatment and ionising radiation for disinfestation of insects.

40|$|In {{order to}} meet {{increasingly}} strict environmental regulations and to promote cleaner energy at their facilities, many oil, gas, and petrochemical companies are seeking to upgrade existing flares to allow smokeless flaring of hydrocarbon gases. The main areas of application for these flare upgrades are located in Russia, Africa, Middle East, South America, and other countries with high oil production capabilities and programs. Many of these areas have utility flares located in facilities where a shortage of steam or water prevents conventional smokeless steam-injection systems from being added.

The configuration consisted of a research air-assist atomizer located in the center surrounded by a coflowing air stream. Both the <b>air</b> <b>assist</b> and coflow streams had swirl imparted to them in the same direction with 45 degree angle swirlers. The fuel and air entered the combustor at ambient temperature and the combustor was operated in an unconfined environment.

Velocity measurements for the gas phase are reported for both an isothermal, single-phase case without drops and a reacting spray case at axial distances from 2. 5 to 350 mm downstream of the nozzle. Both mean and fluctuating values are reported. Heptane fuel was used for all the experiments. Drop size and velocity, and drop number flux are also reported for five axial distances downstream. Both mean and fluctuating values are reported for the drops. The measurements were performed using a two-component phase/Doppler particle analyzer.

Neat VX challenge aerosols were generated by feeding micro-liter quantities of agent from a loaded syringe to a custom-made <b>air</b> <b>assist</b> atomizer. Exposure concentrations were assessed by both real-time aerosol monitor and gas chromatograph analysis of chamber filter pack samples. Exposures were run for 10 minutes in duration with 4 animals per test. An “up and down ” paradigm was used to sequentially select target agent concentration levels from one exposure run to the next based on the resulting 24 hour lethality fraction. Chamber sampling results indicated that over the concentration range tested, the agent existed primarily in the aerosol phase most likely because of the brief transit time between the atomizer and the chamber exposure ports which did not allow sufficient time for vapor equilibration. The resulting LCt 50 for neat VX aerosol in the mouse via the inhalation route was significantly lower than anticipated based on another recent nose-only study in which mice were challenged with saline aerosols laced with VX. Overall our results indicate that the LCt 50 for VX aerosol in the mouse via the nose-only exposure method is comparable to previously reported values for head only and whole body exposures under conditions of vapor and aerosol challenge...|$|E
