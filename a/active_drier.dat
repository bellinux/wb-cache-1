50|$|Instant yeast appears {{similar to}} <b>active</b> <b>dry</b> yeast, but has smaller {{granules}} with substantially higher percentages of live cells per comparable unit volumes. It is more perishable than <b>active</b> <b>dry</b> yeast but {{also does not}} require rehydration, and can usually be added directly to all but the driest doughs. In general, instant yeast has {{a small amount of}} ascorbic acid added as a preservative. Some producers provide specific variants for doughs with high sugar contents, and such yeasts are more generally known as osmotolerant yeasts.|$|R
30|$|Drying of raw biomass {{prior to}} {{combustion}} or gasification can increase power production efficiency between 3 and 5 %, {{depending on the}} drying method and the initial moisture content of the biomass (McIlveen-Wright et al., 2001; Spets & Ahtila, 2002). That may justify heating raw wood fuels {{in order to obtain}} rapid <b>active</b> <b>drying</b> (Johansson et al. 1997). <b>Active</b> <b>drying</b> is also {{the most effective way to}} bring moisture content below fibre saturation point, which typically occurs at a moisture content around 20 - 25 % (Walker 2006). However, conventional <b>active</b> <b>drying</b> may incur significant energy and financial cost (Ragavhan et al. 2005), and may lead to the release of harmful volatile compounds (Rupar and Sanati 2003). Hence the recurring interest for more effective techniques, such as multi-stage drying (Holmberg and Ahtila 2004), solar convection (Reuss et al. 1997) and mechanical drying (Yoshida et al. 2010). All try to make a less intense use of external inputs, to save on energy and cost.|$|R
40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the 1980 ’s, the use of <b>active</b> <b>dried</b> Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast starters has been extensively generalised. Today, the majority of wine production is based on the use of <b>active</b> <b>dried</b> yeast, which ensures rapid and reliable fermentations. The behaviour of these yeasts in the ecosystem of the vineyard is totally unknown as is their potential impact on the natural microflora. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate populational structures among fermenting S. cerevisiae populations and to assess the impact of <b>active</b> <b>dry</b> yeast usage on the genetic structures of the vineyard microflora. Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolates were obtained from fermentations with grapes from three vineyards of the Vinho Verde Region where commercial yeast strains were used continuously during the last years. Populational genetic analysis was based on six polymorphic microsatellite loci in 361 isolates. Accumulation of small allele-frequency differences across six loci in groups of strains allowed the identification of populational structures. The continuous use of <b>active</b> <b>dry</b> yeast has a very limited impact on the genetic structure of the vineyard microflora. Correlation of genetic differentiation with the distance between sampling points suggested a pattern of isolation-by-distance, where genetic divergence in a vineyard increased with size.

40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of the influence of different methods of primary fermentation of the vine musts on the analytical and sensoric parameters of the wines produced. For this goal different wine samples were produced using <b>active</b> <b>dry</b> wine yeast fermentation, spontaneous fermentation and fermentation with prepared ferment that contained original cultured yeast from local wine yard. The wines were produced from three vine varieties from year 2012 and 2013. The analytical and sensoric evaluation was subsequently carried out. The result of the experiment show a good and even sensoric quality of the wines produced using the <b>active</b> <b>dry</b> wine yeast fermentation, yet certain uniformity is apparent. On the contrary the spontaneous fermentation shows traces of unevenness in the sensoric quality evaluation. The most important finding is that the method that produces wine using the prepared ferment is a full alternative to the methods of spontaneous or <b>active</b> <b>dry</b> wine yeast fermentation and that in many cases leads to even better sensoric evaluation than these two methods. The prepared ferment method has a great potential in wine making practice mainly for high quality wines that focus on the varietal character, originality, story of origin, local tradition and "terroir"...|$|R

A Dissertation {{presented}} to the Faculty of the Graduate School at the University of Missouri [...] Columbia In Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree Doctor of Philosophy. Dissertation supervisor: Dr. Matthew R. Waldron. Vita. Three experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of commercially available feed additives on production variables and metabolic markers when supplemented during the periparturient period. The hypothesis was that the supplementation of feed additives throughout the periparturient period would improve production variables and metabolic markers. Feed additives investigated included a mixture of B-vitamins and <b>active</b> <b>dried</b> yeast, organically complexed trace minerals, and a yeast culture. For all experiments, the variables of interest included daily dry matter intake, milk yield, and feed efficiency as well as weekly body condition score, body weight, milk composition, 3. 5 % fat-corrected milk, energy-corrected milk (ECM), and colostrum immunoglobulin concentrations as measures of production performance. Plasma glucose, nonesterified fatty acids, and [beta]-hydroxybutyrate were examined in all experiments as markers of metabolic health.

40|$|Abstract Background Wine Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, {{adapted to}} {{anaerobic}} must fermentations, suffer oxidative stress {{when they are}} grown under aerobic conditions for biomass propagation in the industrial process of <b>active</b> <b>dry</b> yeast production. Oxidative metabolism of sugars favors high biomass yields but also causes increased oxidation damage of cell components. The overexpression of the TRX 2 gene, coding for a thioredoxin, enhances oxidative stress resistance in a wine yeast strain model. The thioredoxin and also the glutathione/glutaredoxin system constitute the most important defense against oxidation. Trx 2 p is also involved in the regulation of Yap 1 p-driven transcriptional response against some reactive oxygen species. Results Laboratory scale simulations of the industrial <b>active</b> <b>dry</b> biomass production process demonstrate that TRX 2 overexpression increases the wine yeast final biomass yield and also its fermentative capacity both after the batch and fed-batch phases. Microvinifications carried out with the modified strain show a fast start phenotype derived from its enhanced fermentative capacity and also increased content of beneficial aroma compounds. The modified strain displays an increased transcriptional response of Yap 1 p regulated genes and other oxidative stress related genes. Activities of antioxidant enzymes like Sod 1 p, Sod 2 p and catalase are also enhanced. Consequently, diminished oxidation of lipids and proteins is observed in the modified strain, which can explain the improved performance of the thioredoxin overexpressing strain. Conclusions We report several beneficial effects of overexpressing the thioredoxin gene TRX 2 in a wine yeast strain. We show that this strain presents an enhanced redox defense. Increased yield of biomass production process in TRX 2 overexpressing strain can be of special interest for several industrial applications. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{tolerance}} of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to desiccation {{is important for}} the use of this microorganism in the wine industry, since <b>active</b> <b>dry</b> wine yeast is routinely used as starter for must fermentations. Many studies have shown the complexity of the cellular effects caused by water loss, including oxidative injuries on macromolecular components. However the technological interest of yeast drying was not addressed in those studies, and the dehydration conditions were far from the industrial practice. In the present study a molecular approach was used to characterize the relevant injuring conditions during pilot plant dehydrations under two different drying temperatures (i. e., 35 and 41 °C). We have analyzed expression changes for several stress gene markers and we have determined two biochemical redox indicators (glutathione and lipid peroxidation levels) during pilot plant dehydrations to produce <b>active</b> <b>dry</b> biomass, according to the standard practice in industry. The main gene expression response involves the induction of genes TRR 1 and GRX 5, corresponding to the two main redox balance systems, thioredoxins and glutathione/glutaredoxins. Elevated glutathione content and significant lipid peroxidation damage indicate the physiological impact of the oxidative stress on cellular components. The comparison between commercial stocks and pilot plant samples demonstrate the suitability of the molecular approach at the pilot plant scale to study physiological traits of industrial yeast products. © 2009 Elsevier B.
