40|$|Among Nasagath Rogas, {{most of the}} acharyas {{described}} pratishyaya {{with its}} complications which proves {{the seriousness of the}} disease. Acharya susrutha clearly mentioned in Uttar tantra that Pratishyaya is the disease condition in which Vata and Kapha dusti was observed. Allergic Rhinitis is a disease characterized by sudden and frequent <b>attacks</b> <b>of</b> <b>sneezing,</b> profuse watery nasal discharge associated with nasal obstruction which is intermittent, watering of the eyes, heaviness of head, respiratory distress and anosmia. The present study aims to comparatively evaluate the clinical efficacy of shadbindu gritha nasya with haridra khanda internally in pratishayaya. The principle objective of the study is to find a most effective, economical and simple treatment for pratishayaya. Here 45 patients of pratishyaya- Allergic Rhinitis were treated in 3 groups. 15 patient of group A treated with Shadbindu gritha Nasya. 15 patient of group B treated with Haridrakhanda orally. 15 patient of group C treated with both Shadbindu gritha nasya and haridrakhanda as a combined therapy. After the enrollment of the patients in the study, vital signs and symptoms of Pratishyaya-Allergic rhinitis such as Nasa srava, Khavatu, Nasa avarodha, gala talu shuskata, were studied before and after the treatment. The results of the study indicated that the group c bestowed with highly significant relief in almost all the signs and symptoms in comparison to group A and group B...|$|R

40|$|Although {{sneezing}} is {{a particularly}} common symptom, there are surprisingly few references to this subject in the medical literature. Many of these references are shrouded in superstition and unscientific theory. Preparation of this report was stimulated by an interesting example of severe uncontrollable non-allergic paroxysmal sneezing which was carefully investigated with regard to both physical and psychological factors. A further example <b>of</b> paroxysms <b>of</b> <b>sneezing</b> occurring in a patient with temporal lobe seizures is also discussed with particular reference to the control <b>of</b> the <b>sneezing</b> episodes in association with anticonvulsant medication and control <b>of</b> the epileptic <b>attacks.</b> In addition, the neurophysiological mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>sneezing</b> are reviewed and the specific neurological references to the subject are discussed in relation to physiological and clinical data.

40|$|ABSTRACTBackgroundTo {{clarify the}} {{mechanism}} of stress-induced modification of allergic diseases, we studied the effect of restraint stress on plasma levels of cytokines and the symptoms of pollinosis in mice. MethodsThe effects of restraint stress {{and the role of}} the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA-axis) in the development of pollen antigen-induced pollinosis were studied in control, hypophysectomized, adrenalectomized or ACTH-administered mice. Twenty days after sensitization, animals were subjected to mild restraint stress for 3 hours, and plasma levels of IFN-γ, IL- 10, and IgE were measured. We analyzed the incidence <b>of</b> <b>sneezing</b> and nasal rubbing in the sensitized animals. ResultsPlasma levels of IL- 10 and IgE increased in the sensitized animals with a concomitant increase in the incidence <b>of</b> <b>sneezing</b> and nasal rubbing. The increases in plasma IgE, IL- 10 and the incidence <b>of</b> <b>sneezing</b> and nasal rubbing were suppressed by restraint stress. Adrenalectomy increased IFN-γ inhibited the increase in plasma IL- 10 and IgE, and suppressed the incidence <b>of</b> <b>sneezing.</b> In contrast, hypophysectomy increased plasma levels of IL- 10, IFN-γ and IgE and the incidence <b>of</b> <b>sneezing.</b> Intraperitoneal administration <b>of</b> ACTH decreased IL- 10 in plasma but increased IFN-γ and suppressed the incidence of nasal rubbing. ConclusionsThe present findings show that the HPA-axis and ACTH play important roles in the regulation of plasma cytokines and IgE thereby modulating symptoms of pollinosis. The results also suggest that a mild restraint stress suppresses the increase in Th 2 -dependent cytokines and IgE to reduce the symptoms of pollinosis...|$|R

50|$|A fit <b>of</b> <b>sneezing</b> while {{operating}} a vehicle {{can cause the}} operator to lose control of that vehicle, resulting in injury to the person, and damage to the vehicle and/or surroundings. In particular, photic sneezing poses a considerable risk to pilots, due to the frequent presence of bright sunlight and the precise reactions needed to successfully control the aircraft. For the pilot of a fighter aircraft, if an uncontrollable fit <b>of</b> <b>sneezing</b> were to occur during aerial combat, the pilot could be incapacitated when his or her situational awareness needs to be greatest. A plane landing on an aircraft carrier or shoreline also requires precise movements and quick reflexes. The reflection of the sun from surrounding water has a high probability of producing at least one photic sneeze for pilots who have the reflex. Any amount <b>of</b> <b>sneezing</b> while attempting to land could cause the pilot to lose control, potentially resulting in disaster.|$|R
