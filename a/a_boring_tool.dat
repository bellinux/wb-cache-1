50|$|Boring {{can be done}} on mills, lathes or {{drill press}} machines, either with a boring head or with just <b>a</b> <b>boring</b> <b>tool.</b> The shorter the {{distance}} between the tool holder and the material, the less distortion created from vibration or unbalanced gyroscopic effects. The greater the distance (static or dynamic mounts) the more flex in the tool or an increase in the imbalance of a moving tool. Use of a boring head increases the mass of the tool holder and decreases the distance. If a vibration is created it will be at a higher frequency and the deflection of the tool from the desired path will be much smaller and easier to erase through repetitive tool passes. In the case of a dynamic tool (mill or press), the balance of the tool can be adjusted with counterweights if the tool is mounted perpendicular to the shaft or the tool length can be decreased.|$|E

It also has been employed in a sense [...] "bores as a class" [...] (1883) and [...] "practice of being a bore" [...] (1864, a sense properly belonging to boreism, 1833). The word [...] "bore" [...] as a noun meaning a [...] "thing which causes ennui or annoyance" [...] is attested to since 1778; [...] "of persons by 1812".

40|$|AbstractMachining is {{a complex}} process in which many {{variables}} can detrimental the desired results. Among them, tool vibration is the most critical phenomenon which affects {{the life of the}} cutting tool, quality of the components machined and functional behaviour of the machined tools. This familiar phenomenon is recognized in many operations including boring, milling and drilling. The causing factors are related to the machine tool itself, tool clamping, length and diameter of the tool holder and the cutting data to be used. One way to avoid vibration problem during boring process is the location of boring tool holder in the relevant position for increasing the precision of the machining process.

40|$|Cantilever {{cutting tools}} are {{commonly}} used in drilling and boring. Since in the most of cases the boring is the last operation step in finishing holes, the requirements on tolerances and surface finish are consequently high on this process. This paper considers the boring process performed on a machining centre, i. e., with stationary workpiece and rotating boring bar. A novel concept for <b>a</b> <b>boring</b> <b>tool</b> with stable cutting geometry and good vibration dissipation is presented. This concept demonstrated high stability and high precision cutting. A dynamic model for machining process is presented. The model is further {{used to calculate the}} dynamic stability of the boring process. The main objective of the research presented in this paper is to characterize the machinability of hard alloy steel material during boring with focus on dynamics of various types of tool holding systems and their influence on the cutting process stability in terms of tool wear, cutting forces, vibrations, acoustic sound, surface finish, and modal parameters...|$|E
40|$|In {{the process}} of rock desintegration <b>a</b> <b>boring</b> <b>tool</b> is {{subjected}} to the wear. From a viewpoint of the bit wear, changes on the contact of operating tool with rock at its one-shot and rerun load or overload by external forces are technically significant. Theis change results in the degradation of bit working properties and the output of desintegration also decreases. In the major part of cases, together with the bit wear, the contact area of a tool with a rock massifs enhanced and this fact causes an increase of fines (dust) creation during the desintegration. The wear is always connected with a friction, forces action, deformation, damage, and the increased mechanical work consumption. As to energetic aspects of bit wear, the wear was observed {{as a function of}} bore length and in the most of cases as a dependence of the operating time. A linear dependence between the wear intensity (bit wear per unit of bore length) and the specific energy of desintegration (energy consumed per volume unit of desintegrated rock) was experimentally verified. Thus, the changes of bit wear can be implicitly observed by monitoring the specific energy. At the same time, the specific energy is a function of input parameters of the desintegration process and in the field of applicable external forces it shows an extreme (minimum). Therefore, the specific energy is useful for the extreme optimisation of the rock desintegration process from the viewpoint of the bit wear. It was mathematically proven that the tool output at the desintegration exponentially decreases with the amount of work consumed in the rock desintegration. The derivation of this knowledge comes out from the Krendelev equation...|$|E

5000|$|Turning is a {{machining}} {{process in which}} a cutting tool, typically a non-rotary tool bit, describes a helix toolpath by moving more or less linearly while the workpiece rotates.

Usually the term [...] "turning" [...] is reserved for the generation of external surfaces by this cutting action, whereas this same essential cutting action when applied to internal surfaces (that is, holes, of one kind or another) is called [...] "boring". Thus the phrase [...] "turning and boring" [...] categorizes the larger family of (essentially similar) processes known as lathing.

In Iteration 2, a slight cyclic pattern is observed. This {{is because of the}} reason that there is a constant progressive wear out of the boring bar insert on continued boring operation. After every ten components being machined, the boring bar insert must be compensated for the wear by elevating the insert by about five micrometers, over the diametric dimension. This exercise is performed {{with the help of a}} test mandrel and <b>a</b> <b>boring</b> bar <b>tool</b> insert setting Vee-block. Because of worn out Vee-surfaces of tool insert setting Vee-block, though the insert setting is done it is not accurate and this is reflected in the cyclic pattern observed in the second optimization step of Iteration 2. As a measure of corrective action, a new insert setting Vee-block is replaced with the old worn-out piece and the Vee surfaces of the Vee-Block are case hardened to achieve hardness up to 55 HRc with a case depth of 0.5 – 0.8  mm. In this iteration we see a marginal increase in CP to 1.32 and CPK to 0.90.|$|R

50|$|Modern <b>boring</b> <b>tools</b> {{have three}} primary {{components}} although many differing designs. The parts include the body, bar holder and dial screw (graduated micro screw). The body, made of solid stock, has two basic parts. The top part threads or presses into the supporting shank. The lower part (bar holder) is connected via dovetail, T-slots or a smooth notch with <b>an</b> adjustment for <b>bore</b> diameter via the dial screw. As the dial screw is adjusted, the cutting bit/s are moved further out, creating a larger cut. This also can create some slight distortion if {{the cutting tool}} is moved further than the boring head is designed to support, if there is undue wear in the bearings supporting the tool or if the tool speed is too great for the off-balance effect caused by moving the tool too far from center. This is called unbalanced gyroscope precession. Once the dial screw has been adjusted to give the proper cut a set screw is generally used to prevent any additional movement of the cutting head. The third basic part is the <b>boring</b> <b>tool.</b> Boring tools can be mounted vertically or horizontally in many boring head designs.|$|R

50|$|The {{purpose of}} the bore is to get from point A to point B under the obstruction. First the {{operator}} surveys the area and the obstacle(road, sidewalk, driveway). Utility locates must be present for any underground work, the path most clear of utilities is chosen to send the tool through. The first hole is now dug {{on one side of}} the obstacle. This hole must be large enough to fit the tool and the operator in it so they can aim the tool. The hole also must be deep enough that as the tool compacts the ground the surface remains undisturbed. The depth of the starting bore pit depends on the type on soil that is being worked in and how well it compacts. The operator aims the tool to the desired exit point and allows it to perform its function creating <b>a</b> <b>bore</b> hole under the ground without disturbing the surface. The tool is tracked by the operator who feels the tool pounding and can approximate the tools location under the ground. The operator also monitors the surface to make sure that it is undisturbed. As the tool nears the exit point it is slowed down and an exit pit is dug to locate both the <b>tool</b> and the <b>bore.</b> <b>As</b> the <b>tool</b> enters the exit pit the operator chooses to either dig up the tool to retrieve it or reverses the tool back into the first bore pit to retrieve it. Now between the two pits is <b>a</b> completed <b>bore</b> under the obstacle which can be used to run the product.|$|R
