The study takes place in three project regions which represent typical landscapes in Southern Germany and Austria. In each project area, {{the influence of a}} changing agri-food environment is analysed. The following scenarios are defined: (1) status quo (current economic and agri-political framework); (2) high-producer prices and constant (or even increasing) direct payments; and (3) low-producer prices and no (or very low) direct payments. In all three regions, potential production responses are estimated for all farms and aggregated on a regional level. The estimation takes into account social and economic parameters such as cash flow, size and type of farms, age of farmers and workload. The results show that the impact of the changing agro-economic environment differs in particular on the level of the study regions. Due to a lack of <b>production</b> <b>alternatives,</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> in grassland areas is very unstable – especially if site conditions are unfavourable and economic conditions are disadvantageous. As a result, large-scale abandonment of agriculture is likely in low-yield grassland areas and consequences for landscape appearance might be dramatic. In high-yield grassland areas, agriculture is much more stable. However, under very disadvantageous conditions the extent of farms giving-up production is as high as in marginal grassland regions. Nevertheless one cannot expect large-scale set aside, because remaining farmers use the possibility of growth and lease a considerable quantity of land In contrast to this, farm structure in the arable regions is stable due to a high potential of production alternatives. However, landscape appearance may also change dramatically in this region due to the increasing importance of maize. scenario analyses, structural change, landscape visualisation, Agribusiness, Agricultural and Food Policy, Community/Rural/Urban Development, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety, Labor and Human Capital,...|$|R

40|$|In slash-and-burn agriculture, {{secondary}} forest has a main {{role in the}} fertilization of the soil, after the burning of its plant biomass. Generally, successive burns tend to destroy all forms of regeneration, including the seed banks. With this problem in mind, the Studies of Human Impact on Forests and Floodplains in the Tropics Project (SHIFT), in which this research is inserted, {{after a series of}} basic studies on {{secondary forest}}s in the region of Bragança, has been developing an <b>alternative</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> in which secondary forest is used as a source of nutrients and organic matter for the soil in 'fire-free' agricultural production systems. The work was developed in the municipality of Marapanim, it was a participative experiment, a new project approach, where the farmers chose the areas. The objective of the present work was to assess the potential of the seed bank in areas subjected to different forms of soil management, characterizing qualitative and quantitatively. The hypothesis that fire diminishes the potential of seed banks and creates favorable conditions for the regeneration of invading herbaceous species was tested, as well as that chopped mulch minimizes the impacts caused by burning on plant diversity and increases the regeneration of biomass-accumulating species. The germination potential of seed banks in the treatments was monitored during 270 days. Density, species richness, families and predominating life forms were assessed in the treatments burn, chopped mulch. In the seed bank before soil management, the average density in burn was 284 individuals/m 2 and in the chopped mulch it was 328 individuals/m 2, and after soil management in burn there were in average 23 individuals/ m 2 found and in the chopped mulch 139 individuals/m 2.

The majority of the agricultural production methods in SA are industrialised and rely heavily on external inputs. <b>Alternative</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> methods which are environmentally less taxing, are affordable and yield nutritious food, need to be investigated and adopted. A long-term trial investigating the differences in yields between conventional and organic farming systems was established at the NMMU George Saasveld campus. A baseline study preceded the cropping seasons to establish pre-treatment soil conditions before the two farming systems were be implemented. The trial was a randomized complete block design split into organic, conventional and control plots. In the first cropping season (summer) three crops cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata), sweet potato (Ipomea batatas) and cowpea (vigna ungucuilata) were planted under the different treatments. Soil fertility changes after application of chemical and organic fertilizer were measured. Soil pH and phosphorus increased whilst potassium and soil carbon decreased from baseline levels. The organic plots were found to have higher soil pH, potassium and carbon, whilst P was higher in the conventional plots. The organic cabbages had a yield 12 % lower than conventional cabbages, organic cowpeas were 51 % lower than conventional cowpeas. Baboons damaged sweet potato plots before maturity. Broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. italica), radish (Raphanus sativa) and green pea (Pisum sativum) were planted in the second cropping season (winter). Organic broccoli yields were 51 % lower than conventional broccoli, organic green peas were 18 % lower than conventional green peas.

Typical for them is that they are unpretentious to the soil, resistant to major diseases and pests occurring in cereals. Einkorn and spelt are considered the most ancient types of wheat today and now they are perceived as healthy food. They are distinguished from ordinary wheat in the following parameters: higher percentage of protein; greater amount of fiber, minerals and vitamins /twice higher contents of Vitamin A; vitamins B; calcium, phosphorus, iron, zinc and others/; they do not contain cholesterol. They outmach the common wheat in the content of selenium and antioxidants, the amount of gluten is minimized. It does not cause allergic reactions in people suffering from celiac disease /in which the specific protein is not digested, in this case - gluten/. The reason for this property is the content of only 14 chromosomes as opposed to 28 in the common wheat and 42 in the modern types of wheat, which makes it easy to assimilate.

Linear regression equations were obtained, which enabled us to estimate the minimum rainfall volume required for the occurrence of stemflow. A strong positive linear correlation was observed between stemflow and gross precipitation, regardless of the number of leaves per plant. The morphological characteristics of the macaúba palm favor rainfall interception, relatively high stemflow values being shown even in young plants. The funnel-shaped crown enabled the conduction of large rainfall volumes to the stem, thus resulting in the occurrence of stemflow even with light precipitations...|$|R

40|$|The high plains aquifer system, which {{underlies}} nearly 85 {{percent of}} the state of Nebraska, supplies about 95 percent of all groundwater used in Nebraska. Agricultural activities in the state use most of the groundwater (94 percent), while domestic and commercial users also depend heavily on this groundwater source. About 84 {{percent of the}} state 2 ̆ 7 s public drinking water supplies are from groundwater (Comfort, Shea, and Roeth 1994; Exner and Spalding 1990). With such high dependence on groundwater preserving groundwater quality is of crucial importance. Intensive agriculture characterizes this region, especially in the Central Nebraska Basin (CNB), {{in part because of the}} good irrigation supplies provided by the Middle Platte alluvial aquifer system. Nearly one-third of the cropland in the CNB is irrigated and 50 percent of all cropland is planted to corn. About 729, 000 tons of nitrogen, 184, 000 tons of phosphorus, and 33 million pounds of pesticides (45 percent of which is atrazine) are applied annually on Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s cropland. The intensive application of nutrients and chemicals every year creates the potential for nonpoint source contamination, which is a major concern for communities. Exner and Spalding (1990) analyzed 5, 826 groundwater samples from the Nebraska basins for nitrates and 2, 260 samples for pesticides, and found that about 20 percent of the samples had nitrate-nitrogen concentrations exceeding the drinking water Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) of 10 parts per million (ppm) and 12. 4 percent of the samples had detectable levels of atrazine.

Environmental Protection Agency, Region VII, is working with the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality, Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s Natural Resource Districts (NRDs), and other partners to develop a comprehensive ecosystem approach to manage the Platte River Basin, which is one of the five national case study sites for multiple stressor-based ecological risk assessments. One of the objectives of the Platte River Basin program is to evaluate agricultural economic and environmental tradeoffs resulting from commonly adopted crop production systems and their contributions ton nonpoint source nutrient and chemical pollution. The research team at the Center for Agricultural and Rural Development (CARD), Iowa State University, initiated an effort to develop a comprehensive economic and environmental modeling system to study the effects of alternative crop production systems on edge-or-field nonpoint source loadings of agricultural nutrients and chemicals using the field-level survey data collected under the (NB Area Study project.

The experimental design was totally randomized, with four replications of 50 seeds or 10 seedlings, in a factorial scheme 6 x 3; with six priming conditions (control, osmopriming during 24 and 48 hours, hydropriming with 1, 2 and 3 cycles of hydration-dehydration) and three biosaline water (fish farming biosaline wastewater) concentrations in distilled water (0, 50 e 100 %). We evaluated the kinetics and percentage of germination; germinative metabolism and activity of antioxidant enzymes. According to the results, one hydropriming cycle is faster and more efficient to improve the performance of cucumber seedling in biosaline water and this can be used in substrate for germinating seeds of cucumber cv. Caipira. Index terms: water reuse, Curcubitaceae, seedling development. Modificações fisiológicas em sementes de pepino osmo e hidrocondicionadas germinadas em água biossalina RESUMO- A agricultura biossalina tem sido uma alternativa viável para a produção agrícola em regiões com escassez de água de boa qualidade. Para possibilitar o cultivo de hortaliças em condutividades elétricas elevadas, o condicionamento fisiológico de sementes tem sido utilizado para aumentar a tolerância destas ao estresse causado pela utilização de água salobra. Objetivou-se avaliar a eficiência do osmo e hidrocondicionamento em sementes de pepino cv. Caipira em água biossalina, quanto à germinação e as modificações bioquímicas durante o processo germinativo. O delineamento foi inteiramente casualizado, co...|$|R

In particular, we have asked how the ex ante expected volume of <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> responds to additional information when information also affects the futures market for agricultural commodities. The analysis has produced two main results. Firstly, higher market transparency increases farmers’ expected profits {{as long as the}} cost function is convex. However, higher market transparency does not increase <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> levels per se. If farmers’ marginal cost functions are concave (convex), higher market transparency leads to higher (lower) ex ante expected levels of <b>agricultural</b> <b>production.</b>|$|R
