5|$|The duo was {{eventually}} smuggled into occupied Poland where they contacted the Polish Underground in Częstochowa {{and joined the}} guerrilla movement Armia Krajowa. Posing as a Polish laborer working in <b>a</b> <b>jam</b> factory, he served on patrols, raided food convoys, and assassinated members of the Gestapo during a probationary period. After the camp was attacked in December, which not only killed several resistance members but also caused a split in the group, the reduced force continued its operations until February 1944, when retaliation for a raid on a police garrison lowered their membership to a critical point.|$|E
50|$|Granular {{systems are}} known to exhibit <b>jamming</b> and undergo <b>a</b> <b>jamming</b> {{transition}} which is {{thought of as a}} thermodynamic phase transition to <b>a</b> <b>jammed</b> state.The Lubachevsky-Stillinger algorithm of jamming allows one to produce simulated jammed granular configurations.|$|R

5|$|Fat Freddy's Drop is a New Zealand seven-piece {{band from}} Wellington, whose musical style has been characterised as any {{combination}} of dub, reggae, soul, jazz, rhythm and blues, and techno. Originally <b>a</b> <b>jam</b> band formed in the late 1990s by musicians from other bands in Wellington, Fat Freddy's Drop gradually became its members' sole focus. Band members continued playing with their other respective groups—The Black Seeds, TrinityRoots, Bongmaster, and others—for much of their 13-year career. Fat Freddy's Drop {{are known for their}} improvised live performances; songs on their studio albums are versions refined over years of playing them live in New Zealand, and on tour abroad.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, Norman {{was visited}} {{by a young}} Bob Marley in his Bronx apartment. Norman had at that time written a number of songs for Johnny Nash, whose record label had just signed Marley, and Marley wanted {{to learn more about}} rhythm and blues. Along with Al Pyfrom, Norman's co-writer, and Marley's wife Rita, the pair spent several days in <b>a</b> <b>jam</b> session that {{ultimately}} resulted in a 24-minute tape of Marley performing several of his own and Norman-Pyfrom's compositions. According to Reggae archivist Roger Steffens, the tape—which was lost among Norman's possessions for decades—is rare for Marley in that it was influenced by pop music rather than reggae, highlighting a point in Marley's career when he was still trying to find his path. Some of the songs from this early jam session were released on the Marley album Chances Are.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, CEO Robert California (James Spader) surprises Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner), and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) {{when he asks}} to {{join their}} band after he finds them having <b>a</b> <b>jam</b> session in the warehouse. Soon thereafter, California's friends, skilled musicians themselves, arrive to join in. Not having brought their own instruments, two of them take over Kevin's drums and Darryl's synthesizer, while Andy's {{acoustic}} guitar is {{drowned out by the}} newcomer's electric guitar. The three of them are thus relegated to playing percussion. Andy, Kevin and Darryl, with the help of warehouse worker Val, realize that they were ousted, and after a failed attempt to try getting their original band roles back, they instead satisfyingly jam outside by themselves.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} {{implement}} a reactive approach, {{it is first necessary}} to detect jamming. Well-known jamming detection methods usually use packet delivery ratio, packet loss rate, packet latency, and signal strength [2, 14, 17]. Jamming detection schemes can be classified into two categories: the signal strength consistency-based approach and the location consistency-based approach. In the signal strength consistency-based approach, a low packet delivery ratio and a high received signal strength usually indicate <b>a</b> <b>jamming</b> attack. <b>A</b> location consistency-based approach determines the location of a node and measures throughput. If the throughput is low for a node that is close by, it might be due to <b>a</b> <b>jamming</b> attack. The signal strength consistency-based approach of Xu et al. [2] is used to detect <b>a</b> <b>jamming</b> attack in our proposed scheme.|$|R

5|$|The frog cake {{is a small}} dessert {{shaped to}} {{resemble}} a frog with its mouth open, consisting of a sponge base with <b>a</b> <b>jam</b> centre, topped in artificial cream {{and covered with a}} thick layer of fondant icing. The recipe today remains identical to the one employed when the cake was first produced in the 1920s. When manufactured, large layers of sponge cake are combined and cut mechanically into shape, covered in the fondant, and the mouth is then formed with a hot knife. Fondant eyes of a contrasting colour are manually added to the head, and the completed dessert is presented in a paper patty-pan. The fondant is normally brown, green or pink, but for special occasions colours can include variations such as red and yellow.|$|E
5|$|In late 1984 Chrisye {{approached}} {{another young}} composer, Adjie Soetama, {{to help him}} prepare his next album. Light beats and cheerful melodies were in vogue at the time; therefore the two used a lighter style. Recording for the new album, titled Aku Cinta Dia (I Love Her), began in 1985, with additional songs from Guruh and Dadang S. Manaf. The titular song was chosen after Aciu heard <b>a</b> <b>jam</b> session led by Adjie and immediately decided {{that it would be}} the lead single. The album called for more emoting, which Chrisye– known as having a stiff stage persona– struggled to deliver, though Yanti prepared colourful costumes and Alex Hasyim trained him in choreography. Upon its release, Aku Cinta Dia sold hundreds of thousands of copies in the first week and was eventually certified gold. That same year, Chrisye and Adji Soetama released Hip Hip Hura (Hip Hip Hurray!), and another collaboration, Nona Lisa (Miss Lisa), was released in 1986; the later two albums had similar beats and rhythms and sold well, although not as well as Aku Cinta Dia. On 2 March 1986 Chrisye and Yanti had their second daughter, Risty Nurraisa.|$|E
