5|$|The X-44 MANTA, or multi-axis, no-tail aircraft, was {{a planned}} {{experimental}} aircraft {{based on the}} F-22 with enhanced thrust vectoring controls and no <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>surface</b> backup.

25|$|The Duchess wing is of {{honeycomb}} construction fastened by bonding, {{rather than}} rivets, to reduce cost {{and produce a}} smoother <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{pressure}} distributions {{across the}} test model {{have historically been}} measured by drilling many small holes along the airflow path, and using multi-tube manometers to measure the pressure at each hole. Pressure distributions can more conveniently be measured {{by the use of}} pressure-sensitive paint, in which higher local pressure is indicated by lowered fluorescence of the paint at that point. Pressure distributions can also be conveniently measured by the use of pressure-sensitive pressure belts, a recent development in which multiple ultra-miniaturized pressure sensor modules are integrated into a flexible strip. The strip is attached to the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>surface</b> with tape, and it sends signals depicting the pressure distribution along its surface.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{fault-tolerant}} strategy for hypersonic reentry vehicles with mixed <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>surfaces</b> and reaction control systems (RCS) under external disturbances {{and subject to}} actuator faults. <b>Aerodynamic</b> <b>surfaces</b> are treated as the primary actuator in normal situations, and they are driven by a continuous quadratic programming (QP) allocator to generate torque commanded by a nonlinear adaptive feedback control law. When <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>surfaces</b> encounter faults, {{they may not be}} able to provide sufficient torque as commanded, and RCS jets are activated to augment the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>surfaces</b> to compensate for insufficient torque. Partial loss of effectiveness and stuck faults are considered in this paper, and observers are designed to detect and identify the faults. Based on the fault identification results, an RCS control allocator using integer linear programming (ILP) techniques is designed to determine the optimal combination of activated RCS jets. By treating the RCS control allocator as a quantization element, closed-loop stability with both continuous and quantized inputs is analyzed. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method...|$|R

50|$|Low-g {{conditions}} can also affect fixed-wing aircraft in some instances, mainly by disrupting the airflow over the wings, making them {{difficult or impossible}} to control via the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>surfaces.</b>|$|R
50|$|Glide {{bombs are}} bombs with <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{to allow a}} gliding flightpath rather than a {{ballistic}} one. This enables the carrying aircraft to attack a heavily defended target from a distance.|$|R
50|$|The three-surface {{configuration}} {{is claimed}} to reduce total <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>surface</b> area {{compared to the}} conventional and canard configurations, thus enabling drag and weight reductions.|$|E
50|$|In aviation, a strake is an <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>surface</b> {{generally}} {{mounted on}} the fuselage of an aircraft to improve the flight characteristics either by controlling the airflow (acting as large vortex generators) or by simple stabilising effect.|$|E
50|$|Plasma {{has been}} {{introduced}} to hypersonic flow control. Firstly, plasma could be much easier generated for hypersonic vehicle at high altitude with quite low atmospheric pressure and high surface temperature.

50|$|An {{anti-shock body}} (also known as Whitcomb body or Küchemann carrot) is a pod {{positioned}} {{on the leading}} edge or trailing edge of an aircraft's <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>surfaces</b> to reduce wave drag at transonic speeds (Mach 0.8-1.0).|$|R
50|$|For <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>surface</b> {{control it}} {{will use a}} {{hydraulic}} system controlled by fly-by-wire from the cockpit. The aircraft will be powered by the new Executor liquid-fuelled rocket engine, under construction at ARCA, which will use kerosene as fuel and liquid oxygen as oxidiser.|$|E
5000|$|Anti-shock body: a {{streamlined}} pod shape {{added to}} the leading or trailing edge of an <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>surface,</b> to delay the onset of shock stall and reduce transonic wave drag. Examples include the Küchemann carrots on the wing trailing edge of the Handley Page Victor B.2.|$|E
5000|$|Flap: a hinged <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>surface,</b> {{usually on}} the {{trailing}} edge, which is rotated downwards to generate extra lift and drag. Types include plain, slotted, and split. Some, such as Fowler Flaps, also extend rearwards to increase wing area. The Krueger flap is a leading-edge device.|$|E
50|$|Thrust-Vectoring {{flight control}} (TVFC) is {{obtained}} through deflection {{of the aircraft}} jets in {{some or all of}} the pitch, yaw and roll directions. In the extreme, deflection of the jets in yaw, pitch and roll creates desired forces and moments enabling complete directional control of the aircraft flight path without the implementation of the conventional aerodynamic flight controls (CAFC). TVFC can also be used to hold stationary flight in areas of the flight envelope where the main <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>surfaces</b> are stalled. TVFC includes control of STOVL aircraft during the hover and during the transition between hover and forward speeds below 50 knots where <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>surfaces</b> are ineffective.|$|R
50|$|Conventional planar control fins {{are shaped}} like {{miniature}} wings. By contrast, grid fins are a lattice of smaller <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>surfaces</b> arranged within a box. Their appearance has sometimes {{led them to}} be compared to potato mashers or waffle irons.|$|R
40|$|The Space Shuttle Orbiter is {{controlled}} during entry {{by a combination}} of <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>surfaces</b> composed of elevons, a body flap, and a rudder that flares as a speedbrake, and a reaction control system that uses 16 small rocket thrusters. To determine the effects of realistic atmospheric density variations on reentry, a series of Monte Carlo trajectories were generated for each season. The performance parameters analyzed include maximum hinge moments experienced by the <b>aerodynamic</b> control <b>surfaces,</b> the maximum deflections experienced by the <b>aerodynamic</b> control <b>surfaces,</b> a range of angle-of-sideslip values, maximum dynamic pressure, maximum stagnation point heat rate, and state conditions at touchdown. The results of the investigation indicate that the Orbiter guidance and control systems could tolerate atmospheric variability without failures in the control system hardware...|$|R
50|$|The blunt body, rigid aeroshell system encases a {{spacecraft}} in a protective shell. This shell {{acts as an}} <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>surface,</b> providing lift and drag, and provides protection from the intense heating experienced during high-speed atmospheric flight. Once the spacecraft is captured into orbit, the aeroshell is jettisoned.|$|E

50|$|Parachuting is {{essentially}} falling {{but with an}} aerodynamic braking surface. The high ratio of surface area to weight reduces the rate of descent of the parachute, allowing it to stay airborne for longer periods. The <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>surface</b> may also allow {{a small amount of}} forward motion, but a parachute always falls faster than it can travel forwards. The airflow around a parachute is typically turbulent.|$|E
50|$|The common {{throttle}} lever {{for the four}} vertical lift engines was the only additional primary control input present; it was operated {{in a similar manner}} to that of the Collective pitch level of a rotorcraft. The type possessed two means of exercising attitude control over the aircraft; <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>surfaces</b> which were used during conventional flight, and air jet nozzles during hovers and vertical flight. Bleed air was extracted from the four lift engines (using approximately 10 per cent of the intake air mass/thrust) to power variable nose, tail and wing tip air jet nozzles, which acted to provide pitch, roll and yaw control at low speeds during which there would be insufficient airflow over the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>surfaces</b> for conventional controls to be effective.|$|R
40|$|An {{assessment}} of the relative speeds and payload capacities of airborne and waterborne vehicles highlights a gap that can be usefully filled by a new vehicle concept, utilizing both hydrodynamic and aerodynamic forces. A high- speed marine vehicle equipped with <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>surfaces</b> is one such concept. In 1904, Bryan & Williams (Bryan & Williams 1904 Proc. R. Soc. Lond. 73, 100 - 116 (doi: 10. 1098 /rspl. 1904. 0017)) published {{an article on the}} longitudinal dynamics of aerial gliders, and this approach remains the foundation of all the mathematical models studying the dynamics of airborne vehicles. In 1932, Perring & Glauert (Perring & Glauert 1932 Reports and Memoranda no. 1493) presented a mathematical approach to study the dynamics of seaplanes experiencing the planing effect. From this work, planing theory has developed. The authors propose a unified mathematical model to study the longitudinal stability of a high-speed planing marine vehicle with <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>surfaces.</b> A kinematics framework is developed. Then, taking into account the aerodynamic, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, the full equations of motion, using a small perturbation assumption, are derived and solved specifically for this concept. This technique reveals a new static stability criterion {{that can be used to}} characterize the longitudinal stability of high-speed planing vehicles with <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>surfaces...</b>|$|R
25|$|Class 2 (designated by the FAI as Sub-Class O-2) have a rigid primary {{structure}} with movable <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>surfaces,</b> such as spoilers, {{as the primary}} method of control. The pilot is often enclosed {{by means of a}} fairing. These offer the best performance and are the most expensive.|$|R
50|$|The SCR {{was created}} in 2013, it competed during both the 2013 and 2014 season.By {{designing}} a complete carbon fibre body, the team saved on weight and increased the stiffness of the car. The most visible change in design was the addition <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>surface,</b> which were designed {{in order to give}} the most down force against a certain amount of power. During the 2014 season it competed in events of UK, Czech republic and Varano.|$|E
5000|$|An {{aircraft}} stabilizer is an <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>surface,</b> typically {{including one}} or more movable control surfaces, that provides longitudinal (pitch) and/or directional (yaw) stability and control. A stabilizer can feature a fixed or adjustable structure on which any movable control surfaces are hinged, or it can itself be a fully movable surface such as a stabilator. Depending on the context, [...] "stabilizer" [...] may sometimes describe only the front {{part of the overall}} surface.|$|E
50|$|A Leading edge slat is an <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>surface</b> running {{spanwise}} {{just ahead}} of the wing leading edge. It creates a leading edge slot between the slat and wing which directs air over the wing surface, helping to maintain smooth airflow at low speeds and high angles of attack. This delays the stall, allowing the aircraft to fly at a higher angle of attack. Slats may be made fixed, or retractable in normal flight to minimize drag.|$|E
50|$|A {{spaceplane}} is {{an aircraft}} designed {{to pass the}} edge of space. It combines some features of an aircraft with some of a spacecraft. Typically, it {{takes the form of}} a spacecraft equipped with <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>surfaces,</b> one or more rocket engines, and sometimes additional airbreathing propulsion as well.|$|R
50|$|Thrust {{vectoring}} {{is a way}} {{to reduce}} a missile's minimum range, before which it cannot reach a speed high enough for its small <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>surfaces</b> to produce effective maneuver. For example, anti-tank missiles such as the ERYX and the PARS 3 LR use thrust vectoring for this reason.|$|R
5000|$|The current {{standard}} procedures {{to examine the}} <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>surfaces</b> before departure, along with the inefficiency, can not fully guarantee the preventions of similar accidents during takeoff in the future {{because of the high}} sensitivity of the wing, that does not permit even a slight contamination of the leading edge.|$|R
