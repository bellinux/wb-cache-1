5|$|In the present, Fox Mulder and Alex Krycek {{return to}} the United States, but are run off the road by another vehicle. The assailants attempt to {{apprehend}} Krycek, but are severely injured when he emits <b>a</b> <b>flashing</b> light. The Smoking Man sees their bodies and orders their destruction. Mulder, who was knocked unconscious in the crash, awakens in the hospital. Dana Scully tells Mulder about Walter Skinner's condition, and says that an analysis of saliva has identified his shooter as the same person who killed her sister Melissa.|$|E
5|$|As {{the patrons}} leave due to not {{receiving}} a refund, the pictures going black {{when they were}} getting to important scenes, and complain about {{the taste of the}} popcorn (due to the mess the babies have made in the concession stand), Stu is angry at the fact that The Land Without Smiles went out at the climax. But at least they think that Tommy can go through a whole movie without any fuss. Because they didn't see the ending, Didi and Stu decide to go out to see the movie again next week, but at a different theater. As Grandpa Lou eats a candy bar in the back seat, Tommy takes notice of <b>a</b> <b>flashing</b> Reptar billboard as they drive by.|$|E
5|$|Avery Point Light or Avery Point Lighthouse is a {{lighthouse}} in Groton, Connecticut, United States, on the Avery Point Campus of the University of Connecticut. Although construction {{was completed in}} March 1943, the lighthouse was not lit until May 1944 due to concerns of possible enemy invasion. Its original light consisted of eight 200-watt bulbs that were later replaced by <b>a</b> <b>flashing</b> green light in 1960. It was deactivated on June 25, 1967, when the United States Coast Guard Training Station moved to Governors Island. It is officially listed as the last lighthouse built in the state; the only other claimant is the replica Mystic Seaport Light.|$|E

5|$|The video {{starts with}} Knowles laying on a table, lit with <b>a</b> <b>flashing</b> bright red light. While a siren is blaring, she half-stands and sings while {{dancing on the}} table. She {{proceeds}} to an interrogation room {{similar to the one}} in the film Basic Instinct. Knowles sings the first verse in a house with a seashore backdrop. She wants to escape, and struggles with masked and uniformed guards in a hallway. She is then returned to the interrogation room. In between cuts, she sings in a corner of a room, is seen reflected in a mirror while screaming, and among a group of reporters. As the song closes, Knowles is shown crying. The video ends with a close-up view of Knowles putting on red lipstick. The scene shows only her lips.|$|E
5|$|The player takes {{control of}} the Gunhed Star Fighter through nine {{vertically}} scrolling areas. The player's mission is to destroy the Dark Squadron and its eight enemy Super Weapons. Every area contains one or more bosses, all of which must be destroyed before continuing in the game. Players lose a life if they are hit by an enemy or projectile, with the game continuing at a previously–crossed checkpoint, unless they grab <b>a</b> <b>flashing</b> orb which destroys all on-screen enemies and allows them to continue {{at the point where}} their previous ship was destroyed (represented by the icon illustrating the remaining number of ships turning gold). The game ends when all lives have been lost, but the game awards 1-ups when the player scores a particular number of points. The game provides four continues in which players can restart the game at that level in which their previous game ended provided the system is not turned off.|$|E
5|$|Utilising the Game Boy Horror, {{players can}} access {{a map of}} the mansion, seeing which rooms they have visited, what doors are open, and which remain locked. When Luigi finds a key during his explorations, the Game Boy Horror {{automatically}} indicates which door it unlocks. In addition to a map function, the device also keeps track of any treasure that Luigi has found - rooms will usually have treasure hidden within, which can be either coins, gems, gold bars and so forth, hidden within items and even in a chest that appears when the ghosts are cleared out, which Luigi can draw out and then suck up with the Poltergust; if a ghost harms Luigi, he will drop a small portion of collected treasure that he will need to recover before it disappears. After Luigi encounters a group of Boos hiding in the mansion, the device can be used to find each one hiding in a room, through a beeper sound and <b>a</b> <b>flashing</b> yellow light on the device, which turns red when Luigi is close to one; Boos can only be located in rooms that have become lit after their ghosts have been cleared out. Boos are trickier to deal with, as they can plant decoys and traps within objects they can hide in that can fool the Horror, and will escape into other rooms if they can, forcing the player to chase after them.|$|E

25|$|Usage of {{emergency}} vehicle lighting is restricted in the United Kingdom through the Road Vehicle Lighting Regulations 1989.

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>flashing</b> {{single or}} double yellow aspect {{indicates}} that a train {{is to take a}} diverging route ahead with a lower line speed than the main route, indicating to the driver to slow the train down in time for the lower speed of the diverging route. <b>A</b> <b>flashing</b> double yellow (only used in 4-aspect signalling) means that the next signal is showing flashing single yellow. <b>A</b> <b>flashing</b> single yellow means that the next signal at the junction is showing (steady) single yellow with an indication for a diverging route, and the signal beyond the junction is at danger (red). The train driver has to slow the train down in preparation for stopping at the red signal, and this ensures that the train crosses the junction safely. As the train nears the junction, the red signal beyond may 'step up' to a less restrictive aspect depending {{on the state of the}} line ahead.|$|E
25|$|A {{failure of}} the {{changeover}} relay to switch on the flashing indication to the double-yellow aspect {{would not be a}} problem as it is considered a steady double-yellow followed by <b>a</b> <b>flashing</b> single-yellow aspect sequence is acceptable.|$|E
