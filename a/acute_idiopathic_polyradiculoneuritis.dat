40|$|We assayed immune {{complexes}} (IC) by Particle Counting ImmunoAssay in the serum and {{cerebrospinal fluid}} (CSF) {{of patients with}} various neurological disorders. In pyogenic meningitis, the levels of IC sharply increased 4 - 8 days after onset with a fall before the 10 th day of the disease. In herpetic encephalitis the IC and antibody levels started to increase about 12 days after onset. The IC persisted at high values for 3 - 4 weeks, whereas the high antibody titers persisted for several months during the follow-up. In these 2 groups of patients IC were probably locally produced {{as indicated by the}} lack of correlation with the IC levels in the serum.

40|$|Senior seminar (D. V. M.) [...] Cornell University, 2004. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaf 13). Acute, severe, diffuse {{neuromuscular disease}} {{is characterized by}} distinct neurologic signs and the primary differential diagnoses include Coonhound paralysis/acute polyradiculoneuritis, organophosphate toxicity, fulminant myasthenia gravis, botulism, tick paralysis, and polymyositis. In the case presented in this paper, history and diagnostics were used to identify acute polyradiculoneuritis as the most likely cause of clinical signs. Coonhound paralysis is an acute polyradiculoneuritis that {{is believed to be}} caused by an immune-mediated reaction to an antigen present in the saliva of a raccoon. <b>Acute</b> <b>idiopathic</b> <b>polyradiculoneuritis</b> is an identical syndrome except that there is no history of exposure to a raccoon. In the latter case, it is presumed that another foreign antigen is responsible for the immune response. In either case, the foreign antigen resembles the individual's own gangliosides such that antibodies formed against the foreign antigen attack both that antigen and the patient's neural tissue. The result is an acute inflammation of the ventral nerve roots and subsequent demyelination with or without axonal degeneration. This results in the clinical signs of diffuse neuromuscular disease. Treatment is supportive, including adequate cushioning, frequent turning, and feeding in an upright position. The majority of dogs will recover in weeks to several months.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{standardize}} and evaluate the results of evoked electromyography (EEMG) in normal patients and in patients with <b>acute</b> <b>idiopathic</b> facial paralysis. A comparison of the amplitude of response to EEMG from one side of the face to the other in 288 normal patients yielded a great variability in results. The amplitude difference was not greater than SO%, and therefore a difference of less than 50 % was considered normal. Test-retest variability of the percentage differ-ence in amplitude in 10 subjects showed a 10 % variation in seven pa-tients and up to a 20 % variation in the remaining three patients. Fifty patients with <b>acute</b> <b>idiopathic</b> facial paralysis were seen within 14 days of onset. A favorable prognosis was based on an EEMG amplitude of more than 25 % of the normal side. With this criterion EEMG was accurate in predicting complete recovery in 36 (92 %) of 39 patients. When EEMG was 25 % of normal or less, incomplete recovery occurred in 9 (82 %) of 11 patients. The response was 0 % to 10 % in six patients; four had a poor recovery and the remaining two had a fair recovery.

40|$|Purpose: To report {{multimodality}} {{diagnostic imaging}} {{in a case}} of unilateral <b>acute</b> <b>idiopathic</b> maculopathy. Case summary: A 32 -year-old woman with reduced vision in the right eye had experienced fatigue and flu-like symptoms, includ-ing sore throat and fever a few days before. Her best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 1. 0 in the right eye. There were no cells in the anterior chamber and vitreous. Fundus photographs of the right eye on presentation showed gray-white thickening of the fovea and retinal hemorrhage next to the fovea. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated ring-shaped mottled hyperfluorescence in the early phase and dye pooling in the late phase. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed abnormal hyper-reflective thickening {{at the level of the}} outer retina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and detachment of the neuro-sensory retina in the foveal lesion. The inner segment/outer segment junction and photoreceptor elevation/disruption was noted. Nineteen months after onset, the BCVA of the right eye was 1. 0 and fundus photographs showed increased retinal pigment hy-perplasia, and residual RPE changes resembling a bull’s eye maculopathy. The OCT of the right macula showed that the inner segment/outer segment junction elevation/disruption almost completely regressed.

40|$|Objective: To {{conduct a}} {{systematic}} review and meta-analysis on {{the prognosis of}} <b>acute</b> <b>idiopathic</b> neck pain and disability. Data Sources: EMBASE, CINAHL, Medline, AMED, PEDro, and CENTRAL were searched from inception to July 2009, limited to human studies. Reference lists of relevant systematic reviews were searched by hand. Search terms included: neck pain, prognosis, inception, cohort, longitudinal, observational, or prospective study and randomized controlled trial. Study Selection: Eligible studies were longitudinal cohort studies and randomized controlled trials with a no treatment or minimal treatment arm that recruited an inception cohort of <b>acute</b> <b>idiopathic</b> neck pain and reported pain or disability outcomes. Eligibility was determined by 2 authors independently. Seven of 20, 085 references were included. Data Extraction: Pain and disability data were extracted independently by 2 authors. Risk of bias was assessed independently by 2 authors. Data Synthesis: Statistical pooling showed a weighted mean pain score (0100) of 64 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 6167) at onset and 35 (95 % CI, 3238) at 6. 5 weeks. At 12 months, neck pain severity remained high at 42 (95 % CI, 3945). Disability reduced from a pooled weighted mean score (0100) at onset of 30 (95 % CI, 2832) to 17 (95 % CI, 1519) by 6. 5 weeks, without further improvement at 12 months. Studies varied in length of follow-up, design, and sample size. Conclusions: This review provides Level I evidence that the prognosis of <b>acute</b> <b>idiopathic</b> neck pain is worse than currently recognized.

The analysis of relationships among protein Q has been performed by total and multiple regressions and the actual BCB permeability to individual proteins has been interpreted according to the accepted theoretical porous or vesicular BCB models. The exponential Q-IgG vs. Q-albumin total regression, and the poor Q-alpha 2 -macroglobulin vs. Q-albumin regression found in controls, together with the different multiple regressions among proteins and the high Q-IgG vs. Q-albumin partial regression coefficients found in medullary compression, <b>acute</b> <b>idiopathic</b> polyneuropathy and <b>acute</b> meningoencephalitis, indicated that different permeability mechanisms can be postulated. Heterogeneous, fairly independent permeability BCB mechanisms maintain the normal CSF/serum protein concentration gradient. Pinocytotic vesicles or pores of radius exceeding 1000 - 1500 A, probably located at the capillary endothelium, account for the main serum-derived CSF protein fraction(s) with large hydrodynamic radius (R). A more selective endothelial vesicular transport with a radius of 250 A transfers a negligible amount of protein from serum into CSF. Proteins with small R also enter the CSF {{through a set of}} selective pores of radius 120 A, probably {{at the level of the}} choroidal epithelium. Pinocytotic vesicles with a radius of 250 A and increased rate of formation induce the accumulation of proteins below an obstruction of lumbar CSF flow. An increased formation rate of vesicles with a radius of 450 A can explain the increased capillary permeability in nerve roots in <b>acute</b> <b>idiopathic</b> polyneuropathy. Loss of selectivity was the main feature of BCB in acute meningoencephalitis, and it seemed to be due to pores or vesicles with a radius larger than 1000 - 1500 A. The heterogeneity of BCB mechanisms must be taken into account when the intrathecal synthesis of a protein, also derived from serum (for example IgG), has to be measured...|$|R
40|$|The immune {{responses}} of 100 patients who presented with an <b>acute</b> <b>idiopathic</b> neuropathy {{were compared with}} those of age and sex matched controls. Blood lymphocytes and their subsets were counted with a fluorescent activated cell sorter. CD 8 + (putative suppressor) lymphocytes were significantly reduced {{in the first week of}} the disease but total lymphocytes, total T and CD 4 + (putative helper) cells were not altered. This reduction depended on the nature of the preceding infection. Serum complement C 3 and C 4 concentrations remained normal and immune complexes were rarely detected with a C 1 q binding assay. Complement-fixing antibodies to human peripheral nerve antigens were discovered in the serum of 7 % of patients but only 1 % of controls. Complement-fixing antibodies to galactocerebroside were not discovered in any sera. Enzyme-linked immunoassays detected increased antibody responses to galactocerebroside but none at all to human P 2 myelin protein in the patient sera.
