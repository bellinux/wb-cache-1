In response to the 225 incidents, residents of Wiltshire called for the formation of a police force similar to Robert Peel's Metropolitan Police force, whose 'A' division had visited in 1836 to help control riots. When the County Police Act 1839 was introduced, Wiltshire leapt <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> form a police force. As a result, Wiltshire Constabulary was established on Wednesday 13 November 1839 at The Bear Hotel, Devizes and was the first county police force to be formed, beating Gloucestershire by a few hours.|$|E
25|$|At {{the opening}} of the tale, Salieri is an old man, having long outlived his fame. Speaking {{directly}} to the audience, he claims to have used poison to assassinate Mozart, and promises to explain himself. The action then flashes back to the eighteenth century, at a time when Salieri has not met Mozart in person, but has heard of him and his music. He adores Mozart's compositions, and is thrilled <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> meet Mozart in person, during a salon at which some of Mozart's compositions will be played. When he finally does catch sight of Mozart, however, he is deeply disappointed to find that Mozart himself lacks the grace and charm of his compositions: When Salieri first meets him, Mozart is crawling around on his hands and knees, engaging in profane talk with his future bride Constanze Weber.|$|E
25|$|Bourguiba, {{worried about}} his country's state, knew that a good cause would revive the {{national}} movement, weakened by the 1926 repressions.

Bourguiba jumped <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> rally the bourgeoisie class to the nationalist cause. But his attempt failed and ended up dividing L'Action team. In this context, the uprising following the Tunisian naturalization issue, in early 1933, was the perfect opportunity for him. He started another successful press campaign. With his friends Tahar Sfar, Mahmoud El Materi, Bahri Guiga and his brother M'hamed, they sensitized lower classes to their cause and changed the Residence policy. The popularity he acquired during the event, led to his election as a member of the executive committee of the Destour, in May 1933. However, differences with the elders caused him to resign from the party in September 1933.|$|E

500|$|As each {{episode of}} Inside No. 9 {{features}} new characters, the writers {{were able to}} attract actors {{who may have been}} unwilling to commit to an entire series.

The fact that Pemberton and Shearsmith only played a single character in each story was a change for them; in The League of Gentlemen, the pair have played some 30 characters each, while, in Psychoville, they had played around five each. Though Pemberton and Shearsmith generally starred in each episode, they did not necessarily take on the main roles.

500|$|Wider {{recognition}} came to Murphy in 2005 when he starred as Dr. Jonathan Crane in Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins. Originally {{asked to}} audition {{for the role of}} Bruce Wayne/Batman in Batman Begins, Murphy never saw himself as having the right physique for the superhero, but leapt <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> connect with director Christopher Nolan. Though the lead went to Christian Bale, Nolan was so impressed with Murphy that he gave him the supporting role of Dr. Jonathan Crane, whose alter ego is supervillain Scarecrow. Nolan told Spin, [...] "He has the most extraordinary eyes, and I kept trying to invent excuses for him to take his glasses off in close-ups." [...] Murphy achieved further mainstream success that year by portraying operative Jackson Rippner who terrorises Rachel McAdams on an overnight flight in Wes Craven's thriller, Red Eye. New York Times film critic Manohla Dargis asserted that Murphy made [...] "a picture-perfect villain" [...] and that his [...] "baby blues look cold enough to freeze water and his wolfish leer suggests its own terrors". The film was favourably reviewed and earned almost $100 million worldwide.|$|E

500|$|Dreamwave Productions {{shut down}} on January 4, 2005, and {{announced}} they would cease publication {{of all their}} comics, leaving [...] and its prequel series, [...] incomplete. Chris Ryall, editor-in-chief of IDW Publishing, leaped <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> bid on the property. On May 19, 2005, Hasbro announced they had awarded the licensing rights to IDW Publishing, with plans for an issue #0 in October 2005 and an ongoing title entitled [...] to begin in January 2006. Beforehand, Ryall met up with long-time writer Simon Furman. Furman aimed for a contemporary version of the [...] incarnation to appeal to new and old fans alike. They both cited {{a focus on the}} [...] "Robots in Disguise" [...] element of the characters, aiming to bring back their [...] "myth and majesty". Overall, Furman described it as, [...] "This was, at last (after 20-plus years) MY take on Transformers." [...] Furman also aimed for a real time approach, using maps to help guide his stories. Infiltrations issue #0 sold 100,000 copies in pre-orders, a record for the company. Furman focused the story on Autobot medic Ratchet and broke new ground for G1-based storylines by excluding the Ark crash storyline, to give proper intent to the Transformers being on Earth, thus separating the fictional universe from the Beast Wars one. E. J. Su was hired as the artist, and was given free rein to re-design characters slightly.|$|E

Zombie's film would combine the elements of prequel and remake with the original concept, with considerable original content in the new film. Zombie also wanted to reinvent the character, as he felt Michael, along with Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, and Pinhead, had become too familiar to audiences, and as a result, less scary. Zombie delved deeper into Michael Myers's mythology. Michael's mask was even given its own story to provide an explanation as to why he wears it, instead of having the character simply steal a random mask from a hardware store, as in the original film. Zombie wanted to bring Michael closer to what a psychopath really is, and wanted the mask to be a way for Michael to hide.|$|E
500|$|Burton's {{portrayal}} of Dylan has been generally well received. The character's romance with Chelsea Lawson (Melissa Claire Egan), however, garnered a negative response from viewers and critics alike. Luke Kerr of Zap2it wrote that their storyline was [...] "everyone’s favorite storyline for curing insomnia". Despite negative reviews, Burton's portrayal during the storyline was praised, specifically by journalist Connie Passalacqua Hayman, who wrote: [...] "But it was Steve Burton as Dylan who {{stole the show}} with Dylan’s tearful and very sensitive reaction to the news, as his character loves what he believed to be his baby very much." [...] When {{the truth about the}} paternity of Chelsea's child was revealed, Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps remarked (in reference to Burton), [...] "When the truth came out it provided some meaty material for this fan favorite." [...] Sara Bibel of Xfinity gave a mixed review when Dylan was revealed as Nikki's son, writing: [...] "However, the foreshadowing that Dylan (Steve Burton) is going to turn out to be Nikki’s long-lost son is so heavy-handed that it seems hard to believe that the show is going in any other direction. Dylan is the right age. He looks like he could be related to Nikki. The character is in desperate need of a more ties to the canvas; being Avery’s ex is not enough to keep him in town, much less front-and-center. My big objection to this twist is, what’s the actual story? We have spent months learning every single thing about this character who probably would not exist if Y hadn’t jumped <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> poach Burton from GH." [...] She added: [...] "Dylan would get a mother to replace his father that passed away. Nikki would get a child who can use his carpentry skills to build her a nice bookcase. That’s sweet, but it’s a situation, not a plot. There really aren’t any consequences. Nick would be angry that the guy he’s convinced Avery still loves is his half-brother, but he already has one half-brother he despises. Another one really isn’t a big deal." [...] Burton's portrayal earned him a nomination for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2014 and 2016.|$|E
