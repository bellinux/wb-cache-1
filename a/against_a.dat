In 1909, the first annual first-class match between Ireland and Scotland was held, and an annual match against the MCC was arranged from 1924 onwards.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper solves several {{fundamental}} open problems about statistical zero-knowledge interactive proofs (SZKIPs). The {{following two}} theorems are proven: •If language L has a statistical zero-knowledge interactive proof <b>against</b> <b>an</b> honest verifier, then L has a statistical zero-knowledge “public-coin” interactive proof <b>against</b> <b>an</b> honest verifier. (Theorem 1) •If L has a statistical zero-knowledge public-coin interactive proof <b>against</b> <b>an</b> honest verifier then “the complement of L” has a statistical zero-knowledge constant (one) round interactive proof <b>against</b> <b>an</b> honest verifier. (Theorem 2) The following corollaries are obtained directly {{from these two}} theorems and the recent result by Goldreich, Sahai, and Vadhan (1998, “Proc. of STOC,” pp. 409 – 418). •[Public-coin SZKIP=Private-coin SZKIP]. [Honest verifier SZKIP=Any verifier SZKIP]. If L has a statistical zero-knowledge interactive proof <b>against</b> <b>an</b> “honest verifier,” then L has a statistical zero-knowledge public-coin interactive proof against “any verifier. ” •[SZKIP=co-SZKIP]. If L has a statistical zero-knowledge interactive proof, then the “complement” of L has a statistical zero-knowledge (public-coin) interactive proof. •[Bounded round SZKIP=Unbounded round SZKIP]. If L has a statistical zero-knowledge interactive proof, then L has a statistical zero-knowledge “constant (one) round” interactive proof <b>against</b> <b>an</b> honest verifier. •[Black-box simulation SZKIP=Auxiliary-input SZKIP]. If L has a statistical “auxiliary-input” zero-knowledge interactive proof, then L has a statistical “black-box simulation” zero-knowledge interactive proof...|$|R
