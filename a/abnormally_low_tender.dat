The aim of this thesis is a detailed analysis of the concept of <b>abnormally</b> <b>low</b> <b>tender</b> price {{with regard to}} the case law of administrative courts and the Office for the Protection of Competition. The analysis is made both in relation to the Public Procurement act and the EU Directive on public procurement. After an introductory part the thesis is divided into seven main chapters. The first chapter outlines basic terms necessary for comprehensive analysis of further discussed issues. Chapter two deals with the concept of <b>abnormally</b> <b>low</b> <b>tender</b> price including its evolution in the former public procurement law. The third chapter focuses on the process of assessment of the tenders concerning the <b>abnormally</b> <b>low</b> <b>tender</b> price. This chapter deals with the request for explanation of the tenderer's tender price, with requirements of this explanation and with assessment of this explanation made by evaluation committee. Chapter four examines the zero tender price and the case law of administrative courts regarding the correct procedure in case of occurrence of this price. This chapter takes [...] ...|$|E
40|$|I {{have chosen}} the theme of {{procurement}} because before my maternity leave I worked in the land office in the Ceske Budejovice and this issue {{was part of my}} job. After restarting my work in September, I will again concentrate on public procurement. In my work I focused on prices of outcompeted procurements and <b>abnormally</b> <b>low</b> <b>tender</b> prices, which is currently being a lively debated topic. In the first part I compare financing of procurements of land reform in South Bohemia in relation to the prices in other regions of the Czech Republic between 2013 and 2014. In the second part, after a brief comparison of the prices of contracts during 10 years (2003, 2004 and 2013, 2014), I assess <b>abnormally</b> <b>low</b> <b>tender</b> prices by means of objectively assessable criteria with regard to transparency in public procurement...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the problem of}} <b>abnormally</b> <b>low</b> <b>tenders</b> in the procurement process. Limited liability causes firms in a bad financial situation to bid more aggressively than good firms in the procurement auction. Therefore, {{it is more likely}} that the winning firm is a firm in financial difficulties with a high risk of bankruptcy. The paper {{analyzes the}} different regulatory practices to face this problem with a special emphasis on surety bonds used e. g. in the US. We characterize the optimal surety bond and show that it does not coincide with the current US regulation. In particular we show that under a natural assumption the US regulation is too expensive and provides overinsurance to the problem of <b>abnormally</b> <b>low</b> <b>tenders.</b> Procurement, bankruptcy, <b>abnormally</b> <b>low</b> <b>tenders,</b> regulation...|$|R

40|$|Public {{procurement}} {{faces the}} risk that the contractor goes bankrupt before the completion of the work. The possibility to declare bankruptcy makes the contractors behave more aggressively. This leads to <b>abnormally</b> <b>low</b> <b>tenders</b> and to the break-down of revenue equivalence. Upon this result we investigate frequently used public procurement methods that were designed to avoid the bankruptcy of the winning contractor. We show that the averagebid-method or methods that exclude the lowest offer fare quite badly. We also show that — in contrast to standard auction theory — multi-sourcing, rationing and other means to soften competition may fare better than a standard auction. ...|$|R
40|$|Surety {{bonds are}} {{instruments}} used {{in public and}} private procurement to avoid the problem of contractor bankruptcy. A surety company issuing such a bond guarantees to either finish the project itself or pay the bond to the procurement agency in case of contractor's bankruptcy. This situation is analysed under the assumption that the bond is either priced fairly, or a risk loading that is proportional to the money at risk is imposed. If the surety is priced fairly, full insurance (or even overinsurance) is optimal. If the surety is priced unfairly, more solvent contractors are more likely to win, thus the problem of <b>abnormally</b> <b>low</b> <b>tenders</b> is alleviated. ...|$|R
40|$|We study optimal {{procurement}} in {{the presence}} of default risk. Contractors differ in the penalty they suffer in case of default, which is private information. If the loss to the procurer from non-completion is high relative to the cost of completion, the optimal mechanism is to assign the project by a fair lottery. The procurer pays the winner enough so that the project is always completed and extracts contractors' surplus by charging them participation fees. When the loss to the procurer from non-completion is low relative to the cost of completion, the project is assigned to the contractor with the highest probability of default; that is, the one with the lowest defaulting penalty. The optimal probability of default is inefficiently low: projects that would be first-best efficient not to complete are completed.

40|$|The first aim of {{this study}} is to examine what the {{differences}} are between the Classic directive (directive 2004 / 18 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts) and the Revised Classic directive (directive 2014 / 24 /EU of the European Parliament and of the council of 26 February 2014 on public procurement and repealing Directive 2004 / 18 /EC) when it comes to social considerations in public procurement. The second aim is to examine if the revision of the directive has solved the prior existing problems regarding social considerations in public procurement. In this paper a traditional European legal method is used. The examinations show a number of things, including the Revised Classic directive involving codification of case law, references to other sources of law and some clarified rules as well as new provisions. The regulations regarding reserved contracts, technical specifications, and selection criterion are satisfied in the Revised Classic directive. Certain changes and clarifications are still required in regards to the regulations of exclusions grounds, contract award criterion and <b>abnormally</b> <b>low</b> <b>tenders.</b> The facet of the directive which requires the most significant clarification is regarding the conditions for performance of contracts.     Keywords: public procurement, social considerations, socially responsible public procuremen...|$|R

40|$|Evapotranspiration (ET) is an {{important}} component of the wetland water budget. Water level declines in Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China, have caused concerns, especially during low water levels. However, how wetland ET and its partitioning respond to <b>abnormally</b> <b>low</b> water levels is unclear. In this study, wetland ET was estimated with MODIS data and meteorological data. The wetland ET partitioning and its relationship with <b>abnormally</b> <b>low</b> water levels were analyzed for 2000 – 2013. The results showed that the water evaporation rate (Ewater) was larger than the land ET rate (ETland); the ETland/Ewater ranged from 0. 77 to 0. 99. When the water level was below 12. 8 [*]m, the ET partition ratio was larger than 1, which indicates that wetland ET comes from land surface ET more than water evaporation. The negative standardized water level index (SWI) was used to represent an <b>abnormally</b> <b>low</b> water level in the wetland. Although the monthly wetland ET decreased as the negative SWI decreased, ETland was higher than the average under negative SWI conditions from September to December, when the water level decreased. The <b>abnormally</b> <b>low</b> water level induced more water loss from the land surface, especially when the water level decreased, which reduced the available water resources along the wetland shore...|$|R
