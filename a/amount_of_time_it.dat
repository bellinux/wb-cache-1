5|$|Professor Layton's London Life {{is based}} on another Level-5 title, Fantasy Life. London Life can only be played after {{completing}} the Japanese version of the main game Last Specter, but is accessible {{from the beginning of}} the game in North American and Australian versions of the game. The European versions do not include London Life, because the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> would take to translate the game would otherwise have prevented the game from being released before the end of 2011.|$|E
5|$|Over the years, {{there have}} been various small controversies, the most infamous being the scandal {{involving}} the Steinmetz High School team, which was caught cheating at the 1995 Illinois state finals. This event was later dramatized in the 2000 film Cheaters. Academic Decathlon has been criticized by educators for the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> requires students to spend on the material, as it constitutes an entire curriculum beyond the one provided by the school. Around {{the turn of the}} millennium, several coaches protested the USAD's decision to publish error-ridden Resource Guides rather than provide topics for students to research.|$|E
5|$|The Volt {{features}} OnStar Mobile {{application for}} owners to access vehicle information without being {{in or near}} the car. This smartphone application features the ability to check fuel efficiency as well as the vehicle's current electric range. It also helps monitor the charging, giving owners key information about the current charge level and the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> will take until it is fully charged. The application also is able to control features such as locking/unlocking doors, and acts as a remote starter. A five-year OnStar Directions and Connections service was bundled into the 2011 Volt's base price, which was reduced to three years for the 2012 model year.|$|E

50|$|There is no {{requirement}} that the system be used only when attempting to overtake another car. For example, a driver may choose to operate the system in order to defend a position.

5|$|The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> {{typically}} takes {{a piercing}} to heal varies widely {{according to the}} placement of the piercing. Genital piercings can be among the quicker to heal, with piercings of the clitoral hood and Prince Albert piercings healing in as little as a month, though some may take longer. Navel piercings can be the slowest to heal, with one source reporting a range of six months to two full years. The prolonged healing of navel piercings may be connected to clothing friction.|$|E
5|$|Dowding saw 12 Group as the {{protector}} of the Midlands and a reserve for 11 Group. Mallory and Bader wanted to ignore both the defence of the Midlands and keeping a reserve in order to commit 12 Group to battle. In essence, they proposed the opposite of Dowding and resolved to commit the reserves before the front-line units. While this method might have spared 11 Group, it had its problems. Although Mallory and Bader wanted to stop the enemy before it hit RAF airfields, the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> took to position large formations for interception meant that the Big Wing often failed to achieve this. Instead, they engaged the enemy as he withdrew. Prompted by a supporting comment from Leigh-Mallory, {{to the effect that}} it did not matter when an interception was made, as long as it accounted for a large number of enemy aircraft, Bader announced that he would rather destroy 50 German bombers after hitting their targets than 10 before. The argument was strong; crippling losses would act as a deterrent, so that damage sustained on an occasion when the Germans did get through would have to be offset against later occasions when they did not even care to try.|$|E
5|$|Protein folding {{does not}} occur in one step. Instead, {{proteins}} {{spend most of their}} folding time, nearly 96% in some cases, waiting in various intermediate conformational states, each a local thermodynamic free energy minimum in the protein's energy landscape. Through a process known as adaptive sampling, these conformations are used by Folding@home as starting points for a set of simulation trajectories. As the simulations discover more conformations, the trajectories are restarted from them, and a Markov state model (MSM) is gradually created from this cyclic process. MSMs are discrete-time master equation models which describe a biomolecule's conformational and energy landscape as a set of distinct structures and the short transitions between them. The adaptive sampling Markov state model method significantly increases the efficiency of simulation as it avoids computation inside the local energy minimum itself, and is amenable to distributed computing (including on GPUGRID) as it allows for the statistical aggregation of short, independent simulation trajectories. The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> takes to construct a Markov state model is inversely proportional to the number of parallel simulations run, i.e., the number of processors available. In other words, it achieves linear parallelization, leading to an approximately four orders of magnitude reduction in overall serial calculation time. A completed MSM may contain tens of thousands of sample states from the protein's phase space (all the conformations a protein can take on) and the transitions between them. The model illustrates folding events and pathways (i.e., routes) and researchers can later use kinetic clustering to view a coarse-grained representation of the otherwise highly detailed model. They can use these MSMs to reveal how proteins misfold and to quantitatively compare simulations with experiments.|$|E

25|$|Trypsin {{can be used}} {{to break}} down casein in breast milk. If trypsin is added to a {{solution}} of milk powder, the breakdown of casein will cause the milk to become translucent.

25|$|Distance {{may also}} be {{measured}} {{as a function of}} time. The radar mile is the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> takes for a radar pulse to travel one nautical mile, reflect off a target, and return to the radar antenna. Since a nautical mile is defined as 1,852m, then dividing this distance by the speed of light (299,792,458m/s), and then multiplying the result by 2 yields a result of 12.36μs in duration.|$|E

25|$|The first {{practical}} application for piezoelectric devices was sonar, first developed during World War I. In France in 1917, Paul Langevin {{and his coworkers}} developed an ultrasonic submarine detector. The detector consisted of a transducer, made of thin quartz crystals carefully glued between two steel plates, and a hydrophone to detect the returned echo. By emitting a high-frequency pulse from the transducer, and measuring the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> takes to hear an echo from the sound waves bouncing off an object, one can calculate the distance to that object.|$|E
25|$|The {{length of}} each period is {{determined}} by the rate of change and the required change in gain. For more intuitive operation, a compressor's attack and release controls are labeled as a unit of time (often milliseconds). This is the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> takes for the gain to change a set amount of dB, decided by the manufacturer—often 10dB. For example, if the compressor's time constants are referenced to 10dB, and the attack time is set to 1ms, it takes 1ms for the gain to decrease by 10dB, and 2ms to decrease by 20dB.|$|E
25|$|A fish’s hypoxia {{tolerance}} {{can also}} be represented as the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> can spend at a particular hypoxic PO2 before it loses dorsal-ventral equilibrium (called time-to-LOE), or the PO2 at which it loses equilibrium when PO2 is decreased from normoxia to anoxia at some set rate (called PO2-of-LOE). A higher time-to-LOE value or a lower PO2-of-LOE value therefore imply enhanced hypoxia tolerances. In either case, LOE is a more holistic representation of overall hypoxia tolerance because it incorporates all contributors to hypoxia tolerance, including aerobic metabolism, anaerobic metabolism and metabolic suppression.|$|E

50|$|Chapter 1Every man in {{a culture}} has three levels of {{conscious}} reflection: his specific ideas about things, his general beliefs, and his metaphysical dream. The first constitutes his worldliness, the second is applied to certain choices as they present themselves and the third {{which is the most}} important is his intuitive feeling about the immanent nature of reality. Without this it is impossible to live together harmoniously for prolonged <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> <b>It</b> is also his attitude toward the world and is the most important fact about a person.|$|R

25|$|Of the Australian oncomerines, {{the bronze}} orange bug (Musgraveia sulciventris) {{is the only}} species {{unequivocally}} documented to lack maternal brooding behavior. This peculiarity might {{be connected to the}} unreliability of the food plant availability for the species (Monteith, 2011). Unlike other oncomerines who can only lay one egg clutch for the certain <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> takes to care for them, M. sulciventris can produce multiple egg clutches rapidly because females don't have to care for them. This allows M. sulciventris to rapidly expand their population when conditions are favorable.|$|E
25|$|Smallholding farmers {{not only}} {{frequently}} lack access to markets, they lack {{access to resources}} that lead to sustainable cocoa farming practices. Lack of sustainability can be due to pests, diseases that attack cocoa trees, lack of farming supplies, and {{lack of knowledge about}} modern farming techniques. One issue pertaining to cocoa plantation sustainability is the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> takes for a cocoa tree to produce pods. A solution to this is to change the type of cocoa tree being farmed. In Ghana, a hybrid cocoa tree yields two crops after three years rather than the typical one crop after five years.|$|E
25|$|Males of {{some species}} use bodily fluids, such as seminal fluid from their ejaculate, {{to aid in}} the {{coercion}} of females. Seminal fluid in males of Drosophila melanogaster may contain chemicals that increase the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> takes for females to remate, decrease the length of successive matings, or keep her from remating at all. The less a female mates with other males after copulation with a male, {{the more likely it is}} for him to ensure his paternity. These chemicals may also serve to increase the female’s reproductive success, but at the cost of decreased longevity and immune response.|$|E

In this combined form Hakuou forms the upper body whilst Kokuryu forms the legs (a fact Kokuryu was less than happy about), with the overall form being of giant size. It is incredibly powerful but currently Kokuryu and Hakuou can only form it for a short <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> <b>Its</b> attack is Mohican. When facing Kyouji, the pair reversed the combination with Kokuryu now serving as the upper body and Hakuou as the legs.|$|R
5000|$|In education, cramming (also {{known as}} mugging or swotting, from, akin to [...] "sweat", meaning [...] "to study with determination") is the {{practice}} of working intensively to absorb large volumes of informational material in short <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> <b>It</b> is often done by students in preparation for upcoming exams, especially at the last minute. Cramming is often discouraged by educators because the hurried coverage of material tends to result in poor long-term retention of material, a phenomenon {{often referred to as}} the spacing effect. When cramming, one attempts to focus only on studies and to forgo unnecessary actions or habits.|$|R

25|$|Once a naval {{battle was}} underway, {{for the men}} involved, there were {{numerous}} ways for them to meet their end. Drowning {{was perhaps the most}} common way for a crew member to perish. Once a trireme had been rammed, the ensuing panic that engulfed the men trapped below deck no doubt extended the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> took the men to escape. Inclement weather would greatly decrease the crew's odds of survival, leading to a situation like that off Cape Athos in 411 (12 of 10,000 men were saved). An estimated 40,000 Persians died in the Battle of Salamis. In the Peloponnesian War, after the Battle of Arginusae, six Athenian generals were executed for failing to rescue several hundred of their men clinging to wreckage in the water.|$|E
25|$|Tubal {{pregnancy}} {{is when the}} egg is implanted in the Fallopian tubes. Hair-like cilia located on the internal surface of the Fallopian tubes carry the fertilized egg to the uterus. Fallopian cilia are sometimes seen in reduced numbers subsequent to an ectopic pregnancy, leading to a hypothesis that cilia damage in the Fallopian tubes is {{likely to lead to}} an ectopic pregnancy. Women who smoke have a higher chance of an ectopic pregnancy in the fallopian tubes. Smoking leads to risk factors of damaging and or killing cilia. As cilia degenerate the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> takes for the fertilized egg to reach the uterus will increase. The fertilized egg, if it doesn't reach the uterus in time, will hatch from the non-adhesive zona pellucida and implant itself inside the fallopian tube, thus causing the pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|The first {{island of}} {{stability}} {{is expected to}} be centered on unbibium-306 (with 122 protons and 184 neutrons), and the second {{is expected to be}} centered on unhexquadium-482 (with 164 protons and 318 neutrons). This second island of stability should confer additional stability on elements 152–168; on the other hand, due to the enormously greater forces of electromagnetic repulsion that must be overcome by the strong force at this second island, it is possible that nuclei around this region only exist as resonances and cannot stay together for a meaningful <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> <b>It</b> is also possible that some of the superactinides between these series may not actually exist because they are too far from both islands, in which case the periodic table would quite possibly end around Z = 130 instead of 173, with nuclear properties imposing an end earlier than the electronic properties.|$|E
