It was a passive stereoscopic 3D system that utilized spectral comb filters produced using thin-film optics technology. In such systems, the visible spectrum is broken into alternate bands of light that evenly span the entire visible spectrum.|$|E
5|$|Carbohydrates are {{classified}} {{according to their}} glycemic index, <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>for</b> measuring how quickly a food that is eaten raises blood sugar levels, and glycemic load, which takes into account both the glycemic index {{and the amount of}} carbohydrate in the food. This has led to carbohydrate counting, a method used by diabetics for planning their meals.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1950s, Charles H. Zimmerman of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) {{developed}} <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>for</b> {{control of a}} rotorcraft in which, with the rotors mounted {{on the underside of}} the aircraft, the machine could be steered by the pilot through the simple shifting of his weight, and kept stable through the actions of his natural reflexes. Known as kinesthetic control, and similar in principle to the mechanics of riding a bicycle or a surfboard, it was hoped that the concept would allow for pilots to operate an aircraft with little to no training time. NACA testing proved that the idea had merit, and several companies, including Bensen Aircraft, Hiller Aircraft, and de Lackner Helicopters, began development of rotorcraft using the concept.|$|E

5|$|Ecclesiastical {{heraldry}} {{refers to}} the use of heraldry within the Christian Church for dioceses and Christian clergy. Initially used to mark documents, ecclesiastical heraldry evolved as <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>for</b> identifying people and dioceses. It is most formalized within the Catholic Church, where most bishops, including the Pope, have a personal coat of arms. Clergy in Anglican, Lutheran, Eastern Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches follow similar customs, as do institutions such as schools and dioceses.|$|E
5|$|IUPAC {{also has}} <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>for</b> giving codes to {{identify}} amino acids and nucleotide bases. IUPAC needed a coding system that represented long sequences of amino acids. This {{would allow for}} these sequences to be compared {{to try to find}} homologies. These codes can consist of either a one letter code or a three letter code.|$|E
5|$|On October 1, 1938, Skelton {{replaced}} Red Foley as {{the host}} of Avalon Time on NBC; Edna also joined the show's cast, under her maiden name. She developed <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>for</b> working with the show's writers: selecting material from them, adding her own and filing the unused bits and lines for future use; the Skeltons worked on Avalon Time until late 1939. Skelton's work in films led to a new regular radio show offer; between films, he promoted himself and MGM by appearing without charge at Los Angeles area banquets. A radio advertising agent was a guest {{at one of his}} banquet performances and recommended Skelton to one of his clients.|$|E

5|$|The Murrah Federal Building {{had been}} {{considered}} so safe that it only employed one security guard. In June 1995, the DOJ issued Vulnerability Assessment of Federal Facilities, also known as The Marshals Report, the findings of {{which resulted in a}} thorough evaluation of security at all federal buildings and <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>for</b> classifying risks at over 1,300federal facilities owned or leased by the federal government. Federal sites were divided into five security levels ranging from Level 1 (minimum security needs) to Level 5 (maximum). The Alfred P. Murrah Building was deemed a Level 4 building. Among the 52security improvements were physical barriers, closed-circuit television monitoring, site planning and access, hardening of building exteriors to increase blast resistance, glazing systems to reduce flying glass shards and fatalities, and structural engineering design to prevent progressive collapse.|$|E
5|$|The geology in Dwarf Fortress {{is fairly}} accurate. Rocks like olivine or gabbro can be dug up. The topmost layer usually {{consists}} of sand, clay or plain soil—this {{can be used}} for underground farming. Deeper levels will be layers of rock; minerals appear in layers or clusters around the right depth. Gems like tourmalines appear in rare clusters. Water is simulated like falling sand, every space can contain up to seven levels of it. A tile having one level of water is the lowest, while a tile with seven is full. There is <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>for</b> simulating temperature and heat. Fires can spread and burn dwarves and furniture. There are four basic seasons in an in-game year: spring, summer, autumn and winter.|$|E
5|$|Capcom auditioned {{actors to}} be used as {{references}} by the character designers. The faces of the main protagonists were shaped and based on real people, while motion capture was used to animate their models. About 60 percent of the characters' motions were animated based on the captured data, while the rest was created from scratch. The developers initially struggled to develop <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>for</b> computer graphic animation. However, Nintendo provided Capcom with assistance and the problems were eventually solved. Capcom also hired new voice actors and rewrote the game's script to make the plot more convincing. The game was developed over the course of one year and two months. Final development of the game was very intense, as programmers had to work for two straight months with no days off to meet the proposed deadline. Resident Evil was released in March 2002 in Japan, April 2002 in North America, and September 2002 in Europe.|$|E

5|$|Clergy of the Church of England {{who were}} not bishops {{historically}} bore arms identical to a layman, with a shield, helm and crest, and no ecclesiastical hat. In England in 1976 <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>for</b> deans, archdeacons and canons was authorized by the College of Arms, allowing a black ecclesiastical hat, black or violet cords, and three violet or red tassels on each side. A priest uses {{a black and white}} cord with a single tassel on each side, and a deacon a hat without tassels. A Doctor of Divinity may have cords interwoven with red and a hat appropriate to the degree, and members of the Ecclesiastical Household add a Tudor rose {{on the front of the}} hat. According to Boutell's Heraldry, this system represents the practice of the Church in England in the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|The Saudi {{system of}} justice {{has been criticized for}} being slow, arcane, lacking in some of the {{safeguards}} of justice and unable to deal with the modern world. In 2007, King Abdullah issued royal decrees with the aim of reforming the judiciary and creating a new court system. The reforms have yet to be implemented in full but, once they are, will include the creation of a Supreme Court and the transfer of the Board of Grievances' commercial and criminal jurisdictions to a restructured general court system. New specialist first instance courts will be established comprising general, criminal, personal status, commercial and labor courts. The Sharia courts will therefore lose their general jurisdiction to hear all cases and the work load of the government's administrative tribunals will be transferred to the new courts. Another important change is the establishment of appeal courts for each province. It has been claimed that the reforms will establish <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>for</b> codifying Sharia and incorporating the principle of judicial precedent into court practice.|$|E
