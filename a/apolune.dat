50|$|As used in {{the space}} program, this refers not to the orbit of the Moon about the Earth, but to orbits by various manned or {{unmanned}} spacecraft around the Moon. The altitude at apoapsis (point farthest from the surface) for a lunar orbit is known as <b>apolune,</b> apocynthion or aposelene, while the periapsis (point closest to the surface) is known as perilune, pericynthion or periselene, from names or epithets of the moon goddess.|$|E

50|$|In season five, Gary {{has been}} arrested for Ciji's murder, and Lilimae learns that Chip is really a wanted {{criminal}} whose real name is Tony Fenice. Chip runs away with Diana, and is later found guilty of killing Ciji, resulting in the charges against Gary being dropped. Meanwhile, Sid and Abby's uncle died, leaving Abby and (by default) Karen land inheritance at Lotus Point, California. Without Karen's knowledge, Abby schemed to build a resort on the land while cutting Karen out of her plans. Abby then forms a company called <b>Apolune,</b> a secret subsidiary of Gary's corporation, and she convinces Gary to marry her so she can share his inheritance he got from his father's death. Valene begins a relationship with journalist Ben Gibson (Douglas Sheehan), but after a one-night stand with Gary, she learns she is pregnant with twins. Valene decides not to tell Gary {{that he is the}} father, as he was now married to Abby, and as she {{had fallen in love with}} Ben. However, Ben could not accept that Valene was pregnant with another man's children and he and Valene broke up. Abby hires a Ciji look-alike, Cathy Geary (also Lisa Hartman), to keep Gary distracted so he would not learn about her crooked business practices. The events surrounding Diana running away with Chip stresses Karen to point where she becomes addicted to prescription pain pills. Politician Greg Sumner (William Devane), an old college friend of Mack's who was running for U.S. Senator, received the endorsements of Mack and Karen, as well as Abby, who wanted to buy herself a senator. Greg hired Mack to lead his Senate Crime Commission investigating the sinister Wolfbridge Group, but when Abby convinced Greg to get her an illegal land variance to build on Lotus Point, Greg pinned it on Mack, thus ending their friendship. After Karen's recovery from her drug addiction, she and Diana recovered their relationship, after Diana returned to Knots Landing after Chip's sudden death. Wolfbridge forced Abby into making them her partners in the developments at Lotus Point. When Mack discovered that <b>Apolune</b> owned all the land in Lotus Point, except Karen and Abby's inheritances, he thought <b>Apolune</b> was a division of Wolfbridge. Laura confessed that <b>Apolune</b> was Abby's company and Gary decided to divorce Abby. When Mack faked Gary's death to get Wolfbridge, Karen left him, believing his obsession with Wolfbridge had cost them their marriage. In the season finale, Mack tried to trick Mark St. Claire (guest star Joseph Chapman), the head of the Wolfbridge Group, into trying to shoot Gary, but St. Claire's assassin hit Karen instead. Meanwhile, Abby was kidnapped by the Wolfbridge Group when they realized they had failed.|$|E
50|$|Launching from Centre Spatial Guyanais, Kourou in late 2018 on a Soyuz launcher, the Lander is {{injected}} into a Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO) by a Fregat-MT upper stage, {{through a series}} of intermediate orbits. Following Fregat separation, the lander uses its own propulsion to enter the final Lunar Transfer Orbit and, after an overall transfer time of several weeks, injects itself into a polar orbit around the Moon. After a series of <b>Apolune</b> and Perilune lowering manoeuvres, the Lander reaches its final Low Lunar Orbit (LLO) at 100 km altitude.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} {{lunar orbit}} for Apollo missions was planned as a nominal 60 nmi km circular orbit above the Moon's surface. Initial {{lunar orbit insertion}} was an ellipse with a perilune of 60.0 nmi km and an <b>apolune</b> of 168.5 nmi km, at an inclination of 12° from the lunar equator. This was then circularized at 60.7 nmi km by 59.7 nmi km, with an orbital period of 128.7 minutes. The effect of lunar mass concentrations ("masscons") on the orbit {{was found to be}} greater than initially predicted; {{over the course of the}} twenty-hour mission, the orbit was perturbated to 63.6 nmi km by 58.6 nmi km.|$|E
5000|$|Late in the mission, Chang'e 2's orbit {{was lowered}} to an {{elliptical}} one, {{with the same}} <b>apolune</b> (100 kilometers) as Chang'e 1, but with a perilune of only 15 kilometers. Tracking for the mission was performed with an X-band radio capability, which was not available for Chang'e 1. Zheng remarked that [...] "the mission goals of CE-2 were focused into the high resolution image for the future landing site of CE-3 lunar lander and rover. The key technology about soft landing on the Moon will be tested in the CE-2 mission. The success of CE-2 will provide an important technical basis for the successful implementation of China's future lunar exploration." ...|$|E

50|$|Gary soon married Abby, as she {{secretly}} {{started her}} own company, <b>Apolune.</b> After {{his marriage to}} Abby, Gary became the stepfather to Abby's children, Olivia and Brian, from Abby's first marriage to Jeff Cunningham. Gary then met Cathy Geary, who {{looked a lot like}} Ciji and began a new friendship with her and had her dress and sing like Ciji too. He also later had a relationship with Cathy. During a moment of weakness, Gary had a one night stand with his ex-wife, Val, and she became pregnant with twins, but Gary assumed that Val's fiancé and future husband, Ben Gibson, was the father. Val eventually named her twin babies as Bobby and Betsy in the 1985-86 season, after Gary's late brother Bobby and Ben Gibson's mother Betsy. Gary's marriage to Abby eventually broke down, and he got engaged to Jill Bennett, who later tried to kill Val. Gary and Val eventually reunited again, 8 years after their second divorce. Gary and Val also lived together with their children, Bobby and Betsy, for the first time, going on to marry each other {{for the third time in}} 1991 (Gary's fourth marriage, and Valene's fifth). In 1992, after Val was kidnapped by mafia gangsters in Florida and supposedly killed in a car crash after Gary had tracked her down, a grieving Gary entered into a short-term relationship with a much younger, Kate Whittaker, as she supported him and his children through their grief of losing Val. However, in the 2-part finale to Season 14 in 1993, Val turned up alive, revealing that she was never in the car that she was presumed to have died in. Gary was extremely happy at his wife still being alive, and they got back together.|$|E
40|$|Selene (re-named 'Kaguya' after launch) is an {{unmanned}} {{mission to the}} Moon navigated, in part, by JPL personnel. Launched by an H-IIA rocket on September 14, 2007 from Tanegashima Space Center, Kaguya entered a high, Earth-centered phasing orbit with apogee near the radius of the Moon's orbit. After 19 days and two orbits of Earth, Kaguya entered lunar orbit. Over the next 2 weeks the spacecraft decreased its <b>apolune</b> altitude until reaching a circular, 100 kilometer altitude orbit. This paper describes NASA/JPL's participation in the JAXA/Kaguya mission during that 5 week period, wherein JPL provided tracking data and orbit determination support for Kaguya...|$|E
40|$|A {{system for}} the {{launching}} of lunar derived oxygen or raw materials into low lunar orbit or to L 2 for transfer to low earth orbit is presented. The system described is a greatly simplified version of the conventional and sophisticated approach suggested by O'Neill using mass drivers with recirculating buckets. An electromagnetic accelerator {{is located on the}} lunar surface which launches 125 kg 'smart' containers of liquid oxygen or raw materials into a transfer orbit. Upon reaching <b>apolune</b> a kick motor is fired to circularize the orbit at 100 km altitude or L 2. These containers are collected and their payloads transferred to a tanker OTV. The empty containers then have their kick motors refurbished and then are returned to the launcher site on the lunar surface for reuse. Initial launch capability is designed for about 500 T of liquid oxygen delivered to low earth orbit per year with upgrading to higher levels, delivery of lunar soil for shielding, or raw materials for processing given the demand...|$|E
40|$|The lunar gravity field {{provides}} a way to research moon's evolution and probes the interior structure of the moon. It {{is an important factor}} influencing the lunar satellite precise orbit determination as well. The new lunar gravity model GL 0660 B from GRAIL mission dramatically improves the gravity spectrum and spectral ranges. Using the model GL 0660 B, it can be computed that the corresponding degree-wise RMS and correlation of topography, with which the quality of model GL 0660 B can be analyzed. Then different characters of the lunar gravity field comparing with other lunar gravity fields are analyzed. Besides, gravity anomaly distribution figures at different height of the models are given, and the character and difference of the lunar gravity models at different height are compared. In addition, lunar satellite orbit revolutionary at different height are modeled by GEODYN. The result shows that the trend of lunar satellite eccentricity changes is a complex and long cycle of change trend. It is different affected by the perturbation of the mascons of different height, which causes different changes of <b>apolune,</b> perilune and eccentricity...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the operations {{to control the}} Moon impact of the 3 -axis stabilized spacecraft SMART- 1 in September 2006. SMART- 1 was launched on 27 / 09 / 2003. It was the first ESA mission to use an Electric Propulsion (EP) engine as the main motor to spiral out of the Earth gravity field and reach a scientific moon orbit [1]. During September 2005 the last EP maneuvers were performed using the remaining Xenon, in order {{to compensate for the}} 3 rd body perturbations of the Sun and Earth. These operations extended the mission for an additional year. Afterwards the EP performance became unpredictable and low, so that no meaningful operation for the moon impact could be done. To move the predicted impact point on the 16 / 8 / 2006 into visibility from Earth an alternative Delta-V strategy was designed. Due to their alignment, the attitude thrusters could not be used directly to generate the Delta-V, so this strategy was based on controlled angular momentum biasing. Firing along the velocity vector around <b>apolune,</b> the remaining Hydrazine left from the attitude control budget was used, to shift the impact to the required coordinates...|$|E
