40|$|The {{present study}} {{aimed to develop}} an {{effective}} screening strategy to predict in vivo phototoxicity of multiple compounds by combined use of in vitro phototoxicity assessments and cassette dosing pharmacokinetic (PK) studies. Photochemical properties of six fluoroquinolones (FQs) were evaluated by UV spectral and reactive oxygen species (ROS) assays, and phototoxic potentials of FQs were also assessed using 3 T 3 neutral red uptake phototoxicity test (3 T 3 NRU PT) and intercalator-based photogenotoxicity (IBP) <b>assay.</b> <b>Cassette</b> dosing pharmacokinetics on FQs was conducted for calculating PK parameters and dermal distribution. All the FQs exhibited potent UV/VIS absorption and ROS generation under light exposure, suggesting potent photosensitivity of FQs. In vitro phototoxic risks of some FQs were also elucidated by 3 T 3 NRU PT and IBP assay. Decision matrix for phototoxicity prediction was built upon these in vitro data, taken together with outcomes from cassette dosing PK studies. According to the decision matrix, most FQs were deduced to be phototoxic, although gatifloxacin {{was found to be}} less phototoxic. These findings were in agreement with clinical observations. Combined use of in vitro photobiochemical and cassette dosing PK data will be useful for predicting in vivo phototoxic potentials of drug candidates with high productivity and reliability...|$|E
40|$|Surface {{contamination}} from methamphetamine in meth labs {{continues to}} be a problem. We had previously developed a lateral flow <b>assay</b> <b>cassette</b> for field detection of methamphetamine contamination that is commercially available and has been used by a number of groups to assess contamination. This cassette uses the complete disappearance of the test line as an end point for detection of 50 ng/ 100 cm 2 of methamphetamine contamination for surface sampling with cotton swabs. In the present study, we further evaluate the response of the cassettes using an electronic lateral flow reader to measure the intensities of the test and control lines. The cassettes were capable of detecting 0. 25 ng/ml for calibration solutions. For 100 cm 2 ceramic tiles that were spiked with methamphetamine and wiped with cotton-tipped wooden swabs wetted in assay/sampling buffer, 1 ng/tile was detected using the reader. Semi-quantitative results can be produced over the range 0 - 10 ng/ml for calibration solutions and 0 - 25 ng/tile for spiked tiles using either a 4 -parameter logistic fit of test line intensity versus concentration or spiked mass or the ratio of the control line to the test line intensity fit to concentration or spiked mass. Recovery from the tiles was determined to be about 30 % using the fitted curves. Comparison of the control line to the test line was also examined as a possible visual detection end point and {{it was found that the}} control line became more intense than the test line at 0. 5 to 1 ng/ml for calibration solutions or 1 to 2 ng/tile for spiked tiles. Thus the lateral flow cassettes for methamphetamine have the potential to produce more sensitive semi-quantitative results if an electronic lateral flow reader is used and can be more sensitive for detection if the comparison of the control line to the test line is used as the visual end point.

40|$|The aim of {{the work}} {{described}} in this thesis was to develop and evaluate two rapid, colloidal gold-based, immunochromatographic assays, a ‘cassette’ and ‘wick’ type, both for the qualitative detection of the glycoprotein hormone, human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) in human urine and serum. hCG is present in large quantities in the urine and serum of pregnant women and thus, provides a means for diagnosing pregnancy. A key element of this work was to develop assays, which {{would be capable of}} competing strongly in this market. The outcome of this project was a highly sensitive and specific cassette and wick hCG assay, having the capability to detect as low as 25 IU/L hCG {{on the first day of}} a missed period. These assays also had the capacity to detect levels up to 250, 000 IU/L hCG before a ‘hook’ effect was observed. This analytical range was equal to the majority of the tests already on the market. Evaluation of the two assays yielded 100 % sensitivity and specificity for the <b>cassette</b> <b>assay</b> with urine samples and 98. 5 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity for serum samples. A sensitivity of 99. 4 % (urine) and 100 % (serum) and a specificity of 100 % (urine) and 98 % (serum) were obtained for the wick assay. It should be emphasised that these assays are limited to the qualitative detection of hCG and subsequently, all positive results should be confirmed by a doctor. It is a measure of the success of the assays that predicted sales for the first six months of 2000 are estimated at -$ 60, 000 for the <b>cassette</b> <b>assay</b> and -$ 100, 000 for the wick assay...|$|R
40|$|Abstract M 13 {{filamentous}} bacteriophage {{has been}} used in displaying disease-specific antibodies, biomarkers, and pep-tides. One of the major drawbacks of using phage in diagnos-tic assays is the aspecific adsorption of proteins leading to a high background signal and decreasing sensitivity. To deal with this, we developed a genetically pure, exchangeable dual-display phage system in which biomarkers and streptavidin-binding protein (SBP) are displayed at opposite ends of the phage. This approach allows for sample purifica-tion, using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads resulting in a higher sensitivity of signal detection <b>assays.</b> Our dual-display <b>cassette</b> system approach also allows for easy exchange of both the anchor protein (SBP) and the displayed biomarker. The presented principle is applied for the detection of anti-body reactivity against UH-RA. 21 which is a good candidate biomarker for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The applicability of dual-display phage preparation using a helper plasmid system is demonstrated, and its increased sensitivity in phage ELISA assays using patient serum samples is shown...|$|R
40|$|Context: Community {{associated}} methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) {{cause serious}} skin and soft tissue infections including necrotizing fasciitis and necrotizing pneumonia. Production of Panton Valentine Leucocidine (PVL) toxin is implicated in its enhanced virulence. A variant of epidemic MRSA- 15 (EMRSA- 15) which produces PVL toxin has been isolated and characterized by {{pulsed-field gel electrophoresis}} (PFGE) method from the Indian population both in hospital and community settings. Aims: Identify the epidemiological type of MRSA colonizing the anterior nares of school children in Udupi taluk. Settings and Design: The study population included children of {{the age group of}} 5 - 16 years belonging to the Udupi taluk of Karnataka, India. A total of 1503 children were screened for MRSA colonization during July 2009 to December 2010. Materials and Methods: PVL <b>assay,</b> Staphylococcal <b>Cassette</b> Chromosome (SCC) mec typing and PFGE typing were carried out with all the MRSA isolates. Statistical Analysis Used: Frequency distribution of different variables was assessed by SPSS. Results: Among the 1. 1 % of MRSA, 58. 8 % (10 / 17) of isolates were positive for pvl and 41. 7 % (7 / 17) were identified as SCC mec type IV. PFGE patterns of all the strains were identical with Indian variant EMRSA- 15; however they were different from classical EMRSA- 15 in 3 - 4 bands. Conclusions: The Indian variant EMRSA- 15 gains much epidemiological relevance owing to the acquisition of pvl gene. In spite of low prevalence of nasal colonization of MRSA, emergence of the virulent Indian variant EMRSA- 15 in our community is a worrisome fact to be reckoned with...|$|R
40|$|Kaposi's sarcoma-associated {{herpesvirus}} (KSHV) {{is strongly}} linked to Kaposi's sarcoma, primary effusion lymphomas, and {{a subset of}} multicentric Castleman's disease. The mechanism by which this virus establishes latency and reactivation is unknown. KSHV Lyta (lytic transactivator, also named KSHV/Rta), mainly encoded by the ORF 50 gene, is a lytic switch gene for viral reactivation from latency, inasmuch as it is both essential and sufficient to drive the entire viral lytic cycle. Here we show that the Lyta promoter region was heavily methylated in latently infected cells. Treatment of primary effusion lymphoma-delivered cell lines with tetradecanoylphorbol acetate caused demethylation of the Lyta promoter and induced KSHV lytic phase in vitro. Methylation <b>cassette</b> <b>assay</b> shows demethylation of the Lyta promoter region was essential {{for the expression of}} Lyta. In vivo, biopsy samples obtained from patients with KSHV-related diseases show the most demethylation in the Lyta promoter region, whereas samples from a latently infected KSHV carrier remained in a methylated status. These results suggest a relationship among a demethylation status in the Lyta promoter, the reactivation of KSHV, and the development of KSHV-associated diseases...|$|R
40|$|Expression of hTERT is {{the major}} {{limiting}} factor for telomerase activity. We previously showed that methylation of the hTERT promoter is necessary for its transcription and that CTCF can repress hTERT transcription by binding to the first exon. In this study, we used electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to show that CTCF does not bind the methylated first exon of hTERT. Treatment of telomerase-positive cells with 5 -azadC led to a strong demethylation of hTERT 5 ′-regulatory region, reactivation of CTCF binding and downregulation of hTERT. Although complete hTERT promoter methylation was associated with full transcriptional repression, detailed mapping showed that, in telomerase-positive cells, not all the CpG sites were methylated, especially in the promoter region. Using a methylation <b>cassette</b> <b>assay,</b> selective demethylation of 110 [*]bp within the core promoter significantly increased hTERT transcriptional activity. This study underlines the dual role of DNA methylation in hTERT transcriptional regulation. In our model, hTERT methylation prevents binding of the CTCF repressor, but partial hypomethylation of the core promoter is necessary for hTERT expression...|$|R

A second evaluation was performed with 352 sera from four Latin America countries tested independently in each Country, showing a sensitivity of 100 % and specificity of 98. 6 %. A third set of tests comparing sera with plasma and eluates from filter paper as well as serum preserved in 50 % glycerol did show identical results as those obtained with serum. This rapid test (15 min) uses one device per sample, does not require refrigeration nor a laboratory structure or specialized skills to be performed, accepts different types of samples and may be stored {{for long periods of}} time for result checking and documentation. These attributes together with the high sensitivity and specificity demonstrated herein, make this test a suitable tool for field studies, small laboratories and emergencies at blood banks in the countryside of endemic areas.

40|$|Rapid {{identification}} and typing of methicillin (meticillin) -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is impor-tant {{for understanding the}} molecular epidemiology and evolution of MRSA and offers many advantages for controlling transmission in both health care and community settings. We developed a rapid molecular beacon real-time PCR (MB-PCR) <b>assay</b> for staphylococcal <b>cassette</b> chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing. The design of this system {{is based on the}} established definition of SCCmec types, namely, the combination of the mec class complex with the ccr allotype. The assay consists of two multiplex panels, the combination of which results in two targets (mec class, ccr) for each SCCmec type. MB-PCR panel I targets mecA, ccrB 2, mecI, and the mecR 1 -IS 1272 junction (mec class B); it can definitively identify SCCmec types II and IV. MB-PCR panel II detects ccrC, ccrB 1, ccrB 3, ccrB 4, and the mecR 1 -IS 431 junction (mec class C 2) and is therefore capable of identifying SCCmec types I, III, V, and VI in combination with panel I. The method can also detect the recently described novel SCCmec type VIII (ccrAB 4 with mec class A). Our assay demonstrated 100 % concordance when applied to 162 MRSA strains previously characterized by traditional SCCmec typing schemes.

40|$|Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA 1) is {{indispensable}} for viral DNA replication and episome maintenance in latency. Four promoters, Cp, Wp, Qp, and Fp, {{are known to}} drive EBNA 1 expression. Here we show that the TATA-less Qp is constitutively active {{in a variety of}} EBV-positive [EBV(+) ] tumors and cell lines, irrespective of the activities of other EBNA 1 promoters, the type of viral latency, and the cell type. The transcription of highly regulated promoters such as the EBV Cp is known to be directly regulated by CpG methylation. To characterize the role of CpG methylation in the regulation of the constitutively active Qp, we performed bisulfite genomic sequencing and functional analyses using a methylation <b>cassette</b> transcriptional reporter <b>assay.</b> Twenty consecutive CpG sites (16 proximal to the Qp initiation site and 4 upstream of the adjacent Fp initiation site) were studied by bisulfite sequencing of DNA extracted from EBV(+) tumors and cell lines. Eighteen EBV(+) tumors of lymphoid (B, T, and NK cell) or epithelial origin and five Burkitt’s lymphoma cell lines were studied. The 16 CpG sites proximal to Qp were virtually all unmethylated, but the 4 CpG sites upstream of the Fp initiation site were variably methylated. The methylation <b>cassette</b> <b>assay</b> showed that in vitro methylation of the Qp cassette (− 172 to + 32) resulted in strong repression of Qp activity in transient transfection. Thus, Qp is susceptible to repression by methylation but was found to be consistently hypomethylated and expressed in all tumors and tumor-derived cell lines studied...|$|R
40|$|The vast {{majority}} of bacteria in the environment {{have yet to be}} cultured. Consequently, a major proportion of both genetic diversity within known gene families and an unknown number of novel gene families reside in these uncultured organisms. Isolation of these genes is limited by lack of sequence information. Where such sequence data exist, PCR directed at conserved sequence motifs recovers only partial genes. Here we outline a strategy for recovering complete open reading frames from environmental DNA samples. PCR assays were designed to target the 59 -base element family of recombination sites that flank gene cassettes associated with integrons. Using such <b>assays,</b> diverse gene <b>cassettes</b> could be amplified from the {{vast majority}} of environmental DNA samples tested. These gene cassettes contained complete open reading frames, the majority of which were associated with ribosome binding sites. Novel genes with clear homologies to phosphotransferase, DNA glycosylase, methyl transferase, and thiotransferase genes were identified. However, the majority of amplified gene cassettes contained open reading frames with no identifiable homologues in databases. Accumulation analysis of the gene cassettes amplified from soil samples showed no signs of saturation, and soil samples taken at 1 -m intervals along transects demonstrated different amplification profiles. Taken together, the genetic novelty, steep accumulation curves, and spatial heterogeneity of genes recovered show that this method taps into a vast pool of unexploited genetic diversity. The success of this approach indicates that mobile gene cassettes and, by inference, integrons are widespread in natural environments and are likely to contribute significantly to bacterial diversity...|$|R
40|$|Two Epstein-Barr virus latent cycle {{promoters}} {{for nuclear}} antigen expression, Wp and Cp, are activated sequentially during virus-induced transformation of B cells to B lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) in vitro. Previously published restriction enzyme {{studies have indicated}} hypomethylation of CpG dinucleotides in the Wp and Cp regions of the viral genome in established LCLs, whereas these same regions appeared to be hypermethylated in Burkitt's lymphoma cells, where Wp and Cp are inactive. Here, using the more sensitive technique of bisulfite genomic sequencing, we reexamined the situation in established LCLs with the typical pattern of dominant Cp usage; surprisingly, this showed substantial methylation in the 400 -bp regulatory region upstream of the Wp start site. This was not an artifact of long-term in vitro passage, since, in cultures of recently infected B cells, we found progressive methylation of Wp (but not Cp) regulatory sequences occurring between 7 and 21 days postinfection, coincident with {{the period in which}} dominant nuclear antigen promoter usage switches from Wp to Cp. Furthermore, in the equivalent in vivo situation, i. e., in the circulating B cells of acute infectious mononucleosis patients undergoing primary EBV infection, we again frequently observed selective methylation of Wp but not Cp sequences. An effector role for methylation in Wp silencing was supported by methylation <b>cassette</b> <b>assays</b> of Wp reporter constructs and by bandshift assays, where the binding of two sets of transcription factors important for Wp activation in B cells, BSAP/Pax 5 and CREB/ATF proteins, was shown to be blocked by methylation of their binding sites...|$|R
40|$|PhDThe aim of {{the project}} was to {{investigate}} the mechanism by which HCV evades therapeutic IFN treatment. This involved the development of novel testing systems and their application to patient samples. Initial experiments focused on flavivirus replicons and novel observations on effects of one of these replicons (dengue virus) on interferon signalling were made. The dengue replicon system was demonstrated to inhibit IFNa signalling by reducing the expression of STAT 2, an essential component of the type I IFN signalling pathway. This phenomenom was then further examined in dengue virus infected human cells and again it was observed that the expression of STAT 2 was reduced. The mechanism of STAT 2 degradation was further explored and STAT 2 expression was found to be restored using a proteasomal inhibitor. A second flavivirus replicon system involving BVDV was also developed as a reporter system, again with novel observations. The BVDV replicon system was shown {{to be sensitive to the}} antiviral effects of I FNa and was not shown to inhibit the IFNa signalling pathway. The BVDV replicon was tested as a reporter system using a well-known viral inhibitor of I FNa. The viral inhibitor, inhibited the antiviral action of IFNa on the BVDV reporter. Having developed and validated this system, the effects of a small number of patient derived samples were assessed and it was demonstrated that NS 5 a derived from a patient who failed to respond to IFNa treatment inhibited the effects of IFNa on the BVDV reporter.

40|$|Primary {{intrinsic}} and/or acquired {{multidrug resistance}} (MDR) {{is the main}} obstacle to successful cancer treatment. Functional molecular imaging of MDR in cancer using single photon or positron emitters {{may be helpful to}} identify multidrug-resistant tumours and predict not only those patients who are resistant to treatment, with a clinically unfavourable prognosis, but also those who are susceptible to the development of drug toxicity or even certain tumours. Variations in the mdr 1 gene product may directly affect the therapeutic effectiveness, and single nucleotide polymorphisms for the mdr 1 gene may be associated with altered oral bioavailability of MDR 1 substrates, drug resistance, and a susceptibility to some human diseases. The challenge of translating the concept of MDR modulation in vivo involves a complex cellular interplay between both malignant and normal cells. Integration and correlation of functional single photon emission tomography or positron emission tomography imaging findings with mdr 1 genotype and clinical data may contribute to efficient management by selecting cancer patients with the appropriate molecular phenotype for maximal individual therapeutic benefit, {{as well as those who}} are non-responders.

The aim of present study was to evaluate the relative diagnostic performance of two urine-circulating cathodic antigen (CCA) <b>cassette</b> <b>assays,</b> one commercially available and the other in experimental production, against results obtained using the standard Kato-Katz faecal smear method (six thick smears from three consecutive days), as a ‘gold-standard’, for Schistosoma mansoni infection in different transmission settings in Uganda. Our study was conducted among 500 school children randomly selected across 5 schools within Bugiri district, adjacent to Lake Victoria in Uganda. Considering results from the 469 pupils who provided three stool samples for the six Kato-Katz smears, 293 (76 %) children had no infection, 109 (23 %) were in the light intensity category, while 42 (9 %) and 25 (5 %) were in the moderate and heavy intensity categories respectively. Following performance analysis of CCA tests in terms of sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values, overall performance of the commercially available CCA test was more informative than single Kato-Katz faecal smear microscopy, the current operational field standard for disease mapping. The current CCA assay is therefore a satisfactory method for surveillance of S. mansoni in an area where disease endemicity is declining due to control interventions. With the recent resolution on schistosomiasis elimination by the 65 th World Health Assembly, the urine POC CCA test is an attractive tool to augment and perhaps replace the Kato-Katz sampling within ongoing control programmes...|$|R

Methods: A total of 425 clinical isolates of A. baumannii were collected from 16 tertiary hospitals in 11 cities of four provinces (Fujian, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shandong) from January 2009 to June 2012. The susceptibility of A. baumannii isolates to ampicillin/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefepime, aztreonam, meropenem, amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole/trimenthoprim, minocycline and imipenem was tested, and integrons and their gene cassettes were characterized in these isolates using PCR assay. In addition, integron-positive A. baumannii isolates were genotyped using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) assay, and intI 1 gene cassette was sequenced. Results: intI 1 gene was carried in 69. 6 % of total A. baumannii isolates, while intI 2 and intI 3 genes were not detected. The prevalence of resistance to ampicillin/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefepime, aztreonam, imipenem, meropenem, amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole/trimenthoprim was significantly higher in integron-positive A. baumannii isolates than in negative isolates (all p values 0. 05). PFGE assay revealed 27 PFGE genotypes and 4 predominant genotypes, P 1, P 4, P 7 and P 19. The PFGE genotype P 1 contained 13 extensive-drug resistant and 89 non-extensive-drug resistant A. baumannii isolates, while the genotype P 4 contained 34 extensive-drug resistant and 67 non-extensive-drug resistant isolates, appearing a significant antimicrobial resistance pattern (both p values < 0. 05). Sequencing analysis revealed two gene <b>cassette</b> <b>assays</b> of aacA 4 -catB 8 -aadA 1 and dfrXII-orfF-aadA 2 in MDRAB isolates. Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrate a high prevalence of class 1 integrons in MDRAB in Eastern China, and a greater prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in intI 1 gene-positive MDRAB isolates than in negative isolates. Four predominant PFGE genotypes are identified in intI 1 gene-positive MDRAB isolates, in which P 4 is an epidemic PFGE genotype in Fujian Province, and it has a high proportion of extensive drug resistant A. baumannii. The gene cassette dfrXII-orfF-aadA 2 is reported, for the first time, in A. baumannii strains isolated from Fujian Province, Eastern China...|$|R
