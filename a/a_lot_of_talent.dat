500|$|Espinoza {{positioned}} {{the colt}} {{in third place}} early in the race as Dortmund took the lead, followed closely by Firing Line. The three remained ahead of the pack throughout the race, and broke clear of their rivals entering the straightaway with American Pharoah making a forward move on the outside. The favorite took the lead entering the final furlong and won by a length from Firing Line and Dortmund in 2:03.02, with Frosted finishing strongly in fourth. Espinoza, who won {{the race for the}} third time, said, [...] "I feel like the luckiest Mexican on earth. He has been a special horse since the first time I rode him.

At the eighth pole I just couldn't put that other horse away, but he got it done." [...] Espinoza's performance attracted some scrutiny as he appeared to have struck the winner 32 times with his whip during the race. In post-race analysis, one of the stewards at Churchill Downs said, [...] "we watched [...] many, many times prior to making it official, and that wasn't anything that got our attention." [...] Baffert said, [...] "He was hitting him on the saddle towel. He doesn't hit that hard." [...] Gary Stevens, rider of second-place Firing Line, commented that he had used his whip heavily as well, stating that the race was [...] "as tough a race as I've been in in 20 years the last eighth of a mile." [...] The Blood-Horse writer Steve Haskin, while condemning whip overuse in general, offered analysis that Espinoza [...] "did a lot of waving with the whip" [...] and may not have actually hit the horse as many times as it seemed. Reflecting on the race, Baffert said that the colt did not bring his [...] "super A-game" [...] to the Derby and that {{it was the first time}} American Pharoah had really been tested by other aggressive horses.|$|E

In mid-1968, at age fifteen, Reeve was accepted as an apprentice at the Williamstown Theatre Festival in Williamstown, Massachusetts. The other apprentices were mostly college students, but Reeve's older appearance and maturity helped him fit in with the others. In a workshop, he played a scene from A View from the Bridge that was chosen to be presented in front of an audience. After the performance, actress Olympia Dukakis said to him, [...] "I'm surprised. You've got <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>talent.</b> Don't mess it up." [...] The next summer, Reeve was hired at the Harvard Summer Repertory Theater Company in Cambridge for $44 per week. He played a Russian sailor in The Hostage and Belyayev in A Month in the Country. Famed theater critic Elliot Norton called his performance as Belyayev [...] "startlingly effective." [...] The 23-year-old lead actress in the play, a Carnegie Mellon graduate, turned out to be Reeve's first romance.

Reeve's romance with the actress fizzled a few months later when the age difference became an issue. Reeve was briefly involved with Scientology but opted out of becoming a member. He subsequently voiced criticism of the organization.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the evenings}} our camps were invaded by whole populations. Every company had its campfire, and around each fire {{something}} was doing.

Also, he pulled teeth for the whole army, and, since the extractions usually occurred at meal-time, our digestions were stimulated by variety of incident. The Dentist had no anaesthetics, but two or three of us were always on tap to volunteer to hold down the patient. In addition to the stunts of the companies and the glee club, church services were usually held, local preachers officiating, and always there was a great making of political speeches. All these things ran neck and neck; it was a full-blown Midway. <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>talent</b> can be dug out of two thousand hoboes.
