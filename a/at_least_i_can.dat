25|$|In Wilson v. Arkansas, 514 U. S. 927 (1995), a {{unanimous}} Court {{held that the}} Fourth Amendment normally requires law enforcement officers to knock and announce their presence before entering a dwelling. Today’s opinion holds that evidence seized from a home following a violation of this requirement need not be suppressed. As a result, the Court destroys the strongest legal incentive {{to comply with the}} Constitution’s knock-and-announce requirement. And the Court does so without significant support in precedent. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> find no such support in the many Fourth Amendment cases the Court has decided in the near century since it first set forth the exclusionary principle in Weeks v. United States.|$|E
500|$|Speculation {{surfaced}} that Coolio {{had actually}} given permission but later changed his mind, or that Yankovic's record label {{had lied to}} Yankovic {{in the hopes that}} the song would become popular. Yankovic later stated on VH1's Behind the Music that he had written a sincere letter of apology to Coolio which was never returned, and that Coolio never complained when he received his royalty check from proceeds of the song. A series of photos taken at the XM Satellite Radio booth at the 2006 Consumer Electronics Show, and a post on the [...] "Ask Al" [...] feature on Yankovic's website suggested that Yankovic and Coolio made amends. According to Yankovic, he was very surprised when Coolio came over to chat. He later joked on his site's Q feature that, [...] "I doubt I'll be invited to Coolio's next birthday party but <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> stop wearing that bulletproof vest to the mall." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2016, Hudson said: [...] "Meditation {{has been}} the most helpful and life-changing thing for me. You can feel the {{difference}} when you meditate on a regular basis. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can....</b> I started practicing transcendental meditation {{a year and a half}} ago so I meditate 20 minutes in the morning and I try to do another 20 minutes in the afternoon." ...|$|E

2500|$|Starting with Josiah Gilbert Holland's 1866 Life of Abraham Lincoln, {{a number}} of sources recount an anecdote about Douglas at Lincoln's first inauguration. Lincoln took the oath of office, then took off his [...] "stovepipe" [...] hat in {{preparation}} for giving his inaugural address. But he had nowhere to set down the hat. Douglas, who was on the platform, stepped forward and took the hat from Lincoln's hands. Moving back, he remarked [...] "If I can't be the President, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> hold his hat." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} the show was not {{revealed}} in the Indian media until the show officially went on air on 6 May 2012. There were also no get-togethers, parties or press conferences organized to discuss the content, {{leading up to the}} premiere of the show. However, various sources reported the show to be based on [...] "the common man" [...] rather than being fictional. Also, based on its content, it was mostly referred as a talk show discussing social issues like child labour, health problems and other issues affecting the country. Khan, who is known for keeping secrecy for his movies, was quoted saying, [...] "I don`t want to talk much about how the show will be, and about its format. I want everyone to see it directly on TV." [...] However, commenting on the theme of the show, he said, [...] "The show is about meeting the common man of India, connecting with India and its people." [...] He also added, [...] "Through this show we understand the problem of the people, we are not here to make a change. I am no one to change anything. I don`t think I am in the position to change anything else. I feel understanding a problem and feeling it or holding one's hand or hugging is also important. I may not have the solution, but <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> hear and understand." ...|$|E

5000|$|This lawyer-cum-politician is {{a cancer}} {{survivor}} {{who lost his}} voice {{for almost a year}} due to thyroid cancer which damaged a nerve on his vocal cords. He had to speak with a little boom box and a speaker for a while due to this. He has regained his voice but he says, [...] "I can't sing or shout, but <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> still <b>can</b> talk.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is because}} it is so {{precious}} that I shrink from involving you in the disaster that is hanging over me. I am a ruined, discredited man, and in a few more weeks I will be driven out of my homestead without a dollar.

6000|$|... "Mayhap, Sir. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do none {{of these}} things, and poesy wearies me to read, much more to write. But I can ask a {{question}} and take an answer." ...|$|E
