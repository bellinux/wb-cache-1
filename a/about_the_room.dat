5|$|Andriamampandry {{tried on}} several {{occasions}} to warn Andriamasinavalona {{of the danger of}} administering the kingdom in this way. In one instance, he placed a hen {{in the middle of a}} room, then set one red rooster free in each corner. The roosters attacked one another viciously, leaving the king speechless. On another day, the elder brought four eagles to the king in a basket. When the basket was opened, the eagles flew wildly <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> creating havoc. Andriamampandry warned the king that his realm would be no better off once his four sons got a taste of power. Andriamasinavalona recognized the danger but could not bear to choose which among his sons should be excluded from having a part in the decision-making responsibilities of the kingdom, so ignored the elder's advice. Finally Andriamampandry decided to give the king a very explicit warning. Andriamasinavalona had gathered his people in Andohalo to give a speech, when Andriamampandry set a bull loose into the crowd. In the panic that ensued, numerous people were gored or trampled to death, several pregnant women miscarried, and the gathering dispersed in chaos. The king demanded to know who had loosed the bull so that he may be executed, but when Andriamampandry took responsibility he warned the king that yet more blood would be spilled before the earth would be quenched. He then criticized the king for his concern over the relatively few deaths at the gathering, in light of the number of people who would die as a consequence of his division of Imerina. He further predicted that the prince at Ambohimanga would unite Imerina and lead it back to greatness. Andriamasinavalona reportedly had no response to give Andriamampandry, but instead hung his head in shame.|$|E

25|$|The curators use many {{clues to}} {{assemble}} an accurate interior. Wills and inventories of possessions of families {{of a similar}} economic level inform us about what might {{be found in a}} similar household. Period paintings help answer questions concerning the disposition of furniture <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> possible color schemes, and the sort of textiles that might have been used. Through paintings, for example, we learn that mid-Eastern carpets were too valuable to place on the floor but rather were displayed on tabletops and then in turn covered with white linen cloths during meals.|$|E
25|$|Exorcism by a Christian priest {{works in}} some tales; {{the bishop of}} Hildesheim managed to exorcise Hödekin from the castle. Even this method is not fool-proof, however; when an exorcist tried to drive away Heinzelmann, the kobold tore up the priest's holy book, strewed it <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> {{attacked}} the exorcist, and chased him away. Insulting a kobold may drive it away, but not without a curse; when someone tried to see his true form, Goldemar left the home and vowed that the house would now be as unlucky {{as it had been}} fortunate under his care. Actions a Hütchen considers insulting include giving him clothing, rushing him in his work, burning the house down, and leaving a wagon wheel in front of it.|$|E

500|$|At Hogwarts, Harry {{learns that}} Dolores Umbridge, a senior {{employee}} under the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge, {{will be the}} new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. Umbridge and Harry clash, as she, like Fudge, refuses to believe that Voldemort has returned. She punishes Harry for his rebellious outbursts by having him write [...] "I must not tell lies" [...] with a cursed quill that carves the phrase into his skin. She also refuses to teach her students how to perform defensive spells, prompting Harry, Ron and Hermione to form their own Defence Against the Dark Arts group (with students from Gryffindor, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff), which they call Dumbledore's Army. Many students sign up, including Neville Longbottom, Fred and George Weasley, Ginny Weasley and Luna Lovegood. Struggling {{to find a place to}} practise, Dobby the house elf tells him <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Room</b> of Requirement and its uses. The club meet there to learn and practise defensive spells under Harry's instruction.|$|E
500|$|Production of Thief II {{commenced}} in February. Looking Glass {{chose to}} compose the game's team of [...] "half the original designers and half new blood", according to executive producer James Poole. The company tried to select people who meshed well both personally and creatively, {{in an attempt}} to guarantee a smooth development cycle. Adrenaline Vault editor-in-chief Emil Pagliarulo was hired as a junior designer, in part because of his positive review of Thief. Rich [...] "zdim" [...] Carlson and Iikka Keränen joined from Ion Storm's Daikatana team, and Looking Glass contractor Terri Brosius was hired as a full-time designer. One-third of the team was female, which Pearsall believed contributed to a strong group dynamic. As was typical at Looking Glass, the Thief II team worked in a wall-less space called a [...] "pit", which allowed them to converse easily. Describing the work environment at the time, writer Laura Baldwin noted that [...] "conversations dash madly <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> [...] when someone is demonstrating something interesting everyone gravitates over to look." ...|$|E
500|$|Olga was disdainful of {{her cousin}} Princess Irina of Russia's husband Felix Yussupov, {{the man who}} {{eventually}} murdered Rasputin in December 1916. Yussupov had taken advantage of a law permitting men who were only sons to avoid military service. He was in civilian dress {{at a time when}} many of the Romanov men and the wounded soldiers Olga cared for were fighting. [...] "Felix is a 'downright civilian', dressed all in brown, walked to and fro <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> searching in some bookcases with magazines and virtually doing nothing; an utterly unpleasant impression he makes — a man idling in such times", Olga wrote to her father, Tsar Nicholas, on March 5, 1915 after paying a visit to the Yussupovs. She was also strongly patriotic. In July 1915, while discussing the wedding of an acquaintance with fellow nurses, Olga said she understood why the ancestry of the groom's German grandmother was being kept hidden. [...] "Of course he has to conceal it", she burst out. [...] "I quite understand him, she may perhaps be a real bloodthirsty German." [...] Olga's unthinking comments hurt her mother, who had been born in Germany, reported fellow nurse Valentina Ivanovna Chebotareva.|$|E
50|$|There {{were many}} {{documented}} problems from users <b>about</b> <b>the</b> MSN chat function.

50|$|When {{designating}} {{an ancient}} room as a kiva, archaeologists make assumptions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>room's</b> original functions {{and how those}} functions may be similar to or differ from kivas used in modern practice. The kachina belief system appears to have emerged in the Southwest around AD 1250, while kiva-like structures occurred much earlier. This suggests that <b>the</b> <b>room's</b> older functions may have been changed or adapted to suit the new religious practice.|$|R

500|$|Wykes {{believes}} that, of the novel's three central characters, only Tony {{is representative}} of his real-life equivalent—Waugh in his pre-Catholic irreligious state. Brenda is portrayed in the novel as typical {{of many of the}} women in Waugh's early stories—well-bred, trivial and faithless—but Wykes argues that she is not a representation of Evelyn Gardner, [...] "neither in inward nor outward qualities". Nor, he asserts, is Beaver intended as an accurate portrayal of [...] Evelyn Gardner's lover, the [...] "dreadful nullity" [...] of Beaver being a form of literary revenge on the erudite Heygate. There is general agreement among commentators that other characters are drawn from life: Mr Todd is clearly based on the eccentric but rather less sinister Mr Christie; Dr Messinger, the incompetent explorer, reflects W. E. Roth, the curator of the Georgetown museum whom Waugh considered accompanying into the jungle, only to be dissuaded by reports of Roth's irresponsibility and disregard of danger. Thérèse de Vitré, the object of Tony's forlorn attempt at a shipboard romance, was named [...] "Bernadette" [...] in the original manuscript; the change was made as a reference to Waugh's platonic friend Teresa Jungman. Thérèse announces her destiny to marry a rich Catholic, and, in an echo of Jungman, recoils from Tony when she discovers that he still has a wife. The culmination of Tony's misfortunes, his enslavement to Mr Todd and Dickens, is foreshadowed in Waugh's life by his father's habit of reading his favourite literature aloud to his family, three or four evenings a week: [...] "...most of Shakespeare, most of Dickens, most of Tennyson... stepping <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and portraying the characters... he held us enthralled".|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from July 16, 1910. It states: [...] "A shot that found a fortune! Jack Hunt, {{the son of a}} wealthy woman, falls in love with Nell Horsley, who is in the chorus of a musical comedy. They are married, but when Jack's mother is informed she declares she'll {{have nothing to do with}} Nell, although she is willing to forgive her son. But Jack sticks to his wife, and for a time they are very happy. Then Jack, who is in the militia, is called out on strike duty, and meets his death during a fight with strikers. The widow takes the news to her mother-in-law, who nevertheless retains her hatred for Nell, despite the tragedy. As time passes, Mrs. Hunt becomes a miser. She disposes of all of her property, receiving in exchange money and jewels which she hides in a secret place in her room. In the meantime Nell has a hard time to get along and keep a roof over her head and that of her little boy. So desperate are her circumstances that she finally sinks her pride and appeals to her mother-in-law. The old woman repulses her again; her fit of rage brings on a stroke of apoplexy and she drops dead after Nell leaves. All her property goes to little George, as the woman left no will, but search fails to locate anything except the family homestead. Nell is about to sell that, when she makes a discovery. Playing 'Indian' with her boy, she shoots arrows aimlessly <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> One of them hits the secret spring of the treasure vault, and the accident puts the boy and his mother beyond want for the rest of their lives." ...|$|E

But to whatever position she moved a hand or arm, it could not be hindered nor controlled by even the strongest person.

60|$|Never {{was there}} a more {{brilliant}} assembly than that at the palace, the evening before the troops marched.

2500|$|Entering {{through the}} hotel's front doors, guests {{encounter}} an interior {{designed to give}} the impression that the Hollywood Tower Hotel has been left untouched since the night of its closure. The lobby is covered in dust and draped with cobwebs, and throughout there are other signs of the hotel's abrupt closure. Past the front desk, the main elevators are in a dilapidated state, and a sign reads [...] "Out of Order". Guests are informed by bellhops that their rooms are not ready yet, and they are then ushered into the hotel library, which houses the hotel's collection of books, antiques, an old television set, and various pieces of Twilight Zone memorabilia scattered <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Through the library window, guests can observe a severe thunderstorm raging outside.|$|E

He entered the Cadet Corps and took an officer's training course but had no intention of joining a regiment. Irina's first cousin, Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna, to whom she had been close when they were girls, was disdainful of Felix: [...] "Felix is a 'downright civilian,' dressed all in brown, walked to and fro <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> searching in some bookcases with magazines and virtually doing nothing; an utterly unpleasant impression he makes—a man idling in such times," [...] Olga wrote to her father, Tsar Nicholas II, on 5 March 1915 after paying a visit to the Yusupovs. Felix and Irina's only daughter, Princess Irina Felixovna Yusupova, nicknamed [...] "Bebé", was born on 21 March 1915. [...] "I shall never forget my happiness when I heard the child's first cry," [...] her father wrote. Irina liked her name and wanted to pass it on to her first child. Her mother Xenia was so worried over the delivery that Tsarina Alexandra Feodorovna said it was almost like Xenia was giving birth instead of Irina.|$|E
2500|$|Captain DeWitt C. Poole at the Whetstone Indian Agency {{reported}} Blue Horse’s {{shock and}} anger to Big Mouth’s murder. “Blue Horse started a violent harangue in the Sioux language. He had a rifle {{in one hand}} and a strung bow and a bunch of arrows in the other, and when he dropped his blanket, two navy Colts and a big scalping knife could be seen in their sheaths at his belt. He was in a raving fury, leaping and bounding <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> as he hurled accusations and threats at [...] Spotted Tail. [...] Big Mouth died toward dawn. Some hours later, Blue Horse came to agent Poole’s office and told he that he felt so sad over the death of his great and good brother that he would have to wash off the paint he had put on his face for the feast the day before and begin mourning. The interpreter warned Poole that if this Indian washed his face and started mourning, it would mean the reopening of the feud and more shootings. The agent would give Blue Horse two blankets, that would comfort him, and he would refrain from washing his face and going gunning for Spotted Tail. The blankets were handed over, and the grieving brother went quietly away.” Poole later reported that Spotted Tail made a prompt payment of a stipulated number of ponies to Blue Horse and that aboriginal law had been vindicated.|$|E
