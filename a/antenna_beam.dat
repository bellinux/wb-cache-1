40|$|The {{motivation}} {{of the present}} study is to investigate the possibility of using two independently directed <b>antenna</b> <b>beams</b> in a mobile base station to provide diversity gain and reduce fading problems in a microcellular environment. In this paper, the signal correlation of the individual <b>antenna</b> <b>beams</b> is studied, and it is shown that correlation depends on beamwidth, separation angle of the <b>antenna</b> <b>beams,</b> and the location of the base-station antenna array. Signal correlations have been computed using narrow- and wide-beam antennas in two separate base-station antenna locations. Diversity gains of both antenna types have been optimized by selecting the beam orientations which minimize the signal correlation. The numerical simulations show that a considerable diversity gain can be obtained using this approach. Index Terms [...] -Diversity, fading, propagation...|$|R
40|$|Vertical {{velocities}} {{are assumed}} to be measurable with vertically pointing <b>antenna</b> <b>beams.</b> An exact horizontal levelling and good phase calibration of the radar antenna system can yield real main-beam directions which do not significantly differ from calculated patterns. It is, thus, anticipated that <b>antenna</b> <b>beams</b> can be pointed exactly vertically. Because of area size and near-field limitations, VHF radar <b>antennas</b> have typically <b>beam</b> widths of more than several degrees. It is known that most of the reflectivity structures detected by vertically beaming VHF radars in the troposphere, stratosphere and lower mesosphere are aspect-sensitive. It cannot a priori be assumed that these structures are exactly horizontal. A few examples are investigated to support this statement...|$|R

50|$|For a {{mechanically}} steered antenna, {{the horizontal}} signal and vertical signal {{are used to}} create a drive signal that creates torque for two antenna positioning motors. One motor moves the antenna left/right. The other motor drives the antenna up/down.

In what follows, we assume a static scenario where the discovery phase has been successfully completed and all the readers have their <b>antenna</b> <b>beams</b> pointed toward the correct direction.

50|$|With {{the advent}} of digital techniques, Pulse-Doppler radars (PD) became light enough for {{aircraft}} use, and Doppler processors for coherent pulse radars became more common. That provides Look-down/shoot-down capability. The advantage of combining Doppler processing with pulse radars is to provide accurate velocity information. This velocity is called range-rate. It describes the rate that a target moves toward or away from the radar. A target with no range-rate reflects a frequency near the transmitter frequency and cannot be detected. The classic zero doppler target is one which is on a heading that is tangential to the radar <b>antenna</b> <b>beam.</b> Basically, any target that is heading 90 degrees {{in relation to the}} <b>antenna</b> <b>beam</b> cannot be detected by its velocity (only by its conventional reflectivity).|$|E

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 13 - 15, 1981 / Bahia Hotel, San Diego, CaliforniaSatellite {{communications}} in the allocated EHF bands, (i. e., several frequency segments from 20 GHz to 50 GHz) {{has the potential}} for providing interference resistant communications to users employing small, mobile terminals. To realize this potential, advanced spacecraft technologies are required, such as uplink coverage through high gain directive beams, onboard signal processing, and downlink beam hopping. Simultaneous worldwide uplink coverage could be obtained via many narrow uplink <b>antenna</b> <b>beams</b> which collectively cover the earth field-of-view. When worldwide communications traffic is low volume, a reduction in space segment impact can be achieved by using a few narrow uplink <b>antenna</b> <b>beams</b> to provide the required service. To minimize delays, these beams must be able to rapidly point anywhere within the field-ofview to cover individual users who require a channel for brief communications. The agile <b>antenna</b> <b>beams</b> can be shared through demand assignment techniques. A multimode common transmission format can provide both data and control channels. The data channels are available at several rates to allow either full duty cycle data transmission or burst data transmission. With burst transmissions, a single beam can support multiple calls in a time division multiplexed fashion. The control channels are utilized in coordinating the use of satellite resources to efficiently meet the communications needs of the users. This paper discusses the use of EHF satellite communicatons to provide service to widely scattered users. The use of control channels to request and coordinate service is described. Example control protocols are presented, and system performance is indicated...|$|R
50|$|In most implementations, two {{signals are}} formed, one being {{the sum of}} the two beams, and the other being the {{difference}} of the two beams.
