25|$|By 1988, his drivers' caricatures {{had evolved}} from <b>a</b> <b>lanky</b> goggle-eyed {{character}} to a dumpier version. Bamber used this {{design for the}} rest of his career.|$|E
25|$|Cleveland added {{several more}} players to its roster in the 1950 NFL Draft, {{selecting}} halfback Ken Carpenter {{in the first}} round and tackle John Sandusky and guard Jim Martin in the second. Later selections included fullback Emerson Cole, halfback Don Phelps and defensive back Dom Moselle. Those additions aimed to replenish a backfield depleted by the departure of Edgar Jones, Bill Boedeker, Les Horvath and Ara Parseghian. Ken Gorgal, <b>a</b> <b>lanky</b> safety from Purdue, was another draft pick who earned a starting role in his rookie year, supplanting long-time starter Cliff Lewis.|$|E
60|$|Then, {{raising his}} head, he {{attacked}} grumpily the steward, <b>a</b> <b>lanky,</b> anxious youth with a long, pale face and two big front teeth.|$|E
5000|$|Michel Fortin as L'escogriffe (the [...] "beanpole", <b>a</b> tall <b>lanky</b> person) ...|$|R
5000|$|Tall John Harrington - <b>a</b> tall, <b>lanky</b> cowboy with <b>a</b> slow wit and {{a penchant}} for {{flatulence}} humor.|$|R
60|$|<b>A</b> long <b>lanky</b> red-faced rider {{detached}} {{himself from}} the others, and strode with jingling spurs over to look at Pan's horse.|$|R
60|$|From the pitcher's box <b>a</b> <b>lanky</b> {{individual}} {{was trying to}} locate the plate. Ken did not need a second glance {{to see that this}} fellow was no pitcher.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's Wayne's dub team," [...] replied another. They ran {{upon the}} field as if {{the result of the}} game was a foregone conclusion. Their pitcher, <b>a</b> <b>lanky</b> individual, handled the ball with assurance.|$|E
60|$|Niven, {{for that}} was his name, did not appear greatly disconcerted, or was able to face his loss with enviable tranquillity. He was <b>a</b> <b>lanky,</b> thin-faced man, with cunning eyes, and I {{did not like the}} way he looked at me.|$|E
60|$|The young pugilist, who had <b>a</b> curious, <b>lanky</b> figure, and <b>a</b> craggy, bony face, {{passed his}} fingers through his {{close-cropped}} hair.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why shrink, my honey-bird? Why so afeard, {{my sweet}} cinnamon?" [...] exclaimed the other, <b>a</b> loose-jointed <b>lanky</b> youth with <b>a</b> dancing, roguish eye.|$|R
60|$|The next player up was <b>a</b> tall, <b>lanky</b> chap named Wilks. He swung savagely at {{the sphere}} as if {{intending}} to knock {{it over the}} back fence.|$|R
60|$|Stillwell {{took one}} mighty stride off the porch. His last words had been cold. His rage {{appeared}} to have been transferred to Hawe. The sheriff had begun to stutter and shake <b>a</b> <b>lanky</b> red hand at the cattleman when Stewart stepped out.|$|E
60|$|The Texan paced {{to and fro}} {{beside the}} camp-fire with bent head, and hands locked behind him. But for the {{swinging}} gun he would have resembled <b>a</b> <b>lanky</b> farmer, coatless and hatless, with his brown vest open, his trousers stuck {{in the top of}} the high boots.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Sherlock Holmes--" [...] I began, but {{the words}} had a most magical effect, for the window {{instantly}} slammed down, and within a minute the door was unbarred and open. Mr. Sherman was <b>a</b> <b>lanky,</b> lean old man, with stooping shoulders, a stringy neck, and blue-tinted glasses.|$|E
60|$|At {{that moment}} the figure of <b>a</b> tall, <b>lanky</b> colored man came down a side street. The man entered the widow's cottage and {{received}} a warm welcome.|$|R
50|$|Milligan visualised Eccles as <b>a</b> tall, <b>lanky,</b> amiable, well-meaning, but {{incredibly}} stupid {{teenager who}} often found himself involved - usually alongside Bluebottle - {{in one of}} the nefarious schemes created by arch-villain Hercules Grytpype-Thynne.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> tall, <b>lanky</b> centre {{forward with}} skills, Salinas is best remembered for his spell at Barcelona - having {{started his career}} with Athletic Bilbao - while {{he was also a}} {{prolific}} goalscorer for club and country.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{called himself}} Nicholson, when we last met; but like enough {{that is not}} his real name, and if it is, he may be known by another here. He is <b>a</b> <b>lanky</b> knave, of middle height; but more than that, except {{that he has a}} shifty look about his eyes, I cannot tell you." ...|$|E
60|$|At this summons, <b>a</b> <b>lanky,</b> big-boned hobbledehoy, in sea boots, {{pushed the}} stools up towards the fire, {{on which a}} log of wood was blazing cheerily. The two Girdlestones sat warming themselves, while the {{fisherman}} and his son surveyed them silently with open eyes and mouth, {{as though they were}} a pair of strange zoological curiosities cast up by the gale.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Longworth {{smiled to}} him. They had been great friends all summer. He was <b>a</b> <b>lanky,</b> {{overgrown}} lad of fifteen or sixteen, odd and shy and dreamy, scarcely possessing a speaking acquaintance with {{others at the}} hotel. But he and Mrs. Longworth had been congenial from their first meeting. In many ways, he was far older than his years, {{but there was a}} certain inerradicable boyishness about him to which her heart warmed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ho! They've got it," [...] she snorted. [...] "Let me out!" [...] and she galloped like a rifle-bullet {{just behind}} <b>a</b> tall <b>lanky</b> pony of the Archangels, whose rider was {{swinging}} up his stick for a stroke.|$|R
6000|$|... "If I win the prize, what is it?" [...] {{questioned}} Lewis Barrow, <b>a</b> tall, <b>lanky</b> {{youth with}} <b>a</b> rather leathery face. He {{came from the}} far West, and knew much more about firearms than did the Rovers.|$|R
60|$|The {{driver of}} this one was <b>a</b> tall, <b>lanky,</b> tow-headed youth, growing like a Texas weed. We had not any too much room in the buckboard, but that fact {{was not going to}} spoil the ride for me.|$|R
60|$|By the way, she {{wondered}} what he did look like now. She had an old faded photograph of him as <b>a</b> <b>lanky</b> youth, but {{after all this time}} he could not in the least resemble that. Well, probably he had grown as plain and uninteresting--as she was herself. It was wonderful that the American young man could have seen anything in her, but then, no doubt he went on {{in the same kind of}} way with half the girls he met.|$|E
6000|$|... 19. I perceive, farther, {{that this}} disorderly flower is lifted on <b>a</b> <b>lanky,</b> awkward, springless, and yet stiff flower-stalk; {{which is not}} round, as a flower-stalk ought to be, (vol. i., p. 155,) but obstinately square, and fluted, with {{projecting}} edges, like a pillar run thin out of an iron-foundry for a cheap railway station. I perceive also that it has set on it, just before turning down to carry the flower, two little jaggy and indefinable leaves,--their colour a little more violet than the blossom.|$|E
6000|$|Stolen {{hours he}} gave to the {{building}} of box-kites with cambered wings, after rapturously learning, {{in the autumn of}} 1908, that in August <b>a</b> <b>lanky</b> American mechanic named Wilbur Wright had startled the world by flying an aeroplane many miles publicly in France; that before this, on July 4, 1908, another Yankee mechanic, Glenn Curtiss, had covered nearly a mile, for the Scientific American trophy, after a series of trials made in company with Alexander Graham Bell, J. A. D. McCurdy, [...] "Casey" [...] Baldwin, and Augustus Post.|$|E
5000|$|The series' cast {{is led by}} Old Master Q, <b>an</b> elderly, <b>lanky</b> {{man dressed}} in a {{distinctive}} traditional Chinese attire. Supporting characters include Big Potato (Old Master Q's identically-dressed contemporary with a stumpy, big-headed build) as well as Mr. Chin, ...|$|R
60|$|They {{managed to}} get seats almost {{in the center of}} the hall, which was long and narrow, just the shape for such an exhibition. They noticed that <b>a</b> tall, <b>lanky</b> town boy was usher, and Tom nudged Sam in the ribs.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> big, <b>lanky</b> defender, Santamaría {{started his}} career at Marathón and also played for other Honduran giants Real España and Motagua. In 2007, he signed a {{contract}} with Chinese club Beijing Guoan. He also had a spell with Qingdao Zhongneng in 2008.|$|R
60|$|The {{room was}} full when Arthur Burdon entered, but Margaret {{had kept him}} an empty seat between herself and Miss Boyd. Everyone was {{speaking}} at once, in French, {{at the top of}} his voice, and a furious argument was proceeding on the merit of the later Impressionists. Arthur sat down, and was hurriedly introduced to <b>a</b> <b>lanky</b> youth, who sat on the other side of Margaret. He was very tall, very thin, very fair. He wore a very high collar and very long hair, and held himself like an exhausted lily.|$|E
6000|$|There was a peach orchard planted round Maraisfontein, {{which just}} then was {{a mass of}} lovely pink blossom, and as I rode through it slowly, not being sure {{of my way to}} the house, <b>a</b> <b>lanky</b> child {{appeared}} in front of me, clad in a frock which exactly matched the colour of the peach bloom. I can see her now, her dark hair hanging down her back, and her big, shy eyes staring at me from the shadow of the Dutch [...] "kappie" [...] which she wore. Indeed, she seemed to be all eyes, like a [...] "dikkop" [...] or thick-headed plover; at any rate, I noted little else about her.|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't suppose," [...] Mr. Tufton said sternly, [...] "that I'm {{going to}} have my nephew go out to India with the outfit of a cabin boy. I ordered that you were to have the proper outfit of a gentleman, and I {{requested}} my clerk to order a considerable portion of the things to be made of a size which will allow for your growing, for you look to me as if you were likely enough to run up into <b>a</b> <b>lanky</b> giant, of six feet high. I suppose he has done as I ordered him. Don't let me hear another word on the subject." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> tall, <b>lanky</b> striker, Welcome {{was part}} of the Honduran U-23 team that {{qualified}} for the 2008 Olympic Games. Because of his goal in the 108th minute of the match, Honduras became CONCACAF Pre-Olympic champions after beating the host country, the United States, 1-0.|$|R
60|$|Gray, {{the leader}} of the Pornell contingent, was <b>a</b> tall, <b>lanky,</b> and {{powerful}} fellow, and every stroke he took told well in his favor. The turning point was hardly rounded when he began to crawl up to Fred, and then he gradually passed him.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> redheaded <b>lanky</b> ruckman, O'Dwyer won the 1988 Keith 'Bluey' Truscott Medal for Melbourne's {{best and}} fairest player, helping the club reach their first Grand Final since 1964. However, {{he missed the}} decider after being {{suspended}} for striking Carlton's Steven Da Rui in the Preliminary Final.|$|R
