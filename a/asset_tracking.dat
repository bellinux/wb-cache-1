25|$|The Intelligence to Prevent Terrorism Act was {{introduced}} to the Senate on September 28 by Senators Bob Graham (D-FL) and Jay Rockefeller (D-WV). The bill proposed a number of changes relating to the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI). The most significant change proposed was to require the Attorney General or head of any other Federal department or agency to disclose to the DCI any foreign intelligence acquired {{in the course of a}} criminal investigation. However, it would also have required that the DCI and Secretary of the Treasury jointly report to Congress as to whether it would be a good idea to reconfigure the Office of Foreign Assets Control and its Foreign Terrorist <b>Asset</b> <b>Tracking</b> Center to provide for the analysis and dissemination of foreign intelligence relating to the financial capabilities and resources of international terrorist organizations. It would also have required the DCI to establish and maintain a National Virtual Translation Center for timely and accurate translations of foreign intelligence for elements of the intelligence community. Another area it covered was a proposal to make the Attorney General provide a program of training to Government officials regarding the identification and use of foreign intelligence.|$|E

This service is often used for <b>asset</b> <b>tracking</b> and remote monitoring. Messages are converted to be delivered in email format or over HTTP to a preconfigured address; the mobile unit does not include a destination address when sending a SBD message. A crude positioning report is also included in each message sent. SBD messages take from 6 to 22 seconds to send or receive. [...] The latest generation of SBD transceiver, the Iridium 9602, can receive up to 270 bytes per SBD data message (defined by Iridium as [...] "mobile terminated SBD") and can transmit a maximum of 340 bytes per SBD message (defined by Iridium as [...] "mobile originated SBD"). A real-world example of the 9602 chipset in use are the YB Tracker or the owa3x embedded Linux computer.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} reports were {{commissioned}} relating to various intelligence-related government centers.

[...] The USA PATRIOT Act required this to be provided on February 1, 2002, however the report, entitled [...] "Director of Central Intelligence Report on the National Virtual Translation Center: A Concept Plan to Enhance the Intelligence Community's Foreign Language Capabilities, April 29, 2002" [...] was received more than two months late, which the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence reported was [...] "a delay which, in addition to contravening the explicit words of the statute, deprived the Committee of timely and valuable input into its efforts to craft this legislation." [...] Another report was commissioned on the feasibility and desirability of reconfiguring the Foreign Terrorist <b>Asset</b> <b>Tracking</b> Center and the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Department of the Treasury. It was due by February 1, 2002 however, it was never written. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence later complained that [...] "he Director of Central Intelligence and the Secretary of the Treasury failed to provide a report, this time in direct contravention of a section of the USA PATRIOT Act" [...] and they further directed [...] "that the statutorily-directed report be completed immediately, and that it should include a section describing the circumstances which led to the Director's failure to comply with lawful reporting requirements." ...|$|E
