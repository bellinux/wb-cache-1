5|$|As {{described}} in attachment theory, infants {{need to develop}} a relationship with a primary caregiver to achieve normal social <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> development. A key part of the ability to develop this relationship may be joint attention. In addition to language development, joint attention serves the function of preparing infants for more complex social structures involved in adult conversation. Children's skills in initiating and responding to joint attention predict their social competence at 30 months of age. Anticipatory smiling (a low level form of joint attention involving smiling at an object then turning the smile to one's communicative partner) at 9 months positively predicts parent-rated social competence scores at 30 months in infants. Early joint attention abilities account for differences in social <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> abilities in later life.|$|E

5|$|Cited as an {{influential}} {{title in the}} video game industry {{and one of the}} best games of all time, Shadow of the Colossus is often regarded as an important example of video game as art due to its minimalist landscape designs, immersive gameplay <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> journey. It received wide critical acclaim by the media and was met with strong sales compared to Ico, due in part to a larger marketing campaign. The soundtrack was also widely praised. The game won several awards for its audio, design, and overall quality. Shadow of the Colossus is also referenced numerous times in debates regarding the art quality <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> perspectives of video games. A remake of the game with ultra-high definition art assets is currently in development and scheduled for release on the PlayStation 4 in 2018.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to model the {{functional}} form {{of the effect of}} contextual risk (number of adverse life events) on <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behavioural problems in early adolescence, and to test how intelligence and academic achievement compare as moderators of this effect. The effect of number of adverse life events on <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behavioural problems was non-quadratic. Intelligence rather than academic achievement moderated the association between contextual risk <b>and</b> children's <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behavioural problems. However, the interaction effect was significant only on peer problems. These findings suggest that both moderator and outcome specificity should be considered when evaluating the role of intellectual competence in the association between contextual risk <b>and</b> children's <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behavioural problems. <br/...|$|R

5|$|Concussion, {{also known}} as minor head trauma or mild {{traumatic}} brain injury (mTBI) {{is the most common}} type of traumatic brain injury. It is typically defined as a head injury with a temporary loss of brain function. Symptoms include a variety of physical, cognitive, <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> symptoms, which may not be recognized if subtle. A variety of signs accompany concussion including headache, feeling in a fog, <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> changeability. In general, the signs can be categorized into physical signs (such as loss of consciousness or amnesia), behavioral changes (such as irritability), cognitive impairment (such as slowed reaction times), and sleep disturbances. Fewer than 10% of sports-related concussions among children are associated with loss of consciousness.|$|E

Academic attainment was assessed in reception and Year 2 (ages 6 – 7). Relative to monolingual peers with comparable English language proficiency, children with EAL displayed fewer social, <b>emotional,</b> <b>and</b> behavioral difficulties in reception, were equally likely to meet curriculum targets in reception, {{and were more likely}} to meet targets in Year 2.

40|$|Background: Childhood <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> {{behaviour}} {{problems are}} antecedents for later psychopathology. This study investigated genetic and environmental influences shaping the longitudinal association between childhood <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behaviour problems and specific PEs. Method: In a community-based twin sample, parents reported on <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behaviour problems when twins were ages 7 and 12 years. At age 16 years, specific PEs were measured using self-reports and parent reports. Structural equation model-fitting was conducted. Results: Childhood <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behaviour problems were {{significantly associated with}} paranoia, cognitive disorganisation and parent-rated negative symptoms in adolescence (mean r =. 15 –. 38), {{and to a lesser extent}} with hallucinations, grandiosity and anhedonia (mean r =. 04 -. 12). Genetic influences on childhood <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behaviour problems explained significant proportions of variance in adolescent paranoia (4 %), cognitive disorganisation (8 %) and parent-rated negative symptoms (3 %). Unique environmental influences on childhood <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behaviour problems explained ≤ 1 % of variance in PEs. Common environmental influences were only relevant for the relationship between childhood <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behaviour problems and parent-rated negative symptoms (explaining 28 % of variance) and are partly due to correlated rater effects. Conclusions: Childhood <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behaviour problems are significantly, if weakly, associated with adolescent PEs. These associations are driven in part by common genetic influences underlying both <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behaviour problems and PEs. However, psychotic experiences in adolescence are largely influenced by genetic and environmental factors that are independent of general childhood <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behaviour problems, suggesting they are not merely an extension of childhood <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behaviour problems...|$|R
5|$|Aesthetics as {{a factor}} of well-being. From the early austere {{principle}} that form should strictly follow function, {{there is a growing}} sensibility that aesthetics affect the physical <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> health of those who use a building or structure.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to examine the <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> personality-related career {{decision-making}} difficulties of high school students in Turkish culture, using the model proposed by Saka and Gati. A sample of 523 high school students filled out the Turkish version of the <b>Emotional</b> <b>and</b> Personality-Related Aspects of Career Decision-Making Difficulties (EPCD) questionnaire. Cluster and confirmatory factor analyses supported the ternary classification system of the <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> personality-related career decision-making difficul-ties model and questionnaire, thus providing evidence for the cross-cultural validity of the proposed model. Furthermore, the results demonstrated signifi-cant associations between making a decision <b>and</b> the <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> personality career difficulties: students who were decided reported lower <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> personality-related career difficulties than did undecided students. Generally, there were no differences in EPCD scores between boys and girls, and no effect of type of school and grade was observed...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} looks at {{preferential}} processing of photographic <b>emotional</b> expression stimuli <b>and</b> sex of poser via detection and identification tasks. A series of computer-based visual tasks were under taken to look further into current literature patterns of results {{and compare the}} differences of closed-mouth and open-mouth stimuli. Experiment 1 examined detection and identification of closed-mouth stimuli for happy, sad, angry <b>and</b> disgust <b>emotional</b> face expressions. Results indicated happy emotional expressions were preferentially detected compared to sad, angry <b>and</b> disgust <b>emotional</b> expressions. For the identification task happy {{and to a lesser}} extent sad emotional expressions were preferentially identified compared to sad, angry <b>and</b> disgust <b>emotional</b> expressions. Happy <b>and</b> sad <b>emotional</b> expressions were preferentially identified in the female poser condition compared the male poser condition. Experiment 2 repeated experiment 1 utilizing open-mouth stimuli. No significant differences resulted for the detection task. For the identification task happy emotional expressions were preferentially processed compared with sad, angry <b>and</b> disgust <b>emotional</b> expressions with disgust resulting in slower reaction times than angry <b>emotional</b> expressions <b>and</b> more errors than sad <b>and</b> angry <b>emotional</b> expressions. Preferential identification of sad emotional expressions were observed for the female poser condition and angry for the male poser condition. A follow-up task comparing the results of experiment 1 and 2 revealed no differences in between experiments for the detection task. The follow-up for the identification task comparison revealed faster identification of open-mouth stimuli for happy <b>and</b> angry <b>emotional</b> expressions compared to closed-mouth stimuli with fewer errors for angry <b>and</b> sad <b>emotional</b> expressions. The current thesis results suggest partial support for preferential processing differences between the emotional expressions due to closed-mouth and open-mouth regions of the face. Limitations of the current study and future directions are discussed...|$|R
