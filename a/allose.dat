Elaboration of this disaccharide to the protected tetrasaccharide was hindered by an unfavorable rearrangement during the tetrasaccharide coupling, so a second core disaccharide was synthesized.

NMR analysis indicated that 1 -deoxy- 1 -morpholinopsicose (DMP, a substrate for FN 3 K and FN 3 K-RP), like 1 -deoxy- 1 -morpholinofructose (DMF, a substrate of FN 3 K), penetrated erythrocytes and was converted into the corresponding 3 -phospho-derivative.

40|$|The LUMO-lowering {{activation}} of a,b-unsaturated ketones {{has been accomplished}} {{through the development of}} a new imidazolidinone organocatalyst. That new imidazolidinone catalyst provided the first enantioselective catalytic Diels-Alder reaction with simple ketone dienophiles. Significantly, that catalyst is able to activate both cyclic and acyclic a, b-unsaturated ketones in this cycloaddition process. A new strategy for the synthesis of two privileged structural motifs, the polyketide and polyglycolate architectures, has been developed based on the direct aldehyde aldol reaction. Two different catalysts are presented that are capable of performing the enantioselective direct aldol cross coupling of two distinct aldehyde components. Imidazolidinones have been shown for the first time to initiate the HOMO-raising {{activation of}} both saturated and a, b-unsaturated aldehyde substrates. Using an imidazolidinone catalyst, the first direct enantioselective catalytic aldol coupling of two aldehydes is described and provides synthetically valuable b-hydroxy dimethylacetals. Later, proline was found to be an exceptionally effective catalyst for the direct aldehyde aldol reaction. In contrast to imidazolidinone catalysts, proline affords b-hydroxyaldehyde products that are primed for use directly in subsequent aldol reactions. Utilizing those direct aldehyde aldol methodologies, a two-step synthesis of 2, 4, 6 -O-protected carbohydrates has been developed. Importantly, this modular strategy is capable of producing highly enantioenriched differentially protected forms of glucose, mannose, <b>allose,</b> mannosamine, as well as unnatural hexose derivatives.

Using the non-metabolizable analogue 2 -deoxyglucose, two uptake systems were detected with Q 10 values of 2. 12 and 2. 09, respectively. One had a high affinity (Km= 67. 5 μM) {{and the other a}} low affinity (Km= 5. 99 mM) for 2 -deoxyglucose uptake. Glucose or deoxyglucose phosphate products from transported radiolabeled substrates were not detected during the incubation times used in this study. Both systems were inhibited by mannose, galactose, fructose, galactosamine, glucosamine, and glucose but not by <b>allose,</b> 5 -thioglucose, xylose, glucose 6 -phosphate and glucuronic acid. Salicylhydroxamate, KCN, iodoacetate, and 2, 4 -dinitrophenol inhibited the high-affinity transporter, suggesting it required ATP. Ouabain, monensin, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, and N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide also inhibited deoxyglucose uptake, as did the replacement of Na+ in the incubation medium with choline, indicating requirements for Na+ and H+. The high-affinity system was also inhibited by the protein synthesis inhibitors cycloheximide and chloramphenicol. In contrast, the low-affinity system transported deoxyglucose by facilitated diffusion mechanisms.

The method allows introduction {{of a wide range of}} substituent types, it is regio- and stereospecific, and the later diversity steps are performed on solid phase. Further, the same process was applied oil glucose mid <b>allose</b> scaffolds, in the exemplified cases, and is likely adaptable to other pyranose building blocks. The methods developed in this work give access to molecules that position the three selected binding elements in various 3 D orientations oil a pyranose scaffold and have been applied for the production of a systematically diverse library of several hundred monosaccharide-based mimetics...|$|E
