The segment was a parody of the Vice Presidential debate between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan.

5|$|The Girl {{is based}} on Donald Spoto's 2009 book, Spellbound by Beauty: Alfred Hitchcock and His Leading Ladies, which {{examines}} the relationships between Alfred Hitchcock and the female stars of his films. Spoto wrote that Hitchcock attempted to turn Tippi Hedren (star of The Birds and Marnie) into his perfect woman, choosing the clothes and lipstick he thought she should wear. Hedren told Spoto that Hitchcock fantasised <b>about</b> <b>running</b> off with her.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1969, Biden ran as a Democrat for the New Castle County Council on {{a liberal}} {{platform}} that included support for public {{housing in the}} suburban area. He won by a solid, two-thousand vote margin in the usually Republican district and in a bad year for Democrats in the state. Even before taking his seat, he was already talking <b>about</b> <b>running</b> for the U.S. Senate {{in a couple of}} years. He served on the County Council from 1970 to 1972 while continuing his private law practice. Among issues he addressed on the council was his opposition to large highway projects that might disrupt Wilmington neighborhoods, including those related to Interstate 95.|$|E

5|$|On October 5, 1949, Douglas made a radio {{appearance}} announcing her candidacy. She attacked Downey almost continuously {{throughout the}} remainder of the year, accusing him of being a do-nothing, a tool of big business, and an agent of oil interests. She hired Harold Tipton, a newcomer to California who had managed a successful congressional campaign in the Seattle area, as her campaign manager. Douglas realized that Nixon would most likely be the Republican nominee, and felt that were she to win the primary, the wide gap between Nixon's positions and hers would cause voters to rally to her. Downey, who suffered from a severe ulcer, was initially undecided <b>about</b> <b>running,</b> but announced his candidacy in early December in a speech that included an attack on Douglas. Earl Desmond, a member of the California State Senate from Sacramento whose positions were similar to Downey's, also entered the race.|$|E
5|$|Schwarzkopf {{returned}} to the United States after the Gulf War as a national hero, {{and his ability to}} effectively deal with the press left him a positive image. Schwarzkopf indicated a desire to retire from the military in mid-1991. He was initially considered for promotion alternatively to General of the Army or to Army Chief of Staff, and was ultimately asked to assume the latter post, but he declined. He was later questioned <b>about</b> <b>running</b> for political office, but, considering himself an independent, expressed little interest in doing so. Schwarzkopf was not vocal about his political opinions during his military career. He retired from the military in August 1991, moving to Tampa, Florida.|$|E
5|$|In April 1962, McGovern {{announced}} he would run for election to South Dakota's other Senate seat, intending to face incumbent Republican Francis H. Case. Case died in June, however, and McGovern instead faced an appointed senator, former Lieutenant Governor Joseph H. Bottum. Much of the campaign revolved around policies of the Kennedy administration and its New Frontier; Bottum accused the Kennedy family of trying to buy the Senate seat. McGovern appealed to those worried about the outflux of young people from the state, and had the strong support of the Farmers Union. Polls showed Bottum slightly ahead throughout the race and McGovern was hampered by a recurrence of his hepatitis problem in the final weeks of the campaign. (During this hospitalization, McGovern read Theodore H. White's classic The Making of the President, 1960 {{and for the first}} time began thinking <b>about</b> <b>running</b> for the office someday.) Eleanor McGovern campaigned for her ailing husband and may have preserved his chance of winning. The November 1962 election result was very close and required a recount, but McGovern's 127,458 votes prevailed by a margin of 597, making him the first Democratic senator from the state in 26 years and only the third since statehood in 1889.|$|E

5|$|With {{all of the}} {{evidence}} of the Bay Harbor Butcher murders pointing to Doakes as the killer, the case is closed. Forensic investigator Vince Masuka (C. S. Lee) tells Dexter the gas in the cabin was turned on while the stove was lit, and when Dexter sees his own satellite navigation system while cataloging evidence, he realizes that Lila must have found the cabin. He meets with her at the aquarium and tells her that he, like her, has no emotion and lives a life devoid of feeling. They form plans to leave Miami together, though Dexter secretly intends to kill her. When he visits her apartment the next day, though, he finds Debra there, trying to persuade Lila to leave town. Dexter is forced to lie <b>about</b> <b>running</b> away with Lila in front of Debra, so a hurt Lila then leaves with what she recognizes as Dexter's bag of murder equipment. She goes to Rita's house and drugs the babysitter so that she can abduct the children, Astor and Cody (Christina Robinson and Preston Bailey). When Dexter realizes that Astor and Cody are missing, he goes straight to Lila's apartment, where she lights another fire and locks the three of them inside. Rita calls Debra for her help, and Debra decides to skip her flight to Oregon with Lundy to help with finding the children. Dexter manages to free Astor and Cody through a small window and eventually rams down a thin wall allowing him to escape.|$|E
25|$|In October 2009, it was {{reported}} that the Republican Party had approached Sullenberger <b>about</b> <b>running</b> against Democratic U.S. Representative Jerry McNerney of California's 11th congressional district in the 2010 elections.

He did not seek re-election to city council in the 2005 election, {{in part because of}} lingering opposition to amalgamation among his electorate.|$|E

The axes are alternatively designated as lateral, vertical, and longitudinal. These axes move with the vehicle and rotate relative to the Earth along with the craft.

25|$|In 1894, a {{group of}} reform Republicans {{approached}} Roosevelt <b>about</b> <b>running</b> for Mayor of New York again; he declined, mostly due to his wife's resistance to being removed from the Washington social set.

He retreated to the Dakotas for a time; his wife Edith regretted her role in the decision and vowed {{that there would be no}} repeat of it.|$|E
25|$|The {{new cars}} were {{numbered}} 156 to 180. Two were promised for December 1919, and two for each succeeding month, but owing to various strikes no cars arrived until May, when ten arrived, all without brakes: apparently the brake manufacturers {{were still on}} strike. Many complaints were coming in that there were insufficient cars on each service and the Manager stated that he had 27 cars off the road awaiting spares. A member of the council inquired as to when the newly arrived cars would be working, and when told about the brakes remarked <b>about</b> <b>running</b> a non-stop service.|$|E

25|$|After {{receiving}} the Gunzo Award for his 1979 literary work Hear the Wind Sing, Murakami did not aspire {{to meet other}} writers. Aside from Sarah Lawrence's Mary Morris, whom he briefly mentions in his memoir What I Talk About When I Talk <b>About</b> <b>Running</b> alongside Joyce Carol Oates and Toni Morrison, Murakami was never {{a part of a}} community of writers, his reason being that he was a loner and was never fond of groups, schools, and literary circles. When working on a book, Murakami states that he relies on his wife, who is always his first reader. While he never acquainted himself with many writers, Murakami enjoys the works of Ryu Murakami and Banana Yoshimoto.|$|E
