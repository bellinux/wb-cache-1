5|$|Evans used a woodblock {{printing}} technique known as chromoxylography, {{which was used}} primarily for inexpensive serialised books and children's books requiring few colours, so as to maximize profits.

Evans possessed a meticulous eye for detail and used a hand-press <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> as a dozen colour blocks for a single image.

5|$|In 1847, Queen Victoria issued new {{statutes}} eliminating all {{references to}} an exclusively military Order.
