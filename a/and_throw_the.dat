5|$|The decathlon was a {{relatively}} new event in modern athletics, although it {{had been part of}} American track meets since the 1880s and a version had been featured on the program of the 1904 St.Louis Olympics. The events of the new decathlon differed slightly from the American version. Both seemed appropriate for Thorpe, who was so versatile that he served as Carlisle's one-man team in several track meets. According to his obituary in The New York Times, he could run the 100-yard dash in 10seconds flat; the 220 in 21.8seconds; the 440 in 51.8seconds; the 880 in 1:57, the mile in 4:35; the 120-yard high hurdles in 15seconds; and the 220-yard low hurdles in 24seconds. He could long jump 23ft 6in and high-jump 6ft 5in. He could pole vault 11feet; put the shot 47ft 9in; throw the javelin 163feet; <b>and</b> <b>throw</b> <b>the</b> discus 136feet.|$|E
5|$|From 1277, Stratton {{acted in}} the {{capacity}} as Countess Isabella's steward, though he never officially used that title. It was in this post that he committed {{some of his most}} grievous offences. In 1278 he was accused of cutting off the seal of a charter from Quarr Abbey, thereby invalidating its authenticity. As a result, several other similar cases were brought to light, but none led to conviction. It was widely believed that he had bought himself off with bribes. Stratton's transgressions continued however, and by the late 1280s the complaints reached King Edward I. Edward returned from a prolonged stay in Gascony in late 1289, and immediately started a purge of corruption in the royal administration, including proceedings against Ralph de Hengham, Chief Justice of the King's Bench. Stratton was relieved of his office of chamberlain, along with his temporal possessions, on 17 January 1290. On his arrest, £12,666 17s 7d was found in his possession, a vast sum at the time, equivalent to about £ in present-day terms. According to the chronicle of Bartholomew Cotton, a silk-lined chest was also discovered, containing fingernail and toenail clippings, women's pubic hair, and feet of toads and moles. These were considered the ingredients of witchcraft, and the box was sealed up by officials, but Stratton managed to break the seal <b>and</b> <b>throw</b> <b>the</b> contents down a latrine.|$|E

5|$|Tom {{is arrested}} {{by the police and}} the guests prepare to leave. Lois goes to comfort Tom's co-anchor, Diane Simmons, only to {{intuitively}} realize she is the true murderer when Diane shows a dress for her solo debut on the news, even though she couldn't have known Tom would be leaving. Diane reveals that she had dated Woods until he dumped her upon her fortieth birthday, around which Tom arranged her to be replaced on the Channel 5 News. Seeking revenge, Diane bribed Priscilla to make James become a born-again Christian <b>and</b> <b>throw</b> <b>the</b> dinner party so she could murder Woods and frame Tom for the crime, but was forced to kill the other guests after her plan went awry upon Stephanie's accidental death. Priscilla woke up when she was removing the knife due to Joe pointing out her fingerprints were on it, so had her throat slit. When Diane was hiding the body in Tom's room, Muriel saw her so was stabbed. The murderess did not have time to conceal the knife, but was able to wipe her fingerprints clean. She killed Derek to stop the police getting involved. Diane then attempts to silence Lois by forcing her outside to a nearby cliff, only to be be shot down herself with a suppressed sniper rifle fired by Stewie, who proclaims if anyone were to kill Lois, he would be the one to do it.|$|E
25|$|One day in March Khande Rao Holkar, Malhar Rao's son, was {{inspecting}} {{his army}} {{in an open}} palanquin. He was fired upon from the fort and hit by a cannonball, dying on 17 March.

25|$|Birds such as flickers, acorn woodpeckers, Mexican jays, and flycatchers {{are typical}} predators of M. flavitarsis. In {{addition}} to birds, ants will often try {{to invade the}} wasp nests. The wasps fight back by attempting to drive <b>and</b> <b>throw</b> <b>the</b> ants off the nest. They will also rub their abdomen on nest surfaces to deter ants from approaching. One final predator of M. flavitarsis is the praying mantis, which will eat perching males during mating season.|$|E

25|$|Normandy has {{an annual}} Guy Fawkes Night {{firework}} display {{located in a}} field {{at the back of}} The Elms Centre on Glaziers Lane. Car parking is available at The Elms Centre car park during this time. The event usually takes place on 5 November every year. During the event, volunteers parade down a bridleway next to the field holding torches, <b>and</b> <b>throw</b> <b>the</b> torches onto the large bonfire to light it. The fireworks are all set off by hand, not by electronics.|$|E
25|$|Water polo is a {{competitive}} team sport {{played in the}} water between two teams. The game consists of four quarters, usually of eight minutes, {{in which the two}} teams attempt to score goals <b>and</b> <b>throw</b> <b>the</b> ball into their opponent's goal. The team with the most goals {{at the end of the}} game wins the match. Each team made up of six field players and one goalkeeper. Except for the goalkeeper, players participate in both offensive and defensive roles. Water polo is typically played in an all-deep pool seven feet (or two meters) deep.|$|E
25|$|Aaron {{spent the}} winter of 1953 playing in Puerto Rico. Mickey Owen, the team's manager, helped Aaron with his batting stance. Up to that time, Aaron hit most pitches to left field or center field, but after working with Owen, Aaron was able {{to hit the ball}} more {{effectively}} all over the field. During his stay in Puerto Rico, Owen also helped Aaron to transition from second baseman to outfielder. Aaron had not played well at second base, but Owen had noted that Aaron could catch fly balls <b>and</b> <b>throw</b> <b>the</b> ball well from the outfield to the infield.|$|E

25|$|After singing The Star-Spangled Banner, {{while the}} {{opposing}} team is being introduced, members of the student section take out {{a copy of the}} student-run newspaper, The University Daily Kansan, and wave the paper in front of their faces, pretending to be reading it in an effort to show lack of interest in {{the opposing team}}. After the opponents are introduced, a short video is shown, detailing the history and the accomplishments of Kansas basketball. As the Jayhawks are introduced, the students rip up their newspapers <b>and</b> <b>throw</b> <b>the</b> confetti pieces of paper in the air as celebration. Whatever confetti remains is typically thrown in the air after the first basket made by the Jayhawks.|$|E
25|$|Godley {{defended the}} bridge for two hours, until {{he ran out}} of ammunition. His final act was to {{dismantle}} the gun <b>and</b> <b>throw</b> <b>the</b> pieces into the canal. He attempted to crawl to safety, but advancing German soldiers caught him and took him to a prisoner of war camp. His wounds were treated, but he remained in camp until the Armistice. Originally it was thought that he had been killed, but some time later it was found that he was a prisoner of war in a camp called Delotz at Dallgow-Döberitz. It was in the camp that he was informed that he had been awarded the Victoria Cross. Godley left the camp in 1918 after the guards fled their posts. He received the actual medal from King George V, at Buckingham Palace, on 15 February 1919.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} casamento poveiro (Povoan marriage), {{in which}} the newly-wed couple was covered by a fisherman's net and watered with vinho verde {{in order to bring}} fortune to the marriage, is becoming a forgotten practice. In Póvoa's tradition (that persists to the present day), the heir of the family is the youngest son (as in old Brittany and Denmark). The younger son is the heir because it was expected that he would take care of his parents when they became old. Also, unlike the rest of the nation, it is the woman who governs and leads the family – this matriarchy is derived {{from the fact that the}} man was usually fishing at sea. The Danish professor Heningser noticed that several features in the Povoan fishermen cultural life were similar to those found in the Jutland fjords, one of which, the women's sign of mourning, putting the skirt on the shoulders <b>and</b> <b>throw</b> <b>the</b> head, was found only in Northern Denmark and Póvoa de Varzim.|$|E

25|$|Prisoners {{developed}} {{hand signals}} to communicate {{things they did}} not want the guards or other prisoners to hear. When a prisoner wanted to pass a note down to a girlfriend, he would attach a little bundle {{to the end of a}} long rope woven from mattress fibers <b>and</b> <b>throw</b> <b>the</b> bundle down into the street. The girlfriend down below would run to catch the bundle and take out the note. This would also give her an opportunity to stuff a note, cigarettes, drugs, a photograph of their child, a weapon, into the bundle, which the inmate could then hoist back up through the hole in the wall, before the guards came running to intercept the line. They called these rope and bundle setups palomas ("pigeons") and apparently, at any given time, seven or eight palomas could be flying down into the street, or back up to the prison, attached to their makeshift ropes.|$|E
25|$|During October, the {{division}} constructed a defensive {{line in the}} bridgehead. The line had a length of 40 kilometers and a depth of 12 kilometers. Its antitank defences were based on field artillery and antitank ditches, as well as landmines. On 14 October, the White Army made a last desperate attack to capture the bridgehead <b>and</b> <b>throw</b> <b>the</b> 51st back across the Dnieper. Despite tank support, the White Army attack failed. In preparation for the final Red Army offensive, {{the division}} received reinforcements. The division's objective was to destroy the White 2nd Corps and capture the White fortifications on the Perekop Isthmus. The 51st, 15th and Latvian Rifle Divisions, a separate cavalry brigade, cavalry regiment and armored car detachment formed the Perekop Strike Group. The attack began on 28 October and the division had captured Perekop by the next day. The division renewed the attack on 30 October, {{but was unable to}} overrun the Turetsky Val and had to dig in. Blyukher had the advance units withdrawn from within range of White fire.|$|E
25|$|Later that year, Gan Ning {{participated in}} Sun Quan's {{campaign}} to {{seize control of}} Hefei, which was defended by Cao Cao's general Zhang Liao. Sun Quan was unable to capture Hefei after besieging the city for days and suffering defeats in the initial skirmishes, and he eventually withdrew his forces when a plague broke out in his army. Sun Quan's other units retreated first, while Sun remained behind at Xiaoyao Ford (逍遙津) with only about 1,000 men and a few officers (including Lü Meng, Jiang Qin, Ling Tong and Gan Ning). When Zhang Liao saw that, he {{seized the opportunity to}} launch a devastating counterattack <b>and</b> <b>throw</b> <b>the</b> enemy into confusion. Gan Ning led a group of archers to fire arrows at the enemy while Ling Tong and the others fought fiercely to protect their lord. Gan Ning shouted at the men to beat the war drums and blow the horns loudly to raise the army's morale. Sun Quan eventually succeeded in escaping but his forces sustained heavy losses. He praised Gan Ning for his acts of courage after the battle.|$|E

The townspeople, {{including}} Jesus, joyfully praise Smith as a hero. As the singer walks {{off into the}} sunset, Kyle calls out [...] "Disintegration is the best album ever!". The boys split the diamond again {{to try to prevent}} anyone else from getting its power <b>and</b> <b>throw</b> <b>the</b> pieces in the trash can. However, Kyle's little brother Ike finds the pieces of the diamond in the trash, resulting in the episode ending with the boys cowering {{in the presence of a}} new foe: Mecha-Ike.|$|E
500|$|During his {{coaching}} career from 1922 to 1964, E. A. Diddle of Western Kentucky University began carrying a red towel with {{him during the}} basketball games he coached. Diddle would wave <b>and</b> <b>throw</b> <b>the</b> towel during games, and the concept was adopted by fans of the college. It became an official {{part of the school}} logo in 1971. Fans of the undefeated 1972 Miami Dolphins cheered the team by waving the [...] "Horrible Hanky"—white handkerchiefs. However, the handkerchiefs were deemed [...] "too dainty" [...] for football, and the tradition faded. [...] "Hate the Yankees Hankies", in reference to the franchise's rivalry with the New York Yankees, were handkerchiefs distributed to Cleveland Indians fans in September 1977 in a promotion.|$|E
500|$|If {{an error}} occurs during the play when a batter records a hit, the {{official}} scorer must {{determine whether the}} batter would have advanced {{as far as he}} did had the error not occurred. For example, if a batter hits a ball into an outfield gap, the ball is badly misplayed by an outfielder attempting to retrieve <b>and</b> <b>throw</b> <b>the</b> ball back into the infield, and the batter is able to reach all four bases to score, then the official scorer must decide whether an error should be charged to the outfielder. If no error is charged, then the batter would be credited with an [...] "inside the park" [...] home run. If an error is charged to the outfielder, then the batter would likely be credited with either a double or triple.|$|E
