40|$|Aluminium {{salt slag}} (also known as <b>aluminium</b> <b>salt</b> <b>cake),</b> which is {{produced}} by the secondary aluminium industry, is formed during aluminium scrap/dross melting and contains 15 - 30 % aluminium oxide, 30 - 55 % sodium chloride, 15 - 30 % potassium chloride, 5 - 7 % metallic aluminium and impurities (carbides, nitrides, sulphides and phosphides). Depending on the raw mix the amount of salt slag produced per tonne of secondary aluminium ranges from 200 to 500. kg. As salt slag has been classified as toxic and hazardous waste, it should be managed {{in compliance with the}} current legislation. Its landfill disposal is forbidden in most of the European countries and it should be recycled and processed in a proper way by taking the environmental impact into consideration. This paper presents a review of the aluminium salt slag chemical and mineralogical characteristics, as well as various processes for metal recovery, recycling of sodium and potassium chlorides content back to the smelting process and preparation of value added products from the final non metallic residue. © 2012 Elsevier B.

40|$|One {{waste product}} in {{recycling}} of Al is <b>salt</b> <b>cake,</b> {{a mixture of}} Al, salts, and residue oxides. Several methods have been proposed to recycle <b>salt</b> <b>cake,</b> one involving high-temperature leaching of salts from the <b>salt</b> <b>cake.</b> The <b>salt</b> composition can be approximated as a mixture predominantly of NaCl and KCl salts, with lesser amounts of Mg chloride. In order to better assess the feasibility of recycling <b>salt</b> <b>cake,</b> an experimental study was conducted of phase equilibria in the system H{sub 2 }O-NaCl-KCl-MgCl{sub 2 } at pressure (P), temperature (T), and composition conditions appropriate for high- temperature <b>salt</b> <b>cake</b> recycling. These experiments were designed to evaluate the effect of small amounts (2 - 10 wt%) of MgCl{sub 2 } on solubilities of halite (NaCl) and sylvite (KCl) in saturated solutions (30 - 50 wt% NaCl+KCl; NaCl:KCl = 1 : 1 and 3 : 1) at elevated P and T...|$|R
40|$|Electrodialysis {{technology}} for recovering salt from aluminum <b>salt</b> <b>cake</b> {{is being developed}} at Argonne National Laboratory. <b>Salt</b> <b>cake,</b> a slag-like aluminum-industry waste stream, contains aluminum metal, salt (NaCl and KCl), and nonmetallics (primarily aluminum oxide). <b>Salt</b> <b>cake</b> can be recycled by digesting with water and filtering to recover the metal and oxide values. A major obstacle to widespread <b>salt</b> <b>cake</b> recycling {{is the cost of}} recovering salt from the process brine. Electrodialysis technology developed at Argonne appears to be a cost-effective approach to handling the salt brines, compared to evaporation or disposal. In Argonne's technology, the salt brine is concentrated until salt crystals are precipitated in the electrodialysis stack; the crystals are recovered downstream. The technology is being evaluated on the pilot scale using Eurodia's EUR 40 - 76 - 5 stack...|$|R
40|$|Component {{phases of}} Al <b>salt</b> <b>cake</b> or {{products}} from processing <b>salt</b> <b>cake,</b> resist dissolution, a key {{first step in}} most analysis procedures. In this work (analysis support to a study of conversion of <b>salt</b> <b>cake</b> fines to value-added oxide products), analysis methods were adapted or devised for determining leachable salt, total halides (Cl and F), Al metal, and elemental composition. Leaching of <b>salt</b> <b>cake</b> fines was by ultrasonic agitation with deionized water. The leachate was analyzed for anions by ion chromatography and for cations by ICP-atomic emission spectroscopy. Only chloride could be measured in the anions, and charge balances between cations and chloride were near unity, indicating that all major dissolved species were chloride salts. For total halides, the chloride and fluorides components were first decomposed by KOH fusion, and the dissolved chloride and fluoride were measured by ion chromatography. Al metal in the fines was determined by a hydrogen evolution procedure adapted for submilligram quantities of metallic Al: the Al was reacted with HCl in a closed system containing a measured amount of high-purity He. After reaction, the H/He ratio was measured by mass spectroscopy. Recoveries of Al metal standards (about 30 mg) averaged 93 %. Comparison of the acid evolution with caustic reaction of the Al metal showed virtually identical results, but reaction was faster in the acid medium. Decomposition of the <b>salt</b> <b>cake</b> with mineral acids left residues {{that had to be}} dissolved by fusion with Na carbonate. Better dissolution was obtained by fusing the <b>salt</b> <b>cake</b> with Li tetraborate; the resulting solution could be used for accurate Al assay of <b>salt</b> <b>cake</b> materials by classical 8 -hydroxyquinolate gravimetry...|$|R
40|$|Researchers {{characterized}} {{high-level waste}} derived from dissolved <b>salt</b> <b>cake</b> from the Savannah River Site (SRS) tank farm and measured the cesium distribution coefficients (DCs) for extraction, scrub, and stripping {{steps of the}} caustic-side solvent extraction (CSSX) flowsheet. The measurements used two SRS high-level waste samples derived entirely or in part from <b>salt</b> <b>cake.</b> The chemical compositions of both samples are reported. Dissolved <b>salt</b> <b>cake</b> waste contained less Cs- 137 and more dianions than is typical of supernate samples. Extraction, scrub, and strip DCs values for both samples exceeded process requirements and agreed well with model predictions. The results indicate no significant problems processing dissolved <b>salt</b> <b>cake</b> compared to supernate. During the course of testing, researchers observed sorption of cesium on glass sample vials containing strip solutions. The problem was detected in the material balance calculated for each organic/aqueous contact. Methods and recommendations for avoiding this problem are discussed...|$|R

30|$|<b>Aluminium</b> <b>salts</b> (<b>{{aluminium}}</b> hydroxide, aluminium phosphate, aluminium potassium sulphate) {{are widely}} used as adjuvants in vaccines and in allergy immunoterapy, due to their immunogenic effect. This activity, {{once thought to be}} due to “depot” effect, is probable caused by an increased activity of antigen presenting cells or by an increase of cytokines and complement production [74]. DTP, hepatitis A and B, Haemophilus Influentiae B vaccines are prepared adsorbing the antigens in either an aluminium hydroxide or aluminium phosphate gel. As an alternative, antigens are precipitated in a solution of alum.

50|$|Elemental {{aluminium}} {{cannot be}} produced by the electrolysis of an aqueous <b>aluminium</b> <b>salt</b> because hydronium ions readily oxidize elemental aluminium. Although a molten <b>aluminium</b> <b>salt</b> could be used instead, aluminium oxide has a melting point of 2072 °C so electrolysing it is impractical. In the Hall-Héroult process, alumina, Al2O3, is dissolved in molten synthetic cryolite, Na3AlF6, to lower its melting point for easier electrolysis.|$|R

50|$|Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele {{discovered}} in 1772 that salt brine heated with litharge yielded {{small amounts of}} caustic soda. Over the following years, several others modified this approach. It was observed that mixing sodium sulfate (<b>salt</b> <b>cake)</b> with iron filings and coal produced sodium carbonate (known as soda ash). Another approach involved mixing <b>salt</b> or <b>salt</b> <b>cake</b> with calcium hydroxide (slaked lime). These methods produced small amounts of poor quality soda ash, unsuitable for large-scale output.|$|R

Simulated sluicing of large simulated <b>salt</b> <b>cake</b> and hard pan waste coupons was also performed. Due to operational difficulties experienced with the Government supplied load cell, no meaningful results with respect to sluice stream impact pressure distribution or stream coherence were obtained.
