5|$|Clicks <b>are</b> <b>quick</b> {{broadband}} burst pulses, {{used for}} sonar, although some lower-frequency broadband vocalizations may serve a non-echolocative purpose such as communication; for example, the pulsed calls of belugas. Pulses in a click train are emitted at intervals of ~35–50 milliseconds, {{and in general}} these inter-click intervals are slightly greater than the round-trip time of sound to the target.|$|E

5|$|Although usually sedate and approachable underwater, Pacific {{angelsharks}} <b>are</b> <b>quick</b> to bite if touched, captured, {{or otherwise}} provoked, and can inflict severe lacerations. Commercial fisheries for this species exist off Baja California {{and to a}} lesser extent off California (see below); the meat is considered excellent and is sold fresh or frozen. This species is captured in limited numbers by recreational fishers using hook-and-line, spears, or even by hand, particularly off southern California. It is also taken as bycatch in shrimp trawls operating in the Gulf of California, and processed into fishmeal. The capacity of this species to withstand a focused fishing effort is limited, due to its low rates of reproduction and movement.|$|E

5|$|Andalusian {{horses are}} elegant and {{strongly}} built. Members of the breed have heads of medium length, {{with a straight}} or slightly convex profile. Ultra convex and concave profiles are discouraged in the breed, and are penalized in breed shows. Necks are long and broad, running to well-defined withers and a massive chest. They have a short back and broad, strong hindquarters with a well-rounded croup. The breed tends to have clean legs, with no propensity for blemishes or injuries, and energetic gaits. The mane and tail are thick and long, but the legs do not have excess feathering. Andalusians tend to be docile, while remaining intelligent and sensitive. When treated with respect they <b>are</b> <b>quick</b> to learn, responsive, and cooperative.|$|E
5|$|Complex nests {{are built}} by many ant species, but other species are nomadic {{and do not}} build {{permanent}} structures. Ants may form subterranean nests or build them on trees. These nests {{may be found in}} the ground, under stones or logs, inside logs, hollow stems, or even acorns. The materials used for construction include soil and plant matter, and ants carefully select their nest sites; Temnothorax albipennis will avoid sites with dead ants, as these may indicate the presence of pests or disease. They <b>are</b> <b>quick</b> to abandon established nests {{at the first sign of}} threats.|$|E
5|$|Night sharks <b>are</b> <b>quick,</b> nocturnally active, {{schooling}} predators {{that feed}} mainly on small bony fishes and squid. Reproduction is viviparous {{as with the}} other members of its family; females mate during the summer and give birth to litters of usually 1218 pups after a gestation period of a year. This deepwater species is not known to pose a danger to humans. It is caught incidentally by commercial tuna and swordfish longline fisheries in the western Atlantic, and also by a targeted longline fishery operating off northeastern Brazil. The night shark is highly valued for its fins, and additionally as a source of meat, liver oil, and fishmeal. However, most sharks caught off northeastern Brazil have been found to contain unsafe concentrations of mercury.|$|E

5|$|Where spotted hyenas and lions {{occupy the}} same {{geographic}} area, {{the two species}} occupy the same ecological niche, and are thus in direct competition with one another. In some cases, the extent of dietary overlap can {{be as high as}} 68.8%. Lions typically ignore spotted hyenas, unless they are on a kill or are being harassed by them. There exists a common misconception that hyenas steal kills from lions, but most often it is the other way around. Lions will readily steal the kills of spotted hyenas; in the Ngorongoro Crater, it is common for lions to subsist largely on kills stolen from hyenas. Lions <b>are</b> <b>quick</b> to follow the calls of hyenas feeding, a fact demonstrated by field experiments, during which lions repeatedly approached whenever the tape-recorded calls of hyenas feeding were played. When confronted on a kill by lions, spotted hyenas will either leave or wait patiently at a distance of 30–100 metres until the lions have finished eating. In some cases, spotted hyenas are bold enough to feed alongside lions, and may occasionally force lions off a kill. This mostly occurs during the nighttime, when hyenas are bolder. Spotted hyenas usually prevail against groups of lionesses unaccompanied by males if they outnumber them 4:1. In some instances they were seen to have taken on and routed two pride males while outnumbering them 5:1. The two species may act aggressively toward one another even when there is no food at stake. Lions may charge at hyenas and maul them for no apparent reason; one male lion was filmed killing two hyenas on separate occasions without eating them, and lion predation can account for up to 71% of hyena deaths in Etosha. Spotted hyenas have adapted to this pressure by frequently mobbing lions which enter their territories. Experiments on captive spotted hyenas revealed that specimens with no prior experience with lions act indifferently to the sight of them, but will react fearfully to the scent.|$|E

25|$|These {{strategies}} shield slums {{from the}} risk of being noticed and removed when they are small and most vulnerable to local government officials. Initial homes tend to be tents and shacks that <b>are</b> <b>quick</b> to install, but as slum grows, becomes established and newcomers pay the informal association or gang for the right to live in the slum, the construction materials for the slums switches to more lasting materials such as bricks and concrete, suitable for slum's topography.|$|E
25|$|Being {{alert and}} vigilant, the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog {{is a good}} watchdog. They tend to notice {{everything}} in their surroundings and <b>are</b> <b>quick</b> to sound alarm. Faced with a threat, they will stand their ground {{and put on a}} show that will intimidate those unfamiliar with the dog. Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs are accepting of a non-threatening stranger. They are confident and comfortable in unfamiliar locations, and are stable around strange noises and unfamiliar people. They are accepting of other dogs and species, and are reluctant to bite.|$|E
25|$|The {{tempo of}} marches varies significantly. While most bands perform marches {{in their own}} tempo, most marches <b>are</b> <b>quick</b> (faster than a waltz, as fast as or slower than a polka). As alluded to before, most march composers did not {{designate}} a specific tempo on their manuscripts. However, {{that is not to}} say the march music composer is random with his/her tempo while conducting the march. For example, John Philip Sousa conducted his marches using around 120 beats per minute. Most European march composers, however, conducted their marches in a slower style, using around 100 beats per minute. There are, however, many and notable exceptions: see concert march and screamer.|$|E

25|$|Some large parrot species, {{including}} large cockatoos, amazons, and macaws, {{have very}} long lifespans, with 80 years being reported, and record ages of over 100. Small parrots, such as lovebirds, hanging parrots, and budgies, have shorter lifespans up to 15–20 years. Some parrot species {{can be quite}} loud, {{and many of the}} larger parrots can be destructive and require a very large cage, and a regular supply of new toys, branches, or other items to chew up. The intelligence of parrots means they <b>are</b> <b>quick</b> to learn tricks and other behaviours—both good and bad—that get them what they want, such as attention or treats.|$|E
25|$|Humans are {{the primary}} predators on markhor. Because markhor inhabit very steep and {{inaccessible}} mountainous habitat, several strongholds of markhor populations have been rarely approached by man. Golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) have been reported preying upon young markhor. Among wild carnivores, Himalayan lynx (Felis lynx), leopard cats (Felis bengalensis), snow leopards (Panthera uncia), wolves (Canis lupus), and black bears (Ursus thibetanus) are the main predators of markhor. Because of these threats, the markhor possess keen eyesight and {{a strong sense of}} smell to detect nearby predators. Markhor are very aware of their surroundings and are on high alert for predators. In exposed areas, they <b>are</b> <b>quick</b> to spot and flee from predators.|$|E
25|$|Pakistani snacks {{comprise}} {{food items}} in Pakistan that <b>are</b> <b>quick</b> to prepare, spicy, usually fried, and eaten {{in the evening}} or morning with tea or with {{any one of the}} meals as a side dish. A given snack may be part of a local culture, and its preparation and popularity can vary from place to place.
