The Gini-coefficient result showed that the <b>gum</b> <b>arabic</b> market in the state was concentrated and there was high inequality in the income distribution among the <b>gum</b> <b>arabic</b> marketers. The rate of return to scale (RTS) was 1. 061, which implies that <b>gum</b> <b>arabic</b> marketing in the study area was in stage 1 of the production function.

The use of alkalis as binders, in the form of natron or plant ash, produced suitable results in experiments.

5000|$|Watercolour paint has {{the virtue}} of being more {{permanent}} than dyes, but is less transparent and so more likely to obscure details. Hand-colouring with watercolours {{requires the use of}} a medium to prevent the colours from drying with a dull and lifeless finish. Before the paint can be applied, the surface of the print must be primed so that the colours are not repelled. This often includes prepping the print with a thin coating of shellac, then adding grit before colouring. Watercolour paint used in photographic hand-colouring consists of four ingredients: pigments (natural or synthetic), a binder (traditionally <b>arabic</b> <b>gum),</b> additives to improve plasticity (such as glycerine), and a solvent to dilute the paint (i.e. water) that evaporates when the paint dries. The paint is typically applied to prints using a soft brush. Watercolours often [...] "leave a darker edge of color at the boundaries of the painted area." [...] Since different pigments have varying degrees of transparency, the choice of colours must be considered carefully. More transparent pigments are preferred, since they ensure greater visibility of the photographic image.|$|E

This study was under-taken {{to examine the effects}} of <b>arabic</b> <b>gum</b> (AG), which is commonly used in processed foods, on acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity in mice. Mice were given <b>arabic</b> <b>gum</b> orally (100 g l− 1) 5 days before a hepatotoxic dose of acetaminophen (500 mg kg− 1) intraperitoneally. <b>Arabic</b> <b>gum</b> administration dramatically reduced acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity as evidenced by reduced serum alanine (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities. Acetaminophen-induced hepatic lipid peroxidation was reduced significantly by <b>arabic</b> <b>gum</b> pretreatment. The protection offered by <b>arabic</b> <b>gum</b> does not appear to be caused by a decrease in the formation of toxic acetaminophen metabolites, which consumes glutathione, because <b>arabic</b> <b>gum</b> did not alter acetaminophen-induced hepatic glutathione depletion.

The interfacial tension of almond <b>gum</b> and <b>gum</b> <b>arabic</b> aqueous dispersions was measured using the pendant drop method in hexadecane. The asymptotic interfacial tension values for almond gum were significantly lower than the corresponding values measured for <b>gum</b> <b>arabic,</b> especially at high concentration. Rheological properties were characterized by steady and oscillatory tests using a coaxial geometry. Almond gum flow curves exhibited a shear thinning non-Newtonian behavior with a tendency to a Newtonian plateau at low shear rate, while <b>gum</b> <b>arabic</b> flow curves exhibited such behavior only at high shear rate. The influence of temperature (5 - 50 [*][*]℃) on the flow curves was studied at 4 % (m/m) gum concentration and the Newtonian viscosities at infinite and at zero shear rate, for <b>gum</b> <b>arabic</b> and almond <b>gum,</b> respectively, were accurately fitted by an Arrhenius-type equation. The dynamic properties of the two gum dispersions were also studied. Both gum dispersions exhibited viscoelastic properties, with the viscous component being predominant in a wider range of concentrations for almond gum, while for <b>gum</b> <b>arabic</b> the elastic component being higher than the elastic one especially at higher concentrations.
