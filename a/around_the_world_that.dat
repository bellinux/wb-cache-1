It stands for Laus Deo Semper which means Praise to God Always. These are both {{traditional}} Jesuit mottoes.|$|E
5|$|Some breeders {{have shown}} concern {{regarding}} {{the lack of}} genetic diversity in the breed due to inbreeding caused by a small gene pool. Researchers who completed the 2007 DNA {{study found that the}} Singapura (along with the Burmese) have the least genetic diversity among the 22 breeds studied. The possibility of outcrossing with another breed to increase the genetic diversity had been raised among CFA breeders, but not many were receptive to the idea, preferring to use Singapuras from <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> are not so closely related to the CFA line. In April 2013, UK's Governing Council of the Cat Fancy started allowing outcrossing for the breed. Individuals chosen have to meet certain health and appearance requirements.|$|E
5|$|In {{switching}} {{to what was}} essentially a gold standard, the United States joined a host of nations <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> based their currencies on gold alone. But in doing so, these nations exacerbated the demand for gold as opposed to silver which, combined with more silver being mined, drove the cost of gold up and silver down. The result was not apparent immediately after the Coinage Act's passage, but by 1879 the ratio between {{the price of gold}} and that of silver had risen from 16.4:1 to 18.4:1; by 1896 it was 30:1. The ultimate effect was more expensive gold, which meant lower prices and deflation for other goods. The deflation made the effects of the Panic of 1873 worse, making it more expensive for debtors to pay debts they had contracted when currency was less valuable. Farmers and laborers, especially, clamored for the return of coinage in both metals, believing the increased money supply would restore wages and property values, and the divide between pro- and anti-silver forces grew in the decades to come. Writing in 1895, Sherman defended the bill, saying that, barring some international agreement to switch the entire world to a bimetallic standard, the United States dollar should remain a gold-backed currency.|$|E

5|$|Some fungal populations <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> {{have been}} {{classified}} as C.violaceus {{have been found}} to belong to separate lineages and hence reclassified as new species within section Cortinarius. Two separate lineages discovered in populations from Costa Rica have been renamed Cortinarius palatinus and C.neotropicus, one from Guyana—described as sp. aff. violaceus—has become C.altissimus, and another from Western Australia and Tasmania described as both C.violaceus and sp. aff. violaceus has become C.hallowellensis. Yet another from Eastern Australia has been named C. kioloensis. The poorly known species Cortinarius subcalyptrosporus and Cortinarius atroviolaceus from Borneo are almost indistinguishable from C.violaceus outside of hard-to-observe spore detail—the former has smaller spores with a detached perisporium (outer layer) and the latter has smaller spores and fruiting bodies. Another population, known from Borneo, New Guinea and New Zealand, was ascribed to C.violaceus by Moser. It was noted as very similar to the original species concept of C.violaceus, and awaits description as a new species after a phylogenetic study revealed it to represent a distinct taxon.|$|E
