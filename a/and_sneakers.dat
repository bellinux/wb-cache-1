Early in her career, she used the Dunlop Max 200G racquet before {{switching}} to Wilson from 1994 to 1999. She first used the Wilson Pro Staff 7.0 lite, then switched to the Pro Staff 7.5 in 1996 and to the Pro Staff 7.1 in 1998. Graf's racquets were strung at 29 kilograms (64 pounds), significantly above the 50-60 pound range recommended by Wilson. In 2006, she signed an endorsement deal with Head. In 2010, Graf and Agassi collaborated with Head and developed the new line of Star Series tennis racquets.|$|E

40|$|Fish exhibit {{impaired}} sensory {{function and}} altered behaviour at levels of ocean acidification expected to occur owing to anthropogenic {{carbon dioxide emissions}} during this century. We provide the first evidence {{of the effects of}} ocean acidification on reproductive behaviour of fish in the wild. Satellite <b>and</b> <b>sneaker</b> male ocellated wrasse (Symphodus ocellatus) compete to fertilize eggs guarded by dominant nesting males. Key mating behaviours such as dominant male courtship and nest defence did not differ between sites with ambient versus elevated CO 2 concentrations. Dominant males did, however, experience significantly lower rates of pair spawning at elevated CO 2 levels. Despite the higher risk of sperm competition found at elevated CO 2, we also found a trend of lower satellite <b>and</b> <b>sneaker</b> male paternity at elevated CO 2. Given the importance of fish for food security and ecosystem stability, this study highlights the need for targeted research into the effects of rising CO 2 levels on patterns of reproduction in wild fish...|$|R
40|$|Severe {{intraspecific}} competition for mates selects for aggressive individuals {{but may also}} lead {{to the evolution of}} alternative phenotypes that do not act aggressively, yet manage to acquire matings. The two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, shows male mate-guarding behaviour and male-male combat for available females. This may provide opportunity for weaker males to avoid fighting by adopting alternative mating behaviour such as sneaker or satellite tactics as observed in other animals. We investigated male precopulatory behaviour in the two-spotted spider mite by means of video-techniques and found three types of male mating behaviour: territorial, <b>sneaker</b> <b>and</b> opportunistic. Territorial <b>and</b> <b>sneaker</b> males associate with female teleiochrysales and spend much time guarding them. Territorial males are easily disturbed by rival males and engage themselves in fights with them. However, sneaker males are not at all disturbed by rival males, never engage in fights and, strikingly, never face attack by territorial males. Opportunistic males wander around in search of females that are in the teleiochrysalis stage but very close to or at emergence. To quickly classify any given mate-guarding male as territorial or sneaker we developed a method based on the instantaneous response of males to disturbance by a live male mounted on top of a brush. We tested this method against the response of the same males to natural disturbance by two or three other males. Because this method proved to be successful, we used it to collect territorial <b>and</b> <b>sneaker</b> males, <b>and</b> subjected them to morphological analysis to assess whether the various behavioural phenotypes are associated with different morphological characters. However, we found no statistical differences between territorial <b>and</b> <b>sneaker</b> males, concerning the length of the first legs, the stylets, the pedipalps or the body...|$|R

In this study the effects of exogenous administration of arginine vasotocin (AVT, 3 μg/g body weight) on the behaviour of nest-holder males, <b>sneakers</b> <b>and</b> females was tested.

40|$|A {{mismatch}} in timing {{between the}} release {{of male and female}} gametes in external fertilizers may lead to failed fertilization or, under sperm competition, reduced paternity. To quantify the actual synchrony of gamete release and the level of sperm competition we placed video cameras on two spawning grounds of a naturally spawning population of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus). Females release eggs in response to courting (quivering) in less than 1 % of the cases, yet to both dominant <b>and</b> <b>sneaker</b> males. That is, females initiated spawning with dominant males in 73. 3 % of the recorded spawning events. Although the actual spawning seems to be largely under female control, 55. 6 % of spawning events occur under sperm competition. The average time delay between dominant <b>and</b> <b>sneaker</b> males milt release under sperm competition is 0. 68 s. Thus, female reproductive decisions seem to be strongly influenced by male-male competition and this may have {{set the stage for the}} evolution and maintenance of the observed plasticity in ejaculate characteristics of male charr...|$|R
