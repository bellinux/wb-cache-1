5|$|On May 21, 1832, a small raiding party {{made up of}} some {{independent}} minded braves from Keokuk's village or the Fox {{village at}} Dubuque's Mines carried out a raid on the settlement at present-day Savanna, Illinois on the Plum River. The party originated west of the Mississippi River and were probably motivated {{by a desire to}} collect needed supplies. When the small raiding party arrived at the settlement they found it practically deserted: only three men were present. Of the six men originally at the settlement, three had left when the raiding party arrived: Blundell was away, Upton was hunting nearby, and Davidson had left the area in search of a horse. Of the three men left at the settlement, Hays and Goss were trying to round up livestock, while only Pierce remained at the blockhouse. Pierce heard a dog barking outside <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> to see a small band of Native Americans creeping along the river's edge. He immediately sounded the alarm and Hays and Goss sprinted for the blockhouse. Gunshots started to explode behind the men as they approached the protection of their makeshift fortification.|$|E
5|$|Celestine Babayaro, who {{had been}} {{struggling}} with an injury, played no further part in the final and was substituted before the second half commenced. Terry came on in his place to partner Desailly, which meant Gallas moved to left-back. Arsenal resumed play and a shot by Henry was kept out by Cudicini. The scare brought Chelsea to life and resulted in the team enjoying their best spell of the match. Guðjohnsen's effort in the 57th minute forced a save from Seaman, who tipped the ball over the bar. Jesper Grønkjær then roamed forward and played the ball to Le Saux, but the defender's shot went well over. Chelsea continued to pile pressure on Arsenal; Grønkjær's pass intended for Hasselbaink in the 61st minute was intercepted just in time by Adams and Melchiot's header unsettled Seaman in goal. Wiltord then collected the ball from midfield and played a one-two with Henry, but directed his shot wide from the left flank. Chelsea made their second change in the 67th minute, bringing on Zola for Hasselbaink. The substitution {{did not have the}} desired effect as Arsenal went a goal ahead. Adams cleared the Chelsea danger and Wiltord's reverse pass found Parlour with acres of space to manoeuvre. The midfielder advanced as the Chelsea defence backed off <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> before curling the ball from 25 yards. His effort went over a diving Cudicini, into the top right-hand corner of the Chelsea goal.|$|E

25|$|As {{a student}} at Mount Airy High School, Griffith {{cultivated}} {{an interest in the}} arts, and he participated in the school's drama program. A growing love of music, particularly swing, would change his life. Griffith was raised Baptist <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> to Ed Mickey, a minister at Grace Moravian Church, who led the brass band and taught him to sing and play the trombone. Mickey nurtured Griffith's talent throughout high school until graduation in 1944. Griffith was delighted when he was offered a role in The Lost Colony by Paul Green, a play about Roanoke Island still performed today. He performed as a cast member of the play for several years, playing a variety of roles, until he finally landed the role of Sir Walter Raleigh, the namesake of North Carolina's capital.|$|E
25|$|The Ji Gong {{mentioned}} above, {{better known}} as Ji Jike (姬際可) or Ji Longfeng (姬隆丰), {{is said to have}} trained in Shaolin Monastery for ten years as a young man and was matchless with the spear. As the story goes, he later traveled to Xongju Cave on Mount Zhongnan to receive a boxing manual written by Yue Fei, from which he learned Xingyi. However, some believe Ji actually created the style himself and attributed it to Yue Fei because he was fighting the Manchus, descendants of the Jurchens who Yue had struggled against. Ji supposedly created it after watching a battle between an eagle and a bear during the Ming dynasty. Other sources say he created it while training in Shaolin. He was reading a book <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> to see two roosters fighting, which inspired him to imitate the fighting styles of animals. Both versions of the story (eagle / bear and roosters) state he continued to study the actions of animals and eventually increased the cadre of animal forms.|$|E

500|$|Incorporating Nixon {{into the}} plot was accidental; Moffat {{wanted to set}} the story during the moon landing <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> the United States {{president}} during the time. He was initially disappointed that {{it was such a}} [...] "rubbish one" [...] and briefly considered using a generic, unnamed president, such as the one seen in [...] "The Sound of Drums". However, he thought it [...] "didn't feel right for a story partly about real events" [...] and realized it could be fun to use Nixon. He believed there was something [...] "comically awkward" [...] about him, and it would be interesting for the Doctor to have to work with someone he did not like. The episode makes references to the Watergate scandal and David Frost.|$|E
500|$|North was {{released}} on October 21, 2003 through Geffen and Drive-Thru Records. Around Norths release, the band was featured on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, as well as appearing on MTV2 programs New Faces of Rock and Advanced Warning. From late October to early December 2004, the band went on a headlining tour across the US with support from Rx Bandits, Mae and Days Away. In January 2004, [...] "Ruthless" [...] {{was released}} as a radio single. On February 1, {{it was announced that}} guitarist William Tell had left the band to focus on his own music. Bobby Anderson of River City High took over Tell's position. The group had previously toured with River City High <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> to Anderson. Partington called him [...] "a great player, [...] a really good singer." [...] The band performed a handful of shows later in the month. In March and April, the band went on a co-headlining US tour with Yellowcard, with support from Steriogram and the Format.|$|E
2500|$|In 1969 MacInnis {{served as}} a medical {{consultant}} on the U.S. Navy's SEALAB III project, and was on site {{the day after the}} death of aquanaut Berry L. Cannon. MacInnis designed and built Sublimnos, the first Canadian underwater habitat, which was placed in Georgian Bay near Tobermory, Ontario in June 1969. Sublimnos had an [...] "open hatch" [...] policy, allowing access to any diver with a legitimate reason to use the habitat. In July 1969 MacInnis attended the Apollo 11 launch at Cape Kennedy, then traveled to Tobermory, where he dived to Sublimnos <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> through the water at the Moon at the very moment the astronauts were walking on it.|$|E

2500|$|Howard Brennan was a steamfitter who {{was sitting}} {{across the street from}} the Texas School Book Depository and {{watching}} the motorcade go by. He notified police that he heard a shot come from above <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> to see a man with a rifle fire another shot from the southeast corner window on the sixth floor. He said he had seen the same man minutes earlier looking through the window. Brennan gave a description of the shooter, and Dallas police subsequently broadcast descriptions between 12:45p.m., 12:48p.m., and 12:55p.m. After the second shot was fired, Brennan recalled, [...] "This man I saw previous was aiming for his last shot... and maybe paused for another second as though to assure himself that he had hit his mark." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, Wikileaks {{published}} diplomatic cables attributing controversial {{comments on}} Islam to Lee. Wikileaks quoted Lee as having described Islam as a [...] "venomous religion". Lee called the remarks [...] "false" [...] <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> to MFA's filenote of meeting {{and found no}} record of claim, he said [...] "I did talk about extremist terrorists like the Jemaah Islamiyah group, and the jihadist preachers who brainwashed them. They are implacable in wanting to put down all who {{do not agree with}} them. So their Islam is a perverted version, which the overwhelming majority of Muslims in Singapore do not subscribe to". He added that [...] "Singapore Muslim leaders were rational and that the ultimate solution to extremist terrorism was to give moderate Muslims the courage to stand up and speak out against radicals who hijacked Islam to recruit volunteers for their violent ends." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the deaths}} {{of his wife and}} daughters, Thomas Cromwell was devoted to his son, Gregory, and his sister Catherine's son, Richard Williams (alias Cromwell) and they were a close family. One of Richard's letters to his uncle bemoaned their {{separation}} from one another. He wrote that [...] "I never more desired anything, than since your departure, to see you, nor thought time longer in your absence." [...] Gregory was equally effusive in a letter where he asked only for his father's blessing, which he described as [...] "more treasure unto me then all the abundance of worldly goods." [...] Gregory remained close to his father <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> to his older cousin, Richard Cromwell, who had distinguished himself by his military skill and gallantry. Richard Cromwell adopted his uncle Thomas Cromwell's surname when he was made a Privy Councillor in 1531. Richard must have been fond of Gregory, leaving him [...] "a great horse" [...] in his will.|$|E

2500|$|One night, Ibrahim {{went up to}} the mountain, {{leaned against}} a rock, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> to the sky. He saw a shining star and said to himself, [...] "Could this be my Lord?" [...] But when it set he said: [...] "I don't like those that set." [...] The star had {{disappeared}} so it could not be God. God is always present. Then he saw the moon rising in splendor and said, [...] "Could this be my Lord?" [...] but the moon also set. At daybreak, he saw the sun rising and said, [...] "Could this be my Lord? This is the biggest and brightest!" [...] But when the sun also set he said, [...] "O my people! I am free from all that you join as partners with Allah! I have turned my face towards Allah who created the heavens and the earth and never shall I associate partners with Allah. Our Lord is the creator of the heavens and the earth and everything in between. He has the power to make the stars rise and set." [...] After this declaration, Ibrahim then heard Allah calling him, [...] "O Ibrahim!" [...] Ibrahim trembled and said, [...] "Here I am O my Lord!" [...] Allah replied, [...] "Submit to Me! Be a Muslim!" [...] Ibrahim fell to the ground, crying. He said: [...] "I submit to the Lord of the universe!" [...] Ibrahim kept prostrating himself until nightfall. He then got up and went back to his home, in peace and full of conviction that Allah has guided him to the truth.|$|E
2500|$|Like {{most people}} who came to Gettysburg, the Rathvon family was aware that the {{president}} of the United States, Abraham Lincoln, was going to make some remarks. [...] The family went to the town square where the procession was to form to go out to the cemetery that had not been completed yet. [...] At the head of the procession rode Abraham Lincoln on a gray horse preceded by a military band that was the first the young boy had ever seen. [...] Rathvon describes Lincoln as so tall and with such long legs that they went almost to the ground; he also mentions the long eloquent speech given by Edward Everett of Massachusetts whom Rathvon accurately described as the [...] "most finished orator of the day." [...] Rathvon then goes on to describe how Lincoln stepped forward and [...] "with a manner serious almost to sadness, gave his brief address." [...] During the delivery, along with some other boys, young Rathvon wiggled his way forward through the crowd until he stood within 15 feet of Mr. Lincoln <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> into what he described as Lincoln's [...] "serious face." [...] Rathvon recalls candidly that, although he listened [...] "intently to every word the president uttered and heard it clearly," [...] he explains, [...] "boylike, I could not recall any of it afterwards." [...] But he explains that if anyone said anything disparaging about [...] "honest Abe," [...] there would have been a [...] "junior battle of Gettysburg." [...] In the recording Rathvon speaks of Lincoln's speech allegorically [...] "echoing through the hills." ...|$|E
2500|$|The draft, however, {{attracted}} stiff {{opposition from}} Colonial Office officials {{and from the}} Church Missionary Society, who took issue both with the [...] "unlimited power" [...] the colony's founders would wield and what they regarded as the inevitable [...] "conquest and extermination of the present inhabitants". Parliamentary Under-Secretary for the colonies Lord Howick and Permanent Under-Secretary James Stephen both were concerned about proposals for the settlements' founders to make laws for the colony, fearing it would create a dynasty beyond British government control, while Anglican and Wesleyan missionaries were alarmed by claims made in pamphlets written by Wakefield in which he declared {{that one of the}} aims of colonisation was to [...] "civilise a barbarous people" [...] who could [...] "scarcely cultivate the earth". Maori, Wakefield wrote, [...] "craved" [...] colonisation <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> to the Englishman [...] "as being so eminently superior to himself, that the idea of asserting his own independence of equality never enters his mind". Wakefield suggested that once Maori chiefs had sold their land to settlers for a very small sum, they would be [...] "adopted" [...] by English families and be instructed and corrected. At a meeting on 6 June 1837 the Church Missionary Society passed four resolutions expressing its objection to the New Zealand Association plans, including the observation that previous experience had shown that European colonisation invariably inflicted grave injuries and injustices on the indigenous inhabitants. It also said the colonisation plans would interrupt or defeat missionary efforts for the religious improvement and civilisation of the [...] Maori. The society resolved to use [...] "all suitable means" [...] to defeat the association and both the Church and Wesleyan missionary societies began to wage campaigns in opposition to the company's plans, through pamphlets and lobbying to government.|$|E
