In addition, <b>a</b> <b>South</b> <b>Carolina</b> court order cannot be enforced in Oklahoma without the agreement of an Oklahoma court, and Brown stated that he would fight the order in Oklahoma, with the aid of the Cherokee Nation. Prior to the South Carolina adoption being finalized, the Cherokee Nation District Court granted temporary guardianship to Brown's wife and parents while Brown was in military training out of state. At the same time, a judge in South Carolina ordered Brown to immediately turn over the child to the Capobiancos, which representatives of the Cherokee Nation said was impossible while Brown was performing his military duties.|$|E

25|$|The game {{started with}} the Badgers kicking off to the Gamecocks. South Carolina would pickup three first downs but would punt after {{they go to the}} Wisconsin 36–yard line. The Badgers would then pickup two first downs on their first drive but stalled at the South Carolina 30–yard line. Wisconsin lined up in a punt {{formation}} and attempted a fake but Badgers punter Drew Meyer's pass was incomplete. The Gamecocks' next drive would result in a punt. On the Badgers next drive, QB Joel Stave was trying to throw away a pass into the ground as he was pressured but the pass deflected off a leg of his own lineman and into the hands of <b>a</b> <b>South</b> <b>Carolina</b> defender. On the very next play, South Carolina QB Connor Shaw threw a 39–yard touchdown pass to WR Bruce Ellington. The first quarter came to an end as the Badgers started their drive. Wisconsin would answer with a 1–yard touchdown pass to TE Sam Arneson from Joel Stave. South Carolina then drove 86 yards on 12 plays scoring on a reverse throwback to the quarterback. Wide receiver Bruce Ellington threw a 9–yard pass to quarterback Connoer Shaw. The extra point failed because of a low snap then caused the holder for South Carolina to try and run for the conversion but was tackled well short of the goal line. The Badgers answered again on their next drive with a 16 play, 75 yard drive that used up over six and a half minutes. The drive was capped by a 3–yard touchdown pass to WR Jeff Duckworth from Joel Stave. After the kickoff and <b>a</b> <b>South</b> <b>Carolina</b> kneel down, the Badgers led 14–13 at halftime.|$|E

South Carolina got the ball for their first second half drive. On their first play, Connor Shaw {{scrambled}} for 8 yards but fumbled after he was hit by Badgers LB Derek Landisch. The ball was recovered by fellow Badgers LB Ethan Armstrong. Wisconsin started at the South Carolina 31–yard line but failed to move the ball into the red zone and were forced to try a field goal. The kick from Jack Russell was wide right from 42 yards. South Carolina then drove 75 yards scoring on a 22–yard touchdown pass to Bruce Ellington from Connor Shaw. On the first play of the Badgers next drive, QB Joel Stave would scamble for 5 yards but was hit hard by <b>a</b> <b>South</b> <b>Carolina</b> defender. A few plays later after handing the ball off, Stave would be forced to leave the game with a shoulder injury. Taking over at quarterback for the Badgers was sixth year senior Curt Phillips. The third quarter would come to a close with the Badgers moving into Gamecock territory. On fourth and one from the South Carolina 26–yard line, Wisconsin decided to go for the first down instead to try a 40 plus yard field goal. The Gamecocks defense stuffed the Badgers and they turned the ball over on down. Six plays later, South Carolina extended their lead with a 3–yard touchdown pass to Jerell Adams from Connor Shaw. However, the Badgers would strike quickly on the ensuring kickoff. Badgers kick returner, Kenzel Doe, returned the kickoff 91 yards for a touchdown. The return was highlighted with a stiff arm that sprung Doe for the score. The Badgers were within three with just under 11 minutes left in the game. Once again, South Carolina would answer this time a 9 play 88 yard drive capped by a 1–yard touchdown run by Connor Shaw on a QB sneak. The Badgers then took over and got to the Gamecocks 47–yard line before Curt Phillips was intercepted. With less than five minutes left, the Gamecocks took over. Wisconsin LB Conor O'Neill then forced a fumble that was recovered by CB Darius Hillary. The Badgers then moved the ball to the Gamecocks 16–yard line but again backup QB Curt Phillips was intercepted. The Badgers defense would force the Gamecocks to punt and the Badgers took over with 2:10 left in the game still down by 10 points. Wisconsin got down to South Carolina's 17–yard line but the Badgers tried a trick play with a screen to WR Jared Abbrederis who then attempted to pitch the ball to RB Melvin Gordon but he mishandled the ball and fumbled turning the ball over to South Carolina. Two kneel downs later and the game was over with <b>a</b> <b>South</b> <b>Carolina</b> victory over Wisconsin, 34–24.|$|E
500|$|Since its {{publication}} in 1972 and revision in 1979, The Slave Community has influenced subsequent historiographical works on {{slavery in the}} United States. In a 1976 edition of Roll, Jordan, Roll, Eugene Genovese explains that Blassingame's book [...] "demonstrates that the published accounts of runaway slaves can be illuminating". The authors of Reckoning with Slavery (1976) use Blassingame's findings to challenge the assertions of Robert William Fogel and Stanley Engerman in [...] (1974). In Slave Religion: The [...] "Invisible Institution" [...] in the Antebellum South (1978), [...] Albert J. Raboteau comments, [...] "We should speak of the 'invisibility' of slave religion with irony: it is the neglect of slave sources by historians {{which has been the}} main cause of this invisibility." [...] Raboteau credits Blassingame and others for demonstrating the value of slave sources. Historian Charles Joyner's influential study Down by the Riverside: <b>A</b> <b>South</b> <b>Carolina</b> Slave Community (1984) is reinforced by the findings of The Slave Community and relies on similar evidence.|$|E
