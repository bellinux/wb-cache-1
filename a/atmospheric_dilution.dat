40|$|Recently {{concerns}} about possible increases in emissions of ultrafine and nanoparticles and their environmental impact have been voiced. A major problem with assessing {{the significance of}} such emissions is that, unlike the carbonaceous soot particles associated with older Diesel engines, many of these particles are not formed in the engine but instead by gas-to-particle conversion processes from vapor phase particle precursors as the exhaust dilutes and cools in the atmosphere. These processes are extremely non-linear and difficult to simulate in the laboratory. Recent measurements of such particles and problems associated with their measurement are described. The final measure of merit of a dilution and sampling system is whether it forms exhaust particle size distributions {{that are similar to}} those produced by <b>atmospheric</b> <b>dilution.</b> A sampling and dilution scheme capable of simulating <b>atmospheric</b> <b>dilution</b> has not yet been identified. In fact, it may not be possible {{to come up with a}} single robust approach that is appropriate to all situations. Current engine particulate emission standards are mass based. Recently, however, interest in other measures, i. e., size, number, or surface area, has increased. This is the result of increased awareness of the influence of particle size on the environmental impact of particulate matter (PM). Several factors have led to this awareness. The EPA has proposed tough new ambient standards on fine particle, particle...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} first {{systematic}} analysis for new particle formation (NPF), growth and shrinkage of new particles observed at four different sites in subtropical Central Taiwan. A total of 14 NPF events were identified during 137 days of ambient measurements during {{a cold and}} warm season. The derived nucleation rates of 1 nm particles (J 1 ) and growth rates were {{in the range of}} 39. 6 – 252. 9 cm&minus; 3 s&minus; 1 and 6. 5 – 14. 5 nm h&minus; 1 , respectively. The NPF events occurred on days either with low condensation sink (CS), increased morning traffic emissions and the breakup of nocturnal inversion layer (type A), or with high CS, minimum levels of primary traffic emissions and enhanced <b>atmospheric</b> <b>dilution</b> (type B). On non-event days, the particle number concentrations were mostly driven by traffic emissions. We have also observed shrinkage of new particles (type A-S and B-S), reversal of growth, during five out of the 14 NPF events. In intense shrinkage cases, the grown particles shrank back to the smallest measurable size of ~ 10 nm, thereby creating a unique "arch-like" shape in the size distribution contour plot. The particle shrinkage rates ranged from 5. 1 to 7. 6 nm h&minus; 1 . The ratios of shrinkage-to-growth rates were mostly in the range of 0. 40 – 0. 65, suggesting that a large fraction of the condensable species that contributed to growth were likely semi-volatile. The particle shrinkage was related to air masses with low CS due to <b>atmospheric</b> <b>dilution,</b> high ambient temperature and low relative humidity and such atmospheric conditions may have facilitated the evaporation of semi-volatile species from the particles to the gas phase. Our observations show that the new particle growth may be a~reversible process and the evaporating semi-volatile species are important for the growth of new particles to cloud condensation nuclei sizes...|$|E
40|$|Experiments {{conducted}} in spacecraft and drop towers show that thin-sheet materials have reduced flammability ranges and flame-spread rates under quiescent low-gravity environments (microgravity) {{as compared to}} normal gravity. Furthermore, low-gravity flames may be suppressed more easily by <b>atmospheric</b> <b>dilution</b> or decreasing atmospheric total pressure than their normal-gravity counterparts. The addition of a ventilating air flow to the low-gravity flame zone, however, can greatly enhance the flammability range and flame spread. These results, along with observations of flame and smoke characteristics useful for microgravity fire-detection 'signatures', promise to be of considerable value to spacecraft fire-safety designs. The paper summarizes the fire detection and suppression techniques proposed for the Space Station Freedom and discusses both the application of low-gravity combustion knowledge to improve fire protection and the critical needs for further research...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} occultations of celestial bodies through the atmospheric limb from low Earth orbit satellites and we {{show how the}} usual change of tangent altitude associated with atmospheric refraction is inseparably connected to {{a variation of the}} observed apparent intensity, for extended and pointlike sources. We demonstrate, in the regime of weak refraction angles, that <b>atmospheric</b> optical <b>dilution</b> and image deformation are strictly concomitant. The approach leads to the integration of a simple differential equation related to the observed transmittance in the absence of other absorbing molecules along the optical path. The algorithm does not rely on the absolute knowledge of the radiometer pointing angle that is related to the accurate knowledge of the satellite attitude. We successfully applied the proposed method to the measurements performed by two past occultation experiments: GOMOS for stellar and ORA for solar occultations.

The goal of this work was to analyze formation of NOx from fuel-N under well-controlled conditions. A Heat Flux method was used for stabilization of non-stretched flames on a perforated plate burner at <b>atmospheric</b> pressure. <b>Dilution</b> ratios of oxygen, O 2 /(O 2 +N 2), were varied from 0. 16 to 0. 209. The concentrations of O 2, CO, CO 2 and NOx were measured {{by means of a}} non-cooled quartz probe at different axial distances from the burner. Measured burning velocities for these flames and concentrations of the major species (O 2, CO, CO 2) agree well with those of the flames of methane + oxygen + nitrogen within an experimental accuracy. The concentrations of NOx in the post-flame zone have a maximum near the stoichiometry. These measurements were compared to model predictions and to similar experiments in flames of methane + oxygen + carbon dioxide doped with ammonia. In (CH 4 +NH 3) + O 2 + CO 2 mixtures the modeling over-predicts the measured concentrations of NOx however the experimental trends are well reproduced. In (CH 4 +NH 3) + O 2 + N 2 mixtures the plots of the concentrations of NOx in the post-flame zone {{as a function of the}} stoichiometric ratio differ qualitatively from that in (CH 4 +NH 3) + O 2 + CO 2 mixtures.

40|$|Odour from {{meat chicken}} (broiler) farms is an {{environmental}} issue affecting the sustainable {{development of the}} chicken meat industry but is {{a normal part of}} broiler production. Odour plumes exhausted from broiler sheds interact with the environment, where dispersion and dilution of the odours varies constantly, especially diurnally. The potential for odour impacts is greatest when odour emission rates are high and/or when <b>atmospheric</b> dispersion and <b>dilution</b> of odour plumes is limited (i. e. during stable conditions). We continuously monitored ventilation rate, on-site weather conditions, atmospheric stability, and estimated odour concentration with an artificial olfaction system. Detailed inspection of odour emission rates at critical times, i. e. dawn, dusk and night time, revealed that maximum daily and batch odour emission rates are not necessarily the cause of odour impacts. Periods of lower odour emission rates on each day are more likely to correspond with odour impacts. Odour emission rates need to be measured at the times when odour impacts are most likely to occur, which is likely to be at night. Additionally, high resolution ventilation rate data should be sought after to improve odour emission models, especially at critical times of the day. Consultants, regulators and researchers need to give more thought to odour emission rates from meat chicken farms to improved prediction and management of odour impacts...|$|R

The concentrations of PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs in plankton averaged 14 and 240 pg gdw- 1, respectively, but concentrations were highly variable. The global distribution of PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs was not driven by proximity to primary sources in continents, but significantly correlated with plankton biomass.

This oceanic sink is 3 and 8 times lower, for PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs respectively, than the atmospheric inputs due to gross diffusive absorption and dry deposition.

40|$|The {{nonlinear}} coupling {{of atmospheric}} trace constituents can - at least in principle - cause concentrations to oscillate with time. This is demonstrated for a simplified scheme encompassing only the tropospheric gas phase chemistry of CO, O_ 3, HO_x, and NO_x. Oscillating concentrations with a common period of about 33 d were found for all chemical compounds under the forcing by time independent sources for CO and NO. Linear stability analysis shows that already the linearized system has complex time constants. Thus even the linearized system can oscillate. Since the periodic solution is a stable attractor, this type of solution persists, even when perturbed by <b>atmospheric</b> mixing or <b>dilution.</b> The presence of methane or an external source of ozone destroys the oscillation. This finding limits the applicability for problems of the real atmosphere. The source strengths of NO and CO necessary to produce undamped oscillations in the model are {{much larger than the}} corresponding globally averaged source strengths. In the polluted boundary layer, however, the source strengths of NO and CO could very well be encountered. Evaluation of the Lyapunow exponents and of the dependence on the initial conditions indicate that the periodic solution is attained usually within a few days. Thus, even if the meteorological and source strength conditions do not persist for the time of a whole period parts of it may still be observable. (orig.)

40|$|A state-of-the-science {{thermodynamic}} model describing gas-particle absorption processes {{was used to}} predict the gas-particle partitioning of mixtures of approximately 60 carbonyl compounds emitted from low-emission gasoline-powered vehicles, three-way catalyst gasoline-powered vehicles, heavy-duty diesel vehicles under the idle-creep condition (HDDV idle), and heavy-duty diesel vehicles under the five-mode test (HDDV 5 -mode). Exhaust was diluted {{by a factor of}} 120 - 580 with a residence time of approximately 43 sec. The predicted equilibrium absorption partitioning coefficients differed from the measured partitioning coefficients by several orders of magnitude. Time scales to reach equilibrium in the dilution sampling system were close to the actual residence time during the HDDV 5 -mode test and much longer than the actual residence time during the other vehicle tests. It appears that insufficient residence time in the sampling system cannot uniformly explain the failure of the absorption mechanism to explain the measured partitioning. Other gas-particle partitioning mechanisms (e. g., heterogeneous reactions, capillary adsorption) beyond the simple absorption theory are needed to explain the discrepancy between calculated carbonyl partitioning coefficients and observed partitioning. Both of these alternative partitioning mechanisms imply great challenges for the measurement and modeling of semi-volatile primary organic aerosol (POA) species from motor vehicles. Furthermore, as emitted particle concentrations from newer vehicles approach <b>atmospheric</b> background levels, <b>dilution</b> sampling systems must fundamentally change their approach so that they use realistic particle concentrations in the dilution air to approximately represent real-world conditions.

PM 10 and PM 2. 5 daily samplings have been scheduled for one year (from January 2013) in four urban sites, Barcelona (Spain), Porto (Portugal), Athens (Greece), and Florence (Italy). The daily data set gives an overall representative picture of the PM composition in these urban sites. The project includes also samplings with hourly resolution for limited periods.

The PDADMAC facilitates both the reduction of the ITS and the stabilization of the reduced state of the ITS in an <b>atmospheric</b> oxygen environment. <b>Dilutions</b> of the dye solution show that the PEC is stable to dilutions of at least 1 to 1000. UV–vis studies indicate that the reduced ITS (ITSred) forms what is likely a J-aggregate in the presence of PDADMAC with an absorbance band red shifted from the normal absorbance band of reduced ITS by roughly 130 nm, 390 nm to 520 nm. Excitation of the PEC solution at either 390 nm or 520 nm produces an emission spectrum of the aggregated complex with an emission maximum near 534 nm. Monomer emission at 480 nm of ITSred represents only 3. 0 ± 0. 5 % of the emission signal of the aggregated complex. Kinetic studies using fluorescence spectroscopy over a temperature range of 30 to 70 °C and dilutions of dye solutions ranging from 1 : 10 to 1 : 1000 yield data for the oxidation of ITSred that is best fit by a first order rate constant. Kinetic data displays two distinctive regimes, a short time rate and a long time rate. These two distinct kinetic regimes are likely due to the reduced ITS interacting with an outer PEC environment and an inner PEC environment. First order rate constants could be used to estimate Δ‡H and Δ‡S of the oxidation reaction. Fluorescence data was used to calculate the partitioning of reduced ITS molecules between the outer and inner PEC environments.

After the release of CO 2 at the source, <b>atmospheric</b> transport causes <b>dilution</b> of strong local signals into the background and detectable gradients of Delta(CO 2) -C- 14 only remain in areas with high fossil fuel emissions. This fossil fuel signal can moreover be partially masked by the enriching effect that anthropogenic emissions of (CO 2) -C- 14 from the nuclear industry have on the atmospheric Delta(CO 2) -C- 14 signature. In this paper, we investigate the regional gradients in (CO 2) -C- 14 over the European continent and quantify the effect of the emissions from nuclear industry. We simulate the emissions and transport of fossil fuel CO 2 and nuclear (CO 2) -C- 14 for Western Europe using the Weather Research and Forecast model (WRF-Chem) for a period covering 6 summer months in 2008. We evaluate the expected CO 2 gradients and the resulting 1 (CO 2) -C- 14 in simulated integrated air samples over this period, as well as in simulated plant samples. We find that the average gradients of fossil fuel CO 2 in the lower 1200 m of the atmosphere are close to 15 ppm at a 12 km x 12 km horizontal resolution. The nuclear influence on Delta(CO 2) -C- 14 signatures varies considerably over the domain and for large areas in France and the UK it can range from 20 to more than 500 % of the influence of fossil fuel emissions. Our simulations suggest that the resulting gradients in Delta(CO 2) -C- 14 are well captured in plant samples, but due to their time-varying uptake of CO 2, their signature can be different with over 3 % from the atmospheric samples in some regions.

40|$|The {{sources of}} ambient organic {{particulate}} matter {{in urban areas}} are investigated through a program of emission source measurements, atmospheric measurements, and mathematical modeling of source/receptor relationships. A dilution sampler intended to collect fine organic aerosol from combustion sources {{is designed to simulate}} <b>atmospheric</b> cooling and <b>dilution</b> processes, so that organic vapors which condense under ambient conditions will be collected as particulate matter. This system is used to measure the emissions from a boiler burning distillate oil, a home fireplace, catalyst and noncatalyst automobiles, heavy-duty diesel trucks, natural gas home appliances, and meat cooking operations. Alternate techniques are used to sample the particulate matter emitted from cigarette smoking, a roofing tar pot, paved road dust, brake lining wear, tire wear, and vegetative detritus. The bulk chemical characteristics of the fine aerosol fraction are presented for each source. Over half of the fine aerosol mass emitted from automobiles, wood burning, meat cooking, home appliances, cigarettes, and tar pots is shown to consist of organic compounds. The organic material collected from these sources is analyzed using high-resolution gas chromatography. Using a simple analytical protocol, a quantitative, 50 -parameter characterization of the elutable fine organic aerosol emitted from each source type is obtained, which proves to be a unique fingerprint {{that can be used to}} distinguish most sources from each other. A mathematical model is used to predict the characteristics of fine ambient organic aerosol in the Los Angeles area that would prevail if the primary organic emissions are transported without chemical reaction. The model is found to track the seasonal variations observed in the ambient aerosol at the three sites studied. Emissions from vehicles and fireplaces are identified as significant sources of solvent-extractable organic aerosol. Differences between the model predictions and ambient concentrations that could be due to atmospheric chemical reaction are discussed.

40|$|One year of radon, benzene {{and carbon}} {{monoxide}} (CO) concentrations were analysed to characterise the combined influences of variations in traffic density and meteorological conditions on urban air quality in Bern, Switzerland. A recently developed radon-based stability categorisation technique was adapted {{to account for}} seasonal changes in day length and reduction in the local radon flux due to snow/ice cover and high soil moisture. Diurnal pollutant cycles were shown to result from an interplay between variations in surface emissions (traffic density), {{the depth of the}} nocturnal <b>atmospheric</b> mixing layer (<b>dilution)</b> and local horizontal advection of cleaner air from outside the central urban/industrial area of this small compact inland city. Substantial seasonal differences in the timing and duration of peak pollutant concentrations in the diurnal cycle were attributable to changes in day length and the switching to/from daylight-savings time in relation to traffic patterns. In summer, average peak benzene concentrations (0. 62 ppb) occurred in the morning and remained above 0. 5 ppb for 2 hours, whereas in winter average peak concentrations (0. 85 ppb) occurred in the evening and remained above 0. 5 ppb for 9 hours. Under stable conditions in winter, average peak benzene concentrations (1. 1 ppb) were 120 % higher than for well-mixed conditions (0. 5 ppb). By comparison, summertime peak benzene concentrations increased by 53 % from well-mixed (0. 45 ppb) to stable nocturnal conditions (0. 7 ppb). An idealised box model incorporating a simple advection term was used to derive a nocturnal mixing length scale based on radon, and then inverted to simulate diurnal benzene and CO emission variations at the city centre. This method effectively removes the influences of local horizontal advection and stability-related vertical dilution from the emissions signal, enabling a direct comparison with hourly traffic density. With the advection term calibrated appropriately, excellent results were obtained, with high regression coefficients in spring and summer for both benzene (r 2 ~ 0. 90 – 0. 96) and CO (r 2 ~ 0. 88 – 0. 98) in the two highest stability categories. Weaker regressions in winter likely indicate additional contributions from combustion sources unrelated to vehicular emissions.

This paper reviews the atmospheric processes (such as dilution, nucleation, condensation and coagulation) {{that dominate the}} dynamics of combustion aerosols following their emission, with a particular emphasis on PM from mobile sources. <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>dilution</b> affects the dynamic behavior of aerosols by shifting the gas-particle partitioning of the semi-volatile component of these aerosols. Our paper discusses the roles of dilution in changing the physico-chemical properties of the ambient aerosols, such as particle size distribution and number concentration, {{and the degree to}} which it affects non-labile and semi-volatile PM components. This information is complemented with a discussion of secondary aerosol formation from atmospheric photochemical reactions that involve precursors emitted from traffic sources. Special focus is devoted to the role of gas-phase vapors formed from the evaporation of the semi-volatile fraction of aerosols during dilution. Adding to the common recognition that volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are the major gaseous precursors, these vapors also actively participate in photochemical reactions and contribute to the formation of secondary aerosols. Following this discussion, we review recent findings that link PM semi-volatile components and their redox activity, and we discuss the influence and importance of PM volatility on particle toxicity.

40|$|A fast {{two-dimensional}} {{gas chromatography}} (GC-MS) method that uses heart-cutting and thermal extraction (TE) and requires no chemical derivatization {{was developed for}} the determination of anhydro-sugars in fine aerosols. Evaluation of the TE-GC-GC-MS method shows high average relative accuracy (&ge; 90 %), reproducibility (&le; 10 % relative standard deviation), detection limits of less than 3 ng/&mu;L, and negligible carryover for levoglucosan, mannosan, and galactosan markers. TE-GC-GC-MS- and solvent extraction (SE) -GC-MS-measured levoglucosan concentrations correlate across several diverse types of biomass burning aerosols. Because the SE-GC-MS measurements were taken 8 {{years prior to the}} TE-GC-GC-MS ones, the stability of levoglucosan is established for quartz filter-collected biomass burning aerosol samples stored at ultra-low temperature (&minus; 50 &deg;C). Levoglucosan concentrations (w/w) in aerosols collected following <b>atmospheric</b> <b>dilution</b> near open fires of varying intensity are similar to those in biomass burning aerosols produced in a laboratory enclosure. An average levoglucosan-mannosan-galactosan ratio of 15 : 2 : 1 is observed for these two aerosol sets. TE-GC-GC-MS analysis of atmospheric aerosols from the US and Africa produced levoglucosan concentrations (0. 01 – 1. 6 &mu;g/m 3 ) well within those reported for aerosols collected globally and examined using different analytical techniques (0. 004 – 7. 6 &mu;g/m 3 ). Further comparisons among techniques suggest that fast TE-GC-GC-MS is among the most sensitive, accurate, and precise methods for compound-specific quantification of anhydro-sugars. In addition, an approximately twofold increase in anhydro-sugar determination may be realized when combining TE with fast chromatography...|$|E

Upon their emissions from primary sources, ambient PM undergoes various atmospheric processes which may alter their physic-chemical and toxicological properties before {{the exposure to}} the public. This thesis first investigates the physic-chemical properties of ambient ultrafine aerosols characterized as from primary source {{in the immediate vicinity}} of a major freeway in Los Angeles. Then the thesis examines the atmospheric processes (dilution and photochemical oxidation) that dominate the dynamics of primary aerosols following their emission. <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>dilution</b> affects the dynamic behavior of aerosols by affecting the ambient concentration levels of non-labile PM species and also shifting the gas-particle partitioning of the semivolatile PM component.

40|$|Many {{studies have}} shown that on-road vehicle {{emissions}} are the dominant source of ultrafine particles (UFP; diameter < 100 nm) in urban areas and near-roadway environments. In order to advance our knowledge on the complex interactions and competition among <b>atmospheric</b> <b>dilution,</b> dispersion and dynamics of UFPs, an aerosol dynamics-CFD coupled model is developed and validated against field measurements. A unique approach of applying periodic boundary conditions is proposed to model pollutant dispersion and dynamics in one unified domain from the tailpipe level to the ambient near-road environment. This approach significantly reduces the size of the computational domain, and therefore, allows fast simulation of multiple scenarios. The model is validated against measured turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and pollution gradients near a major highway. Through a model sensitivity analysis, the relative importance of individual aerosol dynamical processes on the total particle number concentration (N) and particle number-size distribution (PSD) near a highway is investigated. The results demonstrate that (1) coagulation has a negligible effect on N and particle growth, (2) binary homogeneous nucleation (BHN) of H 2 SO 4 -H 2 O is likely responsible for elevated N closest to the road, (3) N and particle growth are very sensitive to the condensation of semi-volatile organics (SVOCs), particle dry deposition, and the interaction between these processes. The results also indicate that, without the proper treatment of atmospheric boundary layer (i. e. its wind profile and turbulence quantities), the nucleation rate would be underestimated by a factor of 5 in the vehicle wake region due to overestimated mixing. Therefore, introducing ABL conditions to activity-based emission models may potentially improve their performance in estimating UFP traffic emissions...|$|E

The objective {{of this paper is to}} compare the offsite radiological consequences of hypothetical accidents involving the various types of spent nuclear fuel handled in nonreactor nuclear facilities. The highest offsite total effective dose equivalents (TEDEs) are estimated at a receptor located about 5 km SSE of ANL facilities. Criticality safety considerations limit the amount of enriched uranium and plutonium that could be at risk in any given scenario. Heat generated by decay of fission products and actinides does not limit the masses of spent fuel within any given operation because the minimum time elapsed since fissions occurred in any form is at least five years. At cooling times of this magnitude, fewer than ten radionuclides account for 99 % of the projected TEDE at offsite receptors for any credible accident. Elimination of all but the most important nuclides allows rapid assessments of offsite doses with little loss of accuracy. Since the ARF (airborne release fraction), RF (respirable fraction), LPF (leak path fraction) and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>dilution</b> factor ({chi}/Q) can vary by orders of magnitude, it is not productive to consider nuclides that contribute less than a few percent of the total dose. Therefore, only {sup 134 }Cs, {sup 137 }Cs-{sup 137 m}Ba, and the actinides significantly influence the offsite radiological consequences of severe accidents. Even using highly conservative assumptions in estimating radiological consequences, they remain well below current Department of Energy guidelines for highly unlikely accidents...|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} first {{systematic}} analysis for new particle formation (NPF), growth and shrinkage of new particles at four different sites in subtropical central Taiwan. A total of 14 NPF events were identified from 137 days of ambient measurements during {{a cold and}} warm season. The measured formation rates of 10 nm particles (J 10 ) and growth rates were {{in the range of}} 4. 4 – 30 cm− 3 s− 1 and 7. 4 – 24 nm h− 1 , respectively. The onset of NPF events coincided with decreases of condensation sink (CS) and increases of SO 2 under enhanced atmospheric mixing and dilution. However, the lower or comparable SO 2 on event days than on non-event days suggests that SO 2 was not a limiting factor for NPF. On non-event days, the particle number concentrations were mostly driven by traffic emissions. We also observed shrinkage of new particles, the reversal of growth, during five out of the identified secondary formation. UFP particles events. In intense cases, the grown particles shrank back to the smallest measurable size of ~ 10 nm, thereby creating a unique "arch-like" shape in the size distribution contour plot. The particle shrinkage rates ranged from − 5. 1 to − 7. 6 nm h− 1 . The corresponding particle volume losses suggest that a notable fraction of the condensable species that contributed to growth was semi-volatile. The particle shrinkage was related to enhanced <b>atmospheric</b> <b>dilution,</b> high ambient temperature and low relative humidity, thus favoring the evaporation of semi-volatile species from the particulate phase to the gas phase. Our observations show that the new particle growth could be a reversible process, in which the evaporating semi-volatile species are important for the growth of new particles to sizes of environmental health concerns...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Radiocarbon {{has been}} used to define {{parameters}} for modeling past, recent, and future CO 2 /carbon amounts in the atmosphere and in other environmental compartments. In the present paper, we estimate the amount of 14 C in the atmo-sphere by calculating the molar activity of 14 CO 2 (quantity of 14 CO 2 molecules per mol of air). Data on the reconstruction of the past concentration of atmospheric CO 2 from Antarctic ice cores and Δ 14 C activities from the IntCal 09 calibration curve were applied. The results obtained indicate that cosmogenic production had a dominant influence on the 14 C amount in the atmosphere between 50 and 20 ka BP, when the CO 2 concentrations were relatively stable, with a slowly decreasing trend. The decreasing 14 C activity (Δ 14 C) between 20 and 2 ka BP seems to be caused predominantly by a dilution of atmospheric 14 CO 2 by input of CO 2 with a depleted amount of 14 C (probably from deeper oceanic layers), which is evident from a com-parison with the Δ 14 C and molar activity time series. A strong linear relation was found between the 14 C activity and CO 2 con-centration in the air for the period 20 – 2 ka BP, which confirms a dominant influence of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>dilution</b> of 14 CO 2. The observed linear relation between the CO 2 and Δ 14 C levels persists even in the prevailing part of the Holocene. Likewise, the quantity of 14 CO 2 in the atmosphere (calculated as molar activity) during the prevailing part of the deglacial period (20 – 11 ka BP) was surprisingly increasing, although a decreasing trend in the 14 C cosmogenic production rate could be expected...|$|E

The first simulation of radioactive noble gas (Kr- 85 exponent) emitted during JCO accident occurred from 30 September to 3 October 1999 at Tokai, Japan showed that the first arriving short pulse was found in Tsukuba located at 60 km away from the accidental area. However, the released radioactive noble gas was transported back to the origin site about 2 days later due to the mesoscale meteorological wind circulation, enhancing the levels of Kr- 85 with the secondary peak in Tsukuba. The second simulation of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>dilution</b> factors (the ratio of concentration to the emission rate, chi/Q), during the underground nuclear test (UNT) performed by North Korea showed that high chi/Q moved to the eastward and extended toward southward {{in accordance with the}} mesoscale atmospheric circulations generated by mesoscale prognostic model MM 5. In comparison with the measurements, the simulated horizontal distribution patterns of Kr- 85 during the JCO are well accord with that of observation in Tsukuba such as the existence of secondary peak which is associated with the mesoscale circulations. However, the simulated level of Kr- 85 anomaly was found to be significantly lower than the observations, and some interpretations on these discrepancies were described. Applications of LPDM to two mesoscale emergency response dispersion cases suggest the potential capability of LPDM {{to be used as a}} decision support model provided accurate emission rate of accident in case of a large accident. close 1...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{for the first}} time a classification of shrinkage events based on the aerosol processes that precede them. To this end, 3. 5 years of continuous measurements (from 2009 to 2012) of aerosol size distributions, obtained with a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS) at an urban background site in Southern Europe, have been interpreted. 48 shrinkage events were identified and analysed, all occurring during spring and summer when the atmospheric conditions are more favourable for their development. In this study the shrinkage events took place mostly towards the end of the day, and their occurrence could be associated to <b>atmospheric</b> <b>dilution</b> conditions and a reduction in photochemical activity. The shrinkage rate (SR) varied between − 1. 0 and − 11. 1 nm h − 1 (average value of − 4. 7 ± 2. 6 nm h − 1). Changes in particle concentrations corresponding to the nucleation and Aitken modes were detected, whereby an increase in the number of particles in the nucleation mode often coincided with a reduction in the Aitken mode. The accumulation mode did not undergo significant changes during these processes. In addition, in some cases, a dilution of the total particle number concentration in the ambient air was observed. Following the proposed methodology, three groups of events have been identified: Group I (NPF + shrinkage), Group II (aerosol growth process + shrinkage) and Group III (pure shrinkage events). The largest number of shrinkage events has been observed in the absence of prior processes, i. e. pure shrinkage events, followed by Group I events and finally Group II events. Although this analysis has confirmed that the triggering of shrinkage events is clearly linked to the atmospheric situation and the characteristics of the measurement area, this classification may contribute to a better understanding of the processes involved and the features that characterize shrinkage events...|$|E
40|$|UnrestrictedRecent {{focus of}} studies on health effects of ambient {{particulate}} matter (PM) have suggested particle chemical composition in addition to particle size, shape and number concentration responsible for the observed health outcomes. However, chemical composition and size distribution of the atmospheric particles can be strongly affected by the differences in ambient temperature, relative humidity, photochemical activity and source contributions. This thesis is intended to demonstrate the importance of characterizing predominant PM sources from an exposure perspective and develop methods of assessing their impact on air quality in Southern California. A study of particle number concentration and size distribution showed seasonal and spatial variability in Southern California. While contribution of local vehicular emissions was most evident in winter, effects of long-range transport of particles and photochemical particle formation were enhanced during warmer periods. Ship emissions {{are found to be}} dominant source of lower accumulation and ultrafine particles near ports. During the wildfires in October 2003 in Southern California, PM 10 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter 10 mm and less) levels were found highly elevated, while ozone concentrations dropped during the fire episode and these fire-borne particles were found to effectively penetrate indoors. To characterize the emission profiles from on-road diesel and gasoline vehicle-fleets, size-segregated PM samples were collected inside the Caldecott tunnel in Orinda, CA and analyzed for vehicular organic tracers such as hopanes and steranes, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). In a separate study, detailed information on the chemical characteristics of organic PM originating from a pure gasoline and a diesel dominated mixed-traffic freeway is obtained.; While hopanes and steranes, and high molecular weight PAHs levels are found comparable near these freeways, elemental carbon and lighter molecular weight PAHs are found much elevated near diesel dominated mixed-fleet freeway. Remarkably good agreement is observed between the roadside measurements and the emission factors calculated from the tunnel measurements especially for hopanes and steranes. Our results indicate that the fleet composition as well as <b>atmospheric</b> <b>dilution</b> has strong impact on the ambient concentrations of these organic tracers...|$|E
