50|$|The <b>marsh</b> <b>wren</b> (Cistothorus palustris) {{is a small}} North American {{songbird}} of the wren family. It {{is sometimes}} called long-billed <b>marsh</b> <b>wren</b> to distinguish it from the sedge wren, also known as short-billed <b>marsh</b> <b>wren.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Marsh</b> <b>Wren</b> (Cistothorus palustris) {{populations in}} the eastern United States have been declining. One of the main causes for these declining trends is the {{destruction}} of wetlands for development and agriculture. Restored and re-created wetlands help reestablish <b>Marsh</b> <b>Wren</b> populations. To examine habitat components selected by <b>Marsh</b> <b>Wrens,</b> vegetation and water parameters were measured at two locations at Great Meadows National Wildlife Refuge (GMNWR), Sudbury, MA during summer 2001. <b>Marsh</b> <b>Wren</b> territories were determined using behavioral observations and playback of tape recordings. Vegetation plots were used to compare several parameters between territories and random sites. These two study locations varied greatly; thus, they were treated separately for data analyses. At Wash Brook, territorial sites had significantly greater cattail (Typha spp.) density and height than random sites. At Concord, purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) was less dense at territories than random sites; Wash Brook did not contain purple loosestrife. Water depth was significantly lower at Wash Brook territories, and significantly higher at Concord territories suggesting {{that it was not}} a factor determining <b>Marsh</b> <b>Wren</b> territories. My data also suggests that tall, dense, vegetation structure is selected by <b>Marsh</b> <b>Wrens</b> with cattail as the selected species. Furthermore, <b>Marsh</b> <b>Wrens</b> avoided habitats with purple loosestrife, an invasive species. However, further studies are needed to determine if habitat parameters other than the ones I measured are important components of <b>Marsh</b> <b>Wren</b> territories.

40|$|The song of <b>marsh</b> <b>wrens</b> (Cistothorus palustris) is {{a learned}} trait passed on from {{generation}} to generation. Male <b>marsh</b> <b>wrens</b> from California and New York learn about 150 and 50 different songs apiece, respectively.

40|$|The {{consequences}} of a grand evolutionary experiment are evident throughout Nebraska. During the Pleistocene, many taxa were apparently separated into eastern and western populations. Today many of these eastern and western counterparts meet in the Great Plains, especially in Nebraska. Some pairs now hybridize freely (towhees. orioles. flickers), while others do not (buntings, grosbeaks, meadowlarks) (see Rising 1983). The <b>Marsh</b> <b>Wren</b> is still another, previously unrecognized, taxon that consists of an eastern and western counterpart. Data from Nebraska and elsewhere in North America {{suggest that there are}} two forms of the <b>Marsh</b> <b>Wren,</b> perhaps as vocally different from each other as are the two Sternella meadowlarks. These two forms meet in Nebraska, and are perhaps sufficiently different and distinct that they should be called two separate species...|$|R

40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. August 2013. Major: Integrated Biosciences. Advisor: Gerald J. Niemi. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); v, 188 pages, appendices 1 - 7. I analyzed habitat and landscape characteristics {{important to the}} Sedge Wren (Cistothorus platensis) and <b>Marsh</b> <b>Wren</b> (C. palustris) in Great Lakes coastal wetlands using breeding bird census data from two large projects in 2002 - 2003 and 2011 - 2012. Little {{is known about the}} population or distribution of these species in the Great Lakes region. For each of 840 survey points in coastal wetlands along the U. S. and Canadian shorelines, I used National Land Cover Data and Ontario Land Cover Data to calculate the percent cover of seven different land use classes within 500, 1000, and 2000 m buffers of each point. I combined these with climatic and landscape configuration variables as well as field-collected vegetation data to develop classification trees that predicted both Sedge and <b>Marsh</b> <b>Wren</b> presence and relative high abundance (≥ 3 wrens/site). After eliminating geographic variables, the best classification trees predicted Sedge Wrens to be present in wetlands with greater than 9 % woody wetlands at the 2000 m buffer, and in high abundance in sites with less than 3 % cattails and greater than 4 % meadow vegetation. <b>Marsh</b> <b>Wren</b> presence was positively associated with emergent vegetation and cropland, and negatively associated with woody wetland at the 500 m buffer. <b>Marsh</b> <b>Wrens</b> were predicted to be in high abundance at sites with greater than 14 % cattails. This classification tree analysis is a powerful predictive tool which significantly increases our ability to correctly predict the presence of these secretive wetland species. These results provide a basic understanding of characteristics of Great Lakes coastal wetlands important to two wetland-obligate bird species and can be useful in conservation decisions and management plans...|$|R

50|$|The sedge wren (Cistothorus platensis) {{is a small}} {{songbird}} of the wren family. It {{was formerly}} known as the short-billed <b>marsh</b> <b>wren,</b> and in South America is often known as the grass wren. There are about 20 different subspecies which are found across most of the Americas. Some of these forms may be separate species that could be split in the future.|$|R
50|$|Goose Creek State Park {{is home to}} a {{wide variety}} of plant and animal species that thrive in the various {{habitats}} in place at the park. Sedges, sawgrass and black needle rush can be found in the brackish marshes near the Pamlico River. These tall grasses provide cover and nesting sites for the many wading birds of the park, including, <b>marsh</b> <b>wren,</b> rails, herons and egrets.|$|R
50|$|Landbirds were {{apparently}} less seriously affected; {{apart from the}} passenger pigeon, the ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus), wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) and <b>marsh</b> <b>wren</b> (Cistothorus palustris) had essentially or completely disappeared by 1900. However, {{it is not known}} how many of the numerous species of New World warblers, most of which today only occur only as transient migrants, formerly bred in Seneca County.|$|R
50|$|The river also {{provides}} a habitat for a broad assortment of nesting and migratory birds. Species of note include the common tern, black skimmer, laughing gull, piping plover, least tern, great black-backed gull, osprey, great egret, black-crowned night heron, clapper rail, Virginia rail, merlin, and <b>marsh</b> <b>wren,</b> among others. Canada geese, American black ducks, mallards, tundra swans, northern pintails, and other migratory birds are often observed in the river estuary.|$|R
50|$|This rush {{provides}} {{cover for}} a number of salt marsh animal species. Birds such as the long-billed <b>marsh</b> <b>wren,</b> clapper rail, and seaside sparrow nest in it. Rice rats nest in it and prey on the eggs of the local birds. A number of fungal species grow on this rush, some exclusively. The new ascomycete species Aquamarina speciosa, Keissleriella rara, Massarina carolinensis, and Paraphaeosphaeria pilleata were described from dead or dying stems of this rush.|$|R
50|$|Wildlife include deer, coyote, jackrabbit, chipmunk, gray squirrel, raccoon, skunk, bobcat, and fox.Birds use the vernal pool as a {{rest stop}} on {{migration}} flights {{as well as}} year-round habitat. During a five-year period from 1982 to 1987, 139 species of birds were observed at Boggs Lake, including both bald and golden eagles.Other bird species seen are the pygmy nuthatch, pileated woodpecker, hermit warbler, purple martin, red-winged blackbird, ruddy duck, <b>marsh</b> <b>wren,</b> mallard, and California quail.|$|R
50|$|Through the {{lobbying}} {{of public interest}} groups, actions were initiated to restore Maplewood Flats back to its natural state. Landscape architect Patrick Mooney, designed all the major enhancement projects for Maplewood Flats, including the freshwater marsh. The projects were installed from 1995 to 2004. In 1997, the system was dedicated {{and is now a}} breeding ground for <b>marsh</b> <b>wrens,</b> common yellowthroats, wood ducks, American coots, blue-winged teal, red-winged blackbirds, pied-billed grebes, soras and virginia rails.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} bird species {{occur at the}} Bucknell Preserve along Chillisquaque Creek. These include <b>marsh</b> <b>wrens</b> and soras. Virginia rails were {{observed}} at the site in 1980 and 1984, though {{it is likely that}} they still remain there. Additionally, several mussel species that require high levels of water quality to survive have been observed in the creek. In the Montour County reach of the watershed of Chillisquaque Creek, livestock is commonly allowed access to streams.|$|R
50|$|Visitors to the Willapa National Wildlife Refuge {{can enjoy}} viewing {{a wide variety}} of wildlife. Roosevelt elk, black bear, shorebirds, and {{spawning}} salmon {{are just a few of}} the many species that reside on the Refuge. The refuge is home to several endangered and threatened species including the snowy plover, marbled murrelets, and brown pelican. Other birds that are commonly spotted throughout the refuge include bald eagles, great blue herons, peregrine falcons, red-tailed hawks, <b>marsh</b> <b>wrens,</b> and golden-crowned kinglets.|$|R
50|$|The salt {{marshes and}} mudflats along the lower Rahway are high {{priority}} habitats {{and are the}} most extensive in the watershed and span four communities: Carteret, Linden, Woodbridge Township and Rahway. Encompassing over 1000 acre, this priority habitat contains 434 acres of salt marsh and 238 acres of brush and shrub lands. Over 1,500 gulls, many species of shorebirds, breeding clapper rail, egrets, ducks, plovers, hawks, pheasants, wintering northern harrier and <b>marsh</b> <b>wrens</b> utilize the site.|$|R
25|$|Birds which {{prefer the}} wetland habitat include kingfishers and bank swallows. Finally {{there is an}} {{abundance}} of bird life around the wetland marshes. Many species of ducks make their summer homes in these waters and Canada geese nest in the more remote <b>marshes.</b> Blackbirds, <b>marsh</b> <b>wrens</b> and black terns nest in the reeds. Franklin gulls nest in the marsh vegetation, but range over agricultural fields for grasshoppers, crickets, and mice. Shore birds include: avocet, piping plover, spotted sandpiper, willet, common snipe and killdeer.|$|R
50|$|A small {{population}} of red fox, muskrat, mink, otter, voles, northern diamondback terrapin, and various nonpoisonous water snakes also {{live in the}} marsh areas. Clapper rails, seaside sparrows, and <b>marsh</b> <b>wrens</b> also depend on the protected refuge habitat. Peregrine falcons have been nesting on the refuge every year since the first peregrine nesting tower was installed in 1984. The marsh and estuary are important {{in the production of}} marine species such as crabs and oysters that help form the food chain.|$|R
