40|$|Two {{techniques}} for <b>assembling</b> an aluminium drill pipe to a steel tool joint were investigated: 'hot' <b>assembling</b> and 'cold' <b>assembling.</b> During hot <b>assembling</b> {{a difference of}} temperature between the two parts is exploited to impose contact interferences and then to obtain a friction bond that generates torsional strength. Hot <b>assembling</b> is ordinarily used. The cold <b>assembling</b> technique is introduced here as an alternative. During cold <b>assembling</b> connection make up, the contact interferences are obtained by imposing an external torque. This technique requires a proper lubricating compound between the mating surfaces, {{in order to reduce}} the torque required to make up the connection. After lubricating compound curing, the coefficient of static friction rises and a high torsional strength of the connection is obtained. Full scale experimental tests were performed both on hot <b>assembled</b> connections and on cold <b>assembled</b> connections. Cold <b>assembling</b> showed higher torsional strength than hot assembling; moreover cold <b>assembling</b> does not expose the aluminium alloy to high temperature, that can be a risk for the aluminium alloy microstructure. However, the use of the compound can be a reason of cold <b>assembling</b> torsional strength scatter...|$|R

5|$|The nuclear {{envelope}} {{acts as a}} barrier that prevents both DNA and RNA viruses from entering the nucleus. Some viruses require access to proteins inside the nucleus in order to replicate and/or <b>assemble.</b> DNA viruses, such as herpesvirus replicate and <b>assemble</b> in the cell nucleus, and exit by budding through the inner nuclear membrane. This process is accompanied by disassembly of the lamina on the nuclear face of the inner membrane.|$|E

5|$|The British {{engineering}} firm Atelier One and freelance engineer Chris Hornzee-Jones (who later {{went on to}} form the {{engineering firm}} Aerotrope in 2005) provided the sculpture's structural design, and Performance Structures, Inc. (PSI) was chosen to fabricate it because {{of their ability to}} produce nearly invisible welds. The project began with PSI attempting to recreate the design in miniature. A high-density polyurethane foam model was selected by Kapoor, which was then used to design the final structure, including the interior structural components. Initially, PSI planned to build and <b>assemble</b> the sculpture in Oakland, California, and ship it to Chicago through the Panama Canal and St. Lawrence Seaway.
