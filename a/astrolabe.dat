5|$|Arabic astronomical {{contributions}} include Albatenius' {{discovery that}} {{the direction of}} the Sun's apogee (the place in the Sun's orbit against the fixed stars where it seems to be moving slowest) is changing. (In modern heliocentric terms, this is caused by a gradual motion of the aphelion of the Earth's orbit). Ibn Yunus observed more than 10,000 entries for the Sun's position for many years using a large <b>astrolabe.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the 12th and 13th centuries, Europe {{produced}} {{economic growth}} and innovations in methods of production. Major technological advances included {{the invention of the}} windmill, the first mechanical clocks, the manufacture of distilled spirits, {{and the use of the}} <b>astrolabe.</b> Concave spectacles were invented around 1286 by an unknown Italian artisan, probably working in or near Pisa.|$|E
5|$|Some locally-made items {{included}} prismatic obsidian blades and a polished nodule of iron pyrite {{for use as}} a mirror. Other {{items included}} weapons and instruments for navigation. A mariner's <b>astrolabe</b> is the oldest such instrument with a confirmed date. Pewter objects from England were found and stoneware from Cologne, Germany. In the end about 1,500 artifacts were retrieved from the San Esteban, 85% of them from the conglomerates.|$|E

5|$|The fourteenth-century English poets John Gower and Geoffrey Chaucer both {{referred}} to astrology in their works, including Gower's Confessio Amantis and Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales. Chaucer commented explicitly on astrology in his Treatise on the <b>Astrolabe,</b> demonstrating personal knowledge of one area, judicial astrology, with {{an account of}} {{how to find the}} ascendant or rising sign.|$|E
5|$|Al-Zarqali (1028–1087) {{developed}} {{a more accurate}} <b>astrolabe,</b> used for centuries afterwards. He constructed a water clock in Toledo. He discovered that the Sun's apogee moves slowly relative to the fixed stars, and obtained a good estimate of its motion for its rate of change. Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (1201–1274) wrote an important revision to Ptolemy's celestial model. When he became Helagu's astrologer, he was given an observatory and gained access to Chinese techniques and observations. He developed trigonometry as a separate field, and compiled the most accurate astronomical tables available up to that time.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary Muslim astronomers also {{constructed}} {{a variety of}} highly accurate astronomical clocks for use in their mosques and observatories, such as the water-powered astronomical clock by Al-Jazari in 1206, and the astrolabic clock by Ibn al-Shatir in the early 14th century. The most sophisticated timekeeping astrolabes were the geared <b>astrolabe</b> mechanisms designed by Abū Rayhān Bīrūnī in the 11th century and by Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr in the 13th century. These devices functioned as timekeeping devices and also as calendars.|$|E

5000|$|Mariner's <b>astrolabes</b> {{were made}} of brass. Since weight was {{advantageous}} when using the instrument on the heaving deck of a ship or in high winds, other materials, such as wood or ivory, were not desirable though some wood sea <b>astrolabes</b> were made. Early sea <b>astrolabes</b> were made from sheets of brass. Due to their light weight, they tended to perform poorly at sea. Heavier cast brass frames began {{to be made in}} the mid-sixteenth century and were considerably better. [...] As the accuracy of the instrument is related to the radius of the divided circle, these were made as large as practical.|$|R
5|$|Johngarthia lagostoma {{lives in}} burrows among vegetation, at altitudes {{of up to}} , {{emerging}} at night to feed on plant matter and occasionally on animals. From January to March there is an annual migration to the sea to release the planktonic larvae. The species was first described (as Gecarcinus lagostoma) by Henri Milne-Edwards in 1837 from material sent {{to him by the}} naturalists Jean René Constant Quoy and Joseph Paul Gaimard, collected by the French ship <b>Astrolabe.</b>|$|E
5|$|One of the wrecks was rediscovered in 1964. A private company, Platoro, Ltd., {{began to}} {{excavate}} the Espíritu Santo wreck in late 1967, which caused public outrage and {{the passage of}} new laws to protect wrecks on the Texan coast. The remains of San Esteban were found in 1970 and excavated in 1972–73. Many artifacts have been recovered and are held in the Corpus Christi Museum of Science and History. They include the world's oldest mariner's <b>astrolabe</b> with a confirmed date.|$|E
5|$|The dial of the Zytglogge's {{astronomical clock}} is {{built in the}} form of an <b>astrolabe.</b> It is backed by a stereographically {{projected}} planisphere divided into three zones: the black night sky, the deep blue zone of dawn and the light blue day sky. The skies are crisscrossed with the golden lines of the horizon, dawn, the tropics and the temporal hours, which divide the time of daylight into twelve hours whose length varies with the time of year.|$|E

5|$|The {{place where}} the clock was situated, and its managers, were collectively known as khaneh fenjaan. Usually {{this would be the}} top floor of a public-house, with west- and east-facing windows to show the time of sunset and sunrise. There was also another {{time-keeping}} tool named a staryab or <b>astrolabe,</b> but it was mostly used for superstitious beliefs and was not practical for use as a farmers' calendar. The Zeebad Gonabad water clock was in use until 1965 when it was substituted by modern clocks.|$|E
5|$|They {{returned}} to Botany Bay {{on the evening}} of 23 January, when Phillip gave orders to move the fleet to Sydney Cove the next morning, 24 January. That day, there was a huge gale blowing, making it impossible to leave Botany Bay, so they decided to wait till the next day, 25 January. However, during 24 January, they spotted the ships <b>Astrolabe</b> and Boussole, flying the French flag, at the entrance to Botany Bay; they were having as much trouble getting into the bay as the First Fleet was having getting out.|$|E
5|$|Following the Babylonians, {{significant}} {{advances in}} astronomy {{were made in}} ancient Greece and the Hellenistic world. Greek astronomy is characterized from the start by seeking a rational, physical explanation for celestial phenomena. In the 3rd century BC, Aristarchus of Samos estimated the size and distance of the Moon and Sun, {{and was the first}} to propose a heliocentric model of the solar system. In the 2nd century BC, Hipparchus discovered precession, calculated the size and distance of the Moon and invented the earliest known astronomical devices such as the <b>astrolabe.</b> Hipparchus also created a comprehensive catalog of 1020 stars, and most of the constellations of the northern hemisphere derive from Greek astronomy. The Antikythera mechanism (c. 150–80 BC) was an early analog computer designed to calculate the location of the Sun, Moon, and planets for a given date. Technological artifacts of similar complexity did not reappear until the 14th century, when mechanical astronomical clocks appeared in Europe.|$|E

5|$|In February 1957, Melbourne {{was sent}} to the Royal Hobart Regatta. Following this, she {{travelled}} to New Zealand, where she participated in exercises with HMNZS Royalist and visited several New Zealand ports. The first of several annual three-month deployments to Southeast Asia as part of the Far East Strategic Reserve began in April, with Melbourne returning to Darwin at the end of June. The carrier {{spent the rest of the}} year visiting Australian ports for open inspections by the public. During the visit to Port Adelaide, on 28 October 1957, Melbourne was slightly damaged when she was struck by MV Straat Lanka—the first of several minor collisions the carrier would experience throughout her career. Operations for the year concluded with participation in Exercise <b>Astrolabe</b> off Lord Howe Island, with ships from the RAN, Royal Navy, and Royal New Zealand Navy, before returning to Sydney on 13 December.|$|E
25|$|The planisphere was a {{star chart}} invented by Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī in the early 11th century. The <b>astrolabe</b> was invented in the Hellenistic world in either the 1st or 2nd centuries BC and is often {{attributed}} to Hipparchus. A combination of the planisphere and dioptra, the <b>astrolabe</b> was effectively an analog computer capable of working out several {{different kinds of problems}} in spherical astronomy. An <b>astrolabe</b> incorporating a mechanical calendar computer and gear-wheels was invented by Abi Bakr of Isfahan, Persia in 1235. Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī invented the first mechanical geared lunisolar calendar <b>astrolabe,</b> an early fixed-wired knowledge processing machine with a gear train and gear-wheels, circa 1000 AD. The castle clock, a hydropowered mechanical astronomical clock invented by Al-Jazari in 1206, was the first programmable analog computer.|$|E
25|$|Building on this astronomical background, in the 10th century European {{scholars}} such as Gerbert of Aurillac {{began to}} travel to Spain and Sicily to seek out learning which they had heard existed in the Arabic-speaking world. There they first encountered various practical astronomical techniques concerning the calendar and timekeeping, most notably those dealing with the <b>astrolabe.</b> Soon {{scholars such as}} Hermann of Reichenau were writing texts in Latin on the uses and construction of the <b>astrolabe</b> and others, such as Walcher of Malvern, were using the <b>astrolabe</b> to observe the time of eclipses {{in order to test}} the validity of computistical tables.|$|E
