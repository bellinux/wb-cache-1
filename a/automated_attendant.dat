50|$|On {{a purely}} {{technical}} level {{it could be}} argued that an <b>automated</b> <b>attendant</b> is a very simple kind of IVR, however in the telecom industry the terms IVR and Auto Attendant are generally considered distinct. An <b>Automated</b> <b>Attendant</b> serves a very specific purpose (replace live operator and route calls), whereas an IVR can perform all sorts of functions (telephone banking, account inquiries, etc.).|$|E
50|$|IVR {{systems can}} be used for mobile purchases, banking {{payments}} and services, retail orders, utilities, travel information and weather conditions. A common misconception refers to an <b>automated</b> <b>attendant</b> as an IVR. The terms are distinct and mean different things to traditional telecommunications professionals—the purpose of an IVR is to take input, process it, and return a result, whereas the job of an <b>automated</b> <b>attendant</b> is to route calls. The term voice response unit (VRU) is sometimes used as well.|$|E

5000|$|Opcom, {{a company}} founded by David Ladd, {{developed}} a voicemail system primarily marketed to smaller enterprises. Opcom pioneered and patented the feature of <b>automated</b> <b>attendant</b> (U.S. Patent numbers 4,747,124 and 4,783,796 both issued in 1988), {{an integral part}} of any voicemail systems. The <b>automated</b> <b>attendant</b> enables callers to direct calls by pressing single digit keys, e.g. [...] "If you are making domestic reservations, press 1; for international reservations, press ‘2'; etc." [...] Opcom later pioneered the concept of Unified Messaging (to be discussed later in this article). Opcom eventually acquired VMX through a reverse merger, (Opcom was private and VMX was public) and the surviving company VMX was eventually acquired by Octel.|$|E
50|$|Night {{service would}} {{redirect}} after-hours calls to a desk where personnel remained on duty overnight, {{such as a}} night watchman's duty station or a commercial answering service.

5000|$|While {{many users}} may think an <b>automated</b> <b>attendant</b> {{is part of}} voice mail, voice {{messaging}} technology was around since the late 1970s {{but in the early}} 1980s companies provided voice prompting systems that allowed callers to reach the intended party, not necessarily to leave a message for the intended party.|$|E
50|$|Such {{services}} have been merged into 6-1-1. Mobile phones sometimes use 6-1-1 {{for this purpose}} as well. Many telephone companies, including Canada's Telus, are experimenting with merging 8-1-1 and 6-1-1 service now that neither will usually route directly to a human operator. Generally, an automatic phone answering system or other <b>automated</b> <b>attendant</b> will now answer both lines anyway.|$|E

50|$|The {{internal}} number assignments may {{be independent of}} any direct inward dialing (DID) services provided by external telecommunication vendors. For numbers without DID access, the internal switch relays externally originated calls via an operator, an <b>automated</b> <b>attendant</b> or an electronic interactive voice response system. Telephone numbers for users within such systems are often published by suffixing the official telephone number with the extension number, e.g., 1-800-555-0001 x2055.|$|E
5000|$|The {{series of}} steps and {{processes}} by which an organization automates the handling of telephone calls (usually incoming calls). Call processing in this sense may include the initial greeting of the call (perhaps time-of-day or other factor dependent) to routing the call based on dialed digits or lack thereof. The automated treatment may include routing the call to an Interactive Voice Response System (IVR), sending the call to a voice mail system, queuing the call, etc. {{or a combination of}} steps and real-time decisions. See also <b>Automated</b> <b>attendant.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Telephone callers will {{recognize}} an <b>automated</b> <b>attendant</b> system {{as one that}} greets calls incoming to an organization with a recorded greeting of the form, [...] "Thank you for calling .... If you know your party's extension, you may dial it any time during this message." [...] Callers who have a touch tone (DTMF) phone can dial an extension number or, in most cases, wait for operator ("attendant") assistance. Since the telephone network does not transmit the DC signals from rotary dial telephones (except for audible clicks), callers who have rotary dial phones {{have to wait for}} assistance.|$|E
5000|$|In telephony, an <b>automated</b> <b>attendant</b> (also auto attendant, auto-attendant, autoattendant or AA, or virtual receptionist) allows callers to be {{automatically}} {{transferred to}} an extension without {{the intervention of}} an operator/receptionist). Many AAs will also offer a simple menu system ("for sales, press 1, for service, press 2," [...] etc.). An auto attendant may also allow a caller to reach a live operator by dialing a number, usually [...] "0". Typically the auto attendant is included in a business's phone system such as a PBX, but some services allow businesses to use an AA without such a system. Modern AA services (which now overlap with more complicated interactive voice response or IVR systems) can route calls to mobile phones, VoIP virtual phones, other AAs/IVRs, or other locations using traditional land-line phones.|$|E
50|$|In {{business}} telephony, {{a telephone}} extension may {{refer to a}} phone on an internal telephone line attached to a private branch exchange (PBX) or Centrex system. The PBX operates much as a community switchboard does for a geographic telephone numbering plan and allows multiple lines inside the office to connect without each phone requiring a separate outside line. In these systems, one usually has to dial a number (typically 9 in North America, 0 in Europe) to tell the PBX to connect with an outside landline (also called DDCO, or Direct Dial Central Office) to dial an external number. Within the PBX, the user merely dials the extension number to reach any other user directly. For inbound calls, a switchboard operator or <b>automated</b> <b>attendant</b> may request {{the number of the}} desired extension or the call may be completed with direct inbound dialing if outside numbers are assigned to individual extensions.|$|E
5000|$|The first tool enabled {{to perform}} digital speech {{recognition}} was the IBM Shoebox, {{presented to the}} general public during the 1962 Seattle World's Fair after its initial market launch in 1961. This early computer, developed almost 20 years before the introduction of the first IBM Personal Computer in 1981, was able to recognize 16 spoken words and the digits 0 to 9. The next milestone in the development of voice recognition technology was achieved in the 1970s at the Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania with substantial support of the United States Department of Defense and its DARPA agency. Their tool [...] "Harpy" [...] mastered with about 1000 words the vocabulary of a three-year-old. About ten years later the same group of scientists developed a system that could not only analyze individual words but entire word sequences enabled by the Hidden Markov Model. Thus, the earliest virtual assistants, which applied speech recognition software were <b>automated</b> <b>attendant</b> and medical digital dictation software. In the 1990s digital speech recognition technology became a feature of the personal computer with Microsoft, IBM, Philips and Lernout & Hauspie fighting for customers. Much later the market launch of the first smartphone IBM Simon in 1994 laid the foundation for smart virtual assistants as we know them today. The first modern digital virtual assistant installed on a smartphone was Siri, which was introduced as a feature of the iPhone 4S on October 4, 2011. Apple Inc. developed Siri following the 2010 acquisition of Siri Inc., a spin-off of SRI International, which is a research institute financed by DARPA and the United States Department of Defense.|$|E
30|$|Interactive Voice Response (IVR) is a {{technology}} that allows automatic human-computer interactions, via a telephone keypad or voice commands. Its key function is to provide end-users with self-service voice information [1]. IVR systems are widely used in many industries, including telecommunications and banking, to improve customer satisfaction, reduce cost, and ensure uninterrupted service. Examples of IVR applications include automated attendants, automated meter readers and IVR banking. The <b>automated</b> <b>attendant</b> transfers callers to the appropriate extensions automatically, without intervention by a receptionist; using automated meter readers, utilities customers can remotely enter their meter readings, while IVR banking allows end-users to consult their bank balance or last transactions, for instance.|$|E
40|$|Interactive Voice Response (IVR) {{applications}} are ubiquitous nowadays. <b>Automated</b> <b>attendant,</b> bank teller and automated surveys {{are a few}} of many applications requiring IVR capabilities. Cloud computing is a paradigm gaining a lot of momentum. It has three major service models: Infrastructure as a service – IaaS, Platform as a service – PaaS, and Software as a Service – SaaS. It offers also several inherent benefits such as scalability, resource efficiency and easy introduction of new functionality. However, very few, if any, IVR {{applications are}} offered today in cloud-based settings despite of all its potential benefits. This thesis deals with IaaS. Accordingly, we propose a novel architecture for a virtualized IVR infrastructure that relies on RESTFul Web services. The architecture proposes IVR substrates that are virtualized, composed, and assembled on the fly to build IVR applications. As a proof of concept, we have implemented an IaaS prototype on which performance measurements have been done to evaluate our architecture concept. In addition, a simple proof of concept PaaS consisting of a graphical user interface (GUI) has been built to enable the development and management of simple IVR services in the SaaS layer. ...|$|E

40|$|Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP) is {{increasingly}} gaining popularity over the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) {{because of its}} advanced features and flexibility. A crucial factor {{in the success of}} a VOIP system is its reliability. VOIP systems must attain reliability levels comparable to the PSTN, which has five nines availability. This thesis describes the design and implementation of a fully functional VOIP system that is well suited for a high availability design. For a comprehensive understanding of the IP based PBX, the working of traditional PBXs and their evolution has been described. A discussion on high availability and how the existing systems achieve it has also been given. The protocols and individual components of the designed system have also been described in detail. The fully functional VOIP system was successfully designed and implemented from basic elements. and is completely developed from open source software. It uses Kamailio, a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) router for the setting up and routing of calls. It also contains FreeSWITCH, which acts as a SIP accessory to provide extra features such as music-on-hold, voice-mail, <b>automated</b> <b>attendant</b> and conference calls. Calls to the PSTN are supported with the help of FreeSWITCH, which also functions as the Session Border Controller (SBC). Alpine Linux is the operating source used as it is highly conducive for running VOIP systems. The system implemented is flexible and can even be accessed through analog legacy phones with the help of Analog Telephone Adapters (ATAs). The system can be scaled to provide thousands of call setups per second. It uses a modular design and DNS based telephone number mapping. This makes it highly favorable to achieve high availability by adding redundant components and managing failovers with the help of DNS Service Resource (SRV) records...|$|E
