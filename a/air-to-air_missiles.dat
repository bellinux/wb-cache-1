5|$|The RAAF's Hornets {{have been}} fitted with several {{different}} types of air-to-air weapons. The aircraft are equipped with an internal M61A1 cannon for use against air and ground targets; 578 rounds can be carried for this weapon. During the initial years of the Hornet's service, the aircraft were equipped with AIM-9M Sidewinder short range <b>air-to-air</b> <b>missiles</b> and AIM-7M Sparrow medium-range <b>air-to-air</b> <b>missiles.</b> The Sparrows were replaced by the AIM-120 AMRAAM in 2002, and in 2004 the Sidewinders were replaced by ASRAAMs. The older missiles are occasionally used in training exercises, however.|$|E
5|$|The McDonnell Douglas A-4G Skyhawk is {{a variant}} of the Douglas A-4 Skyhawk attack {{aircraft}} developed for the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). The model was based on the A-4F variant of the Skyhawk, and was fitted with slightly different avionics as well as the capacity to operate AIM-9 Sidewinder <b>air-to-air</b> <b>missiles.</b> The RAN received ten A-4Gs in 1967 and another ten in 1971, and operated the type from 1967 to 1984.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{is powered}} by a pair of uprated T700-GE-701C engines. The forward fuselage was expanded to accommodate new systems to improve survivability, navigation, and 'tactical internet' communications capabilities. In February 2003, the first Block II Apache was delivered to the U.S. Army, featuring digital communications upgrades. The Japanese Apache AH-64DJP variant is based on the AH-64D; it can be equipped with the AIM-92 Stinger <b>air-to-air</b> <b>missiles</b> for self-defense.|$|E

5|$|Both {{versions}} use {{a common}} airframe, with three Rolls-Royce Turbomeca RTM322 engines, their range and endurance using only a two engine cruise option, is , or six hours. However, range {{can be extended}} further when the five underfloor fuel tanks are supplemented with auxiliary fuel tanks fitted in the cabin. Armament depends on mission, but includes anti-ship missiles, torpedoes, three door-mounted machine guns, multi-purpose rocket, cannon pods, <b>air-to-air</b> <b>missiles</b> and air-to-surface missiles. At least 14 Merlin HM2s will be assigned to the carrier.|$|E
5|$|On 5 June 1984, two Saudi Arabian {{fighter pilots}} shot down two Iranian F-4 fighters. The Royal Saudi Air Force pilots were flying American-built F-15s and fired <b>air-to-air</b> <b>missiles</b> {{to bring down}} the Iranian planes. The Saudi fighter pilots had KC-135 aerial tanker planes and Boeing E-3 Sentry AWACS {{surveillance}} planes assist in the encounter. The aerial fight occurred in Saudi airspace over the Gulf near the Saudi island Al Arabiyah, about 60 miles northeast of Jubail.|$|E
5|$|The F-20 {{would have}} been able to use most of the common weapons in U.S.'s inventory, {{including}} the entire range of Mark 80 series bombs, the AGM-65 Maverick air-to-ground missile, and the AIM-9 Sidewinder and AIM-7 Sparrow <b>air-to-air</b> <b>missiles.</b> Like the earlier F-5s, the test F-20s were equipped with two M39 cannon mounted in the nose. Production F-20s may have substituted two Ford Aerospace Tigerclaw cannons instead of the M39s; while the Tigerclaw was based on the M39, it was lighter and had a higher rate of fire than the M39A2.|$|E

It is the only guided American <b>air-to-air</b> <b>missile</b> with a nuclear warhead to be produced, though the unguided AIR-2 Genie rocket was also nuclear-armed.|$|R
5|$|The Jaguar International had {{the unusual}} {{optional}} provision for overwing pylons, used for short-range <b>air-to-air</b> <b>missiles,</b> {{such as the}} Matra R550 Magic or the AIM-9 Sidewinder. This option frees up the under-wing pylons for other weapons and stores. RAF Jaguars gained overwing pylons in the buildup to Operation Granby in 1990, but French Jaguars were not modified. The RAF's Jaguar 97s were intended to be wired for the carriage of ASRAAMs on the overwing launchers, but clearance of this weapon was never completed because of funding cuts.|$|E
5|$|The Phantom {{is a large}} fighter with a {{top speed}} of over Mach2.2. It can carry more than 18,000 pounds (8,400kg) of weapons on nine {{external}} hardpoints, including <b>air-to-air</b> <b>missiles,</b> air-to-ground missiles, and various bombs. The F-4, like other interceptors of its time, was designed without an internal cannon. Later models incorporated an M61 Vulcan rotary cannon. Beginning in 1959, it set 15 world records for in-flight performance, including an absolute speed record, and an absolute altitude record.|$|E
5|$|Swiss Hunters were {{operated}} as interceptors, with {{a secondary}} ground-attack role; from 1963 onwards, the outboard wing pylons were modified to carry two AIM-9 Sidewinder <b>air-to-air</b> <b>missiles.</b> In the ground-attack role, the Swiss Air Force maintained {{an arsenal of}} conventional iron bombs, a number of compatible napalm bombs were also maintained for intended use by the Hunters. In the interceptor role, the Hunters were supplemented by a surface-to-air missile (SAM) defence system also procured from the United Kingdom, based on the Bristol Bloodhound. In case of unservicable airstrips, Swiss Air Force Jets would take off from adjacent highways, using them as improvised runways.|$|E

5|$|By 1975, {{plans were}} laid {{to replace the}} Hunter in the air-to-air role with a more modern fighter aircraft, the Northrop F-5E Tiger II. The Hunter {{remained}} in a key role within the Swiss Air Force; like the RAF's Hunter fleet, the type transitioned to become the country's primary ground attack platform, replacing the Venom. While the Swiss Hunters already had more armament options than the RAF aircraft, being cleared to carry Oerlikon 80mm rockets instead of the elderly 3-inch rockets used by the RAF, to carry bombs from both inner and outer pylons and to launch AIM-9 Sidewinder <b>air-to-air</b> <b>missiles,</b> the change to a primary air-to-ground role resulted in the Hunter 80 upgrade, adding chaff/flare dispensers, BL755 cluster bombs {{and the ability to}} carry AGM-65 Maverick missiles.|$|E
5|$|Early F-16s {{could be}} armed {{with up to}} six AIM-9 Sidewinder heat-seeking {{short-range}} <b>air-to-air</b> <b>missiles</b> (AAM) by employing rail launchers on each wingtip, as well as radar guided AIM-7 Sparrow medium-range AAMs in a weapons mix. More recent versions support the AIM-120 AMRAAM. The aircraft can carry various other AAMs, {{a wide variety of}} air-to-ground missiles, rockets or bombs; electronic countermeasures (ECM), navigation, targeting or weapons pods; and fuel tanks on 9 hardpoints – six under the wings, two on wingtips, and one under the fuselage. Two other locations under the fuselage are available for sensor or radar pods. The F-16 carries a 20 mm (0.787 in) M61A1 Vulcan cannon for close range aerial combat and strafing. The 20mm cannon is mounted inside the fuselage {{to the left of the}} cockpit.|$|E
5|$|For {{the light}} attack role, the RAH-66 {{was to be}} {{furnished}} with various armaments. It was equipped with a single 20mm three-barrel XM301 Gatling gun, which was fixed underneath the nose section. In addition, the RAH-66 was capable of internally carrying a maximum of six AGM-114 Hellfire air-to-ground missiles or up to twelve AIM-92 Stinger <b>air-to-air</b> <b>missiles,</b> which would be evenly divided between a pair of retractable weapons pylons. Beyond the internal munitions stowage, the Comanche could also carry up to four Hellfire missiles or a maximum of eight Stinger missiles externally, set upon on each of its stub wings; however, operations performing with any armaments mounted externally would unavoidably resulted in a reduction {{of the effectiveness of}} the rotorcraft's stealth technologies.|$|E

5|$|Starting in the 1980s, the Stinger and AIM-9 Sidewinder <b>air-to-air</b> <b>missiles</b> and the AGM-122 Sidearm {{anti-radiation}} missile were evaluated for use upon the AH-64. The Stinger was initially selected; the U.S. Army was also considering the Starstreak air-to-air missile. External fuel tanks {{can also be}} carried on the stub wings to increase range and mission time. The stub-wing pylons have mounting points for maintenance access; these mountings {{can be used to}} secure externally personnel for emergency transportation. Stinger missiles are often used on non-U.S. Apaches, as foreign forces do not have as many air superiority aircraft to control the skies. The AH-64E initially lacked the ability to use the Stinger to make room for self-defense equipment, but the capability was re-added following a South Korean demand.|$|E
5|$|The F-22 was {{designed}} to be highly difficult to detect and track by radar. Measures to reduce radar cross-section include airframe shaping such as alignment of edges, fixed-geometry serpentine inlets that prevent line-of-sight of the engine faces from any exterior view, use of radar-absorbent material (RAM), and attention to detail such as hinges and pilot helmets that could provide a radar return. The F-22 was also designed to have decreased radio emissions, infrared signature and acoustic signature as well as reduced visibility to the naked eye. The aircraft's flat thrust-vectoring nozzle reduces infrared emissions to mitigate the threat of infrared homing ("heat seeking") surface-to-air or <b>air-to-air</b> <b>missiles.</b> Additional measures to reduce the infrared signature include special paint and active cooling of leading edges to manage the heat buildup from supersonic flight.|$|E
5|$|The major {{difference}} between the F-4J and the British Phantoms was {{the absence of the}} Rolls-Royce Spey turbofan, the former being fitted with the GE J79-10B. This produced less power than the British engine, but had a faster afterburner light up, giving it better performance at high altitude, at the expense of slightly poorer acceleration at low level. The high-altitude performance was helped by the reduced drag from its smaller air intakes. Initially delivered capable of carrying the AIM-7 Sparrow and AIM-9 Sidewinder <b>air-to-air</b> <b>missiles</b> (AAM), they were soon made compatible with the Skyflash and SUU-23A gun pod, bringing them into line {{with the rest of the}} RAF's Phantoms. Despite modifications to allow them to operate with the rest of the fleet, the F-4Js retained the vast bulk of the equipment they were originally fitted with, even requiring their crews to use American flying helmets.|$|E

5|$|The {{two largest}} {{users of the}} Harrier were the Royal Air Force and the United States Marine Corps (USMC). The {{exported}} model of the aircraft operated by the USMC was designated the AV-8A Harrier, which was broadly similar to the RAF's Harrier GR.1. Changes included the removal of all magnesium components, which corroded quickly at sea, and the integration of American radios and Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) systems; furthermore the outer pylons, unlike the RAF aircraft, were designed from delivery to be equipped with self-defence AIM-9 Sidewinder heat-seeking <b>air-to-air</b> <b>missiles.</b> Most of the AV-8As had been delivered with the more powerful Pegasus engine used in the GR.3 instead of the one used in the earlier GR.1. Two-seat Harriers were operated for training purposes; the body was stretched and a taller tail fin added. The RAF trained in the T.2 and T.4 versions, while T.4N and T.8 were training versions the Navy's Sea Harrier, with appropriate fittings. The US and Spain flew the TAV-8A and TAV-8S, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Korean Air Lines Flight 007 (also {{known as}} KAL007 and KE007) was a {{scheduled}} Korean Air Lines flight from New York City to Seoul via Anchorage, Alaska. On September 1, 1983, the South Korean airliner serving {{the flight was}} shot down by a Soviet Su-15 interceptor. The Boeing 747 airliner was en route from Anchorage to Seoul, but deviated from its original planned route and flew through Soviet prohibited airspace {{around the time of}} a U.S. aerial reconnaissance mission. The Soviet Air Force treated the unidentified aircraft as an intruding U.S. spy plane, and proceeded to destroy it with <b>air-to-air</b> <b>missiles,</b> after firing warning shots which were likely not seen by the KAL pilots. The Korean airliner eventually crashed in the sea near Moneron Island west of Sakhalin in the Sea of Japan. All 269 passengers and crew aboard were killed, including Larry McDonald, a Representative from Georgia in the United States House of Representatives. The Soviets found the wreckage under the sea on September 15, and found the flight recorders in October, but this information was kept secret until 1993.|$|E
5|$|With the Mirage2000 and F-18L rejected, the RAAF {{was faced}} with a choice between the F-16 and F-18A. Richardson and several other RAAF pilots tested United States Air Force (USAF) F-16Bs in 1979 and 1980, and {{reported}} that the aircraft had excellent performance but could be difficult to control at times. The evaluation team was also concerned about the reliability of the F-16's engine and regarded the aircraft as technologically immature. It was also noted that the aircraft's radar was inferior to that of the F-18A, and that F-16s could not fire the beyond-visual-range (BVR) <b>air-to-air</b> <b>missiles</b> and long-range anti-shipping missiles that the F-18A was capable of operating. In contrast, the evaluation team was impressed by the F-18A, and regarded it as being a more robust and survivable aircraft as it had been designed to operate from aircraft carriers; these features were important for operations from bare bases in northern Australia. Richardson and three other RAAF pilots test-flew F-18As, and reported that the aircraft handled well, but had some deficiencies with its flight control system and engines; these were not seen as major flaws by the evaluation team, however. The F-18A's twin engines were considered to be its main advantage over the single-engined F-16, as research conducted by the evaluation team found that the attrition rate for single-engined fighters was twice that for aircraft with two engines. Overall, however, the RAAF judged that both the F-16 and F-18A were too immature for a decision to be made in 1980 as had been originally planned, and recommended to the Government that this be deferred by a year.|$|E
