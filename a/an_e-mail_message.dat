25|$|Because JavaScript code can run locally in a user's browser (rather than on {{a remote}} server), the browser can respond to user actions quickly, making an {{application}} more responsive. Furthermore, JavaScript code can detect user actions that HTML alone cannot, such as individual keystrokes. Applications such as Gmail take advantage of this: much of the user-interface logic is written in JavaScript, and JavaScript dispatches requests for information (such as the content of <b>an</b> <b>e-mail</b> <b>message)</b> to the server. The wider trend of Ajax programming similarly exploits this strength.|$|E
25|$|This {{perspective}} {{examines how}} the Internet and its related technologies have encouraged {{new and different}} forms of creativity in language, especially in literature. It looks at the Internet as a medium through which new language phenomena have arisen. This new mode of language is interesting to study {{because it is an}} amalgam of both spoken and written languages. For example, traditional writing is static compared to the dynamic nature of the new language on the Internet where words can appear in different colors and font sizes on the computer screen. Yet, this new mode of language also contains other elements not found in natural languages. One example is the concept of framing found in e-mails and discussion forums. In replying to e-mails, people generally use the sender’s e-mail message as a frame to write their own messages. They can choose to respond to certain parts of <b>an</b> <b>e-mail</b> <b>message</b> while leaving other bits out. In discussion forums, one can start a new thread and anyone regardless of their physical location can respond to the idea or thought that was set down through the Internet. This is something that is usually not found in written language.|$|E

40|$|E-mail {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular, fastest and {{cheapest}} means of communication. As a result, the volume of e-mail that we get is constantly growing. This is one aspect of a more general information overload problem faced by many people; too much time and effort is being spent on filtering <b>e-mail</b> <b>messages</b> and organizing them into folders. Most modern e-mail software packages provide some form of programmable automatic filtering, typically in the form of sets of rules that organize mail into folders or dispose of junk mail based on keywords detected in the headers or message body. Unfortunately manually constructing a set of robust rules or searching for keywords is an arcane task. Moreover, users are constantly creating, deleting and reorganizing their folders.
