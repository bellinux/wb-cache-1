5|$|Key Sounds Label has {{its origins}} in 1999, {{two years before the}} first album on the label was released. When the visual novel company Key, under the {{publisher}} VisualArt's, was about to release their debut title Kanon, Key produced the arrange album <b>Anemoscope</b> and bundled it with the first-print release of Kanon released in June 1999. The second music release, a single, occurred in November 1999. The third release, another arrange album, followed in September 2000 bundled with the first-print release of Key's second title Air, and was the first music release by Key to bear a catalog number, KYCD-0303. Each of these three were released in limited editions, and thus were not widely sold.|$|E
5|$|The Sundial Room, {{also called}} the Meridian Hall, was once the {{residence}} of Queen Christina of Sweden, then newly converted to Catholicism. The room was further modified by two additions which gave it its current name: a sundial, and a delicate but sophisticated <b>anemoscope</b> which was fixed to {{the ceiling of the}} Meridian Hall. These were created by Ignazio Danti, the papal cosmographer, in association with the Gregorian Calendar Reform. The sundial consisted of a straight line in white marble running across the floor in a north-south direction, intended to measure the height of the Sun at noon according to the seasons of the year.|$|E
50|$|The basic {{area of the}} oak {{bell tower}} is ten by ten meters. Its height is 32 meters, {{including}} the top crescent supported by a steel rod, which complies with the customary 1:3 base:height ratio of Hungarian bell-towers. The carved planks reaching down from the gallery form a whispering gallery, which shows great artistic flair.The whole tower including all joints and nails is made of wood. The structure stands on nine pillars placed on a 16 section base grid of oak beams. The pillars that reach up to the gallery, the actual bell chamber, are divided into four sections by horizontal binding joists. The body of the tower is strengthened by a mass of strutting beams, diagonal and corner supports. The scarf-joints are executed traditionally, syphering with dovetail joints and mortised holes. Square headed wooden nails were used for securing the joints. A wooden staircase made up of three straight sections leads up to the gallery, interrupted by resting floors. The bell-house houses two bells hanging on separate bellfries. The steep square based roof tops in an octagonal cap. There are four dainty circular turrets on {{the four corners of}} the roof structure. The <b>anemoscopes</b> on the quadrilateral turrets show the years: 1778, 1841, 1889and 1928. These are dates of restoration.Belltowers of this kind were built throughout Eastern Hungary and Transylvania. Out of them all Nyírbátor's is the largest and most notable. The skirting of the roof and body are shingled.The contemporary bell bears reliefs of the four evangelists. According to the engraved script, it was cast by George Weird of Eperjes in 1640, and commissioned by Stephen and Peter Bethlen.|$|R

50|$|Otto von Guericke {{gave the}} title <b>anemoscope</b> to a machine invented by him to foretell {{the change of}} the weather, as to fair and rain.

5000|$|A leitmotif named [...] "Hidamari no Machi" [...] (lit.

The theme is composed by Shinji Orito, one of Keys signature composers, and is the longest of Kanons five leitmotifs on the Kanon Original Soundtrack at 3:04 minutes. A remix version by Magome Togoshi appeared on the Kanon soundtracks <b>Anemoscope</b> and Recollections. [...] "Hidamari no Machi" [...] was composed in common time in the E-flat major key, and moves at 126 beats per minute. The theme was composed on a synthesizer which primarily used a piano as a base, along with violin, vibraphone, and percussion accompaniment throughout the piece.

40|$|ABSTRACT Although the Mesoscale Community Compressible (MC 2) model {{successfully}} reproduces {{the wind}} climate (for wind energy development purposes) of the Gaspé region, equivalent simulations for the steep moun-tainous southern Yukon have been unsatisfactory. An {{important part of}} the problem lies in the provision of suit-able boundary conditions in the lower troposphere. This paper will describe an alternative provision of boundary conditions to the MC 2 model based partly on standard National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) Reanalysis statistics, however, with modified lower tropos-pheric conditions based on local radiosonde measurements. The MC 2 model is part of the <b>AnemoScope</b> wind energy simulation toolkit which applies statistical-dynamical downscaling of basic large-scale weather situations (i. e., the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis) to simulate the steady-state wind climate of a complex region. A case study summarized here imposes a typical mean winter tempera-ture inversion on the boundary conditions to reduce downward momentum transfer in the MC 2 model over the Whitehorse region. In conjunction with this step, the geostrophic wind at the boundaries is held constant (with height) in speed and direction, based on the (observed) dominant southwesterly winds above the mountaintops. The resulting simulation produces wind directions within the modelled domain that are in much better agreement with the available measurements. However, despite the imposed atmospheric stability, downward transfer of hor...|$|E
