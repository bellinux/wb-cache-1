This paper presents a Multilevel Energy Buffer and Voltage Modulator (MEB) that significantly reduces the range of voltage conversion ratios that the dc-ac converter portion of the micro-inverter must operate over by stepping its effective input voltage in pace with the line voltage. The MEB partially replaces the original bulk input capacitor, and functions as an active energy buffer to reduce the total size of the twice-line-frequency energy buffering capacitance. The small additional loss of the MEB can be compensated by the improved efficiency of the dc-ac converter stage, leading to a higher overall system efficiency. The MEB architecture can be implemented in a variety of manners, allowing different design tradeoffs to be made.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} one of the most {{important}} disturbances that affect the quality of the electrical supply. Voltage sags cause industrial processes malfunction, producing an enormous economical impact. A voltage sag is defined as a short duration reduction of the <b>rms</b> <b>voltage.</b> A voltage disturbance is in general considered as a sag when the <b>rms</b> <b>voltage</b> remains below 90 % of nominal voltage for a period not exceeding 3 minutes, however, there is not full agreement about these limits. A comprehensive literature review on power quality and voltage sags is included in this thesis. A voltage sag characterisation method based on instantaneous voltages and phasor analysis is introduced. Through the analysis of the voltage phasor the sag magnitude, the phase-angle jump and the event duration are obtained. A new method for the sag classification of unbalanced sags into ABC categories using instantaneous voltages is proposed. The presentation of the voltage sag characteristics is also important for the understanding of the event. Several methods for the presentation of sag characteristics are described. Besides the usual <b>rms</b> <b>voltage</b> vs. time and phase angle vs. time representation, a new method based on the phasor locus, extreme phasors, and a set of phasor snapshots is proposed. The system performance is assessed through sag indices such as voltage sag frequency. The indices are obtained from measurements and a deterministic method combined with two simulation tools: a time-domain simulation program and a short-circuit calculation program. Both approaches are very suitable to simulate voltage sags. The choice for one of the approaches should be based on the goals of the study and the availability of system data. The system performance is also assessed by stochastic simulation using the method of fault positions. The performance of some selected buses is estimated and compared to the actual one obtained from a voltage sag survey. The strengths and shortcomings of the method of fault positions are discussed. The sensitivity of the method is analysed in terms of variations of the fault rate, fault type distribution, and fault position. The location of the source of voltage sags is estimated considering two network regions: upstream and downstream to a certain monitored bus. Several methods using voltage and current information are investigated and their performances are compared. A new method using only sag magnitude is introduced. The method is successfully applied in a simulated case study and verified by data obtained during a sag survey. The method shows its strength when applied in a sag survey where only voltage information is available...|$|R
