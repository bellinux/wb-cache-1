The suspension was then heated {{in a microwave}} oven until boiling point and let to cool down. This operation was repeated twice {{in order to increase}} the gel transparency. After cooling down to room temperature a viscous gel was obtained (at 40 - 45 °C). <b>Agar</b> <b>gels</b> with additives {{were prepared}} in the same way by dissolving a constant amount of additive (1 % w/w) to the water prior to adding the agar powder. The following additives were tested: Tween 20, polysorbate surfactant; TAC, ammonium citrate tribasic; EDTA, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (all provided by CTS S.r.l); PASP, sodium polyaspartate (Lanxess). All these additives are commonly used for these purposes except for PASP, which was selected as a possible “green” alternative to EDTA [35]. <b>Agar</b> <b>gels</b> with different concentrations and additives were tested with different application times: 15, 30, 60, 120  minutes.

40|$|Summary. Stevia rebaudiana Bert., {{one of the}} {{important}} medicinal plants was subjected to in vitro multiplication. MS basal medium supplemented with BAP (3 mg. l- 1) produced the highest number of multiple shoots (40. 54) per explant. However, the maximum shoot length and the highest number of leaves were obtained on MS medium supplemented with BAP (5 mg. l- 1), IAA (0. 5 mg. l- 1) and GA (1. 0 mg. l- 1). Root initiation and growth was observed on half strength MS medium supplemented with 2 mg. l- 1 IBA. The present study indicated 40 numbers of shoots after 30 days of culture, thus offering a new opportunity for fulfillment of the increased demand of the plant material in present scenario.

Shoot tips were cultured on agar and sterculia gum gelled media to study the difference in shoot and root regeneration response. Initially, shoot tips were cultured on <b>agar</b> <b>gelled</b> Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with different concentrations of 6 -Benzyl amino purine (BAP), Kinetin (KN) and Naphthalene acetic acid (NAA). Maximum percentage of cultures showing shoot regeneration (63. 19 %) was observed on <b>agar</b> <b>gelled</b> MS medium containing BAP 1. 5, KN 0. 5 and NAA 0. 5 mg L - 1. Sterculia gum and agar were then evaluated at different concentrations and combinations. The media gelled with sterculia gum was equally transparent as that of liquid medium. The shoot regeneration response on media gelled with 25 and 30 g L - 1 sterculia gum were 49. 99 and 61. 11 % respectively.

Partially improvement in the rooting process, coupled with cost reduction was obtained during the invitro rooting by the use of a natural support based on sugarcane bagasse as a substitute for the traditionally used <b>agar</b> <b>gelled</b> medium.

40|$|International audienceA {{wide range}} of thermoreversible gels are {{prepared}} by cooling down to ambient temperature hot aqueous polymer solutions.

In this article, we revisit the formation of 1. 5 % wt. <b>agar</b> <b>gels</b> {{through a series of}} benchmark rheological experiments performed with a plate-plate geometry. We demonstrate on that particular gel of polysaccharides that the contraction associated with the sol/gel transition cannot be neglected. Indeed, imposing a constant gap width during the gelation results in the strain hardening of the sample, as evidenced by the large negative normal force that develops. Such hardening leads to the slow drift in time of the gelelastic modulus G 0 toward ever larger values, and thus to an erroneous estimate of G 0. As an alternative, we show that imposing a constant normal force equals to zero during the gelation, instead of a constant gap width, suppresses the hardening as the decrease of the gap compensates for the sample contraction. As such, imposing a zero normal force is a more reliable way to measure the linear properties of <b>agar</b> <b>gels,</b> which we prove to work equally well with rough and smooth boundary conditions [...] ...|$|R
