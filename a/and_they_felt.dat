Ratings wise, new episodes of The Cosby Show beat The Simpsons every time during the second season and The Simpsons eventually fell out of the top ten. At {{the end of the season}} Cosby averaged as the fifth highest rated show on television, while The Simpsons was thirty eighth.|$|E
5|$|In August 2005, CP+B and Burger King {{became the}} target of lawyers of the band Slipknot, who alleged the mask-wearing rooster rockers were a blatant copy of the band's style. The band claimed that CP+B had {{approached}} Slipknot's record company, Roadrunner Records, with an offer to appear in another commercial for Burger King. The band declined {{on the grounds that}} they did not want to be associated with a burger chain <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> that the Coq Roq advertisements were deliberately co-opting the band's signature look and style in order to influence its fans to purchase the chain's products. The band issued a cease and desist letter to CP+B and BK requesting the advertisements be pulled. When the two parties declined, the band sued for an undisclosed amount.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons {{first season}} was the Fox network's first TV series to rank among a season's top 30 highest-rated shows. Due to its success, the Fox network decided to switch The Simpsons {{timeslots}} {{in hopes that}} it would result in higher ratings for the lead out shows. It would move from 8:00 PM on Sunday night to the same time on Thursday where it would compete with The Cosby Show, the number one show at the time. Many of the producers were against the move, as The Simpsons {{had been in the}} top 10 while airing on Sunday <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> the move would destroy its ratings.|$|E

5|$|Thirty Seconds to Mars {{retreated to}} the {{isolation}} of Wyoming's countryside in 2001 to record their debut album, working with Bob Ezrin and Brian Virtue. They contacted Ezrin because they {{grew up listening to}} his work with Pink Floyd, Kiss and Alice Cooper <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> {{he was the only one}} who could help them capture the size and scope of what they wanted to accomplish on their debut recording. The band chose an empty warehouse lot on 15,000 acres, striving for the precise location that would enhance their sound. Even before the album was released, Puddle of Mudd invited Thirty Seconds to Mars to open a six-week tour for them in the spring of 2002. The band later embarked on a North American tour to support Incubus and began a club tour in August.|$|E
5|$|Midshipman David Casey was an {{experienced}} junior {{officer who had}} distinguished himself to Captain Pigot during the previous months, but his disrating {{was one of the}} primary triggers to the mutiny. About a week before the mutiny, Casey was at his station on the main top, and the captain noticed that a gasket, one of the ties that held the sail securely, had not been tied by one of the sailors under his supervision. Casey was brought before the captain, and apologised for the oversight and took responsibility for it. The captain demanded that Casey apologise on his knees, a completely unacceptable and debasing demand for a gentleman. Casey refused to be humiliated in such a way. Pigot offered him one more opportunity and when Casey once more refused, the captain ordered that Casey receive 12 lashes (more commonly a sailor's punishment than that of a junior officer), and he was disrated, which would effectively end his career as a naval officer. Casey was a popular officer amongst the crew <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> that he was punished unfairly. The topmen began to plot mutiny.|$|E

On February 9, 1829 they sailed for Africa on the Harriet. along with his mother and five of his six siblings. Travelling onboard the same ship was James Spriggs Payne, who would later become Liberia's fourth president.|$|E
25|$|The second {{qualifying}} session began {{fifteen minutes}} later than scheduled due to freight for the Guia Race of Macau being stranded in Beijing, and was further delayed by crashes in the local touring car support races. When the session did start, Jarvis set the early pace before he was eclipsed by Tsukakoshi one minute before the conclusion of second qualifying. This was immediately bettered by Jarvis with a lap of two minutes and 11.696 which he held to secure pole position for the qualifying race. Amser set his best time on his last lap to join Jarvis on {{the front row of}} the grid. Tsukakoshi was 0.216 seconds adrift in third place. Buemi remained in fourth position with Mortara moving up four positions to fifth. Grosjean's effort in second qualifying dropped him to sixth overall while teammate Kobayashi similarly lost ground and could only manage seventh. The top ten was completed by Oshima, Streit and Buurman. Behind them {{the rest of the field}} consisted of Jakes, Guerrieri, Jelley, Van Dam, Hülkenberg, Bird, Breen, Senna, Kennard, Mustonen, Hartley, Mailleux, Van Der Zande, Izawa, Ho, Ávila, Grubmüller, Lou Meng, Kit Meng and Merszei. The session was halted three times: firstly for Van Der Zande who crashed into the barriers leaving Paiol corner and debris was littered across the track. Hartley was the cause of the second stoppage when he impacted the wall at the exit of Lisboa turn and his car was stranded in a dangerous position. The final stoppage was for Grubmüller who went into the barriers on his out-lap. Buemi and Buurman each received penalties after second qualifying: Buemi was summoned to the stewards office for a review of his fastest lap <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> his attempt was recorded under yellow flag conditions. Thus, Buemi was demoted five places on the grid. Buurman dropped three positions after he was adjudged to move into the fast lane of the pit lane before it was declared open.|$|E
500|$|Sony Pictures Imageworks {{designed}} the visual effects sequences. Burton felt 3D was {{appropriate to the}} story's environment. Burton and Zanuck chose to film with conventional cameras, and convert the footage into 3D during post-production; Zanuck explained 3D cameras were too expensive and [...] "clumsy" [...] to use, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> {{that there was no}} difference between converted footage and those shot in the format. James Cameron, who released his 3D film Avatar in December 2009, criticized the choice, stating, [...] "It doesn't make any sense to shoot in 2-D and convert to 3-D".|$|E

500|$|The Simpsons {{settled into}} the 8:00 PM position, which put it in direct {{competition}} with the five-time defending #1 show in all of television, The Cosby Show. Many of the producers, including James L.

500|$|Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who {{had written}} for The Simpsons {{since the start of}} the show, took over as showrunners this season.

They also ran the following season and Jean would return as executive producer in season 13. There were two episodes, [...] "Kamp Krusty" [...] and [...] "A Streetcar Named Marge", that were produced at the same time, but aired during season four as holdover episodes. Two episodes that aired during this season, [...] "Stark Raving Dad" [...] and [...] "When Flanders Failed", were executive produced during the previous season by James L. Brooks, Matt Groening and Sam Simon.|$|E

Each member of Pink Floyd except Wright boycotted the press release of The Dark Side of the Moon because a quadraphonic mix {{had not yet been}} completed, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> presenting the album through a poor-quality stereo PA system was insufficient. Melody Makers Roy Hollingworth described side one as [...] "utterly confused... difficult to follow", but praised side two, writing: [...] "The songs, the sounds... the rhythms were solid... saxophone hit the air, the band rocked and rolled". Rolling Stones Loyd Grossman described it as [...] "a fine album with a textural and conceptual richness that not only invites, but demands involvement." ...|$|E

It was also the subject of a New York Times editorial and investigated on CBS News by Walter Cronkite. Washington was fined $10,000, and suspended for 60 days, missing 26 games; then the longest suspension for an on-court incident in NBA history. The Rockets were furious. Tomjanovich missed {{the rest of the season}} <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> Washington should at least have done likewise.|$|E

They felt they should have gotten some help from them.... didn't say why, but they certainly didn't feel they'd been handled fairly." [...] The Piccards struggled to gain financial support until the Grigsby-Grunow Radio Company advanced them several thousand dollars. The Detroit Aero Club and People's Outfitting Company also backed them. To supplement their sponsorship, Jeannette designed and sold commemorative stamps and souvenir programs and folders. She also raised a good deal of money by selling their story in press releases to the North American Newspaper Alliance.|$|E
500|$|Jean became show runner of The Simpsons at {{the start}} of the third season (1991) {{together}} with Reiss. A show runner has the ultimate responsibility of all the processes that an episode goes through before completion, including the writing, the animation, the voice acting, and the music. When Jean began his tenure as show runner, the only thing he thought to himself every day was [...] "Don't blow it and screw up this thing everyone loves." [...] The first episode Jean and Reiss ran was [...] "Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington" [...] (aired September 19, 1991), <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> a lot of pressure on them to make it good. They were so pressured that they did six to seven rewrites of the script in order to improve its humor. Jean said he [...] "kept thinking 'It's not good enough. It's not good enough.'" [...] Reiss added that [...] "we were definitely scared. We had never run anything before, and they dumped us on this." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Crazy for You" [...] {{is a song}} by American singer Madonna {{from the}} soundtrack album to the 1985 film Vision Quest. It was {{released}} on March 2, 1985 by Geffen Records as the first single from the soundtrack. The song appears remixed on the greatest hits compilation The Immaculate Collection (1990) and was re-released on February 24, 1991 by Sire Records to promote the album. The song was also included on the ballads compilation Something to Remember (1995) and the greatest hits compilation Celebration (2009). Producers Jon Peters and Peter Guber, along with music director Phil Ramone, decided to use Madonna after listening to her previous recordings, employing John Bettis and Jon Lind to write the song. After reading the script of the film, Bettis and Lind wrote the song {{about the situation in}} which the lead characters meet at a nightclub. Initial recording sessions did not impress Bettis and Lind, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> that [...] "Crazy for You" [...] would be dropped from the soundtrack. However, a new version was recorded to their liking.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by George Meyer. It is one of The Simpsons creator Matt Groening's {{favorite}} episodes of the earlier seasons {{because he thought it}} took the show to another level. Meyer said he has a [...] "deep suspicion of social institutions and tradition in general," [...] which affected the way he wrote the episode. Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who had written for The Simpsons {{since the start of the}} show, took over as show runners for the third season. Their first episode as show runners was [...] "Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington" [...] <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> a lot of pressure about running the show.

500|$|General Gage was {{understated}} in his {{casualty report}} to London: [...] "Two men {{were killed and}} a few wounded." [...] Others, however, apparently exaggerated, reporting large casualties. The Pennsylvania Journal reported on June 21, 1775, that General Gage himself recorded at least one hundred killed while other sources said more than three hundred. [...] From another source: [...] "The regulars {{were said to have}} suffered very much, not to have had less than two hundred killed and wounded. The loss was probably greatly exaggerated; that, however, had a good effect on the provincials. The affair was a matter of no small triumph to them <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> upon the occasion more courageous than ever." [...] Gage ordered cannon mounted on Copp's Hill in Boston, and Vice-Admiral Graves moved the Somerset, which had been stationed in the shallow waters between Boston and Charlestown, into deeper waters to the east of Boston, where it would have improved maneuverability if fired upon from land. [...] He also belatedly sent a detachment of regulars to secure Noddle's Island; the Colonists had long before removed or destroyed anything of value on the island.|$|E

After three yearly evaluations, administrators and evaluators acknowledged much broader input into evaluation but saw little evaluation related improvement in performance. Of the administrators, 85 % felt the process should continue as did 91 % of the evaluators.
