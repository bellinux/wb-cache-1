5|$|On June 27, 1955, the Howard Beach station, {{along with}} <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rockaway Beach Branch {{stations}} {{south of the}} now defunct Ozone Park station, {{was taken out of}} service for eight months for restructuring and upgrading of the tracks, so that they could accommodate subway service. During the project, the Howard Beach station, along with the Broad Channel and Far Rockaway stations, was completely rebuilt utilizing a modern design, which included a new overhead passageway between the two platforms. The design was created by architect J. Harold Sandifer, a native of the Rockaways. Many of the parts for the station were prefabricated, speeding construction. On June 28, 1956, the station reopened as a subway station {{along with the rest of}} the line. The previous Long Island Rail Road station at this location was razed. Inauguration ceremonies were held at the station as well as at Euclid Avenue in Brooklyn.|$|E
25|$|The mine owners retaliated with a lockout of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Leadville mines, {{so that by}} 22 June, {{the entire}} mining {{district}} was idled, {{with a total of}} about 2,250 mine workers out of work. The mine owners turned off the dewatering pumps and allowed the mines to start to fill with water, showing that they were prepared for a long strike.|$|E
25|$|Just before daybreak at {{the depth}} of the dark and rain, the waiting women and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wakefull town heard the great crash as the booms burst, and the cry of the whistle {{signaled}} the men's defeat. Logs from thousands of trees boiled over the broken dams, smashed together in a grinding roar and surged on down the current like giant toothpicks tossed by some elemental energy.|$|E

25|$|In {{the summer}} and fall of 2016, Connecticut {{experienced}} a drought {{in many parts of the}} state, causing some water-use bans. As of , 45% of the state was listed at Severe Drought by the US Drought Monitor, including almost all of Hartford and Litchfield counties. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state was in Moderate Drought or Severe Drought, including Middlesex, Fairfield, New London, New Haven, Windham, and Tolland counties. This affected the agricultural economy in the state.|$|E
25|$|A 1985 {{study found}} that {{temazepam}} and triazolam maintained significantly higher rates of self-injection than {{a variety of other}} benzodiazepines. The study tested and compared the abuse liability of temazepam, triazolam, diazepam, lorazepam, oxazepam, flurazepam, alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam, nitrazepam, flunitrazepam, bromazepam, and clorazepate. The study tested self-injection rates on human, baboon, and rat subjects. All test subjects consistently showed a strong preference for temazepam and triazolam over <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> benzodiazepines included in the study.|$|E
25|$|In Aleppo, Syria this custom {{seems to}} go back about 500 years. Most of the {{community}} would arise at 3:00AM to sing Baqashot and {{to listen to the}} voices of the Hazanim, Paytanim, and Meshorerim. When they arrived at Mizmor Shir LeYom HaShabbat they would break to listen to a sermon by one of the Rabbis who discussed the Parashah of the week. When he concluded they would begin Mizmor Shir LeYom HaShabbat and sing <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Baqashot.|$|E

25|$|At {{the next}} {{intersection}} west along Clinton, Henry Johnson Boulevard, US 9 leaves Clinton Avenue for the latter. The district continues {{to follow the}} Clinton property lines to Lexington Avenue, where it includes the houses along the west side to midway between First and Second streets, and short rows along either side of First Street west of the Lexington intersection. From there the district returns to Clinton <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way to Quail, including 2 Judson Street only because it fronts on Clinton and {{is part of a}} row in that area.|$|E
25|$|The Federal Reserve allowed {{some large}} public bank {{failures}} – particularly {{that of the}} New York Bank of United States – which produced panic and widespread runs on local banks, and the Federal Reserve sat idly by while banks collapsed. He claimed that, if the Fed had provided emergency lending to these key banks, or simply bought government bonds {{on the open market}} to provide liquidity and increase the quantity of money after the key banks fell, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> banks would not have fallen after the large ones did, and the money supply would not have fallen as far and as fast as it did.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} the lack on news was that on 22 July the weather was foggy and Blenden Hall had drifted on to the rocks at Inaccessible Island. Two seamen drowned trying to swim to shore. However <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crew and {{passengers}} on Blenden Hall made it to shore safely. Once there, they were marooned for four months. They subsisted on birds, birds' eggs, and seal meat. On 19 October six men sailed for Tristan da Cunha on a boat or raft that the survivors had constructed; this party was never heard from again. The survivors constructed a second boat that with three men aboard reached Tristan da Cunha on 8 November. Two boats set out from the island and rescued {{the remainder of the}} survivors.|$|E

25|$|The Dutch {{army was}} divided into four groups. The first group, the vanguard, led by Commisaris Jan Thysen, was to attack the bastion of Conception. The center, {{commanded}} by Minne Williemsz Caertekoe, was to attack the Bastion of Santiago and the curtain between Conception and Santiago. The rearguard, commanded by Opperkoopmen Simon de Wit, was to follow up the storming once a breach had been made. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> troops, carpenters, support troops and two Kandyan units, which had arrived, formed the reserve force and occupied the high ground where the battery was mounted. They were commanded by Fiscal Gerard Herbers, the former Dutch commander of the fort at Trincomalee. Preparations were made rapidly and {{in support of the}} land troops the Dutch brought in many sailors and ladders from the fleet ships.|$|E
25|$|Hayes' {{solution}} to the problem was to use a small microcontroller to implement a system that examined the data flowing into the modem from the host computer, watching for certain command strings. This allowed commands to be sent to and from the modem using the same data pins as <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> data, meaning it would work on any system that could support even the most basic modems. The Smartmodem could pick up the phone, dial numbers, and hang up again, all without any operator intervention. The Smartmodem was not necessary for BBS use but made overall operation dramatically simpler. It also improved usability for the caller, as most terminal software allowed different phone numbers to be stored and dialed on command, allowing the user to easily connect to a series of systems.|$|E
25|$|At this point, {{the toilet}} parts without their molds look like and {{are about as}} strong as soft clay. After about one hour the top core mold (interior of toilet) is removed. The rim mold bottom (which {{includes}} a place to mount the holding tank) is removed, and it then has appropriate slanted holes for the rinsing jets cut, and the mounting holes for tank and seat are punched into the rim piece. Valve holes for rapid water entry into the toilet are cut into the rim pieces. The exposed top of the bowl piece is then covered with a thick slip and the still-uncured rim is attached {{on top of the}} bowl so that the bowl and hollow rim are now a single piece. The bowl plus rim is then inverted, and the toilet bowl is set upside down on the top rim mold to hold the pieces together as they dry. Later, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mold pieces are removed. As the clay body dries further it hardens more and continues to shrink. After a few hours, the casting is self-supporting, and is called greenware.|$|E

25|$|In 1992, Batiuk {{changed the}} strip's format. It was {{established}} that Funky, Les, Cindy and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous cast {{had graduated from}} Westview in 1988; their college years were skipped, and the story continued in their adulthood. Subsequently, the characters started to age in real time and undergo significant life changes. Funky married Cindy in 1998; they are now divorced. Les and Lisa married in a Halloween-themed 1996 story which saw them dressed as Batman and Robin. Funky now co-owned the local pizza parlor with Tony Montoni, Les taught English at Westview, Crazy Harry was the local mailman, Bull was the Scapegoats' coach, and Cindy was a national-level television newscaster. The strip followed their stories {{as well as those}} of a new generation at Westview, including Wally, Becky, Darin and Monroe. Overtly whimsical elements were now downplayed in favor of more grounded real-life incidents and stories, and some of the series' running gags from the 1972–92 years were recast in a more serious light. For instance, Bull's hectoring of Les became the focus of a storyline on domestic violence and child abuse when it was revealed that Bull abused Les to cope with being abused by his own father.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the elders}} of the village did not approve and did nothing to help her, Lillinonah nursed the {{stricken}} Englishman through <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> long, cold winter, seldom leaving his side. As spring came to the encampment of the Pootatucks, he was well {{along the road to}} recovery, thanks to the care of his attentive nurse and the good medicine which she had provided. With the blossoming of the mountain laurel {{on the banks of the}} Housatonic, love, too, bloomed in the house of Lillinonah. As the beautiful daughter of Waramaug gazed with undisguised affection into the eyes of the man whose life she had saved, she saw that he returned her adoration with unaffected ardor. When summer came, the two young lovers finally decided that they must go to Chief Waramaug, for a love as deep as theirs must be consummated by marriage. The great sachem's reaction, however, was as they both expected: he was very angry. With all the eligible Indian suitors for miles around still beating a path to her door, how dare Lillinonah ask for his blessing on a union with a white man, an unknown stranger whose culture was so different from her own? Was it not true that the paleface despised the Indians, regarding them as little better than the savage beasts of the forest? No, said Waramaug, never would he sanction Lillinonah's marriage to such a man.|$|E

500|$|Unlike many games, where {{different}} songs {{have different}} themes for each character or area, Wintory chose to base {{all of the}} pieces on one theme which stood for the player and their journey, with cello solos especially representing the player. Wintory describes the music as [...] "like a big cello concerto where you are the soloist and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> instruments represent the world around you", though he describes it as not necessarily orchestral due to the inclusion of electronic aspects. The cello begins the game as [...] "immersed {{in a sea of}} electronic sound", before first emerging on its own and then merging into a full orchestra, mirroring the player's journey to the mountain. While the game's art style is based on several different cultures, Wintory tried to remove any overt cultural influences from the music to make it [...] "as universal and culture-less as possible". Tina Guo features as the cellist for the soundtrack. She is a close friend of Wintory and has since performed [...] "Woven Variations" [...] with him, an eight-minute orchestral variation on the Journey soundtrack. All of the non-electronic instruments in the soundtrack were recorded with a live orchestra.|$|E
