25|$|The {{most common}} tree species in this park are Hopea sp., Sumbaviopsis albicans, Garcinia fragraeoides, Burretionendron hsienmu, Chukrasia tabularis, Photinia aroboreum and Dysospyros saletti. Seedlings can only grow in holes and {{cracks in the}} {{limestone}} where soil has accumulated, so in general regeneration after disturbance is slow. The forest type in this national park is dominated by evergreen tree species with scattered deciduous trees such as Dipterocarpus kerri, Anogeissus <b>acuminate,</b> Pometia pinnata and Lagerstroemia calyculata. In this park, the dominant plant families are the Lauraceae, Fagacaeae, Theaceae and Rosaceae, with some scattered gymnosperms such as Podocarpus imbricatus, Podocarpus neriifolius, and Nageia fleuryi.|$|E
25|$|Growing to {{a height}} of up to , the Cornish Elm is a slender, slow-growing {{deciduous}} tree, distinguished by its long, straight trunk, which culminates in a narrow fan-shaped crown comprising short, straight, ascending branches. The leaves are small, obovate to oval, typically <b>acuminate</b> at the apex, 6cm long by 3.5cm broad, with a dark-green upper surface, glossy and smooth. The perfect apetalous wind-pollinated flowers occur in clusters of 1520 on very short pedicels. The samarae rarely ripened in England, but when mature were {{very similar to those}} of others in the Field Elm group, being mostly obovate, 16mm long by 10mm broad.|$|E

60|$|Var. chelonophilus (Pl. III, fig. 2 c). Terga, minute, nearly straight, solid, <b>acuminated</b> at both ends, placed far {{distant from}} the other valves: carina, either minute and <b>acuminated</b> at both ends, or {{moderately}} developed and slightly arched and blunt at both ends: lateral lobes of the scuta broad: valves imperfectly calcified.|$|R
25|$|Three {{types of}} leaves with differing {{morphology}} are present: cauline leaves, or those that {{appear on the}} stem {{from the middle of}} the plant upwards; basal leaves, or those that are present at the base of the plant; and distal leaves, which are those found on the extremities of the plant. All types are thin and sharply serrated with 6 to 15 pointed teeth per side. They are ciliate, meaning they have small hairy projections emerging from the margins of the leaf, while the apices, or tips of the leaves, are <b>acuminate,</b> meaning they taper to a point. The adaxial (i.e. upper) surfaces of the leaves are nearly hairless or sparsely hairy, while the abaxial (i.e. lower) surfaces are sparsely hairy with the veins being more villous, or covered in shaggy hairs.|$|E
25|$|Hybodonts are {{generally}} described and identified based on {{size and shape}} of teeth and fin spine fossils. Hybodonts are recognized as having teeth with a prominent cusp which is higher than lateral cusplets. Species of hybodonts are often determined based on their teeth fossils which {{are more likely to be}} preserved the rock record than the remainder of the sharks’ skeleton. Teeth are abundant in the fossil record because sharks shed them throughout their lifetime and teeth are resistant to erosion. Hybodont teeth are often preserved as incomplete fossils because the base of the tooth is not well attached to the crown. Hybodonts were initially divided into two groups based on their tooth shape. One group had teeth with <b>acuminate</b> cusps that lacked a pulp cavity; these are called osteodont teeth. The other group had a different cusp arrangement and had a pulp cavity, these are called orthodont teeth. For example, the hybodont species Heterophychodus steinmanni have osteodont teeth with vascular canals of dentine which are arranged vertically parallel to each other, also called ‘tubular dentine’. The crowns of these osteodont teeth are covered with a single layer of enameloid.|$|E
