40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{transformation}} of ethanol into acetonitrile. Two approaches are investigated: (a) the ammoxidation of ethanol to acetonitrile and (b) the amination of ethanol to acetonitrile. The reaction of ethanol ammoxidation to acetonitrile has been studied using several catalytic systems, such as vanadyl pyrophosphate, supported vanadium oxide, multimetal molibdates and <b>antimonates.</b> The main conclusions are: (I) The surface acidity must be very low, because acidity catalyzes several undesired reactions, such as the formation of ethylene, and of heavy compounds as well. (II) Supported vanadium oxide is the catalyst showing the best catalytic behaviour, but {{the role of the}} support is of crucial importance. (III) Both metal molybdates and <b>antimonates</b> show interesting catalytic behaviour, but are poorly active, and probably require harder conditions than those used with the V oxide-based catalysts. (IV) One key point in the reaction network is the rate of reaction between acetaldehyde (the first intermediate) and ammonia, compared to the parallel rates of acetaldehyde transformation into by-products (CO, CO 2, HCN, heavy compounds). Concerning the non-oxidative process, two possible strategies are investigated: (a) the ethanol ammonolysis to ethylamine coupled with ethylamine dehydrogenation, and (b) the direct non-reductive amination of ethanol to acetonitrile. Despite the good results obtained in each single step, the former reaction does not lead to good results in terms of yield to acetonitrile. The direct amination can be catalyzed with good acetonitrile yield over catalyst based on supported metal oxides. Strategies aimed at limiting catalyst deactivation have also been investigated. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} {{a series of}} {{fragments}} of Egyptian unguentaria are characterized from the chemical and physical point of view. The analysed samples were produced in {{the first step of}} the Egyptian glass production, during the new Kingdom of Egypt. The glass production in Egypt started under Thumosis III kingdom and developed until it reached its maximum during the kingdom of Amenhotep III (XVIII dinasty, 1390 - 1352 BC.) e Amenhotep IV/Akhenaton (XVIII dinasty, 1352 - 1338 BC). In this period, different glass shapes and typologies appears, and also the variety of decorations and colours increased. The analysed samples pertain to six vessels (amphoriskoi and krateriskoi) coming from Thebes area and now stored at the Egyptian Museum of Turin (Italy) after the excavation carried out at the Valley of the Queens. All these vessels, are blue with yellow, white and turquoise decorations and were produced with the core forming technique. The chemical analyses of major and minor elements were performed by Electron Microprobe (EMPA). The nature of the opacifying and colouring agents was determined by X-ray powder diffraction. Since only micro volumes were sampled from the artefacts (less than 1 mm 3), the diffraction experiments were successfully carried out using a single crystal diffractometer equipped with a CCD camera. The chemical data obtained show that all the samples contain high levels of Na 2 O. However, along with a number of glass containing rather high level of both MgO and K 2 O - thus classified as plant ash based glass - some of them show rather low levels of K 2 O along with high MgO percentages. Most of these low-potassium high-magnesium samples are Al- rich Co-bearing blue glass: this seems to indicate they were probably coloured with the addition of Co-bearing alum. This is also consistent with the high level of MnO present in these samples. This situation suggests the use of two different kinds of flux for the production of these glass: an organic source (for the production of most of yellow, white and turquoise glass) and an inorganic one (leading to lower levels of K and Mg) used for the production of the Co-bearing samples. Yellow opaque decorations are rich in Pb and Sb, while only Sb is present in the white and light blue ones. This is consistent with the results of the X-ray powder diffraction analyses, that confirmed the presence of lead <b>antimonates</b> in the yellow decorations and of calcium <b>antimonates</b> in white and light blue ones.

The most seriousdifficulty in developing this study was that any sampling –even micro-sampling – was absolutely forbidden.

Measurement of the antimony content of meglumine <b>antimonate</b> powder indicated a 1 : 1. 37 molar ratio of antimony to N-methyl-d-glucamine. Osmolality measurements performed with meglumine <b>antimonate</b> solutions demonstrated an average of 1. 43 antimony atoms per molecule of meglumine <b>antimonate.</b> The osmolality of a 1 : 10 dilution of stock meglumine <b>antimonate</b> increased by 45 % over 8 days, suggesting hydrolysis to less complex species. A comparison of the proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of N-methyl-d-glucamine and meglumine <b>antimonate</b> revealed an increase in complexity in the latter but with all of the resonances of the former still being evident, consistent with the presence of coordination complexes between antimony and each of the N-methyl-d-glucamine hydroxyls.

30|$|Geologically, {{orpiment}} (As 2 S 3) and realgar (As 4 S 4) occur together, and {{are often}} associated with <b>antimonates</b> and other sulphides [1, 30]. Orpiment and realgar were highly appreciated especially in Egypt and China for their rich yellow and red–orange shades [1, 170 – 174], even though the pigments were considered “unpleasant” by many artists, and not recommended to use in combination with copper and lead based pigments, such as verdigris and leadwhite [1, 30, 170]. Orpiment and realgar exist as minerals, as well as synthetic pigments [175], and of the two arsenic sulphide pigments, {{the first one is}} the most stable. Realgar, being unstable, was less often reported in works of art [1, 176 – 179]. It has a polymorphic photodegradation product, pararealgar As 4 S 4. Permanence of arsenic sulphide pigments is problematic, especially on exposure to the green region of the visible spectrum [174, 180]. Moreover, smaller particles are more readily degraded [174]. The sensitivity to green light has {{to be taken into account}} when lasers need to be used, such as during Raman spectroscopic analysis [177, 181, 182]. Arsenates (As 5 +) are formed from orpiment, realgar and emerald green degradation: these ions are water soluble and migrate throughout the whole painting, accumulating at interfaces between layers, around Fe/Mn rich particles, and according to the local pH conditions in the paint layer. Due to this water-based transport, appropriate cleaning solvents must be selected, and relative humidity controlled [180, 183]. It seems that polysaccharidic media, or egg yolk, negatively affect the stability of the arsenic sulphide pigments [184].|$|R
