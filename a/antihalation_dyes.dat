50|$|In some cases, pink or blue colors {{appear in}} some sheet films. This {{is caused by}} <b>antihalation</b> <b>dyes,</b> which are {{normally}} colorless and incorporated into the gelatin layer. When acetic acid is formed during deterioration, the acidic environment causes the dyes {{to return to their}} original pink or blue color.|$|E
40|$|This {{project was}} to design and operate an {{infrared}} scanning densitometer to monitor {{the growth of the}} characteristic curve of a film during development. An aparatus was constructed which enabled us to pass repeatedly, a sensitometric strip through a beam of radiation during development. This radiation was focused on the film plane of the development container. The spot on the film plane was relayed, after transmission through the sample, to a photomultiplier tube. The response of the tube was displayed an oscilloscope and this was photographed. We were able to obtain a trace of the characteristic curve of a fully processed snesitometric strip in the above manner. However, we were unable to obtain the characteristic curve of a test strip during development even with the <b>antihalation</b> <b>dyes</b> removed. We believe that if more time were available we would go to radiation of higher Intensity and longer wavelength, with an appropriate change in photomultiplier tube. It is our opinion that with these changes we would have had success...|$|E
