Surgery was performed with the patient under brachial plexus anesthesia in the prone decubitus position with a perineural catheter for postoperative pain control and to facilitate physiotherapy. We performed a neurological check a few hours post-op, {{between the end of}} brachial plexus anesthesia and the start of anesthetic drug inflow via catheter. A padded tourniquet was used and the arm was supported in an <b>arm</b> <b>holder.</b> In cases with flexion contracture of the elbow of < 110 °, an open ulnar nerve neurolysis was performed in order to avoid postsurgical nerve apraxia. We first addressed the posterior aspect of the elbow through posterior portals. Adhesions in the subtricipital space and in the olecranon fossa were broken down with an oscillating shaver, and osteophytes (of the humerus and olecranon) were removed with a high-speed burr. After the posterior joint had been treated, the anterior joint was addressed through anteromedial and anterolateral portals. Through these, a shaver was used to develop the space between the anterior humerus and the anterior elbow capsule. Debridement of medial and lateral gutters, contracture, and chondral problems with the radial head were treated. Osseous components, osteophytes, and ectopic bone (of the coronoid and humerus) were removed using an oscillating shaver or a high-speed burr, maintaining capsule integrity. Finally, an anterior capsulotomy was performed with a duckbill punch. Note that {{it is very important to}} completely remove the dissected anterior capsule (capsulectomy) with an oscillating soft-tissue shaver in order to avoid contracture recurrence.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background A {{screening}} of ulnar collateral ligament insufficiency {{is required for}} overhead throwers, since secondary pathologic changes result from an increased elbow valgus laxity. We developed a new manual method for assessing elbow valgus laxity and investigated the reliability of this method and its correlation with ultrasonographic assessment. Methods We defined elbow valgus laxity as {{the difference between the}} shoulder external rotation angle (ER angle) measured with the elbow in 90 degrees flexion and that measured with the elbow in extension because ER angle measured with the elbow in 90 degrees flexion includes elbow valgus laxity and ER angle with the elbow in extension does not include it. ER angle measurement with the elbow in extension involved the use of a custom <b>arm</b> <b>holder.</b> Three examiners each measured elbow valgus laxity by the new method in 5 healthy volunteers. Intraobserver and interobserver reliability was evaluated by calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient. We then assessed 19 high-school baseball players with no complaints of shoulder or elbow pain. Elbow ultrasonography was performed with a 10 -MHz linear transducer with the elbow in 90 degrees flexion, and the forearm in the neutral position, and the width of the medial joint space {{at the level of the}} anterior bundle was measured. Elbow valgus laxity assessed by ultrasonography was defined as the difference between the medial joint space width with gravity stress and that without gravity stress. Increased elbow valgus laxity assessed by both our method and ultrasonography was defined as the difference between the laxity of the elbow on the throwing side and that on the contralateral side. Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) was calculated to evaluate the relationship between increased elbow valgus laxity obtained by our manual method and that by ultrasonography. Results Intraobserver reliability ranged from 0. 92 to 0. 98, and interobserver reliability was 0. 70. The increased elbow valgus laxity assessed by our method was significantly correlated with that assessed by ultrasonographic assessment (P = 0. 019, r = 0. 53). Conclusions Elbow valgus laxity can be assessed by our method. This method may be useful for screening for insufficiency of the ulnar collateral ligament. </p...|$|E
40|$|Manipulation of {{hand-held}} {{objects in}} 3 D space {{is a complex}} task. Understanding how individual digits interact with a hand-held object provides helpful information for hand tool designers, researchers, clinicians, and occupational therapists. At the object-digit interface, the contact mechanics can be represented by three force and three torque components. Six-component force/torque transducers can register all the three forces and three torques at the digit-object interface, and therefore are advantageous {{in the study of}} manipulation mechanics. The large number of force and torque signals from multiple force/torque transducers are difficult to interpret and therefore making experimental research of manipulation a challenging task. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop a 3 D visualization tool for the investigation of the contact mechanics at the object-digit interfaces during manipulation tasks. Methods A 3 D stick-figure hand model was created based on digitized 23 anatomical landmarks of the hand. Five miniature 6 -component force/torque transducers (4 Nano 17 for the fingers, 1 Mini 40 for the thumb, ATI Industrial Automation, NC) were used to record force and torque data at the tips of individual digits. Thirty channels of force/torque signals from the transducers were collected by a 16 -bit analogue-digital converter (PCI- 6031, National Instrument, Austin, TX) installed in a computer. The transducers were mounted on a custom-made rectangular aluminum handle for object manipulation. Coordinate frames were established at each transducer, on the handle, and at the base of the MicroScribe digitizer. To visualize the force vectors at the digit-tips, the coordinates of the hand landmarks in the MicroScribe coordinate frame and the force vectors in local transducer coordinate frames were transformed to a common coordinate frame defined on the handle. One healthy right-handed, male subject participated in the experimental study. During the tests, the participant sat in a chair by a testing table. The forearm was strapped to an <b>arm</b> <b>holder</b> in neutral rotation position. The instrumented handle was fixed on the testing table by a C-clamp through an adapting plate. With the hand of the subject gripped on the instrumental handle, the landmarks of the instrumented handle and the transducers, as well as the anatomical landmarks of the hand were digitized using the MicroScribe digitizer for the purpose of coordinate frame establishment and transformation as described above.

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the determinants of}} households choice between fixed rate (FRM) and adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) contracts, using the Bank of Italy s Survey of Household Income and Wealth. Contrary to the predictions of the theoretical literature, the analysis shows that most household characteristics proxying for exposure to other (non-mortgagerelated) risks and for individual risk aversion are irrelevant for the choice. This, in turn, crucially depends on the relative price of the mortgages and on whether the household is liquidity constrained. Liquidity constrained households find ARMs particularly attractive because their initial payments are generally lowest, ceteris paribus. This is so despite some evidence that the premium that lenders charge over their cost of funds is substantially higher on ARMs than on FRMs. Taken together, {{the evidence suggests that}} <b>ARM</b> <b>holders</b> do not fully take into account the risk of a rise of the reference interest rates. On the other hand, lenders price quite expensively this risk and borrowers end up paying a high price for the benefit of low initial payments. pozzolo@unimol. i...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three empirical contributions to the applied microeconomics literature. The first chapter studies the impact of property taxes on property values. The unexpected introduction of a new fiscal regime on property taxes adopted by the Italian government in December 2011 within the austerity plan to face the sovereign debt crisis provides an ideal empirical setting to study whether changes in property taxes are capitalized into house prices. We exploit variation in tax rates across municipalities as {{the intensity of the}} treatment and address the endogeneity problem by exploiting differences in proximity to the municipal elections. Municipalities that did not have elections in 2013 set a tax rate about 0. 1 percentage points higher and recorded a reduction in average property values about 6 % higher than the others. The effect is attributable to the relative higher property tax rate and provides evidence in favor of the capitalization hypothesis. The second chapter studies the impact of monetary policy on households' consumption via the income effect arising from changes in mortgage payments. Using the 2008 - 2014 Italian Survey of Household Income and Wealth, the analysis shows that the drop in interest rates following the Great Recession was associated with a reduction in mortgage payments of households with Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARM), but had no effect on households with Fixed Rate Mortgages (FRM). After the shock, consumption of <b>ARM</b> <b>holders</b> increases relative to FRM, but the implied Marginal Propensity to Consume is not statistically different from zero. The chapter suggests two explanations for the weak consumption response to the income shock. First, the shock is partly offset by a reduction in income from financial assets owned by mortgagors. Second, over one third of mortgagors believed that the income shock was transitory, thereby implying a small effect on consumption. The last chapter shows that there is substantial geographical variation in the use of cesarean sections in Italy. Such variation is not driven by medical need and higher cesarean rates are achieved by performing the procedure on less and less appropriate patients. I find evidence that high-use areas develop higher ability in performing cesareans. Finally, by using both panel data analysis and instrumental variables, I show that there is no significant relation between risk-adjusted cesarean rates and maternal and neonatal mortality. The combined evidence in this chapter suggests that lowering cesarean rates would likely affect less appropriate patients and would not affect neonatal nor maternal mortality...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{self-assembly}} of a dendritic macromolecular system formed by a second-generation dendron with pH-responsive end groups {{and with a}} polymer chain emanating from its focal point, typically referred to as dendron-coil system. We use supramolecular ionic interactions to attach to {{the periphery of the}} dendrons sulfate-terminated alkyl tails of various lengths. The resulting ionic complexes have a molecular architecture similar to a four-arm dendritic pitchfork with varying <b>arms</b> and <b>holder</b> lengths. The bulk morphologies observed by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) show thermodynamically stable, hierarchical “inverted” hexagonal or lamellar structures. In addition, for a specific range of volume fractions, we show order-to-order transitions associated with the melting of the crystalline alkyl tails. The structural models for the molecular packing emerging from TEM and SAXS analysis are benchmarked to available self-consistent field theories (SCFTs) developed for identical systems and experiments and theoretical predictions are found in perfect agreement. With respect to our previous work on inverted dendron and dendrimer-surfactant self-assembled morphologies (Mezzenga et al. Soft Matter. 2009, 5, 92 − 97), the present findings show that keeping the same dendritic molecular architecture but adding a polymer chain emanating from the focal point enables the scale up of the structural organization from the liquid crystalline length scale (100 nm) to the block copolymer length scale (101 nm) while preserving the inverted unconventional morphologies. Because the length of the <b>holder</b> and the <b>arms</b> of the dendritic pitchfork can be finely tuned, these systems offer new possibilities in the design of nanostructured organic materials and their use in templating applications...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the force generated by two different removal devices used to retrieve cemented crowns on implant abutments. The influence of six different operators was evaluated. Material and methods: Three replicated Coronaflex((R)) (Kaltenbach & Voigt GmbH, KaVo Dental GmbH) and reverse hammer setups were tested. The experimental setup has employed a screw bearing a diametral hole through which a loop holder passed. The screw was attached to a force transducer (Bruel & Kjaer, type 8201), and the loop <b>holder</b> <b>arm</b> was kept perpendicular to the transducer axis. The results were statistically evaluated with ANOVA. Results: The operator has resulted to play significant influence with reference to reverse hammer (coefficient of variation 43. 3 %) rather than with Coronaflex((R)) (9. 8 %). Evaluating every single operator, more variation can still be found by considering each reverse hammer (37. 5 %) rather than each Coronaflex((R)) (8. 8 %).

40|$|Abstract: The use of {{conventional}} surgical tool holders requires an assistant during positioning and adjustment {{due to the}} lack of weight compensation. In this paper, we introduce a robotic arm system with hands-on control approach. The robot incorporates a force sensor at the end effector which realises tool weight compensation as well as hands-on manipulation. On the operating table, the required workspace can be tight due to a number of instruments required. There are situations where the surgical tool is at the desired location but the <b>holder</b> <b>arm</b> pose is not ideal due to space constraints or obstacles. Although the arm is a non-redundant robot because of the limited degrees of freedom, the pseudo-null-space inverse kinematics can be used to constrain a particular joint of the robot to a specific angle while the other joints compensate in order to minimise the tool movement. This allows operator to adjust the arm configuration conveniently together with the weight compensation. Experimental results demonstrated that our robotic arm can maintain the tool position during reconfiguration significantly more stably than a conventional one...|$|R

40|$|The {{transmission}} {{electron microscope}} (TEM) {{has been an important}} characterization tool since its invention in 1932. [1] The ability to achieve atomic resolution imaging and collect real-time movies, combined with the availability of electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) within the same instrument, make the TEM an indispensable tool for the study of dry solid samples. [1, 2] The use of a nanofluidic system (NFS) extends the applications of TEM to include wet solid, liquid, and gaseous samples, opening up a world of possibilities for the direct study of solution or gas phase reactions, dynamics of particles in liquids, cellular structure in its natural state, and more. [3] In this project, I led the development of a complete NFS for TEM of wet samples and flowing liquid samples. The system consists of a nanofluidic cell to enclose the sample, and a sample <b>holder</b> <b>arm</b> which allows flow of liquid {{into and out of the}} TEM. Unlike the typical commercial NFSs available, this system will feature true, controlled liquid flow. The design of the fluidic cell is distinct from other existing designs, and is supported by both the results of flow simulations and experiments performed with larger analogous fluidic cells. All microfabrication was performed by myself and another lab member (Ariel Petruk) in the University of Waterloo's Quantum NanoFab. The sample holder was designed in collaboration with Hitachi High Technologies Canada (HTC), who provided feedback on dimensions to ensure compatibility with Hitachi electron microscopes (EMs) and manufactured the prototype holder. The completed NFS will soon be used in our lab to perform a variety of in-liquid TEM and electron diffraction studies, and will be commercialized by HTC. The immediate goal of this project is to prove that the NFS works as anticipated: initial experiments will include nanoparticle (NP) uptake in E. coli, using flow conditions to maximize the lifespan of the bacteria in the nanofluidic cell. The study of living (or recently-living) biological cells has the potential to reveal information which cannot be obtained by studying fixated cells. A longer term goal is to use the NFS to study the structure and NP uptake behaviour of brain tumour initiation cells (BTICs); this research would involve collaboration with Dr. Shelia Sing at McMaster University, and would require modification of the electron source of our scanning {{transmission electron microscope}} (STEM), which is outside the scope of this thesis. Other future work will include the incorporation of fast mixing and electrochemical functionality in the nanofluidic cell...|$|R
