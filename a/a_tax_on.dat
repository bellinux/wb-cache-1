5|$|The {{primary source}} of direct tax revenue was individuals, who paid a poll tax and <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> their land, {{construed}} as <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> its produce or productive capacity. Supplemental forms could be filed by those eligible for certain exemptions; for example, Egyptian farmers could register fields as fallow and tax-exempt depending on flood patterns of the Nile. Tax obligations were determined by the census, which required each head of household {{to appear before the}} presiding official and provide a head count of his household, as well as an accounting of property he owned that was suitable for agriculture or habitation.|$|E
5|$|Two of Daniels' other tax {{proposals}} were approved: <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> liquor and beverages {{to fund the}} construction of the Lucas Oil Stadium and <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> rental cars to expand the Indiana Convention Center. The new source of funding resulted in a state take-over of a project initially started by the City of Indianapolis and led to a bitter feud between Daniels and the city leadership over who should have ownership of the project. The state ultimately won and took ownership of the facilities from the city.|$|E
5|$|After its {{victory in}} the Seven Years' War (1756–1763), the British Empire was deeply in debt. Looking for new sources of revenue, the British Parliament sought, for the first time, to {{directly}} tax the colonies, beginning with the Sugar Act of 1764. The earlier Molasses Act of 1733, <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> shipments from the West Indies, had produced hardly any revenue because it was widely bypassed by smuggling, which {{was seen as a}} victimless crime.|$|E

5000|$|Robert Kohn {{responded to}} this article in [...] "The Limitations of Pigouvian <b>Taxes</b> as <b>a</b> Long-Run Remedy for Externalities: Comment," [...] saying that <b>a</b> Pigovian <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> {{pollution}} emissions can, in fact, create the long-run social optimum without a lump-sum tax-subsidy. Carlton and Loury responded the same month, clarifying that they were discussing <b>a</b> Pigovian <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> output; whereas, Kohn was discussing <b>a</b> Pigovian <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> emissions. Carlton and Loury provide numerical proofs as to why these are different. Ultimately, they argue {{that there are some}} cases in which <b>a</b> single <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> emissions will produce the LRSO and others in which <b>a</b> single <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> output will attain the LRSO. Either case only works with the taxes properly determined.|$|R

5|$|Strong {{partisan}} disagreement in Congress prevented {{adjustments to}} the Act's provisions. However, at least one change, a proposed repeal of <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> medical devices, has received bipartisan support. Some Congressional Republicans argued against improvements to the law on the grounds they would weaken the arguments for repeal.|$|E
5|$|During {{the primary}} campaign, two major issues surfaced. First, Waterfield favored <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> parimutuel betting, while Clements opposed it. Second, Waterfield {{supported}} {{the development of}} electric power generation through public utilities, while Clements favored private development (which won him {{the support of the}} Kentucky Utilities company). The Clements campaign also attacked Waterfield for being deemed physically unfit for military service. Clements received a late boost when he gained the endorsement of John Y. Brown, Sr., garnering added support from organized labor. Ultimately, Clements defeated Waterfield by over 30,000 votes.|$|E

5|$|The {{measures}} of taxation in {{the reign of}} Augustus were determined by population census, with fixed quotas for each province. Citizens of Rome and Italy paid indirect taxes, while direct taxes were exacted from the provinces. Indirect <b>taxes</b> included <b>a</b> 4% <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> the price of slaves, <b>a</b> 1% <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> goods sold at auction, and <b>a</b> 5% <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> the inheritance of estates valued at over 100,000 sesterces by persons other than the next of kin.|$|R
5|$|Final Fantasy XI has {{a largely}} player-based economy, {{with a heavy}} {{reliance}} on auction houses {{in each of the}} major cities of Vana'diel. There are certain economic controls in place mainly in the form of fees for putting items up for auction. Transportation, auction house, item storage, and fees do not go to players; these gil sinks effectively remove money from the economy to prevent inflation. The city of Jeuno used to levy <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> bazaar purchases inside the city, but it was removed in a patch in the December 2008 version update.|$|E
5|$|In 1817, Sharp {{was again}} {{elected to the}} Kentucky House of Representatives. During his term, he {{supported}} measures for internal improvements, but opposed {{the creation of a}} state health board and a proposal to open the state's vacant lands to the widows and orphans of soldiers killed in the War of 1812. Most notably, he supported the creation of 46 new banks in the state, and proposed <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> the branches of the Bank of the United States in Lexington and Louisville.|$|E
5|$|Prime Minister Kevin Rudd {{suffered}} {{a decline in}} his personal ratings, and a perceived loss of support among his own MPs, following {{the failure of the}} Government's insulation program, controversy regarding the implementation of <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> mining, the failure of the government to secure passage of its carbon trading scheme and some policy debate about immigration policy. Significant disaffection had arisen within the Labor Party as to the leadership style and direction of Rudd. On 23 June 2010 he announced that Gillard had asked him to hold a leadership ballot the following day to determine the leadership of the Labor Party, and hence the Prime Ministership of Australia.|$|E

5|$|The Regency period saw a {{shift in}} fashion that was largely {{determined}} by George. After political opponents put <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> wig powder, he abandoned wearing a powdered wig in favour of natural hair. He wore darker colours than had been previously fashionable as they helped to disguise his size, favoured pantaloons and trousers over knee breeches because they were looser, and popularised a high collar with neck cloth because it hid his double chin. His visit to Scotland in 1822 led to the revival, if not the creation, of Scottish tartan dress {{as it is known}} today.|$|E
5|$|The {{house at}} Burton Pynsent was built section by section {{over the period}} of many years. Construction was {{commenced}} by Marmaduke Jennings in approximately 1565 and was continued by the Jennings family throughout the 17th century. In 1679 the house passed to Sir William Pynsent, who had married into the family. Pynsent's son bequeathed the house to his political idol, William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham, despite never meeting him. His intention was to disinherit Lord North, a relative of his wife, who had supported <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> Somerset cider which Pynsent disagreed with, and which Pitt had blocked. Pynsent died in 1765 and his relatives were unhappy at being left just 1,000 guineas each, and so unsuccessfully contested the will over the following six years.|$|E
5|$|City {{officials}} announced on August 6 that Mayor de Blasio would push for <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> wealthy New York City residents {{to help pay}} for necessary improvements in the subway. The proposal would tax New York City residents that make more than $500,000 and for married couples with incomes above $1 million. The proposal would raise between $700 million to $800 million, with $250 of it going for half-priced MetroCards for 800,000 riders at or below the poverty line, a shift from de Blasio's previous stance. To go into effect, {{it would have to be}} approved by the New York State Legislature. This proposal was criticized by Governor Cuomo and MTA Chairman Joe Lhota for not providing money soon enough, the State Legislature does not go back into session until January 2018.|$|E

5|$|Edward {{took the}} crusader's cross in an {{elaborate}} ceremony on 24June 1268, {{with his brother}} Edmund and cousin Henry of Almain. Among others who committed themselves to the Ninth Crusade were Edward's former adversaries – like the Earl of Gloucester, though de Clare did not ultimately participate. With the country pacified, the greatest impediment to the project was providing sufficient finances. King LouisIX of France, who {{was the leader of}} the crusade, provided a loan of about £17,500. This, however, was not enough; the rest had to be raised through <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> the laity, which had not been levied since 1237. In May 1270, Parliament granted a tax of a twentieth, in exchange for which the King agreed to reconfirm Magna Carta, and to impose restrictions on Jewish money lending. On 20August Edward sailed from Dover for France. Historians have not determined the size of the force with any certainty, but Edward probably brought with him around 225knights and altogether fewer than 1000men.|$|E
5|$|Hancock {{emerged as}} a leading {{political}} figure in Boston just as tensions with Great Britain were increasing. In March 1765, he was elected as one of Boston's five selectmen, an office previously held by his uncle for many years. Soon after, Parliament passed the 1765 Stamp Act, <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> legal documents, such as wills, that had been levied in Britain for many years but which was wildly unpopular in the colonies, producing riots and organized resistance. Hancock initially took a moderate position: as a loyal British subject, {{he thought that the}} colonists should submit to the act, even though he believed that Parliament was misguided. Within a few months, Hancock had changed his mind, although he continued to disapprove of violence and the intimidation of royal officials by mobs. Hancock joined the resistance to the Stamp Act by participating in a boycott of British goods, which made him popular in Boston. After Bostonians learned of the impending repeal of the Stamp Act, Hancock was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in May 1766.|$|E
5|$|In 1198 and 1199, William was Sheriff of Devon and Sheriff of Cornwall, {{along with}} another royal servant, {{and served as a}} royal justice. In 1200 he was {{recorded}} as a receiver of the carucage, <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> land, in the Pipe roll; whether this meant that he was a local or a national collector of the tax is unclear. By 12 September 1204, William was Archdeacon of Taunton in the Diocese of Bath, and he witnessed the election of Jocelin of Wells as the new bishop of the diocese. He was jointly placed in charge of the mints of London and Canterbury in 1205, along with Reginald de Cornhill, with whom he also shared the collection of the tax of a fifteenth on merchants, a post the two had held since 1202. In May 1205 William, along with de Cornhill, was given custody of one of three dies for the mint at Chichester; in July the king gave William's custody to Simon of Wells, the Bishop of Chichester. William was one of the officials in charge of the collection of a tax of a thirteenth in 1207.|$|E

5|$|The {{price of}} slaves varied in {{accordance}} with their ability. Xenophon valued a Laurion miner at 180 drachmas; while a workman at major works was paid one drachma per day. Demosthenes' father's cutlers were valued at 500 to 600 drachmas each. Price was also a function of the quantity of slaves available; in the 4th century BC they were abundant and it was thus a buyer's market. <b>A</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> sale revenues was levied by the market cities. For instance, a large helot market was organized during the festivities at the temple of Apollo at Actium. The Acarnanian League, which {{was in charge of the}} logistics, received half of the tax proceeds, the other half going to the city of Anactorion, of which Actium was a part. Buyers enjoyed a guarantee against latent defects; the transaction could be invalidated if the bought slave turned out to be crippled and the buyer had not been warned about it.|$|E
5|$|In October 1200 Geoffrey {{refused to}} allow the {{collection}} of carucage, <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> land, on his property, and his lands were confiscated in retaliation. He then excommunicated the new sheriff of Yorkshire, James of Poterne, who had ravaged Geoffrey's lands in revenge. In November 1200, Geoffrey and John were reconciled at Hugh of Lincoln's funeral, which allowed Geoffrey to regain his confiscated estates, but the archbishop's continued refusal to allow the collection of carucage led to the truce falling apart. In January 1201, John made peace with his half brother, {{but it did not}} last, as Geoffrey continued to refuse to allow the tax to be collected. John then renewed the demand for the payment for the office of sheriff due from Richard's reign, which forced Geoffrey to rescind his excommunication and offer another payment in return for peace, which occurred in May 1201. But it was short-lived; disputes over the appointments in the diocese of York broke out, but with the support of Pope Innocent Geoffrey was able to secure the appointment of a few of his own candidates. Geoffrey also quarrelled with some of the monasteries in his diocese, with the usual claims and counterclaims going to the papacy for judgement. Among the religious houses Geoffrey had disagreements with were Guisborough Priory, Meaux Abbey, and Fountains Abbey. Most of these conflicts arose from disputed appointments to offices, but the quarrel with Meaux involved claims of tithe exemption by that house.|$|E
5|$|In Pennsylvania, washed-out {{rail lines}} {{prevented}} operation along the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad for several weeks, and lines reopened after about two months. The expense of reopening, {{and the loss}} of being closed, led to the railroad merging with the Erie Railroad to become the Erie Lackawanna Railway in 1960. One stranded train along the line prompted a helicopter to rescue 235people. Flooding along the Lehigh River destroyed 15industrial plants, which left more than 15,000people near Allentown, Pennsylvania without work temporarily. The mayor of Scranton {{declared a state of emergency}} due to the floods, ordering all businesses to close. United States Army soldiers provided water to residents after the town lost its water supply. Elsewhere, the Pennsylvania National Guard was on duty on streets in damaged towns, including 50 to prevent looting in Upper Black Eddy, which was one of the hardest hit towns. Helicopters assisted in discovering bodies at Camp Davis, where many deaths occurred during the storm. Statewide, thousands of people were left homeless. In Stroudsburg, there was a food shortage, and officials enacted a curfew, after reports of looting. In the same city, water was shipped in milk cartons to the flood victims, which later inspired a Federal Civil Defense Administration proposal to use water packaged in milk containers in the event of a nuclear attack. The state government implemented <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> cigarettes to help pay for storm damage, which lasted for about two years; this was partially due to a lack of significant funding from the federal government. Pennsylvania also enacted an increase in the gasoline tax that was later made permanent to pay for the Interstate Highway System. The two taxes, each an increase of 1penny, totaled $71million, a part of which was set aside for future disasters. The experience of the storm's aftermath provided the basis for the aftermath for Hurricane Agnes in 1972. In New Jersey, Governor Robert B. Meyner declared the floods as at the time the state's worst natural disaster.|$|E
