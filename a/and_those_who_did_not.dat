5|$|Parrish demanded high {{standards}} of performance of his men and did not view race as an issue. Parrish felt that what mattered was professionalism and an individual's capacities, techniques, and judgement.

5|$|Ten men {{received}} {{votes on}} the first vice-presidential ballot. Mississippi's John A. Quitman had the most support with 59 votes. Eight state delegations – {{with a total of}} 55 votes – voted for Breckinridge in spite of his refusal of the nomination, making him the second-highest vote getter. Kentucky cast its 12 votes for Boyd, bringing his third-place total to 33 votes. Seeing Breckinridge's strength on the first ballot, large numbers of delegates voted for him on the second ballot, <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> soon saw that his nomination was inevitable and changed their votes to make it unanimous.|$|E

5|$|CTW {{solicited}} the Educational Testing Service (ETS) {{to conduct}} its summative research. CTW and ETS hired and trained coordinators, testers, and observers from local communities to conduct these studies. The most relevant {{tests of the}} show's effectiveness were comparisons between children who watched it regularly <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not.</b> After the first season, however, Sesame Street was so widely watched {{that it was difficult}} to make this distinction; ETS began to have problems finding subjects for their non-viewing groups, which weakened the experimental design. It solved this problem by selecting control-group households from areas that did not broadcast the show. Instead of using groups of viewers and non-viewers, later large-scale studies used statistical designs and methods for estimating cause-effect relationships.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, the National Cancer Institute {{undertook}} a large study, using cancer case {{information from the}} Institute's SEER database. The published findings from the study revealed {{that there was no}} increased incidence of cancer in persons who may have received vaccine containing SV40. Another large study in Sweden examined cancer rates of 700,000 individuals who had received potentially contaminated polio vaccine as late as 1957; the study again revealed no increased cancer incidence between persons who received polio vaccines containing SV40 <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not.</b> The question of whether SV40 causes cancer in humans remains controversial however, and the development of improved assays for detection of SV40 in human tissues will be needed to resolve the controversy.|$|E
5|$|A Season Pass {{available}} to Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 users granted {{access to the}} Flashpoint Skin Pack, featuring alternate skins for Aquaman, Deathstroke, and Wonder Woman, along with the first four downloadable characters at an overall discounted price. To prevent conflicts between online players who purchased DLC <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not,</b> free compatibility packs containing additional character skins were released alongside them. On April 17, 2013, Lobo was officially revealed as the first DLC character during the Injustice Battle Arena finale. Lobo was released on May 7, 2013. On May 3, 2013, Batgirl was revealed as the second DLC character, becoming available for download on May 21, 2013. Scorpion, a recurring character from the Mortal Kombat series, was revealed as the third DLC character on June 3, 2013, and became available for download on June 11, 2013. Scorpion's appearance in Injustice featured a new costume design by comic book artist Jim Lee. The final character in the Season Pass, General Zod, was revealed on June 12, 2013 on an episode of the late-night talk show Conan. Zod was released on July 2, 2013. S.T.A.R. Labs missions {{for the first four}} DLC characters were also released as part of the Season Pass. The four DLC characters became available for Wii U owners on July 3, 2013.|$|E

5|$|People {{may simply}} like most {{what they see}} most. Letters that appear more {{frequently}} in everyday usage also occur more often in people's names. Forer, in 1940, and Alluisi and Adams, in 1962, found {{a positive correlation between}} the frequency of occurrence of letters and phonemes and how attractive they were judged to be. Zajonc extended these studies, using foreign symbols and controlling the number of exposures. This led him to formulate the mere-exposure hypothesis: the more you see something, the more you like it. Nuttin's original study showed that mere exposure can not be the cause of the name-letter effect, as letters with equal frequency were evaluated differently by people who had the letter in their names <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not.</b> He also found that whereas the letter B is of low frequency in French and the letter Q of medium frequency, in experiments with French speakers the B was among the most highly liked letters and the Q was among the least liked. Similarly, in Polish the Y is a medium frequency letter, yet was still among the least preferred letters. In each of the languages, the least frequent letters were over-represented in the set of least preferred letters, whereas the most preferred letters were rarely the highest frequency letters. The exposure counts in the lab studies done by Zajonc (20 to 25 times) were minuscule compared to real-life observation counts of any letter, which also caused Nuttin to cast doubt on whether Zajonc's theory could hold true in the real world.|$|E

25|$|The game {{received}} mixed {{views from}} critics.

Critics were divided as to aspects of gameplay.

50|$|The {{concept of}} the digital divide is a gap between <b>those</b> <b>who</b> have access to digital {{technologies}} <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not. Access {{may be associated with}} age, gender, socio-economic status, education, income, ethnicity, and geography.|$|R

25|$|Still others {{suggest that}} the two groups are related but not identical, and that {{differences}} between them were exacerbated by Europeans, or by a gradual, natural split, as those who owned cattle became known as Tutsi <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> became Hutu. Mahmood Mamdani states that the Belgian colonial power designated people as Tutsi or Hutu {{on the basis of}} cattle ownership, physical measurements and church records.|$|E
25|$|After the Spanish {{victory in}} San Juan against Great Britain {{in what is}} known as the Battle of San Juan of 1797, Governor de Castro became {{suspicious}} of all English-speaking European foreigners, mistakenly believing that they supported the anti-Spanish military campaigns of the British and ordered some of the local residents and foreigners, especially those of English and Irish descent, to be placed under surveillance. Many were given eight days to leave the island <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> leave were imprisoned.|$|E
25|$|This comment has {{traditionally}} caused commentators {{to conclude that}} Luke was a Gentile. If this were true, it would make Luke the only writer of the New Testament who can clearly be identified as not being Jewish. However, {{that is not the}} only possibility. Although Luke is considered likely to be a Gentile Christian, some scholars believe him to be a Hellenized Jew. The phrase could just as easily be used to differentiate between those Christians who strictly observed the rituals of Judaism <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not.</b>|$|E

25|$|Many of the {{officers}} and enlisted men of the other units escaped the city before it surrendered and accompanied Lovell's regular Confederate units to Camp Moore. When General Benjamin Butler arrived in New Orleans, {{the officers}} and men taken as prisoners of war, paroled, <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> take the oath to the United States, were exchanged on the 8th of October, and then being delivered to Confederate officials at Vicksburg. While the majority took the oath, {{a number of the}} men who were paroled and exchanged, re-enlisted in Louisiana units on active duty in the Vicksburg area.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} ego {{depletion}} {{do not appear}} to be a product of mood or arousal. In most studies, mood and arousal has not been found to differ between participants who exerted self-control <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not.</b> Likewise, mood and arousal was not related to final self-control performance. The same is true for more specific mood items, such as frustration, irritation, annoyance, boredom, or interest as well. Feedback about success and failure of the self-control efforts does not appear to affect performance. In short, the decline in self-control performance after exerting self-control appears to be directly related to the amount of self-control exerted and cannot be easily explained by other, well-established psychological processes.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the first}} and {{principal}} objectives of the revolutionary regime was the adoption of a standard national writing system. Shortly after coming to power, Barre introduced the Somali language (Af Soomaali) as the official language of education, and selected the modified Latin script developed by the Somali linguist Shire Jama Ahmed as the nation's standard orthography. From then on, all education in government schools had to be conducted in Somali, and in 1972, all government employees were ordered to learn to read and write Somali within six months. The reason given for this was to decrease a growing rift between those who spoke the colonial languages, <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not,</b> as many of the high ranking positions in the former government were given to people who spoke either Italian or English.|$|E
