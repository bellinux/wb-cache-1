In this thesis, A programming model for workflow specification and a {{workflow management}} system architecture are proposed. The proposed model incorporates a nested transaction model that allows better control on failure recovery. In our model, Sub-transactions {{can be controlled}} by different <b>autonomous</b> <b>transaction</b> managers. Effects of committed sub-transactions and successfully completed non-transactional activities can be recovered by using compensation based semantic recovery techniques.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{feasibility}} of <b>autonomous</b> <b>transaction</b> execution in systems with asynchronous transaction processing based on epsilon serializability (ESR). The abstract correctness criteria defined by ESR are implemented by techniques such as asynchronous divergence control and asynchronous consistency restoration. Concrete application examples in a distributed environment, such as banking, illustrate the advantages of using ESR to support execution autonomy. The ability for asynchronous transaction processing also supports efficient concurrent transaction and query processing. 1 Introduction A key assumption made by techniques that provide global recovery and concurrency atomicity distributed databases such as R [19], is that system components want to cooperate in providing global transaction properties. However, there are many areas (e. g., performance and availability) where participation in a classic distributed transaction will infringe on a local transaction system's capabilitie [...] ...|$|E

30|$|Although {{significant}} {{progress has been}} made in demand response, there are outstanding barriers to overcome to further its performance. In addition, the power grids are undergoing a transformative change that requires demand response to adapt. Transactive energy has been proposed as a promising solution that goes beyond demand response. It is expected to maintain the dynamic balance of supply and demand by enabling real-time, decentralized, automated, and <b>autonomous</b> <b>transactions</b> among distributed generation and load resources. In this emerging field, much research is needed. One can identify the value proposition of transactive energy, design the mechanics of how it should function, develop enabling platforms, and derive strategies for individual participants.|$|R

40|$|The {{algorithmic}} trading comes from digitalisation of {{the processing of}} trading assets on financial markets. Since 1980 the computerization {{of the stock market}} offers real time processing of financial information.

40|$|Decentralized {{workflow}} management systems (WFMSs) provide an architecture for multiple, heterogeneous WFMSs to interoperate. Atomicity {{is a standard}} correctness model for guaranteeing that a set of operations occurs as an atomic unit, or none of them occur at all. Within a single WFMS, atomicity is the concern of its transaction manager. In a decentralized environment, however, the <b>autonomous</b> <b>transaction</b> managers must find ways to cooperate if an atomic unit is split between multiple WFMSs. This paper describes a flexible atomicity model that enables workflow administrators to specify the scope of multi-site atomicity based upon the desired semantics of multi-site tasks in the decentralized WFMS.

40|$|An insider-robust {{approach}} to file integrity verification is developed using interacting strata of mobile agents. Previous approaches relied upon monolithic architectures, or more recently, agent frameworks using a centralized control mechanism or common reporting repository. However, any such distinct tampering-point introduces vulnerabilities, especially from knowledgeable insiders capable of abusing security-critical resources. In the Collaborative Object Notification Framework for Insider Defense using <b>Autonomous</b> Network <b>Transactions</b> (CONFIDANT), the mechanisms for tampering detection, decision-making, and alert signaling are distributed and corroborated by autonomous agents. In this paper, the CONFIDANT file integrity verification framework is presented focusing on insider defense aspects. User capability classes are defined and critical physical tampering points in intrusion detection architectures are identified. CONFIDANT mitigation techniques of insider tampering exposures and example scenarios are presented...|$|R
40|$|Significant {{performance}} advantages can {{be realized}} by implementing a database system on a shared memory multiprocessor. An efficient implementation of a lock manager {{is a prerequisite for}} efficient transaction processing in multiprocessor database systems. To this end, we advocate adopting an autonomous locking strategy. In <b>autonomous</b> locking, <b>transactions</b> acquire and release locks via operations on shared memory, in contrast to conventional locking where communication with a lock manager is involved. We demonstrate the superior performance and scalability of autonomous locking through benchmarks of a prototype lock manager implemented on a large scale shared memory multiprocessor. For instance, when contention is high (i. e., for hot lock operations), the performance of autonomous locking is nearly an order of magnitude better than conventional locking. The paper also addresses issues related to recovery (assuming independent node failures). 1 Partially supported by the National Scie [...] ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractÐA {{heterogeneous}} distributed {{database environment}} integrates {{a set of}} autonomous database systems to provide global database functions. A flexible transaction approach has been proposed for the heterogeneous distributed database environments. In such an environment, flexible transactions can increase the failure resilience of global transactions by allowing alternate (but in some sense equivalent) executions to be attempted when a local database system fails or some subtransactions of the global transaction abort. In this paper, we study the impact of compensation, retry, and switching to alternative executions on global concurrency control for the execution of flexible transactions. We propose a new concurrency control criterion for the execution of flexible and local transactions, termed F-serializability, in the error-prone heterogeneous distributed database environments. We then present a scheduling protocol that ensures F-serializability on global schedules. We also demonstrate that this scheduler avoids unnecessary aborts and compensation.

40|$|This {{research}} paper discusses how minimised government {{interference in the}} operation of commercial letters of credit can actually improve their development as they are regulated by the Uniform Customs and Practice of Documentary Credits (UCP 600). Government interference takes shape in foreign exchange control legislation, which does impede both payment and financing. Illegality attaches where the credit fails to meet legal requirements at place of payment or performance. Illegality is an established exception to the principle of autonomy under UCP 600. Exceptions to the independence of the credit are necessary to safeguard against abuse. Illegality should not be extended to include government control as it distorts the operation of the credit. Illegality should be interpreted narrowly to include only parties to the agreement. Letters of credit are popular payment methods due to the security they offer and they are an <b>autonomous</b> <b>transaction.</b> Various negative implications arise where illegality is raised as a result of foreign exchange control; parties may attempt to defeat such illegality even through unlawful means. The research tracks the historical development of the standardisation of the commercial credit vis-a-vis common law. It is argued that the introduction of UCP has contributed little to the common law as UCP is not drafted in legal terms as it is intended as a code of practice for banks. It does not cover crucial legal consequences, rights and obligations. In the interests of trade facilitation WTO member states should review current exchange control regimes in their jurisdictions, to allow for free flow and uniform trade financing...|$|E
40|$|To achieve better {{scalability}} in a fully replicated distributed main-memory database, {{we propose}} support for virtual full replication [6]. Full replication {{is often used}} to improve availability and predictability in distributed real-time applications. In a fully replicated database all updates are sent to all nodes regardless of where the data is going to be used there or not. In a fully replicated database with asynchronous replication, availability and predictability is improved at the cost of consistency. By allowing relaxed consistency and avoiding synchronous replication, a number of predictability problems connected to synchronization are avoided, such as distributed locking of objects and reliance on stable communication during transaction execution. Since nodes are <b>autonomous</b> during <b>transaction</b> execution, {{there is no need for}} full connectivity between nodes at all times. This system scales better, since nodes allow both simultaneous queries and simultaneous updates for different object replicas, without a distributed lock mechanism that involves communication between nodes where object replicas are allocated. This also improves availability even further, although it requires conflict detection and resolution of concurrent updates...|$|R
40|$|Since the mid- 1990 s, Austria {{and many}} other industrialized {{countries}} have experienced massive growth in their external asset and liability positions. However, Austria's high degree of real economic integration due to its position as a small, open economy only partly explains this development. <b>Autonomous</b> financial <b>transactions,</b> effected independently of external trade financing from a profit motive, are increasingly determining cross-border movements of capital. Legal measures adopted {{in the run-up to}} Austria's accession to the EU (e. g. the full liberalization of the Austrian financial sector) favored this development, as did the country's participation in Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). In terms of the rate of internationalization, Austria has as high a degree of financial integration as Finland and Sweden. However, it lags well behind Switzerland or the Netherlands in this respect. In terms of GDP, foreign equity holdings are on a far smaller scale in Austria than in these countries. Austrian securities investors prefer foreign debt investments.

40|$|Research on {{alliance}} formation {{has focused}} {{to a large}} extent on resource complementarity between large, established incumbents and innovative start-ups as the main driver of collaboration, without contrasting the alliance option with <b>autonomous</b> production. <b>Transaction</b> cost economics, on the other hand, has examined the transaction-level determinants of the choice between internalization and externalization, ignoring {{for the most part the}} cooperative alternative. Building on these two literatures, we focus, in this paper, on firm-level factors that lead incumbents to choose between developing, manufacturing and commercializing a new product independently and doing it in cooperation with other incumbents. This focus leads us to emphasize resource additivity (i. e. scale) as one of the main drivers of the governance choice and thus view cooperation as a result of resource needs rather than resource availability. Our model not only takes into consideration the attractiveness of cooperation for accessing resources and reaching a critical mass, but also its costs and risks which cooperation experience reduces. Findings from a sample of 186 new products in the worldwide aircraft industry confirm our hypotheses, showing that aircraft manufacturers are more likely to form scale alliances rather than to autonomously undertake a new aircraft project when their resourc...|$|R

40|$|Transaction {{management}} for federated database systems (FDBSs), where each participating DBMS is <b>autonomous,</b> supports global <b>transactions</b> that can access {{more than one}} database. A number of concurrency control algorithms exist for the failure-free environment. Handling transaction failure, due to concurrency control or site related reasons, becomes especially difficult {{in the presence of}} autonomy. Due to local autonomy, carrying out 2 -phase commit may not be possible. This can be simulated by providing a server on top of the pre-existing DBMS at each site, which is responsible for submitting the local operations to the associated DBMS and communicating with the transaction's originating site. In this paper we formalize the problem of ensuring transaction consistency in an FDBS environment in the presence of failure. The key problem is that due to autonomy, the local DBMS and FDBS may have different views of an execution sequence generated at a site. Local recoverability is identified as [...] ...|$|R

This framework should include easy to integrate patterns. The proposed just-in-time framework can change the information system's architecture and its implementation outcomes. The atomic information system architecture's role and applied the patterns are of crucial importance for the implementation phase of the complex business transformation projects; where these patterns can be adapted in a just-in-time manner, using atomic building blocks 1, 2, 26. There is also a need to govern (or control) the atomic information system architecture's patterns for business transformation projects; unfortunately an adaptable atomic information system architecture pattern for such projects is inexistent. An atomic information system architecture pattern can be also used in the enterprise's production activities which comes after the finalization of the implementation phase of business transformation project (business transformation project), to control and govern the resultant business system.
