5|$|The {{change to}} Best in Show was {{considered}} by the press to be of little significance and was not promoted by Charles Cruft, and did not require <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> <b>to</b> have won its Best of Breed class until 1936. It did however remove restrictions on entry, which remained until the mid-1960s when entry to Crufts was restricted to dogs who had already become a champion by gaining championship points at other dog shows.|$|E

50|$|Coren defines {{three aspects}} of dog {{intelligence}} in the book: instinctive intelligence, adaptive intelligence, and working and obedience intelligence. Instinctive intelligence refers <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog's</b> ability <b>to</b> perform the tasks it was bred for, such as herding, pointing, fetching, guarding, or supplying companionship. Adaptive intelligence refers <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog's</b> ability <b>to</b> solve problems on its own. Working and obedience intelligence refers <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog's</b> ability <b>to</b> learn from humans.|$|R

5|$|The Mahabharata, {{the great}} Hindu epic, narrates: a dog, {{with the help}} of a Rishi (sage) assumes various animal forms - {{starting}} from <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> <b>to</b> a tiger then to an elephant followed by a lion and a sharabha - terrorized every one in the hermitage of the Rishi. Eventually, Sharabha assumed a further fiercer form. In this fierce form he wanted to devour the Rishi. The Rishi then narrating the process of change in Sharabha’s development, as a result of his benevolence, cursed Sharabha to go back to his original form of a dog. The epic does not relate Shiva to Sharabha.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1870s, {{the only}} {{requirement}} for <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> <b>to</b> be classed as a Cocker Spaniel {{was that it}} needed to weigh less than , although breeders separated the cocker from the King Charles Spaniel which remains a smaller breed of spaniel. This maximum weight limit remained on the Cocker Spaniel until 1900, with larger dogs being classed as Springer Spaniels. The colors of the Devonshire and Welsh Cockers were described by John Henry Walsh under the pseudonym Stonehenge in his book The Dog in Health and Disease as being a deeper shade of liver {{than that of the}} Sussex Spaniel. Following the formation of The Kennel Club in the UK in 1873, efforts were made by breeders to record the pedigrees of cockers and springers. In 1892, English Cocker Spaniels and English Springer Spaniels were recognized as separate breeds by The Kennel Club.|$|E
5|$|In Katherine Buetow's {{guide to}} the Australian Cattle Dog, Ian Dunbar {{makes the point that}} while people think of dog {{training}} as teaching <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> <b>to</b> sit, speak and roll over, the dog already knows how to do these things. Training, he says, involves teaching the dog that {{it is a good idea}} to do these things when a particular word is said or signal is given. He goes on to explain his belief that training is about opening communication channels, so that the dog knows what the handler wants it to do, and knows that it will be worth its while to do it. Consequences for the dog can be rewards for doing what is required, as recommended by Dunbar, or corrections where an unwanted behaviour is performed. Like other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is intelligent and responsive; both of these traits can be an advantage in training where a structured, varied program is used, but can lead to unwanted outcomes if training is not consistent, or is repetitive and boring for the dog. Stock dog trainer Scott Lithgow recommends making training a game so the Cattle Dog learns that obedience leads to enjoyment. Many of a Cattle Dog's natural behaviours are undesirable in a pet: barking, chewing, chasing, digging, defending territory, and nipping heels. Training, therefore, involves helping the dog adopt a lifestyle that is probably very different from that of its droving ancestors. The Australian Cattle Dog is biddable, and responds well to training.|$|E

25|$|As an {{alternative}} or complement to weight-bearing exercise and medication, canine hydrotherapy may speed recovery after operations or slow {{the progression of}} degenerative conditions.

25|$|Raw bones fed to dogs contain high {{amounts of}} calcium and {{phosphorus}} {{that is essential}} for neuromuscular, cardiovascular, immune, endocrine and clotting function. The ratio of calcium to phosphorus for adult dogs should be 1:1. Compared to commercial dog food, the raw food diet allows dogs to work for their meal, ripping the meat off bones and then gnawing at the bones. In regards to dental health, bone to tooth gnawing allows <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> <b>to</b> rid their teeth of plaque buildup promoting good oral health. Skeptics argue however that this isn't healthy for dogs and it can cause dental fractures.|$|E

25|$|Dog treats given {{excessively}} {{can be a}} {{cause of}} obesity. The type of food fed has a direct bearing on the tendency of <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> <b>to</b> become overweight. Table scraps, treats, even premium high-energy dog foods can contribute to obesity. Therefore, it is highly important to closely monitor the quantity of treats that a dog gets especially when the dog's activity is diminished. Dog treats {{are more likely to}} be linked to obesity in old dogs, since in their old age they are less likely to be active and exercising. On the other hand, active dogs require and use more calories, so dog treats are not a cause of concern in younger and highly active dogs.|$|E
