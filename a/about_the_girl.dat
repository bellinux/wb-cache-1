A debate on the senate floor culminates with a female senator queefing almost exact lines of {{dialogue}} from The Road Warrior film. The next day, the newspapers announce that, partly due to the senator's stunt the previous day, the queefing ban has passed. As Stan and his father Randy celebrate, Sharon and Shelley are hurt and insulted by the decision, describing it as an example of sexism that still pervades society, and finally sarcastically congratulate the men for [...] "getting their own way... again." [...] Stan and Randy finally understand the issue was not simply about queefing, but a larger point about women's rights. The two get all the South Park men together and record an inspirational song called [...] "Queef Free", declaring women {{should have the right to}} queef, while photographs of women working various careers are displayed on a television screen. Terrance and Philip, despite a continued disgust with the constant queefing, attempt to marry the two Queef Sisters.

2500|$|Barry Walters from Rolling Stone {{criticized the}} album's theme, calling it [...] "bubble-brained", writing that they [...] "give Aguilera little {{substance}} to spin into gold." [...] Robert Christgau stated the album [...] "was avoidance-like LeAnn and unlike Britney, Christina already has 'adult' grit and phrasing down pat, and so threatens to join Gloria, Mariah, Celine, and LeAnn {{herself in the}} endless parade of Diane Warren-fueled divas-by-fiat hitting high notes and signifying less than nothing." [...] Julene Snyder of Sonicnet wrote that [...] "Aguilera has an instinctive grasp of the insipid state of the pop/ dance music scene, especially {{as it relates to}} her peers." [...] On behalf of PopMatters, Nikki Tranter said [...] "there are lots of 'oohs' and plenty of 'ahhs' and just enough 'I wants' and 'you likes' to keep the kids happy." [...] Partridge deemed the project [...] "quite listenable"; however, he said the lyrics [...] "tell us precious little <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> on the cover." ...|$|E

He went to Paris and Rome and [...] "he saunter'd Europe round,/ And gather'd ev'ry Vice on Christian ground" [...] (B IV 311–312). At the end of his travels, he is [...] "perfectly well bred,/ With nothing but a Solo in his head" [...] (323–4), and he has returned to England with a despoiled nun following him. She is pregnant with his child (or the student's) and destined for the life of a prostitute (a kept woman), and the lord is going to run for Parliament so that he can avoid arrest. Dulness welcomes the three—the devious student, the brainless lord, and the spoiled nun—and spreads her own cloak <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>girl,</b> which [...] "frees from sense of Shame." ...|$|E

Ben replies by saying that he wants a divorce, and Phyllis assumes the request is due to his love for Sally. Ben denies this, but still wants Phyllis out.
