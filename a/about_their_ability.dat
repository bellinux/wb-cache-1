5|$|Although {{built in}} {{response}} to Gloire, the Warriors had a very different operational concept from the French ship, which was meant to replace wooden ships of the line. The Warriors were designed by Watts as 40-gun armoured frigates and were not intended {{to stand in the}} line of battle, as the Admiralty was uncertain <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to withstand concentrated fire from wooden two- and three-deck ships of the line. Unlike Gloire, they were planned to be fast enough to force battle on a fleeing enemy and to control the range at which a battle was fought to their own advantage. In contrast to Gloires square profile, Warrior has a clipper bow, but she is twice as long as a typical clipper ship.|$|E
5|$|In a {{range of}} studies, {{participants}} have been requested to answer general knowledge questions, each of which had two possible answers, and also to estimate their chances of answering each question correctly. If the participants had a sufficient degree of self-knowledge, their level of confidence in regard to each answer they gave would be high for the questions they answered correctly and lower for the ones they answered wrong. However, this generally is not the case. Many people are overconfident; indeed, studies show that most people systematically overestimate their own abilities. Moreover, people are overconfident <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to answer questions that are deemed to be hard but underconfident on questions that are considered easy.|$|E

25|$|The Soviets {{had been}} working on early warning radar for their anti-ballistic missile systems through the 1960s, but most of these had been {{line-of-sight}} systems that were useful for raid analysis and interception only. None of these systems had the capability to provide early warning of a launch, within seconds or minutes of a launch, which would give the defences time to study the attack and plan a response. At the time, the Soviet early-warning satellite network was not well developed, and there were questions <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to operate in a hostile environment including anti-satellite efforts. An over-the-horizon radar sited in the USSR would not have any of these problems, and work on such a system for this associated role started in the late 1960s.|$|E

The naval architect and historian David K.

[...] They were designed in response to Gloire, which started an invasion scare in Britain, but they had a very different concept of operation to the French ship which was meant as a replacement for wooden ships of the line.

500|$|The double {{burden is}} usually {{view as a}} primary problem for single women or married women. However, it is often less {{recognized}} that men can and often do {{go through the same}} trials and hard times as a parent trying to balance work and the family. Within the book The Canadian Family in Crisis, Conway addresses this issue with an argument from Eichler. Eichler says, [...] "Social science fails to understand men" [...] by tending [...] "to downplay or ignore a potential conflict between work and home for men." [...] Married men can avoid the full impact of the double burden, but single fathers are totally incapable of avoiding the double burden of family and work. Though single fathers face the same number of problems that single mothers face, they have two advantages that play in their favor. Men usually have a higher income and have a shorter time of being single than women. However, until they are remarried or have a woman to help them out around the house, men still must deal with the sexual and emotional frustration as a woman does. They must deal with the balancing of work, childcare, and domestic responsibilities. Single fathers are usually doubtful <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> be a parent, and they are challenged psychologically. [...] "The problems faced by the working single father are more than merely the logistical problems shared by all working parents. He has to change the way he feels about himself as man." [...] A man being a single parent and feelings the effects of the double burden can and will interfere with his career just as it does with a single mother that has a career. A study showed that five percent of single fathers were fired form their jobs due to the double burden and another eight percent quit because the double burden became too much of a burden for them to balance both work and the family. With that being said, single fathers feel the same, if not more, of the effect of the double burden as women do.|$|E

40|$|When agents {{can learn}} <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>abilities</b> as active investors, they rationally "trade to learn" {{even if they}} expect to lose from active investing. The model used to develop this insight draws {{conclusions}} {{that are consistent with}} empirical study of household trading behavior: Households' portfolios underperform passive investments; their trading intensity depends on past performance; and they begin by trading small sums of money. Using household data from Finland, the article estimates a structural model of learning and trading. The estimated model shows that investors trade to learn even if they are pessimistic <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>abilities</b> as traders. It also demonstrates that realized returns are significantly downward-biased measures of investors' true abilities. The Author 2011.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{implications}} of workers' mistaken beliefs <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>abilities</b> on incentives in organisations.

The article provides conditions under which an agent's overestimation about his own ability is favourable to the principal when effort is unobservable.

2500|$|In {{order to}} evade this {{psychological}} obstacle, the new poet must convince himself that previous poets have gone wrong somewhere and failed in their vision, thus leaving {{open the possibility}} that he may have something to add to the tradition after all. The new poet's love for his heroes turns into antagonism towards them: [...] "Initial love for the precursor's poetry is transformed rapidly enough into revisionary strife, without which individuation is not possible." [...] The book that followed Yeats, The Anxiety of Influence, which Bloom had started writing in 1967, drew upon the example of Walter Jackson Bate's The Burden of the Past and The English Poet and recast in systematic psychoanalytic form Bate's historicized account of the despair felt by seventeenth- and eighteenth-century poets <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to match the achievements of their predecessors. Bloom attempted to trace the psychological process by which a poet broke free from his precursors to achieve his own poetic vision. He drew a sharp distinction between [...] "strong poets" [...] who perform [...] "strong misreadings" [...] of their precursors, and [...] "weak poets" [...] who simply repeat the ideas of their precursors as though following a kind of doctrine. He described this process in terms of a sequence of [...] "revisionary ratios," [...] through which each strong poet passes {{in the course of his}} career.|$|E

Butters speaks with a mild stutter and tends to fidget with his hands. The other characters perceive him as [...] "nerdy", and he obliviously maintains a wholesome attitude and mild disposition despite the tragedy and abuse that he frequently encounters.

Stone describes him as embodying [...] "permanent innocence". [...] Butters, however, sees himself as a problem child because his parents tell him so and often expresses remorse at being [...] "out-of-control". Exceptions to this include the episode [...] "The Ungroundable", in which Butters makes his parents worry <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to ground him when he refuses to be punished. This rebellious behavior begins after he joins the vampire kids at his school, but ends when he helps the Goth kids burn down a Hot Topic store. He is also known for being gullible, quickly believing anything told to him by others and tending to do whatever he is told to do with little protest, no matter how ridiculous these things seem to be. As such, he is always made an unknowing accomplice in Cartman's various devious schemes. There are cases, however, where Butters has shown a darker side, such as in episodes like [...] "The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs" [...] and [...] "Butterballs"; in the latter of which he viciously assaulted Dr. Oz and verbally castigated his abusive grandmother.|$|E
