5|$|The newer M5000 trams {{proved to}} be {{considerably}} more reliable than the T-68/A fleet; which averaged 5,000 miles between breakdowns, while the M5000's averaged 20,000 miles. This led to a decision in 2012 to withdraw the entire fleet from service <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> M5000's. All of the T-68 and T-68As were withdrawn between April 2012 and April 2014.|$|E

5|$|In 1989 Capuano ran {{for mayor}} {{a third time}} in and won. Capuano served as mayor from 1990 to 1999, where he earned a {{reputation}} as a hands-on administrator. One of his priorities was to lower the city's population density, which at time was the highest of any New England municipality, by using state grants to demolish several buildings <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> playgrounds and parking spaces. As mayor, Capuano oversaw the reduction of school class sizes to a maximum of 19 students.|$|E
5|$|Likewise, in Middle English {{and early}} modern Scottish evidence, while still {{appearing}} as causes of harm and danger, elves appear clearly as human-like beings. They became associated with medieval chivalric romance traditions of fairies and {{particularly with the}} idea of a Fairy Queen. A propensity to seduce or rape people becomes increasingly prominent in the source material. Around the fifteenth century, evidence starts to appear for the belief that elves might steal human babies <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> changelings.|$|E

In October 2006, BA became involved in a civil rights dispute when a Christian employee was forbidden to wear a necklace bearing the cross, a religious symbol. BA's practice of forbidding such symbols has been publicly questioned by British politicians such as the former Home Secretary John Reid and the former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw.|$|E
5|$|Around 1995, the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) {{called a}} bidding {{to sell the}} property. The tender went to a Malaysian firm, the Renong Berhad and ITT-Sheraton combine over Emilio Yap, a Chinese Filipino billionaire tycoon {{and owner of the}} Manila Bulletin, the country's largest {{newspaper}} by circulation. Yap went to the Supreme Court of the Philippines and won by matching Rehong's bid and citing the Constitution's Filipino First policy in the ownership of a 'national patrimony'. Fifty one percent of the ownership was awarded to Yap's Manila Prince Hotel Corporation (MPHC), while new owners joined on April 25, 1997 as 49 percent shareholder. Yap signed a check for ₱673.2 million and the MPHC took over the property on May 7, 1997. One of the first things Yap did was to pull down the three brass chandeliers in the lobby, upon recommendation of a feng shui expert, <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> five.|$|E
5|$|During {{the final}} {{battle of the}} Renommée, Saint-Cricq in Clorinde had {{remained}} {{out of range of}} the British, refusing to support his commodore. When Renommée surrendered, he made all sail to the north, abandoning both Roquebert and Néréide in his attempt to escape. Although Clorinde was closely pursued by Astraea and Phoebe until 02:00 on 21 May, the damage they had suffered prevented them from gaining on the French ship and Clorinde eventually disappeared into the darkness. During the night Schomberg gathered Phoebe, Racehorse and Astraea, and rejoined Renommée at dawn on 21 May. A prize crew of seven men was sufficient to exercise control over the French frigate until Schomberg could remove most of the French crew <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> British sailors the following morning. Although Galatea was still within sight at dawn, Losack was unsure of the identity of the approaching squadron and decided to sail directly to Port Louis rather than risk combat with a superior enemy force.|$|E

They proceeded to plunder the towns and areas around the Sucro fort. In addition they removed the normal Roman military insignias <b>and</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> the insignia of fasces and axes (a symbol of death).|$|R
5|$|Keswick {{is in the}} lee of the Skiddaw group, {{the oldest}} group of rocks in the Lake District. These fells were formed during the Ordovician period, 488 to 443 million years ago; they form a {{triangle}} sheltering the town, reaching a maximum height of 931m on Skiddaw itself. To the west of Portinscale, to the south-west of the village of Thornthwaite, is Whinlatter Forest Park and Grisedale Pike. To the east, beyond Castlerigg stone circle, is St John's in the Vale, {{at the foot of the}} Helvellyn range, which is popular with ramblers starting from Keswick. In 2010, Electricity North West, United Utilities, the Lake District National Park Authority and the conservation charity Friends of the Lake District invested £100,000 to remove power lines <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> underground cables, to improve the quality of scenery in the vicinity.|$|E
5|$|On 10 June, the 7th Armoured Division {{took over}} parts of 50th Northumbrian Division front with the 56th Infantry Brigade under command. By nightfall, the 7th Armoured Division {{had reached the}} {{north-western}} fringe of Tilly-sur-Seulles and next day penetrated the village capturing the central crossroads. The Panzer-Lehr Division made several counter-attacks, which forced the British out and attacks by the 50th (Northumbrian) Division bogged down in the bocage against the Panzer-Lehr Division. Army Group B planned to relieve the armoured divisions facing the Second Army from 11 June <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> infantry divisions, to concentrate the tanks in the Carentan area and avert the danger to Cherbourg. Adolf Hitler overruled Rommel {{and the next day}} ordered him not to retreat and instead roll up the Allied beachhead from east to west, starting with the Orne bridgehead.|$|E
5|$|Since December 2013, a {{plan has}} been {{underway}} for the Halifax Regional School Board to close and demolish {{at least two of}} the three DMHS feeder schools, as well as DMHS itself, <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> a larger, more modern school in Sheet Harbour, that will serve grades primary-12. This new school will teach about 300 students and will serve the large area around Sheet Harbour. On 26 April 2016, the site for the project was chosen; the site that Duncan MacMillan High School currently occupies. A school steering team was established thereafter and cooperates with the design team for the new school, the Halifax Regional School Board and two government departments; the Department of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal and the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development for the design and planning phases.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 2000s the Caribous were {{becoming}} difficult to maintain, and {{were no longer}} capable of operating in war zones as they lacked electronic warfare systems {{and other forms of}} self-protection. As a result, it was decided in late 2008 to retire the aircraft <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> Beechcraft King Air 350s on an interim basis until another tactical transport entered service. The Caribous were gradually retired from May 2009, the last leaving service on 27 November that year when A4-140 was flown to Canberra and handed over to the Australian War Memorial for preservation. By the time the aircraft were retired, No. 38 Squadron had been operating Caribous for 45 years. Three King Air 350s were transferred to No. 38 Squadron from the Army's 173rd Surveillance Squadron on 20 November 2009, and deliveries of a further five newly built aircraft were completed in July 2010. At least one of the Army aircraft {{is believed to have been}} fitted with ground surveillance sensors, and this capacity was retained after it was transferred to the Air Force. No. 38 Squadron's King Airs were initially operated by Army personnel, who were given the choice of transferring to the RAAF or converting to helicopters at the end of their posting. The other No. 38 pilots were converted to the type at the Army's Oakey Army Aviation Centre, but the squadron began conducting its own conversion courses after the second batch of five aircraft were delivered.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 the Australian Government {{decided to}} retire the F-111s in 2010 <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II aircraft, {{which at the}} time were {{expected}} to be delivered from 2012. As a result of delays to the F-35 program, the government decided in early 2007 to re-equip both No.1 and No.6 Squadrons with Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornet aircraft on an interim basis. No.6 Squadron's F-111Gs were progressively retired {{over the next few months}} as they became due for major servicing, and the last aircraft of this type flew on 3 September. The final F-111 operational conversion course was completed in mid-2008, and all the remaining F-111Cs and RF-111Cs were transferred to No.6 Squadron in November 2008 when No.1 Squadron began the process of converting to F/A-18Fs. For the next two years the squadron operated as a bomber and reconnaissance unit. No.6 Squadron's F-111s were formally retired in a ceremony held at Amberley on 3 December 2010 and No.1 Squadron was declared operational with its new aircraft several days later. No.6 Squadron began to be re-equipped with F/A-18F Super Hornets from January 2011, and became operational with these aircraft on 1 March that year. The squadron's first Super Hornet operational conversion course was completed in October 2011.|$|E
5|$|Kirchner soon distanced {{himself from}} Duhalde, {{removing}} those close to the former president from the government to reduce his political influence. He also sought supporters across {{the social and political}} spectrum to counter Duhalde's influence in the party. Although Duhalde was not initially against Kirchner, Kirchner tried to prevent the presence of alternative leaderships within the PJ. However, they put their differences behind them during the October 2003 legislative elections. Their dispute was fanned by the political weight of Buenos Aires province (the most populous in Argentina, with almost 40 percent of the national vote), and continued through the 2005 midterm elections. Without consensus in the PJ for a candidate for senator in the Buenos Aires province, both leaders had their wives run for office: Hilda González de Duhalde for the PJ and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner for the Front for Victory, which contested the election as a different party. Cristina Kirchner won the election. As in 2003, the elections were defined by Peronist factions; the opposition parties could not put up a united national front. The victory gave Kirchner the confidence to remove Lavagna, Rafael Bielsa, Jose Pampuro, and Alicia Kirchner from his cabinet <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> ministers who, though less well-known, had perspectives closer to his own.|$|E

5|$|The entire opening {{sequence}} of the film was shot in Bulgaria during the winter, but was meant {{to take place in}} tropical South Asia. Digital effects were used to remove the snow and deciduous trees present <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> tropical flora. The alterations required over 340 shots alone. The scene was further complicated by Jet Li's scheduling conflict, which meant the interior sets had to be shipped to Hong Kong, reassembled and shot with him there, and the exterior sets had to be digitally built and then merged with footage of Li shot on Chroma key. A fish tank in the opening was filled with digital eels based on South Asian river eels, but increased in size by three times, after the real fish died and sank to the bottom. The finale in the airport was another complex digital environment, shot in three entirely differently locations in two seasons, which were then merged to create one seamless location. When the trucks break through glass to exit the airport, the scene is entirely digital and was filmed on Chroma screens in the middle of Sofia. Numerous digital matte paintings were used to modify the winter Bulgarian terrain in different scenes to represent its intended location.|$|E
