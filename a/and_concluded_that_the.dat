5|$|During Borobudur excavation, archeologists {{discovered}} colour pigments of blue, red, green, black, {{as well as}} bits of gold foil, <b>and</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> monument that we {{see today}} — a dark gray mass of volcanic stone, lacking in colour — was probably once coated with varjalepa white plaster and then painted with bright colors, serving perhaps as a beacon of Buddhist teaching. The same vajralepa plaster {{can also be found}} in Sari, Kalasan and Sewu temples. It is likely that the bas-reliefs of Borobudur was originally quite colourful, before centuries of torrential tropical rainfalls peeled-off the colour pigments.|$|E

30|$|A {{number of}} studies on {{groundwater}} and surface water quality with respect to drinking and irrigation purposes {{have been carried out}} in different parts of India and around the world with reference to major ion chemistry, trace element chemistry and through multivariate statistical techniques. Naik et al. (2009) carried out the groundwater study in Koyna river basin <b>and</b> <b>conclude</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> groundwater samples are dominated by alkaline earth elements, the shallow aquifers groundwater samples are generally Ca–HCO 3 and Ca–Mg–HCO 3 type, whereas deeper aquifer groundwater samples are Ca–Mg–HOC 3 and Na–HCO 3 type. Most of the groundwater sample is generally fit for drinking and irrigation purposes. Takem et al. (2010) carried out groundwater study from springs and bore wells in a alluvial aquifer <b>and</b> <b>conclude</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> area is contaminated with nitrate pollution due to anthropogenic activities. Purushotham et al. (2011) has carried out similar studies of groundwater <b>and</b> <b>conclude</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> groundwater deteriorated due to rapid urbanization. Suyash and Pawar (2011) has carried out accentuation of heavy metals in groundwater and its spatio-temporal variation through using GIS techniques in Ankaleshwar industrial estate, India <b>and</b> <b>conclude</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> GIS techniques have facilitated the monitoring of spatio-temporal behaviors of heavy metals and site-specific accretion pattern using raster and color composite maps of shallow groundwater system.|$|R
5|$|Edith Chaykoski {{died from}} her wounds at Windsor Metropolitan Hospital at about 05:30 on 26 June.

They identified it as Hesketh's <b>and</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 18-year-old must have taken it and gone on a shooting spree the previous day. Lamb was arrested at 15:30 on 26 June and charged with the capital murder of Edith Chaykoski. Under the terms of Canadian law at that time, he faced a mandatory death penalty if convicted. When Woloch's injuries also proved fatal at 14:45 on 11 July 1966, his murder was added to Lamb's charge.|$|E
5|$|From December 1873 {{until the}} {{expiration}} {{of his term}} in 1877, Stevenson was generally recognized as the chairman (later known as the floor leader) of the minority Democratic caucus in the Senate; {{he was the first}} person to have acted in the capacity. During the Forty-fourth Congress, he chaired the Committee on Revolutionary Claims. He did not seek reelection at the end of his term. In the disputed 1876 presidential election, he was one of the visiting statesmen who went to New Orleans, Louisiana, <b>and</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> election had been fairly conducted in that state.|$|E
5|$|Ian Drake, an {{assistant}} professor of Political Science and another critic of the compact, has argued that the constitution both requires and prohibits Congressional approval of the compact. In Drake's view, only a constitutional amendment could make the compact valid. Authors Michael Brody, Jennifer Hendricks, and Bradley Turflinger have examined the compact <b>and</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> NPVIC, if successfully enacted, would pass constitutional muster. Brody has put forth a unique theory that the legality of the NPVIC could potentially hinge on the notion that faithless electors are not necessarily obligated to vote for the candidate to whom they are pledged.|$|E

5|$|In August 1945, {{shortly after}} the bombing of Hiroshima, the Kodak Company {{observed}} spotting and fogging on their film, which {{was at that time}} usually packaged in cardboard containers. Dr. J. H. Webb, a Kodak employee, studied the matter <b>and</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> contamination must have come from a nuclear explosion somewhere in the United States. He discounted the possibility that the Hiroshima bomb was responsible, due to the timing of the events. A hot spot of fallout contaminated the river water that the paper mill in Indiana used to manufacture the cardboard pulp from corn husks. Aware of the gravity of his discovery, Dr. Webb kept this secret until 1949.|$|E
5|$|In United States v. Marchant (1827), the Court held thateven {{though a}} trial court has the {{discretion}} to sever {{the trials of}} co-defendantsa defendant {{has no right to}} insist upon being tried alone.

Justice Story was the author of the opinion of the Court, as well as a substantially similar opinion in the Massachusetts circuit court below.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the new findings, the U.S. Navy, with Sandia's assistance, reopened the investigation. In August 1991, Sandia and the GAO completed their reports, concluding that the explosion was likely caused by an accidental overram of powder bags into the breech of the 16-inch gun. The U.S. Navy, however, disagreed with Sandia's opinion <b>and</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cause of the explosion could not be determined. The U.S. Navy expressed regret (but not an apology) to Hartwig's family and closed its investigation.|$|E

5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} as new to science by mycologist William Alphonso Murrill in 1912. Murrill collected the type material growing near redwoods near Searsville Lake, California, in December 1911. In 1914, Murrill {{decided that the}} species {{was the same as}} Lepiota cristata (which he called Lepiota conspurcata (Willd.) Morgan); this opinion was later corroborated by Walter Sundberg in 1989 after he studied the type collection <b>and</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> microscopic characteristics of both were the same. Using molecular analysis based on comparing DNA sequences of the internal transcribed spacer region, mycologist Else Vellinga determined that despite the lack of distinguishing micro-morphological characteristics, the two species were distinct.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} {{originally}} named Agaricus agathosmus by Swedish mycologist Elias Fries in 1815; he later moved {{it into the}} genus Hygrophorus in 1838. In the interim, English naturalist Miles Joseph Berkeley named the species Agaricus cerasinus in 1836, although he too would later transfer the species to Hygrophorus in 1860. In 1948, Richard Dennis examined the type material, <b>and</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two names referred to the same species. Additional historical synonyms include Limacium pustulatum var. agathosmum (Kummer, 1871), and Limacium agathosmum (Wünsch, 1877).|$|E
5|$|These {{findings}} were contested {{a few years}} later by Catherine Forster, who reanalyzed Triceratops material more comprehensively <b>and</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> remains fell into two species, T. horridus and T. prorsus, although the distinctive skull of T. ("Nedoceratops") hatcheri differed enough to warrant a separate genus. She found that T. horridus and several other species belonged together, and T. prorsus and T. brevicornus stood alone, and since there were many more specimens in the first group, she suggested that this meant the two groups were two species. It is still possible to interpret the differences as representing a single species with sexual dimorphism.|$|E

5|$|Wary of the {{potential}} dangers (particularly {{the possibility of a}} prolific bacteria with a viral cancer-causing gene), the scientific community as well as a wide range of scientific outsiders reacted to these developments with both enthusiasm and fearful restraint. Prominent molecular biologists led by Berg suggested a temporary moratorium on recombinant DNA research until the dangers could be assessed and policies could be created. This moratorium was largely respected, until the participants in the 1975 Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA created policy recommendations <b>and</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> technology could be used safely.|$|E
5|$|Cantor {{extended}} {{his work on}} the absolute infinite by using it in a proof. Around 1895, he began to regard his well-ordering principle as a theorem and attempted to prove it. In 1899, he sent Dedekind a proof of the equivalent aleph theorem: the cardinality of every infinite set is an aleph. First, he defined two types of multiplicities: consistent multiplicities (sets) and inconsistent multiplicities (absolutely infinite multiplicities). Next he assumed that the ordinals form a set, proved that this leads to a contradiction, <b>and</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ordinals form an inconsistent multiplicity. He used this inconsistent multiplicity to prove the aleph theorem. In 1932, Zermelo criticized the construction in Cantor's proof.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Miralles {{and others}} {{reviewed}} the taxon maculata <b>and</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> animal {{now known as}} Trachylepis maculata also belongs in the African clade, but {{they were unable to}} determine whether or not it is indigenous to Guyana. They also reviewed Trachylepis (Xystrolepis) punctata and replaced it with Trachylepis tschudii because the older name was preoccupied by Linnaeus's and Gray's punctata. Although they were unable to resolve the identity of T.tschudii, which is still known from a single specimen, they believed that it is most likely the same species as the Noronha skink; it may be either a representative of an undiscovered Amazonian population of the latter or simply a mislabeled animal from Fernando de Noronha.|$|E
