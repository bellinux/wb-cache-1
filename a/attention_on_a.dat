25|$|Buddhist {{meditation}} of {{two main}} types, Samatha {{is meant to}} calm and relax the mind, as well as develop focus and concentration by training <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> single object.

Though the ultimate goal of these practices are nirvana, the Buddha stated that they also bring mundane benefits such as relaxation, good sleep and pain reduction.|$|E
25|$|The formal psychometric {{measurement}} of creativity, {{from the standpoint}} of orthodox psychological literature, is usually considered to have begun with J. P. Guilford's 1950 address to the American Psychological Association, which helped popularize the topic and focus <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> scientific approach to conceptualizing creativity. (It {{should be noted that the}} London School of Psychology had instigated psychometric studies of creativity as early as 1927 with the work of H. L. Hargreaves into the Faculty of Imagination, but it did not have the same impact.) Statistical analysis led to the recognition of creativity (as measured) as a separate aspect of human cognition to IQ-type intelligence, into which it had previously been subsumed. Guilford's work suggested that above a threshold level of IQ, the relationship between creativity and classically measured intelligence broke down.|$|E

The statue is mounted {{at the end of a}} winding brick pathway with a Union Flag patterned arrow head to reflect the opening credits of the TV series and the sculpture has been designed so that members of the public can sit beside Captain Mainwaring and have their photograph taken. The statue was vandalised not long after the unveiling by a 10-year-old boy, who kicked it for 10 minutes and broke off the statue's glasses, throwing them into a nearby river. The statue has since been fixed.|$|E

25|$|Their initial {{goal was}} to {{instigate}} a revolution against the rise of neoliberalism throughout Mexico, but as this did not happen, they used their uprising as a platform to call the world's attention to their movement to protest the signing of NAFTA, which the EZLN believed would increase the {{gap between rich and}} poor people in Chiapas—a prediction affirmed by subsequent developments. Gaining <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> global level through their convention called the Intercontinental Encounter for Humanity and Against Neoliberalism that was attended by 3,000 activists worldwide, the Zapatistas were able to help initiate a united platform for other anti-neoliberal groups. This did not detract from the Zapatistas' national activism efforts, but rather expanded their already existent ideologies. The EZLN also called for greater democratization of the Mexican government, which had been controlled by the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (Institutional Revolutionary Party, also known as PRI) for 65 years, and for land reform mandated by the 1917 Constitution of Mexico but largely ignored by the PRI. The EZLN did not demand independence from Mexico, but rather autonomy in the forms of land access and use of natural resources normally extracted from Chiapas, as well as protection from despotic violence and political inclusion of Chiapas' indigenous communities.|$|E

500|$|John Cleverley and D. C. Phillips place Locke's Some Thoughts Concerning Education at the {{beginning}} of a tradition of educational theory which they label [...] "environmentalism". In the years following the publication of Locke's work, Etienne Bonnot de Condillac and Claude Adrien Helvétius eagerly adopted the idea that people's minds were shaped through their experiences and thus through their education. Systems of teaching children through their senses proliferated throughout Europe. In Switzerland, Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, relying on Locke's theories, developed the concept of the [...] "object lesson." [...] These lessons focused pupils' <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> particular thing and encouraged them to use all of their senses to explore it and urged them to use precise words to describe it. Used throughout Europe and America during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, these object lessons, according to one of their practitioners [...] "if well-managed, cultivate Sense-Perception, or Observation, accustom children to express their thoughts in words, increase their available stock of words and of ideas, and by thus storing material for thinking, also prepare the way for more difficult and advanced study." ...|$|E

500|$|He {{focused his}} <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> problem that had eluded {{scientists}} for two hundred years: {{the nature of}} Saturn's rings. It was unknown how they could remain stable without breaking up, drifting away or crashing into Saturn. The problem took on a particular resonance at that time because St John's College, Cambridge had chosen it as the topic for the 1857 Adams Prize. Maxwell devoted two years to studying the problem, proving that a regular solid ring could not be stable, while a fluid ring would be forced by wave action to break up into blobs. Since neither was observed, Maxwell concluded that the rings must be composed of numerous small particles he called [...] "brick-bats", each independently orbiting Saturn. Maxwell was awarded the £130 Adams Prize in 1859 for his essay [...] "On {{the stability of the}} motion of Saturn's rings"; he was the only entrant to have made enough headway to submit an entry. His work was so detailed and convincing that when George Biddell Airy read it he commented [...] "It {{is one of the most}} remarkable applications of mathematics to physics that I have ever seen." [...] It was considered the final word on the issue until direct observations by the Voyager flybys of the 1980s confirmed Maxwell's prediction.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} has drawn critical <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> feminist perspective. Aja Romano of The Daily Dot {{felt that the}} new take on Gwen Stacy was a fresh one on its original version due to a common trope of women dying {{for the sake of}} men's angst. She praised the fact that instead of taking the role of a superhero's girlfriend, Latour designed her as a [...] "fully formed person." [...] Entertainment Weekly Joshua Rivera felt that [...] "Spider-Gwen succeeds because it isn't a superficial inversion, but an examination of what makes Spider-Man an important character." [...] Gwen Stacy's Spider-Woman was named number seven in a list of the best Spider-Men by Newsarama. Ryan Lynch of Screen Rant placed her as the second-greatest alternate version of Spider-Man, opining that her stories were [...] "a unique take on the Spider-mythos that provided unique stories based on fleshed out characters with clever writing." [...] Chris Sims from ComicsAlliance similarly ranked her as the second-greatest alternate take on Spider-Man. Mark Ginnochio, writing for Comicbook.com, placed the character's debut as the fourth-greatest alternate Spider-Man story ever told, confessing that even though Gwen Stacy was a newly created character {{she was on her way}} to be establishing herself as one of the most popular superheroines of Marvel.|$|E
500|$|For the 2002 presidential election, {{opinion polls}} had {{predicted}} a run-off between incumbent President Chirac and PS candidate Lionel Jospin. The shock was thus great when Le Pen unexpectedly beat Jospin (by 0.7%) {{in the first}} round. This resulted in the first presidential run-off since 1969 without a leftist candidate, and the first ever with a candidate of the far-right. To Le Pen's advantage, the election campaign had increasingly focused on law and order issues, helped by media <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> number of violent incidents. Jospin had also been weakened due to the competition between an exceptional number of leftist parties. Nevertheless, Chirac did not even have to campaign in the second round, as widespread anti-Le Pen protests from the media and public opinion culminated on May Day, with an estimated 1.5 million demonstrators across France. Chirac also refused to debate with Le Pen, and the traditional televised debate was cancelled. In the end, Chirac won the presidential run-off with an unprecedented 82.2% of the vote and with 71% of his votes—according to polls—cast simply [...] "to block Le Pen". Following the presidential election, the main centre-right parties merged to form the broad-based Union for a Popular Movement (UMP). The FN failed {{to hold on to}} Le Pen's support for the 2002 legislative elections, in which it got 11.3% of the vote. It nevertheless outpolled Mégret's MNR, which won a mere 1.1% support, even though it had fielded the same number of candidates.|$|E
