5|$|In June 2003, Stuart {{then joined}} fellow Third Division side Southend United for the {{upcoming}} 2003–04 season, saying he wanted to move nearer his family in London. He made his debut in the 3–0 home defeat against Mansfield Town in League Two on 23 August 2003. He was released from Southend United in May 2004 {{at the end of}} the season by manager Steve Tilson, having made 26 appearances in the Third Division for Southend United, collecting five yellow cards <b>and</b> <b>failing</b> <b>to</b> score.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Australia, Loxton had a torrid {{time with the}} bat in the 1954–55 season, scoring only 126 runs at 14.00 <b>and</b> <b>failing</b> <b>to</b> pass 30 in his six matches. He took 12 wickets at 32.41 for the season, the least number of wickets in any of his first-class seasons. The all-rounder’s best effort was a 4/31 against New South Wales in a match that Victoria lost by nine wickets. Loxton had a more productive summer in 1955–56. In seven matches, he scored 286 runs at 40.85 including an unbeaten century against South Australia, and took 14 wickets at 20.07; his best was a 4/35 in the return match against South Australia. The Sheffield Shield was won by Victoria’s bitter rivals New South Wales in both seasons.|$|E
5|$|Contamination {{by water}} during filling {{may be due}} to two causes. Inadequate {{filtration}} and drying of the compressed air can introduce small quantities of fresh water condensate, or an emulsion of water and compressor lubricant, <b>and</b> <b>failing</b> <b>to</b> clear the cylinder valve orifice of water which may have dripped from wet dive gear, which can allow contamination by fresh or seawater. Both cause corrosion, but seawater contamination can cause a cylinder to corrode rapidly {{to the extent that it}} may be unsafe or condemned after even a fairly short period. This problem is exacerbated in hot climates, where chemical reactions are faster, and is more prevalent where filling staff are badly trained or overworked.|$|E

5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of April 19, 2013, while in Atlanta, Georgia filming The Good Lie, Witherspoon and Toth were pulled over after the car in which they were {{traveling}} was seen weaving across a double line on Peachtree Street. Toth, who was driving, was found to have a blood alcohol level of 0.139 and {{was arrested and charged with}} driving under the influence <b>and</b> <b>failing</b> <b>to</b> maintain a lane. Witherspoon was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct for disobeying the arresting officer's instructions to remain in the vehicle and arguing with him, asking if he knew who she was. Witherspoon pleaded no contest and was fined $313, including court costs.|$|E
5|$|Four days later, Roy {{was dealt}} to the Colorado Avalanche with Mike Keane in {{exchange}} for Jocelyn Thibault, Martin Rucinsky and Andrei Kovalenko. The deal vaulted the Avalanche, the former Nordiques, to the 1996 Stanley Cup. Roy won another title with the Avalanche in 2001 along with a third Conn Smythe Trophy before retiring in 2003 with more wins than any NHL goaltender. The Canadiens, meanwhile, fell into an extended stretch of mediocrity, missing the playoffs in four of their next ten seasons <b>and</b> <b>failing</b> <b>to</b> advance past {{the second round of}} the playoffs until 2010. The team's lack of playoff success brought an end to its streak of winning a Stanley Cup in each decade from the 1910s to the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} season of Italian football, Milan failed to win a trophy, and Blomqvist often sat on the bench. He nearly decided against going to Old Trafford {{because he did not}} want a repeat of this season. The {{defending}} champions had an equally disappointing season, finishing 11th in Serie A <b>and</b> <b>failing</b> <b>to</b> qualify for European football. Blomqvist was subsequently sold to Serie A runners up Parma in the summer of 1997. Blomqvist enjoyed more regular football, although the club finished 6th in the league and missed out on the knockout stages of the Champions League. The Swede's sole league goal for the club was scored in a 4–0 win over Napoli at Stadio San Paolo.|$|E

5|$|On 23 November 2003, {{near his}} home in the Warwickshire village of Meriden, West Midlands, Hughes lost control of his Mercedes CL55 AMG and went onto {{the wrong side of the}} road before colliding with a Renault Scénic. A {{passenger}} in the Renault, Douglas Graham, was killed in the incident, whilst his wife Maureen and the driver Albert Frisby were severely injured. Hughes and passenger Adrian Smith left the scene, before turning themselves in to the police 36 hours later. He was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. He denied the charge, though later pleaded guilty to charges of failing to stop <b>and</b> <b>failing</b> <b>to</b> report an accident.|$|E
5|$|Roger Norreis (died between 1223 and 1225) was {{a medieval}} Abbot of Evesham in England. He was a {{controversial}} figure installed in several offices against opposition. In his appointment to Evesham {{he was accused}} of immoral behaviour <b>and</b> <b>failing</b> <b>to</b> follow monastic rules. In 1202 Norreis became embroiled in a dispute with his monks and his episcopal superior the Bishop of Worcester; litigation and argumentation lasted until his deposition in 1213. He then was appointed prior of a subsidiary monastic house of Evesham but was deposed within months then re-appointed to the office five years later.|$|E
5|$|The Roman {{army had}} not yet seen {{elephants}} in battle, and their inexperience turned the tide in Pyrrhus' favour at the Battle of Heraclea in 280 BC, and again at the Battle of Ausculum in 279 BC. Despite these victories, Pyrrhus found his position in Italy untenable. Rome steadfastly refused to negotiate with Pyrrhus {{as long as his}} army remained in Italy. Furthermore, Rome entered into a treaty of support with Carthage, and Pyrrhus found that despite his expectations, none of the other Italic peoples would defect to the Greek and Samnite cause. Facing unacceptably heavy losses with each encounter with the Roman army, <b>and</b> <b>failing</b> <b>to</b> find further allies in Italy, Pyrrhus withdrew from the peninsula and campaigned in Sicily against Carthage, abandoning his allies to deal with the Romans.|$|E

5|$|The album {{begins with}} two cover songs, and {{features}} a third on Side 2. Lyrics circle various themes, while the structuring {{of the songs}} shifted towards hard rock, psychedelic rock. The album was deemed by critics to {{be an attempt to}} retreat to the band's roots and received mostly positive reviews. Subterranean Jungle was not very successful commercially, peaking at number 83 on the US Billboard 200 <b>and</b> <b>failing</b> <b>to</b> chart internationally. The singles released from the album did not chart either. This is the last album by the band to feature Marky Ramone on drums until the 1989 album Brain Drain.|$|E
5|$|The stage {{show at the}} semi-final {{included}} Dustin in his trolley, {{wearing a}} silver suit. The trolley was dressed in green, white and gold, with the girls wearing gold dresses, green gloves and head-dresses in green, white and gold. Two of the male backing dancers wore large green, white and gold wings and danced around the stage, while the third back-up dancer wore a gold jump suit. The stage involved rippling effects of black and white, as well as waves of orange, white and green through the LCD screens on the stage. Despite {{being one of the}} favourites to win the contest outright, Dustin only managed to receive 22 points, placing 15th of the 19 countries competing <b>and</b> <b>failing</b> <b>to</b> reach the final.|$|E
5|$|After {{recording}} sessions, Lennon, Harrison and Starr {{would be}} chauffeured {{back to their}} houses in the 'stockbroker belt' of Southern England, but Aspinall would often drive McCartney and Evans in an Austin Princess limousine to a late-night club to eat. The Bag O'Nails nightclub {{was one of their}} favourites, at 8 Kingly Street in Soho, London, as it also presented live music. They would eat steak, chips and mushy peas, but Aspinall would always take out a torch from his pocket (in the dimly lit club) to inspect the portions on each of their plates. This was {{to make sure that the}} portions were exactly as they had ordered, which McCartney always found amusing. While Harrison, McCartney and Starr passed their driving tests, Lennon didn't pass his driving test until 1965; however, he rarely drove himself due to being a notoriously bad driver by poorly navigating roads <b>and</b> <b>failing</b> <b>to</b> notice other traffic, and as a result, he was usually chauffeured to and from recording sessions and appointments by his own personal chauffeur.|$|E

5|$|After the {{disastrous}} losses of Operation Bodenplatte, <b>and</b> <b>failing</b> <b>to</b> maintain air superiority over the Ardennes area, a severely weakened II./JG 1 transferred to Insterburg in East Prussia (modern Chernyakhovsk in Russia). I./JG 1 faced British fighters over Hengelo-Twente on 14 January 1945. JG 1 lost 12 pilots with 7 being killed, 3 wounded and 2 missing. Spitfires shot down the entire 1. and 2. staffels of JG 1 at Twente airport {{as they took}} off (for the loss of two). Ihlefeld threatened to court martial Major G. Capito, the new leader of I./JG 1, for such a disastrous loss {{but was unable to}} during the transferring to the Eastern Front. In Poland JG 1 were briefly assigned to Luftflotte Reich (the Air Fleet assigned to defend what was left of Germany from the final Allied offensives).|$|E
5|$|Carey's debut studio album made {{a strong}} impact on pop music, but the singer became {{interested}} in altering her sound and branching out into other genres for her second studio effort, Emotions (1991). Columbia allowed her to take more control over her musical direction, enabling her to change the musical genre, melodies, and production style. Carey worked with many new musicians and producers on the album; Walter Afanasieff being the only holdover from her debut. Emotions contained influences from 1950s, 60s, and 70s balladry, gospel, R and soul music. The album, while praised by some as being more mature and raw, failed to reach the critical or commercial heights of her debut effort; selling fewer units <b>and</b> <b>failing</b> <b>to</b> introduce Carey into new markets. Columbia decided to return Carey to the same genre as her debut album and have her produce a more commercial and radio-friendly record. Their plans were to tone down Carey's vocals and soften the album's production to create a contemporary pop record. Carey and Afanasieff agreed to the change and began writing and recording material for her third studio effort, Music Box (1993).|$|E
5|$|Chris Beveridge's {{review for}} Fandom Post was highly {{positive}} towards the anime series, {{calling it a}} dark horse contender {{as one of their}} top new anime series of the year. Beveridge praised the technical and fundamental aspects of magic in the series for breaking the supernatural approach other works usually take and liked the potential impact it could have on future events. However, while the reviewer liked the series' technicality, they noted it will frustrate certain viewers in that aspect. Richard Eisenbeis, writing for Kotaku, liked the characters, story, the complex and technical magic system, and mysteries. However, Eisenbeis criticized the exposition, citing it to be poorly timed, heavy, <b>and</b> <b>failing</b> <b>to</b> explain things with better clarity. He concluded his review by writing how the anime might have been great if a different director or screenwriting was hired.|$|E

5|$|Despite being {{considered}} dissipated, a re-analysis of satellite imagery indicated {{the circulation of}} Olaf persisted as turned to the west toward open waters. Early on September 30, the system reached the Pacific, and it continued westward for about a week, during which it retained some convective activity. On October 5, Olaf turned toward the east, as it interacted with the large circulation of developing Hurricane Pauline. Later that day, the NHC resumed issuing advisories, while it was located about 560 miles (900km) southwest of {{the southern tip of}} the Baja California Peninsula. The system turned to the southeast, <b>and,</b> <b>failing</b> <b>to</b> organize, the NHC discontinued advisories on October 8. Three days later, after the remnants of Olaf turned toward the north, the NHC again resumed advisories, when it was just 70 miles (115km) south-southwest of Tecomán, Colima. Late on October 12, the circulation of Olaf made its final landfall near Manzanillo, Colima, and it quickly dissipated. An associated area of thunderstorms moved over open waters again, but failed to redevelop.|$|E
5|$|Dougan {{stood as}} an {{independent}} 'Former Captain NI Football Team' candidate for the East Belfast constituency in the 1997 UK general election, but got only 541 votes and finished seventh out of the nine candidates. In April 2000, he was cleared of aggravated burglary following a trial at Wolverhampton Crown Court; the incident had been alleged {{to have taken place}} at the home of Patricia Thompson, a former lover. He was also cleared of assaulting a Vietnam War veteran with a pool cue, who had been at the home with Patricia Thompson {{at the time of the}} alleged burglary incident. In another court case, again in April 2000, Dougan failed to attend a hearing where he had been charged with driving carelessly <b>and</b> <b>failing</b> <b>to</b> comply with a red traffic signal; he said he had been unable to attend because he had a dental appointment.|$|E
5|$|Early in the advance, Maxwell's company {{commander}} was severely wounded, resulting in Maxwell assuming control. Reaching the German barbwire defences under intense machine-gun fire, the company suffered heavy casualties, including {{all of the}} officers except Maxwell. Pushing forward alone through a narrow passageway in the wire, Maxwell captured the most dangerous machine gun, killed three Germans and took another four as prisoners; thereby enabling the company {{to move through the}} wire and reach their objective. Shortly afterwards, it was noticed that the company on their left flank was held up <b>and</b> <b>failing</b> <b>to</b> advance. Gathering a party of men, Maxwell led the group in an attempt to attack the German force from the rear. They soon came under heavy machine gun fire, and, single-handedly, Maxwell dashed forward and attacked the foremost gun. Firing his revolver, he managed to shoot five of the crew and silence the gun.|$|E
