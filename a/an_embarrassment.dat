5|$|The Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, {{regarded}} {{the state of}} the national capital as <b>an</b> <b>embarrassment.</b> Over time his attitude changed from one of contempt to that of championing its development. He fired two ministers charged with the development of the city, feeling that their performance lacked intensity.|$|E
5|$|After the {{violence}} of November 4, the Indianapolis Merchant's Association and other business leaders petitioned Governor Ralston to call out the Indiana National Guard. Members of both parties accused the union leaders of trying to prevent their voters from reaching the polls. The riots made national news and public leaders began to consider them <b>an</b> <b>embarrassment</b> to the state. Union leaders informed the Governor that calling out the guard would only cause them to escalate the riot and lead to more bloodshed.|$|E
5|$|The scandal proved <b>an</b> <b>embarrassment</b> to the {{reputation}} of the Royal Navy, then still the world's largest, and it was satirised at home and abroad through editorials, cartoons, and even a comic jazz oratorio composed by Erwin Schulhoff. One consequence of the damaging affair was an undertaking from the Admiralty to review the means by which naval officers might bring complaints against the conduct of their superiors.|$|E

5|$|During the war the Wallenberg bank, Stockholms Enskilda Bank {{collaborated with}} the German government. The Secretary of the US Treasury, Henry Morgenthau Jr. {{considered}} Jacob Wallenberg strongly pro-German, and in 1945 the US Federal Bureau of Investigation subjected the Bank to a blockade from engaging in business in the United States that was only lifted in 1947. Author Alan Lelchuk who interviewed, amongst others, Wallenberg's KGB interrogator, has speculated that the more powerful of the family may {{have chosen not to}} use their influence to locate Raoul as it could have drawn attention to their misdeeds, and they may have considered him <b>an</b> <b>embarrassment,</b> not only for being a man of morality, but his possible homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the club}} has had notable defeats from 2000–01 onwards, crowds have {{continued}} to be healthy. During the 2005–06 season, home attendances (that is, given attendances minus away support) increased slightly on the season before, helped by a 10,006 crowd against Carlisle {{on the final day}} of the season. That game in particular attracted a large crowd as the town of Stockport supported its team at Edgeley Park. If Stockport had lost that particular game, they would have been relegated for the second successive season, and more significantly, would have been relegated from the Football League for the first time, <b>an</b> <b>embarrassment</b> as the team has competed continuously in the Football League since 1900. Stockport eventually drew the game with Carlisle and survived the drop, while Carlisle themselves gained the league championship.|$|E
5|$|He {{was shot}} down most {{probably}} by Italian Spanish Civil War ace Tenente Lieutenant) Franco Lucchini of 90a Squadriglia, 10° Gruppo ("group"), 4° Stormo ("wing"). He landed, winded, and played dead to avoid being strafed. He started to walk towards the Allied lines and crossed the border at around midday the following day. After two days, he was rescued by a detachment from the 11th Hussars, who returned him to Sidi Barrani. Pattle was annoyed. He considered being shot down by the Italians as <b>an</b> <b>embarrassment</b> and regarded the episode as a slur on his reputation. After his forced march to friendly lines, he was also determined not {{to get lost in}} the desert again so he flew to Alexandria and bought a compass which he never flew without.|$|E

5|$|Smith {{was born}} as Frank Wenham in Tonbridge, Kent, on 9 June 1885. He was the illegitimate son of Oswald Cox, {{a member of}} a {{prominent}} local family who resided at Marl Field House, and one of his domestic servants, Minnie Wenham, whom Frank would never come to know. Considered <b>an</b> <b>embarrassment</b> by the wealthy Cox family, from an early age he was sent away to live with relatives, and aged four sent to a boarding school where he was physically abused by staff before being removed from the institution by his paternal grandmother, who took him for a year in Switzerland. From 1899 to 1901, he studied at Bedales School, where he developed his lifelong hobby of book binding, before becoming the apprentice to a cabinet maker in Kendal until 1906.|$|E
5|$|The {{condition}} of the Ottoman fleet could not be concealed from foreign observers, which proved to be <b>an</b> <b>embarrassment</b> {{for the government and}} finally forced Abdul Hamid II to authorize a modernization program, which recommended that the ironclads be modernized in foreign shipyards. German firms, including Krupp, Schichau-Werke, and AG Vulcan, were to rebuild the ships, but after having surveyed the ships, withdrew from the project in December 1897 owing to the impracticality of modernizing the ships and the inability of the Ottoman government to pay for the work. By 1900, the contracts were finally awarded, and Necm-i Şevket {{was not included in the}} program. Instead, the ship was employed as a stationary ship based in Selanik from 1899 to 1909, at which point she was converted into a barracks ship in Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|The {{condition}} of the Ottoman fleet could not be concealed from foreign observers. The fleet proved to be <b>an</b> <b>embarrassment</b> {{for the government and}} finally forced Sultan Abdul Hamid II to authorize a modernization program, which recommended that the ironclads be modernized in foreign shipyards. German firms, including Krupp, Schichau-Werke, and AG Vulcan, were to rebuild the ships, but after having surveyed them, withdrew from the project in December 1897 owing to the impracticality of modernizing the ships and the inability of the Ottoman government to pay for the work due to its weak finances. Negotiations dragged on into the early 1900s, but Hamidiye {{was not included in the}} program. Instead, Hamidiye was decommissioned in 1903; the Ottoman Navy considered rebuilding the ship that year, like many of the other ironclads, but the ship was in too poor a condition to merit reconstruction. On 11 November 1909, she was placed for sale, and she was finally purchased by ship breakers in 1913 and thereafter dismantled.|$|E

5|$|The {{directorship}} of Neil MacGregor saw a major rehang at the Gallery, {{dispensing with}} {{the classification of}} paintings by national school that had been introduced by Eastlake. The new chronological hang sought to emphasise the interaction between cultures rather than fixed national characteristics, reflecting the change in art historical values since the 19th century. In other respects, however, Victorian tastes were rehabilitated: the building's interiors were no longer considered <b>an</b> <b>embarrassment</b> and were restored, and in 1999 the Gallery accepted a bequest of 26 Italian Baroque paintings from Sir Denis Mahon. Earlier in the 20th century many considered the Baroque to be beyond the pale: in 1945 the Gallery's trustees declined to buy a Guercino from Mahon's collection for £200. The same painting was valued at £4million in 2003. Mahon's bequest was made {{on the condition that}} the Gallery would never deaccession any of its paintings or charge for admission.|$|E
5|$|The terms {{by which}} Kilij Arslan II allowed Manuel and his army to leave were {{that he should}} remove his forts and armies on the {{frontier}} at Dorylaeum and Sublaeum. Since the Sultan had already failed to keep {{his side of the}} earlier treaty of 1162, however, Manuel only ordered the fortifications of Sublaeum to be dismantled, but not the fortifications of Dorylaeum. Nevertheless, defeat at Myriokephalon was <b>an</b> <b>embarrassment</b> for both Manuel personally and also for his empire. The Komnenian emperors had worked hard since the Battle of Manzikert, 105 years earlier, to restore the reputation of the empire. Yet because of his over-confidence, Manuel had demonstrated to the whole world that Byzantium still could not defeat the Seljuks, despite the advances made during the past century. In western opinion, Myriokephalon cut Manuel down to a humbler size: not that of Emperor of the Romans but that of King of the Greeks.|$|E
5|$|The total {{incompetence}} of the D.C. {{government in}} Washington, DC, has become <b>an</b> <b>embarrassment</b> to our entire Nation. This experiment in home rule is a disaster. All {{of us who}} serve in this Chamber, well over 95% of us, have held other positions in government. We have been mayors. We have been township trustees, State legislators, and the rest. I am convinced, Mr. Speaker, that there are well over 2,000 township trustees in my congressional district who with one arm tied behind their backs, could blindfolded {{do a better job}} of directing this city than the city council of D.C. It is high time that this experiment in home rule that has proven to be a disaster for our nation be terminated, that we return to some sort of logical government whereby the rest of us can function in this city.|$|E

5|$|Wagner {{planned for}} a {{collected}} {{edition of his}} publications as early as 1865; he believed that such an edition would help the world understand his intellectual development and artistic aims. The first such edition was published between 1871 and 1883, but was doctored to suppress or alter articles that were <b>an</b> <b>embarrassment</b> to him (e.g. those praising Meyerbeer), or by altering dates on some articles to reinforce Wagner's own account of his progress. Wagner's autobiography Mein Leben was originally published for close friends only {{in a very small}} edition (15–18 copies per volume) in four volumes between 1870 and 1880. The first public edition (with many passages suppressed by Cosima) appeared in 1911; the first attempt at a full edition (in German) appeared in 1963.|$|E
5|$|Announcing his Cabinet on 17 December 1962, Field named Smith his Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Treasury. Two days later, RA Butler, the British Deputy Prime Minister and First Secretary of State, {{announced}} that the UK government would allow Nyasaland to leave the Federation. With Northern Rhodesia now also under a secessionist black nationalist government—Kenneth Kaunda and Harry Nkumbula had formed a coalition to keep the UFP out—and Southern Rhodesia under the RF, the Federation was effectively over. The Field Cabinet made Southern Rhodesian independence on Federal dissolution its first priority, but the Conservative government in the UK was reluctant to grant this under the 1961 constitution as it knew doing so would lead to censure and loss of prestige in the United Nations (UN) and the Commonwealth. Indeed, Southern Rhodesia's minority government had already become something of <b>an</b> <b>embarrassment</b> to the UK and it hurt Britain's reputation to even {{maintain the status quo}} there. Granting independence without major constitutional reform would furthermore provoke outcry from the Conservatives' main parliamentary opposition, the Labour Party, which was strongly anti-colonial and supportive of black nationalist ambitions.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the Greco-Turkish War in February 1897, Hifz-ur Rahman was {{assigned}} to the II Squadron. The Ottomans inspected the fleet and found that almost all of the vessels, including Hifz-ur Rahman, to be completely unfit for combat against the Greek Navy. Many of the ships had rotted hulls and their crews are poorly trained. Through April and May, the Ottoman fleet made several sorties into the Aegean Sea in an attempt to raise morale among the ships' crews, though the Ottomans had no intention of attacking Greek forces. During these operations, Hifz-ur Rahman were stationed at Morto Bay {{at the mouth of the}} Dardanelles, while the rest of the ironclads remained safely inside the straits. The condition of the Ottoman fleet could not be concealed from foreign observers, which proved to be <b>an</b> <b>embarrassment</b> for the government and finally forced Sultan Abdul Hamid II to authorize a modernization program, which recommended that the ironclads be modernized in foreign shipyards. Hifz-ur Rahman was not included in the program, and instead she was decommissioned in 1909 and placed on the disposal list on 31 July. She was sold for scrap on 11 November that year and subsequently broken up.|$|E

5|$|Chapman played {{infrequently}} in 1936, and the captaincy {{was shared}} {{between him and}} two others. He was reluctant to bat, {{to the extent of}} dropping down the batting order to avoid doing so, and his friends believed that his nerve had gone. At the end of the season, he announced that business commitments forced him to give up the captaincy. Over the following three seasons, Chapman played for Kent in three more matches: against the New Zealand touring side in 1937 and in two Championship games in 1938. He also captained a non-representative England XI in a festival game against the New Zealanders in 1937, batting at number ten in the order and scoring 61. His remaining first-class matches were low-profile games against Oxford and Cambridge Universities; he played 13 games in his final three seasons. In his last first-class game, in 1939, he captained MCC against Oxford, scoring 12 and 0. In all first-class cricket, Chapman scored 16,309 runs in 394 matches at an average of 31.97, and held 356 catches. By the time his career ended, his weight had increased even further, and Lemmon believes that he had become <b>an</b> <b>embarrassment</b> to other cricketers. Subsequently, Chapman faded away without much comment.|$|E
5|$|Cibber and Katherine had 12 {{children}} between 1694 and 1713. Six died in infancy, {{and most of}} the surviving children received short shrift in his will. Catherine, the eldest surviving daughter, married Colonel James Brown and seems to have been the dutiful one who looked after Cibber in old age following his wife's death in 1734. She was duly rewarded at his death with most of his estate. His middle daughters, Anne and Elizabeth, went into business. Anne had a shop that sold fine wares and foods, and married John Boultby. Elizabeth had a restaurant near Gray's Inn, and married firstly Dawson Brett, and secondly (after Brett's death) Joseph Marples. His only son to reach adulthood, Theophilus, became an actor at Drury Lane, and was <b>an</b> <b>embarrassment</b> to his father because of his scandalous private life. His other son to survive infancy, James, died in or after 1717 before reaching adulthood. Colley's youngest daughter Charlotte followed in her father's theatrical footsteps, but she fell out with him and her sister Catherine, and she was cut off by the family.|$|E
