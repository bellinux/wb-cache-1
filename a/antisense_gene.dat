40|$|Endogenous {{expression}} of antisense RNA represents one major way of applying antisense nucleic acids. To express antisense RNA intracellularly, recombinant <b>antisense</b> <b>genes</b> {{have to be}} designed and introduced into cells where the target RNA is encountered. Efficient annealing between the antisense RNA and the target RNA is crucial for efficacy and is strongly influenced by RNA structure. Here we extend structural rules {{for the design of}} in vitro transcribed antisense RNAs to the design of recombinant <b>antisense</b> <b>genes.</b> Intracellularly expressed <b>antisense</b> RNA transcripts contain a central antisense portion and additional flanking vector-derived sequences. A computer algorithm was generated to compose large sets of <b>antisense</b> <b>genes,</b> to calculate secondary structures of the transcribed sequences and to select for favorable structures of antisense RNA in terms of annealing and efficacy. The biological test system to measure efficiency of <b>antisense</b> <b>genes</b> was human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) replication in 293 T cells. When considering the lower intracellular steady-state levels of favorably structured endogenous transcripts, an antisense effect against HIV- 1 replication was observed that was up to 60 -fold stronger than that measured for predicted unfavorable species. The computational selection was successful for antisense portions of 300 nt but not 100 nt in length.

Skin biopsy-derived RNAs from fourteen early SSc patients and six healthy individuals were sequenced with ion-torrent and analysed using DEseq 2. Overall, 4901 genes with a fold change > 1. 5 and a false discovery rate < 5 % were detected in patients versus controls.

40|$|Abstract Background Recent {{studies in}} {{a growing number of}} organisms have yielded accumulating {{evidence}} that {{a significant portion of the}} non-coding region in the genome is transcribed. We address this issue in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Results Taking into account the absence of a significantly large yeast EST database, we use microarray expression data collected for genomic regions erroneously believed to be coding to study the expression pattern of non-coding regions in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. We find that at least 164 out of 589 (28 %) such regions are expressed under specific biological conditions. In particular, looking at the probes that are located opposing other known genes at the same genomic locus, we find that 88 out of 341 (26 %) of these <b>genes</b> support <b>antisense</b> transcription. The expression patterns of these <b>antisense</b> <b>genes</b> are positively correlated. We validate these results using RT-PCR on a sample of 6 non-coding transcripts. Conclusion 1.

Correlated transcription of <b>antisense</b> <b>genes</b> is abundant in the yeast genome. 3. <b>Antisense</b> <b>genes</b> in yeast are non-coding. </p...|$|R

5000|$|Cis-NATs have {{a variety}} of orientations and differing lengths of overlap between pairs. There have been five {{identified}} orientations for cis-NATs to date. The most common orientation is head-to-head, where the 5' ends of both transcripts align together. This orientation would result in the greatest knockdown of gene expression if transcriptional collision is the reason for transcript inhibition. There are however some studies that have suggested that tail-to-tail orientations are the most common NAT pairs. Others such as tail to tail, overlapping, nearby head-to- head, and nearby tail-to-tail are less frequently encountered. [...] Completely overlapping NATs involve the <b>antisense</b> <b>gene</b> being located completely over top of each other. Nearby head-to-head and tail-to-tail orientations are physically discrete from each other but are located very close to each other.

50|$|Airn is an lncRNA used {{to silence}} Igf2r and other {{surrounding}} genes. In the mechanism to silence Igf2r, the transcription of the lncRNA Airn silences {{the expression of}} Igf2r, {{as opposed to an}} active repression mechanism. Airn is the <b>antisense</b> <b>gene</b> of Ifg2r, so if Airn is being transcribed, the transcriptional machinery may cover a part of or the entire promoter region of Igf2r, so RNA polymerase cannot bind to the promoter region of Igf2r in order to initiate transcription. This mechanism is very efficient in that Igf2r is silenced by transcription of Airn, while the RNA product silences other genes near Igf2r. The imprinting mechanisms described above work on the chromosome that the Airn lncRNA is produced, but there are many other imprinted genes that work to silence genes on other chromosomes or to silence the similar allele(s) on the opposing chromosome of the same pair. Some imprinted genes code for regulatory RNA elements such as lncRNA, small nucleolar RNA, and micro RNA, so the expression of these genes results in the silencing of some other gene.|$|E
40|$|Several {{models have}} been {{proposed}} to explain why expression parameters of a gene {{might be related to}} the size of the gene's introns. These include the idea that an energetic cost of transcription should favor smaller introns in highly expressed genes (the "economy selection" argument) and that tissue-specific genes reside in genomic locations with complex chromatin level control requiring large amounts of noncoding DNA (the "genomic design" hypothesis). We recently proposed a modification of the economy model arguing that, for some genes, the time that expression takes is more important than the energetic cost, such that some weakly but rapidly expressed genes might also have small introns. We suggested that <b>antisense</b> <b>genes</b> might be such a class and showed that the data appear to be consistent with this. We now reexamine this model to ask (a) whether the effects described were owing solely to the fact that <b>antisense</b> <b>genes</b> are often noncoding RNA and (b) whether we can confidently reject the "genomic design" model as an explanation for the facts.

Despite their high negative charge, these nanostructures are naturally taken up by cells, {{without the need for}} positively charged polymeric co-carriers, and are highly effective as gene regulation agents in both siRNA and <b>antisense</b> <b>gene</b> regulation pathways. This discovery represents a paradigm shift for the field, since previous lore predicted that nucleic acids would not efficiently enter cells without positively charged co-carriers (Fig. 4). Although this is true for linear nucleic acids, it is not the case for SNAs. This stunning result is because SNAs, unlike their linear counterparts, have the ability to complex scavenger proteins and thereby facilitate endocytosis. Investigation of the mechanism for SNA uptake revealed that these nanostructures exhibit an ability to deactivate enzymes responsible for triggering cellular immune response and oligonucleotide degradation.

50|$|Through genetic engineering, Calgene {{hoped to}} slow down the {{ripening}} process of the tomato and thus prevent it from softening, while still allowing the tomato to retain its natural colour and flavor. The tomato was made more resistant to rotting by adding an <b>antisense</b> <b>gene</b> which interferes with the production of the enzyme polygalacturonase. The enzyme normally degrades pectin in the cell walls and results in the softening of fruit which makes them more susceptible to being damaged by fungal infections. Some unmodified tomatoes are picked before fully ripened and are then artificially ripened using ethylene gas which acts as a plant hormone. Picking the fruit while unripe allows for easier handling and extended shelf-life. Flavr Savr tomatoes, on the other hand, could be allowed to ripen on the vine, without compromising their shelf-life. The intended effect of slowing down the softening of Flavr Savr tomatoes would allow the vine-ripe fruits to be harvested like green tomatoes without greater damage to the tomato itself. The Flavr Savr turned out to disappoint researchers in that respect, as the antisensed PG gene had a positive effect on shelf life, but not on the fruit's firmness, so the tomatoes still had to be harvested like any other unmodified vine-ripe tomatoes. An improved flavor, later achieved through traditional breeding of Flavr Savr and better tasting varieties, would also contribute to selling Flavr Savr at a premium price at the supermarket.|$|E

Here we firstly employed an antisense RNA strategy as an elaborate metabolic engi-neering tool to partially block biosynthesis of two major acetate pathway enzymes, phosphotransacetylase (PTA) and acetate kinase (ACK). Three recombinant plasmids containing <b>antisense</b> <b>genes</b> targeting either or both of pta and ackA were constructed, and their effects on the acetate pathway and foreign protein productivity com-pared to control plasmid without any <b>antisense</b> <b>genes</b> were determined in E. coli BL 21.

Notably, total production of GFP was enhanced 1. 6 - to 2. 1 -fold in antisense-regulated strains, even though the degree of acetate reduction was not significantly large.

To test the location effect hypothesis, strains were generated which contained the target lacZ gene at a fixed location and the antisense lacZ gene at various genomic locations including all arms of the three fission yeast chomosomes and {{in close proximity to}} the target gene locus. A long inverse-PCR protocol was developed to rapidly identify the precise site of <b>antisense</b> <b>gene</b> integration in the fission yeast transformants. No significant difference in lacZ suppression was observed when the <b>antisense</b> <b>gene</b> was integrated in close proximity to the target gene locus, compared with other genomic locations, indicating that target and <b>antisense</b> <b>gene</b> co-localisation is not a critical factor for efficient antisense RNA-mediated gene suppression in vivo. Instead, increased lacZ down-regulation correlated with an increase in the steady-state level of antisense RNA, which was dependent on genomic position effects and transgene copy number. In contrast, convergent transcription of an overlapping antisense lacZ gene was found to be very effective at inhibiting lacZ gene expression. DsRNA was also found to be a central component of antisense RNA-mediated gene silencing in fission yeast. It was shown that gene suppression could be enhanced by increasing the intracellular concentration of non-coding lacZ RNA, while expression of a lacZ panhandle RNA also inhibited beta-galactosidase activity. In addition, over-expression of the ATP-dependent RNA-helicase, ded 1, was found to specifically enhance antisense RNA-mediated gene silencing.

These endogenous timekeepers enable organisms to prepare for predictable environmental conditions from one day to the next and thus allow adaptation to a given temporal niche. In general, circadian clocks have been shown to employ the classical transcriptional and posttranscriptional control mechanisms to generate rhythmicity. However, the discovery of <b>antisense</b> clock <b>gene</b> transcripts suggests that mechanisms of gene regulation operating through antisense RNA may also be integral to the circadian clockwork. Following a brief history of the impact of genetic and molecular techniques in aiding our understanding of circadian clocks, this review concentrates on the few examples of <b>antisense</b> clock <b>gene</b> transcripts so far investigated and their effect on circadian timing...|$|R
