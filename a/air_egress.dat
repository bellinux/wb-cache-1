40|$|Modifications {{to local}} and state codes are seen as an {{appropriate}} strategy {{for the prevention of}} residential air distribution system leakage and its impacts. A model code element has been developed to assist this strategy. Recent field studies of Florida residences by Cummings, Tooley and Moyer have revealed a mean leakage of 11 percent for the air distribution systems of central, fan-force heating and air conditioning systems. Such leakage may cause an estimated 20 percent increase in energy consumption for air conditioning, as well as a 50 percent increase in peak cooling load and an 80 percent increase in peak heating load. In addition, building air leakage may be expected to be several times greater when duct leakage is present or when avenues of <b>air</b> <b>egress</b> from closeable rooms are absent. The model duct construction element presented here contains all of the standards, definitions and code language needed to replace the current duct construction element of the local or state code. The content of this paper was used as a principal source for language adopted for the 1991 Florida Energy Efficiency Code For Building Construction. Addressed are the most appropriate standards required for the closure and sealing of metal duct, rigid fibrous glass duct, and nonmetallic flexible duct. Also addressed are (1) detailed requirements for the sealing of mechanical closets when they function as plenum chambers, (2) detailed requirements for the sealing of enclosed support platforms or air handlers and furnaces when they function as return duct, (3) detailed requirements for the sealing of uninhabitable cavities of the building structure, when they function as duct, and (4) detailed requirements for the egress of air from enclosed rooms which receive supply air. Where necessary, commentary is provided to explain the options available for implementing the model code provision as well as its ramifications. All provisions of this model code are compatible with the requirements, standards and guidelines contained in related documents published by the following organizations: the Southern Building Code Congress International, Inc., the Sheet Metal and Air Conditioning Contractors National Association, the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air conditioning Engineers, Underwriters Laboratories, Inc., the Air Conditioning Contractors Of America, the Thermal Insulation Manufacturers Association, the National Fire Protection Association, and the Gypsum Association...|$|E

40|$|Gas {{turbine engine}} {{performance}} requires effective and reliable internal cooling over the duty {{cycle of the}} engine. Understanding the effectiveness of cooling flows when making life predictions for rotating components subject to the main gas path temperatures is crucial. A test facility has been developed at the University of Sussex incorporating a two stage turbine designed to support a European funded research project {{with the objective of}} enhancing the understanding of interactions between main annulus gas paths and secondary air systems. This thesis describes the specific contribution of the author to the research conducted at the test facility. Non-invasive gas seeding and concentration measurement techniques together with hot geometry displacement measurements have been developed to meet three distinct objectives: to determine inter-stage seal flows between rotor disc cavities; to provide data to quantify rim seal exchange flows between rotor stator cavities and the main annulus gas path for both bulk ingestion and egress conditions; and, to provide data to quantify the re-ingestion of cooling <b>air</b> <b>egressed</b> into the main annulus gas path. Detailed knowledge of these flows is vital to understanding the flow structures within rotor stator cavities and to optimise coolant delivery methods. Experimental results are presented for a number of cooling flow supply geometries and flow rates. The gas concentration measurement techniques developed and the results obtained are compared to traditional measurements as well as numerical simulations carried out by research project partners. This work develops the measurement techniques of rotor stator cavity flows and provides data suitable for the validation of improved thermo-mechanical and CFD codes, beneficial to the engine design process...|$|R
50|$|Personal <b>Egress</b> <b>Air</b> Packs, or PEAPs, were devices {{on board}} a Space Shuttle which {{provided}} crew members with approximately six minutes of breathable air {{in the case of}} a mishap while the vehicle was still located on the ground. PEAPs did not provide pressurized air, meaning that they were only intended to be used should the air inside the shuttle cabin become unbreathable by way of noxious gases.|$|R
25|$|Following the Challenger disaster, {{examination}} of the recovered vehicle cockpit revealed {{that three of the}} crew members Personal <b>Egress</b> <b>Air</b> Packs were activated: those of Onizuka, mission specialist Judith Resnik, and pilot Michael Smith. The location of Smith's activation switch, on the back side of his seat, means that either Resnik or Onizuka could have activated it for him. This is the only evidence available from the disaster that shows Onizuka and Resnik were alive after the cockpit separated from the vehicle. However, if the cabin had lost pressure, the packs alone would not have sustained the crew during the two-minute descent.|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} {{on a mission}} {{critical}} telecommunications network switching facility located in Southern Mississippi. The life safety and property preservation measures are summarized in this report. The prescriptive design approaches for various fire and life safety systems in telecommunications facilities were evaluated against the performance based approaches studied in the Cal Poly Fire Protection Engineering curriculum. Majority of the prescriptive approaches are in accordance with the performance based solutions, however the smoke management system’s performance and prescriptive design yields a significant discrepancy. For the smoke management system, a difference in the flow rates is observed between the exhaust and make-up rates {{with the use of the}} NFPA- 92 method and the CFD model. The CFD yields the flow requirements nearly 4 times the amount required when calculated with the NFPA- 92 approach. Further research beyond the scope of this report is required to factor the influence of the actual operating conditions, such as high rates of air change, the IT equipment heat load, and cold supply <b>air.</b> The <b>egress</b> provisions per NFPA 101 and the IBC are more than sufficient for telecommunications facilities with its low occupancy loads. The one concern is the pre-movement time for occupants who are intimately involved in detailed tasks when the alarm conditions occur. The NFPA 13 sprinkler, Light Hazard classification is sufficient for the administrative support area suppression. For the process and other equipment spaces NFPA 2001 provides adequate means of early suppression using FM- 200 to protect the electronic equipment and minimize smoke generation and fire propagation...|$|R
40|$|A new law {{approved}} in March 2017 in the Lombardy Region {{makes it possible}} to live in basements. Basements are defined as buildings partly below curb level but with at least one-half of its height above the curb. Basements’ features and structural characteristics might pose risks to human health. In this paper we adopt a multidisciplinary approach to assess the potential health effects of living in basements. In particular, we define a conceptual framework to describe basements’ structural characteristics which are risk factors, as well as the mechanisms through which they impact on human health. We also conduct a systematic review on the scientific databases PubMed,Embase, DOAJ, Proquest and EBSCO to retrieve, pool and critically analyze all available research that quantified the risk of living in basements for different health outcomes. Available evidence suggests living in basements increases the risk of respiratory diseases (asthma and allergic disorders); more heterogeneous data are available for cancers and cardiovascular diseases. As more quantitative data need to be prospectively retrieved to assess and monitor the risk of living in basements for human health, clear minimum requirements for light, <b>air,</b> sanitation and <b>egress</b> are to be defined by technical experts and enforced by policy makers...|$|R
5000|$|The crew {{perished in}} the vehicle breakup. Divers from the [...] located what they {{believed}} to be the crew cabin on the ocean floor on March 7. A dive the following day confirmed that it was the cabin and that the remains of the crew were inside. No official investigation into the Challenger disaster has concluded for certain the cause of death of the astronauts; it is almost certain, however, that the disintegration itself did not kill the entire crew as 3 of the 4 Personal <b>Egress</b> <b>Air</b> Packs (PEAPs) that were recovered had been manually activated. This would only be done during an emergency or loss of cabin pressure (although whether cabin pressure was lost is still in debate but considered likely). PEAPs do not provide a pressurized air flow and would still have resulted in the astronauts losing consciousness within several seconds. There were media reports alleging that NASA had a tape recording of the crew panicking and on-board conversation following the disintegration during the 2 minute 45 second free fall before hitting the sea east of Florida. This was likely fabricated and no recording exists, as the crew may have been unconscious from loss of cabin pressure and the astronauts did not wear individual voice recorders. Any voice recording facility would have been without power since the breakup of the orbiter immediately separated the crew compartment from the power-generating fuel cells {{in the back of the}} vehicle. The impact of the shuttle with the sea would have killed any still surviving astronauts on board, though they may have died before the impact of other causes.|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Macrotermitinae mounds could hold the key for designing a naturally ventilated human habitation using the sustainable Solar and Wind energies. Few {{attempts were made to}} mimic these structures into man build structures to achieve natural ventilation. Yet the limited understanding of the ventilation mechanisms applied in these mounds and the lack of fully developed building technologies capable of implementing such complex designs have prevented its further implementation in human habitation. A number of ventilation mechanisms were proposed, however, they are yet to be established. A prerequisite for a thorough understanding of the ventilation mechanism is the comprehension {{of the role of the}} mound skin in controlling of ventilation. This thesis focused on studying the flow through the porous mound skin into and out of the mound interior and the flow around the external skin surface. The Macrotermes michaelseni mound structure was visualised and studied in detail by means of field experiments to reveal its plaster-filled internal structure and digital scanning of a plaster-filled mound. The dimensions and interconnectivity of the internal conduits were examined to establish the source of maximum flow resistance. The mound skin and the built-in egress channels were found to be responsible for the bulk of the flow resistance. Computational Fluid dynamics CFD was used to predict the flow rates through the mound skin structure and the internal and external flow patterns. A series of Micro-CFD simulations were conducted to examine the effect of egress channel on the predicted flow rate through the porous mound skin. The effect of the mound conical shape on the external pressure distribution and flow patterns around and within the mound were predicted by Macro-CFD simulation. Wind tunnel experiments were conducted to validate the Macro-CFD analysis. Egress channels are present across the height of the mound stemming from a network of surface conduits that is directly below the mound skin. The surface conduits are highly connected to each other, to the mound central chimney and to the nest structure via peripheral subterranean conduits creating a highly connected network of <b>air</b> conduits. <b>Egress</b> channels keep the mound internal conduits separate from the ambient environment under normal conditions of dry weather. These channels are opened to the skin external surface under rainy conditions to compensate for mound skin diminished air permeability. The flow through the mound skin with closed egress channels is highly sensitive to changes in the egress channel depth from the external skin surface rather than changes in the skin thickness. Closed egress channels within the mound skin doubles the flow rate through the mound. This exceeds the amount necessary for the colony metabolism to allow for part of the inflow to circulate the mound conduits and leave without reaching the subterranean nest structure. Open egress channels increase the flow rate by 1. 3 times that of closed egress channels which is necessary during rainy conditions where the mound skin is impermeable. The mound spire is the most efficient in capturing air flow into the mound allowing just under 70...|$|R
