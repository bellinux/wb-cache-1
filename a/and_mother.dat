Tests of interobserver reliability resulted in acceptable agreement between observers, but a somewhat lower level of agreement between observers <b>and</b> <b>mothers.</b> The scale showed a good capacity to discriminate between infant gestational ages and can be used for helping mothers to identify their infants' emerging competence...|$|R

40|$|In this {{longitudinal}} study, two {{research questions}} were examined. First, differences in parenting behaviour between fathers <b>and</b> <b>mothers</b> were studied. Fathers <b>and</b> <b>mothers</b> were each (separately) observed {{with their two}} children, aged 2 and 4 years, in three structured situations: one puzzle task and two game tasks. Three parenting dimensions were coded: overinvolvement, rejection, and challenging behaviour. Fathers showed more challenging behaviour towards their youngest child than <b>mothers,</b> <b>and</b> <b>mothers</b> showed more overinvolvement towards this child. Fathers <b>and</b> <b>mothers</b> {{did not differ significantly}} in these parenting behaviours towards their oldest child. Rejection appeared not usable. The second research question was whether the effect of parenting behaviour on subsequent social anxiety of the children differed between fathers <b>and</b> <b>mothers.</b> Social anxiety was measured on two occasions by observing the child's response to a stranger. Regression analyses revealed no predictive relations of early social anxiety and of paternal and maternal overinvolvement to subsequent social anxiety of the oldest child. However, mother's challenging behaviour predicted more subsequent social anxiety, and father's challenging behaviour predicted less subsequent social anxiety of the oldest child. For the youngest child, maternal and paternal parenting behaviour did not predict subsequent social anxiety, but early social anxiety marginally predicted later social anxiety, in both parental models. The findings suggest that fathers <b>and</b> <b>mothers</b> may play different roles in the development and prevention of social anxiety in their children, and that fathers' role deserves special attention...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This study {{examined}} the influence of neonatal nursery design on interactions between nurses <b>and</b> <b>mothers</b> of infants in the nursery. Design and methods: We used a natural quasi-experimental design, using semi-structured interviews and a structured measure of mothers' and nurses' perceptions of nursing care, to compare mothers (n = 26 and n = 40) and nurses (n = 22 and n = 29) in an open-bay (OB) nursery and a single family room (SFR) nursery. Thematic {{analysis was used to}} generate key themes from the interviews. Results: <b>Mothers</b> <b>and</b> nurses in both nursery designs talked about Valuing interactions; the importance of interactions between <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> nurses. <b>Mothers</b> <b>and</b> nurses described SFRs as providing a space, My/their room, which enhanced mothers' sense of control and connection with the infant. SFRs were also associated with Changing the norms of interactions with nurses <b>and</b> other <b>mothers,</b> which created challenges in the desired quantity and quality of interactions for <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> nurses. Nurses in the SFR nursery also reported Enhanced interactions, including improved confidentiality <b>and</b> personalized communication. <b>Mothers</b> in the OB nursery reported more supportive mothering actions from nurses than mothers in the SFR nursery. Both <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> nurses in the OB nursery also talked about Our nursery community, which captured the value of having other nurses <b>and</b> <b>mothers</b> in the rooms. Conclusion: <b>Mothers</b> <b>and</b> nurses perceived that the SFR nursery enhanced privacy and maternal closeness for mothers compared to the OB nursery. However, the SFR nursery design presented challenges to some interactions of value to nurses <b>and</b> <b>mothers...</b>|$|R
