PLC-based networks can reduce project cost and schedule by enabling localized aircraft modifications and leveraging existing aircraft wiring for the Ethernet medium. PLC standards continue to evolve and achieve greater throughput rates and noise mitigation. Ethernet communications have been tested over AC and DC power busses, data busses, and discrete wiring. PLC networks have been successfully demonstrated in avionics test beds and aircraft (including live video transfers) without causing interference to the basic systems or the underlying wiring functionality.

This paper addresses the problem of energy consumption in a Metro <b>Ethernet</b> <b>network.</b> <b>Ethernet</b> technology deployments have been increasing tremendously because of their simplicity and low cost. However, much research remains to be conducted to address energy efficiency in <b>Ethernet</b> <b>networks.</b> In this paper, we propose a novel Energy Aware Forwarding Strategy for Metro <b>Ethernet</b> <b>networks</b> based on a modification of the Internet Energy Aware Routing (EAR) algorithm. Our contribution identifies the set of links to turn off and maintain links with minimum energy impact on the active state. Our proposed algorithm could be a superior choice for use in networks with low saturation, as it involves a tradeoff between maintaining good network performance and minimizing the active links in the network. Performance evaluation shows that, at medium load traffic, energy savings of 60 % can be achieved. At high loads, energy savings of 40 % can be achieved without affecting the network performance...|$|R
40|$|Ethernet is a {{dominant}} {{local area network}} (LAN) technology from last three decades. Today most LANs are switched <b>Ethernet</b> <b>networks.</b> Spanning tree protocol is a vital protocol for smooth operation of switched <b>Ethernet</b> <b>networks.</b> However the current standard of spanning tree protocol for Ethernet – commonly known as Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol or in short RSTP – is highly susceptible to classical count-to-infinity problem. This problem adversely effects the network convergence time, depending upon how long count-to-infinity situation persists in the network, and thus leads to network congestion and packet loss. In the worst case, even forwarding loops may be induced that further enhances the network congestion. Thus, the dependability of RSTP controlled <b>Ethernet</b> <b>networks</b> are highly questionable due to its vulnerability against the count-to-infinity problem. This paper first discusses the count-to-infinity problem in spanning tree controlled <b>Ethernet</b> <b>networks,</b> in general and in RSTP controlled <b>Ethernet</b> <b>networks,</b> in particular. Then this paper proposes a simple solution to overwhelm this problem efficiently...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- The {{protection}} switching technology is widely {{adopted in the}} fiber-optical transmission equipments based on TDM(Time Division Multiplexing), such as PDH, SDH/SONET. A variety of {{protection switching}} algorithms for <b>Ethernet</b> <b>networks</b> and the progress of standardization are summarized in the document. There are several kinds of protection switching algorithms for <b>Ethernet</b> <b>networks,</b> such as STP, RSTP, MSTP and etc. However, since Ethernet signal move through detour route, it causes much time to recover. Accordingly, {{it is difficult to}} secure a usability of <b>Ethernet</b> <b>networks</b> and QOS(Quality of Service). Also, if the protection switching protocol standardized by IEEE and ITU-T is used, it remains a inherent network switching time for protection. Therefore, a specific protection switching algorithm for Ethernet are needed for seamless and stable operation of <b>Ethernet</b> <b>networks</b> service for Distribution Automation System(DAS). A reliable protection algorithm with no switching delay time is very important to implement Self-healing service for DAS. This study of FPGA based protection switching algorithm for <b>Ethernet</b> <b>networks</b> shows that in case of faults occurrence on distribution power network, immediate fault isolation and restoration are conducted through interaction with distribution equipments using P 2 P(Peer to Peer) communication for protection coordination.
