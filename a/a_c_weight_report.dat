Residents who lived near properties in foreclosure from 2007 to 2012 lost an estimated collective $ 2. 2 trillion in property values, local governments tax base declined, and affected communities experienced an increase in crime and blight. In {{the aftermath of the}} foreclosure crisis, little is known about how the foreclosure crisis affected the health of homeowners who lost their homes to foreclosure and the health of residents living in communities hit hard by the crisis. This dissertation, made up of three papers, first explores the explicit and implicit theories evoked by the literature in this space, and then empirically tests the hypothesis that the foreclosure crisis had spillover effects on health. The first paper systematically reviews the existing, early-stage research on foreclosures and health by presenting an organizational schema based on level of analysis, type of housing distress measure, and health outcome. In addition, the review describes the specific mechanisms linking foreclosures and health, and how this field aligns and departs from the larger body of work on recessions and health.

40|$|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: We {{developed}} KDT 501, a novel substituted 1, 3 -cyclopentadione chemically {{derived from}} hop extracts, and evaluated it in various in vitro and {{in vivo models}} of diabetes and insulin sensitivity. METHODS: KDT 501 was evaluated for anti-inflammatory effects in monocyte/macrophage cells; agonistic activity for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR); lipogenesis and gene expression profile in human subcutaneous adipocytes. Body composition, glucose, insulin sensitivity, and lipids were assessed in diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice and Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats after oral administration. RESULTS: KDT 501 mediated lipogenesis in 3 T 3 L 1 and human subcutaneous adipocytes; however, the gene expression profile of KDT 501 differed {{from that of the}} full PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone, suggesting that KDT 501 has pleiotropic biological activities. In addition, KDT 501 showed only modest, partial PPARγ agonist activity and exhibited anti-inflammatory effects in monocytes/macrophages that were not observed with rosiglitazone. In a DIO mouse model, oral administration of KDT 501 significantly reduced fed blood glucose, glucose/insulin AUC following an oral glucose bolus, and body fat. In ZDF rats, oral administration of KDT 501 significantly reduced fed glucose, fasting plasma glucose, and glucose AUC after an oral glucose bolus. Significant, dose-dependent reductions of plasma hemoglobin <b>A</b> 1 <b>c,</b> <b>weight</b> gain, total cholesterol, and triglycerides were also observed in animals receiving KDT 501.

For PIO or high-adherence insulin, QALYs were virtually unchanged, and costs/life-year versus moderate-adherence insulin increased by $ 69 and $ 87, respectively. Conclusions: This long-term simulation demonstrated that ExQW treatment may decrease rates of cardiovascular and some microvascular complications of T 2 DM. Increased QALYs, and decreased costs were also projected. Keywords: diabetes, modeling, exenatide, pioglitazone, insulin, cardiovascular ris...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE - The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{predictors}} of intensification of antihyperglycemic therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes; its impact on <b>A</b> 1 <b>C,</b> body <b>weight,</b> symptoms of anxiety/depression, and health status; and patient characteristics associated with improvement in <b>A</b> 1 <b>C.</b> RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - We analyzed survey, medical record, and health plan administrative data collected in Translating Research into Action for Diabetes (TRIAD). We examined patients who were using diet/exercise or oral antihyperglycemic medications at baseline, had <b>A</b> 1 <b>C</b> > 7. 2 %, and stayed with the same therapy or intensified therapy (initiated or increased the number of classes of oral antihyperglycemic medications or began insulin) over 18 months. RESULTS - Of 1, 093 patients, 520 intensified therapy with oral medications or insulin. Patients intensifying therapy were aged 58 ± 12 years, had diabetes duration of 11 ± 9 years, and had <b>A</b> 1 <b>C</b> of 9. 1 ± 1. 5 %. Younger age and higher <b>A</b> 1 <b>C</b> were associated with therapy intensification. Compared with patients who did not intensify therapy, those who intensified therapy experienced a 0. 49 % reduction in <b>A</b> 1 <b>C</b> (P < 0. 0001), a 3 -pound increase in weight (P = 0. 003), and no change in anxiety/depression (P = 0. 5) or health status (P = 0. 2). Among those who intensified therapy, improvement in <b>A</b> 1 <b>C</b> was associated with higher baseline <b>A</b> 1 <b>C,</b> older age, black race/ethnicity, lower income, and more physician visits. CONCLUSIONS - Treatment intensification improved glycemic control with no worsening of anxiety/depression or health status, especially in elderly, lower-income, and minority patients with type 2 diabetes. Interventions are needed to overcome clinical inertia when patients might benefit from treatment intensification and improved glycemic control. © 2009 by the American Diabetes Association...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} was conducted over a 56 days period with 60 New zealand white crossbred post weaned young rabbits aged about 4 - 5 weeks having an initial average live weight of 418 - 438 g whose mothers fed diets containing 13. 17, 16. 64 and 21. 00 % CP. The young rabbits were fed concentrate diets containing 16. 64 % CP along with ad libitum green grass (Hymenachne pseudointerrupta). According {{to their mother}} diets, they were assigned into 3 experimental groups (<b>A,</b> B & <b>C)</b> The average dry matter intake was significantly (P< 0. 01) higher in the rabbits of group B than group <b>A</b> & <b>C.</b> Live <b>weight</b> gain was significantly (P< 0. 01) higher in group C (16. 6 g/day) than group A (8. 7 g/day) and B (14. 6 g/day). The young rabbits of group C converted feed to meat more efficiently than group A & B. So, it may be suggested that for better post weaned litter performance, concentrate mixtures containing 21. 00 % CP diet along with ad libitum green grass may be provided to rabbit does during their pregnancy and weaning period under tropical conditions...|$|R
40|$|PurposeThe {{purpose of}} this study is to explore the impact and {{feasibility}} of a pilot Community Health Worker (CHW) intervention to improve diabetes management among Bangladeshi-American individuals with Type 2 diabetes living in New York City. MethodsParticipants were recruited at clinic- and community-based venues. The intervention consisted of six monthly, CHW facilitated group sessions on topics related to management of diabetes. Surveys were collected at baseline and follow-up time points. Study outcomes included clinical, behavioral, and satisfaction measures for participants, as well as qualitative measures from CHWs. ResultsImprovements were seen in diabetes knowledge, exercise and diet to control diabetes, frequency of checking feet, medication compliance, and self-efficacy of health and physical activity from baseline to 12 months. Additionally, there were decreases in <b>A</b> 1 <b>C,</b> <b>weight,</b> and BMI. Program evaluation revealed a high acceptability of the intervention, and qualitative findings indicated that CHWs helped overcome barriers and facilitated program outcomes through communal concordance, trust and leadership. ConclusionsThe intervention demonstrated high acceptability and suggested efficacy in improving diabetes management outcomes among Bangladeshi immigrants in an urban setting. The U. S. Bangladeshi population will continue to increase, and given the high rates of diabetes, as well as linguistic and economic barriers faced by this community, effective and culturally-tailored health interventions are needed to overcome barriers and provide support for diabetes management.

Now what happens if the number of errors is greater than t? Clearly there will always be cases where a unique decoding will not occur. For instance if d is odd and <b>a</b> codeword <b>c</b> has <b>weight</b> d, any element x of weight (d[*]+[*] 1)[*]/[*] 2 (which support the set of non zero coordinates) is included in the support of c, will be at distance (d[*]+[*] 1)[*]/[*] 2 of two codewords: x and (0, 0, …, 0), which gives two possibilities for decoding. Meanwhile if one considers a random element of weight (d[*]+[*] 1)[*]/[*] 2 the probability that such a situation occurs is very unlikely. A closer look at probabilities leads to the fact that in fact even for larger t (but with t bounded by a certain bound, called the Johnson bound) the probability of a random element to be incorrectly decoded is in fact very small.|$|R
40|$|This article {{proposes a}} model to predict {{uniaxial}} and multiaxial ratcheting life by addressing the three primary parameters that influence failure life: fatigue damage, ratcheting damage and the multiaxial loading path. These three factors are addressed in the present model by (a) the stress amplitude for fatigue damage, (b) mean stress-dependent Goodman equation for ratcheting damage and (<b>c)</b> <b>an</b> inherent <b>weight</b> factor based on average equivalent stress {{to account for the}} multiaxial loading. The proposed model requires only two material constants which can be easily determined from uniaxial symmetric stress-controlled fatigue tests. Experimental ratcheting life data collected from the literature for 1025 and 42 CrMo steel under multiaxial proportional and nonproportional constant amplitude loading ratcheting with triangular sinusoidal and trapezoidal waveform (i. e. linear, rhombic, circular, elliptical and square stress paths) have shown good agreement with the proposed model...|$|R

40|$|Objective To measure {{effectiveness}} of liraglutide in reducing glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1 <b>C),</b> <b>weight,</b> and {{systolic blood pressure}} (SBP) in Emirati patients. Design A retrospective cohort study. Setting Endocrinology clinic in a 300 -bed military hospital. Patients A total of 152 patients who qualified for liraglutide between September 21, 2012, (first patient visit) and May 5, 2014 (last patient visit). Methods Team collected demographic and clinical data using a standard form. Data keeper performed univariate analyses to measure the effect of liraglutide in reducing the three outcomes of interest; namely, HbA 1 <b>C,</b> <b>weight,</b> and SBP. Results One hundred patients had {{at least the first}} visit in the clinic and 98 patients came for a second follow-up visit while on the medication. Adherence of clinicians to the internal criteria for prescribing liraglutide was 92 %. Patients' ages were 47. 9 ± 11. 7 years. Male-to-female ratio was almost 1 : 1. Overall, in the paired analyses, HbA 1 C decreased from first to second visits (8. 7 ± 1. 9 vs. 7. 6 ± 1. 8, P 0. 05). Conclusions Liraglutide is effective in reducing HbA 1 <b>C,</b> <b>weight,</b> and to <b>a</b> lesser extent, SBP in Emirati patients...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of the duodenal, jejunal, and ileal mucosal mass was studied in five groups of rats killed at different ages during growth. After sacrifice, the small bowel {{was removed from the}} pylorus through the ileocecal valve, measured and divided into three equal segments (<b>A,</b> B, <b>C).</b> Gut <b>weight,</b> mucosal weight, DNA, protein, and sucrase activity were determined in each segment. For each segment, results of all mucosal mass parameters expressed per centimeter of gut length markedly increased during weaning (15 - 30 days), and at 40 days of age they were similar to those obtained in adult animals. A proximal to distal gradient of gut weight was present at birth and increased during lactation. However, the proximodistal gradients of mucosal weight and mucosal DNA per centimeter of length remained constant in all groups studied. The intestinal gradient of sucrase activity was absent at birth and in lactating rats (17 days), but was similar in rats of 30, 40, and 100 days of age. It was concluded that mucosal hyperplasia which occurs in rats at weaning equally develops in the proximal, mid, and distal small bowel...|$|R
