40|$|Gratings enable light {{coupling}} into {{an optical}} cavity without transmission through any substrate. This concept reduces light absorption and substrate heating and was suggested for light coupling into the arm cavities of future gravitational wave detectors. One particularly interesting approach {{is based on}} all-reflective gratings with low <b>diffraction</b> efficiencies <b>and</b> <b>three</b> <b>diffraction</b> orders (<b>three</b> ports). However, it was discovered that, generally, three-port grating coupled cavities show an asymmetric resonance profile that results in asymmetric and low quality Pound-Drever-Hall error signals for cavity length control. We experimentally demonstrate that this problem is solved by the detection of light at both reflection ports of the cavity and the postprocessing of the two demodulated electronic signals...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} an infinite periodic array of dielectric rods in vacuum {{with the aim}} to demonstrate three types of a Bloch bound states in the continuum (BSC), symmetry protected with a zero Bloch vector, embedded into one diffraction channel with nonzero Bloch vector, and embedded into two <b>and</b> <b>three</b> <b>diffraction</b> channels. The first and second types of the BSC exist {{in a wide range}} of material parameters of the rods, while the third occurs only at a specific value of the radius of the rods.

The most simple symmetry protected TE and TM polarized BSCs have m= 0 and β= 0 and occur {{in a wide range}} of the radius of the spheres and dielectric constant. More complicated BSCs with m≠ 0 and β= 0 exist only for a selected radius of spheres at a fixed dielectric constant. We also find robust Bloch BSCs with β≠ 0, m= 0.

In this paper {{the applicability of the}} CNOSSOS-EU guidelines in terms of assessing the level-time history of moving sound sources is investigated. Generally, major changes in noise level occur due to shadowing effects. Therefore, the focus of investigation lies on the diffraction model.

The comparison shows an overestimation of the level by the diffraction model in case of double diffraction, while in the single diffraction case an underestimation occurs. The deviation between the Discontinuous-Galerkin and the geometric model in case of partial diffraction is below 3 dB. In terms of level history, the geometric diffraction model shows an unrealistic discontinuity when the model switches between the single and double diffraction case.

40|$|Electromagnetic bound {{states in}} the {{radiation}} continuum are studied for periodic double arrays of subwavelength dielectric cylinders in TM polarization. They are similar to localized waveguide mode solutions of Maxwell's equations for metal cavities or defects of photonic crystals, but, {{in contrast to the}} latter, their spectrum lies in the radiation continuum. The phenomenon is identical to the existence of bound sates in the radiation continuum in quantum mechanics, discovered by von Neumann and Wigner. In the formal scattering theory, these states appear as resonances with the vanishing width. For the system studied, the bound states are shown to exist at specific distances between the arrays in the spectral region where one or two diffraction channels are open. Analytic solutions are obtained for all bound states (below the radiation continuum and in it) in the limit of thin cylinders (the cylinder radius is much smaller than the wavelength). The existence of bound states is also established in the spectral region where <b>three</b> <b>and</b> more <b>diffraction</b> channels are open, provided the cylinders' dielectric constant and radius are fine-tuned. The near field and scattering resonances of the structure are investigated when the distance between the arrays varies in the neighborhood of its critical values at which the bound states are formed. In particular, it is shown that the near field in the scattering process becomes significantly amplified in specific regions of the array as the distance approaches its critical values. The effect may be used to control optical non-linear effects by varying the distance between the arrays near its critical values. Comment: Copyright (2010) American Institute of Physics.

40|$|This {{research}} is {{a contribution to}} the characterisation of porous space in sedimentary rocks. This was done by the study of capillary equilibrium in twenty different samples of which the texture was well known, belonging to various geological and geographical layers. Petrographical characteristics of the studied rocks have been defined by using various classical methods such as: visual observation, thin sections, pictures obtained by scanning electron microscope <b>and</b> x-ray <b>diffraction.</b> <b>Three</b> petrophysical parameters were mesured: the porosity, the permeability and the formation factor. The texture analysis was conceived using two different technics, each based on the distribution of a pair of non miscible fluids (air-water and mercury-mercury vapour) in the porous environment. The used methods are restored states and mercury porosimetry. This permits obtaining the capillary pressure curves as a function of saturation (Pf and porosimetry curves). Several parameters related to the porous space geometry can be deducted from these curves, such as the decomposition of the porosity in 2 parts: The macroporosity (access radius > 1 µm) and the microporosity (access radius 1 µm) et la microporosité (rayon d'accès < 1 µm), ainsi que le rayon moyen d'accès de chacune d'elles. Les échantillons ont été ensuite répartis dans deux catégories : les monoporeux et les biporeux. La combinaison des mesures pétrophysiques et des paramètres issus des courbes de pression capillaire a permis l'obtention de nombreuses corrélations entre les différents facteurs. La confrontation entre l'observation des échantillons au MEB et les courbes de pression capillaire assimilées à des hyperboles d'équation Y = A/X a montré que le facteur A est en relation directe avec le mode de la répartition des accès des pores.

40|$|Michelson-type laser-interferometric gravitational-wave (GW) {{observatories}} employ {{very high}} light powers {{as well as}} transmissively- coupled Fabry-Perot arm resonators in order to realize high measurement sensitivities. Due to the absorption in the transmissive optics, high powers lead to thermal lensing and hence to thermal distortions of the laser beam profile, which sets a limit on the maximal light power employable in GW observatories. Here, we propose and realize a Michelson-type laser interferometer with arm resonators whose coupling components are all-reflective second-order Littrow gratings. In principle such gratings allow high finesse values of the resonators but avoid bulk transmission of the laser light and thus the corresponding thermal beam distortion.
