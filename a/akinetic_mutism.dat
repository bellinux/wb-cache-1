2500|$|The {{most common}} {{symptoms}} of blockage is headache, with other symptoms including fainting fainting dementia, and coma, all associated with obstructive hydrocephalus {{of the affected}} side or sides. Hydrocephalus can be identified by a CT scan or MRI scan of the brain, and treatment involves a neurosurgical operation in which a tiny camera and tools are used to widen the foramen or create a new opening through the septum pellucidum between the lateral ventricles. [...] If an obstructing mass is thought unsuitable for such an approach, because it is too large or too difficult to remove, an open operation or the insertion of a artificial path between the ventricles and peritoneum may be required. Because of the intimate nature of pathways within the brain, such operations may result in damage to nearby structures, with complications including anterograde amnesia, inability to move half the body, <b>akinetic</b> <b>mutism</b> and disconnection syndromes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Akinetic</b> <b>mutism</b> {{can also}} {{occur as a}} result of damage to the mesencephalic region of the brain. Mesencephalic <b>akinetic</b> <b>mutism</b> is {{clinically}} categorized as somnolent or apathetic <b>akinetic</b> <b>mutism.</b> It is characterized by vertical gaze palsy and ophthalmoplegia. This state of <b>akinetic</b> <b>mutism</b> varies in intensity, but it is distinguished by drowsiness, lack of motivation, hyper-somnolence, and reduction in spontaneous verbal and motor actions.|$|E
50|$|Symptoms of <b>akinetic</b> <b>mutism</b> {{progress}} over time. The {{occurrence of}} <b>akinetic</b> <b>mutism</b> takes place approximately {{four months after}} the symptoms first appear.|$|E
40|$|As {{dementia}} progresses, {{the cognitive}} functioning of patients declines, and caregivers and other support staff gradually lose {{the means to}} communicate with them. However, some caregivers believe that patients can still recognize their surroundings even when they become <b>akinetic</b> with <b>mutism.</b> In this study, we observed eye-movements (preferential looking paradigm) to detect the presence of residual cognitive functions in a patient with severe frontotemporal dementia. The subject was a 76 -year-old female. At the time of observation, she had lost all spontaneous activities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging showed dense atrophy in the bilateral frontotemporal lobe, but the parieto–occipital lobe was preserved. A preferential looking paradigm {{was used in the}} experiment whereby two different faces (learned and non-learned) were simultaneously presented to the patient on a TV monitor. As a result, we found no significant differences in looking time between the two faces. However, when the saccade timing to the presented faces was examined, a much longer latency was observed for the right rather than {{the left side of the}} target faces. Even though the patient had lost all capacity for spontaneous activity, we were able to observe partial residual cognitive ability using the eye-movement paradigm...|$|R
50|$|<b>Akinetic</b> <b>mutism</b> can be misdiagnosed as depression, delirium, or locked-in syndrome, all {{of which}} are common {{following}} a stroke. Patients with depression can experience apathy, slurring of speech, and body movements similar to <b>akinetic</b> <b>mutism.</b> Similarly to <b>akinetic</b> <b>mutism,</b> patients with locked-in syndrome experience paralysis and can only communicate with their eyes. Correct diagnosis is important to ensure proper treatment. A variety of treatments for <b>akinetic</b> <b>mutism</b> have been documented, but treatments vary between patients and cases.|$|E
5000|$|The {{conditions}} of <b>Akinetic</b> <b>mutism</b> and Negative symptoms are closely related. In <b>Akinetic</b> <b>mutism,</b> a stroke or other lesion to the {{anterior cingulate cortex}} causes reduction in movement (akinetic) and speech (mutism).|$|E
50|$|<b>Akinetic</b> <b>mutism</b> varies {{across all}} patients. Its form, intensity, and {{clinical}} features correspond {{more closely to}} its functional anatomy rather than to its pathology. However, <b>akinetic</b> <b>mutism</b> most often appears in two different forms: frontal and mesencephalic.|$|E
50|$|In {{determining}} {{a diagnosis}} between with catatonia, <b>akinetic</b> <b>mutism,</b> and FCMS, a person must demonstrate {{their ability to}} perform voluntary function of the limbs. Patients with catatonia or <b>akinetic</b> <b>mutism</b> {{are not able to}} perform voluntary commands that involve the use of limbs, while patients with FCMS still possess voluntary usage of limbs. If a person can demonstrate ability in voluntary usage of limbs, catatonia and <b>akinetic</b> <b>mutism</b> are most likely ruled out from the diagnosis.|$|E
50|$|Symptoms of <b>akinetic</b> <b>mutism</b> {{suggest a}} {{possible}} presynaptic {{deficit in the}} nigrostriatal pathway, which transmits dopamine. Some patients with <b>akinetic</b> <b>mutism</b> have shown to improve with levodopa or dopamine agonist therapy, or by repleting dopamine in the motivational circuit with stimulants, antidepressants, or agonists such as bromocriptine or amantadine.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Akinetic</b> <b>mutism</b> {{can occur}} in the frontal region {{of the brain and}} occurs because of {{bilateral}} frontal lobe damage. <b>Akinetic</b> <b>mutism</b> as a result of frontal lobe damage is clinically characterized as hyperpathic. [...] It occurs in patients with bilateral circulatory disturbances in the supply area of the anterior cerebral artery.|$|E

50|$|Treatments using {{intravenous}} {{magnesium sulfate}} have shown {{to reduce the}} symptoms of <b>akinetic</b> <b>mutism.</b> In one case, a 59-year-old woman was administered intravenous magnesium sulfate {{in an attempt to}} resolve her <b>akinetic</b> <b>mutism.</b> The patient was given 500 mg of magnesium every eight hours, and improvement was seen after 24 hours. She became more verbal and attentive, and treatment was increased to 1000 mg every eight hours as conditions continued to improve.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Akinetic</b> <b>mutism</b> is {{a medical}} term {{describing}} patients tending neither to move (akinesia) nor speak (mutism). <b>Akinetic</b> <b>mutism</b> was first described in 1941 as a mental state where patients lack {{the ability to move}} or speak. However, their eyes may follow their observer or be diverted by sound. Patients lack most motor functions such as speech, facial expressions, and gestures, but demonstrate apparent alertness. They exhibit reduced activity and slowness, and can speak in whispered monosyllables. [...] Patients often show visual fixation on their examiner, move their eyes in response to an auditory stimulus, or move after often repeated commands. Patients with <b>akinetic</b> <b>mutism</b> are not paralyzed, but lack the will to move. Many patients describe that as soon as they 'will' or attempt a movement, a 'counter-will' or 'resistance' rises up to meet them.|$|E

50|$|Fourteen-year-old Elsie Nicks was {{the first}} patient to be {{diagnosed}} with <b>akinetic</b> <b>mutism</b> by Cairns in 1941. She suffered from severe headaches her entire life and was eventually given morphine to help with treatment. She began to enter a state of <b>akinetic</b> <b>mutism,</b> experiencing apathy and loss of speech and motor control. A cyst on her right lateral ventricle was tapped, {{and as soon as}} the needle advanced toward the cyst, she let out a loud noise and was able to state her name, age, and address. After her cyst was emptied, she regained her alertness and intelligence, and she had no recollection of her time spent in the hospital. The cyst was drained two more times over the next seven months and was eventually removed. After eight months of rehabilitation, Elsie no longer experienced headaches or <b>akinetic</b> <b>mutism</b> symptoms.|$|E
50|$|FCMS shares similar {{characteristics}} {{with the}} following disorders: catatonia, <b>akinetic</b> <b>mutism,</b> orbuccal apraxia, Broca’s aphasia, pseudobulbar palsy, bulbar palsy secondary to myasthenia gravis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and brainstem strokes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Akinetic</b> <b>mutism</b> {{is often}} the result of severe frontal lobe injury in which the pattern of {{inhibitory}} control is one of increasing passivity and gradually decreasing speech and motion.|$|E
50|$|As seen in {{the case}} of Elsie Nicks, the {{puncture}} or removal of a cyst causing <b>akinetic</b> <b>mutism</b> can relieve symptoms almost immediately. However, if the cyst fills up again, the symptoms can reappear.|$|E
50|$|<b>Akinetic</b> <b>mutism</b> is {{a symptom}} during {{the final stages of}} Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (a rare {{degenerative}} brain disease) and can help diagnose patients with this disease. It can also occur in a stroke that affects both anterior cerebral artery territories. Another cause is neurotoxicity due to exposure to certain drugs such as tacrolimus and cyclosporine.|$|E
50|$|A {{cerebrovascular}} accident (stroke) {{can lead to}} the thalamic syndrome, which involves a one-sided burning or aching sensation often accompanied by mood swings. Bilateral ischemia of the area supplied by the paramedian artery can cause serious problems including <b>akinetic</b> <b>mutism,</b> and be accompanied by oculomotor problems. A related concept is thalamocortical dysrhythmia. The occlusion of the artery of Percheron can lead to a bilateral thalamus infarction.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{cause of}} both {{akinesia}} and mutism is ablation of the cingulate gyrus. Destruction of the cingulate gyrus {{has been used}} in the treatment of psychosis. Such lesions result in akinesia, mutism, apathy, and indifference to painful stimuli. The anterior cingulate cortex is thought to supply a [...] "global energizing factor" [...] that stimulates decision making. When the anterior cingulate cortex is damaged, it can result in <b>akinetic</b> <b>mutism.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{anterior}} cingulate cortex (ACC) {{is involved}} in emotional drives, experience and integration. Associated cognitive functions include inhibition of inappropriate responses, decision making and motivated behaviours. Lesions in this area can lead to low drive states such as apathy, abulia or <b>akinetic</b> <b>mutism</b> and may also result in low drive states for such basic needs as food or drink and possibly decreased interest in social or vocational activities and sex.|$|E
50|$|The {{course of}} {{encephalitis}} lethargica can vary significantly between individuals, particularly when accompanied by preexisting or simultaneous diseases and disorders. It {{is characterized by}} high fever, sore throat, headache, lethargy, double vision, delayed physical and mental response, sleep inversion and catatonia. In severe cases, patients may enter a coma-like state (<b>akinetic</b> <b>mutism).</b> Patients may also experience abnormal eye movements ("oculogyric crises"), parkinsonism, upper body weakness, muscular pains, tremors, neck rigidity, and behavioral changes including psychosis. Klazomania (a vocal tic) is sometimes present.|$|E
5000|$|Aboulia or abulia (from βουλή, meaning [...] "will", {{with the}} prefix -a), in neurology, {{refers to a}} lack of will or {{initiative}} and {{can be seen as a}} disorder of diminished motivation (DDM). Aboulia falls in the middle of the spectrum of diminished motivation, with apathy being less extreme and <b>akinetic</b> <b>mutism</b> being more extreme than aboulia. A patient with aboulia is unable to act or make decisions independently. It may range in severity from subtle to overwhelming. It is also known as Blocq's disease (which also refers to abasia and astasia-abasia). Aboulia was originally considered to be a disorder of the will.|$|E
50|$|Blood-oxygen-level-dependent fMRI have {{demonstrated}} normal patterns of brain activity {{in a patient}} in a vegetative state following a severe traumatic brain injury when asked to imagine playing tennis or visiting rooms in his/her house. Differential brain imaging of patients with such global disturbances of consciousness (including <b>akinetic</b> <b>mutism)</b> reveal that dysfunction in a widespread cortical network including medial and lateral prefrontal and parietal associative areas {{is associated with a}} global loss of awareness. Impaired consciousness in epileptic seizures of the temporal lobe was likewise accompanied by a decrease in cerebral blood flow in frontal and parietal association cortex and an increase in midline structures such as the mediodorsal thalamus.|$|E
50|$|The {{anterior}} cingulate circuit {{consists of}} the anterior cingulate cortex, {{also referred to as}} Brodmann area 24, and its projections to the ventral striatum which includes the ventromedial caudate. The loop continues to connect to the ventral pallidum, which connects to the vental anterior nucleus of the thalamus. This circuit is essential for the initiation of behavior, motivation and goal orientation, which are the very things missing from a patient with a disorder of diminished motivation. Unilateral injury or injury along any point in the circuit leads to aboulia regardless of the side of the injury, but if there is bilateral damage, the patient will exhibit a more extreme case of diminished motivation, <b>akinetic</b> <b>mutism.</b>|$|E
50|$|Studying {{the effects}} of damage to the ACC {{provides}} insights into the type of functions it serves in the intact brain. Behavior {{that is associated with}} lesions in the ACC includes: inability to detect errors, severe difficulty with resolving stimulus conflict in a Stroop task, emotional instability, inattention, and <b>akinetic</b> <b>mutism.</b> There is evidence that damage to ACC is present in patients with schizophrenia, where studies have shown patients have difficulty in dealing with conflicting spatial locations in a Stroop-like task and having abnormal ERNs. Participants with ADHD were found to have reduced activation in the dorsal area of the ACC when performing the Stroop task. Together, these findings corroborate results from imaging and electrical studies about the variety of functions attributed to the ACC.|$|E
5000|$|Audrey's family {{contended that}} she was in a state called <b>akinetic</b> <b>mutism</b> — unable to speak and with limited movement, but fully alert and awake. However, Edward Kaye, the {{pediatric}} neurologist who treated her for eight years following the accident, told a Washington Post reporter that [...] "the cell death is about as bad as you can get and still be alive. Her EEGs are profoundly abnormal. She has brain stem activity, but very, very little above the brain stem." [...] A coma specialist, Ed Cooper, brought in by Linda Santo to help Audrey communicate with her hands, told CBS's 48 Hours in 1999, [...] "If she can become consistent with movements of her hands, down for 'yes,' up for 'no,' or vice versa, it would be meaningful. Right now it's inconsistent." ...|$|E
5000|$|Young acute lymphoblastic leukemia {{patients}} with methotrexate-induced leukoencephalopathy appear asymptomatic. However, toxic leukoencephalopathy induced by drug abuse or environmental toxins {{have had more}} damaging side effects. Heroin-induced leukoencephalopathy has had three stages described. The first stage features soft (pseudobulbar) speech, cerebellar ataxia, motor restlessness, and apathy/bradyphrenia. The intermediate stage includes pyramidal tract and pseudobulbar signs, spastic paresis, myoclonic jerks, and choreoathetoid movements. The final or terminal stage is characterized by stretching spasms, <b>akinetic</b> <b>mutism,</b> hypotonic paresis, central pyrexia, and death. Similarly, leukoencephalopathy induced by orally administered methotrexate for arthritis patients presents similar symptoms including ataxia, dysarthria, and seizures; however, long-term cognitive effects remain unknown. Symptoms of leukoencephalopathy caused by overdose of metronidazole medication include dysarthria, gait disturbance, weakness of extremities, and mental confusion. [...] Despite the pharmacological agent or source of toxicity, some patients completely recover from toxic leukoencephalopathy.|$|E
