5|$|Astronomers use the WHT {{to conduct}} {{scientific}} research across most branches of observational <b>astronomy,</b> including solar system science, galactic <b>astronomy,</b> extragalactic <b>astronomy</b> and cosmology. Most {{of the instruments}} {{are designed to be}} useful for a range of different research.|$|E
5|$|<b>Astronomy</b> {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} of the natural sciences. The early civilizations in {{recorded}} history, such as the Babylonians, Greeks, Indians, Egyptians, Nubians, Iranians, Chinese, Maya, and many ancient Indigenous Peoples of The Americas performed methodical observations of the night sky. Historically, <b>astronomy</b> has included disciplines as diverse as astrometry, celestial navigation, observational <b>astronomy</b> and the making of calendars, but professional <b>astronomy</b> is now often considered to be synonymous with astrophysics.|$|E
5|$|During the 20th century, {{the field}} of {{professional}} <b>astronomy</b> split into observational and theoretical branches. Observational <b>astronomy</b> is focused on acquiring data from observations of astronomical objects, which is then analyzed using basic principles of physics. Theoretical <b>astronomy</b> is oriented toward the development of computer or analytical models to describe astronomical objects and phenomena. The two fields complement each other, with theoretical <b>astronomy</b> seeking to explain observational results and observations being used to confirm theoretical results.|$|E
5|$|Partly because 2009 was {{the fourth}} centenary of Galileo's first {{recorded}} astronomical observations with the telescope, the United Nations scheduled {{it to be the}} International Year of <b>Astronomy.</b> A global scheme was laid out by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), also endorsed by UNESCO—the UN body responsible for educational, scientific and cultural matters. The International Year of <b>Astronomy</b> 2009 was intended to be a global celebration of <b>astronomy</b> and its contributions to society and culture, stimulating worldwide interest not only in <b>astronomy</b> but science in general, with a particular slant towards young people.|$|E
5|$|Radio <b>astronomy</b> uses {{radiation}} {{outside the}} visible range with wavelengths greater than approximately one millimeter. Radio <b>astronomy</b> {{is different from}} most other forms of observational <b>astronomy</b> in that the observed radio waves can be treated as waves rather than as discrete photons. Hence, it is relatively easier to measure both the amplitude and phase of radio waves, whereas this is not as easily done at shorter wavelengths.|$|E
5|$|AMiBA is {{the result}} of a {{collaboration}} between the Academia Sinica Institute of <b>Astronomy</b> and Astrophysics, the National Taiwan University and the Australia Telescope National Facility. It also involves researchers from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, the National Radio <b>Astronomy</b> Observatory, the University of Hawaii, the University of Bristol, Nottingham Trent University, the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics and the Carnegie-Mellon University.|$|E

5|$|Despite her {{progress}} in the field, Alexander only ever considered radio <b>astronomy</b> a job {{and as soon as}} the war was over she returned to her passion of geology, never again working in radio <b>astronomy.</b> Alexander became the Geologist to the Government of Singapore in 1949, responsible for surveying the island and went on to publish a report in 1950 which included the first geological map of Singapore.|$|E
5|$|Erected at {{the behest}} of the Illinois General Assembly, the University of Illinois Observatory became {{important}} in the development of <b>astronomy</b> due, in large part, to pioneering research by Dr. Stebbins, from 1907 to 1922. Joel Stebbins left the University of Illinois in 1922 but left behind a legacy of discovery that helped alter the face of modern <b>astronomy.</b> The building served the University of Illinois <b>astronomy</b> department from its opening until 1979, when the department moved into a new, larger building to house its growing staff.|$|E

Students Involved in Fostering Tolerance (SIFT) works to promote tolerance and diversity through awareness field trips and fundraisers.|$|E
5|$|Historically, optical <b>astronomy,</b> {{also called}} visible light <b>astronomy,</b> {{is the oldest}} form of <b>astronomy.</b> Images of {{observations}} were originally drawn by hand. In the late 19th century {{and most of the}} 20th century, images were made using photographic equipment. Modern images are made using digital detectors, particularly using charge-coupled devices (CCDs) and recorded on modern medium. Although visible light itself extends from approximately 4000 Å to 7000 Å (400 nm to 700nm), that same equipment can be used to observe some near-ultraviolet and near-infrared radiation.|$|E
5|$|In 1589, he was {{appointed}} to the chair of mathematics in Pisa. In 1591, his father died, and he was entrusted with the care of his younger brother Michelagnolo. In 1592, he moved to the University of Padua where he taught geometry, mechanics, and <b>astronomy</b> until 1610. During this period, Galileo made significant discoveries in both pure fundamental science (for example, kinematics of motion and <b>astronomy)</b> as well as practical applied science (for example, strength of materials and pioneering the telescope). His multiple interests included the study of astrology, which at the time was a discipline tied to the studies of mathematics and <b>astronomy.</b>|$|E

5|$|Rubin was {{inspired}} to pursue an undergraduate education at the currently all-women's school, Vassar College, because Maria Mitchell had been a professor there. She also ignored advice she had received from a high school science teacher to avoid a scientific career and become an artist. She earned her bachelor's degree in <b>astronomy</b> in 1948, the only graduate in <b>astronomy</b> that year. She attempted to enroll in a graduate program at Princeton, but was barred due to her gender. Princeton would not accept women as <b>astronomy</b> graduate students for 27 more years. Rubin also turned down an offer from Harvard University due to her husband, Robert Rubin's, position {{as a graduate student}} at Cornell University.|$|E

5|$|Since archaeoastronomers {{disagree}} {{so widely}} on {{the characterization of}} the discipline, they even dispute its name. All three major international scholarly associations relate archaeoastronomy {{to the study of}} culture, using the term <b>Astronomy</b> in Culture or a translation. Michael Hoskin sees {{an important part of the}} discipline as fact-collecting, rather than theorizing, and proposed to label this aspect of the discipline Archaeotopography. Ruggles and Saunders proposed Cultural <b>Astronomy</b> as a unifying term for the various methods of studying folk astronomies. Others have argued that <b>astronomy</b> is an inaccurate term, what are being studied are cosmologies and people who object to the use of logos have suggested adopting the Spanish cosmovisión.|$|E

5|$|The Students' Observatory was {{constructed}} in 1886 on the Berkeley campus, with the original funds provided by the California legislature {{in order for the}} observatory to provide practical training to civil engineers. Very quickly, the Students' Observatory became seen as a training ground for students studying <b>astronomy,</b> so that they would be better prepared to go on to use the facilities at Lick Observatory. This contributed to the separation of the departments of civil engineering and <b>astronomy</b> in the mid-1890s, with the Students' Observatory becoming the home of the Berkeley <b>Astronomy</b> Department.|$|E

5|$|The first {{director}} of the observatory was George W. Myers. Myers was an Champaign county native who graduated from the university in 1888. He remained as a mathematics instructor also teaching the spring Descriptive <b>Astronomy</b> course. In preparation for the directorship he {{spent two years in}} Munich earning his Ph.D in <b>astronomy.</b> In his first year as director, G.W. Myers announced the discovery of the source of the variability in the star Beta Lyrae at the opening conference for Yerkes Observatory. He served as director from 1897 until 1900 when he left for the University of Chicago. W.C. Brenke, an <b>astronomy</b> instructor, served as acting director until a new director was hired in 1903.|$|E
5|$|The first star {{catalogue}} in Greek <b>astronomy</b> {{was created by}} Aristillus in approximately 300 BC, {{with the help of}} Timocharis. The star catalog of Hipparchus (2nd century BC) included 1020 stars, and was used to assemble Ptolemy's {{star catalogue}}. Hipparchus is known for the discovery of the first recorded nova (new star). Many of the constellations and star names in use today derive from Greek <b>astronomy.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{observatory}} is {{no longer}} used for research purposes, though the telescope is still used as a teaching tool in the university's <b>astronomy</b> classes.

Between 2010 and 2014 annual events took place at the National Mall with coordination between Hofstra University and federal agencies including: the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, NASA, and the National Science Foundation. In 2015 an event took place in June at the National Mall, and then back at the White House again on October 19.|$|E
5|$|A common {{justification}} for the need for <b>astronomy</b> {{is the need to}} develop an accurate calendar for agricultural reasons. Ancient texts like Hesiod's Works and Days, an ancient farming manual, would appear to contradict this. Instead astronomical observations are used in combination with ecological signs, such as bird migrations to determine the seasons. Ethnoastronomical work with the Mursi of Ethiopia shows that haphazard <b>astronomy</b> continued until recent times {{in some parts of the}} world. All the same, calendars appear to be an almost universal phenomenon in societies as they provide tools for the regulation of communal activities.|$|E
