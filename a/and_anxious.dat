5|$|His reign {{was marked}} by {{multiple}} wars with the Lombards, a Germanic people who {{had arrived in the}} former Roman province of Pannonia under the leadership of their king, Audoin. Thurisind also had to face the hostility of the Byzantine Empire, which was resentful of the Gepid takeover of Sirmium <b>and</b> <b>anxious</b> to diminish Gepid power in the Pannonian Basin, a plain covering most of modern Hungary and partly including the bordering states. The Byzantines' plans to reduce the Gepids' power took effect when Audoin decisively defeated Thurisind in 551 or 552. The Byzantine Emperor Justinian forced a peace accord on both leaders so that equilibrium in the Pannonian Basin could be sustained.|$|E
5|$|Psycho {{has become}} one of the most {{recognizable}} films in cinema history, and is arguably Hitchcock's best known film. In his novel, Bloch used an uncommon plot structure: he repeatedly introduced sympathetic protagonists, then killed them off. This played on his reader's expectations of traditional plots, leaving them uncertain <b>and</b> <b>anxious.</b> Hitchcock recognized the effect this approach could have on audiences, and utilized it in his adaptation, killing off Leigh's character at the end of the first act. This daring plot device, coupled with the fact that the character was played by the biggest box-office name in the film, was a shocking turn of events in 1960.|$|E

5|$|The episode {{opens with}} an {{introductory}} {{glimpse of the}} aquatic town of Bikini Bottom. The audience is then introduced to SpongeBob SquarePants, an ecstatic, hyperactive, <b>and</b> <b>anxious</b> young sea sponge preparing to fulfill a lifelong dream and passion by applying for a fry cook job at the underwater fast food restaurant, the Krusty Krab, to the annoyance of the restaurant's cashier and SpongeBob's irritable neighbor, Squidward Tentacles. SpongeBob then gets nervous and almost reconsiders applying for {{a job at the}} restaurant until his best friend, a starfish named Patrick Star, convinces him otherwise. Humored with SpongeBob's vulnerability, gullibility, and impenetrable enthusiasm and innocence, both Squidward and the restaurant's proprietor, Mr. Eugene Krabs, decide to manipulate SpongeBob, whom they secretly consider unqualified for the position, by sending him on an impossible errand to purchase a seemingly non-existent high-caliber spatula.|$|E
5|$|Leo VI died in May 912 and was {{succeeded by}} his brother Alexander (r. 912–913), who reigned for {{little over a year}} before dying in June 913. Leo's empress, Zoe Karbonopsina, and his son and titular co-emperor, Constantine VII (r. 913–959), were sidelined during the reign of Alexander, who also {{restored}} Zoe's old adversary, Nicholas Mystikos, as Patriarch of Constantinople. Thus, at the death of Alexander (6 June 913), with Constantine VII not even eight years old, a power struggle ensued between Zoe and Patriarch Nicholas, who headed the regency council. It was at this point that Constantine Doukas launched a rebellion aiming for the throne. The Life of Euthymius hagiography, a source hostile to Patriarch Nicholas, reports that the Patriarch was also involved, although the other Byzantine sources include this as a widespread rumour rather than a fact. According to these sources, unaware that he would be appointed regent (Alexander named him to the regency council on his deathbed), fearful of losing his pre-eminent position, <b>and</b> <b>anxious</b> about the military threat posed by the Bulgarian Tsar Simeon, which required a more experienced hand {{at the helm of the}} state, the Patriarch summoned Doukas to assume the throne.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{has suggested that}} we tend to exhibit selective forgetting for information which is self threatening - an effect known as mnemic neglect. Three experiments are reported which examine mnemic neglect in repressors, low anxiety, high anxiety <b>and</b> defensive high <b>anxious</b> participants. In Experiment 1, repressors were found to forget more self threatening information than low anxious participants while high <b>anxious</b> <b>and</b> defensive high <b>anxious</b> remembered more. In Experiments 2 and 3 boundary conditions to the mnemic neglect effects were found to be present with repressors forgetting more self threatening information than low anxious participants for information that was unmodifiable (Experiment 2) and when this information was highly diagnostic (Experiment 3). High <b>anxious</b> <b>and</b> defensive high <b>anxious</b> participants, conversely, recalled more of this information. The findings indicate that repressors show enhanced mnemic neglect effects while high <b>anxious</b> <b>and</b> defensive high <b>anxious</b> participants show reversed effects...|$|R

25|$|The goal of {{cognitive}} behavior therapy {{is to help}} a patient reorganize thinking processes <b>and</b> <b>anxious</b> thoughts regarding an experience that provokes panic.

25|$|The {{relationship}} between naturism and sexuality is managed through social and spatial segregation. In commercial naturist resorts, eroticism and sexuality {{is controlled by}} applying hetero-normative values, and strict rules and policing. In other environments, eroticism is moderated through self-censorship of actions and behavior. This can make the practice of naturism an isolating, repressive, <b>and</b> <b>anxious</b> experience, rather than a liberating and social one.|$|E

40|$|Sex {{differences}} in {{primary and secondary}} psychopathic traits and behaviors are consistently evidenced, although less {{is known about the}} developmental trajectories of these differences and why they might arise. In this study (N = 362) we investigated whether men and women reporting higher levels of primary or secondary psychopathic traits differed in retrospective accounts of how cold and controlling both their mother and father were during childhood, <b>and</b> how <b>anxious</b> <b>and</b> avoidant they are about contemporary relationships. Primary psychopathic traits in men related to controlling mothers and avoidant attachment, whereas in women they related to uncaring fathers <b>and</b> both <b>anxious</b> <b>and</b> avoidant attachment. Secondary psychopathic traits in men were predicted by uncaring mothers and fathers, as well as anxious attachment, whereas in women, neither parental bonding nor attachment style were related. Results are discussed from an evolutionary, life history theory paradigm...|$|R

25|$|The {{secure and}} dismissive {{attachment}} styles {{are associated with}} higher self-esteem compared to the anxious and fearful attachment styles. This corresponds to the distinction between positive and negative thoughts about the self in working models. The secure <b>and</b> <b>anxious</b> attachment styles are associated with higher sociability than the dismissive or fearful attachment styles. This corresponds to the distinction between positive and negative thoughts about others in working models. These results suggested working models indeed contain two distinct domains—thoughts about self and thoughts about others—and that each domain {{can be characterized as}} generally positive or generally negative.|$|E
25|$|The Byzantines {{reached their}} lowest point under Phocas, with the Sassanids occupying {{the whole of}} the eastern Mediterranean.

Weakened by their quarrels, neither empire was prepared to deal with the onslaught of the Arabs, newly unified under the banners of Islam <b>and</b> <b>anxious</b> to expand their faith. By 650, Arab forces had conquered all of Persia, Syria, and Egypt.|$|E
25|$|Cross-sectional studies {{illustrate}} {{the link between}} emotional approach coping and positive psychological adjustment, under certain conditions in student and community samples.

In addition, women who reported higher dispositional emotional processing also reported fewer depressive <b>and</b> <b>anxious</b> symptoms and greater life satisfaction; while for men, higher dispositional emotional expression was linked to greater life satisfaction.|$|E
