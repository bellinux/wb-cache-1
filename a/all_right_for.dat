500|$|During the Iraq War Jackson {{admitted}} {{that the war was}} putting the service under strain, but called the claim that the Army was [...] "at breaking point", [...] "nonsense". Jackson was dismissive of claims that the Army was under-equipped, recalling his conversation with a soldier: [...] "There's a bit of a fuss going on about boots and bog rolls and whatnot. Are you <b>all</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> boots?" [...] He later conceded that this could be seen as [...] "cavalier", and that he [...] "had no intention of belittling the gravity of the situation", but that he [...] "didn't want {{to send a message to}} the enemy that we were in any way not ready". Known for speaking his mind, Jackson attracted media attention towards the end of his tenure as CGS in 2006, when he criticised Norman Kember for Kember's apparent lack of gratitude to the soldiers who freed him from Iraqi kidnappers.|$|E
500|$|When female team members, AOC members, and U.S. Army {{athletes and}} {{officials}} accompanying the team were assigned first-class cabins {{and the balance}} of the male athletes were relegated to troop quarters on lower decks, grumbling from team members quartered belowdecks began almost immediately. Before the Matoika even sailed, runner Joie Ray, a competitor in the 1500 meters in 1920, complained about the conditions declaring that [...] "if those in charge had deliberately tried to create a psychology of depression and resentment among the members of the team, they couldn't have done anything more effective". Two days after sailing, some of the first-place winners at the Olympic tryouts were moved to the sick bay to escape the sweltering heat on the lower decks, but the majority remained below. Fencer Joseph B. B. Parker—who, as an Army athlete, was bunked in a cabin—commented that the troop accommodations were <b>all</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> troops but [...] "not conducive to bringing men to the games [...] of condition." ...|$|E
500|$|While McKellen {{had made}} his sexual {{orientation}} known to fellow actors early on in his stage career, {{it was not until}} 1988 that he came out to the general public, in a programme on BBC Radio. The context that prompted McKellen's decision– overriding any concerns about a possible negative effect on his career– was that the controversial Section 28 of the Local Government Bill, known simply as Section 28, was then under consideration in the British Parliament. Section 28 proposed prohibiting local authorities from promoting homosexuality [...] "... as a kind of pretended family relationship". McKellen became active in fighting the proposed law, and, during a BBC Radio 3 programme where he debated Section 28 with the conservative journalist Peregrine Worsthorne, declared himself gay. McKellen has stated that he was influenced in his decision by the advice and support of his friends, among them noted gay author Armistead Maupin. In a 1998 interview that discusses the 29th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, McKellen commented, I have many regrets about not having come out earlier, but one of them might be that I didn't engage myself in the politicking. He has said of this period: My own participating in that campaign was a focus for people [...] take comfort that if Ian McKellen was on board for this, perhaps it would be <b>all</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> other people to be as well, gay and straight. Section 28 was, however, enacted and remained on the statute books until 2000 in Scotland and 2003 in England and Wales. Section 28 never applied in Northern Ireland.|$|E

He says that such conduct may be <b>all</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> the Navy but would not be tolerated by the Marines. The duty officer asks if Meadows had tried to escape, which they deny in order to avoid getting him into more trouble. He also notices that their orders were never officially signed by the master-at-arms in Norfolk, and says that they effectively have not left that station. The angry young Marine officer relents when Mulhall and Buddusky ask to speak to the XO (Executive Officer).|$|E

[...] It was said that Yang Meng was talented, and he often lamented the state of the affairs in Wu, which then was in effect controlled by the regent Xu Wen, stating, [...] "It is the state of my family's; is it <b>all</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> it to be taken over by others?"

2500|$|Blue Horse {{invariably}} dined with Burbank at {{noon and}} {{always had a}} good appetite. One day, after dinner, Burbank said to Blue Horse: [...] "I notice that you always eat everything in front of you, but you never pass your plate back the second time or ask for another cup of coffee. Why is that? Is it because you cannot eat any more or drink any more coffee. O, yes, he replied, I could eat more, but I thought the twenty-five cents you paid for my dinner was for just what was placed before me. No, I said, the twenty-five cents pays for all you can eat. Hereafter, if one plate is not enough, ask for more, and drink all the coffee you want. All right, he replied, I will. And he did. I also told him to tell his friends this, and suggested that if any white men sitting at his table left anything to eat on their plates before them, {{that it would be}} <b>all</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> him to gather it up and take it home for his wife and children. It is needless to say that all the Sioux Indians who patronized that hotel afterward got all that was coming to them.” One time Blue Horse was in the Indian trader's store with his little niece, who saw something on the shelves that she very much wanted. Blue Horse had no money, so he took off his old moccasins and gave them to the Indian trader in exchange for what the little girl craved and he walked home barefooted.|$|E
2500|$|Sackville-West and Trefusis eloped {{several times}} from 1918 on, mostly to France. While there Sackville-West {{dressed as a}} man when they went out together. The affair ended badly. The mothers of both women, Lady Sackville and Mrs. Keppel, joined forces to {{sabotage}} the relationship and force both women back to their husbands. Both women were deeply interested in Spain, especially the Spanish Romany, with Trefusis writing to Sackville-West that they should go to Spain to show [...] "you my pupil, I as your cicerone...I will show eyes of black velvet...the sevillana, the fandango, undulating bodies, throbbing castanets". In another letter, Trefusis wrote of her wish to live forever in Spain with Sackville-West, [...] "a world of sun and love, and singing, and dancing". Trefusis sought to appeal to Sackville-West's fascination with the Romany people by telling {{her that she was}} turning into a [...] "Gypsy", writing: [...] "They said, this evening after you gone, that you were like a dazzling Gypsy. A Gypsy potentate, a sovereign-what you will, but still a Gypsy". Trefusis and Sackville-West both used Romany phrases to express intensely held feelings such as man camelo tuti ("I can't live without you"), nonero jeli ("our love"), and sartute loude gayeres ("escape with you"). Both families were concerned that the women were creating scandal. In a letter to Nicolson dated 1 June 1919 explaining why she would not leave Trefusis, Sackville-West wrote: [...] "I never ought to marry you or anybody else; I ought just to have lived with you {{for as long as you}} wanted me...I ought never to have married until I was thirty. I really think that is the best solution for people like me. Women ought to have the freedom the same as men when they are young. It's a rotten and ridiculous system at present, it's simply cheating one of one's youth. It was <b>all</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> the Victorians. But this generation is disregarding, and next will have disregarded, the chrysalis." [...] At another point, Sackville-West wrote to Nicolson [...] "if wasn't for you, I would go off with V." [...] Trefusis continued to pursue Sackville-West to great lengths until Sackville-West's affairs with other women finally took their toll. In November 1919, while staying at Monte Carlo, Sackville-West wrote in her diary that she was [...] "down on" [...] herself with [...] "serious thoughts" [...] of suicide as she believed that Nicolson [...] "would be happier without" [...] her in the world. [...] The two women apparently made a bond to remain faithful to one another, meaning that although both were married, neither could engage in sexual relations with her own husband. Sackville-West, who already had two children by Nicholson, was prompted to end the affair when she heard allegations that Trefusis had been involved sexually with her own husband, indicating that she had broken their bond. When she decided to end the affair with Trefusis, Sackville-West again contemplated suicide, writing in her diary that she [...] "hated myself to the extent of thinking I better vanish" [...] from the world forever. Despite the rift, the two women were devoted to one another, and deeply in love. They continued to have occasional liaisons for a number of years afterwards, but never rekindled the affair.|$|E
