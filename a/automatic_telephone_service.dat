50|$|In {{the years}} after World War II {{customers}} were demanding modern <b>automatic</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>service.</b> These demands required rural telephone companies to improve service or sell to a company with greater capital to make the improvements. The owners of the Weare Telephone Company, Wilder and Iola Tenney, were frustrated by these demands and offered the company for sale. The Weare Telephone Company had been organized in 1904 and was franchised {{to operate in the}} towns of Weare and Deering.|$|E
50|$|The first {{widespread}} {{deployment of}} <b>automatic</b> mobile <b>telephone</b> <b>service</b> was the Advanced Mobile Phone System, introduced in October 1983 and discontinued {{in the early}} 21st century. It, like its successors, is direct-dial. Earlier radio manual mobile systems had a very limited number of mobile channels and required that calls to Mobile <b>Telephone</b> <b>Service</b> and ship-to-shore subscribers be placed via the mobile or marine operator.|$|R
40|$|Macrophone is a {{corpus of}} {{approximately}} 200, 000 utterances, recorded {{over the telephone}} from a broad sample of about 5, 000 American speakers. Sponsored by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC), {{it is the first}} of a series of similar data sets that will be colected for major languages of the world in a cooperative project called Polyphone. It is designed to provide telephone speech suitable for the development of <b>automatic</b> voice-interactive <b>telephone</b> <b>services.</b> In particular, Maerophone contains training material for applications in transportation, scheduling, ticketing, database access, shopping, and other automated telephone interactions. In addition to being phonetically balanced, the spoken material refers to times, locations, monetary amounts, and interactive operations. The utterances are spoken by respondents into telephone handset...|$|R
40|$|Everyday {{technologies}} (ETs) like {{microwave ovens}} and <b>automatic</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>services</b> {{as well as}} assistive technologies (ATs) are often used {{in the performance of}} everyday activities. As a consequence, the ability to manage technology is important. This pilot study aimed to clarify the applicability of a model for knowledge translation to support healthcare professionals, to support technology use among older adults with dementia and their significant others. An additional aim was to explore the process of translating the model into practice. The applicability of the model (comprising a one-day course, including introduction and provision of tools, followed by interviews during and after a period of practice) was clarified for 11 healthcare professionals using a constant comparative approach. The content of the model gave the participants an eye-opening experience of technology use among persons with dementia. They also described how they had incorporated the model as a new way of thinking which supported and inspired new investigations and collaborations with colleagues and significant others. This study provided an applicable model of how research knowledge about technology use can be translated into clinical practice and be used by healthcare professionals to support the use of technology for persons with dementia.

50|$|The {{history of}} {{telecommunications}} in Jordan {{can be traced}} back to early 1921. After the foundation of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, the Ministry of Post, Telegraph and Telephony was established which further developed the country's Telecommunications Services. In 1961, the first <b>automatic</b> <b>telephone</b> switch <b>service</b> was introduced utilizing an electromechanical switch with a capacity of approximately 5000 lines. In 1971, a new government-controlled body, the Telecommunications Corporation (T.C.C) was set up to take over the day-to-day running of the communications <b>services</b> such as <b>telephone,</b> telegraph and telex. Also a satellite earth station at Baqa'a was in operation using Intelsat facilities. From 1973 to 1985, Jordan Telecom's network underwent significant expansion as part of a government investment program. In 1993 the government was able to initiate a development program known as the National Telecommunications Program (NTP).|$|R
5000|$|An <b>automatic</b> <b>telephone</b> {{exchange}} system links all important cities and towns. Cable, telegram, and telex services connect Cameroon {{to the outside}} world. In January 1974, a satellite telecommunications earth station was inaugurated, greatly {{improving the quality of}} Cameroon’s international <b>telephone</b> <b>service.</b> However, service is still limited to mostly business and government use.|$|R
40|$|The {{telecommunications}} industry {{is undergoing a}} fundamental revolution {{with the introduction of}} intelligent networks. In this thesis, we first give an overview of the intelligent network, which includes the review of the motivation, technology, evolution, standards, components and the open issues of the intelligent network. The emphasis of the thesis is put on the intelligent network service creation. Three AIN (Advanced Intelligent Network) services, namely, the call by name, the <b>automatic</b> <b>telephone</b> directory <b>service</b> and the information query service, are designed and implemented in the AIN Service Creation Environment (SCE). An AIN multimedia fax service which is a novel application of the AIN technology is proposed. With a gateway between the telephone network and the Internet, we use AIN to provide automatic addressing, dynamic routing and flexible selecting of document type for the multimedia fax service. The idea and the technique used in this AIN multimedia fax service bring up a new AIN service opportunity which allows telephone subscribers to access abundant Internet resources. The performance of this service is evaluated based on the simulation model of priority queuing system...|$|R
50|$|France's {{telecommunication}} system is highly developed. France {{is served by}} an extensive system of <b>automatic</b> <b>telephone</b> exchanges connected by modern networks of fiber-optic cable, coaxial cable, microwave radio relay, and a domestic satellite system; cellular <b>telephone</b> <b>service</b> is widely available, expanding rapidly, and includes roaming service to foreign countries.|$|R
5000|$|Celcom Axiata Berhad, DBA Celcom, is {{the oldest}} mobile {{telecommunications}} provider in Malaysia. Celcom {{is a member of}} the Axiata group of companies. Being one of the very few companies in Malaysia to originally obtain a cellular phone license, it successfully introduced mobile telephony in Malaysia through its ART-900 (<b>Automatic</b> Radio <b>Telephone)</b> <b>service,</b> using first generation (analogue) ETACS (Extended Total Access Communication System) specifications of the United Kingdom, a derivative of the US-AMPS (Advanced Mobile Phone System) technology. The ETACS ART-900 was started using the prefix [...] "010". Celcom now uses the dialling prefix identifier of [...] "013" [...] and [...] "019" [...] and offer digital GSM (Groupe Speciale Mobile), an originally European standard, now largely a world standard for mobile communications. The original frequency band for GSM is 900 MHz, and was soon extended to 1800 MHz to cater for a much wider bandwidth requirements. The 2100 MHz band is used for their dual-channel HSPA+ network. Celcom is also licensed and has been operating FDD-LTE on 1800 MHz and 2600 MHz.|$|R
50|$|Upon the {{approval}} of the 1969 Constitution and the dissolution of the City Council, the <b>telephone</b> <b>service</b> was transferred to the newly formed Government of Gibraltar. In the 1970s there were three generations of <b>automatic</b> <b>telephone</b> exchange equipment in use with four and five digit numbers. The volume of calls grew and a System X digital exchange was installed.|$|R

50|$|A Post {{office was}} {{established}} in the 1930s. This was converted to a sub-office in 1960 with telegraphy facility. In the 1960s, Amruthur got <b>telephone</b> <b>services</b> with a Public Call Office (PCO) which later became an <b>automatic</b> <b>telephone</b> exchange. Amruthur has STD (national calling) and ISD (international calling) services, and different Telecom operators provide cellphone services. Two gas stations are also present in the village.|$|R
40|$|Many businesses, such as banks, {{will soon}} be under {{pressure}} to improve the functionality and friendliness of their telephone-based services without compromising security. Current automatic services authenticate callers with a PIN-code and consequently are not secure enough to o#er callers the chance to carry out signi#cant transactions; more sophisticated services necessarily depend on a human agent and demand lengthy authentication procedures. The technology of speaker veri#cation #SV# {{has the potential to}} deliver fast and secure caller authentication for <b>automatic</b> or operator-assisted <b>telephone</b> <b>services.</b> This paper gives an overview of the work of the CAVE consortium, a pan-European group researching the application of SV to automatic telephone-based banking and calling-card services. Results obtained in experimental work so far compare favourably with the state-of-the-art. 1 Introduction It is clear that some sectors of business are becoming less reliant on tradition [...] ...|$|R
50|$|The People's Republic of China {{possesses}} a diversified communications system that links {{all parts of}} the country by Internet, telephone, telegraph, radio, and television. The country is served by an extensive system of <b>automatic</b> <b>telephone</b> exchanges connected by modern networks of fiber-optic cable, coaxial cable, microwave radio relay, and a domestic satellite system; cellular <b>telephone</b> <b>service</b> is widely available, expanding rapidly, and includes roaming service to foreign countries.

5000|$|The second {{fundamental}} Bell {{patent for}} telephones expired on 30 January 1894, which {{provided an opportunity}} for independent companies to provide <b>telephone</b> <b>services,</b> although some had been established before that date. The Strowger <b>Automatic</b> <b>Telephone</b> Exchange company had been formed on 30 October 1891. The first Strowger switch went into operation on 3 November 1892 in LaPorte, Indiana, with 75 subscribers and capacity for 99. Independent manufacturing companies were established, such as Stromberg-Carlson in 1894 and Kellogg Switchboard & Supply Company in 1897.|$|R

Fiber to the x infrastructure has been expanded rapidly in recent years, principally by regional players including Southern Telecom Company, SibirTelecom, ER Telecom and Golden Telecom. Collectively, these players are having a significant impact of fiber broadband in regional areas, and are enabling operators {{to take advantage of}} consumer demand for faster access and bundled services.|$|R
50|$|In 1889, Almon Strowger, of Kansas City, Missouri, was {{inspired}} by the idea of manufacturing <b>automatic</b> <b>telephone</b> exchanges that would not require switchboard operators. He founded the Strowger <b>Automatic</b> <b>Telephone</b> Exchange Company in 1891, which held the first patents for the <b>automatic</b> <b>telephone</b> exchange. Subsequently, in 1901, Strowger helped form the Automatic Electric Company to which he leased his patents exclusively.|$|R

50|$|Germany's {{telecommunication}} system is highly developed. Germany telecommunication {{market has been}} fully liberalized since January 1, 1998. Germany is served by an extensive system of <b>automatic</b> <b>telephone</b> exchanges connected by modern networks of fiber-optic cable, coaxial cable, microwave radio relay, and a domestic satellite system; cellular <b>telephone</b> <b>service</b> is widely available, expanding rapidly, and includes roaming service to foreign countries. As a result of intensive capital expenditures since reunification, the formerly antiquated system of {{the eastern part of}} the country has been rapidly modernized to the most advanced technology. Deutsche Telekom began rolling out FTTH networks in ten cities in 2011, following the launch of pilot projects in Hennigsdorf, Braunschweig and Dresden in 2010.|$|R
5000|$|The Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 prohibits {{individuals}} from sending unsolicited telephonic communications. Specifically, the Act prohibits {{individuals from}} [...] "making any call" [...] or [...] "using any <b>automatic</b> <b>telephone</b> dialing system" [...] to contact a telephone number {{assigned to a}} cellular <b>telephone</b> <b>service</b> without the prior consent. A text message is considered {{the equivalent of a}} [...] "call" [...] under the Act. Private citizens may file a lawsuit against individuals who violate the act. If successful, plaintiffs may recover $500 for each violation or their [...] "actual monetary loss" [...] (whichever is greater), and damages may be tripled if the defendant [...] "knowingly" [...] or [...] "willfully" [...] violated the Act.|$|R
5000|$|In England, The <b>Automatic</b> <b>Telephone</b> and Electric Co {{operated}} a manufacturing plant in Liverpool. British Insulated Cables had founded an <b>Automatic</b> <b>Telephone</b> Manufacturing Company in November 1911 to manufacture the Strowger system under licence from the Automatic Electric Company of Chicago. The first maker of automatic exchanges in the UK, this company (as of 1923) {{was one of}} four which manufactured equipment for Post Office-owned central offices. It became part of International <b>Automatic</b> <b>Telephone</b> Co in 1920, which changed name to Automatic Electric Co in 1932 and <b>Automatic</b> <b>Telephone</b> and Electric Co Ltd in 1936 to reflect a product range which included sidelines ranging from Xcel heating appliances to traffic signals.|$|R

By 1929, 31.9% of the Bell system was <b>automatic.</b> <b>Automatic</b> <b>telephone</b> switching originally used vacuum tube amplifiers and electro-mechanical switches, which consumed {{a large amount of}} electricity. Call volume eventually grew so fast that it was feared the telephone system would consume all electricity production, prompting Bell Labs to begin research on the transistor.|$|R

5000|$|The Great Kantō {{earthquake}} struck Japan in 1923. 140,000 {{people were}} killed and 3.4 million were left homeless. [...] Four of NEC's factories were destroyed, killing 105 of NEC's engineers and workers. Thirteen of Tokyo's telephone offices were destroyed by fire. <b>Telephone</b> and telegraph <b>service</b> was interrupted by damage to telephone cables. In response, the Ministry of Communications accelerated major programs to install <b>automatic</b> <b>telephone</b> switching systems and enter radio broadcasting. [...] The first automatic switching systems were the Strowger-type model made by <b>Automatic</b> <b>Telephone</b> Manufacturing Co. (ATM) in the United Kingdom. NEC participated in the installation of the automatic switching systems, ultimately becoming the general sales agent for ATM. NEC developed its own Strowger-type automatic switching system in 1924, a first in Japan. One of the plants almost leveled during the Kanto earthquake, the Mita Plant, was chosen to support expanding production. A new three-story steel-reinforced concrete building was built, starting in 1925. It was modeled after the Western Electric Hawthorne Works.|$|R
50|$|The {{people of}} Reykjavík {{were quick to}} adopt the {{telephone}}. In 1912, {{the total number of}} telephone users in the town was 300. In 1932, the first <b>automatic</b> <b>telephone</b> exchanges in Iceland were opened, and in 1986, all telephones in the country were connected to <b>automatic</b> <b>telephone</b> exchanges. The laying of fibreoptic cable around the country began in 1985. The first digital telephone exchanges were opened in 1984, and this technology extended to all telephone exchanges 11 years later.|$|R
