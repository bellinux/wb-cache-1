5|$|In a {{retrospective}} review, Jeuxvideo.com had high {{praise for the}} level design, graphics, and animations.

The magazine also liked how the game fit the Kirby universe, apart from its increased difficulty—Jeuxvideo.com occasionally had trouble hitting the slow-paced ball with precision.|$|E

5|$|Striker Arthur Chandler is {{currently}} the club's all-time record goal scorer, netting 273 in his 12 years at the club; he <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>the</b> net in 8 consecutive matches in the 1924–25 season. The most goals managed in a single season for the club is 44 by Arthur Rowley, in the 1956–57 season.

5|$|The {{biological}} {{interest is}} focused on the species-rich mesotrophic grassland found across the site, which is actively maintained by grazing. The species present are predominantly grasses, although herbs and orchids are <b>also</b> <b>found.</b> <b>The</b> area has been classified as MG5 under the British National Vegetation Classification because of the species composition. The site is small and isolated, and therefore requires careful management to avoid damage caused by activity on neighbouring land.|$|E
5|$|The court <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>the</b> {{affidavit}} of Parker to be insufficient as {{a factual}} matter {{to comply with}} the terms of the statute.

5|$|Although Dawkins {{invented the}} term meme, {{he has not}} claimed that the idea was entirely novel, {{and there have been}} other {{expressions}} for similar ideas in the past. For instance, John Laurent has suggested that the term may have derived from the work of the little-known German biologist Richard Semon. In 1904, Semon published Die Mneme (which appeared in English in 1924 as The Mneme). This book discusses the cultural transmission of experiences, with insights parallel to those of Dawkins. Laurent <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>the</b> term mneme used in Maurice Maeterlinck's The Life of the White Ant (1926), and has highlighted the similarities to Dawkins's concept.|$|E
5|$|Excavations in the 1990s {{confirmed}} {{the presence of}} a linear settlement, stretching along the Fosse Way for perhaps a kilometre, comprising cobbled streets, wooden and stone workshops and houses (some with two storeys) containing hearths and ovens, industrial areas, and a stone-lined well. A great many artefacts were found, including local and imported pottery (such as samian ware), items of jewellery such as brooches, rings and bracelets, toilet items including tweezers, ear scoops and nail cleaners, bronze and iron tools, and a lead ingot which probably originated from the Roman lead mines on the Mendip Hills. Coins minted across the Roman empire were <b>also</b> <b>found.</b> <b>The</b> finds on the site indicate occupation from the late-1st or early-2nd centuries to the late-4th or early-5th centuries. As no public buildings were found, the settlement was probably not a town.|$|E

5|$|Firing {{upon the}} Australians with machine-guns, mortars and grenades, the Japanese {{defenders}} upon Coconut Ridge {{held up the}} advance. Throughout {{the rest of the}} day, the 2/48th Battalion undertook a series of flanking attacks in which at least 80 Japanese were killed, however by nightfall the Japanese still held the ridge, and the 2/48th Battalion withdrew to a nearby knoll to reorganise, having suffered six killed and 26 wounded. Elsewhere, the other two Australian battalions had <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>the</b> going slow: the 2/24th had dug in east of the 2200 feature, while the 2/23rd had only managed to advance about half the expected distance.|$|E
5|$|Grasses such as sea {{couch grass}} and sea poa grass are {{important}} in the driest areas of the marshes, and on the coastal dunes, where marram grass, sand couch-grass, lyme-grass and red fescue help to bind the sand. Sea holly and sand sedge are other specialists of this arid habitat, and petalwort is a nationally rare bryophyte found on damper dunes. Bird's-foot trefoil, pyramidal orchid, bee orchid, lesser centaury and carline thistle flower on the more stable dunes, where the rare Jersey cudweed and grey hair-grass are <b>also</b> <b>found.</b> <b>The</b> narrow 5-km (3-mi) belt of pines shelters creeping lady's tresses and yellow bird's nest.|$|E
5|$|In the {{airplane}} terrorism mystery film Non-Stop, Parker plays a computer programmer, who {{by the end}} of the film, is revealed as one of the two criminal masterminds behind the film's extortion plot. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times notes that Parker's talents are well-employed in his supporting role. In Every Secret Thing, Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times found Parker and his detective partner to Elizabeth Banks to have been overwhelmed in their roles. Travers <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>the</b> detectivework to be uncompelling. Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter found Parker's performance to have had its moments.|$|E

5|$|Milne managed {{three goals}} in 22 league {{appearances}} in 1988–89. The {{first was a}} 20-yard volley on 3 December 1988 in a 3–0 home win over former club Charlton Athletic, which ended United's nine-match winless run (eight draws and a defeat) in the First Division. He <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>the</b> net on Boxing Day in a 2–0 win over Nottingham Forest at Old Trafford. The week after Milne played what he felt was his best game in a Manchester United jersey in a 3–1 New Year's victory over rivals Liverpool. However {{they were unable to}} maintain their form and finished 11th in the league after winning only three of their last 14 league games. Milne scored his third and final United goal on 25 March 1989 in a 2–0 home win over Luton Town, once again in the league.|$|E
5|$|Notwithstanding {{his other}} actions, Peckham's {{relations}} with the king were generally good, and Edward sent him on a diplomatic mission to Llywelyn ap Gruffudd in Wales. In 1282 he attempted to mediate between the Welsh and King Edward, but given that Edward would not budge on the main issues, it was a hopeless mission. In the end, Peckham excommunicated some of the Welsh who were resisting Edward, not unsurprising given Peckham's views of the Welsh. Peckham visited the Welsh dioceses {{as part of his}} tour of all his subordinate dioceses. While there, Peckham criticised the Welsh clergy for their unchaste lives, conspicuous consumption, and heavy drinking. He <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>the</b> Welsh clergy to be uneducated, although he did order a Welsh-speaking suffragan bishop to be appointed to help with pastoral duties in the diocese of Coventry and Lichfield. Peckham also criticised the Welsh people as a whole, contrasting their pastoral economy with the farming-based economy of England, and finding the Welsh to be lazy and idle.|$|E
5|$|Since the 2002 {{publication}} of The Rise of the Creative Class, Florida has enjoyed academic and commercial success {{in his study}} and promotion {{of the concept of}} a creative class, or a cohort of highly innovative, highly creative individuals who are sought after by businesses. Who's Your City?, Florida's fourth book on the subject, combines scholarly research with a lighthearted self-help tone. Some critics questioned the assumption that the target audience, those easily able to move, would consult the book for advice on moving, but <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>the</b> book provides a valuable insight into the impacts of locational choices on the urbanized world.|$|E

5|$|Smalls Paradise had {{no cover}} charge and stayed open longer {{than most of the}} others, {{including}} the Cotton Club. At Smalls Paradise, patrons could also reserve a seat at the club by paying a yearly fee.

While most of the night spots shut their doors between 3 and 4 am, Smalls Paradise began breakfast dances at 6 am with a floor show of up to 30 dancers and a full jazz band.|$|E
5|$|The {{excavations}} led to antiquities of Roman origin such as {{beads and}} gems, amphorae (wine making vats) with remnants of wine, a Roman stamp, big bricks recovered {{from an old}} wall, Arretine ware and so forth. From these antiquities Wheeler concluded that the site was related to a period of trading with Rome, {{and that it was}} first established by emperor Augustus. He also noted that this Indo-Roman trade lasted for a period of about 200 years, till 200 CE. Wheeler <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>the</b> Chinese celadon, identified to belong to the Song-Yuan dynasty, and Chola coins from about the eleventh century, but these were rejected as despoiling items or remnants left by brick-robbers. Items Chinese blue-and-white ware were also recovered from the site.|$|E
5|$|Thousands {{of female}} statuettes dated {{as early as}} c. 5500 BCE have been {{recovered}} at Mehrgarh, {{one of the most}} important Neolithic sites in world archeology, and a precursor to the great Indus Valley Civilization. In Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, major cities of the Indus valley civilization, female figurines were found in almost all households indicating the presence of cults of goddess worship. Most figurines are naked and have elaborate coiffures. Some figurines have ornaments or horns on the head and a few are in poses that expose the genitals. Several small circular objects with holes in middle, possibly representing yoni, were <b>also</b> <b>found.</b> <b>The</b> objects and images found suggest that the goddess cults of Indus valley civilization were associated with fertility. A seal shows a male figure standing over a seated female figure with a sickle. It probably suggests an association between the female figure and crops, and possibly implies a ritual sacrifice where the blood of the victim was offered to the goddess for ensuring agricultural productivity.|$|E
