2500|$|According to the {{now defunct}} Department for Constitutional Affairs, the Prime Minister is made a Privy Counsellor {{as a result}} of taking office <b>and</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> by the {{official}} title prefixed by [...] "The Right Honourable" [...] and not by a personal name. Although this form of address is employed on formal occasions, it is rarely used by the media. As [...] "Prime Minister" [...] is a position, not a title, the incumbent should be referred to as [...] "the Prime Minister". The title [...] "Prime Minister" [...] (e.g. [...] "Prime Minister James Smith") is technically incorrect but is sometimes used erroneously outside the United Kingdom, and has more recently become acceptable within it. Within the UK, the expression [...] "Prime Minister Smith" [...] is never used, although it, too, is sometimes used by foreign dignitaries and news sources.|$|E

50|$|Hophmayer-Tokich and Kliot present two {{case studies}} from Israel where {{municipalities}} {{who suffer from}} water pollution initiated cooperation on wastewater treatment with upstream polluters. The findings suggest that regional cooperation can be an efficient tool in promoting advanced wastewater treatment, and has several advantages: an efficient use of limited resources (financial and land); balancing disparities between municipalities (size, socio-economic features, consciousness and ability of local leaders); and reducing spillover effects.
