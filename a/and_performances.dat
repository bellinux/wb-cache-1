40|$|Models {{of energy}} {{consumption}} <b>and</b> <b>performance</b> {{are necessary to}} understand and identify system behavior, prior to designing advanced controls that can balance out <b>performance</b> <b>and</b> energy use. This paper considers the energy consumption <b>and</b> <b>performance</b> of servers running a relatively simple file-compression workload. We found that standard techniques for system identification do not produce acceptable models of energy consumption <b>and</b> <b>performance,</b> due to the intricate interplay between the discrete nature of software and the continuous nature of energy <b>and</b> <b>performance.</b> This motivated us to perform a detailed empirical study of the energy consumption <b>and</b> <b>performance</b> of this system with varying compression algorithms and compression levels, file types, persistent storage media, CPU DVFS levels, and disk I/O schedulers. Our results identify and illustrate factors that complicate the system’s energy consumption <b>and</b> <b>performance,</b> including nonlinearity, instability, and multi-dimensionality. Our results {{provide a basis for}} future work on modeling energy consumption <b>and</b> <b>performance</b> to support principled design of controllable energy-aware systems...|$|R

In his 60-year career, Byard recorded at least 35 albums as leader, and more than 50 as a sideman. Byard's influence on the music comes from his combining of musical styles during performance, and his parallel career in teaching.|$|E

5|$|Elgar's {{principal}} large-scale {{early works}} were for chorus and orchestra for the Three Choirs and other festivals. These were The Black Knight, King Olaf, The Light of Life, The Banner of St George and Caractacus. He also wrote a Te Deum and Benedictus for the Hereford Festival. Of these, McVeagh comments favourably on his lavish orchestration and innovative use of leitmotifs, but less favourably on {{the qualities of}} his chosen texts and the patchiness of his inspiration. McVeagh makes the point that, because these works of the 1890s were for many years little known (<b>and</b> <b>performances</b> remain rare), the mastery of his first great success, the Enigma Variations, {{appeared to be a}} sudden transformation from mediocrity to genius, but in fact his orchestral skills had been building up throughout the decade.|$|E
