Fiscal years 1950-2010 GDP measurements were derived from December 2010 Bureau of Economic Analysis figures which also tend to be subject to revision, especially more recent years. Afterwards the OMB figures were revised back to 2004 and the BEA figures (in a revision dated July 31, 2013) were revised back to 1947.Regarding estimates recorded in the GDP column (the last column) marked with a [...] "~" [...] symbol, absolute differences from advance (one month after) BEA reports of GDP percent change to current findings (as of November 2013) found in revisions are stated to be 1.3% ± 2.0% or a 95% probability of being within the range of 0.0-3.3%, assuming the differences to occur according to standard deviations from the average absolute difference of 1.3%. E.g. with an advance report of a $400 billion increase of a $10 trillion GDP, for example, one could be 95% confident that the range in which the exact GDP dollar amount lies would be 0.0 to 3.3% different than 4.0% (400 ÷ 10,000) or within the range of $0 to $330 billion different than the hypothetical $400 billion (a range of $70-730 billion). Two months after, with a revised value, the range of potential difference from the stated estimate shrinks, and three months after with another revised value the range shrinks again.Fiscal years 1940-1970 begin July 1 of the previous year (for example, Fiscal Year 1940 begins July 1, 1939 and ends June 30, 1940); fiscal years 1980-2010 begin October 1 of the previous year. Intragovernmental debts before the Social Security Act are presumed to equal zero.1909-1930 calendar year GDP estimates are from MeasuringWorth.com Fiscal Year estimates are derived from simple linear interpolation.(a1) <b>Audited</b> <b>figure</b> was [...] "about $5,659 billion."(a2) <b>Audited</b> <b>figure</b> was [...] "about $5,792 billion."(a3) <b>Audited</b> <b>figure</b> was [...] "about $6,213 billion."(a) <b>Audited</b> <b>figure</b> was said to be [...] "about" [...] the stated figure.(a4) <b>Audited</b> <b>figure</b> was [...] "about $7,918 billion."(a5) <b>Audited</b> <b>figure</b> was [...] "about $8,493 billion."(a6) <b>Audited</b> <b>figure</b> was [...] "about $8,993 billion."(a7) <b>Audited</b> <b>figure</b> was [...] "about $10,011 billion."(a8) <b>Audited</b> <b>figure</b> was [...] "about $11,898 billion."(a9) <b>Audited</b> <b>figure</b> was [...] "about $13,551 billion."(a10) GAO affirmed Bureau of the Public debt figure as $14,781 billion.(a11) GAO affirmed Bureau of the Public debt figure as $16,059 billion.(a12) GAO affirmed Bureau of the Fiscal Service's figure as $16,732 billion.(a13) GAO affirmed Bureau of the Fiscal Service's figure as $17,810 billion.(a14) GAO affirmed Bureau of the Fiscal Service's figure as $18,138 billion.|$|E

On the other hand, low interest rates improved the financial manoeuvring room. If this development were to be reversed negative effects could well accumulate. The same applies to investments, where further restrictions are difficult to envisage. A point requiring clarification in the long term is the interaction between governmental units, especially the extent to which the federal government should further extend its role as overall financier of all budgets.

40|$|In {{real world}} {{business}} applications traditional software product line engineering and modeldriven software development (MDSD) [6] often cannot properly reflect the decomposition of system features. For instance, Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) checks or late introduction of security properties often crosscut the architectural {{design of a}} system. To overcome these issues Aspect-Oriented Software Development (AOSD) [1] modularizes such crosscutting concerns in independent aspects. Although aspects can already be captured at requirements stage [2, 7], {{there is no clear}} mapping to later development stages. MDSD can address this by model transformation. However, AOSD still increases the complexity of traceability (and hence, maintainability) because it adds yet another dimension of variability [3]. This issue {{is one of the most}} important arguments against applying AOSD techniques in an industrial context. Future research has to take care of this issue in order to lay the basis for industry acceptance of AOSD.
