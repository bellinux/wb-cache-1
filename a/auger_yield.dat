40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} method for depth {{measurement}} of a disrupted layer on silicon wafer surface {{which is based on}} application of Auger spectroscopy with the precision sputtering of surface silicon layers and registration of the <b>Auger</b> electron <b>yield</b> intensity. In order to measure the disrupted layer with the help of Auger spectroscopy it is necessary to determine dependence of the released Auger electron amount on sputtering time (profile) and then the dependence is analyzed. Silicon amount in the disrupted layer is less than in the volume. While going deeper the disruptive layer is decreasing that corresponds to an increase of atom density in a single layer. The essence of the method lies in the fact the disruptive layer is removed by ion beam sputtering and detection of interface region is carried out with the help of registration of the <b>Auger</b> electron <b>yield</b> intensity from the sputtered surface up to the moment when it reaches the value which is equal to the <b>Auger</b> electron <b>yield</b> intensity for single-crystal silicon. While removing surface silicon layers the registration of the <b>Auger</b> electron <b>yield</b> intensity from silicon surface makes it possible to control efficiently a presence of the disrupted layer on the silicon wafer surface. In this case depth control locality is about 1. 0 nm due to some peculiarities of Auger spectroscopy method. The <b>Auger</b> electron <b>yield</b> intensity is determined automatically while using Auger spectrometer and while removing the disrupted layer the intensity is gradually increasing. Depth of the disrupted layer is determined by measuring height of the step which has been formed as a result of removal of the disrupted layer from the silicon wafer surface.

For beam energy in the kiloelectron-volt range, maxima in the <b>Auger</b> <b>yield</b> occur when the primary beam is aligned with low-index crystal axes, therefore the Auger angular intensity distribution directly reflects the symmetries {{and the degree of}} local order. We investigated the potential for this effect, primary-beam diffraction modulated electron emission (PDMEE) to be used for surface structural characterization, in comparison with the Auger electron/photoelectron diffraction (AED/PD) technique. The angular intensity distributions of both low and high kinetic energy Auger electrons were measured on both GaAs and InP (110) surfaces. We show, by using highly collimated energetic electron beams, that the angular resolution is significantly improved in PDMEE with respect to AED/PD. Unlike the AED/PD case, the angular intensity distribution is independent of the kinetic energy of the Auger electrons, therefore low-energy, surface-sensitive electrons also directly reflect crystal symmetries, owing also {{to the fact that the}} specific momentum character of the Auger electrons can be neglected.

40|$|Indium {{phosphide}} (InP) nanocrystals with mean {{particle diameter}} in the 3 - 4 nm range and size distribution 8 - 10 % of the average diameter were synthesized by methods of colloidal chemistry. Capping of the nanocrystal surface with a shell of organic ligands allowed both the achievement of a high stability of nanocrystalline properties and the solubility of particles in different solvents. InP nanocrystals with enhanced photoluminescence (PL) efficiency were obtained by photo-assisted etching of the nanocrystal surface with hydrofluoric acid (HF); the PL quantum efficiency of the resulting InP nanocrystals was about three orders of magnitude higher than the ''as prepared'' InP samples and approached #propor to# 40 % at room temperature. Photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) with synchrotron radiation was used to reveal the changes of the nanocrystals that {{were responsible for the}} dramatic improvement of the PL efficiency. The analysis of high resolution In 3 d and P 2 p core-levels confirmed significant changes of the nanocrystal surface structure. These changes were induced by the post-preparative nanocrystals treatments and allowed the proposal of a model for the etching mechanism. The photo-assisted treatment of InP nanocrystals selectively removes phosphorus atoms from the nanocrystal surface. These atoms form surface states located inside the band gap of the ''as-prepared'' InP nanocrystals and provide non-radiative recombination pathways. With the pick-up method, Cu atoms are loaded into host Ar clusters. This results in the formation of small Cu clusters with a broad size distribution (50 % of the average size). The average sizes of the resulting clusters were measured to be approx. 5 - 15 atoms/cluster using a time of flight mass spectrometer. The spectroscopic investigation was performed on deposited Cu clusters embedded in an Ar matrix. The samples were deposited on a cold substrate (10 K). The depth homogeneity and stability of the deposited clusters were monitored with help of PES. The main investigation method for the Cu cluster was X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) in the X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) regime, yielding information about the electronic and geometric structure of the deposited clusters. For better statistics, the acquisition of the absorption spectra for Cu L_ 3 _,_ 2 edge was performed simultaneously in two different modes: total electron yield (TEY) and <b>auger</b> <b>yield.</b> XANES spectra (Ar L_ 3 _,_ 2 edge) were also recorded for pure or Cu doped Ar matrices. The Cu clusters had icosahedral structure with a bond length of approx. 2. 23 Aa which was around #propor to# 6 % shorter than the Cu single crystal (2. 556 Aa).

40|$|New {{generations of}} ultrashort and intense laser pulses as well ashigh power {{synchrotron}} radiation sources and x-ray free electronlasers have promoted fast developments in nonlinear optics andx-ray spectroscopy. The new experimental achievements {{and the appearance}} of varieties of novelnonlinear phenomena call for further development of theories. The objective of this thesis is to develop and apply thetheories to explain existing experimental data and to suggest new experiments. The first part of the thesis is devoted to nonlinear propagation of optical pulses. It is shown that the vibrational levels can be selectively populated by varying the duration, shape and intensity of the pump pulse. We obtained a strict analytical solution for the resonant two-photon interaction in a multilevel system beyond rotating wave approximation. Simulations show that the polarization anisotropy of the two-photon excitation affects strongly the anisotropy of photobleaching. The two-photon area theorem is reformulated with taking into account the dynamical Stark shift and the contribution from the permanent dipole moments. In general the dynamical Stark shift does not allow complete population of the excited state, but it can be compensated by detunings in atoms. A dynamical theory of the sequential two-photon absorption of  microsecond pulses  is developed to explore the role of transverse inhomogeneity of the light beam on optical limiting properties.   The propagation of ultrashort laser pulses in nondipolar and dipolar media is investigated with special attention to the generation of superfluorescence and supercontinuum and the formation of attosecond pulses. The second part of the thesis addresses the interaction of molecules with x-ray radiation.   We explore here the role of nuclear dynamics in resonant Auger scattering. Multimode simulations of the Auger spectra of ethylene molecule explain the main spectral features of the experimental spectra and show that the spectral profiles are formed mainly due to six vibrational modes. We predict the Doppler splitting of the atomic peak in resonant Auger scattering from SF 6 molecule for circularly polarized x-rays. This effect is confirmed by the recent experiment. A new scheme of x-ray pump-probe spectroscopy, namely, resonant inelastic x-ray scattering accompanied by core-hole hopping induced by strong laser fields is suggested. The laser-induced promotion of core holes opens the symmetry forbidden scattering channels and gives rise to new spectral lines in the x-ray scattering spectrum. The strength of the symmetry forbidden lines becomes strong when  the time of Rabi flopping is shorter than the lifetime of the core-excited state. We study the role of propagation of femtosecond x-ray free-electron pulses on the Auger process. Simulations show  that there exists a strong competition between Auger decay and stimulated emission.

40|$|The present {{thesis is}} devoted to {{theoretical}} studies of resonant X-ray scattering and propagation of strong X-ray pulses. In {{the first part of}} the thesis the nuclear dynamics of different molecules is studied using resonant X-ray Raman and resonant Auger scattering techniques. We show that the shortening of the scattering duration by the detuning results in a purification of the Raman spectra from overtones and soft vibrational modes. The simulations are in a good agreement with measurements, performed at the MAX-II and the Swiss Light Source with vibrational resolution. We explain why the scattering to the ground state nicely displays the vibrational structure of liquid acetone in contrast to excited final state. Theory of resonant X-ray scattering by liquids is developed. We show that, contrary to aqueous acetone, the environmental broadening in pure liquid acetone is twice smaller than the broadening by soft vibrational modes significantly populated at room temperature. Similar to acetone, the "elastic" band of X-ray Raman spectra of molecular oxygen is strongly affected by the Thomson scattering. The Raman spectrum demonstrates spatial quantum beats caused by two interfering wave packets with different momenta as the oxygen atoms separate. It is found that the vibrational scattering anisotropy caused by the interference of the "inelastic" Thomson and resonant scattering channels in O 2. A new spin selection rule is established in inelastic X-ray Raman spectra of O 2. It is shown that the breakdown of the symmetry selection rule based on the parity of the core hole, as the core hole and excited electron swap parity. Multimode calculations explain the two thresholds of formation of the resonant Auger spectra of the ethene molecule by the double-edge structure of absorption spectrum caused by the out-of- and in-plane modes. We predict the rotational Doppler effect and related broadening of X-ray photoelectron and resonant Auger spectra, which has the same magnitude as its counterpart-the translational Doppler effect. The second part of the thesis explores the interaction of the medium with strong X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) fields. We perform simulations of nonlinear propagation of femtosecond XFEL pulses in atomic vapors by solving coupled Maxwell's and density matrix equations. We show that self-seeded stimulated X-ray Raman scattering strongly influences the temporal and spectral structure of the XFEL pulse. The generation of Stokes and four-wave mixing fields starts from the seed field created during pulse propagation due to the formation of extensive ringing pattern with long spectral tail. We demonstrate a compression into the attosecond region and a slowdown of the XFEL pulse up to two orders of magnitude. In the course of pulse propagation, the <b>Auger</b> <b>yield</b> is strongly suppressed due to the competitive channel of stimulated emission.

These are shown to agree reasonably well with those predicted by the theoretical model of Gryzinski when backscattering contributions and Coster-Kronig transition probabilities are taken into account. This good agreement for allylacetic acid, chlorotrif 1 ouroethylene, and thiophene was obtained only after normalization of the cross-sections to that determined for carbon in ethylene. The data imply that the saturation coverages of these compounds in the vacuum environment are less than in the solution environment of the TLE. Resolution of this matter requires further development of a vacuum compatible TLE so that the electrochemistry can be performed immediately following the Auger analysis on the same sample...|$|R
40|$|CrN has {{widespread}} applications as protective coatings, for example, in aircraft {{jet engines}} whereby their high hardness and good oxidation resistance render metal components resistant to harsh operating conditions. Alloying elements are commonly incorporated (doped) into the coatings {{to further enhance}} their thermomechanical properties. However, the effect of dopants on the electronic properties and their roles in modifying the grain boundary configurations remain unclear. Lack of such critical knowledge has hindered the development of design strategies for high performance CrN-based coatings. To address this challenging issue, {{in the present study}} near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) investigations of Cr 1 -yNiyN coatings at the Cr L 3, 2 -edge (570 - 610 eV), Ni L 3, 2 -edge (840 - 890 eV), and N K-edge (380 - 450 eV) regions were conducted using synchrotron radiation soft X-ray (SXR) spectroscopy in both <b>Auger</b> electron <b>yield</b> (AEY) and total fluorescence yield (TFY) modes. The chemical states in CrNiN were found to change with the increase of Ni content, manifested as a small chemical shift and moderate change of shapes of various absorption edges. The CrN grain size also became smaller with increasing Ni concentration. These findings help improve our understanding of local bonding structures, which could potentially lead to improved coating designs for highly demanding applications...|$|R
40|$|A {{methodology}} and {{its application to}} silica supported vanadia are presented that allows for {{a detailed analysis of}} structural peculiarities of the vanadia species on the surface. We introduce in situ oxygen K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) based on the <b>Auger</b> electron <b>yield</b> (AEY) technique as a characterisation tool to assist vibrational spectroscopy that has been applied extensively in earlier work on this system. The analysis of the O K-near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) allows a clear distinction between separate vanadia, silica and interface contribution in contrast to vibrational spectroscopy with strongly overlapping contributions due to vibrational coupling. Differently coordinated oxygen can be identified in the O K-NEXAFS spectrum by comparison with theoretical spectra obtained by state of the art density-functional theory (DFT) calculation. A study of catalysts with different V loadings (0 wt% V, 2. 7 wt% V, and 10. 8 wt% V) shows that the contributions of silica to the NEXAFS appear in an energy region well separated from the spectral signature of oxygen bound to vanadium. Dehydrated catalysts with high (10. 8 wt% V) and low (2. 7 wt% V) vanadium loading on silica SBA- 15 show identical NEXAFS under in situ conditions. This finding indicates that independent of the loading a distribution of vanadia species with a very similar molecular structure, including non-monomeric as well as possibly monomeric configurations and different from crystalline V 2 O 5, is present on this model catalyst...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} theory of Auger {{neutralization}} for slow and compact ions scattered off metal surfaces. When an ion is near the surface, we propose a local model in which free-electron-gas quantities are scaled through the local electronic density at the ion position n(z). It is shown {{that the results of}} this local model can be joined to the results of a totally surface calculation, valid when the ion is far from the surface. We have calculated Auger neutralization rates and electron emission spectra for He+ ions interacting with a jellium surface of rs= 2. 67 a 0. The effect of the ion potential on the metal-electron wave functions can be incorporated into the model by means of the effective density setup by the tunneling electrons. Its effect is found to be crucial when comparing our results with available experimental data for He+ scattered off Cu surfaces. This simple parameter-free theory <b>yields</b> <b>Auger</b> rates and electron emission spectra comparable with calibrated experiments...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays {{scientists}} and technologists are prompted {{to design and}} test novel coatings that can prevent mechanical damage to jet engines due to intrusion of airborne fine particulates, especially volcanic ash. Chromium nitride (CrN) is a prominent candidate, which can be engineered {{onto the surface of}} metals as a protective layer to enhance mechanical performances and durability of coated metals. Doped CrNs have widespread applications as protective coatings, including volcanic ash resistant coatings for jet engines. Excellent mechanical and chemical properties prevent these materials from wearing under harsh conditions. Previous investigations indicate that the mechanical hardness and oxidation resistance characteristics of the CrN coatings improved extensively with additional doping contents of silicon (Si) or aluminium (Al) to the CrN frame. In the present investigation, doped Cr (Si/Al) N coatings were prepared on steel substrates using a TEER UDP 650 / 4 closed field unbalanced magnetron sputtering technique. The Si and Al doping contents added were at 14. 3, 21. 2 and 28. 5 at %, respectively. Synchrotron radiation near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) measurements were carried out {{in order to understand the}} local bonding structure and grain boundaries of the coating. The NEXAFS measurements were conducted at Al K-edge, S K-edge, Cr L-edge in <b>Auger</b> electron <b>yield</b> (AEY) and total fluorescence yield (TFY) modes. These provided significant information on the electronic structures and the bonding states of CrN matrix with Al and Si doping that assist understanding of the effects of local bonding states and grain boundaries of CrN frame in relation to the mechanical strength and oxidation resistance of the coatings. The data presented here will provide valuable insights on the local structures of dopants in relation to the material’s properties, leading to the development of superhard and corrosion-resistant coatings...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} was to {{evaluate}} the characteristics of mechanically separated meat produced from turkey as example. The status survey of 35 separates of turkey produced by pressure roller or rotation auger technology was done {{in view of the}} criterion bone/histometrical (digital area determination and particle analysis, conventional particle counting in the histological section) and bone/chemical (Calcium determination). Additionally the tissue composition and the microbiological status of the samples were determinated. Apart from doing the status survey the second focus was to prove the analysis of phases in terms of the software supported area determination and particle analysis. The proof compared two reference methods, the conventional particle counting and the Calcium determination, with the digital investigated results. 1. With all used methods it was shown, that the pressure roller technology provided lower bone tissue contents than the rotation auger technology. Furthermore it seems to be an interrelation between the occurrence of the bone particles and the anatomical origin of the deboned material within both separated groups. The MSM produced by rotation <b>auger</b> <b>yields</b> higher bone quotas in the finished product whereas it is hardly to prove the raw material produced by pressure roller because of its infinitesimal bone contents. 2. The Calcium content of more than 2 / 3 of the examined samples was lower than the limit of 100 mg / 100 g from the EU Regulation 2074 / 2005. There were only some overruns by the rotation auger produced samples. 3. The results of the microbiological examination showed insistently, {{that it is necessary to}} improve the hygienic conditions for the production of the separates. All samples showed higher counts than the limit of 50 cfu Escherichia coli / g as a hygienic parameter according to the EU Regulation 2073 / 2005. In terms of the health risk the high numbers of colony forming units of coagulase-positive Staphylococcus and Clostridia should be taken into account. 4. Salmonella spp. was isolated 9 x from 35 samples and Campylobacter spp. from only one pooled sample. Listeria monocytogenes was not found at all. 5. The qualitative and semi-quantitative histological examination resulted in differences of the occurrence of cartilage, renal structures and collagen parts by the particular samples showing an interdependence between the separation technology and the anatomical origin of the deboned material but these informations are not sufficient for the diagnosis of mechanically separated meat or more than ever for an assignment to certain procedures or kind of bone. 6. The experiment involved paraffin slides stained by Alizarin-S according to German official collection of food examination methods for the automatic determination of the bone area (PFEIFFER et al. 1975). The bone tissue appears orange-red using this staining formula and the residual tissue blue. The problems involving the achromatic color black for the analysis by the additive HSI system prohibited the Kossa staining (KÖNIGSMANN 1978) as an alternative. The 60 particular pictures were scanned automatically and gradually by a digital camera and conglomerated to a general overview picture. The discrimination, marking and determination of the two areas of concern were yielded subsequently upon a visual controlling according to the HSI parameters. 7. The particle analysis turned out to be helpful for the judgment of its homogeneity in relation to parameters as single area and equivalent circle diameter as well as affinity of particles to build so called bone nests. The continuous produced separates show a lower dispersal of the particular characteristics and indicate a higher morphological homogeneity and tendency for the bone nests. 8. The results of the digital microscopic analysis of phases and the reference methods correlate for the determination of the bone quotas in spite of different analytical basics very tight. The analysis of the regression shows a high significant correlation (<. 001) between the phase analytical area determination and manual particle counting (r =. 96) and also to the chemical method (r =. 92). The phase analytical particle counting correlates with the conventional particle counting in a similar way (r =. 95). Altogether the different analytical techniques show very close correlations. A standard and full contrast staining is the most important precondition for a software supported discrimination of the areas of concern. This condition is fulfilled by the Alizarin-S staining. Principally it is possible to correct the misstained areas by visual controlling, but it interferes also the automation of the procedure and makes necessary personal manipulations. And this individual intervention should be eliminated and substituted by a full automatic standard examination for avoiding the personal error from the point count technique. It cannot be assessed, which grade of perfection could be reached by further tests, but meanwhile this procedure satisfies the requirements for a valid method and can be recommended for the routine analysis...|$|R
