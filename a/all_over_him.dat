[...] "Tim had Hollywood good looks and the charisma of Tom Cruise," [...] said his friend Dr. Jerry Punch. [...] "There he was in victory lane with the team all around him and beauty queens hanging <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>him.</b> It was important for {{the people at the}} hospital to see Tim the way he really was, when he was healthy and handsome and vital, not the way he was as they saw him every day in the hospital." ...|$|E

500|$|This {{episode was}} the second episode of the series {{directed}} by Bryan Gordon. Gordon had previously directed the first season episode [...] "The Alliance". [...] "The Injury" [...] was written by Mindy Kaling, who also acts for the show as customer service representative Kelly Kapoor. After the character development that had occurred in the previous episode, [...] "Booze Cruise", Greg Daniels decided {{to create a more}} inane episode that involved [...] "Michael's grilled foot." [...] Writer and actor B. J. Novak said the idea for [...] "Injury" [...] started out as an idea in the writing room that just [...] "spun out of control". The original plan was for Michael to have fallen asleep in the sun, while having sunblock <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>him,</b> except for his foot. According to BJ Novak, the episode was originally going to be called [...] "My Grilled Foot", but writer Mindy Kaling thought it was [...] "too weird for people to tune in and watch that". Novak has described [...] "The Injury" [...] as one of his favorite episodes, and said of it, [...] "I don't think any other TV show would have made an episode from that starting point, and yet {{it was one of the}} funniest and most relatable episodes as it went on that we've ever had." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes. He {{had put on}} {{the oldest}} suit of clothes he had and gone away. Of course my mother sent out an alarm, and men hunted <b>all</b> <b>over</b> for <b>him.</b> But he {{was not to be}} found." ...|$|R
