5|$|Göring {{was noted}} for his {{patronage}} of music, especially opera. He entertained frequently and sumptuously, and hosted elaborate birthday parties for himself. Armaments minister Albert Speer recalled that guests brought expensive gifts such as gold bars, Dutch cigars, and valuable artwork. For his birthday in 1944, Speer gave Göring <b>an</b> <b>oversize</b> marble bust of Hitler. As {{a member of}} the Prussian Council of State, Speer was required to donate a considerable portion of his salary towards the Council's birthday gift to Göring without even being asked. Field Marshal Erhard Milch told Speer that similar donations were required out of the Air Ministry's general fund. For his birthday in 1940, Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano decorated Göring with the coveted Collar of Annunziata. The award reduced him to tears.|$|E

25|$|Oversize {{and larger}} racquets are {{generally}} used by older recreational players, {{as a way}} to reduce the impact of aging on their tennis competitiveness. The largest legal racquets, which are known as super-oversize frames, have proven extremely rare in professional competition, with only Monica Seles being a top 10 or higher ranked player who used one (a 125 square inch Yonex) during her career at any time. Andre Agassi achieved considerable success with <b>an</b> <b>oversize</b> racquet, a fact that was often noted due to his rivalry with Pete Sampras, a player who used a much smaller midsize frame. Oversize racquets are generally considered to offer more power but less control, a trend that exists from the smallest racquet size ("standard") to the largest legal size, which is 135 square inches.|$|E
25|$|After the movie, {{as seen in}} , Cobra Commander {{is still}} in his snake form and kept as a pet by Serpentor. However, Baroness restores him partly to a semi-human form—through {{exposure}} to an ancient primordial energy called Dragonfire, which {{is the focal point}} of the first five episodes of the new series. The basic shape of his body is humanoid, his skin and features are reptilian and he retains a taste for flies that he catches with his prehensile tongue. His intellect is fully restored, and upon being outfitted with his battle armor, Cobra Commander once again appears to be a humanoid male. He regains control of Cobra, and even dispatches Serpentor, using the new found Dragonfire energy to turn him into <b>an</b> <b>oversize</b> iguana. Cobra Commander's inhuman origins are never mentioned again, and he is never shown to have reptilian features again. In Season 2, he resumes wearing his original cloth mask, and his eyes appear to be completely human.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to passenger duties, the A300 became widely used by air freight operators; according to Airbus, {{it is the}} best selling freight aircraft of all time. Various variants of the A300 were built to meet customer demands, often for diverse roles such as aerial refueling tankers, freighter models (new-build and conversions), combi aircraft, military airlifter, and VIP transport. Perhaps the most visually unique of the variants is the A300-600ST Beluga, <b>a</b> <b>oversize</b> cargo-carrying model operated by Airbus to carry aircraft sections between their manufacturing facilities.

500|$|However, this aura of {{untouchability}} nearly {{came to an}} {{end when}} the cornermaster was himself cornered. Little particularly favored shorting the stocks of the Erie Railroad Company, and it was here that he was trapped by the cornering of the company's stock by a hostile syndicate of rival stockbrokers calling itself the [...] "Happy Family" [...] (in {{much the same way as}} he had done to countless other traders before). This led to a rather dramatic showdown between Little and the financiers involved. At the time, making good on a purchase promise required a transaction at the associated clerk's office, and on the day it was due the brokers gathered at the Erie Railroad Company clerk's office, smug at the likelihood that they had beaten Little at his own game. What the traders did not know was that Little had purchased convertible bonds at a company sale in London a few years before; Little entered the premises, apparently unrushed, carrying <b>an</b> <b>oversize</b> bag of what was revealed to be those very bonds, which Little had converted to stocks. To the astonishment of all, Little not only outplayed the syndicate but came out hundreds of thousands of dollars ahead; such a maneuver was never attempted again.|$|E

25|$|<b>As</b> <b>oversize</b> wooden racquets have {{a strong}} {{tendency}} to warp and also lack solidity when produced at a playable weight, only one was produced, the Prince Woodie, which had many layers of graphite to improve its stability. That racquet was used successfully by male and female professionals, such as Gabriela Sabatini and professionals in development, such as Tommy Haas. Although it offered very little power, when compared with a graphite racquet, due to its flexibility, it absorbed ball shock well due to its wood construction, making it an excellent racquet for training. Similarly, fiberglass was quite flexible, like wood. The desire for more power led to graphite eventually completely displacing fiberglass, although graphite racquets with approximately 20% fiberglass were produced long after 100% fiberglass racquets disappeared from the market.|$|R
500|$|The three {{designs for}} the Turban Head eagle—the obverse and the two reverses—are all by Scot. [...] They are {{identical}} to designs used on other silver and gold coins of the period—the Mint did not yet put denominations on gold pieces. The origin of Scot's obverse is uncertain. Art historian Cornelius Vermeule suggests a similarity between Scot's portrayal of Liberty on the eagle and the portrait on the 1792 half disme (deemed by some the first Federal coinage), and speculates that the ultimate inspiration may have been Martha Washington, the President's wife. He also contends that a bust should have drapery only if intended {{as part of a}} statue: [...] "Greco-Roman classicism has been misunderstood here". Numismatic historian Walter Breen believes that Scot probably [...] "copied some unlocated contemporaneous engraving of a Roman copy of a Hellenistic goddess, altering the hair, adding drapery and <b>an</b> <b>oversize</b> soft cap". Breen disputes Vermeule's contention that the cap is a pileus, the hat given to emancipated slaves as a symbol of their freedom. In support of his argument, he reproduces an 1825 letter from then Mint Director Samuel Moore, stating that the cap on the gold coins was [...] "not the Liberty cap in form, but probably conforming to the fashionable dress of the day". Numismatic author David Lange contends the headgear is a mob cap, much in fashion at the time.|$|E
2500|$|No {{professional}} {{tennis player}} {{has used the}} small [...] "standard" [...] racquet head size since the 1980s for a professional match, with nearly all players having switched to a midsize or larger frame by 1984. However, even today, few professionals use <b>an</b> <b>oversize</b> racquet, preferring a midplus or super midplus. That size is smaller than that of <b>an</b> <b>oversize</b> (which is typically 110 square inches) and larger {{than that of a}} midsize (which is typically 90 square inches).

40|$|PURPOSE: Transapical {{aortic valve}} {{implantation}} {{is a new}} minimally invasive technique for beating heart, off-pump, aortic valve implantation in high-risk patients. DESCRIPTION: The procedure involves antegrade aortic valve implantation using <b>an</b> <b>oversizing</b> technique with direct access and accurate positioning of a stent-based transcatheter xenograft. Procedural steps include placement of femoral arterial and venous access wires, anterolateral mini-thoracotomy, epicardial pacing, and apical pursestring suture placement. Valve positioning is performed under fluoroscopic and echocardiographic guidance during rapid ventricular pacing. EVALUATION: Patient screening, especially regarding native aortic annulus diameter and pattern of calcification, is essential for success. Since imaging is crucial, implantations are optimally performed in a hybrid operative theater by an experienced team of cardiac surgeons, cardiologists, and anesthetists. CONCLUSIONS: The aim {{of this article is}} to outline the technical aspects of the new technique of minimally invasive transapical aortic valve implantation...|$|R
40|$|This is a simulation-based warning {{note for}} {{practitioners}} {{who use the}} MGLS unit root tests {{in the context of}} structural change using different selection lag length criteria. With T= 100, we find severe oversize problems when using some criteria, while other criteria produce an undersizing behavior. In view of this dilemma, we do not recommend using these tests. While such behavior tends to disappear when T= 250, {{it is important to note}} that most empirical applications use smaller sample sizes such as T= 100 or T= 150. The ADFGLS test does not present <b>an</b> <b>oversizing</b> or undersizing problem. The only disadvantage of the ADFGLS test arises in the presence of MA(1) negative correlation, in which case the MGLS tests are preferable, but in all other cases they are very undersized.

40|$|In this paper, an {{analytic}} {{study of the}} subject of mechanical power transmission in HAWT wind turbine has been carried out. For the most part, the study analyzes the use of continuously variable transmission (CVT) {{in order to allow}} the turbine and the electric generator to couple, allowing in turn, an unremitting transmission ratio adjustment. In low-wind sites, the design criteria suggest <b>an</b> <b>oversizing</b> of the wind turbine in order to generate adequate electrical power even at low wind speed. The proposed solution enhances the space of operating points since it allows the electric generator to release the rotational speed from the turbine one (limited due to structural integrity). Employing a CVT transmission, the modulation system of the input power to the turbine starts operating at higher wind speeds when compared to a conventional direct-drive case: this corresponds with the possibility to fully exploit the wind power at a higher speed range, therefore maximizing the wind turbine’s energy production. The analysis has showed that, in the case of CVT configuration, the annual energy yield increases of about 50 % compared to direct-drive solution...|$|R
