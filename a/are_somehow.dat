5|$|Abandoned {{by their}} father {{deep in a}} forest, young Hansel and Gretel enter a {{gingerbread}} house and are captured by a cannibalistic witch. The witch forces Hansel to continuously eat candy to fatten him up, and enslaves Gretel by ordering her to prepare the oven. The siblings outsmart her and incinerate her in the fire of the oven. In the fifteen years that follow, Hansel and Gretel become famed witch hunters, slaying hundreds of witches. The pair find that they <b>are</b> <b>somehow</b> immune to spells and curses, but the incident in the gingerbread house has left Hansel diabetic. He needs a shot of insulin every few hours or he will get sick and die.|$|E
5|$|Some {{commentators}} {{suggested the}} discovery and subsequent positive exposure and good morale {{around the city}} contributed to Leicester City F.C.'s shock Premier League victory in 2016. A {{few days after the}} burial, Leicester City began a winning streak to take them from bottom of the league to comfortably avoiding relegation, and they {{went on to win the}} league the following year. Mayor Peter Soulsby said:For too long, people in Leicester have been modest about their achievements and the city they live in. Now - thanks first to the discovery of King Richard III and the Foxes' phenomenal season - it's our time to step into the international limelight.and:It has been said that we <b>are</b> <b>somehow</b> being repaid for burying Richard with honour in our cathedral.|$|E
5|$|While {{mourning}} Roth, Lara accepts {{that the}} storms are not natural, but <b>are</b> <b>somehow</b> {{connected to the}} Sun Queen and designed to prevent anyone from leaving the island. She meets up with her friends (Reyes, Jonah, Alex, and Sam), who have evaded the Solarii long enough to secure a boat for escaping the island, provided {{that it can be}} repaired. They are joined by Whitman, who claims to have escaped, though Lara begins to suspect him of working with the cultists. Lara joins Alex in finding parts for the boat in the wreck of the Endurance. She finds him injured and stuck under some rubble. They come under attack by the Solarii and Alex triggers an explosion, sacrificing himself so that Lara can escape with the tools.|$|E

5|$|Pinfold is very {{protective}} of his privacy, but uncharacteristically agrees {{to be interviewed}} on BBC radio. The main inquisitor is a man named Angel, whose voice and manner disconcert Pinfold, who believes he detects a veiled malicious intent. In the weeks that follow, Pinfold broods on the incident. He finds his memory beginning to play tricks on him. The encroaching winter depresses him further; he decides to escape by taking a cruise, and secures passage on the SS Caliban, bound for Ceylon. As the voyage proceeds, Pinfold finds that he hears sounds and conversations {{from other parts of}} the ship which he believes <b>are</b> <b>somehow</b> being transmitted into his cabin. Amid an increasingly bizarre series of overheard incidents, he hears remarks which become progressively more insulting, and then directly threatening towards himself. The main tormentors are a man and a woman, whose vicious words are balanced by those of an affectionate younger woman, Margaret. He is convinced that the man is the BBC interviewer Angel, using his technical knowledge to broadcast the voices. Pinfold spends sleepless nights, awaiting a threatened beating, a kidnapping attempt and a seductive visit from Margaret.|$|E

25|$|The {{relatively}} empty midfield {{relied on}} defenders that {{should now be}} able not only to steal the ball, but also hold it, pass it or even run with it and start an attack. So this formation required that all players, including defenders, <b>are</b> <b>somehow</b> skilful and with initiative, making it a perfect fit for the Brazilian player's mind. The 4–2–4 needed {{a high level of}} tactical awareness, as having only two midfielders could lead to defensive problems. The system was also fluid enough to allow the formation to change throughout play.|$|E

25|$|Same-sex {{sexual acts}} are legal in Mexico, but LGBT {{people have been}} prosecuted {{through the use of}} legal codes that {{regulate}} obscene or lurid behavior (atentados a la moral y las buenas costumbres). Over the past twenty years, there have been reports of violence against gay men, including the murders of openly gay men in Mexico City and of transvestites in the southern state of Chiapas. Local activists believe that these cases often remain unsolved, blaming the police for a lack of interest in investigating them and for assuming that gays <b>are</b> <b>somehow</b> responsible for attacks against them.|$|E
25|$|Women who miscarry {{early in}} their {{pregnancy}} usually do not need any subsequent medical treatment. They can benefit from support and counselling. Most early miscarriages will complete on their own; in other cases, medication treatment or aspiration of the products of conception {{can be used to}} remove remaining tissue. While bed rest has been advocated to prevent miscarriage, this has not been found to be of benefit. Those who are or who have experienced an abortion benefit from the use of careful medical language. Significant distress can often be managed by the ability of the clinician to clearly explain terms without suggesting that the woman or couple <b>are</b> <b>somehow</b> to blame.|$|E
25|$|For this viewpoint, {{one should}} {{consider}} how the archetypical scattering experiment is performed. The initial particles are prepared in well defined states where they are so far apart that they don't interact. They <b>are</b> <b>somehow</b> made to interact, and the final particles are registered when they are so far apart that they have ceased to interact. The idea {{is to look for}} states in the Heisenberg picture that in the distant past had the appearance of free particle states. This will be the in states. Likewise, an out state will be a state that in the distant future has the appearance of a free particle state.|$|E

25|$|The terms {{substrate}} and superstrate {{are often}} used when two languages interact. However, the meaning of these terms is reasonably well-defined only in second language acquisition or language replacement events, when the native speakers of a certain source language (the substrate) <b>are</b> <b>somehow</b> compelled to abandon it for another target language (the superstrate). The outcome of such an event is that erstwhile speakers of the substrate will use some version of the superstrate, at least in more formal contexts. The substrate may survive {{as a second language}} for informal conversation. As demonstrated by the fate of many replaced European languages (such as Etruscan, Breton, and Venetian), the influence of the substrate on the official speech is often limited to pronunciation and a modest number of loanwords. The substrate might even disappear altogether without leaving any trace.|$|E

When Dean and Sam attempt to save those people, they meet Deputy Jenna Nickerson, who's taking care of a newborn baby girl whose father was infected and eventually died. The baby is taken to Jenna's grandmother's house, where the baby begins levitating toys. This prompts the old lady to call an exorcist, and Jenna to call Dean. When Dean arrives, he finds out the exorcist is Crowley, who found out the baby is The Darkness, and eventually flees taking her with him. Meanwhile, Sam begins to have visions, that he claims to be sent by God.|$|E
