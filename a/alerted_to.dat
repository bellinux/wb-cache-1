5|$|The Persians were <b>alerted</b> <b>to</b> the {{withdrawal}} of the Greeks by a boat from Histiaea, but did not at first believe it. They sent some ships to see if this was the case, and finding that it was, the whole fleet set sail for Artemisium in the morning. The Persians then sailed on to Histiaea and sacked the surrounding region.|$|E
5|$|Batman's alter-ego is Bruce Wayne, {{a billionaire}} {{industrialist}} who, as a child, witnessed his parents' murder {{at the hands}} of a psychotic mugger. At a fundraiser for the bicentennial in Wayne Manor, Bruce meets and falls for Vale, and the two begin a romantic relationship. However, the evening is cut short as Bruce is <b>alerted</b> <b>to</b> Commissioner Gordon's sudden departure due to police business and leaves to investigate as Batman.|$|E
40|$|Background: Electronic {{medical records}} (EMR) provide {{opportunities}} to implement systems of information flow, such as <b>alerts</b> <b>to</b> providers. Methods: Within a group practice with an EMR, {{we conducted a}} trial of automated <b>alerts</b> <b>to</b> the in-baskets of primary care physicians and staff when patients were discharged from hospital to home. We generated alerts for new medications or monitoring needs. Staff received <b>alerts</b> <b>to</b> schedule office visits. Using EMR “digital crumbs”, we tracked when alerts were viewed. We analyzed the impact of physician age, gender, department, and employment status (full-time, part-time) as well as patient conditions (age, gender, comorbidity, and number of office visits in the previous year) on timely opening. Results: Of 763 <b>alerts</b> <b>to</b> physicians, 616 (81...|$|R

5|$|British Admiral George Brydges Rodney, who {{had been}} {{tracking}} de Grasse around the West Indies, was <b>alerted</b> <b>to</b> the latter's departure, but was uncertain of the French admiral's destination. Believing that de Grasse would return {{a portion of his}} fleet to Europe, Rodney detached Rear Admiral Sir Samuel Hood with 14 ships of the line and orders to find de Grasse's destination in North America. Rodney, who was ill, sailed for Europe {{with the rest of his}} fleet in order to recover, refit his fleet, and to avoid the Atlantic hurricane season.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} week of August, US troops on these hills could see minor North Korean {{activity}} across the river, which they thought were North Koreans organizing the high ground {{on the west side of}} the Naktong against a possible American attack. There were occasional attacks on the 9th Infantry's forward positions, but to the men in the front lines this appeared to be only a standard patrol action. On August 31, the UN forces were <b>alerted</b> <b>to</b> a pending attack when much of the Korean civilian labor force fled the front lines. Intelligence officers reported an attack was coming.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, the {{controversy}} was revived. <b>Alerted</b> <b>to</b> the incident, American Association for Cancer Research (AACR), which had established the Cornelius P. Rhoads Memorial Award in 1979, commissioned a new investigation. It {{was led by}} Jay Katz, emeritus professor at Yale Law School and a specialist in medical ethics. He concluded {{there was no evidence}} of unethical human experimentation, but the letter was so offensive that the prize should be renamed. AACR concurred and stripped the honor from Rhoads because of his racism.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, two further short {{clips from}} The Power of the Daleks– {{along with a}} higher-quality version {{of one of the}} extant scenes– were {{discovered}} in a 1966 episode of the BBC science series Tomorrow's World. The clips, lasting less than 10 seconds each and on film (as opposed to film recordings), came to light when the Tomorrow's World segment was broadcast as part of the 11 September 2005 edition of the clip-based nostalgia show Sunday Past Times on BBC Two. After being <b>alerted</b> <b>to</b> the footage, Paul Vanezis of the Doctor Who Restoration Team tracked down the uncut version of the clip.|$|E
5|$|In later years, Ernest Aris would blatantly plagiarise {{not only}} the Peter Rabbit {{character}} in his The Treasure Seekers but Jemima in his Mrs. Beak Duck. Potter was restrained when <b>alerted</b> <b>to</b> the imitations: she praised his technical artistry but chastised him {{for a lack of}} originality. At the time, her eyesight was deteriorating and her days were heavily invested in operating her farm; her restraint with Aris may be attributed to her desire to enlist him as a collaborator.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Bernard appears dead, {{probably}} because {{of a heart attack}} but Monk cannot guarantee it. He steals Bernard's cup and, with a lighter borrowed from Beach, proceeds to burn away the wine to reveal a mysterious liquid at the bottom. However, the flight attendant, Leigh Harrison (Brooke Adams), is <b>alerted</b> <b>to</b> Monk's use of a lighter on board, and confiscates both the lighter and the glass, dumping the liquid down the sink.|$|E

5|$|The British {{had been}} <b>alerted</b> <b>to</b> Arnold's {{approach}} and had destroyed {{all of the}} boats on the river's southern banks. Although two warships, the frigate Lizard (26 guns) and the sloop-of-war Hunter (16 guns), kept up a constant patrol to prevent a river crossing, Arnold was able to procure sufficient watercraft for his men, and crossed to the Quebec City side on November 11. He then realized his force was {{not strong enough to}} capture the city, so he retreated several miles and waited for Montgomery.|$|E
5|$|The {{deployment}} of Spitfires to Australia was kept secret {{so that the}} Japanese were not <b>alerted</b> <b>to</b> their presence, and the Australian Government directed that the aircraft {{be referred to as}} Capstans (after the brand of cigarettes) and their Merlin engines as Marvels. General Douglas MacArthur, the commander of Allied forces in the South West Pacific Area, agreed that the Australian Government could choose when to announce the presence of the Spitfires, but warned against exaggerating the impact they were likely to have.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} book displays Potter's willingness {{to exploit the}} commercial possibilities of her characters and tales. The purchaser was <b>alerted</b> <b>to</b> the existence of other Potter books on the inside front cover and directed {{to a list of}} books on the back cover. Other merchandise included sets of linen or silk placemats painted by Potter for friends with an abridged text and 12 of the illustrations. In 1910, Potter patented a design for a soft toy duck based on her model of Jemima in a Paisley handkerchief shawl and bonnet. A soft Jemima doll was manufactured by J. I. Farnell of Acton.|$|E

5|$|The {{resistance}} was <b>alerted</b> <b>to</b> carry out these tasks by messages personnels transmitted by the BBC's French service from London. Several hundred of these messages, {{which might be}} snatches of poetry, quotations from literature, or random sentences, were regularly transmitted, masking the few that were actually significant. In the weeks preceding the landings, lists of messages and their meanings were distributed to resistance groups. An increase in radio activity on 5 June was correctly interpreted by German intelligence to mean that an invasion was imminent or underway. However, because of the barrage of previous false warnings and misinformation, most units ignored the warning.|$|E
5|$|The {{story for}} The Battle for Middle-earth II {{is divided into}} Good and Evil Campaigns. The Good Campaign focuses on Glorfindel, an Elf who is <b>alerted</b> <b>to</b> a planned attack on the Elven {{sanctuary}} of Rivendell. With help from the Dwarves and other Good forces, the Elves attempt to eliminate Sauron and his army to restore peace in Middle-earth. In the Evil Campaign, Sauron sends the Mouth of Sauron and the Nazgûl to muster wild Goblins. With his army, Sauron moves forward with his plan to destroy the remaining Good forces in the North.|$|E

Howe with Bond's gun and sets {{fire to the}} building to frame Bond for the murder and kill him and Sutton at the same time. Bond and Sutton survive the fire, but when the police prepare to arrest Bond for the murders of Howe and Chuck, he and Sutton escape in a fire truck.|$|E

It was only after Carpathia docked– three days after Titanics sinking– that the full scope of the disaster became public knowledge.|$|E
5|$|While {{entering}} the landing pattern, crash trucks would {{travel to the}} runway and await landing. This was standard procedure for all Head Start landings. After landing, the crew was interrogated prior to being released, so that maintenance, intelligence, and other crews could be <b>alerted</b> <b>to</b> {{the performance of the}} plane and other items that the crew might have noticed during their flight. After release, they would typically go to the Physical Conditioning room for a steam bath and rubdown.|$|E
5|$|According to Karl James, no {{detailed}} {{orders were}} produced {{for the attack}} and deliberate planning was hastily completed {{with little or no}} co-ordination between the attacking infantry regiments. In addition, to increase the size of the infantry force, troops from the field artillery regiment were quickly re-roled as riflemen. In the meantime, the Australians on Slater's Knoll, having been <b>alerted</b> <b>to</b> the possibility of a large-scale attack began adjusting their defences. The soldiers cleared fields off fire and set out clear engagement areas to the north, northwest and south of the knoll, to allow maximum effectiveness of their supporting Vickers medium machine guns and Bren light machine guns. Barbed wire was laid out, and booby traps set.|$|E
