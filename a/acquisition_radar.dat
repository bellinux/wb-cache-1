5|$|This led to {{proposals}} {{for a new}} radar dedicated solely to the early warning role, determining only which MAR or SCD would ultimately {{have to deal with}} the threat. Used primarily in the first minutes of the attack, and not responsible for the engagements, the system could be considered disposable and did not need anything like the sophistication or hardening of the MAR. This led to the Perimeter <b>Acquisition</b> <b>Radar</b> (PAR), which would operate cheaper electronics at VHF frequencies.|$|E

25|$|Central <b>Acquisition</b> <b>Radar,</b> a {{state of}} the art planar array S-Band radar {{operating}} on the stacked beam principle. With a range of 180km, it can track while scan 200 fighter sized targets. Its systems are integrated on high mobility, locally built TATRA trucks for the Army and Air Force; however it is meant to be used by all three services. Initially developed for the long-running Akash SAM system, seven were ordered by the Indian Air Force for their radar modernisation programme and two of another variant were ordered by the Indian Navy for their P-28 Corvettes. The CAR has been a significant success for radar development in India, with its state of the art signal processing hardware. The ROHINI is the IAF specific variant while the REVATHI is the Indian Navy specific variant. The ROHINI has a more advanced Indian developed antenna in terms of power handling and beamforming technology while the REVATHI adds two axis stabilisation for operation in naval conditions, as well as extra naval modes.|$|E

25|$|On September 4, the IDF {{withdrew from}} the Alayh and Shuf Districts, falling back to the Awwali River. The LAF was not {{prepared}} to fill the void, moving instead to occupy the key junction at Khaldah, south of BIA. That same day, BIA was again shelled, killing two Marines and wounding two others. No retaliation was given due to the ROE. As the LAF moved slowly eastward into the foothills of the Shuf, accounts of massacres, conducted by Christians and Druze alike, began to be reported. On September 5, a Druze force, reportedly reinforced by PLO elements, routed the Christian LF militia at Bhamdun and all but eliminated the LF as a military factor in the Alayh District. This defeat obliged the LAF to occupy Suq-AlGharb to avoid conceding all of the high ground overlooking BIA to the Druze. U.S. positions were again subjected to constant indirect fire attacks; consequently, counterbattery fire based on target <b>acquisition</b> <b>radar</b> data was employed. F-14 tactical airborne reconnaissance (TARPS) missions were conducted {{for the first time on}} September 7. On September 8, naval gunfire from offshore destroyers was employed for the first time in defense of the U.S. Marines.|$|E
500|$|When Zeus {{was still}} {{in the early stages of}} design, Bell Labs {{suggested}} using two similar radars to provide extended range tracking and improve reaction times. Located at the Zeus bases would be the Local <b>Acquisition</b> <b>Radar</b> (LAR), a UHF monopulse radar able to track between 50 and 100 targets. The Forward <b>Acquisition</b> <b>Radar</b> (FAR) would be positioned [...] ahead of the Zeus bases to provide early warning of up to 200 to 300seconds of tracking data on up to 200 targets. The FAR would broadcast 10MW pulses at UHF between 405–495MHz, allowing it to detect a 1square metre radar reflection at [...] or a more typical 0.1m2 target at [...] Each track would be stored as a 200 bit file including location, velocity, time of measure and a measure of the quality of the data. Clouds of objects would be tracked as a single object with additional data indicating the width and length of the cloud. Tracks could be updated every five seconds while the target was in view, but the antenna rotated at a relatively slow 4RPM so targets moved significantly between rotations. Each FAR could feed data to up to three Zeus sites.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} the Zeus plans were being {{finalized}} in 1957, plans for FAR were deemphasized, and LAR had been upgraded to become the Zeus <b>Acquisition</b> <b>Radar</b> (ZAR) which provided wide area early warning and initial tracking information. This enormously powerful radar was driven by multiple 1.8MW klystrons and broadcast through three [...] wide antennas arranged as the outside edges of a rotating equilateral triangle. The ZAR spun at 10RPM, but with three antennas it simulated a single antenna rotating three times as fast. Each target was scanned every two seconds, providing much more data than the earlier FAR/LAR concept.|$|E

50|$|The {{idea for}} this system {{was to protect}} Moscow from nuclear attack by the United States. The Russian {{government}} began studies during 1958 with preliminary designs from General Designer K. B. Kisunko. Further designs and development were moved to TsNPO Vympel.Radar systems were tested with Duna-3 single direction search radar and the Dunay-3U omni-direction 360-degree search radar, designed by V. P. Sosulnikov and A. N. Musatov, respectively. A more advanced system of radars were included, the Don-2N System; consisting of the 6000 km long-range early warning systems, (NATO code names Pill Box and Hen House), and the 2800 km short-range target <b>acquisition</b> <b>radars</b> (NATO codenames Dog House and Cat House).|$|R
500|$|On 24 January 1962, the Zeus <b>Acquisition</b> <b>Radar</b> at Kwajalein {{achieved}} {{its first}} returns from an ICBM target, and on 18 April {{was used to}} track Kosmos 2. On the 19 January it reacquired Kosmos 2 and successfully transferred the track {{to one of the}} TTRs. On 26 June the first all-up test against an Atlas target was attempted. The ZAR began successfully tracking the target at [...] and properly handed off to a TTR. The TTR switched tracks from the missile fuselage to the warhead at [...] When the fuselage began to break up, the computer switched to clutter mode, which watched the TTR data for any derivation from the originally calculated trajectory, which would indicate that it had begun tracking debris. It also continued to predict the location of the warhead, and if the system decided it was tracking debris, it would wait for the debris and warhead to separate enough to begin tracking them again. However, the system failed to properly record when the warhead was lost, and tracking was never regained.|$|E
500|$|Additional {{tracking}} {{tests were}} carried out by Target Tracking Radars (TTRs) at Bell's Whippany, NJ labs and an installation on Ascension Island. The latter was first used {{in an attempt to}} track a SM-68 Titan on 29 March 1961, but the data download from Cape Canaveral simulating Zeus <b>Acquisition</b> <b>Radar</b> (ZAR) information failed. A second test on 28 May was successful. Later in the year the Ascension site tracked a series of four test launches, two Atlas, two Titan, generating tracking information for as long as 100 seconds. A ZAR at White Sands reached initial operation in June 1961, and was tested against balloons, aircraft, parachutes deployed from sounding rockets and Hercules missiles. A TTR was completed at White Sands in November, and testing with the complete system of ZAR, TTR and MTR ("all-up" [...] tests) began that month. On 14 December a Zeus passed within [...] of a Nike Hercules being used as a test target, a success that was repeated in March 1962. On 5 June 1963, President Kennedy and Vice President Lyndon Johnson visited White Sands to view missile launches, including a Zeus launch.|$|E
