The gas also transfers heat from the tungsten electrode to the metal, and it helps start and maintain a stable arc.|$|E

In this case, it <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> to analyze the failure results to decide where to act. If the model implements wrong behavior, it <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> to review the conceptual model definition. If the model behaves correctly, but it is not sufficiently accurate, it may <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> to use another primitive element architecture (tradeoff step).

Ways of reducing negative human impact are environmentally-friendly chemical engineering, environmental resources management and environmental protection.

At Wilberforce, Du Bois was strongly influenced by Alexander Crummell, who believed that ideas and morals <b>are</b> <b>necessary</b> tools to effect social change. While at Wilberforce, Du Bois married Nina Gomer, one of his students, on May 12, 1896.|$|E

Since many complex genetic interactions <b>are</b> <b>necessary</b> for neurons to perform the simplest tasks, it is hard to isolate one gene to study this behavior. For this same reason, multiple genes are likely responsible for deferred gratification. Further research is necessary to discover the genetic corollaries to delayed gratification.|$|E
5|$|Neuropsychological tests {{such as the}} mini–mental state {{examination}} (MMSE) are widely {{used to evaluate the}} cognitive impairments needed for diagnosis. More comprehensive test arrays <b>are</b> <b>necessary</b> for high reliability of results, particularly in the earliest stages of the disease. Neurological examination in early AD will usually provide normal results, except for obvious cognitive impairment, which may not differ from that resulting from other diseases processes, including other causes of dementia.|$|E

Those in opposition to a release of the photos expressed concern that the photos would inflame anti-American sentiment in the Middle East.|$|E
