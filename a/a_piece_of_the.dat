5|$|The {{wreckage}} of the aircraft was salvaged by 63 Maintenance Unit between 11 and 16 May 1941 and was taken to Oxford to be stored.

5|$|Another {{change in}} the 1370s was the {{formalisation}} {{of the process of}} guarding and maintaining the walls. During the invasion scare of 1377, Edward instructed the mayor to review these processes; it appears that the four wards of the town were surveyed, and each property was assigned <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wall to maintain, varying according {{to the size of the}} property. For these purposes, the walls were measured out in units called loupes, or embrasures. The four wards were also responsible for the security and policing of the town.|$|E
5|$|Between the Octagon and {{the main}} {{gatehouse}} in the north wall was a barbican, of which little survives– just <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> west wall– although the structure was originally two storeys high. The surviving fabric includes a slot for a portcullis for the barbican's north gate, {{although there are no}} hinges for gates. The base of a garderobe demonstrates that second storey would have provided space for habitation, probably a guard room. Drawings from the late 18th century show the ground floor of the barbican still standing and includes detail such as vaulting inside the passageway.|$|E

5|$|Burial 68 {{was found}} in the centre of the Group 18 plaza. The corpse was poorly preserved, it was laid out on its back with the skull towards the north. The remains were covered with small pieces of {{limestone}} mixed with brown soil. <b>A</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper jaw indicated that the remains were those of a child aged between 5 and 10 years old.

Presto antagonizes Alec again, covering the carrot with a cloth before smashing it into a pulp with <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ladder.

5|$|The {{skull of}} RAM 14000 is almost complete, {{with the left}} side only lacking <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> maxilla. However, the skull was split down the middle by erosion, {{possibly}} when it was resting {{on the bottom of}} a river bed. The two sides are displaced slightly, with some bones of the right being moved off the main block, also by erosion. After reconstruction, the skull viewed from the side resembles other juvenile lambeosaurines found, being roughly a trapezoid in shape.|$|E

5|$|Bulbs {{offered for}} sale are {{referred}} to as either 'round' or 'double nose'. Round bulbs are circular in cross section and produce a single flower stem, while double nose bulbs have more than one bulb stem attached at the base and produce two or more flower stems, but bulbs with more than two stems are unusual. Planted narcissi bulbs produce daughter bulbs in the axil of the bulb scales, leading to the dying off of the exterior scales. To prevent planted bulbs forming more and more small bulbs, they can be dug up every 5–7 years, and the daughters separated and replanted separately, provided that <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> basal plate, where the rootlets are formed, is preserved. For daffodils to flower {{at the end of the}} winter or early spring, bulbs are planted in autumn (September–November). This plant does well in ordinary soil but flourishes best in rich soil. Daffodils like the sun but also accepts partial shade exposure.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ensuing}} battle, Dinah faces off against her former friend, accidentally decapitating Edaniel in the process. An enraged Edrear {{attempts}} to kill her, but eventually halts when Dinah {{points out that}} he's crying for his brother, something that he's normally unable to do and that's being caused by Maphohetka's influence. Knowing that he's been compromised, Edrear stabs himself with his own sword, leaving Dinah to mourn him and share one kiss. Maphohetka, taking the opportunity, destroys Dinah's scythe (the only thing she had that could potentially kill her) and ends up mutating into a large monster. After Dinah is captured in Maphohetka's body, she happens upon the entity's core, which is Maphohetka's decayed corpse. Using Eniri's bracelet to see into the monster, she finds that <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cross Maphohetka was stabbed with during her hanging is still lodged in her chest, allowing Dinah {{to conclude that the}} piece is what keeps the evil spirit anchored in the living world. Dinah removes the cross shard, causing Maphohetka to fade away.|$|E
5|$|In their {{original}} contracts {{for the first}} season, cast members were paid $22,500 per episode. The cast members received different salaries in the second season, beginning from the $20,000 range to $40,000 per episode. Before their salary negotiations for the third season, the cast decided to enter collective negotiations, despite Warner Bros.' preference for individual deals. The actors were given the salary of the least-paid cast member, meaning Aniston and Schwimmer had their salaries reduced. The stars were paid $75,000 per episode in season three, $85,000 in season four, $100,000 in season five, $125,000 in season six, $750,000 in seasons seven and eight, and $1million in seasons nine and ten, making Aniston, Cox, and Kudrow the highest paid TV actresses of all-time. The cast also received syndication royalties beginning in 2000 after renegotiations. At the time, that financial benefit of <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> show's lucrative back end profits had only been given out to stars who had ownership rights in a show, like Jerry Seinfeld and Bill Cosby.|$|E

5|$|On {{board the}} Forerunner ship, the Master Chief is {{captured}} and interrogated by Covenant forces, but manages to escape using a concealed weapon. On Earth, Ruwan and Tyla escape detection by the Covenant and appropriate a vehicle {{in an effort}} to escape. Ruwan reveals that the Key is in fact a fictional object that he and his brother James Ackerson made up as children; James told the Covenant about the Key in order to prevent the outright destruction of Cleveland. After fighting Covenant forces, Ruwan and Tyla are rescued by marines and leave the city. The Master Chief attempts to kill the Covenant's leader, Prophet of Truth, but is discovered as he takes aim; Truth escapes as the Chief is left to kill the Prophet's guards and find a way off the ship. Learning {{that there is no way}} to change the Forerunner ship's destination, the Chief jumps to Earth using <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vessel as a heat shield.|$|E
5|$|Spectre grossed $880.7 million worldwide; $135.5 {{million of}} the takings were {{generated}} from the UK market and $200.1 million from North America. Worldwide, this made it the second highest-grossing James Bond film after Skyfall, and the sixth highest-grossing film of 2015. Deadline.com calculated the net profit of the film to be $98.4 million when factoring together all expenses and revenues for the film. Sony had expected the net profit of the film to be around $38 million had it performed to {{the same level of}} its predecessor. But since it earned 20 per cent less than Skyfall, the profit in actual was $24.6 million. Sony paid 50 percent of the production costs for the film — which totalled some $250 million after accounting for government incentives — but received only 25 percent of certain profits, once costs were recouped. The studio also spent {{tens of millions of dollars}} in marketing and had to give MGM <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> profit from the studio's non-Bond films, including 22 Jump Street.|$|E
5|$|The Brick Lane {{screening}} – on 8 December 1995 – {{had been}} previewed in NME, and was chaotically busy. It was originally planned {{for a car}} park, but freezing conditions and snow forced a rethink and the screening was moved indoors, to {{the basement of the}} nearby Seven Stars pub. Hundreds of people crammed in to watch the screening, which was eventually abandoned partway through due to the cramped conditions. The NME preview had claimed that after the screening the film would be cut up and individual frames sold off to the public. Gimpo, the owner of the film, had no intention of doing so, but after the screening was nearly overwhelmed by a mob of people wanting to take home <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film.|$|E
