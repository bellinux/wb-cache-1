25|$|Air-air heat pumps, that extract {{heat from}} outside air and {{transfer}} this heat to inside air, {{are the most}} common type of heat pumps and the cheapest. These are similar to air conditioners operating in reverse. <b>Air-water</b> heat pumps are otherwise similar to air-air heat pumps, but they transfer the extracted heat into a water heating circuit, floor heating being the most efficient, and they can also transfer heat into a domestic hot water tank for use in showers and hot water taps of the building. However, ground-water heat pumps are more efficient than <b>air-water</b> heat pumps, and therefore they are often the better choice for providing heat for the floor heating and domestic hot water systems.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, the Gibbs {{isotherm}} {{predicts that}} inorganic salts have negative surface concentrations. However, this view {{has been challenged}} extensively in recent years due {{to a combination of}} more precise interfacially sensitive experiments and theoretical models, both of which predict an increase in surface propensity of the halides with increasing size and polarizability. As such, surface tension is not a reliable method for determining the relative propensity of ions toward the <b>air-water</b> interface.|$|E
25|$|Liquindi {{is water}} drumming, {{typically}} practiced by Pygmy women and girls. The sound {{is produced by}} persons standing in water, and hitting {{the surface of the}} water with their hands, such as to trap air in the hands and produce a percussive effect that arises by sudden change in air pressure of the trapped air. The sound cannot exist entirely in water, since it requires the <b>air-water</b> boundary as a surface to be struck, so the sound is not hydraulophonic.|$|E
25|$|The {{beginning}} of nest building is {{preceded by a}} courtship ritual. This pair formation consists of {{the male and female}} swimming parallel to each other, the male and female facing each other and contacting their barbels, the male stimulating the flanks of the female, the swimming to the surface by the male and female and production of the first bubbles at the nest site, and adding further bubbles to the nest under construction. The male produces most of the foam. First, the male and female come to the surface and swim belly-up in small circles. The film of the <b>air-water</b> interface is swallowed and pumped out through the gills, where it gains mucus. Movement of the pelvic fins stirs the water and mucus, captures air bubbles, and breaks these air bubbles into a foam. The female may add some bubbles to the nest under construction. Pelvic fin movement differs between sexes; males move their pelvic fins in a side-to-side fashion, while females open and close their pelvic fins. The male often dives to the bottom to retrieve plant debris; filamentous nest materials are preferred, which are knitted together in the nest by the male. The male creates an upward water current with its tail fin that lift plant materials up. Then, the male uses its developed pectoral fin spines to cary the plant materials to the nest. The male uses its mouth and pectoral fins to incorporate the plant material into the foam mass of the nest. Females neither have developed pectoral fin spines nor do they help in transporting plant debris. The end result is a dome-shaped nest made up of loosely interwoven plant material on top of tightly interwoven plant material, held up to the surface with a layer of foam; the eggs will be laid on top of this foam from below.|$|E

60|$|Cethru, {{left alone}} in the dark thoroughfare, sighed heavily; then, {{spitting}} on his hands, he tightened the old girdle round his loins, and slinging the lanthorn on his staff, held it up to the level of his waist, and began to make his way along the street. His progress was but slow, for he had many times to stop and rekindle the flame within his lanthorn, which the bats' wings, his own stumbles, and the jostlings of footpads or of revellers returning home, were for ever extinguishing. In traversing that long street he spent half the night, and half the night in traversing it back again. The saffron swan of dawn, slow swimming up the sky-river between the high roof-banks, bent her neck down through the dark <b>air-water</b> to look at him staggering below her, with his still smoking wick. No sooner did Cethru see that sunlit bird, than with a great sigh of joy he sat him down, and at once fell asleep.|$|E
50|$|Mixtures of air {{and water}} vapor {{are the most common}} systems {{encountered}} in psychrometry. The psychrometric ratio of <b>air-water</b> vapor mixtures is approximately unity, which implies that the difference between the adiabatic saturation temperature and wet bulb temperature of <b>air-water</b> vapor mixtures is small.

50|$|LB {{films are}} formed when {{amphiphilic}} molecules like surfactants or nanoparticles interact with air at an <b>air-water</b> interface. Surfactants (or surface-acting agents) are molecules with hydrophobic 'tails' and hydrophilic 'heads'. When surfactant concentration {{is less than}} critical micellar concentration (CMC), the surfactant molecules arrange themselves as shown in Figure 1 below. This tendency {{can be explained by}} surface-energy considerations. Since the tails are hydrophobic, their exposure to air is favoured over that to water. Similarly, since the heads are hydrophilic, the head-water interaction is more favourable than <b>air-water</b> interaction. The overall effect is reduction in the surface energy (or equivalently, surface tension of water).|$|E
