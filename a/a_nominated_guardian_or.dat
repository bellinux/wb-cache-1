40|$|POLICY When exigent {{circumstances}} {{are determined to}} exist for an alleged victim of Child Abuse and/or Neglect (CA/N) interview, the Indiana Department of Child Services (DCS) {{is not required to}} obtain consent from the child’s parent, <b>guardian,</b> <b>or</b> custodian prior to interviewing the child. DCS defines exigent circumstances as situations that would cause a reasonable person to believe that a timely interview (See separate policy, 3. 9 Initiation Times for Assessments) with the child is necessary due to concerns for the child’s well-being and safety, and that seeking parental, <b>guardian,</b> <b>or</b> custodian consent first may cause harm to the child or place the child at greater risk. DCS will assume exigent circumstances exist when: 1. The parent, <b>guardian,</b> <b>or</b> custodian is the alleged perpetrator or is allegedly aware of the maltreatment of the child victim and has allegedly not assured his or her safety; 2. The safety of the alleged child victim might be jeopardized by delaying the interview and/or notifying the parent, <b>guardian,</b> <b>or</b> custodian; 3. There is reason to believe that essential evidence would not be available if there were delay or notice; 4. [NEW] The homeless unaccompanied minor is voluntarily receiving shelter from an emergency shelter or shelter care facility without the presence or consent of a parent, <b>guardian,</b> <b>or</b> custodian; or 5. When exigent circumstances do not exist, DCS will seek consent from the child’s parent, <b>guardian,</b> <b>or</b> custodian prior to conducting an interview with a child. See related policy...|$|R

50|$|In modern U.S. law, wills are not {{required}} to be registered prior to death in most states, but are registered and put in the public record after the person making the will dies and the estate is probated. However, it is often still {{a good idea to have}} the signing and witnessing of a will notarized, to reduce the risk of disputes over the will's validity after death. Wills can be used to <b>nominate</b> <b>guardians</b> for minor children, but because children are not property, the will cannot have the final word on the question. Guardianship is decided by courts, though the usual outcome is that guardianship is awarded to the other surviving parent, or, if no parents survive, to the <b>guardian</b> <b>nominated</b> in the last surviving parent's will.|$|R
