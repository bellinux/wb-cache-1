In the library he found three books by the Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier. Pei {{was inspired by the}} innovative designs of the new International style, characterized by simplified form and the use of glass and steel materials. Le Corbusier visited MIT in , an occasion which powerfully affected Pei: [...] "The two days with Le Corbusier, or 'Corbu' <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>used</b> to call him, were probably the most important days in my architectural education." [...] Pei was also influenced by the work of US architect Frank Lloyd Wright. In 1938 he drove to Spring Green, Wisconsin, to visit Wright's famous Taliesin building. After waiting for two hours, however, he left without meeting Wright.|$|E
500|$|After {{some time}} {{developing}} demos, the musicians returned to Henson in March 2012, recording seven songs before the band {{decided to take}} a break, as according to guitarist Mike McCready [...] "we had to take some time to figure out what we wanted to do." [...] Guitarist Stone Gossard added that despite the bandmembers thinking that after the productive sessions the album was nearing completion, eventually they considered the tracks [...] "didn’t feel strong enough for a record. Work on the album resumed only in March 2013 as the bandmembers regrouped with new compositions, mostly done separatedly in each member's home studio—though McCready at times worked along with drummer Matt Cameron—before the group reunited to finish the songs together. O'Brien attributed the long break to the band's busy schedule, as the musicians got into side projects after putting the Pearl Jam album on hold: singer Eddie Vedder started a solo tour, drummer Matt Cameron returned to Soundgarden, guitarist Stone Gossard rejoined side project Brad, Ament recorded solo album While My Heart Beats and started the project RNDM, and McCready formed the group Walking Papers while also taking part in a partial reunion of Mad Season. Vedder still considered that all the diversions helped Pearl Jam to have [...] "more importance placed on the records" [...] and focusing on making the best album possible. Like with previous records the songs had their first recordings with all the musicians playing together, though O'Brien added that with Lightning Bolt [...] "we don’t keep as much of [...] <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>used</b> to." [...] Guest musicians include O'Brien himself at the keyboards, long time keyboardist Boom Gaspar, and violinist Ann Marie Calhoun. After six weeks of new recording sessions, the album was mixed in Seattle at the band's desire, with the process taking place in Studio X.|$|E

That's where the title came from. And then <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>used</b> to play 7 nights a week, we were battling for material, we'd go for very long jams on that song, {{sometimes}} 20minutes at a time. And during the long outros, I would hear {{and come up with}} different passages, so I would often jot them down and rehearse them and add or take out a bit here and there. Today, I believe that the lyric is about a personal journey, a journey through lifetimes to your soul evolution." ...|$|E

He stated that capitalism had become the more revolutionary economic system, and he welcomed globalisation as [...] "innovative and internationalist", but added, [...] "I don't think that the contradictions, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>used</b> to say, of the system, are by any means all resolved." [...] He also stated that he had a renewed interest in the freedom of the individual from the state, but that he still considered libertarianism [...] "ahistorical" [...] both on the world stage and in the work of creating a stable and functional society, adding that libertarians are [...] "more worried about the over-mighty state than the unaccountable corporation" [...] whereas [...] "the present state of affairs... combines the worst of bureaucracy with the worst of the insurance companies." [...] He also said that libertarians did not have a clear foreign policy stance.|$|E

In response to anti-immigrant rallies in the eastern city of Dresden in late 2014, Schäuble said that immigration is good for Germany and politicians must explain better that everyone stands to gain from it; at the time, the number of asylum seekers in Germany, many from Syria, had more than doubled within a year to around 200,000, and net immigration was at its highest level in two decades. [...] "Just <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>used</b> millions of refugees and expellees after World War Two to rebuild.. so we need immigration today," [...] Schäuble told Bild {{when asked about the}} popularity of anti-immigration policies. Also, he held that [...] "people are right to fear Islamist terrorism. But not Islam." [...] In September 2015, he urged the Member States of the European Union to quickly establish a common European asylum law.|$|E

[...] "Over {{the last couple of}} years me and Jim have been writing a lot of songs, but we haven't known which way to {{approach}} them really. With Return to Base we were really pleased with the album, we thought that it turned out really well, but it didn't sell. Everyone around the band was saying to us that we weren't coming up with as good songs <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>used</b> to, but me and Jim knew that we were, we knew that we were coming up with strong songs. Some of the songs on Return to Base we thought were some of the best songs that we'd ever written. There only seemed to be me and Jim that had confidence in the songs; people like Chas, Dave and Don said that they didn't think our songs were as strong, some of them they did but some of them they didn't. But we ourselves thought that they were. Thus it was a case of getting the album down; and in our minds it turned out to be a great album." ...|$|E
