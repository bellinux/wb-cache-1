5|$|A {{report in}} 1997 {{described}} use of sponges {{as a tool}} by bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay in Western Australia. <b>A</b> <b>dolphin</b> will attach a marine sponge to its rostrum, which is presumably then used to protect it when searching for food in the sandy sea bottom. The behavior, known as sponging, has only been observed in this bay, and is almost exclusively shown by females. A study in 2005 concluded that mothers teach the behavior to their daughters, and that all the sponge-users are closely related, suggesting {{that it is a}} fairly recent innovation.|$|E
5|$|In {{another story}} further {{upstream}} the Yangtze, the baiji {{was the daughter}} of a general who was deported from the city of Wuhan during a war. During his duty, the daughter ran away. Later, the general met a woman who told him how her father was a general, and when he realized that she was his daughter, he threw himself into the river out of shame. The daughter ran after him and also fell into the river. Before they were drowned, the daughter was transformed into <b>a</b> <b>dolphin,</b> and the general a porpoise.|$|E
5|$|Other {{television}} appearances by bottlenose dolphins include Wonder Woman, Highway to Heaven, Dolphin Cove, seaQuest DSV, and The Penguins of Madagascar, {{in which}} <b>a</b> <b>dolphin,</b> Doctor Blowhole, is a villain. In the HBO movie Zeus and Roxanne, a female bottlenose dolphin befriends a male dog, and in Bermuda Triangle, {{a girl named}} Annie (played by Lisa Jakub) swims with dolphins.

5|$|The fort was {{surveyed}} by the geologist Thomas Sopwith in the 19th {{century and the}} historian R.G. Collingwood in the 20th, with a geophysics survey in the 21st, {{but it has not}} been fully excavated. Among finds at the fort are altars with inscriptions to Hercules by the 6th Legion of the Roman army (normally stationed at York) and to Apollo by the fort's garrison of auxiliaries, the 2nd Cohort of Nervians. Other finds include a midden containing shoes; coins, fragments of Samian pottery, beads, nails, and a bronze handle shaped like <b>a</b> <b>dolphin.</b>|$|E
5|$|The six {{pieces of}} painted Italian maiolica, or painted and tin-glazed earthenware, are all {{larger than the}} average, and there are none of the dishes that {{are the most common}} maiolica shape. The {{earliest}} piece is a large statue of Fortuna standing on <b>a</b> <b>dolphin,</b> holding a sail, by Giovanni della Robbia, made in Florence about 1500–10. This is a rare representative of the Early to High Italian Renaissance in the bequest.|$|E
5|$|The west {{tower is}} surmounted with crenellations and pinnacles and is {{supported}} by stepped buttresses at each corner. The buttresses are constructed from flint and stone, and have arched insets on the faces. They rest on stone plinths, each bearing carved shields, that on the north buttress with an inaccurate rendering of {{the arms of the}} see, and the other with a cross and <b>a</b> <b>dolphin.</b> The tower has three Perpendicular windows in the belfry and a large Perpendicular window in its western face, giving light to the west end of the nave.|$|E

50|$|During his career, DeBerg also {{acquired}} {{a reputation for}} playing through particularly gruesome or unique injuries. He played with laryngitis and wore a portable amplifier during regular-season games with San Francisco. He also played with a broken non-throwing hand and an exposed metal pin sticking out of his finger in a Chiefs playoff game in 1990. In 1993, he left <b>a</b> <b>Dolphins</b> game versus the New York Giants battered and bloodied after taking a helmet to the chin, only {{to return to the}} game following halftime.

5|$|Adult males live mostly {{alone or}} in groups of two to three, and join pods for short periods of time. Adult females and young {{dolphins}} normally live in groups of up to 15 animals. However, they live in fission-fusion societies of varying group size, within which individuals change associations, often on a daily or hourly basis. Group compositions are usually determined by sex, age, reproductive condition, familial relations and affiliation histories. In <b>a</b> <b>dolphin</b> community near Sarasota, Florida, the most common group types are adults females with their recent offspring, older subadults of both sexes and adult males either {{alone or in}} bonded pairs. Smaller groups can join to form larger groups of 100 or more, and occasionally exceed 1,000.|$|E
5|$|For example, {{near the}} mouth of the Yangtze, the baiji was a princess that had lost her parents and had lived with her step-father, whom she had longed to get away from. The step-father wanted to trade her since she would have been sold for a great sum of money, but as they were {{crossing}} the river to get to the trader, a storm rolled in, and they were drenched. The step-father, enraged, tried to take her, but she plunged herself into the river. Before being drowned in the river, she was transformed into <b>a</b> <b>dolphin,</b> and swam away from her abusive step-father, who also fell in and was transformed into a porpoise.|$|E
5|$|The House of Orpheus in the {{southern}} part of the city thus takes its name from the large mosaic depicting Orpheus playing his harp to an audience of trees, animals and birds. As Paul MacKendrick puts it, the mosaic is rather artlessly executed, as the animals are all of different sizes and face in different directions with no relationship to Orpheus. It appears that the mosaicist simply copied patterns from a book without attempting to integrate the different elements. The mosaic is situated in the triclinium, the dining room, where the diners would have reclined on couches set against the walls and admired the central mosaic. Other mosaics can be seen in the atrium, which has a depiction of Amphitrite in a chariot pulled by a seahorse and accompanied by other sea creatures, and in the bathing rooms. One room off the main courtyard has a mosaic of <b>a</b> <b>dolphin,</b> considered by the Romans to be a lucky animal.|$|E

50|$|Shortly before Gado's {{release from}} Houston, the Miami Dolphins lost {{starting}} running back Ronnie Brown to a torn ACL. As <b>a</b> result, the <b>Dolphins</b> claimed Gado off waivers. However, {{he did not}} see playing time for his first few games in <b>a</b> <b>Dolphins</b> uniform. After Miami's backup running back, Jesse Chatman went down, they re-signed Ricky Williams, <b>a</b> former <b>Dolphin</b> who had done several stints in-and-out of the league, and subsequently cut Gado. However, Williams was injured in his first game back, and Miami re-signed Gado. Gado contributed over the next several weeks, including scoring a touchdown in a game won by the previously 0-13 Dolphins.|$|R
