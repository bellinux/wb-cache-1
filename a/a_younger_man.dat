5|$|By the mid-1970s, Meany {{was past}} his 80th {{birthday}} {{and there were}} increasing calls for him to retire and pass leadership of the AFL-CIO to <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> <b>man.</b> In his final years, Meany took up amateur photography and painting as hobbies.|$|E
5|$|Following No Reservations, Zeta-Jones {{significantly}} decreased her workload in {{the next}} five years. She instead chose to focus on her family and health, having been diagnosed with bipolar II disorder, and her infrequent acting appearances were in smaller-scale and less successful productions. She took on the role of a 40-year-old mother attracted to <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> <b>man</b> (Justin Bartha) in the romantic comedy The Rebound. The production was released theatrically in markets outside of the United States in 2009–10, but due to financial troubles of its distributor, The Film Development, the film failed to release theatrically in America.|$|E

5|$|Upon his {{accession}} Chamberlain considered {{calling a}} general election, but with {{three and a}} half years remaining of the then current Parliament's term he decided to wait. At age 68, he was the second-eldest person in the 20th century (behind Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman) to become Prime Minister for the first time, and was widely seen as a caretaker who would lead the Conservative Party until the next election, and then step down in favour of <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> <b>man,</b> with Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden a likely candidate. From the start of Chamberlain's premiership a number of would-be successors were rumoured to be jockeying for position.|$|E
5|$|Weyland is {{the billionaire}} founder and CEO of Weyland Corp. Lindelof {{described}} him as having a massive ego and suffering from a god complex. Applying the necessary prosthetics and make-up to transform Pearce into the aging Weyland took five hours, and an hour to remove it. Pearce observed elderly individuals to gain insight into the movement for his character, as he found replicating the impeded physical movement {{the most difficult part}} of the role. Max von Sydow was Scott's original choice to play Weyland, but the casting of Pearce made it possible for him to portray Weyland as both an elderly character, and <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> <b>man</b> who appeared in an earlier script draft.|$|E
5|$|Charles August was {{no great}} admirer of Joseph's. As <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> <b>man,</b> he had sought {{the hand of}} Joseph's sister, Archduchess Maria Amalia. She had been quite content to take him, but Joseph and their mother insisted she marry instead the better-connected Duke of Parma. After this disappointment, Charles II August married Maria Amalia of Saxony in 1774; she was the {{daughter}} of the Elector Christian (d. 1765) and his wife Maria Antonia, Max Joseph's sister. In 1769, the reigning Saxon elector, Frederick Augustus III, had married Charles August's sister. Charles August, sometimes called duc de Deux-Ponts (a French translation of Zweibrücken, or two bridges), was a French client and could theoretically draw on French support for his claim. However, he had especially good relations with the Saxon Electors: both his mother- and brother-in-law wanted to ensure that Maria Amalia's husband received his rightful inheritance.|$|E

5|$|Diefenbaker was the {{favourite}} {{throughout the}} leadership campaign. At the convention in Ottawa in December, {{he refused to}} abide by the custom of having a Quebecer be either the proposer or seconder of his candidacy, and instead selected an Easterner (from New Brunswick) and a Westerner to put his name in nomination. With most Quebec delegates backing his opponents, Diefenbaker felt that having a Quebecer as a nominator would not increase his support. Diefenbaker was elected on the first ballot, and a number of Quebec delegates walked out of the convention after his victory. Other Diefenbaker opponents, such as those who had urged Smith to run, believed that the 61-year-old Diefenbaker would be merely a caretaker, who would serve a few years and then step down in favour of <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> <b>man,</b> and that the upcoming election would be lost to the Liberals regardless of who led the Tories.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Peter {{begins to}} insult Lois about her {{advancing}} age, including her minor strands of gray hair. This makes her extremely self-conscious, and soon Lois {{becomes aware of}} her lust for <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> <b>man.</b> After introducing her new boyfriend, Anthony, to the family, Meg goes on to make out {{with him on the}} family couch, with Lois watching over nearby. Jealous of her daughter's new-found love, she begins hitting on Anthony. Later that day, Lois sends Meg to pick up her grandfather, leaving her all alone with Anthony. The two then begin making out on the couch, but Meg returns to the house only a few moments later and discovers them. Angry at her mother for ruining her chance at having a normal boyfriend, Meg threatens Lois to lay off of him, pulling out one of her own teeth in frustration. Lois quickly agrees, but is still angry with Peter for continually insulting her. She confronts him about this, and he admits that he was actually embarrassed about his own advancing age, as well as his lack of fitness, and was only insulting Lois in order to distract her from the fact that she could be with a much better-looking man. He apologizes for his behavior, and Lois forgives him.|$|E

25|$|However, Mafia informers said Provenzano moved between farmhouses in {{the region}} {{every two or three}} nights to evade capture.

25|$|Depending on the source, Nureyev is {{described}} as either bisexual, as he did have heterosexual relationships as <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> <b>man,</b> or gay. He had a turbulent sex life, with numerous bathhouse visits and anonymous pickups. Nureyev met Erik Bruhn, the celebrated Danish dancer, after Nureyev defected to the West in 1961. Nureyev was a great admirer of Bruhn, having seen filmed performances of the Dane on tour in the Soviet Union with the American Ballet Theatre, although stylistically the two dancers were very different. Bruhn and Nureyev became a couple and the two remained together off and on, with a very volatile relationship for 25 years, until Bruhn's death in 1986.|$|E
25|$|The {{period was}} {{dominated}} by infighting between the Labour Party's right wing, led by Hugh Gaitskell, and its left, led by Aneurin Bevan. Many Labour MPs felt that Attlee should have retired after the 1951 election and allowed <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> <b>man</b> to lead the party. Bevan openly called for him to stand down {{in the summer of}} 1954. One of his main reasons for staying on as leader was to frustrate the leadership ambitions of Herbert Morrison, whom Attlee disliked for both political and personal reasons. At one time, Attlee had favoured Aneurin Bevan to succeed him as leader, but this became problematic after Bevan almost irrevocably split the party.|$|E
