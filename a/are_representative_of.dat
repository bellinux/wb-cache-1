5|$|Bivalve {{molluscs}} {{are used}} as bioindicators to monitor the health of aquatic environments in both fresh water and the marine environments. Their population status or structure, physiology, behaviour or the level of contamination with elements or compounds can indicate the state of contamination status of the ecosystem. They are particularly useful since they are sessile so that they <b>are</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> the environment where they are sampled or placed. Potamopyrgus antipodarum is used by some water treatment plants to test for estrogen-mimicking pollutants from industrial agriculture.|$|E
5|$|By the Visean (mid-Carboniferous) stage, {{the early}} {{tetrapods}} had radiated into {{at least three}} or four main branches. Recognizable basal-group tetrapods <b>are</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> the temnospondyls (e.g. Eryops) lepospondyls (e.g. Diplocaulus), anthracosaurs, which were the relatives and ancestors of the Amniota, and possibly the baphetids, which {{are thought to be}} related to temnospondyls and whose status as a main branch is yet unresolved. Depending on which authorities one follows, modern amphibians (frogs, salamanders and caecilians) are most probably derived from either temnospondyls or lepospondyls (or possibly both, although this is now a minority position).|$|E

5|$|The marine {{invertebrate}} fauna of Puerto Rico {{is composed of}} 61 sponges, 171 cnidarians, 8 nemerteans, 1,176 mollusks, 129 annelids (polychaetes), 342 crustaceans, 165 echinoderms, 131 bryozoans, 117 hard corals, 99 soft corals and gorgonians, 13 corallimorphs, and 8 hydrocorals. Coral species found in Puerto Rican reefs <b>are</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> the general Caribbean fauna. Commonly occurring corals include boulder star coral (Montrastaea annularis), finger coral (Porites porites), and elkhorn coral (Acropora palmata).|$|E
5|$|Three {{types of}} habitats, mangroves, reefs and seagrasses, {{are found in}} Puerto Rico's ocean waters. A total of 677 fish species live in these habitats; 242 being reef species. Fish species found in Puerto Rican reefs <b>are</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> the general Caribbean fauna. Common reef fishes include wrasses, damselfishes, white grunts (Haemulon plumieri), bluestriped grunts (Haemulon sciurus), queen {{parrotfish}} (Scarus vetula), and sharks (family Carcharhinidae). Sea breams (Archosargus rhomboidalis) and yellowfin mojarras (Gerres cinereus) {{are some of the}} species commonly found in mangrove habitats. Other species of interest include flatfishes, with 21 recorded species, and sharks, with more than 20 species. Oceanic whitetip sharks and silky sharks are common in the Mona Passage.|$|E
5|$|Two {{archaeological sites}} {{in the city of}} Gifu have shown that the area around modern-day Gifu has had {{residents}} since pre-history because of Gifu's location in the fertile N≈çbi Plain. The Ryomonji and Kotozuka sites have produced large burial mounds that <b>are</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> the late-Yayoi period, which is when rice cultivation began in Japan. As civilization in Japan grew, permanent settlements began to appear and, eventually, the village of Inokuchi was established, which would eventually become the modern city of Gifu.|$|E

5|$|Giorgio de Santillana, {{professor}} of the History of Science in the School of Humanities at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, along with Hertha von Dechend {{believed that the}} old mythological stories handed down from antiquity were not random fictitious tales but were accurate depictions of celestial cosmology clothed in tales to aid their oral transmission. The chaos, monsters and violence in ancient myths <b>are</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> the forces that shape each age. They believed that ancient myths are the remains of preliterate astronomy that became lost {{with the rise of}} the Greco-Roman civilization. Santillana and von Dechend in their book Hamlet's Mill, An Essay on Myth and the Frame of Time (1969) clearly state that ancient myths have no historical or factual basis other than a cosmological one encoding astronomical phenomena, especially the precession of the equinoxes. Santillana and von Dechend's approach is not widely accepted.|$|E
