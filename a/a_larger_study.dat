Piper stated that a figure of as many as 1.5 million total deaths was possible.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{most cases}} of {{fluoride}} poisoning {{have been caused}} by accidental ingestion of insecticides containing inorganic fluorides. Most current calls to poison control centers for possible fluoride poisoning come from the ingestion of fluoride-containing toothpaste. Malfunctioning water fluoridation equipment is another cause: one incident in Alaska affected almost 300 people and killed one person. Dangers from toothpaste are aggravated for small children, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends supervising children below six brushing their teeth so that they do not swallow toothpaste. One regional study examined a year of pre-teen fluoride poisoning reports totaling 87 cases, including one death from ingesting insecticide. Most had no symptoms, but about 30% had stomach pains. <b>A</b> <b>larger</b> <b>study</b> across the U.S. had similar findings: 80% of cases involved children under six, and there were few serious cases.|$|E

25|$|In 1935 Claus Jungeblut {{reported}} that vitamin C treatment inactivates the polio virus in vitro, making it non-infectious when injected into monkeys. In 1937, Jungeblut injected polio into {{the brains of}} monkeys, and found that many more monkeys that also received vitamin C escaped paralysis than controls - the results seemed to indicate that low doses were more effective than high doses. A subsequent study by Jungeblut demonstrated that polio infected monkeys had lower vitamin C levels than others, and that the monkeys that escaped paralysis had the highest vitamin C levels. Jungeblut subsequently confirmed his findings in <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>study,</b> finding that natural vitamin C was more effective than synthetic vitamin C, and as the disease progressed, larger and larger amounts of vitamin C were needed for therapeutic effect.|$|E

25|$|From a {{mitochondrial}} DNA perspective, haplogroup H, {{which has}} high incidence (≈40%) throughout Europe, has received similar attention. Early studies by Richards et al (2000) {{suggested that it}} arose 28–23 kya (thousand years ago), spreading into Europe ≈20kya, before then re-expanding from an Iberian glacial refuge ≈15 kya, calculations subsequently corroborated by Pereira et al. (2005). However, <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>study</b> by Roostalu et al. (2007), incorporating more data from the Near East, suggested that whilst Hg H did begin to expand kya, this {{was limited to the}} Near East, Caucasus and Southeastern Europe. Rather its subsequent spread further west occurred later, in the post-glacial period from a postulated South Caucasian refugium. This hypothesis has been supported by a recent ancient DNA analysis study, which links the expansion of mtDNA Hg H in Western Europe with the Bell Beaker phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|There {{is little}} {{evidence}} to suggest that amalgam fillings have any negative direct effects on pregnancy outcomes or on an infant post-pregnancy. A study, consisting of 72 pregnant women, was conducted {{to determine the effects of}} dental amalgam on babies in utero. Results indicated that although the amount of amalgam the mother had was directly related to the amount of mercury in the amniotic fluid, no negative effects on the fetus were found. <b>A</b> <b>larger</b> <b>study,</b> consisting of 5,585 women who had recently given birth, was used to determine if amalgam restorations during pregnancy had any effects on infant birthweight. Among the study group, 1,117 women had infants with low birth weights and 4,468 women had infants with normal birth weights. Approximately five percent of the women had one or more amalgam filling restorations during their pregnancy term. These women had little to no difference in infant birth weight compared to the women whom did not undergo amalgam restoration during pregnancy.|$|E

2500|$|Subsequent {{studies have}} {{compared}} [...] "on-pump" [...] CABG to off-pump {{coronary artery bypass}} (OPCAB)—essentially establishing controls to compare the incidence of neurocognitive decline in CABG with and {{without the use of}} CPB.

[...] <b>A</b> <b>larger</b> <b>study</b> (281 patients total) by Van Dijk et al. showed CABG surgery without cardiopulmonary bypass improved cognitive outcomes 3 months after the procedure, but the effects were limited and became negligible at 12 months. [...] Furthermore, the Van Dijk study showed no difference between the on-pump and off-pump groups in quality of life, stroke rate, or all-cause mortality at 3 and 12 months. [...] A study by Jenson et al. published in Circulation found {{no significant difference in the}} incidence of cognitive dysfunction 3 months after either OPCAB or conventional on-pump CABG.|$|E
