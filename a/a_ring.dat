If R is <b>a</b> divided <b>ring,</b> then R[x, δ] is also <b>a</b> divided <b>ring.</b> 3.

5|$|Penis pumps induce erections {{without the}} need for drugs or {{invasive}} treatments. To use a pump, the man inserts his penis into a cylinder, then pumps it to create a vacuum which draws blood into the penis, making it erect. He then slides <b>a</b> <b>ring</b> from the outside of the cylinder onto the base of the penis to hold the blood in and maintain the erection. A man who is able to get an erection but has trouble maintaining it for long enough can use <b>a</b> <b>ring</b> by itself.

5|$|The first {{mention of}} rings around Neptune {{dates back to}} 1846 when William Lassell, the {{discoverer}} of Neptune's largest moon, Triton, thought he had seen <b>a</b> <b>ring</b> around the planet. However, his claim was never confirmed {{and it is likely}} that it was an observational artifact. The first reliable detection of <b>a</b> <b>ring</b> was made in 1968 by stellar occultation, although that result would go unnoticed until 1977 when the rings of Uranus were discovered. Soon after the Uranus discovery, a team from Villanova University led by Harold J. Reitsema began searching for rings around Neptune. On 24 May 1981, they detected a dip in a star's brightness during one occultation; however, {{the manner in which the}} star dimmed did not suggest <b>a</b> <b>ring.</b> Later, after the Voyager fly-by, it was found that the occultation was due to the small Neptunian moon Larissa, a highly unusual event.|$|E
5000|$|In general, <b>a</b> Noetherian <b>ring</b> {{is called}} <b>a</b> Cohen-Macaulay <b>ring</b> if the localizations at all maximal ideals are Cohen-Macaulay.

Tricholoma lookalikes in the same geographic region grow at lower elevations, typically in autumn. T.portentosum has a gray cap, a stipe with yellow tints, and lacks <b>a</b> <b>ring,</b> while T.mutabile has violet tones in its cap and also lacks <b>a</b> <b>ring.</b> Other lookalikes include Hygrophorus subalpinus and H.camarophyllus, but these species have broad, waxy gills, and lack the characteristic odor of T.vernaticum.|$|E

50|$|As a consequence, any finitely-generated module over <b>an</b> Artinian <b>ring</b> is Artinian.
