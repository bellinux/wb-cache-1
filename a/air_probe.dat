5000|$|Firstly, {{reference}} bushes {{are attached}} to the front and back surfaces of the component at the measurement location, to minimise [...] "bell-mouthing" [...] and assist with aligning the data sets during analysis. A reference hole is then drilled through a component; in engineering metals, a gun-drill is typically used due to the smooth and straight hole profile they produce. After drilling, the diameter of the reference hole is measured at frequent intervals along the full length and circumference of the measurement and reference bushes with an <b>air</b> <b>probe.</b> This is a thin rod with pressurised air forced from the end via two small holes at a normal to the reference hole axis. As the <b>air</b> <b>probe</b> is moved through the hole, changes in hole diameter will result in changes in pressure, which are detected with a calibrated transducer to convert the pressure change into a voltage. A cylinder (i.e. a core) of material containing the reference hole along its axis is then cut (trepanned) from the component using electro-discharge machining (EDM), in order to relax the stresses acting on the reference hole. Finally, the diameter of the reference hole is re-measured through the entire thickness of the cylinder and reference bushes, with the diameter measurements taken at the same locations as those measured prior to the trepanning.|$|E

However, the detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS), is not straightforward. Sample heterogeneity, delayed analysis and sample preparation, reduces specificity and sensitivity due to probe activation by light, <b>air,</b> <b>probe</b> leakage from cells or cellular activation by sample manipulation. Hence, samples should be processed minimally and analysed immediately if possible. Since clinical research can be subject to uncontrollable timetables and only few departments have access to a dedicated laboratory, the quantification of ROS is challenging.|$|E

These criteria address the capability of the sampling probe to extract a sample that is representative of the effluent stream. The tests conducted by PNNL during July 2010 on the HFEF system are described in this report. The sampling probe location is approximately 20 feet {{from the base of the}} stack. The stack base is in the second floor of the HFEF, and has a building ventilation stream (limited potential radioactive effluent) as well as a process stream (potential radioactive effluent, but HEPA-filtered) that feeds into it. The tests conducted on the duct indicate that the process stream is insufficiently mixed with the building ventilation stream. As a result, the <b>air</b> sampling <b>probe</b> location does not meet the criteria of the N 13. 1 - 1999 standard. The series of tests consists of various measurements taken over a grid of points in the duct cross section at the proposed sampling-probe location. The results of the test series on the HFEF exhaust duct as it relates to the criteria from ANSI/HPS N 13. 1 - 1999 are desribed in this report. Based on these tests, the location of the <b>air</b> sampling <b>probe</b> does not meet the requirements of the ANSI/HPS N 13. 1 - 1999 standard, and modifications must be made to either the HVAC system or the <b>air</b> sampling <b>probe</b> for compliance.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the measurement of self-aerated flow on the spillway of a large dam. The major part of the project involved the development of an <b>air</b> concentration <b>probe</b> and a velocity meter suitable for use under field conditions. The <b>air</b> concentration <b>probe</b> basically measures the electrical conductivity of a small filament of the flowing air-water mixture. The velocity meter measures the stagnation pressure at a point in the flow and relates this to the velocity and air concentration. Results subsequently obtained with the instruments on the spillway of the Aviemore Dam are presented. During testing, it was noted that the “critical point”, where aeration commenced, moved downstream with increasing flow discharge. Furthermore, it was found that its position could be predicted by means of a formula derived from a previous experimental study of model overflow spillways. An analysis of model data, obtained in a previous model study, was carried out and found to correlate well with the prototype data obtained on the Aviemore spillway. A design method for partially - aerated developing flows is presented. It was found that the governing criterion in spillway design is the extent of wall-induced aeration. Further development of the instruments to enable measurements to be made near the spillway side wall is discussed...|$|R
