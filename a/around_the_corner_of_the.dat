2500|$|It {{appears to}} connect with the more southerly {{oriented}} right-lateral Rattlesnake Mountain Fault Zone (RMFZ) straddling Rattlesnake Mountain (near North Bend), which shows a similar deep-seated contact between different kinds of basement rock. At the southern end of Rattlesnake Mountain ndash& exactly where the first lineament of the OWL is encountered ndash& at least one strand of the RMFZ (the others are hidden) turns to run by Cedar Falls and up the Cedar River. [...] Other faults to the south also show a similar turn, suggesting a general turning or bending across the OWL, yet such a bend is not apparent in the pattern of physiographic features that express the OWL. [...] With awareness that the Seattle Fault and the RMFZ are the edges of a large sheet of material which is moving north, there is a distinct impression that these faults, and even some of the topographical features, are flowing <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Snoqualmie Valley. If it seems odd that a mountain should [...] "float" [...] around a valley: bear in mind that while the surface relief is about three-quarters of a kilometer (half a mile) in height, the material flowing could be as much as eighteen kilometers deep. [...] (The analogy of icebergs moving around a submerged sandbar is quite apt.) [...] It is worth noting that [...] ndash& a minor prominence just east of Cedar Falls ndash& is the southwestern-most exposure in the region of some very old Cretaceaous (pre-Cenozoic) metamorphic rock. It seems quite plausible that there is some well-founded and obdurate obstruction at depth, around which the shallower and younger sedimentary formations are flowing. [...] In such a context the observed arcuate fault bends would be very natural.|$|E
