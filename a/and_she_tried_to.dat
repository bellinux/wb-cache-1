5|$|Actor Ryo Ishibashi {{wanted to}} work with Miike and agreed to the role. He commented that despite not being a great fan of horror films, he enjoyed scripts, such as that of Audition, that showcased human nature. Model Eihi Shiina was cast in the film as Asami. Shiina's career was {{primarily}} as a model and she only began acting after being offered a film role while she was on holidays. Shiina first learned about Miike through his film Blues Harp, which made her interested in meeting the director. When Shiina first met Miike, they began talking about her opinions on love and relationships. On their second meeting, Miike asked Shiina to play the part of Asami. Shiina thought that the opinions and feelings she expressed to Miike were the reason she was cast in the role, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> play the role as naturally as she could without going over the top.|$|E
25|$|Sonia Brownell then {{commissioned}} Bernard Crick, {{a professor}} of politics at the University of London, to complete a biography and asked Orwell's friends to co-operate. Crick collated {{a considerable amount of}} material in his work, which was published in 1980, but his questioning of the factual accuracy of Orwell's first-person writings led to conflict with Brownell, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> suppress the book. Crick concentrated on the facts of Orwell's life rather than his character, and presented primarily a political perspective on Orwell's life and work.|$|E
25|$|Still {{wearing her}} {{fluorescent}} jacket, she knelt down at least 15 meters {{in front of}} the bulldozer, and began waving her arms and shouting, just as activists had successfully done dozens of times that day.... When it got so close that it was moving the earth beneath her, she climbed onto the pile of rubble being pushed by the bulldozer.... Her head and upper torso were above the bulldozer's blade, and the bulldozer operator and co-operator could clearly see her. Despite this, the operator continued forward, which caused her to fall back, out of view of the driver. He continued forward, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> scoot back, but was quickly pulled underneath the bulldozer. We ran towards him, and waved our arms and shouted; one activist with the megaphone. But the bulldozer operator continued forward, until Corrie was all the way underneath the central section of the bulldozer.|$|E

500|$|Rigbey {{also wanted}} to make sure that {{everyone}} liked the character, and eventually nineteen year old, agricultural student Ruth Pritchard was created. Actress (later presenter) Felicity Finch was cast as Ruth. Finch had not listened to The Archers prior to her audition in 1987 <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> learn as much as she could about the history of the show before she came to the studio. Smethurst thought the decision to cast a Geordie was [...] "odd" [...] and wrote that it harked back to the days when the show would cast lots of Scottish and Irish actors, irritating the audience. Finch's first scenes as Ruth were broadcast on 15 July 1987.|$|E
500|$|In his written {{confession}} {{released by}} Peruvian police, Van der Sloot recounted that he briefly left {{the hotel to}} get some coffee and bread, and returned to find Flores using his laptop computer without his permission. A police source stated {{that she may have}} found information linking him to the disappearance of Holloway. An altercation allegedly began, and she attempted to escape. According to the aforementioned written confession released by Peruvian authorities, Van der Sloot stated, [...] "I did not want to do it. The girl intruded into my private life [...] [...] [...] she didn't have any right. I went to her and I hit her. She was scared, we argued <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> escape. I grabbed her by the neck and hit her." [...] Van der Sloot reportedly stated that he was stoned on marijuana at the time. A detective linked to the case said that Van der Sloot considered getting rid of the body in a suitcase, but decided against it because he would have been stopped at the front desk. He then reportedly drank espresso and took amphetamines to counter fatigue before fleeing.|$|E
500|$|The poor sales caused {{financial}} problems {{and may have}} caused a suicide, for on August 22, Charles A. Watts, secretary of the Centennial Corporation and described by Campbell as the real force behind the coin, killed himself. The day before he died, he told {{a meeting of the}} corporation that there were funds enough to pay all debts, and that Fraser was not owed any money. Neither proved to be the case, and unpaid bills totaled $6,000, with no money to pay them. In fact, Fraser's fee of $1,200 was outstanding, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> get paid even with the half dollars, but her bill was unsatisfied until a year later, when she was paid by check. The half dollars were not owned by the corporation, as the Vancouver National Bank had advanced money for them. Sales came to a virtual halt by the end of October. Texas coin dealer B. Max Mehl offered to buy the remainder of the issue at face value, but this was rejected as many people had paid $1 for their coins. A total of 35,034 pieces were sent back to the mint for redemption and melting, leaving 14,966 pieces outstanding. According to Swiatek and Breen, [...] "given the remoteness and exclusively local nature of the celebration, it is surprising that as many as fourteen thousand coins were sold." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2000, Dot was {{featured}} in a storyline about euthanasia, when her oldest friend Ethel, who had terminal cancer, asked her to help her die. The storyline allowed the production team to present {{all sides of the}} debate about euthanasia, {{from the perspective of the}} sufferer and from the person who is asked to assist in the mercy killing, religious and moral opposition. According to author Dorothy Hobson, [...] "Dot suffered torment as she struggled with her conscience <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> resist the request [...] to assist [...] in the ultimate sin". In the storyline, Ethel enjoyed the last days of her life and chose her final evening. Assisted by Dot, she took an overdose of her medication and died. Written by Simon Ashton and directed by Francesca Joseph the episode ended with a scene in which Ethel tells a weeping Dot [...] "you're the best friend I ever had". Alternative credit music replaced the typical drum beats and theme tune at the end of the episode. The 1931 song used instead of the usual theme was [...] "Guilty" [...] by Al Bowlly. Ben Summerskill from The Observer has suggested that Dot's part in the euthanasia storyline was [...] "one of the most moving dramatic sequences shown in recent years on British TV". The episode was voted the most emotional soap death in a Radio Times poll of 4,000 readers in 2006.|$|E
2500|$|As the 13th Submarine Flotilla {{passed the}} island, {{a pair of}} lights (possibly {{minesweeping}} naval trawlers) were seen approaching the line of submarines. The flotilla altered course sharply to port to avoid them but K14s helm jammed and she veered out of line. [...] Both K14 and the boat behind her, K12 turned on their navigation lights and eventually K14s helm was freed <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> return to her position in the line. The next submarine in line, K22 had {{lost sight of the}} rest of the flotilla in the mist and veered off the line with the result that she hit K14. Both submarines stopped whilst the rest of the flotilla, unaware of what had happened continued out to sea. K22 radioed in code to the cruiser leading the flotilla to say that she could reach port but that K14 was crippled and sinking.|$|E
2500|$|Many of {{her other}} {{photographs}} containing her nude or hurt children caused controversy. For example, in [...] "The Perfect Tomato," [...] the viewer sees a nude Jessie, posing on a picnic table outside, bathed in light. Jessie told Steven Cantor during the filming {{of one of his}} movies that she had just been playing around and her mother told her to freeze, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> capture the image in a rush because the sun was setting. This explains why everything is blurred except for the tomato, hence the photograph's title. This image was likely criticized for Jessie’s nudity and presentation of the adolescent female form. While Jessie was aware of this photograph, Dana Cox, in her essay, said that the Mann children were probably unaware of the other photographs being taken as Mann’s children were often naked because “it came natural to them.” This habit of nudity is a family thing because Mann says she used to walk around her house naked when she was growing up. Cox states that “the own artist’s childhood is reflected in the way she captures moments in her children’s lives.” One image that deals more with another aspect of childhood besides [...] "naked play", Jessie's Cut, shows Jessie's head, wrapped in what appears to be plastic, with blood running down the side of her face from the cut above her left eye. The cut is stitched and the blood is dry and stains her skin. As painful as the image looks, there are a great number of viewers who could relate to Jessie when they think about the broken bones and stitched up cuts they had during childhood.|$|E
