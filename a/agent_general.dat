Connolly became a minister without portfolio in the new Wilson government in 1916, but resigned in June 1917 when appointed to the role of <b>Agent</b> <b>General</b> for Western Australia. Robert Pilkington of the Nationalist Party won the subsequent by-election on 21 July 1917 and election two months later, before leaving for England in 1921.

He was raised on the Mitcham {{property}} in South Australia, was intellectual and bookish, and wished to go the prestigious St Peter's College to study law. He was rebuked by his father and subsequently became a farmer like his predecessors, buying property at Norton Summit and growing vegetables, plums and apples. He {{was elected to the}} local East Torrens Council in 1863 at the age of 27; and then to the State Parliament in 1868 as a 'liberal' (parties had not yet formed), representing the constituency of Onkaparinga. He became known as 'Honest Tom' for his straightforward and blunt ways. He lost his seat in 1871 and regained it in 1875 only to lose it again until he was re-elected in 1887, upon which he became Premier of South Australia. He subsequently lost the premiership in 1889, regained it in 1890, and then {{spent a great deal of}} his term absent in India. After losing an election, he relocated to London to represent South Australia as <b>Agent</b> <b>General</b> to the United Kingdom. While in England, Playford was thrice offered a knighthood, but declined it each time.|$|E

In 1907, the <b>General</b> <b>Agent's</b> office was abolished, and its functions were distributed among three new offices: the Division of Accounts (which evolved into the Justice Management Division); the Office of the Chief Examiner (which later evolved by 1908, into the Bureau of Investigation, and later by the early 1920s into the Federal Bureau of Investigation); and the Office of the Superintendent of Prisons and Prisoners, later called the Superintendent of Prisons (which then evolved by 1930 into the Bureau of Prisons).|$|R

The agent, after buying {{a certain amount of}} products, win the authorization from {{the pharmacy}} company to sell in a specific region and becomes its sole authorized agent in the region. The regional <b>general</b> <b>agent</b> can be the general wholesaler in a big region, provincial wholesaler, district wholesaler or municipal wholesaler, etc. In a big region or in a province, regional <b>general</b> <b>agents</b> provide patients with their products through sub-wholesalers and retailers. In a small place such as a county, products can go directly from the regional <b>general</b> <b>agent</b> to retailers and then to patients, without the involvement of sub wholesalers.|$|R

500|$|In 1927, Greenfield was {{appointed}} Alberta's <b>Agent</b> <b>General</b> in London, England. [...] The appointment was controversial and {{was perceived as}} a patronage reward even by some UFA backbenchers. [...] Liberals also accused the government of benefiting the Hudson's Bay Company, which owned the London office that the government leased, more than Alberta. [...] Even so, Greenfield's performance in the position was well regarded: his personality was better-suited for his duties there, which included the promotion of Alberta's burgeoning oil and gas industry, attracting English immigration to Alberta, and acting {{as a guide for}} Albertans visiting London. [...] It was in this last capacity that he welcomed Brownlee to London, where the two met together with British immigration and financial officials.|$|E

Lands Department accountants calculated that {{the sale of the}} lots would return £8,768/3/3 after expenses, and the estate was gazetted and land made available on 21 December 1910. Of the nine substantial lots only four were taken up as settlers were unable to pay the £6 per acre price. Lot 1 was taken up by George Hancock, the father of mining magnate Lang Hancock, and George's brother Richard took up Lot 2. Lot 13 was taken up by G.W. Isbister, and Lot 4 was taken up by former Premier Sir Newton Moore, who then proceeded to London with the plans. As <b>Agent</b> <b>General</b> Newton was to offer to prospective settlers lots at Avondale, although a number telegram inquiries to ascertain availability of lots at Avondale were sent, there is no record any lots being allocated in London.|$|E

At the {{conclusion}} of the 2010 season, Rod Barajas, Hiroki Kuroda, Vicente Padilla, Jay Gibbons, Reed Johnson and Jeff Weaver all became free agents. Scott Podsednik also became a free agent, after declining his part of a mutual option, on November 4. On December 2, the Dodgers chose not to tender a contract to former All-Star, Catcher Russell Martin, making him a free <b>agent.</b> <b>General</b> Manager Ned Colletti described this decision as, [...] "one of the toughest decisions I've had to make, maybe ever." [...] Due to Martin's decreased production the past two seasons and his uncertain recovery from season ending surgery in 2010, the Dodgers felt he was not worth the salary increase he would have received in arbitration. They also released relief pitcher George Sherrill and outfielder Trent Oeltjen. To clear spots on their 40-man roster, the Dodgers traded infielder Chin-lung Hu to the New York Mets for minor league pitcher Michael Antonini and designated reliever Brent Leach for assignment so that he could sign with the Yokohama BayStars of the Japanese Leagues.|$|E

[...] On 24 July. 1863 he was made a {{justice of the peace}} for the Colony of Vancouver Island. When the sawmill burnt down in 1865, Sproat {{returned}} to England, but maintained his interest in the affairs of the colony, which was united with the mainland in 1866. Sproat's fascination with the First Nations people he encountered on Vancouver Island, led to his best remembered book, The Nootka:Scenes and studies of savage life, which appeared in 1868. In 1870 he wrote Education of the Rural Poor which argued for the extension of elementary education to all, including agricultural laborers. Following British Columbia's entry into Canadian Confederation in 1871, Sproat became the new province's <b>agent</b> <b>general</b> in London, a position he held from 1872 until his return to the province in 1876. Beginning in 1883, Sproat began travelling to the Interior of British Columbia, especially to the Kootenay region, where he held several regional offices. After 1898, Sproat returned to Victoria, where he spent the majority of his time writing. He died there on 4 June 1913. Sproat Lake and Sproat Lake Provincial Park on Vancouver Island are named in his honour by Robert Brown.|$|E
