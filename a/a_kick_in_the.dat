5|$|Cardiff won {{the coin}} toss and elected to kick first. Ben Blair and Julien Dupuy, the goal-kickers {{used during the}} match {{were the first to}} attempt kicks for their {{respective}} sides, were both successful. The teams then nominated other players on their team who had experience at goal-kicking, both teams being successful with their second and third kicks. Cardiff's fourth player Ceri Sweeney, was also an experienced goal-kicker and was successful; however, Leicester selected Johne Murphy, who was not a regular kicker, and he missed to make the score 4–3 after four of the five rounds. This meant if Cardiff were successful with their next kick, they would have an unassailable lead and would win the match. With no more experienced goal kickers to choose from, winger Tom James stepped up to take the kick, but missed, allowing Leicester the chance to draw level. Scott Hamilton scored with his kick to bring the scores to 4–4 after five kicks and take the shoot-out to sudden death. The teams were both successful with their next two kicks, including Craig Newby for Leicester who was the first forward to take <b>a</b> <b>kick</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shoot-out. With all seven backs having already attempted a kick, Cardiff were required to select a forward player for their eighth kick, and chose flanker Martyn Williams. He missed, giving Leicester the chance to win the match if they were successful with their eighth kick. Number 8 Jordan Crane was selected for the attempt and was successful, resulting in Leicester winning the shoot-out 7–6 and advancing to the 2009 Heineken Cup Final.|$|E

25|$|The Colts reached Super Bowl XLI after {{defeating}} the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship game. It was Vinatieri's fifth Super Bowl appearance, {{and his first}} with the Colts. The Colts defeated the Chicago Bears by a score of 29–17.

He missed a 36-yard kick wide left {{at the end of}} the first half—the third time he had missed <b>a</b> <b>kick</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Super Bowl.

Vinatieri finished the 2006–07 postseason with 49 total points and 14 field goals, both NFL records. He is the only player to have 3 or more field goals in 4 consecutive postseason games.|$|E
500|$|The strip {{follows a}} simple concept: in each weekly instalment, Sammy sneezes with such power that it wreaked havoc with his surroundings. [...] His sneeze builds until its release with the onomatopoeia [...] "Chow!" [...] in the second-to-last panel. [...] In the last panel he suffers the consequences—being driven away {{by one of}} his victims, or often {{receiving}} <b>a</b> <b>kick</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rear.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to the imaginative layouts of Little Nemo, Sammy Sneeze was confined to a rigid grid and followed a strict formula: Sammy's sneeze would build frame by frame, contorting the protagonist's face until it erupted in the second-to-last panel. [...] In the closing panel he suffered the consequences—often <b>a</b> <b>kick</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rear. [...] McCay targeted middle-class pretensions such as consumerism and squeamishness over bodily functions, while reaffirming the social order by ensuring that Sammy received punishment.|$|E

500|$|Andula strikes up a flirtation with Milda, the big-city pianist of {{the band}} {{providing}} the music. He reads her palm and instructs her in how to rebuff unwanted advances with <b>a</b> <b>kick</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shins. After the party she goes to bed with Milda, although the comic frustrations continue, with Milda fighting a battle with a window shade that won't close, before he feels secure in making love. Afterward, as they lie in bed together, Andula asks what Milda meant when he said she was [...] "angular". He replies that a woman is shaped like a guitar: [...] "And you, {{you look like a}} guitar too", he tells her, [...] "but one painted by Picasso." [...] Before they part, he offhandedly invites her to come to Prague and pay him a visit sometime.|$|E
500|$|... "She" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "the closest thing to a slow jam on Goblin, where [...] "Tyler genuinely wrestles with lust." [...] The song features Tyler, the Creator pining [...] "for a gorgeous girl" [...] while [...] "crooner Frank Ocean chimes in with a vocal hook". The track is [...] "delivered with sweetly juvenile expressions of desire, except that Tyler peppers the track with a single-word epithet that would earn him <b>a</b> <b>kick</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> groin from any self-respecting woman." [...] HipHopDX's Sean Ryon mused that [...] "even the more subdued songs like [...] "She" [...] with Frank Ocean" [...] embody [...] "Tyler’s middle-fingers-up attitude, as he twists perverted tales of stalking girls and “stabbing Bruno Mars in his goddamn esophagus” into anathematic odes to unbridled individualism." ...|$|E
500|$|Even after {{achieving}} the record, Hershiser expressed regret: [...] "Because {{of respect for}} Don {{and respect for the}} record, I don't think I should have walked to the mound in a situation where I'm supposed to be resting for the playoffs, just to beat a record. That would have tarnished the whole thing." [...] According to some sources, Drysdale was the person who convinced Hershiser to take the mound for the tenth inning, saying, [...] "I gave him <b>a</b> <b>kick</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pants and told him {{to get out there and}} go as far as he can". However, other sources state that Drysdale merely said that if he had known about Hershiser's hesitance to break the record, he would have reassured him, saying [...] "I'd have kicked him right in the rear if I had known that... I'd have told him to get his buns out there and get them." ...|$|E

500|$|Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique {{gave the}} episode a {{positive}} review and awarded it three stars out of four. Vitaris praised the episode's balance {{of humor and}} horror, noting [...] "Although 'Leonard Betts' is not a comedy, the three writers take such pleasure in the story that you buy the situation. There's a lot of situational (and scary) humor in the script." [...] Furthermore, she noted that the ending revelation that Scully has cancer and the following conversation between Mulder and Scully was [...] "one of the season's best scenes." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. The two wrote positively of the [...] "amiable quality to the story which makes its finale moments all the more of <b>a</b> <b>kick</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> teeth." [...] Shearman and Pearson noted that [...] "Leonard Betts" [...] was the first episode [...] "to come along [...] which feels light and frothy, and it deliberately makes the unkindest cut of all." ...|$|E
500|$|The EP {{has been}} seen by critics simply as [...] "unapologetic {{hardcore}} punk" [...] and being the most aggressive work Gallows had done so far. A more Americanised influence can be heard throughout the EP as it's been likened to bands like Cancer Bats and Every Time I Die. MacNeil had always stated the EP helped build on what he has always liked about Gallows; he considers it being [...] "Four songs like <b>a</b> <b>kick</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> teeth". In {{the writing of the}} new extended play the band focused on less typical song structures and focused on the chaotic sound from live shows. MacNeil believed that [...] "sometimes you don’t need to overcomplicate things. Obviously, we're trying to write music that’s chaotic and is going to be something that comes across vicious-sounding live... you don’t repeat it four times, you do it once, and you don’t have a bridge." [...] Gallows guitarist Laurent Barnard said how the EP would not sound similar to the band's third studio album by saying [...] "If you're going to make a punk rock EP, you might as well make it the most punk rock thing you can really." ...|$|E
500|$|Chelsea manager Mourinho was {{primarily}} concerned with the fitness of his squad {{in the aftermath of}} the match, in particular Ballack, who was substituted with an injury early in the match: [...] "He had <b>a</b> <b>kick</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> muscle and he couldn't run but I hope he will be back soon, we have quite a few players not in condition and we need players back, so I hope it's not a big deal." [...] He felt that the fitness of the two squads was the decisive factor in the match: [...] "Today our bench was not very good, with some kids, Liverpool could inject fresh blood at the same time as some of my players became really tired. They were broken. They were in better condition than us, you could see the difference between Frank Lampard and Sissoko." [...] Mourinho was also unconcerned about his team's form heading into the start of the season: [...] "Liverpool had more intensity and pace, qualities that make a team better. They had that and we didn't. We had a big percentage of the ball possession, but Liverpool defended with intensity and looked dangerous when they counter-attacked. I keep saying they are a difficult team to beat and they can go to every game with an ambition to win. They are a good team but over 10 months of competition we will be there." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{rarity of}} a penalty {{shoot-out}} in rugby meant that no standard format existed and tournament organisers {{were left to}} devise their own rules on the format a shoot-out would take in the event it was required, such as the positions the kicks would be taken from, the type of kick used and the number and order of players who would participate. In {{the case of the}} Heineken Cup, the rules set by organisers European Rugby Cup (ERC) prescribed a format closely resembling that used in soccer matches. Each team would alternately take five place kicks, each from the same position on the 22-metre line, {{directly in front of the}} posts. Each kick had to be taken by a different player from the 15 players that were present on the pitch at the end of extra time. In the event the scores were level after the five kicks, [...] "sudden death" [...] would take place, with each team alternately taking a kick until a round occurred where one team was successful with their kick and the other team missed. Again, each kick was required to be taken by a different player, starting with players that had yet to take <b>a</b> <b>kick</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first part of the shoot-out. If no winner had been decided after all 15 players had attempted a kick, the process would continue with each player eligible to take a kick again until all 15 players had made another attempt.|$|E
500|$|Born in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, Bridges {{began his}} career with local side Cambridge United, whom he joined {{at the age of}} 8, he progressed through the club's youth system before signing his first {{professional}} contract in February 2002. He broke into the first-team {{towards the end of the}} 2001–02 season, making his debut as a substitute in a 1–0 defeat against Huddersfield Town at the Abbey Stadium. He played six further games in the same season, scoring his first goal for Cambridge in a 2–1 home win against Tranmere Rovers. Bridges featured regularly in the opening half of the 2002–03 season, playing a total of 25 times and scoring once in a 3–0 victory against York City. However, a [...] "persistent" [...] ankle injury cut his run in the first-team short, and he did not feature from February onwards. He returned to first-team action in a 1–0 defeat to Wycombe Wanderers in October 2003, and played a further 22 times for the club throughout the 2003–04 campaign. However, Bridges left Cambridge at the end of the season after failing to agree a contract extension. On leaving Cambridge, Bridges said [...] "I was offered a contract that was almost <b>a</b> <b>kick</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> teeth after the time I had been at the club when players were coming in from all over the place who did not care about the club. They were getting paid five or six times what I was offered, and I thought it was probably time to move on". During his three seasons with the club, Bridges made a total of 55 appearances in all competitions,scoring four times.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> free <b>kick</b> is {{also used}} to restart the game {{following}} a safety.
