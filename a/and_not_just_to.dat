25|$|Functional {{theories}} of language propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, {{it is reasonable}} to assume that its structures are best analysed and understood with reference to the functions they carry out. Functional {{theories of}} grammar differ from formal theories of grammar, in that the latter seek to define the different elements of language and describe the way they relate to each other as systems of formal rules or operations, whereas the former defines the functions performed by language and then relates these functions to the linguistic elements that carry them out. This means that functional theories of grammar tend to pay attention to the way language is actually used, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> the formal relations between linguistic elements.|$|E
500|$|Shortly after Saucedo's ruling, Edwards left {{to recruit}} more {{settlers}} from the United States, leaving {{his younger brother}} Benjamin {{in charge of the}} colony. [...] Benjamin could not maintain stability in the colony, and the situation deteriorated rapidly. [...] A vigilante group of earlier settlers harassed many newcomers, and [...] Benjamin Edwards made several complaints to state authorities. [...] Unhappy with Benjamin's tone and the increasing tension, Mexican authorities revoked the land grant in October and instructed the Edwards brothers to leave Mexico. [...] Rumors that Haden Edwards had returned to the United States to raise an army <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> recruit settlers likely influenced the government action. [...] Unwilling to abandon his $50,000 (about $ as of [...] ) investment in the colony, Haden Edwards rejoined his brother in Nacogodoches in late October, continuing their business affairs despite the cancellation of his colonization contract.|$|E

500|$|Frank Rich {{referenced}} truthiness {{again in}} The New York Times in 2008, describing {{the strategy of}} John McCain's presidential campaign as being [...] "to envelop the entire presidential race in a thick fog of truthiness", Rich explained that the campaign was based on truthiness because [...] "McCain, Sarah Palin and their surrogates keep repeating the same lies over and over not just to smear their opponents <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> mask their own record. Their larger aim is to construct a bogus alternative reality so relentless it can overwhelm any haphazard journalistic stabs at puncturing it." [...] Rich also noted, [...] "You know the press is impotent at unmasking this truthiness when the hardest-hitting interrogation McCain has yet faced on television came on [...] 'The View'. Barbara Walters and Joy Behar called him on several falsehoods, including his endlessly repeated fantasy that Palin opposed earmarks for Alaska. Behar used the word 'lies' to his face." ...|$|E
500|$|Faust's initial writing {{staff at}} Hasbro Studios {{included}} several writers {{who had worked}} with her on her previous shows and were approved by Hasbro. These included Amy Keating Rogers, Cindy Morrow, Meghan McCarthy, Chris Savino, Charlotte Fullerton, M.A. Larson, and Dave Polsky. The writing process began with Faust and Renzetti coming up with broad plots for each show. The two would then hold a brainstorming session with each episode's writer, allowing the writer to script out scenes and dialogue. Faust and Renzetti then worked with the writer to finalize the scripts and assign some basic storyboard instructions. Hasbro was involved throughout this process and laid down some of the concepts to be incorporated into the show. Examples of Hasbro's influence include having Celestia be a princess rather than a queen, making one of the ponies focused on fashion, and portraying toy sets in relevant places within the story, such as Rarity's boutique. In some cases, Hasbro requested that the show include a setting, but allowed Faust and her team to create its visual style, and Hasbro then based the toy set on it; an example is the Ponyville schoolhouse. Faust also had to write to the E/I ("educational and informational") standards that Hasbro required of the show, making the crafting of some of the situations she would have normally done on other animated shows more difficult; for example, Faust cited having one character call another an [...] "egghead" [...] as [...] "treading a very delicate line", and having one character cheat in a competition as [...] "worrisome to some". Each episode also generally includes a moral or life lesson, but these were chosen to [...] "cross a broad spectrum of personal experiences", <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> suit children. Because intellectual property issues had caused Hasbro to lose some of the rights on the original pony names, the show includes a mix of original characters from the toy line and new characters developed for the show.|$|E

2500|$|At Casement's highly publicised {{trial for}} treason, the {{prosecution}} had trouble arguing its case. Casement's crimes had been carried out in Germany and the Treason Act 1351 seemed to apply only to activities carried out on English (or arguably British) soil. A close reading of the Act allowed for a broader interpretation: the court decided that a comma should be read in the unpunctuated original Norman-French text, crucially altering the sense so that [...] "in the realm or elsewhere" [...] referred to where acts were done <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> where the [...] "King's enemies" [...] might be. Afterwards, Casement himself wrote {{that he was to}} be [...] "hanged on a comma", leading to the well-used epigram.|$|E

In fact, he would use the term España in a depreciative way, {{an example of the}} [...] "past" [...] and what [...] "should be avoided". It was his ideal that a federation of [...] "Iberian Nations" [...] should emerge to create this new Hespaña. For Rodríguez Castelao these nations were: Castile, Catalonia, the Basque Country, Portugal and Galicia. He also implied that apart from creating the political conditions for it, cultural conditions (education) should also be provided.|$|E

2500|$|The NRA {{has filed}} five related {{lawsuits}} since the Heller decision.

Three Illinois lawsuits have been negotiated and settled out of court involving agreements that repeal gun ban ordinances and did not result in incorporation of the Second Amendment to state and local jurisdictions. [...] The fourth NRA lawsuit against Chicago was rejected. [...] The NRA appealed the case to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals. On June 2, 2009, the Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's decision, based on the theory that Heller applied only to the Federal Government (including the District of Columbia), and not to states or their subordinate jurisdictions. This opinion directly conflicts with the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals's earlier decision, holding that Heller applies to states as well.|$|E

2500|$|The Court further {{clarified}} {{that the}} United States government intended to broadly recognize {{the claims of}} property owners to property they were granted or otherwise had a presumed right based on the actions of Spain or France prior to the Louisiana Purchase, without requiring that the property owner also have taken all the necessary steps to legally complete the grant. The Court noted {{that at the time}} of the Purchase, there were very few [...] "complete grants", that [...] "nineteen-twentieths" [...] of the grants were incomplete and that [...] "ost of the inhabitants were too poor to defray the expenses attending the completion of their titles, but they had faith in their government" [...] that the title would be recognized. In making this ruling on the property issue, the Court cited its previous opinions in Strother v. Lucas, 31 U.S. 763 (1832), Soulard v. United States, 29 U.S. 511 (1830), and Landes v. Brant, 51 U.S. 348 (1850) in support.
