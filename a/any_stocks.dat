500|$|In {{the early}} 1600s, England was {{at peace with}} France and Spain {{and as a result}} the coastal defences {{received}} little attention; a survey found Southsea Castle to be [...] "verie ill prepared for defence", with no guns mounted along the walls or <b>any</b> <b>stocks</b> of powder. In March 1626, a serious fire broke out that destroyed the interior of the keep and generated panic among the ships moored nearby. The damage was not repaired until 1635, when 210 loads of timber was sent from the New Forest for use in the work. Another serious fire then broke out in 1640, causing damage to the lodgings and store rooms.|$|E
500|$|Borah was not {{personally}} harmed by {{the stock market}} crash of October 1929, having sold <b>any</b> <b>stocks</b> and invested in government bonds. [...] Thousands of Americans had borrowed on margin, and were ruined by the crash. [...] Congress in June 1930 passed the Hawley–Smoot Tariff, [...] sharply increasing rates on imports. [...] Borah was one of 12 Republicans who joined Democrats in opposing the bill, which passed the Senate 44–42. Borah was up for election in 1930, and despite a minimal campaign effort, took over 70percent of the vote in a bad year for Republicans. When he returned to Washington for the lame-duck session of the Senate beginning in December, Borah pressed the passage of legislation that would help business and suggested that members of Congress turn back their salary to the Treasury. The economy continued to worsen in the winter of 1931, and Borah urged relief legislation, stating that opponents argued [...] "that for the Government to feed this woman and her sick children would destroy her self respect and make a bad citizen of her. [...] Does anyone believe it? It is a cowardly imputation on the helpless. [...] I resent it and I repudiate it." ...|$|E

5000|$|The Nigerian Army {{fought the}} civil war {{significantly}} under-resourced; Obasanjo's memoirs chronicle the lack of <b>any</b> <b>stocks</b> of extra equipment for mobilisation, and the [...] "haphazard and unreliable system of procurement and provisioning" [...] which lasted for the entire period of the war. [...] Arms embargoes imposed by several Western countries made the situation more difficult.|$|E
50|$|A State can, however, {{choose not}} to impose any restrictions. But once it does, traders have to {{immediately}} sell into the market <b>any</b> <b>stocks</b> held beyond the mandated quantity. This improves supplies and brings down prices.

The excess stocks are auctioned or sold through fair price shops.|$|E

The Left Alliance did not directly own <b>any</b> <b>stocks.</b> Nowadays, Yrjö Sirola Foundation has majority of the stocks.|$|E

Thus if a roll is Oil, Dividend, 10, and you own a thousand shares of Oil at $1.25 apiece you will receive a dividend of $100. Note that the dividend is not affected by {{the value of the}} share, with only the rule being that stocks worth less than $1.00 do not pay out when a dividend is rolled for them.|$|E
