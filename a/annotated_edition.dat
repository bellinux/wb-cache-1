5|$|Black Elk (Lakota) was a {{medicine}} man and heyokha, whose life spanned {{the transition to}} reservations. His accounts of the 19th-century Indian Wars and Ghost Dance movement, and his deep thoughts on personal visions and Native American religion, {{form the basis of}} the book Black Elk Speaks, first published in 1932. (Among several editions, a premier <b>annotated</b> <b>edition</b> was published in 2008.) Paul Goble, an award-winning children's book author and illustrator, has been based in the Black Hills since 1977.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{returned}} to Lichfield in February 1734, where he began an <b>annotated</b> <b>edition</b> of Poliziano's Latin poems, {{along with a}} history of Latin poetry from Petrarch to Poliziano. The work was designed to fill 480 pages and provide a detailed commentary and corresponding notes. By completing such a work as this, Johnson hoped to become known as a scholar-poet similar to Julius Caesar Scaliger, Daniel and Nikolaes Heinsius, Desiderius Erasmus, and Poliziano, all of whom Johnson admired. Johnson began on 15 June 1743 and printed a Proposal for the work on 5 August 1734. However, the project did not receive enough funds and it was soon brought to an end. Although the project failed, it shows that Johnson identified himself with neo-Latin humanism.|$|E
5|$|The main {{character}} of The Sandman is Dream, {{also known as}} Morpheus and other names, {{who is one of}} the seven Endless. The other Endless are Destiny, Death, Desire, Despair, Delirium (formerly Delight) and Destruction. The series is famous for Gaiman's trademark use of anthropomorphic personification of various metaphysical entities, while also blending mythology and history in its horror setting within the DC Universe. The Sandman is a story about stories and how Morpheus, the Lord of Dreams, is captured and subsequently learns that sometimes change is inevitable. The Sandman was Vertigo's flagship title, and is available as a series of ten trade paperbacks, a recolored five-volume Absolute hardcover edition with slipcase, in a black-and-white <b>Annotated</b> <b>edition,</b> and is available for digital download.|$|E

25|$|An <b>annotated</b> <b>edition</b> of Mein Kampf was {{published}} in Germany in January 2016 and sold out within hours on Amazon's German site. The book's publication led to public debate in Germany, and divided reactions from Jewish groups, with some supporting, and others opposing, the decision to publish. German officials had previously said they would limit public access to the text amid fears that its republication could stir neo-Nazi sentiment. Some bookstores stated {{that they would not}} stock the book. Dussmann, a Berlin bookstore, stated that one copy was available on the shelves in the history section, but {{that it would not be}} advertised and more copies would be available only on order.

25|$|În preajma revoluției first {{appeared}} in eight volumes between 1932 and 1936, when it met with popular and critical success, although this was {{largely due to the}} fact that its author was cloaked in legend. The Communist regime banned the work for its duration, considering it unpublishable, even after Ceaușescu steered a course away from Soviet tutelage. The book was published between 1990 and 1991 at Chișinău, while Stere's biographer Zigu Ornea put out another edition in 1991-1993. Both editions of the somewhat problematic 2331-page text were flawed, and in 2010, the Iași-based literary historian Victor Durnea began publishing a critical, <b>annotated</b> <b>edition</b> of Stere's works, starting with the novel. The manuscripts no longer exist, Stere's archive in his country house at Bucov having mysteriously disappeared after World War II, so that Durnea's interventions were limited to introducing uniformity into the available text, eliminating arbitrary decisions both by Stere and his editors, and replacing obsolete terms and punctuation that resulted from the author's culturally Russian outlook.|$|E
