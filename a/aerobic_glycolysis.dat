50|$|Glycolysis, {{which means}} “sugar splitting,” is the initial {{process in the}} {{cellular}} respiration pathway. Glycolysis can be either an aerobic or anaerobic process. When oxygen is present then glycolysis will continue along the aerobic respiration pathway. If oxygen is not present, then ATP production will be restricted to anaerobic respiration. The location where <b>glycolysis,</b> <b>aerobic</b> or anaerobic, occurs is in the cytosol of the cell. In glycolysis, a six-carbon glucose molecule is split into two three-carbon molecules called pyruvate. These carbon molecules are oxidized into NADH and ATP. In order for the glucose molecule to be oxidized into pyruvate, an input of ATP molecules is required. This {{is known as the}} investment phase, in which a total of two ATP molecules are consumed. At the end of glycolysis, the total yield of ATP is four molecules, but the net gain is two ATP molecules. Even though ATP is synthesized, the two ATP molecules produced are few compared to the second and third pathways, Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation.|$|R
