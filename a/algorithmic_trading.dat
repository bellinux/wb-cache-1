Front office work favours a higher speed to quality ratio, with a greater emphasis on solutions to specific problems than detailed modeling.

40|$|Content-based publish/subscribe (CPS) is an {{appealing}} abstraction for building scalable distributed systems, e. g., message boards, intrusion detectors, or <b>algorithmic</b> stock <b>trading</b> platforms. More recently, {{extensions of the}} abstraction have been proposed for location-based services like vehicular networks, mobile social networking, etc. Although current CPS middleware systems are dynamic {{in the way they}} support the joining and leaving of publishers and subscribers, they fall short in supporting subscription adaptations. These are becoming increasingly important across many CPS applications. In <b>algorithmic</b> high frequency <b>trading,</b> for instance, stock price thresholds that are of interest to a trader change rapidly, and gains directly hinge on the reaction time to relevant fluctuations rather than fixed values. In location-aware applications, a subscription {{is a function of the}} subscriber location (e. g. GPS coordinates) which inherently changes during motion. The common solution to adapt a subscription consists in a re-subscription, where a new subscription is issued and the superseded one canceled. This incurs substantial overhead in CPS middleware systems, and leads to missed or duplicate events during the transition. In this paper, we explore the concept of parametric subscriptions for capturing subscription adaptations. W...|$|R

Complex event processing can be instrumental for many mission-critical applica-tions, such as business intelligence, <b>algorithmic</b> stock <b>trading,</b> and intrusion detection. Hence, the servers that carry out complex event processing must be made trustworthy.

40|$|In recent years, <b>algorithmic</b> and {{high-frequency}} <b>trading</b> {{have been}} the subject of increasing risk concerns. A general theme that we adopt in this thesis is that trading practitioners are predominantly interested in risk-adjusted performance. Likewise, regulators are demanding stricter risk controls. First, we scrutinise conventional AI model design approaches with the aim to increase the risk-adjusted trading performance of the proposed fuzzy logic models. We show that applying risk-return objective functions and accounting for transaction costs improve out-of-sample results. Our experiments identify that neuro-fuzzy models exhibit superior performance stability across multiple risk regimes when compared to popular neural network models identified in AI literature. Moreover, we propose an innovative ensemble model approach which combines multiple risk-adjusted objective functions and dynamically adapts risk- tolerance according to time-varying risk. Next, we extend our findings to the money management aspects of trading algorithms. We introduce an effective fuzzy logic approach which dynamically discriminates across different regions in the trend and volatility space. The model prioritises higher performing regions at an intraday level and adapts capital allocation policies with the objective to maximise global risk-adjusted performance. Finally, we explore trading improvements that can be attained by advancing our type- 1 fuzzy logic ideas to higher order fuzzy systems in view of the increased noise (uncertainty) that is inherent in high-frequency data. We propose an innovative approach to design type- 2 models with minimal increase in design and computational complexity. As a further step, we identify a relationship between the increased trading performance benefits of the proposed type- 2 model and higher levels of trading frequencies. In conclusion, this thesis sets a framework for practitioners, researchers and regulators in the design of fuzzy logic systems for better management of risk in the field of <b>algorithmic</b> and high-frequency <b>trading...</b>|$|R

We confirm that algorithms react faster and more correctly to announcements than non–algorithmic traders. During the initial surge in trading activity in the first 90 seconds after the announcement, algorithms time their trades better than non–algorithmic traders, hence algorithms tend to be profitable, while non–algorithmic traders make losing trades over the same time period. During the pre announcement period, non–algorithmic volume imbalance leads algorithmic volume imbalance, however, in the post announcement period, {{the direction of the}} lead–lag relationship is exactly reversed.

Particularly, I firstly study whether the trading strategy used in this thesis generates higher return than the benchmark index MSCI World and secondly even higher return than stocks. DATA AND METHODOLOGY The dataset includes over 66, 000 possible pairs of ETFs worldwide from 2004 to 2012. In addition, I use the empirical results from the relevant papers in comparison. To test the hypothesis, I first apply cointegration tests to identify ETFs {{to be used in}} pairs trading strategies. Subsequently, I select ETF pairs to compose a pairs trading portfolio based on profitability and finally compare the results to the benchmark index and the empirical results of the relevant papers. RESULTS The empirical results of this thesis show that pairs trading with ETFs generate significant abnormal return with low volatility from the eight year trading period compared to the benchmark index as well as stocks traded with pairs trading strategy. The cumulate net profit is 105. 43 % and an annual abnormal return of 27. 29 % and with volatility of 10. 57 %.

40|$|Abstract—Recently, several low and mid-level vision algo-rithms {{have been}} {{successfully}} demonstrated at high-frame rate on a low power-budget using compact programmable CPA (Cellular Processor Arrays) vision-chips that embed a Processing Element (PE) at each pixel. Because of the inherent constraint in the VLSI design of these devices, algorithms they run are limited to scarce resources, in particular memory – that {{is the number of}} registers available per pixel. In this work, we propose an <b>algorithmic</b> procedure to <b>trade</b> off the pixel resolution of a programmable CPA vision-chip against the number of its registers. By grouping pixels into “super-pixels ” where pixel registers are interlaced, we virtually expose more registers in software allowing to run more sophisticated algorithms. We implement and demonstrate on an actual device an algorithm that could not have been executed on an existing CPA at full resolution due to its memory requirements. I...|$|R
