40|$|The HHE Program {{evaluated}} {{exposures to}} volatile organic compounds, mold, airborne particles, and formaldehyde in the autopsy suite, histology laboratory, and toxicology laboratory at a medical examiner's office. Some employees reported respiratory problems {{that may be}} related to occupational exposures, but other problems reported by employees such as acne, kidney stones, and hives were not related to work in the building. Chronic water damage was found throughout the building and mold growth and deteriorating ductwork lining were found. Disintegrated fiberglass was found in surface samples, but few intact fibers were present. Airborne formaldehyde exposures measured during five autopsies were below occupational exposure limits. Air flowed into the autopsy suite from the adjacent room as recommended and the number of air changes in the autopsy suite exceeded national guidelines. Airborne exposures to formaldehyde and volatile organic compounds in the toxicology laboratory were very low. HHE Program investigators recommended that the employer purchase local exhaust ventilation units for use during cranial autopsies. The potential for entrainment of morgue exhaust into the rooftop air intakes should be evaluated further. The employer should identify and repair all leaks in the building and remove mold from the ductwork to prevent mold spores from spreading through the ventilation system. When available, employees should use local exhaust ventilation for cranial <b>autopsy</b> <b>saws.</b> The use of powdered latex gloves was noted during the evaluation and should be stopped; nitrile gloves should be worn instead. Employees were encouraged to keep containers of formaldehyde closed except when needed during autopsies. Investigators also recommended that employees report health and safety concerns to their supervisor and their healthcare provider. Recommended citation for this report: NIOSH [2013].

50|$|Peltier's {{trial was}} held in Fargo, North Dakota, where a jury convicted Peltier of the murders of Coler and Williams. Unlike the trial for Butler and Robideau, the jury was {{informed}} that the two FBI agents were killed by close-range shots to their heads, when they were already defenseless due to previous gunshot wounds. They also <b>saw</b> <b>autopsy</b> and crime scene photographs of the two agents, which had not been shown to the jury at Cedar Rapids. In April 1977, Peltier was {{convicted and sentenced to}} two consecutive life sentences.|$|R
5000|$|Jigsaw {{also appears}} through {{flashback}}s in Saw VI. One flashback set {{prior to the}} events of the first film shows that it was Amanda Young who convinced Cecil to steal drugs from Jill's clinic, inadvertently causing her miscarriage, and John's transformation into The Jigsaw Killer. More flashbacks set prior {{to the events of}} the first film reveal that Jigsaw targeted health insurance executive William Easton for one of his games, because he had denied two-thirds of all applicants health coverage, due to a flawed policy, including Kramer himself. In the present time of Saw VI, Kramer shows himself on video twice to Easton instead of the Billy Puppet (the method Kramer usually used to speak to his subjects), so Easton could look in the eyes of someone he let die, as he underwent tests in which he was forced to decide which of his co-workers would live or die. In another flashback, this time set between the events of the first and second film, Jigsaw presents Amanda to Jill as proof that his [...] "rehabilitation" [...] works, and Jill subsequently aided him as well. A flashback set just before the events of the third and fourth films explores the group dynamic between Jigsaw, Amanda Young and Hoffman. Jigsaw criticizes Hoffman for his brutal approach, and lack of compassion for the subjects. It was also shown that Jigsaw seemed to have had a closer emotional attachment to Amanda Young than Hoffman. Shortly afterward, Jigsaw gave his ex-wife a key, which she later used to open the box he gave her in Saw V. In the present, it is revealed that the box contained six envelopes containing future test subjects, a thicker envelope, and an updated version of the [...] "Reverse Bear Trap". She gave Mark Hoffman envelopes 1 through 5, but hid everything else and later delivered the thick envelope to an unknown person at the hospital. Envelope 6 was intended for Tuck to carry out alone, and as per John's instructions she placed Hoffman in the [...] "Reverse Bear Trap"; fulfilling the promise made, via the audio tape discovered in Kramer's stomach during his <b>autopsy</b> in <b>Saw</b> IV that Hoffman would not go untested.|$|R
