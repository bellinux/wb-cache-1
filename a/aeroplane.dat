5|$|The Australian jelly {{industry}} is worth approximately $1121million per annum, and <b>Aeroplane</b> Jelly is the market leader with a 25% share. Over 19million packets of <b>Aeroplane</b> Jelly are sold each year. Strawberry flavour {{is the top}} selling jelly variant with nearly 2 million packs sold each year. In 1953, <b>Aeroplane</b> Jelly introduced Australia's first low calorie jelly. In 1988, in honour of the Australian Bicentenary, jelly was available in special Australian flavours such as Lilly Pilly, Quandong and Midjinberry. These flavours were phased out by 1992. Now <b>Aeroplane</b> Jelly is owned by American company, McCormicks foods; {{it used to be}} owned by Traders Pty Ltd. One of the least selling though was the lemon flavor which sold over 100,000 packets per annum.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>Aeroplane</b> Jelly factory {{was located}} in Paddington, New South Wales, a suburb of Sydney, then {{manufactured}} in West Ryde for 33 years.

5|$|During the House of Representatives {{debate on}} the report, the Minister, Larry Anthony, stated that he had already asked fuel {{companies}} to check their tanker wagons {{for the presence of}} water after each replenishment, and the relevant Air Navigation Order would be amended to require fuel to be drained into transparent containers. He stated that his Department did not intend to amend the relevant Air Navigation Order to require pilots of four-engine aeroplanes to perform the periodic checks in a four-engine <b>aeroplane</b> because it considered it was more challenging to fly with one engine inoperative in a two-engine <b>aeroplane</b> than in a four-engine <b>aeroplane.</b>|$|E

5|$|Adolphus Herbert Frederick Norman Appleroth, {{known as}} Bert Appleroth, was a tram {{conductor}} who created jelly crystals using gelatine {{and sugar in}} his bathtub. He sold these jelly crystals door-to-door, using his tram route to transport him around Sydney. In 1917, Appleroth rented premises to manufacture his jelly, then formed a company with Albert Francis Lenertz named Traders Pty Ltd in 1927. Planes were considered new and exciting at the time, so aviation fan Appleroth named the brand <b>Aeroplane</b> Jelly. Appleroth used a Tiger Moth plane to make deliveries to rural areas in 1934, and his publicity stunts and <b>Aeroplane</b> Jelly's advertising campaigns made the jelly a national icon, like Holden and Vegemite.|$|E
50|$|<b>Aeroplanes</b> {{were just}} coming into {{military}} {{use at the}} outset of the war. Initially, they were used mostly for reconnaissance. Pilots and engineers learned from experience, leading to the development of many specialized types, including fighters, bombers, and ground-attack <b>aeroplanes.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the 20th century, when <b>aeroplanes</b> {{were added}} to the naval arsenal, large {{warships}} carried seaplanes and flying boats for use in reconnaissance, directing the ship's artillery fire, and for carrying out offensive actions on their own. These <b>aeroplanes</b> were generally carried on, and launched from catapults, and retrieved by crane after landing on the water. Unlike aircraft carriers, the cruisers and capital ships which carried these floatplanes had very limited abilities to maintain their <b>aeroplanes,</b> or to protect them from the elements.|$|R
50|$|Construction and fencing of the Kalgoorlie Aerodrome {{commenced}} in 1928, {{and completed}} {{the following year}} with Royal Australian Airforce landing five Wapiti Jupiter Series <b>aeroplanes</b> in front of large crowds.

5|$|Airline EasyJet is {{interested}} in the inspection of aircraft with drones. It made a first inspection in 2015. Equipped with laser sensors and high resolution camera, the drone performs autonomous flight around the <b>aeroplane.</b> It generates a three-dimensional image of the aircraft and transmits it to a technician. The operator can then navigate in this representation and zoom to display a high-resolution picture of some parts of the aircraft. The operator must then visually diagnose {{the presence or absence of}} defects. This approach avoids the use of platforms to observe the upper parts of the <b>aeroplane.</b>|$|E

5|$|Capper {{oversaw the}} first Army aeroplanes. He briefly flew Dunne's first glider, the D.1, during secret trials at Blair Atholl in Scotland in 1907. The flight had {{lasted only a}} few seconds when the glider crashed into a wall, with Capper {{sustaining}} a cut to the head. The next year, Cody flew the first British-built <b>aeroplane</b> at Farnborough, which earned it the title British Army <b>Aeroplane</b> No.1. This was an ironic achievement for Capper's command, as he had pinned his personal hopes on Dunne, whose D.4 achieved {{no more than a few}} hops.|$|E

5|$|That Autumn the {{government}} conducted a formal inquiry into military aviation. Capper {{had to return}} early from Blair Atholl in order to present his evidence. He argued strongly for a promising future {{of all forms of}} aeronautics and especially the <b>aeroplane.</b> However his Army superiors on the committee were against aeronautics in any form. It was decided that only small-scale airship experiments should continue and that <b>aeroplane</b> work should be stopped. It formally ceased when Dunne and Cody's contracts ran {{out at the end of}} March 1909.|$|E
5|$|The British and Colonial <b>Aeroplane</b> Company, {{which later}} became the Bristol <b>Aeroplane</b> Company, then part of the British Aircraft Company and finally BAE Systems, was founded by Sir George White, owner of Bristol Tramways in 1910. During World War I {{production}} of the Bristol Scout and the Bristol F.2 Fighter established {{the reputation of the}} company. The main base at Filton is still a prominent manufacturing site for BAE Systems in the 21st century. The Bristol <b>Aeroplane</b> Company's engine department became a subsidiary company Bristol Aero Engines, then Bristol Siddeley Engines; and were bought by Rolls-Royce Limited in 1966, to become Rolls-Royce plc which is still based at Filton. Shipbuilding in the city docks, predominately by Charles Hill & Sons, formerly Hilhouse, remained important until the 1970s. Other prominent industries included chocolate manufacturers J. S. Fry & Sons and wine and sherry importers John Harvey & Sons.|$|E
40|$|Stringent {{noise limits}} have been imposed on {{ultralight}} <b>aeroplanes</b> in the Federal Republic of Germany. The "Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection" (CAEP) of the "International Civil Aviation Organization" (ICAO) intends to formulate internationally binding noise regulations for ultralight <b>aeroplanes.</b> In view {{of these developments}} an experimental and theoretical research program was initiated to investigate specifically the noise sources and noise characteristics of ultralight <b>aeroplanes.</b> The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the technical feasibility of meeting existing or proposed noise limits - especially in comparison with the noise limits for "light propeller-driven aeroplanes" (ANNEX 16 /Chapter 6) and to further establish the minimum noise radiation from various types of ultralight <b>aeroplanes</b> within operational limitations. Flyover and ground static noise measurements on tractor- and pusher-propeller driven ultralight <b>aeroplanes</b> and wind tunnel noise measurements on isolated full-scale ultralight-aeroplane propellers were conducted. Engine noise was studied seperately providing information on the relationship of engine rotational speed and exhaust noise. In an overall sense the study showed that only tractor propeller driven ultralight <b>aeroplanes</b> have a chance to comply with the current stringent (German) noise limits; they must be of clean aerodynamic design, be equipped with thoroughly muffled engines and their operational propeller blade tip Mach number must be limited to values well below 0. 5...|$|R
