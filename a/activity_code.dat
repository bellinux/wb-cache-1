40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{a model for the}} {{generation}} of grid cells and the emergence of place cells from multimodal input to the entorhinal cortex (EC). In this model, grid cell activity in the dorsocaudal medial entorhinal cortex (dMEC) [28] results from the opera-tion of a long-distance path integration system located outside the hippocampal formation, presumably in retrosplenial and/or parietal cortex. If the connections between these struc-tures and dMEC are organized as a modulo N operator, the resulting activity of dMEC neurons is a grid cell pattern. Furthermore, a robust high-resolution positional code can be built from a small set of different grid cells if the modulo factors are relatively prime. On the other hand, broad visual place cell activity in the MEC can result from the inte-gration of visual information depending on the view-field of the visual input. The merging of entorhinal visual place cell information and grid cell information in the EC and/or in the dentate gyrus (DG) allows the building of precise and robust “place cells ” (e. g., whose activity is maintained if light is suppressed for a short duration). Our model supports our previous proposition that hippocampal “place cell ” <b>activity</b> <b>code</b> transitions between two successive states (“transition cells”) rather than mere current locations.

The effect of the zab mutation on DNA stability was investigated. In vivo, a strain carrying the zab- 53 mutation shows (i) no spontaneous DNA degradation and (ii) rapid DNA degradation after ultraviolet irradiation, which depends upon the exonuclease V <b>activity</b> <b>coded</b> by recB+/C+genes and which is independent from the correndonuclease II <b>activity</b> <b>coded</b> by uvrA+/B+.

The degradation patterns of these tif-suppressed strains are shown to be remarkably reproducible in bacteria made permeable to metabolites, by toluene or toluene plus Triton X- 100. The degradation properties reflect the activity of the same biochemical system that works in vivo, in that degradation depends upon the presence of recA, zab, or lexA, ultraviolet irradiation, and exonuclease V activity.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} {{reliability}} of work-related activity coding for injury-related hospitalisations in Australia. METHOD: A random sample of 4, 373 injury-related hospital separations from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2004 were obtained from a stratified random sample of 50 hospitals across four states in Australia. From this sample, cases were identified as work-related if they contained an ICD- 10 -AM work-related <b>activity</b> <b>code</b> (U 73) allocated by either: (i) the original coder; (ii) an independent auditor, blinded to the original code; or (iii) a research assistant, blinded to both the original and auditor codes, who reviewed narrative text extracted from the medical record. The concordance of activity coding and number of cases identified as work-related using each method were compared. RESULTS: Of the 4, 373 cases sampled, 318 cases were identified as being work-related using {{any of the three}} methods for identification. The original coder identified 217 and the auditor identified 266 work-related cases (68. 2 % and 83. 6 % of the total cases identified, respectively). Around 10 % of cases were only identified through the text description review. The original coder and auditor agreed on the assignment of work-relatedness for 68. 9 % of cases. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The best estimates of the frequency of hospital admissions for occupational injury underestimate the burden by around 32 %. This is a substantial underestimate that has major implications for public policy, and highlights the need for further work on improving the quality and completeness of routine, administrative data sources for a more complete identification of work-related injuries. 7 page(s...|$|E

Methods: A {{random sample of}} 4850 discharges from 2002 to 2004 was obtained from a stratified random sample of 50 hospitals across four states in Australia. On-site medical record reviews were conducted and external cause codes were assigned blinded to the original coded data. Code agreement levels were grouped into the following agreement categories: block level, 3 -character level, 4 -character level, 5 th-character level, and complete code level. Results: At a broad block level, code agreement was found in over 90 % of cases for most mechanisms (eg, transport, fall). Percentage disagreement was 26. 0 % at the 3 -character level; agreement for the complete external cause code was 67. 6 %. For activity codes, the percentage of disagreement at the 3 -character level was 7. 3 % and agreement for the complete <b>activity</b> <b>code</b> was 68. 0 %.
