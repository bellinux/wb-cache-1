40|$|Pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) is a {{fruit with}} a long {{medicinal}} history, especially due to its phenolic compounds content, such as the anthocyanins, which are reported {{as one of the}} most important natural antioxidants. The analysis of the anthocyanins by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) can be considered as an important tool to evaluate the quality of pomegranate juice.
