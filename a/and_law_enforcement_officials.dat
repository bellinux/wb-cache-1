5|$|On August 26, 2008 Itzhak and Meir Abergil {{along with}} Moshe Malul and Israel Ozifa were brought before a Jerusalem Magistrate′s Court judge for their alleged {{role in the}} killing of Israeli drug dealer Sami Atias in Encino in August 2003, as a revenge for his {{allegedly}} having stolen money from them. They were remanded in custody together with Sason Barashi {{as a result of a}} request by law enforcement in the United States for their extradition. The indictment includes four different crimes that are attributed to Yitzhak Abergil: involvement together with Malul in the murder of Atias in California in 2003, trade in Ecstasy, extortion and violence against businessmen, and money laundering and fraud. The inquiry into the case had lasted for six years, involving the FBI, tax authorities <b>and</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>officials</b> in more than ten countries in America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East.|$|E

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The {{free flow of information}} among federal, state, <b>and</b> local <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> agencies could prove vital to fighting the war on terrorism. State <b>and</b> local <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>officials</b> are key stakeholders in the United States' efforts to combat terrorism, and as such, they may require access to classified national security information to help prevent or respond to terrorist attacks. In order to gain access to such information, state <b>and</b> local <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>officials</b> generally need federal security clearances. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) grants security clearances and shares classified information with state <b>and</b> local <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>officials.</b> Immediately following September 11, 2001, some state <b>and</b> local <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>officials</b> expressed frustration with the complexity of the process for obtaining security clearances. Others expressed frustration with the length of time it took to obtain a security clearance. These frustrations exacerbated the general concern among <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> stakeholders that the lack of security clearances could impede the flow of critical information from the FBI to {{the state and local level}}, from the state and local level to the FBI, and laterally from one state or local agency to another. In turn, this potential lack of access to critical terrorism-related information might place local <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>officials</b> at a disadvantage in their efforts to respond to or combat a terrorist threat. The Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, Senate Committee on the Judiciary asked us to examine several issues regarding the FBI's process for granting security clearances to state <b>and</b> local <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>officials.</b> This report provides information on: (1) the FBI's process for granting security clearances to state <b>and</b> local <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>officials,</b> (2) the extent to which the FBI has met its time frame goals for processing security clearance applications for state <b>and</b> local <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>officials</b> <b>and</b> factors that could affect the timely processing of security clearance applications, and (3) efforts undertaken by the FBI to enhance its security clearance and information-sharing processes with state <b>and</b> local <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>officials.</b> ...|$|R

25|$|The book is {{primarily}} {{designed for use}} by counterterrorism <b>and</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>officials.</b> Terrorist Recognition Handbook is structured into six main sections of information and resources.

Nance's main thesis throughout the work is that law enforcement officials must remain vigilant for potential terrorist activities. He compares and contrasts the field of counterterrorism to ordinary criminal prevention, noting that in both cases law enforcement officials should become experts on developing awareness of commons behavior patterns of suspects.|$|E

500|$|Söze's {{character}} {{is based on}} John List, a New Jersey accountant who murdered his family in 1971 and then disappeared for almost two decades, assuming a new identity before he was ultimately apprehended. McQuarrie based the name of Keyser Söze {{on one of his}} previous supervisors, Kayser Sume, at a Los Angeles law firm that he worked for, but decided to change the last name because he thought that his former boss would object to how it was used. He found the word söze in his roommate's English-to-Turkish dictionary, which translates as [...] "talk too much". All the characters' names are taken from staff members of the law firm {{at the time of his}} employment. McQuarrie had also worked for a detective agency, and this influenced the depiction of criminals <b>and</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>officials</b> in the script.|$|E
500|$|The National Action Plan was {{received}} positively by many, but not all, Canadian NGOs <b>and</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>officials.</b> Natasha Falle, {{founder and director}} of Sex Trade 101, said that, as an organization of sex trafficking victims, they were extremely pleased with the establishment of the NAP-CHT. When the Canadian government announced that the country's sex industry would no longer be allowed to employ foreign workers because of the risks of exploitation, abuse, and trafficking in that environment, Tim Lambrinosleader of the Adult Entertainment Association of Canadasaid that he might challenge the policy because he believed that the government was [...] "destroying an industry [...] creating a labour shortage." [...] Bethany Hastie of McGill University, Shae Invidiata of Free-Them, and Andrea Burkhart of ACT Alberta all criticized the plan for focusing too much on law enforcement and not enough on victim services.|$|E

500|$|Till's {{body was}} {{returned}} to Chicago where his mother insisted on a public funeral service with an open casket. [...] "The open-coffin funeral held by Mamie Till Bradley exposed the world to more than her son Emmett Till's bloated, mutilated body. Her decision focused attention not only on American racism and the barbarism of lynching {{but also on the}} limitations and vulnerabilities of American democracy". Tens of thousands attended his funeral or viewed his open casket, and images of his mutilated body were published in black-oriented magazines and newspapers, rallying popular black support and white sympathy across the U.S. [...] Intense scrutiny was brought to bear on the lack of black civil rights in Mississippi, with newspapers around America critical of the state. Although initially local newspapers <b>and</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>officials</b> decried the violence against Till and called for justice, they responded to national criticism by defending Mississippians, temporarily giving support to the killers.|$|E
500|$|The {{establishment}} of the plan was received positively by many Canadian NGOs <b>and</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>officials.</b> Within a day of its establishment, the plan had received support from the parents of human trafficking victims. Glendene Grant, mother of missing human trafficking victim Jessie Foster, said, [...] "From {{the bottom of my}} heart, I {{would like to thank the}} government of Canada for their development and launch of the Canadian National Action Plan to Combat the Crime of Human Trafficking, making our country one of the leaders in the fight against this crime." [...] Around the same time, the EFC voiced its support for the plan, specifically praising the commitments to create a national human trafficking law enforcement taskforce, to raise awareness, to invest in prevention, to care for victims, and to consult with stakeholders on an ongoing basis. The EFC's policy analyst Julia Beazley said that the organization was [...] "particularly pleased with the proposals aimed at combatting sexual exploitation, and with the focus given to our Aboriginal communities, which are particularly vulnerable to trafficking." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{announcement}} dominated {{television and}} newspapers; Ferraro was besieged by {{questions regarding the}} finances as well as criticism for ethnic stereotyping. As she later wrote, [...] "I had created a monster." [...] Republicans saw her finances as a [...] "genderless" [...] issue that they could attack Ferraro with without creating a backlash, and some Mondale staffers thought Ferraro might {{have to leave the}} ticket. The Philadelphia Inquirer went even further in its investigations, seeking to link Zaccaro to organized crime figures, but most publishers avoided this topic <b>and</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>officials</b> did not treat the allegations with much seriousness. A week after her previous statement, Ferraro said Zaccaro had changed his mind and would indeed release his tax records, which was done on [...] The full statements included notice of payment of some $53,000 in back federal taxes that she owed due to what was described as an accountant's error. Ferraro said the statements proved overall that she had nothing to hide and that there had been no financial wrongdoing. The disclosures indicated that Ferraro and her husband were worth nearly $4million, had a full-time maid, and owned a boat and the two vacation homes. Much of their wealth was tied up in real estate rather than being disposable income, but the disclosures hurt Ferraro's image as a rags-to-riches story.|$|E
50|$|In its 1997 {{decision}} in the case, the Supreme Court ruled that the provision of the Brady Act that compelled state <b>and</b> local <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>officials</b> to perform the background checks was unconstitutional on 10th amendment grounds. The Court determined that this provision violated both the concept of federalism {{and that of the}} unitary executive. However, the overall Brady statute was upheld and state <b>and</b> local <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>officials</b> remained free to conduct background checks if they so chose. The vast majority continued to do so. In 1998, background checks for firearm purchases became mostly a federally run activity when NICS came online, although many states continue to mandate state run background checks before a gun dealer may transfer a firearm to a buyer.|$|R

2500|$|The 1967 Public Law 90-100 {{found the}} traffic in {{pornography}} to be [...] "a matter of national concern", {{as well as}} in obscenity. In this period the Court considered pornography to have two major dimensions. The first can be defined as dealing with sexual representations that are offensive to public morality or taste, which concerned the Court notably in the 1966 Ginzburg v. United States case. The second centers on the effect of pornography on specific individuals or classes, which is the focus of most public discussions and prior Court pornography decisions. This dimension was mentioned only twice in the array of decisions made in 1966. A frustration was expressed notably by Justice Hugo Black in the 1966 Mishkin v. New York: [...] "I wish once more to express my objections to saddling this Court with the irksome and inevitably unpopular and unwholesome task of finally deciding by a case-by-case, sight-by-sight personal judgment of the members of this Court what pornography (whatever that means) is too hard core for people to see or read." [...] In the 1974 Hamling v. United States decision the Supreme Court said that just because pornographic materials are for sale and purchased around the country, [...] "Mere availability of similar materials by itself means nothing more than that other persons are engaged in similar activities." [...] The 1976 American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language defined that pornography consists of [...] "written, graphic, or other forms of communication intended to excite lascivious feelings". Since determining what is pornography and what is [...] "soft core" [...] and [...] "hard core" [...] are subjective questions to judges, juries, <b>and</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>officials,</b> it is difficult to define, since the law cases cannot print examples for the courts to follow. The Rehnquist Court further enhanced the power of community controls on pornography. Current Chief Justice John Roberts told at the confirmation hearing on his nomination: [...] "Well, Senator, it's my understanding under the Supreme Court's doctrine that pornographic expression is not protected to the same extent at least as political and core speech, and the difficulty that the Court has addressed in these different areas of course is always defining what is or is not pornography and what is entitled to protection under the First Amendment and what is not".|$|E
