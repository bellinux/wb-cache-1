40|$|Association with a deviant {{peer group}} is a robust {{correlate}} of juvenile antisocial behavior. The current study focused on whether this association differed for antisocial youth with and without callous– unemotional (CU) traits and whether potential mediators of this association differed for the 2 groups. Deviant peer group association was examined in a community sample (N 98) of high-risk youth. The sample was assessed at 4 yearly intervals. Across all <b>assessment</b> <b>points,</b> children with conduct problems and CU traits showed {{the highest level of}} affiliation with deviant peers. At the first 2 <b>assessment</b> <b>points,</b> this effect was largely mediated by dysfunctional parenting and problems in the child’s social relation-ships. In contrast, the mediational role of these variables was much weaker at the last 2 <b>assessment</b> <b>points.</b> Research has consistently indicated that adolescents are signif-icantly {{more likely to engage in}} antisocial behavior within delin...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{equality}} of subjective- and objective-assessment methods in laparoscopic surgery are unknown. The {{aim of this}} study was to compare a subjective assessment method to an objective assessment method to evaluate laparoscopic skill. Methods: A prospective observational cohort study was conducted. Seventy-two residents completed a basic laparoscopic suturing task on a box trainer at two consecutive <b>assessment</b> <b>points.</b> Laparoscopic skill was rated subjectively using the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) list and objectively using the TrEndo, an augmented-reality simulator. Results: TrEndo scores between the two <b>assessment</b> <b>points</b> correlated. OSATS scores did not correlate between the two <b>assessment</b> <b>points.</b> There was a correlation between TrEndo and OSATS scores at the first assessment point, but not at the second assessment point. Overall, OSATS scores correlated with TrEndo scores. There was a greater spread within OSATS scores compared to TrEndo scores. Conclusion: OSATS scores correlated with TrEndo scores. The TrEndo may be more responsive at rating individual’s laparoscopic skill, as demonstrated by a smaller overall spread in TrEndo scores. The additional value of objective assessment methods over conventional assessment methods as provided by laparoscopic simulators should be investigated...|$|E
30|$|This {{study used}} a {{specially}} designed accuracy assessment phantom (Koivukangas 2012) to assess the accuracy of a commercial surgical navigator, the StealthStation S 7 (Medtronic Inc., Louisville, CO, USA). The navigator enabled the interchangeable use of both OTS and EMTS. The phantom consisted of three separate levels attached with screws to form the total reference volume. On each level a total of 49 accuracy <b>assessment</b> <b>points</b> were machined with 20 mm displacement between the beveled holes. This gave a specific region of surgical interest (ROSI) volume of 120 x 120 x 100 mm. The phantom was industrially verified at Oulu PMC using the Mitutoyo Strato 9166 (Mitutoyo, Japan) accuracy sensing device. The displacement error of the accuracy <b>assessment</b> <b>points</b> {{was found to be}} +/− 0.015 mm.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{association}} of adolescent depression and anxiety symptoms with alcohol abuse or dependence in young adulthood. Design, setting and participants: Cohort study of the health and wellbeing of {{adolescents and young adults}} in Victoria, assessed at 8 waves (periods) of data collection, from age 14 to 24 years, between 1992 and 2003. Young people who participated in the cohort study at least once during the six adolescent <b>assessment</b> <b>points</b> (conducted 6 months apart, from age 14 to 17 years), at least once during young adulthood and who were alive at Wave 8 (n = 1758). Main outcome measure: Alcohol abuse or dependence assessed using the alcohol and substance abuse modules of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview at age 24 years. Results: Adolescents with moderate to high levels of depression and anxiety symptoms (measured by the revised Clinical Interview Schedule) had an increased risk of alcohol abuse or dependence in young adulthood, compared with young adults with low levels of adolescent depression and anxiety symptoms, after adjusting for potential confounding factors. Risk was higher for those with symptoms at more than two adolescent <b>assessment</b> <b>points</b> (odds ratio [OR] 1. 9; 95 % CI, 1. 7 – 2. 0) and for those with symptoms at one or two <b>assessment</b> <b>points</b> (OR 1. 3; 95 % CI, 1. 2 – 1. 4), compared with those with no above-threshold symptoms in adolescence. Conclusions: Adolescents with depression and anxiety symptoms are at increased risk for alcohol use disorders into young adulthood. They warrant vigilance from primary care providers in relation to alcohol use well into adulthood. <br /...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the role of children’s trust beliefs and trustworthiness {{in the development of}} prosocial behavior using data from four waves of a longitudinal study in a large, ethnically diverse sample of children in Switzerland (mean age = 8. 11 years at Time 1, N = 1, 028). Prosocial behavior directed towards peers was measured at all <b>assessment</b> <b>points</b> by teacher reports. Children’s trust beliefs and their trustworthiness with peers were assessed and calculated by a social relations analysis at the first assessment point using children’s reports {{of the extent to which}} classmates kept promises. In addition, teacher reports of children’s trustworthiness were assessed at all four <b>assessment</b> <b>points.</b> Latent growth curve modeling yielded a decrease in prosocial behavior over time. Peer- and teacher-reported trustworthiness predicted higher initial levels of prosocial behavior, and peer-reported trustworthiness predicted less steep decreases in prosocial behavior over time. Autoregressive cross-lagged analysis also revealed bidirectional longitudinal associations between teacher-reported trustworthiness and prosocial behavior. We discuss the implications of the findings for research on the role of trust in the development of children’s prosocial behavior...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether a decrease in thickness of the sole soft tissues (SST) beneath the flexor tuberosity of the distal phalanx (i. e. the digital cushion and corium) predisposed a claw to develop claw horn disruption lesions (CHDL) or a leg to lameness. Data were analysed from a longitudinal study of 179 cows, which had been examined at 5 <b>assessment</b> <b>points</b> - 8, + 1, + 9, + 17 and + 29 weeks relative to either their 1 st, 2 nd, 3 rd or 4 th calving. At each assessment point, SST were measured using ultrasonography. Additional assessment point data included sole lesions and back fat thickness (BFT), and cows had been locomotion scored fortnightly from calving. 158 cows completed the study. Separate logistic regression survival analyses were constructed to assess the outcomes, either lameness on a leg or CHDL on a claw; combinations of lameness and lesions were tested as outcomes. Cow level variables tested included farm and lactation number. Variables were tested describing previous SST thickness, minimum previous SST thickness, BFT, and change in either variable between prior <b>assessment</b> <b>points.</b> Prior lesions/lameness strongly predicted repeat cases and the final models had the outcome first lesion or lameness on a claw or leg. In the reported lameness models, lameness was defined as a leg being recorded as lame twice within three consecutive scores, and in the reported lesion models, lesion was defined as the first presence of either a sole ulcer or a severe sole haemorrhage on a claw. Thin SST increased the likelihood of lesion occurrence; thin SST on 43 the lateral claw predicted subsequent lameness on a leg. Thin BFT and thinning of BFT between previous <b>assessment</b> <b>points</b> increased the likelihood of future lesion occurrence. Thin SST and thinning of BFT had additional effects on the likelihood of lesion occurrence, suggesting that BFT and sole SST had independent effects on lesion occurrence. However, change in SST thickness between <b>assessment</b> <b>points</b> did not influenced the likelihood of future lesions or lameness. This suggests that thin SST were not simply a result of depletion of body fat and challenges the theory that thinning of the digital cushion with body fat mobilization leads to CHDL. Other possible mechanisms by which SST become thin are discussed, and could include changes in integrity of the suspensory apparatus with physiological events...|$|E
