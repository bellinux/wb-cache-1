5|$|In 1968, Hendrix and Jeffery jointly {{invested}} in {{the purchase of the}} Generation Club in Greenwich Village. They had initially planned to reopen the establishment, but after an audit revealed that Hendrix had incurred exorbitant fees by block-booking lengthy sessions at peak rates they decided that the building would better serve them as a recording studio. With a facility of his own, Hendrix could work as much as he wanted while also reducing his recording expenditures, which had reached a reported $300,000 annually. Architect and acoustician John Storyk designed Electric Lady Studios for Hendrix, who requested that they avoid right angles where possible. With round windows, an ambient lighting machine, and a psychedelic mural, Storyk wanted the studio to have <b>a</b> <b>relaxing</b> environment that would encourage Hendrix's creativity. The project took twice as long as planned and cost twice as much as Hendrix and Jeffery had budgeted, with their total investment estimated at $1 million.|$|E

25|$|Schur {{found himself}} lonely after {{the flight of}} many of his {{students}} and the expulsion of renowned scientists from his previous place of work. Only Dr. Helmut Grunsky had been friendly to him, as Schur reported in the late thirties to his expatriate student Max Menachem Schiffer. The Gestapo was everywhere. Since Schur had announced to his wife his intentions to commit suicide in case of a summons to the Gestapo, in the summer of 1938 his wife took his letters, and with them a summons from the Gestapo, sent Issai Schur to <b>a</b> <b>relaxing</b> stay in a home outside of Berlin and went with medical certificate allowing her to meet the Gestapo in place of her husband. There they flatly asked why they were still staying in Germany. But there were economic obstacles to the planned emigration : Emigrating Germans had a pre-departure Reich Flight Tax to pay, which was a quarter of their assets. Now Schur's wife had inherited a mortgage on a house in Lithuania, which because of the Lithuanian foreign exchange determination could not be repaid. On the other hand, Schur was forbidden to default or leave the mortgage to the German Reich. Thus the Schurs lacked cash and cash equivalents. Finally, the missing sum of money was somehow supplied, and to this day {{it does not seem to}} be clear who were the donors.|$|E

A reviewer for Game Informer said that the game pointed [...] "to a bright future" [...] in which games would inspire {{a wider range of}} emotions; however, the writer called Cloud more of an [...] "experience" [...] than a game.

She wrote that on Saturdays, people could be asked to [...] "have <b>a</b> <b>relaxing</b> day". People with highly variable jobs such as emergency room nurses may appreciate [...] "have a routine day", while mothers of young children may wish to [...] "have a quiet day". Debbie Lundberg wrote in her 2008book Have a Nice Day Is Not Thank You, and No Problem Is Not You're Welcome that service people should say [...] "thank you" [...] instead of [...] "have a nice day". She argued that [...] "thank you" [...] is shorter and is a [...] "recognition of the ability you have to thank someone", which adds more worth to the purchase than something that will occur in the future. Paul V.

500|$|The five subtitled DVDs {{released}} by Media Blasters were reviewed by Anime News Network (ANN). The first DVD was declared rental-worthy by ANN, citing the characters as being [...] "a lot of fun" [...] and the series {{as being a}} [...] "very laid-back show" [...] that would work well as <b>a</b> <b>relaxing</b> watch over a weekend. The content, however, was described as getting the series off to a [...] "slow start", with limitations of the first six episodes being the lack in fan service, humor, and that it [...] "struggles to find any other reason to be compelling". The second DVD, containing episodes seven through eleven, was reviewed as failing to [...] "materialize much real plot" [...] {{and content of the}} episodes was described as existing [...] "only to appeal to otaku who can get excited about moe content". The third DVD, compiling episodes twelve through sixteen, shows [...] "signs of an actual plot" [...] and contains a [...] "sudden explosion of fan service", which are noted as [...] "noteworthy developments" [...] in the review. In the fourth DVD, containing episodes seventeen through twenty-one, [...] "the series' romantic side does finally pay off with a romantic arc that actually engages". In the fifth and final DVD containing the last five episodes, the Hikari and Amane relationship is described as lacking chemistry, although the Nagisa and Shizuma pairing is regarded as satisfying.|$|E
500|$|The aim from {{an early}} stage was not to {{simulate}} diving, but instead to capture the dream-like feeling of ocean exploration. As part of his research, Nava experimented with other ocean simulation games and found they were not [...] "fun". By removing any time limit or air gauge, the team sought to promote <b>a</b> <b>relaxing</b> sense of exploration. One of the main issues was giving the player complete freedom to swim around, including doing a full loop—this effect was normally held back due to camera difficulties, but Giant Squid managed {{to resolve the issue}} and allow for greater range of movement. The meditation mechanic was added during later development from 2015 to 2016 as a means of allowing players a view of the surrounding marine life and environment. When choosing their game engine, Matt Nava was still the only staff member and so they needed an easy-to-use platform with tools and technology to create his vision. Unreal Engine 4 was still quite new at this time, but it was chosen after the team had vetted other developer software available at the time. The team were able to use both Unreal Engine 4's advanced developer tools and expand the engine's functionality to incorporate unique elements such as fish shoal behavior, vegetation animation, and underwater lighting. Using Unreal Engine 4 allowed engineer Derek Cornish to construct unique systems for underwater lighting effects.|$|E

It holds an aggregate score of 62.22% on GameRankings with nine reviews, {{making it the}} 17th best Game Boy game and the 13,154th best video game. By May 28, 1995 Kirby's Dream Land had sold 1.3 million copies. To date, it has sold in excess of 5 million copies worldwide; Gamasutra cited its new style of gameplay for its success. At the time, it was HAL Laboratory's most successful game. Gamasutra's Osamu Inoue attributed the game's success to Satoru Iwata, formerly an employee of HAL Laboratory, who Inoue comments has a [...] "simple-minded passion for creating games". Game Informers Ben Reeves called it the 14th best Game Boy game and {{felt that it was}} <b>a</b> <b>relaxing</b> game. Author Wendy Despain used Kirby's Dream Lands plot {{as an example of how}} early platform games' plots progressed, which she collectively described as [...] "the main character needing to reach a villain to put right a wrong." [...] Humongous Life's Jonathan Wahlgren called it a strong game, but felt it to be [...] "too elementary". GamesRadar's Brett Elston did an article on its music, specifically giving praise to the final boss music, stating that it is the [...] "only song in the original Kirby that had a sense of challenge or conflict instead of skipping through a field of floating cakes." [...] Nadia Oxford of 1UP.com praised it for its unique platforming mechanics, describing it as the start of a [...] "gluttonous legend". Allgame's Joshua Crystal called it a [...] "great game for beginner players and ones that enjoy a fun, but short, experience.".|$|E
500|$|Mini Metro {{received}} [...] "generally favourable" [...] reception from critics {{according to}} aggregate review website Metacritic. Technology Tell writer, Jenni Lada described Mini Metro as [...] "aesthetically pleasing" [...] and found {{playing the game}} an oddly relaxing experience, despite the game's attempt to put the player under pressure. Lena LeRay, of IndieGames.com, also felt that Mini Metro had <b>a</b> <b>relaxing</b> tone and complimented its intuitive interface. LeRay appreciated changes that were made during the early access phase, noting that audio and the Daily Challenge mode were welcome additions, and the interface improvements had diminished her initial complaints about the game. Reviewing the PC version, GamesTM thought that the depth of Mini Metros gameplay along with the difficulty scaling kept the game interesting. However, they did question why the game hadn't been released for smartphones yet, pointing out that such devices would be suited for the game's simple interface. Kill Screen editor, Ethan Gach commended the game for its simplicity and elegance, having combined interactive aesthetics with a robust simulation. Alec Meer of Rock, Paper, Shotgun praised the game for being a [...] "mesmerising challenge of logic and aesthetics". He particularly enjoyed how beautifully the gameplay descended into chaos as the difficulty gradually increased, calling it [...] "elegant even in disaster". He also thought that Mini Metro was {{a good example of}} how to release game in early access. Reviewing the mobile version, Gamezebo writer Rob Rich commended the visual design and intuitive touch controls. He thought that the use of geometric shapes to represent commuters and stations helped simplify the complicated tasks, resulting in an accessible game. Pocket Gamer reviewer Christian Valentin remarked that the game felt confusing early on but became [...] "surprisingly engaging".|$|E
