5|$|The North Circular Road has a {{wide variety}} of styles and {{standards}} of junctions connecting to other roads. These range from the complex, grade-separated design at Charlie Brown's near Woodford, to <b>at-grade</b> junctions with traffic lights. The original road contained entirely <b>at-grade</b> junctions; many of these were improved and grade separated during the late 1970s and early 1980s.|$|E
5|$|As it {{progresses}} into residential subdivisions, the Hanlon Expressway encounters an <b>at-grade</b> intersection, with Downey Road travelling to {{the west}} and Kortright Road West to the east. Continuing north, the route crosses to {{the east side of the}} Hanlon Road right-of-way as it intersects Stone Road West {{to the west}} of the Stone Road Mall. Before crossing the Speed River, the expressway meets College Avenue West, an <b>at-grade</b> intersection at the southwest corner of Centennial Park Arena.|$|E
5|$|By 1994, {{the final}} <b>at-grade</b> intersections—one at Morning Star Drive, and another as {{a left turn}} to the {{southbound}} lanes with eastbound Highway409—were replaced, making Highway427 a fully controlled-access freeway for its entire length.|$|E
5|$|A modern {{light rail}} system was {{proposed}} by a newly formed regional transit authority (RTA) in 1995, including a line running through the Rainier Valley on Martin Luther King Jr. Way with a stop at South Henderson Street to serve Rainier Beach. The $6.7 billion proposal was rejected by voters in March 1995, and the RTA proposed a smaller, $3.9 billion transit system with an <b>at-grade</b> station at South Henderson Street; the new proposal was approved by voters in November 1996. The RTA, which renamed itself to Sound Transit, selected an <b>at-grade</b> alignment for light rail on Martin Luther King Jr. Way South in 1999, with a station at South Henderson Street.|$|E
5|$|At its {{southern}} terminus, the route begins at Coules Court, where Brown's Line becomesHighway 427. Alderwood Plaza, {{located on the}} east side of the route, has a parking lot which provides access to the highway; this is the only <b>at-grade</b> access along the length of the route.|$|E
5|$|Concerns from Rainier Valley {{residents}} over blocked intersections, property acquisition, {{and equity}} led the RTA (later re-branded as Sound Transit) {{to study a}} $400million tunnel through the Rainier Valley. In November 1999, the Sound Transit Board reaffirmed its selection of an <b>at-grade</b> alignment on Martin Luther King Jr. Way South, with a station at South Othello Street.|$|E
5|$|Over the years, several traffic circles {{have been}} {{modified}} or replaced along Route 73. The Marlton Circle at Route 70 in Marlton was modified in 1974 to allow Route 73 to run directly {{straight through the}} circle. This circle became known for traffic backups and was replaced with an interchange. Construction on this interchange, which cost $31 million, began in April 2009. In May 2010, the circle was eliminated with a temporary <b>at-grade</b> intersection constructed while the Route 73 bridge over Route 70 was being built. The interchange was completed in June 2011. A traffic circle that existed {{at the intersection of}} Route 38 and Route 41 in Maple Shade Township was removed by the 1960s and replaced by the current set of interchanges. In addition, the Berlin Circle in Berlin was replaced by an <b>at-grade</b> intersection between August 2005 and September 2006 at a cost of $73 million.|$|E
5|$|The Hanlon Expressway {{crosses the}} Speed River as it swerves {{to the west}} and meets Wellington Street, the only other {{interchange}} along the route. To the east, Wellington Road is Highway7, which follows the Hanlon Expressway north from the interchange; to the west it was formerly Highway24. North of the Wellington Road the expressway was built slightly west of what is now Silvercreek Parkway. It passes beneath the a line of the Goderich–Exeter Railway, a sideline of the Canadian Pacific Railway, before encountering three <b>at-grade</b> intersections: Paisley Road, Willow Road and Speedvale Avenue West. This section also features two <b>at-grade</b> rail crossings. Shortly thereafter, it ends at Woodlawn Road West; Highway6 travels east from this point while Highway7 travels west.|$|E
5|$|The RTA, by then renamed to Sound Transit, began {{a series}} of public {{hearings}} in late 1997 to determine the routing of the line. Tukwila leaders preferred a route serving the Southcenter Mall that would add six to seven minutes of travel time and $150 million in project costs. The Sound Transit Board chose an <b>at-grade</b> line on International Boulevard as their preferred routing in February 1999, which the city argued would interfere with their near-term plans to revamp the street. The board's preferred route, selected in November 1999, included an <b>at-grade</b> line on International Boulevard through Tukwila and an elevated station at South 154th Street with a park and ride facility.|$|E
5|$|The smokehouse, {{measuring}} about , is {{adjacent to}} the kitchen addition. It is set into a hillside, allowing <b>at-grade</b> entry to its two levels. Built of square-cut logs with white chinking atop a rubble masonry foundation, the smokehouse is topped with a standing seam metal gabled roof.|$|E
5|$|The southern-half of {{the area}} then {{underwent}} significant development, as the retaining wall along the river was repaired and an <b>at-grade</b> rail crossing was installed at the park's western boundary. Construction then began in 1998 and concluded in fall 1999 at a total cost of $5million. The park was officially opened on October 2, 1999.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 1970s, {{construction}} {{began on}} a northward extension of the Conestoga Parkway from King Street to Northfield Drive; this was completed by 1977. By then, construction was underway on a two lane bypass of St. Jacobs east of the original route, connecting with the Conestoga Parkway at Northfield Drive, then an <b>at-grade</b> intersection.|$|E
5|$|Concerns from Rainier Valley {{residents}} over blocked intersections, property {{acquisition and}} equity led the RTA (later re-branded as Sound Transit) {{to study a}} $400 million tunnel through the Rainier Valley. In November 1999, the Sound Transit Board instead selected an <b>at-grade</b> alignment on Martin Luther King Jr. Way {{to the west of}} Rainier, with a station at South Edmunds Street.|$|E
5|$|Construction stalled {{for several}} years as funding was {{diverted}} from the project during a recession in the early 1980s. It would take until 1987 for work to resume to replace the <b>at-grade</b> intersections at Matchette Road, Malden Road, Huron Church Road and Dominion Boulevard. The City of Windsor nevertheless earmarked funding from their budget to build the last two of those interchanges in late 1986.|$|E
5|$|Except for the partly <b>at-grade</b> Bishan MRT Station (North South Line), the {{entirety}} of the MRT is elevated or underground. Most below-ground stations are deep and hardened enough to withstand conventional aerial bomb attacks and to serve as bomb shelters. Mobile phone and 3G service is available in every part of the network. Underground stations and the trains themselves are air-conditioned, while above-ground stations have ceiling fans installed.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, {{intersection}} of Highway 33 and Prince Edward County Road 1 (Scoharie Road) near Picton saw {{the introduction of}} a traffic roundabout, the first ever constructed on a provincial highway in the province, to replace the <b>at-grade</b> intersection. The MTO felt that the area had reached its operational threshold due to high tourist and recreational activity, particularly during the busy summer months, and so felt a traffic roundabout was needed.|$|E
5|$|NY598 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY5 (Erie Boulevard) east of downtown Syracuse. The route heads north as the four-lane South Midler Avenue, crossing a CSX Transportation-owned railroad spur {{known as the}} Peat Street Runner <b>at-grade</b> ahead of an interchange with I-690 (exit15) at {{the southern edge of}} the Eastwood neighborhood. North of I-690, the route narrows to two lanes as it travels through the densely populated residential neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|On 16 April 2012, an {{intersection}} with Dunreath Drive was opened. This traffic light controlled <b>at-grade</b> intersection allowed {{access to and}} from the international terminal of Perth Airport, bypassing Tonkin Highway's intersections with Leach Highway and Kewdale Road/Horrie Miller Drive. The intersection was later removed on 16 July 2015 upon the commissioning of two nearby interchanges as part of Gateway WA.|$|E
5|$|Othello is a {{light rail}} station located in Seattle, Washington. It is {{situated}} between the Rainier Beach and Columbia City stations on the Central Link line, which runs from Seattle–Tacoma International Airport to Downtown Seattle and the University of Washington {{as part of the}} Link light rail system. The station consists of two <b>at-grade</b> side platforms between South Othello Street and South Myrtle Street in the median of Martin Luther King Jr. Way South in the NewHolly neighborhood, part of Seattle's Rainier Valley.|$|E
5|$|Rainier Beach station {{consists}} of a single, <b>at-grade</b> island platform in the median of Martin Luther King Jr. Way South {{on the south side}} of South Henderson Street. The station has a single entrance at Henderson, accessible via two crosswalks. A small plaza on the northeast corner of the intersection has seating, 20 bicycle lockers, a bus stop, and public art. Rainier Beach station, like others in the Rainier Valley, was designed by architecture firm Arai/Jackson.|$|E
5|$|SODO is a {{light rail}} station located in Seattle, Washington. It is {{situated}} between the Beacon Hill and Stadium stations on the Central Link line, which runs from Seattle–Tacoma International Airport to Downtown Seattle and the University of Washington {{as part of the}} Link Light Rail system. The station consists of two <b>at-grade</b> side platforms at the intersection of the SODO Busway and South Lander Street in the SoDo neighborhood of Seattle.|$|E
5|$|Since 1953, {{many changes}} have {{occurred}} to Route 70. Several traffic circles that had existed on the road had been either modified or replaced by <b>at-grade</b> intersections. The Marlton Circle at Route 73 in Marlton was modified in 1974 to allow Route 73 to run directly straight through the circle. This circle became known for traffic backups and was replaced with an interchange. Construction on this interchange, which cost $31 million, began in April 2009. In May 2010, the circle was eliminated with a temporary <b>at-grade</b> intersection constructed while the Route 73 bridge over Route 70 was being built. The interchange was completed in June 2011. Also, the Race Track Circle at the intersection with CR 644 (Haddonfield Road) was eventually replaced by an <b>at-grade</b> intersection. The Laurelton Circle at Route 88, built in 1937, {{was replaced by the}} 1990s. The Ellisburg Circle at Route 41 and Route 154, was replaced by an intersection with jughandles. The Brielle Circle at the eastern terminus was also converted to an intersection with jughandles in 2001. In conjunction with eliminating the Brielle Circle, Route 70 was also widened between the intersection with Jack Martin Boulevard in Brick Township and the former circle. In July 2004, floods caused by heavy rain washed away a bridge along the route in Southampton Township, leading for it to be replaced. The New Jersey Department of Transportation replaced the September 11th Memorial Bridge over the Manasquan River in a $52 million project that increased capacity on the bridge and added monumental decorations and increased pedestrian access. Construction was scheduled to be complete in December 2010; however, the project was completed ahead of schedule in September 2008.|$|E
5|$|Stadium is a {{light rail}} station located in Seattle, Washington. It is {{situated}} between the SODO and International District/Chinatown stations on the Central Link line, which runs from Seattle–Tacoma International Airport to Downtown Seattle and the University of Washington {{as part of the}} Link light rail system. The station consists of an <b>at-grade</b> island platform at the intersection of the SODO Busway and South Royal Brougham Way in the SODO neighborhood of Seattle, adjacent to CenturyLink Field and Safeco Field.|$|E
5|$|There Business 80 splits to the north, SR 99 heads south, and US 50 {{continues}} east as the Lincoln Highway. This freeway parallels Folsom Boulevard and the American River east-northeasterly {{through the}} suburb of Rancho Cordova to Folsom. Entering El Dorado, US 50 continues eastward through {{the foothills of}} the Sierra Nevada via El Dorado Hills, Cameron Park, and Shingle Springs to downtown Placerville. The freeway ends, and US 50 has several <b>at-grade</b> intersections in Placerville, including SR 49.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the road}} was {{originally}} {{designed to be a}} freeway, budget limitations precluded the construction of overpasses; apart from the interchanges with Highway401, Laird Road, and Wellington Street West (Highway7 and former Highway24), all junctions are <b>at-grade</b> intersections. There are also two railway crossings near the northern terminus, though both are for spur lines. The Hanlon is graded and landscaped similarly to a freeway, with broad flat shoulders and an open median.|$|E
5|$|A modern {{light rail}} system was {{proposed}} by the newly-formed Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority (RTA) in 1995, including a line running through the Rainier Valley with a stop at South Othello Street. After the $6.7billion proposal was rejected by voters in March 1995, the RTA considered building a shorter elevated line on Rainier Avenue, including an option beginning at Columbia City, {{to the north of}} Othello, and ending in the University District. In November 1996, a condensed $3.9billion regional transit plan was approved by voters, including a light rail line between Seattle and Sea-Tac Airport running through the Rainier Valley, with an <b>at-grade</b> station on Martin Luther King Jr. Way South at South Othello Street.|$|E
5|$|About 40% of {{the subway}} system runs on surface or {{elevated}} tracks, including steel or cast iron elevated structures, concrete viaducts, embankments, open cuts and surface routes. All of these construction methods are completely grade-separated from road and pedestrian crossings, and most crossings of two subway tracks are grade-separated with flying junctions. The sole exceptions of <b>at-grade</b> junctions of two lines in regular service are the 142nd Street junction, the Rogers junction and the Myrtle Avenue junction, whose tracks both intersect at the same level.|$|E
5|$|After NY448, NY117 {{becomes a}} four-lane, {{undivided}} <b>at-grade</b> street as it heads northeast through a residential area of Mount Pleasant. Just past the NY448 junction, NY117 enters adjacent interchanges with Saw Mill River Road (NY9A and NY100) and the northbound {{direction of the}} Taconic State Parkway near Graham Hills County Park. From here, the highway passes south of Pace University's Pleasantville campus on {{its way into the}} village of Pleasantville, where it narrows to two lanes and initially serves mostly commercial neighborhoods. NY117 remains on Bedford Road for its first few blocks in Pleasantville; however, it veers northeast onto Manville Road just southwest of the community's central business district.|$|E
5|$|All {{intersection}}s found {{along the}} route are grade separated, except for a single <b>at-grade</b> intersection currently regulated by traffic lights; a new route is planned to bypass this intersection. As of June 2012, there were tenexits and twoservice areas {{along the route}}. The motorway is currently toll-free except for the Učka Tunnel and the Kanfanar-Rogovići section. However, most of the motorway is potentially a toll road using a ticket system, with each exit including a toll plaza except those of Veprinac, Opatija, and Matulji. The toll system of the A8/A9 Istrian Y is integrated: no ticket needs to be turned in, gotten, or exchanged when going from the A8 to the A9 or vice versa.|$|E
5|$|As {{initially}} envisioned, the Hanlon Expressway will be {{upgraded to}} a controlled-access highway by removing all existing <b>at-grade</b> intersections {{and improving the}} highway to 400-series standards. Planning for this work initially {{began in the early}} 1990s with the EA for the section north of the Speed River, which resulted {{in the construction of the}} Wellington Street interchange. The EA for the section south of the Speed River began in early 2007. The Laird Road interchange and associated closing of the Clair Road intersection were the first projects completed as part of this work.|$|E
5|$|Columbia City is a {{light rail}} station located in Seattle, Washington. It is {{situated}} between the Othello and Mount Baker stations on the Central Link line, which runs from Seattle–Tacoma International Airport to Downtown Seattle and the University of Washington {{as part of the}} Link light rail system. The station consists of two <b>at-grade</b> side platforms between South Alaska Street and South Edmunds Street in the median of Martin Luther King Jr. Way South in the Columbia City neighborhood, part of Seattle's Rainier Valley.|$|E
5|$|Columbia City station {{consists}} of two <b>at-grade</b> side platforms in the median of Martin Luther King Jr. Way between Edmunds and Alaska streets. The station is accessible from crosswalks at both streets, with the platforms running the entire length between the two. At both of the station's entrances are ticket vending machines and an ORCA card reader; beyond that lies the partially covered platform and waiting area, which includes seating and public art. The station, like others in the Rainier Valley, was designed by architecture firm Arai/Jackson, and incorporates references to Craftsman-style homes that populate the neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|Conn. M-13 {{starts at}} exit164 along I-75/US23 north of Bay City. At the {{interchange}} that marks its southern terminus, the connector route continues {{to the north}} while the main I-75 freeway turns northwesterly. About three-quarters of a mile (1.2km) north, there is an interchange for Wilder Road. Traffic running southbound on the connector that wishes to continue northbound on I-75/US23 has to use Wilder Road to connect to the latter freeway. The connector route is bordered by fields and residential subdivisions as it continues north to the community of Kawkawlin. The freeway ends at an <b>at-grade</b> intersection with M-13.|$|E
5|$|Construction of Stadium Station {{began with}} the laying of the first rails for Central Link, between Holgate and Lander streets, in August 2005. The station itself was built by Kiewit Pacific {{in less than a}} year, with opening ceremonies for Stadium and SODO {{stations}} held on May 30, 2006, celebrating the completion of the first two Central Link stations. Light rail testing on the , <b>at-grade</b> SoDo segment began in March 2007, and ended in February 2008. Regular Link service from Seattle to Tukwila began on July 18, 2009, including the use of its pocket track to store extra trains serving a sellout friendly match between the Seattle Sounders and Chelsea at CenturyLink Field.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, the Department of Transportation {{looked into}} the {{expansion}} of NY347 and NY454. The studies suggested that the state would add one additional traffic lane in each direction, giving most of the highway six lanes with eight travel lanes along the concurrency in Hauppauge. The new lanes would also be capable of holding rapid-commute vehicles for the Long Island Rapid Commute. The interchange where Routes 347 and 454 fork in Hauppague is slated to go from an <b>at-grade</b> fork to a grade-separated interchange. The project, which will cost $359 million (2009 USD) {{was scheduled to be}} completed between 2012 and 2015.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, the {{formation}} of a regional transit authority (RTA) brought light rail planning to the Seattle region. In 1995, the transit authority proposed a regional light rail system to be built by 2010, including an <b>at-grade</b> or underground light rail line through Roosevelt with a station in the neighborhood. The RTA proposal was rejected by voters in March 1995, citing its $6.7 billion price. A smaller, $3.9 billion plan was approved in November 1996, only funding light rail from the University District to Seattle–Tacoma International Airport; an extension north to Northgate via Roosevelt was deferred until additional funding could be secured.|$|E
