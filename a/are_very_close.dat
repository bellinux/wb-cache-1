5|$|As {{it passed}} {{perihelion}} on April 1, 1997 the comet {{developed into a}} spectacular sight. It shone brighter than any star in the sky except Sirius, and its dust tail stretched 40–45 degrees across the sky. The comet was visible well before the sky got fully dark each night, and while many great comets <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> to the Sun as they pass perihelion, comet Hale–Bopp was visible all night to northern hemisphere observers.|$|E
5|$|Histological {{analysis}} of the lines of arrested growth within the tibiae from the various ontogenetic stages of Limusaurus indicates that the animal was skeletally mature at six years in age. In older specimens, the outermost lines of arrested growth <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> together (forming {{what is known as}} the external fundamental system), indicating that rapid growth had ceased in these particular individuals.|$|E
5|$|House {{prices in}} Arbroath <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> to the {{national}} average and in April–June 2006 were £99 below the national average, local prices averaging £113,646 compared {{to the national}} average of £113,745. The average house price across Angus has risen by 14.9% in the past year (to November 2006) and now stands at £124,451. Angus Council suggests the recent upgrading of the A92 between Arbroath and Dundee to dual carriageway has lured Dundonians to Arbroath and this may be driving up house prices.|$|E

5|$|Most large {{objects in}} orbit around the Sun lie near the plane of Earth's orbit, known as the ecliptic. The planets <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> to the ecliptic, whereas comets and Kuiper belt objects are {{frequently}} at significantly greater angles to it. All the planets, and most other objects, orbit the Sun {{in the same direction}} that the Sun is rotating (counter-clockwise, as viewed from above Earth's north pole). There are exceptions, such as Halley's Comet.|$|E

5|$|Use of an {{automated}} external defibrillator on a patient in a metal underwire bra can cause burns, and the bra should be removed by the first responder before the AED is applied. In their 2007 season, the television program MythBusters tested the possibility of burns resulting from using a defibrillator on a patient who is using an underwire bra, and concluded that while it is possible, {{it is not likely}} unless the metal underwire is exposed and paddles of the defibrillator <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> to it.|$|E

5|$|During {{the process}} of meiotic cell division, an event called genetic {{recombination}} or crossing-over can sometimes occur, in which a length of DNA on one chromatid is swapped with a length of DNA on the corresponding homologous non-sister chromatid. This can result in reassortment of otherwise linked alleles. The Mendelian principle of independent assortment asserts that each of a parent's two genes for each trait will sort independently into gametes; which allele an organism inherits for one trait is unrelated to which allele it inherits for another trait. This is in fact only true for genes that do not reside on the same chromosome, or are located very far from one another on the same chromosome. The closer two genes lie on the same chromosome, the more closely they will be associated in gametes and the more often they will appear together; genes that <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> are essentially never separated because it is extremely unlikely that a crossover point will occur between them. This is known as genetic linkage.|$|E
5|$|A thorium atom has 90 electrons, {{of which}} four are valence electrons. Three atomic orbitals are {{theoretically}} {{available for the}} valence electrons to occupy: 5f, 6d, and 7s. Despite thorium's position in the f-block of the periodic table, it has an anomalous 6d27s2 electron configuration in the ground state, as the 5f and 6d subshells in the early actinides <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> in energy, {{even more so than}} the 4f and 5d subshells of the lanthanides: thorium's 6d subshells are lower in energy than its 5f subshells, because its 5f subshells are not well-shielded by the filled 6s and 6p subshells and are destabilised. Such unusual behaviour is due to relativistic effects, which become stronger {{near the bottom of the}} periodic table, specifically the relativistic spin–orbit interaction. The closeness in energy levels of the 5f, 6d, and 7s energy levels of thorium result in thorium almost always losing all four valence electrons and occurring in its highest possible oxidation state of +4. This is different from its lanthanide congener cerium, for which +4 is the highest possible state but +3 also plays an important role and is more stable. Thorium is much more similar to the transition metals zirconium and hafnium than to cerium in its properties such as ionisation energies and redox potentials, and hence also in its chemistry: this transition-metal-like behaviour is the norm in the first half of the actinide series.|$|E
5|$|VV Corvi {{is a close}} spectroscopic binary, its two {{component}} stars orbiting {{each other}} with a period of 1.46 days. Both are yellow-white main-sequence stars of spectral type F5V, though the primary has begun expanding and cooling as it nears the end of its time on the main sequence. The mass ratio of the two stars is 0.775 ± 0.024. A tertiary companion was discovered during the Two Micron All-Sky Survey. W Corvi is an eclipsing binary that varies in brightness from apparent magnitude 11.16 to 12.5 over 9 hours. Its period has increased by 1/4 second over a century. It is an unusual system in that its two stars <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> to each other yet have different surface temperatures, and hence thermal transfer is not taking place as expected. SX Corvi is an eclipsing binary that is also a contact binary known as a W Ursae Majoris variable. The two component stars orbit closely enough to each other for mass to have been transferred between them—in this case the secondary having transferred a large amount of mass to the primary. RV Corvi is another eclipsing binary. Its brightness varies from apparent magnitude 8.6 to 9.16 over 18 hours. The system is composed of stars of spectral types F0 and G0, which orbit each other every 0.7473 days.|$|E
