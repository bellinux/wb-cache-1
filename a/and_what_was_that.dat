6000|$|... "I couldn't {{keep this}} to myself {{if you were}} my own brother. Four men held in your {{district}} -four or forty at Peshawur - <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> you said about Multan?" ...|$|E
6000|$|My uncles, to whom my poor mother's fortune reverted, {{would not}} touch it, and gave every bit back to us; {{but it was}} only 10,000 pounds, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> among the four of us? ...|$|E
60|$|Steak, and potatoes, {{and green}} things how fresh it all was! <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>that?</b> Squares of honey, {{streaming}} liquid amber! But {{why did they}} bring so much? Ha! ha! he could never eat it all.|$|E
6000|$|... "What news, Abijah?" [...] Mrs. Mulready asked quickly. [...] "What are {{you making}} a mystery about, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> paper in your hand?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But,' {{answered}} he, 'let a man be ever so strong, he cannot {{carry more}} than a hundredweight, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> for a king's daughter?' ...|$|R
6000|$|A workman {{brought up}} another candle from the vault, and {{prepared}} to let down the slab. 'Well, Mr. Power, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> one thing?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I mean haven't {{you a lot}} of money?" [...] He didn't care {{now that}} it was out; his cup was in his hand, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> but proved interest? He had succumbed to the social relation.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am frightened. I do {{not like}} this business, Miss Ogilvy. Who <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> lady in white, who stood by me and held my hand? My fingers are still tingling, and a cold wind seems to blow upon me." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> but the Word of the Lord Himself {{speaking}} to our hearts, and saying to us: [...] "Do not defile yourselves with their idols; do not hurt your souls by hunting after the things which they loved {{better than they}} loved Me: money, pleasure, drink, fighting, smuggling, poaching, wantonness, and lust; I am the Lord your God?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>that?</b> <b>What</b> <b>is</b> the name, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> the character, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> the temper of him who inhabits eternity? Look on the cross, and see.|$|R
6000|$|Will, {{starting}} to his feet, moved backward a step, frowning, and saying with some fierceness, [...] "Yes, sir, it <b>was.</b> <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> to you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|But what a {{beautiful}} place it is! Flowers and woods and a lawn; <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> great smooth patch in the lawn just under the window? ...|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Like? What was Christ Like? What was his Spirit Like? It was a Spirit of Love, mercy, pity, generosity, usefulness, unselfishness. A {{spirit of}} truth, honour, fearless love {{of what was}} right: a spirit of duty and willing obedience, which made Him rejoice in doing His Father's will. In all things {{the spirit of a}} perfect SON, in all things a lovely, noble, holy spirit.|$|E
6000|$|... "My own heart? I will, Madam"--said Pierre, {{now looking}} up steadfastly; [...] "but {{what do you}} think, Mr. Falsgrave?" [...] letting his glance drop again--"should the one shun the other; should the one refuse his highest sympathy and perfect love for the other, {{especially}} if that other be deserted by {{all the rest of}} the world? What think you would have been our blessed Savior's thoughts on such a matter? <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he so mildly said to the adulteress?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, indeed, and forsooth," [...] she said, [...] "her {{house was}} Liberty Hall; and so should every publican's be. What {{was it to}} her what gentlefolks ate or drank, {{providing}} they paid for it honestly? There were many honest gentlemen, whose stomachs could not abide bacon, grease, or dripping, especially on a Friday; <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> to her, or any one in her line, so gentlefolks paid honestly for the trouble? Only, she would say, that her bacon and eggs could not be mended betwixt this and Liverpool, {{and that she would}} live and die upon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is," [...] said Psmith, [...] "your boot. <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{red stain}} across the toe? Is it blood? No, 'tis not blood. It is red paint." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, citizeness," [...] Chauvelin rejoined quietly, [...] "why don't you proceed? That awful house, you <b>were</b> saying. Where <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> awful {{house of}} which you speak?" ...|$|R

6000|$|Lieut. D'Hubert whistled softly. Madame de Lionne was {{the wife}} of a high {{official}} who had a well-known salon and some pretensions to sensibility and elegance. The husband was a civilian, and old; but the society of the salon was young and military. Lieut. D'Hubert had whistled, not because the idea of pursuing Lieut. Feraud into that very salon was disagreeable to him, but because, having arrived in Strasbourg only lately, he had not had the time as yet to get an introduction to Madame de Lionne. <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> swashbuckler Feraud doing there, he wondered. He did not seem the sort of man who-- ...|$|E
6000|$|That man, that [...] "good pen," [...] was Ben Jonson. On the [...] "supposing" [...] of Mr. Greenwood, Ben is [...] "doing work for" [...] the Great Unknown at {{the time}} when [...] "the business" [...] {{following}} on the [...] "idea of publishing a collected edition of the plays which had been written under the name of Shakespeare" [...] occurred to the illustrious but unknown owner of that [...] "nom de plume." [...] In plain words of my own,--the Author may have entrusted [...] "the business," [...] <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> business if not the editing of the Folio?--to Ben Jonson--"who was {{at the time}} doing work for him"--for the Author.|$|E
60|$|Although the {{reception}} of Lothair by his old friends and by {{the leaders of the}} Roman world was in the highest degree flattering, there was something in its tone which was perplexing to him and ambiguous. Could they be ignorant of his Italian antecedents? Impossible. Miss Arundel had admitted, or rather declared, that he had experienced great trials, and, even temptations. She could only allude to what had occurred since their parting in England. But all this was now looked upon as satisfactory, because it was ordained, and tended to one end; <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> end? His devotion to the Church of Rome, of which they admitted he was not formally a child.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] she {{answered}} in a low voice, and passing her hands before her face. [...] "Only tell me who <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> woman?" [...] <b>and</b> in her turn she looked towards Inez.|$|R
6000|$|Query 11. [...] "Whether {{must not}} the devil be chained before Christ reign, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> which chains him, and whether art thou come {{to one of}} the days of the {{thousand}} years, yea, or no?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, Olfan," [...] asked Leonard, [...] "who {{cut from}} the rock the great statue on which we sat last night, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> reptile we saw when the woman was thrown into the pool of troubled waters?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no! On Madame de Lionne." [...] Lieutenant D'Hubert whistled softly. Madame de Lionne, {{the wife}} of a high official, had a {{well-known}} salon and some pretensions to sensibility and elegance. The husband was a civilian and old, but the society of the salon was young and military for the greater part. Lieutenant D'Hubert had whistled, not because the idea of pursuing Lieutenant Feraud into that very salon was in the least distasteful to him, but because having but lately arrived in Strasbourg he had not the time as yet to get an introduction to Madame de Lionne. <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> swashbuckler Feraud doing there?

60|$|All! In {{the note}} I wrote to Miss Mills, I bitterly quoted this sentiment. All I had to do, I said, with gloomy sarcasm, was to forget Dora. That was all, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>that!</b> I entreated Miss Mills to see me, that evening. If {{it could not}} be done with Mr. Mills's {{sanction}} and concurrence, I besought a clandestine interview in the back kitchen where the Mangle was. I informed her that my reason was tottering on its throne, and only she, Miss Mills, could prevent its being deposed. I signed myself, hers distractedly; and I couldn't help feeling, while I read this composition over, before sending it by a porter, that it was something in the style of Mr. Micawber.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{which had}} made them {{different}} from the mean, the savage, the drunken, the profligate beings around them? This at least. That they were of those of whom it is written, 'Let him that is athirst come.' They had been athirst for Life. They had had instincts and longings; very simple and humble, but very pure and noble. At times, it may be, they had been unfaithful to those instincts. At times, it may be, they had fallen. They had said 'Why should I not do like the rest, and be a savage? Let me eat and drink, for to-morrow I die;' and they had cast themselves down into sin, for very weariness and heaviness, and were for a while as the beasts which have no law.|$|E
5000|$|Based on {{the classic}} studies {{outlining}} the LRP and some more recent applications of studying cognitive psychology with the LRP, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> the LRP functionally sensitive to? What modulates its amplitude <b>and</b> latency, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> inferred to mean? ...|$|R
6000|$|Query 2. [...] "Whether {{will that}} faith justify a man which hath not works, seeing the scripture, or the Apostle saith, faith without works <b>is</b> dead; <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> which worketh faith; {{and where is}} it, within, or without?" ...|$|R
2500|$|But <b>what</b> then <b>am</b> I? A {{thinking}} thing. <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>that?</b> Something that doubts, understands, affirms, denies, wills, refuses, {{and also}} senses and has mental images. [...] (Descartes, Meditation II: On the Nature of the Human Mind, Which Is Better Known Than the Body).|$|R
60|$|I do {{not think}} we shall escape it, if we stop short at the text. We must go on from the Old Testament and let the New explain it. We must believe what Moses tells us: but we must ask St. John to show us more than Moses saw. Moses tells us that God created the heavens and the earth; St. John goes further, and tells us what that God is like; how he saw Christ, the Word of God, by whom all things were made, and without whom nothing was made that is made. And what was he like? He was the {{brightness}} of his Father's glory, and the express image of his person. <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> like? was there any darkness in him--meanness, grudging, cruelty, changeableness, deceit? No. He was full of grace and truth. Grace and truth: that is what Christ is; and therefore that is what God is.|$|E
60|$|What {{was to be}} done? The arm of {{stagnant}} water lay near to us, {{but we had no}} boat with which to cross to the further shore. <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> shore? A cave where a creature who seemed to be but half-human, sat watching like a spider in its web. Do not let it be supposed that this question of escape had been absent from our minds. On the contrary, we had even thought of trying to drag the canoe in which we crossed to and from the island of the Flower through the forest. The idea was abandoned, however, because we found that being hollowed from a single log with a bottom four or five inches thick, it was impossible for us to carry it so much as fifty yards. What then could we do without a boat? Swimming seemed {{to be out of the}} question because of the crocodiles. Also on inquiry I discovered that of the whole party Stephen and I alone could swim. Further there was no wood of which to make a raft.|$|E
6000|$|... (1.) We received, by our thus being {{counted in}} him, that benefit which did precede his {{rising from the}} dead; <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> but the {{forgiveness}} of sins? For this stands clear to reason, that if Christ had our sins charged upon him at his death, he then must be discharged of {{them in order to}} his resurrection. Now, though it is not proper to say they were forgiven to him, because they were purged from him by merit; yet they may be said to be forgiven us, because we receive this benefit by grace. And this, I say, was done precedent to his resurrection from the dead. 'He hath quickened us together with him, HAVING forgiven us all trespasses.' He could not be 'quickened' till we were 'discharged'; because it was not for himself, but for us, that he died. Hence we are said to be at that time, as to our own personal estate, dead in our sins, even when we are 'quickened together with him' (Col 2:13).|$|E
6000|$|... "Halloa, friend," [...] cried Robin, {{coming forward}} at last, [...] "who art thou <b>that</b> sittest there? <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> that thou hast upon thy body? I make my vow I ha' {{never seen such}} a sight in all my life before. Had I done an evil thing, or did my {{conscience}} trouble me, I would be afraid of thee, thinking that thou wast someone from down below bringing a message bidding me come straightway to King Nicholas." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I see {{the grass}} shake {{in the sun}} for leagues on either hand, I see a river loop and run about a {{treeless}} land-- An empty plain, a steely pond, a distance diamond-clear, And low blue naked hills beyond. <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> to fear?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Greeting, Macumazahn," [...] he said, [...] "you who {{are white}} and wise and I am black and a fighter have seen many strange things beneath the sun, but never such a one {{as we have}} looked upon to-night. Who <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> chieftainess, Macumazahn?" ...|$|R
