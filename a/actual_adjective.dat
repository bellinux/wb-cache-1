It is inflected as a regular adjective, but without definite forms, since it is never used as an <b>actual</b> <b>adjective,</b> but only in certain verbal constructions (see the endings).|$|E
5000|$|The term {{adjectival}} {{phrase is}} sometimes {{used instead of}} adjective phrase. However, there is tendency to call a phrase an adjectival phrase {{in such a case}} where that phrase is functioning like an adjective phrase would, but does not contain an <b>actual</b> <b>adjective.</b> For example, in Mr Clinton is a man of wealth, the prepositional phrase of wealth modifies a man the way an adjective would, and it could be reworded with an adjective, e.g. Mr Clinton is a wealthy man. Similarly, that boy is friendless (the adjective [...] "friendless" [...] modifies the noun [...] "boy") and That boy is without a friend (a prepositional phrase where [...] "without a friend" [...] modifies [...] "boy").|$|E
50|$|Many of {{the main}} {{features}} of Bemba grammar are fairly typical of Bantu languages: it is agglutinative, depends mainly on prefixes, has a system of several noun classes, a large set of verbal aspects and tenses, very few <b>actual</b> <b>adjectives,</b> and, like English, uses subject-verb-object word order. Most of the classification here is taken from that given by Schoeffer, Sheane and Cornwallis.|$|R
