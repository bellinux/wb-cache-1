The Shankodi-Jangwa coal sample had the highest sulphur content of 1.63 %, which is above the maximum acceptable limit of 1.5 % to 1.60 %[17]. High sulphur must be reduced during iron and steel making either by modifying the blast furnace burden with a consequence reduction in iron output or by external desulphurizing technique which are both money- and time-consuming[17]. Even though sulphur contributes to the heating value of coal, on combustion, it produces acids of sulphur dioxide (SO 2) and sulphur trioxide (SO 3) which corrode the equipment and also cause <b>atmospheric</b> pollution. <b>Sulphur</b> also affects clinkering and slagging tendencies in boilers, corrodes chimneys and other equipment such as air heaters and economizers and limits flue gas exit temperature. The sulphur contents of both Tai and Garin Maiganga coal samples are within the acceptable limit; they may be suitable for smokeless fuel production, heating of residential buildings, firing kiln for cement production, raising steam for power generation and in foundry coke production.|$|R

40|$|The hemispheric {{impact of}} {{industrial}} emissions upon <b>atmospheric</b> <b>sulphur</b> loading {{is reflected in}} the sulphur depositional history recorded in cores from ice sheets. However, these do not reveal regional variations. Recently deposited speleothems are used here as archives of regional sulphur depositional history at two locations within the United Kingdom and Ireland. δ 34 S-so 4 and δ 18 O-so 4 present within speleothem carbonate are measured {{for the first time as}} part of a dual isotope approach to decode the speleothem sulphur record. The largely refractory nature of δ 34 S-so 4 under oxidising conditions enables source provenance of atmospheric SO 2, whereas the complex cycles of isotopic exchange and fractionation during incorporation of oxygen into sulphate molecules enable δ 18 O-so 4 signatures to yield insights into ambient environmental conditions and biogeochemical cycling in the ecosystem above the cave. δ 34 S-so 4 values extracted from speleothem carbonate formed within Browns Folly Mine, UK, range from + 3. 5 to + 5. 5 ‰ and δ 18 O-so 4 + 10. 3 to + 13. 7 ‰. Both signatures lie within the range expected from sulphate deposition in industrial locations and reflect the transfer of sulphate into speleothem calcite with little fractionation. However, δ 18 O-so 4 signatures at Crag Cave, western Ireland, are isotopically heavier than expected and approach isotopic equilibrium with δ 18 O-h 2 o under reducing conditions. Dual isotope analysis of δ 34 S-so 4 and δ 18 O-so 4 optimises the correct identification of sulphur sources and biogeochemical cycling prior to incorporation into the speleothem record.

In remote marine air, mean winter, spring and summer aerosol phase concentrations (ng m− 3) were, respectively, non-sea-salt sulphate (NSSS) = 115, 139 and 187, methanesulphonate (MSA) = 1. 5, 23 and 48, nitrate (NOD = 293, 70 and 84, and ammonium (NH 4 +) = 44, 39 and 59. Mean gas phase concentrations were sulphur dioxide (SO 2 −) = 39, 39 and 30, nitric acid (HNO 3) = 18, 30 and 27 and ammonia (NH 3) = 74, 42 and 31.

Despite the observed reduction in the <b>sulphur</b> <b>atmospheric</b> deposition, the reference lakes showed no corresponding decline in sulphate concentrations, but a marked increase in the acid neutralising capacity was apparent. Changes of the seasonal distribution pattern of the precipitation amounts and a general increase of the air temperature have likely produced an increased weathering which increased the concentration of many inlake solutes and drove the lakes toward more buffered conditions.

Most of the lakes studied are located above the timberline and a great effort centred on the creation and analysis of a data-sets of sedimentary records. A chronology for the last century was based on radiometric techniques (210 Pb, 241 Am 137 Cs). The accumulation rate of recent sediment was found to vary from 0. 041 cm y- 1 (Lake Saanajärvi, Finland) to 0. 14 cm y- 1 (Jezero v Ledvici, Slovenia). During the time-span represented by the cores were the major changes in organic carbon and nitrogen in Nižné Terianske Pleso (Slovakia), Redó (Spain) and Gossenköllesee (Austria). Constant increase of these nutrients from AD 1900 onwards was shown in lakes Saanajärvi, Nižné Terianske Pleso and Hagelseewli (Switzerland). No common trends in sulphur concentrations was evident. There is evidence of an <b>atmospheric</b> input of <b>sulphur</b> in Hagelseewli. This lake shows the highest concentrations, 10 fold higher at surface than the other lakes (ca 6 % d. m.). A decrease of S during very recent times is clearly shown by the cores from Redò and Hagelseewli: this might be related to the reduction in the atmospheric loading (the matching of the <b>atmospheric</b> and sedimentary <b>sulphur</b> trends favours this hypothesis). Concentrations of total pigments and HPLC single carotenoids and chlorophylls showed marked fluctuations throughout the cores of all lakes. High pre-AD 1800 pigment concentrations were detected in Nižné Terianske Pleso, Redó, Hagelseewli and Gossenköllesee.

Elevated carbon dioxide emissions also contributed to the greenhouse effect, causing warmer weather that lasted long after the atmospheric shroud of dust and aerosols had cleared. Further climatic changes 20 million years ago, long after India had crashed into the Laurasian landmass, were severe enough to cause the extinction of many endemic Indian forms. The formation of the Himalayas resulted in blockage of frigid Central Asian air, preventing it from reaching India; this made its climate significantly warmer and more tropical in character than it would otherwise have been.|$|R
40|$|The air-sea {{exchange}} {{is one of}} the main mechanisms maintaining the abundances of trace gases in the atmosphere. Some of these, such as carbon dioxide and dimethyl sulphide (DMS), will have a bearing on the atmospheric heat budget. While the former facilitates the trapping of radiation (greenhouse effect) the latter works in the opposite direction through reflectance of radiation back into space by sulphate aerosols that form from oxidation of DMS in atmosphere. Here we report on the first measurements made on DMS in the Bay of Bengal and the factors regulating its abundance in seawater. Phytoplankton alone does not seem to control the extent of DMS concentrations. We find that changes in salinity could effectively regulate the extent of DMSP production by marine phytoplankton. In addition, we provide the first ever evidence to the occurrence of DMS precursor, DMSP, in marine aerosols collected in the boundary layer. This suggests that the marine aerosol transport of DMSP will supplement DMS gaseous evasion in maintaining the <b>atmospheric</b> non-sea salt <b>sulphur</b> budget. 1...|$|R

Coconut palm (Cocos nucifera L.) was selected as the test crop since it dominates the tree crops in the area. Chemical analysis of leaves and nuts were made to assess the extent of damage caused by sulphur dioxide pollution. Samples were taken from five radial distances of 250, 500, 1000, 1500 and 2000 m from the factory. Control samples from palms of the same age were collected at a distance of 5000 m from the same radii.

Sulphate sulphur also showed marked increase upto 500 m from the pollution source. The nitrogen content of palms at a distance of 1 km from the factory was significantly lower compared to the control palms whereas phosphorus and potassium contents were markedly reduced up to 2 km.
