5|$|<b>Anaerobic,</b> Gram-negative {{rod-shaped}} bacteria, {{including some}} Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, and Prevotella, although resistance is increasing in Bacteroides fragilis.|$|E
5|$|Biogas, or {{landfill}} gas, is a biofuel produced {{through the}} intermediary stage of <b>anaerobic</b> digestion consisting mainly of 45–90% biologically produced methane and carbon dioxide. In early 2007 a thermophilic <b>anaerobic</b> digestion facility was commissioned in Stornoway in the Western Isles. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and the Renewable Energy Association are also {{leading the way}} towards {{the establishment of a}} digestate standard to facilitate the use of solid outputs from digesters on land. <b>Anaerobic</b> digestion and mechanical biological treatment facilities have been planned at a number of other locations in Scotland, such as Westray.|$|E
5|$|Clindamycin is used {{primarily}} to treat <b>anaerobic</b> infections caused by susceptible <b>anaerobic</b> bacteria, including dental infections, and infections of the respiratory tract, skin, and soft tissue, and peritonitis. In people with hypersensitivity to penicillins, clindamycin {{may be used}} to treat infections caused by susceptible aerobic bacteria, as well. It is also used to treat bone and joint infections, particularly those caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Topical application of clindamycin phosphate can be used to treat mild to moderate acne.|$|E
5|$|The {{spreading}} {{of organisms}} is facilitated when risk factors are present. Alcoholism {{is associated with}} Streptococcus pneumoniae, <b>anaerobic</b> organisms, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis; smoking facilitates the effects of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Legionella pneumophila. Exposure to birds is associated with Chlamydia psittaci; farm animals with Coxiella burnetti; aspiration of stomach contents with <b>anaerobic</b> organisms; and cystic fibrosis with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Streptococcus pneumoniae {{is more common in}} the winter, and should be suspected in persons aspirating a large amount of <b>anaerobic</b> organisms.|$|E
5|$|This process {{occurs during}} the <b>anaerobic</b> {{corrosion}} {{of iron and}} steel in oxygen-free groundwater and in reducing soils below the water table.|$|E
5|$|This {{reaction}} {{closely resembles}} the Schikorr reaction {{observed in the}} <b>anaerobic</b> oxidation of the ferrous hydroxide in contact with water.|$|E
5|$|Until the {{discovery}} of <b>anaerobic</b> metazoa, oxygen {{was thought to be}} a requirement for all complex life.|$|E
5|$|Cholangitis {{requires}} {{admission to}} hospital. Intravenous fluids are administered, {{especially if the}} blood pressure is low, and antibiotics are commenced. Empirical treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics is usually necessary until it is known for certain which pathogen is causing the infection, and to which antibiotics it is sensitive. Combinations of penicillins and aminoglycosides are widely used, although ciprofloxacin {{has been shown to}} be effective in most cases, and may be preferred to aminoglycosides because of fewer side effects. Metronidazole is often added to specifically treat the <b>anaerobic</b> pathogens, especially in those who are very ill or at risk of <b>anaerobic</b> infections. Antibiotics are continued for 7–10days. Drugs that increase the blood pressure (vasopressors) may also be required to counter the low blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|Concurrently {{with these}} processes, the {{activity}} of mitochondria may be reduced, which causes cells to rely on <b>anaerobic</b> metabolism to produce energy, increasing levels of the byproduct lactate.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, a {{contract}} {{for the construction of}} a mesophilic <b>anaerobic</b> digestion facility was awarded, including the construction of buildings and various other pieces of equipment required for the treatment of sludge. Mesophilic <b>anaerobic</b> digestion enables the breaking down of biodegradable materials using micro-organisms under moderate temperatures. The new sludge treatment facility enables the recycled sludge to be used on neighbouring farmlands as manure, and also enables Yorkshire Water to generate 1.9MW of renewable energy using combined heat and power units.|$|E
5|$|In <b>anaerobic</b> {{protozoa}}, such as Plagiopyla frontata, archaea reside {{inside the}} protozoa and consume hydrogen produced in their hydrogenosomes. Archaea also associate with larger organisms. For example, the marine archaean Cenarchaeum symbiosum lives within (is an endosymbiont of) the sponge Axinella mexicana.|$|E
5|$|In {{the carbon}} cycle, {{methanogen}} archaea remove hydrogen and {{play an important}} role in the decay of organic matter by the populations of microorganisms that act as decomposers in <b>anaerobic</b> ecosystems, such as sediments, marshes and sewage-treatment works.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{recognised}} that biogas (mainly methane) – produced from the <b>anaerobic</b> digestion {{of organic matter}} – is potentially a valuable and prolific feedstock. It is estimated that 0.4 GW of generating capacity might be available from agricultural waste in Scotland. The Scottish Executive and SEPA has funded seven small scale farm trial plants with the British <b>anaerobic</b> digestion company Greenfinch in Southwest Scotland. Landfill sites {{have the potential for}} a further 0.07 GW with sites such as the Avondale Landfill in Falkirk already utilising their potential.|$|E
5|$|Most aerobic Gram-negative {{bacteria}} (such as Pseudomonas, Legionella, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella) {{are resistant}} to clindamycin, as are the facultative <b>anaerobic</b> Enterobacteriaceae. A notable exception is Capnocytophaga canimorsus, for which clindamycin is a first-line drug of choice.|$|E
5|$|Organic matter, {{probably}} {{dominated by}} plankton, also settled to the bottom, but the normal aerobic decay process was inhibited in the <b>anaerobic</b> environment thereby preserving the organic carbon.|$|E
5|$|Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae {{are usually}} {{the main cause of}} PID. Data suggest that PID is often polymicrobial. Isolated anaerobes and facultative {{microorganisms}} have been obtained from the upper genital tract. N. gonorrhoeae has been isolated from fallopian tubes, facultative and <b>anaerobic</b> organisms were recovered from endometrial tissues.|$|E
5|$|E. coli {{can live}} {{on a wide variety}} of {{substrates}} and uses mixed-acid fermentation in <b>anaerobic</b> conditions, producing lactate, succinate, ethanol, acetate, and carbon dioxide. Since many pathways in mixed-acid fermentation produce hydrogen gas, these pathways require the levels of hydrogen to be low, as is the case when E. coli lives together with hydrogen-consuming organisms, such as methanogens or sulphate-reducing bacteria.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the range of applications of archaean enzymes, {{the use of the}} organisms themselves in biotechnology is less developed. Methanogenic archaea are a vital part of sewage treatment, since {{they are part of the}} community of microorganisms that carry out <b>anaerobic</b> digestion and produce biogas. In mineral processing, acidophilic archaea display promise for the extraction of metals from ores, including gold, cobalt and copper.|$|E
5|$|Nests may be {{protected}} from physical threats such as flooding and overheating by elaborate nest architecture. Workers of Cataulacus muticus, an arboreal species that lives in plant hollows, respond to flooding by drinking water inside the nest, and excreting it outside. Camponotus anderseni, which nests in the cavities of wood in mangrove habitats, deals with submergence under water by switching to <b>anaerobic</b> respiration.|$|E
5|$|One well-understood {{example of}} {{mutualism}} is {{the interaction between}} protozoa and methanogenic archaea in the digestive tracts of animals that digest cellulose, such as ruminants and termites. In these <b>anaerobic</b> environments, protozoa break down plant cellulose to obtain energy. This process releases hydrogen as a waste product, but high levels of hydrogen reduce energy production. When methanogens convert hydrogen to methane, protozoa benefit from more energy.|$|E
5|$|Optimum {{growth of}} E. coli occurs at 37°C (98.6°F), but some {{laboratory}} strains can multiply at temperatures up to 49°C (120°F). E. coli {{grows in a}} variety of defined laboratory media, such as lysogeny broth, or any medium that contains glucose, ammonium phosphate, monobasic, sodium chloride, magnesium sulfate, potassium phosphate, dibasic, and water. Growth can be driven by aerobic or <b>anaerobic</b> respiration, using a large variety of redox pairs, including the oxidation of pyruvic acid, formic acid, hydrogen, and amino acids, and the reduction of substrates such as oxygen, nitrate, fumarate, dimethyl sulfoxide, and trimethylamine N-oxide. E. coli is classified as a facultative anaerobe. It uses oxygen when it is present and available. It can, however, continue to grow in the absence of oxygen using fermentation or <b>anaerobic</b> respiration. The ability to continue growing in the absence of oxygen is an advantage to bacteria because their survival is increased in environments where water predominates.|$|E
5|$|Oxidative {{phosphorylation}} (or OXPHOS in short) is {{the metabolic}} pathway in which cells use enzymes to oxidize nutrients, thereby releasing energy {{which is used}} to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In most eukaryotes, this takes place inside mitochondria. Almost all aerobic organisms carry out oxidative phosphorylation. This pathway is probably so pervasive because it is a highly efficient way of releasing energy, compared to alternative fermentation processes such as <b>anaerobic</b> glycolysis.|$|E
5|$|Oxidative sewage {{treatment}} processes rely on microorganisms to oxidise organic constituents. <b>Anaerobic</b> microorganisms reduce sludge solids producing methane gas and a sterile mineralised residue. In potable water treatment, one method, the slow sand filter, employs a complex gelatinous layer {{composed of a}} wide range of microorganisms to remove both dissolved and particulate material from raw water.|$|E
5|$|Sewage {{treatment}} works depend {{for their}} ability to clean up water contaminated with organic material on microorganisms that can respire dissolved substances. Respiration may be aerobic, with a well-oxygenated filter bed such as a slow sand filter. <b>Anaerobic</b> digestion by methanogens generate useful methane gas as a by-product.|$|E
5|$|The Neocallimastigomycota were earlier {{placed in}} the phylum Chytridomycota. Members of this small phylum are <b>anaerobic</b> organisms, living in the {{digestive}} system of larger herbivorous mammals and in other terrestrial and aquatic environments enriched in cellulose (e.g., domestic waste landfill sites). They lack mitochondria but contain hydrogenosomes of mitochondrial origin. As in the related chrytrids, neocallimastigomycetes form zoospores that are posteriorly uniflagellate or polyflagellate.|$|E
25|$|<b>Anaerobic</b> {{digestion}} {{is used as}} part of {{the process}} to treat biodegradable waste and sewage sludge. As part of an integrated waste management system, <b>anaerobic</b> digestion reduces the emission of landfill gas into the atmosphere. <b>Anaerobic</b> digesters can also be fed with purpose-grown energy crops, such as maize.|$|E
25|$|To {{deal with}} {{decreased}} ATP production through the electron transport chain, fish must activate <b>anaerobic</b> means of energy production (see <b>anaerobic</b> metabolism) while suppressing metabolic demands. The ability to decrease energy demand by metabolic suppression {{is essential to}} ensure hypoxic survival due to the limited efficiency of <b>anaerobic</b> ATP production.|$|E
25|$|Some systems {{incorporate}} both <b>anaerobic</b> digestion and composting. This {{may either}} {{take the form}} of a full <b>anaerobic</b> digestion phase, followed by the maturation (composting) of the digestate. Alternatively a partial <b>anaerobic</b> digestion phase can be induced on water that is percolated through the raw waste, dissolving the readily available sugars, with the remaining material being sent to a windrow composting facility.|$|E
25|$|Triclosan favors <b>anaerobic</b> {{conditions}} which is typical in soil and sediment. The antimicrobial properties of Triclosan {{are resistant to}} <b>anaerobic</b> degradation which is the main contributor to its persistence in the environment.|$|E
25|$|<b>Anaerobic</b> {{digestion}} harnesses <b>anaerobic</b> microorganisms {{to break}} down the biodegradable component of the waste to produce biogas and soil improver. The biogas can be used to generate electricity and heat.|$|E
25|$|<b>Anaerobic</b> {{digestion}} is {{a collection}} of processes by which microorganisms break down biodegradable material in the absence of oxygen. The methanogenic archaea populations play an indispensable role in <b>anaerobic</b> wastewater treatments.|$|E
25|$|Oxygen gas or {{ambient air}} {{can also be}} {{injected}} to promote growth of aerobic bacteria which accelerate natural attenuation of organic contaminants. One disadvantage {{of this approach is}} the possibility of decreasing <b>anaerobic</b> contaminant destruction natural attenuation where existing conditions enhance <b>anaerobic</b> bacteria which normally live in the soil prefer a reducing environment. In general though, aerobic activity is much faster than <b>anaerobic</b> and overall destruction rates are typically greater when aerobic activity can be successfully promoted.|$|E
25|$|Denitrification is the {{reduction}} of nitrates back into nitrogen gas (N2), completing the nitrogen cycle. This process is performed by bacterial species such as Pseudomonas and Clostridium in <b>anaerobic</b> conditions. They use the nitrate as an electron acceptor {{in the place of}} oxygen during respiration. These facultatively <b>anaerobic</b> bacteria can also live in aerobic conditions. Denitrification happens in <b>anaerobic</b> conditions e.g. waterlogged soils. The denitrifying bacteria use nitrates in the soil to carry out respiration and consequently produce nitrogen gas, which is inert and unavailable to plants.|$|E
25|$|<b>Anaerobic</b> lagoons {{are heavily}} loaded ponds.|$|E
25|$|The {{conjugate}} base of oxalic acid is the hydrogenoxalate anion, and its {{conjugate base}} (oxalate) is a competitive inhibitor of the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme. LDH catalyses {{the conversion of}} pyruvate to lactic acid (end product of the fermentation (<b>anaerobic)</b> process) oxidising the coenzyme NADH to NAD+ and H+ concurrently. Restoring NAD+ levels {{is essential to the}} continuation of <b>anaerobic</b> energy metabolism through glycolysis. As cancer cells preferentially use <b>anaerobic</b> metabolism (see Warburg effect) inhibition of LDH has been shown to inhibit tumor formation and growth, thus is an interesting potential course of cancer treatment.|$|E
25|$|A biped has {{the ability}} to breathe while running, without strong {{coupling}} to stride cycle. Humans usually take a breath every other stride when their aerobic system is functioning. During a sprint the <b>anaerobic</b> system kicks in and breathing slows until the <b>anaerobic</b> system can no longer sustain a sprint.|$|E
