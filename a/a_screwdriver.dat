5|$|The rifle had {{normally}} {{been used}} to shoot rabbits with the silencer and telescopic sight attached. The court heard that the telescopic sight {{had to be removed}} with <b>a</b> <b>screwdriver,</b> but it was usually left in place because it was time-consuming to realign it. Nevill's nephew visited the farmhouse on the weekend of 26–28 July 1985, and told the court that he had seen the rifle, in the gun cupboard in the ground-floor office, with the sight and silencer attached. He had taken the gun out and used it for target practice.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Schreiber {{remained}} at Los Alamos, {{where he became}} a group leader in the Weapon (W) Division. His first assignment was to ready bombs for the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific. During the preparations, he witnessed the accident in which Louis Slotin was exposed to a fatal dose of neutron radiation when <b>a</b> <b>screwdriver</b> Slotin was using during a criticality experiment {{with one of the}} plutonium pits for Operation Crossroads slipped and the core went critical. Slotin would die from radiation poisoning nine days later but his quick reaction saved the lives of Schreiber and the others in the room (see also: demon core). Schreiber became an exponent of remote handling of dangerous substances, and designed remote-control machines to perform such experiments with all personnel at a quarter-mile distance.|$|E
5|$|The {{frustration}} at #1 Records obstructed sales contributed to tension within the band. There was physical fighting between members: Bell, after being {{punched in the}} face by Hummel, retaliated by smashing Hummel's new bass guitar to pieces against the wall. Hummel took revenge at a later date: finding Bell's acoustic guitar in the latter's unattended car, he repeatedly punched it with <b>a</b> <b>screwdriver.</b> In November 1972, Bell quit the band. When work continued on songs for a second album, Bell rejoined, but further conflict soon erupted. A master tape of the new songs inexplicably went missing, and Bell, whose heavy drug intake was affecting his judgment, attacked Fry's parked car. In late 1972, struggling with severe depression, Bell quit the band once more, {{and by the end}} of the year Big Star disbanded.|$|E

5|$|Ranger's 9-foot {{prototype}} of the product, with plenty of right angles and shiny black Micarta skin, was bulky, imposing, and visually unattractive. Arnold Wolf was called in as the industrial design consultant to this project in early 1957. Wolf, who would later become {{president and chief executive}} of JBL, was initially asked to produce a shell version for dealers' shops. Due to transportation and installation constraints, it was decided that the speaker would be split into three components – the left and right channel enclosures, and the curved radiator panel – that could be easily re-assembled with <b>a</b> <b>screwdriver.</b> To support the weight and prevent deforming, the design called for six feet, of which four are height-adjustable. Instead of producing detailed drawings, Wolf worked with scale models. First, he created a 1:4 model in plastic, after which he made others. He ended with a 1:12 scale model that would show how it could be disassembled and reassembled. During the design phase, the relationship between Wolf and Ranger became very tense, and the project nearly collapsed. The parties came together over the month of June, and agreed on the definitive production specification for the Paragon. This would be a 2-way design.|$|E
25|$|After another arrest, Bakırköy Psychiatric Hospital again {{found him}} to have diminished responsibility. He stayed in a mental {{hospital}} for treatment lasting about one year. Following his release, he continued with his murders. He killed three people and injured two more severely with <b>a</b> <b>screwdriver</b> in Çorlu. Late at night, he went first to the Çorluspor facility, and murdered nightman Hüseyin Yumruk with <b>a</b> <b>screwdriver.</b> Then, he skewered Özcan Karagözoğlu in an industrial zone. Finally, he killed Şakir Temüriçi, whom he met on the street. He threw the bodies in a hole. In the early morning hours, he went in Tonguçlar Mosque, wounded the imam, Salih Baş, in his neck with <b>a</b> <b>screwdriver,</b> and escaped.|$|E
25|$|Abuelazam is also {{suspected}} of having stabbed {{a friend in the}} face with <b>a</b> <b>screwdriver</b> while on a visit to his family in Ramla in early 2010. Police did not pursue the case because the friend refused to press charges.|$|E

25|$|One of the zombie {{units in}} this game is called Dr. Spacetime. The {{character}} makes several references to Doctor Who, including a wardrobe that resembles the TARDIS, <b>a</b> <b>screwdriver</b> referencing the sonic screwdriver, and a scarf and bow tie reminiscent of the Fourth and Second or Eleventh Doctors, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Six tools (a pair of scissors, two knives, <b>a</b> <b>screwdriver,</b> an {{oscillating}} saw and a hammer) {{were recovered}} outside Magnotta's apartment and analysed by ballistics expert Gilbert Desjardins. He said none could be definitively {{linked to the}} killing, and no skeletal marks suggested the screwdriver or scissors were used, but some were consistent with saw and knife or X-Acto blade injuries.|$|E
50|$|Each rifle was {{delivered}} with a sling, a long bayonet, <b>a</b> three-pronged <b>screwdriver,</b> <b>an</b> oil bottle, a cleaning rod, and a muzzle plug to stop moisture {{from getting into}} the barrel. Early muzzle plugs were a short, conical dowel made of wood, but soon a brass cup with a cut out for the front sight replaced it in service.|$|R

25|$|Cunanan next {{drove to}} Chicago and killed 72-year-old Lee Miglin, a {{prominent}} real estate developer, on May 4, 1997. Miglin had been bound {{with duct tape}} {{on his hands and}} feet and wrapped around his head. He was then stabbed over 20 times with <b>a</b> <b>screwdriver</b> and had his throat sawed open with a hacksaw. Following this murder, the FBI added Cunanan to its Ten Most Wanted list.|$|E
25|$|The Contender frame has two firing pins, and a {{selector}} on {{the exposed}} hammer, {{to allow the}} shooter to choose between rimfire or centerfire firing pins, or to select a safety position from which neither firing pin can strike a primer. The initial baseline design of the Contender had no central safe position on the hammer, having only centerfire and rimfire firing pin positions, each being selectable through using <b>a</b> <b>screwdriver.</b>|$|E
25|$|Shake-the-box kits are simple, easy-to-assemble kits; {{a freight}} car might include a {{one-piece}} body, a chassis, trucks, couplers, and a weight, while a structure kit might include walls, windows, doors, and glazing. The name {{derives from the}} joke that no skill was required – you shake the box, and the kit falls together. A common synonym is screwdriver kit as many kits can be assembled with <b>a</b> <b>screwdriver</b> and tweezers.|$|E

25|$|The suspects' {{mobile phones}} and {{personal}} computers contained multiple video {{recordings of the}} murders. A video was leaked to the Internet, showing the murder of 48‑year-old Sergei Yatzenko. He is seen {{lying on his back}} in a wooded area, and is struck repeatedly in the face with a hammer held inside a plastic bag. One attacker stabs Yatzenko in the eye and abdomen with <b>a</b> <b>screwdriver.</b> Yatzenko is then struck with the hammer to ensure he is dead. The attack lasts over four minutes, during which the victim lapses in and out of consciousness. One murderer is seen smiling towards the camera during the video. The murderers walk back to their car, showing that the crime took place close to the side of a road, next to their parked car. They discuss the murder calmly, expressing mild surprise that the victim was still breathing after <b>a</b> <b>screwdriver</b> was plunged into his exposed brain. The suspects then wash their hands and the hammer with a water bottle, and begin to laugh. Only two suspects appear to be present in the video, with one always behind the camera.|$|E
25|$|J: The frog is {{a sliding}} iron wedge {{that holds the}} plane iron at the proper angle. It slides to adjust {{the gap between the}} cutting edge and the front of the mouth. The frog is screwed down {{to the inside of the}} sole through two {{parallel}} slots and on many planes is only adjustable with <b>a</b> <b>screwdriver</b> when the plane iron is removed. Some planes, such as the Stanley Bedrock line and the bench planes made by Lie-Nielsen and WoodRiver/Woodcraft have a screw mechanism that allows the frog to be adjusted without removing the blade.|$|E
25|$|First {{reports said}} the {{explosive}} device was made using hydrogen peroxide, though as later noted {{this was only}} {{a component of the}} actual explosive compound used. The initial accounts also indicated a second bomb was found, but these accounts were false. The area was searched by bomb-sniffing dogs, and no more explosives were found. The remains of the backpack contained a circuit board, wires, and a battery; a small explosive was used to safely detonate it at about 9:00p.m. Other items at the bomb site included a crescent wrench, a white sock with protruding wires, <b>a</b> <b>screwdriver,</b> unused wooden matches, and a chemistry book.|$|E

25|$|A Westland Lynx {{helicopter}} was sent after the hijackers in the motorboat heading towards the Mongolian ship. All {{four of the}} pirates from that confrontation were either killed or disappeared overboard. After the Mongolian vessel was able to proceed safely, {{the crew of the}} Choi Young recovered the remnants of the hijackers' motorboat. Three rusty AK-47 rifles and an ammunition magazine were retrieved, along with three small iron ladders for boarding and various tools, including <b>a</b> <b>screwdriver,</b> a spanner, and several fishing knives. As the pirates had only six AK-47 rifles in total and three of them had now been confiscated, they had lost half of their firearms and about a quarter of their personnel.|$|E
25|$|Linerlock {{mechanisms}} are most commonly composed of titanium alloy or steel. The linerlock's locking side liner is split {{from the top}} toward the bottom, similar to an automotive leaf spring (also called a lock bar) that butts up against the tang of the blade to prevent the blade from closing. In an interview with Blade in 1988, Walker stated, “This long leaf-spring effect cuts down on stress on the locking mechanism". As the lock on the original electrician's knife was mostly to hold <b>a</b> <b>screwdriver</b> blade open (the knife blade, itself was secured by a slip joint method), Walker's refinements prevented the knife blade from closing on the user's hand and converted it into a true lock.|$|E
25|$|Three {{variants}} {{of the original}} Contender design were later developed, distinguished easily by the hammer design. The first variant has a push button selector on the hammer for choosing rimfire vs. centerfire, the second variant has a left-center-right toggle switch for selecting center fire-safe-rimfire firing pins, and the third variant has a horizontal bolt selection for choosing center fire-safe-rimfire firing pin positions. All three of these Contender variants have a cougar etched {{on the sides of}} the receiver, thereby easily distinguishing them from the later G2 Contender which has a smooth-sided receiver without an etched cougar. Some of the very earliest Contenders, those requiring <b>a</b> <b>screwdriver</b> to switch the firing pin between rimfire and centerfire, had smooth sides, without the cougar etched on the sides.|$|E
25|$|An electrician's knife {{typically}} has <b>a</b> locking <b>screwdriver</b> blade but <b>a</b> non-locking knife blade. The two-blade Camillus Electrician's knife (the US military {{version is}} known as a TL-29) was the inspiration {{for the development of the}} linerlock.|$|R
