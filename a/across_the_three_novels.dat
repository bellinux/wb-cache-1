40|$|Shu Xiancheng (1921 - 1999) {{is a major}} Hong Kong {{author and}} is a {{representative}} of the native literature in Hong Kong. This thesis analyses Shu Xiangcheng’s <b>three</b> <b>novels,</b> <b>The</b> Sun Has Gone Down, White Jade Orchid Tree and The River Banks of Paris, {{in the light of the}} theories of bildungsroman, archetypal criticism and national allegory. Apart from studying the major features represented in <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>novels,</b> this thesis also reveals the similarities and differences between Shu’s bildungsroman and the western tradition.
