30|$|Concrete cover spalled {{in front}} of the <b>anchor</b> <b>shaft,</b> as shown in Fig.  10. The {{spalling}} can be affected by the inelastic deformation in the plastic hinge zones. With cover spalling, as illustrated in the proposed anchor shear reinforcement in Fig.  4, the shear behavior of concrete anchors would be different from that in pure shear as assumed by ACI 318 (2011). The double shear tests of anchor rods by Lin et al. (2013) provides understanding of the complex stresses in an exposed <b>anchor</b> <b>shaft.</b> However, the model failed accurately predicting the shear capacity of the anchors in this study, likely because the exiting model does not consider partial support from concrete cover before spalling.|$|E

30|$|The FRP anchors {{tested in}} these {{programs}} were fabricated manually using the same carbon-fiber material as {{was used for the}} FRP composite sheets. Each anchor consisted of a shaft region and a splay region. The <b>anchor</b> <b>shaft</b> had either a 1.3 or a 1.9  mm diameter. The <b>anchor</b> <b>shaft</b> was inserted into holes predrilled into the concrete, and the shaft region protruded from the concrete surface prior to wetting of the FRP sheet. All anchors had a 51  mm length to avoid interference with the reinforcement in the concrete blocks. This length is shorter than what is normally recommended for anchorage to concrete but did not seem to negatively affect the performance of the system as only a few anchor pullouts were observed. The hole in the concrete was partially filled prior to anchor insertion and filled to the top border after the anchor was inserted. The splay region was saturated {{at the same time as}} the FRP sheet was applied to the surface of the concrete.|$|E

30|$|Compared to {{the peak}} load of 175  kN [39.4  kips] in {{monotonic}} test when the east anchor fractured, the anchor rod {{on the west}} side in Specimen S 2 fractured under a loading of 157  kN [35.2  kips] in the opposite direction. The fractured anchor in both tests had the smaller edge distance, that is 137  mm [5.4  in.], as shown in Fig.  3. The smaller ultimate load is attributed {{to the fact that the}} concrete column in Specimen S 2 experienced a smaller loading, ± 6 Δ_y, when the west anchor fractured. Consequently, the concrete around the test anchors experienced less damage, thus providing more lateral support to the <b>anchor</b> <b>shafts</b> compared with Specimen S 1.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This {{research}} {{performed a}} series of triaxial tests on sandy specimens to obtain the parameters needed for a constitutive model. The model is capable to simulate the strain hardening/softening and the volumetric dilation of sandy soil during stressing. The model and the related parameters were then employed in the commercial software FLAC 2 D to analyze the uplift behavior of various frictional anchors in sandy soil. Analysis {{results indicate that the}} friction stress along the fixed end of the anchor with a long fixed length exhibits progressive yielding under not only for a tension but also for a compression anchor. The progressive yielding behavior could be eliminated using a compound anchor because of the upward and downward transfer of load within the <b>anchor</b> <b>shaft</b> from the anchorage body. Therefore, a compound anchor can generate a higher anchorage capacity of all frictional anchors...|$|E
30|$|Typical {{failure modes}} for such anchors in shear are anchor steel {{fracture}} and concrete breakout failure (ACI 318, 2014). Anchor steel failure {{is caused by}} fracture of an <b>anchor</b> <b>shaft</b> in shear while concrete breakout failure {{is marked by a}} concrete cone broken away from the base concrete, in which the connection is located. Concrete breakout failure in shear occurs when anchors are located close to an edge. Concrete breakout is a brittle failure mode and thus not preferred for anchor connections in seismic zones (Petersen et al. 2013 a). The well-established design procedures for concrete anchors, such as those stipulated in ACI 318 - 14, do not apply to the anchors installed in plastic hinge zones. This is because the concrete in plastic hinge zones likely develops substantial damaged during an earthquake while the design procedures are based on experimental tests of anchors in concrete that is not significantly stressed/cracked.|$|E
30|$|Anchor {{reinforcement}} must {{be provided}} for the anchors installed in plastic hinge zones. V-shaped hairpins encasing the <b>anchor</b> <b>shaft,</b> as recommended in ACI 318 - 14 codes, may not be practical for embedded connections. With a goal to confine concrete around the shaft of an anchor in shear, Petersen and Zhao (2013) proposed new anchor shear reinforcement, consisting of closely spaced stirrups, corner bars, and crack-controlling bars. The proposed reinforcement has been proved effective for anchors placed in unstressed/uncracked concrete. Meanwhile, beam/column ends, where anchor connections are placed, are likely to develop significant damages during an earthquake (Ibarra and Krawinkler 2005). The impact of potential severer damage in concrete {{on the effectiveness of}} the anchor reinforcement and on the behavior of anchors installed in plastic hinge zones has not been evaluated. In this paper, laboratory tests were presented to evaluate the recommended reinforcement for anchors installed in the plastic hinge zone of concrete columns.|$|E

To offer {{a complex}} {{diagnostic}} parameter (or system of parameters) {{that would allow}} determining the fault of electric traction motor as well as electromagnetic and mechanical nature.

In operation the reliability level of electrical machines including traction electric motor is very difficult to maintain.

40|$|Granular anchors are a {{relatively}} new concept in ground engineering with relatively little known of their applications, failure modes and ultimate pullout capacities. A granular anchor consists of three main components: a base plate; tendon and compacted granular backfill. The tendon is used to transmit the applied load to the base plate which compresses the granular material to form the anchor. A study of the load?displacement response and ultimate pullout capacity of granular anchors constructed in intact lodgement till and made ground deposits is reported in this paper. Parallel tests were also performed on cast-in situ concrete anchors that are traditionally used for anchoring purposes. A new method of analysis for {{the determination of the}} ultimate pullout capacity of granular anchors is presented and verified experimentally, with the dominant mode of failure controlled by the column aspect ratio. Granular anchors with L/D > 7 failed principally on bulging whereas short granular <b>anchors</b> failed on <b>shaft</b> friction, with the latter mobilising similar pullout capacities as conventional concrete anchors...|$|R
30|$|The {{shear force}} {{increased}} {{with a relatively}} high slope beyond 111.2  kN [25  kips] corresponding to a displacement about 19  mm [0.75  in.]. Similar observation {{has been made in}} a previous study (Petersen and Zhao 2013): the anchor shafts bent when the concrete cover spalled, and carried the shear load partially in tension. Therefore, the final anchor shear capacity had contributions from <b>anchor</b> <b>shaft</b> in shear, bending, and tension as indicated by Eq.  3. The east anchor fractured while the west anchor was also significantly bent, when the combined load was 175  kN [39.4  kips]. On average, each anchor had a shear capacity of 87.5  kN [19.7  kips], which is within the predicted range shown above. An after-test examination indicated that the unsupported length of the anchor shafts was 38  mm [1.5  in.] at the east side and 25  mm [1.0  in.] at the west side, which were measured after the crushed concrete around the anchor shafts was removed.|$|E

A new technique using anchors with fins were investigated, particularly for mechanically stabilized earth. An experimental laboratory investigation on the behaviour of anchors with fins by using various shapes, sizes, arrangements and lengths were presented. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the load-displacement relationship of pullout anchors with fins embedded in sand. A rectangular model tank with dimensions 0. 6 m length, 0. 5 m width and 0. 3 m high was designed. Models of 15 types of anchors of different lengths (0. 3 m, 0. 4 m and 0. 5 m) with fins using different and various types of lengths, sizes and arrangements embedded in sand, were experimented with. The testing program included 45 tests embedded in dry sand. The experiment was conducted in a soil laboratory at a scale of 1 : 10. The fin was placed at the end of the <b>anchor</b> <b>shaft</b> that abuts the failing structure which prevents further movement.

40|$|Background. Anchors {{are one of}} the {{important}} attachment appendages for monogenean parasites. Common descent and evolutionary processes have left their mark on anchor morphometry, in the form of patterns of shape and size variation useful for systematic and evolutionary studies. When combined with morphological and molecular data, analysis of anchor morphometry can potentially answer a wide range of biological questions. Materials and Methods. We used data from anchor morphometry, body size and morphology of 13 Ligophorus (Monogenea: Ancyrocephalidae) species infecting two marine mugilid (Teleostei: Mugilidae) fish hosts: Moolgarda buchanani (Bleeker) and Liza subviridis (Valenciennes) from Malaysia. Anchor shape and size data (n = 530) were generated using methods of geometric morphometrics. We used 28 S rRNA, 18 S rRNA, and ITS 1 sequence data to infer a maximum likelihood phylogeny. We discriminated species using principal component and cluster analysis of shape data. Adams’s Kmult was used to detect phylogenetic signal in anchor shape. Phylogeny-correlated size and shape changes were investigated using continuous character mapping and directional statistics, respectively. We assessed morphological constraints in anchor morphometry using phylogenetic regression of anchor shape against body size and anchor size. Anchor morphological integration was studied using partial least squares method. The association between copulatory organ morphology and anchor shape and size in phylomorphospace was used to test the Rohde-Hobbs hypothesis. We created monogeneaGM, a new R package that integrates analyses of monogenean anchor geometric morphometric data with morphological and phylogenetic data. Results. We discriminated 12 of the 13 Ligophorus species using anchor shape data. Significant phylogenetic signal was detected in anchor shape. Thus, we discovered new morphological characters based on <b>anchor</b> <b>shaft</b> shape, the length between the inner root point and the outer root point, and the length between the inner root point and the dent point. The species on M. buchanani evolved larger, more robust anchors; those on L. subviridis evolved smaller, more delicate anchors. Anchor shape and size were significantly correlated, suggesting constraints in anchor evolution. Tight integration between the root and the point compartments within anchors confirms the anchor as a single, fully integrated module. The correlation between male copulatory organ morphology and size with anchor shape was consistent with predictions from the Rohde-Hobbs hypothesis. Conclusions. Monogenean anchors are tightly integrated structures, and their shape variation correlates strongly with phylogeny, thus underscoring their value for systematic and evolutionary biology studies. Our MonogeneaGM R package provides tools for researchers to mine biological insights from geometric morphometric data of speciose monogenean genera...|$|E

40|$|Hair is {{maintained}} through a cyclic process that includes periodic regeneration of hair follicles in a stem cell-dependent manner. Little is known, however, about the cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate the layered differentiation {{of the hair}} follicle. We have established a mutant mouse with a cyclic alopecia phenotype resulting from the targeted disruption of Sox 21, a gene that encodes a HMG-box protein. These mice exhibit progressive hair loss after morphogenesis of the first hair follicle and become completely nude in appearance, but then show hair regrowth. Sox 21 is expressed in the cuticle layer and the progenitor cells of the hair shaft in both mouse and human. The lack of this gene results {{in a loss of}} the interlocking structures required for <b>anchoring</b> the hair <b>shaft</b> in the hair follicle. Furthermore, the expression of genes encoding the keratins and keratin binding proteins in the hair shaft cuticle are also specifically down-regulated in the Sox 21 -null mouse.

50|$|Shutting off {{the engine}} caused the {{transmission}} oil pressure to rapidly dissipate. If the selector lever was in reverse or moved to reverse after the engine stopped, two mechanical parts combined to provide a parking brake. The reverse unit ring gear was held stationary by the reverse <b>anchor.</b> The drive <b>shaft</b> could still turn causing the reverse unit sun gear and attached rear unit ring gear to rotate {{at a very high}} speed, {{were it not for the}} fact that the rear unit ring gear band was now applied by a heavy spring. Usually, bands are applied by a servo and released by spring pressure, but in this case, the band was held off by the servo and applied by spring pressure (actually, when the engine was running, the band was applied by a combination of spring pressure assisted by oil pressure). With the engine off, this brake band acting on the rear unit ring gear had a tremendous mechanical advantage. Since the rear unit ring gear with its attached reverse unit sun gear and the reverse unit ring gear were both locked to the transmission case, the planet carriers and driveshaft could not turn. As such, it provided an effective driveshaft mounted parking brake to be used alone or supplementing the hand brake.|$|R

40|$|The {{search for}} phylogenetic signal in {{morphological}} traits using geometric morphometrics represents a powerful approach {{to estimate the}} relative weights of convergence and shared evolutionary history in shaping organismal form. We assessed phylogenetic signal {{in the form of}} ventral and dorsal haptoral anchors of 14 species of Ligophorus occurring on grey mullets (Osteichthyes: Mugilidae) from the Mediterranean, the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. The phylogenetic relationships among these species were mapped onto the morphospaces of shape and size of dorsal and ventral anchors and two different tests were applied to establish whether the spatial positions in the morphospace were dictated by chance. Overall significant phylogenetic signal was found in the data. Allometric effects on anchor shape were moderate or non-significant in the case of evolutionary allometry. Relatively phylogenetically distant species occurring on the same host differed markedly in anchor morphology indicating little influence of host species on anchor form. Our results suggest that common descent and shared evolutionary history {{play a major role in}} determining the shape and, to a lesser degree in the size of haptoral anchors in Ligophorus spp. The present approach allowed tracing paths of morphological evolution in anchor shape. Species with narrow <b>anchors</b> and long <b>shafts</b> were associated predominately with Liza saliens. This morphology was considered to be ancestral relative to anchors of species occurring on Liza haematocheila and M. cephalus possessing shorter shafts and longer roots. Evidence for phylogenetic signal was more compelling for the ventral anchors, than for the dorsal ones, which could reflect different functional roles in attachment to the gills. Although phylogeny and homoplasy may act differently in other monogeneans, the present study delivers a common framework to address effectively the relationships among morphology, phylogeny and other traits, such as host specificity or niche occupancy...|$|R
