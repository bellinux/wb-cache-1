2500|$|During the springtime when mating is observable, {{adults are}} {{commonly}} found paired with the males {{mounted on the}} females. This position will be maintained for periods of time even though copulation may not be occurring at that instant. Typically, males will firmly take hold of the female’s antennae with their mandibles in order to position themselves for sexual activity. Once copulation is achieved the male will release the female’s antenna and begin to slide backward onto the female’s elytra. He will then begin to use his antennae to stroke the pronotum of the female. Again the male searches for <b>and</b> <b>grabs</b> <b>the</b> female’s antennae and this series of events is repeated. This activity will occur frequently until the female oviposits. [...] Males have not been seen to be sexually active when the eggs and/or instar larvae are present at the carcass. This behavior suggests that the males might use this time to insure paternity of the offspring of the particular female with which he mated.|$|E
