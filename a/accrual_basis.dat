25|$|By {{the timing}} of collection, VAT (as well as {{accounting}} in general) can be either accrual or cash based. Cash basis accounting is a very simple form of accounting. When a payment is received {{for the sale of}} goods or services, a deposit is made, and the revenue is recorded as of the date of the receipt of funds—no matter when the sale had been made. Cheques are written when funds are available to pay bills, and the expense is recorded as of the cheque date—regardless of when the expense had been incurred. The primary focus is on the amount of cash in the bank, and the secondary focus is on making sure all bills are paid. Little effort is made to match revenues to the time period in which they are earned, or to match expenses to the time period in which they are incurred. <b>Accrual</b> <b>basis</b> accounting matches revenues to the time period in which they are earned and matches expenses to the time period in which they are incurred. While it is more complex than cash basis accounting, it provides much more information about your business. The <b>accrual</b> <b>basis</b> allows you to track receivables (amounts due from customers on credit sales) and payables (amounts due to vendors on credit purchases). The <b>accrual</b> <b>basis</b> allows you to match revenues to the expenses incurred in earning them, giving you more meaningful financial reports.|$|E

The advent of LOLF has raised a number of questions about how to make non-business entities “accountable. ” In this context, this paper analyzes the new French “accounting constitution” from a theoretical perspective that compares business enterprise and non-business accounting representations.

40|$|The {{patterns}} {{of change in}} the financial reporting practices of the early railway companies, and their causes, are important aspects of the evolution of accounting practice more generally. They have accordingly been widely discussed in the literature, although the views expressed have rarely been supported by reference to any very substantial or systematically derived bodies of empirical evidence. One of the most interesting and important suggestions in this literature is the claim that the early UK railway companies voluntarily made both quantitative and qualitative changes to their published accounting statements, in response to a crisis in shareholder confidence {{in the second half of}} the 1840 s, consequent upon the collapse of the railway mania of 1845 - 47. The quantitative response involved the disclosure of far more information and the qualitative led to changes in the conceptual basis of reporting, from a cash to an <b>accruals</b> <b>basis,</b> changes that met with the satisfaction of the shareholders concerned and were important parts of the gradual evolution of financial reporting. The paper undertakes a systematic analysis of the financial accounting practices of the major early railway companies from 1840 until 1855. The mapping of the variety of such practices, and their changes over time, enable a re-examination of these important claims concerning the nature of the financial reporting response to one of its earliest crises. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{conceptual}} framework of {{accounting for the}} economics of non-business entities is developed and applied to the new French "accounting constitution" of governmental accounting. The concept of non-business entity is used to investigate the nature and role of non lucrative organizations within the economic system and their specific economic and monetary process. This theoretical perspective compares business and non-business accounting representations. Accordingly, concerning business entities, three different accounting models of accruals are addressed: the wealth-basis (static), the cash-basis, and the flow-basis (dynamic). Whilst the wealth-basis refers to current (fair) values and results to {{be at odds with}} the specificities of the non-business economics, a dynamic accounting model of the <b>accruals</b> <b>basis</b> is retained and adapted to these specificities. This dynamic accounting model is then applied to a conceptual assessment of the new French accounting standards set. With the enactment of the General Law of Finances of 2001 (LOLF, 2001), the French Government introduced a new set of accounting standards shaped by an explicit {{conceptual framework}}. This legislation retains for governmental accounting the logic of financial reporting that had been in effect for business enterprises, but also addresses the "specificities" of accounting for public sector entities. According to our analysis, the concepts of "produit" (revenue) and "actif" (asset), and some specific standards create an ambiguity between the static and the dynamic model.

Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the {{accounting practices}} of SMEs at Meikles Park in Mutare, so that recommendations can be made to entrepreneurs on effective strategies that can be adopted to improve their financial accounting practices. The research was guided by the following objectives, examine the types of accounting records maintained by informal traders, examine the types of financial reports being generated by informal traders and evaluate the extent to which by informal traders are engaged in financial performance measurement. The researcher used survey method making use of questionnaires supplemented by follow-up face to face interview. The study used descriptive statistics tables. A population of 127 and a sample of 57 respondents were used in this research. The findings on how books are kept revealed most of the informal traders use single entry bookkeeping systems and most of it is paper work as few of them have no computers, most of them donâ€™t have qualified bookkeepers. Most informal traders do not produce any financial reports neither do they measure their financial performance. Findings on the growth of SMEs reveals that there is still slow and stunted growth, most of these enterprises have existed between 1 - 2 years and few of them go above 5 years. The researcher recommends that present informal business owners/employees to use the <b>accruals</b> <b>basis</b> of accounting to make sure that they produce the complete picture of the firmâ€™s activities. SMEs are also recommended to use the double entry system to enable them to maintain adequate records for the preparation of financial statements. Lastly, the government should provide training programs in financial accounting skills for the owners of SMEs. The government should organize free seminars that will teach entrepreneurs on how to keep proper written records. Findings on accounting practices could be used as the basis for specific and detailed research into every separate aspect of accounting practices in Zimbabwe such as financial reporting and analysis, usefulness of cash flows and ratio analysis, outsourcing accounting services and the role of professional bodies in enhancing accounting practice in the country...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Return on assets (ROA) from {{household}} {{enterprise is}} crucial for understanding the wellbeing and productivity of households in developing economies. Yet the definition and measurement of household enterprise ROA remain inconsistent or unclear. We illustrate potential measurement problems with examples from various actual surveys. We then {{take advantage of a}} detailed integrated household survey to perform a robustness analysis, acting as if we had gathered less data than was actually the case, to see what matters and for whom. The three issues that matter most for accurate measurement of household enterprise ROA are the choice of <b>accrual</b> versus cash <b>basis</b> of income, the treatment of household’s own labor in enterprise income, and the treatment of non-factor income. Also, this sensitivity matters most for a relatively poor region dominated by crop cultivation relative to a richer region with non-farm enterprises. Though the choice between accrued income and cash income matters less when the frequency of the data declines, there remains high sensitivity in longer-term and annualized data. We conclude the paper by providing recommendations on how to improve the survey questionnaires for more accurate measurement in field research...|$|R
