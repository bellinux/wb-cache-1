5|$|Parathyroid glands share {{a similar}} blood supply, venous {{drainage}}, and lymphatic drainage to the thyroid glands. Parathyroid glands {{are derived from}} the epithelial lining of {{the third and fourth}} branchial pouches, with the superior glands <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fourth pouch, and the inferior glands <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> higher third pouch. The relative position of the inferior and superior glands, which are named according to their final location, changes because of the migration of embryological tissues.|$|E
5|$|An {{episode of}} the {{television}} programme Garrow's Law (2010) is loosely based on the legal events <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> massacre. The historical William Garrow did not {{take part in the}} case, and because the Zong captain died shortly after arriving in Jamaica, his appearance in court for fraud is also fictional.|$|E
5|$|In {{murder cases}} <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Indian Territory, Navassa Island, and the No Man's Land of the Oklahoma Panhandle, the Supreme Court has {{held that the}} Clause places no limits on the {{prosecution}} of crimes committed outside the territory of a state.|$|E

40|$|The femoral nerves {{were studied}} in newborn goats of Saanen breed (22 males and 11 females) that were {{collected}} after natural death and fixed with 10 % formaldehyde solution. In males <b>the</b> femoral nerve <b>arose</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ventral spinal branches of L 4 and L 5 in eight animals (36 %); in six animals (27 %) it <b>arose</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ventral spinal branches of L 5 and L 6; in five animals (23 %) it <b>arose</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ventral spinal branches of L 5; in two animals (9 %) it <b>arose</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ventral spinal branches of L 4, L 5 and L 6 {{and in one}} animal (5 %) it <b>arose</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ventral spinal branches of L 5 and L 6 and the ventral spinal branches of S 1.

50|$|Malignant {{peripheral}} nerve sheath tumors are a rare type of cancer that <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> soft tissue that surrounds nerves. They are {{a type of}} sarcoma. Most malignant {{peripheral nerve}} sheath tumors <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> nerve plexuses that distribute nerves into the limbs - the brachial and lumbar plexuses - or from nerves as they <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> trunk.|$|R

5|$|An {{inquiry into}} the affair by a senior judge, Lord Denning, {{indicated}} {{that there had been}} no breaches of security <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Ivanov connection, although Denning's report was later condemned as superficial and unsatisfactory. Profumo subsequently sought private atonement as a volunteer worker at Toynbee Hall, an East London charitable trust. By 1975 he had been officially rehabilitated, although he did not return to public life. He died in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen referees {{participated in}} the tournament: four Europeans – two Belgians (Henri Christophe and John Langenus), a Frenchman, and a Romanian (Constantin Rădulescu, also the Romanian team coach), and eleven from the Americas – among them six Uruguayans.

5|$|For {{surgical}} cases, {{the odds}} of cure {{vary depending on the}} tumor location and whether the tumor can be completely, or only partially, removed. Distal cholangiocarcinomas (those <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> common bile duct) are generally treated surgically with a Whipple procedure; long-term survival rates range from 15%–25%, although one series reported a five-year survival of 54% for patients with no involvement of the lymph nodes. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (those <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bile ducts within the liver) are usually treated with partial hepatectomy. Various series have reported survival estimates after surgery ranging from 22%–66%; the outcome may depend on involvement of lymph nodes and completeness of the surgery. Perihilar cholangiocarcinomas (those occurring near where the bile ducts exit the liver) are least likely to be operable. When surgery is possible, they are generally treated with an aggressive approach often including removal of the gallbladder and potentially part of the liver. In patients with operable perihilar tumors, reported 5-year survival rates range from 20%–50%.|$|E

5|$|Forty-nine men {{and youths}} {{were convicted of}} {{offences}} <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> riots, out of 359 arrested and 159 charged, not counting the six murder defendants. The trial of the six – Silcott, Raghip and Braithwaite, the adults; and Pennant, Hill and Lambie, the youths – began in court number two of the Old Bailey on 14 January 1987. All the men were charged with murder, riot, and affray; Lambie was also charged with throwing petrol bombs.|$|E
5|$|On the day Jackson {{began the}} third leg of his tour, {{news of the}} {{allegations}} broke {{to the public and}} received worldwide media attention. Jackson ultimately cancelled the remainder of the tour due to health problems <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> scandal. In January 1994 Jackson reached a financial settlement for $23,000,000 with the Chandlers to resolve the matter and in September a criminal investigation was closed. On November 5, 2009, Chandler committed suicide in his apartment in Jersey City, New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|Procedural due process, <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, is {{minimally}} {{the right}} to notice and a hearing, but has been held to include in some circumstances rights to counsel and rights to confrontation. Procedural due process is required any time a person faces the deprivation of life, liberty, or property. As substantive due process arises from the liberty clause, a deprivation of a substantive due process right is a deprivation of liberty and thus requires procedural due process.|$|E

5|$|The {{bridge was}} {{constructed}} {{over a three-year}} period from 1925. The project was not originally planned to take as long, but there were delays due to problems with a contractor, and industrial action. The bridge was designed to carry the Mildura railway line over the Murray River and into New South Wales, to service significant cross-border traffic <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fruit-growing industry, but the line was never extended beyond the terminus at Yelta. The bridge currently carries a single lane of road controlled by traffic lights.|$|E
5|$|The delegates {{representing}} the provisional government departed for Ottawa in March. Although they initially met with legal difficulties <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> execution of Scott, they soon entered into direct talks with Macdonald and George-Étienne Cartier. An agreement enshrining the demands {{in the list}} of rights was quickly reached, and this formed the basis for the Manitoba Act of 12 May 1870, which formally admitted Manitoba into the Canadian confederation. However, the negotiators could not secure a general amnesty for the provisional government.|$|E
5|$|The humeral {{plate is}} usually a small {{sclerite}} on the anterior margin of the wing base, movable and articulated with {{the base of the}} costal vein.

5000|$|The {{superior}} thoracic artery (highest thoracic artery) is a small artery {{located near}} the armpit in humans.

Colombia, however, declined to ratify the treaties, and after the 1912 elections, Knox offered $10 million to the Colombians (later raised to $25 million). The Colombians felt the amount inadequate, and requested arbitration; the matter was not settled under the Taft administration.|$|E

When he temporarily lost his seat in 1997—he regained it in 2001—his narrow defeat was widely regarded as <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> intervention of Roger Percival, the candidate for the Referendum Party whose votes largely came from disgruntled Conservatives. Despite the different spelling, media accounts asserted Percival's descent from the assassinated Prime Minister's family, and reported the defeat as a belated form of revenge.|$|E
