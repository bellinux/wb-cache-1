25|$|Although {{the strike}} {{was a failure}} in {{that it did not}} win {{reinstatement}} for the faculty, the strike established the AFT as the pre-eminent union organizing <b>American</b> <b>higher</b> education faculty.

In 1967, Kugler began pushing for the UFCT to organize the faculty at CUNY.
