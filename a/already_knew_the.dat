5|$|When Rome had {{received}} word of Germanicus' death, the people began observing a iustitium before the Senate had officially declared it. Tacitus says this shows the true grief {{that the people}} of Rome felt, and this also shows that by this time the people <b>already</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> proper way to commemorate dead princes without an edict from a magistrate. At his funeral, there were no procession statues of Germanicus. There were abundant eulogies and reminders of his fine character and a particular eulogy was given by Tiberius himself in the Senate.|$|E
5|$|The {{continuous}} development of Johor Bahru was, however, halted when the Japanese under General Tomoyuki Yamashita invaded the town on 31 January 1942. As the Japanese had reached northwest Johor by 15 January, they easily captured major towns of Johor such of Batu Pahat, Yong Peng, Kluang and Ayer Hitam. The British and other Allied forces {{were forced to}} retreat towards Johor Bahru; however, following a further series of bombings by the Japanese on 29 January, the British retreated to Singapore and blew up the causeway the following day as a final attempt to stop the Japanese advancement in British Malaya. The Japanese then used the Sultan's residence of Bukit Serene Palace located in the town as their main temporary base for their future initial plans to conquest Singapore while waiting to reconnect the causeway. The Japanese chose the palace as their main base because they <b>already</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> British would not dare to attack it as this would harm their close relationship with Johor.|$|E

25|$|It is {{traditionally}} believed the earliest writings {{had the advantage}} of being checked by people who <b>already</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> text by heart, for they had learned it {{at the time of the}} revelation itself and had subsequently recited it constantly. Since the official compilation was completed several decades after Muhammad's death, the Uthman text has been scrupulously preserved. Bucaille believed that this did not give rise to any problems of this Quran's authenticity.|$|E
25|$|I'm really {{pissed off}} with the BBC for {{bringing}} down my first three episodes to two and, in doing so, taking out much of the vital politics. What also makes me very grumpy is that I {{was told that the}} cuts had been introduced by the BBC because they thought British viewers <b>already</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> historical background. But all that's happened as far as the viewer is concerned is that it has made Rome hard to follow.|$|E
25|$|After La Gioconda, Callas had {{no further}} offers, and when Serafin, {{looking for someone}} to sing Isolde, called on her, she told him that she <b>already</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> score, even though she had looked at only the first act out of curiosity while at the conservatory. She sight-read the opera's second act for Serafin, who praised her for knowing the role so well, whereupon she {{admitted}} to having bluffed and having sight-read the music. Even more impressed, Serafin immediately cast her in the role. Serafin thereafter served as Callas's mentor and supporter.|$|E

25|$|The {{apparent}} secrecy {{surrounding the}} report {{written by the}} investigation panel from the Department of Civil Aviation attracted strong criticism. After the Minister, Mr Drakeford, announced to the House of Representatives {{that there was no}} need for a public inquiry into the disaster because he and his Department <b>already</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> cause, he was attacked for presuming to know all the reasons when the Coroner's inquest was still in progress. An editorial in the Brisbane Courier-Mail claimed the Minister was trying to avoid public inquiries into aviation accidents. The Attorney-General's decision to withhold the Coroner's report also attracted strong criticism.|$|E
25|$|The French soldier Antoine d'Arces {{arrived at}} Dumbarton Castle in November with a shipload of armaments which were transported to Stirling. The English <b>already</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> {{details of this}} planned {{shipment}} from a paper found in a bag at Flodden field. Now that James IV was dead, Antoine d'Arces promoted the appointment of John Stewart, Duke of Albany, a grandson of James II of Scotland as Regent to rule Scotland instead of Margaret and her son. Albany, who lived in France, came to Scotland on 26 May 1515. By that date Margaret {{had given birth to}} James's posthumous son Alexander and married the Earl of Angus.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, Edwards {{began his}} own firm in Raleigh (now named Kirby & Holt) with a friend, David Kirby. He {{became known as}} the top plaintiffs' {{attorney}} in North Carolina. The biggest case of his legal career was a 1996 product liability lawsuit against Sta-Rite, the manufacturer of a defective pool drain cover. The case involved Valerie Lakey, a three-year-old girl who was disemboweled by the suction power of the pool drain pump when she sat on an open pool drain whose protective cover had been removed by other children at the pool, after the swim club had failed to install the cover properly. Despite 12 prior suits with similar claims, Sta-Rite continued to make and sell drain covers lacking warnings. Sta-Rite protested that an additional warning would have made no difference because the pool owners <b>already</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> importance of keeping the cover secured.|$|E

500|$|To {{differentiate}} the storytelling {{from what the}} audience <b>already</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>the</b> writing staff decided to begin the pilot {{with the end of}} the typical Snow White fairytale. Themes concerning family and motherhood were emphasized, in contrast to the focus on fatherhood in Lost. Kitsis and Horowitz sought to write strong female characters, rather than the classic damsel in distress. Horowitz stated their desire to approach each character the same way, asking themselves, [...] "How do we make these icons real, make them relatable?" ...|$|E

As the librarian, she {{had access}} to the Technical Area, and told her husband, {{physicist}} Robert Serber, who then went to inform Oppenheimer. When he reached his office, he found that Oppenheimer <b>already</b> <b>knew.</b> <b>The</b> security chief at Los Alamos, Captain Peer de Silva, had received the news through the wiretap and Army Intelligence, and had broken it to Oppenheimer. Tatlock had introduced Oppenheimer to the poetry of John Donne, and it is widely believed he named the first test of a nuclear weapon [...] "Trinity" [...] in reference to one of Donne's poems, as a tribute to her. In 1962, Leslie Groves wrote to Oppenheimer about the origin of the name, and elicited this reply: ...|$|E
500|$|According to Lee, several core {{concepts}} {{were already}} in place from Buck and Del Vecho's early work, such as the film's [...] "frozen heart" [...] hook: [...] "That was a concept and the phrase... an act of true love will thaw a frozen heart." [...] They <b>already</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> ending involved true love {{in the sense of}} the emotional bond between siblings, not romance, in that [...] "Anna was going to save Elsa. We didn’t know how or why." [...] Lee said Edwin Catmull, president of Disney Animation, told her early on about the film's ending: [...] "First and foremost, no matter what you have to do to the story, do it. But you have to earn that ending. If you do it will be great. If you don't, it will suck." ...|$|E

500|$|Renwick {{decided to}} use the {{flashback}} structure for several reasons. He felt that the episode should be about [...] "life After Victor, which I think will be more interesting and not the route people are expecting you to take." [...] He realised that most viewers would have been aware of Victor's death because of the press coverage; there would be little point in having the death be the climax of the episode because everyone <b>already</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> outcome. However, the focus would be upon Victor's death rather than the details of the accident. Renwick's decision to kill Victor in a road accident was fuelled by the writer's concerns about reckless driving. Also, the suddenness of an accident, as opposed to death by illness, would not negate the comic tone {{of the rest of the}} episode. The twist that the person responsible for Victor's death is Margaret's new best friend was designed to add some complexity to the show.|$|E
500|$|In March 2009, Morrissey {{appeared}} as corrupt police detective Maurice Jobson in Red Riding, the Channel 4 adaptation of David Peace's Red Riding novels. Morrissey <b>already</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> {{directors of the}} films, enjoyed reading the script and had either worked with his co-stars on other projects, or {{wanted to work with}} them. He liked the flaws in the Jobson character and that he differs from typical vigilante police officers portrayed on television. Morrissey said of Jobson, [...] "I think he sets out to be a good cop, he tries to do his job well but he gets involved in some corruption and realises that being a 'bit' corrupt is like being a 'bit' pregnant. You either are or you're not." [...] He received a Best Actor nomination from the Broadcasting Press Guild for the role. At the end of the year, Morrissey played Bobby Dykins in the John Lennon biopic Nowhere Boy (2009). As a self-confessed [...] "Beatles geek", Morrissey relished the opportunity to star in the film about Lennon's childhood.|$|E
500|$|Some critics, used to more {{prescriptive}} cookery writers, {{thought her}} approach assumed too much knowledge {{on the part}} of the reader. In her view, [...] "The ideal cookery writer is one who makes his readers want to cook as well as telling them how it is done; he should leave something, not too much perhaps, but a little, unsaid: people must make their own discoveries, use their own intelligence, otherwise they will be deprived of part of the fun." [...] In The New York Times Craig Claiborne wrote admiringly of David, but remarked that because she assumed her readers <b>already</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> basics of cooking she would be [...] "valued more by those with a serious regard for food than by those with a casual interest". [...] The writer Julian Barnes commented that as an amateur cook he found David's terse instructions intimidating: of a recipe in Italian Food [...] he wrote, [...] "E.D.'s first sentence reads like this: 'Melt 1½ lbs (675 g) chopped and skinned tomatoes in olive oil'... Melt? Melt a tomato?... Could it be that Elizabeth David was too good a writer to be a food writer?". A later cook, Tom Parker Bowles, observes, [...] "You don't turn to Elizabeth David for nannying, step-by-step instruction, or precise amounts and timing. She assumes you know the basics, and is a writer who offers inspiration, and wonderful, opinionated prose. Her recipes are timeless, and all her books wonderful works of reference (and tirelessly researched) as well as beautiful reads." ...|$|E

2500|$|The virtuosity {{of these}} roles is perhaps {{attributable}} {{to the fact that}} when he took up the task of composing the opera, Mozart <b>already</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> outstanding reputations of the singers for whom he was writing, and he tailored the arias to their strengths. The first Osmin was Ludwig Fischer, a bass noted for his wide range and skill in leaping over large intervals with ease.
