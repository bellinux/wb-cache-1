5|$|The Parliamentary Elections Act <b>and</b> <b>Presidential</b> Elections Act {{regulate}} {{the exercise of}} the vote and set out the procedures for parliamentary <b>and</b> <b>presidential</b> elections in Singapore. These are ordinary statutes which can be changed by a simple majority in Parliament. All Singapore citizens not less than 21 years old on the cut-off date for the registration of electors (1 January of a particular year), and ordinarily resident in the country, are entitled to vote in both parliamentary <b>and</b> <b>presidential</b> elections. A one person, one vote system is currently in operation, though in 1994 Senior Minister and former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew suggested that people aged between 35 and 60 who were married with children should be given two votes each due to their greater responsibilities and contributions to society. Overseas voting was introduced in 2001, and first carried out during the 2006 general election.|$|E
5|$|All three {{channels}} televise {{events such}} as congressional hearings, White House press briefings <b>and</b> <b>presidential</b> speeches, {{as well as other}} government meetings including Federal Communications Commission hearings and Pentagon press conferences. Other U.S. political coverage includes State of the Union speeches, <b>and</b> <b>presidential</b> press conferences. According to the results of a survey after the 1992 presidential election, 85% of C-SPAN viewers voted in that election. The results of a similar survey in 2013 found that 89% of C-SPAN viewers voted in the 2012 presidential election. In addition to this political coverage, the network broadcasts press conferences and meetings of various news media and nonprofit organizations, including those at the National Press Club, public policy seminars and the White House Correspondents' Dinner. While C-SPAN does not have video access to the Supreme Court, the network has used the Court's audio recordings accompanied by still photographs of the justices and lawyers to cover the Court in session on significant cases, and has covered individual Supreme Court justices' speaking engagements.|$|E

5|$|In 1984, {{former vice}} {{president}} <b>and</b> <b>presidential</b> candidate Walter Mondale, seen as an underdog, selected Ferraro to be his running mate in the upcoming election. Ferraro became the only Italian American to be a major-party national nominee {{in addition to being}} the first woman. The positive polling the Mondale-Ferraro ticket received when she joined soon faded, as damaging questions arose about her and her businessman husband's finances and wealth and her Congressional disclosure statements. In the general election, Mondale and Ferraro were defeated in a landslide by incumbent President Ronald Reagan and Vice President George H. W. Bush.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, federal {{prosecutors}} such as Eugene Reese attempted to prosecute responsible parties under federal laws against debt peonage.

Northern attention was focused on immigration and World War I. The convict lease system finally ended {{with the advent of}} World War II. National <b>and</b> <b>presidential</b> attention was focused on racial issues because of the need for national unity and mobilization of the military.|$|E

5|$|Democratic U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy was re-elected in 2006, {{and died}} on August 25, 2009 from a {{malignant}} brain tumor. On September 24, 2009, Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick appointed {{longtime friend of}} Kennedy and former Democratic National Committee Chairman Paul G. Kirk to succeed Kennedy until a special election could be held. Kirk's appointment was especially controversial, as the Governor's ability to appoint an interim Senator was removed during the Romney administration by the Democratic-controlled legislature, as a precaution if Senator <b>and</b> <b>presidential</b> nominee John Kerry was elected President in 2004. Laws surrounding Senate appointment were quickly changed following Kennedy's death. The Massachusetts Republican Party sued {{in an attempt to}} halt Kirk's appointment, but it was rejected by Suffolk Superior Court Judge Thomas Connolly.|$|E

On March 3, 1873, Grant signed into law a congressional <b>and</b> <b>presidential</b> salary increase.

5|$|The Croatian Parliament tasked the Croatian State Election Committee with {{referendum}} voting organization, ballot counting, {{and result}} publication. The committee scheduled the referendum vote for 22 January 2012 starting at 07:00 and lasting until 19:00, at regular polling stations in Croatia, in Croatian military units, in Croatian diplomatic missions abroad, on Croatian-flagged vessels and in prisons: 6,750polling stations in all. For the referendum, all polling stations were grouped {{in a single}} district. Voters traveling abroad were permitted {{to vote in the}} Croatian diplomatic missions as with Croatian presidential elections; however, the initial instructions by the Ministry of Public Administration did not allow voters within Croatia who were away from their place of residence to vote in the referendum, nor did it allow absentee ballots. GONG, the Croatian election supervision NGO, requested that the authorities correct this. One restriction was removed by 3 January, when voters were permitted to register to vote in Croatia away from their legal residence. Registration was possible until 7 January, in person, by fax, or by e-mail. When the registration process completed in early January 2012 ahead of the referendum, there were 4,504,686voters in the voter registry (the same one used in parliamentary <b>and</b> <b>presidential</b> elections).|$|E
