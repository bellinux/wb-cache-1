25|$|In Egypt, Mamluk {{centralization}} over {{agricultural production}} was more thorough than in Syria and Palestine {{for a number}} of reasons. Among them was that virtually <b>all</b> <b>agriculture</b> in Egypt depended on an irrigation single source, the Nile, and the measures and rights to irrigation were determined by the river's flooding, whereas in Syria and Palestine, there were multiple sources of mostly rain-fed irrigation, and measures and rights were thus determined at the local level. Centralization over Syria and Palestine was also more complicated than in Egypt due to the diversity of those regions' geography and the frequent invasions of the Syro-Palestinian territories. The state's role in Syro-Palestinian agriculture was restricted to the fiscal administration and to the irrigation networks and other aspects of rural infrastructure. Although the level of centralization not as high as in Egypt, the Mamluks did impose enough control over the Syrian economy to derive revenues from Syria that benefited the sultanate and contributed to the defense of its realm. Furthermore, the maintenance of the Mamluk army in Syria relied on the state's control over Syrian agricultural revenues.|$|E

Army quartermaster and commissary officers were authorized to seize private property for army use, compensated at below market prices with depreciated currency. Not {{only did the}} Confederate States Congress anticipate the U.S. initiating a draft to conscript a mass army, it began an income tax fifty years before the U.S. Government, both monetary and in kind. A graduated income tax spanned one percent for monetary incomes under $500, to 15 percent for those over $1500, a 10 percent tax was levied on all profit from sale of foodstuffs, clothing and iron, and <b>all</b> <b>agriculture</b> and livestock were taxed 10 percent of everything grown or slaughtered. Congress authorized $500 million in bonds {{in an effort to}} stem inflation. But in a wartime economy, inflation went from 300 percent for a gold dollar to 2000 percent from January 1863 to January 1864, an inflation rate of over 600 percent in one year. The inflation rate discouraged investment in bonds, and only $21 million was retired from circulation.|$|E

5000|$|Economic {{developments}} in the Soviet Union from 1929 to 1941 included the acceleration of collectivisation of agriculture. In 1930, 23.6 percent of <b>all</b> <b>agriculture</b> was collectivised; by 1941, 98 percent of <b>all</b> <b>agriculture</b> was collectivised. This process of collectivisation included [...] "dekulakisation", in which kulaks were forced off their land, persecuted, and killed {{in a wave of}} terror unleashed by the Soviet state against them. The collectivisation policies resulted in economic disaster with severe fluctuations in grain harvests, catastrophic losses in the number of livestock, a substantial drop in the food consumption of the country's citizens, and the allegedly intentional Holodomor famine in the Ukraine. Modern sources estimate that between 2.4 and 7.5 million Ukrainians died in the Holodomor famine. Vast industrialisation was initiated, mostly based on the basis of preparation for an offensive war against the West - with a focus on heavy industry. However, even at its peak, industry of the Soviet Union remained well behind that of the United States. Industrialisation led to a massive urbanisation in the country. Unemployment was virtually eliminated in the country during the 1930s.|$|E
