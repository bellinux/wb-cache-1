5000|$|... (Original description) The {{shell is}} rather large, with the {{posterior}} groove and an area about {{as wide as}} this groove, anterior to the groove, on the axial ribs, white. This {{is followed by a}} broad zone of chestnut-brown occupying about half the whorls between the summit and suture. This zone terminates a little below the periphery. Anterior to this is a fainter thread of brown and a little paler brown area in the groove just posterior to the fasciole. In addition to this, there are, in the lighter bands in the intercostal spaces, indications of pale brown markings. The broad brown band becomes enfeebled on the last portion of the body whorl. The interior of the aperture is bluish white with the dark band shining partly through this, and the callus on the columellar area is porcelaneous. The protoconch contains 1.5 small whorls, well rounded and smooth. The postnuclear whorls are appressed at the summit with a depressed groove occupying the posterior third between the summit and suture, evenly rounded from the anterior termination of this to the periphery, and marked by strong, broad, rounded, axial ribs. These have their strongest development anterior to the sinus at the summit and become attenuated posteriorly in crossing the base, where they extend to the basal fasciole. Of these ribs, 10 are present on the first four whorls, 12 on the fifth to seventh, 14 on the eighth and ninth, and 16 on the tenth. The spaces separating the axial ribs are about as wide as the ribs. In addition to this sculpture the whorls are marked by slender spiral threads in the depressed area near the summit, of which II are present on the body whorl. Anterior to the depressed area the threads are replaced by pitted impressed lines, which also cover the base. Between the threads and lines, under high magnification, still finer, closely spaced, microscopic spiral striations are present, and the ribs and the intercostal spaces also bear fine incremental lines with microscopic axial incised lines between them. The heavier incremental lines terminating anteriorly in the spiral line of pits divide the space between the spiral lines into scalelike elements suggesting the scales of some butterfly wings, each scale being bordered by a deeper <b>axial</b> <b>depression</b> and marked by microscopic axial striations, as well as the microscopic spiral lines, the axial striations being a little stronger. The columella has a moderately strong basal fasciole, which is bordered posteriorly by three feeble spiral threads and crossed by two more, whereas anterior to the basal fasciole the columella bears aboutsix feebly impressed spiral threads. The aperture is moderately large, rather broad, slightly channeled anteriorly with the posterior channel deeply incised and its wall reflected as a strong callus over the parietal wall. The stromboid notch at the anterior end of the outer lip is rather short and shallow. The space between the stromboid notch and the basal channel is clawlike. The parietal wall is covered by a moderately thick callus. There is a stronger varix {{about a quarter of a}} turn behind the aperture on the body whorl.|$|E

40|$|The salt valleys {{over the}} axis of the salt-cored anticlines in the Paradox fold and fault belt (Canyonlands, Utah and Colorado) are created by {{subsidence}} of the anticline crests. Traditionally, {{the collapse of the}} anticlinal crests was attributed to dissolution of the salt walls (diapirs) forming the anticline cores. Recent studies based on scaled physical models and field observations propose that the salt valleys are a result of regional extension and that salt dissolution had only a minor influence {{in the development of the}} <b>axial</b> <b>depressions.</b> This paper presents several arguments and lines of evidence that refute the tectonic model and support the salt dissolution subsidence interpretation. The development of contractional structures in salt dissolution experiments led the advocates of the tectonic interpretation to reject the dissolution-induced subsidence explanation. However, these salt dissolution models do not reproduce the karstification of salt walls in a realistic way, since their analog involves removal of salt from the base of the diapirs during the experiments. Additionally, numerous field examples and laboratory models conducted by other authors indicate that brittle subsidence in karst settings is commonly controlled by subvertical gravity faults. Field evidence against the regional extension model includes (1) a thick cap rock at the top of the salt walls, (2) the concentration of subsidence deformation structures along the crest of the anticlines (salt walls), (3) deformational structures not consistent with the proposed NNE extension, like crestal synforms and NE-SW grabens, (4) dissolution-induced subsidence structures controlled by ring faulting, revealing deep-seated dissolution, (5) large blocks foundered several hundred meters into the salt wall, (6) evidence of recent and active dissolution subsidence, and (7) the aseismic nature of the recently active collapse faults. Although underground salt dissolution seems to be the main cause for the generation of the salt valleys, this phenomenon may have been favored by regional extension tectonics that enhance the circulation of groundwater and salt dissolution...|$|R

During stage 2, volcanism is rare to absent and the elongate summit depression develops and widens by collapse of the summit of the crestal ridge, as a result of tectonic stretching (e. g., southern Endeavour Ridge).

40|$|International audienceSeismicity {{released}} during lateral dike intrusions in the Manda Hararo–Dabbahu Rift (Afar, Ethiopia) provides indirect {{insight into}} the distribution and evolution of tensile stress along this magma‐assisted divergent plate boundary. In this paper, 5 dike intrusions among the 14 that form the 2005 –present rifting episode are analyzed with local and regional seismic data. During dike intrusions, seismicity migrates over distances of 10 – 15 km at velocities of 0. 5 – 3. 0 km/h away from a single reservoir {{in the center of}} the rift segment, confirming the analogy with a slow spreading mid‐ocean ridge segment. Comparison with geodetic data shows that the reservoir is located 7 km down rift from the topographic summit of the <b>axial</b> <b>depression.</b> Dikes emplaced toward the north are observed to migrate faster and to be more voluminous than those migrating southward, suggesting an asymmetry of tension in the brittle‐elastic lithosphere. Seismicity during dike injections is concentrated near the propagating crack front. In contrast, faults and fissures in the subsurface appear to slip or open aseismically coeval with the intrusions. The seismic energy released during dike intrusions in the Manda Hararo Rift appears to be primarily modulated by the local magnitude of differential tensile stress and marginally by the rate of stress change induced by the intrusion. The low level of seismic energy accompanying dike intrusions, despite their significant volumes, is likely an indicator of an overall low level of tension in the lithosphere of this nascent plate boundary...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{provide a}} new set of {{complementary}} geodetic data for the 2005 rifting event of Afar (Ethiopia). Interferometric synthetic aperture radar and subpixel correlations of synthetic aperture radar and SPOT images allow us to deduce 3 -D surface displacement unambiguously. We determine the geometry of the dike and neighboring magma chambers and invert for the distribution of opening of the dike, as well as slip on rift border faults. The volume of the 2005 dike (1. 5 – 2. 0 km 3) is not balanced by sufficient volume loss at Dabbahu and Gabho volcanoes (0. 42 and 0. 12 km 3, respectively). Taking into account the deflation of a suspected deep midsegment magma chamber simultaneously to dike intrusion produces a smoother opening distribution along the southern segment. Above the dike, faults slipped by an average 3 m, yielding an estimated geodetic moment of 3. 5 × 1019 Nm, one order of magnitude larger than the cumulative seismic moment released during the earthquake swarm. Between Dabbahu and Ado'Ale volcanic complexes, significant opening occurred on the western side of the dike. The anomalous location of the dike at this latitude, offset to the east of the <b>axial</b> <b>depression,</b> may explain this phenomenon. A two-stage intrusion scenario is proposed, whereby rifting in the northern Manda Hararo Rift was triggered by magma upwelling in the Dabbahu area, at the northern extremity of the magmatic segment. Although vigorous dike injection occurred during the September 2005 event, the tectonic stress deficit since the previous rifting episode was not fully released, leading to further intrusions in 2006 – 2009...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The Atlantis II Deep is an <b>axial</b> <b>depression</b> of the Red Sea {{filled with}} highly saline brines and covered by layered metalliferous sediment. We report new {{data on the}} {{vertical}} distribution of major salts and trace metals dissolved in the pore waters of the metalliferous sediments. We have studied the chemical composition of interstitial waters of two sediment cores of the western (core 684) and southwestern (core 683) basins. The major dissolved elements are Na and Cl. Their concentrations are close {{to those of the}} brine overlying the sediment. The pore waters are undersaturated with respect to halite at the in situ conditions (62 °C, 220 bars), but are saturated at the shipboard conditions (10 °C, 1 bar). The salt and water contents of the bulk sediment show that core 683 contained halite in the solid fraction. A part of it precipitated after core collection, but most of it was present in situ. Thermodynamic calculations with a water–rock interaction model based on Pitzer’s ion interaction approach reveal that equilibrium between the pore waters and anhydrite is achieved in sediment layers for which observations report the presence of this mineral. We used a transport model, which shows that molecular diffusion can smooth the profile of dissolved salt and partly erase the pore water record of past variations of salinity in the lower brine. For example, we calculated that the pore water record of modern variation of brine salinity is rapidly smoothed by molecular diffusion. The dissolved transition metals show large variations with depth in the interstitial waters. The profiles of core 683 reflect th...|$|E
40|$|Crustal {{extension}} at mature continental rifts and oceanic ridges occurs by {{a combination}} of normal faulting and magma injection, which interact to create rift morphology. Quantifying the relative roles of faulting and melt intrusion in accommodating extension at magmatic rifts remains difficult and requires studies at sufficient spatial and temporal scales to resolve the interaction between these processes. In this study we provide new chronological constraints based on cosmogenic exposure dating for the ∼ 100 kyr topographic evolution of a young and active magmatic rift segment in Afar, Ethiopia. We combine structural investigations, field mapping, geochemical analysis and cosmogenic 3 He exposure dating of lava surfaces in order to investigate the interplay between volcanic activity and fault growth {{in the northern part of}} the <b>axial</b> <b>depression,</b> where the rift segment intersects a large stratovolcano. Our results allow us to determine the roles of the various magma reservoirs feeding this rift system and their interactions during accretion over the past 100 kyr. New age data for key lava units allow several magmatic cycles to be distinguished. Each cycle lasts 20 – 40 ka resulting in periods of high and low magma supply rate. The variations in magma supply rate at the segment extremity strongly affect the development of the rift depression, with the availability of melt controlling the morphological impact of faulting. Melts from different magma reservoirs feeding the segment are chemically distinct and geochemical analysis of lavas from the rift floor allows their respective contributions to maintaining magmatic accretion to be estimated. We propose that melts from the magma reservoir at the northern end of the segment contribute around one-third of the length of this portion of the segment, whereas the mid-segment reservoir is responsible for the remaining two-thirds of the segment accretion...|$|E
40|$|International audienceUnravelling the {{volcanic}} {{history of the}} Dabbahu/Manda Hararo rift segment in the Afar depression (Ethiopia) {{using a combination of}} cosmogenic (36 Cl and 3 He) surface exposure dating of basaltic lava- flows, field observations, geological mapping and geochemistry, we show in this paper that magmatic activity in this rift segment alternates between two distinct magma chambers. Recent activity in the Dabbahu rift (notably the 2005 – 2010 dyking crises) has been fed by a seismically well-identified magma reservoir within the rift axis, and we show here that this magma body has been active over the last 30 kyr. However, in addition to this axial magma reservoir, we highlight in this paper the importance of a second, distinct magma reservoir, located 15 km west of the current axis, which has been the principal focus of magma accumulation from 15 ka to the subrecent. Magma supply to the axial reservoir substantially decreased between 20 ka and the present day, while the flank reservoir appears to have been regularly supplied with magma since 15 ka ago, resulting in less variably differentiated lavas. The trace element characteristics of magmas from both reservoirs were generated by variable degrees of partial melting of a single homogeneous mantle source, but their respective magmas evolved separately in distinct crustal plumbing systems. Magmatism in the Dabbahu/Manda Hararo rift segment is not focussed within the current <b>axial</b> <b>depression</b> but instead is spread out over at least 15 km on the western flank. This is consistent with magneto-telluric observations which show that two magma bodies are present below the segment, with the main accumulation of magma currently located below the western flank, precisely where the most voluminous recent (105 yr) alternation between distinct crustal reservoirs located broadly at the same location relative to the segment appears to be a key feature for organizing and maintaining active spreading centres over stable soft points in the mantle...|$|E
40|$|A {{major step}} in the "Wilson Cycle" is the {{splitting}} of a continent {{and the birth of}} a new ocean, with the consequent formation of passive plate margins. The transition from a continental to an oceanic rift can be observed today nowhere better than in the Red Sea/Gulf of Aden system. We have carried out during several years a number of expeditions in the axial portion of the Northern Red Sea, in the region where the northernmost nuclei of axial emplacement of oceanic crust can be observed. High resolution multibeam, magnetics, gravity and multichannel seismic reflection surveys from the Thetis Deep revealed rates and modes of initial pulses of sea floor spreading, velocity of S to N axial propagation of the oceanic rift, evolution of initial MORB-type crust and nature of the mantle thermal anomaly that caused the transition from a continental to an oceanic rift. The Thetis deep is made of three en echelon fault-bounded axial basins that are joined together with axial volcanic ridges and a large number of scattered small central volcanoes. The southern basin shows a strong linear magnetic anomaly corresponding to the axial neo-volcanic zone. Two negative symmetric anomalies identified as Matuyama are present in the southernmost part of this basin, suggesting that the emplacement of oceanic crust at this site started roughly 2. 5 Ma, with an average half spreading rate of 6 mm/yr. The central sub-basin is also characterized by a strongly magnetic linear neo- volcanic zone that, however, is flanked only by a small, "vanishing" symmetrical negative anomaly suggesting emplacement of oceanic crust not earlier than about 1 Ma. The northern sub-basin does not show a clearly defined linear neo-volcanic zone although it displays a strong central magnetization suggesting initial emplacement of oceanic crust < 0. 7 Ma. This pattern implies a south to north time progression of the initial emplacement of oceanic crust within the Thetis system, with a propagation rate of about 20 mm/yr. Gravity data inversions constrained by seismic data reveal that the oceanic crust extends from the axial neo-volcanic ridges toward the master faults of the <b>axial</b> <b>depression</b> with crustal thickness ranging from 4 to 6 km. The increasing thickness of basaltic crust toward the edges of the basin together with higher degree of melting, inferred by the geochemistry of the basaltic glasses, and higher central magnetization of the northernmost and youngest basin suggest a pulse of faster spreading rate at the onset of sea-floor spreading...|$|E
40|$|Menorca is {{subdivided}} in main {{regions with}} different stratigraphic and tectonic characteristics. To the north, folded, thrusted and faulted Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Paleogene rocks compose the Tramuntana region. To the south, upper-Miocene carbonate and, locally, siliciclastic rocks compose the Migjorn region. Upper Miocene rocks unconformably overlie Paleozoic to middle Miocene basement. In the Migjorn, three Miocene depositional units were recognized (Pomar et al., 2002 and references herein) : the Basal Conglomeratic Unit (Burdigalian p. p.), interpreted as near-shore to fan-delta deposits; the Lower Bar Unit (early Tortonian), {{interpreted as a}} distally steepened carbonate ramp; the Reef Complex (upper Tortonian - lower Messinian), a reef-rimmed platform prograding complex. Within the ramp, Pomar et al. (2002) distinguished four facies belts: fan-delta conglomerates and bioturbated packstones (inner ramp), crossbedded grainstones (middle- ramp), rhodolithic rudstone clinobeds (ramp slope) and fine-grained wackestone-packstone with planktonic foraminifers (outer ramp). The cross-bedded units here analysed occur at the transition lower slope-outer ramp. They infill the <b>axial</b> <b>depression</b> of large slide/slump scars. These scars truncate the gently, 10 °- 12 ° basinward dipping, slope-to-outer ramp succession. The wedge-shaped cross-bedded units, 10 - 12 m thick, pinch out basinward and extend laterally for tens of meters. Several amalgamated cross-laminated bodies, 40 cm- to 2 m wide each with erosive base compose each unit. They are composed by rhodolithic-mollusk rudstone with coarse grain/packstone matrix. Porosity is very high, cementation low and dolomitization patchy. Matrix consists of red-algal-, bivalve-, echinoderm, coral fragments, and benthic foraminifers. Ooids are, locally abundant along with limestone pebbles. Pebbles are flat, 5 - to 10 -cm wide, of oolitic grainstone, sometimes with mollusk borings. Cross bedding is underlined by the abundance and orientation of coarser components. Cross-laminae within units dip upslope (8 ° to 35 °) forming backstepping backsets. Upslope bedform migration has been explained as forming when a supercritical flow encounters a local obstruction (or a local break on the slope), and a hydraulic jump may occur within the flow, upcurrent from the obstruction. Sediment will be therefore deposited at the obstruction forming an up-flow-dipping slipface that will tend to accrete and migrate in the upflow direction. In Menorca, these sedimentary structures have been interpreted by Pomar et al. (2002), as backset beds related to up-stream migrating hydraulic jump where slide scars acted as slope channels funneling platform debris down the slope. The occurrence of aragonitic components (oolites, corals) within these units, absent in the ramp system, and the scars development {{at the end of}} the ramp progradation, suggest the involvement of Reef Complex sediment. Therefore, those events, involved both sediment of the upper Tortonian distally steepened ramp and part of the Reef Complex. These structures have been mostly described in different environments of terrigenous systems. In carbonate systems are scarcely described and none from carbonate ramps. The architecture characterizing these upslope cross-bedded beds seams to call for a scour-and-fill process, therefore initially the action of a strong scouring event immediately followed by depositional events. The presence of these bodies in various intervals suggests the repetitive occurrence of this process. In the studied system, deep-scouring events on the platform could be represented by slope failures that induced tsunami events or by eustatic variations, able to create strong downslope flows directed offshore. Scours have been rapidly infilled by shallow-water sediment...|$|E
40|$|The upper Miocene units {{cropping}} {{out along}} the southern coast of the Island of Menorca (Balearic Islands, Spain), are mainly represented by two carbonate depositional systems: an early Tortonian distally steepened ramp (Lower Bar Unit) and an upper Tortonian – lower Messinian reef-rimmed platform prograding complex (Reef Complex). Within the distally steepened ramp, Pomar et al. (2002) distinguished four facies belts: fan-delta conglomerates passing upwards to bioturbated packstones (inner ramp), cross-bedded grainstones (middle- ramp), clinostratified rhodolithic rudstone (ramp slope) and fine-grained wackestonepackstone with planktonic foraminifera (outer ramp). The backset-bedded units analysed in this work are placed at the transition between toe-of-slope and outer ramp sediments, below the wave-base-level. They infill the <b>axial</b> <b>depression</b> of large slide/slump scars. These scars truncate the gently, 10 °- 12 ° basinward dipping, slope-to-outer ramp clinoforms. Backset beds are cross-bedded forms that dip against the direction of flow of the depositing currents, therefore they present foresets migrating upcurrent (Gary et al., 1972). These sedimentary structures are well known and largely described on the foreset and toeset of Gilbert-type fan delta (Postma, 1984; Massari, 1984, 1996; Nemec, 1990). In carbonate depositional systems these type of bedforms are rarely found and only little described. The backset-bedded units, here analysed, are channel-like, wedge-shaped, 10 - 12 m thick, pinching out landward and extend laterally for tens of meters. Each unit is formed by several amalgamated set of backset beds, 40 cm to 2 m thick. These units are mainly conglomerates composed by bioclastic coarse-grained grainstone to rudstone. Large components are rhodoliths, bivalves, skeletal and ooid-rich pebbles to boulders, gastropods and corals. Matrix is of a bioclastic coarse-grained sand to fine gravel, made of fragments of bivalves, gastropods, rhodoliths, bryozoans, algae, echinoids, loose ooids and planktonic and benthic foraminifera. Ooids are locally very abundant both in matrix and as main components of pebbles. Pebbles are mainly flattened, elongated, of average size 6 - 8 cm (a-axis) and sometimes have mollusc borings on their surface: large (20 - 30 cm) rounded and spherical boulders are locally present. Intergranular and intergranular porosity is very high, cementation low and dolomitization patchy. Foreset laminae dip upslope with varying angles ranging from almost horizontal to 30 °; higher angles are mostly found in the basinward part of the unit. Lamination is underline by the orientation along laminae of coarser components especially of bivalves, pebbles and rhodoliths. Grain-size distribution has a particular trend that shows a progressive decrease in size landwards and upwards. Sorting may noticeably vary being high or absent in different bodies. The lower boundary of the backset-bedded units is represented by scour surfaces which, on a parallel-to-flow section are almost concordant with the stratification below, while on a perpendicular-to-flow section are concave-up shaped, presenting the very steep walls. The study of different outcrops along the coast evidenced some important variation in components: moving northward composition changed from almost completely rhodolithic-dominated to rhodolith-bivalve-ooid-pebble-dominated to bivalve-ooid-pebble-dominated with first findings of corals. Upslope bedform migration has been explained as forming when a supercritical flow encounters a local obstruction or a local break on the slope, and a hydraulic jump may occur within the flow, upcurrent from the obstruction. Sediment will be therefore deposited at the obstruction forming an up-flow-dipping slipface that will tend to accrete and migrate in the upflow direction (Nemec, 1990 and reference therein). The backset deposits of Menorca are found in deep-water settings but they are composed of shallow-water sediment. The formation of these backset beds is interpreted {{to be related to}} high energy storm-events able to remove sediment from shallow water and to transport it into deeper position. The sediment-rich outgoing flows channalized and accelerated along slide-scar axis, eroding and rapidly infilling up-slope the scours. In this portion of the ramp preservation potential is higher thanks to sediment deposition which buries and preserves these structures. The repetitive occurrence of backset bedded units within the outer-ramp sediments and the progressive variation in composition suggest that those processes where probably active at the transition between the ramp and the reef systems. Therefore the formation of these sedimentary structures is interpreted to be strictly link to concurrence of peculiar morphological features, hydrodynamic energy and grain-size availability. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) numerical simulation have been performed as an integrated part of this work to improve the understanding of the development of hydraulic jumps within concentrated density flows. The simulated parameters do not refer to the example of Menorca but to turbidity currents for which finer-grain size (sand-size) have been used in a smaller-scale topography compared to the one studied in outcrop. The work presented proposes some new stating points for further simulations to constrain more precisely the main parameters controlling and determining the occurrence of a hydraulic jump and the consequent deposition of sediment with backset bedding...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is the {{reconstruction}} of the Plio-Quatenary tectonic evolution of the hinge zone between the northern Sicilian orogen, with a moderate thickened crust, and Southern Tyrrhenian margin, characterized by crustal thinning, to constrain a seismotectonic evolutionary model of non coaxial deformation in a simple shear regime, of the southern Tyrrhenian area. The research has been carried out through a multidisciplinary approach in which the new morphotectonic, geological and structural data, acquired also in the emerged and submerged sectors, have been integrated and interpreted in light of seismological and statistical ones. The studied area is located on the western sector of the Northern Sicily and its Tyrrhenian off-shore {{that are part of the}} Sicilian Maghrebides, an W–E trending southverging thrust belt, showing an <b>axial</b> <b>depression</b> in north-eastern Sicily, where the southern sector of the Calabrian arc (Peloritani Mts.) overthrust both the Sicilidi units (Nebrodi Mts.) and the most external units of the chain (Panormide, Imerese, Trapanese and Saccense), these latter characterizing the research area. The architecture of the Sicilian thrust belt is the result of a multiple-phase tectonic history from Late Oligocene-Early Miocene to Present, characterized by compressional, extensional, and transcurrent events. The first compressional phase, responsible of the thrust belt building, is represented by fold associations, in places cleavage and foliation, thrust and contractional faults. All these features shortened the original paleotectonic domains by flat-ramp, duplex, enveloping, and breaching geometries. In the late Miocene the activation of low-angle north-striking extensional faults produced a general stretching of the belt by the re-orientation and inversion of pre-existing structures. Since Early Pliocene a brittle phase produced a complicated grid of highangle strike-slip faults, consisting of two different systems: the first, NW-SE to W–E trending, right-lateral, and the second, N–S to NE-SW trending, left-lateral. The strike slip tectonic is the results of non coaxial strain related to an W–E trending right-lateral regional shear zone, extended for about 300 km from Ustica-Eolie alignment to the “Pantelleria Rift”. This tectonic regime is still active as demonstrate the shallow crustal seismicity affecting the southern Tyrrhenian area. In order to better define the neotectonic pattern, after a general morphotectonic characterization, three key areas have been selected to carried out detailed morphostructural and structural analysis, which are: 1) The S. Vito lo Capo Peninsula, in the north-western sector of the studied area, where the neotectonic pattern is well exposed, also involving the Olocenic continental and marine deposits. 2) The area of M. te Kumeta ridge, in the southern sector of the Palermo Mountains, where the brittle and ductile strain partitioning has been reconstructed in detail. 3) The off-shore area, north from Palermo and Tapani, where the structural setting has been inferred from morpho-bathymetric and geological maps of the Southern Tyrrhenian basin. Moreover, in this last area a new seismological study has been carried out using published and new data on the southern Tyrrhenian seismicity, particularly on a portion of the Palermo 2002 Seismic sequence. On-land the morphostructural, structural and seismological analysis allowed to recognize and characterize brittle and ductile neotectonic geometries, as high-angle, enechêlon, net- and strike-slip fault systems, with associated fold systems, superimposed on inherited geometries connected to the previous Miocenic and late-Miocenic compressional and extensional tectonic phases. The reconstructed deformational pattern characterizes also emerged and submerged sectors, where the inferred neotectonic pattern shows a well coherence of the geometrical and dimensional characteristics of the on-shore one. This is represented by a complicated brittle grid of multiple overstepping high angle strike-slip faults, NWSE to W-E trending, right lateral, and a N-S to NE-SW trending, left lateral system faults producing, at every scale, associated minor order synthetic and antithetic riedel shear systems. The major strike-slip systems inducing also block and en-echélon fold axis clockwise rotations, in overstepping tranpressional areas. The recognized geometries both in the emerged and submerged areas seem to control the genesis and evolution of main morphostructures represented by tectonic depressions filled by plio-pleistocenic clastic deposits, coinciding with releasing zones, and interposed morphostructural highs in the restraining ones. The inversion of the stress on the acquired structural data, highlights a regional stress field characterized by a principal suborizontal maximum compressional axis, oriented about NW-SE, inducing a non coaxial deformation, in which is possible to justify all the recognized brittle and ductile structures. The collected data on the shallow crustal seismicity occurred in the southern Tyrrhenian area in the last 25 years, highlight a seismogenic band mainly located between 10 and 35 km depth, clustered around high-angle dipping planes well fitting the orientation of the outcropping fault systems. The focal mechanisms showing transpressional, compressional, transtensional and estensional kinematics, are the results of the mechanical heterogeneity of the rock volumes related to the polyphasic tectonic evolution of the area. The new seismological study has been carried out on a part of 2002 seismic sequence, using a database obtained by the integration of data recorded by the stations of the National Seismic Network with those recorded, in four months, from 7 three -components stations of a temporary network installed by INGV. In particular, about 40 seismic events, recorded by more than 40 seismic stations, occurred between September and December 2002, have been relocated using a procedure based on the HYPODD program, and an eight layers velocity model optimized relocating some thousands events of the southern Tyrrhenian. The focal mechanisms of such events have been determined using FPFIT code. The relocation of the hypocentres constrains the seismogenic volume responsible of the 2002 seismic sequence, between 5 and 20 Km depth. The new focal mechanisms shows, a mainly transcurrent kinematic for the mainshock, and globally an extreme variability of both kinematic and geometries of the seismogenic structures, supporting the mechanical complexity of seismogenic volume. The analysis of the new focal mechanisms, taking into account geological and mechanical constrains, shows that in the siesmogenic volume, the possible rupture surfaces correspond to minor order fault systems recognized in on-land studied area, or, in places, to inherited geometries (ramp-flat thrusts or low angle normal faults) as result of strain accomodation. In order to better characterize the seismogenic volume, the Coulomb stress changes related to the main event of the sequence have been also calculated. This study shows that the first events of the sequence develop into the stress increasing areas, supposing as the possible seismogenic structure, a subvertical N-S trending faults, 10 kilometres extended, activated with a left-lateral kinematic. This inferred seismogenic structure could represent a second order fault system activate in a seismogenic volume, orientate along a principal NE-SW axis, coinciding with a restraining band, in which the geometric characters show the occurrence of a simple shear deformational style, according to the seismotectonic model of non coaxial deformation. La tematica affrontata nel percorso di approfondimento compiuto negli anni 2008 - 2010 attraverso questo Dottorato in Scienze della terra, prende spunto dall’osservazione che alcuni elementi acquisiti nel corso del lungo iter di studio che va avanti da diversi anni, relativamente a tematiche inizialmente relative alle relazioni tra evoluzione morfologica e assetto strutturale di alcune porzioni dell’area siciliana, non sempre trovavano una coerente e logica collocazione in un quadro generale gia' modellizzato. La necessita' di analizzare gli elementi legati all’evoluzione tettonica piu' recente dell’area siciliana, si configura per il fatto che la Sicilia si colloca in corrispondenza di un’area che viene considerata tra quelle sismicamente piu' “attive” dell’intero Mediterraneo, essendo stata la stessa in tempi “recenti” interessata da una intensa attivita' tettonica alla quale si associano elevati livelli di sismicita', tra i maggiori registrati nell’intera area centro-mediterranea. L’area che e' stata studiata nel presente lavoro di tesi riguarda la porzione occidentale della Sicilia settentrionale ed il suo antistante off-shore. Questi elementi si collocano in corrispondenza di un settore crostale che da un punto di vista geodinamico assume una notevole importanza per la comprensione dell’evoluzione dell’intera areasud tirrenica, costituendo essi una “zona di cerniera” in assottigliamento che raccorda il bacino tirrenico, caratterizzato da processi di oceanizzazione, e la porzione emersa della catena siciliana, costituita invece da una spessa crosta continentale. Nell’ultimo decennio si e' assistito al fiorire di ricerche a carattere multidisciplinare, che hanno riguardato proprio l’area in studio, tendenti all’elaborazione di modelli sismotettonici vincolati sia a dati geologico-strutturali sia a quelli geologico-geofisici; i modelli elaborati, tuttavia, non sempre sono risultati congruenti tra loro. Lo scopo del presente studio e' quello di acquisire elementi utili per la ricostruzione dell’evoluzione tettonica plio-quaternaria dell’area sud tirrenica, con particolare riferimento alla Sicilia occidentale ed al suo antistante off-shore, a supporto di un modello sismotettonico che sia coerente con i dati geologico-strutturali rilevati sul campo e con i dati derivati dall’analisi sismologica. Occorre subito precisare che per tutte le considerazioni relative al periodo Quaternario si fa riferimento alla tradizionale impostazione secondo la quale il limite tra il Pliocene ed il Quaternario viene posto in corrispondenza della base del Pleistocene a circa 1. 8 Ma, nel Calabriano, secondo la proposta INQUA del 1982 successivamente ratificata nel 2004 dall’ IUGS. Per portare avanti la ricerca e' stato utilizzato un approccio multisciplinare condotto attraverso l’acquisizione di dati geologico-strutturali, successivamente integrati con dati derivati dall’approfondimento degli aspetti geofisici ed in particolare quelli sismologici. Tali dati sono stati interpretati alla luce di studi morfotettonici e, per alcune valutazioni, anche attraverso l’utilizzo di analisi statistiche. · Le analisi di tipo geologico-strutturale rappresentano in uno studio come quello che e' stato condotto, l’elemento fondamentale per il riconoscimento e la caratterizzazione di strutture neotettoniche, eventualmente sismogeniche, a partire dalle osservazioni di campagna, oltre che per una serie di deduzioni relative all’interpretazione dell’evoluzione “recente” dell’area. Il rilevamento di campagna, effettuato in dettaglio in aree “chiave” ritenute di particolare importanza nel quadro regionale, infatti, ha consentito l’individuazione di strutture tettoniche, consentendo la discriminazione di strutture primarie e secondarie; inoltre, ha fornito gli elementi base per potere valutare la reciproca compatibilità tra strutture di ordine diverso e, nel complesso, la loro coerenza rispetto ad un campo di stress regionale. · L’approccio morfotettonico si e' reso necessario partendo dal presupposto che le deformazioni crostali recenti trovano la loro espressione in superficie essenzialmente attraverso la definizione della morfologia dei luoghi, contribuendo alla elaborazione del rilievo attraverso la produzione e/o la modificazione delle sue forme. E’ sembrato importante, in un’ottica di ricostruzione dell’evoluzione “recente” dell’area siciliana, non trascurare i segnali morfologici la cui valutazione talvolta e' risultata fondamentale per l’individuazione di strutture di recente attivita'. L’utilizzo di queste due metodologie basate su differenti approcci, ha rappresentato il punto di partenza per portare avanti lo studio per l’individuazione di strutture attive, attraverso l’integrazione di diversi tipi d’indagini, compiute a scala diversa. Si e' passati, infatti, dall’interpretazione d’immagini da satellite, a scala regionale, con successiva analisi dei dati in ambiente GIS, attraverso il supporto di un Modello Digitale del Terreno (DEM) ad alta risoluzione, all’analisi di foto aeree e di carte topografiche a varia scala, fino ad arrivare all’analisi del singolo affioramento, condotta a scala metrica. E’ stata condotta anche l’analisi dell’abbondante sismicita' che caratterizza l’area in studio, partendo ovviamente dall’acquisizione dei dati registrati dalle stazioni dell’INGV e pubblicati nei numerosi cataloghi. La conoscenza dei dati sismici e sismologici costituisce un elemento fondamentale per l’identificazione e caratterizzazione delle strutture simicamente attive. Sono stati utilizzati dati relativi alla sismicita' storica derivati dai cataloghi, ma sono stati anche analizzati numerosi dati sismologici, anche inediti, relativi alla sismicita' piu' recente per alcune valutazioni relative alle implicazioni sismotettoniche. Per ricostruire il significato di alcune delle strutture individuate e il ruolo che queste assumono nell’evoluzione recente dell’area sud tirrenica, infine, con l’ausilio di alcuni ricercatori del Dipartimento di Scienze della Terra e del Mare dell’Università di Palermo e della Sezione di Geologia della Scuola di Scienze e Tecnologia dell’Università di Camerino, e' stato condotto uno studio specifico sulle piu' recenti sequenze sismiche che hanno interessato l’area in studio. Si fa particolare riferimento alla sequenza sismica che nel settembre 2002 ha interessato l’area sud-tirrenica; tale sequenza sismica a partire da un mainshock di M 5. 6 si e' protratta con fasi di maggiore e minore intensità fino a novembre 2002. Gli eventi registrati dalle numerose reti locali sono stati rilocalizzati e i dati sismologici ricalcolati e reinterpretati e infine confrontati con lo stato di stress indotto dal mainshock della sequenza, acquisendo cosi' interessanti spunti di discussione...|$|E
