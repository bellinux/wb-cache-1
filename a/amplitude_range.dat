5000|$|A problem {{found with}} all UHF and higher {{frequencies}} is {{the prevalence of}} multipath signals. The reflective properties of the 70-centimeter band allow signals to be reflected by dense and solid material such as cement or rock. This creates a slight time delay between the primary and reflected signals, causing cancellations as direct and reflected signals are combined in the receiving antenna. This can cause receiving stations to experience rapid fluctuations in signal strength, or [...] "picket fencing", {{when they are in}} motion. The problem is much less severe with modern FM systems because the receiver's limiter circuitry compensates for variations in received signal strength over a very wide <b>amplitude</b> <b>range.</b> In properly engineered systems, multipath can also be reduced by assuring that the transmitter uses only the minimum necessary power, allowing the reflected signals to be lower than the receiver's detection threshold.|$|E

5000|$|The rise of {{piezoelectric}} {{technology is}} directly related to a set of inherent advantages. The high modulus of elasticity of many piezoelectric materials is comparable to that of many metals and goes up to 106 N/m². Even though piezoelectric sensors are electromechanical systems that react to compression, the sensing elements show almost zero deflection. This gives piezoelectric sensors ruggedness, an extremely high natural frequency and an excellent linearity over a wide <b>amplitude</b> <b>range.</b> Additionally, piezoelectric technology is insensitive to electromagnetic fields and radiation, enabling measurements under harsh conditions.

In this study, we investigated the seasonality of the total newly notified pulmonary TB cases by subgroups such as time period, sex, age, occupation, district, and sputum smear result from 2004 to 2013 in Wuhan by a popular seasonal adjustment model (TRAMO-SEATS). METHODS: Monthly pulmonary TB cases from 2004 to 2013 in Wuhan were analyzed by the TRAMO-SEATS seasonal adjustment program. Seasonal amplitude was calculated and compared within the subgroups. RESULTS: From 2004 to 2013, there were 77. 76 thousand newly notified pulmonary TB cases in Wuhan, China. There was a dominant peak spring peak (March) with seasonal amplitude of 56. 81 % and a second summer peak (September) of 43. 40 %, compared with the trough month (December). The spring seasonal amplitude in 2004 - 2008 was higher than that of 2009 - 2013 (P 0. 05). However, there were significant differences in spring seasonal amplitude by occupation, with <b>amplitude</b> <b>ranging</b> from 59. 37 % to 113. 22 % (P 0. 05). There were significant differences in summer seasonal amplitude by age, with <b>amplitude</b> <b>ranging</b> from 36. 05 % to 100. 09 % (P< 0. 05). Also, there were significant differences in summer seasonal amplitude by occupation, with <b>amplitude</b> <b>ranging</b> from 43. 40 % to 109. 88 % (P< 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: There was an apparent seasonal variation in pulmonary TB cases in Wuhan. We speculated that spring peak in our study was most likely caused by the increased reactivation of the latent TB due to vitamin D deficiency and high PM 2. 5 concentration, while the summer peak was mainly resulted from the enhanced winter transmission due to indoor crowding in winter, overcrowding of public transportation over the period of the Spring Festival and health care seeking delay in winter...|$|R
