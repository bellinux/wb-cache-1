5|$|Mike Smith was {{the latest}} goaltender to score <b>a</b> <b>goal</b> in the NHL, which he managed {{to do in a}} 5–2 victory of the Phoenix Coyotes over the Detroit Red Wings on October 19, 2013.

500|$|Next to Malone's {{achievement}} of five different games, both Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux attained the feat four times, Newsy Lalonde did it three times, while four other players {{have had two}} five-goal games. Of the 60 different five-goal games, five instances were achieved in a playoff game. Mario Lemieux is the only player in history to achieve a five-goal game by scoring in five different ways [...] on December 31, 1988, he scored <b>an</b> even-strength <b>goal,</b> <b>a</b> power-play <b>goal,</b> <b>a</b> short-handed <b>goal,</b> <b>a</b> penalty shot <b>goal</b> and <b>an</b> empty net <b>goal.</b>|$|R
50|$|In Canadian {{football}} teams often opt {{to go for}} <b>a</b> field <b>goal</b> (worth 3 points) rather than attempt a touchdown. The rugby equivalent is <b>a</b> drop <b>goal</b> (worth 3 points in union and only one in league). The key difference between <b>a</b> field <b>goal</b> and <b>a</b> drop <b>goal</b> is that <b>a</b> field <b>goal</b> attempt is normally kicked with a teammate holding the ball, whereas in rugby the ball must hit the ground and be kicked from a half-volley.|$|R
5|$|After {{six games}} without <b>a</b> <b>goal</b> and some {{criticism}} from supporters, manager Pulis revealed that Jones has had personal problems which have affected his performances. He ended this run with <b>a</b> <b>goal</b> against Everton on New Year's Day. However, he again went on <b>a</b> <b>goal</b> drought {{this time for}} three months before scoring against Tottenham Hotspur in April. He then went on a similar scoring run he had {{at the start of}} the season scoring against Bolton Wanderers at Wembley, Aston Villa, Wolverhampton Wanderers and then had an opportunity to become the first Stoke player to score in four consecutive Premier League matches against Blackpool but he missed an open goal. He made amends the following match scoring against Arsenal in a 3–1 win. Jones played in the 2011 FA Cup Final as Stoke lost 1–0 to Manchester City, he had Stoke's best chance in the match going through one on one with Joe Hart who saved Jones' effort. Jones ended the 2010–11 as joint top goalscorer with Jonathan Walters, both scored 12 goals. Jones said that he had a 'topsy-turvy' first season at Stoke.|$|E
5|$|Another {{high-profile}} clash came {{more than}} 20 years later, {{in the final}} of the FA Cup on 12 May 1979. A capacity crowd saw Arsenal take a 2–0 lead in the first half thanks to goals from Brian Talbot and Frank Stapleton, and with just five minutes left on the clock their lead was still intact. Then, in the 86th minute, Gordon McQueen pulled <b>a</b> <b>goal</b> back for United, and two minutes later they equalised with <b>a</b> <b>goal</b> from Sammy McIlroy. However, barely a minute after United equalised, Arsenal's Alan Sunderland scored an 89th-minute goal to win the cup 3–2 for Arsenal.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> {{short-term}} <b>goal</b> {{is something}} to be accomplished {{in a short period of}} time, such as trying to get a bill paid in the next few days. There is no specific length of time related to the definition of <b>a</b> short-term <b>goal.</b> That is to say, <b>a</b> short term <b>goal</b> may be achieved in a day, week, month, year, etc. The time frame for <b>a</b> short-term <b>goal</b> is related to its context in the overall timeline that it is being applied to. For instance, <b>a</b> short-term <b>goal</b> for <b>a</b> month long project may be measured in days where as <b>a</b> short-term <b>goal</b> for someone’s life might be measured by months or years. Short-term goals are usually defined in relation to <b>a</b> long-term <b>goal</b> or goals.|$|R

50|$|In American {{football}} teams often opt {{to go for}} <b>a</b> field <b>goal</b> (worth 3 points) rather than attempt a touchdown, either because it is fourth down and they don't want to risk a turnover or because it is {{late in the game}} and the three points will either tie the game or put the team ahead. The rugby equivalent is <b>a</b> drop <b>goal</b> (worth 3 points). The key difference between <b>a</b> field <b>goal</b> and <b>a</b> drop <b>goal</b> is that <b>a</b> field <b>goal</b> attempt is normally kicked with a teammate holding the ball, whereas in rugby the ball must hit the ground and be kicked immediately as it touches the ground.|$|R

50|$|There {{are times}} when having {{specific}} <b>goals</b> is not <b>a</b> best option; {{this is the case}} when the goal requires new skills or knowledge. Tunnel vision is a consequence of specific goals; if a person is too focused on attaining <b>a</b> specific <b>goal,</b> he or she may ignore the need to learn new skills or acquire new information. In situations like this, the best option is to set <b>a</b> learning <b>goal.</b> <b>A</b> learning <b>goal</b> is <b>a</b> generalized <b>goal</b> to achieve knowledge in a certain topic or field, but it can ultimately lead to better performance in specific goals related to the learning goals.|$|R
5|$|Gould {{was first}} capped for Wales against England {{in the opening}} game of the 1885 Home Nations Championship.

Played under the captaincy of Newport team-mate Charlie Newman, this was Wales' eighth-ever international and fourth encounter with England. The Welsh lost by <b>a</b> <b>goal</b> and a try to <b>a</b> <b>goal</b> and four tries. Wing Martyn Jordan of London Welsh scored both Welsh tries, with one successfully converted into <b>a</b> <b>goal.</b> Some accounts award the conversion to Charles Taylor, though it is now generally credited to Gould. Gould was selected for the second game of the tournament, an away draw to Scotland, in which both teams played a pair of brothers; George and Richard Maitland for Scotland, and Arthur and Bob Gould for Wales.|$|E

50|$|Short-term goals expect {{accomplishment}} in a {{short period}} of time, such as trying to get a bill paid in the next few days. The definition of <b>a</b> short-term <b>goal</b> need not relate to any specific length of time. In other words, one may achieve (or fail to achieve) <b>a</b> short-term <b>goal</b> in <b>a</b> day, week, month, year, etc. The time-frame for <b>a</b> short-term <b>goal</b> relates to its context in the overall time line that it is being applied to. For instance, one could measure <b>a</b> short-term <b>goal</b> for <b>a</b> month-long project in days; whereas one might measure <b>a</b> short-term <b>goal</b> for someone's lifetime in months or in years. Planners usually define short-term goals in relation to long-term goals.|$|R
