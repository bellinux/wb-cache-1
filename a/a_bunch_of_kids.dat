500|$|When Shannon and Swift {{began writing}} {{the script for}} Friday the 13th, they imposed some rules based on their {{experiences}} of writing Freddy vs. Jason on themselves. They wanted their teenage characters to [...] "sound normal". Shannon and Swift {{said they did not}} want the characters to know Jason's name or to become what they considered [...] "the Scooby-Doo cliché where it's <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>kids</b> trying to figure something out". The writers also wanted to distance themselves from self-referential slasher films such as Scream and to give the film a gritty, more 1980s feel that had been lost in recent films. They wanted to create a quick, loose Jason. The writing team decided to create a version of Jason [...] "who was actually in the woods surviving off the land", and whose killings are presented as a way of defending his territory rather than randomly murdering whoever came along.|$|E
500|$|Others {{were more}} {{tempered}} in their praise. James Poniewozik of Time said the episode was [...] "grounded" [...] and [...] "solid-if-not-spectacular", and highlighted how Glee [...] "has {{developed into a}} broad ensemble, where any of several characters is capable of taking the spotlight, even an originally comic-relief character like Brittany." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club and the Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson both liked the episode—VanDerWerff gave it a [...] "B+"—but they, like Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone who was less complimentary, were disappointed that it failed to measure {{up to the last}} time New Directions competed in Sectionals. VanDerWerff wrote, [...] "When the show [...] remains, at some level, a show about <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>kids</b> who just love to sing and dance and maybe have wacky adventures on the side, it remains fundamentally strong, as it does tonight." [...] He also stated, [...] "The fact that the Warblers and New Directions tied, while probably necessary for whatever reason, is ridiculously anticlimactic and keeps this episode from an A- pretty much singlehandedly." ...|$|E

500|$|Also in December, {{the music}} video for [...] "I'm Made of Wax, Larry, What Are You Made Of?" [...] was filmed, {{directed}} by Dan Dobi. In early March 2010 the band announced via their Twitter account that the video {{was set for}} release, with a date of March 16. This was further confirmed a few days later, with some fans being able to view it before its release. A delay in releasing it occurred as the band were trying to negotiate with MTV, as Westfall commented: [...] "I think it's more important to have them [...] on board, instead of just putting it on, like, YouTube." [...] "Have Faith in Me" [...] was released as a radio single on March 2, 2010. The video for [...] "I'm Made of Wax, Larry, What Are You Made Of?" [...] had its television premiere on MTV on March 16. The music video {{was based on an}} idea from a friend Kyle Crawford, as McKinnon said: [...] "He was like, 'Hey, you should totally make a video where you guys are playing kickball and you play <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>kids</b> and just kick the s*** out of them?" [...] I was like, [...] "That is a great idea. Let's look into it.'" [...] Asked why it was the band's next music video, Westfall said [...] "it stands out compared to the other songs" [...] as [...] "it's a harder song." [...] The song was also released as a radio single.|$|E

[...] In regard to his post-political future, he said, [...] "Maybe I'll write a screenplay, or maybe a fiction book based loosely on what all of this was like. You had <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>kids</b> working on this {{campaign}} together, and it was such a mix of the serious and momentous and just the silly ways that we are.

I still scratch my head and say, 'How in the hell did they make it?' They used to practice in my living room here – a lot of the songs they did on Dookie. You hear it coming together, and you don't expect people are going to go out and buy it. But when it does, you just say, 'Wow that's so cool.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{novel is}} {{told in the}} first-person voice by various characters, and each short chapter is told from a {{different}} character's perspective. Linguistic drift has given the people of Eden unique nouns ("police veekle", [...] "rayed yoh", and [...] "Jesus Juice" [...] instead of [...] "police vehicle", [...] "radio", and [...] "Jesus and the Jews"). The adverb [...] "very" [...] has dropped from the language, and emphasis is created by reduplication ("bad bad" [...] instead of [...] "very bad"). Linguistic relativity has yet to set in, so that Family lacks words to describe much of their world ("Cold Dark" [...] instead of [...] "high, dark mountain wreathed in glaciers"). Beckett said he adopted the unsophisticated, childish language of the Edenites after realizing he had crafted {{a society in which}} [...] "the Eden settlers were <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>kids</b> and two adults... There's no external adult world as a reference point". With the two adults constantly speaking baby-talk to their children, pre-teens and teens never adopted more adult ways of speaking.|$|E
2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1979 {{the band}} felt {{confident}} enough to start recording their songs, and approached local musician Bob Lamb as {{he was the only}} person they knew with any recording experience. Lamb had been the drummer with the Steve Gibbons Band for much of the 1970s and was a well-known figure within the Birmingham music scene. He remembered that [...] "'King' was the very first song they ever played to me, and it just blew my mind basically, to realise <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>kids</b> could make a sound like that... it blew me away. And that was it for me, I was hooked, it was a bit like Elvis walks in or something, you know, {{it was one of those}} moments." [...] However, as the band were unable to afford a proper recording studio, the album was recorded in Lamb's own home at the time, a ground-floor flat in a house on Cambridge Road in Birmingham's Moseley district that later became affectionately known as the [...] "Home of the Hits". Lamb would later use the money he earned from the album's success to build a proper recording studio, Highbury Studio, in an old cricket bat factory in nearby Kings Heath, which remained under his ownership until his retirement in 2010 – during the 1980s and 90s he would go on to produce the early demos for Duran Duran and work on the debut albums by fellow Birmingham natives Ruby Turner, The Lilac Time and Ocean Colour Scene. However, in an interview to mark Signing Offs 30th anniversary, Brian Travers recalled just how basic the recording facilities of the original Cambridge Road [...] "studio" [...] really were: ...|$|E

It wasn’t until they were a little older and wiser that they really got their sound in the studio with Diamond Dreamer. However, by this time, Ronald had left for personal reasons and they found Israeli singer Shmoulik Avigal. Not only was the recording done much better, but Shmoulik had a different, and some say, more powerful voice. Many consider Diamond Dreamer as the band’s best album.|$|R
