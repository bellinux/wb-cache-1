The findings {{support the view that}} each is indeed a separate concept, though each are, as hypothesised, related. The strongest individual level correlations are observed between attitudinal <b>loyalty</b> <b>and</b> purchase <b>loyalty,</b> supporting previous findings that attitudes are more strongly correlated with current/past behaviour than future behaviour.

To date, more than 15,000 cadets have received their private pilot licence through the scholarship course. Training shifted to be focused on the development of citizenship and an interest in aviation. Interest was renewed; by 1961, 332 squadrons were in existence and in 1972, authority was given for membership of up to 28,000 cadets.|$|E

40|$|The study {{examined}} {{the main effect of}} the reward channel and reward time of customer loyalty programs for on-offline shopping channels; in addition, it investigated the interaction effect of the reward channels and merchandise as well as the interaction effect of the reward time and merchandise. An online apparel shopping web experiment was conducted with a 2 (reward channel: online channel reward vs. offline chan-nel reward) × 2 (reward time: immediate vs. delayed) × 2 (merchandise: online channel product vs. offline channel products) between-subject factorial design. An online shopping channel was considered the core-shopping channel and a department store was considered the cross-shopping channel.

5|$|By 1800, the {{increased}} agricultural productivity had allowed Nguyễn Ánh {{to support a}} sizable army of more than 30,000 soldiers and a navy of more than 1,200 vessels. The surplus from the state granary was sold to European and Asian traders to facilitate the importation of raw materials for military purposes, in particular iron, bronze, and sulfur. The government also purchased castor sugar from local farmers and traded it for weapons from European manufacturers. The food surplus allowed Nguyễn Ánh to engage in welfare initiatives that improved morale <b>and</b> <b>loyalty</b> among his subjects, thereby increasing his support base. The surplus grain was deposited in granaries built along the northward route out of Saigon, following the advance of the Nguyễn army into Tây Sơn territory. This allowed his troops to be fed from southern supplies, rather than eating from the areas that he was attempting to conquer or win over. Newly acquired regions were given tax exemptions, and surrendered Tây Sơn mandarins were appointed to equivalent positions with the same salaries in the Nguyễn administration.|$|E
5|$|Diệm {{kept the}} control of the nation firmly within the hands of his {{brothers}} and their in-laws, and promotions in the ARVN were given on the basis of religion <b>and</b> <b>loyalty</b> rather than merit. Two unsuccessful attempts had been made to depose Diệm; in 1960, a paratroop revolt was quashed after Diệm stalled negotiations to buy time for loyalists to put down the coup attempt, while a 1962 palace bombing by two air force pilots failed to kill him. South Vietnam's Buddhist majority had long been discontented with Diệm's strong favoritism towards Catholics. Public servants and army officers had long been promoted on the basis of religious preference, and government contracts, US economic assistance, business favors and tax concessions were preferentially given to Catholics. The Roman Catholic Church was the largest landowner in the country, and its holdings were exempt from land reform. In the countryside, Catholics were de facto exempt from performing corvée labour. Discontent with Diệm and Nhu exploded into mass protest during the summer of 1963 when nine Buddhists died at the hand of Diệm's army and police on Vesak, the birthday of Gautama Buddha.|$|E
5|$|Heathenry {{does not}} have a unified {{theology}} and is typically polytheistic, centering on a pantheon of deities from pre-Christian Germanic Europe. It adopts cosmological views from these religions, including an animistic view of the cosmos in which the natural world is imbued with spirits. The faith's deities and these spirits are honored in sacrificial rites known as blóts in which food and libations are offered to them. These are often accompanied by symbel, the act of ceremonially toasting the gods with an alcoholic beverage. Some practitioners also engage in rituals designed to induce an altered state of consciousness and visions, most notably seiðr and galdr, with the intent of gaining wisdom and advice from the deities. Although many solitary practitioners follow the religion by themselves, members of the Heathen community often assemble in small groups, usually known as kindreds or hearths, to perform their rites outdoors or in specially constructed buildings. Heathen ethical systems emphasize honor, personal integrity, <b>and</b> <b>loyalty,</b> while beliefs about an afterlife vary and are rarely emphasized.|$|E
