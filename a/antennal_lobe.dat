Perceiving different odors leads to different subsets of neurons firing on different sets of oscillatory cycles. [...] These oscillations can be disrupted by GABA blocker picrotoxin, and the disruption of the oscillatory synchronization leads to impairment of behavioral discrimination of chemically similar odorants in bees and to more similar responses across odors in downstream β-lobe neurons. Recent follow-up of this work has shown that oscillations create periodic integration windows for Kenyon cells in the insect mushroom body, such that incoming spikes from the <b>antennal</b> <b>lobe</b> are more effective in activating Kenyon cells only at specific phases of the oscillatory cycle.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Previous {{findings}} showed that {{high levels of}} octopamine and serotonin in the <b>antennal</b> <b>lobes</b> of adult worker honey bees are associated with foraging behavior, and octopamine treatment induces precocious foraging. To better characterize the relationship be-tween amines and foraging behavior in honey bees, we performed a detailed correlative analysis of amine levels in the <b>antennal</b> <b>lobes</b> {{as a function of}} various aspects of foraging behavior. Flight activity was measured under controlled conditions in a large outdoor flight cage. Lev-els of octopamine in the <b>antennal</b> <b>lobes</b> were found to be elevated immediately subsequent to the onset of forag-ing, but they did not change as a consequence of prefor-aging orientation flight activity, diurnal pauses in forag-ing, or different amounts of foraging experience, suggesting that octopamine helps to trigger and main-tain the foraging behavioral state. In contrast, levels of serotonin and dopamine did not show changes that would implicate them as either causal agents of foraging, or as neurochemical systems affected by the act of for-aging. Serotonin treatment had no effect on the likeli-hood of foraging. These results provide further support for the hypothesis that an increase in octopamine levels in the <b>antennal</b> <b>lobes</b> plays a causal role in the initiation and maintenance of the behavioral state of foraging, and thus is involved in the regulation of division of labor i...|$|R
40|$|Background: Optical Projection Tomography (OPT) is a {{microscopic}} technique that generates three dimensional images from whole mount samples {{the size of}} which exceeds the maximum focal depth of confocal laser scanning microscopes. As an advancement of conventional emission-OPT, Scanning Laser Optical Tomography (SLOTy) allows simultaneous detection of fluorescence and absorbance with high sensitivity. In the present study, we employ SLOTy in a paradigm of brain plasticity in an insect model system. Methodology: We visualize and quantify volumetric changes in sensory information procession centers in the adult locust, Locusta migratoria. Olfactory receptor neurons, which project from the antenna into the brain, are axotomized by crushing the antennal nerve or ablating the entire antenna. We follow the resulting degeneration and regeneration in the olfactory centers (<b>antennal</b> <b>lobes</b> and mushroom bodies) by measuring their size in reconstructed SLOTy images {{with respect to the}} untreated control side. Within three weeks post treatment <b>antennal</b> <b>lobes</b> with ablated antennae lose as much as 60 % of their initial volume. In contrast, <b>antennal</b> <b>lobes</b> with crushed <b>antennal</b> nerves initially shrink as well, but regain size back to normal within three weeks.

A multiphoton microscopy set-up allowed in vivo calcium imaging recording of the <b>antennal</b> <b>lobes</b> at milliseconds resolution. Functional calcium imaging permits recording of the odour stimuli response maps of the functional units, the glomeruli.

40|$|Butterflies are {{believed}} to use mainly visual cues when searching for food and oviposition sites despite that their olfactory system is morphologically similar to their nocturnal relatives, the moths. The olfactory ability in butterflies has, however, not been thoroughly investigated. Therefore, we performed the first study of odour representation in the primary olfactory centre, the <b>antennal</b> <b>lobes,</b> of butterflies. Host plant range is highly variable within the butterfly family Nymphalidae, with extreme specialists and wide generalists found even among closely related species.

The butterflies responded with stimulus-specific combinations of activated glomeruli to single plant-related compounds and to extracts of host and non-host plants. In general, responses were similar between the species. However, the specialist A. urticae responded more specifically to its preferred host plant, stinging nettle, than P. c-album.

40|$|Integrins are cell {{adhesion}} molecules that mediate numerous developmental processes {{in addition to}} a variety of acute phys-iological events. Two reports implicate a Drosophila b integrin, bPS, in olfactory behavior. To further investigate the role of integ-rins in Drosophila olfaction, we used Gal 4 -driven expression of RNA interference (RNAi) transgenes to knock down expression of myospheroid (mys), the gene that encodes bPS. Expression of mys-RNAi transgenes in the wing reduced bPS immunostaining and produced morphological defects associated with loss-of-function mutations in mys, demonstrating that this strategy knocked down mys function. Expression of mys-RNAi transgenes in the antennae, <b>antennal</b> <b>lobes,</b> and mushroom bodies via two Gal 4 lines, H 24 and MT 14, disrupted olfactory behavior but did not alter locomotor abilities or central nervous system structure. Olfactory behavior was normal in flies that expressed mys-RNAi transgenes via other Gal 4 lines that specifically tar-geted the antennae, the projection neurons, the mushroom bodies, bitter and sweet gustatory neurons, or Pox neuro neurons. Our studies confirm that mys is important for the development or function of the Drosophila olfactory system. Additionally, our studies demonstrate thatmys is required for normal behavioral responses to both aversive and attractive odorants.

40|$|Odours are {{represented}} as unique combinations of activated glomeruli in the <b>antennal</b> <b>lobes</b> of insects. Receptor neurons arborizing in the glomeruli {{are not only}} qualitatively selective, but in addition respond to variations in stimulus concentration. As each glomerulus likely represents a single receptor neuron type, optical recordings of calcium changes in insect <b>antennal</b> <b>lobes</b> show how concentration variations affect a large population of afferents. We measured the glomerular responses in the moth Spodoptera littoralis to different concentrations of plant-related odorants. Localized calcium responses were shown to correspond to individual glomeruli. We found that the dynamic range of glomerular responses spanned 3 - 4 log units of concentration and the most strongly responding glomeruli often reached a plateau at high stimulus doses. Further, we showed that the single most active glomerulus was often not the same across concentrations. However, if the principal glomerulus moved, it was generally to an adjacent or proximal glomerulus. As concentration increased, a higher number of glomeruli became activated. Correlations of glomerular representations of the same compound at different doses decreased as the difference in concentration increased. Moreover, representations evoked by different odorants were more correlated at high than at low doses, {{which means that the}} uniqueness of activity patterns decreased with increasing concentration. Thus, if odours are coded as spatial patterns of glomerular activity, as has been suggested, these olfactory codes are not persistent across concentrations...|$|R
5000|$|... 3) Lastly, {{there is}} {{evidence}} that the male <b>antennal</b> <b>lobe</b> contains male-specific macroglomerular complex projection neurons that relay pheromone information to higher brain structures in the protocerebrum. Since males have significantly larger populations of medial group <b>antennal</b> <b>lobe</b> neurons, it is thought that some of these extra neurons may belong to this male-specific class. Kanzaki et al. have since characterized the responses and structures of some of these projection neurons, and have found that projection neurons with dendritic arborizations in the macroglomerular complex and ordinary glomeruli were excited or inhibited by different stimuli (pheromonal vs. non-pheromonal stimuli respectively). These selective response properties indicate that a specialized role in relaying pheromone information is likely.|$|E
5000|$|Mushroom {{bodies are}} {{largest in the}} Hymenoptera, which {{are known to have}} {{particularly}} elaborate control over olfactory behaviours. However, since mushroom bodies are found in anosmic primitive insects, their role is likely to extend beyond olfactory processing. Anatomical studies suggest a role in the processing of visual and mechanosensory input in some species. [...] In Hymenoptera in particular, subregions of the mushroom body neuropil are specialized to receive olfactory, visual, or both types of sensory input. In Hymenoptera, olfactory input is layered in the calyx. In ants, several layers can be discriminated that correspond to different clusters of glomeruli in the antennal lobes, perhaps corresponding to different classes of odors. There are two main groups of projection neurons that divide the <b>antennal</b> <b>lobe</b> into two main regions, an anterior and a posterior. Projection neuron groups are segregated innervating glomeruli groups separately and sending axons by separate routes, either through the medial-antenno protocerebral tract (m-APT) or through the lateral-anteno protocerebral tract (l-APT), and connecting with two layers in the calyx of the mushroom bodies.

40|$|Timely {{decision}} making is crucial for survival and reproduction. Organisms often face a speed-accuracy trade-off, as fully informed, accurate decisions require time-consuming gathering and treatment of information. Optimal strategies for decision-making should therefore {{vary depending on the}} context. In mammals, there is mounting evidence that multiple systems of perceptual discrimination based on different neural circuits emphasize either fast responses or accurate treatment of stimuli depending on the context. We used the ant Camponotus aethiops to test the prediction that fast information processing achieved through direct neural pathways should be favored in situations where quick reactions are adaptive. Social insects discriminate readily between harmless group-members and dangerous strangers using easily accessible cuticular hydrocarbons as nestmate recognition cues. We show that i) tethered ants display rapid aggressive reactions upon presentation of non-nestmate odor (120 to 160 ms); ii) ants' aggressiveness towards non-nestmates can be specifically reduced by exposure to non-nestmate odor only, showing that social interactions are not required to alter responses towards non-nestmates; iii) decision-making by ants does not require information transfer between brain hemispheres, but relies on side-specific decision rules. Our results strongly suggest that first-order olfactory processing centers (up to the <b>antennal</b> <b>lobes)</b> are likely to {{play a key role in}} ant nestmate recognition. We hypothesize that the coarse level of discrimination achieved in the <b>antennal</b> <b>lobes</b> early in odor processing provides enough information to determine appropriate behavioral responses towards non-nestmates.

Here we investigated the roles of neurons possessing MEC-sensitive ACh receptors (MEC-sensitive neurons) in olfactory conditioning of salivation, monitored by changes in activities of salivary neurons, in cockroaches. Local and bilateral microinjection of MEC into {{each of the three}} olfactory centers, <b>antennal</b> <b>lobes,</b> calyces of the mushroom bodies and lateral protocerebra, impaired olfactory responses of salivary neurons, indicating that MEC-sensitive neurons in all olfactory centers participate in pathways mediating olfactory responses of salivary neurons. Conditioning of olfactory CS with sucrose US was impaired by injection of MEC into the <b>antennal</b> <b>lobes</b> or calyces, i. e., conditioned responses were absent even after recovery from MEC injection, suggesting that the CS-US association occurs in MEC-sensitive neurons in calyces (Kenyon cells) or in neurons in downstream pathways. In contrast, conditioned responses appeared after recovery from MEC injection into the lateral protocerebra, suggesting that MEC-sensitive neurons in the lateral protocerebra are downstream of the association sites. Since lateral protocerebra are major termination areas of mushroom body efferent neurons, we suggest that input synapses of MEC-sensitive Kenyon cells, or their output synapses upon mushroom body efferent neurons, are the sites for CS-US association for olfactory conditioning of salivation...|$|R

Inhibition of NO signaling with a NO synthase inhibitor or a NO scavenger early in development results in abnormal <b>antennal</b> <b>lobes</b> in which neuropil-associated glia fail to migrate. A more subtle effect is seen in the arborization of dendrites of a serotonin-immunoreactive neuron, which grow beyond their normal range. The effects of NO signaling in these types of cells do not appear to be mediated by activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase to produce cGMP, as these cells do not exhibit cGMP immunoreactivity following NO stimulation and are not affected by infusion of a soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor. Treatment with Novobiocin, which blocks ADP-ribosylation of proteins, results in a phenotype similar to those seen with blockade of NO signaling. Thus, axons of olfactory receptor cells appear to trigger glial cell migration and limit arborization of serotonin-immunoreactive neurons via NO signaling. The NO effect may be mediated in part by ADP-ribosylation of target cell proteins...|$|R
