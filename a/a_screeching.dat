5|$|In Boston, an {{undercover}} cop {{waits for the}} subway, alone. Suddenly, a suspicious man appears, jumping the fare barrier. Eventually, they both get onto a train and the police officer draws his gun as the man starts to walk towards him from behind. Suddenly, the subway comes to <b>a</b> <b>screeching</b> halt, flashes of light are seen, and the train loses power. Later, when the train is back up and running, a batch of commuters enter the subway car and find the undercover cop with the flesh on half his face and his left arm stripped down to the bone.|$|E
25|$|During {{this time}} period, the student {{publications}} appeared, such as The Cardinal (later replaced by The Razorback), {{as well as}} the Arkansas Traveler, the school's newspaper. Hill Hall, later demolished to make way for David W. Mullins Library, was constructed in 1901 as a boys' dormitory. Shortly thereafter, Buchanan retired to be replaced by Henry S. Hartzog, who was then followed by John N. Tillman. It was during Hartzog's tenure that Carnall Hall, a girls' dormitory, was built, and remains standing to this day. Tillman had been the selection of Governor Jeff Davis, and a blatantly political one at that. Such was the outrage of his predecessor, Hartzog, that the former president used his pulpit at the 1905 graduation, to rail against the decision as his last speech in an official capacity. Under Tillman, the tradition of Senior Walk was begun in 1905, the school officially changed its mascot from the cardinal to the razorback, as well was held the competition that selected the school's alma mater (won by Brodie Payne for a reward of $50). Tillman's presidency came to <b>a</b> <b>screeching</b> stop in 1912 due to student protests over a scandal concerning school finances, which resulted in the expulsion of 36 students, that in turn led to general strike by the entire student body that lasted four days. The student dislike of their president, joined {{with the support of the}} citizens of Fayetteville, was enough to lead the board of trustees to request Tillman's resignation. Tillman's popularity suffered little, as two years later, he was elected to the first of five terms as a United States Congressman.|$|E

Elliot Huntley offers a positive view, enjoying the song's [...] "pleasant melody" [...] and its [...] "continuation of the West Coast feel that commenced the album". Alan Clayson considers that [...] "Simply Shady" [...] would have benefited from a sparser musical arrangement, but he recognises an element of intrigue in Dark Horse, with Harrison revealed as [...] "an ex-Beatle in uncertain transition".|$|E

[...] Michael's indignation that this will put a damper on his easygoing office environment rises to outrage when he learns that the corporate headquarters is sending down a lawyer to talk to him. Michael and the warehouse staff mock the sexual harassment video, but the crude remarks come to <b>a</b> <b>screeching</b> halt when Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin) and the lawyer arrive from Corporate.|$|E

When Tammy shows up, it pretty much brings Ron to <b>a</b> <b>screeching</b> halt." [...] Mullally and Parks co-star Adam Scott also starred together in the Starz comedy series Party Down. [...] "Ron & Tammy: Part Two" [...] featured the last of several guest performances of Jama Williamson as Wendy, who revealed she was returning to her home country of Canada {{to care for her}} aging parents. Pawnee Police Chief Trumple was portrayed by Eric Pierpoint, who has played several police officers throughout his career, including an alien police officer in the science fiction series Alien Nation and a police chief in the superhero drama series The Cape.|$|E

The latter track has singer Joi calling upon the character, addressing him as [...] "soul brother number one", to [...] "shoot me with your bop gun". Both songs help establish the character as a [...] {{with a penchant for}} fast cars. However, the concept is not sustained in the following songs on the album. [...] "I Know Shuggie Otis" [...] is a tribute to psychedelic recording artist Shuggie Otis and features <b>a</b> <b>screeching</b> guitar solo.

500|$|Noting the realism in {{the writing}} for the series, Gilchrist stated: [...] "It's as if Rhimes and Co. {{harnessed}} the sublime and the mundane of our daily experiences, that strange sense of drama that emerges from even the most unimportant daily conflicts, and it transported it on {{a world that is}} legitimately fraught with life and death decisions." [...] However, he expressed disappointment in {{the end of the second}} season, which he deemed surprisingly less strong, compared to the [...] "powerful" [...] first half and the [...] "immaculate" [...] first season, describing Stevens' [...] "awkward and self-destructive" [...] relationship with a patient as a way to [...] "slow episodes to <b>a</b> <b>screeching</b> halt with maudlin and painfully underdeveloped turns towards melodrama", while expressing the predictability of Duquette's death. Gilchrist stated in response to Stevens' development in the last part of the second season: [...] "Izzie's descent into abject hysteria, which followed her season-long sanctimoniousness about everything, actually made me want something terrible to happen to her too." [...] He described how some episodes were not among the show's strongest, noting that the some plot lines created poignancy, and connected in an unfamiliar way.|$|E
500|$|Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times stated [...] "Director Peter Jackson, at {{home with}} all kinds of excess in New Zealand, keeps {{everything}} spinning nicely, not even losing a step when the mood turns increasingly disturbing." [...] Janet Maslin from The New York Times enjoyed The Frighteners, but [...] "walked out the theater with mixed emotions," [...] she commented that [...] "Peter Jackson deserves more enthusiasm for expert, imaginative effects than for his live actors anyhow. These lively touches would leave The Frighteners looking more like a more frantic Beetlejuice if Jackson's film weren't so wearyingly overcrowded. The Frighteners is not immune to overkill, even though most of its characters are already dead." [...] Jeff Vice of the Deseret News praised the acting in the film, with the performances of Fox and Alvarado in particular, but said that there were also [...] "bits that push the taste barrier too far and which grind things to <b>a</b> <b>screeching</b> halt", and that if [...] "Jackson had used the restraint he showed in Heavenly Creatures, the movie could have [...] "been the best of its kind". Critic Christopher Null praised the film, as he described it as a mixture between Ghostbusters and Twin Peaks. Michael Drucker of IGN said that although the film wouldn't make Jackson's top five of movies, it [...] "is a harmless and fun dark comedy that you'll enjoy casually watching from time to time". The Frighteners received mixed reviews from critics from Jackson's native country, New Zealand.|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} of the series, Martin called them as the [...] "most {{entertaining}} characters" [...] of the series and [...] "one of anime's liveliest and most entertaining couples". He described their constant glee as infectious and their [...] "bizarre logic" [...] as priceless. He felt that their presence [...] "elevates the series from merely {{a very good one}} to a truly exceptional one." [...] He believes that they always [...] "make the most of their screen time", noting how every one of their actions [...] "give an entirely new twist to the events otherwise playing out normally." [...] Carl Kimlinger, also from ANN, adds that [...] "the things those two can do to a well-laid plan are simply appalling." [...] Davey Jones of Active Anime felt the pair was the [...] "highlight of the story" [...] and should have their own series. Chris Beveridge from Mania Entertainment described the two as [...] "very off center in a colorful and fun way" [...] and believed they stood out from the large cast because they were [...] "far more outgoing." [...] He felt that the connections they make {{with the rest of the}} cast [...] "are fun to watch and there's only a kind of elegance to it". Beveridge commented that [...] "when this pair comes on the screen, [...] can‚Äôt help but smile" [...] and that he [...] "enjoy all of the scenes that involve [...] because they bring such a lighthearted aspect to the show that‚Äôs definitely needed to break up the more intense scenes." [...] DVD Talk's Todd Douglass felt that Isaac and Miria are [...] "the uplifting and energetic component of [...] show," [...] feeling that it is entertaining to see how they influenced the events. Nick Hartel, also from DVD Talk, believed that it would be cruel not to mention them. He described them to be filled with [...] "a maniac energy, often brought to <b>a</b> <b>screeching</b> halt by melodramatic breakdowns over trivial occurrences or bold assumptions." [...] Although he admit they seem to have to place in the series at first, he notes that their interactions with other characters [...] "causes a drastic shift in tone." [...] He comments that as the plot progresses, the pair [...] "become a bright spot as storylines take dark turns and serve as a reminder of the goodness that makes up the vast majority of the world." [...] Daryl Surat of the Anime World Order Podcast and quest Mike Toole believed that out of every other character in the ensemble cast, the pair are the [...] "default protagonists" [...] simply because they meet every other character. They also felt that if ignorance is bliss, they are the happiest people [...] "in the world" [...] because they are [...] "that stupid". The two characters were compared to Bonnie and Clyde, but the reviewers felt that were more like Blue Falcon and Dynomutt, characters from the animated series Dynomutt, Dog Wonder. Even if the events become grim, the reviewers could not help but smile as Isaac and Miria appear. ANN columnist Erin Finnegan described Isaac and Miria as [...] " [...] a couple of completely loveable weirdoes". She agreed that the subplot revolving around them [...] "takes some of the edge off the dark moments." [...] Amanda Tarbet of SequentialTart.com drew parallels between the duo and the trickster god archetype. She compared them to the kitsune of Japanese folklore, which are portrayed [...] "as tricksters, but also as nurturing characters such as guardians and friends". She felt that Isaac and Miria [...] "represent this duality perfectly." [...] Tarbet also described them as part Bonnie and Clyde and part Rodgers and Hammerstein.|$|E

Robinson reported that this action was inspired by Wojnarowicz's 1991 memoir Close to the Knives, which imagined [...] "what it would be like if, each time a lover, friend or stranger died of this disease, their friends, lovers or neighbors would take the dead body and drive with it in a car a hundred miles an hour to Washington DC and blast through the gates of the White House and come to <b>a</b> <b>screeching</b> halt before the entrance and dump their lifeless form on the front steps."

2500|$|Over the years, many Japanese nationalists {{argued that}} the attack on Pearl Harbor was {{justified}} as they acted in self-defense {{in response to the}} oil embargo imposed by the United States. Most historians and scholars agreed that the oil embargo cannot be used as justification for using military force against a foreign nation imposing the oil embargo because there is a clear distinction between a perception that something is essential to the welfare of the nation-state and a threat truly being sufficiently serious to warrant an act of force in response, which Japan failed to consider. Japanese scholar and diplomat, Takeo Iguchi, states that it is [...] "ard to say from the perspective of international law that exercising the right of self-defense against economic pressures is considered valid." [...] While Japan felt that its dreams of further expansion would be brought to <b>a</b> <b>screeching</b> halt by the American embargo, this [...] "need" [...] cannot be considered proportional with the destruction suffered by the U.S. Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, intended by Japanese military planners to be as comprehensive as possible.|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} of Bianca Jackson has received critical acclaim from critics and fans alike. EastEnders executive producer Diederick Santer has described Bianca as [...] "one {{of the most}} popular characters EastEnders has ever had", while James Rampton, journalist for The Independent, has commented that she is [...] "adored". Palmer has suggested that viewers [...] "rooted" [...] for Bianca because [...] "people love a stroppy girl". In 2000, she commented, [...] " [...] makes them laugh. A character like that is about living out your fantasies. Everybody would love to be like Bianca and really say what they think." [...] Following her exit from the serial in September 1999, Palmer said that members of the public would approach her to plead with her to return to EastEnders, as they missed her character and relationship with Ricky. She commented in 2000, [...] "It makes me feel bad. I sometimes think I should go back [...] for everyone else's sake." [...] When the character departed the serial in 1999, Molly Blake of the Birmingham Evening Post said [...] "Good riddance!" [...] She described Bianca as a [...] "king-sized pain in the backside [...] <b>A</b> <b>screeching</b> and screaming virago with a big mouth and pea-sized brain" [...] and a [...] "prize slapper [...] tormented all those whose paths [...] crossed." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the second}} year of production, the Acura TL was given {{slightly}} more features, including a 5-speed automatic transmission with SportShift. The added gear allowed for slightly better fuel economy and acceleration when compared to the previous 4-speed automatic transmission with SportShift. With this model, if the driver forgets the 1-2 shift the computer will take over when in sport mode and do the 1-2 up and down shifts, unlike the 4-speed 1999 model. In many vehicles, the 5-speed automatic transmission failed: as the third clutch pack wore, particles blocked off oil passages and prevented the transmission from shifting or holding gears normally. The transmission would slip, fail to shift, or suddenly downshift and make the car come to <b>a</b> <b>screeching</b> halt, even at freeway speeds. This problem was highlighted in the Los Angeles Times in September 2002. Consumer Reports took note and gave the TL and CL the black spot, the worst rating for transmission reliability. In response to the recurring problem, the manufacturer extended the warranty covering the transmission to 7 yrs or [...] on U.S.A. models. A class-action lawsuit was settled to extend the transmission warranty for U.S.A. owners or entities to 7.75 years for all models made from 1998 to 2002 and some 2003 models by VIN; however, Canadian owners warranties were not extended. Transmissions replaced prior to March 2005 usually fail again. [...] Transmissions replaced from March 2005 and later include a redesigned third gear clutch pack reported to fix the problem.|$|E
