5|$|A more ancient {{dwelling}} on Shapinsay is the Iron Age Broch of Burroughston. Only {{the interior of}} this partially buried building has been excavated, allowing visitors to look down into the broch from the surrounding mound.

5|$|Baleen {{whales are}} {{cetaceans}} classified under the parvorder Mysticeti, and consist of four extant families: Balaenidae (right whales), Balaenopteridae (rorquals), Cetotheriidae (pygmy right whale), and Eschrichtiidae (gray whale). Balaenids are distinguished by their enlarged head and thick blubber, while rorquals and gray whales generally have a flat head, long throat pleats, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> streamlined than Balaenids. Rorquals {{also tend to}} be longer than the latter. Cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) and artiodactyls are now classified under the order Cetartiodactyla, often still referred to as Artiodactyla (given that the cetaceans are deeply nested with the artiodactyls). The closest living relatives to baleen whales are toothed whales both from the infraorder Cetacea.|$|E
5|$|Different soil types suit {{different}} crops, but {{in general}} in temperate climates, sandy soils dry out fast but warm up quickly {{in the spring and}} are suitable for early crops, while heavy clays retain moisture better <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> suitable for late season crops. The growing season can be lengthened by the use of fleece, cloches, plastic mulch, polytunnels, and greenhouses. In hotter regions, the production of vegetables is constrained by the climate, especially the pattern of rainfall, while in temperate zones, it is constrained by the temperature and day length.|$|E
5|$|Egg laying {{dates and}} clutch size vary by region; in Texas {{the time period}} is from late February to late August, in Iowa it ranges from late April to June. The clutch size is {{generally}} 3 to 6 eggs, but can reach as high as seven in Texas. The eggs are creamy white with brown or reddish-brown spots, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> heavily marked at the broad end. The eggs are incubated by the female for 12–16 days. After the young hatch, they are fed exclusively on invertebrates and they fledge in 12–14 days. As many as three broods may be raised by a pair in a single breeding season. In one study, three of the 70 fledglings remained or defended territory adjacent to the natal area.|$|E

It also reduces the deployment density <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> suitable to sensor networks than other low sensitivity wake-up radios.

5|$|In {{addition}} to archaeological evidence, Zenobia's life {{was recorded in}} different ancient sources but many are flawed or fabricated; the Augustan History, a late-Roman collection of biographies, is the most notable (albeit unreliable) source for the era. The author (or authors) of the Augustan History invented many events and letters attributed to Zenobia {{in the absence of}} contemporary sources. Some Augustan History accounts are corroborated from other sources, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> credible. Byzantine chronicler Joannes Zonaras is considered an important source for the life of Zenobia.|$|E
5|$|Like all jumping spiders, M. inclemens has {{excellent}} vision. The main eyes, in the front-and-center position, are large, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> acute {{than those}} of a cat and about 10 times as acute as a dragonfly's. The remaining three pairs of eyes are {{along the sides of}} the head, and work as motion detectors. The eyes are used for hunting, for avoiding threats and for finding and wooing mates. Almost all jumping spiders are predators, mostly preying on insects, on other spiders, and on other arthropods.|$|E
5|$|Like all milk caps, L.volemus forms ectomycorrhizae, {{mutually}} beneficial symbiotic associations with various tree species. In this association, the fungal hyphae grow around {{the root of}} the plant and between its cortical cells, but do not actually penetrate them. The hyphae extend outward into the soil, increasing the surface area for absorption to help the plant absorb nutrients from the soil. It is found growing at the base of both coniferous and broad-leaved trees, although it is more common in deciduous woods. It may also sometimes be found in peat moss beds. The fruit bodies, which appear between summer and autumn, are common. They can be found growing solitarily or in groups, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> abundant in weather that is warm and humid.|$|E

5|$|Many {{facets of}} the {{interaction}} between sea otters and the human economy are not as immediately felt. Sea otters have been credited with contributing to the kelp harvesting industry via their well-known role in controlling sea urchin populations; kelp is used in the production of diverse food and pharmaceutical products. Although human divers harvest red sea urchins both for food and to protect the kelp, sea otters hunt more sea urchin species <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> consistently effective in controlling these populations. The health of the kelp forest ecosystem is significant in nurturing populations of fish, including commercially important fish species. In some areas, sea otters are popular tourist attractions, bringing visitors to local hotels, restaurants, and sea otter-watching expeditions.|$|E

5|$|Neptunium {{is found}} {{in at least three}} allotropes. Some claims of a fourth allotrope have been made, but they are so far not proven.

5|$|Seeds do {{not require}} any treatment, and take 14 to 16 days to germinate. Rarely cultivated, Banksia scabrella flowers in 3 to 5 years from seed. Information is limited on its reliability, {{but it has been}} grown {{successfully}} in South Australia. It is fast-growing but ultimately untidy in habit, and would benefit from regular pruning. Some forms in the wild have a more compact habit, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> promising for horticulture.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the breed}} first became commercial, it {{has spread to}} Canada and become a major {{contributor}} in the commercial lamb industry. The breed adapts well to confinement and is readily used in accelerated crossbreeding programs. Polled Dorsets thrive under grass-based and feedlot conditions <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> suitable on small farms that are intensely managed.|$|E
5|$|Social wasps are {{considered}} pests {{when they become}} excessively common, or nest close to buildings. People are most often stung in late summer, when wasp colonies stop breeding new workers; the existing workers search for sugary foods <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to {{come into contact with}} humans; if people then respond aggressively, the wasps sting. Wasp nests made in or near houses, such as in roof spaces, can present a danger as the wasps may sting if people come close to them. Stings are usually painful rather than dangerous, but in rare cases, people may suffer life-threatening anaphylactic shock.|$|E
