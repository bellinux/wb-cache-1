40|$|The {{idea that}} evil things {{may have a}} {{positive}} outcome is a classic way of making sense of negative events. It is even {{at the heart of}} conversion narratives. Its expression in Romans 8. 28 is paralleled by many formal and informal statements about the teleological meaning of human suffering. In the catalogue of theodicy-models, such views can be labeled as pedagogical or greater-good interpretations. In recent years, researchers have started to explore the positive outcomes of traumatic experiences. They find that posttraumatic growth is far more usual than has been acknowledged so far. Some even state that the normal result of trauma is growth, not pathology. An important factor in this posttraumatic growth is found in the complex of spirituality, religion, and wisdom. This paper brings together the theological theories of theodicy and the psychological research of posttraumatic spirituality.

40|$|AbstractThe {{energy sector}} in Europe and {{globally}} is changing rapidly. We see large European energy utilities experiencing fast declining profits or even incur large multi-billion losses. We see {{the use of}} more renewable energy sources, but also a fast reduction in financial support from them from governments. We see fast declining technology costs of solar and wind energy. Electricity prices do strange things at the wholesale market, they regularly even get negative. The first steps to plug-in electrical vehicles and pure electric vehicles are taken. Globally there is a shift from energy use increase from developed to emerging economies. This leads globally to continuous high prices for fossil fuels. New ways of exploration of gas (like shale gas in the United States) have a high impact on the competitive position of the different global players and {{has an effect on}} the use of coal for power generation in Europe. Where do all these different trends come from, and what are the consequences?

40|$|Why does – {{why should}} – any country wish {{to join the}} European Union? The answer is plain: to become European. <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean?</b> If it means anything, surely the European dream is to be stable, {{democratic}} and prosperous, {{with a touch of}} the “social model ” that is supposed to distinguish Europe from the United States. This is obvious, and not only that: it is spelled out explicitly in the founding documents of the European Union. For the presently less-prosperous and, to the East, quite poor regions of the EU, becoming European requires that they catch up, toward the living standards presently prevailing in the West. It does not require equality. Living standards in Poland will never equal those in Germany, because the industrial and financial core of Europe will never move from Germany to Poland. But the European project does require that the gap between Poland and Germany narrow over time. It also requires that the dramatic gaps separating wage levels in Estonia and Bulgaria from those in Spain or the Czech Republic be narrowed, even as the Spaniards and Czechs reduce the gaps separating them from the truly rich. This we may call the imperative of convergence. This paper explores that imperative over a relatively long time horizon, stretching out to the fiftieth anniversary of the Maastricht Treaty i...|$|E
40|$|This {{has been}} an {{extraordinary}} year. A considerable amount of time has been spent on budget cutting activities that {{were not part of}} our strategic plan. To get the support and understanding for the budget cuts that were required, we used an elaborate process that involved a team of staff and library faculty and the gathering of feedback from the entire staff at selected intervals. Our process was framed by the requirement that all cuts be made with the University’s goals in mind and within the framework of “What do the Libraries and the Center for Creative Photography have to be doing in three to five years to successfully contribute to the University’s goals <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> we have to do now? ” We also kept our values in mind: customer focus, continual improvement, diversity, flexibility, and integrity.

40|$|Historically, {{reforms and}} American {{schools have been}} closely intertwined. Currently, another reform, {{academic}} learning standards, is being implemented in most classrooms. Since the history surrounding school reform (Labaree 1999, Sarason 1990, Gibboney 1997, Fullan 1997) is not replete with success, {{it makes sense to}} question why yet another reform. Implementation becomes a key component of this study. Research portrays implementation as a process in which local actors redefine policy to fit local agendas (Spillane, 1998). Successful implementation requires mutual adaptation in which external policy is adapted to fit local conditions, and local conditions are adapted to fit policy (McLaughlin, 1990). Therefore, the implementation of academic learning standards may require close scrutiny if it is to succeed. ^ The {{purpose of this study is}} to document, describe and analyze the journey of students, teachers and a principal in an elementary school in Southeastern Pennsylvania as academic learning standards are implemented as a reform effort. The following questions are addressed: As a reform, how are academic learning standards implemented at the local level <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> to students, teachers and a principal? What kinds of structures are supported and created in this implementation process? ^ The data sources for this study are artifacts, fieldnotes, walkthrough data, student and teacher interviews and a principal 2 ̆ 7 s journal. The data are analyzed with a specific focus on understanding the participants 2 ̆ 7 lived experiences of the phenomenon (Marshall and Rossman, 1999). ^ The results indicate that the implementation of academic learning standards is a very complex process. The implementation process produces a tension between the creation of a shared vision around standards and autonomous decisions in the classroom. A teacher 2 ̆ 7 s teaching and learning practices may or may not be impacted. Also, in this era of accountability, teachers and administrators are influenced to create and use normative structures that demonstrate student learning. The study reveals that rubrics, as a normative structure of standards, may increase students 2 ̆ 7 capacity for controlling their learning and assessing their work. In addition, having access to ideas and knowledge about standards influences the flow of these ideas and knowledge within the school community. Finally, the study indicates that language is a key factor in a successful implementation process. ...|$|E

40|$|In a time {{of social}} {{liquefaction}} and a network approach to governance citizens and their organizations are increasingly expected {{to contribute to the}} revitalization of society. Civil society organizations are valued and used by governments for contributing to a diverse range of public issues. Sports is one of those domains in which voluntary organizations are expected to contribute to society. A range of governments increasingly use voluntary sport clubs (VSCs) as partners for contributing to public issues, like counteracting overweight among youth, improve social integration of immigrants, improving social cohesion in neighbourhoods and activating the elderly. In this dissertation this process is conceptualized as instrumentalization. In this dissertation the construction of the instrumental role of voluntary sport clubs in municipal sport policy {{and the way in which}} two VSCs in the Dutch municipality of Utrecht enact this instrumental role are studied in depth. The dissertation has three aims. First, it aims to describe and understand the process of instrumentalization of VSCs, showing tensions between instrumentalization by government and the relative autonomous position of VSCs. Second, the dissertation aims to conceptualize instrumentalization as such. The concept is used in a range of academic subdisciplines, but has not yet been extensively conceptualized. Therefore, this dissertation provides a foundational contribution for further use of this concept. Third, the dissertation aims to contribute to the ongoing development of a more on agency oriented institutional approach, by combining two recent streams in this theory. It belongs to a very select number of studies that combine the institutional logics approach and the institutional work approach. The dissertation answers the follow research question: How do voluntary sport clubs enact the instrumentalization by governments <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> for the dominant institutional logic(s) in voluntary sport clubs? The design of the study was inspired by studies on sense making in organizations and policy implementation. For this research an extensive interpretive policy analysis was conducted on formal sport policy documents of the twenty largest Dutch municipalities. To analyze the way in which voluntary sport clubs enact the instrumentalization by governments three case studies were conducted. Data has been collected by making use of a range of qualitative methods, like observations, shadowing, document analysis, and interviews. This dissertation concludes that voluntary sport clubs operate strategically in their relation with government. A new insight that arises out of this dissertation is that voluntary sport clubs instrumentally use sport policy programmes for their own ambitions. They use the instrumentalization by government as a chance to fulfil their own organizational ambitions. In this way they contribute to institutional change; sport clubs assimilate a public logic into their organizational actions. At the same time they maintain a community and a competitive logic as dominant institutional logics. Instrumentalization thus works both ways; when governments use voluntary organizations as instruments for public policy implementation, they expose public policy itself for instrumental use by civil society. In this way instrumentalization can be interpreted as double play...|$|E
