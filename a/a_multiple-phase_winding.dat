40|$|We present here new {{results of}} {{two-dimensional}} hydrodynamical simulations of the eruptive {{events of the}} 1840 s (the great) and the 1890 s (the minor) eruptions suffered by the massive star eta Carinae (Car). The two bipolar nebulae {{commonly known as the}} Homunculus and the little Homunculus (LH) were formed from the interaction of these eruptive events with the underlying stellar wind. We assume here <b>an</b> interacting, non-spherical <b>multiple-phase</b> <b>wind</b> scenario to explain the shape and the kinematics of both Homunculi, but adopt a more realistic parametrization of the phases of the wind. During the 1890 s eruptive event, the outflow speed decreased {{for a short period of}} time. This fact suggests that the LH is formed when the eruption ends, from the impact of the post-outburst eta Car wind (that follows the 1890 s event) with the eruptive flow (rather than by the collision of the eruptive flow with the pre-outburst wind, as claimed in previous models; Gonzalez et al.). Our simulations reproduce quite well the shape and the observed expansion speed of the large Homunculus. The LH (which is embedded within the large Homunculus) becomes Rayleigh-Taylor unstable and develop filamentary structures that resemble the spatial features observed in the polar caps. In addition, we find that the interior cavity between the two Homunculi is partially filled by material that is expelled during the decades following the great eruption. This result may be connected with the observed double-shell structure in the polar lobes of the eta Car nebula. Finally, as in previous work, we find the formation of tenuous, equatorial, high-speed features that seem to be related to the observed equatorial skirt of eta Car.

40|$|Abstract Multihypothesis with phase {{diversity}} is introduced into motion-compensated temporal ltering by deploying {{the latter in}} the domain of a spatially redundant wavelet transform. The centerpiece of this redundant-wavelet approach to multihy-pothesis temporal ltering is <b>a</b> <b>multiple-phase</b> inverse transform that involves an implicit projection signicantly reducing noise not captured by the motion model of the temporal ltering. The primary contribution of the work is a derivation that establishes analytically the advantage of the redundant-wavelet approach as compared to equivalent temporal ltering taking place in the spatial domain. For practical implementation, a regular triangle mesh is used to track motion between frames, and an afne transform between mesh triangles implements motion compensation within a lifting-based temporal transform. Experimental results reveal that the incorporation of phase-diversity multihypothesis into motion-compensated temporal l-tering improves rate-distortion performance, and state-of-the-art scalable performance is observed.

Technology is assumed to rest on a managerial-administrative infrastructure which influences natality, mortality and the productivity of work.

Growth can occur within a regime by the reorganization of population into new groups. But this process cannot continue forever because of externalities. A way out exists in the adoption of an entirely new regime. Evolution is possible but the probability of escape from an old regime need not be unity.

This new parameterization {{is based on}} <b>a</b> <b>multiple-phase</b> one-moment cloud microphysics scheme built upon the implicit numerical framework recently developed and implemented in the ECMWF operational forecasting model. The parameterization solves five prognostic equations for water vapour, cloud liquid water, rain, cloud ice, and snow mixing ratios.

Various fields from a 10 -year long integration of RegCM 4 run in tropical band mode with the new scheme are compared with their counterparts using the previous cloud scheme and are evaluated against satellite observations. In addition, an assessment using the Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project (CFMIP) Observational Simulator Package (COSP) for a 1 -year sub-period provides additional information for evaluating the cloud optical properties against satellite data. The new microphysics parameterization yields an improved simulation of cloud fields, and in particular it removes the overestimation of upper level cloud characteristics of the previous scheme, increasing the agreement with observations and leading to an amelioration of a long-standing problem in the RegCM system.

40|$|Aim of the paper. This paper {{reports the}} results of <b>a</b> <b>multiple-phase</b> study on <b>a</b> {{mentoring}} scheme for nursing students {{in one of the}} universities in Hong Kong. Using a qualitative approach, students' perceptions of the various roles of mentors were collected, and this information was used as the basis to design a tool for subsequent evaluation of the mentoring scheme. Background. The nursing department in one of the universities in Hong Kong initiated and developed the idea of an 'Honorary Clinical Instructors' scheme (HCI scheme) for the supervision of the pre-registration nurses. The scheme was examined in a local context, where the Chinese culture dominated, so that a standardized protocol that takes into account the potential cultural dimensions could be established. Design. The mentoring roles outlined by the English National Board (ENB) for Nursing, Midwifery, Health Visiting were used as a framework to identify undergraduate nursing students' perception of the effectiveness of mentors. Information gathered from interviews with Year 2 students (n = 12) and Year 3 students (n = 10) was used as the basis to design a questionnaire for subsequent programme evaluation. An evaluation questionnaire based on the interviewing results was developed for further evaluation of the mentoring scheme. Findings. After the mentoring scheme was evaluated in semester one, a series of strategies were designed to improve the preparation of mentors and the implementation of the scheme. The strategies were identified as effective by the significant differences in the perceptions students had towards the mentoring scheme in semester one and semester two (t 189 = - 4 · 80, P < 0 · 001), with semester two (n = 81) having a mean score difference of 8 · 69 higher than in semester one (n = 110). Conclusions. It was concluded that the questionnaire developed in the project could be adopted as a useful instrument {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} mentoring programmes for nursing courses, and that {{the results of}} this study may also stimulate more research interest in this area to improve the quality of clinical teaching in the preregistration nursing education programmes in the future.

Poverty is a problem with many facets that needs a multi-dimensional approach. One of the approaches used to alleviate poverty is through income-generating projects (IGPs). Most IGPs reported participation difficulties which negatively affects the sustainability of these projects. This study focuses on an IGP which forms part of the FLAGH programme in the North West Province. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the motivation of women to participate in an IGP in order to understand why they participate and whether there is an observable difference concerning their motivation over a period of 16 months. In addition, the link between motivation and regular and irregular participation was investigated. <b>A</b> <b>multiple-phased,</b> single case study design, was followed to explore the motivation of purposefully selected women of the IGP. A semi-structured questionnaire was specifically designed for this study to collect data together with field notes, visual media and in-depth interviews. The study consisted of three phases. The socio-demographic information obtained by the semi-structured questionnaires provided the researcher with a profile of women who participated in the IGP during the first phase. The photographs and field notes served as evidence with regards to the socio-demographic and household information obtained through the questionnaires. The semi-structured questionnaires with the structured and open-ended questions provided insight concerning the motivational factors that influenced their participation over a period of 16 months. During the second phase, a comparison could be made between active and non-active participants. Differences in motivational factors were identified which explained the participation behaviour of both groups. In-depth interviews in phase three brought a better understanding of the motivational factors of the regular participants concerning their experiences. Field notes also served as supporting evidence for the results in phase three. Results of this study provided more information and insight regarding the participation difficulties in an IGP. Encouraging as well as discouraging motivational factors were identified that influenced participants to participate regularly or irregular in the IGP. The motivation that changed among participants over a period of 16 months was also identified. These results will be used to improve current IGPs and also in the planning of future IGPs. One of the limitations of this study was the small number of available women to observe. This study contributes as a section in a larger process that attempts to alleviate poverty through research on the subject in order to obtain a better understanding of difficulties found in IGPs.

40|$|On March 15, 1990, the Center for Archaeological Research (CAR) of The University of Texas at San Antonio {{entered into}} a {{contract}} with the City of San Antonio 2 ̆ 7 s Multipurpose Domed Stadium Development Advisory Committee and Via Metropolitan Transit Authority to undertake cultural resource investigations of a 17 -square-block (65 acre) area in downtown San Antonio, Texas (Figure F-l). From mid-March to early July 1990, and periodically thereafter, intensive archival and historical research on the entire project area was carried out by CAR staff members. Architectural recording and assessment of all standing buildings was done by Andrew Perez and Associates. Thirteen oral history interviews with residents, former residents, and officers and employees of business establishments in the general area were recorded and transcribed by E. L. Fly and Associates. This was the first phase of <b>a</b> <b>multiple-phase</b> Figure F-l. Alamodome Project area. Vlll project that also included archaeological test excavations during 1991 and 1992 to verify or identify the locations of sites and features within the project area, and detailed investigations of a selected sample of those sites and features. The project was conducted under Texas Antiquities Committee permit numbers 900, 932, and 982. The artifacts recovered from the investigations were processed, cataloged, and sorted into categories for identification and analysis. Then followed over a year of intensive study of the products of the research and excavations. Because of the tremendous scope of the archaeological work and the associated analysis and write-up, the results of the Alamodome Project are presented in three volumes. Volume I contains the background research results, including chapters on the historical setting, the architecture present before demolition was begun, the oral history, a study of the African-American community, and a summary of the structural evolution of the area. Volume n contains a complete description of the archaeological excavations and a distributional analysis of the results, written by the archaeologist {{who was in charge of}} the field work on the project. Included are numerous maps, drawings, and photographs of the work in progress. Also included in Volume n are a study of the site formation processes, undertaken by Kevin Gross, and a geomorphic description of the project area, by Michael Collins. This volume, the last of the series, is comprised of individual reports on the description and analysis of various types of arifactual materials recovered during the project, including ceramics, glass, kitchen and tablewares, dolls and toys, marbles, clothing and personal items, and building materials. Also included in this volume are descriptions and discussions of excavated wells, cisterns, acequias, and privies, and an analysis of the faunal materials. The temporal scope of these studies is the l 00 -year period from 1850 to 1950. This time frame encompasses the period directly after the end of SpanishlMexican control and the gradual rise of Anglo/German control of the local economy and sociopolitical structure. It is also the time during which the first wave of the Industrial Revolution arrived in Texas, seriously impacting the history of San Antonio. One goal of the project was to study this impact on the economic and cultural life of one small sector of the city. Scope of Volume III This volume presents the results of research by CAR staff members into the developmental history of the numerous types of artifacts used to analyze and date deposits on the archaeological sites investigated during the Alamodome Project. Comparatively little research has been done on artifacts of the post- 1900 period in Texas. Authors have spent hours of patient research in sometimes obscure publications and long distance phone calls to chase down and interview manufacturers wherever possible. We hope this volume will be a resource to others doing the same sort of research. As the years pass and 1900 recedes farther into the past, more and more archaeologists and historians will be looking for this sort of information...|$|R

In order to optimize the delivery of specific biological fluids to target regions in microfluidic capillary autonomous systems (CAS), we analyze self-priming of liquid water into a microfluidic device consisting of a microfluidic channel that feeds a rectangular microfluidic cavity trough an appropriately designed micro-chamber. The target performance criteria in our optimization are (1) fast and complete wetting of the cavity bottom while (2) minimizing the probability of trapping air bubble in the device. The numerical model {{is based on the}} lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) and <b>a</b> three-dimensional single-component <b>multiple-phase</b> (SCMP) scheme. By using a parallel implementation of this algorithm, we investigate the physical processes related to the invasion of the liquid-gas interfaces in rectangular cavities at different liquid-solid contact angle and shapes of the transition micro-chamber. The numerical results has successfully captured important qualitative and some key quantitative effects of the liquid-solid contact angle, the roughness of the cavity edges, the depth of the holes and shape of the micro-chambers. Moreover, we present and validate experimentally simple geometrical optimizations of the microfluidic device that ensure the complete filling the microfluidic cavity with liquid.

40|$|In this study, a novel unified {{framework}} {{for the study of}} both microstructural evolution and the mechanical property quantification is proposed. The multistate Potts model is used to simulate the microstructural evolution, whereas a volume-compensated particle method (VCPM) is used for the mechanical property quantification of the steady state microstructure. The VCPM proposed by Chen and colleagues was originally developed for the investigation of the fracture phenomenon of solid materials. The model was also successfully extended to study the elastoplastic properties of solids by introducing a volume conservation scheme. In the VCPM framework, the domain of interest is discretized into regular unit cells according to the triangle and square packing for 2 D and simple cubic, body centered cubic and face-centered cubic packing for 3 D. Both local pair-wise and nonlocal multibody potential are proposed to account for the interactions between particles. The multistate Potts models have been used extensively to model a variety of microstructural phenomena, such as the grain growth in <b>a</b> single or <b>multiple-phase</b> system, recrystallization, solidification, and many others. The space-filling array of regular cells is used to represent the Potts domain which {{is the same as the}} one used in VCPM. The microstructure evolves such that the system Hamiltonian is minimized. To consider different external effects on the states of the microstructure, different energy terms can be introduced into the system Hamiltonian, such as surface energy to account for the interface effect and strain energy for the grain orientation. Once the final steady state is obtained using the multistate Potts model, usually some other techniques, such as FEM, are used to calculate the effective properties of the microstructural system. It requires the mapping between the FEM meshes and the microstructure. The mapping is very difficult, especially for the interface mapping when the microstructure is very complex. In this study, the VCPM is coupled with the multistate Potts model to simulate the microstructural evolution and quantify the effective mechanical properties of the system within one framework. No mapping between these two models is required since they share the same underlying domain structures. The nonlocal potential proposed in VCPM is introduced into the multistate Potts model as an alternative of the original strain energy term. By doing this, effective simulation of the microstructure evolution for multiple-phase materials can be achieved. Given the final microstructure, the VCPM simulation is carried out to calculate the effective properties of the obtained system...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} final technical {{results for}} the project Simulation Framework for Regional Geologic CO{sub 2 } Storage Infrastructure along Arches Province of the Midwest United States. The Arches Simulation project was a three year effort designed to develop a simulation framework for regional geologic carbon dioxide (CO{sub 2 }) storage infrastructure along the Arches Province through development of a geologic model and advanced reservoir simulations of large-scale CO{sub 2 } storage. The project included five major technical tasks: (1) compilation of geologic, hydraulic and injection data on Mount Simon, (2) development of model framework and parameters, (3) preliminary variable density flow simulations, (4) multi-phase model runs of regional storage scenarios, and (5) implications for regional storage feasibility. The Arches Province is an informal region in northeastern Indiana, northern Kentucky, western Ohio, and southern Michigan where sedimentary rock formations form broad arch and platform structures. In the province, the Mount Simon sandstone is an appealing deep saline formation for CO{sub 2 } storage because of the intersection of reservoir thickness and permeability. Many CO{sub 2 } sources are located in proximity to the Arches Province, and the area is adjacent to coal fired power plants along the Ohio River Valley corridor. Geophysical well logs, rock samples, drilling logs, and geotechnical tests were evaluated for a 500, 000 km{sup 2 } study area centered on the Arches Province. Hydraulic parameters and historical operational information was also compiled from Mount Simon wastewater injection wells in the region. This information was integrated into a geocellular model that depicts the parameters and conditions in a numerical array. The geologic and hydraulic data were integrated into a three-dimensional grid of porosity and permeability, which are key parameters regarding fluid flow and pressure buildup due to CO{sub 2 } injection. Permeability data were corrected in locations where reservoir tests have been performed in Mount Simon injection wells. The geocellular model was used to develop a series of numerical simulations designed to support CO 2 storage applications in the Arches Province. Variable density fluid flow simulations were initially run to evaluate model sensitivity to input parameters. Two dimensional, multiple-phase simulations were completed to evaluate issues related to arranging injection fields in the study area. <b>A</b> basin-scale, <b>multiple-phase</b> model was developed to evaluate large scale injection effects across the region. Finally, local scale simulations were also completed with more detailed depiction of the Eau Claire formation to investigate to the potential for upward migration of CO 2. Overall, the technical work on the project concluded that injection large-scale injection may be achieved with proper field design, operation, siting, and monitoring. Records from Mount Simon injection wells were compiled, documenting more than 20 billion gallons of injection into the Mount Simon formation in the Arches Province over the past 40 years, equivalent to approximately 60 million metric tons CO 2. The multi-state team effort was useful in delineating the geographic variability in the Mount Simon reservoir properties. Simulations better defined potential well fields, well field arrangement, CO 2 pipeline distribution system, and operational parameters for large-scale injection in the Arches Province. Multiphase scoping level simulations suggest that injection fields with arrays of 9 to 50 + wells {{may be used to}} accommodate large injection volumes. Individual wells may need to be separated by 3 to 10 km. Injection fields may require spacing of 25 to 40 km to limit pressure and saturation front interference. Basin-scale multiple-phase simulations in STOMP reflect variability in the Mount Simon. While simulations suggest a total injection rate of 100 million metric tons per year (approximately to a 40 % reduction of CO 2 emissions from large point sources across the Arches Province) may be feasible, some areas are more suitable due to favorable geology. Sustainable injection rates were higher in areas where there was higher thickness and reservoir permeability. Distribution of injection across well fields is an effective method to reduce pressure and CO 2 saturation front interference...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is the {{reconstruction}} of the Plio-Quatenary tectonic evolution of the hinge zone between the northern Sicilian orogen, with a moderate thickened crust, and Southern Tyrrhenian margin, characterized by crustal thinning, to constrain a seismotectonic evolutionary model of non coaxial deformation in a simple shear regime, of the southern Tyrrhenian area. The research has been carried out through a multidisciplinary approach in which the new morphotectonic, geological and structural data, acquired also in the emerged and submerged sectors, have been integrated and interpreted in light of seismological and statistical ones. The studied area is located on the western sector of the Northern Sicily and its Tyrrhenian off-shore {{that are part of the}} Sicilian Maghrebides, an W–E trending southverging thrust belt, showing an axial depression in north-eastern Sicily, where the southern sector of the Calabrian arc (Peloritani Mts.) overthrust both the Sicilidi units (Nebrodi Mts.) and the most external units of the chain (Panormide, Imerese, Trapanese and Saccense), these latter characterizing the research area. The architecture of the Sicilian thrust belt is the result of <b>a</b> <b>multiple-phase</b> tectonic history from Late Oligocene-Early Miocene to Present, characterized by compressional, extensional, and transcurrent events. The first compressional phase, responsible of the thrust belt building, is represented by fold associations, in places cleavage and foliation, thrust and contractional faults. All these features shortened the original paleotectonic domains by flat-ramp, duplex, enveloping, and breaching geometries. In the late Miocene the activation of low-angle north-striking extensional faults produced a general stretching of the belt by the re-orientation and inversion of pre-existing structures. Since Early Pliocene a brittle phase produced a complicated grid of highangle strike-slip faults, consisting of two different systems: the first, NW-SE to W–E trending, right-lateral, and the second, N–S to NE-SW trending, left-lateral. The strike slip tectonic is the results of non coaxial strain related to an W–E trending right-lateral regional shear zone, extended for about 300 km from Ustica-Eolie alignment to the “Pantelleria Rift”. This tectonic regime is still active as demonstrate the shallow crustal seismicity affecting the southern Tyrrhenian area. In order to better define the neotectonic pattern, after a general morphotectonic characterization, three key areas have been selected to carried out detailed morphostructural and structural analysis, which are: 1) The S. Vito lo Capo Peninsula, in the north-western sector of the studied area, where the neotectonic pattern is well exposed, also involving the Olocenic continental and marine deposits. 2) The area of M. te Kumeta ridge, in the southern sector of the Palermo Mountains, where the brittle and ductile strain partitioning has been reconstructed in detail. 3) The off-shore area, north from Palermo and Tapani, where the structural setting has been inferred from morpho-bathymetric and geological maps of the Southern Tyrrhenian basin. Moreover, in this last area a new seismological study has been carried out using published and new data on the southern Tyrrhenian seismicity, particularly on a portion of the Palermo 2002 Seismic sequence. On-land the morphostructural, structural and seismological analysis allowed to recognize and characterize brittle and ductile neotectonic geometries, as high-angle, enechêlon, net- and strike-slip fault systems, with associated fold systems, superimposed on inherited geometries connected to the previous Miocenic and late-Miocenic compressional and extensional tectonic phases. The reconstructed deformational pattern characterizes also emerged and submerged sectors, where the inferred neotectonic pattern shows a well coherence of the geometrical and dimensional characteristics of the on-shore one. This is represented by a complicated brittle grid of multiple overstepping high angle strike-slip faults, NWSE to W-E trending, right lateral, and a N-S to NE-SW trending, left lateral system faults producing, at every scale, associated minor order synthetic and antithetic riedel shear systems. The major strike-slip systems inducing also block and en-echélon fold axis clockwise rotations, in overstepping tranpressional areas. The recognized geometries both in the emerged and submerged areas seem to control the genesis and evolution of main morphostructures represented by tectonic depressions filled by plio-pleistocenic clastic deposits, coinciding with releasing zones, and interposed morphostructural highs in the restraining ones. The inversion of the stress on the acquired structural data, highlights a regional stress field characterized by a principal suborizontal maximum compressional axis, oriented about NW-SE, inducing a non coaxial deformation, in which is possible to justify all the recognized brittle and ductile structures. The collected data on the shallow crustal seismicity occurred in the southern Tyrrhenian area in the last 25 years, highlight a seismogenic band mainly located between 10 and 35 km depth, clustered around high-angle dipping planes well fitting the orientation of the outcropping fault systems. The focal mechanisms showing transpressional, compressional, transtensional and estensional kinematics, are the results of the mechanical heterogeneity of the rock volumes related to the polyphasic tectonic evolution of the area. The new seismological study has been carried out on a part of 2002 seismic sequence, using a database obtained by the integration of data recorded by the stations of the National Seismic Network with those recorded, in four months, from 7 three -components stations of a temporary network installed by INGV. In particular, about 40 seismic events, recorded by more than 40 seismic stations, occurred between September and December 2002, have been relocated using a procedure based on the HYPODD program, and an eight layers velocity model optimized relocating some thousands events of the southern Tyrrhenian. The focal mechanisms of such events have been determined using FPFIT code. The relocation of the hypocentres constrains the seismogenic volume responsible of the 2002 seismic sequence, between 5 and 20 Km depth. The new focal mechanisms shows, a mainly transcurrent kinematic for the mainshock, and globally an extreme variability of both kinematic and geometries of the seismogenic structures, supporting the mechanical complexity of seismogenic volume. The analysis of the new focal mechanisms, taking into account geological and mechanical constrains, shows that in the siesmogenic volume, the possible rupture surfaces correspond to minor order fault systems recognized in on-land studied area, or, in places, to inherited geometries (ramp-flat thrusts or low angle normal faults) as result of strain accomodation. In order to better characterize the seismogenic volume, the Coulomb stress changes related to the main event of the sequence have been also calculated. This study shows that the first events of the sequence develop into the stress increasing areas, supposing as the possible seismogenic structure, a subvertical N-S trending faults, 10 kilometres extended, activated with a left-lateral kinematic. This inferred seismogenic structure could represent a second order fault system activate in a seismogenic volume, orientate along a principal NE-SW axis, coinciding with a restraining band, in which the geometric characters show the occurrence of a simple shear deformational style, according to the seismotectonic model of non coaxial deformation. La tematica affrontata nel percorso di approfondimento compiuto negli anni 2008 - 2010 attraverso questo Dottorato in Scienze della terra, prende spunto dall’osservazione che alcuni elementi acquisiti nel corso del lungo iter di studio che va avanti da diversi anni, relativamente a tematiche inizialmente relative alle relazioni tra evoluzione morfologica e assetto strutturale di alcune porzioni dell’area siciliana, non sempre trovavano una coerente e logica collocazione in un quadro generale gia' modellizzato. La necessita' di analizzare gli elementi legati all’evoluzione tettonica piu' recente dell’area siciliana, si configura per il fatto che la Sicilia si colloca in corrispondenza di un’area che viene considerata tra quelle sismicamente piu' “attive” dell’intero Mediterraneo, essendo stata la stessa in tempi “recenti” interessata da una intensa attivita' tettonica alla quale si associano elevati livelli di sismicita', tra i maggiori registrati nell’intera area centro-mediterranea. L’area che e' stata studiata nel presente lavoro di tesi riguarda la porzione occidentale della Sicilia settentrionale ed il suo antistante off-shore. Questi elementi si collocano in corrispondenza di un settore crostale che da un punto di vista geodinamico assume una notevole importanza per la comprensione dell’evoluzione dell’intera areasud tirrenica, costituendo essi una “zona di cerniera” in assottigliamento che raccorda il bacino tirrenico, caratterizzato da processi di oceanizzazione, e la porzione emersa della catena siciliana, costituita invece da una spessa crosta continentale. Nell’ultimo decennio si e' assistito al fiorire di ricerche a carattere multidisciplinare, che hanno riguardato proprio l’area in studio, tendenti all’elaborazione di modelli sismotettonici vincolati sia a dati geologico-strutturali sia a quelli geologico-geofisici; i modelli elaborati, tuttavia, non sempre sono risultati congruenti tra loro. Lo scopo del presente studio e' quello di acquisire elementi utili per la ricostruzione dell’evoluzione tettonica plio-quaternaria dell’area sud tirrenica, con particolare riferimento alla Sicilia occidentale ed al suo antistante off-shore, a supporto di un modello sismotettonico che sia coerente con i dati geologico-strutturali rilevati sul campo e con i dati derivati dall’analisi sismologica. Occorre subito precisare che per tutte le considerazioni relative al periodo Quaternario si fa riferimento alla tradizionale impostazione secondo la quale il limite tra il Pliocene ed il Quaternario viene posto in corrispondenza della base del Pleistocene a circa 1. 8 Ma, nel Calabriano, secondo la proposta INQUA del 1982 successivamente ratificata nel 2004 dall’ IUGS. Per portare avanti la ricerca e' stato utilizzato un approccio multisciplinare condotto attraverso l’acquisizione di dati geologico-strutturali, successivamente integrati con dati derivati dall’approfondimento degli aspetti geofisici ed in particolare quelli sismologici. Tali dati sono stati interpretati alla luce di studi morfotettonici e, per alcune valutazioni, anche attraverso l’utilizzo di analisi statistiche. · Le analisi di tipo geologico-strutturale rappresentano in uno studio come quello che e' stato condotto, l’elemento fondamentale per il riconoscimento e la caratterizzazione di strutture neotettoniche, eventualmente sismogeniche, a partire dalle osservazioni di campagna, oltre che per una serie di deduzioni relative all’interpretazione dell’evoluzione “recente” dell’area. Il rilevamento di campagna, effettuato in dettaglio in aree “chiave” ritenute di particolare importanza nel quadro regionale, infatti, ha consentito l’individuazione di strutture tettoniche, consentendo la discriminazione di strutture primarie e secondarie; inoltre, ha fornito gli elementi base per potere valutare la reciproca compatibilità tra strutture di ordine diverso e, nel complesso, la loro coerenza rispetto ad un campo di stress regionale. · L’approccio morfotettonico si e' reso necessario partendo dal presupposto che le deformazioni crostali recenti trovano la loro espressione in superficie essenzialmente attraverso la definizione della morfologia dei luoghi, contribuendo alla elaborazione del rilievo attraverso la produzione e/o la modificazione delle sue forme. E’ sembrato importante, in un’ottica di ricostruzione dell’evoluzione “recente” dell’area siciliana, non trascurare i segnali morfologici la cui valutazione talvolta e' risultata fondamentale per l’individuazione di strutture di recente attivita'. L’utilizzo di queste due metodologie basate su differenti approcci, ha rappresentato il punto di partenza per portare avanti lo studio per l’individuazione di strutture attive, attraverso l’integrazione di diversi tipi d’indagini, compiute a scala diversa. Si e' passati, infatti, dall’interpretazione d’immagini da satellite, a scala regionale, con successiva analisi dei dati in ambiente GIS, attraverso il supporto di un Modello Digitale del Terreno (DEM) ad alta risoluzione, all’analisi di foto aeree e di carte topografiche a varia scala, fino ad arrivare all’analisi del singolo affioramento, condotta a scala metrica. E’ stata condotta anche l’analisi dell’abbondante sismicita' che caratterizza l’area in studio, partendo ovviamente dall’acquisizione dei dati registrati dalle stazioni dell’INGV e pubblicati nei numerosi cataloghi. La conoscenza dei dati sismici e sismologici costituisce un elemento fondamentale per l’identificazione e caratterizzazione delle strutture simicamente attive. Sono stati utilizzati dati relativi alla sismicita' storica derivati dai cataloghi, ma sono stati anche analizzati numerosi dati sismologici, anche inediti, relativi alla sismicita' piu' recente per alcune valutazioni relative alle implicazioni sismotettoniche. Per ricostruire il significato di alcune delle strutture individuate e il ruolo che queste assumono nell’evoluzione recente dell’area sud tirrenica, infine, con l’ausilio di alcuni ricercatori del Dipartimento di Scienze della Terra e del Mare dell’Università di Palermo e della Sezione di Geologia della Scuola di Scienze e Tecnologia dell’Università di Camerino, e' stato condotto uno studio specifico sulle piu' recenti sequenze sismiche che hanno interessato l’area in studio. Si fa particolare riferimento alla sequenza sismica che nel settembre 2002 ha interessato l’area sud-tirrenica; tale sequenza sismica a partire da un mainshock di M 5. 6 si e' protratta con fasi di maggiore e minore intensità fino a novembre 2002. Gli eventi registrati dalle numerose reti locali sono stati rilocalizzati e i dati sismologici ricalcolati e reinterpretati e infine confrontati con lo stato di stress indotto dal mainshock della sequenza, acquisendo cosi' interessanti spunti di discussione...|$|R
