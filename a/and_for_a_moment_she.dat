2500|$|Isabel Fitton, a viola pupil of Elgar. Elgar explained, [...] "It may {{be noticed}} that the opening bar, a phrase made use of {{throughout}} the variation, is <b>an</b> 'exercise' <b>for</b> crossing the strings – <b>a</b> difficulty <b>for</b> beginners; on this is built <b>a</b> pensive <b>and,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> romantic movement." ...|$|R
5|$|In 1936 the Belgian, Romain Maes, {{appeared}} to win but judges declared Frenchman Georges Speicher the winner and Maes second. Shouting {{began in the}} stands <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> {{it looked as though}} fighting would start, but calm returned and the result was upheld. A Belgian may not have won but there were seven Belgians in the first ten.|$|R
50|$|Although neither {{understand}} it, {{there is}} a strange affinity between this old man - who has lost his daughter - and the young boy who never knew his mother.

40|$|On what {{appeared}} to be a normal day off the Pacific coast of California, Scott Thomas was relaxing on his boat and enjoying a peaceful day of leisure. His wife had just gone below to grab two beers when he noticed a strange fog approaching. He stood up, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> the fog enveloped him.

2500|$|The {{commander}} of the 50th Tennessee emerged from the woods ahead of his skirmishers, and his heart sank. [...] To his right, a line of blue stretched {{as far as he}} could see. [...] To the left, he could hear Logan's two reserve regiments moving past his flank. [...] General Gregg had made a grave miscalculation. [...] The federal infantry brigade he had been ordered to rout from the field had somehow turned into an entire federal division. [...] The Confederate force withdrew across the creek with haste, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> was too stunned to do anything but stand in formation waiting for orders.|$|R
5|$|At first, {{the balance}} of power {{appeared}} to move slightly in Matilda's favour. Robert of Gloucester besieged Stephen in 1143 at Wilton Castle, <b>an</b> assembly point <b>for</b> royal forces in Herefordshire. Stephen attempted to break out and escape, resulting in the Battle of Wilton. Once again, the Angevin cavalry proved too strong, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> it appeared that Stephen might be captured <b>for</b> <b>a</b> second time, before finally managing to escape. Later in the year Geoffrey de Mandeville, the Earl of Essex, rose up in rebellion against Stephen in East Anglia. Geoffrey based himself from the Isle of Ely and began a military campaign against Cambridge, with the intention of progressing south towards London. Ranulf of Chester revolted once again in the summer of 1144.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Pen," [...] said Laura, {{reaching}} {{out her hand}} to her cousin, and he put his arm round her, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>she</b> sobbed on his shoulder.|$|E
60|$|His {{gaze was}} {{steadily}} searching <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>she</b> turned her head. Then, {{though there was}} a slight change in her manner, she looked around with a smile.|$|E
6000|$|... "I promise!" [...] I said, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>she</b> looked supremely happy. Though {{to me all}} {{happiness}} for her {{was denied}} by the red scar on her forehead.|$|E
50|$|According to the Daily Mail {{and other}} sources, she died from head {{injuries}} sustained while {{clinging to the}} door handle of her Porsche Cayenne while being dragged along the street at high speed as a carjacker drove the car away. She reportedly was pushed {{out of the vehicle}} <b>and,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> held on to the door handle before receiving her fatal head injuries. Police reported she died at the scene. She was 29 years old. The stolen vehicle was later abandoned in southwest Moscow. The carjacker has not been found. She left one child behind. Loginova had previously been successful in thwarting attempts to steal her car by using martial arts against a car thief. She was buried in the Ulybyshevo cemetery in Vladimir.|$|R
50|$|He stopped <b>and</b> gazed <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> at {{the horrible}} creatures, large as people, {{hanging from the}} limbs of the tree with their heads down like bats. They had wings to fly, and their toes were {{at the back of}} their feet, while their long fingers, which pointed backward, were {{fastened}} at the wrist.|$|R
50|$|Couples {{performed}} one musical theatre-inspired {{dance and}} a team-up dance with another couple, which involved the celebrities dancing side-by-side {{to the same}} song (<b>and,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments,</b> without the assistance of their pro partners) and receiving {{the same set of}} scores from the judges for the routine. Waltz is introduced.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Tryan paused. For {{a moment}} he had {{forgotten}} Janet, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>she</b> had forgotten her own sorrows. When she recurred to herself, {{it was with a}} new feeling.|$|E
60|$|He {{turned his}} eyes on her, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>she</b> was daunted by their cold glassiness. But before they could drive her away, {{something}} like the gleam of a spark gave them an instant's animation.|$|E
60|$|The girl laughed for {{the first}} time, and the swift change in her face almost startled the man. The coldness and reserve had gone, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>she</b> was, it seemed to him, subtly alluring.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of La Marfée {{took place}} during Thirty Years' War near Sedan, France, on 6 July 1641, between a Royal army of Louis XIII under Marshall Gaspard III de Coligny, and French malcontents led by Prince Louis de Bourbon, Count of Soissons, and Duke Frédéric Maurice de La Tour d'Auvergne, duc de Bouillon, who were {{supported}} by an Imperial-Spanish army under general Guillaume de Lamboy sent from the Spanish Netherlands by the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria. The French malcontents and the Habsburg forces dealt a serious defeat to the French Royal Army, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> Cardinal Richelieu feared that the rebels, supported by the Spanish forces, would advance on Paris. Shortly after, however, Soissons fell dead, either murdered by an assassin or killed by himself accidentally, and the rebellion vanished.|$|R
50|$|Having {{wandered into}} the city, Inugami finds himself in an {{abandoned}} building which Fumiki, an aspiring poet, frequents. After listening to Fumiki's poetry for some time, Inugami befriends the aspiring poet and eventually learns to speak, much to Fumiki's surprise. Through their friendship, Inugami realizes that not all humans are bad. Unfortunately a pharmaceutical corporation soon learns of Inugami's existence. Realizing that Inugami's regenerating cells could lead to immortality, the corporation attempts and succeeds at acquiring Inugami's gene's. Soon, the company ends up creating terrifying monsters. Soon, Inugami ends up {{in a fight with}} one of these monsters <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> questions the goodness of humans, who have created these monsters. In that fleeting <b>moment</b> of doubt, <b>a</b> different Inugami, with the intent to kill humans, appears.|$|R
5|$|The {{war between}} the two sides in England reached a {{stalemate}} in the mid-1140s, while Geoffrey of Anjou consolidated his hold on power in Normandy. 1143 started precariously for Stephen when he was besieged by Robert of Gloucester at Wilton Castle, <b>an</b> assembly point <b>for</b> royal forces in Herefordshire. Stephen attempted to break out and escape, resulting in the battle of Wilton. Once again, the Angevin cavalry proved too strong, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> it appeared that Stephen might be captured <b>for</b> <b>a</b> second time. On this occasion, however, William Martel, Stephen's steward, made a fierce rear guard effort, allowing Stephen to escape from the battlefield. Stephen valued William's loyalty sufficiently to agree to exchange Sherborne Castle for his safe release—this {{was one of the few}} instances where Stephen was prepared to give up a castle to ransom one of his men.|$|R
6000|$|She made, at this, a {{movement}} that drew his eyes to her own, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>she</b> dimly smiled at him. [...] "That's the nicest thing you ever said to me. But ever, EVER, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{sat down}} in the shade and took off her hat; <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>she</b> quietly enjoyed the cool breeze upon her head. He did not want to annoy her with questions, but he could not help saying: ...|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} on the Muslim left wing which Yazid commanded was considerably more serious. Whilst the Muslim right wing enjoyed assistance from the mobile guard, the left wing did not and the numerical advantage the Byzantines enjoyed caused the Muslim positions to be overrun, with soldiers retreating towards base camps. Here the Byzantines had broken through the corps. The testudo formation that Gregory's army had adopted moved slowly but also had a good defense. Yazid used his cavalry regiment to counterattack but was repulsed. Despite stiff resistance, the warriors of Yazid on the left flank finally fell back to their camps <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> Vahan's plan appeared to be succeeding. The centre of the Muslim army was pinned down and its flanks had been pushed back. However, neither flank had broken, though their morale was severely damaged.|$|R
25|$|Once in the match, Sakuraba {{was able}} to sneak in a double leg {{takedown}} after Funaki committed heavily to a missed right cross. Funaki closed guard around Sakuraba before opening it up to spin <b>for</b> <b>a</b> kneebar, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> Funaki appeared to secure Sakuraba's leg, but he was thwarted {{by a combination of}} Sakuraba's submission acumen and their position against the ring ropes. Sakuraba then maneuvered to Funaki's back, only for the Pancrase founder to roll back into the guard position. Breaking away momentarily from the grappling contest, Sakuraba stood up and began to assault Funaki's legs with a series of kicks, which Funaki answered with an upkick of his own, cutting Sakuraba's eye. Kazushi then returned himself to the ground, where Funaki immediately attempted to sweep him, but Sakuraba blocked the attempt and secured a Kimura lock or double wristlock, eventually forcing Funaki to submit.|$|R
2500|$|In [...] (2003), Boromir {{appears in}} the {{theatrical}} version during a brief flashback as Pippin remembers his heroic self-sacrifice. Due to that scene alone, Sean Bean's name and portrait {{appears in the}} closing credits of the film. In the Extended Edition of the film, Boromir appears briefly when Denethor looks at Faramir <b>and</b> imagines <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> that he sees Boromir walking towards him, smiling.|$|R
6000|$|Edna {{looked at}} her for a moment without answering. [...] "Yes," [...] she said presently, [...] "he is well. He is in Marseilles. The gold--" [...] <b>And</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>she</b> did not {{remember}} whether or not the captain had it.|$|E
6000|$|Judith started, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>she</b> seemed seriously hurt. Then she reflected, {{and in the}} end she laughed. [...] "And you think, Deerslayer, {{that these}} ivory toys are my father's Gods? I have heard of idols, and know what they are." ...|$|E
60|$|For a {{few moments}} she was silent. She looked at me however; and as I watched her eyes grow softer I {{suddenly}} held out my hand, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>she</b> suffered hers to rest in it. Then she drew away a little.|$|E
25|$|Colin had {{a health}} scare during {{the autumn of}} 1988 <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> it looked like EastEnders might have been about to do an AIDS storyline. The press speculated that Colin was showing early signs {{of the disease and}} the {{possibility}} was even briefly indicated to on-screen when Colin himself began to fear that his symptoms were AIDS related. In fact giving Colin AIDS was never the programme's intention — it was felt that the most simplistic and unhelpful message that the programme could give out would be to have its only homosexual character become HIV positive — particularly as it happened at a time when misconceptions and fear about AIDS were rife. Colin was eventually diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, although this fact was kept from him by his doctor {{for the remainder of the}} year and he lived out 1988 with the belief that he was in perfect health.|$|R
2500|$|Confederate Brig. Gen. Hamilton P. Bee, {{with two}} regiments in columns of four rode swiftly down the Pleasant Hill {{road toward the}} enemy lines. The Confederate forces were {{suddenly}} attacked at close range by Federals concealed behind a fence. [...] Winters describes the scene, accordingly: [...] "Men toppled from their saddles, wounded horses screamed in anguish, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> pandemonium reigned. Bee's men took temporary shelter [...] [...] [...] {{in a series of}} small ravines studded with young pines until they recovered from the shock of the unexpected attack. Bee rallied his men but in the process had two horses shot from under him. Colonel [...] Debray was injured when he fell from the saddle of his dead horse[...] [...] [...] Debray was able to withdraw his men safely to the rear leaving, however, about a third of them killed or wounded on the front." ...|$|R
