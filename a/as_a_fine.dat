5|$|As a young man, Kunichika had a {{reputation}} for a beautiful singing voice and <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> dancer. He is known to have used these talents in amateur burlesque shows.|$|E
5|$|The Annals by Tacitus {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{detailed}} accounts of Germanicus' campaigns against the Germans. He wrote his account in the early years of the second century. Tacitus described Germanicus <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> general who was kind and temperate, saying that his early death had taken a great ruler from Rome.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} {{received}} mostly positive reviews, with critics praising it <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> {{example in the}} adventure gaming genre. While most critics agreed the game addressed many flaws in The Sleeping Dragon, it has also received some criticism, particularly for its rushed ending and at times poor controls.|$|E
60|$|Ruth {{felt the}} change with a thrill of pride, yet dared suggest the {{possibility}} of failure, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>finer</b> nature would have shrunk from doing in such a happy, hopeful hour as that.|$|R
2500|$|Isinglass, {{from the}} swim {{bladders}} of fish, is still used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fining</b> agent for wine and beer. Besides hartshorn jelly, from deer antlers (hence the name [...] "hartshorn"), isinglass {{was one of}} the oldest sources of gelatin.|$|R
25|$|Irish moss (Chondrus crispus), often {{confused}} with Mastocarpus stellatus, {{is the source}} of carrageenan, which is used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> stiffening agent in instant puddings, sauces, and dairy products such as ice cream. Irish moss is also used by beer brewers <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fining</b> agent.|$|R
5|$|Another major 20th-century {{composer}} {{who engaged}} Beecham's sympathies was Sibelius, who recognised him <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> conductor {{of his music}} (although Sibelius tended to be lavish with praise of anybody who conducted his music). In a live recording of a December 1954 concert performance of Sibelius's Second Symphony with the BBC Symphony Orchestra in the Festival Hall, Beecham can be heard uttering encouraging shouts at the orchestra at climactic moments.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though their}} most recent single was doing poorly, Deep Purple {{maintained}} a reputation <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> live act in the US. The band had now begun to develop their stage presence into something grander, going in a louder and heavier direction and focusing {{more and more on}} the instrumental interplay between Blackmore and Lord. In particular the latter had found a way to short-circuit the original Leslie speakers of his Hammond organ C-3 and connect the instrument directly into the stacks of Marshall amps, obtaining a roaring sound and matching the guitar in loudness.|$|E
5|$|In late 1518, {{the post}} of the Leutpriestertum (people's priest) of the Grossmünster at Zurich became vacant. The canons of the {{foundation}} that administered the Grossmünster recognised Zwingli's reputation <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> preacher and writer. His connection with humanists was a decisive factor as several canons were sympathetic to Erasmian reform. In addition, {{his opposition to the}} French and to mercenary service was welcomed by Zurich politicians. On 11 December 1518, the canons elected Zwingli to become the stipendiary priest and on 27 December he moved permanently to Zurich.|$|E
30|$|Antimony {{was used}} {{from the early}} 1 st {{millennium}} BCE, and into the Roman period <b>as</b> <b>a</b> decolourant, <b>an</b> opacifier, and <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fining</b> agent to remove small seeds and bubbles in glass production [2 : p. 80, 6 : p. 116, 50 : p. 272, 61 : p. 179 T, 66 : pp. 116, 118, 121].|$|R
25|$|The {{production}} of Guinness, {{as with many}} beers, also {{involves the use of}} isinglass made from fish. Isinglass is used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fining</b> agent for settling out suspended matter in the vat. The isinglass is retained in the floor of the vat but it is possible that minute quantities might be carried over into the beer.|$|R
50|$|Chitosan has a {{long history}} for use <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fining</b> agent in winemaking. Fungal source {{chitosan}} has shown an increase in settling activity, reduction of oxidized polyphenolics in juice and wine, chelation and removal of copper (post-racking) and control of the spoilage yeast Brettanomyces. These products and uses are approved for European use by the EU and OIV standards.|$|R
5|$|After John's loss of Normandy, Maulay went to England and {{was given}} the manor of Upavon in Wiltshire. His grant of the manor was at the king's pleasure, because the manor, which had been held by a noble who {{forfeited}} his land in England by staying in Normandy after its loss, {{would need to be}} restored to its rightful holder if John recovered Normandy. He served as an envoy to Rome in 1213 and in 1214 was in command of royal forces at La Rochelle in France. In 1214 he married Isabella, the daughter and heiress of Robert of Thornham. Robert had died in 1211, so through his wife, Maulay acquired the Barony of Mulgrave in Yorkshire. Maulay paid the king 7000 marks <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> for the right to marry Isabella, one of the highest fines paid for the right to marry under John. According to the medieval chronicler Ralph of Coggeshall, Maulay was the murderer of John's nephew Arthur of Brittany.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{the last}} {{remaining}} major poets of the Silver Age, she was newly acclaimed by the Soviet authorities <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> and loyal representative of their country and permitted to travel. At the same time, by virtue of works such as Requiem, Akhmatova was being hailed at home and abroad as an unofficial leader of the dissident movement, and reinforcing this image herself. She was becoming representative of both the Soviet Union and Tsarist Russia, more popular in the 1960s than she had ever been before the revolution, this reputation only continuing to grow after her death. For her 75th birthday in 1964, new collections of her verse were published.|$|E
5|$|At Ostend, Vindictive did prevent larger {{warships}} {{passing through}} the channel, although smaller craft could still come and go at will. The larger warships in Bruges were trapped there for the remaining months of the war; the town was captured by the Allies in October 1918. The blockages at Ostend and Zeebrugge took several years to clear completely, not being totally removed until 1921. On a strategic scale {{the effects of the}} raids at Ostend and Zeebrugge on the battle of the Atlantic were negligible. Despite this, in Britain the Ostend Raid was feted as a success. Three Victoria Crosses and a host of lesser awards were given to the men involved. The Admiralty presented it <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> example of daring and careful planning from the Royal Navy, providing a valuable morale boost at {{one of the most critical}} moments of the war.|$|E
50|$|Caves attesting the {{presence}} of human settlements in the area {{as early as the}} Neolithic age have been found. During the Roman times, the burgh of Finale was known <b>as</b> <b>Ad</b> <b>Fines</b> ("On the Border"), as it marked the boundary between two of the main Ligurian tribes: the Sabatii in the east, and the Intemelii in the west.|$|R
25|$|The glass {{industry}} provides another significant application for sodium sulfate, as second largest application in Europe. Sodium sulfate is used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fining</b> agent, to help remove small air bubbles from molten glass. It fluxes the glass, and prevents scum {{formation of the}} glass melt during refining. The {{glass industry}} in Europe has been consuming from 1970 to 2006 a stable 110,000tonnes annually.|$|R

5|$|Construction began around 1210 by Bishop Jocelin of Wells but principally {{dates from}} 1230. Bishop Jocelin {{continued}} the cathedral building campaign begun by Bishop Reginald Fitz Jocelin, and {{was responsible for}} building the Bishop's Palace, {{as well as the}} choristers' school, a grammar school, a hospital for travellers and a chapel within the liberty of the cathedral. He also built a manor house at Wookey, near Wells. The chapel and great hall were built between 1275 and 1292 for Bishop Robert Burnell. The windows had stone tracery. Stone bosses where the supporting ribs meet on the ceiling are covered with representations of oak leaves and the Green Man. The building is seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> example of the Early English architectural style.|$|E
5|$|Her {{father was}} first elected to Dáil Éireann <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Fine</b> Gael Teachta Dála (TD) at the 2005 Meath by-election, winning the seat vacated by the {{resignation}} of former Taoiseach John Bruton, and was a popular figure with constituents. McEntee began to work in Leinster House as her father's personal assistant in May 2010 while he was an opposition TD. One of the first issues on which she worked with {{her father was a}} campaign on behalf of the owners of several thousand houses damaged by the use of pyrite, a material used as backfill during construction, that expands when damp or exposed to air. She considered standing as a candidate in the 2014 local elections, and discussed the prospect with her father, as well as the possibility of one day succeeding him {{as a member of the}} Dáil. She moved with him to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine when he was appointed minister of state after Fine Gael became a party of government following the 2011 general election.|$|E
5|$|Herring's {{twenty years}} as Chief Justice {{was a period}} of {{significant}} change and growth in the administration of the law. During his period of office the number of judges on the Court increased from six to fourteen, reflecting the growth in cases. Herring earned a reputation <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> judge and able administrator. He set up the Chief Justice's Law Reform Committee to try to ensure justice in Victoria's courts was abreast of the times, and a committee for religious observances and services to arrange the religious services marking the opening of the legal year. Herring retired as Chief Justice in 1964 but stayed on as Lieutenant Governor until his 80th birthday in 1972, serving in the position for a record 27 years. For his service as Lieutenant Governor, Herring was made a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in the King's Birthday Honours of 9 June 1949.|$|E

50|$|The {{screw jack}} {{consists}} of two simple machines in series; the long operating handle serves <b>as</b> <b>a</b> lever whose output force turns the screw. So the mechanical advantage is increased by <b>a</b> longer handle <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>finer</b> screw thread. However, most screw jacks have large amounts of friction which increase the input force necessary, so the actual mechanical advantage is often only 30% to 50% of this figure.|$|R

5|$|Jervis {{was also}} {{recognised}} by {{both political and}} military contemporaries <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> administrator and naval reformer. As Commander-in-chief of the Mediterranean, between 1795 and 1799 he introduced a series of severe standing orders to avert mutiny. He applied those orders to both seamen and officers alike, a policy {{that made him a}} controversial figure. He took his disciplinarian system of command with him when he took command of the Channel Fleet in 1799. In 1801, as First Lord of the Admiralty he introduced a number of reforms that, though unpopular at the time, made the Navy more efficient and more self-sufficient. He introduced innovations including block making machinery at Portsmouth Royal Dockyard. St Vincent was known for his generosity to officers he considered worthy of reward and his swift and often harsh punishment of those he felt deserved it.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{opinion of}} the theatre is more generous, with English Heritage {{describing}} the building as both Phipps' finest work {{and one of the}} best planned theatres in London. The building was Grade II* listed in January 1970. Appreciation of the buildings came too late to save the adjacent hotel from redevelopment as the new High Commission for New Zealand, completed in 1963 by British architects Robert Matthew, Johnson Marshall and Partners, who also designed the Commonwealth Institute. In 1995, this too was Grade II listed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> example of 1960s architecture. The 200-year-old Royal Opera Arcade, built by Nash and Repton, is all that survives of the second theatre and is the earliest example of a London arcade.|$|E
5|$|Morris {{took up the}} {{practical}} art of dyeing as a necessary adjunct of his manufacturing business. He {{spent much of his}} time at Staffordshire dye works mastering the processes of that art and making experiments in the revival of old or discovery of new methods. One result of these experiments was to reinstate indigo dyeing as a practical industry and generally to renew the use of those vegetable dyes, such as the red derived from madder, which had been driven almost out of use by the anilines. Dyeing of wools, silks, and cottons was the necessary preliminary to what he had much at heart, the production of woven and printed fabrics of the highest excellence; and the period of incessant work at the dye-vat (1875–76) was followed by a period during which he was absorbed in the production of textiles (1877–78), and more especially in the revival of carpet-weaving <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> art.|$|E
5000|$|As a food additive, PVP is a {{stabilizer}} and has E number E1201. PVPP (crospovidone) is E1202. It is {{also used}} in the wine industry <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fining</b> agent for white wine or some beers. Other references state that polyvinyl pyrrolidone and its derivatives are fully from mineral synthetic origin. Therefore, its use in the production [...] {{should not be a}} problem for vegans.|$|R

The asymptotic behaviour {{of the maximum}} likelihood estimators of them is analysed in terms of mutually independent X 2 -distributions. On {{the basis of the}} results, the concept of semi-independence is introduced <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>finer</b> one of the concept of independence in the ordinary sense, and is used to interpret various multiple interactions...|$|R

5|$|On the hardwood, he was {{considered}} the consummate defensive center, noted for his unmatched defensive intensity, his stellar basketball IQ and his sheer will to win. Russell excelled at playing man-to-man defense, blocking shots, and grabbing defensive and offensive rebounds. Opponent Wilt Chamberlain said Russell's timing as a shot-blocker was unparalleled. Russell “was the smartest player ever {{to play the game}} ” according to Bill Bradley, Russell’s erstwhile Knicks opponent writing in 2009. He also could score with putbacks and made mid-air outlet passes to point guard Bob Cousy for easy fast break points. He also was known <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> passer and pick-setter, featured a decent left-handed hook shot and finished strong on alley oops. However, on offense, Russell's output was limited. His NBA career personal averages show him to be an average scorer (15.1 points career average), a poor free throw shooter (56.1%), and average overall shooter from the field (44%, not exceptional for a center). In his 13 years, he averaged a relatively low 13.4 field goals attempted (normally, top scorers average 20 and more), illustrating that he was never {{the focal point of the}} Celtics offense, instead focusing on his tremendous defense.|$|E

50|$|Pevsner praised {{his work}} at Rubery and Redditch. St Chad’s Church, Rubery is {{described}} <b>as</b> being <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> Modernist example, and his crematorium at Redditch <b>as</b> <b>a</b> model example for that class of building.|$|R
