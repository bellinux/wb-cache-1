To do so, the evolution of finite-amplitude synoptic cyclones in various baroclinic zonal flows is analyzed. Baroclinic zonal flows with uniform horizontal shears are first considered. While the <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>shear</b> allows a much more efficient and sustainable extraction of potential energy than the cyclonic shear, {{the growth of the}} lower-layer eddy kinetic energy (EKE) is shown to be highly dependent on the choice of the parameter values. An increased vertical shear leads to a more rapid EKE increase in the <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>shear</b> than in the cyclonic shear whereas increasing the vertically averaged potential vorticity gradient or the barotropic shear stabilizes the EKE more in the former shear than in the latter. Finally, vertical velocities arising from the nonlinear interaction between synoptic cyclones are shown to favor EKE growth in the cyclonic shear rather than in the anticyclonic one. The evolution of cyclones initialized on the warm side of a meridionally confined baroclinic jet is then investigated. The lower-layer cyclone crosses the jet axis and undergoes two distinct growth stages. The first growth stage results from the classical baroclinic interaction and is mainly driven by linear interaction between the cyclones and the jet. The second growth stage is mainly a nonlinear process. It is triggered by the vertical velocities created by the three-dimensional structure of the cyclonic disturbances when they reach the cyclonic side of the jet...|$|E

40|$|The wide {{disparities in}} {{baroclinic}} wave development between spherical and Cartesian geometry are investigated {{with the purpose}} of assessing the role of the eddy momentum fluxes. Differences are already significant at the linear stage, as momentum fluxes are predominantly poleward in spherical geometry and predominantly equatorward in Cartesian geometry. More important, the low-level flux convergence is displaced poleward on the sphere and equatorward on the plane. On the sphere, these circumstances lead to rapid poleward movement of the low-level zonal-mean jet. The <b>anticyclonic</b> horizontal <b>shear</b> region expands as the jet feeds back on the momentum flux. The wave breaks anticyclonically and quickly zonalizes. In the Cartesian life cycle, the equatorward displacement of the flux convergence is counteracted by the mean meridional circulation and there is consequently a weaker feedback with the horizontal shear. The wave breaks, in this case cyclonically, but then takes much longer to zonalize. On the sphere, the angular velocity gradient in uniform westerly or easterly flow adds a separate mechanism for converting eddy kinetic energy to zonal mean, further hastening the zonalization process. It is possible to change the sign of the eddy momentum flux and the sense of the breaking in either geometry by slightly changing the basic flow.

The vortex street was generated near the midtroposphere on the north edge of a cloud band along the cold front.

The poleward eddy flnx of westerly momentum produced by wave numbers 1 - 4 is a niaximum over the South Atlantic. Betwcen 40 " and 6 OoS, semiannual and annual variations in zonal and meridional wind are of similar magnitude, resulting in a west-wind maximum near the vernal equinox and a sccondary maximum near the autumnal equinox. The inferred mean meridional velocity attains values of 0. 3 m/s, with equator-ward flow indicated as occurring in summer and autumn (when the west wind is relatively weak) and poleward flow in winter and spring (when the west wind is relatively strong).

40|$|Depth-time {{records of}} isopycnal {{vertical}} strain {{have been collected}} from intensive CTD profiling programs on the research platform (R/P) Floating Instrument Platform (FLIP). The associated vertical wavenumber frequency spectrum of strain, when viewed in an isopycnal-following frame, displays a clear spectral gap at low vertical wavenumber, separating the quasigeostrophic (vortical) strain field and the superinertial internal wave continuum. This gap enables both model and linear-filter-based methods for separating the submesoscale and internal wave strain fields. These fields are examined independently in six field programs spanning the period 1983 - 2002. Vortical and internal wave strain variances are often comparable in the upper thermocline, of order 0. 2. However, vortical strain tends to decrease with increasing depth (decreasing buoyancy frequency as N 2 = -g/ρ(dρ/dz) ~(N 2) 1 / 2, while internal wave strain variance increases as ~(N 2) 1 / 2, exceeding vortical variance {{by a factor of}} 5 - 10 at depths below 500 m. In contrast to strain, the low-frequency spectral gap in the shear spectrum is largely obscured by Doppler-smeared near-inertial motions. The vertical wavenumber spectrum of <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>shear</b> exceeds the cyclonic shear and strain spectra at all scales greater than 10 m.

The limited Doppler shifting of the vortical strain field implies surprisingly small submesoscale aspect ratios: k H /k z ~ 0. 001, Burger numbers Br = k H N/k z f ~ 0. 1. Submesoscale potential vorticity is dominated by vertical straining rather than the vertical component of relative vorticity.

40|$|International audienceMechanisms {{leading a}} {{synoptic}} surface cyclone to cross an upper-level zonal jet and its subsequent deepening are investigated using a two-layer model on a β plane. The baroclinic interaction of a low-level circular cyclonic perturbation with an upper-level one is first studied in {{vertical and horizontal}} cyclonic or <b>anticyclonic</b> uniform <b>shears.</b> A first nonlinear effect acting on the shape and energetics of the perturbations is analyzed. If the background <b>shear</b> is <b>anticyclonic,</b> the perturbations are stretched horizontally; they lose energy barotropically but gain it baroclinically by a well-maintained westward tilt with height. Conversely, if the shear is cyclonic, perturbations remain quite isotropic, {{but they do not}} keep a favorable vertical tilt with time and the baroclinic interaction is thus only transient. The latitudinal motion of the perturbations also results from a nonlinear effect. It is found to depend strongly on the background potential vorticity (PV) gradient. This effect is a baroclinic equivalent of the so-called nonlinear barotropic "β drift" and combines the nonlinear advection and vertical stretching terms. These results are confirmed when the anomalies are initially located south of a confined westerly jet. The poleward shift of the lower cyclonic anomaly occurs faster when the vertically averaged PV gradient is strongly positive, which happens when the jet has a large barotropic component. The lower anomaly crosses the jet from the warm to the cold side and deepens afterward.

40|$|Tropical upper-tropospheric troughs (TUTTs), {{also known}} as midoceanic troughs, are {{elongated}} troughs that appear in summer monthly averaged maps of the upper-tropospheric flow over the oceans. The transient part of these climatological features is composed of TUTT cells and their origin {{is the subject of}} this study. TUTT cells often occur to the east of tropical cyclones. A nonlinear shallow water model on the sphere was used in a simplified study of the interactions between tropical cyclones and the circumpolar vortex. Based on the results of these simulations and keeping in mind their limitations, it is proposed that dispersion of short Rossby wave energy is a possible mechanism to explain the formation of TUTT cells to the east of tropical cyclones. The model simulations suggest that two types of TUTT cells may form to the east of tropical cyclones. When embedded in cyclonic or weak <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>shear,</b> the trough to the east of the tropical cyclone may broaden, resulting in the formation of an intense TUTT cell that has a strong signature in the wind and mass fields. In the presence of stronger <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>shear,</b> the trough to the east of the tropical cyclone may become a thin and elongated TUTT cell that has a comparatively negligible signature in the mass and flow fields. Moreover, the model simulations indicate that the mode of evolution of TUTT cells that form to the east of a tropical cyclone is strongly dependent on the intensity and relative location of midlatitude waves. Wave–mean flow interaction calculations indicated that tropical cyclones produced a westerly acceleration of the mean zonal flow in the latitudinal band through which they move and an easterly acceleration elsewhere. These calculations also indicated that broadening TUTT cells may cause an easterly acceleration of the zonal mean flow. 1...|$|E

Inertial instability (hereafter II), {{which is}} a centrifugal instability mechanism {{in the presence of}} the Coriolis force, is a destructive mechanism that acts only on anti-cyclones, and therefore is hypothesized to cause this asymmetry.

40|$|International audienceThe {{combined}} {{effects of}} the deformation (horizontal stretching and shearing) and nonlinearities on the beta drift of midlatitude cyclones are studied using a barotropic quasigeostrophic model on the beta plane. It is found that, without any background flow, a cyclonic vortex moves more rapidly northward when it is initially strongly stretched along a mostly north-south direction. This meridional stretching is more efficient at forming an anticyclone {{to the east of}} the cyclone through Rossby wave radiation. The cyclone-anticyclone couple then forms a nonlinear vortex dipole that propagates mostly northward. The case of a cyclone embedded in uniformly sheared zonal flows is then studied. A cyclone evolving in an <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>shear</b> is stretched more strongly, develops a stronger anticyclone, and moves faster northward than a cyclone embedded in a cyclonic shear, which remains almost isotropic. Similar results are found in the general case of uniformly sheared nonzonal flows. The evolution of cyclones is also investigated {{in the case of a}} more realistic meandering jet whose relative vorticity gradient creates an effective beta and whose deformation field is spatially varying. Astatistical study reveals a strong correlation among the cyclone's stretching, the anticyclone strength, and the velocity toward the jet center. These different observations agree with the more idealized cases. Finally, these results provide a rationale for the existence of preferential zones for the jet-crossing phase: that is, the phase when a cyclone crosses a jet from its anticyclonic to its cyclonic side. © 2012 American Meteorological Society...|$|E

The {{published}} {{article is}} copyrighted by the American Geophysical Union {{and can be}} found at: [URL] transects over the eastern flank of Barrow Canyon were obtained in August 2005 with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Here, the shelf topography creates a “choke” point in which a substantial portion of Pacific inflow from the Bering Strait is concentrated within 30 km of the coast, providing an ideal setup for monitoring the flow with the AUV. Four transects, extending ~ 10 km offshore of Barrow, Alaska, inshore of the ~ 80 m isobath, were used in conjunction with a process-oriented numerical model to diagnose the wind-driven modification of the Alaskan coastal current. Poleward transports of 0. 12 Sv were consistent among all sections, although the transport-weighted temperature was about 1 °C colder in the transect obtained during peak winds. An idealized numerical model reproduces the observed hydrographic structure and across-shelf circulation reasonably well in that (1) winds were not sufficient to reverse the poleward flow, (2) upwelling was most pronounced in the nearshore, and (3) the onshore return flow occurred throughout the interior as opposed to the bottom boundary layer. The across-shelf circulation provides a possible mechanism for a meltwater intrusion observed on the offshore side of the AUV transect made during peak winds. Also of interest is that the observed <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>shear</b> was much stronger (∣∂u/∂y∣ > f) than previously measured in the region...|$|E
40|$|The {{combined}} {{effects of}} the deformation (horizontal stretching and shearing) and nonlinearities on the beta drift of midlatitude cyclones are studied using a barotropic quasigeostrophic model on the beta plane. It is found that, without any background flow, a cyclonic vortex moves more rapidly northward when it is initially strongly stretched along a mostly north–south direction. This meridional stretching is more efficient at forming an anticyclone {{to the east of}} the cyclone through Rossby wave radiation. The cyclone–anticyclone couple then forms a nonlinear vortex dipole that propagates mostly northward. The case of a cyclone embedded in uniformly sheared zonal flows is then studied. A cyclone evolving in an <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>shear</b> is stretched more strongly, develops a stronger anticyclone, and moves faster northward than a cyclone embedded in a cyclonic shear, which remains almost isotropic. Similar results are found in the general case of uniformly sheared nonzonal flows. The evolution of cyclones is also investigated {{in the case of a}} more realistic meandering jet whose relative vorticity gradient creates an effective beta and whose deformation field is spatially varying. A statistical study reveals a strong correlation among the cyclone’s stretching, the anticyclone strength, and the velocity toward the jet center. These different observations agree with the more idealized cases. Finally, these results provide a rationale for the existence of preferential zones for the jet-crossing phase: that is, the phase when a cyclone crosses a jet from its anticyclonic to its cyclonic side. 1...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{report a}} {{hypothesis}} for the dynamical mechanisms {{responsible for the}} strengthening of the Southern Hemisphere circumpolar winds from the lower stratosphere to the surface due to the ozone hole. A general circulation model forced by stratospheric ozone depletion representative of the ozone hole period successfully reproduced these observed changes. Investigation of the dynamical characteristics of the model therefore provides {{some insight into the}} actual mechanisms. From this the authors suggest the following: 1) An initial (radiative) strengthening of the lower-stratospheric winds as a result of ozone depletion conditions the polar vortex so that fewer planetary waves propagate up from the troposphere, resulting in weaker planetary wave driving. 2) This causes further strengthening of the vortex, which results in an additional reduction in upward-propagating planetary waves and initiates a positive feedback mechanism in which the weaker wave driving and the associated strengthened winds are drawn downward to the tropopause. 3) In the troposphere the midlatitude jet shifts poleward in association with increases in the synoptic wave fluxes of heat and momentum, which are the result of a positive feedback mechanism consisting of two components: 4) increases in low-level baroclinicity, and the subsequent generation of baroclinic activity (associated with a poleward heat flux), are collocated with the jet latitudinal position, and 5) strengthening <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>shear</b> increases the refraction of wave activity equatorward (associated with a poleward momentum flux). Finally, 6) confinement of planetary waves in the high-latitude troposphere is an important step to couple the stratospheric changes to the tropospheric response...|$|E
40|$|Subcritical {{transition}} to turbulence in Keplerian accretion disks {{is still a}} controversial issue and some theoretical progress is {{required in order to}} determine whether or not this scenario provides a plausible explanation for the origin of angular momentum transport in non-magnetized accretion disks. Motivated by the recent discoveries of exact nonlinear steady self-sustaining solutions in linearly stable non-rotating shear flows, we attempt to compute similar solutions in Rayleigh-stable rotating plane Couette flows and to identify transition mechanisms in such flows by combining nonlinear continuation methods and asymptotic theory. We obtain exact nonlinear solutions for Rayleigh-stable cyclonic regimes but show that it is not possible to compute solutions for Rayleigh-stable anticyclonic regimes, including Keplerian flow, using similar techniques. We also present asymptotic descriptions of these various problems at large Reynolds numbers that provide some insight into the differences between the non-rotating and Rayleigh-stable anticyclonic regimes and derive some necessary conditions for mechanisms analogous to the non-rotating self-sustaining process to be present in flows on the Rayleigh line. Our results demonstrate that subcritical transition mechanisms cannot be identified in wall-bounded Rayleigh-stable <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>shear</b> flows by transposing directly the phenomenology of subcritical transition in cyclonic and non-rotating wall-bounded shear flows. Asymptotic developments, however, leave open the possibility that nonlinear self-sustaining solutions may exist in unbounded or periodic flows on the Rayleigh line. These could serve as a starting point to discover solutions in Rayleigh-stable flows, but the nonlinear stability of Keplerian accretion disks remains to be determined. Comment: 16 pages, 12 figures.

40|$|CTD and ADCP {{measurements}} {{together with}} a sequence of satellite images indicate pronounced current meandering and eddy activity in the western Black Sea during April 1993. The Rim Current is identi"ed as a well-de"ned meandering jet stream con"ned over the steepest topographic slope and associated cyclonic}anticyclonic eddy pairs located on both its sides. It has a form of highly energetic and unstable #ow system, which, as it propagates cyclonically along {{the periphery of the}} basin, is modi"ed in character. It possesses a two-layer vertical structure with uniform upper layer speed in excess of 50 cm/s (maximum value & 100 cm/s), followed by a relatively sharp change across the pycnocline (between 100 and 200 m) and the uniform sub-pycnocline currents of 20 cm/s (maximum value & 40 cm/s) observed up to the depth of& 350 dbar, being the approximate limit of ADCP measurements. The cross-stream velocity structure exhibits a narrow core region (& 30 km), #anked by a narrow zone of <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>shear</b> on its coastal side and a broader region of cyclonic shear on its o!shore side. The northwestern shelf circulation is generally decoupled from the in#uence of the basinwide circulation and is characterized by much weaker currents, less than 10 cm/s. The southward coastal #ow associated with the Danube and Dinepr Rivers is weak during the measurement period and is restricted to a very narrow coastal zone. The data suggest the presence of temperature-induced overturning prior to the measure-ments, and subsequent formation of the Cold Intermediate Water mass (CIW) within the Northwestern Shelf (NWS) and interior of the western basin.

40|$|Idealized {{numerical}} {{experiments are}} conducted {{to understand the}} effect of upper-tropospheric potential vorticity (PV) anomalies on an environment conducive to severe weather. Anomalies are specified as a single isolated vortex, a string of vortices analogous to a negatively tilted trough, {{and a pair of}} string vortices analogous to a position error in a negatively tilted trough. The anomalies are placed adjacent to the tropopause along a strong upper-level jet at a time just prior to a major tornado outbreak and inverted using the nonlinear balance equations. In addition to the expected destabilization beneath and adjacent to a cyclonic PV anomaly, the spatial pattern of the inverted balanced streamfunction and height fields is distorted by the presence of the horizontal PV gradient along the upper-tropospheric jet stream. Streamfunction anomalies are elongated in the cross-jet direction, while height and temperature anomalies are elongated in the along-jet direction. The amplitude of the inverted fields, as well as the changes in CAPE associated with the inverted temperature perturbations, are linearly proportional to the amplitudes of the PV anomalies themselves, and the re-sponses to complex PV perturbation structures are approximated by the sum of the responses to individual simple PV anomalies. This is true for the range of PV amplitudes tested, which was designed to mimic typical 6 -h forecast or analysis errors and produced changes in CAPE beneath the trough of well over 100 J kg 1. Impacts on inverted fields are largest when the PV anomaly is on the <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>shear</b> side of the jet, where background PV is small, compared with the cyclonic shear side of the jet, where background PV is large. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{establishment}} {{and maintenance of}} the mean hydrographic properties of large scale density fronts in the upper ocean is considered. The dynamics is studied by posing an initial value problem starting with a near surface discharge of buoyant water with a prescribed density deficit into an ambient stationary fluid of uniform density. The full time dependent diffusion and Navier-Stokes equations for a constant Coriolis parameter are used in this study. Scaling analysis reveals three independent length scales of the problem, namely a radius of deformation or inertial length scale, Lo, a buoyance length scale, ho, and a diffusive length scale, hv. Two basic dimensionless parameters are then formed from these length scales, the thermal (or more precisely, the densimetric) Rossby number, Ro = Lo/ho and the Ekman number, E = hv/ho. The governing equations are then suitably scaled and the resulting normalized equations are shown to depend on E alone for problems of oceanic interest. Under this scaling, the solutions are similar for all Ro. It is also shown that 1 /Ro {{is a measure of}} the frontal slope. The governing equations are solved numerically and the scaling analysis is confirmed. The solution indicates that an equilibrium state is established. The front can then be rendered stationary by a barotropic current from a larger scale along-front pressure gradient. In that quasisteady state, and for small values of E, the main thermocline and the inclined isopycnics forming the front have evolved, together with the along-front jet. Conservation of potential vorticity is also obtained in the light water pool. The surface jet exhibits <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>shear</b> in the light water pool and cyclonic shear across the front...|$|E
40|$|A {{planetary}} and synoptic-scale {{analysis of}} a relatively rare continental blocking event that occurred over North America {{during the spring of}} 1980 are undertaken {{to determine whether or not}} this event was different from its counterparts which occur over oceanic regions. The planetary-scale analysis demonstrates that, during the spring season, a ridge was located further inland over the North American continent and amplified with respect to climatology. The position of this ridge may have been linked to a broad region of colder-than-normal SSTs found over the north central Pacific during the spring season and much of the previous winter. Simple "Sutcliffe-type" and thermodynamic analyses of the accompanying lower tropospheric warm anomaly associated with the ridging shows that lower tropospheric temperature advection and subsidence associated with anticyclonic vorticity advection by the time mean thermal wind produced much of the anomalous warmth. A simple synoptic-scale analysis was performed using both the Zwack-Okossi (ZO) equation and potential vorticity (PV) thinking approaches. These complementary analyses demonstrated that synoptic-scale cyclones were instrumental in the formation and maintenance (and/or intensification) of this blocking event. The PV analysis demonstrated that low-PV air was swept poleward and then was advected over the blocking region sustaining the broad region of low potential vorticity associated with the block over North America. The ZO analysis showed that the advection of anticyclonic vorticity was the most important mechanism forcing geopotential height rises at 500 hPa over the block center. The region of low PV and ZO height rises could be associated with the <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>shear</b> side of an upstream jet maximum typically found in association with developing and/or intensifying blocking event. Thus, negative PV advection correlated significantly with calculated ZO height rises. Finally, it is suggested that a favorable phase-relationship between the upstream cyclones and the large-scale ridge is necessary for block development or intensification...|$|E
