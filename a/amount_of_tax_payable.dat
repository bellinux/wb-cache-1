25|$|The Isle of Man is a low-tax {{economy with}} no capital gains tax, wealth tax, stamp duty, or {{inheritance}} tax {{and a top}} rate of income tax of 20%. A tax cap is in force; the maximum <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> <b>payable</b> by an individual is £120,000 or £240,000 for couples {{if they choose to}} have their incomes jointly assessed. The £120,000 tax cap equates to an assessable income of £589,550. Personal income is assessed and taxed on a total worldwide income basis rather than a remittance basis. This means that all income earned throughout the world is assessable for Manx tax rather than only income earned in or brought into the Island.|$|E

50|$|In the 12th century, the English monarchy {{introduced}} {{an early version}} of the bill of exchange {{in the form of a}} notched piece of wood known as a tally stick. Tallies originally came into use at a time when paper was rare and costly, but their use persisted until the early 19th Century, even after paper forms of money had become prevalent. The notches were used to denote various <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>payable</b> to the crown. Initially tallies were simply used as a form of receipt to the tax payer at the time of rendering his dues. As the revenue department became more efficient, they began issuing tallies to denote a promise <b>of</b> the <b>tax</b> assessee to make future tax payments at specified times during the year. Each tally consisted of a matching pair - one stick was given to the assessee at the time of assessment representing the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxes</b> to be paid later and the other held by the Treasury representing the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxes</b> be collected at a future date.|$|R

30|$|We may, however, {{have avoided}} – {{and perhaps even}} {{reversed}} – this type of bias through {{the inclusion of the}} Resourcecostshare variable, defined as the share of the retail price that is not made up by tax. Since it is positively related to the manufacturing and marketing cost of the vehicle, one possible interpretation of the Resourcecostshare variable could be as a residual measure of quality, over and above the quality attributes already included in the regression. It could, on the other hand, also reflect circumstances such as the manufacturer’s market power, profitability or production inefficiency, or simply the vehicle customers’ psychological aversion against taxpaying. Being inversely related to the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> purchase <b>tax</b> <b>payable,</b> it tends to decrease with the vehicle’s weight, engine power and rate of CO 2 emissions.

5000|$|PAYE {{is applied}} to sick pay, {{maternity}} pay, directors' fees and pensions (but not the state pension), as well as wages and salaries.

5000|$|Almost {{all states}} operate a {{collection}} {{system for taxation}} revenues within a framework of law, and enforced through independent courts. Enabling statutes must be strictly applied, and it is generally against public policy to allow the tax administration to agree to reduce the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> <b>payable</b> by any one individual. Like criminal law where agreements by the policing authorities to exempt a criminal are prohibited, tax law has a special status as being essential to an organised society in maintaining public trust through the policy of equal treatment in the legal system. Nevertheless, if a tax payer organises his or her affairs so as to exploit a loophole in the law and avoid the incidence of tax liability, this will usually be permitted. It {{is not for the}} courts to legislate and plug the gaps left by the legislature. The test of avoidance will be whether there is a legitimate purpose for the given behaviour. Many states adopt a [...] "business purpose" [...] test, decomposing the transaction into its component steps to determine the true purpose of the transaction(s) (see tax avoidance/evasion).|$|E
50|$|In 1368, {{the first}} year of the reign of the Ming Hongwu Emperor, the Capital Grain Transport Office (京畿都漕运司) was {{established}} under the auspices of a fourth grade (四品) commissioner. At the same time, a Cáoyùn governor-general’s office was set up in the prefectural capital of Huai'an, Jiangsu Province. Its responsibilities were to manage the Cáoyùn network and ensure that annual grain shipments remained at around 40 million tons. Boatyards were also established in Anqing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Jiujiang, Zhangshu and Raozhou (饶州) (modern day Poyang County). At Huai'an, a boatyard 15 km northwest of the Yangtze River ran for a distance of 23 Chinese miles (c. 11.5 km. Overall responsibility for all these locations lay with a department of the Ministry of Works.Every year, regulations fixed the total <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> <b>payable</b> by the entire country in grain via the Cáoyùn system at 29.5 million bushels. Of this, 12 million bushels were allocated to local governments, 8 million bushels supported the army on the northern border, 1.2 million bushels went to the capital in Nanjing whilst 8.2 million bushels were used to supply Beijing.|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of {{transfer}} pricing provisions {{is to ensure that}} associated enterprises, when conducting intra-group business, transact at arm´s length. Traditionally this has been considered implying that the pricing of transactions between associated enterprises must be at arm´s length. However, lately tax authorities´ focus has shifted from the pricing of transactions to the transaction structures. It is evident that also the transaction structure affects the division of profits between the associated enterprises. The {{purpose of this study is}} to look into the arm´s length provisions, as they are formulated in both tax treaty context and domestic law, in order to conclude whether the current wordings of the provisions allow the tax authorities to question the transaction structures chosen by the taxpayer, i. e. to restructure transactions. In Finnish domestic law the arm´s length principle is expressed in VML § 31. In tax treaty context, the arm´s length principle is expressed in Art. 9 (1) of the OECD Model Tax Convention. The wordings of the provisions are not identical but both are said to replicate the arm´s length principle, as expressed in the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines. The Guidelines state that the recognition of the actual transaction is the principal rule, but that restructuring of transactions is allowed in exceptional circumstances. However, neither the wording of Art. 9 (1) nor VML § 31 seem to directly support such possibility. Even in a tax treaty context, the taxation must be based on domestic law. The tax liability can never be based solely on the tax treaty provisions. It follows that tax treaties can restrict the application of domestic law, but can never broaden the taxing rights under domestic law. This has been called the golden rule <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> treaty law. It follows that even if Art. 9 (1) would be interpreted as to allow the restructuring of transactions, also VML § 31 must be able to be interpreted in such a way. The application and interpretation <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> rules is subject to the principle of legality, as expressed in Section 81 of the Constitution of Finland. It follows that taxes must be governed by law. The taxpayer must be able to recognize the basic factors affecting the tax liability and the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>payable</b> <b>tax</b> straight out <b>of</b> the wording of the provision. These factors cannot be regulated or specified on a subordinate level. Due to the strict principle of legality, the interpretation <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> rules is governed by the wording of the provision. The interpretation cannot result in an outcome that is contrary to the wording of the provision, not even in cases where the purpose of the provision would support such outcome. But when the wording of the provision leaves the interpretation open, other sources of interpretation must be used to support the wording. Due to the general formulation of VML § 31, the accurate scope of the provision is determined in case law. Hence, case law has an emphasized influence on the interpretation of the provision...|$|R

40|$|The {{last fifteen}} years have {{witnessed}} {{significant changes in the}} way that charitable contributions by individuals are treated under the Canadian Income Tax Act. The most significant of these changes involves the conversion in 1988 of what had previously been a deduction for charitable contributions whereby the value of the tax benefit depends on the donor?s level of income, into a tax credit under which the value of this benefit depends on the total amount of charitable contributions claimed in the particular taxation year. As a result of this amendment, Canada has become the only developed country that recognizes charitable contributions by individuals {{in the form of a}} tax credit rather than a deduction. This paper evaluates the merits of this policy change and the structure of the Canadian charitable contributions tax credit in light of alternative possible rationales for the recognition of these gifts in computing the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> <b>payable</b> under an income tax. Part II reviews the history of Canadian income tax provisions regarding charitable contributions by individuals and explains the structure of the current tax credit and related provisions governing the tax treatment of charitable contributions by individuals. Part III examines alternative rationales and related tax designs for the recognition of these charitable gifts in computing the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> <b>payable</b> under an income tax, rejecting the views that recognition is necessary to define income or reward altruism, but accepting the arguments that tax assistance may have a useful role to play to promote pluralism by encouraging donations.
