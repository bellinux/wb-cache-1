5|$|Convolution {{is used to}} <b>add</b> <b>two</b> {{independent}} {{random variables}} defined by distribution functions. Its usual definition combines integration, subtraction, and multiplication. In general, convolution is useful {{as a kind of}} domain-side addition; by contrast, vector addition is a kind of range-side addition.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Toronto City Councillor Paul Sutherland {{proposed}} to <b>add</b> <b>two</b> toll lanes {{in each direction}} along the parkway, from Highway401 to Eglinton Avenue. From Eglinton Avenue south, one lane in each direction would be added. The proposal was criticized by transportation experts such as Transport 2000 for encouraging driving to downtown. Sutherland estimated {{the cost of the}} proposal at $200 million.|$|E
5|$|At a 2006 {{conference on}} Commonwealth honours, Christopher McCreery, {{an expert on}} Canada's honours, raised the concern that the three grades of the Order of Canada were {{insufficient}} to recognize the nation's very best; one suggestion was to <b>add</b> <b>two</b> more levels to the order, equivalent to knighthoods in Australian and British orders. The order of precedence also came under scrutiny, particularly the anomaly that all three grades of the Order of Canada supersede the top levels {{of each of the}} other orders (except the Order of Merit), contrary to international practice.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} {{pre-production}} {{on the third}} series began, Bullen had grown tired of writing the series single-handedly and believed all the stories that could be told had been told. ITV were keen {{to increase the number}} of episodes per series to 20 but Granada refused, though did agree to <b>add</b> <b>two</b> more, bringing the total to eight. A writing team of five was assembled, overseen by Bullen. Four of the scriptwriters were deemed not good enough and they parted company with Granada. David Nicholls remained and scripted four of the eight-third series episodes; Bullen wrote the other four and his interest in the series was revived.|$|E
5|$|With the Posse folding, the Gold Miners moving, and the Pirates facing money {{troubles}} {{three of}} the four CFL expansion teams had stumbled. The league, however, still managed to <b>add</b> <b>two</b> new cities before the 1995 season. The Memphis Mad Dogs were announced in November 1994, followed by the Birmingham Barracudas in January 1995. The Memphis deal was hailed as a large step forward for the league's presence in the US as it brought in the marketing connections of Federal Express and the wealth of its founder Fred Smith.|$|E
5|$|Analog {{computers}} {{work directly}} with physical quantities, so their addition mechanisms {{depend on the}} form of the addends. A mechanical adder might represent two addends as the positions of sliding blocks, in which case they can be added with an averaging lever. If the addends are the rotation speeds of two shafts, they can be added with a differential. A hydraulic adder can add the pressures in two chambers by exploiting Newton's second law to balance forces on an assembly of pistons. The most common situation for a general-purpose analog computer is to <b>add</b> <b>two</b> voltages (referenced to ground); this can be accomplished roughly with a resistor network, but a better design exploits an operational amplifier.|$|E

5|$|From {{the advent}} of very-large-scale {{integration}} (VLSI) computer-chip fabrication technology in the 1970s until about 1986, speed-up in computer architecture was driven by doubling computer word size—the amount of information the processor can manipulate per cycle. Increasing the word size reduces the number of instructions the processor must execute to perform an operation on variables whose sizes are greater than {{the length of the}} word. For example, where an 8-bit processor must <b>add</b> <b>two</b> 16-bit integers, the processor must first add the 8 lower-order bits from each integer using the standard addition instruction, then add the 8 higher-order bits using an add-with-carry instruction and the carry bit from the lower order addition; thus, an 8-bit processor requires two instructions to complete a single operation, where a 16-bit processor would be able to complete the operation with a single instruction.|$|E
5|$|In August 2017, NYC Ferry filed {{plans to}} build four ferry docks: one in Soundview, one in Yorkville, one near Stuyvesant Cove, {{and one on the}} Lower East Side. It also sought to <b>add</b> <b>two</b> more piers to its home port at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The Soundview route was revised so that it would stop at East 34th Street instead of at East 62nd Street, which would no longer be built. That month, Brooklyn {{politicians}} called for docks to be built in Coney Island and Canarsie, owing to the new system's popularity. The Astoria route was projected to carry 1,800 daily passengers upon opening, by which point the service had seen 1.4 million riders. Due to even more ridership demand, three extra ferries were ordered in September 2017, by which time over 2 million people had ridden the ferry.|$|E
5|$|The European Cup was {{retained}} in 1980, this time against Kevin Keegan's Hamburger SV at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium. Clough and Taylor then {{began the process}} of breaking up the championship winning team, selling off Martin O'Neill, Ian Bowyer, Garry Birtles, and Larry Lloyd; as a new team was built based around youngsters such as Gary Mills, Stuart Gray, Colin Walsh, and Bryn Gunn. New signings included striker Ian Wallace and Switzerland international Raimondo Ponte. Taylor retired in May 1982 after Forest finished 12th in the league, with recent signings Justin Fashanu and Raimondo Ponte proving to be unsuccessful. Clough would stay at Forest for another 11 seasons, but without Taylor would only <b>add</b> <b>two</b> League Cups and two Full Members Cups to the club's trophy cabinet, and would struggle against alcoholism.|$|E

5|$|Two years later, {{construction}} {{began on}} two auxiliary lanes on I-805 southbound from SR54 to Bonita Road, to improve traffic flow at the SR54 interchange. In 2010, Caltrans proposed adding high-occupancy toll express lanes between SR15 and East Palomar Street in Chula Vista. The California Transportation Commission (CTC) awarded $100million {{for the work}} in June 2011, which would be split into two phases at the interchange with SR54. Work is also underway to <b>add</b> <b>two</b> HOV lanes between SR52 and Mira Mesa Boulevard; this project also received $59.5million from the CTC in September 2011. Meanwhile, SANDAG made arrangements to purchase the SR125 toll road and reduce the tolls, which was hoped to encourage commuters to take that road instead of I-805 and reduce congestion; this would then enable Caltrans to construct two managed lanes instead of the original four.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, the NHL {{announced}} plans to <b>add</b> <b>two</b> expansion teams, including one in Kansas City, Missouri. Edwin G. Thompson led the group that purchased ownership of the team, which was nicknamed the Scouts in reference to Cyrus E. Dallin's statue {{of the same name}} which stands in that city's Penn Valley Park In the team's inaugural season, 1974–75, the Scouts were forced to wait until the ninth game to play in Kansas City's Kemper Arena, and did not post a win until beating the Washington Capitals, their expansion brethren, in their tenth contest. With 41 points in their inaugural season, the Scouts finished last in the Smythe Division; only the Capitals had fewer points in the NHL. Kansas City fell to 36 points the following season, and had a 27-game win-less streak, three short of the NHL record, which was set when the 1980-81 Winnipeg Jets went 30 games without a win. The Scouts had difficulty drawing fans to home games, and National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA) leader Alan Eagleson publicly expressed concerns about whether Scouts players would be paid.|$|E
5|$|The New York Mets {{concluded}} {{the regular season}} {{with a record of}} 100–60 while the Dodgers had a 94–67 record. The Mets had won ten of the eleven head-to-head regular season contests and were the favorite in the series. On October 4, 1988, Hershiser posted eight scoreless innings in Game 1 of the 1988 NL Championship Series (bringing his unofficial total of consecutive scoreless innings to 67) before surrendering runs in the 9th inning. In both the third and sixth inning the Mets got two runners on base only to have the third out recorded on infield grounders to Hershiser. In the ninth inning, Gregg Jefferies led off with a single on a sinker down the middle and reached second base on a ground out in a hit and run play with Keith Hernandez. Jefferies, a rookie, recorded his third hit in four at bats in his first ever appearance against Hershiser. With Jefferies on second, Darryl Strawberry posted an RBI double on a pitch he described as up in the strike zone. Strawberry had fouled off four fastballs before getting what Lasorda called a hanging curveball. After Hershiser gave up a run in the ninth inning 100 pitches into his performance, pitching coach Perranoski removed him from the game by signaling for a double switch before getting to the mound to talk to Hershiser. The Dodgers' bullpen had led the league in saves that year. Howell had recorded 18 consecutive scoreless innings in relief. Howell's scoreless streak was longer in calendar days, his last runs allowed occurring on August 11. It had been 35 days since anyone had scored a run against Hershiser. Controversially, Mets pitcher David Cone attributed Hershiser's success to luck after the Mets rallied to score against him in the ninth inning. The Mets went on to <b>add</b> <b>two</b> more runs on Gary Carter's shallow fly ball that center fielder John Shelby could not secure until it first hit the ground. The ball bounced out of his glove as he lunged for the catch, yielding the tying and winning runs. Despite the results, Hershiser's scoreless inning streak in the regular season was still intact at 59 consecutive innings, as the runs scored against him on October 4 were in the postseason.|$|E
