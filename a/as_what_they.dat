They {{had decided to}} release the game <b>as</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> deemed to be an ethically non-coercive free-to-play game, with a free base game and in-app purchases for the extended content. Not as many players paid for the content as expected. This was due, in part, to the players' difficulty in finding the purchase function. The game had been downloaded 200,000 times in its August 2012 launch week and was briefly ranked {{near the top of}} an iTunes top downloads ranking, though it did not break the top 200 grossing chart.|$|E

According to The Wrap's Umberto Gonzalez, Fox wants to relaunch the film <b>as</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> did with Planet of the Apes and {{the details of the}} film are that New York City won’t be a maximum security prison, Snake's real name and a new villain. In March 2017 it was announced that Robert Rodriguez will direct the remake with John Carpenter producing.|$|E

25|$|Sinha and Richards both {{argue that}} the south only used states' rights when they {{disagreed}} with a policy. Examples given are a states' right to engage in slavery or to suppress freedom of speech. They argue that it was instead {{the result of the}} increasing cognitive dissonance in the minds of Northerners and (some) Southern non-slaveowners between the ideals that the United States was founded upon and identified itself as standing for, as expressed in the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution of the United States, and the Bill of Rights, and the reality that the slave-power represented, <b>as</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> describe as an anti-democratic, counter-republican, oligarchic, despotic, authoritarian, if not totalitarian, movement for ownership of human beings as the personal chattels of the slaver. As this cognitive dissonance increased, the people of the Northern states, and the Northern states themselves, became increasingly inclined to resist the encroachments of the slave power upon their states' rights and encroachments of the slave power by and upon the federal government of the United States. The slave power, having failed to maintain its dominance of the federal government through democratic means, sought other means of maintaining its dominance of the federal government, by means of military aggression, by right of force and coercion, and thus, the Civil War occurred.|$|E

500|$|The Guardian praised Duff's {{decision}} {{to opt for}} a more electronic dance sound {{as opposed to the}} teen pop of her previous work, despite the questionable marketability. They argued that some of the album's strongest tracks rivaled some by Kylie Minogue. [...] Sputnikmusic's review noted various flaws of the album, such <b>as</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> felt were a lackluster guitar solo on the song [...] "I Wish" [...] and Duff's childish, uncharacterized vocals throughout. However, they continued, [...] "For all its inadequacies, Dignity is a solid, constructed pop album. Like all albums of the genre not written solely by the performer, it's never quite clear which parts, if any, are Duff's words and which represent the feelings of the under-appreciated co-writer, but in Dignity we at least have an album where it's worthwhile listening to the lyrics." [...] They praised the songwriting of every track except [...] "Play with Fire", which they felt was a poor choice for a lead single.|$|E
500|$|The {{authenticity}} of Dunne's use of dialect was controversial {{even in his}} own lifetime. [...] Dunne's partisans claimed that it was genuine Roscommon dialect, phonetically transcribed. But Dunne never called it such, making it clear in the columns that Mr. Dooley had been in America for many years, and so his dialect would have been modified by decades of exposure to an Archey Road wherein was known every way of speaking heard from Armagh to Bantry Bay, and more besides. Dunne was not always consistent in his usages, and spells Dooley's favorite subject, [...] "polytics", [...] "polliticks", [...] "pollytics" [...] and correctly. According to Ellis, while Dunne was no philologist, {{he had a good}} ear, and the biographer considered the Dooley pieces the outstanding use of Irish-American dialect in written form. Paul Green, though, in his introduction to the 1988 edition of Mr. Dooley in Peace and in War, averred that scholars in Ireland have stated that Dunne did not capture the dialect, and have written that the Dooley pieces were not popular there. According to Dunne's son Philip, except in a few of the early pieces, Dooley [...] "spoke always as an American, dealing with American and world issues. Eliminate the brogue and the pieces stand out <b>as</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were: pure Americana." ...|$|E

2500|$|More Beats of Loose Change {{featured}} {{music from}} Loose Change: The Final Cut {{and was a}} rare album release that featured new music with a primary focus on a hip-hop score. There were also full submitted rock and rap tracks. This was another [...] "gapless album" [...] and was also noted as More Beats of Loose Change: The Loose Change 3rd Edition Soundtrack.

2500|$|The Oregon Marching Band {{shares the}} same rights of their {{athletics}} programs in what they wear, giving them access to Nike-designed uniforms. For the 2008-09 season the OMB received a new style of uniforms to replace the older set of uniforms that were used from 2003 through the 2007 season, which included green wool jackets and bib pants that blended into Autzen Stadium's turf and dark green motorcycle helmets, which some fans likened to those worn by Nazi storm troopers during World War II. Those uniforms were a gift in 2003 from University of Oregon alumni and cofounder of Nike Phil Knight. The new band uniforms were designed {{in partnership with the}} school's new football and cheerleading uniforms in an effort to give Oregon football game day a brand as well <b>as</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> feel is a unique style. The end result put an emphasis on the marching band being [...] "athletic". While the 2003 uniforms met with mixed reactions, including the ire of alumni and donors, the new 2008 uniforms were immediately welcomed.|$|E
2500|$|In his {{unpublished}} autobiography, I Always Had Shoes (portions {{of which}} were later incorporated by Jack's daughter, Joan Benny, into her memoir of her parents, Sunday Nights at Seven), Benny said that he, not NBC, {{made the decision to}} end his TV series in 1965. He said that while the ratings were still very good (he cited a figure of some 18 million viewers per week, although he qualified that figure by saying he never believed the ratings services were doing anything more than guessing, no matter what they promised), advertisers were complaining that commercial time on his show was costing nearly twice as much <b>as</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> paid for most other shows, and he had grown tired of what was called the [...] "rate race". Thus, after some three decades on radio and television in a weekly program, Jack Benny went out on top. In fairness, Benny himself shared Fred Allen's ambivalence about television, though not quite to Allen's extent. [...] "By my second year in television, I saw that the camera was a man-eating monster... It gave a performer close-up exposure that, week after week, threatened his existence as an interesting entertainer." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{organized}} tribes, {{which developed}} from kinship and geographic communities, establish their own requirements for membership, as well <b>as</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> consider its obligations. Generally, members must pay dues; attend tribal meetings (which are usually monthly in the [...] "home" [...] areas); volunteer {{to serve as}} a tribal officer when asked; help to put on tribal events; belong to the tribal church (if one exists and they are able); teach their children their people's history and pass on traditional crafts; volunteer to represent the tribe at the Virginia Council on Indians, the United Indians of Virginia, or at other tribes' powwows; speak at engagements for civic or school groups; and live in a good way, so as to best represent their tribe and Native Americans in general. Most Indian tribes maintain some traditions from before the time of European settlement, and are keen to pass these on to their children. Although Indians are also highly involved in non-native culture and employment, they regularly engage in activities for their individual tribes, including wearing regalia and attending powwows, heritage festivals, and tribal homecomings. Individuals try to maintain a balance between elements of their traditional culture and participating in the majority culture.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, {{a journal}} article {{published}} in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) reported a gender bias among science faculty. [...] Faculty were asked to review a resume from a hypothetical student and report how likely they would be to hire or mentor that student, as well <b>as</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> would offer as starting salary. [...] Two resumes were distributed randomly to the faculty, only differing in the names {{at the top of}} the resume (John or Jennifer). [...] The male student was rated as significantly more competent, more likely to be hired, and more likely to be mentored. [...] The median starting salary offered to the male student was greater than $3,000 over the starting salary offered to the female student. [...] Both male and female faculty exhibited this gender bias. [...] This study suggests bias may partly explain the persistent deficit in the number of women at the highest levels of scientific fields. [...] Another study reported that men are favored in some domains, such as biology tenure rates, but that the majority of domains were gender-fair; the authors interpreted this to suggest that the under-representation of women in the professorial ranks was not solely caused by sexist hiring, promotion, and remuneration. In April 2015 Williams and Ceci published a set of five national experiments showing that hypothetical female applicants were favored by faculty for assistant professorships over identically-qualified men by a ratio of 2 to 1.|$|E

40|$|Theories of {{organisation}} {{actually become}} ideologies, legitimisations for {{certain forms of}} organisation. They deploy arguments in terms of rationality and efficiency to provide control. The limits that they impose upon the conception of organisations actually close down the possibility of considering alternative forms of organisation. This is nowhere more clearly evident than in the current application of management theories to schools. Such theories marginalise empirical studies of school practice and dismiss the 'folk-knowledge' of teachers as irrelevant.
