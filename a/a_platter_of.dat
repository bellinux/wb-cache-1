500|$|Banksy's {{second trip}} to the South Bronx was on 21 October and {{resulted}} in a piece depicting a child spray-painting the words [...] "Ghetto 4 Life" [...] on a wall, while a butler waited on him with <b>a</b> <b>platter</b> <b>of</b> spray paints. The work immediately drew a crowd from fans, despite angering many residents, who found the message offensive.|$|E
6000|$|... "So I expected," [...] {{returned}} the little woman, with a laugh, as she placed <b>a</b> <b>platter</b> <b>of</b> broiled meat before her guest, who at once set to work.|$|E
60|$|The man nearest him had {{suddenly}} fallen with a crash, lying quite still {{with his face}} in <b>a</b> <b>platter</b> <b>of</b> the sagamite which had been brought out by the women. Du Lhut glanced at him and then looked round.|$|E

6000|$|... "Canvasback duck?" [...] she asked, and at {{that moment}} the servant set before the anxious {{inquirer}} <b>a</b> <b>platter</b> <b>of</b> these renowned birds, which you know something of already from the report our emissaries have given of their cult among the Americans.|$|E
60|$|On {{the table}} {{in the center of the}} room stood <b>a</b> <b>platter</b> <b>of</b> chicken {{sandwiches}} and also several bottles containing beer and wine, and a box of cigars. Evidently all of the crowd had been eating and drinking, and now several were filling the apartment with tobacco smoke.|$|E
60|$|At a sign {{they struck}} up a {{religious}} chant {{and began to walk}} forward through the passage that led from the first court to the second. Arriving in front of the altar they halted and one by one, first a priest and then a priestess, set down the platters of offerings, piling them above each other into a cone. Next the priests and the priestesses ranged themselves in lines {{on either side of the}} altar, and Harût took <b>a</b> <b>platter</b> <b>of</b> corn and <b>a</b> <b>platter</b> <b>of</b> flowers in his hands. These he held first towards that quarter of the sky in which swam the invisible new moon, secondly towards the rising sun, and thirdly towards the doors of the sanctuary, making genuflexions and uttering some chanted prayer, the words of which we could not hear.|$|E
50|$|It {{is quite}} well noted that her soul mate is Mexican food, though {{she would never}} turn down <b>a</b> Costco <b>platter</b> <b>of</b> {{cocktail}} shrimp or pile of bacon.|$|R

6000|$|... "I was Dr. Waugh-hoo, {{the celebrated}} Indian {{medicine}} man. I carried only one best bet just then, {{and that was}} Resurrection Bitters. It was made of life-giving plants and herbs accidentally discovered by Ta-qua-la, the beautiful wife of {{the chief of the}} Choctaw Nation, while gathering truck to garnish <b>a</b> <b>platter</b> <b>of</b> boiled dog for the annual corn dance.|$|E
60|$|Muf. To your occupation, dog; bind up the jessamines in yonder arbour, {{and handle}} your pruning-knife with dexterity: tightly I say, go tightly to your business; you have cost me much, and must earn {{it in your}} work. Here's {{plentiful}} provision for you, rascal; salading in the garden, and water in the tank, and on holidays the licking of <b>a</b> <b>platter</b> <b>of</b> rice, when you deserve it.|$|E
60|$|So saying, he {{crept into}} the pantry and looked about him {{to see if he}} could find {{something}} to appease his hunger. He saw a great venison pasty and two roasted capons, beside which was <b>a</b> <b>platter</b> <b>of</b> plover's eggs; moreover, there was a flask of sack and one of canary--a sweet sight to a hungry man. These he took down from the shelves and placed upon a sideboard, and prepared to make himself merry.|$|E

50|$|Inside the house, {{a number}} of odd items are to be seen: {{something}} resembling a mummified baby, a bird torn to pieces, a pail <b>of</b> blood, and <b>a</b> <b>platter</b> full <b>of</b> charred bones. Holmes later links these to voodoo, providing an important clue.|$|R
60|$|But {{there is}} no need, if we would be candid, to debate the {{principle}} in these violences of operation, {{any more than the}} proper methods of distributing food, on the supposition that the difference between a Paris dinner and <b>a</b> <b>platter</b> <b>of</b> Scotch porridge must imply that one-half of mankind are to die of eating, and the rest of having nothing to eat. I will therefore take for example a case in which the discrimination is less conclusive.|$|E
60|$|It was {{morning when}} he woke and, for a short time, {{he was unable to}} imagine where he was, but soon {{recalled}} what had happened. He had been visited by someone after he had lain down, for <b>a</b> <b>platter</b> <b>of</b> bread and meat stood on the table, and a jug of water. He was also covered with two thick blankets. These had not been there when he lay down, for he had wondered vaguely as to how he should pass the night without some covering.|$|E
60|$|The {{party had}} taken their places around <b>a</b> <b>platter</b> <b>of</b> venison steaks, which served for the common use, and the {{discourse}} naturally partook of the characters of the different individuals which composed it. The Indians were silent and industrious the appetite of the aboriginal American for venison being seemingly inappeasable, while the two white men were communicative, each of the latter being garrulous and opinionated in his way. But, as the dialogue will put the reader in possession of certain facts that may render the succeeding narrative more clear, it will be well to record it.|$|E
50|$|Amba {{is popular}} in the Arabian Peninsula. Sold in sealed jars or by kilo. Eaten with bread as part <b>of</b> nawashef (<b>a</b> mixed <b>platter</b> <b>of</b> small plates {{containing}} different types of cheese, egg dishes, pickles, ful mudammas, falafel, mutabbag and offal) type meals at breakfast or dinner.|$|R
60|$|Several other chiefs {{addressed}} the assembly, and then dinner, if we may so call it, was served. In Charley's {{case it was}} breakfast; to the Indians it was breakfast, dinner, and supper in one. It consisted <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large <b>platter</b> <b>of</b> dried meat, reindeer tongues (considered a great delicacy), and marrowbones.|$|R
60|$|The supper was now {{steaming}} {{upon the}} table. <b>A</b> great <b>platter</b> <b>of</b> chicken tamales had been prepared, as none but the Doña Maria {{knew how to}} prepare them. The fragrant coffee, the dainty biscuit and the rich preserves and cream, tempted us delightfully with the unconventional perfection of Spanish hospitality.|$|R
6000|$|The supper {{was very}} plain: a cold turkey, which the host carved, or a haunch of venison, or some braces of grouse, or <b>a</b> <b>platter</b> <b>of</b> quails, {{with a deep}} bowl of salad, and the {{sympathetic}} companionship of those elect vintages which Longfellow loved, and which he chose with the inspiration of affection. We usually began with oysters, and when some one who was expected did not come promptly, Longfellow invited us to raid his plate, as a just punishment of his delay. One evening Lowell remarked, with the cayenne poised above his bluepoints, [...] "It's astonishing how fond these fellows are of pepper." ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{found that}} Uncle Jesse's [...] "cup of tea" [...] meant a veritable spread. He had aired the little dining room, {{set out the}} table daintily with Aunt Elizabeth's china and linen--"knowed jest where to put my hands on 'em--often and often helped old Miss Kennedy wash 'em. We were cronies, her and me. I miss her terrible"--and adorned it with mayflowers which, as we {{afterwards}} discovered, he had tramped several miles to gather. There was good bread and butter, [...] "store" [...] biscuits, a dish of tea fit for the gods on high Olympus, and <b>a</b> <b>platter</b> <b>of</b> the most delicious sea trout, done to a turn.|$|E
60|$|We had {{opportunities}} {{on other}} days {{and in other}} places to test the pompano. Notably, at an editorial dinner {{at one of the}} clubs in the city. He was in his last possible perfection there, and justified his fame. In his suite was a tall pyramid of scarlet cray-fish--large ones; as large as one's thumb--delicate, palatable, appetizing. Also deviled whitebait; also shrimps of choice quality; and <b>a</b> <b>platter</b> <b>of</b> small soft-shell crabs of a most superior breed. The other dishes were what one might get at Delmonico's, or Buckingham Palace; those I have spoken of can be had in similar perfection in New Orleans only, I suppose.|$|E
5000|$|In 1567, Wat Scott {{contracted}} to marry Mary Scott, daughter of John Scott of Dryhope, and {{known as the}} [...] "Flower of Yarrow". When supplies were low she allegedly presented a set <b>of</b> spurs on <b>a</b> <b>platter</b> instead <b>of</b> meat, implying that the Scotts should ride out and replenish them from their neighbours' herds.|$|R
50|$|Service: Boiled eggs may {{be served}} loose, in an eggcup, in an {{indentation}} in a plate (particularly <b>a</b> presentation <b>platter</b> <b>of</b> deviled eggs), {{cut with a}} knife widthwise, cut lengthwise, cut with a knife or tapped open with a spoon at either end, or peeled (and optionally sliced, particularly if hard-boiled, either manually or with an egg slicer).|$|R
6000|$|That noon, up {{in their}} cabin, Shorty placed on the table a pot of beans, a pot of coffee, a pan of sourdough biscuits, a tin of butter and a tin of {{condensed}} cream, <b>a</b> smoking <b>platter</b> <b>of</b> moose-meat and bacon, a plate of stewed dried peaches, and called: [...] "Grub's ready. Take a slant at Sally first." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{punishment}} of their comrade excited neither anger nor resentment {{among the other}} boys, who yelled with delight at his discomfiture, but it made them more careful in approaching the cage, and though they continued to poke the prisoners with sticks they did not venture again to thrust a hand through the bars. At sunset the guards again came round, lifted the cage and carried it into a shed. <b>A</b> <b>platter</b> <b>of</b> dirty rice and a jug of water were put into the cage; {{two of the men}} lighted their long pipes and sat down on guard beside it, and, the doors being closed, the captives were left in peace.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{lives and}} is {{as well as}} a man may be after a three days' fast in a black dungeon that is {{somewhat}} damp. Here's a writing on the matter for the captain of this company," [...] and, taking a letter from the folds of the white flag in which it had been fastened, he handed it to Bolle, who, as he could not read, passed it on to Jacob Smith. Just then a lad brought the ale for which Jeffrey had asked, and with it <b>a</b> <b>platter</b> <b>of</b> cold meat and bread, on which he fell like a famished hound, drinking in great gulps and devouring the food almost without chewing it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, then," [...] he {{said aloud}} to the Gunga, [...] "tongues chatter best when they have {{something}} good to say. I'll take <b>a</b> <b>platter</b> <b>of</b> soup with you, Friend of Fishes. And better still, I'll dry my magic coat." [...] He slipped out of his dripping jacket, and spread it {{out in front of}} the fire, and there he sat, slim and silky, in his little cotton-leaf breeches, scratching Puss's head and pretending himself at home. But the old Fish-catcher's bloodshot eyes were watching--watching all the time. He was thinking what snug and beautiful breeches that sheep's-coat would make him this icy weather. But he thought, too, it would be best to speak civilly and smoothly to his visitor--at least, for the present. Not even a Gunga-mulgar cares to quarrel with peaceful Tishnar.|$|E
5000|$|A direct-to-DVD {{documentary}} film, The Story of Furious Pete, chronicling Czerwinski's life, screened at the Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival. The Furious [...] "Pete" [...] - {{which consists}} of 20 pieces of bacon and 20 pieces of cheese, alongside <b>a</b> five-pound <b>platter</b> <b>of</b> fries - is named after him, after Czerwinski became {{the first person in}} 1,500 attempts to finish it.|$|R
