5|$|Endpoints {{are grouped}} into {{interfaces}} and each interface {{is associated with}} a single device function. An exception to this is endpoint zero, which is used for device configuration and is not <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> interface. A single device function composed of independently controlled interfaces is called a composite device. A composite device only has a single device address because the host only assigns a device address to a function.|$|E
5|$|Metformin is {{contraindicated}} {{in people}} with any condition that could {{increase the risk of}} lactic acidosis, including kidney disorders (arbitrarily defined as creatinine levels over 150 μmol/l (1.7mg/dl),), lung disease and liver disease. According to the prescribing information, heart failure (in particular, unstable or acute congestive heart failure) increases the risk of lactic acidosis with metformin. A 2007 systematic review of controlled trials, however, suggested metformin is the only antidiabetic drug not <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> measurable harm {{in people with}} heart failure, and it may reduce mortality in comparison with other antidiabetic agents.|$|E

The fifth painting of the scroll corresponds to a scene described in the second text section of the Hinohara scroll, where Murasaki Shikibu is looking back to her first time at court. The painting shows Murasaki Shikibu inside a room with closed tsumado (hinged plank door) and shitomido (latticed shutters). Next to her is an old-fashioned interior light-fixture consisting of a wooden pole with an oil-filled dish and wick {{on top of it}} (tōdai).|$|E
5|$|A {{dust devil}} (also {{known as a}} whirlwind) resembles a tornado {{in that it is}} a {{vertical}} swirling column of air. However, they form under clear skies and are no stronger than the weakest tornadoes. They form when a strong convective updraft is formed near the ground on a hot day. If there is enough low level wind shear, the column of hot, rising air can develop a small cyclonic motion that can be seen near the ground. They are not considered tornadoes because they form during fair weather and are not <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> clouds. However, they can, on occasion, result in major damage.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, {{paleontologist}} Phil Currie reported skin impressions {{from the}} holotype specimen of G. libratus. He originally reported the skin as being essentially smooth and lacking the scales {{found in other}} dinosaurs, similar to the secondarily featherless skin found in large modern birds. Scales of some sort were present in this specimen, but they are reportedly widely dispersed {{from each other and}} very small. Other patches of isolated Gorgosaurus skin shows denser, and larger though still relatively fine scales (smaller than hadrosaurid scales and approximately as fine as a Gila monster's). Neither of these specimens was <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> particular bone or specific body area. In the Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs Kenneth Carpenter pointed out that traces of skin impressions from the tail of Gorgosaurus showed similar small rounded or hexagonal scales.|$|E

5|$|Dense gases such as xenon and {{sulfur hexafluoride}} can be breathed safely when mixed {{with at least}} 20% oxygen. Xenon at 80% {{concentration}} along with 20% oxygen rapidly produces the unconsciousness of general anesthesia (and {{has been used for}} this, as discussed above). Breathing mixes gases of different densities very effectively and rapidly so that heavier gases are purged along with the oxygen, and do not accumulate {{at the bottom of the}} lungs. There is, however, a danger <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> heavy gas in large quantities: it may sit invisibly in a container, and a person who enters an area filled with an odorless, colorless gas, may be asphyxiated without warning. Xenon is rarely used in large enough quantities for this to be a concern, though the potential for danger exists any time a tank or container of xenon is kept in an unventilated space.|$|E
5|$|Remains of Deinonychus, {{a closely}} related dromaeosaurid, have {{commonly}} {{been found in}} aggregations of several individuals. Deinonychus has also been found in association with a large herbivore, Tenontosaurus, which {{has been seen as}} evidence of cooperative hunting. The only solid evidence for social behavior among dromaeosaurids comes from a Chinese trackway of fossil footprints, which shows six individuals of a large species moving as a group, though no evidence of cooperative hunting was found. Although many isolated fossils of Velociraptor have been found in Mongolia, none were closely <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> other individuals. Therefore, while Velociraptor is commonly depicted as a pack hunter, as in Jurassic Park, there is only limited fossil evidence to support this theory for dromaeosaurids in general, and none specific to Velociraptor itself. The pack hunting theory was based on a discovery of several specimens of Deinonychus found around the remains of a Tenontosaurus. No other group of dromaeosaurids has been found in close association.|$|E
