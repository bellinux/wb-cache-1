5|$|Brood War {{introduces}} seven new units. Each race {{is given}} <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> unique ground unit: the Zerg {{can create a}} defensive unit that can attack from the concealment of its burrow, while the Terrans can train combat medics. The Protoss are able to produce dark templar units, a powerful cloaked melee unit only given to the player in special missions of StarCraft. Protoss players can merge two of these units to create a special spellcaster unit. Each race is also given <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> dedicated air-to-air attack unit.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{reported}} by WASHWatch {{that the total}} number of people in South Sudan lacking <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> [...] "Improved" [...] Water Supply in 2015 was 5,015,000. [...] It is estimated that 58.726% of the population of Southern Sudan has <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> improved water source, such as a hand pump, a protected well or - for a small minority - piped water supply. Even those with <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> improved water source often do not receive safe water. Also, they do not receive water throughout the year, because piped water supply is intermittent or wells run dry. Those without <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> improved water source fetch water from rivers, ponds or open wells. This is often done by children and women. Some also buy water from vendors who use donkeys, bicycles or trucks to get water to their customers.|$|R
25|$|In earlier years, <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> {{improved}} {{water source}} was 89% and <b>access</b> <b>to</b> improved sanitation was 55% in 2008. Having <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> improved water source, however, {{is not the}} same as having <b>access</b> <b>to</b> safe water. Many of those who have <b>access</b> <b>to</b> adequate infrastructure suffer from poor water quality due to fecal contamination; high levels of naturally occurring fluoride, arsenic, or salts; and growing industrial and agricultural chemical pollution. Furthermore, seasonal water shortages occur.|$|R
5|$|Although Poore's Brickworks {{was well}} established, Jones {{believed}} there was potential profit in the Duke of Buckingham's capitalising on his <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> railway line by becoming directly involved in brickmaking. Trials with Brill clay in 1883 proved positive, and in April 1885 Jones sought estimates for machinery and labour necessary to produce 10million bricks a year. It was decided that 5million bricks per year was a realistic figure, with bricks to be manufactured in kilns between Brill and Wood Siding stations and shipped down the Tramway to the national network. Progress was slow and obstructed by the local authority.|$|E
5|$|As the DVD {{featurette}} Within a Minute illustrates, {{the film}} required 910 artists and 70,441 man-hours to create 49 seconds of footage for the Mustafar duel alone.

Benefits included not only special articles, but they also received <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> webcam that transmitted a new image every 20 seconds during {{the time it was}} operating in Fox Studios Australia. Many times the stars, and Lucas himself, were spotted on the webcam.|$|E
5|$|As {{the two are}} {{otherwise}} unattested outside of Snorri's Prose Edda, suggestions have been made that Hjúki and Bil may have been of minor mythic significance, or that they were made up outright by Snorri, while Anne Holtsmark (1945) posits that Snorri may have known or had <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> now lost verse source wherein Hjúki and Bil personified the waxing and waning moon. Holtsmark further theorizes that Bil {{may have been a}} dís (a type of female deity).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} how <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> {{insurance}} market should influence {{investments in safety}} measures {{in accordance with the}} ruling paradigm for decision-making under uncertainty—the expected utility theory. We show that <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> insurance market in most situations will influence investments in safety measures. For an expected utility maximizer, an overinvestment in safety measures is likely if <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> insurance market is ignored, while an underinvestment in safety measures is likely if insurance is purchased without paying attention to the possibility for reducing the probability and/or consequences of an accidental event by safety measures...|$|R
5000|$|According to {{calculations}} {{based on}} data from the 2002 census, <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> improved source of water supply was 80% in urban areas and 67% in rural areas, including in the definition of improved source house connections, yard connections, public standposts, protected wells and protected springs.

5|$|Both {{farmers and}} {{scientists}} must continually {{draw on the}} irreplaceable resource of genetic diversity to ensure productive harvests. While genetic variability provides farmers with plants that have a higher resilience to pests and diseases and allows scientists <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> more diverse genome than {{can be found in}} highly selected crops. The breeding of monocultural crops steadily reduces genetic diversity as desirable traits are selected, and undesirable traits are removed. Farmers can increase within-crop diversity to some extent by planting mixtures of crop varieties; they can further increase in-field diversity by polycultural practices such as intercropping and companion planting.|$|E

5|$|Cells cannot {{function}} if DNA damage corrupts {{the integrity}} and accessibility of essential information in the genome (but cells remain superficially functional when non-essential genes are missing or damaged). Depending {{on the type of}} damage inflicted on the DNA's double helical structure, a variety of repair strategies have evolved to restore lost information. If possible, cells use the unmodified complementary strand of the DNA or the sister chromatid as a template to recover the original information. Without <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> template, cells use an error-prone recovery mechanism known as translesion synthesis as a last resort.|$|E
5|$|Central to the {{structure}} and plot {{of the show is}} the use of electronic surveillance and wiretap technologies by the police—hence the title The Wire. Salon.com described the title {{as a metaphor for the}} viewer's experience: the wiretaps provide the police with <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> secret world, just as the show does for the viewer. Simon has discussed the use of camera shots of surveillance equipment, or shots that appear to be taken from the equipment itself, to emphasize the volume of surveillance in modern life and the characters' need to sift through this information.|$|E
5|$|Further {{marketing}} of Sleeping Dogs was via cross-promotion on different platforms; players {{who bought the}} game through Steam received an eight item pack for Team Fortress 2, which was later made available for separate purchase, and a Hong Kong-themed Team Fortress 2 level, Kong King. Owners of Just Cause 2 on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, or PC received automatic <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Sleeping Dogs character outfit {{in the style of}} Just Cause 2 protagonist Rico Rodriguez.
