He is shown whining after the mention of Superboy, who is suspected of being dead. Krypto assists Superman and Supergirl in fighting various groups of Warworld challengers, as a delaying tactic to save Earth from destruction. Thanks to the secretive efforts of Steel and Batgirl, no innocents are hurt.|$|E
25|$|Who {{has held}} the waters in hand, {{measured}} the heavens, comprehended the earth, and weighed mountains in the balance? Who has counseled or instructed God? Nations are like a drop in a bucket, like dust in the balance, as nothing before God. Can one compare God to anything, to an idol that a woodworker carved? God sits <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth,</b> and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers. God brings princes to nothing, makes the judges of the earth like nothing; scarcely are they planted, but God blows upon them, and they wither and blow away.|$|E

25|$|Philip Johnson's {{design is}} a cenotaph, or empty tomb, that symbolizes {{the freedom of}} Kennedy’s spirit. The {{memorial}} is a square, roofless room, 30 feet (9m) high and 50 (15m) by 50 feet (15m) wide with two narrow openings facing north and south. The walls consist of 72 white precast concrete columns, most of which seem to float with no visible support two feet <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth.</b> Eight columns extend to the ground, acting as legs that seem {{to hold up the}} monument. Each column ends in a light fixture. At night, the lights create the illusion that the structure is supported by the light itself. The corners and “doors” of this roofless room are decorated with rows of concrete circles, or medallions, each identical and perfectly aligned. These decorations introduce the circular shape into the square architecture of the Kennedy Memorial.|$|E

The fourth song, [...] "Pilots", which describes travelers floating in the atmosphere <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth,</b> was inspired by John Barry's James Bond theme songs. In the United Kingdom, a remixed version of the song was released as a single, reaching number 68 on the UK Singles Chart.|$|E
500|$|A {{flurry of}} {{spectacular}} fireworks accompanied by Pink Floyd's song [...] "Eclipse" [...] {{was supported by}} images of memorable Olympic victories shown on the big screens, with the stadium pixels showing Jesse Owens running.

[...] A stationary basketball hoop was almost part of the sculpture too. The sculpture, which is hollow, was designed to withstand the natural elements. After his second retirement following the 1997–98 NBA season, the following quote from the 1992 film A River Runs Through It was added to the base: [...] "At that moment I knew, surely and clearly, that I was witnessing perfection.

500|$|To {{break the}} {{deadlock}} over verification, Macmillan proposed a compromise in February 1959 whereby {{each of the}} original parties {{would be subject to}} a set number of on-site inspections each year. In May 1959, Khrushchev and Eisenhower agreed to explore Macmillan's quota proposal, though Eisenhower made further test-ban negotiations conditional on the Soviet Union dropping its Control Commission veto demand and participating in technical discussions on identification of high-altitude nuclear explosions. Khrushchev agreed to the latter and was noncommittal on the former. A working group in Geneva would eventually devise a costly system of 5–6 satellites orbiting at least [...] <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth,</b> though it could not say with certainty that such a system would be able to determine the origin of a high-altitude test. US negotiators also questioned whether high-altitude tests could evade detection via radiation shielding. Concerning Macmillan's compromise, the Soviet Union privately suggested it would accept a quota of three inspections per year. The US argued that the quota should be set according to scientific necessity (i.e., be set according to the frequency of seismic events).|$|E
