5|$|The Lambda Literary Awards include {{awards for}} science fiction, fantasy and horror. The awards were first {{presented}} in 1989, with separate categories for speculative fiction for lesbians <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> <b>men.</b> In 1993 these categories were merged and the combined award has undergone several name changes since then. Although the awards are given {{based on the}} quality of the writing and the LGBT themes, the author's sexual orientation is also a factor.|$|E
5|$|AIDS {{was first}} {{clinically}} observed in 1981 in the United States. The initial cases were {{a cluster of}} injection drug users <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> with no known cause of impaired immunity who showed symptoms of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), a rare opportunistic infection that was known to occur in people with very compromised immune systems. Soon thereafter, additional gay men developed a previously rare skin cancer called Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Many more cases of PCP and KS emerged, alerting U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a CDC task force was formed to monitor the outbreak. The earliest retrospectively described case of AIDS {{is believed to have}} been in Norway beginning in 1966.|$|E
5|$|Milk's {{continuing}} campaign, {{run from}} the storefront of Castro Camera, was a study in disorganization. Although the older Irish grandmothers <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> who volunteered were plentiful and happy to send out mass mailings, Milk's notes and volunteer lists were kept on scrap papers. Any time the campaign required funds, the money came from the cash register without any consideration for accounting. The campaign manager's assistant was an 11-year-old neighborhood girl. Milk himself was hyperactive and prone to fantastic outbursts of temper, only to recover quickly and shout excitedly about something else. Many of his rants were directed at his lover, Scott Smith, who was becoming disillusioned {{with the man who}} was no longer the laid-back hippie he had fallen in love with.|$|E

5|$|Not all Heathens {{practice}} seiðr; {{given its}} associations {{with both the}} ambiguity of sexuality and gender and the gods Odin and Loki in their unreliable trickster forms, many on the Heathen movement's right wing disapprove of it. Although there are heterosexual male practitioners, seiðr is largely associated with women <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> <b>men.</b> One member of the Troth, Edred Thorsson, developed forms of seiðr which involved sex magic utilizing sado-masochistic techniques, something which generated controversy in the community. Part of the discomfort that some Heathens feel toward seiðr surrounds {{the lack of any}} criteria by which the community can determine whether the seiðr-worker has genuinely received divine communication, and the fear that it will be used by some practitioners merely to bolster their own prestige.|$|E

Some effeminate <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> in The Butch Factor felt uncomfortable about their femininity (despite being comfortable with their sexuality), <b>and</b> feminine <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> may be derided by stereotypically-masculine gays.|$|R

However, as previously noted, within-sex analyses reveal that heterosexual men tend to rate emotional infidelity as more distressing than sexual infidelity (Vitelli, 2014).|$|E

500|$|For some women, the {{realization}} that they participated in behavior or relationships that could be categorized as lesbian caused them to deny or conceal it, such as professor Jeannette Augustus Marks at Mount Holyoke College, who lived with the college president, Mary Woolley, for 36 years.
