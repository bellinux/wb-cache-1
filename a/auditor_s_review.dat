The client risk was determined by management integrity valuation and client 2 ̆ 7 s business risk, meanwhile, the audit risk was determined {{by the nature of the}} audit engagement, related parties transactions, client 2 ̆ 7 s prior knowledge and ex­ periences, and also from the deep understanding of auditors in regards to the error andfraud which is possible performed by the client. Furthermore, <b>auditor</b> <b>s</b> business risk was determined by considering whether the client s profiles is a public company, regulated industry or high profile company. In order to enhance this research, this paper also discusses how the auditfee and the role of specialist will impact to client s acceptance decision. In conducting the model testing, this research was performed through a field of empirical testing in one of the accounting firm (archival data) ...|$|R
40|$|El objetivo de este trabajo es poner de manifiesto los indicios con los que disponen los usuarios para poder percibir si un auditor es independiente o no. Hay que destacar que la independencia real del auditor es in observable, ya que se trata de un estado de la mente difícil de percibir por el usuario. Por ello, con estos indicios, emitidos fundamentalmente desde el entorno en que los auditores desarrollan su profesión, los usuarios podrán percibir la independencia aparente del auditor. Los resultados del análisis de estas percepciones tiene especial {{relevancia}} de cara a garantizar un adecuado sistema de retroalimentación de las normas relativas a la independencia de los auditores. The aim of {{this study}} is put forward the signs which users can take into account in order to perceive whether an auditor is independent or not. Firstly, we would like to emphasise {{that it is impossible to}} measure <b>auditor</b> <b>s</b> real independence since it refers to the state of mind that is difficult to perceive by the users. For this reason, users can use the sings mentioned above, which come from the environment where auditors develop theirs work, with the purpose of perceiving <b>auditor</b> <b>s</b> apparent independence. The results obtained with the analysis of the perceptions have especial relevance because it would be more than a little useful in addressing any future reforms of auditing standards concerning auditor’s independence...|$|R

An auditor {{provides}} {{audit opinion}} about whether firm s financial statements have been adequately presented {{according to the}} Generally Accepted Accounting Principle (GAAP) through auditing. In this sense, an <b>auditor</b> <b>s</b> audit quality is an immediate factor that determines the reliability of a financial statement. Audit quality {{is the level of}} quality of auditing, and generally is defined by the joint probability of an <b>auditor</b> <b>s</b> expertise and independence. Here, an <b>auditor</b> <b>s</b> expertise refers to the probability of finding fraud and error in a financial statement, and independence refers to the probability of reporting the found fraud and error. Therefore, it means higher the audit quality, the higher the expertise and independence, and ultimately leading to an improved reliability of accounting information. If capital market participants are aware of such differences in audit quality, they will assess the reliability of accounting information that has been audited by an auditor with high audit quality to be more reliable and the accounting information will be served as more useful information when assessing the value of the firm. In this context, this study analyzed the impact on the value relevance of financial statements caused by differences in audit quality. Specifically, the study observed whether the value relevance of representative accounting information, earnings and its components cash flow and accrual, is changed according to audit quality. For this purpose, the study used the firm value estimated by market value, Tobin s Q, dividend discount model and residual income valuation model. In addition, the hypothesis was tested by using size of auditors, audit fee, audit time and auditor industry specialization as the proxies for audit quality. If capital market participants are assumed to perceive the reliability of accounting information to improve with higher audit quality, it is expected that interacting variables of earnings / audit quality, cash flow / audit quality, and accruals / audit quality will show significant positive coefficients. The contributions of the study are as follows. First, it will provide an additional perspective on audit quality as the study analyzed the influence of audit quality on accounting information s value relevance. Second, the study s another significance is that the influence of audit quality on accounting information s value relevance has been comprehensively considered by using a variety of substitute variables concerning firm value and audit quality...|$|R
