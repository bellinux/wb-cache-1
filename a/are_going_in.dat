In the case of migratory movement, most members of a shoal seem to know where they <b>are</b> <b>going.</b> <b>In</b> the case of foraging behaviour, captive shoals of golden shiner (a kind of minnow) are led by a small number of experienced individuals who knew when and where food was available.|$|E
25|$|In part writing, {{the usage}} of Conjunct Melodic Motion is important, in which the parts {{generally}} move in stepwise motion, and in counterpoint, {{if there is a}} leap (a jump of a fourth or above), the part will progress the opposite direction it just leapt in stepwise motion. Parts also must progress together in contrary motion, meaning the parts <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>in</b> different directions. This is preferable to parallel motion, where the parts move together, or oblique motion, where one part doesn’t move and another does. Parallel motion can be used, {{but it is important to}} pay attention to intervals in order to avoid breaking counterpoint rules. Dissonant intervals, both melodic and harmonic intervals are not preferable in most cases. This includes augmented or diminished intervals, tritones, and seventh chords, simply because they sound very jarring in a piece that is meant to sound pleasant to the ear. Parallel intervals, which occur when two parts move the same distance creating the same interval twice in a row, are also important to be aware of. However, this is only a problem when the intervals are either a perfect fifth or a perfect octave. These also can sound uncomfortable to the ear as they tend to have an open or hollow sound.|$|E

My energies <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>in</b> different directions—over the last few years I've made a number of political speeches at various locations and ceremonies... I'm using a lot of energy more specifically about political states of affairs, which I think are very, very worrying as things stand." [...] Some of this later poetry included [...] "The 'Special Relationship'", [...] "Laughter", and [...] "The Watcher".|$|E

On signing, Smith said [...] "It {{was time for a}} change after not getting as much football as I would have liked. I'm still young, Mansfield <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>in</b> the right direction and I'm excited about the new season". He made his debut in the opening match of 2010–11, a 3–1 victory over Forest Green, and was substituted in the 80th minute. Smith scored his first goal for Mansfield in a 4–0 victory over Altrincham on 30 August. A red card in the 61st minute of a 1–0 defeat at Gateshead on 2 October for a high challenge resulted in a three match suspension. He finished the season with 38 appearances and six goals.|$|E

2500|$|The co-president of The Greens–European Free Alliance {{group in}} the European {{parliament}} Rebecca Harms (Germany) announced that she will insist {{on the order of}} the European Union on conducting an inspection of documents relating the [...] "gas affair" [...] against Tymoshenko. She believes that the allegations are absurd and baseless. She reported that she recently familiarized herself with the results of investigation of the former Prosecutor General of Denmark, which indicate that Tymoshenko was not supposed to be convicted in this case. In her opinion the Ukrainian authorities and the President of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, have realized already that they <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>in</b> the wrong direction and that is why other criminal cases were opened against Tymoshenko.|$|E
2500|$|Mozart himself, {{during his}} short stay in Dresden, {{was an almost}} daily visitor to the Körners' house. For the charming and witty Doris he was all aflame and with his south German vivacity he paid her the naïvest compliments. He {{generally}} came shortly before dinner and, after he had poured out a stream of gallant phrases, he sat down to improvise at the pianoforte. In the next room the table was meanwhile being set and the soup dished up, and the servant announced that dinner was served. But who could tear himself away when Mozart was improvising! The soup was allowed to grow cold and the roast to burn, simply {{so that we could}} continue to listen to the magic sound which the master, completely absorbed in what he was doing and unaware {{of the rest of the}} world, conjured from the instrument. Yet one finally grows tired even of the highest pleasures when the stomach makes known its demands. After the soup had grown cold a few times while Mozart played, he was briefly taken to task. [...] "Mozart", said Doris, gently laying her snow-white arm on his shoulder, [...] "Mozart, we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>in</b> to dine; do you want to eat with us?" [...] But it was precisely Mozart who never did come; he played on undisturbed. Thus we often had the rarest Mozartian musical accompaniment to our meal, Doris concluded her narrative, and when we rose from table we found him still sitting at the keyboard.|$|E
