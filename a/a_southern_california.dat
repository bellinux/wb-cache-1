500|$|Ocean's songwriting uses {{descriptive}} narratives, dense metre, surrealistic imagery, empathic sentiments, deadpan humor, overt metaphors, and conversational devices.

Embling of Tiny Mix Tapes regarded Channel Orange as a [...] "songwriter's album" [...] and views that, although [...] "the emotions, mood, and melodies are broad enough to draw listeners in", Ocean's lyrics are [...] "apocryphal, allowing for personal interpretations". Ocean's narratives generally depict dark, broken characters, and <b>a</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>California</b> setting, with references to its sunny, coastal environment in both the lyrics and melodies. Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times categorized Channel Orange as a concept album about [...] "the twentysomething experience in Los Angeles", while Greg Kot interpreted the California setting to be [...] "a state of mind in Ocean world: numb, deceptively luxurious and self-satisfied, where the denizens live disconnected from one another and the world." ...|$|E

The climate is Mediterranean, with hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Almost all the precipitation occurs between October and April; the average rainfall is , although mountain areas often receive higher amounts. San Juan Creek receives extra runoff from agriculture, urban areas, and other human sources, resulting in unnatural dry season flows that carry trash, heavy metals, oils, pesticides and fertilizer into the creek.

500|$|The {{town meeting}} {{attracted}} a packed crowd of over a thousand, with Nixon supporters distributing anti-Voorhis literature at the door. The Senate proxies spoke first for their candidates, followed by Voorhis. Nixon, who had notified organizers {{that he would}} be late due to another commitment, arrived during Voorhis's speech, and remained backstage until the congressman had completed his talk. He then came onstage, shook hands with Voorhis, and delivered a fifteen-minute address. A question-and-answer period then followed, with a Nixon supporter asking Voorhis about his onetime Socialist registration, and about his views on monetary policy. [...] After the representative responded, a Voorhis supporter asked Nixon why he was making [...] "false charges" [...] about the supposed Voorhis CIO-PAC endorsement. [...] In response, Nixon reached into his pocket and pulled out a copy of <b>a</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>California</b> NCPAC bulletin mentioning the group's endorsement of Voorhis. [...] The congressman was unaware of the endorsement; those of his aides in the know had [...] "completely forgotten" [...] to tell him. [...] Nixon walked halfway across the stage and displayed it to Voorhis, asking him to read it for himself. Voorhis came from his seat and took it, and (according to Bullock, who served as timekeeper at the debate) [...] "mumbled" [...] that this seemed to be a different organization from the CIO-PAC. [...] Nixon reclaimed the document, and began to read out names {{of the members of the}} boards of directors of the two groups, [...] "It's the same thing, virtually, when they have the same directors." [...] The crowd began to cheer Nixon, who later wrote, [...] "I could tell by the audience reaction that I had made my point", and to jeer Voorhis, who wrote, [...] "They'd boo and laugh at my remarks, and this disturbed me." ...|$|E
