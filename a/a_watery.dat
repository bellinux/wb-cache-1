5|$|Misthallery is <b>a</b> <b>watery</b> town {{in which}} {{traveling}} via gondola {{to move about}} the town's canals is commonplace. By these canals, the town is divided into five distinct regions: the Crossroads, the Market, the East District, Ely Street, and Highyard Hill. The Crossroads contain the library {{as well as the}} home of the mayor, Clark Triton. The town market is a shady place controlled by a mysterious entity known as the Black Raven, the East District contains an abandoned warehouse, and Ely Street as well as Highyard Hill are primarily residential areas. On the outskirts of Highyard Hill lies the manor owned by the former mayor's children, who live away {{from the rest of the}} village. The townspeople believe that the manor is home to a witch. The town is also rumored to contain the Golden Garden, hidden ruins of an ancient city.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of the cavity can be understood intuitively {{as one of the}} channel's mechanisms for overcoming the dielectric barrier, or repulsion by the low-dielectric membrane, by keeping the K+ ion in <b>a</b> <b>watery,</b> high-dielectric environment.|$|E
25|$|Steam {{distillation}} {{of various}} aromatic herbs and flowers {{can result in}} two products; an essential oil as well as <b>a</b> <b>watery</b> herbal distillate. The essential oils are often used in perfumery and aromatherapy while the watery distillates have many applications in aromatherapy, food processing and skin care.|$|E

50|$|G. cibarioides is {{a bright}} yellow-orange {{mushroom}} that somewhat resembles the Fragrant Chanterelle (Cantharellus odoratus), but has <b>a</b> very <b>watery</b> stipe. It is edible.|$|R
25|$|Unprocessed milk {{consists}} of globules of milk fat suspended in <b>a</b> <b>watery</b> base containing dissolved proteins, sugars, vitamins, and minerals. If the globules are large enough, as with unprocessed milk from cows, the fat globules float upwards until {{they form a}} distinct cream layer at the top. Some animals, such as goats, produce smaller fat globules that remain mixed unless mechanically separated by centrifugation.|$|E
25|$|Glass is {{characterized}} by a high degree of corrosion-resistance. Because of its high water-resistance it is often used as primary packaging material in the pharma industry since most medicines are preserved in <b>a</b> <b>watery</b> solution. Besides its water-resistance, glass is also very robust when being exposed to chemically aggressive liquids or gases. While other materials like metal or plastics quickly reach their limits, special glass-types can easily hold up.|$|E
25|$|Modern terra sigillata is made {{by adding}} a {{deflocculant}} such as sodium silicate to <b>a</b> <b>watery</b> clay/water slip mixture and then allowing the clay particles to separate into layers by weight. For undisturbed deflocculated slip settling in a transparent container, these layers are usually visible within 24 hours. Siphoning off the topmost layers of slip, which contain the smallest and lightest clay particles, produces terra sigillata. The remaining heavier settled layers of deflocculated clay slip are discarded.|$|E

25|$|In Aztec folklore, the ahuizotl was a dog-like water monster {{with a hand}} on the end of its coiled tail. It {{was said}} to dwell {{underwater}} near river banks and would drag the unwary to <b>a</b> <b>watery</b> death. The victim's soul would be carried off to Tlalocan, one of the three Aztec paradises. A similar belief existed among the neighbouring Purépechas, their dog-god was called Uitzimengari and he saved the souls of drowned people by carrying them across to the Land of the Dead.|$|E
25|$|Once the cholera {{bacteria}} {{reach the}} intestinal wall {{they no longer}} need the flagella to move. The bacteria stop producing the protein flagellin to conserve energy and nutrients by changing the mix of proteins which they express {{in response to the}} changed chemical surroundings. On reaching the intestinal wall, V. cholerae start producing the toxic proteins that give the infected person <b>a</b> <b>watery</b> diarrhea. This carries the multiplying new generations of V. cholerae bacteria out into the drinking water of the next host if proper sanitation measures are not in place.|$|E
25|$|The cochlea {{is filled}} with <b>a</b> <b>watery</b> liquid, the perilymph, which moves in {{response}} to the vibrations coming from the middle ear via the oval window. As the fluid moves, the cochlear partition (basilar membrane and organ of Corti) moves; thousands of hair cells sense the motion via their stereocilia, and convert that motion to electrical signals that are communicated via neurotransmitters to many thousands of nerve cells. These primary auditory neurons transform the signals into electrochemical impulses known as action potentials, which travel along the auditory nerve to structures in the brainstem for further processing.|$|E
25|$|The corn steep liquor, <b>a</b> {{plentiful}} <b>watery</b> {{byproduct of}} maize wet milling process, {{is widely used}} in the biochemical industry and research as a culture medium to grow many kinds of microorganisms.|$|R

25|$|The main {{structures}} of the bird eye {{are similar to those}} of other vertebrates. The outer layer of the eye consists of the transparent cornea at the front, and two layers of sclera — a tough white collagen fibre layer which surrounds the rest of the eye and supports and protects the eye as a whole. The eye is divided internally by the lens into two main segments: the anterior segment and the posterior segment. The anterior chamber is filled with <b>a</b> <b>watery</b> fluid called the aqueous humour, and the posterior chamber contains the vitreous humour, a clear jelly-like substance.|$|E
25|$|A popular food in Darjeeling is the momo, a steamed {{dumpling}} containing either mutton, pork, beef {{or vegetables}} cooked in a doughy wrapping served with <b>a</b> <b>watery</b> vegetable soup and spicy tomato sauce/chutney. Wai-Wai is a favourite packaged snack of Darjeeling hills comprising noodles which are eaten either dry or with soup. Churpee, {{a kind of}} hard cheese made from cow or yak's milk, is another popular mini-snack that is both nutritious and a pastime. A form of noodle called thukpa, served with soup and vegetables, is extremely popular {{in and around the}} hills of Darjeeling. Chhang and tongba are local alcoholic beverages made from millet.|$|E
25|$|Predators of Glomeris marginata are {{reported}} to include the starling, the common toad, the woodlouse spider, and hedgehogs. As well as rolling up into a ball for protection, G. marginata produces noxious chemicals to ward off potential predators, as many millipedes do. One to eight drops of a viscid fluid are secreted, containing quinazolinone alkaloids, dissolved in <b>a</b> <b>watery</b> protein matrix. These chemicals act as antifeedants and toxins to spiders, insects and vertebrates, and the fluid is sticky enough to entrap the legs of ants. Having completely discharged these chemical defences, it {{can take up to}} four months for the millipede to replenish their supplies.|$|E
50|$|As the {{infection}} continues, {{thousands and thousands}} of intestinal cells may become infected. As they break open, they produce <b>a</b> bloody, <b>watery</b> diarrhea. This can cause dehydration, and can lead to death in young or small pets.|$|R

25|$|This lengthy-titled artwork {{features}} a large Tiger Shark suspended in formaldehyde, {{the most well-known}} of his series ‘Natural History’. This series is said to “contain some of the artist’s most widely recognized and important works”. The tank in which the shark is floating creates the illusion of the animal being cut into three pieces due to the container looking like three separate blocks. The work itself is very simplistic, featuring only the shark in <b>a</b> <b>watery</b> substance, which at first glance looks clear like glass. The piece itself is fairly old, having been created in 1991. Because of this, the formaldehyde preserving the shark has slowly eaten away at the animal’s body, showing signs of decay.|$|E
25|$|Saliva is <b>a</b> <b>watery</b> {{substance}} {{formed in}} the mouths of animals, secreted by the salivary glands. Human saliva comprises 99.5% water, plus electrolytes, mucus, white blood cells, epithelial cells (from which DNA can be extracted]]), glycoproteins, enzymes (such as amylase and lipase), antimicrobial agents such as secretory IgA and lysozyme. The enzymes found in saliva are essential in beginning the process of digestion of dietary starches and fats. These enzymes {{also play a role}} in breaking down food particles entrapped within dental crevices, thus protecting teeth from bacterial decay. Furthermore, saliva serves a lubricative function, wetting food and permitting the initiation of swallowing, and protecting the mucosal surfaces of the oral cavity from desiccation.|$|E
25|$|A major {{difference}} between the Buccleuch and Lansdowne Madonnas is in their background landscapes. Whereas {{the background of the}} Buccleuch version is <b>a</b> <b>watery</b> landscape indifferently painted, that of the Lansdowne Madonna has a dramatic mountain range far more typical of Leonardo. It has been proposed that this is a specific location in the valley of the river Adda, as it runs from Lecco to Vaprio, an area familiar to Leonardo and which he mapped. It is possible that the landscape of the former picture was added by a pupil after Leonardo failed to complete the work. For Martin Kemp the “late” character of the landscape in the Lansdowne Madonna suggests that it was the later painting to be completed and that the Buccleuch Madonna was the one sent to Robertet in 1507.|$|E

25|$|In his {{influential}} Principles of Philosophy of 1644, René Descartes applied his mechanical physical laws {{to envisage}} swirling particles forming the Earth as a layered sphere. This natural philosophy was recast in Biblical terms by the theologian Thomas Burnet, whose Sacred Theory of the Earth {{published in the}} 1680s proposed complex explanations based on natural laws, and explicitly rejected the simpler approach of invoking miracles as incompatible with the methodology of natural philosophy (the precursor to science). Burnett maintained that less than 6,000 years ago the Earth had emerged from chaos as a perfect sphere, with paradise on land over <b>a</b> <b>watery</b> abyss. This crust had dried out and cracked, and its collapse caused the Biblical Deluge, forming mountains as well as underground caverns where the water retreated. He {{made no mention of}} fossils, but inspired other diluvial theories that did.|$|E
25|$|Natives of Buka and Bougainville at the {{northern}} Solomon Islands in Melanesia and the Chopi people of Mozambique in the southeast coast of Africa have darker skin than other surrounding populations. (The native people of Bougainville, Papua New Guinea, {{have some of the}} darkest skin pigmentation in the world.) Although these people are widely separated they share similar physical environments. In both regions, they experience very high UVR exposure from cloudless skies near the equator which is reflected from water or sand. Water reflects, depending on colour, about 10 to 30% of UVR, that falls on it. People in these populations spend long hours fishing on the sea. Because it is impractical to wear extensive clothing in <b>a</b> <b>watery</b> environment culture and technology does little to buffer UVR exposure. The skin takes a very large amount of UVR radiation. These populations are probably near or at the maximum darkness that human skin can achieve.|$|E
25|$|In Tamil Nadu, a plain rice porridge, or {{the thick}} {{supernatant}} water from overcooked rice, {{is known as}} kanji. Kanji or Congee is also prepared with different grains available {{in different parts of}} Tamil Nadu, for example minor millet or pearl millet, finger millet, broken wheat, maize.The people of Kerala also call this preparation of rice in <b>a</b> <b>watery</b> state kanji, and it is eaten as a porridge with green lentils or chutney. Kanji is prepared with rice or ragi. Nuts and spices are added to the kanji depending on the economic status or health requirements. Rice kanji is prepared by boiling rice in large amounts of water. To this preparation, either milk and sugar (usually jaggery) or curd (yoghurt) and salt are added. Ragi kanji is prepared by drying ragi sprouts in shade, and then grinding them into a smooth powder. This powder is added to water and cooked. Milk and brown sugar are added to this cooked preparation for taste. Ragi kanji can be given to infants after six months. Another kanji preparation uses jevvarisi (sago in English, sabudana in Hindi) in kanji. Sago is dry roasted and powdered with/ without sugar. Powdered sago is boiled in water until cooked. This is eaten by all ages from adults to infants as young as three months.|$|E
