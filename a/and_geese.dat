5|$|Habitats {{within the}} SSSI include reed beds, salt marshes, {{freshwater}} lagoons and sand or shingle beaches. The wetlands {{are important for}} wildlife, including some scarce breeding birds such as pied avocets, western marsh harriers, Eurasian bitterns and bearded reedlings. The location also attracts migrating birds including vagrant rarities. Ducks <b>and</b> <b>geese</b> winter along this coast in considerable numbers, and several nature reserves provide suitable conditions for water voles, natterjack toads and several scarce plants and invertebrates.|$|E
5|$|Mallards {{are also}} preyed upon by other {{waterside}} apex predators, {{such as the}} grey heron, European herring gull, the wels catfish, and the northern pike. Crows (Corvus) are also known to kill ducklings and adults on occasion. Also, mallards may be attacked by larger anseriformes such as swans (Cygnus) <b>and</b> <b>geese</b> during the breeding season, and are frequently driven off by these birds over territorial disputes. Mute swans (C. olor) {{have been known to}} attack or even kill mallards if they feel that the ducks pose a threat to their offspring.|$|E
5|$|The swans, ducks <b>and</b> <b>geese</b> are {{medium to}} large birds that are adapted to an aquatic {{existence}} with webbed feet and bills which are flattened {{to a greater}} or lesser extent. In many ducks the male is colourful while the female is dull brown. The diet consists of a variety of animals and plants. The family is well represented in the counties, especially in winter when large numbers visit from further north.|$|E

5|$|Swans <b>and</b> <b>geese</b> usually {{start to}} arrive in late October. Passage waders in the autumn include red knot, godwit, dunlin, ringed and grey plovers, ruff, common greenshank, spotted redshank, curlew sandpiper and common, wood and green sandpipers. Besides Bewick's swan and flocks of white-fronted geese, large {{waterfowl}} regularly present in the reserve in winter include the Brant goose, pink-footed goose, barnacle goose and Taiga bean goose. The swans tend to fly off {{in the day and}} return to feed in the late afternoon, and another spectacular sight at the end of winter afternoons is the arrival of large flocks of starlings. Smaller wildfowl present in winter include wigeon, Eurasian teal, common pochard, northern pintail, water rail, dunlin, redshank, curlew, golden plover, snipe and ruff.|$|E
5|$|The god of Death, Yama, employs Yama-dutas (messengers of Yama) or Yama-purushas, {{who bring}} souls of all beings to Yama for judgement. Generally, all living beings, {{including}} humans and animals, go to Yama's abode upon death {{where they are}} judged. However, very virtuous beings are taken directly to Svarga (heaven). People devoted to charity, especially donors of food, and eternal truth speakers are spared the justice of Yama's court. War-heroes who sacrifice their life and people dying in holy places like Kurukshetra are also described as avoiding Yama. Those who get moksha (salvation) also escape from the clutches of yamadutas. Those who are generous and ascetics are given preferential treatment when entering Naraka for judgement. The way is lighted for those who donated lamps, while those who underwent religious fasting are carried by peacocks <b>and</b> <b>geese.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{reserve is}} {{important}} for some scarce breeding birds, such as pied avocets on the islands, and western marsh harriers, Eurasian bitterns and bearded reedlings in the reeds. To encourage bitterns to breed, the reed beds have been improved to make them wetter, and the lagoon has been stocked with the common rudd. Typical wetland birds such as the water rail, reed warbler and sedge warbler also appear, and little egrets are common. The reserve has regularly attracted rarities, as its location {{is important for}} migrating birds. Ducks <b>and</b> <b>geese</b> winter at Titchwell in considerable numbers, and the reserve shelters the endangered European water vole.|$|E

5|$|A {{small number}} of species, such as ducks <b>and</b> <b>geese,</b> lose all of their flight {{feathers}} at once, temporarily becoming flightless. As a general rule, the tail feathers are moulted and replaced starting with the innermost pair. Centripetal moults of tail feathers are however seen in the Phasianidae. The centrifugal moult is modified in the tail feathers of woodpeckers and treecreepers, in that it begins with the second innermost pair of feathers and finishes with the central pair of feathers so that the bird maintains a functional climbing tail. The general pattern seen in passerines is that the primaries are replaced outward, secondaries inward, and the tail from centre outward. Before nesting, the females of most bird species gain a bare brood patch by losing feathers close to the belly. The skin there is well supplied with blood vessels and helps the bird in incubation.|$|E
5|$|Crofting is the {{mainstay}} of island life. Sheep form {{the backbone of the}} agricultural economy but a diversity livestock are kept, including cattle, pigs, goats, chickens, ducks <b>and</b> <b>geese.</b> Vegetable are grown too, often in the shelter of circular walls, such plots being known as 'plantie scrubs'. Fishing is still conducted but on a relatively small scale. There is a post office at the pier, but no shop. Mains electricity only came to the island {{at the close of the}} twentieth century. The Papa Stour Project is a Christian supported housing service offering accommodation to men with drug and alcohol issues. Ferries now sail across the Sound of Papa to West Burrafirth on the Shetland Mainland. The crossing takes 45 minutes, and although the Snolda carries cars, there is only one short road on the island. For visiting yachts the four main voes provide good shelter, but the strong tides in both the Sound of Papa and to the north west require considerable care.|$|E
5|$|The high {{salinity}} {{in parts}} of the lake makes them uninhabitable for all but a few species, including brine shrimp, brine flies, and several forms of algae. The brine flies have an estimated population of over one hundred billion and serve as the main source of food for many of the birds which migrate to the lake. However, the fresh- and salt-water wetlands along the eastern and northern edges of the Great Salt Lake provide critical habitat for millions of migratory shorebirds and waterfowl in western North America. These marshes account for approximately 75% of the wetlands in Utah. Some of the birds that depend on these marshes include: Wilson's phalarope, red-necked phalarope, American avocet, black-necked stilt, marbled godwit, snowy plover, western sandpiper, long-billed dowitcher, tundra swan, American white pelican, white-faced ibis, California gull, eared grebe, peregrine falcon, bald eagle, plus large populations of various ducks <b>and</b> <b>geese.</b>|$|E

5|$|Behind fish, {{the next}} most {{significant}} prey base for bald eagles are other waterbirds. The contribution of such birds to the eagle's diet is variable, depending on the quantity and availability of fish near the water's surface. Waterbirds can seasonally comprise from 7% to 80% of the prey selection for eagles in certain localities. Exceptionally, in the Greater Yellowstone area, birds were eaten as regularly as fish year-around, with both prey groups comprising 43% of the studied dietary intake. Preferred avian prey includes grebes, alcids, ducks, gulls, coots, herons, egrets, <b>and</b> <b>geese.</b> Bird species most preferred as prey by eagles tend to be medium-sized, such as western grebes (Aechmophorus occidentalis), mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and American coots (Fulica americana) as such prey is relatively easy for the much larger eagles to catch and fly with. American herring gull (Larus smithsonianus) are the favored avian prey species for eagles living around Lake Superior. Larger waterbirds are occasionally prey as well, with wintering emperor geese (Chen canagica) and snow geese (C. caerulescens), which gather in large groups, sometimes becoming regular prey. Other large waterbirds hunted at least occasionally by bald eagles have included common loons (Gavis immer), great black-backed gulls (Larus marinus), sandhill cranes (Grus canadensis), great blue herons (Ardea herodias), Canada geese (Branta canadensis), brown pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis), and fledging American white pelicans (P. erythrorhynchos). Colony nesting seabirds, such as alcids, storm petrels, cormorants, northern gannets (Morus bassanus), terns and gulls, may be especially vulnerable to predation. Due to easy accessibility and lack of formidable nest defense by such species, bald eagles are capable of preying on such seabirds at all ages, from eggs to mature adults, and can effectively cull large portions of a colony.|$|E

30|$|The separated-network and shared-network of SMV <b>and</b> <b>GOOSE</b> are {{compared}} {{by means of}} experiment. Experimental conditions: the PCS- 9881 Gigabit switch from NR Electric Co., Ltd is applied. Meanwhile, using the flow classification control technology to reduce unnecessary flow rate, making the flow rate to be control in the post-affordable range. 32 computers are used to simulate the merging units and intelligent terminal units of 32 bays, and 32 computers are used to simulate the protection devices of 32 bays; each merging unit sends 200 Â bytes of SMV message every 250 Â Âµs, each intelligent terminal unit sends 1, 024 bytes of GOOSE message every 1 Â ms, and the network load is proximately 150 Â Mbps. The experiment result shows that, whether in condition of separated-network and shared-network of SMV <b>and</b> <b>GOOSE,</b> the maximum transmission time delay of SMV <b>and</b> <b>GOOSE</b> messages is 10 Â Âµs and no package is lost. Thus, the shared-network of SMV <b>and</b> <b>GOOSE</b> is feasible.|$|R
30|$|In smart substation, {{multicast}} transmission is adopted for SMV <b>and</b> <b>GOOSE</b> messages. Namely, switch will broadcast and transmit SMV <b>and</b> <b>GOOSE</b> messages, <b>and</b> all intelligent devices will receive related messages, {{which will be}} filtered by network card and then be transmitted to application module, thus the network load of SMV <b>and</b> <b>GOOSE</b> will have influences on the intelligent devices in the whole network. In present smart substation, the SMV flow <b>and</b> <b>GOOSE</b> flow of one bay do not exceed 8 Â Mbps and 0.1 Â Mbps respectively. For a substation with 30 bays, the load of process level network in the whole substation wonât exceed 240 Â Mbps. If Gigabit LAN is adopted, the load of process level network wonât exceed 25 %. This flow is relatively small for switch, but not so for intelligent devices like protection devices and BCU, etc., and the load of process level network needs to be reduced by proper means. Process level messages may be isolated in one bay through {{virtual local area network}} (VLAN), static multicast management or GARP multicast registration protocol (GMRP), in order to control the flow of process level data. By proper means, the influences of process level data on intelligent devices may be greatly lowered, and the shared-network of SMV <b>and</b> <b>GOOSE</b> will be possible.|$|R
25|$|The loon, {{the size}} of a large duck or small goose, resembles these birds in shape when swimming. Like ducks <b>and</b> <b>geese</b> but unlike coots (which are Rallidae) and grebes (Podicipedidae), the loon's toes are {{connected}} by webbing. The bird may be confused with cormorants (Phalacrocoracidae), which are not too distant relatives of divers and like them are heavy set birds whose bellies â unlike those of ducks <b>and</b> <b>geese</b> â are submerged when swimming. Flying loons resemble plump geese with seagulls' wings that are relatively small in proportion to the bulky body. The bird points its head slightly upwards during swimming, but less so than cormorants. In flight the head droops more than in similar aquatic birds.|$|E
