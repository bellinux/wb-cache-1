5|$|Iridium was {{discovered}} in 1803 among insoluble impurities in natural platinum. Smithson Tennant, the primary discoverer, named iridium for the Greek goddess Iris, personification of the rainbow, because of the striking and diverse colors of its salts. Iridium {{is one of the}} rarest elements in Earth's crust, with annual production and consumption of only three tonnes. 191Ir and 193Ir <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> naturally occurring isotopes of iridium, as well as the only stable isotopes; the latter is the more abundant of the two.|$|E

5|$|By the end {{of their}} active use in 1902 {{together}} they had fired 1540 rounds in practice, though not all at full power as they are recorded as firing under 300 effective full charges. By then the wheels were significantly rotted and the ammunition limbers had become unserviceable. Less wheels, the guns were removed from the fort in 1909; Adelaide's city council then set them in Brougham Gardens, North Adelaide. Both were returned to the fort in 1976 and remounted on restored carriages of the original design. They <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> guns of their type remaining in Australia. The southern gun (Number 463) fired three blank charges in 1980 to mark the centenary of the first firing at the fort. This same gun is fired regularly by the volunteers of the Fort Glanville Historical Association (FGHA).|$|E
5|$|Detroit has drafted 448 skaters (defensemen and forwards), 167 of {{whom have}} {{appeared}} in the NHL. Peter Mahovlich, Detroit's first pick, was also the first pick by the team to play in the NHL. Mahovlich played in 884 games for the Wings, the Montreal Canadiens, and the Penguins. Nicklas Lidstrom and Steve Yzerman <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> picks to have played in over 1,500 games. Both Lidstrom and Yzerman spent their entire careers in Detroit, had their numbers retired by the team, and were inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. Marcel Dionne scored the most goals and points of any player drafted into the league by Detroit, while Yzerman has the most assists. Dionne and Yzerman are the only players drafted by the Wings to have scored at least 600 goals, 1,000 assists, and/or 1700 points. Bob Probert accumulated the most penalty minutes, with 3,300.|$|E

5|$|Gorgosaurus is {{classified}} in the theropod subfamily Albertosaurinae within the family Tyrannosauridae. It is most {{closely related to the}} slightly younger Albertosaurus. These <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> definite albertosaurine genera that have been described, although other undescribed species may exist. Appalachiosaurus was described as a basal tyrannosauroid just outside Tyrannosauridae, although American paleontologist Thomas Holtz published a phylogenetic analysis in 2004 which indicated it was an albertosaurine. More recent, unpublished work by Holtz agrees with the original assessment. All other tyrannosaurid genera, including Daspletosaurus, Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, are {{classified in the}} subfamily Tyrannosaurinae. Compared to the tyrannosaurines, albertosaurines had slender builds, with proportionately smaller, lower skulls and longer bones of the lower leg (tibia) and feet (metatarsals and phalanges).|$|E
5|$|In the 2014–15 season, the Carolina Panthers won the NFC South with a 7–8–1 record. By week 16, no team in that {{division}} {{could finish}} {{with more than}} seven wins. The Panthers then defeated the Atlanta Falcons, who were 6–9 and undefeated within the division entering the game, for the division title. They hosted and defeated the 11–5 Arizona Cardinals in the wild card round. The best team to miss the playoffs that year was the Philadelphia Eagles, who finished 10–6. To date, the 2014 Panthers and 2010 Seahawks <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> teams to win a division, and a playoff game, with a losing record.|$|E
5|$|Italian ornithologist Tommaso Salvadori {{defined the}} new genus Neophema in 1891, placing the {{turquoise}} parrot within it {{and giving it}} its current scientific name. There is little geographical variation, with some minor local differences {{in the amount of}} orange on the belly. In 1915, Gregory Mathews described a subspecies dombrainii from Victoria on the basis of more prominent red on the scapulars; however, this distinction was not confirmed on review with New South Wales specimens, and hence no subspecies are recognised. One of six species of grass parrot in the genus Neophema, it is most closely related to the scarlet-chested parrot. The two are an allopatric species pair, and <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> species in the genus to exhibit marked sexual dimorphism—where the male and female are different in appearance.|$|E

5|$|Koufax was {{the first}} pitcher to win {{multiple}} Cy Young Awards, {{as well as the}} first pitcher to win a Cy Young Award by a unanimous vote. He is also the only pitcher to win three Cy Young Awards in the era in which the award was presented to one pitcher across the board, rather than one in each major league, and one of three Dodgers pitchers to win the one-across-the-board Cy Young Award. (The others were Don Newcombe, the first Cy Young winner in 1956, and Don Drysdale in 1962.) Each of Koufax's three Cy Young Awards were by unanimous vote. Koufax and Juan Marichal <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> pitchers in the post-war era (1946-date) to have more than one 25-win season, with each pitcher recording three.|$|E
5|$|Nick Offerman as Ron Swanson, {{the cynical}} {{director}} of the parks department and Leslie's boss. Due to his incredibly negative view of government, he regularly works to make his department as inefficient as possible. This leads him to butt heads with Leslie {{on a number of}} occasions, as her philosophy regarding government is the polar opposite. Despite that, both he and Leslie have a large amount of respect for one another. Ron has been married twice; both of his ex-wives are named Tammy. He despises and fears them greatly, as they <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> women in the world that can control him.|$|E
5|$|Since 1957, {{there have}} been five Gold Glove batteries. The pitcher and catcher, collectively known as the battery, <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> players on the field {{involved}} in every pitch. In particular, the pitcher and catcher control the running game with tools such as pickoffs or {{the strength of the}} catcher's throwing arm. The first pitcher and catcher on the same team to win Gold Gloves in the same year were Jim Kaat and Earl Battey, with the Minnesota Twins in 1962. Only two pairs of batterymates have won Gold Gloves together more than once: Iván Rodríguez and Kenny Rogers won with the Texas Rangers in 2000, and again with the Detroit Tigers in 2004 and 2006. Yadier Molina and Adam Wainwright matched the feat, winning in both 2009 and 2013.|$|E
