And he said, 'I remember the kind of dresses she used to wear. They were old and faded and gray.' And then he walked some more. And he said, 'I remember how she was always bent over the stove, trying to stretch what little we had.' And that was the beginning, that night, of his walk. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> that floor until just about daybreak.|$|E

25|$|In 2013 Franchitti {{improved}} on his 2012 season. At the Indy 500, Franchitti {{was running}} in the top ten for the final restart, but got loose in turn 1 and scraped across the turn 1 wall in a similar style to Takuma Sato's 2012 accident on the final lap. This brought out a final caution that found one of Franchitti's closest friends off the track, Tony Kanaan winning his first Indy 500 and his first win in a few years. After climbing out of his car, Franchitti was led to the infield hospital. Franchitti was cleared uninjured; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> to victory lane to hug Kanaan just before the broadcasting ended.|$|E

25|$|Game two {{was played}} {{two days later}} in Pittsburgh, and a {{highlight}} was Paige's dramatic showdown with Josh Gibson. In {{the bottom of the}} sixth, Paige relieved starter Hilton Smith with the Monarchs ahead 2–0. In the seventh inning, he gave up three singles and faced Gibson with the bases loaded and two outs. Gibson fouled off the first two pitches, then whiffed on the third. When Paige told the story in his autobiography, he mythologized the story. According to Paige, the strikeout came in the ninth inning with a one-run lead, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> the three batters ahead of Gibson in order to face him. The mythical version was retold by Buck Leonard and Buck O'Neil in their memoirs. In the actual game, the Monarchs added three runs {{in the top of the}} eighth to take a 5–0 lead, then Paige gave up four in the bottom of the frame to make it 5–4. The Monarchs added another three in the top of the ninth and won 8–4.|$|E
25|$|Included in that haul {{was one of}} {{the most}} famous caughts-and-bowled ever taken. Ulyett sent down a {{straight}} half-volley to Bonnor, who drove at it with all his considerable might and got it right out of the middle of the bat. The ball flew back towards the bowler with a resounding crack. It seemed to Ulyett barely to have left his hand—yet already it was flying back to him at what seemed like the speed of light. He had no time to judge it but held out the right hand instinctively, and the leather stuck, right in the middle of his palm. With the sound of Bonnor's stroke still echoing about the ground, many eyes in the gallery were looking for the area near the boundary where they thought that the ball would land. The eyes of George Giffen, the non-striker, were among the wanderers, and he was certain that everyone else must be looking for it, too: indeed, a segment of the crowd, in panic, had even opened up a space in the ring in anticipation of the ball’s descent. Giffen reckoned it to have been a very mighty drive indeed—but he could not see where it had gone. When, finally, his and other eyes were diverted back towards the pitch, they noticed Ulyett celebrating and Bonnor was departing. It soon dawned on them that Ulyett had taken the catch. Although Ulyett felt no pain in the centre of his hand, there was definitely a fair amount of it on the outside. Bonnor looked at him disgustedly, thinking it almost immoral to have done such a thing, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> off gloomily. The England players gathered around Ulyett in wonderment. They seemed to the Wisden correspondent to be curious as to what kind of man this was—although they were also keen to congratulate him on his evasion of impending danger. The looks on the faces of Allan Steel and Alfred Lyttelton would stay with Wisdens man for a long time. WG Grace and Lord Harris both told Ulyett that he was foolish to have attempted to take the catch: had it hit his wrist or arm instead, that bone would surely have snapped. Giffen believed that this {{was one of the}} finest catches that he had ever seen, and, although on the team which it had adversely affected, he definitely appreciated it.|$|E

500|$|Coloman's father {{ascended the}} throne in 1074. Because Coloman and Álmos were minors {{when he died}} on 25April 1077, Géza's brother Ladislaus I succeeded him. The new king decided that Coloman should be {{prepared}} {{for a career in}} the Church. The king's decision was unusual as Coloman was older than Álmos and elder brothers were rarely ordained priests. The 14th-century Illuminated Chronicle stated that Coloman was [...] "of mean stature, but astute and quick of apprehension", adding that he was [...] "shaggy and hirsute, half-blind and humpbacked, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> with a limp and stammered in his speech". If the chronicle preserved genuine tradition of his appearance, his physical deformity may have influenced his uncle's decision. However, modern scholars tend to refute this view, emphasizing that the chronicle was completed in the reigns of kings descending from Álmos.|$|E
500|$|The Hebrew Bible {{records that}} Amon {{continued}} his father Manasseh's practice of idolatry {{and set up}} pagan images as his father had done. II Kings states that Amon [...] "did that which was evil {{in the sight of}} Yahweh, as did Manasseh his father. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them." [...] Similarly, II Chronicles records that [...] "…he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, as did Manasseh his father; and Amon sacrificed unto all the graven images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them." [...] The Talmudic tradition recounts that [...] "Amon burnt the Torah, and allowed spider webs to cover the altar ... Amon sinned very much." [...] Like other textual sources, Flavius Josephus too criticizes the reign of Amon, describing his reign similarly to the Bible.|$|E

[...] You eventually did escape, early in the morning of January 14: one news report claimed the improvised lock to his cell door had been picked {{with the aid of a}} confederate. [...] You hid in the environs of South Bend for several days, during which he was hunted by a squad led by sheriff Thomas A. Roney. [...] On January 15 he was sighted by two men; the following day the county commissioners met and agreed to offer a reward of $200 for You's capture. On January 17 You was finally apprehended by a three-man posse. [...] You offered no resistance, and when asked how he escaped, said only that the door was open <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> out.|$|E

500|$|In January 1801, Benedict Arnold's health {{began to}} decline. He had {{suffered}} from gout since 1775, and the condition attacked his unwounded leg {{to the point}} where he was unable to go to sea. The other leg ached constantly, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> only with a cane. His physicians diagnosed him as having dropsy, and a visit to the countryside only temporarily improved his condition. He died after four days of delirium on June 14, 1801, at the age of 60. Legend has it that, when he was on his deathbed, he said, [...] "Let me die in this old uniform in which I fought my battles. May God forgive me for ever having put on another," [...] but this story may be apocryphal. Arnold was buried at St. Mary's Church, Battersea in London, England. As a result of a clerical error in the parish records, his remains were removed to an unmarked mass grave during church renovations a century later. His funeral procession boasted [...] "seven mourning coaches and four state carriages"; the funeral was without military honors.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the second}} to last game of the 1910 season, a {{scoreless}} tie with the University of Pennsylvania, Wells made his second start as an end. [...] It appeared Wells had scored the winning touchdown, but the play was called back. [...] The 1911 Michiganensian described the play this way: [...] "'Shorty' McMillan sent 'Stan' Wells down the side lines. [...] Then the Michigan team opened up and Bill Edmunds was given the ball. [...] Bill stepped back and sent a beautiful long pass to 'Stan' Wells. [...] The pigskin came sailing through the air on a perfect line, Wells grabbed it and ran for a touchdown. [...] Instantly the small Michigan rooting contingent rose as one man and cheered until their voices failed. [...] Then Umpire Crowell asked for the ball. [...] It was handed him, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> {{back to where it}} had been put in play and told the Michiganders to start anew. [...] Wells had stepped out of bounds for an instant, just as he received the ball." ...|$|E

2500|$|Blue Horse {{invariably}} dined with Burbank at {{noon and}} {{always had a}} good appetite. One day, after dinner, Burbank said to Blue Horse: [...] "I notice that you always eat everything in front of you, but you never pass your plate back the second time or ask for another cup of coffee. Why is that? Is it because you cannot eat any more or drink any more coffee. O, yes, he replied, I could eat more, but I thought the twenty-five cents you paid for my dinner was for just what was placed before me. No, I said, the twenty-five cents pays for all you can eat. Hereafter, if one plate is not enough, ask for more, and drink all the coffee you want. All right, he replied, I will. And he did. I also told him to tell his friends this, and suggested that if any white men sitting at his table left anything to eat on their plates before them, {{that it would be}} all right for him to gather it up and take it home for his wife and children. It is needless to say that all the Sioux Indians who patronized that hotel afterward got all that was coming to them.” One time Blue Horse was in the Indian trader's store with his little niece, who saw something on the shelves that she very much wanted. Blue Horse had no money, so he took off his old moccasins and gave them to the Indian trader in exchange for what the little girl craved <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> home barefooted.|$|E
2500|$|The accuser's 14-year-old brother Star {{testified that}} he'd walked into Jackson's bedroom and seen Jackson masturbating {{himself and the}} {{sleeping}} accuser. He testified that he'd meant {{to go to sleep}} in Jackson's room, had found the door [...] "kind of locked, so [...] pushed it, and it opened," [...] <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> some ways into the room and stopped when he saw what Gavin and Michael were doing. He testified they were on the bed [...] "outside of the covers," [...] Jackson was on his back with his eyes closed, and Gavin was [...] "curled up" [...] facing away from Jackson and was [...] "kind of snoring." [...] Star couldn't remember what his brother had been wearing but said it might have been [...] "pants or underwears," [...] and that Jackson was wearing [...] "socks, underwears, and an undershirt," [...] but later said Jackson's [...] "hand was in his pants." [...] He variously used the words [...] "pants" [...] and [...] "underwears" [...] for both Gavin and Jackson to describe what they were wearing. One aspect that weakened his testimony was that Star, the only witness to the alleged molestation, claimed he twice walked in on Jackson molesting Gavin and was completely unnoticed, even while tripping the alarm system in the hallway leading to Jackson's bedroom. An alarm or bell would sound whenever anyone approached, and Star claimed that on both occasions the alarm went off and Jackson didn't hear it. Neither did he hear nor see the boy come and go. Star said he stood watching for about four seconds before he [...] "just went back to the guest units." [...] Star testified that two days later he had an almost identical experience. He allegedly walked into Jackson's bedroom and saw that [...] "the same thing was happening," [...] with Jackson [...] "masturbating, stroking up and down" [...] and his other hand moving around in Star's sleeping [...] "brother's underwears." [...] This time Star only stayed for three seconds before returning to the guest units. Star's account of the sexual act on the second occasion matched neither the description he gave during an interview with psychologist Stanley Katz nor his statement given in police interviews in 2003. Star Arvizo {{said in an interview with}} the psychologist on May 29, 2003, that he witnessed Jackson placing his hand on Gavin's crotch outside his clothes. On July 7, 2003, during his first interview with sheriff's investigators, Star changed his story. He claimed that during the first incident Jackson placed his left hand under the front of his brother's pajama pants. Star Arvizo changed his account still a third time during a police interview on August 13, 2003, when he claimed that Jackson had placed his hand inside the front of his brother's boxer shorts. Dr. Katz' grand jury testimony about what Star had told him included a story about Jackson [...] "rubbing his penis against Gavin's buttocks" [...] and another about smelling marijuana. In court, Star denied that he'd made the allegations and refused Mesereau's offer to [...] "refresh [...] recollection [...] that page of [...] testimony." ...|$|E
