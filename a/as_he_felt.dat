Wandrei's rejected trophy was later recycled and given to another award winner.|$|E
5|$|John Rhys-Davies {{was asked}} to reprise his role as Sallah as a guest in the wedding scene. He turned it down <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> his {{character}} deserved a more substantial role.|$|E
5|$|Maben {{subsequently}} {{did some}} of the editing of the final cut at home, due to financial constraints. He regretted doing this, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> it was important to separate his work and home life, but, at the time, he had no choice.|$|E
6000|$|... "You know," [...] said Harry, [...] "I don't {{care about}} any music much, except"--he was {{thinking}} of the evening hymn--"except of your playing." [...] He turned very red again <b>as</b> <b>he</b> spoke, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> was perjuring himself horribly.|$|R
60|$|Urmston flushed, glad {{he was in}} {{the shadow}} where Carrie could not see him. <b>He</b> <b>felt,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had <b>felt</b> before, that <b>he</b> would rather like to gag Eveline Annersly.|$|R
60|$|Dominey {{pushed his}} chair back from the fire <b>as</b> though <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> the heat. His eyes seemed glued upon the doctor's.|$|R

While the duo {{was surprised and}} somewhat hurt, Hyun-jun was angered the most <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> his heart was toyed with.

Afterward, the two maintained a secret romantic relationship without the knowledge of anyone.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of Uyarndha Manithan, AVM Productions was keen to remake it in Hindi and {{approached}} Dilip Kumar. After watching the film, Kumar was hesitant to play the lead role <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> he would not match Ganesan's performance in the original version. K. Balachander was signed {{up to be the}} director of the remake, which led to Kumar being initially convinced that he could be successful.|$|E
50|$|He bore her off; and <b>as</b> <b>he</b> flew <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> {{the flames}} of love gain force on force; he did not curbe his course across the air until hed reach the north the lands and city of the Cicones.|$|R
6000|$|... "And Striped Chipmunk is a Ground Squirrel," [...] {{interrupted}} Peter, looking <b>as</b> if <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> {{very much}} {{pleased with his}} own smartness.|$|R

5|$|Alexander H. Smith treated Gomphus as {{a section}} within Cantharellus in his 1947 review of chanterelles in western North America, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> {{there were no}} {{consistent}} characteristics that distinguished the two genera. In 1966 E.J.H. Corner described a small-spored variety, G.clavatus var. parvispora, from specimens collected in Uganda; it is not considered to have independent taxonomic significance.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{depicted}} Pavo on his chart, Bayer did not assign its stars Bayer designations. French explorer and astronomer Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille labelled them Alpha to Omega in 1756, but omitted Psi and Xi, and labelled {{two pairs}} of stars close together Mu and Phi Pavonis. In 1879, American astronomer Benjamin Gould designated a star Xi Pavonis <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> its brightness warranted a name, but dropped Chi Pavonis due to its faintness.|$|E
5|$|Benchley {{was forced}} to take a {{publicity}} position with the Liberty Loan program, and he continued to freelance until Collier's contacted him with an associate editor position. Benchley took this offer to Vanity Fair {{to see if they}} would match it, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> Vanity Fair was the better magazine, and Vanity Fair offered him the position of managing editor. He accepted and began work there in 1919.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Grewgious {{shook his}} head seriously, <b>as</b> if <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> the offence {{to be a little}} too much, though of his own committing.|$|R
60|$|Reggie beamed with relief. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> just <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had <b>felt</b> on {{that other}} {{occasion}} {{at the moment}} when a taxi-cab had rolled up and enabled him to hide his spatless leg from the public gaze.|$|R
60|$|Chester nodded. For {{a moment}} <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had <b>felt</b> when <b>he</b> left the {{provision}} store in Montrose. But {{he would not}} let Clemantiny see him cry. Somehow, {{he would not have}} minded Miss Salome.|$|R
5|$|In 1994, Puerto Rican-American {{recording}} artist La India covered the song on her album, Dicen Que Soy which {{was produced by}} Sergio George and released as the album's first single.

5|$|In The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life, Durkheim's first {{purpose was}} to {{identify}} the social origin and function of religion <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that religion {{was a source of}} camaraderie and solidarity. His second {{purpose was to}} identify links between certain religions in different cultures, finding a common denominator. He wanted to understand the empirical, social aspect of religion that is common to all religions and goes beyond the concepts of spirituality and God.|$|E
5|$|Jovanović did not assign titles to his works, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> {{that if a}} {{painting}} was well composed viewers {{would be able to}} deduce the title themselves. Thus, the majority of the artist's works are referred to by a number of different titles. The Wounded Montenegrin also appears under the titles The Wounded Herzegovinian (Ranjeni Hercegovac), The Wounded Bosnian (Ranjeni Bosanac), Sad Encounter (Žalosni susret), Sad Farewell (Žalosni rastanak) and Unsuccessful Banditry (Neuspelo razbojništvo).|$|E

60|$|Gabriel coloured, <b>as</b> if <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> {{had made}} a mistake and, without looking at her, kicked off his goloshes and flicked {{actively}} with his muffler at his patent-leather shoes.|$|R
60|$|This was the Colonel's first really false move, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> himself <b>felt</b> {{before the}} last word had left his lips.|$|R
5|$|Lynch {{has been}} known to allow his {{collaborative}} partners a large degree of control over their roles when working with him; Kyle MacLachlan has several times persuaded Lynch to rewrite scenes, including in 1986's Blue Velvet and the television series Twin Peaks, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> they were not right for his characters. The following lists include all of the cast and crew members with whom Lynch has worked on three or more separate projects.|$|E
5|$|Mustaine {{has made}} {{numerous}} inflammatory {{statements in the}} press, usually regarding issues with former Metallica bandmates. The feud stemmed from his ejection from the band, how it was conducted, and disagreements on songwriting credits. Mustaine expressed his anger in the movie Some Kind of Monster, in a scene he later disapproved of <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> he was mischaracterized, and {{that it did not}} represent the full extent of what happened during the meeting.|$|E
5|$|On November 23, 2004, Downey {{released}} his debut musical album, The Futurist, on Sony Classical, {{for which he}} designed the cover art and designed the track listing label on the CD with his son Indio.

60|$|Mr. Bolter put {{his hand}} to his neckerchief, <b>as</b> if <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> it inconveniently tight; and murmured an assent, {{qualified}} in tone but not in substance.|$|R
6000|$|The chief {{sat down}} with emphasis, <b>as</b> if <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>he</b> had done his duty, and his men uttered a decided [...] "Ho!" [...] of approval.|$|R
60|$|Weston {{laughed in}} a rather curious fashion, and when he spoke it was <b>as</b> if <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that an {{explanation}} of his attitude were due from him.|$|R
5|$|Sukumar's future {{projects}} {{include a}} film with Ram Charan and Devi Sri Prasad each, which marks the latter's on-screen debut as an actor.

5|$|The {{dialogue}} between Sharon and Randy that would provoke significant attention was not scripted until Tuesday morning, less than 48 hours prior to broadcast, {{and was one}} of the last completed parts of the show. Parker likened the scene to an afterthought, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> it was not necessarily central to the episode's story.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} {{has also}} {{been referred to as}} Nevesta ("The Bride"), Kite mladu ("The Bride is Being Decorated") and Oprema mlade ("Bridal Trousseau"). The artist did not assign titles to his works, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that if a painting was well composed viewers would be able to deduce the title themselves. As such, the majority of his paintings are referred to by a number of different titles.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{very sorry}} for you," [...] said Barton, simply. He {{did not know what}} else to say; but <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> more than his {{conventional}} words indicated, and perhaps <b>he</b> looked <b>as</b> if <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> it and more.|$|R
50|$|In {{his diary}} Julius Mayr {{condemned}} Kaiser Wilhelm II and the aristocratic cliques of that era. As early <b>as</b> 1905, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> {{the approach of}} World War I.|$|R
