40|$|The {{codification}} of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in 1938 (the “Federal Rules”) created {{not only}} a more transactional approach to litigation, but also the flexible party structure that was necessary for “public law litigation” to flourish. Indeed, many argue that intervention by non-parties in public law cases is essential {{to ensure that the}} court can hear from and protect the wide range of interests likely to be impacted by its decision. This Article seeks to make a case for limiting intervention as of right in a specific subset of public law proceedings –– those brought to review the legality of informal federal rulemakings pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA” or the “Act”). The courts in these cases are placed in a difficult position in considering <b>applications</b> <b>to</b> <b>intervene.</b> On one hand, given the narrow scope of judicial review it is unclear how a court will benefit from the addition of defendant-intervenors seeking to uphold the administrative rule. Instead the court faces the likelihood of information overload and/or information degradation as defendant-intervenors incorporate duplicative or irrelevant arguments into the proceedings. On the other hand, when a court chooses to deny such intervention, it creates the possibility of a lengthy appeal that will further delay judicial review. In sum, intervention practice under the Federal Rules harms the rights of those entitled to judicial review of an agency rulemaking and, most importantly, negatively impacts the public as a whole by reducing the efficiency of the administrative rulemaking process. As such, this Article argues that the practice is inconsistent with both the APA and the intent of third-party practice under the Federal Rules...|$|R
40|$|Placental {{amino acid}} {{transport}} {{is essential for}} fetal development during pregnancy. Impaired transport {{has been associated with}} restricted fetal growth that can potentially lead to diseases in later life. However, quantitative understanding of placenta transport remains limited and therefore requires investigation. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a computational framework that can represent the amino acid transport system in the placenta as a whole. The transfer of amino acid across the placenta is mediated by a broad array of specific membrane transporters. Mathematical models, based on carrier-mediated transport theory, were developed to mechanistically represent these transporters. These include accumulative transporters, which use secondary active transport driven by the sodium electrochemical potential; exchangers (antiporters), which swap one substrate for another on different sides of the membrane; and facilitative transporters, which transport substrate along its concentration gradient. The transporter models were thoroughly investigated and validated with experimental data with respect to their mechanistic characteristics and parameter sensitivity. Overall, the models were demonstrated to be adequate in representing the specific transporter behaviours. There are 20 amino acids, including 9 essential ones, and over 19 different transporters, all of which act on certain overlapping subsets of these amino acids. All transporters must work interdependently for successful transfer of the required amino acids from the maternal to the fetal side; however, this complex process is not fully understood. A compartmental model of placental amino acid transport incorporating kinetic transporter models was developed and revealed to be able to sufficiently capture the integrated transport system. Modelling results clearly demonstrated how modulating specific transporter activity can increase the transport of certain classes of amino acids, but that this comes at the price of decreasing the transport of others, which could have potential implications for developing new clinical treatment options. This integrated modelling approach along with kinetic models of transporters will help in gaining an improved quantitative understanding of epithelial transport in the placenta and other systems and it is ultimately hoped that this will contribute to the development of clinical <b>applications</b> <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> or prevent impaired-transport related pathologies. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Glomerular monocyte/macrophage (Mo/Mφ) infiltrates {{play a role}} in {{many forms}} of {{glomerulonephritis}} (GN), and the intensity of Mo/Mφ trafficking correlates with the loss of renal function and histological damage. We analyzed the functional role of macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC), a potent mononuclear cell chemoattractant, during the progression of anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibody (Ab) GN, a model of crescentic GN in the WKY rat, and whether the effects of MDC were dependent on its receptor CCR 4. MDC mRNA and protein expression were markedly induced in nephritic glomeruli throughout the disease. Blocking the function of MDC did not affect the developing of the disease from days 2 to 7, but it dramatically blocked Mo/Mφ infiltration in the glomeruli, prevented crescent formation, and reversed renal function impairment during days 7 to 14 of the anti-GBM GN. In this study, we also found that MDC activity on Mo/Mφ in this GN was at least partly dependent on a new variant of CCR 4. These results suggest that MDC is critically involved in the development of anti-GBM GN from acute glomerular injury to irreversible tissue damage. In addition, an antagonist to MDC may represent a prime drug target for therapeutic <b>application</b> <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> in the progression of anti-GBM GN and in other Mo/Mφ-dominant GN...|$|E
40|$|Third state {{intervention}} before international institutions originated in international arbitration around 1875 {{and has been}} included in the statute of the International Court since the foundation of the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) and is therefore no new phenomenon. Today, most systems of international dispute settlement provide for the possibility of third {{state intervention}}. Nevertheless intervention before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has been used by states sparsely and seems underdeveloped. The statute of the ICJ provides for two ways of intervention in its arts 62 and 63. There have been few applications under these provisions. Looking at the court’s orders in these few cases, the court seems to have adopted a restrictive approach towards allowing applications to intervene. This paper looks at the institution of intervention in the area of international environmental law disputes. There have been two relevant disputes of this kind before the ICJ: the Nuclear Tests litigation and the recent litigation of Whaling in the Antarctic. Both of these cases dealt with the question of state obligations towards the protection of the environment. The applications to intervene in Nuclear Tests failed for reasons that will be explained in more detail below. New Zealand’s <b>application</b> <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> in Whaling in the Antarctic was authorized by the ICJ on the 6 February 2013 under art 63 of the Statute of the ICJ. The case is exceptional in that it is only the second time the ICJ allowed intervention under art 63. Both cases demonstrate that there are environmental issues that concern more than only the nations that are parties to the dispute. They indicate that intervention plays a particularly strong role in environmental issues because these issues by their nature often affect more than just two states. This paper analyses how the shared environmental concern of the international community might lead to an extension of intervention before the ICJ. It further more looks at the issues that arose before the court in connection with the intervention in Whaling in the Antarctic and how these issues were dealt with...|$|E

40|$|Intimate partner {{violence}} (IPV) {{is considered}} a global public health issue. Most people disapprove of partner-related abuse, yet are disinclined <b>to</b> personally <b>intervene</b> in order <b>to</b> stop the violence. Public interventions are important {{for the prevention of}} IPV, but little is known concerning psychological antecedents of public intentions <b>to</b> <b>intervene.</b> The aim of this thesis was to explore beliefs concerning IPV (Study I), to examine the psychological predictors of propensity <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> against IPV (Study II), and to experimentally test the causal effect of descriptive social norms on intentions <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> (Study III). Data for the three studies were collected through web-based surveys that were distributed to adults in the Swedish general population. In Study I, respondents estimated on average that IPV exists in 24 % of all Swedish relationships and considered psychological violence to be the most frequent type of abuse. Approximately half of the respondents believed that IPV is equally distributed across demographic groups, while persons with low socio-economic status, non-European immigrants, inhabitants of suburban areas and people in the age range of 35 - 49 were regarded as particularly vulnerable to IPV. Respondents held IPV victims partially responsible for the violence, believing, for example, that victims contribute to the abuse by acting provocatively. Eight out of ten respondents described at least one intervention strategy they would consider using in a real-life scenario, although the reported strategies were mainly limited to talking to the victim and/or the perpetrator. Overall, female respondents displayed a greater awareness of the magnitude of IPV, victims’ vulnerability, and available intervention options compared to male respondents. The findings suggest that the Swedish public needs to be better informed about IPV and specifically regarding available intervention options and victims’ vulnerability to the violence. In Study II, motivational predictors were found to account for the largest proportion of variation in respondents’ propensity <b>to</b> <b>intervene.</b> Thus, feeling morally obligated <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> and experiencing negative emotions in relation to IPV may be particularly important for the formation of intentions <b>to</b> <b>intervene.</b> Cognitive predictors accounted for a smaller, yet significant, proportion of the explained variance in propensity <b>to</b> <b>intervene.</b> Considering IPV <b>to</b> be a prevalent problem in society and not attributing solution responsibility only to the offender were associated with stronger intentions <b>to</b> <b>intervene.</b> In Study III, participants first completed a web-based survey assessing the strength of their personal norms related <b>to</b> <b>intervening</b> and a pre-manipulation measure of their propensity <b>to</b> <b>intervene.</b> Two weeks later, participants were randomly assigned to watch one of three short film sequences portraying an outdoor male-to-female physical case of IPV. Descriptive social norms were manipulated so that the film either showed (a) a bystander intervening, (b) a bystander not intervening, or (c) no visible bystander. A second questionnaire assessed a post-manipulation measure of participants’ propensity <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> and dispositional self-monitoring (i. e., inclination to adjust their behavior to perceived social demands). As predicted, participants exposed to a non-intervention social norm reported a decreased propensity <b>to</b> <b>intervene.</b> Thus, intervention rates may be reduced by social norms signaling that people do not intervene against IPV. Moreover, personal norms and self-monitoring appeared to reliably promote intentions <b>to</b> <b>intervene.</b> The current thesis contributes to the existing IPV literature, which lacks a clear picture with regard to common beliefs concerning IPV and factors that may inhibit or promote people’s intentions <b>to</b> <b>intervene.</b> Such knowledge is essential for the design of intervention programs aiming at improving public intervention rates...|$|R
