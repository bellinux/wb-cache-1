500|$|Opponents of the Jacobins saw the Ventôse Decrees as {{a cynical}} ploy {{to appeal to}} the militant extreme left. Sincere or not, Saint-Just made impassioned {{arguments}} for them. One week after their adoption, Saint-Just urged that the Decrees be exercised vigorously, and hailed them for ushering in a new era: [...] "Eliminate the poverty that dishonors a free state; the property of patriots is sacred but the goods of conspirators <b>are</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> the wretched. The wretched are the powerful of the earth; {{they have the right to}} speak as masters to the governments who neglect them." ...|$|E

It's not just asking, “If I fall down, will you <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> me?” Because it's easy to <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> someone when they're down. But it's not always easy to <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> somebody when they're doing good. And that's the question it's asking. It's like, “If I go crazy, will you still call me Superman?” It's asking, “If I'm down, will you still <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> me?” But at the same time, “If I'm alive and well, will you <b>be</b> <b>there</b> holding my hand?” That's kind of asking, “If I'm doing good, will you <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> me? Will you not be jealous of me?” That's the basic question that song's asking, and maybe throughout the years of singing that song, I might have come up with more meanings for it than it actually might have originally had." ...|$|R

500|$|The Tampa Bay Lightning hired Oates as an {{assistant}} coach in the 2009–10 season where he worked with the team's offense. Under his guidance, the team's power play finished ninth in the league and he was credited with playing a significant role in Steven Stamkos's offensive development. Oates then joined the New Jersey Devils in 2010 where he served an additional two years as {{an assistant}} coach, helping the team reach the 2012 Stanley Cup Finals, which they lost to the Los Angeles Kings in six games. New Jersey's General Manager, Lou Lamoriello, praised Oates' work with the team: [...] "He did an outstanding job for us. I wish him well. He's very communicative, very intelligent, he explains things very well. He has the resume behind him as a player and having the success he had – all the credentials <b>are</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> having the kind of respect players have for him." ...|$|E
500|$|After the tour, Bradman {{was full}} of praise for Miller, {{although}} somewhat critical of his aggressive batting, which the Australian captain thought to be reckless: [...] Bradman criticised Miller's hitting of sixes (26), feeling that his mercurial all rounder lacked restraint and concentration. In contrast, Fingleton praised Miller's attitude to cricket, saying [...] "He is never one to accept runs when they <b>are</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> the taking...I acknowledge myself the supreme believer in Miller as a cricketer. He had given me joy in the game approached by others." [...] With respect to his persistent bouncing of Hutton and Compton, Fingleton {{said that it was}} up to England to develop bowlers of express pace—which they lacked at the time—to retaliate against or deter the Australians from pursuing such tactics. Miller's persistent disagreements with Bradman soon caught up with him, despite the latter's retirement after the tour. During Bradman's testimonial match, Miller bowled three consecutive bouncers at his retired captain, dismissing him with the last of these and drawing an angry look. Bradman was one of three members of the national selection panel, and Miller was dropped for the next series against South Africa in 1949–50. Although Bradman denied voting for the omission, most of the players in the team did not believe this.|$|E
