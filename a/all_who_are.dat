5|$|In {{response}} to the growing cardistry community, Dan and Dave organized the first cardistry convention and interactive conference to promote the performance art in 2014, called Cardistry-Con. The convention saw interviews, panel discussions, live performances, exclusive video screenings, workshops, contests and giveaways. The 2015 convention was attended by journalists from magazines such as Vanity Fair and Wired as well as television stations, all of which helped further popularize cardistry as an art. Its growth {{has been associated with}} its availability with the availability of videos, lessons and podcasts, which tend to make the art more transparent and available to <b>all</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> interested.|$|E
5|$|While {{equality}} jurisprudence primarily centres {{around a}} pledge of {{the protection of}} equal laws, laws frequently classify individuals out of necessity. Needless to say, {{the very idea of}} classification is premised on, and engenders, inequality. Therein lies the paradox of equality jurisprudence. The necessity of differentiation is even more paramount in modern society with its increasingly complicated problems. Joseph Tussman and Jacobus tenBroek have proposed the doctrine of reasonable classification as the solution, whereby the legislation defines the class that includes <b>all</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> similarly situated for the purpose of the law and none who are not.|$|E

25|$|We {{believe it}} is the privilege, not only of some, but of <b>all</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> born again by the Spirit through faith in Christ as {{revealed}} in the Scriptures, to be assured of their salvation from the very day they take Him to be their Savior and that this assurance is not founded upon any fancied discovery of their own worthiness or fitness, but wholly upon the testimony of God in His written Word, exciting within His children filial love, gratitude, and obedience (Luke 10:20; 22:32; 2 Cor. 5:1, 6–8; 2 Tim. 1:12; Heb. 10:22; 1 John 5:13).|$|E
25|$|First, the Legio Maria church {{recognises}} salvation through Jesus Christ, the Son of God. The discontinuity with orthodox {{theology is}} that the Son of God has been incarnated in multiple contexts, rejecting the orthodox doctrine of Christ taking a human body and soul for eternity. As {{we have seen in}} the above research, none of these incarnations are considered exclusive; they only serve to reveal Christ to people of different contexts. <b>All</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> saved through any of these incarnations of Christ will worship God together in heaven. Thus, for the Legio Church, salvation is found through Christ, as revealed in their particular Messias Simeo Ondeto.|$|E
