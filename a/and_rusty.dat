5|$|It {{closely resembles}} its relative, the Moreton Bay fig (F.macrophylla). Having similar ranges in the wild, {{they are often}} confused. The smaller leaves, shorter fruit stalks, <b>and</b> <b>rusty</b> colour of the undersides of the leaves of F.rubiginosa are the easiest {{distinguishing}} features. It is also confused with the small-leaved fig (F.obliqua), the syconia of which are smaller, measuring 4–12mm long and 4–11mm in diameter, compared with 7–17mm long and 8–17mm diameter for F. rubiginosa.|$|E

He went on to lead the team in games played, runs scored, hits, stolen bases, walks, on-base {{percentage}} and total bases {{en route to a}} National League East division title. In the third game of the National League Division Series, Granderson picked up five RBI – this tied a Mets single game postseason record previously set by Carlos Delgado in the 2006 National League Championship Series, Edgardo Alfonzo in the 1999 NLCS <b>and</b> <b>Rusty</b> Staub in the 1973 World Series. After beating the Los Angeles Dodgers in five games in the NLDS, the Mets went on to sweep the Chicago Cubs in four games in the NLCS and advance to their first World Series since 2000.|$|E
5|$|The rufous-crowned sparrow was {{described}} in 1852 by American ornithologist John Cassin as Ammodramus ruficeps. It has also been described as belonging to the genus Peucaea, which contains several sparrows in the genus Aimophila that share characteristics, such as a larger bill and a patch of yellow under the bend of the wing, that {{other members of the}} genus do not. However, splitting the Peucaea sparrows into a separate genus is not generally recognized. A 2008 phylogenetic analysis of the genus Aimophila divided it into four genera, with the rufous-crowned sparrow and its two closest relatives, the Oaxaca sparrow <b>and</b> <b>rusty</b> sparrow, being maintained as the genus Aimophila. In addition, this study suggested that the rufous-crowned sparrow may be more closely related to the brown towhees of the genus Pipilo than {{the other members of the}} historical genus Aimophila.|$|E

5|$|The soundtrack for Silent Hill was {{composed}} by sound director Akira Yamaoka, who requested {{to join the}} development staff after the original musician had left. In addition to the music, {{he was in charge}} of tasks such as sound effect creation and audio mastering. Yamaoka did not watch game scenes, but created the music independently from its visuals. The style of his compositions was influenced by Twin Peaks composer Angelo Badalamenti. To differentiate Silent Hill from other games as much as possible, and to give it a cold <b>and</b> <b>rusty</b> feel, Yamaoka opted for industrial music. When he presented his musical pieces to the other staff members for the first time, they misinterpreted their sound as a game bug. Yamaoka had to explain that this noise was intended for the music, and the team only withdrew their initial objection after he elaborated on his reasons for choosing this style.|$|E

Montsalvat was turned into a farm and market garden. Jörgensen and his now smaller 'team' turned their creative abilities to these new projects, building the barns and sheds. Materials were scarce, but they managed to scrounge odd bits and pieces – from discarded broken bricks <b>and</b> <b>rusty</b> galvanized iron to timber poles cut from the bush. Additional to the market garden was the dairy and poultry farm with the produce being sold through the local markets.|$|E
25|$|Space {{sickness}} {{was effectively}} unknown during the earliest spaceflights, as these were undertaken in very cramped conditions; {{it seems to}} be aggravated by being able to freely move around, and so is more common in larger spacecraft. Around 60% of Space Shuttle astronauts currently experience it on their first flight; the first case is now suspected to be Gherman Titov, in August 1961 onboard Vostok 2, who reported dizziness and nausea. However, the first significant cases were in early Apollo flights; Frank Borman on Apollo 8 <b>and</b> <b>Rusty</b> Schweickart on Apollo 9. Both experienced identifiable and reasonably severe symptoms—in the latter case causing the mission plan to be modified.|$|E
25|$|The 1988 season saw Earnhardt racing {{with a new}} sponsor, GM Goodwrench, after Wrangler Jeans {{dropped its}} {{sponsorship}} in 1987.

He won three races in 1988, finishing third in the points standings behind Bill Elliott in first <b>and</b> <b>Rusty</b> Wallace in second. The following year, Earnhardt won five races, but a late spin out at North Wilkesboro arguably cost him the 1989 championship, as Rusty Wallace edged him out for it.

500|$|Salzgeber {{rode the}} same horse {{to all of}} her Olympic, World Equestrian Games and European Championship medals. Rusty 47, nicknamed Rusty, was a Latvian warmblood gelding who was named Rotors when he was {{purchased}} by Salzgeber from a German show jumping barn. The pair came to international attention at the 1997 European Championships, with a sixth place individual finish and a team gold. They repeated team gold at the 1998 World Equestrian Games, while also taking a bronze medal in individual competition. The German team, with Salzgeber, rode to another team gold at the 1999 European Championships, and Salzgeber <b>and</b> <b>Rusty</b> also took individual silver. After Gigolo, a horse ridden by Isabell Werth, was retired in 2000, Salzgeber <b>and</b> <b>Rusty</b> became the top dressage pair in Germany. At the 2000 Summer Olympics, she won the bronze medal in the individual dressage competition. She also rode {{as part of the}} gold-medal winning German team, but as the lowest-scoring member, her score was not used to determine the team's standing. During the finals, in her musical kur performance, Salzgeber's selected music stopped playing, but she continued riding and finished the event. The music to which the pair performed, Carmina Burana, was used by Salzgeber <b>and</b> <b>Rusty</b> in all their competitions and became [...] "tightly linked to the horse with its signature pirouettes and to date still best one-tempi changes ever." ...|$|E
