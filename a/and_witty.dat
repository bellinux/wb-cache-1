5|$|The Importance of Being Earnest, A Trivial Comedy for Serious People is a play by Oscar Wilde. First {{performed}} on 14 February 1895 at the St James's Theatre in London, it is a farcical comedy {{in which the}} protagonists maintain fictitious personæ to escape burdensome social obligations. Working within the social conventions of late Victorian London, the play's major themes are the triviality with which it treats institutions as serious as marriage, and the resulting satire of Victorian ways. Contemporary reviews all praised the play's humour, though some were cautious about its explicit lack of social messages, while others foresaw the modern consensus {{that it was the}} culmination of Wilde's artistic career so far. Its high farce <b>and</b> <b>witty</b> dialogue have helped make The Importance of Being Earnest Wilde's most enduringly popular play.|$|E

25|$|Through {{many of his}} traits, Caragiale was {{connected}} to a Balkan environment of virtually permanent human contact, with its humor condensed in anecdotes, mimicry, <b>and</b> <b>witty</b> comebacks. Zarifopol quoted him saying that he admired the traditional forms of entertainment, and that he admired the soitarìi ("buffoons").|$|E

Burn Notice has also been praised for its strong supporting cast members, slick production values, intriguing narrative, and dry comedic humor.|$|E
25|$|After {{leaving the}} War Office, Beith {{published}} several volumes of war histories, but his habitual light <b>and</b> <b>witty</b> prose was widely thought unsuited to so grave a subject. In 1947 his only serious play, Hattie Stowe {{was presented at}} the Embassy Theatre, Swiss Cottage, London. The play was a biographical study of Harriet Beecher Stowe; it was respectfully reviewed, but made little impact. In the same year he had one of his greatest successes, with Off the Record (co-written with Stephen King-Hall), which ran for 702 performances.|$|E

25|$|On 29 September 1841, Kierkegaard {{wrote and}} defended his dissertation, On the Concept of Irony with Continual Reference to Socrates. The {{university}} panel considered it noteworthy and thoughtful, but too informal <b>and</b> <b>witty</b> {{for a serious}} academic thesis. The thesis dealt with irony and Schelling's 1841 lectures, which Kierkegaard had attended with Mikhail Bakunin, Jacob Burckhardt, and Friedrich Engels; each had come away with a different perspective. Kierkegaard graduated from university on 20 October 1841 with a Magister Artium. He was able to fund his education, his living, and several publications of his early works with his family's inheritance of approximately 31,000 rigsdaler.|$|E
25|$|Sales soared, {{throughout}} the 1960’s, peaking {{at the end}} of the decade, thanks in part to the famous advertising campaigns by New York advertising agency Doyle, Dane Bernbach. Led by art director Helmut Krone, and copywriters Julian Koenig and Bob Levinson, Volkswagen advertisements became as popular as the car, using crisp layouts <b>and</b> <b>witty</b> copy to lure the younger, sophisticated consumers with whom the car became associated. Even though it was almost universally known as the Beetle (or the Bug), it was never officially labelled as such by the manufacturer, instead referred to as the Type 1.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} Akbar's reign, local folk tales emerged {{involving}} his {{interactions with}} Akbar, portraying him as being extremely clever <b>and</b> <b>witty.</b> As the tales gained popularity in India, he became {{even more of a}} legendary figure across the Indian subcontinent. These tales involve him outsmarting rival courtiers and sometimes even Akbar, using only his intelligence and cunning, often with giving witty and humorous responses and impressing Akbar. From the twentieth century onwards, plays, films and books based on these folk tales were made, some of these are in children's comics and school textbooks. However, no historical evidence attests that Birbal influenced Akbar by his witticisms.|$|E

Due to his charming <b>and</b> <b>witty</b> personality, he is very {{successful}} in his field, always managing to steal anything, from range of cinema tickets, spare change, wallets, and even larger items and vehicles with success. Running gag is that, whenever he steals {{a large number of}} goods, he phones his never-seen friend Bing to sell him the goods (and asks about Bing's brother, who is always in some kind of trouble). He wears a monocle, a bowler hat and stripped pants with a long coat, vest and a tie, maintaining a stoic, noble appearance, which helps him in his various schemes. He can be described as a gentleman thief.|$|E

Thereafter Eric Stemp came to DAKS from Vogue replacing Hoff as official advertising illustrator for Simpsons of Piccadilly. All advertising, some carpeting, and the Simpsons and DAKS logos were designed by Ashley Havinden, who worked with William Crawford at his company WS Crawford Ltd, for which Havinden later became the art director. DAKS have also collaborated with Vogue fashion photographers Norman Parkinson in the 1960s and Horst P. Horst in the 1970s for advertising campaigns.|$|E

She is claimed to be the most favourite judge by contestants and audiences due to her strong voice and notable experiences throughout the show. The reality show presented another aspects of Thu Minh in terms of bold multi-talent, being sensitive, loving, sincere, skillful <b>and</b> <b>witty</b> without aggressiveness. With tactful sanity from setting up the place – at the castle of Khai Silk – to directly mentoring and inviting selectively elite support from musician Nguyen Hai Phong and Vietnam's diva Hồng Nhung in order to fulfill all students with skillful and advantageous performance and tutorials, Thu Minh's team was expected to be a prosperous package of surprises and marvellous creativity each night.|$|E
