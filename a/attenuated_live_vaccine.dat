METHODS: Children were assigned randomly to receive (1) measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, varicella vaccine, and intranasal placebo on day 0, followed by 1 dose of <b>live</b> <b>attenuated</b> influenza <b>vaccine</b> on days 42 and 72; (2) measles-mumps-rubella, varicella, and <b>live</b> <b>attenuated</b> influenza <b>vaccines</b> on day 0, {{followed by a}} second dose of <b>live</b> <b>attenuated</b> influenza <b>vaccine</b> on day 42 and intranasally administered placebo on day 72; or (3) 1 dose of <b>live</b> <b>attenuated</b> influenza <b>vaccine</b> on days 0 and 42, followed by measles-mumps-rubella and varicella vaccines on day 72. Serum samples were collected before vaccination on days 0, 42, and 72. Reactogenicity events and adverse events were collected through day 41 after concurrent vaccinations and through day 10 after administration of <b>live</b> <b>attenuated</b> influenza <b>vaccine</b> or placebo alone. RESULTS: Among 1245 (99. 5 %) evaluable children, seroresponse rates and geometric mean titers for measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and varicella vaccine were similar with concurrent administration of <b>live</b> <b>attenuated</b> influenza <b>vaccine</b> or placebo (seroresponse rates of > or = 96 % for measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and > or = 82 % for varicella vaccine in both groups). Hemagglutinin-inhibiting antibody geometric mean titers and seroconversion rates to influenza strains in <b>live</b> <b>attenuated</b> influenza virus <b>vaccine</b> were similar after the vaccine was administered alone (seroconversion rates of 98 %, 92 %, and 44 % for H 3, B, and H 1 strains, respectively) or with measles-mumps-rubella and varicella vaccines (seroconversion rates of 98 %, 96 %, and 43 %). The incidences of reactogenicity events and adverse events were similar among treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent administration of <b>live</b> <b>attenuated</b> influenza <b>vaccine</b> with measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and varicella vaccine provided equivalent immunogenicity, compared with separate administration, and was well tolerated.

40|$|Several viruses {{may cause}} {{more or less}} severe acute {{respiratory}} infections in man, {{some of which are}} followed by systemic infection. Only for influenza and measles are licensed vaccines available at present. The protection induced by influenza vaccines, which are based on inactivated whole virus or viral subunits, depends largely on the matching of vaccine strain and circulating virus. Measles vaccines, which are based on <b>attenuated</b> <b>live</b> virus, have been quite effective in controlling the disease in vaccinated populations in the industrialized world. In developing countries, severe measles infections occur in infants from six to nine months of age, which necessitates the vaccination of children of less than six months. At that time maternal antibodies, that may interfere with the induction of protection, may still be present. Therefore, instead of using the parenteral route, the possibility to use the mucosal route of primary immunization is also investigated for vaccination with <b>attenuated</b> <b>live</b> measles <b>vaccines.</b> The use of inactivated measles vaccines has resulted in a state of immunity which upon exposure to the virus may induce an atypical measles syndrome including a severe pneumonia. Measles virus proteins presented in an iscom matrix have recently been shown to induce functional B and T cell responses to both the surface glycoproteins of the virus. These responses could also be induced in the presence of virus neutralizing antibodies and they proved to be protective in several animal model systems. Many of the problems that have been encountered in the development of measles vaccines, proved to be similar in the development of vaccines against other paramyxoviruses causing acute respiratory infections in man, including respiratory syncytial virus. Parenteral application of inactivated and <b>attenuated</b> <b>live</b> <b>vaccines</b> against these paramyxoviruses has generally had little success. Topical application of <b>attenuated</b> <b>live</b> <b>vaccines</b> has been more successful, and also the use of vaccinia recombinant viruses expressing foreign paramyxoviral glycoproteins has shown promising results in laboratory animals. <b>Live</b> <b>vaccines</b> based on adenovirus types 4 and 7 in oral enteric-coated vaccines, which lead to virus replication in the intestines but not in the respiratory tract have been included in military vaccination programs. The possibility to replace e. g. the E 3 region with foreign DNA makes adenoviruses also suitable as cloning vectors for proteins of other respiratory viruses. Although <b>live</b> <b>attenuated</b> <b>vaccines</b> against some of the serotypes of rhinoviruses have shown promising results, the generation of a multivalent vaccine against this epidemiologically most significant cause of acute respiratory infections will be almost impossible, due to the multiplicity of serotypes involved.

This lipobox motif directs post-translational modifications at the conserved cysteine through the consecutive action of three enzymes: Lgt, LspA and Lnt, which results in di- or triacylated forms. Lipoproteins are abundant in all bacteria including Mycobacterium tuberculosis and often involved in virulence and immunoregulatory processes. On the one hand, disruption of the biosynthesis pathway of lipoproteins leads to attenuation of M. tuberculosis in vivo, and mycobacteria deficient for certain lipoproteins have been assessed as <b>attenuated</b> <b>live</b> <b>vaccine</b> candidates. On the other hand, several mycobacterial lipoproteins form immunodominant antigens which promote an immune response.

Exploiting lipoproteins as vaccines is thus a complex matter which requires deliberative investigation.
