I wasn't in a great space {{with some of the}} other albums I've done." [...] She went on to say, [...] "I played Lil' Kim the album the other day, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> it was incredible and that there was not one song on it that she didn't like." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{has claimed}} to be the {{biological}} father of baby Dannielynn Hope Marshall Stern. Following the death of the baby's half-brother Daniel Wayne Smith, Smith put his name on the disputed second birth certificate issued for the baby then known as Hanna Rose. Stern's sister, Bonnie, says Smith told her months before the birth that Birkhead could be the father. [...] "When I spoke to (Smith) in March, when she found out she was pregnant, I took her shopping, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> the baby was due in mid-October, and that one other person could have been the father and that was Larry Birkhead, but nobody else." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lord, father! Dus Malbone {{would no}} more think of askin' {{me to have}} her, than she'd think of marryin' you! I've offered three times, <b>and</b> <b>she's</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> as plain as a woman could speak, that she couldn't nohow consent, and that I hadn't ought {{to think of her}} any longer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's them! Of course it's them!" [...] cried Mrs. Aleshine. [...] "I had a feelin' {{while we}} were scootin' {{downhill}} that they was {{near and dear to}} us, though exactly why and how, I didn't know. <b>And</b> <b>she's</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she's</b> Lucille, <b>and</b> of course the other must be Emily, though what relations--" ...|$|R

2500|$|Well, it wasn't {{really my}} idea ... I didn't like {{the thought of}} doing it like {{everyone}} else–maybe a mix through the back catalog and a few exclusive new tracks by some key artists... I wanted something more special. Then a while ago I met Emika, she’s making music herself on Ninja Tune. We sat together one day last summer <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> about her last visit to Berghain. It was a regular Sunday morning and she noticed how everything in the building was resonating and vibrating and swinging and humming–she realized that there were lot of sounds coming from the building itself. That led {{to the idea of}} doing field recordings within the building while it's not open to the public ... It took about two or three weeks ... It was a four gigabyte library.|$|E
2500|$|As the taped {{conversation}} continued, {{the jury}} heard Saldívar's {{reaction to the}} news of Selena's death after her phone picked up a local radio station's signal. In an angry voice, Saldívar asked Young why he had kept the singer's condition from her, since she wanted to visit Selena at the hospital, believing she was still alive. Young told Saldívar not to believe the radio announcement, {{and that he did}} not know about Selena's current condition. The conversation then switched to Saldívar blaming Quintanilla, Jr. for the murder claiming that he threatened to kill her. She explained to Young that she bought the gun for protection after finding her car tires deliberately slashed. She also told him how Quintanilla, Jr. sexually abused her by [...] "sticking a knife" [...] in her vagina, threatening to murder her if she went to the police. When asked about what happened in her motel room, Saldívar exclaimed: [...] "I bought this gun to kill myself, not her, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> 'Yolanda, I don't want you to kill yourself.' And we were talking about that when I took it out and pointed it to my head, and when I pointed it to my head, she opened the door. I said 'Selena, close that door,' and when I did that gun went off." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kirsten {{told police}} he went to Cornell’s room at 12:15a.m., but couldn't access the locked room. He then had a {{telephone}} conversation with Vicky Cornell. [...] "I told Vicky that they wouldn’t come open the door <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> to kick it open. I did. Upon entry, I found the bedroom door locked. I called the hotel operator {{and told her that}} I needed security to open the bedroom door. They refused again, and I told them that I’m going to damage the hotel room and (they) need to send security, call 911 and call an ambulance. I kicked the bedroom door 6-7 times before it somehow popped open. I went inside and the bathroom door was partially opened and I could see his feet." [...] Kirsten told police in a signed statement. Kirsten said that Vicky {{was on the phone with}} him the whole time asking for updates, [...] "She told me that she called the front desk and they hung up on her. It was a female. She called back a couple minutes later and a male answered, saying that it was (the first) that he was hearing about the incident." [...] Kirsten said in his statement that he loosened the band around Cornell's neck then tried to resuscitate him by compressing his chest. Medical personnel arrived at 12:56 a.m and tried to resuscitate the singer with no success.

It's unknown how long it took the bodyguard to gain entry to the hotel room and find Cornell.|$|E

6000|$|... "Of course, {{it suits}} Charlie Foss to say so," [...] said Mrs. Dowson; [...] "naturally he'd say so; he's got reasons. I believe every word she says. If <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> I {{was coming in}} for a fortune I should believe her; <b>and</b> if <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> I {{was going to have}} misfortunes I should believe her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] she said, [...] "it all {{happened}} before my time--long before. I never knew her." [...] <b>And</b> then presently <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> the story.|$|R
2500|$|Scherzinger credits Whitney Houston {{as being}} her {{greatest}} musical influence and idol, saying {{she wanted to}} [...] "be Whitney" [...] when she grew up. She admired Houston {{so much that she}} auditioned with her version of [...] "I Will Always Love You" [...] at her Popstars audition. When Scherzinger was growing up in her home town of Louisville, she received a Christmas gift (at the age of six) of a tiny purple boombox and a cassette of Whitney Houston's chart-topping 1985 self-titled debut album. [...] "My parents had no money, but they got me this player and Whitney's album, which had [...] "The Greatest Love of All" [...] on it," [...] Scherzinger recalls. [...] "That was it for me. From that moment on I wanted to sing. Her voice was so powerful; every note she sang just felt like the truth." [...] Scherzinger also named Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Roberta Flack, Sade Adu, Alanis Morissette, Toni Braxton and Tina Turner as her biggest influences while growing up. Scherzinger said that Beyoncé also inspired her, stating: [...] "I am inspired by women like Beyoncé who wear costumes that aren't much but they are real artists and they put real artistry into what they do and that is how I pride myself." [...] Scherzinger said while she is on stage performing, she borrows personas of Tina Turner and Mick Jagger: [...] "The way he [...] prances around stage and the poise he has on stage. But I love Tina Turner's attitude and sass. I steal from her all the time, especially being the lead singer of this group, the Pussycat Dolls, to be fearless and just have that attitude and that soul behind you." [...] Scherzinger also cites Gwen Stefani as an influence. Janet Jackson and MIA are also influences to her. When Scherzinger was older, Mariah Carey became a huge influence to her. She also wished to work with the Black Eyed Peas saying she admired their music. Scherzinger is also a fan of Adele. Critically acclaimed, [...] "Pop Prince", Prince also became a big influence when she was in her teens. Michael Jackson was one of Scherzinger's biggest influences and idols. Paula Abdul, who Scherzinger sat alongside on the judging panel of The X Factor, was one of her influences. When she gained the role on Men in Black 3, Scherzinger said that music was a very big part of her inspiration for the character, which she plays for the film. She said, [...] "I listened to my heavier music and I listened to Led Zeppelin and I kind of got in that frame of mind because music is what inspires me most. I worked with my acting coach a lot <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> about lots of crazy things to think about while I was in character, but I better not tell you what she said." [...] Scherzinger said that the role has inspired her to record differently on her second studio album.|$|E

6000|$|... 'You needn't {{take the}} trouble. She's coming home-along to-night {{of her own}} accord. I have seen her this morning, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> so.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, if {{you must}} know, I'm {{speaking}} about Ruth Stevenson, who goes to a young ladies' school not far from Colby Hall. <b>She</b> <b>and</b> I are very good friends, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{a good deal about}} this quarrel you had with her father." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pray don't get up, Furley," [...] he begged, {{shaking hands}} with him. [...] "I hope you'll forgive such an {{informal}} visit. I met Miss Abbeway on my {{way down to the}} sea, <b>and</b> when <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>she</b> was coming to call on you, I asked leave to accompany her." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{big eyes}} here assumed an {{expression}} that was intended to kill me outright with kindness: from being calm, still, reserved, Angelica suddenly became gay, smiling, confidential, <b>and</b> folatre. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> had heard I was a sad creature, <b>and</b> that <b>she</b> intended to reform me, and that I must come and see Frank a great deal.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{called at}} Mrs. Plymdale's this morning, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{that he had}} taken the house in St. Peter's Place, next to Mr. Hackbutt's." ...|$|E

6000|$|Well, then we sat down, and I took a smoke, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{all about}} her people in Massachusetts--her father is a {{physician}} {{and it is an}} old and respectable family--(I am able to believe anything she says.) <b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> how [...] "Karl" [...] is 26 years old; and how he has had passionate longings all his life toward art, but has always been poor and obliged to struggle for his daily bread; and how he felt sure that if he could only have one or two lessons in-- ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes; perfectly! I {{could hardly}} believe it when I saw him at church on Sunday. It was like seeing one risen from the dead. What he must have gone through, <b>and</b> Ellen! <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> how Mr. Peck had helped him in the struggle. She {{attributes}} everything to him. But of course you think {{he had nothing to}} do with it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{asked her}} what it was. I don’t see,” went on Mr. Blunt, with a {{perfectly}} horrible gentleness, “why I should have shown particular consideration to the heiress of Mr. Allègre. I don’t mean to that particular mood of hers. It was the mood of weariness. <b>And</b> so <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> It’s fear. I will say it once again: Fear. [...] .” ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Briss stared again. [...] "Already? She was, at any rate, with Mr. Long, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> on my meeting {{them that}} they had just come from the pastels." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I was not told. Do you not {{see that}} I was deceived there. Mrs. O'Hara clearly said {{that the man was}} dead. <b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> nothing of the galleys." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lorna {{was angry}} again last night. <b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> if you didn't stop your nagging she'd go {{away from home}} and stay. Said she could afford to pay her board." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She is gone!" [...] he cried, with a gasp of relief. [...] "No, by heaven! there <b>she</b> is again, <b>and</b> nearer--coming nearer. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> {{would come}} for me, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> keeps her word." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah!' said Lady Elizabeth, 'I fear {{we are in}} {{some degree}} the cause. My poor Emma was {{imprudent}} enough to quote Colonel Martindale; <b>and</b> <b>she</b> has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>she</b> was frightened by a pale look of anger that crossed his face, and something which he muttered between his teeth. But he made her believe Arthur his seducer!' ...|$|R

6000|$|When the mid-dinner change came {{we talked}} a little about {{indifferent}} things, making a stiff conversation like a bridge over a torrent of unspoken intimacies. We discussed something; I think Lady Tarvrille's flowers and the Cape Flora <b>and</b> gardens. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> had a Japanese garden with three Japanese gardeners. They were wonderful little men to watch. [...] "Humming-bird gardeners," [...] she called them. [...] "They wear their native costume." ...|$|R
