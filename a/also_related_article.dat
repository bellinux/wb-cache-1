40|$|AbstractRenal cell {{carcinoma}} (RCC) {{is a highly}} lethal genitourinary malignancy due to infrequent early diagnosis, which responds poorly to conventional immune therapy, chemotherapy or radiotherapy in metastatic disease. There have been great advances {{in the understanding of}} the molecular mechanisms of RCC in recent years, especially with regards to dysfunction of the Von Hippel–Lindau tumor suppressor gene in clear cell type RCC. This dysfunction has been shown to result in the activation of downstream angiogenesis related genes such as vascular endothelial growth factor. Treatment targeting this molecular pathway has been shown to improve patient prognosis and has become the standard treatment for metastatic clear cell RCC. Herein, we report a case of advanced and metastatic RCC initially presenting as low-back pain, but without the typical symptoms. Physical, laboratory and imaging examinations revealed a large left kidney tumor and multiple metastases to the liver and bones. The patient received oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor target therapy with a good tumor response. Treatment of RCC has entered the era of molecular target therapy, however some issues still need to be addressed, such as the safety issue of tyrosine kinase inhibitor and role of cytoreductive surgery.

40|$|Relationship between {{homicide}} {{and mental}} disorders Relação entre homicídio e transtornos mentais Abst rac t Objective: Several {{studies have found}} a relationship between severe mental disorders and violence. One of the approaches to study this theme are investigations with homicide offenders. The aim of the present article {{was to investigate the}} association between homicide and mental disorders. Method: A review of the literature was made through the following databases: Medline, Scientific Eletronic Library Online and Lilacs. In the Medline system, it was <b>also</b> searched the <b>related</b> <b>articles</b> section. Results: Although there is an association between mental disorders and homicide, it is not clear why some patients behave violently and others do not. Comorbid alcohol/drugs disorders and personality disorders and lack of adherence to treatment may increase this risk. Conclusions: Identifying people with risk of violence and offering them mental health treatment services is warranted. These services should prevent the loss of contact and non-compliance with treatment that frequently precede homicide committed by people with severe mental disorders. It is of utmost importance that society and governmental authorities decrease the barriers that limit access to psychiatric and psychosocial treatment...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{examine the}} effect of thermal agents on the range of {{movement}} (ROM) and mechanical properties in soft tissue and to discuss their clinical relevance. DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and EMBASE) were searched from their earliest available record up to May 2011 using Medical Subjects Headings and key words. We <b>also</b> undertook <b>related</b> <b>articles</b> searches and read reference lists of all incoming articles. STUDY SELECTION: Studies involving human participants describing the effects of thermal interventions on ROM and/or mechanical properties in soft tissue. Two reviewers independently screened studies against eligibility criteria. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted independently by 2 review authors using a customized form. Methodologic quality was also assessed by 2 authors independently, using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. DATA SYNTHESIS: Thirty-six studies, comprising a total of 1301 healthy participants, satisfied the inclusion criteria. There was a high risk of bias across all studies. Meta-analyses were not undertaken because of clinical heterogeneity; however, effect sizes were calculated. There were conflicting data on {{the effect of}} cold on joint ROM, accessory joint movement, and passive stiffness. There was limited evidence to determine whether acute cold applications enhance the effects of stretching, and further evidence is required. There was evidence that heat increases ROM, and a combination of heat and stretching is more effective than stretching alone. CONCLUSIONS: Heat is an effective adjunct to developmental and therapeutic stretching techniques and should be the treatment of choice for enhancing ROM in a clinical or sporting setting. The effects of heat or ice on other important mechanical properties (eg, passive stiffness) remain equivocal and should be the focus of future study...|$|R
