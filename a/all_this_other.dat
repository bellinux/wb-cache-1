2500|$|On 8 September 2008, Dana Rohrabacher (a senior Republican {{member of}} the United States House of Representatives) Foreign Affairs Committee, argued at a House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee meeting, {{according}} to The Daily Telegraph, that Georgia started the fighting on August 7, citing unidentified intelligence sources. Further, Telegraph reported that [...] "Mr Rohrbacher insisted that Georgia was to blame", citing him: [...] "The Georgians broke the truce, not the Russians, {{and no amount of}} talk of provocation and <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>other</b> stuff can alter that fact." [...] Telegraph stated: [...] "His comments got little attention in the United States but have been played prominently on state-run Russian television bulletins and other media." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Portland Monthly on December 18, 2012, Franzen revealed that he currently had [...] "a four-page, single-spaced proposal" [...] for a fifth novel he was currently working on, although {{he went on to}} suggest that while he had a proposal there was no guarantee that what was proposed would make the final cut, saying of similar proposals for previous novels, [...] "I look at the old proposals now, and I see the one part of them that actually got made into a book, and I think, 'How come I couldn't see that? What is <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>other</b> stuff?'". Franzen also hinted that the new novel would probably also be long, adding [...] "I've let go of any illusion that I'm a writer of 150-page novels. I need room to let things turn around over time and see them from the whole lives of other characters, not just the single character. For better or worse, one point of view never seems to do it for me." [...] In October 2014, during a discussion at Colgate University, Franzen read a [...] "self-contained first-person narrative" [...] that is part of a novel that he hopes will be out in the summer of 2015.|$|E
2500|$|The {{head of the}} Tombouctou Manuscripts Project at the University of Cape Town, Shamil Jeppie, {{said that}} the {{destruction}} was akin {{to that of the}} Buddhas of Bamiyan. [...] "It's a real loss for people in the town, in the region and on the continent. Timbuktu was a center of Islamic learning, a very significant center — there is lots of internal and external evidence of this. But Ansar Dine is ignorant of this. For them, there is only one book and it's the Quran. <b>All</b> <b>this</b> <b>other</b> (Islamic) learning is inconsequential to them." [...] The Chairman of the Malian Manuscript Foundation Michael Covitt, said from New York that the action led to [...] "generations and generations of culture being destroyed." [...] However, early estimates of the extent of the destruction were overstated. Timbuktu residents successfully saved more than 300,000 manuscripts by hiding or smuggling them out of Timbuktu. No more than 4,000 documents were lost or damaged when rebels set fires within the Ahmed Baba Institute, and all of them belonged to a set that had been copied by digitization. However, many of the preserved manuscripts were damaged in the process of rescuing and hiding them. In 2014 UNESCO appealed for assistance to conserve and restore the Timbuktu manuscripts and to continue making digital copies.|$|E

6000|$|John stood amazed; then {{he shook}} the bottle, and, to his further wonder, found it partly empty. Three or four glasses were gone. Alan must have uncorked {{a bottle of}} whisky and drunk three or four glasses one after the other, without sitting down, for there was no chair, and that in his own cold lobby on this {{freezing}} night! It fully explained his eccentricities, John reflected sagely, as he mixed himself a grog. Poor Alan! He was drunk; and what a dreadful thing was drink, and what a slave to it poor Alan was, to drink in this unsociable, uncomfortable fashion! The man who would drink alone, except for health's sake--as John was now doing--was a man utterly lost. He took the grog out, and felt hazier but warmer. It was hard work opening the portmanteau and finding his night things; and before he was undressed, the cold had struck home to him once more. [...] "Well," [...] said he; [...] "just a drop more. There's no sense in getting ill with <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>other</b> trouble." [...] And presently dreamless slumber buried him.|$|E
6000|$|He {{came the}} next day, {{and again the}} next day after that, and {{delivered}} two lectures on physics to our mutual satisfaction.

It was tremendously difficult stuff, but I do not think he ever suspected how much I did not understand him. There were moments when I doubted whether I was well employed, but at any rate I was resting from that confounded play. Now and then things gleamed on me clearly for a space, only to vanish just when I thought I had hold of them. Sometimes my attention failed altogether, and I would give it up and sit and stare at him, wondering whether, after all, it would not be better to use him as a central figure in a good farce and let <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>other</b> stuff slide. And then, perhaps, I would catch on again for a bit.|$|E

5000|$|Allen {{announced}} he had retired his mare on January 16, 2009. [...] "She’s smart, {{and you can}} rate her; you can really do anything with her,” Allen said. “She just seems like she wants to win. She’s a wonderful mare. We would love to retire her undefeated, but more than anything else, we want to retire her sound; she’s been so good to us. We’ve had a little criticism for not running her in open company and not running her in this or that and <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>other</b> stuff. But Joel Marr said it best, ‘If it’s so easy, I’m surprised there haven’t been 100 of them like her.’” ...|$|E
5000|$|... "At {{the time}} I think they only {{published}} two fantasy or science fiction writers at all. One was Tolkien {{and one was}} Peter S. Beagle. So once they picked me up, because they are primarily a company known for literary fiction, for philosophy, for history, for some fairly academic high-end stuff, I had a certain legitimacy that lifted {{me out of the}} genre in Germany. And then a couple of good things happened very quickly, including among other things somebody decided to do it as a radio play, which wound up being the longest radio play in German radio history, and <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>other</b> stuff happened and the books really took off there." ...|$|E

"For us Frenchmen, {{the fact}} is that a {{government}} still exists in France, a government supported by a Parliament established in non-occupied territory and which in consequence cannot be considered irregular or deposed.

5000|$|... "A {{large part}} of our relationship, {{especially}} when we got into doing Anarky, became a friendly philosophical debate over politics and conspiracy theory; mysticism versus scientism and <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>other</b> stuff.

In {{the years that followed}} the creation of Anarky, both Norm Breyfogle and Alan Grant experienced changes in their personal and professional lives which they attributed to that collaboration. Each man acknowledged the primary impact of the character to have been on their mutual friendship and intellectual understanding. In particular, their time developing the Anarky series led to a working relationship centered on esoteric debate, discussion, and mutual respect.|$|E

During a concert on May 24, 2010, in the Prague club, Abaton, Blythe was involved in an incident {{that resulted in the}} death of Daniel Nosek, a 19-year-old attending fan. According to eyewitness statements cited by the Czech online daily newspaper aktuálně.cz following Blythe's arrest, Blythe was chanting [...] "Come on up" [...] between songs, which, the newspaper stated, may have been intended to invite applause from the audience and not a direct invitation to fans. The newspaper went on to report that the fan tried to climb onstage and was thrown by the singer from the stage, falling backwards directly on his head. According to the same paper, Nosek was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol, suffered serious brain trauma, fell into a coma, and died weeks later from his injuries.|$|E

She gave an interview on pole vaulting technique which was uploaded to YouTube and it received over one hundred thousand views, but comments and discussion on the internet largely remained sexual and in relation to her looks. Her father, a lawyer by trade, began to review online material to identify illegal behaviour or stalkers. Reflecting on her situation, Stokke told The Washington Post [...] "even if {{none of it is}} illegal, it just all feels really demeaning. I worked so hard for pole vaulting and <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>other</b> stuff, and it's almost like that doesn't matter. Nobody sees that. Nobody really sees me."
