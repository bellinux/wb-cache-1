5|$|The next day, Peter {{gets the}} Lizard photos {{published}} in the Bugle and gets the money he needs. However, when Gwen, Eddie, and the Connors find out, they <b>are</b> <b>outraged</b> that he ran off simply to take pictures and say he has lost their trust. Although Martha understands the difficult choices that Peter had, she fires him. He secretly grabs another vial of gene cleanser and returns home, frustrated about his reputation. Blaming the events that gave him his powers, {{he is about to}} take the vial when he sees a photo of himself with Ben. Realizing that he had saved Curt either way, he decides that Spider-Man is needed and hides the vial under his desk.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene in}} the {{courtroom}} where Lisa is put on trial for stealing the skeleton {{is seen as a}} reference to the 1920s Scopes Monkey Trial in Dayton, Tennessee, which dealt with issues of {{separation of church and state}} and the debate between creationism and evolution. The publicity stunt created by the mall developers in the episode has been compared to scientific hoaxes such as the Cardiff Giant and the Piltdown Man. When Lisa asks if the townspeople <b>are</b> <b>outraged</b> at the end of the episode for being fooled by a publicity stunt, Chief Wiggum is about to answer her but is distracted when he catches sight of a Pottery Barn in the new Heavenly Hills mall. A shot of the diggers in silhouette against the sunset is modeled after Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981).|$|E
5|$|Animals {{eventually}} follow Evan to Congress. When Long discovers this, {{he allows}} Evan latitude at first, but warns {{him that he}} will no longer tolerate it if it happens again in the future. Meanwhile, Evan's staffers <b>are</b> <b>outraged</b> by his change of appearance and behavior. When Evan returns to the ark during construction, God presents him with a robe, and later tells Evan that the flood will likely come at mid-day on September 22. When Joan becomes suspicious of his behavior, Evan tells her the truth: God has been talking to him and is responsible for his new look and recent actions, although Joan does not believe Evan and is convinced that he is beginning to lose his mind. After wearing the robe for some time, Evan finds it comfortable, but he soon realizes that God will not allow him {{to take it off}} and wear anything else after two failed attempts to change his clothes later. The next time Evan arrives at Congress for work, animals follow him once again and he is mysteriously changed into his robe halfway through the session. Evan reluctantly explains his divine mission, although Long does not take him seriously, and Evan is fired from Congress and later removed his name from the Public Land Act bill. Evan deduces that God purposely had him fired from Congress, so that he would have more time to build the ark. In continued skepticism, Joan leaves Evan alone after believing that he was going insane.|$|E

Selene enters and tells them she has saved Sir Ethais's life, but the jealous fairies are not {{interested}} in listening to her. Selene is perplexed at her sisters' changed attitude.|$|E

500|$|In The Two Towers (1954), {{the second}} {{volume of the}} story, Saruman is the main antagonist. Orcs from Saruman's army attack Frodo and his companions, and carry off two of Frodo's closest friends, Merry and Pippin.

He again irritates the cast and crew of The Girlie Show when he changes the name to TGS with Tracy Jordan (or just TGS).|$|E
500|$|Comic book {{historian}} Peter Sanderson {{criticized the}} story for using a supernatural element to retcon the marriage and not maturely dealing {{with the issue of}} divorce, arguing the writers had forgotten stories where Spider-Man dealt with his causing the death of Uncle Ben, drugs and child abuse. He wrote, [...] "I expect {{there are people who are}} professional comics writers and editors, and people who will someday become professional comics writers and editors, who <b>are</b> <b>outraged</b> that Marvel had Spider-Man make a deal with the devil. And these present and future writers and editors will be determined to undo it. We shall see whether it takes twenty years this time, or much less." [...] He found the story better than the Clone Saga in the respect that it altered an aspect of canon, instead of erasing it entirely. He also criticized the idea of a hero making a deal with one as evil as Mephisto, effectively the devil.|$|E

500|$|Homer takes Maggie to a daycare and {{encourages}} her {{to enjoy a}} mural featuring Krusty the Clown {{to make her feel}} better while she is away from her parents. However, Krusty arrives to have the images of his face sandblasted from the mural, as his likeness is trademarked and used without his permission. This left Maggie upset and an outraged Homer shoves Krusty in retaliation, sending him flying into a wood chipper and shredded alive. Homer is later approached by two advertising agents who have heard of his deed and explain their plan to use celebrities' likenesses in advertising without issues over permission by simply killing the celebrities who refuse to lend their names to advertising. Homer is then hired as a celebrity assassin, taking out such famous faces as actor George Clooney, singer Prince, and astronaut Neil Armstrong. In Heaven, the dead celebrities <b>are</b> <b>outraged</b> by this and stage an attack on the living, with Homer as their main target. [...] Krusty's angel kills Homer, who gets revenge by locking [...] all the celebrities out of Heaven, leaving only himself and the apparently gay [...] Abraham Lincoln.|$|E

When Leslie goes to city planner Mark (Paul Schneider) to vent about her situation and seek help, she is stunned to learn that he has taken a buyout and plans to join a construction company, partially in response to Ann (Rashida Jones) having broken up with him; she angrily calls him [...] "Mark Brendana-Quits". Meanwhile, Ann is struggling with her redeveloping feelings for her ex-boyfriend Andy (Chris Pratt). Later, Ann suggests to Leslie she should hold the concert at Lot 48, as it is not a park and therefore not shut down. Meanwhile, April (Aubrey Plaza) and Andy finally reveal their feelings to each other, but April still rejects him, believing Andy still has feelings for Ann.|$|E

United States Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, not FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, was especially singled out for responsibility. Montgomery in fact admired Hoover for his strongly anticommunist stance.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first group}} {{exhibition}} of Cubism transpired at the 1911 Indépendants. The {{result of the}} group show is a major scandal. Both {{the public and the}} press <b>are</b> <b>outraged</b> by the obscurity of the subject matter, represented as cones, cubes and spheres. The predominance of sharp geometrical faceting and the fact that a group of artists are all working in similar directions, gives rise to the term 'Cubism'. Although similar terms (i.e., [...] "cubes") have been used before in relation to the works of Cross (1901), Metzinger and Delaunay (1906, 1907) and Braque (1908), the term [...] "Cubism" [...] emerges {{for the first time at}} the inauguration of the 1911 Salon des Indépendants; imposed by 'scandal-mongering journalists who wished to create sensational news' (to use the words of Gleizes). The term was used derogatorily to describe the diverse geometric concerns reflected in the paintings of five artists in continual communication with one another: Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay, Le Fauconnier and Léger (but not Picasso or Braque, both absent from this massive exhibition).|$|E
