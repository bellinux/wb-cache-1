5|$|The Whiskey Rebellion {{demonstrated}} that the new national government had the will and ability to suppress violent resistance to its laws, though the whiskey excise remained difficult to collect. The events contributed {{to the formation of}} political parties in the United States, a process <b>already</b> <b>underway.</b> The whiskey tax was repealed in the early 1800s during the Jefferson administration.|$|E
5|$|With the new {{campaign}} <b>already</b> <b>underway,</b> Niemer was replaced as UB-16s commander by Oblt. Hugo Thielmann on 18 March. Although only {{in command of}} UB-16 for {{little more than a}} month, Thielmann sank one ship on UB-16. The 107-ton Dutch motor vessel Arie was sunk in the Hoofden area on 20 April; there were no reports of casualties.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, NATO issued NATO Basic Military Requirement 3 (NBMR-3) which {{specified}} a VTOL aircraft, {{albeit one}} with the supersonic performance of an aircraft such as the F-4 Phantom II, along with the VTOL capability. Recognising that the P.1127 would not satisfy this, Hawker commenced work upon a new project, designated P.1150, which was effectively a supersonic derivative of the P.1127, as well as another version, designated P.1154, which would meet the specified requirements of NBMR-3. The P.1154 was declared {{the winner of the}} NATO competition; prototype construction was <b>already</b> <b>underway</b> at the point of cancellation in 1965. The French government had withdrawn shortly after the P.1154's selection over the Dassault Mirage IIIV.|$|E

50|$|Production {{ended in}} September 2006, with about 350,000 LT models {{produced}} on over nine years. Plans {{for the third}} generation of the 'large transporter' from Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles had <b>already</b> gone <b>underway,</b> and later that year, the Volkswagen Crafter was launched.|$|R
5|$|Heydrich invited {{representatives from}} several {{government}} ministries, including state secretaries from the Foreign Office, the justice, interior, and state ministries, and {{representatives from the}} SS.

Of the 15 who attended, 8 held academic doctorates.|$|R
5|$|In July 2000, Silver Dollar City {{announced}} {{that they would be}} adding the Wildfire roller coaster to their park in 2001. At a cost of $14 million, the ride would be the most expensive attraction in the park's history. At the time of the announcement, construction was <b>already</b> <b>underway</b> on an undeveloped portion of land in the outskirts of the park. All of the ride's footings were in place with some of the steel supports already erected. Construction was expected to be completed in early January the following year, leaving three months for testing, landscaping and theming. On April 4, 2001, Wildfire officially opened to the public.|$|E
5|$|In Taylor's view, {{the best}} way forward was to admit California as a state rather than a federal territory, as it would leave the slavery {{question}} out of Congress's hands. The timing for statehood was in Taylor's favor, as the Gold Rush was well underway {{at the time of}} his inauguration, and California's population was exploding. The administration dispatched Rep. Thomas Butler King to California, to test the waters and advocate on behalf of statehood, knowing that the Californians were certain to adopt an anti-slavery constitution. King found that a constitutional convention was <b>already</b> <b>underway,</b> and by October 1849, the convention unanimously agreed to join the Union—and to ban slavery within their borders.|$|E
5|$|The Washington administration's {{suppression}} of the Whiskey Rebellion met with widespread popular approval. The episode demonstrated that the new national government had the willingness and ability to suppress violent resistance to its laws. It was, therefore, viewed by the Washington administration as a success, a view that has generally been endorsed by historians. The Washington administration and its supporters usually did not mention, however, that the whiskey excise remained difficult to collect, and that many westerners continued to refuse to pay the tax. The events contributed {{to the formation of}} political parties in the United States, a process <b>already</b> <b>underway.</b> The whiskey tax was repealed after Thomas Jefferson's Republican Party came to power in 1801, which opposed the Federalist Party of Hamilton and Washington.|$|E
30|$|Finally, non-anthropocentric ways of {{thinking}} have long been acknowledged and affirmed by thinkers in the deep ecology movement as vital to mitigating the ecological crisis that is <b>already</b> well <b>underway.</b> And whatever other philosophical and theological arguments {{can be made for}} the cosmology of karma and rebirth, the non-anthropocentric emphasis of this cosmology is a factor in its favor.|$|R

50|$|The first machine shops {{started to}} appear in the 19th century when the Industrial Revolution was <b>already</b> long <b>underway.</b> Before the {{industrial}} revolution parts and tools were produced in workshops in local villages and cities on small scale often for a local market. The first machinery that made possible the Industrial Revolution were also developed in similar workshops.|$|R
5|$|The rapid {{intensification}} of Patricia was well-anticipated but poorly forecast. Meteorologists at the NHC indicated {{the possibility of}} such in the system's first advisory as a tropical depression. They noted the only inhibiting factor would be how quickly the storm could organize an inner core. Just {{before the onset of}} rapid intensification, the agency was unable to utilize the Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme rapid intensification guidance due to technical errors. This likely contributed to even greater errors in the agency's forecast. Initial forecasts were consistently conservative with intensity and dramatic strengthening was not explicitly shown until rapid intensification was <b>already</b> <b>underway.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{site was}} {{approved}} in 1934, {{under the supervision}} of CORF (Commission d'Organisation des Régions Fortifiées), the Maginot Line's design and construction agency. Work by the contractor Chanel of Antibes began in 1935 at a cost of 14.5 million francs. A second phase was planned to add an artillery block. This was scaled back to a pair of separate artillery casemates. A separate entrance block was proposed in April 1940, linking to the casemates. As the initial confrontation with Germany was <b>already</b> <b>underway,</b> {{it was too late to}} be built, with a projected construction time of 18 months.|$|E
5|$|As Revenge was {{the nearest}} {{of the three}} pirate vessels to the Americans, Allen ordered Alligator boats lowered to run inshore and attack her. Some 40 men armed with small arms were put into the boats, with Allen {{personally}} taking command of the launch, Lieutenant Dale the cutter, and midshipman Henley the gig. Revenge was <b>already</b> <b>underway</b> {{by the time it}} was sighted and attempted to escape the Americans despite the lack of wind, using its sweeps. After the American boats had rowed about , the pirate schooner made an about-face and raised a red flag. Upon approaching the pirates, the American craft were fired on with both grape and round shot. The American boats returned fire with small arms and moved in to board the vessel. Rather than try to fight off the boarding attempt, the pirates abandoned Revenge while another schooner covered their escape. Alligator gig manned by Henley and four men was sent off to take Revenge as a prize.|$|E
50|$|All {{were built}} {{at a time}} when {{commercial}} shipping traffic was increasing on the Great Lakes between Canada and the U.S. because of new trade agreements and the opening of the Sault Ste. Marie Canal locks in 1855. The settlement of the Bruce Peninsula was <b>already</b> well <b>underway</b> at the time, also making the lighthouses timely as navigational aids for the boats and ships.|$|R
50|$|In recent years, most of {{the work}} on the RC5-72 project has been {{submitted}} by clients that run on the GPU of modern graphics cards. Although the project had <b>already</b> been <b>underway</b> for almost 6 years when the first GPUs began submitting results, as of January 2017, GPUs represent 76% of all completed work units, and complete over 93% of all work units each day.|$|R
50|$|When Perry left {{government}} in 1981, Kaminski became Director for Low Observables Technology, {{with responsibility for}} overseeing the development, production and fielding of major stealth aircraft systems such as the F-117 (<b>already</b> well <b>underway</b> at the time) and Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit (which was just being defined), along with an advanced, stealthy cruise missile and other programs. Kaminski held this position from 1981 to 1984.|$|R
5|$|Coal mining {{was done}} in the {{watershed}} of Black Creek as early as the winter of 1836–1837. Several people operated in the area until 1865, when it was leased to the E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company for 99 years. However, the mining was stopped by a strike in 1872 and for some time thereafter mining was done by several smaller companies. The mine in the watershed was run by the Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western Railroad between 1901 and 1921. The Glen Alden Corp. then operated it until 1938, at which point underground mining in the watershed stopped. Strip mining was <b>already</b> <b>underway</b> there and it continued until 1955, when all mining stopped. During World War II, coal waste in the watershed was rerun through a coal processing plant to recover coal. In 1971, the land was owned by the Blue Coal Company. A total of 22 million tons of coal have been mined in the area.|$|E
5|$|Following White's retirement, the Oak Room {{continued}} to operate under Reid, albeit {{with a new}} menu where the prices were reduced by between a third to a half. The majority of the staff remained with Reid, with Jeff Galvin installed as the new head chef, until he left to run the restaurant L'Escargot in May 2000. MPW Criterion was wound up on 11 September 2001; by which time planning was <b>already</b> <b>underway</b> to close the Oak Room, which took place on 15 February 2002. By this time, there were 15 other kitchen staff, and a further 15 front of house staff. There was some added difficulty for calculating the redundancy packages for the staff since {{none of them had}} written contracts, and were only calculated from the period when the restaurant was owned by the MPW Criterion company; this reduced Reid's total service from nine years to four.|$|E
5|$|Lara {{returns to}} the {{survivors}} on the beach to find that Whitman has betrayed them, abducting Sam and handing her over to Mathias. Lara, Jonah, and Reyes give chase, heading up a river in the fixed boat to the monastery, with Lara arriving {{just in time to}} see Mathias trick Whitman into approaching and speaking to some of Stormguards, who kill him. After fighting her way through both the Solarii and the Stormguard, Lara arrives at the top of the monastery where Mathias is performing the Ascension ritual. Lara fights her way to the central platform, and after a struggle, shoots Mathias off the platform to his death using both his pistol and her own in her signature dual-wielding style. Despite Mathias' death, the ritual is <b>already</b> <b>underway,</b> with Himiko's soul starting to pour into Sam. Lara then destroys Himiko's ancient remains, saving Sam and dispersing the storms.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ideology}} was influently worded by José Vasconcelos {{who in his}} La Raza Cósmica formulated {{a vision}} of how a [...] "race of the future" [...] would be created by mixing the mongoloid, negroid, and caucasian races. As the place where this mixing was <b>already</b> well <b>underway,</b> Mexico, and Latin America in general, {{was the center of}} the creation of this new and improved species of human beings, the mestizo.|$|R
50|$|A {{steady stream}} of Irish {{immigration}} to Eastern Ontario (<b>already</b> well <b>underway)</b> {{in the next few}} decades, along with French Canadians who crossed over from Quebec, provided the bulk of workers involved in the Rideau Canal project and the timber trade. The canal was dubbed the Rideau Canal when it was finally completed in 1832. Colonel By laid out the town, most of his original street plans remain today.|$|R
50|$|That was a late monument, however, as the {{merging of}} all {{unstressed}} short vowels was <b>already</b> well <b>underway</b> by that time. Most likely, the difference was maintained only in spelling traditions, {{but it had been}} mostly lost in speech. With the introduction of new scribal traditions in the 12th and 13th century, the practices were abandoned, and unstressed vowels were consistently written as e from that time onward.|$|R
5|$|Mughal-e-Azam {{is one of}} {{only two}} films {{directed}} by Asif; one of his unfinished projects was released posthumously as a tribute. Over time the title has become part of Bollywood vernacular, used to describe a project that is taking too long to complete. Art director Omung Kumar, who has designed sets for major Indian films such as Black (2005) and Saawariya (2007), said that he and others in his field look to Mughal-e-Azam as a source of inspiration for art direction. It has also been used {{as a model for the}} perfect love story, requiring directors to ensure lovers overcome obstacles. Following her success in the film, Madhubala could have gone on to land further major roles, but she was advised not to overwork owing to her heart condition, and had to withdraw from some productions that were <b>already</b> <b>underway.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Queensland Government State Disaster Management Group {{dispatched}} relief {{helicopters to}} remote communities for evacuation {{of people in}} flood zones and transport of relief workers. Relief efforts were <b>already</b> <b>underway</b> in relation to Cyclone Larry which caused significant damage in Queensland. The Government of Australia assisted affected business by providing disaster loans up to A$25,000 for severely impacted areas and A$10,000 for less affected areas. Farmers were also provided with up to $200,000 in loans {{over a period of}} nine years. Following the impacts in the Northern Territory, two cleanup teams were dispatched from Darwin to assist in cleanup efforts in the hardest hit regions. Despite the minimal damage caused by Monica, the name was retired from the circulating lists of tropical cyclone names for the Australian Region.|$|E
5|$|The {{sections}} of the International that recognised {{the leadership of the}} International Secretariat remained optimistic about the possibilities for increasing the International's political influence and extended the entrism into social democratic parties which was <b>already</b> <b>underway</b> in Britain, Austria and elsewhere. The 1954 congress emphasised entrism into communist parties and nationalist parties in the colonies, pressing for democratic reforms, ostensibly to encourage the left-wing they perceived to exist in the communist parties to join with them in a revolution. Tensions developed between those who subscribed to the mainstream views of Pablo and a minority that argued unsuccessfully against open work. A number of these delegates walked out of the World Congress, and would eventually leave the International, including the leader of the new British section, John Lawrence, George Clarke, Michele Mestre (a leader of the French section), and Murray Dowson (a leader of the Canadian group).|$|E

50|$|In 1785 Ivanovskaya {{was renamed}} to Pella, {{an allusion to}} the birthplace of Alexander the Great and the illustrious future {{intended}} for Alexander. In April 1785 Catherine wrote to Melchior Grimm that she planned {{to set up an}} English landscape park around Pella; in fact, earlier, on March 13, 1785, she authorized Ivan Starov's draft for a spacious, proper imperial palace. Groundbreaking ceremony was celebrated on July 17, 1785 when work has <b>already</b> been <b>underway.</b>|$|R
50|$|For {{comparison}} {{to an earlier}} retirement, when the Saturn IB was last flown in 1975 for the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, the Shuttle development program was <b>already</b> well <b>underway.</b> However, the Shuttle did not fly until 1981, which left a six-year gap in U.S. manned spaceflight. Because of this and other reasons, in particular, higher than expected Solar activity that caused Skylab's orbit to decay faster than hoped, the U.S. space station Skylab burned up in the atmosphere.|$|R
