5|$|The Cormier {{brothers}} were {{the sons of}} Edmond Cormier and Bernadette Doucette. They {{grew up on a}} farm in what is now Memramcook, New Brunswick. Four of the brothers had long careers as professional wrestlers, while a fifth, Malcolm Cormier, competed briefly before becoming a referee. None of the brothers wrestled under the family surname, however, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> adopted ring names. One of the brothers explained that the brothers' real names were too hard to pronounce, so they adopted other names that were easier for international fans. Yvon Cormier was given the name The Beast, Jean-Louis was known as Rudy Kay, Leonce took the name Leo Burke, and Romeo competed as Bobby Kay. Malcolm, the oldest of the brothers involved in wrestling, used the name Mel Turnbow while working as a referee.|$|E

Honey immediately recognizes Anna and declares them best friends instantly. She and Will share a private moment in a garden square as they walk back from the birthday party. The following evening {{they go to a}} restaurant, where Will overhears a group of patrons making crude remarks about Anna and attempts to defend her, before Anna steps in herself and humiliates them. As they walk back to her hotel, she invites Will up to her room. But when he arrives, she tells him he must leave immediately. Her American movie star boyfriend (who was never mentioned until now) appears and starts to bark orders at him, as well as make unflattering comments about Anna's weight.

5|$|Since {{their first}} {{competitive}} match, more than 750 players {{have made a}} competitive first-team appearance for the club, {{many of whom have}} played between 25 and 99 matches. Dimas, Tahar El Khalej and Nemanja Matić all fell one short of 100 appearances, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> moved elsewhere while the season was ongoing. Four former players went on to be first-team managers: Cosme Damião, Ribeiro dos Reis, Vítor Gonçalves and Cândido Tavares. Hugo Leal, who appeared 41 times for the club, is the youngest player to have played for Benfica. He was 16 years and 335 days when he played against Sporting de Espinho on 20 April 1997. Axel Witsel and Ederson hold the club record sale at €40 million each, while Raúl Jiménez is the record purchase at €21.8 million. Nemanja Matić is the only player listed to have been selected as Primeira Liga Player of the Year. Of the players still at the club, Raúl Jiménez is the closest to 100 appearances; he has played in 94 matches.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} boom resulted in drawing {{large numbers of}} aborigines out of their villages and into the unskilled or low-skilled sector of the urban workforce. Manufacturing and construction jobs were generally available for low wages. The aborigines quickly formed bonds with other communities <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> had similar political motives to protect their collective needs {{as part of the}} labor force. The aborigines became the most skilled iron-workers and construction teams on the island often selected to work on the most difficult projects. The result was a mass exodus of indigenous members from their traditional lands and the cultural alienation of young people in the villages, who could not learn their languages or customs while employed. Often, young aborigines in the cities fall into gangs aligned with the construction trade. Recent laws governing the employment of laborers from Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines have also led to an increased atmosphere of xenophobia among urban aborigines, and encouraged the formulation of a pan-indigenous consciousness in the pursuit of political representation and protection.|$|E

The ousted passenger, luckily a strong swimmer, had made it to shore, but his companions must not have fancied the idea of following him into the frigid and swift water, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> paid their fares immediately.|$|E

25|$|Individuals and {{practitioners}} {{need to be}} aware that during the elimination process patients can display aspects of food addiction, masking, withdrawals, and further sensitization and intolerance. Those foods that an individual considers as 'must have every day' are suspect addictions, this includes tea, coffee, chocolate and health foods and drinks, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> contain food chemicals. Individuals are also unlikely to associate foods causing problems because of masking or where separation of time between eating and symptoms occur. The elimination process can overcome addiction and unmask problem foods so that the patients can associate cause and effect.|$|E
25|$|Lee Malia {{has stated}} that the typical writing process {{involves}} Oliver Sykes writing the main structure of the songs, followed by Malia writing the main riff. From this they would collaborate {{with each other to}} structure their work better and then to later include the rest of the band in writing the rest of the song. The writing dynamic of Sempiternal, typically featured Sykes, Malia and newly introduced member Jordan Fish, Malia felt that with Fish's influence on the record he was pushed to create more inspired guitar riffs. <b>As</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> took a break before writing their fourth album they felt less of a need for an isolated writing environment.|$|E

25|$|In 1997–99, {{the stadium}} was renovated again in {{accordance}} with FIFA guidelines, and its capacity was reduced to 83,450. The stadium continued to be the home ground of Dynamo with the Lobanovsky stadium serving as a training ground. Sometime after 1998 big changes took place as {{it was no longer}} efficient to keep and maintain the stadium as a club ground. Dynamo decided to reconstruct the Lobanovsky Dynamo Stadium as its primary ground because match attendances rarely exceeded 10,000 spectators. Since that time Olympic has been used primarily for football international matches and was lent to FC Dynamo Kyiv for high-profile home games when a high attendance was expected. However it is not the official home ground of Dynamo or any other Kiev club, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> have smaller home stadiums and training bases. The stadium is an official home ground of the Ukraine national football team and was the official venue of the Ukrainian Cup final until 2008. From 2008 Olympic underwent a major reconstruction in preparation for the continental championship.|$|E

Andrew becomes a suspect after being reported missing. Realizing what Charles is planning to do with Alison, the Liars hatch a plan to get out of the dollhouse by setting his vault on fire. The plan worked successfully, and the girls get out of the dollhouse where they are met by Alison, Ezra, Caleb, Toby, and the police. Andrew is arrested and accused of kidnapping the girls. However, the girls are far from okay, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> suffer from PTSD from their time in captivity. Another girl, Sara Harvey, who went missing the same time Ali did, is found in the dollhouse, reportedly having been held there for two years. Unable to deal with her home life, she runs away and stays with Emily for a while.
