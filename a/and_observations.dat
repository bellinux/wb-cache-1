5|$|Al-Zarqali (1028–1087) {{developed}} {{a more accurate}} astrolabe, used for centuries afterwards. He constructed a water clock in Toledo. He discovered that the Sun's apogee moves slowly relative to the fixed stars, and obtained a good estimate of its motion for its rate of change. Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (1201–1274) wrote an important revision to Ptolemy's celestial model. When he became Helagu's astrologer, he was given an observatory and gained access to Chinese techniques <b>and</b> <b>observations.</b> He developed trigonometry as a separate field, and compiled the most accurate astronomical tables available up to that time.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with his}} {{scientific}} fame, Newton's {{studies of the}} Bible and of the early Church Fathers were also noteworthy. Newton wrote works on textual criticism, most notably An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture <b>and</b> <b>Observations</b> upon the Prophecies of Daniel, and the Apocalypse of St. John. He placed the crucifixion of Jesus Christ at 3 April, AD 33, which agrees with one traditionally accepted date.|$|E

He was also a prolific author who wrote on both scientific and social issues; his account of his adventures <b>and</b> <b>observations</b> during his explorations in Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia, The Malay Archipelago, was both popular and highly regarded. Since its publication in 1869 it has never been out of print.|$|E

5|$|During the 20th century, {{the field}} of {{professional}} astronomy split into observational and theoretical branches. Observational astronomy is focused on acquiring data from observations of astronomical objects, which is then analyzed using basic principles of physics. Theoretical astronomy is oriented toward the development of computer or analytical models to describe astronomical objects and phenomena. The two fields complement each other, with theoretical astronomy seeking to explain observational results <b>and</b> <b>observations</b> being used to confirm theoretical results.|$|E
5|$|Experiments <b>and</b> <b>observations</b> {{show that}} Einstein's {{description}} of gravitation accounts for several effects that are unexplained by Newton's law, such as minute anomalies in {{the orbits of}} Mercury and other planets. General relativity also predicts novel effects of gravity, such as gravitational waves, gravitational lensing and an effect of gravity on time known as gravitational time dilation. Many of these predictions have been confirmed by experiment or observation, most recently gravitational waves.|$|E

The implementation of supervision <b>and</b> <b>observation</b> by judge is intended to guarantee the court decision has been properly implemented. Based on this subject, this study is aimed to see the implementation of supervision <b>and</b> <b>observation</b> by “Wasmat judge in Yogyakarta” district court to imprisonment decision of corruption criminal act. Furthermore, this research is aimed to examine problems {{in the implementation of}} supervision <b>and</b> <b>observation</b> by judge to imprisonment decision and effort to overcome the existed problem in the implementation of supervision <b>and</b> <b>observation</b> by judge to imprisonment decision of corruption criminal act. This study uses descriptive method with normative approach. The result show that the implementation of supervision <b>and</b> <b>observation</b> task by judge to imprisonment decision of corruption criminal act is based on Supreme Court Circular Number 7 in 1985 and KUHAP. In performing supervision duties, supervisor and observer judge is more focus on the supervision such as whether the attorney has perform execution toward court decision. In performing <b>observation,</b> supervisor <b>and</b> observer judge is more addressed to inmates behavior and evaluation of the relationship between criminal inmates and punishment that imposed by the court. So, it can be used as material research for provisions that benefit the criminal. It is also found that there is obstacle wich is rules about the implementation of supervision <b>and</b> <b>observation</b> to corruption criminal act who has serve out the punishment and less coordination between the courts, prosecution and prison. ...|$|R
