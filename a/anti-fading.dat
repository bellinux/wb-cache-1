50|$|A simple <b>anti-fading</b> antenna is a {{vertical}} radiator whose height is between 1/2 wavelength (180 electrical degrees) and 5/9 wavelength (200 degrees), 195 degrees being considered ideal. 200 degree and taller simple radiators have largely fallen into disuse, although {{these can be}} useful on medium power stations, in which case radiators as tall as 5/8 wavelength (225 degrees) are somewhat common. Any simple radiator (or array of radiators) which is taller than 195 degrees is generally not considered to have <b>anti-fading</b> properties.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>anti-fading</b> antenna (informally {{and often}} {{incorrectly}} termed a [...] "Franklin" [...] antenna) is a long- and medium-wave transmission antenna {{with a flat}} vertical radiation pattern. The design goal is to move the mush zone farther from the transmitter site. An <b>anti-fading</b> antenna will reduce radiation at elevations of more than 50 degrees as much as possible. In principle, such a radiator should be as thin as possible, although thicker radiators improve the bandwidth and contribute to a taller effective height.|$|E
50|$|Another form of <b>anti-fading</b> mast antenna is a {{circular}} array antenna, {{in which a}} number of mast radiators are arranged on a circle and fed in equal phase. With this design, very flat radiation patterns may be produced, although they are very expensive since multiple radio masts are required. Taldom transmitter and Tulagino transmitter in Russia are currently the only radio stations in the world using such antennas. At one time, longwave transmitter Orlunda in Sweden also used an antenna of this type.|$|E
30|$|Cells were cultured {{on cover}} slips, washed twice with PBS and then fixed with chilled methanol. Cells were then washed three times with PBS and blocked in PBS with 1 % BSA for 10 min. Cells were {{incubated}} with {{primary and secondary}} antibodies for one hour, respectively. Samples were mounted with prolong <b>anti-fade</b> kit (Invitrogen) and observed on a fluorescent microscope.|$|R
30|$|Next, goat serum {{was applied}} before {{polyclonal}} rabbit antihuman caspase- 3 antibody (Abcam, UK) at a 1 in 100 dilution and was incubated with cells for 60  min. FITC-labelled HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma, Dorset, UK) was added afterwards, followed by mounting using 6 -diamidino- 2 -phenylindole (DAPI; staining nuclei in blue) containing <b>anti-fade</b> ProLong Gold reagent (Life Technologies Ltd, Paisley, UK). The fluorescence emitted from each slide was observed via a confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and images were recorded accordingly.|$|R
30|$|Cell {{cultures}} were rinsed with D-PBS (37  °C) then {{fixed in}} 4  % paraformaldehyde for 30  min, followed by permeabilization with 0.3  % Triton X- 100 for 15  min at ambient temperature. After blocking with 10  % goat serum in D-PBS for 1  h, primary antibodies against Tuj 1 (Sigma), Smi 312 (Covance) and GFAP (Sigma) were applied, and incubated overnight at 4  °C, followed by rinsing in D-PBS for 5 times and visualization with Alexa Fluor 488, 555, 633 conjugated secondary antibodies (1 : 400, Invitrogen). Rhodamine or Alexa Fluor 488 labeled Phalloidin (1 : 40, Invitrogen) {{was used for}} labeling actin cytoskeleton. Hoechst 33342 was used for labeling the cell nucleus. Samples were sealed with the mounting medium <b>Anti-fade</b> Gold (Invitrogen). All reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise noted.|$|R
50|$|Sectional: the {{structure}} is divided into usually two sections with insulators between, usually center-fed. This collinear arrangement enhances low-angle (ground wave) radiation and reduces high-angle (sky wave) radiation. This increases {{the distance to the}} mush zone where the ground wave and sky wave are at similar strength at night. This type of antenna is known as an <b>anti-fading</b> aerial. Practical sectionals with 120 over 120 degrees, 180 over 120 degrees and 180 over 180 degrees are presently in operation with good results.|$|E
50|$|These antennas {{are usually}} {{constructed}} using a metal radio mast, which is fed both {{at its base}} and at an appropriate height. The radio mast is usually insulated from ground and is divided electrically by a separation insulator into two parts. For feeding of the upper part, either a cable inside the mast construction or the ladder, which must be mounted on insulators, is used. This design is employed in the Mühlacker, Wolfsheim and Hamburg medium-wave transmitters. <b>Anti-fading</b> antennas with two separation insulators are installed at Ismaning.|$|E

The mast is a very prominent feature visible from major highways in the vicinity. There is a shorter (81 metres AGL) vertical guyed radiator on the site which provides a standby capability during main antenna maintenance.|$|E
50|$|The {{handling}} was average, but {{adequate for}} the era, with coil independent suspension {{at the front}} and leaf springs at the rear, employing lever arm shock absorbers or 'dampers' which, when worn, resulted in a characteristic 'wave motion' over undulating surfaces. The underpinnings were somewhat less exotic than the all-enveloping bodywork: the chassis and running gear were based on that of the well-proven 1949 Austin A70 Hampshire saloon (not {{to be confused with}} the smaller entry level A40 Devon). Brakes were initially a mix of hydraulic (front) and mechanical (rear) with 11 in drums, replaced by a fully hydraulic brake setup from 1951 onwards on the hardtop coupe (saloon)which with large diameter finned drums and vented wheels. This made for efficient <b>anti-fade</b> braking for the time, necessary to bring 26cwts (1323.64 kg) to rest.|$|R
30|$|As {{described}} (Zhu et al., 2018), cells cultured on coverslips were washed with PBS twice, fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde (PFA) {{dissolved in}} 1 × PBS for 25 min, permeabilized with 0.1 % Triton X- 100 in 1 × PBS for 10 min and blocked with 3 % bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 1 × PBS for 1 h. Samples were incubated with primary antibodies (diluted 1 : 500) overnight at 4 °C, {{and then with}} secondary antibodies (diluted 1 : 800) for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, the coverslips were sealed with glycerol mounting medium containing <b>anti-fade</b> reagent. Unless otherwise stated, images were captured on a Leica TCS SP 5 confocal microscope with a 63 ×/ 1.40 N.A.Plan Apochromat oil immersion objective lens using LAS AF (version 1.3. 1 build 525) software. High-resolution fluorescent images were captured by GI-SIM.|$|R
30|$|MSC {{grown on}} coverslips were fixed in cold {{methanol}} at − 20  °C for 7  min. Samples were incubated with PBS containing 4  % BSA to saturate non-specific binding and incubated overnight at 4  °C with anti-prelamin A antibody (Santa Cruz Sc- 6214) diluted at 1 : 100. Coverslips were then washed {{several times in}} PBS and incubated 1  h at RT with donkey anti-goat secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Sc- 3853) diluted 1 : 100. After washes with PBS, the nuclei were counterstained with 4, 6 -diamino- 2 -phenylindole (DAPI). The slides were mounted with an <b>anti-fade</b> reagent in glycerol and observed. To measure the percentage of prelamin A positive cells, microphotographs of a minimum of 6 random fields were taken for each sample and prelamin A positive cells were manually counted. Imaging was performed using a laser-scanning motorized confocal system (Nikon A 1 R, Nikon, Amsterdam, Netherlands) equipped with an Eclipse Ti-E inverted microscope and four laser lines (405, 488, 561, and 638  nm). A Plan Apo VC 60 x/ 1.4 NA Oil DIC N 2 objective lens was used. Images were processed using NIS-Elements AR 4.10. 01 software (Nikon, Amsterdam, Netherlands).|$|R
5000|$|At {{the time}} of initial {{establishment}} Radio 4QG operated from the Executive Buildings in Brisbane City.

For many years now Radio 4QG/4RN has shared (with Radio 4QR) a tall dual <b>anti-fading</b> guyed and sectionalised vertical radiator of 198 metres AGL with structural capacitative top hat located at Bald Hills on the northern outskirts of Brisbane.

50|$|The mediumwave {{transmitter}} Flevoland (Middengolf Zendstation Flevoland) is a broadcasting {{facility for}} medium wave near Zeewolde {{in the province}} of Flevoland, Netherlands, situated at 5°25′ E and 52°23′ N.It has been used for broadcasting on 747 kHz (until September 2015) and 1008 kHz with a nominal power of 400 kilowatts. As aerial two guyed steel framework masts with a height of 195 metres are used, which form an <b>anti-fading</b> aerial. These masts are grounded and carry a cage aerial, which is upperward the separation insulator, separating the masts in a height of 95 metres in two parts, connected toward the mast construction. The radiation diagram is directional, with a maximum gain of 4 dB in South-Eastern direction, to compensate for the variation in electrical admittance of terrain in the Netherlands.|$|E
5000|$|A {{more complex}} <b>anti-fading</b> antenna is a {{vertical}} radiator which is sectionalized {{and is one}} wavelength (360 degrees, generally 180 over 180 degrees, and historically and correctly termed a [...] "Franklin" [...] radiator; two in an array at KFBK), or 300 degrees (180 over 120 degrees, and formally called a WHO radiator), or 240 degrees (120 over 120 degrees, and formally called a WOAI radiator, but WOAI has since replaced this with a 195 degree radiator for lower maintenance cost {{at the expense of}} somewhat poorer [...] "fringe" [...] reception). Several have been incorporated into phased arrays (directional antennas). When so sectionalized the sections are themselves phased so as to provide the optimum vertical radiation pattern (suppressing high-angle radiation). An advantage of the 180 over 180 degree configuration is no ground radial system is required, and the bottom of the lower section may be insulated from the ground; for the others, the bottom of the lower section is usually connected to a ground radial system through a capacitor.|$|E

They were next permeabilized and blocked with 0.1 % saponin and 3 % (w/v) BSA in PBS. The tissue sections were further incubated during 1  h at 37 °C. Immunofluorescence was performed with monoclonal antibodies against insulin, IAPP, glucagon, and somatostatin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA). All were rabbit monoclonal antibody except for IAPP, {{which was a}} mouse monoclonal antibody. Rabbit anti-chromogranin A, anti-pancreatic polypeptide, and anti-synaptophysin antibodies were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA). Each antibody was applied overnight at 4 °C at a 1 / 50 dilution with a solution containing 0.1 % saponin and 3 % (w/v) BSA. The pancreatic sections were washed three times with PBS containing 0.05 % Tween 20 ™ and then incubated 1  h at 37 °C in the blocking buffer containing a secondary antibody.

30|$|For {{enumeration}} of prokaryotes and viruses, 100  mg subsamples {{were taken}} from every sampling depth and placed in sterile 2  mL Eppendorf tubes. The subsamples were fixed with 2  % glutaraldehyde final concentration (25  % EM-grade, Merck, diluted in sterile seawater), for 15  min at 4  °C. As storage before extraction results in decreased prokaryotes cell and virus count (Carreira et al. 2015 b), subsamples were immediately treated and placed on a filter, after which they were stored. Extraction of prokaryotes and viruses from the sediment samples was performed according to the protocol by Carreira et al. (2015 b). In short, subsamples were incubated with 0.1  mM EDTA (final concentration) on ice and {{in the dark for}} 15  min, ultrasonicated (Soniprep 150; 50  Hz, 4  μm amplitude, exponential probe) for three cycles of 10  s with 10  s intervals in ice-water. One microliter of each subsample and 1  μL of Benzonase Endonuclease from Serratia marcescens (Sigma-Aldrich; > 250 U μL− 1) were added to 1  mL of sterile MilliQ water (18.2 MΩ), and incubated at 37  °C in the dark for 30  min. The digestion of free nucleic acids was stopped by placing the sample on ice, directly followed by filtration onto a 0.02  μm pore size filter (Anodisc 25, Whatman) and stained according to Noble and Fuhrman (1998) using SYBR Gold (Molecular Probes®, Invitrogen Inc., Life Technologies™, NY, USA).

Viruses and prokaryotes were counted using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped for epifluorescence (100  W mercury lamp, excitation with a BP 450 – 490, emission LP 515, beam splitter FT 510). Magnification of the ocular was × 12.5 and the oil lens (Plan-NEOFLUAR) was x 100. At least 10 fields and 400 viruses and prokaryotes were counted per sample. Abundances were presented per gram of wet weight (as samples were too small, i.e. 100  mg, to conduct simultaneous measurements of abundance and water content). Counting error was 1.5 and 10  % for viruses and prokaryotes respectively.|$|R

It has been found that when the Al– 10 Sr alloy wire was used, a desirable modification was obtained after 2 min and reached to the best performance at 60 min, and the optimum Sr addition amount was 0. 04 – 0. 06 wt%, and the good modification performance was kept even after 300 min.

(1) A composite preamble scheme is {{proposed to improve}} the target recognition resolution of passive radar using WiFi. Thereby, a higher communication performance than normal multiplex integration can be obtained. The composition can only be applied at the Tx side. It can also be applied at both the Tx and Rx sides, {{which means that the}} preamble at the Tx and Rx sides can be replaced by the same composite preamble simultaneously. (2) The synthesis can be in the time domain, or in the frequency domain which possesses good autocorrelation, <b>anti-fading</b> performance and sharper ambiguity function. Thus, the channel estimation of the long preamble is retained, and its recognition resolution is improved. (3) In this paper, a time-domain composite at the Tx side combined with cancelation and decomposition is studied. We verified that the method can improve the resolution of object recognition for interior scenes. The scene can be empty; it can also include some fixed arrangement. And we are adding more pertinent recognition test for application-specific scenario; we will also focus on applying suitable composite(such as f-domain composite) preamble at both the Tx and Rx sides next; there would then be no need to consider the effects of deletion and residues.|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} two decades, chaotic modulations have drawn {{a great deal of}} {{attention}} in low-power and low-complexity wireless communication applications due to their excellent <b>anti-fading</b> and anti-intercept capabilities. Of particular interest is the differential chaos shift keying (DCSK), which is considered as a very promising chaotic modulation scheme that achieves not only good error performance, but also low implementation complexity. In this treatise, we provide an insightful survey on the state-of-The-Art research in DCSK-based communication systems through an extensive open literature search. In doing so, we firstly review the principles of DCSK modulation and the significant milestones since its inception. Subsequently, we introduce meritorious variants of DCSK, all of which can outperform the original one in certain aspects. We also present the joint design guidelines when combining DCSK with other critical techniques, e. g., error-correction coding and cooperative communication, in wireless communications under both single-user and multiaccess scenarios. Besides, we summarize research progress in the application of DCSK-based communication systems to ultra-wideband scenarios and their corresponding advantages. Specifically, we restrict our attention to the relevant modulation and system designs, as well as their performance-Analysis methodologies. This survey aims not only to allow researchers understanding the development and current status of DCSK-based communication systems, but also to inspire further research in this area.

40|$|The microstructures and {{modification}} {{performance on}} 4032 aluminum alloy of the Al– 10 Sr master alloy wire prepared from “direct reaction-hot extrusion” and the trapezoidal block from “direct reaction” were systemically studied by using optical metallurgical microscope, XRD and SEM. It {{was found that}} the preparation processes exhibited a significant effect on the microstructures of the Al– 10 Sr, which thereby influenced its modification performance. It has been found that when the Al– 10 Sr alloy wire was used, a desirable modification was obtained after 2  min and reached to the best performance at 60  min, and the optimum Sr addition amount was 0. 04 – 0. 06  wt%, and the good modification performance was kept even after 300  min. However, when the Al– 10 Sr alloy trapezoidal block was used, a desirable modification was started after 30  min and reached to the best performance as long as 120  min, and the optimum Sr addition amount was 0. 06 – 0. 08  wt%, and the effective modification period was only 180  min. Therefore, comparing with the Al– 10 Sr alloy trapezoidal block, the Al– 10 Sr alloy wire had better modification efficiency, which not only reduced the Sr addition amount of about 30 %, but also greatly decreased the incubation time and improved the ability of <b>anti-fading...</b>|$|E
40|$|Lactic acid {{bacteria}} (LAB) {{are used}} as starter or probiotic cultures in the food and pharmaceutical industry and, therefore, rapid and accurate methods {{for the detection of}} their viability are of practical relevance. In this study 10 LAB strains, belonging to the genera Enterococcus, Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus and Weissella, were subjected to heat and oxidative stresses and cell injury or death was assessed comparing different fluorescent probes (Syto 9; Propidium Iodide, PI; 4, 6 -diamidino- 2 -phenylindole, DAPI; 5,(6) -carboxyfluorescein diacetate, cFDA) to identify the stain combination which most reliably allowed the detection of live/metabolically active and dead cells. Protocols for specimen preparation and staining were optimized and a simple procedure for automated cell counts was developed using NIH ImageJ macros. Cysteine and semi-solid agar solution were efficiently used as <b>anti-fading</b> agent and mounting medium, respectively. The double staining cFDA-PI apparently offered the best and most versatile indication of both cell metabolic activity and membrane integrity. An excellent correlation between manual and automated cell counts for the majority of strain/stain combinations was found. This work provided a simple protocol for specimen preparation and staining based on the use of safe, easy to prepare and inexpensive reagents as compared to other methods. Additionally, the automated cell count procedure developed can be applied to several bacterial species and allows {{to increase the number of}} experimental trials and the reproducibility and sensitivity of the analysis...|$|E
