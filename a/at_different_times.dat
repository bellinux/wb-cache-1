40|$|Modeling {{financial}} <b>time</b> series <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>time</b> scales {{is still}} an open challenge. The choice of a suitable indicator quantifying {{the distance between the}} model and the data is therefore of fundamental importance for selecting models. In this paper, we propose a multiscale model selection method based on the Jensen–Shannon distance in order to select the model that is able to better reproduce the distribution of price changes <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>time</b> scales. Specifically, we consider the problem of modeling the ultra high frequency dynamics of an asset with a large tick-to-price ratio. We study the price process <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>time</b> scales and compute the Jensen–Shannon distance between the original dataset and different models, showing that the coupling between spread and returns is important to model return distribution <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>time</b> scales of observation, ranging from the scale of single transactions to the daily time scale...|$|R
