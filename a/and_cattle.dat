5|$|Founded in 1891, the Society for the {{improvement}} of New Forest Ponies organised a stallion show and offered financial incentives to encourage owners of good stallions to run them on the Forest. In 1905 the Burley and District NF Pony Breeding <b>and</b> <b>Cattle</b> Society was set up to start the stud book and organise the Breed Show; the two societies merged in 1937 to form the New Forest Pony Breeding <b>and</b> <b>Cattle</b> Society. Overall numbers of livestock grazing the Forest, including ponies, tended to decline in the early twentieth century; in 1945 there were just 571 ponies depastured. By 1956 the number of ponies of all breeds on the Forest had more than doubled to 1,341. Twenty years later pony numbers were up to 3,589, rising to 4,112 in 1994, before dipping back below four thousand until 2005. As of 2011, there were 4,604 ponies grazing on the New Forest.|$|E

5|$|A leat {{from this}} stretch was created at {{around the time}} of the {{construction}} of the canal to provide water for the Twyford Mead water meadows. Farming of the water meadows continued until around 1930, after the closure of the navigation itself. It was a labour-intensive method of land management, but the controlled flooding of the meadows, with the deposition of silt from the water, enabled the land to produce two crops of hay per year, as well as grazing for sheep <b>and</b> <b>cattle.</b> Demonstrations of the techniques used to flood the meadows are still carried out occasionally.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, {{industrial}} development quickened. New technology increased farm productivity through automation of feedlots for hogs <b>and</b> <b>cattle,</b> machine milking at dairy farms, and raising chickens in large buildings. Planting became more specialized with hybridization {{of corn and}} wheat, {{and the use of}} farm machinery such as tractors and combines became the norm. University of Minnesota professor Norman Borlaug contributed to these developments as part of the Green Revolution. Suburban development accelerated due to increased postwar housing demand and convenient transportation. Increased mobility, in turn, enabled more specialized jobs.|$|E

40|$|The {{financial}} {{risks associated with}} cattle feeding have increased substantially in recent years. Returns have been highly volatile <b>and</b> frequently low. <b>Cattle</b> feeders have available a number of marketing alternatives which they can use to help reduce price risks for major inputs such as corn <b>and</b> feeder <b>cattle</b> <b>and</b> for the final production of fed cattle. These alternatives include futures markets for these 3 commodities as well as options markets for corn <b>and</b> fed <b>cattle.</b> However, with the numerous marketing alternatives available to the producer the marketing decision can be complex. One tool that can aid the producer in making marketing decisions is price forecasts;Monthly price forecasts were developed for corn, feeder <b>cattle,</b> <b>and</b> fed <b>cattle</b> using several different techniques including: econometric models, ARIMA models, naive forecasts, expert opinion, and composites of these. These forecasts were analyzed both statistically for their accuracy and economically {{for their ability to}} signal market transactions that would reduce the risks and increase the profitability associated with cattle feeding. Hedging strategies for corn, feeder <b>cattle,</b> <b>and</b> fed <b>cattle</b> <b>and</b> options strategies for fed cattle were simulated over the July 1978 through 1985 period. The results of a mean-variance analysis indicated that forecast-signaled corn <b>and</b> feeder <b>cattle</b> hedges were able to increase profitability though not decrease variability of returns. Fed cattle forecast-signaled hedging strategies when combined with the feeder <b>cattle</b> <b>and</b> corn hedges resulted in both increased average returns and decreased variability.
