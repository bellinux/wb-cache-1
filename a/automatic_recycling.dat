One hundred eighty-three participants were told that they would exchange information and later interact with a partner or simply exchange information but not interact with a partner. As part of the information exchange, participants received either a strong, factual argument about the necessity of recycling or a weak, opinion based argument, supposedly written by their partner. They then took measures that assessed their implicit and explicit recycling attitudes. When given a strong argument, participants showed more positive implicit recycling attitudes, regardless of the interaction expectation. In contrast, when given a weak argument, participants who believed they would later interact with the partner displayed more positive implicit recycling attitudes, suggesting the importance of the social context. <b>AUTOMATIC</b> <b>RECYCLING</b> ATTITUDES 3 Reduce, Reuse, Recycle: Automatic attitudes toward recycling in interpersonal contexts As the importance of environmental protection and sustainability moves to the forefront of current concern and political agenda, the push to rejuvenate and spread the environmental movement has skyrocketed.

40|$|Abstract. Currently, {{software}} engineering is becoming even more complex due to distributed computing. In this new context, portability {{is one of}} the key issues and hence a cluster-aware Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that can transparently execute Java applications in a distributed fashion on nodes of a cluster, while providing the programmer with the single system image of a classical JVM, is really desirable. This way multi-threaded server applications can take advantage of cluster resources without increasing their programming complexity. However, such kind of JVM is not easy to design. Moreover, one of the most challenging tasks in its design is the development of an efficient, scalable and automatic dynamic memory manager. Inside this manager, one important module is the <b>automatic</b> <b>recycling</b> mechanism or garbage collector. This collector is a module with very intensive processing demands that must concurrently run with user’s application. It can consume a very significant portion of the total execution time spent inside JVM in uniprocessor systems, and its overhead increases in distributed garbage collection because of the update of changing references in different nodes. Hence, the garbage collector is a very critical part in distributed designs of JVMs, both for performance and energy. In this paper our contribution to automatic distributed garbage collection is two-fold. First, we have analyzed the barrier mechanism design space for the study of tracing-based distributed garbage collectors. Second, we have evaluated the impact of the most significative barrier strategies as main bottlenecks in global performance. Our preliminary results show that the choice of the specific technique used in barrier mechanisms produces significant differences both in performance and internodes messaging overhead...|$|E
40|$|In a {{world of}} growing {{population}} and increasing prosperity, the demand for new high-technology products is increasing together with the demand for rawmaterials. To {{be able to deal}} with the demand for new raw materials and the increasing amount of waste, the recycling industry needs to prepare itself to cope with these changes. If the waste can become the new raw materials, then the recycling industry has a bright future. The implementation of new ways to recycle products can be the solution to succeeding in this challenge. The objective of this research is to investigate, from a technical perspective, automation in the recycling industry. More specifically, the objective is to identify problems and solutions in the recycling of plastics and large liquid crystal displays in order to better cope with current recycling requirements. This research was inspired by the research methodologies of industry-aslaboratory, action research, experimental research and two concept development methods. The results related to the recycling of plastics come from a theoretical investigation of the possibilities for a plastic sorting facility. The investigation resulted in two concepts for recycling systems, implementable with today’s stateof-the-art technology and a more futuristic concept for sorting and separating the different plastics of interest. The systems are designed with standardised processes and are arranged in a flexible way to be able to manage with current industrial requirements. The results related to large liquid crystal displays include a clarification of the requirements for an <b>automatic</b> <b>recycling</b> plant, concept generation, and practical testing of different technologies. Two preferred processes for dismantle large liquid crystal displays are the circle saw and band saw. Additional results are the semi-automatic process structure to manage with current industrial requirements for large liquid crystal displays...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis is to {{determine}} whether Java, a programming language that evolved out of a research project by Sun Microsystems in 1990, is suitable for solving large sparse linear systems using direct methods. That is, can performance comparable to the language traditionally used for sparse matrix computation, Fortran, be achieved by a Java implementation. Performance evaluation criteria include execution speed and memory requirements. A secondary criterion is ease of development. Many attractive features, unique to the Java programming language, make it desirable for use in sparse matrix computation and provide the motivation for the thesis. The 'write once, run anywhere' proposition, coupled with nearly-ubiquitous Java support, alleviates the need to re-write programs {{in the event of}} hardware change. Features such as garbage collection (<b>automatic</b> <b>recycling</b> of memory) and array-index bounds checking make Java programs more robust than those written in Fortran. Java has garnered a poor reputation as a high-performance computing platform, largely attributable to poor performance relative to Fortran in its early years. It is now a consensus among researchers that the Java language itself is not the problem, but rather its implementation. As such, improving compiler technology for numerical codes is critical to achieving high performance in numerical Java applications. Preliminary work involved converting SPARSPAK, a collection of Fortran 90 subroutines for solving large sparse systems of linear equations and least squares problems developed by Dr. Alan George, into Java (J-SPARSPAK). It is well known {{that the majority of the}} solution process is spent in the numeric factorization phase. Initial benchmarks showed Java performing, on average, 3. 6 times slower than Fortran for this critical phase. We detail how we improved Java performance to within a factor of two of Fortran...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore how {{manufacturers}} can develop automatic end-of-life processes facilitated by product design methods, e. g. design for disassembly, recycling and remanufacturing. Also to illustrate this kind of product and end-of-life process development while maintaining economic and environmental values. Here, the cases of toner cartridges and liquid crystal displays are the focus. Design/methodology/approach – The research methodology for this paper began with a literature study within the fields of design for <b>automatic</b> <b>recycling</b> and remanufacturing. It also includes the research performed at two different industrial companies using automation in their end-of-life processes. These companies were visited and interviewed several times, in order to understand their processes and what current problems they have in automation and product design. Findings – Design implications on the end-of-life have been explored, and in particular, three general product trends are in conflict with automatic disassembly: products are getting more complex and more heterogeneous; products are getting sleeker; and products are using more proprietary joints. In addition, the three industrial cases describe different problems in industry and how they can be tackled. Although many manufacturers have adapted the design principles of DFM and DFE, there is still much to improve when it comes to designing for the product's end-of-life processes. These kinds of adaptations should increase in importance over time as more and more products and components are remanufactured and/or material recycled. These kinds of adaptations will also encourage an increase of products passing through more resource efficient end-of-life options. Practical implications – Manufacturers reading what design problems other companies are experiencing and what solutions can be found would facilitate their own businesses and willingness to start their own and/or improve their existing manufacturing business. This could then be in shape developing products for end-of-life processes which also would encourage them to start their own end-of-life process facilities. Social implications – From a societal perspective, an increase in remanufactured products being placed on the market can increase the awareness and confidence of the consumers in non-new products made from non-virgin materials. This will increase the market for second-life products and bring about economics of scale, which in turn will alleviate the problem of depletion of resources. Originality/value – Most previous research in this area treats the different end-of-life processes separately; material recycling and product remanufacturing are but two examples. However, in this paper the focus is more on the overall view of end-of-life processes, along with examples of more specific and detailed end-of-life processes, such as disassembly and cleaning. funding agencies|Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems (VINNOVA) ||Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research (SSF) ||</p...|$|E
40|$|At {{the federal}} level, the Civil Rules Advisory Committee {{has responded to}} the 2 ̆ 2 unique and {{necessary}} feature of computer systems [...] the <b>automatic</b> <b>recycling,</b> overwriting, and alteration of electronically stored information 2 ̆ 2 [...] with a proposed amendment to Rule 37. The proposed Rule 37 (f) would shield litigants from sanctions {{for the destruction of}} electronic data if the party 2 ̆ 2 took reasonable steps to preserve the information after it knew or should have known the information was discoverable in the action 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 the failure resulted from the loss of the information because of the routine operation of the party 2 ̆ 7 s electronic information system. 2 ̆ 2 The safe harbor provision would not apply if 2 ̆ 2 a party violated an order in the action requiring it to preserve electronically stored information. 2 ̆ 2 [ [...] . ] The shape and form of a safe harbor provision [...] or even the need for one [...] can only be understood by analyzing how courts have been addressing this problem in the absence of such a rule. Have courts sanctioned parties for conduct that is merely negligent, as opposed to willful or reckless? Have they insisted on a showing of prejudice before they will sanction parties for spoliation? Have parties generally deserved the sanctions they received? In an attempt to provide guidance to the legal community, we have surveyed recent written opinions on this topic to determine how courts have defined sanctionable conduct and what sanction has been imposed for such conduct. Our sample consisted of all the written opinions in the sanctions arena since January 1, 2000 : 45 federal cases, and 21 state cases. We included state cases in the sample because spoliation issues are not confined to federal court. We limited the sample to the twenty-first century because we believed recent cases would be the most indicative of whether courts had appropriately adapted to e-discovery issues caused by technological advancements. Although we are pleased to report that courts seem to be 2 ̆ 2 getting it right, 2 ̆ 2 our analysis is necessarily limited by our small sample and cannot be applied to sanctions cases generally. Because we could only locate and analyze written opinions, the sample is undoubtedly skewed in favor of cases granting sanctions. Many sanctions decisions are issued from the bench, and courts are less likely to issue written opinions when they are denying sanctions than when they are granting them. With those caveats in mind, we now turn to the substance of the survey. Part II of this Article summarizes the data gleaned from the cases, while Part III interprets the data. Part III also highlights representative cases in which sanctions were granted or denied and the reasoning behind those decisions. The Article concludes with a discussion of how our survey can inform the current debate on e-discovery reform...|$|E
