25|$|On June 23, the II Corps {{advanced}} to retake its lost ground, but the Confederates had pulled back, abandoning the earthworks they had captured. Under orders from General Meade, the VI Corps {{sent out a}} heavy skirmish line after 10 <b>a.m.</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> second attempt to reach the Weldon Railroad. Men from Brig. Gen. Lewis A. Grant's 1st Vermont Brigade had begun tearing up track when they were attacked by a larger force of Confederate infantry. Numerous Vermonters were taken prisoner and only {{about half a mile}} of track had been destroyed when they were chased away. Meade was unable to urge Wright forward and called off the operation. Union casualties were 2,962, Confederate 572. The battle was inconclusive, with advantages gained on both sides. The Confederates were able to retain control of the Weldon Railroad. The Federals were able to destroy a short segment of the Weldon before being driven off, but more importantly, the siege lines were stretched further to the west.|$|E

500|$|By contrast, {{the young}} Edward VI disliked Windsor Castle. Edward's Protestant beliefs {{led him to}} simplify the Garter ceremonies, to {{discontinue}} the annual Feast of the Garter at Windsor and to remove any signs of Catholic practices with the Order. During the rebellions and political strife of 1549, Windsor was again used as a safe-haven for the king and the Duke of Somerset. Edward famously commented whilst staying at Windsor Castle during this period that [...] "Methink I <b>am</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> prison, here are no galleries, nor no gardens to walk in". Under both Edward and his sister, Mary I, some limited building work continued at the castle, in many cases using resources recovered from the English abbeys. Water was piped into the Upper Ward to create a fountain. Mary also expanded the buildings used by the Knights of Windsor in the Lower Ward, using stone from Reading Abbey.|$|E

500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 17 October, two weeks after their arrival, Horatio and eighteen of his party were murdered in the deadliest massacre of settlers by Aborigines in Australian history. Tom was away from the property at the time, having been sent with two stockmen to collect supplies left en route to Cullin-la-Ringo. He returned several days later to a scene of devastation. Despairing and in shock, Wills first wrote to Harrison in Melbourne: [...] "... all our party except I have been slaughtered by the black's ... I <b>am</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> great fix no men." [...] Police, native police and vigilante groups from neighbouring stations swiftly tracked down and killed at least 70 local Aborigines; the total may have been 300. Wills took refuge near Cullin-la-ringo, and though he desired to avenge his father's death, {{there is no evidence}} that he joined the reprisal raids.|$|E
500|$|For the 1969 season, Rindt {{signed for}} the 1968 World Constructors' Champion Lotus, where {{he joined the}} {{defending}} Drivers' Champion Graham Hill. Rindt felt uncomfortable with the move, owing to the notorious unreliability of the Lotus car; in a twenty-month period between 1967 and 1969, the team was involved in 31 accidents. Hill alone had nine crashes between 1968 and 1970, which led him to joke: [...] "Every time I am being overtaken by my own wheel, I know I <b>am</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Lotus." [...] When Rindt joined Lotus, his friend and de facto manager Bernie Ecclestone, who had negotiated the deal, remarked that they were aware that Brabham {{may have been a}} better choice of team but the speed of the Lotus gave Rindt a chance to win the championship. Rindt commented: [...] "At Lotus, I can either be world champion or die." [...] Because of his uncertainty about the wisdom of joining the team, Rindt did not sign the Lotus contract until shortly before the 1969 Spanish Grand Prix.|$|E

I still <b>am,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> way, forced to believe it, but really, logically, I am sure that I can't be because of my un-masculinity." [...] She began seeing Robert Oppenheimer in 1936, {{when she was a}} graduate student there and Oppenheimer was a professor of physics at Berkeley. They met through his landlady, Mary Ellen Washburn, who was {{also a member of the}} Communist party, when Washburn held a fund raiser for communist-backed Spanish Republicans. The couple started dating and had a passionate relationship; he proposed to her twice, but she refused. She is credited with introducing Oppenheimer to radical politics during the late 1930s, and to people involved with, or sympathetic to the Communist Party or related groups, such as Rudy Lambert and Thomas Addis. They continued seeing each other after he became involved with Kitty Harrison, whom he married on November 1, 1940. Oppenheimer and Tatlock [...] spent the New Year together in 1941, and once met at Mark Hopkins hotel in San Francisco.|$|E

500|$|A {{few years}} later, Griswold {{moved back to}} New York City, leaving his younger {{daughter}} {{in the care of}} the Myers family and his elder daughter, Emily, with relatives on her mother's side. He had by now earned the nickname [...] "Grand Turk", and in the summer of 1847 made plans to edit an anthology of poetry by American women. He believed that women were incapable of the same kind of [...] "intellectual" [...] poetry as men and believed they needed to be divided: [...] "The conditions of aesthetic ability in the two sexes are probably distinct, or even opposite", he wrote in his introduction. The selections he chose for The Female Poets of America were not necessarily the greatest examples of poetry but instead were chosen because they emphasized traditional morality and values. That same year, Griswold began working on what he considered [...] "the maximum opus of his life", an extensive biographical dictionary. Although he worked on it for several years and even advertised for it, it was never produced. He also helped Elizabeth F. Ellet publish her book Women of the American Revolution, and was angered when she did not acknowledge his assistance in the book. In July 1848, he visited poet Sarah Helen Whitman in Providence, Rhode Island, although he had been suffering with vertigo and exhaustion, rarely leaving his apartment at New York University, and was unable to write without taking opium. In autumn of that year, he had an epileptic fit, the first of many he would suffer for the remainder of his life. One fit caused him to fall out of a ferry in Brooklyn and nearly drown. He wrote to publisher James T. Fields: [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> terrible condition, physically and mentally. I do not know what the end will be... I am exhaustedbetwixt life and deathand heaven and hell." [...] In 1849, he was further troubled when Charles Fenno Hoffman, with whom he had become good friends, was committed to an insane asylum.|$|E

Van Halen acknowledged the importance of super group Cream's [...] "I'm So Glad" [...] on Goodbye Cream to be mind-blowing.

2500|$|Thousands {{of young}} people between the {{participants}} in the Great National Gathering headed to Bucharest in the March of Stephen the Great (...) calling for the unification of Moldova with Romania. The march lasted a week, from 5 to 11 July. In the Republic of Moldova, the march followed the route Strășeni–Lozova–Călărași–Cornești–Ungheni. Participants crossed the Prut River, on 11 July, at 10 <b>a.m.,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> large-scale reenactment of the Bridges of Flowers in 1990. Their march ended in Bucharest, where were greeted by several hundred Romanian citizens in University Square, before making their way to the Cotroceni Palace to call on Romanian President Klaus Iohannis to support the unification project.

In a letter to European Parliament President Martin Schulz, released on 7 July, Voronin accused Bucharest of fomenting [...] "the destruction and annexation of Moldova".|$|E
