5|$|The stella octangula, <b>a</b> <b>{{compound}}</b> <b>of</b> two tetrahedra {{that appears}} in the upper right of Stars, also forms the central shape of another of Escher's astronomical works, Double Planetoid (1949). The compound of cube and octahedron in the upper left was used earlier by Escher, in Crystal (1947).|$|E
5|$|This {{classification}} {{is important}} in geochemistry. Minerals such as olivine, (Mg,Fe)SiO4 are classed as ultramafic; olivine is <b>a</b> <b>compound</b> <b>of</b> a very basic oxide, MgO, with an acidic oxide, silica, SiO2.|$|E
5|$|Names in English dialects are numerous. Scottish {{and north}} English dialects have {{included}} ka or kae since the 14th century. The Midlands {{form of this}} word was co or coo. Caddow is potentially <b>a</b> <b>compound</b> <b>of</b> ka and dow, a variant of daw. Other dialectal or obsolete names include caddesse, cawdaw, caddy, chauk, college-bird, jackerdaw, jacko, ka-wattie, chimney-sweep bird (from their nesting propensities), and sea-crow (from {{the frequency with which}} they are found on coasts). It was also frequently known quasi-nominally as Jack.|$|E

Regularities of activity change of filler interaction with lime depending on conditions of it's receiving are revealed. It is established, that using the mineral fillers in <b>a</b> <b>compounding</b> <b>of</b> dry construction mixes, leads to increase the functional properties of received coverings...|$|R

5|$|Proto-Germanic *xalja-wītjan (or *halja-wītjan) is reconstructed from Old Norse hel-víti 'hell', Old English helle-wíte 'hell-torment, hell', Old Saxon helli-wīti 'hell', and the Middle High German {{feminine}} noun helle-wīze. The compound is <b>a</b> <b>compound</b> <b>of</b> *xaljō (discussed above) and *wītjan (reconstructed from forms such as Old English witt 'right mind, wits', Old Saxon gewit 'understanding', and Gothic un-witi 'foolishness, understanding').|$|E
5|$|The {{two towers}} of Waterfalls {{impossible}} building are topped with compound polyhedra, one <b>a</b> <b>compound</b> <b>of</b> three cubes, {{the other a}} stellated rhombic dodecahedron known as Escher's solid. Escher had used this solid in his 1948 woodcut Stars, which also contains all five of the Platonic solids and various stellated solids, representing stars; the central solid is animated by chameleons climbing through the frame as it whirls in space. Escher possessed a 6cm refracting telescope and was a keen enough amateur astronomer to have recorded observations of binary stars.|$|E
5|$|The word mermaid is <b>a</b> <b>compound</b> <b>of</b> the Old English mere (sea), and maid (a girl {{or young}} woman). The {{equivalent}} term in Old English was merewif. They are conventionally depicted as beautiful with long flowing hair. As cited above, {{they are sometimes}} equated with the sirens of Greek mythology (especially the Odyssey), half-bird femmes fatales whose enchanting voices would lure soon-to-be-shipwrecked sailors to nearby rocks, sandbars or shoals.|$|E

5000|$|The {{generic company}} name is an ironic pun since the fictional company name Nologo is simply <b>a</b> <b>compounding</b> <b>of</b> the phrase [...] "No logo" [...] which {{describes}} {{the function of}} the brand as replacing and removing logos and brand names.|$|R
5000|$|Actinium {{fluoride}} (AcF3) is <b>an</b> inorganic <b>compound</b> <b>of</b> actinium and fluorine.|$|R
5|$|The Sanskrit name of Tulsidas can be transliterated in two ways. Using the {{original}} Sanskrit, {{the name is}} written as Tulasīdāsa. Using the Hunterian transliteration system, it is written as Tulsidas or Tulsīdās reflecting the vernacular pronunciation (since the written Indian languages maintain the vestigial letters that are no longer pronounced). The lost vowels are {{an aspect of the}} Schwa deletion in Indo-Aryan languages and can vary between regions. The name is <b>a</b> <b>compound</b> <b>of</b> two Sanskrit words: Tulasī, which is an Indian variety of the basil plant considered auspicious by Vaishnavas (devotees of god Vishnu and his avatars like Rama), and Dāsa, which means slave or servant and by extension, devotee. Tulsidas, which means a servant of the plant Tulsi.|$|E
5|$|The name Eboracum {{became the}} Anglian Eoforwic in the 7thcentury: <b>a</b> <b>compound</b> <b>of</b> Eofor-, {{from the old}} name, and -wic a village {{probably}} by conflation of the element Ebor- with a Germanic root *eburaz (boar); by the 7thcentury the Old English for 'boar' had become eofor. Alternatively, the word eofor already existed as an Old English word for wild swine, which is a cognate of the current Low Saxon word eaver and Dutch ever. The Anglo-Saxon newcomers probably interpreted the ebor part as eofor, and -rac as ric (meaning rich), while -um was (and is) a common abbreviation of the Saxon -heem, meaning home. To them, it sounded as a 'home rich in boar'. As is common in Saxon place names, the -um part gradually faded; eoforic. When the Danish army conquered the city in 866, its name became Jórvík.|$|E
5|$|The print {{depicts a}} hollowed-out {{compound}} of three octahedra, a polyhedral compound composed of three interlocking regular octahedra, floating in space. Numerous other polyhedra and polyhedral compounds {{float in the}} background; the four largest are, on the upper left, the compound of cube and octahedron; on the upper right, the stella octangula; on the lower left, <b>a</b> <b>compound</b> <b>of</b> two cubes; and on the lower right, a solid {{version of the same}} octahedron 3-compound. The smaller polyhedra visible within the print also include all of the five Platonic solids and the rhombic dodecahedron. In order to depict polyhedra accurately, Escher made models of them from cardboard.|$|E

5|$|The {{simplest}} {{case for}} computational chemistry is the gas-phase chemistry, {{in which a}} substance is treated {{as if it was}} a gas to eliminate the necessity of taking interactions between molecules in account. Research by multiple authors has been undertaken on dubnium pentachloride: it has been calculated to be consistent with the periodic laws by exhibiting properties of <b>a</b> <b>compound</b> <b>of</b> a d-block element. For example, the molecular orbital levels indicate dubnium uses three 6d electron levels as expected. One property dubnium pentachloride is expected to show is its increased (compared to its tantalum analog) covalence: a decrease in the effective charge on an atom and an increase in the overlap population (between orbitals of dubnium and chlorine).|$|E

50|$|The {{nickname}} VP-16 likely {{comes from}} <b>a</b> <b>compounding</b> <b>of</b> {{the last name}} {{of one of the}} chemists who performed early work on the drug (Von Wartburg) and podophyllotoxin.

25|$|In 1810, French {{physicist}} André-Marie Ampère {{suggested that}} hydrofluoric acid was <b>a</b> <b>compound</b> <b>of</b> hydrogen with an unknown element, analogous to chlorine. Fluorite was then {{shown to be}} mostly composed of calcium fluoride.|$|E
25|$|Gardermoen is <b>a</b> <b>compound</b> <b>of</b> {{the farm}} name Garder and the finite form of mo 'moor; drill ground' (thus 'the moor {{belonging}} to the farm Garder'). The farm is first mentioned in 1328 (Garðar), and the name is the plural of Norse garðr 'fence'. The meaning is probably 'enclosure; fenced fields'.|$|E

25|$|Iodine – Discovered by Bernard Courtois in 1811, {{he lacked}} the {{resources}} to investigate the substance but gave samples to various researchers. It was named by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac who thought it either <b>a</b> <b>compound</b> <b>of</b> oxygen or an element. A few days later Humphry Davy stated {{it was a new}} element leading to wrangling between the two over who identified it first.|$|E
25|$|Also a {{major portion}} of almost all magma is silica, which is <b>a</b> <b>compound</b> <b>of</b> silicon and oxygen. Magma also {{contains}} gases, which expand as the magma rises. Magma that is high in silica resists flowing, so expanding gases are trapped in it. Pressure builds up until the gases blast out in a violent, dangerous explosion. Magma that is relatively poor in silica flows easily, so gas bubbles move up through it and escape fairly gently.|$|E
