5|$|Bulker hulls <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> steel, usually mild steel. Some {{manufacturers}} have preferred high-tensile steel recently {{in order to}} reduce the tare weight. However, the use of high-tensile steel for longitudinal and transverse reinforcements can reduce the hull's rigidity and resistance to corrosion. Forged steel is used for some ship parts, such as the propeller shaft support. Transverse partitions <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> corrugated iron, reinforced at the bottom and at connections. The construction of bulker hulls using a concrete-steel sandwich has been investigated.|$|E

5|$|Although {{one might}} expect stylets to be fossilized since they <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> the mineral calcium phosphate, none have been found. As nemertea are {{otherwise}} completely soft-bodied, one would expect fossils {{of them to be}} extremely rare.|$|E
5|$|Bourekas are savory {{pastries}} {{brought to}} Israel by Jews from Turkey, the Balkans and Salonika. They <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> a flaky dough {{in a variety}} of shapes, frequently topped with sesame seeds, and are filled with meat, chickpeas, cheese, spinach, potatoes or mushrooms. Bourekas are sold at kiosks, supermarkets and cafes, and are served at functions and celebrations, as well as being prepared by home cooks. They are often served as a light meal with hardboiled eggs and chopped vegetable salad.|$|E
5|$|Ceriantharia {{comprises}} the related tube-dwelling anemones. Tube-dwelling anemones or cerianthids look {{very similar to}} sea anemones, but belong to an entirely different subclass of anthozoans. They are solitary, living buried in soft sediments. Tube anemones live and can withdraw into tubes, which <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> a fibrous material, which is made from secreted mucus and threads of nematocyst-like organelles, known as ptychocysts.|$|E

5|$|Cirrus clouds often produce hair-like filaments—similar to the virga {{produced}} in liquid–water clouds—called fall streaks, and they <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> heavier ice crystals that {{fall from the}} cloud. The sizes and shapes of fall streaks {{are determined by the}} wind shear.|$|E
5|$|Corrosion {{and heat}} {{resistance}} makes iridium an important alloying agent. Certain long-life aircraft engine parts <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> an iridium alloy, and an iridium–titanium alloy {{is used for}} deep-water pipes because of its corrosion resistance. Iridium is also used as a hardening agent in platinum alloys. The Vickers hardness of pure platinum is 56HV, whereas platinum with 50% of iridium can reach over 500HV.|$|E
5|$|Filler metals {{are also}} used in nearly all {{applications}} of GTAW, the major exception being the welding of thin materials. Filler metals are available with different diameters and <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> a variety of materials. In most cases, the filler metal {{in the form of}} a rod is added to the weld pool manually, but some applications call for an automatically fed filler metal, which often is stored on spools or coils.|$|E

5|$|Grills <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> {{several types}} of metal (often silver, gold or platinum) that are {{sometimes}} inlaid with precious stones; they are generally removable, though some may be permanently attached to the teeth.

5|$|In several cultures, {{goods for}} use in the afterlife are still interred or cremated, for example Hell bank notes in East Asian communities. In Ghana, mostly among the Ga people, {{elaborate}} figurative coffins in the shape of cars, boats or animals <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> wood. These were introduced in the 1950s by Seth Kane Kwei.|$|E
5|$|It has {{a unique}} method of {{capturing}} tent-making bats. It looks for roosting bats by looking for their tents (which <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> a folded leaf). When it finds a bat it climbs {{to a higher level}} and jumps onto the tent from above, attempting to dislodge the bat. If the fallen bat does not fly away in time, the monkey pounces on it on the ground and eats it.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} problem of {{identifying}} conditions under which a divergence free matrix field takes values in some prescribed sets of matrices K. We treat in detail the case when K <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> two or three matrices. Our results are parallel to those on curl free matrices. In that case Ball and James showed rigidity when K <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> two matrices and Tartar proved lack of rigidity when K <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> four matrices. For our problem we prove rigidity when K <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> two matrices and lack <b>of</b> rigidity when <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> three. We give examples when the differential constraints are yet of a different type and present some applications to composites. ...|$|R

50|$|Originally Cegléd jugs <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> {{galvanized}} tin. Later they <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> aluminium and steel, both {{bare metal}} and enamel-covered, typically of red, blue or white color. Despite the complicated shape, the jug (without handle) <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> a single metal sheet. For sturdiness, {{the mouth and}} bottom rims were doubly folded. The handle was attached by rivets.|$|R
5|$|Like the LP12, the Xerxes has a two-piece platter–sub-platter {{configuration}} {{on which}} sits a thin felt mat. And while the LP12's platters <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> mazak, the Xerxes' platters are of aluminium. The outer platter is rigid and peripherally weighted. However, the Roksan's outer platter weighs {{less than half}} of that of the LP12, to reduce load on the main bearing, yet is able to achieve a greater inertia because of its weight distribution.|$|E
5|$|Magnets <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> {{heavy metals}} such as manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, niobium, bismuth, praseodymium, neodymium, gadolinium, and dysprosium. Neodymium magnets are the strongest type of {{permanent}} magnet commercially available. They are key components of, for example, car door locks, starter motors, fuel pumps, and power windows.|$|E
5|$|Ottoman cuisine {{has given}} rise to the cuisines of modern Turkey, parts of the Balkans, Cyprus, and Greece. A {{distinctive}} element is the family of small flaky pastries called börek. These are popular and widespread across the Eastern Mediterranean region, and date as far back as ancient Roman times. Börek <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> thin sheets of filo pastry, filled with mixtures such as meat, caramelised onion and sweet peppers.|$|E

5|$|The bore {{evacuator}} and the gun's thermal sleeve, {{designed to}} regulate {{the temperature of the}} barrel, <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> glass-reinforced plastic, while the barrel has a chrome lining to increase barrel life.
