25|$|Takembeng mobilizations are {{the latest}} in a long history of female mobilizations in the Western grassfields of Cameroon. Sociologist Susan Diduk divides these mobilizations into three {{different}} periods (with prior forms continuing to exist in later periods). The first period of women exercising moral guardianship involved women in rural communities mobilizing to shame individuals who violated key community moral standards. A second period involved women from multiple communities connecting with one another to protest colonial and post-independence policies, primarily agricultural, from the 1950s on. Takembeng is the name for mobilizations which begun in the early 1990s and often took place with the opposition party to the government, the Social Democratic Front (SDF). Some sources claim that Takembeng is a long-standing practice in Ngemba communities <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not grow from the practices in the various communities.|$|E
25|$|The Interior, {{except for}} its screen, has more congruity; the tracery {{of the windows}} and the Gothic network of the roof bear one another company, and are only {{disturbed}} by the proportions of the whole, which have more of Trinity Chapel than {{is in keeping with}} the interior of a building in the Perpendicular style. This same roof, or rather ceiling, has given rise to much speculation, and in almost every book on the Chapel you find it stated that it came from St. Mary's College, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not fit the building. This, however, is true only in part. The facts appear to be these. The old Chapel of St. Mary's College possessed a fine open-timbered hammer-beam roof. When this was pulled down the roof was transported and housed, not in St. Mary's Churchyard, but in the College, under sheds, till the walls were ready to receive it. It was then put up over the new Chapel, one of the hammer-beams being secured with irons. The trusses were carefully spaced out to suit the windows and the length of the antechapel, which is so proportioned that it is equal, from east to west, to two bays of the Chapel itself, there being a very narrow strip over the organ, with a pair of brackets on either side, instead of one. This is not due to a misfit, but is intentional, otherwise the key of the vault at the centre of the bay would not come opposite the centre of the window. The brackets, which are all that can be seen of the old roof, do not come exactly in the centre of the piers between the windows, possibly because the windows are not opposite one another, or more probably because the old trusses had become distorted in moving.|$|E

500|$|Various {{authorities}} have treated the taxon {{as either a}} Boletus, Leccinum, or Tylopilus, depending on which morphological characteristics they deemed most significant. Rolf Singer initially considered the species most appropriately placed in Tylopilus {{on account of the}} reddish-brown spore print, a taxonomic opinion shared by Alexander H. Smith and Harry Thiers, who wrote [...] "Concerning whether or not the species should be placed in Leccinum, we can only say that the color of the stipe ornamentation is merely a reflection of the color of the stipe generally <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not change color in a characteristic pattern as it ages. For this reason we exclude it from Leccinum and agree with Singer that it is a Tylopilus." [...] Later however, Singer thought the somewhat scabrous ornamentation of the stipe justified a placement in Leccinum. René Pomerleau had previously (1959) placed the species in Leccinum, but this transfer was invalid, as no basionym was specified.|$|E
500|$|However {{federal judge}} William H. Pauley III in New York City [...] the U.S. government's global {{telephone}} data-gathering system {{is needed to}} thwart potential terrorist attacks, and that it can only work if everyone's calls are swept in. U.S. District Judge Pauley also ruled that Congress legally set up the program <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not violate anyone's constitutional rights. The judge also concluded that the telephone data being swept up by NSA {{did not belong to}} telephone users, but to the telephone companies. He further ruled that when NSA obtains such data from the telephone companies, and then probes into it to find links between callers and potential terrorists, this further use of the data was not even a search under the Fourth Amendment. He also concluded that the controlling precedent is Smith v. Maryland: [...] "Smith's bedrock holding is that an individual has no legitimate expectation of privacy in information provided to third parties," [...] Judge Pauley wrote. The American Civil Liberties Union declared on January 2, 2014 that it will appeal Judge Pauley's ruling that NSA bulk phone record collection is legal. [...] "The government has a legitimate interest in tracking the associations of suspected terrorists, but tracking those associations does not require the government to subject every citizen to permanent surveillance," [...] deputy ACLU legal director Jameel Jaffer said in a statement.|$|E

Natalie Wall from Cosmopolitan labelled the music video [...] "deliciously dark" [...] and likened the group's look in the video to that from their [...] "E.T." [...] performance on The X Factor in 2011. Promo News' David Knight positively reviewed the video: [...] "Sarah Chatfield makes an impressive return to British pop, by channeling a little bit of Sin City in her sassy and visually bold video for Little Mix's 'DNA': Sarah turns the X Factor-honed girls from glamourous pop stars into equally glamourous [...] stalkers in a noirish story of obsession." [...] Knight added, [...] "The 'DNA' video is beautifully shot by Will Bex, with stark contrasts, dramatic camera angles and heavy skies pushing the film noir-meets-comic book look". Lewis Corner from Digital Spy ranked the video eighth in his list of the ten best music videos from 2012, deeming it [...] "one of the most diva-worthy videos from a girl group in years".|$|E

Thus understood, human security would no longer be the vague amorphous add-on to harder edged areas of security such as military security or state security.' ...|$|E

Enda McCaffrey details a character who refuses to acknowledge his own agency, noting that Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) ignores repeated reminders that he doesn't have to behave as he does and suggesting that by relegating the lives of Carla and the gas station clerk to a coin toss, he hands [...] "responsibility over to 'fate' in an act of bad faith that prevents him from taking responsibility for his own ethical choices." ...|$|E
