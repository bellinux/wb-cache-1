5|$|Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) {{interviews}} {{for a job}} in Philadelphia, where she finds her potential manager, Mark (Bob Odenkirk), is remarkably like her former Dunder Mifflin regional manager Michael Scott. While this initially amuses her, Pam gradually realizes that the prospect of working under another Michael Scott is <b>abhorrent,</b> and her horror increases when Mark reveals that she is interviewing for a glorified receptionist's job. During a romantic dinner, Pam finally admits to Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) that even had the prospective job and boss been perfect she would not have wanted to take it, since she does not really want to move to Philadelphia, despite Jim having started his own business there.|$|E
5|$|On Earth, Nite Owl and Rorschach {{continue}} {{to uncover the}} conspiracy surrounding the death of The Comedian and the accusations that drove Manhattan into exile. They discover evidence that Veidt may be behind the plan. Rorschach writes his suspicions about Veidt in his journal, {{in which he has}} been recording his entire investigation, and mails it to New Frontiersman, a local right-wing newspaper. The pair then leave New York and confront Veidt at his Antarctic retreat. Veidt explains his underlying plan is to save humanity from impending nuclear war between the United States and Soviet Union by faking an alien invasion in New York City, which will annihilate half the city's population. He hopes this will unite the nations against a perceived common enemy. He also reveals that he had murdered The Comedian, arranged for Dr. Manhattan's past associates to contract cancer, staged the attempt on his own life in order to place himself above suspicion, and killed Moloch in order to frame Rorschach. This was all done in an attempt to prevent his plan from being exposed. Nite Owl and Rorschach find Veidt's logic callous and <b>abhorrent,</b> but Veidt has already enacted his plan.|$|E

25|$|In the {{continuation}} of the reading, Moses instructed that the Israelites were not to imitate the <b>abhorrent</b> practices of the nations that they were displacing, consign their children to fire, or act as an augur, soothsayer, diviner, sorcerer, one who casts spells, one who consults ghosts or familiar spirits, or one who inquires of the dead, for it was because of those <b>abhorrent</b> acts that God was dispossessing the residents of the land. The fourth reading ends here.|$|E
25|$|The label {{psychopath}} {{has been}} described as nonspecific but probably persisting because it indicates that the source of behavior lies in the psyche rather than in the situation. The media usually uses the term to designate any criminal whose offenses are particularly <b>abhorrent</b> and unnatural, but that is not its original or general psychiatric meaning.|$|E
25|$|We {{denounce}} as entirely untrue {{the allegation}} {{which has been}} made, that our church favors or believes {{in the killing of}} persons who leave the church or apostatize from its doctrines. We would view a punishment of this character for such an act with the utmost horror; it is <b>abhorrent</b> to us and is in direct opposition to the fundamental principles of our creed.|$|E
25|$|Outside of the Celestial Order, {{there are}} also the machine spirits of Autochthonia, {{unemployed}} gods whose domains have been usurped or destroyed, rogue gods who have abandoned their duties, and forbidden gods who have been exiled due to madness, an <b>abhorrent</b> nature or because they sided with the Primordials. Gods can generally only significantly increase their power by getting promoted or expanding their purview.|$|E

25|$|The Tainted – Where {{the other}} Nazgûl were slowly {{swallowed}} by the taint of their rings, the Tainted gave himself wholly and willingly to Sauron. Now all natural things rebel in his presence, vegetation withers, animals sicken and bold warriors cower. He is an abomination whose merest presence is poison to life, honour and hope. The Tainted {{is one of the}} Nazgûl, representing their withering, <b>abhorrent</b> nature. His mounted model is built to look as though his horse were sickened and dying by merely being near him.|$|E
25|$|To a large degree, {{the freedoms}} enjoyed by humans in the Culture are only {{available}} because Minds choose to provide them. Nevertheless, social convention {{within the community}} of Minds seems to make it impossible, as well as <b>abhorrent,</b> that these freedoms should be curtailed {{in a society that}} cares about the happiness of its members. The freedoms include the ability to leave the Culture when desired, often forming new associated but separate societies with Culture ships and Minds, most notably the Zetetic Elench and the ultra-pacifist and non-interventionist Peace Faction.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{regard the}} eternal {{punishment}} {{of those who}} fail to adopt Christian faith as morally objectionable, and consider it an <b>abhorrent</b> picture {{of the nature of}} the world. On a similar theme objections are made against the perceived injustice of punishing a person for all eternity for a temporal crime. Some Christians agree (see Annihilationism and Trinitarian Universalism). These beliefs have been considered especially repugnant when the claimed omnipotent God makes, or allows a person to come into existence, with a nature that desires that which God finds objectionable.|$|E
25|$|World War I {{was very}} {{difficult}} for White because of his Socialist values. War of any kind was <b>abhorrent</b> to his beliefs, and he struggled during this period about how to respond when so much of the country was engaged in supporting the war. His family life faced a crisis when his sons Maynard and Lewis enlisted in the Army. Lewis was quickly discharged due to a heart defect, but Maynard remained in the service {{until the end of the}} war. In addition, his colleague Karl Struss had been sent to a detention camp because of his German heritage.|$|E
25|$|A {{majority}} of the High Court, Brennan CJ, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ, found that the 1918 Ordinance required {{action to be taken}} {{in the best interests of}} the Aboriginal people and thus did not authorise genocide. Thus is, if genocidal acts occurred, they were beyond the power given by the 1918 Ordinance. Gaudron J went further and held that genocide was so fundamentally <b>abhorrent</b> that the Australian Parliament did not have the Constitutional power to make laws authorising acts of genocide. Her Honour was however the only judge to find a right to freedom from genocide.|$|E
25|$|Although Lenin found ethnic anti-Semitism <b>abhorrent,</b> {{the regime}} was hostile toward Judaism from the beginning. In 1919 the Soviet {{authorities}} abolished Jewish community councils, which were traditionally responsible for maintaining synagogues. They created a special Jewish {{section of the}} party, whose tasks included propaganda against Jewish clergy and religion. To offset Jewish national and religious aspirations, and to reflect the Zionist heritage within the Jewish intelligentsia of the Russian Empire (for example, Trotsky was first {{a member of the}} Jewish Bund, not the Social Democratic Labour Party), an alternative to the Land of Israel was established in 1934.|$|E
25|$|That project aims at {{registering}} {{a complete}} {{range of values}} with which people identify, {{to which they are}} attracted or which they reject as <b>abhorrent.</b> The notion of wisdom is explored as a way, an art, of dealing with value dilemmas. For instance, Complexity: understanding value systems is a text that looks at values through a positive interpretation, a negative interpretation, a paradoxical negative interpretation of the positive, and a paradoxical positive interpretation of the negative. Another text, Insights: wisdom and requisite variety, gives a list of several sources of wisdom which, in interrelation, may be required in a value system to ensure the long-term viability of a complex society.|$|E
25|$|In Ancient Rome, fellatio was {{considered}} profoundly taboo. Sexual acts were generally {{seen through the}} prism of submission and control. This is apparent in the two Latin words for the act: irrumare (to penetrate orally), and fellare (to be penetrated orally). Under this system, it {{was considered}} to be <b>abhorrent</b> for a male to perform fellatio, since that would mean that he was penetrated (controlled), whereas receiving fellatio from a woman or another man of lower social status (such as a slave or debtor) was not humiliating. The Romans regarded oral sex as being far more shameful than, for example, anal sex – known practitioners were supposed to have foul breath and were often unwelcome as guests at a dinner table.|$|E
25|$|In February 2016, Pacquiao, {{in a video}} {{statement}} {{posted by}} TV5, made a comment {{on the issue of}} same-sex marriage. Pacquiao, in vernacular, described people in same-sex civil marriages as behaving worse than animals because animals generally do not have same-sex mating. LGBT celebrities including comedian Vice Ganda, singer Aiza Seguerra, TV host Boy Abunda and the party-list Ladlad criticized the statements of the senatorial candidate. Pacquiao later apologized and stated that while, as a Christian, he is still against same-sex marriage, which is against Biblical teachings, and he did not condemn gay people themselves, saying that he loves them all and is praying for them. Nike ended their longtime partnership with Pacquiao stating his comments against gay people were <b>abhorrent.</b> The Grove at Farmers Market in Los Angeles also banned Pacquiao from the shopping mall.|$|E
25|$|In {{the seventh}} reading, Moses {{instructed}} {{that when the}} Israelites approached to attack a town, they were to offer it terms of peace, and if the town surrendered, then {{all the people of}} the town were to serve the Israelites as slaves. But if the town did not surrender, then the Israelites were to lay siege to the town, and when God granted victory, kill all its men and take as booty the women, children, livestock, and everything else in the town. Those were the rules for towns that lay very far from Israel, but for the towns of the nations in the land — the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites — the Israelites were to kill everyone, lest they lead the Israelites into doing all the <b>abhorrent</b> things that those nations had done for their gods. A closed portion ends here.|$|E
25|$|Wicked Priest: The Wicked Priest is the Teacher of Righteousness's main opponent, {{who also}} sought to kill the Teacher of Righteousness. The {{identity}} of the Wicked Priest is more clear {{than that of the}} Teacher of Righteousness, with scholars suggesting that he was a Hasmonean high priest such as Jonathan and Alexander Jannaeus. The Wicked Priest is referenced the most in the Commentary on Habukkuk, which states that the Wicked Priest was originally reliable, but once he became ruler he forsook God for riches and rebelled against God and committed <b>abhorrent</b> deeds. In the Commentary on the Psalms, the Wicked Priest sought to kill the Teacher of Righteousness for sending a law to him, some scholars have suggested that this law was 4QMMT. If the Wicked Priest was in fact Jonathan Jannaeus, then he met his own end in 142 B.C.E at the hands of Diodotus Tryphon, which would match well with the Habakkuk Commentary that comments on the terrible end met by the Wicked Priest.|$|E
500|$|Gore was [...] "dispirited" [...] {{after his}} return from Vietnam. NashvillePost.com noted that, [...] "his father's defeat made service in a {{conflict}} he deeply opposed even more <b>abhorrent</b> to Gore. His experiences in the war zone don't {{seem to have been}} deeply traumatic in themselves; although the engineers were sometimes fired upon, Gore has said he didn't see full-scale combat. Still, he felt that his participation in the war was wrong." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{thought the}} episode {{as a whole}} [...] "exemplifies just how {{powerful}} and emotive Doctor Who can be when writing, direction and performance are all harmonious and complete their own Ood-like circle", and was appreciative of the acting. The episode's only flaw was when Donna said [...] "Why do you say 'Miss'? Do I look single?", but was otherwise [...] "an extremely impressive, contemplative examination of the <b>abhorrent</b> nature of humanity".|$|E
500|$|The New York Posts Kyle Smith likened What Maisie Knew to {{a public}} service {{announcement}} about parenting and divorce and felt that {{the presentation of the}} story from Maisie's perspective was a [...] "gimmick" [...] (although it is true to James's novel). Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly found the film unoriginal, [...] "pointless and inert" [...] and awarded it a C grade. Slant Magazine Chris Cabin felt that the characters were one-dimensional and stereotypical, and described the film as [...] "an <b>abhorrent</b> slice of tasteless familial drama".|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{following}} his death, two of Carradine's former wives, Gail Jensen and Marina Anderson, stated publicly that his sexual interests included {{the practice of}} self-bondage. Anderson, who had plans to publish a tell-all book about her marriage to Carradine, {{said in an interview}} with Access Hollywood, [...] "There was a dark side to David, there was a very intense side to David. People around him know that." [...] Previously, in her divorce filing, she had claimed that [...] "it was the continuation of <b>abhorrent</b> and deviant sexual behavior which was potentially deadly." ...|$|E
500|$|Mississippi's governor, Hugh L. White, deplored the murder, {{asserting that}} local {{authorities}} should pursue a [...] "vigorous prosecution." [...] He sent a telegram {{to the national}} offices of the NAACP promising a full investigation and assuring them [...] "Mississippi does not condone such conduct." [...] Delta residents, both black and white, also distanced themselves from Till's murder, finding the circumstances <b>abhorrent.</b> Local newspaper editorials denounced the murderers without question. Leflore County Deputy Sheriff John Cothran stated, [...] "The white people around here feel pretty mad about the way that poor little boy was treated, and they won't stand for this." ...|$|E
500|$|The clerk {{then read}} the sentence, Hodgson records, [...] "in a most solemn and {{affecting}} manner, which bathed {{many of the}} auditors in tears". First, he damned the crime, [...] "as odious and abominable {{in the eyes of}} God as it is hateful and <b>abhorrent</b> to the feelings of man". He reminded the prisoner of the short time, [...] "a very short time", that remained for him to seek for mercy in another world, and then pronounced the sentence of death itself: [...] "You shall be hanged by the neck until you be dead, your body to be dissected and anatomized". The entire trial had lasted less than eight hours.|$|E
500|$|David Culbert {{notes that}} [...] "hose who have {{condemned}} Jew Süss as a lifeless production are presuming—understandably—a morally <b>abhorrent</b> film cannot possibly have redeeming artistic merit." [...] However, Culbert argues that, while one can understand such reasoning, {{it is actually}} a fallacy. He argues that those who dismiss Harlan as a [...] "loud-mouthed opportunist who could direct crowd scenes" [...] have failed to understand {{the structure of the}} script whose brilliance is due to Harlan rather than to his predecessors, Metzger and Möller. Culbert attributes much of the film's success to Marian's performance. He describes Marian as making use of [...] "techniques and gestures perfected in his stage portrayal of Iago (in Shakespeare's Othello)". According to Culbert, [...] "the construction of [...] plot owes much to Shakespeare." ...|$|E
500|$|Leader {{and founder}} of the Brotherhood, Magneto is a mutant Holocaust {{survivor}} who wages war against humanity in the name of mutant superiority. He has the ability to control and manipulate metal, making him {{one of the most powerful}} mutants. Well-known for his homosexuality, McKellen found a parallel of the cure with many prejudices: [...] "It's <b>abhorrent</b> to me, as it would be if a person said I need curing of my sexuality, or if someone said that black people could take a pill that would 'cure' them of being black." [...] McKellen's shooting schedule had to accommodate his work in both The Da Vinci Code and the London theatre, going as far as filming the actor in England to later superimpose into the Vancouver plates.|$|E
500|$|Digby unsuccessfully {{sought an}} {{audience}} with James to try and explain himself, in Fraser's opinion suggesting either that {{the extent of his}} involvement was limited, or that he was [...] "astonishingly naive and trusting of his sovereign's forgiveness." [...] While imprisoned he busied himself with writing secret letters, smuggled from the Tower and not rediscovered until Kenelm Digby's death in 1675. [...] Although he was fortunate not to suffer the fate of Guy Fawkes, who was tortured on several occasions, one of these letters hints that it had been [...] "in a fashion, offered". [...] He described his refusal to cooperate with his interrogators, boasted of his deceit, and how {{there was nothing he could}} do to make the plot appear less <b>abhorrent</b> to fellow Catholics. [...] Digby also carved an inscription on the wall of his cell, extant as of 1996.|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} heavily derided by critics. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard panned it as [...] "even more <b>abhorrent</b> than the song." [...] While {{acknowledging}} that the album's previous videos were [...] "excellent", {{he pointed out}} that the [...] "Hello Kitty" [...] video [...] "tries to do nothing. Its laziness is demonstrated in the first 21 seconds, during which Lavigne holds a plush stack of cupcakes, shakes her hips, stares at the cupcakes, bounces her shoulders, and then, when she sings the line 'Someone chuck a cupcake at me'... tosses the fake cupcakes at the camera, her lip movement not matching up to the backing track whatsoever." [...] Alexa Camp of Slant Magazine called it [...] "truly eyebrow-raising, taking cultural mis-appropriation to cringe-inducing levels." [...] The Independent suggested that [...] "'Hello Kitty' will make your eyes and ears bleed", while Jezebel wrote: [...] "It looks like what would happen if someone scraped off the diseased underbelly of American pop culture from 2004-2010 and sprinkled it generously over a festering pile of garbage." ...|$|E
500|$|Bauer {{said that}} {{nobody in the}} {{administration}} itself directly discussed the offer with Sestak, {{and he does not}} believe there was anything improper, illegal or unethical about the conduct. Republicans in Congress disagreed, arguing the action contradicted claims Obama made during his presidential campaign about ethical conduct and transparency in government. Darrell Issa, in particular, felt it was an impeachable offense and referred to it as [...] "Obama's Watergate". Nevertheless, the matter gradually became less of a focus during the primary election, where other topics like spending and the economy took the spotlight. With Issa poised to become chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform following the Republican Party recapturing the house during the 2010 midterm elections, it was widely expected he would launch an official investigation into the job offer based on his prior critical comments about the matter. However, on November 5, Issa announced he would not pursue an investigation. Some politicians and members of the media said that the job offer made to Sestak was neither illegal nor <b>abhorrent,</b> and that such deals are regularly made by politicians of all levels. Chris Cillizza of The Washington Post felt the matter only appeared to be a scandal because the White House badly mishandled the response, and Chicago Tribune writer John Kass wrote, [...] "Offering a spot to an ambitious young politician to protect an old servile weakling isn't new. Presidents do it, governors do it. Big-city mayors really know how to do it." ...|$|E
500|$|Other Christian critics {{wrote that}} Avatar has [...] "an <b>abhorrent</b> New Age, pagan, anti-capitalist worldview that {{promotes}} goddess worship {{and the destruction}} of the human race" [...] and suggested that Christian viewers interpret the film as a reminder of Jesus Christ as [...] "the True Avatar". Some of them also suspected Avatar of subversive retelling of the biblical Exodus, by which Cameron [...] "invites us to look at the Bible from the side of Canaanites." [...] Conversely, other commentators concluded that the film promotes theism or panentheism rather than pantheism, arguing that the hero [...] "does not pray to a tree, but through a tree to the deity whom he addresses personally" [...] and, unlike in pantheism, [...] "the film's deity does indeed—contrary to the native wisdom of the Na'vi—interfere in human affairs." [...] Ann Marlowe of Forbes agreed, saying that [...] "though Avatar has been charged with [...] "pantheism", its mythos is just as deeply Christian." [...] Another author suggested that the film's message [...] "leads to a renewed reverence for the natural world—a very Christian teaching." [...] Saritha Prabhu, an Indian-born columnist for The Tennessean, saw the film as a misportrayal of pantheism: [...] "What pantheism is, at least, to me: a silent, spiritual awe when looking (as Einstein said) at the 'beauty and sublimity of the universe', and seeing the divine manifested in different aspects of nature. [...] What pantheism isn't: a touchy-feely, kumbaya vibe as is often depicted. [...] No wonder many Americans are turned off." [...] Prabhu also criticized Hollywood and Western media for what she saw as their generally poor job of portraying Eastern spirituality.|$|E
500|$|Soap opera {{commentator}} Jenn Bishop {{said she}} {{found it difficult to}} explain Todd's popularity, and that if she is perplexed about her feelings regarding him, it is understandable that others would be as well. [...] "If I were to give a surface level assessment of Todd, I'd say he's an <b>abhorrent</b> character with little to no redeeming qualities," [...] she said. [...] "His actions, which span from the immoral to criminal, can be downright heinous. I wouldn't want to know Todd, let alone be around him in real life. Nor would I want any woman to have any sort of relationship with him." [...] Instead of seeing Todd as an antihero, she saw him as more of [...] "an anti-anti-hero" [...] and stated that what added to his appeal was that his rape storyline was authentic. [...] "While Todd is not the first (or the last) soap character to have committed this crime, the realness of this particular storyline didn't leave {{a lot of room for}} rewrites," [...] Bishop commented. [...] "For example, Luke's rape of Laura on General Hospital was rewritten and for years was referred to as a 'seduction.' There was no 'grey area'. This [...] could not be dismissed as simply the behavior of a romantic rogue." [...] To Bishop, the end result of this aspect, and that the writers had Todd generally pay for his crimes, [...] "was the development of a dynamic, unpredictable, multi-faceted character with many traits that conflict with one another" [...] and [...] "ll this makes for one messed up guy, intriguing to the viewers and one I can't help but like".|$|E
500|$|The scene between Sue and Roz was {{singled out}} by many reviewers. Bell wrote that she was [...] "really loving the feisty dynamic" [...] between them, {{and that it was}} [...] "about time that Sue had a proper {{sparring}} partner". Flandez called Roz [...] "the delightfully colorful synchronized swimming teacher", and said her [...] "scathing remarks were expertly delivered" [...] and that there were [...] "too many good lines to savor". Futterman said Roz reminded her of [...] "what an entertaining spitfire Sue was during season one", and that Sue is [...] "a shadow of [...] former self" [...] as evidenced by the fact that Roz has not been a victim of Sue's [...] "evil planning". Lynch described the encounter as [...] "one of the episode highlights", though he felt that [...] "the writers overdid it a touch" [...] when Sue [...] "barely got in any retorts" [...] against Roz. Reiter called Roz [...] "a great addition to the cast of characters" [...] and Leakes [...] "spot-on" [...] in the role, also hearkening back to the early Sue. Kubicek said he [...] "might like this subplot" [...] if Leakes did not mistake [...] "shouting for acting", and Slezak commented on Roz's [...] "particularly <b>abhorrent</b> assessment of Sue’s reproductive abilities". Votta, however, declared that the show [...] "should never let NeNe go", and said she [...] "delivers some of the best lines ever". Chaney and Slezak thought that Sue should have been fired immediately for requesting sperm donations from New Directions males, while Lynch merely deemed it a possible detriment to her tenure bid. Kubicek thought the pregnancy storyline should move forward [...] "because Sue becoming a mommy has comedic potential written all over it".|$|E
500|$|Aspects of Nelson's {{life and}} career were controversial, both during his {{lifetime}} and after his death. His affair with Emma Hamilton was widely remarked upon and disapproved of, {{to the extent that}} Emma was denied permission to attend Nelson's funeral and was subsequently ignored by the government, which awarded money and titles to Nelson's legitimate family. Nelson's actions during the reoccupation of Naples have also been the subject of debate: his approval of the wave of reprisals against the Jacobins who had surrendered under the terms agreed by Cardinal Ruffo, and his personal intervention in securing the execution of Caracciolo, are considered by some biographers, such as Robert Southey, to have been a shameful breach of honour. Prominent contemporary politician Charles James Fox was among those who attacked Nelson for his actions at Naples, declaring in the House of Commons I wish that the atrocities of which we hear so much and which I abhor as much as any man, were indeed unexampled. I fear that they do not belong exclusively to the French– Naples for instance has been what is called [...] "delivered", and yet, if I am rightly informed, it has been stained and polluted by murders so ferocious, and by cruelties of every kind so <b>abhorrent,</b> that the heart shudders at the recital... demanded that a British officer should be brought forward, and to him they capitulated. They made terms with him under the sanction of the British name. Before they sailed their property was confiscated, numbers were thrown into dungeons, and some of them, I understand, notwithstanding the British guarantee, were actually executed. Other pro-republican writers produced books and pamphlets decrying the events in Naples as atrocities. Later assessments, including one by Andrew Lambert, have stressed that the armistice had not been authorised by the King of Naples, and that the retribution meted out by the Neapolitans was not unusual for the time. Lambert also suggests that Nelson in fact acted {{to put an end to}} the bloodshed, using his ships and men to restore order in the city.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} first {{broadcast}} in the United States on NBC on Monday, September 21, 1998, in the 9:3010 p.m. (PST) timeslot. In its original American broadcast, the pilot tied with Working for forty-first place in {{ratings for the}} week of September 21–27, 1998. With a Nielsen rating of 8.6, equivalent to approximately 8.4 million viewing households, it was the fifteenth-highest-rated show on NBC the week it aired. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. Joyce Millman of Salon Entertainment said the episode has [...] "glimmers of class" [...] and the jokes are [...] "relatively sophisticated". John Carman of the San Francisco Chronicle commented that Burrows's direction was [...] "sharp as usual" [...] and the writing was [...] "above average". Brian Lambert of the St. Paul Pioneer Press said the pilot was [...] "nicely staged by veteran director Jimmy Burrows, and coming from a couple producers, Max Mutchnick and David Cohan, who assisted Boston Common and Dream On, the show – {{which is to say}} the pilot episode (everything could go to hell next week) – has the best verbal interplay of any of the season's new sitcoms." [...] William Horn from the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) thought the episode was a [...] "wonderful" [...] representation of a gay man's life [...] "regardless of whether he's in a relationship in that very moment. I think it's important that American audiences realize that lesbians and gay men are not simply all about sexual situations." [...] Ellen Gray of the Chicago Tribune was also positive about the show: [...] "For those who believe that Hollywood's engaging in a conspiracy to 'normalize' a sexual orientation that many Americans still find <b>abhorrent,</b> Will & Grace will look like a candy-coated poison pill. To those who think that Hollywood isn't moving fast enough in offering sexual parity for gays, it may just look like poison. But... there's a large audience out there that's somewhere in the mushy middle, an audience that might be ready to embrace Will & Grace." ...|$|E
