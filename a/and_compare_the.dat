25|$|Efficiency, like resolution, can be {{expressed}} in absolute or relative terms. The same units are used (i.e., percentages); therefore, the spectroscopist must take care to determine which kind of efficiency is being given for the detector. Absolute efficiency values represent {{the probability that a}} gamma ray of a specified energy passing through the detector will interact and be detected. Relative efficiency values are often used for germanium detectors, <b>and</b> <b>compare</b> <b>the</b> efficiency of the detector at 1332keV to that of a 3in×3in NaI detector (i.e., 1.2×10 −3cps/Bq at 25cm). Relative efficiency values greater than one hundred percent can therefore be encountered when working with very large germanium detectors.|$|E

Clinical diagnostic features indicative of Retinitis Pigmentosa include a substantially small and progressively decreasing visual area in the visual field test, and compromised levels of clarity measured during the visual acuity test. Additionally, optical tomography such as fundus and retinal (optical coherence) imagery provide further diagnostic tools when determining an RP diagnosis. Photographing {{the back of the}} dilated eye allows the confirmation of bone spicule accumulation in the fundus, which presents during the later stages of RP retinal degeneration. Combined with cross-sectional imagery of optical coherence tomography, which provides clues into photoreceptor thickness, retinal layer morphology, and retinal pigment epithelium physiology, fundus imagery can help determine the state of RP progression.|$|E

25|$|Committed to the project, Layton {{set out on}} his voyage {{across the}} Atlantic and hired George Ashdown Audsley, a Liverpool {{architect}} to design the gallery building. A local Milwaukee firm led by Edward Townsend Mix worked jointly with the British architect {{to carry out the}} construction. Layton was specific in his vision of the gallery and asked of Audsley: “Can we not have a building one story over a basement, about 80x100 feet, in the center of our ground that will look well?” The resulting design was a single-story top-lit gallery that differed from other American gallery designs of the period. Authors John C. Eastberg and Eric Vogel observe in their book, Layton’s Legacy, that the gallery design was directly inspired by the art galleries of Great Britain <b>and</b> <b>compare</b> <b>the</b> Layton Art Gallery’s floor plan, façade and elevations with institutions such as the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool, the Dulwich Picture Gallery of Greater London and the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge.|$|E
