25|$|Price <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> back to Panj-kiang {{to obtain}} extra food and water.... We had gone only five miles when we {{discovered}} {{that there was no}} more oil for our motor.... Just then the car swung over the summit of a raise, and we saw the white tents and grazing camels of an enormous caravan. Of course, Mongols would have mutton fat and why not use that for oil! The caravan leader assured us that he had fat in plenty and in ten minutes a great pot of it was warming over the fire. We poured it into the motor and proceeded merrily on our way.|$|E
2500|$|Having {{discovered}} acting at age 11 at the Waldorf school, Aniston {{enrolled in}} {{and graduated from}} Manhattan's Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, where she joined the school's drama society. Anthony Abeson was her drama teacher. She played The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window by Lorraine Hansberry and Three Sisters by Anton Chekhov. In 2015, she spoke about a childhood incident that led to her lifelong fear of water. She stated during a special event for her film Cake, [...] "I basically have a real fear of going underwater. I was a kid and I was riding this tricycle around a swimming pool <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> my tricycle into the swimming pool and I didn't let go and my brother tried to (help). So, I can't go underwater {{and no one will}} believe me. I honestly can't." [...] The incident led to filming a swimming pool scene 30 times on the set of the film with director Daniel Barnz before getting it right.|$|E
2500|$|I became {{terrified that}} I {{was going to}} be a full-time, bomb-throwing {{terrorist}} if I stayed [...] because it was the beginning of really bad times in America. It was '66–'67, it was the first police riot in Los Angeles.... In college my major was political science, so my brain worked that way.... <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> around this little English Hillman Minx—top down—and every night I'd be hauled over by the cops. Up against the wall, and all this stuff. They had this monologue with me; it was never a dialogue. It was that I was a long-haired drug addict living off some rich guy's foolish daughter. And I said, [...] "No, I work in advertising. I make twice as much as you do." [...] Which is a stupid thing to say to a cop....And it was like an epiphany. I suddenly felt what it was like to be a black or Mexican kid living in L.A. Before that, I thought I knew what the world was like, I thought I knew what poor people were, and then suddenly it all changed because of that simple thing of being brutalized by cops. And I got more and more angry and I just felt, I've got to get out of here—I'm a better cartoonist than I am a bomb maker. That's why so much of the U.S. is still standing.|$|E
60|$|Tom walked ahead, rifle on shoulder, then Polly Ann; <b>and</b> lastly <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> the two shaggy ponies, the {{instruments}} of husbandry we {{had been able to}} gather awry on their packs,--a scythe, a spade, <b>and</b> a hoe. <b>I</b> triumphantly carried the axe.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{am afraid}} I was seldom or never {{as good as}} I ought to have been, Pa. I made you carry me, over and over again, when you should have made me walk; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> often <b>drove</b> you in harness, when you would much rather have sat down and read your news-paper: didn't I?' ...|$|R
6000|$|And 'tis {{there the}} splendid churches is, and the fountains playing [...] grand, [...] And {{the palace of}} PRINCE TORLONIA, {{likewise}} the Vatican; [...] And there's the stairs where the bagpipe-men and the piffararys [...] blow. [...] <b>And</b> it's there <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> my lady <b>and</b> lord in the Park of Pincio.|$|R
60|$|Then Philippa <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> to town, Philippa {{asking me}} conundrums, like Nebuchadnezzar.|$|E
6000|$|... "On my {{way home}} that night my hansom knocked down an old man. He was not seriously hurt, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> him home. On the way {{he stared at me}} curiously. Every now and then he laughed--unpleasantly.|$|E
60|$|As before, the dervish made no difficulties, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> off my ten camels in triumph, only {{leaving him}} with twenty for his share. I had now sixty, and anyone might have {{imagined}} that I should be content.|$|E
60|$|Harold go to prison! My head reeled at the thought. I {{staggered}} {{out into}} the open air, and took my seat mechanically in the Maharajah's carriage. All London swam before me. After so many months' absence, the polychromatic decorations of our English streets, looming up through the smoke, seemed both strange <b>and</b> familiar. <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> through the first half mile with a vague consciousness that Lipton's tea is the perfection of cocoa and matchless for the complexion, but that it dyes all colours, and won't wash clothes.|$|R
6000|$|... "There!" [...] said Adeline. [...] "I didn't mean to let Mrs. Wilmington slip out; she can't {{bear the}} name, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> know it <b>drove</b> her away. But you mustn't let it worry you, father. I guess it's all going well, now." ...|$|R
5000|$|Das Yahoos—February 1987: Crawling {{from the}} swamp that had birthed Philadelphia’s fabled Sick Kids, the Yahoos put the rockin’ in rockin’ bones. They had just worked on an EP with Lux and Ivy of the Cramps {{producing}} and were itching to spread their batwings {{and let it}} rip. Gary <b>and</b> <b>I</b> also <b>drove</b> to the hoop to play some one on one and give a strong argument for 1970’s style tight fitting basketball shorts.|$|R
6000|$|... "How d'ye do, Annie?" [...] she drawled, in her tender voice. [...] "Won't {{you come}} in? You see I'm in possession. I've just got my new phaeton, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> up {{at once to}} crush you with it. Isn't it a beauty?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'The {{morning before}} his death,' replied his lordship, 'he {{came up to}} Birmingham by an early train, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> up from Brockelsby to see him. I got to the hotel at eleven o'clock and stayed with him for about an hour.' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{refrain from}} encumbering {{this part of}} my {{narrative}} with any detailed account of the little accidents, lucky and unlucky, which alternately hastened or retarded our journey home. Let me only say that, before midnight on the eighteenth, Oscar <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> up to the rectory gate.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Well, yes, he {{was here}} {{three or four days}} ago; he is a pretty liberal chap with his samples, I should say, for he always comes back with his cases empty.' Of course I hired the pony <b>and</b> trap. <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> through New Tilbury, Low Street, <b>and</b> Stanford. <b>I</b> put up there for three or four hours. At each place I went to all the public houses, <b>and</b> as <b>I</b> marked the liquors cheap I got several orders. I asked at every place had anyone in my line been round lately, and they all said no, and nobody had noticed the pony cart; but of course that did not prove that he might not have driven through there." ...|$|R
5000|$|I must {{compliment}} Ayrton {{because he}} pretty well second guessed every move I {{tried to do}} {{and he was very}} fair and he is entitled {{to do what he did}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think he <b>drove</b> fantastic and that's why he won the race I came a close second.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{continued}} the half-niece brightly. [...] "I came from Sacramento {{with some friends}} to Shootersville, <b>and</b> from thence <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> here; <b>and</b> though <b>I</b> must return to-night, I could not forego the pleasure of coming, {{if it was only}} for an hour or two, to answer the invitation of the uncle I have not seen for years." [...] She paused, and, raising her glasses, turned a politely questioning eye towards Mrs. Price. [...] "One of our relations?" [...] she said smilingly to Spindler.|$|R
60|$|She gave me {{a glance}} of warning, and I saw that the hall porter {{and one of his}} {{subordinates}} were somewhat unnecessarily near me. Then she glided away, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> off in my cab. Directly we had started, I tore open the envelope and read these few lines.|$|E
60|$|At {{three o'clock}} my dog cart was brought round and Cecil <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> away. We {{scarcely}} spoke {{until we were}} in the streets of Drayton, and then, rousing myself, I bade him pluck his spirits up, and assured him vaguely that I would see him through it somehow. He thanked me, but seemed very despondent.|$|E
6000|$|Then we {{took the}} trunk {{and put it in}} my wagon, and he drove off his way <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> mine. But of course I forgot all about driving slow on {{accounts}} of being glad and full of thinking; so I got home a heap too quick for that length of a trip. The old gentleman was at the door, and he says: ...|$|E
5000|$|Eric Idle, the sketch's {{original}} performer, {{reflected on}} the band's name in a 1999 performance: [...] I once wrote a sketch about rock musicians <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{was trying to think}} of a name that would be so silly nobody would ever use it, or dream it could ever be used. So I wrote the words [...] "Toad the Wet Sprocket". And a few years later, I was driving along the freeway in L.A., and a song came on the radio, and the DJ said, [...] "that was by Toad the Wet Sprocket", <b>and</b> <b>I</b> nearly <b>drove</b> off the freeway.|$|R
60|$|The driver <b>and</b> <b>I</b> coaxed {{him into}} the carriage, drove home swiftly, undressed him and put him to bed, where he waked next morning with a sore headache, very much ashamed. When his uniform was cleaned and dried, {{and he had been}} shaved and washed <b>and</b> made neat, <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> him back to barracks with his arm in a fine white sling, <b>and</b> {{reported}} that <b>I</b> had accidentally run over him. I did not tell this story to my friend's sergeant, who was a hostile and unbelieving person, but to his lieutenant, who did not know us quite so well.|$|R
5000|$|Economaki {{was born}} in Brooklyn, New York. Economaki’s father was a Greek {{immigrant}} and his mother a great-niece of Robert E. Lee. He saw his first race at age 9 at the board track in Atlantic City. He was immediately hooked on the sport. He once attempted driving a midget car at a cinder track in Pennsylvania. [...] "It wasn’t for me," [...] says Economaki. [...] "It was a really frightening experience. That was the first <b>and</b> last time <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> in competition." ...|$|R
6000|$|This {{seemed a}} fine {{commission}} for a lad of ten, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> my horses {{into the field}} that first morning with a manly pride which added an inch to my stature. I took my initial [...] "round" [...] at a [...] "land" [...] which stretched {{from one side of}} the quarter section to the other, in confident mood. I was grown up! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, not that. But he told {{me because}} he couldn't help it. We're old friends, and he was greatly disappointed. He sent me a line asking me {{to come and see}} him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> over to Lockleigh the day before he and his sister lunched with us. He was very heavy-hearted; he had just got a letter from you." ...|$|E
60|$|That {{evening the}} Story Girl <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> the cows to pasture after milking, {{and when we}} came home we sought out Uncle Blair in the orchard. He was sauntering up and down Uncle Stephen's Walk, his hands clasped behind him and his beautiful, {{youthful}} face uplifted to the western sky where waves of night were breaking on a dim primrose shore of sunset.|$|E
500|$|Despite the tone, Etty {{was pleased}} to be noticed by a {{newspaper}} as influential as The Times, and much later confessed how delighted he was that the [...] "Times noticed me. I felt my chariot wheels were on the right road to fame <b>and</b> honour, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> now <b>drove</b> on like another Jehu!" [...] Possibly {{as a result of}} the criticism in The Times, Freeling asked Etty to overpaint the figures in the foreground of Cleopatra. In 1829, after Etty had become a respected artist, Freeling allowed the restoration of the figures to their original condition.|$|R
6000|$|There were, however, disappointments, for now <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> long leagues through {{whirling}} snow or bitter frost only to {{find that}} Grace was not present, and it was on one of these occasions that I betrayed my secret to her aunt, Miss Carrington. She had been visiting an outlying farm, and though there were others upon whom the duty devolved I insisted on driving her home. In my case it was an inestimable privilege, for by good fortune Grace might be waiting to welcome her. I had been silent all evening, and when with a hissing beneath the steel runners and a rhythmic beat of hoofs we swept on under radiant moonlight, Miss Carrington made some jesting comment upon it. Perhaps the exhilarating rush through the cold, still air had stirred me into undue frankness, for I answered: ...|$|R
60|$|It {{had been}} raining in the afternoon, <b>and</b> as <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> up the avenue the mournful {{dripping}} {{of the rain}} from the dark trees accentuated the cheerlessness of the gloom. The vehicle in which I rode was a fly on three wheels, the fourth having apparently been broken and taken off, causing the fly to sag {{on one side and}} drag on its axle over the muddy ground, the fly thus moving only at a foot's pace in a way calculated to enhance the dreariness of the occasion. The driver on the box in front of me was so thickly muffled up as to be indistinguishable, while the horse which drew us was so thickly coated with mist as to be practically invisible. Seldom, I may say, have I had a drive of so mournful a character.|$|R
60|$|There {{were still}} some hours to spare {{before the last}} train left for London, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> back again in a fly from the Knowlesbury station to Blackwater Park, {{with the purpose of}} {{questioning}} the gardener and the person who kept the lodge. If they, too, proved unable to assist me, my resources for the present were at an end, and I might return to town.|$|E
6000|$|... "Senator Pendleton--Bessie's father. Just after I {{jumped into}} the mill-pond the {{telegram}} came {{for him to go}} to Washington, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> him home in my wet clothes. The old man had a terrible tongue, a whip-lash kind of humour, and he scored me for being a fool. But he rather liked me, on the whole. He told me if I'd only straighten out I could be anything, in reason." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{achieved}} {{the rest of}} our journey pleasantly, sometimes recurring to Doctors' Commons, and anticipating the distant days when I should be a proctor there, which Steerforth pictured in a variety of humorous and whimsical lights, that made us both merry. When we came to our journey's end, he went home, engaging to call upon me next day but one; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> to Lincoln's Inn Fields, where I found my aunt up, and waiting supper.|$|E
5000|$|In 1970, {{after college}} {{she moved to}} New York City and did some {{modeling}} work there, but no acting. Additionally, she said: [...] "In order to keep a roof over my head <b>and</b> to eat, <b>I</b> took any job I could get. I was a waitress, a bar maid, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> also <b>drove</b> an ice truck." [...] For both personal and professional reasons, she moved to Los Angeles {{around the end of}} 1970. There, at the suggestion of a friend, actress Carrie Snodgress, she auditioned at Universal Pictures, performing a scene from the film The Country Girl for talent head Monique James [...] - [...] Christine then received a seven-year acting contract from Universal Pictures -- [...] "a very precious commodity issued only to a chosen few." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{sister had}} told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of her geese for a Christmas present, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{knew that she was}} always as good as her word. I would take my goose now, <b>and</b> in it <b>I</b> would carry my stone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in the yard, <b>and</b> behind this <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> one of the birds--a fine big one, white, with a barred tail. <b>I</b> caught it, <b>and</b> prying its bill open, I thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach. The bird gave a gulp, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> felt the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop. But the {{creature}} flapped and struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the matter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered off among the others.|$|R
5000|$|The American {{art critic}} John Orr {{wrote in the}} Miami chronicle 1986 after the {{exhibition}} at the James Baker Gallery in West Palm Beach USA: [...] "This young man who is all truth and every fiber a passionate artist, I took {{him to see the}} Rauschenberg exhibition at Helander Gallery, for this is one of his mentors. I shall review this exhibition soon, but upon my first glance his pictures and collages seemed to contain a very gentle beauty that made [...] "my rebel" [...] Dellert appear as a Titan by comparison. Perhaps age is creeping upon me too quickly. I handed this meteor over to Bruce Helander <b>and</b> as <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> away <b>I</b> felt spent <b>and</b> weary, incapable and sterile. The little energy that remained within me was drained with humble admiration for an almost unknown artist whose place in the history of art is already reserved and waiting for him." ...|$|R
