5|$|Bond Street {{is a major}} {{shopping}} street in the West End of London. It links Piccadilly {{in the south to}} Oxford Street in the north and has been popular for retail since the 18th century, being the home of many fashion outlets that sell prestigious and expensive items. The southern section is Old Bond Street <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> northern section New Bond Street—a distinction not generally made in everyday usage.|$|E
5|$|However, {{these results}} {{also noted that}} the system might be able to work against longer-ranged missiles. Although these {{traveled}} at very high speeds, their higher altitude trajectories made detection simpler, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> flight times provided more time to prepare. Both projects were allowed to continue as research efforts, and were transferred to the US Air Force when that force separated from the Army in 1947. The Air Force faced significant budget constraints and cancelled Thumper in 1949 in order to use its funds to continue their GAPA surface-to-air missile (SAM) efforts. The next year Wizard's funding was also rolled into GAPA to develop a new long-range SAM design, which would emerge a decade later as the CIM-10 Bomarc. ABM research at the Air Force practically, although not officially, ended.|$|E

5|$|The Comet 4 {{was ordered}} by two other airlines: Aerolíneas Argentinas took {{delivery}} of six Comet 4s from 1959 to 1960, using them between Buenos Aires and Santiago, New York and Europe, while East African Airways received three new Comet 4s from 1960 to 1962 and operated {{them to the}} United Kingdom and to Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. The Comet 4A ordered by Capital Airlines was instead built for BEA as the Comet 4B with a further fuselage stretch of 38in (97cm) and seating for 99 passengers. The first Comet 4B flew on 27 June 1959 and BEA began Tel Aviv to London-Heathrow services on 1 April 1960. Olympic Airways {{was the only other}} customer to order the type. The last Comet 4 variant, the Comet 4C, first flew on 31 October 1959 and entered service with Mexicana in 1960. The Comet 4C had the Comet 4B's longer fuselage <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> wings and extra fuel tanks of the original Comet 4, which gave it a longer range than the 4B. Ordered by Kuwait Airways, Middle East Airlines, Misrair (later United Arab Airlines), and Sudan Airways, it was the most popular Comet variant.|$|E
5|$|When growing {{conditions}} improve, {{such as the}} arrival of warmer weather <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> days associated with spring in temperate regions, growth starts again. The expanding shoot pushes its way out, shedding the scales in the process. These leave behind scars {{on the surface of}} the twig. The whole year's growth may take place in just a few weeks. The new stem is unlignified at first and may be green and downy. The Arecaceae (palms) have their leaves spirally arranged on an unbranched trunk. In some tree species in temperate climates, a second spurt of growth, a Lammas growth may occur which is believed to be a strategy to compensate for loss of early foliage to insect predators.|$|E

25|$|Diazepam, as {{with other}} {{benzodiazepine}} drugs, can cause tolerance, physical dependence, substance use disorder, and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Withdrawal from diazepam or other benzodiazepines often leads to withdrawal symptoms similar to those seen during barbiturate or alcohol withdrawal. The higher the dose <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> the drug is taken, the greater the risk of experiencing unpleasant withdrawal symptoms.|$|E

25|$|The dash is a {{punctuation}} {{mark that}} is similar in appearance to a hyphen or minus sign, but differs from both of these symbols primarily in length and function. The most common versions of the dash are the en dash (–) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> em dash (—), whose names historically were loosely related with {{the length of a}} lower-case n and upper-case M, respectively, in commonly used typefaces.|$|E

25|$|There exist {{infinitely}} many Pythagorean triples {{in which}} the hypotenuse <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> of the two legs differ by exactly one (such triples are necessarily primitive). One method to generate such triples is the relation (2n+1)2 + 2 = 2, leading to triples (3,4,5), (5,12,13), (7,24,25), etc. More generally, for every odd integer j, there exist infinitely many primitive Pythagorean triples {{in which the}} hypotenuse and the even leg differ by j2.|$|E
25|$|Chlordiazepoxide {{can cause}} {{physical}} dependence {{and what is}} known as the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Withdrawal from chlordiazepoxide or other benzodiazepines often leads to withdrawal symptoms that are similar to those seen with alcohol and barbiturates. The higher the dose <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> the drug is taken, the greater the risk of experiencing unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms can, however, occur at standard dosages and also after short-term use. Benzodiazepine treatment should be discontinued as soon as possible through a slow and gradual dose-reduction regime.|$|E

25|$|By {{the late}} 1950s the {{problems}} with urban sprawl were becoming evident in the United States. When cities improved roads and the transit times were lowered, suburbs developed at ever increasing distances from the city cores, and people {{moved out of the}} downtown areas. Lacking pollution control systems, the rapid rise in car ownership <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> trips to and from work were causing significant air quality problems. Additionally, movement to the suburbs led to a flight of capital from the downtown areas, one cause of the rapid urban decay seen in the US.|$|E

25|$|The Pure Land sutras are principally the Shorter Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra, Longer Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra, and the Amitāyurdhyāna Sūtra. The shorter sutra is {{also known}} as the Amitābha Sūtra, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> sutra {{is also known}} as the Infinite Life Sūtra. These sutras {{describe}} Amitābha and his Pure Land of Bliss, called Sukhāvatī. Also related to the Pure Land tradition is the Pratyutpanna Samādhi Sūtra, which describes the practice of reciting the name of Amitābha Buddha as a meditation method. In addition to these, many other Mahayana texts also feature Amitābha Buddha, and a total of 290 such works have been identified in the Taishō Tripiṭaka.|$|E
