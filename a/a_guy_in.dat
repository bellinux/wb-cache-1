500|$|It wasn’t as hard as, say, {{running around}} with all my gear on in Jarhead. I’d rather go for an awkward moment than {{physical}} exertion any day.

500|$|When Mears went to {{audition}} for the role, he was asked, [...] "Why do we need an actor {{as opposed to just}} <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>in</b> a mask?" [...] Mears said portraying Jason is similar to Greek Mask Work, in which the mask and the actor are separate entities, and depending on the scene, there will be various combinations of mask and actor in the performance. Mears said the energy from the actor's thoughts will be picked up by the camera. He compared his experience behind the camera to a stock car race: he is the driver and the effects team is his pit crew. As he performs, the effects team subtly suggest ways he can give the character more life on camera.|$|E
500|$|The rock monster {{climax of}} the film was {{ultimately}} dropped due to difficulties during filming. The monster, dubbed the Rockman, was a large latex rubber suit that breathed fire on command. Effects personnel smoked cigarettes and blew smoke into the suit's tubing, loading it with smoke that it would slowly emit, obscuring some obvious rubber parts. On {{the last day of}} location shooting, the Rockman began suffering mechanical problems; the suit stopped breathing fire, and the desert wind dissipated the smoke. The result, Shatner wrote, was that [...] "our guy in the silly rubber suit ultimately just looked like... well, <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>in</b> a silly rubber suit." [...] With no time to return to the location, Shatner was forced to get wide shots and hope that the setting could be reproduced in the studio, but admitted that it was likely it was not going to work for the film.|$|E

[...] All About Soap said Charlie and Darryl's chemistry was [...] "clear for everyone to see" [...] and wondered when she would stop hiding behind her [...] "law-abiding facade". When Charlie and Darryl share their [...] "steamy moment", Erin Miller of TV Week said [...] "It was the moment we've all been waiting for." [...] In 2012, Stephen questioned whether there was another police officer who has had [...] "such a difficult life as Charlie". She said she transformed from [...] "lesbian to gangster's moll" [...] and opined that her life continued to [...] "spiral out of control".|$|E
500|$|... "This Kiss" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics, who {{compared it to}} [...] "Call Me Maybe" [...] and [...] "Good Time". However, it failed to match the success of her previous singles, only reaching the top three in on the Ultratip chart of Belgium (Flanders) and in South Korea, while missing the top ten {{in countries such as}} Canada and United Kingdom. In the United States, the song peaked at 86 on the Billboard Hot 100 prior to its single release, and at number 37 on Pop Songs. An accompanying music video was released on October 26, 2012, at the Fun Size film premiere, portrays Jepsen flirting with <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>in</b> the club.

Spears references The Notorious B.I.G.'s hit [...] "Hypnotize" [...] in [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] in the line [...] "You must be B.I.G. because you got me Hypnotized". Spears' vocals on [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] were deemed as [...] "robotic", but similar to the ones of [...] "Oops!... I Did It Again" [...] (2000). Jocelyn Vena of MTV noted the singer uses her deep vocals in lines such as [...] "And, yeah, your body looks so sick, I think I caught the flu" [...] and [...] "You must be B.I.G.

Harvard and Brown were the only teams that guaranteed him a spot on their basketball teams, but Ivy League schools do not offer athletic scholarships. Rex Walters, University of San Francisco men's basketball coach and retired NBA player, said NCAA limits on coaches' recruiting visits had reduced Lin's chances. [...] "Most colleges start recruiting <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>in</b> the first five minutes they see him because he runs really fast, jumps really high, does the quick, easy thing to evaluate," [...] Walters said.

500|$|In Game 6 of the series, the Express led by {{four points}} {{by the end}} of the first quarter, but the Rainmen responded with a 21–9 run and led by 12 points at halftime.

The Express kept it close in the final minutes of the game and held Halifax off to win the contest, 119–112, forcing a decisive Game 7. Quinnel Brown led the way for Windsor with 30 points, 16 of them off free throws. After the game, Rainmen head coach Josep Clarós expressed his unhappiness with the calls made by the referees against his team. Clarós said that rather than protesting to the league, he would [...] "send film to FIBA." [...] He commented on the officiating, [...] "It's ridiculous for a final of a professional league in Canada." [...] An anonymous referee later denounced the league's policy regarding player fines and suspensions. He said, [...] "So you could have a guy punch <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>in</b> the face in Game 1, get kicked out, and be playing in Game 2." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{signing with}} the label, Bemis began writing songs for his band's Doghouse debut. [...] Bemis {{went into the}} studio with Florida {{producer}} Paul Trust. [...] They recorded 3 songs that were not released although {{one of the songs}} entitled [...] "Spider Song" [...] would later appear on a Doghouse compilation. [...] With tremendous self-created pressure, he threw himself into pushing the sonic boundaries of the band and maturing their sound, incorporating elements of math-rock, indie-pop and theatrical pomp. He and Linder also started the search for a producer. The two met several producers but eventually decided on Tim O'Heir and Stephen Trask. Bemis struggled with different ideas for the record and decided the album should focus on [...] "the artistic struggle, the fact that every creative person has this sick ambition to affect some sort of change in society with their art, to be more than just <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>in</b> a band or a poet or a sculptor." [...] Bemis originally intended the album to be a rock opera with a full script, narration, and a cast of characters. It was tentatively titled Zona! Zona! However, Bemis became overwhelmed by the entire process of writing and playing most of the instruments and had a breakdown.|$|E

[...] The writers considered including Hawkeye, but [...] "he didn't have enough to do and suddenly it seemed like we were giving him short shrift", leading all of his parts to be fulfilled by Black Widow, and Joe Russo added that Jeremy Renner's schedule could not be worked out for him to appear. As to why the Red Skull from The First Avenger did not appear in The Winter Soldier, Joe Russo explained, [...] "I know we have <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>in</b> a computer, but the tone we were chasing was sort of that conspiracy thriller. And we wanted to try and ground the movie as much as we could. And Red Skull, he's a fantastical character and didn't necessarily fit for Cap 2 and especially because it was about the fall of S.H.I.E.L.D. Certainly Hydra exists and that's his legacy, but there's something interesting about the fact that his legacy outlived the skull. And they're still dealing with the demons of it, but not necessarily him." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{learning}} of Kurt’s ignorance of sexual matters, Blaine visits Kurt's father, Burt (Mike O'Malley), and prompts {{him to give}} Kurt [...] "the talk" [...] about sex.

At a subsequent group meeting, Kurt arrives late and announces that the group's mascot canary is dead; he sings [...] "Blackbird" [...] {{in honor of the}} bird. While Kurt is singing, Blaine has a revelation, and later tells Kurt that he reciprocates his feelings and kisses him. At Regionals, the two sing a duet of [...] "Candles" [...] by Hey Monday. The Warblers lose to New Directions, but while Kurt is very disappointed, Blaine tells him that even though they lost, in reality, they won each other which makes losing Regionals worth it. After Kurt transfers back to McKinley, he invites Blaine to be his date at his junior prom in [...] "Prom Queen"; both are shocked when Kurt wins Prom Queen due to having received an overwhelming number of unwanted write-in votes in the secret balloting. Karofsky, the Prom King, leaves to avoid dancing with <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>in</b> the traditional dance between King and Queen, and Kurt dances with Blaine instead. After Kurt returns from Nationals in New York, he and Blaine admit their love for one another.|$|E
500|$|The film {{takes place}} {{simultaneously}} with {{the events of}} The Incredible Hulk and Iron Man 2, the latter of which is set {{six months after the}} events of Iron Man, Clark Gregg, who appeared in Iron Man and Iron Man 2 as S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson, reprised the role in Thor. About his role in Thor he stated, [...] "Agent Coulson was one of the guys who wasn't really in the comic books, and he [...] a very kind of small role in Iron Man. And I was just very lucky that they chose to expand that character and [...] to put him more into the universe of it." [...] After signing on to appear as Clint Barton / Hawkeye in The Avengers, Jeremy Renner made a cameo appearance as the character during a scene in Thor. Branagh said that they [...] "were always going to have <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>in</b> a basket above the action where Thor breaks in the S.H.I.E.L.D. camp", and that he was thrilled when the producers told him they wanted to use Renner's Hawkeye for that role. The film ends with a post-credits scene featuring Loki, watching as Erik Selvig and Nick Fury discuss the Tesseract. The scene was directed by Joss Whedon, who directed The Avengers. Stellan Skarsgård, who played Selvig, said the scene was not included when he first read the screenplay for Thor, and that he was sent pages for the scene after agreeing to appear in The Avengers.|$|E
