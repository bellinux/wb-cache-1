There is no rule in organized baseball prohibiting their participation <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>has</b> been to my knowledge. If Durocher, or if any other manager, or all of them, want to sign one, or twenty-five Negro players, it is all right with me. That is the business of the managers and the club owners. The business of the commissioner is to interpret the rules of baseball, and to enforce them.|$|E

25|$|The {{layout of}} the gojūon table {{promotes}} a systematic view of kana syllabograms as being always pronounced with the same single consonant followed by a vowel, {{but this is not}} exactly the case (<b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>has</b> been). Existing schemes for the romanization of Japanese either are based on the systematic nature of the script, e.g. nihon-siki チ ti, or they apply some Western graphotactics, usually the English one, to the common Japanese pronunciation of the kana signs, e.g. Hepburn-shiki チ chi. Both approaches conceal the fact, though, that many consonant-based katakana signs, especially those canonically ending in u, can be used in coda position, too, where the vowel is unvoiced and therefore barely perceptible.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the first}} {{performance}} of Trial by Jury were uniformly glowing. [...] Fun magazine declared the opera [...] "extremely funny and admirably composed", while the rival Punch magazine wrote that it [...] "is the funniest bit of nonsense your representative has seen for a considerable time", only regretting {{that it was too}} short. [...] The Daily News praised the author: [...] "In whimsical invention and eccentric humour Mr. W. S. Gilbert has no living rival among our dramatic writers, <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>has</b> his peculiar vein of drollery and satire been more conspicuous than in a little piece entitled Trial by Jury". [...] The Daily Telegraph concluded that the piece illustrated the composer's [...] "great capacity for dramatic writing of the lighter class". [...] Many critics emphasised the happy combination of Gilbert's words and Sullivan's music. [...] One noted that [...] "so completely is each imbued with the same spirit, that it would be as difficult to conceive the existence of Mr. Gilbert's verses without Mr. Sullivan's music, as of Mr. Sullivan's music without Mr. Gilbert's verses. [...] Each gives each a double charm." [...] Another agreed that [...] "it seems, as in the great Wagnerian operas, as though poem and music had proceeded simultaneously from one and the same brain." ...|$|E

2500|$|... 2D {{synchronous}} and asynchronous spectra {{are basically}} 3D-datasets and are generally represented by contour plots. X- and y-axes are {{identical to the}} x-axis of the original dataset, whereas the different contours represent the magnitude of correlation between the spectral intensities. The 2D synchronous spectrum is symmetric relative to the main diagonal. The main diagonal thus contains positive peaks. As the peaks at (x,y) in the 2D synchronous spectrum are a measure for {{the correlation between the}} intensity changes at x and y in the original data, these main diagonal peaks are also called autopeaks and the main diagonal signal is referred to as autocorrelation signal. The off-diagonal cross-peaks can be either positive or negative. On the other hand, the asynchronous spectrum is asymmetric <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>has</b> peaks on the main diagonal.|$|E
2500|$|Speaking to Empire, {{director}} Tyldum {{expressed his}} decision {{to take on the}} project: [...] "It is such a complex story. It was the gay rights element, but also how his (Turing's) ideas were kept secret and how incredibly important his work was during the war, that he was never given credit for it". In an interview for GQ UK, Matthew Goode, who plays fellow cryptographer Hugh Alexander in the film, stated that the script focuses on [...] "Turing's life and how as a nation we celebrated him as being a hero by chemically castrating him because he was gay". The producers of the film stated: [...] "There is not – <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>has</b> been – a version of our script where Alan Turing is anything other than homosexual, nor have we included fictitious sex scenes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many experts {{argue that}} even consensual sexual {{interactions}} {{between students and}} teachers constitute sexual harassment. The most commonly expressed concern is over whether [...] "mutual consent" [...] can exist in a relationship where {{there is such a}} disparity in power between the people involved. Because of this, more and more schools are adopting policies that forbid amorous relationships between students and professors [...] "in the instructional context" [...] even when they are consenting (Smithson, 1990). [...] Dzeich et al. writes: [...] "Physical intimacy with students is not now <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>has</b> been acceptable behavior for academicians. [...] It cannot be defended or explained away by evoking fantasies of devoted professors and sophisticated students being denied the right to 'true love.'

2500|$|Dorothy and Pound {{moved into}} an {{apartment}} at 5Holland Place, with Hilda Doolittle, recently married to Richard Aldington, living in the adjacent apartment. Hilda was shocked and hurt when Pound married Dorothy, and even more shocked to find he rented the apartment opposite at Holland Place. [...] She and Dorothy were not on friendly terms, with Hilda writing of her, [...] "she is unbearably critical <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>has</b> been known to make a warm friend with a man or woman. She loathes (she says) children! However {{that may be a}} little pose. She is a bit addictive to little mannerisms. I don't think she can be poignantly sensitive or she would never have stuck Ezra". When Dorothy came to in the small apartment she refused to cook—ever. In fact, she never cooked until she was to forced to during World War II. Pound cooked in the larger room and worked in a small better-lit room. He made furniture for the apartment where they stayed until 1919.|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to other universities of the day, at which one could study in either medicine, law, or divinity, the first {{students at the}} University of Virginia could study in one or several of eight independent schools – medicine, law, mathematics, chemistry, ancient languages, modern languages, natural philosophy, and moral philosophy. Another innovation of the new university was that higher education would be separated from religious doctrine. UVA had no divinity school, was established independently of any religious sect, and the Grounds were planned and centered upon a library, the Rotunda, rather than a church, distinguishing it from peer universities still primarily functioning as seminaries for one particular strain of Protestantism or another. Jefferson opined to philosopher Thomas Cooper that [...] "a professorship of theology should {{have no place in}} our institution", <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>has</b> there been one. There were initially two degrees awarded by the university: Graduate, to a student who had completed the courses of one school; and Doctor to a graduate in more than one school who had shown research prowess.|$|E

2500|$|Through Manchukuo {{itself was}} a product of {{illegality}} with the League of Nations ruling that Japan had broken international law by seizing Manchuria, the Japanese invested much effort into giving Manchukuo a legal system, believing that this was the fastest way for international recognition of Manchukuo. A particular problem for the Japanese was that Manchukuo was always presented as a new type of state: a multi-ethnic Pan-Asian state comprising Japanese, Koreans, Manchus, Mongols and Chinese to mark the birth of the [...] "New Order in Asia". Typical of the rhetoric surrounding Manchkuo was always portrayed as the birth of a glorious new civilization was the press release issued by the Japanese Information Service on 1 March 1932 announcing the [...] "glorious advent" [...] of Manchukuo with the [...] "eyes of the world turned on it" [...] proclaimed that the birth of Manchukuo was an [...] "epochal event of far-reaching consequences in world history, marking the birth of a new era in government, racial relations, and other affairs of general interest.

Puyi believed Manchukuo was just the beginning, {{and within a few}} years time, he would once again reign as the Emperor of China, having the yellow Imperial Dragon robes used for coronation of Qing emperors brought from Beijing to Changchun. At the time, Japanese propaganda depicted the birth of Manchukuo as a triumph of Pan-Asian feelings with the [...] "five races" [...] of Japanese, Chinese, Koreans, Manchus and Mongols coming together, which marked nothing less than the birth of a new civilization and a turning point in world history.
