5|$|Alcibiades was {{a leading}} {{supporter}} of the Sicilian Expedition, and scholars have argued that, had that expedition been under Alcibiades's command instead of that of Nicias, the expedition might not have met its eventual disastrous fate. In the years when he served Sparta, Alcibiades {{played a significant role}} in Athens's undoing; the capture of Decelea and the revolts of several critical Athenian subjects occurred either at his suggestion or under his supervision. Once restored to his native city, however, he played a crucial role in a string of Athenian victories that eventually brought Sparta to seek a peace with Athens. He favored unconventional tactics, frequently winning cities over by treachery or negotiation rather than by siege. Alcibiades's military and political talents frequently proved valuable to whichever state currently held his allegiance, but his propensity for making powerful enemies ensured that he never remained in one place for long; and by the end of the war which he had helped to rekindle in the early 410s, his days of political relevance were <b>a</b> <b>bygone</b> memory.|$|E
5|$|In {{selecting}} Ved Vejen for the Danish Culture Canon, {{the selection}} committee {{operating under the}} Danish Ministry of Culture explained that the attraction {{of the novel is}} that it portrays with considerable empathy how a meek young woman becomes increasingly aware of desires she hardly knew she possessed. With bittersweet irony, the author allows Katinka to develop her infatuation by listening to the heartaches of others. With its almost cinematic sequences, the novel conveys a balance between its subdued humour and a strong sympathy for what goes on in people's minds, especially in a secluded environment removed from mainstream society. It is not just Bang's portrayal of <b>a</b> <b>bygone</b> provincial world that seems so typically Danish but his mastery in making the hidden pain of loneliness so meaningful to today's readership. In 1988 it was made into a feature film Katinka, directed by Max von Sydow, starring Tammi Øst as Katinka.|$|E
5|$|Major {{developments}} in 19th-century Welsh literature include Lady Charlotte Guest's {{translation of the}} Mabinogion, {{one of the most}} important medieval Welsh prose tales of Celtic mythology, into English. 1885 saw the publication of Rhys Lewis by Daniel Owen, credited as the first novel written in the Welsh language. The 20th century experienced an important shift away from the stilted and long-winded Victorian Welsh prose, with Thomas Gwynn Jones leading the way with his 1902 work Ymadawiad Arthur. The slaughter in the trenches of the First World War had a profound effect on Welsh literature with a more pessimistic style of prose championed by T. H. Parry-Williams and R. Williams Parry. The industrialisation of south Wales saw a further shift with the likes of Rhydwen Williams who used the poetry and metre of <b>a</b> <b>bygone</b> rural Wales but in the context of an industrial landscape. Though the inter-war period is dominated by Saunders Lewis, for his political and reactionary views as much as his plays, poetry and criticism.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, {{the line}} was not profitable. Given the {{communities}} it served, private investors {{were not interested in}} making necessary investment. In 1992, under the liberal economic practices of the central government, it was decided to close the line. However there was a national and even an international outcry at the decision to close a line which had become emblematic of <b>a</b> <b>bygone</b> age and of that region. The two provincial governments came together to keep the line open.|$|E
25|$|Later in the Victorian period, the Regency {{seemed to}} retreat to an unthreateningly remote {{historical}} distance, and Kate Greenaway and the Artistic Dress movement selectively revived elements of early 19th century fashions. During the late Victorian and Edwardian periods, many genre paintings, sentimental valentines, etc. contained loose depictions of 1795–1820 styles (then considered to be quaint relics of <b>a</b> <b>bygone</b> era). In the late 1960s / early 1970s, there was a limited fashion revival of the Empire silhouette.|$|E

25|$|Kothi Khas Bagh is {{a palace}} located at Rampur, about 30km east of Moradabad in Uttar Pradesh. It was the {{erstwhile}} {{residence of the}} Nawabs of Rampur. Set in a 300-acre compound, this huge 200-room European style palace is a unique blend of Islamic architecture and British architecture. It also features personal apartments and offices, music rooms and personal cinema hall of Nawabs. The huge halls, adorned with Burma teak and Belgium glass chandeliers, present a fine specimen of the architecture of <b>a</b> <b>bygone</b> era. There is an Italian marble staircase towards the main bedrooms. The statue of Kalb Ali Khan, the second Nawab of Rampur, is an eye-catching one.

25|$|Constructed {{over one}} hundred years ago, the clock {{on top of the}} main head house is the largest {{operating}} hand-wound clock mechanism in New England. The clock is styled after London's Big Ben, and has a 12-foot wide face. The mechanism weighs over 400 pounds. In 2008, the clock underwent a six-week restoration and repair. The clock mechanism was completely disassembled and transported to a nearby workshop, where replacement pieces had to be fabricated by hand. The clock, once one of many in the city, is a hallmark of <b>a</b> <b>bygone</b> era—something that commuters rely on to make their trains, and which visitors admire for its historical presence. The stone eagle that sits atop the clock is eight feet wide and weighs over eight tons. The eagle imitates the figurines commonly placed atop classically styled buildings.|$|E

5000|$|During {{the summer}} of 1930, Helen Hartness Flanders began to {{correspond}} with Barry {{on the subject of}} an archive of traditional songs she had been collecting in Vermont for the Vermont Commission on Country Life. Initially they collaborated for the sake of finding Child Ballads in New England; at the time these songs were considered to be more prevalent in the South and were generally not associated with New England culture. Besides Flanders, Barry's contemporaries included Fannie Eckstorm, Marguerite Olney, Eloise Linscott, and Mary Winslow Smyth. Together, they collected New England songs from 1920 to 1960, documenting a fading musical tradition belonging to <b>an</b> <b>bygone</b> lifestyle. Barry's later work focused more on original ("native") American ballads rather than British ballads. His last work, published posthumously, was The Maine Woods Songster, his second volume of songs from the state. He {{was in the process of}} doing research on the ballads [...] "The Three Sisters" [...] and [...] "Little Musgrave".|$|R
25|$|The {{process of}} Magyarization {{did not succeed}} in {{imposing}} the Hungarian language as the most used language in all territories in the Kingdom of Hungary. In fact the profoundly multinational character of historic Transylvania was reflected in the fact that during the fifty years of the dual monarchy, the spread of Hungarian as the second language remained limited. In 1880, 5.7% of the non-Hungarian population, or 109,190 people, claimed to have a knowledge of the Hungarian language; the proportion rose to 11% (183,508) in 1900, and to 15.2% (266,863) in 1910. These figures reveal the reality of <b>a</b> <b>bygone</b> era, one in which millions of people could conduct their lives without speaking the state's official language. The policies of Magyarization aimed to have a Hungarian language surname as a requirement for access to basic government services such as local administration, education, and justice.|$|E
25|$|Following completion, {{the park}} quickly slipped into decline. One {{of the main}} reasons for this was the lack of {{interest}} from the Tammany Hall political machine, which was the largest political force in New York at the time. Around the turn of the 20th century, the park faced several new challenges. Cars were becoming commonplace, bringing with them their burden of pollution, and people's attitudes were beginning to change. No longer were parks to be used only for walks and picnics in an idyllic environment but also for sports and similar recreation. Following the dissolution of the Central Park Commission in 1870 and Andrew Green's departure from the project, and Vaux's death in 1895, the maintenance effort gradually declined. All of this changed in 1934, when Republican Fiorello La Guardia was elected mayor of New York City and unified the five park-related departments then in existence. Robert Moses was given the task of cleaning up the park. Moses, about {{to become one of the}} most powerful men in New York City, took over what was essentially a relic, a leftover from <b>a</b> <b>bygone</b> era.|$|E

500|$|Other critics' enthusiasm was {{somewhat}} tempered.

500|$|On 15 September 1935, {{one year}} after the death of Reich President Paul von Hindenburg and Hitler's {{elevation}} to the position of Führer, the dual flag arrangement was ended, with the exclusive use of the Nazi flag as the national flag of Germany. One reason may have been the [...] "Bremen incident" [...] of 26 July 1935, in which a group of demonstrators in New York City boarded the ocean liner SS Bremen, tore the Nazi Party flag from the jackstaff, and tossed it into the Hudson River. When the German ambassador protested, US officials responded that the German national flag had not been harmed, only a political party symbol.

[...] A sense of despondency and restlessness entered the psyche of the youth in the United States and elsewhere, with a growing rise of tension and alienation creeping into the collective mindset—even in the largely conservative suburban communities which produced so many garage bands. [...] The garage bands, though generally apolitical, nonetheless reflected the tenor of the times. [...] Nightly news reports had a cumulative effect on the mass consciousness, including musicians. [...] Detectable in much of the music from this era is a combination of disparate emotions, particularly in light of President Kennedy's assassination and the ongoing escalation of troops sent to Vietnam, yet displaying what some now view as <b>a</b> <b>bygone</b> innocence.|$|E
