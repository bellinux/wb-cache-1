It is a vandal state. There is a Russian writer who once described vandal states as Genghis Khan with a telegraph. Israel is Genghis Khan with a computer. I feel no emotion of affinity with that state. I have some good friends and their families there, and of course I would not want any of them to be hurt. That said, sometimes I feel that Israel has come out of the boils (sic) of the hell, a satanic state.|$|E

During those years of separation from her husband, Kumari's name was associated with Rahul, Gulzar, Dharmendra and Sawan Kumar Tak.|$|E
25|$|In 1553, this Neill {{sold the}} island to James MacDonald of Islay. Neill died without issue, and the next in line to the chiefship was another Neil, who {{obtained}} the lands of Taynish. His descendant Hector Macneill of Taynish purchased Gigha in 1590. With {{the power of the}} Campbells growing and spreading out into the Inner Hebrides, the influence of the McNeills of Gigha decreased. At about this time the MacNeils on more remote island of Barra, far removed of Campbell power, began to grow in prominence and for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> have been regarded as Chief of the Clan and Name. Descending from this branch were the MacNeils of Colonsay who obtained Colonsay in 1700 and owned it until 1904 when it was sold by John Carstairs McNeill. According to Moncreiffe, {{there is reason to believe}} that historically this branch were superior to the current chiefs of the Clan Macneil. There is even a school of thought that there is no relation at all between this branch of McNeills to that of Barra. However, according to a 1962 decree by the Lord Lyon, the chiefs of MacNeil of Barra are chiefs of the whole name of MacNeil by Scots law.|$|E

500|$|The {{track is}} built on a {{recreation}} of electronic musician Aphex Twin's piano composition [...] "Avril 14th". The song begins with a minute long introduction sung by Legend. [...] "Blame Game" [...] has a lush, cello-driven production with predominant piano. After Legend's introduction, West raps his verses in a highly melodic manner, almost singing his lines. West's forceful delivery expresses hurt and contempt. The song's soulful sound juxtaposes West's angry lyrics: [...] "been <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> I spoke {{to you in a}} bathroom, ripping you up, fuckin' and chokin' you".

500|$|Gilligan {{inserted}} {{a reference to}} the villain Eugene Victor Tooms from the first season episodes [...] "Squeeze" [...] and [...] "Tooms" [...] in a conversation between Ryan and Mulder. The episode represents one of the first entries in the series to be written by someone from outside the main writing staff of The X-Files. Originally, the script called for Banton's shadow {{to be able to move}} independently; Carter and writer Howard Gordon rewrote the story to remove this aspect. Gilligan later noted, [...] "they rewrote the episode [...] this saved an enormous amount of money in animation costs." [...] In addition, the [...] character of X was not in the first draft of the script. However, the series staff realized that Banton's fear of having the government control him should be [...] "more than just paranoia". Thus, X was written into the story. Writer Frank Spotnitz later noted, [...] "it had been <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> X had done anything and the character really needed to grow." ...|$|E

He's the main asset of his own corporation, which is a profitable subsidiary of Sony". Some reviewers commented on the unusual format of a new studio album being accompanied by a [...] "greatest hits" [...] collection, with Q magazine saying [...] "from the new songs' point of view, it's like taking your dad with you into a fight."

[...] Canning also concluded his review by stating that it [...] "fell shy of being an absolute classic." [...] Writing for The Palm Beach Post Kevin D. Thompson said [...] "While last night's episode was far from unwatchable, it wasn't one of the show's best, either. But as I've written before, a so-so 30 Rock is still better than 99 percent of TV's other so-called comedies." [...] Thompson noted that he was not thrilled with the return of Dean Winters as Dennis, and called his plot with Liz and Jenna [...] "the show's least interesting plot".|$|E
500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "You and I" [...] {{is set in}} common time with a slow tempo of 60 beats per minute. It is written in the key of A major. During the song Gaga's voice spans from the notes of E3 to C5. The song begins with an A–G–A chord progression, which changes to A–Bm/A–D/A–Bm during the chorus, {{and back to the}} former chords afterwards. The opening lyrics—"It's been <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> I came around/ It's been a long time, but I'm back in town/ And this time, I'm not leaving without you"—describe a whiskey-breathed lover for whom she is pining. Gil Kaufman of MTV News described it as the [...] "tune eschewed most of her dance flavor, right down to a rollicking barrel-house piano solo." [...] Her voice sounded like growling during the main verses, where she sings the lines: [...] "He said, 'Sit back down where you belong, in the corner of my bar with your high heels on, Sit back down on the couch where we made love the first time..." [...] Noting the differences between live performances of the song and the studio version, Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph observed that the piano parts were replaced mostly by [...] "fizzing synths, a stomping beat sampled from [...] "We Will Rock You", thundering electric guitars and backing vocals stacked into shimmering choral walls." [...] Kitty Empire of The Guardian described the song as an [...] "umlaut-toting digital country power ballad" [...] with two Bruce Springsteen references: [...] "born to run" [...] and Nebraska.|$|E
500|$|Several critics {{used their}} reviews to discuss Spielberg and analyze what the movie {{signified}} in his {{development as a}} filmmaker. Andrew O'Hehir of the online magazine Salon expressed excitement over the atypically hard edge of the movie. [...] "Little Steven Spielberg is all grown up now...into of all things a superior film artist...It's too early to know whether Minority Report, {{on the heels of}} A.I., marks a brief detour in Spielberg's career or a permanent change of course, but either way it's a dark and dazzling spectacle." [...] J. Hoberman of The Village Voice said it is [...] "the most entertaining, least pretentious genre movie Steven Spielberg has made in the decade since Jurassic Park." [...] Randy Shulman of Metro Weekly said that [...] "the movie is a huge leap forward for the director, who moves once and for all into the world of adult movie making." [...] Roger Ebert called the film a [...] "masterpiece" [...] and said that when most directors of the period were putting [...] "their trust in technology", Spielberg had already mastered it, and was emphasizing [...] "story and character" [...] while merely using technology as a [...] "workman uses his tools". David Edelstein of Slate echoed the positive sentiments, saying [...] "t has been <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> a Spielberg film felt so nimble, so unfettered, so free of self-cannibalizing." [...] Jonathan Rosenbaum, then of the Chicago Reader, was less convinced. Though he approved of the movie, he derided it in his review as a superficial action film, cautioning audiences to enjoy the movie, but not [...] "be conned into thinking that some sort of serious, thoughtful statement is being delivered along with the roller-coaster ride." ...|$|E
