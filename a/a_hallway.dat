5|$|The {{long take}} video begins with many people dancing on <b>a</b> <b>hallway,</b> until a girl comes and opens a door {{which leads to}} a room. There, other dancers are dancing to the song in midway of white rays of light, until the camera shows Jackson {{in the corner of the}} room and they start {{performing}} a dance routine. While the singer disappears from vision, people dance until she appears again dancing to the song. Then she goes to <b>a</b> <b>hallway</b> and enters a red-lighted room, accompanied by dancers, where entertainer Mimi Marks is seen. There she dances another routine along with her dancers. After dancing, she enters in another hallway where she gets alone with a man, until they share a kiss. Then, people who were in the previous room enter to the hallway to connect to another room, with Marks taking Jackson with her. The video ends with people coming closer to Jackson.|$|E
5|$|At {{ground level}} {{and inside the}} lobby, bas-reliefs depict {{the origins of the}} Price company. During the 1920s John M. Lyle, an {{influential}} architect of the Beaux-arts school, was developing a uniquely Canadian fusion of French and English colonial styles, and his ideas were applied by designers Ross and Macdonald to the construction of the Price Building. Each floor is symmetrically divided in two by <b>a</b> <b>hallway,</b> and a projection {{at the end of the}} building references the bow of a ship.|$|E
5|$|In December 1923, {{while visiting}} the Winchester {{residence}} of W. A. Baker, a fellow {{director of the}} Winchester and Western Railroad, Cornwell was rendered unconscious after a large longcase clock in <b>a</b> <b>hallway</b> toppled over, striking him on the head, and knocking him down. The longcase clock inflicted a severe wound {{to the back of}} Cornwell's head. He received first aid treatment from a physician present at the residence and was taken to his Winchester home where he regained consciousness.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to being used as {{the exterior of the}} school, Studio C holds sets for the school's entrance foyer, the gymnasium, the media lab and <b>a</b> <b>hallway</b> with lockers. As the series progressed and the budget increased, a stairway and balcony was installed in the foyer in an attempt to get characters off the floor and not all appear in the same geometric plane. For the first few seasons, the gym floor was made of real wooden floorboards; due to warping, it was replaced by concrete painted to look like wood.|$|E
5|$|On July 14, 2012, Barr came in second, {{losing the}} {{nomination}} to Jill Stein. Stein chose Cheri Honkala as her running-mate despite suggestions {{that she could}} choose Barr. Barr was given a prime speaking role at the Green Party National Convention in Baltimore, Maryland, but decided to instead send a surrogate, (Farheen Hakeem), to speak on her behalf. Barr's surrogate reportedly chided the party for not respecting Barr's candidacy. A shouting match in <b>a</b> <b>hallway</b> reportedly ensued. Barr repeatedly criticized Jill Stein after losing the Green Party nomination, and caused controversy by using alleged transphobic words in statements about Stein on Twitter.|$|E
5|$|Production {{designer}} Anthony D. G. Pratt {{was influenced}} by French architect Charles Garnier, designer of the original Paris opera house, as well as Edgar Degas, John Singer Sargent, Gustave Caillebotte, the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Schumacher was inspired by Jean Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast (1946), where <b>a</b> <b>hallway</b> is lined with arms holding candelabra. The cemetery {{was based on the}} Père Lachaise and Montparnasse. Costume designer Alexandra Byrne utilised a limited black, white, gold and silver colour palette for the Masquerade ball.|$|E

5|$|Surjik {{personally}} {{asked if}} he could direct the episode because he was a fan of the series; this was his only credit for the series. Filming the episode was difficult for the cast and crew due largely {{to the fact that the}} script arrived for the cast and crew to film only two days in advance. Other issues arose because of technical reasons; one scene required flooding <b>a</b> <b>hallway</b> with 3,300 gallons of water. Many of the scenes were filmed at Riverview Hospital, a mental health facility located in Coquitlam, British Columbia.|$|E
5|$|Aboard the ship, {{passenger}} John Geiger hacks {{into the}} ship's computer system, {{and the following}} evening, he destroys the ship's communication systems and kills the captain. After remotely shutting down the ship's engines, Geiger calls the bridge to tell the first officer, Juliano, that the captain is dead and he is in charge. Juliano is ordered by Geiger to evacuate the ship. Geiger steals jewelry from the ship's vault. As passengers evacuate, Drew, a young deaf girl, becomes trapped in an elevator, {{and a group of}} people become trapped behind locked fire doors in <b>a</b> <b>hallway</b> filling with smoke. As Annie and Alex attempt to board the last lifeboat, Geiger programs the ship to continue sailing. The winch lowering the lifeboat jams. Alex jumps into the boat to rescue the passengers who are falling off, and Annie and Juliano use the ship's gangplank to get them back on deck.|$|E
5|$|At {{the front}} of the house, on the ground floor, is a reconstructed medieval shop front, from where the owner would have {{conducted}} his mercantile business. Behind this is the central hall, originally designed with an open hearth in the middle, but now fitted with a 14th-century Flemish chimney, plastered so as to resemble brickwork. <b>A</b> <b>hallway</b> runs along one side of the hall; hallways were a traditional feature of the period, although the fashion was eventually abandoned because of the difficulty of lighting them effectively. At the rear of the property is an inner private room, with a decorative ceiling. Beneath the house is an undercroft, or cellar, designed to store barrels of wine at a constant temperature; the brick floor is 18th-century in origin, however. This is an architectural feature found in several other English coastal and river medieval towns, including Winchester and London.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} Ryan Key {{lying on his}} bed in an apartment. Suddenly, he gets {{swallowed}} by the bedsheets (this is where the track starts to play). The scene then shifts to Key in another dimension, ending {{up next to the}} wife of another man. The man notices Key, and he runs away from the man. Hiding in the bathroom, Key escapes through a window, where he ends up on a neighborhood street. Someone dressed in dark clothing gestures to offer him a drink, when Key notices he is in a bar filled with Asian people. During part of the video, it features the band performing in front of a crowd wearing suits. The chase continues through <b>a</b> <b>hallway,</b> underwater, to a hospital bed, and back. The video is based in a scene of the 1999 film Being John Malkovich, where Cameron Diaz chases Catherine Keener within the subconscious of Malkovich.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} Aguilera gearing up and riding a {{motorcycle}} into a nightclub. Wearing a bikini and buttocks-bearing chaps, she is lowered from a cage into a boxing ring and dances, accompanied by several back-up dancers. A masked woman is {{lowered into the}} ring, and the two engage in foxy boxing. The scene is intercut with sequences of Aguilera dancing in a crop top, which she later removes to reveal a bra, and a microskirt. Redman then proceeds down <b>a</b> <b>hallway,</b> passing people such as mud wrestlers, a contortionist, and furries. The video proceeds to a scene of Aguilera and back-up dancers splashing and dancing while being sprayed with water in a room containing several urinals, as a possible reference to urolagnia. It features several sexual fetishes, from mud wrestling to muscle worshipping.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} Knowles laying on a table, lit with a {{flashing}} bright red light. While a siren is blaring, she half-stands and sings while {{dancing on the}} table. She proceeds to an interrogation room {{similar to the one}} in the film Basic Instinct. Knowles sings the first verse in a house with a seashore backdrop. She wants to escape, and struggles with masked and uniformed guards in <b>a</b> <b>hallway.</b> She is then returned to the interrogation room. In between cuts, she sings in a corner of a room, is seen reflected in a mirror while screaming, and among a group of reporters. As the song closes, Knowles is shown crying. The video ends with a close-up view of Knowles putting on red lipstick. The scene shows only her lips.|$|E
50|$|Access to {{the burial}} {{chambers}} are located inside the adjoining chapel against {{the north face}} of the pyramid. The entrance <b>hallway</b> leads to <b>a</b> long descent of eighteen hundred and twenty-three metres. The entrance was once blocked by a plug of granite now lost. The descending passage was probably clogged along its length by large blocks of limestone that thieves have broken up. The debris still littered the passage {{at the time of}} discovery. In the descending corridor is <b>a</b> successive horizontal <b>hallway,</b> <b>a</b> vestibule, another <b>hallway,</b> <b>a</b> bedroom with harrows, a final corridor, and a final granite passage which opens into the funerary apartments of the King.|$|R

5|$|A {{music video}} was filmed {{for the song}} and {{directed}} by Melina Matsoukas. There are {{two versions of the}} video— one intercut with clips from the ABC series Dirty Sexy Money and created to promote the show, and another which is the official video. The video is set in a mansion, and starts with Gaga making her way down <b>a</b> <b>hallway</b> with several people who are either walking behind her, holding an umbrella over her, dancing in front of her, or tossing dollar bills around her. Gaga and company are then featured in many repeatedly-changing shots at various locations in the mansion. She is seen lying seductively on a table covered with money, crawling along a black grand piano and striking the keys with her leg several times, dancing around and later making out with a statue, and dancing in an elevator solo. There are also several close-up shots of her burning money and later stuffing it into her mouth. Over the course of the video, she undergoes numerous costume changes. Singer-songwriter Space Cowboy is also shown, most notably in scenes where he climbs a wall.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Scully {{notices that}} Miles (now on life support) has two heartbeats. At the FBI, Kersh unsuccessfully tries to {{convince}} Doggett to stop investigating Mulder's apparent death. A short while later, as Skinner walks down <b>a</b> <b>hallway,</b> rogue agent Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) activates nanobots {{that he had}} previously placed in Skinner's bloodstream as blackmail. Skinner stumbles in pain, and in an elevator, Krycek reveals himself to Skinner and explains {{that he has a}} vaccine which could save Mulder's life. However, he will only give it if Skinner can ensure that Scully does not give birth to her baby for reasons that he does not disclose. Later, alone in his hospital bed, Miles regains consciousness and goes to take a shower. While doing so, his decaying flesh falls away, revealing a healthy body beneath. He tries to persuade Scully and Doggett that the aliens who abducted him are trying to save humanity. Scully, however, gets a lab report which reveals that Miles's DNA has substantially changed; he is now a new being. Skinner later tells Scully that there is a cure for Mulder's disease, but does not explain Krycek's demands.|$|E
