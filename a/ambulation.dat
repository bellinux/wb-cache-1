5|$|Motor symptoms, if not treated, advance aggressively in {{the early}} stages of the disease and more slowly later. Untreated, {{individuals}} are expected to lose independent <b>ambulation</b> after an average of eight years and be bedridden after ten years. However, it is uncommon to find untreated people nowadays. Medication has improved the prognosis of motor symptoms, while at the same time it is a new source of disability, because of the undesired effects of levodopa after years of use. In people taking levodopa, the progression time of symptoms to a stage of high dependency from caregivers may be over 15 years. However, it is hard to predict what course the disease will take for a given individual. Age is the best predictor of disease progression. The rate of motor decline is greater in those with less impairment at the time of diagnosis, while cognitive impairment is more frequent in those who are over 70 years of age at symptom onset.|$|E
25|$|The {{severity}} of impairment and related prognosis {{is dependent on}} the location and {{severity of}} brain lesions. Up to 50% of patients will achieve some degree of <b>ambulation.</b> Speech problems, such as dysarthria, are common to these patients.|$|E
25|$|Early <b>ambulation</b> also {{prevents}} venous stasis {{and physicians}} order OOB {{activities on the}} same day of surgery. This is accomplished in increments. The progression of increasing mobility proceeds by: raising the head of the bed, sitting up in bed, moving {{to the edge of the}} bed, dangling the legs off the bed and then ambulating to a close chair.|$|E
25|$|Inimicus is not {{the only}} fish that {{demonstrate}} this type of ambulation; it has been extensively described in other related benthic Scorpaeniformes fish such as the Sea robin, Flying gurnards, and the Tub Gurnard, Chelidonichthys lucerna. This type of locomotion, based on voluntary and coordinated movements of paired pectoral fins, is believed by some to be a precursor to the later development of similar <b>ambulation</b> in terrestrial vertebrates.|$|E
25|$|In {{many parts}} of the world {{travelers}} have observed the custom of hanging objects upon trees in order to establish some sort of a relationship between themselves and the tree. Throughout Europe, trees are known as sites of pilgrimages, ritual <b>ambulation,</b> and the recital of (Christian) prayers. Wreaths, ribbons or rags are suspended to win favor for sick humans or livestock, or merely for good luck. Popular belief associates the sites with healing, bewitching, or mere wishing.|$|E
25|$|Immobility is a {{significant}} risk factor {{in the development of}} thrombosis. Immediate post-surgical interventions,(out of bed orders (OOB), are typically ordered by the physician to prevent thrombosis. These orders are typically delegated to a nurse, but may include the participation of a physical therapist and others trained to perform the intervention. are to perform range of motion (ROM) activities that include: muscle contractions of the lower legs for those who are very weak, moving the feet, wiggling the toes, bending the knees, raise and lower the legs. In addition, changes in positioning prevents immobility and shifts areas of venous stasis. If the person is too weak to perform these preventative activities, hospital personnel will perform these movements independently. Exercise of the lower extremeties is a post-operative method of prophlaxsis. Nursing personnel will often perform range of motion exercises and encourage frequent moving of the legs, feet, and ankles. Frequent positioning changes and adequate fluid intake. After a surgical procedure, <b>ambulation</b> as soon as possible is prophylactic in preventing the formation of blood clots.|$|E
25|$|Finally, motor-skill {{rehabilitation}} {{has been}} proposed as another possible way in which games {{can be used for}} rehabilitation purposes. Stroke patients suffering upper extremity motor difficulties have been the primary focus of this subject and, in this case, a variety of gaming environments have been experimented with. Output has shown that their Fugl-Meyer UE scores and their Functional Independence Measure scale score increase after a period of engaging in virtual rehabilitation, suggesting that their mobility dysfunction decreased and their degree of independence increased due to the intervention. Additionally, output has suggested improved motor skills on a higher level, having several researchers suggesting positive improvements in their stroke patients as a result of virtual rehabilitation methods. At this higher level, researchers have suggested improved ability to walk, or <b>ambulation,</b> and improved use of larger motor skills after intervention. One other class of patients that has been studied less frequently in this category of rehabilitation is cerebral palsy patients. Ability to walk certain distances without the use of an assistive device was the method of measurement for this category. After a period of working with a Wii-based system, it was shown that a patient who struggled with walking large distances before, was able to walk a noticeably longer distance. This suggests an improvement in larger motor skills, whereas the stroke patients demonstrated an improvement in finer motor skills, focused strictly on their use of upper extremities during the gaming rehabilitation.|$|E
2500|$|Walking (also {{known as}} <b>ambulation)</b> {{is one of}} the main gaits of {{locomotion}} among legged animals. Walking is typically slower than running and other gaits. [...] Walking is defined by an 'inverted pendulum' gait in which the body vaults over the stiff limb or limbs with each step. This applies regardless of the number of limbs—even arthropods, with six, eight or more limbs, walk.|$|E
2500|$|Orthopedic {{corrective}} treatments {{may also}} manifest into gait abnormality, such as lower extremity amputation, post-fracture, and arthroplasty (joint replacement). Difficulty in <b>ambulation</b> {{that results from}} chemotherapy is generally temporary in nature, though recovery times of {{six months to a}} year are common. Likewise, difficulty in walking due to arthritis or joint pains (antalgic gait) sometimes resolves spontaneously once the pain is gone. Hemiplegic persons have [...] and those with cerebral palsy often have scissoring gait.|$|E
2500|$|After {{awakening}} and stabilizing in the ICU for 18 to 24 hours, {{the person}} is transferred to the cardiac surgery [...] If the patient is in a CUB, equipment and nursing is [...] "stepped down" [...] appropriate to the patient's progress without having to move the patient. Vital sign monitoring, remote rhythm monitoring, early <b>ambulation</b> with assistance, breathing exercises, pain control, blood sugar monitoring with intravenous insulin administration by protocol, and anti-platelet agents are all standard of care.|$|E
2500|$|Persons {{suffering}} from peripheral neuropathy experience numbness and tingling {{in their hands}} and feet. This can cause <b>ambulation</b> impairment, such as trouble climbing stairs or maintaining balance. Gait abnormality is also common in persons with nervous system problems such as cauda equina syndrome, [...] multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, myasthenia gravis, normal pressure hydrocephalus, and Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease. Research has shown that neurological gait abnormalities are {{associated with an increased}} risk of falls in older adults.|$|E
2500|$|Non-invasive BCIs {{have also}} been applied to enable brain-control of {{prosthetic}} upper and lower extremity devices in people with paralysis. For example, Gert Pfurtscheller of Graz University of Technology and colleagues demonstrated a BCI-controlled functional electrical stimulation system to restore upper extremity movements in a person with tetraplegia due to spinal cord injury. Between 2012 and 2013, researchers at the University of California, Irvine demonstrated {{for the first time}} that it is possible to use BCI technology to restore brain-controlled walking after spinal cord injury. In their spinal cord injury research study, a person with paraplegia was able to operate a BCI-robotic gait orthosis to regain basic brain-controlled <b>ambulation.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Lower {{extremity}} casts {{are classified}} similarly, with a cast encasing both the foot and the leg to the hip {{being called a}} long leg cast, while a cast encasing the patient's foot, ankle and lower leg ending below the knee {{is referred to as}} a short leg cast. A walking heel may be applied for <b>ambulation.</b> These heels, when properly applied, elevate the toes and offer the wearer the advantage of keeping the toes out of the dirt and moisture of the street. [...] The walking heel provides a small contact patch for the cast and creates a fluid rocking motion during the stride and allows the cast to pivot easily in any direction. Similarly, a cast shoe/cast boot/cast sandal may be provided to the patient to be used during <b>ambulation</b> of the immobilized limb during convalescence (referred to as being weight bearing). [...] Additionally, a castshoe may be used to simply protect the patient's casted foot while helping to maintain a higher degree of hygiene by preventing the cast from directly contacting potentially dirty or wet ground surfaces. [...] Where the patient is not to walk on the injured limb, crutches or a wheelchair may be provided. The foot's under-sole portion of a leg cast may be extended terminating {{at the tip of the}} patient's toes, to create a rigid support which limits motion of the metatarsals in both weight bearing and non-weight bearing leg casts. [...] These are referred to as toeplates in the orthopedic discipline of medicine. This addition may be applied to further support and stabilize the metatarsals by limiting motion through a higher degree of immobilization, as well as protecting the toes from additional blunt force trauma. Typically leg casts which incorporate a toeplate are prescribed for injuries to the foot and metatarsals. [...] Ordinarily, a leg cast applied for the treatment of a stable ankle fracture would not use the toeplate design because there is no need to immobilize and limit the motion of the patient's toes.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{types of}} balance {{disorders}} will require balance training, prescribed by an occupational therapist or physiotherapist. Physiotherapists often administer standardized outcome measures {{as part of}} their assessment in order to gain useful information and data about a patient’s current status. Some standardized balance assessments or outcome measures include {{but are not limited to}} the Functional Reach Test, Clinical Test for Sensory Integration in Balance (CTSIB), Berg Balance Scale and/or Timed Up and Go [...] The data and information collected can further help the physiotherapist develop an intervention program that is specific to the individual assessed. Intervention programs may include training activities that can be used to improve static and dynamic postural control, body alignment, weight distribution, <b>ambulation,</b> fall prevention and sensory function. Although treatment programs exist which seek to aid the brain in adapting to vestibular injuries, it is important to note that it is simply that – an adaptation to the injury. Although the patient’s balance is restored, the balance system injury still exists.|$|E
