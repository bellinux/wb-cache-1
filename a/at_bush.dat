5|$|In Britain {{the use of}} {{elaborate}} {{symbols of}} authority developed about 15,000 years ago during the Upper Paleolithic. Ivory rods, carved antlers, painted animal skulls, and other objects were buried with tribal leaders at caves in Somerset and Derbyshire. Later, around 2400BCE (BC), a group of peoples from mainland Europe known as Beaker folk conquered most of Britain. This warrior race had a tradition of investing their new leaders with polished ceremonial axes made of green quartzite, red tourmaline, and jadeite. Excavations <b>at</b> <b>Bush</b> Barrow, Wiltshire, unearthed an early example of a sceptre, decorated with bone in a zig-zag pattern, and topped by a stone. Archaeologists believe it and other treasures found in the grave may have belonged to the ruling family who built Stonehenge. By 1600 BCE, the rulers of southern Britain wore gold epaulettes, gold brooches, and gold-plated bronze daggers. A ceremonial gold cloak of the same period, the Mold cape, was found at a Bronze Age burial mound in Flintshire, Wales, in 1833.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the decline}} of the {{railways}} after World War II, Bush Terminal Railway went defunct in the 1970s, its operations continued by the New York Dock Railroad. Shipping activity <b>at</b> <b>Bush</b> Terminal also declined after World War II. The introduction of containerized shipping and the construction of the Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal in New Jersey hastened the decline of sea traffic to Bush Terminal. However, car floats and transload activity have moved to the nearby 65th Street Yard and, along with the Bush Terminal Rail Yard, are operated by New York New Jersey Rail, LLC, now owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey; trackage through Bush Terminal has been refurbished and extended to the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal and is used occasionally to deliver New York City Subway rolling stock via the South Brooklyn Railway.

2500|$|Sunset Park {{began to}} suffer {{economic}} decline even before World War II, {{due to the}} Great Depression, the demolition of the Fifth Avenue El, and the 1941 construction and widening of the Gowanus Expressway. After the war, [...] "white flight", the maritime industry's move to New Jersey, and the deactivation of the Brooklyn Army Terminal from the 1970s also hurt the neighborhood until the terminal was reopened as an industrial park in 1987. However, this decline did not greatly affect Bush Terminal, because although its piers are now defunct and its rail system is much smaller {{than it was before}} World War II (and not operated by Bush Terminal), the buildings and warehouses <b>at</b> <b>Bush</b> Terminal did not suffer the abandonment so common across the United States after World War II.|$|E
2500|$|Early in the century, the Bush Terminal Company {{commissioned}} architects Kirby, Petit & Green {{to design}} its headquarters building in Manhattan at 100 Broad Street (at the intersection with Pearl and Bridge Streets).

[...] The terminal also funded construction of Bush Tower, a 30-story skyscraper near Times Square in Manhattan, where tenants of Bush Terminal were offered display space to showcase their goods, above a club for buyers visiting New York. The Bush Terminal Company attempted a similar melding of commercial displays and social space <b>at</b> <b>Bush</b> House in London, built in three phases during the 1920s, but the concept was not fully carried through at that project.|$|E

2500|$|Kentucky Rifleman William Atherton's memoirs {{testify to}} the skill of the Essex men and natives <b>at</b> <b>bush</b> fighting, stating [...] "the fight now became very close, and {{extremely}} hot ... I received a wound in my right shoulder." [...] The moment before Atherton was hit, he witnessed two of his fellow riflemen move too far forward. One was killed and the other wounded. Atherton described the tactics used by Ebenezer Reynolds and his Canadians: [...] "Their method was to retreat rapidly until {{they were out of}} sight (which was soon the case in the brushy woods) and while we were advancing they were preparing to give us another fire; so we were generally under the necessity of firing upon them as they were retreating." [...] Another Kentucky private had similar recollections: [...] "As we advanced they were firing themselves behind logs, trees, etc. to the best advantage." [...] After a long, bloody and exhaustive withdrawal over two miles of woodland, the Canadians and natives slipped away, leaving Frenchtown to the Kentuckians. This skirmish would later be called as the First Battle of the River Raisin.|$|E

Want of provisions soon obliged him to give up the pursuit, and return to Ninety-Six. Leaving about one half of his force there, under Colonel Cruger, he sallied a second time from Ninety-Six, at the head of eleven hundred infantry, with cavalry, artillery, and field-pieces, marching by {{the south side of the}} Saluda for the Congaree.|$|E
