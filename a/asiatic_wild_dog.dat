2500|$|The dhole [...] (Cuon alpinus) is a canid {{native to}} Central, South and Southeast Asia. Other English {{names for the}} species include <b>Asiatic</b> <b>wild</b> <b>dog,</b> Indian wild dog, {{whistling}} dog, red dog, and mountain wolf. It is genetically close to species within the genus Canis, though its skull is convex rather than concave in profile, it lacks a third lower molar and the upper molars sport only a single cusp as opposed to two to four. During the Pleistocene, the dhole ranged throughout Asia, Europe and North America but became restricted to its historical range 12,000–18,000 years ago.|$|E
50|$|In the Middle East to the Indian Subcontinent, Asiatic {{lions and}} tigers were the biggest predators to onagers, just as African lions are to zebras. They were also {{formerly}} by <b>Asiatic</b> <b>wild</b> <b>dogs,</b> <b>Asiatic</b> cheetahs and possibly bears in their former neighboring ranges, {{though they may}} have mostly preyed on onager foals. In South Asia, mugger crocodiles can be great threats to onagers during migratory river crossings.|$|R
50|$|According to the locals, Tigers and Leopards {{were common}} {{back in the}} 1960s. But since 1971, {{there has been no}} certain tiger sightings. However very rare {{occasional}} reports of Leopards surface but these {{are more likely to be}} stray individuals of bordering Indian forest. Also Dholes or <b>Asiatic</b> <b>Wild</b> <b>Dogs</b> are extinct since 90s. At present different types of small wild cats and jackals are main terrestrial predators of the forest.|$|R
50|$|Flagship species like Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris), Indian bison or gaur (Bos gaurus) and Indian {{elephants}} (Elephas maximus indicus) {{are found}} in large numbers inside the park. A study carried out by Dr. Ullas Karanth of the Wildlife Conservation Society {{has shown that the}} forests of Nagarhole have three species of predators i.e. tiger, Indian leopard (Panthera pardus fusca) and <b>Asiatic</b> <b>wild</b> <b>dogs</b> (Cuon alpinus alpinus) present at an equivalent density (PA Update 2000).|$|R

25|$|The Central Zoo Authority of India (CZA) has {{identified}} the park as coordinating zoo for the breeding programmes for endangered species as per the National Zoo Policy {{adopted by the}} Government of India in 1988, which states that the main objective of zoos will be to complement and strengthen national efforts in the conservation of the country's rich biodiversity and that the species which have no chance of survival in the wild would be bred under ex-situ conditions. The park has {{a high rate of}} success in captive breeding of lion-tailed macaques. In 2010, the zoo had 22 lion-tailed macaques, from a breeding pair that were brought to the zoo in 1983. The park is also successful in breeding other rare species in captivity, including ostrich, Asian palm civet, Indian gaur, <b>wild</b> <b>dog,</b> <b>Asiatic</b> lion, Nilgiri langur, sangai, hippo, Malabar giant squirrel, white tiger, Asiatic wolf, panther and bison. The zoo is among four in the country to have an ostrich. The park also undertakes cross-breeding as part of its conservation efforts. The park is also a participating zoo of the CZA for the captive breeding of rock python, Nilgiri langur, lion-tailed macaque, <b>Asiatic</b> lion, <b>wild</b> <b>dog,</b> <b>Asiatic</b> wolf, and gaur. The zoo also promotes exterior conservation—conservation of rare species in their natural habitat—whereby individuals born in the zoo are released in the wild after adequate training, as per the guidelines of the CZA.|$|R
50|$|A {{recent study}} revealed, that the <b>Asiatic</b> <b>wild</b> <b>dog</b> {{has become very}} rare in the area. The wild dogs in the Khangchendzonga Biosphere Reserve are {{believed}} {{to belong to the}} rare and genetically distinct subspecies C. a. primaevus.|$|E
50|$|Their past {{extinction}} {{was due to}} tigers—precisely, the Balinese tiger—and humans hunting {{them for}} their antlers and pelts. Their main predators now are humans, leopards, the golden jackal, dholes (the <b>Asiatic</b> <b>wild</b> <b>dog),</b> the Indian wolf, pythons, and crocodiles.|$|E
50|$|The {{ecoregion}} {{is home to}} 76 {{species of}} mammals, none of which are endemic, although several of which, including the Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris), along with gaur (Bos gaurus), packs of dhole or <b>Asiatic</b> <b>wild</b> <b>dog</b> (Cuon alpinus), sloth bear (Melursus ursinus), chousingha (Tetracerus quadricornis), and blackbuck (Antilope cervicapra), are threatened.|$|E
5000|$|Leopards must {{compete for}} food and shelter with other large predators such as tigers, lions, cheetahs, spotted hyenas, striped hyenas, brown hyenas, up to five species of bear and both African and <b>Asiatic</b> <b>wild</b> <b>dogs.</b> These animals may steal the leopard's kill, devour its young or even kill adult leopards. Leopards co-exist {{alongside}} these other large predators by hunting for different types of prey and by avoiding areas frequented by them. Leopards may also retreat up a tree {{in the face of}} direct aggression from other large carnivores but leopards have been seen to either kill or prey on competitors such as black-backed jackal, caracal, African wild cat and the cubs of lions, cheetahs, hyenas, and <b>wild</b> <b>dogs.</b> [...] Resource partitioning occurs where leopards share their range with tigers. Leopards tend to take smaller prey, usually less than 75 kg, where tigers are present. In areas where the leopard is sympatric with the tiger, coexistence is reportedly not the general rule, with leopards being few where tigers are numerous. The mean leopard density decreased significantly (from 9.76 to 2.07 animals per 100 km2) when the mean density of tigers increased (from 3.31 animals/100km2 to 5.81 animals/100km2) from 2004-5 to 2007-8 in the Rajaji National Park in India following the relocation of pastoralists out of the park. There, the two species have high dietary overlap, and an increase in the tiger population resulted in a sharp decrease in the leopard population and a shift in the leopard diet to small prey (from 9% to 36%) and domestic prey (from 6.8% to 31.8%). In the Primore region of the Russian Far East, Amur leopards were absent or very rarely encountered at places where Siberian tigers reside. However, in the Chitwan National Park in Nepal, both species coexist because there is a large prey biomass, a large proportion of prey is of the smaller sizes, and dense vegetation exists. Here leopards killed prey ranging from less than 25 kg to 100 kg in weight with most kills in the 25 - 50 kg range; tigers killed more prey in the 50 - 100 kg range. There were also differences in the microhabitat preferences of the individual tiger and leopard followed over 5-month (December to April) period in this study - the tiger used roads and (except in February) forested areas more frequently, while the leopard used recently burned areas and open areas more frequently [...] Usually when a tiger began to kill baits at sites formerly frequented by leopards, the leopards would no longer come and kill there. In the tropical forests of India's Nagarhole National Park, tigers selected prey weighing more than 176 kg, whereas leopards selected prey in the 30 - 175 kg range. In tropical forest they do not always avoid the larger cats by hunting at different times. With relatively abundant prey and differences in the size of prey selected, tigers and leopards seem to successfully coexist without competitive exclusion or inter-species dominance hierarchies that may be more common to the leopard's co-existence with the lion in savanna habitats. In areas with high tiger populations, such as in the central parts of India's Kanha National Park, leopards are not permanent residents, but transients. They were common near villages at the periphery of the park and outside the park.|$|R

50|$|The Altai {{mountains}} {{are home to}} a diverse fauna, because of its different habitats, like steppes, northern taigas and alpine vegetation. Steep slopes are home to the Siberian ibex (Capra sibirica), whereas the rare argali (Ovis ammon) is found on more gentle slopes. Deer are represented by five species, Altai wapiti (Cervus elaphus sibiricus), moose (Alces alces), forest reindeer (Rangifer tarandus valentinae), Siberian musk deer (Moschus moschiferus) and Siberian roe deer (Capreolus pygargus). Moose and reindeer however, are restricted to the northern parts of the mountain range. The wild boar (Sus scrofa) {{is found in the}} lower foothills and surrounding lowlands. Until recently, the Mongolian gazelle (Procapra gutturosa) was found in the Russian Altai mountains, more specifically in the Chuya River steppe close to the Mongolian border. Large predators are represented by snow leopards (Panthera uncia, syn. Uncia uncia), wolves (Canis lupus), lynx (Lynx lynx), and brown bears (Ursus arctos), in the northern parts also by the wolverine (Gulo gulo).

40|$|African <b>wild</b> <b>dogs</b> are endangered, and in South Africa as elsewhere, {{they inhabit}} a {{fraction}} of their former range. In this study, we assessed the potential for economic benefits derived from ecotourism to offset the costs of three <b>wild</b> <b>dog</b> conservation options using a contingent valuation study of the willingness of visitors to four protected areas to pay to see <b>wild</b> <b>dogs</b> at the den – within a viable population in a large protected area (Kruger National Park), through reintroduction into nature reserves, and through the conservation of <b>wild</b> <b>dogs</b> occurring on ranchland in situ. Results indicated that tourism revenue from <b>wild</b> <b>dogs</b> in large protected areas is more than sufficient to offset the costs and could potentially be used to subsidise <b>wild</b> <b>dog</b> reintroductions or the conservation of <b>wild</b> <b>dogs</b> in situ on ranchland. On ranchland and for reintroductions, tourism revenue was generally predicted to offset most {{of the costs of}} conserving <b>wild</b> <b>dogs</b> where predation costs are low, and to exceed the costs where willingness to pay is high, and/or where the costs of predation by <b>wild</b> <b>dogs</b> are zero. Conservation efforts should facilitate the derivation of eco-tourism-related benefits from <b>wild</b> <b>dogs</b> on ranchland and in private reserves to create incentives for <b>wild</b> <b>dog</b> conservation.
