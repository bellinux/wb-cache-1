2500|$|Infrared {{absorption}} bands trap heat from escaping earth's atmosphere. In {{the case of}} CFCs, the strongest of these bands {{are located in the}} spectral region 7.8–15.3µm [...] – referred to as an <b>atmospheric</b> <b>window</b> due to the relative transparency of the atmosphere within this region. The strength of CFC bands and the unique susceptibility of the atmosphere, at which the compound absorbs and emits radiation, are two factors that contribute to CFCs' [...] "super" [...] greenhouse effect. Another such factor is the low concentration of the compound. Because CO2 is close to saturation with high concentrations, it takes more of the substance to enhance the greenhouse effect. Conversely, the low concentration of CFCs allow their effects to increase linearly with mass.|$|E
50|$|An <b>atmospheric</b> <b>window</b> is {{a dynamic}} {{property}} of the atmosphere, while the spectral window is a static characteristic of the electromagnetic radiative absorption spectra of many greenhouse gases, including water vapour. The <b>atmospheric</b> <b>window</b> tells what actually happens in the atmosphere, while the spectral window tells {{of one of the}} several abstract factors that potentially contribute to the actual concrete happenings in the atmosphere. Window radiation is radiation that actually passes through the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>window.</b> Non-window radiation is radiation that actually does not pass through the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>window.</b> Window wavelength radiation is radiation that, judging only from its wavelength, potentially might or might not, but is likely to pass through the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>window.</b> Non-window wavelength radiation is radiation that, judging only from its wavelength, is unlikely to pass through the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>window.</b> The difference between window radiation and window wavelength radiation is that window radiation is an actual component of the radiation, determined by the full dynamics of the atmosphere, taking in all determining factors, while window wavelength radiation is merely theoretically potential, defined only by one factor, the wavelength.|$|E
50|$|Without the {{infrared}} <b>atmospheric</b> <b>window,</b> the Earth would become much too warm to support life, and possibly so warm {{that it would}} lose its water, as Venus did early in solar system history.

5000|$|In recent decades, the {{existence}} of the infrared <b>atmospheric</b> <b>window</b> has become threatened by the development of highly unreactive gases containing bonds between fluorine and either carbon or sulfur. The [...] "stretching frequencies" [...] of bonds between fluorine and other light nonmetals are such that strong absorption in the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>window</b> will always be characteristic of compounds containing such bonds. This absorption is strengthened because these bonds are highly polar due to the extreme electronegativity of the fluorine atom. Bonds to other halogens also absorb in the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>window,</b> though much less strongly.|$|E

40|$|We {{will report}} here about surface {{observations}} of Venus from VIRTIS on VenusExpress {{after one year}} in orbit. The M-IR channel of VIRTIS on VenusExpress allows observing the surface of Venus in three small <b>atmospheric</b> <b>windows</b> at 1. 02, 1. 10 and 1. 18 μm. While the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>windows</b> show little CO 2 absorption, on {{its way through the}} atmosphere the thermal radiation is modified by scattering and absorption by clouds. Variations in the optical thickness of the clouds modulate the spatial distribution of upwelling radiation. Multiple reflections between surface and clouds generally wash out image contrast from surface emissivity. We have developed a data processing pipeline based on the approach by [1] which allows processing the huge amount of data returned by VIRTIS on VenusExpress in a timely manner. The data processing corrects for various atmospheric effects including limb darkening, scattered sunlight, etc and reduces the cloud induced contrast variations. The algorithm has been extensively tested and is continuously improved based on the available data. While there have been observations using the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>windows</b> b...|$|R
40|$|The M {{channel of}} VIRTIS {{will allow the}} first {{systematic}} mapping of the surface and of the near-surface atmosphere of Venus in the near infrared wavelengths range. This will be done using the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>windows</b> located at 1. 10, 1. 18 µm and if possible additionally using the window at 1. 02 µm (Wattson and Rothman 1986, Kamp et al. 1988, Moroz 2002). The latter is unfortunately right {{at the low end}} of the wavelength range of the IR channel and at the upper end of the VIS channel. Therefore, the usability of this window is unclear until first data from Venus are obtained. The <b>atmospheric</b> <b>windows</b> will allow measuring the thermal emission of the surface as was demonstrated by Galileo/NIMS (Carlson et al. 1991) and Cassini/VIMS (Baines et al. 2000).
