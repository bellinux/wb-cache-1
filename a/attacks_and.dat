40|$|To {{solve the}} problem of {{knowledge}} expression in SCADA network <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> defence system, a new knowledge expression method of SCADA network <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> defence based on factor state space is presented. Combined with factor space definition and the formal description of factor state space expression <b>and</b> analyzing <b>attack</b> factors, skill <b>and</b> <b>attack</b> aim, analysis <b>and</b> expression method of network <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> defense factors is developed. On the basis of analysis and expression of network <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> defense factors, equivalence class partition formal description is presented. For illustration, an attack simulation experiment is utilized to show the feasibility of the proposed method in solving network <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> defence knowledge expression. By introducing factor space canes, objects class can be represented. Empirical results show that our proposed method can effectively improve accuracy of attack classification. Knowledge expression method based on factor state space can effectively solve complexity of knowledge expression in network <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> defence system and provides a new method for solving similar application...|$|R

5|$|The game {{retains the}} {{real-time}} battle mechanics of previous {{games in the}} Mana series. The game sports four weapons with their own unique abilities: sword, flail, bow and arrow, and hammer. The player can have two weapons ready to attack with at a time, and {{any of the four}} character options can use any weapon. The player can change which weapons they have available at any time. Each weapon has standard normal attacks, special <b>attacks,</b> <b>and</b> fury attacks. The fury attacks are the strongest and require a full Fury Gauge to use, which is filled by striking enemies with standard <b>attacks</b> <b>and</b> taking damage from enemies. Different weapons can have different effects on the environment, such as the hammer's ability to smash pots. In addition to weapons, the player can select from one of eight Elementals, which provide different magical <b>attacks</b> <b>and</b> magical enhancements to weapon attacks. The player can switch between Elementals in the Mana Village. Elemental attacks can be made stronger by equipping Gems, which can also boost the player's attributes.|$|E

5|$|Because Guianan {{cocks-of-the-rock}} form large leks, averaging 55 adult males, {{the males}} in these display leks were {{especially vulnerable to}} <b>attacks</b> <b>and</b> predation by large snakes and other natural predators. In manipulated groups of smaller size, around 6, predation was less likely to occur, giving rise to an inverse relationship between the number and frequency of <b>attacks</b> <b>and</b> the size of leks. Thus, with a smaller frequency of attacks on the smaller group, the Guianan cock-of-the-rock males was less likely to spook or disperse completely as compared to a large group where a false alarm could trigger a complete flush out 90% of the time. It was found that these birds have relatively ineffective methods of anti-predation and that only social anti-predation and the infrequency of encounters with predators were keeping these lekking males alive.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, several dynamic ID-based {{remote user}} {{authentication}} schemes have been proposed. In 2012, Wen and Li proposed a dynamic ID-based remote user authentication with key agreement scheme. They claimed that their scheme can resist impersonation <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> insider <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> provide anonymity for the users. However, {{we will show}} that Wen and Li's scheme cannot withstand insider <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> forward secrecy, does not provide anonymity for the users, and inefficiency for error password login. In this paper, we propose a novel ECC-based remote user authentication scheme which is immune to various known types of <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> is more secure and practical for mobile clients...|$|R
30|$|In 2005, Yang et al. (2005) {{proposed}} a new SIP authentication {{scheme based on}} Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol, but Huang and Wei (2006) found that Yang et al.’s scheme has high computational costs and {{proposed a}}n efficient SIP scheme. To improve the efficiency, Durlanik and Sogukpinar (2005) and Wu et al. (2009) also proposed SIP authentication protocols using the Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), respectively. Unfortunately, Yang et al.’s and Huang et al.’s schemes suffer from the off-line password guessing attack (Jo et al. 2009), while Durlanik et al.’s and Wu et al.’s schemes are vulnerable to the Denning-Sacco <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> the off-line password guessing attack (Yoon et al. 2010 b). Yoon et al. (2010 b) presented an improved scheme to overcome these weaknesses. But Liu and Koenig pointed out that Yoon et al.’s SIP authentication scheme is still insecure against the off-line password guessing <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> the insider <b>attack</b> (Liu <b>and</b> Koenig 2011). Applying one-way hash function and the fast logic operations like exclusive-or, Tsai (2009) proposed a nonce based SIP authentication scheme. Later on, Yoon et al. (2010 a) demonstrated that their scheme is vulnerable to Denning-Sacco attack, off-line password guessing <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> stolen-verifier <b>attack,</b> <b>and</b> proposed a new SIP authentication scheme. In 2012, Xie (2012) demonstrated that Yoon et al.’s scheme is still vulnerable to stolen-verifier <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> off-line password guessing <b>attack,</b> <b>and</b> proposed an improvement of Yoon et al.’s scheme, but Farash and Attari (2013) found that Xie’s protocol is also insecure against impersonation <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> off-line password guessing <b>attack,</b> <b>and</b> then they proposed an improved scheme to resolve these problems.|$|R

30|$|But why {{consider}} constructions such as (2) metaphorical? Because {{the existence}} of (at least) two levels of meaning is presupposed in these types of expressions. As stated earlier, both in English and in Spanish the natural way to codify processes like <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> remove, as in (1), is through verbs. But in (2) both of these processes are realized with nouns (<b>attack</b> <b>and</b> removal respectively) rather than with verbs. Thus, the nominal groups the <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> the removal originate from verbs. Therefore, each of these nouns carries at least two levels of meaning in its syntactical/semantic configuration: that of the processes to <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> to remove, on the one hand, {{and that of the}} action <b>and</b> result of <b>attacking</b> <b>and</b> removing, on the other. An example of a derivational relationship between a surface form and its corresponding underlying form, which together make up a grammatical metaphor, is given in (3).|$|R
