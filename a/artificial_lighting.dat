5|$|<b>Artificial</b> <b>lighting</b> discourages nesting and {{interferes with}} the hatchlings' ability to {{navigate}} to the water's edge. Females prefer nesting on beaches free of <b>artificial</b> <b>lighting.</b> On developed beaches, nests are often clustered around tall buildings, perhaps because they block out the man-made light sources. Loggerhead hatchlings are drawn toward the brighter area over the water which is the consequence of the reflection of moon and star light. Confused by the brighter artificial light, they navigate inland, away from the protective waters, which exposes them to dehydration and predation as the sun rises. <b>Artificial</b> <b>lighting</b> causes {{tens of thousands of}} hatchling deaths per year.|$|E

5|$|The air pistol {{range is}} the same as the air rifle range, giving each shooter a table, a 1metre wide firing point, and a 10-metre {{distance}} between the firing line and the target line. The current rules require ranges to be built indoors, with specified minimum requirements for <b>artificial</b> <b>lighting.</b> Many of the top-level competitions are held at temporary ranges installed in versatile sporting facilities or convention centres.|$|E
50|$|<b>Artificial</b> <b>light</b> {{at night}} {{is one of}} the most obvious {{physical}} changes that humans have made to the biosphere, and is the easiest form of pollution to observe from space. The main environmental impacts of <b>artificial</b> <b>light</b> are due to light's use as an information source (rather than an energy source). The hunting efficiency of visual predators generally increases under <b>artificial</b> <b>light,</b> changing predator prey interactions. <b>Artificial</b> <b>light</b> also affects dispersal, orientation, migration, and hormone levels, resulting in disrupted circadian rhythms.|$|R

50|$|Some {{greenhouse}} products, like flowers, {{are grown}} by using <b>artificial</b> <b>light</b> during the night. This <b>artificial</b> <b>light</b> causes so-called light {{pollution in the}} environment of the greenhouse. When a greenhouse roof consists of a well designed optical switch the greenhouse roof becomes reflective during the night, which keeps the <b>artificial</b> <b>light</b> inside the greenhouse. As a side effect there are less number of lights needed since the roof acts as an efficient mirror.|$|R
5|$|<b>Artificial</b> <b>lighting</b> of {{any sort}} was largely absent during the {{industrial}} development of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Using candles or oil lamps to illuminate a textile factory was costly, and economically unsound. With the advent of industrial means of production, not only were new textile halls physically larger, but they also had to be lit more brightly {{for longer periods of}} time. Driven by great demand, and made possible through Lavoisier's theoretical work regarding the role of oxygen in combustion, the end of the 18th century saw a continuous series of improvements in lighting technology.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{occurred}} during October and November 1998 in the Dallas, Texas area. The producers initially wanted to film in Falls City, Nebraska, where the real-life events had taken place; however, budget constraints meant that principal photography had {{to occur in}} Texas. The film's cinematography uses dim and <b>artificial</b> <b>lighting</b> throughout and was influenced {{by a variety of}} styles, including neorealism and the films of Martin Scorsese, while the soundtrack consisted primarily of country, blues, and rock music from the film. The film's themes, which have been explored by many scholars, include the nature of romantic and platonic relationships, the causes of violence against LGBT people, transgender people and the gender binary, and the relationship among social class, race, and gender.|$|E
5|$|The Coastal Discovery Museum, in {{conjunction}} with the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, patrols the beaches from May through October as part of the Sea Turtle Protection Project. The purpose of the project is to inventory and monitor nesting locations, and if necessary, move them to more suitable locations. During the summer months, the museum sponsors the Turtle Talk & Walk, which is a special tour designed to educate the public about this endangered species. To protect loggerhead sea turtles, a town ordinance stipulates that <b>artificial</b> <b>lighting</b> must be shielded so that it cannot be seen from the beach, or it must be turned off by 10:00p.m. from May 1 to October 31 each year.|$|E

40|$|Open Access journalMany marine {{ecosystems}} {{are shaped by}} regimes of natural light guiding the behaviour of their constituent species. As evidenced from terrestrial systems, the global introduction of nighttime lighting is likely influencing these behaviours, restructuring marine ecosystems, and compromising the services they provide. Yet {{the extent to which}} marine habitats are exposed to <b>artificial</b> <b>light</b> at night is unknown. We quantified nightime <b>artificial</b> <b>light</b> across the world's network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). <b>Artificial</b> <b>light</b> is widespread and increasing in a large percentage of MPAs. While increases are more common among MPAs associated with human activity, <b>artificial</b> <b>light</b> is encroaching into a large proportion of even those marine habitats protected with the strongest legislative designations.

5|$|When sandhoppers (such as Talitrus saltator) {{are taken}} up a beach, they easily {{find their way}} {{back down to the}} sea. It has been shown that this is not simply by moving {{downhill}} or towards the sight or sound of the sea. A group of sandhoppers were acclimatised to a day/night cycle under <b>artificial</b> <b>lighting,</b> whose timing was gradually changed until it was 12 hours out of phase with the natural cycle. Then, the sandhoppers were placed on the beach in natural sunlight. They moved away from the sea, up the beach. The experiment implied that the sandhoppers use the sun and their internal clock to determine their heading, and that they had learnt the actual direction down to the sea on their particular beach.|$|E
5|$|P. schultzi {{does not}} respond to prey if the light is under 100lux (like a {{restaurant}} with only subdued <b>artificial</b> <b>lighting),</b> but responds to prey at distances from 6 to 10centimetres as the light level increases. A test suggested that P. schultzi′s hunting is stimulated only by vision, as prey close but hidden caused no response. A preliminary check showed that lures got the same responses from P. schultzi as live prey, and then more detailed testing with the lures showed that: if the target moved erratically, P. schultzi did not pursue it; if the target was totally stationary, the spider approached very slow (between 5 and 100millimetres per minute), with very long pauses in the final stages, and the sequence was not completed in 43% of cases; if the lure jiggled on the same spot, P. schultzi approached much faster and the sequence was almost always completed; if a lure was pulled directly away from P. schultzi, the spider followed, and faster if the lure was pulled, up to a limit (P. schultzi generally moves very slowly).|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} mainly shot on Kodak Vision3 250D film stock. Scenes where Oscar is alive were {{shot in the}} super 35 format with Arricam LT cameras, and the rest in super 16 with an Aaton XTR Prod. The cinematographer was Benoît Debie, who also shot Irréversible. As in Irréversible, Noé was {{reluctant}} to use <b>artificial</b> <b>lighting</b> that would destroy the illusion if the camera was turned around. Thanks to Tokyo's many neon signs, very little additional lighting was required for the exterior scenes, {{despite the fact that}} many were shot late at night. For the interior scenes Debie mainly used practical, in-frame light sources. Some exceptions were made. One was that the moods of the characters were meant to be indicated by different colours, ranging from orange to purple with occasional greens. For this, Debie used a set of red, green, and blue programmable disco lights, which allowed for all different hues. The disco lights were easy to hide. They were also used for simulation of neon flashes, and to add a tint of red to the dressing-room scenes. Another exception was the use of strobe lights, which were programmed together with the coloured lights. Blue colour was avoided throughout, since the filmmakers did not associate it with dreams. Noé was the film's camera operator, except for a few shots of Oscar running in the streets, as they required a taller cameraman. In those scenes, the camera was held by Debie.|$|E
40|$|Underwater optical environments {{are seriously}} {{affected}} by various optical inputs, such as <b>artificial</b> <b>light,</b> sky light, and ambient scattered light. The latter two can block underwater object segmentation tasks, since they inhibit {{the emergence of}} objects of interest and distort image information, while <b>artificial</b> <b>light</b> can contribute to segmentation. <b>Artificial</b> <b>light</b> often focuses on the object of interest, and, therefore, we can initially identify the region of target objects if the collimation of <b>artificial</b> <b>light</b> is recognized. Based on this concept, we propose an optical feature extraction, calculation, and decision method to identify the collimated region of <b>artificial</b> <b>light</b> as a candidate object region. Then, the second phase employs a level set method to segment the objects of interest within the candidate region. This two-phase structure largely removes background noise and highlights the outline of underwater objects. We test {{the performance of the}} method with diverse underwater datasets, demonstrating that it outperforms previous methods...|$|R

5|$|The {{northern}} mockingbird is {{a species that}} is found in both urban and rural habitats. There are now more {{northern mockingbird}}s living in urban habitats than non-urban environments, so they are consequently known as an urban-positive species. Biologists have long questioned how northern mockingbirds adapt to a novel environment in cities, and whether they fall into the typical ecological traps that are common for urban-dwelling birds. A comparative study between an urban dwelling population and a rural dwelling one shows that the apparent survival is higher for individuals in the urban habitats. Lower food availability and travel costs {{may account for the}} higher mortality rate in rural habitats. Urban birds are more likely to return to the nest where they had successfully bred the previous year and avoid those where breeding success was low. One explanation for this phenomenon is that urban environments are more predictable than non-urban ones, as the site fidelity among urban birds prevents them from ecological traps. Mockingbirds are also able to utilize <b>artificial</b> <b>lighting</b> in order to feed nestlings in urban areas such as residential neighborhoods into the night in contrast to those that do not nest near those areas. The adaptation of mockingbirds in urban habitats has led it to become more susceptible to lead poisoning in Baltimore and Washington, D.C. populations.|$|E
