The director described {{the scale of}} the film, [...] "My producers don't like me saying it, but it's really a big-budget experimental film about the many different lives one person can live, depending on the choices he makes.

What's interesting is to be alive." ...|$|E
2500|$|If this {{election}} campaign has proved anything, it is this: Labor has completely lost its way on policy – and the Liberals <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>good</b> at politics ... However, after 12 years, Labor's sustained policy failures should count {{for more than}} five weeks' incompetent Liberal campaigning. If anything, the fact that spin-driven Labor has shown that it is vastly better at politics is of itself a reason to chuck them out.|$|E
