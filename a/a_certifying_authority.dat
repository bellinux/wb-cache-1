40|$|In 2001, Boneh, Lynn, and Shacham {{presented}} a pairing-based signature scheme {{known as the}} BLS signature scheme. In 2003, Boneh, Gentry, Lynn, and Shacham presented the first aggregate signature scheme called the BGLS aggregate signature scheme. The BGLS scheme allows for N users with N signatures to combine their signatures into a single signature. The size of the resulting signature is independent of N. The BGLS signature scheme enjoys roughly {{the same level of}} security as the BLS scheme. In 2005, Waters {{presented a}} pairing-based signature scheme which does not assume the existence of random oracles. In 2007, Lu, Ostrovsky, Sahai, Shacham, and Waters presented the LOSSW aggregate signature scheme which does not assume the existence of random oracles. The BLS, BGLS, Waters, and LOSSW authors each chose to work with a restricted class of pairings. In each scheme, {{it is clear that the}} scheme extend to arbitrary pairings. We present the schemes in their full generality, explore variations of the schemes, and discuss optimizations that can be made when using specific pairings. Each of the schemes we discuss is secure assuming that the computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) assumption holds. We improve on the security reduction for a variation of the BGLS signature scheme which allows for some restrictions of the BGLS signature scheme can be dropped and provides a stronger guarantee of security. We show that the BGLS scheme can be modified to reduce public-key size in presence of <b>a</b> <b>certifying</b> <b>authority,</b> when a certain type of pairing is used.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with security in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). MANETs have unique characteristics and constraints that make traditional approaches to security inadequate.

40|$|Abstract — Digital {{communication}} {{has seen}} exponential {{growth in the}} past decade. Consequently, the security of digital data has become a field of extensive research since piracy and unauthorized use of such data is prevalent because of {{the ease with which}} data can be replicated or tampered. Visual Cryptography (VC) is a special cryptographic technique where decryption is done by an authorized user by simply overlaying the shares. Thus, there is no requirement for complex computations unlike normal cryptography. Though simple for an authorized user, it is equally difficult for an unauthorized user to attack since the secret message can be deciphered if and only if all the shares are available to the attacker. The probability of this is negligibly small since one of the shares usually needs to be registered with <b>a</b> <b>Certified</b> <b>Authority</b> (CA). The procedure is non- intrusive and does not alter the contents of the host image or video. For this reason, VC has been applied to image watermarking widely. In case of video watermarking applications, robustness against different types of attacks like frame attacks, spatial and temporal desynchronization attacks, statistical analysis and collusion attacks need to be considered. Also creation of shares for videos requires feature extraction techniques which are different from that of images. Moreover, as size of video is more, a large secret payload can be used to construct a share. In this survey paper, the research being carried out globally on VC techniques for videos, along with their pros and cons have been highlighted. The paper also discusses challenges in applying VC for video watermarking. Further, a performance comparison amongst the mentioned schemes is also provided...|$|R

30|$|At step (1), a {{challenge}} message {{with a fresh}} nonce is issued to a platform (in this case, the TED) to attest its identity and integrity with the application service. Once this message is received, the TED platform at step (2) calls a TPM function to generate an Attestation Identity Key (AIK) and the TPM credentials. These credentials, along with other credentialsa the public part of the AIK and the original challenge nonce are signed by the private TPM Endorsement Key. The resulting signed credential is then encrypted using the public part of the <b>certifying</b> <b>authority’s</b> key. This is then sent at step (3) to the <b>certifying</b> <b>authority</b> as <b>a</b> request to validate its credentials. If successful, the <b>certifying</b> <b>authority</b> creates <b>a</b> signed, encrypted credential that is {{sent back to the}} platform at step (4). Step (5) is used to produce an encrypted summary of measurements of the environment held in sealed storage (the Platform Configuration Registers, or PCR) in the TPM chip. (e.g. one measurement may be a list of loaded and running processes just after boot, another measurement may be a new list of running processes several hours after boot). This encrypted measurement information is then sent back to the challenger, along with the identity credential received from the <b>certifying</b> <b>authority</b> at step (6). Upon reception of the message, the challenging application service now validates at step (7) the measured environment and compares it to its own expected measurements that it holds. During this process, the challenging application service checks the identity credential to determine that it was signed by the <b>certifying</b> <b>authority,</b> as well as verifying the signature of the measured values and that it contains the original challenge nonce. Depending on the application requirements, step (8) may optionally be used to signal to the application client the success of the measurement and attestation process.|$|R
