40|$|In {{this article}} we focus on how to combine {{important}} sampling techniques within Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, particularly the Gibbs sampler. We propose a way for constructing a change of measure {{with respect to the}} intractable target joint distribution of the sampler by employing proper augmenting functions of the conditional distributions. The <b>almost</b> <b>certain</b> <b>convergence</b> of the estimates under the new measure will be proved, and it will be shown that, under the new measure, the variance of the Monte Carlo integration can be reduced. More interestingly, the change of measure induces a modification of the Markov chain generated by the sampler and, for a proper choice of the important sampling function, the new chain will show better mixing properties than the original. This is all illustrated in an application to the smoothing of the underlying conditional variance in a stochastic volatility model. ...|$|E

Consider a {{sequence}} of independent random elements {Vn, n> in a real separable normed linear space (assumed to be a Banach space {{in most of the}} results), and sequences of con-stants {a,, n> and {ha, n with 0 to obey a general strong law of large numbers of the form aj(Vj EVj) /bn [...] > 0 almost certainly. The hypotheses involve the distributions of the j=l {V,, n>}, the growth behaviors of {a n> and {bn, n>}, and for some of the results impose a geometric condition on X. Moreover, Feller’s classical result generalizing Marcinkiewiez-Zygmund strong law of large numbers is shown to hold for random elements in a real separable Rademacher type p (1 < p < 2) Banach space.

40|$|Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) -based {{algorithms}} {{have become}} increasingly popular due to their lower computational complexity as compared with other path planning algorithms. The recently presented RRT* motion planning algorithm improves upon the original RRT algorithm by providing optimal path solutions. While RRT determines an initial collision-free path fairly quickly, RRT* guarantees <b>almost</b> <b>certain</b> <b>convergence</b> to an optimal, obstacle-free path from the start to the goal points for any given geometrical environment. However, the main limitations of RRT* include its slow processing rate and high memory consumption, due to {{the large number of}} iterations required for calculating the optimal path. In order to overcome these limitations, we present another improvement, i. e, the Triangular Geometerized-RRT* (TGRRT*) algorithm, which utilizes triangular geometrical methods to improve the performance of the RRT* algorithm in terms of the processing time and a decreased number of iterations required for an optimal path solution. Simulations comparing the performance results of the improved TG-RRT* with RRT* are presented to demonstrate the overall improvement in performance and optimal path detection.
