25|$|Starch is 25% amylose and 75% <b>amylopectin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Glutinous rice is {{distinguished}} from {{other types of}} rice by having no (or negligible amounts of) amylose, and high amounts of <b>amylopectin</b> (the two components of starch). <b>Amylopectin</b> {{is responsible for the}} sticky quality of glutinous rice. The difference has been traced to a single mutation that was selected for by farmers.|$|E
25|$|Starch or amylum is a {{polysaccharide}} {{produced by}} all green plants as an energy store. Pure starch is a white, tasteless and odourless powder. It {{consists of two}} types of molecules: the linear and helical amylose and the branched <b>amylopectin.</b> Depending on the plant, starch generally contains 20 to 25% amylose and 75 to 80% <b>amylopectin</b> by weight.|$|E
25|$|Highly {{branched}} cyclic dextrin is a dextrin {{produced from}} enzymatic {{breaking of the}} <b>amylopectin</b> in clusters and using branching enzyme to form large cyclic chains.|$|E
25|$|Amylodextrin is {{a linear}} dextrin or short chained amylose (DP 20-30) {{that can be}} {{produced}} by enzymatic hydrolysis of the alpha-1,6 glycosidic bonds or debranching <b>amylopectin.</b> Amylodextrin colors blue with iodine.|$|E
25|$|The {{varieties}} of rice are typically classified as long-, medium-, and short-grained. The grains of long-grain rice (high in amylose) tend {{to remain intact}} after cooking; medium-grain rice (high in <b>amylopectin)</b> becomes more sticky. Medium-grain rice is used for sweet dishes, for risotto in Italy, and many rice dishes, such as arròs negre, in Spain. Some {{varieties of}} long-grain rice that are high in <b>amylopectin,</b> known as Thai Sticky rice, are usually steamed. A stickier medium-grain rice is used for sushi; the stickiness allows rice to hold its shape when molded. Medium-grain rice is used extensively in Japan, including to accompany savoury dishes, where it is usually served plain in a separate dish. Short-grain rice is often used for rice pudding.|$|E
25|$|While {{there are}} close to 4,000 {{varieties}} of potato, it has been bred into many standard or well-known varieties, {{each of which has}} particular agricultural or culinary attributes. In general, varieties are categorized into a few main groups, such as russets, reds, whites, yellows (also called Yukons) and purples—based on common characteristics. Around 80 varieties are commercially available in the UK. For culinary purposes, varieties are often differentiated by their waxiness. Floury, or mealy (baking) potatoes have more starch (20–22%) than waxy (boiling) potatoes (16–18%). The distinction may also arise from variation in the comparative ratio of two potato starch compounds: amylose and <b>amylopectin.</b> Amylose, a long-chain molecule, diffuses from the starch granule when cooked in water, and lends itself to dishes where the potato is mashed. Varieties that contain a slightly higher <b>amylopectin</b> content, a highly branched molecule, help the potato retain its shape when boiled.|$|E
25|$|Apicomplexans are a {{group of}} alveolates. Like the helicosproidia, they're parasitic, and have a nonphotosynthetic {{chloroplast}}. They were {{once thought to be}} related to the helicosproidia, but it is now known that the helicosproida are green algae rather than part of the CASH lineage. The apicomplexans include Plasmodium, the malaria parasite. Many apicomplexans keep a vestigial red algal derived chloroplast called an apicoplast, which they inherited from their ancestors. Other apicomplexans like Cryptosporidium have lost the chloroplast completely. Apicomplexans store their energy in <b>amylopectin</b> granules that are located in their cytoplasm, even though they are nonphotosynthetic.|$|E
25|$|Glycogen is the {{analogue}} of starch, a glucose polymer that {{functions as}} energy storage in plants. It has a structure similar to <b>amylopectin</b> (a component of starch), but is more extensively branched and compact than starch. Both are white powders in their dry state. Glycogen {{is found in}} the form of granules in the cytosol/cytoplasm in many cell types, and {{plays an important role in}} the glucose cycle. Glycogen forms an energy reserve that can be quickly mobilized to meet a sudden need for glucose, but one that is less compact than the energy reserves of triglycerides (lipids).|$|E
2500|$|... (Alpha) Limit dextrin {{is a short}} chained {{branched}} <b>amylopectin</b> remnant, {{produced by}} hydrolysis of <b>amylopectin</b> with alpha amylase.|$|E
2500|$|... (Beta) Limit dextrin is the {{remaining}} polymer produced by enzymatic hydrolysis of <b>amylopectin</b> with beta amylase, which cannot hydrolyse the alpha-1,6 bonds at branch points.|$|E
2500|$|... γ-Amylase (...) (alternative names: Glucan 1,4-α-glucosidase; amyloglucosidase; Exo-1,4-α-glucosidase; glucoamylase; {{lysosomal}} α-glucosidase; 1,4-α-D-glucan glucohydrolase) will cleave α(1–6) glycosidic linkages, {{as well as}} {{the last}} α(1–4)glycosidic linkages at the nonreducing end of amylose and <b>amylopectin,</b> yielding glucose. The γ-amylase has most acidic optimum pH of all amylases because it is most active around pH 3.|$|E
2500|$|The α-amylases (...) (CAS# 9014-71-5) (alternative names: 1,4-α-D-glucan glucanohydrolase; glycogenase) are calcium metalloenzymes. [...] By acting {{at random}} {{locations}} along the starch chain, α-amylase breaks down long-chain carbohydrates, ultimately yielding maltotriose and maltose from amylose, or maltose, glucose and [...] "limit dextrin" [...] from <b>amylopectin.</b> [...] Because it can act {{anywhere on the}} substrate, α-amylase tends to be faster-acting than β-amylase. [...] In animals, {{it is a major}} digestive enzyme, and its optimum pH is 6.7–7.0.|$|E
2500|$|Waxy potato {{varieties}} produce {{two main}} kinds of potato starch, amylose and <b>amylopectin,</b> {{the latter of}} which is most industrially useful. The German chemical company BASF created the Amflora potato, which has been modified to contain antisense against the enzyme that drives synthesis of amylose, namely granule bound starch synthase. [...] This resulting potato almost exclusively produces <b>amylopectin,</b> and thus is more useful for the starch industry. In 2010, the European Commission {{cleared the way for}} 'Amflora' to be grown in the European Union for industrial purposes only—not for food. Nevertheless, under EU rules, individual countries have the right to decide whether they will allow this potato to be grown on their territory. Commercial planting of 'Amflora' was expected in the Czech Republic and Germany in the spring of 2010, and Sweden and the Netherlands in subsequent years. Another GM potato variety developed by BASF is 'Fortuna' which was made resistant to late blight by adding two resistance genes, blb1 and blb2, which originate from the Mexican wild potato Solanum bulbocastanum. [...] In October 2011 BASF requested cultivation and marketing approval as a feed and food from the EFSA. In 2012, GMO development in Europe was stopped by BASF.|$|E
2500|$|The largest {{collection}} of rice cultivars is at the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines, with over 100,000 rice accessions held in the International Rice Genebank. Rice cultivars are often classified by their grain shapes and texture. For example, Thai Jasmine rice is long-grain and relatively less sticky, as some long-grain rice contains less <b>amylopectin</b> than short-grain cultivars. Chinese restaurants often serve long-grain as plain unseasoned steamed rice though short-grain rice is common as well. Japanese mochi rice and Chinese sticky rice are short-grain. Chinese people use sticky rice which is properly known as [...] "glutinous rice" [...] (note: glutinous refer to the glue-like characteristic of rice; does not refer to [...] "gluten") to make zongzi. The Japanese table rice is a sticky, short-grain rice. Japanese sake rice is another kind as well.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Amylopectin</b> of the aewx mutants had an {{increased}} proportion of long B-chains and a decreased proportion of short B-chains compared with wx <b>amylopectin,</b> whereas <b>amylopectin</b> of the dull waxy (duwx) mutant had a decreased proportion of long B-chains and {{an increased}} proportion of short B-chains, thus confirming the novel nature of aewx and duwx <b>amylopectin.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... (Alpha) Limit dextrin {{is a short}} chained {{branched}} <b>amylopectin</b> remnant, {{produced by}} hydrolysis of <b>amylopectin</b> with alpha amylase.|$|E
50|$|Glycogen and <b>amylopectin</b> {{have similar}} structure, but the former has about one branch point per ten 1,4-alpha bonds, {{compared}} to about one branch point per thirty 1,4-alpha bonds in <b>amylopectin.</b> <b>Amylopectin</b> is synthesized from ADP-glucose while mammals and fungi synthesize glycogen from UDP-glucose; for most cases, bacteria synthesize glycogen from ADP-glucose (analogous to starch).|$|E
5000|$|Waxy {{potato starch}} {{is a new}} species of starch only {{containing}} <b>amylopectin</b> molecules, extracted from new potato varieties. Standard starch extracted from traditional potato varieties contains both amylose and <b>amylopectin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Amylose and <b>amylopectin</b> {{are both}} {{components}} of starch and polysaccharides made from D-glucose units. The {{big difference between}} the two is that amylose is linear because it only has αlpha-1,4-glycosidic bonds. <b>Amylopectin</b> on the other hand, is a branched polysaccharide because it has αlpha-1,4-glycosidic bonds with occasional αlpha-1,6-glycosidic bonds approximately every 22 D-glucose units. Glutinous rice is nearly 100% composed of <b>amylopectin</b> (one of the two components that makes up starch) and almost completely lacks its counterpart, amylose, in its starch granules. A non-glutinous rice grain contains amylose at about 10-30% weight by weight and <b>amylopectin</b> at about 70-90% weight by weight.|$|E
5000|$|Limit {{dextrinase}} ( [...] , R-enzyme, amylopectin-1,6-glucosidase, dextrin alpha-1,6-glucanohydrolase) is {{an enzyme}} with systematic name dextrin 6-alpha-glucanohydrolase. This enzyme catalyses the Hydrolysis of (1->6)-alpha-D-glucosidic linkages in alpha- and beta-limits dextrins of <b>amylopectin</b> and glycogen,in <b>amylopectin</b> and pullulan.|$|E
50|$|The starch {{of normal}} dent maize is characterised by a content of about 25% amylose with the {{remainder}} being <b>amylopectin</b> and the intermediate fraction (see 3.5 Biochemistry). But these percentages vary among cultivars and with kernel development. For example, amylose percentage ranged from 20 to 36% for 399 cultivars of normal maize. There are maize germplasm collected that range from less than 20 to 100% complement of <b>amylopectin.</b> And waxy maize contains 100% <b>amylopectin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Because {{the long}} linear chains of amylose more readily {{crystallize}} than <b>amylopectin</b> (which has short, highly branched chains), high-amylose starch is {{more resistant to}} digestion. Unlike <b>amylopectin,</b> amylose is not soluble in cold water. It also reduces the crystallinity of <b>amylopectin</b> and how easily water can infiltrate the starch. The higher the amylose content, the less expansion potential and the lower the gel strength for the same starch concentration. This can be countered partially by increasing the granule size.|$|E
50|$|Starch plays a {{major role}} in the {{degradation}} of croissants during storage. <b>Amylopectin</b> retrogradation occurs over several days to weeks, as amorphous <b>amylopectin</b> chains are realigned into a more crystalline structure. The transformation of the starch causes undesirable firmness in the croissant. Additionally, the formation of the crystal structure of <b>amylopectin</b> requires the incorporation of water. Starch retrogradation actively draws water from the amorphous gluten network and some of the amorphous starch fraction, which reduces the plasticity of both.|$|E
50|$|In 1922, another researcher, P. Weatherwax of Indiana University in Bloomington, {{reported}} that the starch in waxy maize was entirely of a “rare” form called “erythrodextrin”, known today as <b>amylopectin.</b> He found that this rare starch stained red with iodine, in contrast to normal starch which stained blue. Bates, French et al. and Sprague, Brimhall, et al. confirmed that endosperm starch of waxy maize consists nearly exclusively of <b>amylopectin.</b> The presence of <b>amylopectin</b> in rice had been demonstrated previously by Parnell.|$|E
5000|$|The high <b>amylopectin</b> {{content of}} waxy or glutinous {{starches}} is genetically {{controlled by the}} waxy or wax gene. Its quality of greater viscosity and gelation {{is dependent on the}} distribution of the <b>amylopectin</b> unit chains. Grains that have this gene are considered mutants, which explains why most of them are selectively bred to create a grain that is close to having or has a 0% amylose content. The table below summarizes the amylose and <b>amylopectin</b> content of different starches, waxy and non-waxy: ...|$|E
50|$|This enzyme also readily hydrolyses <b>amylopectin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Starch is 25% amylose and 75% <b>amylopectin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Japonica rice grains are rounder, thicker, and harder, {{compared}} to longer, thinner, and fluffier Indica rice grains. Japonica rice is also stickier {{due to the}} higher content of <b>amylopectin,</b> whereas Indica rice starch consists of less <b>amylopectin</b> and more amylose. Japonica rice plants are shorter than Indica rice plants.|$|E
50|$|As {{early as}} in 1956, it was stated that <b>amylopectin</b> {{contained}} three {{different types of}} chains. In each macromolecule there is one C-chain, which carries the only reducing group. The B-chains {{are linked to the}} macromolecules linked by their potential reducing group, and may contain one or more A-chains that are similarly linked. The ratio of A-B chains (1:1 to 1,5:1) {{is a measure of the}} degree of multiple branching and is an important property describing <b>amylopectin.</b> Nevertheless, the exact arrangement of chains within the <b>amylopectin</b> molecule is still not clear.|$|E
