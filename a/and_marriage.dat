5|$|The novel {{takes place}} during the Bourbon Restoration, which brought {{profound}} changes to French society; the struggle by individuals to secure a higher social status is a major theme in the book.

5|$|A Confession of Faith {{to replace}} the Thirty-Nine Articles was begun in August 1646. While there is little record {{of the actions of}} the Assembly during the writing of the Confession, it is clear that there were {{significant}} debates in the Assembly over almost every doctrine found in it. The Confession was printed and sent to Parliament in December. The House of Commons requested scripture citations be added to the Confession, which were provided in April 1648. Parliament approved the Confession with revisions to the chapters on church censures, synods and councils, <b>and</b> <b>marriage</b> on 20June 1648. The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland had already adopted the Confession without revision in 1647. The restoration of Charles II in 1660 effectively made this legislation a nullity.|$|E
5|$|A {{member of}} the Whadjuk Noongar people, Yagan belonged to a tribe of around 60 people whose name, {{according}} to Robert Lyon, was Beeliar. Scholars now believe that the Beeliar people {{may have been a}} family subgroup (or clan) of a larger tribe whom Daisy Bates called Beelgar. According to Lyon, the Beeliar people occupied the land south of the Swan and Canning rivers, as far south as Mangles Bay. The group had customary land usage rights over a much larger area than this, extending north as far as Lake Monger and northeast to the Helena River. The group also had an unusual degree of freedom to move over their neighbours' land, possibly due to kinship <b>and</b> <b>marriage</b> ties with neighbouring groups.|$|E

He was soon romantically linked to Italian sports pundit, journalist and television host Ilaria D'Amico. In 2015, Buffon announced that the couple were expecting a child together.

5|$|For most girls, {{childhood}} {{came to an}} {{end with}} the onset of puberty, which was followed shortly after by betrothal <b>and</b> <b>marriage.</b> Although marriage arranged by the family was the norm, romantic love was not unknown. Most women bore many children but few survived infancy, and grief for the loss of a loved one was an inalienable part of life. The main form of birth control was abstinence, and while there is evidence of contraception it seems to have been mainly used by prostitutes.|$|E

5|$|Racial {{tensions}} increased {{after the}} United States Supreme Court's 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education to end segregation in public education, which it ruled as unconstitutional. Many segregationists believed the ruling {{would lead to}} interracial dating <b>and</b> <b>marriage.</b> Whites strongly resisted the court's ruling; one Virginia county closed all its public schools to prevent integration. Other jurisdictions simply ignored the ruling. In other ways, whites used stronger measures to keep blacks politically disenfranchised, {{which they had been}} {{since the turn of the}} century. Segregation in the South was used to constrain blacks forcefully from any semblance of social equality.|$|E
5|$|Shakespeare {{also uses}} sub-plots {{to offer a}} clearer view {{of the actions of}} the main characters. For example, when the play begins, Romeo is in love with Rosaline, who has refused all of his advances. Romeo's infatuation with her stands in obvious {{contrast}} to his later love for Juliet. This provides a comparison through which the audience can see the seriousness of Romeo and Juliet's love <b>and</b> <b>marriage.</b> Paris' love for Juliet also sets up a contrast between Juliet's feelings for him and her feelings for Romeo. The formal language she uses around Paris, as well as the way she talks about him to her Nurse, show that her feelings clearly lie with Romeo. Beyond this, the sub-plot of the Montague–Capulet feud overarches the whole play, providing an atmosphere of hate that is the main contributor to the play's tragic end.|$|E

The book investigates her controversial religious imagery and her erotic productions, Erotica, Sex, and Body of Evidence. The book describes a mellowing in her appearance and provocativeness, and, among other things, the release of her next several albums, her Golden Globe Award-winning musical film portrayal of Eva Peron, and her high-grossing Drowned World Tour. The births of daughter Lourdes and son Rocco, and her marriage to second husband Guy Ritchie, are chronicled.|$|E
