5|$|Divided is an American {{television}} {{game show}} broadcast by Game Show Network (GSN) {{based on the}} British series of the same name. Each episode consists of four contestants playing as one team who must agree on <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>questions</b> they are given. The longer it takes the team {{to come to an}} agreement, the less money the team earns for each question. The series, hosted by Mike Richards, premiered January 19, 2017, with some critics believing that the show's name and timing were appropriate given the tumultuous preceding presidential election and its premiere date coming the day before the inauguration.|$|E
5|$|Personal {{interaction}} with the gods took many forms. People who wanted information or advice consulted oracles, run by temples, {{that were supposed to}} convey gods' <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>questions.</b> Amulets and other images of protective deities were used to ward off the demons that might threaten human well-being or to impart the god's positive characteristics to the wearer. Private rituals invoked the gods' power to accomplish personal goals, from healing sickness to cursing enemies. These practices used heka, the same force of magic that the gods used, which the creator was said to have given to humans so they could fend off misfortune. The performer of a private rite often took on the role of a god in a myth, or even threatened a deity, to involve the gods in accomplishing the goal. Such rituals coexisted with private offerings and prayers, and all three were accepted means of obtaining divine help.|$|E

30|$|Each {{table is}} {{provided}} with the topic of each spoken text. The way to determine the correct <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> {{each of the three}} questions is also written under each table. For example, “Q 1 the same expression” means that the correct <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>Question</b> 1 involves the same expression as that used in the spoken text. “Q 2 similar expression” means that the correct <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>Question</b> 2 contains expressions similar to that used in the text. In these cases, it is easier to find the key word. “Q 1 deduction” means that test takers have to deduce what the <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>Question</b> 1 is from the spoken text. Therefore, this type of question is the most difficult.|$|R

25|$|According to Fromm, {{humans have}} {{a need for a}} stable frame of reference. Religion {{apparently}} fills this need. In effect, humans crave <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>questions</b> that no other source of knowledge has an answer to, which only religion may seem to answer. However, a sense of free will must be given in order for religion to appear healthy. An authoritarian notion of religion appears detrimental.|$|E
25|$|Tutu {{expressed}} {{the view that}} Western theology sought <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>questions</b> that Africans were not asking.

HOW DATA WERE COLLECTED The 21 recorded sessions took place between February 2013 and December 2016. Data were collected using Turning Technologies' remote controls (called *clickers*) and TurningPoint software. The 4 versions of the quiz used during these 4 years are provided in the 'quizzes' folder for information purpose (in PDF and Powerpoint formats). Turning Technologies records data in a closed format (. tpzx) that can be exported and converted them into 3 formats provided here (these 3 files contain the same data) : * Excel (. xslx) * Comma-spearated values (. csv) * SQLite (. sqlite) The first one was directly exported from TurningPoint and is provided for Excel users who can't read CSV correctly. CSV was converted from Excel and is provided for non-Excel users. Finally, SQLite is provided in order to apply different sorting and filters to the data. It can be read using SQLite manager for Firefox ([[URL] CODEBOOK Here is the name, the meaning and the possible values of the columns (name - meaning [possible values]).

Finally, for 2 questions only one answer was accepted, but there is not only one correct answer: Q 4 & Q 11. INFORMATION ABOUT THE SESSIONS Except otherwise stated below, all sessions were conducted like the original one: Q 1 to Q 12 (no Q 8 - 9). The original French version of the quiz has been translated into English for a few sessions with Master students. For sessions 14 and 20, Q 5 was removed and Q 8 & Q 9 were merged in Q 8 - 9.

Additional benefits include {{the ability to}} deal with interval, threshold, and continuous data, retaining full information from data with missing values, integrating the latent modeling with measured variables, be they measured environments, or, now, measured molecular genetic markers such as SNPs. In addition, models avoid constraint problems in the crude correlation method: all parameters will lie, as they should, between 0–1 (standardized).|$|E
