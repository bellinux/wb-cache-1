5|$|The {{most common}} {{underlying}} form of thyroid disease associated with TPP is Graves' disease, a syndrome {{due to an}} <b>autoimmune</b> <b>reaction</b> that leads to overproduction of thyroid hormone. TPP has also been described in people with other thyroid problems such as thyroiditis, toxic nodular goiter, toxic adenoma, TSH-producing pituitary adenoma, excessive ingestion of thyroxine or iodine, and amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism.|$|E
5|$|Lambert–Eaton myasthenic {{syndrome}} (LEMS) {{is a rare}} autoimmune disorder {{characterized by}} muscle weakness of the limbs. It {{is the result of}} an <b>autoimmune</b> <b>reaction</b> in which antibodies are formed against presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels, and likely other nerve terminal proteins, in the neuromuscular junction (the connection between nerves and the muscle that they supply). The prevalence is 3.4 cases per million. Around 60% of those with LEMS have an underlying malignancy, most commonly small-cell lung cancer; it is therefore regarded as a paraneoplastic syndrome (a condition that arises as a result of cancer elsewhere in the body).|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1980s, Swiss {{physician}} René Flammer {{discovered an}} antigen within the mushroom that stimulates an <b>autoimmune</b> <b>reaction</b> causing the body's immune cells to consider its own {{red blood cells}} as foreign and attack them. Despite this, {{it was not until}} 1990 that guidebooks firmly warned against eating P.involutus, and one Italian guidebook recommended it as edible in 1998. The relatively rare immunohemolytic syndrome occurs following the repeated ingestion of Paxillus mushrooms. Most commonly it arises when the person has ingested the mushroom {{for a long period of}} time, sometimes for many years, and has shown mild gastrointestinal symptoms on previous occasions. The Paxillus syndrome is better classed as a hypersensitivity reaction than a toxicological reaction as it is caused not by a genuinely poisonous substance but by the antigen in the mushroom. The antigen is still of unknown structure but it stimulates the formation of IgG antibodies in the blood serum. In the course of subsequent meals, antigen-antibody complexes are formed; these complexes attach to the surface of blood cells and eventually lead to their breakdown.|$|E

50|$|Another {{mechanism}} {{which protects}} {{the body from}} <b>autoimmune</b> <b>reactions</b> is the suppression of self-reactive effector T cells by Tregs. Tregs can be generated either in the thymus during the negative selection or in the immune periphery by the mechanisms described above. Those generated in the thymus are called natural Tregs (nTergs) and the ones genereted in the periphery are called induced Tregs (iTregs). Regardless of their origin, once present Tregs use several different mechanisms to suppress <b>autoimmune</b> <b>reactions.</b> These include depletion of IL-2 from the environment and secretion of tolerogenic cytokines IL-10 and TGF-β.|$|R
25|$|Infliximab {{works by}} binding to TNF-α. TNF-α is a {{chemical}} messenger (cytokine) {{and a key}} part of the <b>autoimmune</b> <b>reaction.</b> In rheumatoid arthritis, infliximab seems to work by preventing TNF-α from binding to its receptor in the cell.|$|E
25|$|Chronic {{symptoms}} from an <b>autoimmune</b> <b>reaction</b> {{could explain}} why some symptoms persist even after the spirochetes have been eliminated from the body. This hypothesis may explain why chronic arthritis persists after antibiotic therapy, similar to rheumatic fever, but its wider application is controversial.|$|E
25|$|Another {{theory is}} that people who have {{recovered}} from polio lose remaining healthy neurons at a faster rate than normal. However, little evidence exists to support this idea. Finally, it has been proposed that the initial polio infection causes an <b>autoimmune</b> <b>reaction,</b> in which the body's immune system attacks normal cells as if they were foreign substances. Again, compared to neural fatigue, the evidence supporting this theory is quite limited.|$|E

25|$|The {{cause of}} lichen planus is unknown, {{but it is}} not {{contagious}} and does not involve any known pathogen. It is thought to be a T cell mediated <b>autoimmune</b> <b>reaction</b> (where the body's immune system targets its own tissues). This autoimmune process triggers apoptosis of the epithelial cells. Several cytokines are involved in lichen planus, including tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma, interleukin-1 alpha, interleukin 6, and interleukin 8. This autoimmune, T cell mediated, process is thought to be in response to some antigenic change in the oral mucosa, but a specific antigen has not been identified.|$|E
25|$|If beta {{cells are}} {{destroyed}} by an <b>autoimmune</b> <b>reaction,</b> insulin {{can no longer}} be synthesized or be secreted into the blood. This results in type 1 diabetes mellitus, which is characterized by abnormally high blood glucose concentrations, and generalized body wasting. In type 2 diabetes mellitus the destruction of beta cells is less pronounced than in type 1 diabetes, and is not due to an autoimmune process. Instead there is an accumulation of amyloid in the pancreatic islets, which likely disrupts their anatomy and physiology. The pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes is not well understood but patients exhibit a reduced population of islet beta-cells, reduced secretory function of islet beta-cells that survive and peripheral tissue insulin resistance. Type 2 diabetes is characterized by high rates of glucagon secretion into the blood which are unaffected by, and unresponsive to the concentration of glucose in the blood glucose. Insulin is still secreted into the blood in response to the blood glucose. As a result, the insulin levels, even when the blood sugar level is normal, are much higher than they are in healthy persons. There are a variety of treatment regimens, none of which is entirely satisfactory. When the pancreas’s capacity to secrete insulin can no longer keep the blood sugar level within normal bounds, insulin injections are given.|$|E
500|$|A {{disorder}} {{commonly found}} in Cavaliers is keratoconjunctivitis sicca, colloquially known as [...] "dry eye".

According to the Canine Inherited Disorders Database, the condition requires continual treatment and if untreated may result in partial or total blindness.

40|$|Polycystic ovary {{syndrome}} (PCOS) {{has been}} suggested to be linked with autoimmune processes. Laparoscopic ovarian electrocauterization has the potency to stimulate more <b>autoimmune</b> <b>reactions</b> in PCOS patients. In the present study, we considered anti-nuclear antibodies (ANAs) as the hallmark of <b>autoimmune</b> <b>reactions,</b> and investigated the serum level of these antibodies in 35 patients with PCOS (21 - 38 years old) pre and one-month after electrocauterization, and in 35 fertile healthy women (25 - 35 years old) as the control group. Serum levels of ANAs, as well as ANA subtyping, were investigated using the Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). While 3 out of the 35 patients (8. 6 %) were positive for ANAs before electrocauterization, none of the controls was positive. The number of ANA-positive cases increased following electrocauterization (3 out of 35 [8. 6 %] before vs. 10 out of 35 [28. 6 %] after the procedure). The main ANA subtype in the positive samples was SS-A. The higher ANA level among the PCOS patients suggests association of the disease with <b>autoimmune</b> <b>reactions.</b> Laparoscopic ovarian electrocauterization seems {{to increase the number}} of positive-ANA patients...|$|R
2500|$|Chronic rheumatic {{heart disease}} (RHD) is {{characterized}} by repeated inflammation with fibrinous repair. [...] The cardinal anatomic changes of the valve include leaflet thickening, commissural fusion, and shortening and thickening of the tendinous cords. It is caused by an <b>autoimmune</b> <b>reaction</b> to Group A β-hemolytic streptococci (GAS) that results in valvular damage. Fibrosis and scarring of valve leaflets, commissures and cusps leads to abnormalities that can result in valve stenosis or regurgitation. The inflammation caused by rheumatic fever, usually during childhood, {{is referred to as}} rheumatic valvulitis. About half of patients with rheumatic fever develop inflammation involving valvular endothelium. The majority of morbidity and mortality associated with rheumatic fever is caused by its destructive effects on cardiac valve tissue. The pathogenesis of RHD is complex and not fully understood, but it is known to involve molecular mimicry and genetic predisposition that lead to autoimmune reactions.|$|E
2500|$|Molecular mimicry {{occurs when}} epitopes are shared between host antigens and Streptococcus antigens. This causes an <b>autoimmune</b> <b>reaction</b> against native tissues {{in the heart}} that are {{incorrectly}} recognized as [...] "foreign" [...] due to the cross-reactivity of antibodies generated {{as a result of}} epitope sharing. The valvular endothelium is a prominent site of lymphocyte-induced damage. CD4+ T cells are the major effectors of heart tissue autoimmune reactions in RHD. Normally, T cell activation is triggered by the presentation of bacterial antigens. [...] In RHD, molecular mimicry results in incorrect T cell activation, and these T lymphocytes can go on to activate B cells, which will begin to produce self-antigen-specific antibodies. [...] This leads to an immune response attack mounted against tissues in the heart that have been misidentified as pathogens. [...] Rheumatic valves display increased expression of VCAM-1, a protein that mediates the adhesion of lymphocytes. Self-antigen-specific antibodies generated via molecular mimicry between human proteins and streptococcal antigens up-regulate VCAM-1 after binding to the valvular endothelium. [...] This leads to the inflammation and valve scarring observed in rheumatic valvulitis, mainly due to CD4+ T cell infiltration.|$|E
2500|$|Erosions, {{which involve}} the {{epithelial}} layer, are red in appearance since the underlying lamina propria shows through. When the full {{thickness of the}} epithelium is penetrated (ulceration), the lesion becomes covered with a fibrinous exudate and takes on a yellow-grey color. Because an ulcer is a breach of the normal lining, when seen in cross section, the lesion is a crater. A [...] "halo" [...] may be present, which is a reddening of the surrounding mucosa and is caused by inflammation. There may also be edema (swelling) around the ulcer. Chronic trauma may produce an ulcer with a keratotic (white, thickened mucosa) margin. Malignant lesions may ulcerate either because the tumor infiltrates the mucosa from adjacent tissues, or because the lesion originates within the mucosa itself, and the disorganized growth leads to {{a break in the}} normal architecture of the lining tissues. Repeat episodes of mouth ulcers can be indicative of an immunodeficiency, signaling low levels of immunoglobulin in the oral mucous membranes. Chemotherapy, HIV, and mononucleosis are all causes of immunodeficiency/immunosuppression with which oral ulcers may become a common manifestation. Autoimmunity is also a cause of oral ulceration. Mucous membrane pemphigoid, an <b>autoimmune</b> <b>reaction</b> to the epithelial basement membrane, causes desquamation/ulceration of the oral mucosa.|$|E
