The overall {{scale and}} {{orientation}} of the South African trigonometrical readjustment will depend both on the traditional distances and azimuths and on TRANSIT Doppler observations. The traditional observations are used to compute the relative positions of points within the control network. TRANSIT Doppler observations, as well as giving relative positions, {{can be used to}} determine <b>absolute</b> <b>co-ordinates</b> (in a global reference system) with an accuracy of about one metre. One {{purpose of the present study}} is to present a way of combining the various Doppler observations to the TRANSIT satellites and to derive a single set of geocentric co-ordinates for the stations at which Doppler observations were recorded. Little work has been published concerning the combination of such Doppler observations. Having arrived at a set of geocentric co-ordinates, in order to use them in the horizontal adjustment, they must be transformed to latitude, longitude and height with respect to a defined ellipsoid. The second purpose of the present study is to examine various criteria for choosing such a datum and thereby make a suitable datum selection. There are various ways of processing observations to the TRANSIT satellites; these techniques along with the rest of the Doppler system are described in chapter 3. Chapter 4, which contains the bulk of the work in the present study, addresses the problem of the unification of Doppler subnets into a single geocentric network. Chapter 1 contains an introduction and gives a brief overview of the various reference systems used in Geodesy while Chapter 2, which is largely historical, describes the existing geodetic network in South Africa, particularly the Cape Datum on which this network is computed. In chapter 5, using the co-ordinates for the Doppler stations derived in chapter 4, various criteria are considered for the selection of a datum on which to carry out the readjustment and recommendations are made for a replacement South African geodetic datum...|$|E

40|$|There are {{a handful}} of methods {{currently}} employed to produce three dimensional computer models of the human face. Among these, stereophotogrammetry and laser profiling have been used extensively. Unlike other methods in use the method presented utilizes multiple stereo models of four charge-coupled device (CCD) captured images and for comparative purposes four Rollei 6006 images to cover the whole face. Using a least squares grey level stereomatcher and seedpoints automatically generated, a dense disparity map is produced by a matching process which grows out from the seed points. From camera parameters which are determined by the bundle adjustment method the disparity map is transformed to an <b>absolute</b> <b>co-ordinate</b> system of the control points within the object space. The resulting data set is used to provide surgeons with pre and post surgical management information including profiles of the face, angles and distances between strategic features.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an integrated approach of simulated annealing (SA) and genetic algorithm (GA) for the analogue module placement in mixed-signal integrated circuit layout designs. The proposed algorithm follows the optimization flow {{of a normal}} GA controlled by the methodology of SA. The bit-matrix chromosomal representation is employed to describe the location and the orientation of modules. Compared with the conventional bit-string representation, the proposed chromosomal representation tends to significantly improve the search efficiency. In addition, a slide-based flat scheme is developed to transform an <b>absolute</b> <b>co-ordinate</b> placement of modules to a relative placement. In this way, the symmetry constraints imposed on analogue very large scale integration circuits can be easily fulfilled in the placement run. Use of a radiation-decoder can also drastically shrink the configuration space without degrading search opportunities. The proposed algorithm has been tested with several example circuits. The experiments show this promising algorithm makes the better performance than the simpler SA or GA approaches working alone, {{and the quality of}} the automatically generated layouts is comparable to those done manually...|$|R

40|$|The {{experimental}} results {{of using a}} hybrid platform to mitigate vibration of a batch of high-tech equipment installed in a building subject to nearby traffic-induced ground motion have been presented and discussed in the companion paper. Based on the identified dynamic properties of both {{the building and the}} platform, this paper first establishes an analytical model for hybrid control of the building-platform system subject to ground motion in terms of the <b>absolute</b> <b>co-ordinate</b> to facilitate the absolute velocity feedback control strategy used in the experiment. The traffic-induced ground motion used in the experiment is then employed as input to the analytical model to compute the dynamic response of the building-platform system. The computed results are compared with the measured results, and the comparison is found to be satisfactory. Based on the verified analytical model, coupling effects between the building and platform are then investigated. A parametric study is finally conducted to further assess the performance of both passive and hybrid platforms at microvibration level. The analytical study shows that the dynamic interaction between the building and platform should be taken into consideration. The hybrid control is effective in reducing both velocity response and drift of the platform/high-tech equipment at microvibration level with reasonable control force.

40|$|National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51178406]; State Key Laboratory for Disaster Reduction in Civil Engineering at Tongji University, ChinaSince some {{excitations}} such as earthquakes or wind forces {{cannot be}} accurately measured, {{it is necessary}} to explore algorithms which can integrate structural control and the identification of unknown excitations. In this paper, an algorithm is proposed for the decentralized structural control of tall shear-type buildings under unknown earthquake-induced ground motion. The equations of motion of a tall controlled shear building subject to unknown ground motion are established in the <b>absolute</b> <b>co-ordinate</b> system, in which the ground motion input is applied to the 1 st floor of the building and treated as an unknown external excitation. A decentralized control algorithm based on the instantaneous optimal control scheme is developed with limited measurements of structural absolute acceleration responses. The inter-connection effect between adjacent substructures is treated as 'additional unknown disturbances' at substructural interfaces to each substructure. Instantaneous optimal control forces are obtained by sequentially utilizing a Kalman estimator for the substructural state vector and least square estimation of the 'additional unknown disturbances'. Then, unknown ground motion is subsequently estimated by the Newmark-beta method. To validate the performances of the proposed algorithm, two numerical examples of decentralized control of tall building models under unknown earthquake excitations are studied and the simulation results are compared with those by the conventional centralized control under measured earthquake excitation.

In this paper, an algorithm based on the extended Kalman estimator approach is proposed for the identification of structural parameters and unknown excitation of tall shear-type buildings with only partial measurements of structural absolute acceleration responses. The equation of motion of a tall shear building under ground motion is established in the <b>absolute</b> <b>co-ordinate</b> system, in which the ground-motion input is applied to the 1 st floor of the building as an unknown excitation. Based on substructure approach, the tall building is decomposed into substructures. For each substructure above the 1 st floor, substructural relative responses and parameters are identified by extended Kalman estimator. For the substructure containing the 1 st floor, it is proposed that substructural extended state vector is firstly identified by the extended Kalman estimator and the unknown excitation is subsequently estimated by least-squares estimation. Then, the 1 st story stiffness is estimated based on structural eigenvalue equation and the expansion of the determinate of the structural eigen-matrix. The unknown ground motion is identified by the Newmark-beta method. A numerical simulation example demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed algorithm...|$|R
