5|$|In 1940 Ye Qianyu met {{the dancer}} Dai Ailian in Hong Kong. An {{overseas}} Chinese born in Trinidad, Dai {{had come to}} Hong Kong to support the war effort. Although Dai could not speak Chinese and Ye spoke little English, {{they fell in love}} and got married within a few weeks. Soong Ching-ling, the widow of President Sun Yat-sen, presided over their wedding. Because of a botched surgery in Hong Kong, Dai was unable to have children. According to Ye Qianyu's daughter Mingming, who lived with her father and was initially hostile to her stepmother, Dai treated her <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> her own child.|$|E
25|$|In {{the special}} bonus chapter, Lyra {{has a new}} dream. She was in the Town of Wish, her family was calling for her, but Lyra couldn't hear them over the sound of rushing water. Her body became light <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> floating. Lyra held her breath and fell deeper into that strange dream. Once again, she finds herself alone in another unrecognizable place, a small office in the Barge City, and looks for a magic map.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} of women under Welsh law differed significantly {{to that of}} their Norman-English contemporaries. A marriage could be established in two basic ways. The normal way was that the woman would be given to a man by her kindred; the abnormal way was that the woman could elope with a man {{without the consent of}} her kindred. In this case her kindred could compel her to return if she was still a virgin, but if she was not she could not be compelled to return. If the relationship lasted for seven years she had the same entitlements <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> given by her kin.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{featured}} one of {{the first}} scenes in which Maslany plays multiple characters interacting in the same shot. To construct the scene in which Sarah and Alison meet in the soccer field shed, Maslany and her stunt double Kathryn Alexandre first shot a master version of the scene using a Technodolly, a programmable camera crane that can memorise camera movements. Two versions of the scene were then re-filmed without Alexandre, with Maslany playing each of the characters. To simulate Alison placing her hand on Sarah's shoulder, a grip stand was used in the place of Sarah's shoulder for Maslany to hold when playing Alison, and to simulate Sarah slapping Alison's arm away, Maslany slapped the air when playing Sarah and reacted <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> hit when playing Alison. The final scene was created through digital compositing, whereby both versions of the scene—with Maslany playing both characters separately—are combined to produce a single shot. Maslany felt that, as one of her early attempts at sharing a scene with herself, she over-thought the process: [...] "I think I was trying too hard to get it right. Nobody's there when you're shooting these things, so you overcompensate." ...|$|E
500|$|The 15-year-old King fell {{seriously ill}} in February 1553. His sister Mary {{was invited to}} visit him, the Council doing [...] "duty and obeisance to her <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> Queen of England". The King {{recovered}} somewhat, and in April Northumberland restored Mary's full title and arms as Princess of England, which she had lost in the 1530s. He also kept her informed about Edward's condition. About this time a set of drawn-out marriage negotiations came to conclusion. On 21 May 1553 Guildford Dudley, Northumberland's second youngest son, married Lady Jane Grey, the fervently Protestant daughter of the Duke of Suffolk and, through her mother Frances Brandon, a grandniece of Henry VIII. Her sister Catherine was matched with the heir of the Earl of Pembroke, and another Katherine, Guildford's younger sister, was promised to Henry Hastings, heir of the Earl of Huntingdon. Within a month {{the first of these}} marriages turned out to be highly significant. Although marked by magnificent festivities, at the time they took place the alliances were not seen as politically important, not even by the Imperial ambassador Jehan de Scheyfye, who was the most suspicious observer. Often perceived as proof of a conspiracy to bring the Dudley family to the throne, they have also been described as routine matches between aristocrats.|$|E
60|$|She ran {{to meet me}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> my daughter; {{she kissed}} me <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> my daughter; she fondly {{looked up at me}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> my daughter. At the sight of that sweet young face, so sorrowful, and so patiently {{enduring}} sorrow, all my doubts and hesitations, everything artificial about me with which I had entered the room, vanished in an instant.|$|E
60|$|The girl shrank <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> {{received}} a stab. Then she stiffened.|$|R

60|$|No {{material}} compound {{could have}} been more dangerous to childhood, and nothing conceivable more attractive to Sally. The way in which that pretty little nude infant disported herself on that pile was absolutely tremendous. She sprang over things <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> made expressly to fly. She tumbled off things <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> created to fall. She insinuated herself among anchor-flukes and chains <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> born an eel. She rolled out from among the folds of sails {{as if she were a}} live dumpling. She seemed to dance upon upturned nails, and to spike herself on bristling bolts; but she never hurt herself,--at least if she did she never cried, except in exuberant glee.|$|E
60|$|She did {{not pull}} away her hand; it was <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> {{not thought of}} it.|$|R
