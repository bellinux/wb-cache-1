40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a detailed analysis}} and minimisation of OTA non-ideal effects in sinc(x) <b>amplitude</b> <b>equaliser</b> operating at video frequencies. The compensation has been achieved by deriving a set of design equations incorporating the OTA input capacitance and output resistance and the polynomial coefficients used to correct the sinc(x) distortion. Simulated and measured results are included showing the effectivness of the compensation technique...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{describe}} {{the design and}} CMOS realisation of a new gm-C <b>amplitude</b> <b>equaliser</b> for correcting sinc(x) distortion in video D/A converters. Simulated and measured results demonstrate how the equaliser is used to correct distortion in D/A converters with Fs= 13. 5 MHz to < 0. 08 dB ripple over 5 MHz bandwidth. Fabricated using 0. 8 um CMOS process, the equaliser occupies 0. 7 mm 2 and dissipates 20 mW from a 5 V supply...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy at Loughborough University. This thesis is concerned with solving the problem of equalisation of digital signals which have been passed through a time varying channel and corrupted by additive white noise. The approach used in this thesis {{to solve this problem}} is by the use of a robust filter structure rather than a tailored adaptation method. The reason for applying this approach is that, most adaptive algorithms such as the least mean square (LMS) and the recursive least squares (RLS) algorithms make the assumption that the input signals are statistically stationary. In the channel condition considered here, this assumption is violated and neither algorithm as a result works particularly well. Traditional attempts to overcome this problem have focused on modelling an assumed underlying dynamics of the channel distortion mechanism. The problem with these structures is that they are not robust in the case where the channel time variations do not match the assumed underlying dynamical model and the algorithms tend to be complex in nature. Consequently, two filter structures have been proposed in this thesis to tackle this problem. One structure known as the order statistic equaliser uses a combination of temporal and order statistic information of the received data sequence. The other structure, which has been named as the <b>amplitude</b> banded <b>equaliser,</b> uses a combination of temporal and amplitude information as opposed to the order statistics of the first structure. Both these structures have the advantage that they do not rely explicitly on the channel model. It has been concluded from the computer simulation studies conducted here that the tracking performance of the order statistic equaliser outperforms the linear equaliser structure when both are operating on the same time varying channel. The new amplitude banded structure, however, outperforms the order statistic equaliser in this situation...|$|R
