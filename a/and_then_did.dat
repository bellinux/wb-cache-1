The orchestra played for ten films made during the Second World War, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>did</b> little soundtrack work until the 1970s, with the major exception of Lawrence of Arabia (1962). Later scores have included those for Antony and Cleopatra (1972), Jesus Christ Superstar (1973), The Fly (1986), Dead Ringers (1988), In the Name of the Father (1993), the Lord of the Rings trilogy (2001–03) and most of the music for the three films derived from The Hobbit (2012–14).|$|E

In the mid-1950s, he was batting higher in the order, often at No 3, though this was partly due to the {{weakness}} of the Somerset side, which finished bottom of the County Championship for four consecutive seasons from 1952 to 1955.|$|E

On {{the first play}} of the Jets' possession, Favre was sacked for a loss of five yards; an incomplete pass set up a 3rd-and-15 from the Jets' 15-yard line. However, Favre found Keller for a 16-yard catch and the first down; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>did</b> so again two plays later, this one for 12 yards to move the Jets to their own 47-yard line. Three plays later, on a 3rd-and-1 from the Patriots' 44-yard line, Keller caught his third first down catch of the drive. This {{was followed by a}} 16-yard Coles catch two plays later, giving the Jets a first down from the Patriots' 24-yard line.

25|$|Goodwin {{played only}} these {{two games in}} 1896, but he {{returned}} for Gloucestershire for the 1897 County Championship and enjoyed his most prolific season. He played ten games, scoring 239 runs at 21.72 including a high score of 44 not out which came against Sussex on 2 August, overshadowed once more by a Grace century. He also made 36 against Somerset on 19 August, however {{he was unable to}} make any lasting impact and played only one match in the 1898 season: scoring five against Sussex on 30 May. He did return more convincingly in 1899, playing five games including his career-high score of 46 made against Somerset on 28 August at Taunton, which was the highest score of the innings, and also a game against a touring Australian side though in this match he only made six. However, a batting average of 12.50 and only 100 runs scored in the season was not enough to secure a regular place in the Gloucestershire line-up. Goodwin managed only nine runs from his three games in 1900, and played only one match in 1901 <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>did</b> not appear for Gloucestershire for five years. Meanwhile he joined the staff of Christ's Hospital, an independent school in Horsham, in 1902.|$|E
25|$|Several police {{officers}} who were present during the ambush complained that the attack {{was a result of}} a series of mistakes made by Jalisco State Police. They asked to have their identities protected to avoid retaliation by organized crime or the police. In an interview with the press, they stated that there were logistical and strategic mistakes the day the attack occurred. According to them, the policemen involved in the ambush were only carrying one load of ammunition for their rifles and handguns. They also stated that the police commander was not with his troops when the ambush occurred, and that he ordered {{the first part of the}} convoy to drive further away from the convoy and separate from the rest. He stated that the travel time between the first part of the convoy and his when the police were ambushed was at least 40 minutes. According to the source, a white Suburban passed the convoy <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>did</b> zig-zag moves ahead of them, apparently signaling the CJNG that the police convoy was coming up. They explained that when the ambush occurred, their vehicle tires were flattened by the bullets. They were able to escape by driving in reverse at full speed and hiding in a drainage system nearby. Nájera Gutiérrez de Velasco denied the claims that the police commander was not in the ambush. He also stated that the police did not go out on duty with one load of ammunition, and that the police commander was in the back part of the convoy, where he was able to call for reinforcements to save a wounded officer.|$|E
