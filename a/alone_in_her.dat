She retires for the night, wearing the diamond-encrusted necklace and begins to toss and turn.|$|E
5|$|Comfort, however, {{asserts that}} McClintock was well {{regarded}} by her professional peers, {{even in the}} early years of her career. Although Comfort argues that McClintock was not a victim of gender discrimination, she has been widely written about in the context of women's studies. Most recent biographical works on women in science feature accounts of her experience. She is held up as a role model for girls in such works of children's literature as Edith Hope Fine's Barbara McClintock, Nobel Prize Geneticist, Deborah Heiligman's Barbara McClintock: <b>Alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>Her</b> Field and Mary Kittredge's Barbara McClintock. A recent biography for young adults by Naomi Pasachoff, Barbara McClintock, Genius of Genetics, provides a new perspective, based on the current literature.|$|E
5|$|Until 19 August {{the weather}} was {{unsuitable}} for photography. Because Frances and Elsie insisted that the fairies would not show themselves if others were watching, Elsie's mother was persuaded to visit her sister's for tea, leaving the girls <b>alone.</b> <b>In</b> <b>her</b> absence the girls took several photographs, two of which appeared to show fairies. In the first, Frances and the Leaping Fairy, Frances is shown in profile with a winged fairy close by her nose. The second, Fairy offering Posy of Harebells to Elsie, shows a fairy either hovering or tiptoeing on a branch, and offering Elsie a flower. Two days later the girls took the last picture, Fairies and Their Sun-Bath.|$|E

5|$|In 1985, The Guinness Book of World Records {{recognized}} Vulović as {{the world}} record holder for surviving the highest fall without a parachute. She was fired from JAT in 1990 after taking part in anti-government protests, but avoided arrest because the government {{was concerned about the}} negative publicity that her imprisonment would bring. She continued her work as a pro-democracy activist until the Socialist Party of Serbia was ousted from power during the Bulldozer Revolution of October 2000. Vulović later campaigned on behalf of the Democratic Party of Serbia, advocating Serbia's entry into the European Union. The final years of her life were spent in seclusion and she continued to struggle with survivor's guilt. Having divorced, she lived <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> Belgrade apartment on a small pension until her death in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Another tradition, {{related by}} R.C. MacLeod, told of certain events {{which took place}} after an heir to the clan's chiefship was born. The story related how at this time, there was much rejoicing at Dunvegan Castle, and since the infant's nursemaid was anxious {{to join in the}} festivities in the hall below, she left the infant <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> room. When the baby awoke, crying of cold, no human help could hear him in his secluded room; however, a host of fairies {{appeared}} and wrapped the infant in the Fairy Flag. Meanwhile, the clansmen banqueting below demanded to see the child and the maid was ordered to bring him forth. When she brought out the baby, wrapped in the flag, everyone gazed in wonder at the child and the garb wrapped around him. The room was filled with the fairies' song which declared that the flag had the power to save the clan three times. When the song ended, and silence fell across the crowded room, the flag was taken from the infant and locked in a chest where it has ever since been preserved.|$|E

25|$|Philip was a 38-year-old {{professional}} man {{referred to}} the author's clinic for assessment....Philip began masturbating at puberty, which occurred at age 12 or 13. The earliest sexual fantasy he could recall was that of having a woman's body. When he masturbated, he would imagine {{that he was a}} nude woman lying <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> bed. His mental imagery would focus on his breasts, his vagina, the softness of his skin, and so on—all the characteristic features of the female physique. This remained his favorite sexual fantasy throughout his life.|$|E
25|$|Ida S. Scudder {{realized}} {{that she would be}} foolish to go on <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> fight to bring better health to South India's women. So she decided to open a medical school for girls. Skeptical males said she would be lucky to get three applicants; actually she had 151 the first year (1918), and has had to turn many away ever since. At first, the Reformed Church in America was the main backer of the Vellore school, but since Dr. Scudder agreed to make it coeducational it has the support of 40 missions. Of 242 students today, 95 are men.|$|E

25|$|This amazingly gruesome predatory {{behavior}} {{is a great}} example of a collaboration between solitary and cooperative predation. The first ant will initially act <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> predation, but after that other ants will come and join in the hunt, and still other will travel back to the domatia to recruit even more ants to aid in holding down and eventually dismembering the prey. This also demonstrates how much more effective a group of individuals can be than an individual working on its own. A single ant {{would never be able to}} kill such large prey; they are only able to do so by incorporating communication and cooperation.|$|E

Despite Jones’ insistent questioning, Celia repeatedly denied having had any assistance in killing Robert Newsom or in burning his body.|$|E

25|$|The {{marriage}} {{caused a}} {{scandal in the}} courts of European royalty as Princess Victoria was divorced from her first husband, Grand Duke Ernst Ludwig of Hesse, also her first cousin. The Grand Duke of Hesse's sister was Tsarina Alexandra Fyodorovna, the wife of Nicholas II.

She was not <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> opposition. Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna was also appalled at the effrontery of Kirill's marriage. Shortly after Kirill's return to Russia, the Tsar stripped Kirill of his imperial allowance and title of Imperial Highness, his honours and decorations, his position in the navy and then banished him from Russia. Kirill's marriage was in open defiance of the Russian Orthodox Church ruling that first cousins were not permitted to marry. Kirill knew that the Tsar's brother Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich had been forbidden to marry his first cousin, Princess Beatrice of Edinburgh and Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.|$|E
