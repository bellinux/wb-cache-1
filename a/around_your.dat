25|$|I grew up {{with three}} totally {{different}} parents that were into different music. My stepfather is into Willie Nelson and Elvis {{and all that kind}} of stuff. And my real father is into Mariah and Whitney and Aretha all those soulful singers. My mom is into more, like, adult contemporary—Celine Dion, Barbra , Bette , all those types of things. And then my brother is a big influence on me. He's like 10 years older than me, so you always wanna be <b>around</b> <b>your</b> cool brother and hang out, so I grew up loving Guns N' Roses. I was all about Metallica. I was all about all those bands, and I still am. I love Aerosmith and No Doubt. I have so many influences on me that are so different. And even country. I love Reba McEntire. I could listen to her all the time.|$|E

25|$|Roast Beef's {{birthday}} is April 22. Some of his accomplishments include {{a program that}} determines how many eggs and how much milk you need to buy in a given week, and another that determines the amount of loose change lying <b>around</b> <b>your</b> house and makes a reservation at a restaurant accordingly. Roast Beef is partial to UNIX and his preferred programming language is Java. He likes Stella Artois beer and Guinness. He is perhaps the world's greatest historian of the Great Outdoor Fight, and drove Ray to compete (and win) in the 2006 Fight. He also managed {{to get into the}} Fight himself by hacking the Fight's database. He fully accepted the fact that Ray would have to beat him senseless in order to win, and was shocked beyond belief when Ray destroyed the Fight rather than fight him. He drives a 1965 Ford Galaxie (powered by Ford's rare 427 SOHC V8 engine) that was a gift from Ray. He has also gone to the moon, by stealing Pat's home-made rocket, and to the afterlife (both heaven and hell), via various methods including some of the aforementioned shooting incidents and vomiting into an electrical outlet. He has also produced his very own zine, titled Man Why You Even Got To Do A Thing.|$|E

500|$|... "Skyfall" [...] was {{composed}} {{in the key}} of C minor using common time at 76beats per minute (Adagietto). Adele's vocal range spans , from the low note of G3 to the high note of C5, on the song. The lyrics closely follow the narrative of the film {{rather than focusing on}} romanticism. According to Epworth, the song is about [...] "death and rebirth", saying [...] "It's like, when the world ends and everything comes down <b>around</b> <b>your</b> ears, if you've got each other's back, you can conquer anything. From death to triumph, that was definitely something we set out to try and capture". The Daily Telegraph writer Neil McCormick described the lyrics as [...] "slightly sinister" [...] and containing references to a number of Bond tropes and motifs.|$|E

Leto explained that the lyric plays on two different levels, giving a sexual connotation to the line, but also the idea of power and control. He further said that the song [...] "has to do with getting to a {{point in your life}} where you're ready {{to let go of the}} past, embrace change and become more of who you really are".|$|E
500|$|Media reports echoed Presley's {{concerns}} about his career, but RCA producer Steve Sholes and Freddy Bienstock of Hill and Range had carefully prepared for his two-year absence. Prepared with unreleased material, they {{kept up a}} stream of regular, successful releases. Between his induction and discharge, Presley had ten top 40 hits, including [...] "Wear My Ring <b>Around</b> <b>Your</b> Neck", the best-selling [...] "Hard Headed Woman", and [...] "One Night" [...] in 1958, and [...] "(Now and Then There's) A Fool Such as I" [...] and the number one hit [...] "A Big Hunk o' Love" [...] in 1959.

500|$|... "The {{ultimate}} thing {{behind the}} song {{is that if you}} don't express yourself, if you don't say what you want, then you're not going to get it. And in effect you are chained down by your inability to say what you feel or go after what you want. No matter how in control you think are about sexuality in a relationship there is always the power struggle... always a certain amount of compromise. Of being beholden, if you love them. You do it because you choose to. No one put the chain around this neck but me. I wrote 'Express Yourself' to tell women around the world that pick and choose the best for yourself, before that chain <b>around</b> <b>your</b> neck, kills you instead. It's my take on how man can express what they want, the same prerogative should be there for a woman too." ...|$|E
500|$|... "About a Girl" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Levine from Digital Spy described the song as a [...] "europoppy club pumper with an ear-snagging chorus". He suggested {{it was the}} group's most infectious single since [...] "About You Now", but called it characterless along with the album's other tracks. Fraser McAlpine of BBC regarded the song as a [...] "dancefloor-friendly tune with an insistent chorus that echoes <b>around</b> <b>your</b> head", and compared it to the group's music from previous years. Jon O'Brien of Allmusic described [...] "About a Girl" [...] as a [...] "gloriously sassy uptempo Lady Gaga-esque number that stands {{up next to the}} best of their back catalog", and named it the [...] "one saving grace" [...] from the album. Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian admitted that although Sweet 7 was significantly Americanised, the track [...] "escaped with some quirky Britishness intact". The Independent critic Andy Gill criticised the song as a [...] "generic disco stomper" [...] and regarded it as [...] "vacuous".|$|E
500|$|... "Disturbia" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} contemporary music critics. Josh Tyrangiel of Time complimented the song's [...] "rubber-ball melodies that bounce <b>around</b> <b>your</b> head". Alex Fletcher of Digital Spy said that unlike the usual seventh single release by an artist, [...] "Disturbia" [...] is one Rihanna's stronger releases {{and that it}} proves that she is ruling '08 much like she did '07. He went on to describe it as a [...] "fun-packed electro treat filled with sizzling beats and crazy vocal effects." [...] Fletcher further highlighted the song's strong intro hook {{and said that the}} chorus is her catchiest since [...] "Umbrella". Spence D of IGN felt that the track has an infectious [...] "Bum-bum-be-dum-bum-bum" [...] hook that sucks you into the detached electronic bounce of the track. Jaime Gill from Yahoo! Music highlighted the song's [...] "insistent hook, sturdy beat and weaving, winding melody." [...] Fraser McAlpine from the BBC Music deemed the song's plus points to be Rihanna's icy whine, the frosty-rave chorus and the Eiffel 65-like refrain.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, Crosby {{insisted upon}} the {{inclusion}} of the contentious track [...] "Mind Gardens", which was disliked by the other band members and derided by McGuinn as having no [...] "rhythm, meter, or rhyme". [...] In conversation with Byrds biographer Johnny Rogan in 1980, Crosby defended the song by stating [...] "it was unusual and not everybody could understand it because they'd never heard anything like it before. At that time everything was supposed to have rhyme and have rhythm. And it neither rhymed nor had rhythm, so it was outside of their experience. It was just a little story and what it said was true ... if you build walls <b>around</b> <b>your</b> mind to keep out the abuse and harshness of life and the pain, then you also shut out the joy and the love." [...] Although [...] "Mind Gardens" [...] is often dismissed by critics and fans for being self-indulgent, Rogan has noted that its raga rock ambiance, symbolic lyrics and attractive backwards guitar effects capture the Byrds at their most creatively ambitious.|$|E
500|$|We Don't Need to Whisper {{received}} largely {{mixed reviews}} from contemporary music critics {{at the time}} of its release. Alternative Press was generally the most enthusiastic of the positive reviews, considering it influential to rock bands in 2006. The publication found the album to not be abounding or thought-provoking and commented: [...] "While the lyrics might be DeLonge at his most soul-searching, the music is built for nothing smaller than football stadiums." [...] IGN was also very positive in their assessment of the record, writing, [...] "This album is like a post-millennial concept record that beckons to be listened to with the lights dimmed and the headphones clamped tightly <b>around</b> <b>your</b> aural receptors. [...] It may not be your cup of tea, but kudos to the quartet for not merely re-treading the blink market with more mature lyrics." [...] Entertainment Weekly journalist Leah Greenblatt gave the album a B- rating, commending its obvious influences while also criticizing DeLonge's vocals. It stated that his vocals might improve to resemble those of Robert Smith heard on tracks like [...] "It Hurts", but likened it to a high school student with a job at Del Taco communicating with a drive-through microphone.|$|E
500|$|While in Friedberg, Presley met 14-year-old Priscilla Beaulieu. They would {{eventually}} marry after a seven-and-a-half-year courtship. In her autobiography, Priscilla says that despite his worries {{that it would}} ruin his career, Parker convinced Presley that to gain popular respect, he should serve his country as a regular soldier rather than in Special Services, where {{he would have been}} able to give some musical performances and remain in touch with the public. Media reports echoed Presley's concerns about his career, but RCA producer Steve Sholes and Freddy Bienstock of Hill and Range had carefully prepared for his two-year hiatus. Armed with a substantial amount of unreleased material, they kept up a regular stream of successful releases. Between his induction and discharge, Presley had ten top 40 hits, including [...] "Wear My Ring <b>Around</b> <b>Your</b> Neck", the best-selling [...] "Hard Headed Woman", and [...] "One Night" [...] in 1958, and [...] "(Now and Then There's) A Fool Such as I" [...] and the number one [...] "A Big Hunk o' Love" [...] in 1959.

500|$|Sean Fitz-Gerald of Vulture {{wrote that}} [...] "the song veers toward Stefani's more mellifluous, sentimental fare," [...] {{calling it a}} [...] "heartrending track". Amanda Dykan of AltWire praised the track, stating: [...] " [...] reaches through, wraps its acrylic-nailed fingers <b>around</b> <b>your</b> {{pulsating}} heart, rips it from your chest, throws it on the floor, and stomps all over it." [...] Jillian Mapes of Pitchfork Media claimed that [...] "Stefani – now 20 years wiser – flips it"; she continued with: [...] "It’s a rare moment on the album where you can pick out Stefani from a sea of other pop singers." [...] Mapes concluded by claiming that [...] "Used to Love You" [...] was her greatest song since [...] "Don't Speak", comparing its effect to Madonna's 1989 single [...] "Like a Prayer". Sean Fitz-Gerald of Vulture warned that when listening to this [...] "heartending track" [...] that [...] "tissues are a must". Consequence of Sound critic Adam Kivel enjoyed the track, calling it a [...] "recognizable moment in heartbreak delivered in a charming falsetto burble". Nate Jackson from OC Weekly appreciated the [...] "somber" [...] of the track, while Marcus Floyd from Renowned for Sound awarded it 4.5 out of 5 stars, claiming that [...] "every lyric and every note are sung with heart and chorus just gets you". Michael Smith from the same website acknowledged [...] "Used to Love You" [...] {{as one of the}} strongest songs on This Is What the Truth Feels Like, calling it [...] "unexpectedly heartfelt".|$|E
