5|$|<b>Air</b> <b>conditioning</b> – Ambulances {{are often}} {{fitted with a}} {{separate}} <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> system to serve the working area from that which serves the cab. This helps to maintain an appropriate temperature for any patients being treated, but may also feature additional features such as filtering against airborne pathogens.|$|E
5|$|A {{primitive}} form of <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> was abandoned {{within a few}} months.|$|E
5|$|Some {{vehicles}} use {{solar panels}} for auxiliary power, such as for <b>air</b> <b>conditioning,</b> {{to keep the}} interior cool, thus reducing fuel consumption.|$|E
5|$|The LS 430 {{interior}} featured walnut {{wood trim}} {{on the dashboard}} and upper doors, along with semi-aniline leather and oscillating <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> vents.|$|E
5|$|Automobile <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> {{systems were}} {{commonly}} fitted with fusible plugs, operating at 100–110°C, but from {{concerns about the}} environmental effects of any released refrigerant gas this function has {{been taken over by}} an electrical switch.|$|E
5|$|On 11 December 2015, a train {{pulling into}} the station caught fire, causing it to be evacuated. The cause was {{believed}} to be a fault in its <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> unit.|$|E
5|$|Rotary fan, {{manual and}} water-powered: For {{purposes}} of <b>air</b> <b>conditioning,</b> the Han Dynasty craftsman and mechanical engineer Ding Huan (fl. 180 AD) invented a manually operated rotary fan with seven wheels that measured 3m (10ft) in diameter; in the 8th century, during the Tang Dynasty (618–907), the Chinese applied hydraulic power to rotate the fan wheels for <b>air</b> <b>conditioning,</b> while the rotary fan {{became even more}} common during the Song Dynasty (960–1279). The first rotary fan used in Europe was for mine ventilation during the 16th century, as illustrated by German mineralogist and metallurgist Georg Agricola (1494–1555).|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} contains 210,851 square-feet {{within the}} tower structure {{and it was}} the first office building in the United States with built-in <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> when constructed.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept car}} had a Connolly Leather-trimmed {{interior}} produced by Callow & Maddox, and was fitted with {{front and rear}} heated windscreens, electric windows, <b>air</b> <b>conditioning,</b> heated electrically adjustable seats with an Alpine CD player. The dashboard was supplied by Veglia.|$|E
5|$|The {{temperature}} inside closed-cockpit cars was not {{to exceed}} 32°C in cars with <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> or 10°C above the ambient air temperature in cars without. The ACO would monitor cockpit temperature, and stop any car in which those limits were exceeded.|$|E
5|$|V-Series: {{introduced}} in October 2006, the Commodore V featured <b>air</b> <b>conditioning,</b> a sports-oriented body kit including 17-inch alloy wheels, a rear spoiler and colour-matched wing mirrors and exterior door handles.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began in}} 1927 and the {{building}} was opened on June 1, 1928. The building became premier office space {{in the center of}} the city, serving as the home of major law firms among other tenants. In 1953, steel and concrete pen houses were built at the back of the building to house <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> equipment.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, heating, {{ventilation}} and <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> (HVAC) systems {{account for}} 30% (4.65EJ/yr) {{of the energy}} used in commercial buildings and nearly 50% (10.1EJ/yr) of the energy used in residential buildings. Solar heating, cooling and ventilation technologies {{can be used to}} offset a portion of this energy.|$|E
5|$|Prodigy: Building onto {{what the}} AT-X offers, the semi-luxury Prodigy, branded the Touring in New Zealand and the Middle East, {{features}} an electrically adjustable driver's seat, dual-zone climate control <b>air</b> <b>conditioning,</b> parking sensors, wood grain interior and full leather upholstery. The Prodigy also sees a chrome grille, and 16-inch alloy wheels along with {{front fog lamps}} as standard.|$|E
5|$|Springfield is in {{the midst}} of a massive heat wave. Every {{building}} in the town has installed a large <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> device. However, this draws a lot of power from the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. Despite the safety measures Mr. Burns has taken (cutting power to the orphanage), the plant is at full power. At home, without an <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> device, the Simpsons have to follow an old-fashioned fan. Homer decides to give them a taste of winter by plugging in his dancing Santa Claus. This overloads the plant and causes a town-wide blackout. Eventually, widespread rioting and looting occur. The police try to intervene, but are powerless to stop the massive crime wave.|$|E
5|$|The B was {{the first}} {{railroad}} to introduce <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> on its trains, beginning with the Columbian in 1931, followed by the Capitol Limited on May 22, 1932, well ahead of its competitors. This innovation received favorable comment nationwide by the news media.|$|E
5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the war, the cathedral underwent a series of renovations. The roof—which was previously made of timber—was replaced with a concrete one in 1952 due to damage from termites. The reordering of the sanctuary took place in 1969 after the Second Vatican Council, in which the main altar was moved to the cathedral's crossing. In 1988, <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> was installed and the roof underwent reparation.|$|E
5|$|As a fleet flagship, her {{complement}} was 115 {{officers and}} 1,860 men in 1947. <b>Air</b> <b>conditioning</b> was provided {{for many of}} the ship's control spaces, and asbestos insulation was provided on exposed areas of the ship's sides, decks and bulkheads. Steam heating was provided for her armament, instruments, look-out positions and other equipment to make Vanguard suitable for operations in the Arctic. An Action Information Centre was fitted below the main armour deck with facilities to track aircraft and ships around Vanguard.|$|E
5|$|Before its studio's second production, Oriental began renting {{the studios}} of Algemeen Nederlandsch Indisch Filmsyndicaat (ANIF) in Molenvliet, Batavia, for 1,500 gulden a month. This rent also {{included}} access to the studio's equipment and cameraman J.J.W. Steffans, as well as facilities such as <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> and telephones in each office, and lighting equipment for night-time shots. A large adjacent plot of land was also included. By renting the ANIF complex, Oriental became {{the largest and most}} modern studio in the Indies.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{an aging}} facility, the Kentucky Community and Technical College System is {{currently}} requesting $20 {{million for the}} renovation of the College Drive campus, {{as well as an}} extra $5 million {{over the next two years}} when the Kentucky General Assembly meets in early 2008. The campus would receive a new roof, new electrical wiring, new heating and <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> units, improved security features, improvements to parking lots, new paint, a refurbished science lab and new equipment.|$|E
5|$|For ease of {{training}} and fleet conversion, de Havilland designed the Comet's flight deck layout {{with a degree of}} similarity to the Lockheed Constellation, an aircraft that was popular at the time with key customers such as BOAC. The cockpit included full dual-controls for the captain and first officer, while a flight engineer controlled various key systems, including fuel, <b>air</b> <b>conditioning,</b> and electrical systems. The navigator occupied a dedicated station with a table across from the flight engineer.|$|E
5|$|Interior {{design is}} {{designed}} by Gensler. There are six changing rooms. Home team changing rooms occupy , with jacuzzis, cryotherapy {{and a private}} area for the coach. The warm-up area has seating for 86 VIP ticket holders, and is separated by soundproof glass. All the public areas have <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> and are finished in marble, granite or top tier ceramic tile.|$|E
5|$|MY09: {{models were}} {{launched}} on 15 March 2008. Six airbags were made standard across the range—Omega and SV6 variants were previously fitted with two and four airbags respectively. Omega models also received standard fitment of <b>air</b> <b>conditioning,</b> 16-inch alloy wheels, body colour wing mirrors and door handles, {{and a new}} grille insert with chrome highlights. Revised alloy wheel designs were featured on the Calais (seven-spoke) and Calais V (10-spoke).|$|E
5|$|Previously, the Sistine Chapel's only {{ventilation}} {{was from}} its {{windows in the}} upper level of the walls. To prevent exhaust fumes and wind-blown pollutants from entering, the windows are now permanently closed and an <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> system has been installed. The installation is by Carrier of the United Technologies Corporation and was developed {{with the cooperation of}} the Vatican's Office of Technical Services. It has been designed to counteract the various problems specific to the Chapel, in particular the rapid changes of heat and humidity that occur with the admission of the first crowds of tourists each morning and the departure of the last visitors each afternoon. The <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> varies not only the heat but also the relative humidity between the summer and winter months so that changes to the atmospheric environment occur gradually. The air near the ceiling is kept at a temperate level, while the air in the lower section of the building is cooler and circulates more rapidly, with the effect that dirt particles fall towards the floor rather than being streamed upwards. Bacteria and chemical pollutants are filtered out.|$|E
5|$|Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) and the Sacramento Tree Foundation have partnered {{to provide}} the city of Sacramento shade trees for free. The program allows {{citizens}} to receive trees from four to seven feet tall. They also give them fertilizer, and delivery, all at no cost. They encourage citizens to plant their trees to benefit their home by reducing <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> costs. Approximately more than 450,000 shade trees have been planted in the Sacramento area.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the hotel was finished in redwood with flagstone flooring. The public space included a registration area, a casino, two bars, a coffee shop, a restaurant, various commercial shops and services, and a broadcasting station for K-RAM radio. Guest rooms were located in wings situated behind the main building, surrounding the figure-eight swimming pool. The hotel originally had 300 rooms, each outfitted with <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> with individual thermostats.|$|E
5|$|The park {{features}} an amphitheater that {{is home to}} the long-running outdoor musical, The Stephen Foster Story, which is staged during the summer. It is the longest running outdoor drama in the state of Kentucky, having started in 1959. It was written by playwright Paul Green. Matinees are performed in an indoor theater with <b>air</b> <b>conditioning.</b> Many Foster songs are performed, with the actors dancing in antebellum period costume, in a retelling of Foster's life.|$|E
5|$|The station, {{along with}} the other Phase 1 {{stations}} along the Second Avenue Subway, contains features not found in most New York City Subway stations. It is fully compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, containing two elevators for disabled access. Additionally, the station contains <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> and is waterproofed, a feature only found in newer stations. The artwork at 86th Street is Subway Portraits, a selection of twelve face portraits by painter Chuck Close.|$|E
5|$|The {{turbines}} {{were designed}} to operate at 12,500 rpm and were paired with a generator set with a 10:1 reduction gearing. A twin-armature DC generator was used to power the traction motors, while a three-phase, 220-volt AC generator provided auxiliary functions such as powering the traction motor blowers and providing head-end power; the latter, which was used to provide lighting, heating, and <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> to passenger cars, was incredibly unusual in 1939 and would not become standard until the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Three campuses {{encompass}} the ACTC system, the primary campus located on College Drive near downtown Ashland near 13th Street and is where business, education, health-related, {{information technology and}} transfer programs are offered. The Roberts Drive campus, located at {{the southern edge of}} Ashland, offers several industrial technology degrees, such as <b>Air</b> <b>Conditioning,</b> Applied Process Technologies, Auto Mechanics, Computer Aided Drafting and Fire and Rescue Technology, and courses in Cosmetology and Culinary Arts.|$|E
5|$|Williamson's {{body was}} {{discovered}} by Chambers at approximately 11.15am. Chambers noticed that the <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> had been left on, something that Williamson was unlikely to have done, and then realised that Williamson's bedroom door had been left ajar. Investigating further, {{he opened the door}} and discovered Williamson's corpse lying face down on the floor, with multiple stab wounds to the neck and surrounded by a pool of blood. Williamson's dog, Tessa, was running about in the room and barking.|$|E
5|$|A cube-shaped {{concrete}} {{building was}} constructed {{on the top}} of the hill, next to the dome. This was intended to be used as the bomb-proof outlet for a ventilation and <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> shaft. It was an essential component of a facility where dangerous and explosive gases were expected to be used in large quantities on a daily basis. It was never finished, and the Allies found when they captured the site that the ventilation shaft had not been fully excavated. The building survived the bombing intact and is still prominently visible today.|$|E
5|$|A {{fusible plug}} is a {{threaded}} metal cylinder usually of bronze, brass or gunmetal, with a tapered hole drilled completely through its length. This hole is sealed {{with a metal}} {{of low melting point}} that flows away if a pre-determined, high temperature is reached. The initial use of the fusible plug was as a safety precaution against low water levels in steam engine boilers, but later applications extended its use to other closed vessels, such as <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> systems and tanks for transporting corrosive or liquefied petroleum gasses.|$|E
5|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature of}} the new command centre was a large liquid crystal display which displayed information regarding the <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> unit and sound system. Buyers could opt for a premium sound package, standard on the Fairmont Ghia, which included a full-colour screen. Ventilation outlets were larger than those of previous models, resulting in a cabin that could be more effectively and efficiently heated or cooled. Another change was the headlamp switch, which was now located {{on the end of}} the turn signal stalk for easier reach.|$|E
5|$|Adud al-Dawla also build caravanserai's and dams. The {{city that}} has {{particularly}} benefited from this work is Shiraz. In the region of Shiraz, he built a palace with three hundred and sixty rooms with advanced wind towers for <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> system of residential rooms. The population of Shiraz had increased so much during his reign that he built a satellite city near the city for his army. The name {{of the city was}} Kard-i Fannā Khusraw ("made by Fanna Khusraw"), making a clear reference to the names that the Sasanians gave their foundations.|$|E
5|$|At some U.S. {{international}} airports, such as O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, some {{seating and}} waiting areas are {{located away from}} the terminal building, with passengers being shuttled to terminals. These areas may {{be referred to as}} ground transportation centers or intermodal centers. Amenities at ground transportation centers typically include restrooms and seating, and may also provide ticket counters, food and beverage sales and retail goods such as magazines. Some ground transportation centers have heating and <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> and covered boarding areas (to protect passengers from the elements).|$|E
