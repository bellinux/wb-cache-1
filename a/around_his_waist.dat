5|$|The 8th-century saint Cuntarar {{described}} Bhikshatana {{as having}} matted {{hair and skin}} smeared with ash, and wearing bark clothes and a tiger skin <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>waist.</b> He added that Bhikshatana would roam begging for food by day and dance at night {{in front of a}} fire, in company of his wife and several jackals.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{non-contact}} variants of American football, such as flag football. In flag football the ballcarrier is not tackled; instead, defenders aim {{to pull a}} flag tied <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>waist.</b> Another variant, touch football, simply requires the ballcarrier to be touched to be considered downed. A game of touch football may require that the player be touched with either one or two hands to be considered down, depending on the rules used.|$|E
5|$|After takeoff, Cooper told Mucklow to {{join the}} rest of the crew in the cockpit and remain there with the door closed. As she complied, Mucklow {{observed}} Cooper tying something <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>waist.</b> At approximately 8:00pm, a warning light flashed in the cockpit, indicating that the aft airstair apparatus had been activated. The crew's offer of assistance via the aircraft's intercom system was curtly refused. The crew soon noticed a subjective change of air pressure, indicating that the aft door was open.|$|E

6000|$|... “You’ll {{get back}} what is yours, never fear,” {{answered}} Dave, {{and took the}} belt. He {{saw to it that}} it was tightly closed, then fastened it <b>around</b> <b>his</b> own <b>waist.</b>|$|R
5|$|Bhikshatana is {{depicted}} with jatabhadra (dishevelled matted locks) or with jatamandala (matted hair {{arranged in a}} circle). A serpent may be depicted in his matted hair, which is also adorned by the crescent moon. His forehead bears a tripundara, the Shaiva tilaka composed of three horizontal lines of sacred ash with a red dot in the middle representing the third eye. He wears a patta (ornamental head band)—sometimes adorned with a human skull motif—on his forehead. Snake ornaments adorn his body, and bronze images often depict multiple necklaces, a waist-band, armlets, elbow bands, bracelets, anklets, and rings on all his toes and fingers. A snake is also tied <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>waist</b> and a white yagnopavita (sacred thread) is worn across the chest.|$|E
5|$|Hargitay {{made his}} first film {{appearance}} with Mansfield in a bit part in Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?. The couple became a popular publicity and performing team who toured widely in stage shows, where Mansfield's leopard-spot bikini became a topic of discussion and newspaper coverage. As a highlight, Hargitay tossed her <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>waist</b> and spun her in wide circles as her shows made more headlines. On screen, he was Mansfield's male lead in her Italian ventures—The Loves of Hercules and L'Amore Primitivo, and a major supporting character in Promises! Promises!. On stage, he was the male lead in The Tropicana Holiday, The House of Love, French Dressing, and other nightclub acts.|$|E
5|$|After Mary's death, Paul and Michael {{were sent}} to live with Jim's brother Joe, and his wife Joan, for two months, so as to let their father grieve in private. Jim {{depended}} heavily on his sisters, Jin and Millie, to help around the house. Jim later {{took part in the}} running of the household, as Cynthia Lennon remembered that when she and John Lennon used to visit Forthlin Road, Jim would often answer the door with his sleeves rolled up, a tea towel in his hand and an apron tied <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>waist.</b> When Paul later played at The Cavern during lunchtimes, Jim would drop off food there that Paul would later put in the oven at Forthlin Road. Ruth remembered that Jim was funny and musical with her, but also strict when she was young, and was insistent that she learned good table manners and etiquette when speaking to people.|$|E
60|$|Lessingham stooped down. Willing hands {{helped him}} {{unfasten}} the cord from Jimmy's waist. He tore {{off his own}} coat and waistcoat and boots. Some helped, other sought to dissuade him, as he secured the line <b>around</b> <b>his</b> own <b>waist.</b>|$|R
50|$|The patient {{would lie}} on a bench, at an {{adjustable}} angle, and ropes would be tied <b>around</b> <b>his</b> arms, <b>waist,</b> legs or feet, {{depending on the}} treatment needed. Winches would then be used to pull the ropes apart, correcting curvature in the spine or separating an overlapping fracture.|$|R
60|$|At {{once the}} air was filled with black crows, each of whom seized the cord with beak or talons. The Scarecrow watched them with much {{interest}} and forgot that he had tied {{the other end of}} the line <b>around</b> <b>his</b> own <b>waist,</b> so he would not lose it while fishing for his friend.|$|R
5|$|The next day, Gawain {{leaves for}} the Green Chapel with the girdle wound twice <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>waist.</b> He finds the Green Knight {{sharpening}} an axe and, as promised, Gawain bends his bared neck to receive his blow. At the first swing Gawain flinches slightly and the Green Knight belittles him for it. Ashamed of himself, Gawain doesn’t flinch {{with the second}} swing; but again the Green Knight withholds {{the full force of}} his blow. The knight explains he was testing Gawain's nerve. Angrily Gawain tells him to deliver his blow and so the knight does, causing only a slight wound on Gawain's neck. The game is over. Gawain seizes his sword, helmet and shield, but the Green Knight, laughing, reveals himself to be the lord of the castle, Bertilak de Hautdesert, transformed by magic. He explains that the entire adventure was a trick of the 'elderly lady' Gawain saw at the castle, who is actually the sorceress Morgan le Fay, Arthur's sister, who intended to test Arthur's knights and frighten Guinevere to death. Gawain is ashamed to have behaved deceitfully but the Green Knight laughs and professes him the most blameless knight in all the land. The two part on cordial terms. Gawain returns to Camelot wearing the girdle as a token of his failure to keep his promise. The Knights of the Round Table absolve him of blame and decide that henceforth that they will wear a green sash in recognition of Gawain's adventure and as a reminder to be always honest.|$|E
25|$|Reverón built several ranches in {{the terrain}} {{that he bought}} in Macuto, the {{principal}} ranch was his workshop; the walls were timber and the roof thatched. <b>Around</b> <b>his</b> <b>waist</b> he placed a large bag to hold his driftwood-made brushes.|$|E
25|$|To {{help his}} brother, Egil shot birds and {{collected}} their feathers, of which Velent made {{a pair of}} wings. Velent tied a bladder filled with blood <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>waist</b> and flew away. Niðung commanded Egil to shoot his fleeing brother, who hit the bladder, deceiving Niðung, and so Velent got away.|$|E
60|$|As soon as Mrs. Yoop {{was in bed}} {{the lights}} all went out, and Woot the Monkey {{crouched}} under the bed and waited patiently until he heard the Giantess snoring. Then he crept out and in the dark felt around until he got hold of the apron, which he at once tied <b>around</b> <b>his</b> own <b>waist.</b>|$|R
40|$|Moist heat fogged Phillips 2 ̆ 7 glasses as {{he stepped}} into the steamy washroom. He searched for an empty sink but each one had a man {{standing}} before it, squinting into a smeary mirror, combing his hair or brushing his teeth.

60|$|He {{calculated}} the distance {{with a quick}} glance, took the bandana from his neck and tied it to the rope, and increased the length by a second bandana from his pocket. The rope, manufactured from sled-lashings and short lengths of plaited rawhide knotted together, was both light and strong. The first cast was lucky as well as deft, and Smoke's fingers clutched it. He evidenced a hand-over-hand intention of crawling out of the crack. But Carson, who had refastened the rope <b>around</b> <b>his</b> own <b>waist,</b> stopped him.|$|R
25|$|A career-spanning {{series of}} battles with Tie Domi of the New York Rangers, Winnipeg Jets and Toronto Maple Leafs. One of Probert's memorable {{confrontations}} {{was also the}} genesis of Domi's now-infamous belt gesture, where he gestured to the crowd {{as if he had}} a championship title belt <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>waist.</b>|$|E
25|$|His rock-climbing {{physical}} training and technique {{allow him to}} climb using the small protrusions of building walls and windows (such as window ledges and frames). Many of his climbs provide him no opportunity to rest and can last several hours. He sometimes has a small bag of climbing chalk powder fastened <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>waist.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{birth of}} the rank of yokozuna is unclear, {{and there are two}} {{competing}} legends. According to one, a 9th-century wrestler named Hajikami tied a shimenawa <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>waist</b> as a handicap and dared any to touch it, creating sumo as it is now known in the process. According to the other, legendary wrestler Akashi Shiganosuke tied the shimenawa <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>waist</b> in 1630 as a sign of respect when visiting the Emperor, and was posthumously awarded the title for the first time. There is little supporting evidence for either theory—in fact, it is not even certain that Akashi actually existed—but it is known that by November 1789, yokozuna starting from the fourth yokozuna Tanikaze Kajinosuke and the fifth yokozuna Onogawa Kisaburō were depicted in ukiyo-e prints as wearing the shimenawa. These two wrestlers were both awarded yokozuna licences by the prominent Yoshida family.|$|E

60|$|I {{had already}} turned on my heel to retrace my steps, when I saw two figures {{standing}} talking {{at the back}} door of the inn. One I knew at a glance to be Milly Hart. Her companion was standing with his back to me, a muffler round his neck and his cap slouched over his eyes. In the gloom of the fast-falling twilight I did not at first recognise him; but when he turned round with a start at the sound of my approaching footsteps and withdrew his arm with a sudden movement from <b>around</b> <b>his</b> companion's <b>waist,</b> something in the motion and figure seemed familiar to me.|$|R
50|$|Ssireum is {{conducted}} within a circular ring, measuring approximately 7 meters in diameter, which {{is covered with}} mounded sand. The two contestants begin the match by kneeling on the sand in a grappling position (baro japki), each grabbing a belt—known as a satba (샅바)—which is wrapped <b>around</b> <b>his</b> opponent's <b>waist</b> and thigh. The wrestlers then rise while retaining their hold on the other's 'satba.' The match is awarded to the wrestler who forces the other contestant to touch the ground with any {{part of his body}} at knee level or higher. Unlike sumo, pushing your opponent outside of the ring does not warrant a win, just a restart. Normally, professional ssireum is contested in a best-out-of-three style match.|$|R
25|$|The United States uses {{these devices}} to control prisoners. One type is the REACT belt. Some stun belts can {{restrain}} the subject's hands {{and have a}} strap going under his groin {{to stop him from}} rotating the belt <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>waist</b> to reach its battery and control pack and trying to deactivate it. Stun belts are not generally available to the public.|$|E
25|$|He had {{his first}} {{swimming}} lesson {{at the age of}} four, when his father dropped him into the sea water baths at South Melbourne with a rope tied <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>waist.</b> He often practised in the sea, close to where effluent was ejected into Port Phillip Bay. Later, when he had earned more money, he paid two cents to enter the now demolished Stubbs' South Melbourne Baths to train.|$|E
25|$|The {{standing}} {{figure is}} in typical pilgrim or travelling priest garb: waraji, a grey robe, and light-coloured leggings and arm covers. In addition, {{he wears a}} gong <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>waist</b> and carries a shakujō (錫杖) pilgrim's staff. Behind him, the body and straps of a portable shrine are just visible. Heroes and their foes disguising themselves as pilgrims is a popular kabuki motif. The character's aggressive pose—right arm removed from his robe, menacing facial expression—indicates that he is likely not a benign pilgrim.|$|E
60|$|Happily for Gabriel, Mrs. Conroy did {{not offer}} an {{opportunity}} for the exhibition of any tenderness on Gabriel's part. Although she did not make any allusion to the past, and even utterly ignored any previous quarrel, she still preserved a certain coy demeanour toward him, that, while it relieved him of an onerous duty, very greatly weakened his faith in the infallibility of Olly's judgment. When, out of respect to that judgment, he {{went so far as to}} throw <b>his</b> arms ostentatiously <b>around</b> <b>his</b> wife's <b>waist</b> one Sunday, while perambulating the single long public street of One Horse Gulch, and that lady, with great decision, quietly slipped out of his embrace, he doubted still more.|$|R

You need trouble yourself no further about it. I shall take that matter upon myself. Come, three days later, for his clothes.|$|R

25|$|Prince Diponegoro stands, defiant, {{in front}} of Lieutenant General Hendrik Merkus de Kock {{in front of}} the colonial officer's mansion. He wears a green turban, white tabard over pantaloons, and a jacket; <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>waist</b> is a golden belt, to which prayer beads are attached, and over his {{shoulder}} is a shawl. He appears to be struggling to control his anger– as would be expected from Javanese gentry– while the Europeans' eyes are static and avoid the eyes of others.|$|E
25|$|During his youth, Ze'evi went {{to school}} in Givat HaShlosha. One night he shaved his head, wrapped a towel round his waist and entered the food hall. The shaved head and towel <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>waist</b> was similar to Mohandas Gandhi earned him Gandhi as his {{nickname}}, which stuck {{with him for the}} rest of his life. The nickname is also attributed to a long Arab dress he wore during his underground days in Palmach. Ze'evi had five children, Palmach, Sayar, Masada, Tze'ela and Arava. Palmach is also a member of Moledet and competed with Binyamin Elon for the party's leadership.|$|E
25|$|Maitreya is {{typically}} pictured seated, with either both {{feet on the}} ground or crossed at the ankles, on a throne, waiting for his time. He is dressed in the clothes of either a bhikṣu or Indian royalty. As a bodhisattva, he would usually be standing and dressed in jewels. Usually he wears a small stupa in his headdress that represents the stupa with relics of Gautama Buddha to help him identify it when his turn comes to lay claim to his succession and can be holding a dharmachakra resting on a lotus. A khata is always tied <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>waist</b> as a girdle.|$|E
60|$|Oblivious of this comedy, Richard Keene and Eleanor {{had already}} wandered back, hand in hand, to their days of childhood. But {{even in the}} joy that filled the young girl's heart in the {{presence}} of her only kinsman, there was a strange reservation. The meeting that she had looked forward to with eager longing had brought all she expected; more than that, it seemed to have been providentially anticipated at the moment of her greatest need, and yet it was incomplete. She was ashamed that after the first recognition, a wild desire to run to Hurlstone and tell HIM her happiness was her only thought. She was shocked that the bright joyous face of this handsome lovable boy could not shut out the melancholy austere features of Hurlstone, which seemed to rise reproachfully between them. When, for the third and fourth time, they had recounted their past history, exchanged their confidences and feelings, Dick, passing <b>his</b> arm <b>around</b> <b>his</b> sister's <b>waist,</b> looked down smilingly in her eyes.|$|R

His epithet came from two red stripes <b>around</b> <b>his</b> neck and <b>waist,</b> dividing him into three: above the neck he resembled Nár; from the neck to the waist he resembled Bres; and {{from the waist down}} he resembled Lothar. Incest features further in Lugaid's story: he slept with Clothru himself, conceiving Crimthann Nia Náir.|$|R
