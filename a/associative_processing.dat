50|$|Smith and Kirby (2000) {{argue for}} a two-process model of appraisal, which expands on the {{function}} of the structural model of appraisal. While the structural model of appraisal focuses on what one is evaluating, the process model of appraisal focuses on how one evaluates emotional stimuli. There are three main components to the process model of appraisal: perceptual stimuli, <b>associative</b> <b>processing,</b> and reasoning. Perceptual stimuli are what the individual picks up from his or her surroundings, such as sensations of pain or pleasure, perception of facial expression (Smith & Kirby 2000). In addition to these stimuli, the process model is composed to two main appraisal processes. <b>Associative</b> <b>processing</b> is a memory-based process that makes quick connections and provides appraisal information based on activated memories that are quickly associated with the given stimulus (Marsella & Gratch 2009). Reasoning is a slower, more deliberate, and thorough process that involves logical, critical thinking about the stimulus and/or situation (Marsella & Gratch 2009). In the two-process model of appraisal theory, <b>associative</b> <b>processing</b> and reasoning work in parallel in reaction to perceptual stimuli, thus providing a more complex and cognitively based appraisal of the emotional encounter (Smith & Kirby 2000).|$|E
50|$|Postponing the {{reflective}} processes leads to mood persistence. As the individual experiences {{more and more}} negative mood states, he or she becomes accustomed {{to a state of}} dysphoria. Dysphoric moods create more <b>associative</b> <b>processing</b> for depressive vulnerable people by negative cognitive biases. When associative bias gets stronger, the bias becomes difficult to override. Ineffective reflective strategies lead to persistence of dysphoric moods.|$|E

50|$|Associative and {{reflective}} processing mechanisms apply when cognitive vulnerability is processed into depression. The dual process model is valid {{in social and}} personality psychology but is not adapted to clinical phenomena. Negative bias in self-assessment provides a foundation for a cognitive vulnerability to depression. Then a downward spiral forms to create forms of dysphoria. Negatively biased <b>associative</b> <b>processing</b> will maintain a dysphoric mood state. As the dysphoric mood escalates, cognitive resources necessary to combating dysphoria by reflective processing are depleted. Irrelevant tasks and intrusive thoughts come to mind when in a dysphoric mood, and cognitive resource depletion further contributes to mood escalation.|$|E
50|$|Whether the RAT {{should be}} used and {{interpreted}} {{as a measure of}} <b>associative</b> <b>processing,</b> convergent thinking and/or creative thinking remains an open question on both theoretical and empirical grounds. Currently, the debate surrounding the proper use of the RAT is difficult to determine in the absence of additional empirical studies examining the internal and external structure of the RAT. Findings from one study provide evidence for the RAT as a convergent thinking test, but much still remains to be understood regarding potential subprocesses of convergent thinking theorized to be assessed by the RAT and how these processes are linked to actual creative behaviors.|$|E
50|$|According to Guy Claxton, {{conscious}} thought employs rule-based thinking, following {{formal rules}} {{much like those}} of traditional logic, whereas unconscious thought instead uses associations that are either inherent or learned through experience, as in classical conditioning. In agreement with Claxton, The Rule Principle holds that conscious thought follows stringent rules and is accordingly precise, whereas unconscious thought engages in <b>associative</b> <b>processing.</b> It {{is important to note}} that unconscious thought may conform to rules even though it does not follow them. That is, although the process used to generate an output unconsciously is different than the process used in conscious thought, unconscious thought's output may well be identical or similar to that of conscious thought.|$|E

50|$|Through {{information}} provided from neuropsychological patients, dissociations of recognition processing {{have been identified}} between structural and semantic processing as structural, colour, and associative information can be selectively impaired. In one PET study, areas found {{to be involved in}} <b>associative</b> semantic <b>processing</b> include the left anterior superior/middle temporal gyrus and the left temporal pole comparative to structural and colour information, as well as the right temporal pole comparative to colour decision tasks only.

5000|$|The {{level of}} {{cognitive}} processing performed {{on a given}} stimuli {{has an effect on}} recognition memory performance, with more elaborate, <b>associative</b> <b>processing</b> resulting in better memory performance. [...] For example, recognition performance is improved through the use of semantic associations over feature associations. [...] However, this process is mediated by other features of the stimuli, for example, the relatedness of the items to one another. If the items are highly interrelated, lower-depth item-specific processing (such as rating the pleasantness of each item) helps to distinguish them from one another, and improves recognition memory performance over relational processing. [...] This unusual phenomenon is explained by the automatic tendency to perform relational processing on highly interrelated items. Recognition performance is improved by additional processing, even of a lower level of associativeness, but not by a task that duplicates the automated processing already performed on the list of items.|$|E
50|$|The {{dual coding}} theory (DCT), {{according}} to Paivio, suggests that visual and verbal information act as two distinctive systems. It {{has had its}} roots in the practical use of imagery as a memory aid 2500 years ago For example, one can think of a car by thinking of the word “car”, or by forming a mental image of a car. The verbal and image systems are correlated, as one can think of the mental image of the car and then describe it in words, or read or listen to words and then form a mental image. DCT identifies three types of processing: (1) representational, the direct activation of verbal or non-verbal representations, (2) referential, the activation of the verbal system by the nonverbal system or vice versa, and (3) <b>associative</b> <b>processing,</b> the activation of representations within the same verbal or nonverbal system. A given task may require any or all of the three kinds of processing. Verbal system units are called logogens; these units contain information that underlies our use of the word. Non-Verbal system units are called imagens. Imagens contain information that generates mental images such as natural objects, holistic parts of objects, and natural grouping of objects. Imagens operate synchronously or in parallel; thus all parts of an image are available at once. Logogens operate sequentially; words come one at a time in a syntactically appropriate sequence in a sentence. The two codes may overlap in the processing of information but greater emphasis is on one or the other. The verbal and non-verbal systems are further divided into subsystems that process information from different modalities.Many experiments reported by Paivio and others support the importance of imagery in cognitive operations. In one experiment, participants saw pairs of items that differed in roundness (e.g., tomato, goblet) and were asked to indicate which member of the pair was rounder. The objects were presented as words, pictures, or word-picture pairs. The response times were slowest for word-word pairs, intermediate for the picture-word pairs, and fastest for the picture-picture pairs.|$|E

Associative primes presented at a short (120 -msec) prime-target stimulus onset asynchrony facilitated color naming in Experiment 3. Taken together, {{the results suggest that}} the effect of faster processing of the base word in a color-naming task is facilitatory and that color-naming priming interference arises when <b>associative</b> prime <b>processing</b> increases conflict between word and color responses by enhancing phonological or articulatory activation of the base word...|$|R

Unfortunately, the implementation requirements of these architectures u ing conventional electronic technology have been very cost prohibitive, and therefore associative processors have not been realized.

40|$|Building an {{architecture}} for human cognition {{is a complex}} task requiring the incorporation of multiple mechanisms in a smoothly functioning system. There are two major cognitive architectural approaches to processing. Both approaches are well represented by other contributors to this volume. The symbolic process-ing approach (e. g., SOAR, Laird, Newell, & Rosenbloom, 1987; ACT*, Ander-son, 1983) represents processing as the manipulation of symbols via rules or productions. Connectionist processing involves the association of input and out-put patterns via association matrices (see Rumelhart & McClelland, 1986; Schneider, 1987). These two approaches are often viewed as competing alter-natives for cognitive processing (see Smolensky, 1988). Our research treats these two approaches as complementary. We believe that human cognition involves connectionist-like, <b>associative</b> best-match <b>processing</b> combined with an attentional system that allows rule-like processing.

40|$|Individuals with schizotypal {{personality}} disorder (SPD), or characteristics thereof, demonstrate elevated creativity, particularly visible in <b>associative</b> <b>processing</b> tasks. It {{is thought that}} an abnormal activation of semantic networks underlies the tendency for these individuals to form remote associations through loose and over-inclusive processing. Elevated scores of magical ideation (MI), which surveys beliefs in mysterious causation, have been specifically associated with similar thinking to individuals with SPD. Through {{a series of three}} experiments, the current study seeks to examine several associative trends with regards to judgment and response time. In Study 1, low and high MI participants completed an image-word pair association task, judging word pairs produced by other low and high MI participants. Neither convergence nor divergence of associative processes was observed, suggesting an individualized loosening of <b>associative</b> <b>processing.</b> High MI raters, however, did form associations faster and judged words as more likely descriptors of the images than low MI raters. In a follow-up forced-choice judgment task performed by randomly selected participants (Study 2), words that had been given by low MI participants were rated as more likely descriptors of the image than words given by high MI participants. Furthermore, word generation times (Study 3) by low and high MI participants suggest that the creative and loose processing of individuals with high MI scores may translate to verbal fluency tasks as well, as high MI participants generated words slightly faster than low MI participants. Cohesively, the experiments demonstrate the creative and loose <b>associative</b> <b>processing</b> of individuals with SPD by noting their unusual word generation, consistency in judging words as likely descriptors of the image, as well as quick association and word production times...|$|E

In contrast, no effect of mood was observed for a simple audiovisual simultaneity discrimination task in Experiment 2.
