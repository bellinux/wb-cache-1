2500|$|Surface traffic between Central and Admiralty, Causeway Bay, {{as well as}} in Mong Kok, {{was seriously}} {{affected}} by the blockades, with traffic jams stretching for miles on Hong Kong Island and across Victoria Harbour. Major tailbacks were reported on Queensway, Gloucester Road and Connaught Road, which are feeder roads to the blockaded route in Admiralty. With in excess of 100 bus or tram routes suspended or re-routed, queues for underground trains in the <b>Admiralty</b> <b>district</b> spilled onto the street at times. The MTR, the city's underground transport operator, was a beneficiary, enjoying a 20 per cent increase in passenger trips recorded on two of its lines. Others have opted to walk instead of driving. Taxi drivers reported a fall in income as they had to advise passengers to use the MTR when faced with jams, diversions or blockaded roads. Hong Kong Taxi Owners' Association claimed its members' incomes had declined by 30 percent since the protests started. Levels of PM2.5 particulate matter at the three sites declined to within the recommended safety levels of the World Health Organization. An editorial in the South China Morning Post noted that, on 29 September, the air quality in all three of the occupied areas had markedly improved. The health risk posed by airborne pollutants was [...] "low" [...] – it was usually [...] "high" [...] – and there was a steep fall in the concentration of NO2. It said: [...] "without a policy shift, after the demonstrations have ended, we will have to rely on our memories of the protest days for what clean vehicles on our roads mean for air quality".|$|E

5000|$|The Greens Creek {{mine in the}} <b>Admiralty</b> mining <b>district</b> is the 5th largest silver {{producer}} in the world; gold is a byproduct. The mine is an underground operation, with surface disposal of tailings onto two 29 acre sites. The mine and mill site lie on 18 patented claims; the mine has mineral rights to 12 square miles (7500 acres) of surrounding land owned by the Federal government. [...] It is located approximately 25 km south of Juneau, Alaska, on Admiralty Island within the Admiralty Island National Monument. The mine produces ores of silver and gold, and concentrates of zinc and lead, from a structurally and mineralogically complex VMS deposit. Geologists discovered mineralized outcrops in 1975, exploration drilling began in 1978; full-scale development was initiated in 1987 and production of metal concentrate began in 1989. Production was halted, due to low metal prices, {{for a few years}} in the mid-'90s. Concentrates are trucked nine miles (14 km) from the mine/mill complex to a port site on Hawk Inlet; from there they are shipped anywhere worldwide for smelting and refining.|$|R

Speaking for the majority, Justice Davis held that when a vessel under steam collides with a moored vessel, {{the commander of the}} vessel under steam is presumed liable for the collision, and has the onus of proving that he was not negligent. Wake-Walker had not done so. In addition, the trial judge had found actual fault by Wake-Walker in his navigation of Dragon and there was no basis to set aside that finding on appeal. [...] Wake-Walker then appealed to the Judicial Committee of the Imperial Privy Council, at that time the highest court of appeal for the British Empire. That court dismissed the appeal.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 12 Using a textual {{analysis}} to interview data approach, this study explores {{two of the}} first multiple-device tidal energy projects to identify the key learning outcomes gained by stakeholders. The cases chosen are the Snohomish County Public Utility <b>District’s</b> <b>Admiralty</b> Inlet pilot project in Puget Sound, Washington, United States, and MeyGen Ltd. ’s Phase 1 A project in Pentland Firth, Scotland, United Kingdom. With a focus on stakeholder learning, the research draws upon scholarly literature on innovation systems and technical innovations systems. This qualitative study uses in-depth, semi-structured, elite interviews of key informants as the primary method of data collection. The study analyzed the interview data from twenty-three stakeholder interviews and utilized MaxQDA 12 software as a platform to analyze the interviews. Learning from tidal energy projects is examined from technical, economic, environmental, policy, and social perspectives. By so doing, this research seeks to understand the interdisciplinary lessons stakeholders learned about tidal energy. The lessons learned from these case studies suggest that existing risks and uncertainties can preclude the deployment needed for the technical validation. Technical learning focused on the challenge of developing robust instrumentation for monitoring in tidal flow conditions. Economic learning focused {{on the need for}} government funding for environmental research, the potential expense of legal challenges, and the socio-economic impact of the project for local businesses. The projects served as a catalyst for examining the environmental impacts of tidal energy development. Species behavior and interaction with devices remains an area of research to address. Policy learning related to risk tolerance of regulators and the potential legal barriers faced by tidal energy. Socially, initiating the projects allowed the developers to recognize the concerns of relevant stakeholders. Spatial conflicts, exclusion, and access were major concerns of opposing stakeholders. Learning about an interdisciplinary range of issues is key to the future success of the tidal energy sector...|$|R
