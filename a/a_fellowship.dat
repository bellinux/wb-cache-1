It was at Chicago that Friedman met his future wife, economist Rose Director. During the 1933–1934 academic year he had <b>a</b> <b>fellowship</b> at Columbia University, where he studied statistics with renowned statistician and economist Harold Hotelling. He was back in Chicago for the 1934–1935 academic year, working as a research assistant for Henry Schultz, who was then working on Theory and Measurement of Demand. That year, Friedman formed what would prove to be lifelong friendships with George Stigler and W. Allen Wallis.|$|E
5|$|Arrington {{completed}} much of {{the research}} for Great Basin Kingdom in the LDS Church library archives. Aware of the LDS Church Archives's hostility to academic research at the time, Arrington took John A. Widtsoe's advice and started his research with published materials and theses, working up to unpublished materials. Arrington was able to circumvent A. William Lund's policy of personally approving all notes taken in the archives: Arrington took his notes on a typewriter using carbon copy paper, enabling him to leave a copy with Lund and take his own copy home. In order to rewrite his dissertation into Great Basin Kingdom, Arrington took a sabbatical 1956–1957 and was granted <b>a</b> <b>fellowship</b> at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California.|$|E

5|$|Before long, Chadwick gave Rotblat <b>a</b> <b>fellowship</b> (the Oliver Lodge Fellowship), {{doubling}} his income, and in {{that summer}} of 1939 the young Pole returned home, intending to bring Tola back with him. When {{the time came to}} leave Warsaw in late August, however, she was ill following an operation for appendicitis, and remained behind, expecting to follow within days; but the outbreak of war brought calamity. Tola was trapped, and desperate efforts in the ensuing months to bring her out through Denmark (with the help of Niels Bohr), Belgium, and finally Italy came to nothing, as each country in turn was closed off by the war. He never saw her again; she died in the Holocaust at the Belzec concentration camp. This affected him deeply {{for the rest of his}} life, and he never remarried.|$|E
5|$|Between 1932 and 1933, Burnet took {{leave of}} absence to {{undertake}} <b>a</b> <b>fellowship</b> at the National Institute for Medical Research in London. The Great Depression had resulted in Burnet's salary being cut from 1000 to 750 pounds, and the National Institute {{had been given a}} large grant from the Rockefeller Foundation that allowed them to hire Burnet at 1000 pounds per annum. The National Institute's Director Sir Henry Dale gained permission from Kellaway for the two-year move; Kellaway promised to hold Burnet's job for him when he returned and felt that the experience would make Burnet—whom he saw as the Hall Institute's brightest young scientist—better equipped to expand operations when he returned to Melbourne. Dale also paid for Burnet's sister to travel to England to help look after her brother's young children.|$|E
5|$|Entering the 85th United States Congress, McGovern {{became a}} member of the House Committee on Education and Labor. As a representative, McGovern was {{attentive}} to his district.

He favored rural development, federal aid to small business and to education, and medical coverage for the aged under Social Security. In 1957, he traveled and studied conditions in the Middle East under <b>a</b> <b>fellowship</b> from the American Christian Palestine Committee.
