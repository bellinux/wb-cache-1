5000|$|Chacha Chaudhary and Sabu are {{a double}} act. This {{is similar to}} Asterix and Obelix where Asterix is <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>guy</b> and Obelix is big and {{incredibly}} strong, but slightly slow on the uptake. There is some degree of similarity between Chacha Chaudhary and Asterix, wherein both {{do not have any}} extraordinary physical power and use their wits to get around situations. Sabu, on the other hand, does demonstrate that his tremendous muscle power is without the brains to apply it properly, analogous to Obelix. However, it cannot be said that there is any major similarity between the two comics, since Asterix has a common theme of outwitting the Romans, whereas Chacha Chaudhary is a very loosely connected series, with common characters, but new settings and story lines. Moreover, Asterix and the Gauls do have a secret ingredient giving them physical superiority over the Romans, and there is no such analogue in Chacha Chaudhary adventures ...|$|E

Writer Don Oakley criticized both the dollar amount and the grounds for the suit in an editorial article, saying, [...] "$9-million is 'umpteen' dollars in anybody's vocabulary, including that of the original Chief Wahoo, the comic strip character who coined the word.

5000|$|In {{his film}} review, critic Bosley Crowther contrasted Arthur Miller's {{play to the}} {{screenplay}}. While stating that the screenplay was more restrained, he praised the acting. He wrote, [...] "In the role of this rugged individualist, Mr. Robinson does a superior job of showing the shades of personality in <b>a</b> <b>little</b> tough <b>guy</b> who has a softer side. Arrogant, ruthless and dynamic in those moments when his 'business' is at stake, he is also tender and considerate {{in the presence of}} those he loves ... As the right-thinking son of this corrupt man, Burt Lancaster is surprisingly good and, although he appears a bit dim-witted at times, that is not implausible. Louisa Horton is natural as his sweetheart and Mady Christians plays the mother intensely. Irving Reis' direction is slightly stilted in some scenes but generally matches the tempo of a fluid script".|$|R
