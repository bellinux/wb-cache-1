Over time, however, her pay slipped in comparison to the pay of male area managers with equal or less seniority. By the end of 1997, Ledbetter was the only woman working as an <b>area</b> <b>manager</b> and the pay discrepancy between Ledbetter and her 15 male counterparts was stark: Ledbetter was paid $3,727 per month; the lowest paid male <b>area</b> <b>manager</b> received $4,286 per month, the highest paid, $5,236.|$|E

40|$|Conflicts between resource-dependent {{people and}} {{protected}} <b>area</b> <b>managers</b> abound {{in many developing}} countries. From the rural people's perspective, protected areas may contain valuable or necessary natural resources that are worth the effort, and risk of capture, to extract. From the protected <b>area</b> <b>manager's</b> perspective, the rural people's extraction of resources causes environmental degradation and is illegal. Protected <b>area</b> <b>managers</b> attempt to enforce the regulations against such extraction but, due to serious budget constraints, cannot deter all extraction. Because the rural people's marginal net benefit from extraction {{is a function of}} the distance from their village, the protected <b>area</b> <b>managers</b> have an opportunity to allocate their enforcement effort in a spatial pattern that reduces that marginal benefit and minimizes the resource degradation for a given budget level. This paper develops a spatial model that determines the protected <b>area</b> <b>manager's</b> optimal enforcement pattern and the rural people's optimal extraction pattern under that enforcement pattern. The results reveal the inefficiency of many protected area policies that maintain constant levels of enforcemen...|$|R

40|$|Management is {{a process}} {{requiring}} both an art and a skill {{in order to be}} effective in service rendering. In order for managers to be efficient and effective then in their managerial practices, {{there is a need for}} a formal management training programme by the organization. On the basis of this, the researcher has selected her subject of study to stress the importance of the development of a management training programme amongst staff officers and <b>area</b> <b>managers</b> within the SANDF Social Work Directorate. The study was conducted amongst staff officers and <b>area</b> <b>managers</b> within the SANDF Social Work Directorate consisting of men and women whose ages varies between thirty and fifty years. The researcher's motivation for choice of subject emanates from the observed difficulties experienced by some of the staff officers and <b>area</b> <b>managers</b> in the performance of some of the managerial tasks assigned to them such as the drawing of a budget. This resulted in the development of interest by the researcher in determining the need for a management training programme amongst staff officers and <b>area</b> <b>managers</b> within the SANDF Social Work Directorate. Literature review regarding the topic of management, needs assessment, management training and management training programme was done. The researcher consulted various sources to obtain the literature. Management functions and the different managerial approaches were explored. Needs assessment with the main focus on various levels of analysis, management training with specific reference to knowledge, skills and attitude, and the management training programme were looked into. A needs assessment for a management training programme questionnaire was administered amongst staff officers and <b>area</b> <b>managers</b> within the SANDF Social Work Directorate. According to the researcher, the findings indicate a definite need for a management training programme amongst staff officers and <b>area</b> <b>managers</b> within the SANDF Social Work Directorate. Through this management training programme, service rendering within the SANDF Social Work Directorate will definitely be enhanced. Dissertation (MA) [...] University of Pretoria, 2013.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} role of {{functional}} area-specific managerial schemas on the attempt of strategic renewal at a large medical devices developer and manufacturer {{during a period of}} high environmental dynamism. Using data from a 16 -month field study on managerial work related to the strategy process, I examine how functional <b>area</b> <b>managers</b> attempted to (re) configure organizational capabilities in response to various environmental challenges. While I did not find any disagreement between functional <b>area</b> <b>managers</b> related to what those challenges were, I did find fundamental disagreements related to what capabilities the organization can muster as a response. More specifically, disagreements surfaced in relation to how these capabilities should be assembled, and ultimately acted as triggers for the contestation of existing shared frames between functional <b>area</b> <b>managers.</b> These findings add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that there exist large differences between how managers within an organization interpret what the organization is capable of, and more specifically link these differences to the organizationâ€™s ability to adapt to environmental changes by showing how they impact the assembly of new capabilities deemed necessary for a successful response...|$|R

40|$|Protected <b>area</b> <b>managers</b> {{often fail}} to use {{empirical}} evidence for their management decisions, yet {{it is unclear whether}} this arises from a lack of available data, difficulty in interpreting scientific information for management application, or because managers do not value science for their decisions. To better understand the use of evidence for management decisions, we asked protected <b>area</b> <b>managers</b> in Australia what information is important when making decisions, the types of evidence they find most valuable, and the types of evidence they have for their protected <b>areas.</b> <b>Managers</b> described a complex array of information needed for management decisions, with nine different factors representing decisions about individual management issues and how to prioritize management actions. While managers reported less access to empirical evidence than other sources, this is not because they do not value it, reporting it to be the most valuable source of evidence. Instead, they make up the shortfall in empirical evidence with experience and information synthesized from multiple lines of evidence, which can provide important context for their decisions. We conclude that managers value a diversity of evidence because they face complex conservation decisions. Therefore, while empirical evidence can play an important role, alone this cannot provide all the knowledge managers need...|$|R
40|$|Australia-wide, {{the tourism}} sector {{is valued at}} over $ 60 billion per annum, {{with at least a}} third being in the nature, eco and {{adventure}} tourism sector. With increasing tourist numbers, the problem becomes one of managing tourism in protected areas, to protect and maintain the values that attracted tourists in the first place. However, because of their training and other factors, many protected <b>area</b> <b>managers</b> often find it easier to manage natural resources rather than visitors. This often results in misunderstandings through to animosity between protected <b>area</b> <b>managers</b> and the tourism industry. Improving their relationship has the potential to ensure that protected areas are used sustainably by the industry as well as reducing management costs through more efficient practices and cost sharing. Collaboration can lead to better decisions that {{are more likely to be}} implemented by participating parties. Collaborative management also relies on knowing which tools help or hinder such collaboration. As part of this study, qualitative research methods, such as ethnography, interpretivism and action research are used to determine current efforts that foster or hinder collaboration. In using action research, this research will explore, through working with protected <b>area</b> <b>managers</b> and the tourism industry, which tools are most likely to build successful collaboration...|$|R
