50|$|Hydraulic hybrid and {{pneumatic}} hybrid vehicles use an engine to charge a pressure accumulator {{to drive the}} wheels via hydraulic (liquid) or pneumatic (compressed <b>air)</b> <b>drive</b> units. In most cases the engine is detached from the drivetrain, serving solely to charge the energy accumulator. The transmission is seamless.

5000|$|In fact, Drive 105 was {{in large}} part created to ward off {{competition}} from KTCZ ("Cities 97"). After the fall of Zone 105 and {{in the months before}} Drive 105 was created, Cities 97 made significant gains in the 25-54 age group. Disney saw this as a threat to KQRS and created Drive 105 originally to jab at Cities 97's ratings. To keep a distance from sister 93X, the station targeted an older age group than most alternative stations. Like predecessor Zone 105, Drive would avoid any song that featured a significant amount of guitar distortion. When the station first began in January 2002, it aired spots such as, [...] "Remember when Cities 97 and KS95 sounded different? We do, that's why we're true to the music." [...] This was a stab at Cities 97's old slogan, [...] "true to the music", and a criticism of a recent tweak in the direction of pop-sounding KS95. During its first two years on the <b>air,</b> <b>Drive</b> 105 frequently made cracks at Cities 97. However, this came to end after criticism from the public and as the station began to take on an identity of its own.|$|E

50|$|In 1953 {{a project}} for the {{engineering}} company and bolt manufacturer GKN took the North Bar Tool Company in a new product direction. GKN had designed a bolt called 'Prolong' that had a splined section above the nut. By gripping the splined section of the bolt and counter rotating the nut, the fastener could be tightened {{without the need for}} any external reaction device. In a further development, a shear groove was placed below the spline, so designed that the bolt would fail at the groove when the pre-determined torque had been achieved. This bolting method was known as 'Torshear'. GKN required an <b>air</b> <b>driven</b> tool capable of high torque output to sell with their 'Prolong' bolts. Probably Britain's best known gearbox designer of the time was Dr. Henry Edward Merritt and so Dr. Merritt was contracted to design a suitable range of <b>air</b> <b>driven</b> gearboxes for the Torshear application.|$|R
50|$|The Torshear bolting {{method was}} not a {{commercial}} success so 'North Bar' added reaction arms to their gearboxes and called them 'Pneutorque' {{in the case of}} the <b>air</b> <b>driven</b> versions and the hand operated versions were named 'Handtorque'. Evolutions of these products still form part of the company's range today. Dr. Merritt's book 'Gears' remains a reference for gearbox designers.|$|R
40|$|Compressed <b>air</b> <b>driven</b> {{vehicles}} {{have two}} advantages over their rival electro-chemical battery driven {{vehicles in the}} locally non-polluting transport market, namely the much shorter recharging time possible and the long life of the high-pressure storage vessels. Comparatively poor energy density and poor efficiency of the initial air compression process have made these systems unattractive to the transport sector. Lightweight carbon fibre compressed air storage vessels are now practical but, if compressed <b>air</b> <b>driven</b> vehicles are to compete successfully further weight and efficiency savings must be made. A possible source of energy is the ambient heat available from {{the air in the}} vehicles immediate environment. This would require a lightweight high efficiency heat exchanger to be placed in the airflow between the pressure vessel and the air motor. A heat pipe based heat exchanger, capable of fulfilling these demands, has been built and tested in various configurations and is now described. The unit is capable of significantly increasing the energy, delivered to the air motor, at minimal cost...|$|R
