5|$|During the Great Depression of the 1930s, Keynes spearheaded a {{revolution}} in economic thinking, challenging the ideas of neoclassical economics that held that free markets would, in the short to medium term, automatically provide full employment, as long as workers were flexible in their wage demands. He instead argued that <b>aggregate</b> <b>demand</b> determined the overall level of economic activity and that inadequate <b>aggregate</b> <b>demand</b> could lead to prolonged periods of high unemployment. Keynes advocated the use of fiscal and monetary policies to mitigate the adverse effects of economic recessions and depressions. Keynes' magnum opus, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, was published in 1936.|$|E
5|$|Decrease <b>aggregate</b> <b>demand</b> (GDP) in the short-term, as low-income {{persons who}} tend to spend a large {{fraction}} of their additional resources would have fewer resources (e.g., ACA subsidies would be eliminated). This effect would be offset in the long-run by the labor supply factors below.|$|E
5|$|Private {{entrepreneurs}} sometimes {{resort to}} heavy advertising {{as a means}} of attracting buyers for their products. Although this may lead to a rise in demand for that entrepreneur's good or service, it does not actually raise the <b>aggregate</b> <b>demand</b> in the economy. The demand merely shifts from one provider to another. Clearly, this is not a long-term solution.|$|E

40|$|The paper draws out an {{analysis}} of the manners of adjusting economy to a shock that affects <b>aggregated</b> <b>demand</b> and offer. The adjusting manner is implemented according to specialized works on the basis of classical monetarist conceptions and Keynes’s conception. At the same time, in order to influence <b>aggregated</b> <b>demand</b> and offer monetary, fiscal, and budget policies are employed. <b>aggregated</b> <b>demand,</b> <b>aggregated</b> offer, labour market and goods and services market balance, adjustment to the values of demand and offer, unfavourable shock upon offer...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we analyze {{the role of}} the {{agriculture}} in the rural and urban development in rural municipal districts. It was elaborated a keynesian model of <b>aggregated</b> <b>demand</b> that allows to analyze the effect of the different components of the <b>aggregated</b> <b>demand</b> on the incomegenerated in a municipal district with rural characteristics. The simulations made indicate thatpublic politics based on the incentive to the <b>aggregated</b> <b>demand</b> can be an important instrument for the development of rural municipal districts. In this sense, they stand out thepolitics gone back to the incentive to the consumption of local goods, which could be accomplished through a distribution of the income that privileged the less favored populations. Thus, politics to improve the income of small farmers through the intensification of yoursproduction systems can {{contribute to the development of}} no-agricultural economic activities,through the amplification of the consumption of goods and local services...|$|R
5|$|The General Theory {{argues that}} demand, not supply, {{is the key}} {{variable}} governing the overall level of economic activity. <b>Aggregate</b> <b>demand,</b> which equals total un-hoarded income in a society, {{is defined by the}} sum of consumption and investment. In a state of unemployment and unused production capacity, one can only enhance employment and total income by first increasing expenditures for either consumption or investment. Without government intervention to increase expenditure, an economy can remain trapped in a low employment equilibrium – the demonstration of this possibility has been described as the revolutionary formal achievement of the work.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the economy}} was already in a mild {{recession}} at this point, conditions worsened substantially after the devaluation of the Mexican peso during December 1994. The economy shrank by 4%, and a dozen banks collapsed. With the labour force continuing to expand and employment falling sharply along with <b>aggregate</b> <b>demand,</b> unemployment rose by over 6% in 6 months. But the government responded effectively: it tightened bank regulation and capital requirements, and encouraged foreign banks to take over weaker local ones. The economy soon recovered and, between 1996 and 1998, both output and employment grew rapidly and unemployment declined substantially. However, {{at the beginning of}} 1999, the Brazilian currency underwent a strong depreciation. The Argentine economy contracted 4% in 1999, and unemployment increased again.|$|E
5|$|With {{the onset}} of the recession, the UK {{government}} lead calls to stimulate <b>aggregate</b> <b>demand.</b> Throughout 2008, a number of fiscal measuresincluding a £145 tax cut for basic rate (below £34,800 pa earnings) tax payers, a temporary 2.5% cut in Value Added Tax (VAT), £3billion worth of spending brought forward from 2010 and a £20billion Small Enterprise Loan Guarantee Schemewere introduced. The cost of these measures, most of which were announced in the November 2008 Pre-Budget Report, was about £20billion excluding counting loan guarantees. Further measures worth £5billionincluding training for the young unemployed and a car scrappage scheme which offered a £2,000 subsidy for the purchase of a new car in exchange for the scrapping of a car more than 10 years oldwere announced in the 2009 budget.|$|E
40|$|This study {{estimates}} an <b>aggregate</b> import <b>demand</b> {{function for}} Thailand. The earlier studies on import demand based on time series date did {{not deal with}} the issue of stationarity of the time series before estimation. Using the cointegration approach, we find <b>aggregate</b> import <b>demand</b> for Thailand to be price inelastic, cross price inelastic (with respect to domestic price) and income inelastic in the short run. In the long run, <b>aggregate</b> import <b>demand</b> is still price inelastic and cross price inelastic. However, <b>aggregate</b> import <b>demand</b> is highly income elastic in the long run.

40|$|The {{aggregated}} EV Project non-residential {{electric vehicle}} supply equipment (EVSE) charging demand in San Diego did not exceed 100 kW {{at any time}} during the third quarter of 2013. 100 kW is typically the minimum <b>aggregated</b> <b>demand</b> useful in demand response actions. The aggregated utilization, in an electric utility service territory, of private non-residential EVSE used for fleet and workplace applications is not likely to provide 100 kW of <b>aggregated</b> <b>demand</b> for a significant time. The aggregated utilization of publicly accessible EVSE would need to increase by a factor of four in order to provide significant demand for utility demand response actions during the period of highest total grid loa...|$|R

25|$|Governments {{implement}} {{fiscal policy}} that influence macroeconomic conditions by adjusting spending and taxation policies to alter <b>aggregate</b> <b>demand.</b> When <b>aggregate</b> <b>demand</b> falls below the potential {{output of the}} economy, there is an output gap where some productive capacity is left unemployed.

25|$|Graphically, non-rivalry {{means that}} if each of several {{individuals}} has a demand curve for a public good, then the individual demand curves are summed vertically to get the <b>aggregate</b> <b>demand</b> curve for the public good.

25|$|For example, {{unemployed}} {{home builders}} can be hired to expand highways. Tax cuts allow consumers {{to increase their}} spending, which boosts <b>aggregate</b> <b>demand.</b> Both tax cuts and spending have multiplier effects where the initial increase in demand from the policy percolates through the economy and generates additional economic activity.|$|E
40|$|We study {{minority}} {{games in}} efficient regime. By incorporating the utility function and aggregating agents with similar strategies we develop an effective mesoscale notion {{of state of}} the game. Using this approach, the game can be represented as a Markov process with substantially reduced number of states with explicitly computable probabilities. For any payoff, the finiteness {{of the number of}} states is proved. Interesting features of an extensive random variable, called <b>aggregated</b> <b>demand,</b> viz. its strong inhomogeneity and presence of patterns in time, can be easily interpreted. Using Markov theory and quenched disorder approach, we can explain important macroscopic characteristics of the game: behavior of variance per capita and predictability of the <b>aggregated</b> <b>demand.</b> We prove that in case of linear payoff many attractors in the state space are possible. ...|$|R

25|$|Governments have {{a vested}} {{interest}} in investing in education and other aspects of human capital infrastructure, especially rapidly developing nations such as those within ASEAN. In the short run, investment spending directly supports <b>aggregate</b> <b>demand</b> and growth.

25|$|Building on {{both the}} {{monetary}} hypothesis of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz {{as well as the}} debt deflation hypothesis of Irving Fisher, Ben Bernanke developed an alternative way in which the financial crisis affected output. He builds on Fisher's argument that dramatic declines in the price level and nominal incomes lead to increasing real debt burdens which in turn leads to debtor insolvency and consequently leads to lowered <b>aggregate</b> <b>demand,</b> a further decline in the price level then results in a debt deflationary spiral. According to Bernanke, a small decline in the price level simply reallocates wealth from debtors to creditors without doing damage to the economy. But when the deflation is severe falling asset prices along with debtor bankruptcies lead to a decline in the nominal value of assets on bank balance sheets. Banks will react by tightening their credit conditions, that in turn leads to a credit crunch which does serious harm to the economy. A credit crunch lowers investment and consumption and results in declining <b>aggregate</b> <b>demand</b> which additionally contributes to the deflationary spiral.|$|E
25|$|Advocates {{also argue}} that single-payer could benefit from a more fluid economy with {{increasing}} economic growth, <b>aggregate</b> <b>demand,</b> corporate profit, and quality of life. Others have estimated a long-term savings amounting to 40% of all national health expenditures due to the extended preventive health care, although estimates from the Congressional Budget Office and The New England Journal of Medicine have found that preventive care is more expensive due to increased utilization.|$|E

25|$|Investment rose {{strongly}} {{in response to}} these measures, {{as well as to the}} concurrent rise in <b>aggregate</b> <b>demand.</b> But the tax exemptions also contributed to a rising public-sector deficit and thereby to the beginning of serious inflationary pressure.

25|$|His {{theory of}} asabiyyah {{has often been}} {{compared}} to modern Keynesian economics, with Ibn Khaldun's theory clearly containing {{the concept of the}} multiplier. A crucial difference, however, is that whereas for John Maynard Keynes it is the middle class's greater propensity to save that is to blame for economic depression, for Ibn Khaldun it is the governmental propensity to save at times when investment opportunities do not take up the slack which leads to <b>aggregate</b> <b>demand.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the 1920s, John Maynard Keynes {{prompted}} a division between microeconomics and macroeconomics. Under Keynesian economics macroeconomic trends can overwhelm economic choices made by individuals.

Monetarism focuses on using the supply and demand of money as a method for controlling economic activity. In the 1970s, monetarism has adapted into supply-side economics which advocates reducing taxes {{as a means to}} increase the amount of money available for economic expansion.|$|E
