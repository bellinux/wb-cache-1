5|$|In 1991, {{the cattle}} station {{was taken over}} by the Muckaty Aboriginal Corporation. The Corporation focused on rehabilitating the land, which had been {{degraded}} by excessive numbers of cattle, and by late 1993 Muckaty had been destocked of cattle for several seasons. On 20December 1991, the Northern Land Council lodged a claim over Muckaty on behalf of traditional owners under the <b>Aboriginal</b> <b>Land</b> Rights Act 1976. The claim was made by members of the seven groups that each has responsibility for different sites and dreamings in the area. In 1997, the <b>Aboriginal</b> <b>Land</b> Commissioner recommended that Muckaty Station be handed back to the traditional owners, and in February 1999, title to the land was returned. At the time there were about 400formal traditional owners, among 1,000people with traditional attachments to the land; some lived on the station, but others were elsewhere in the region, including in the nearby towns of Tennant Creek and Elliott. As Aboriginal Freehold land it is inalienable communal title, and cannot be bought or sold. The pastoral lease holder and manager of the station since 1997 has been Ray Aylett. The Adelaide–Darwin railway, which passes through the western part of Muckaty Station, was completed in early 2004.|$|E
5|$|Numbered Treaties {{were signed}} {{in the late}} 19th century with the chiefs of various First Nations that lived in the area. These {{treaties}} made specific promises of land for every family. As a result, a reserve system was established {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Federal Government. The prescribed amount of land promised to the native peoples was not always given; this led aboriginal groups to assert rights to the land through <b>aboriginal</b> <b>land</b> claims, many of which are still ongoing.|$|E

5|$|As the {{political}} situation deteriorated, Whitlam and his government continued to enact legislation: The Family Law Act 1975 provided for no-fault divorce while the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 caused Australia to ratify the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination that Australia had signed under Holt, but which had never been ratified. In August 1975, Whitlam gave the Gurindji people of the Northern Territory title deeds to part of their traditional lands, beginning the process of <b>Aboriginal</b> <b>land</b> reform. The next month, Australia granted independence to Papua New Guinea.|$|E

He angrily denounced French nuclear testing in the Pacific, and after consistently voting for the ruling Liberal Party coalition as it ruled for the past few decades, signed an open letter backing the opposition Labor Party of Gough Whitlam, which took power in 1972. However, he soon spoke out against Whitlam's lack of action against tobacco advertising and French nuclear tests. Burnet often found himself frustrated with the refusal of politicians to base policy on long-term objectives, such as the sustainability of human life.|$|E

5|$|In January 1861, Tom, Horatio and a {{party of}} {{employees}} and their families travelled by steamer to Brisbane, disembarked in Moreton Bay, and then, with livestock and supplies, set out on an eight-month trek through Queensland's rugged interior. Food was scarce and Tom hunted native game to fend off starvation. They suffered many other hardships and even death when, in Toowoomba, one of Horatio's men drowned. On the Darling Downs over 10,000 sheep were collected. The size of the Wills party {{attracted the attention of}} local Aborigines, and the two groups engaged in games of mimicry. Wary of entering the region's frontier war, Horatio maintained a conciliatory attitude to the Aborigines. The party reached Cullin-la-ringo, situated on Kairi <b>Aboriginal</b> <b>land,</b> in early October, and proceeded to set up camp.|$|E
5|$|A reformist, Dunstan brought {{profound}} {{change to}} South Australian society. His socially progressive administration saw <b>Aboriginal</b> <b>land</b> rights recognised, homosexuality decriminalised, {{the first female}} judge appointed, the first non-British governor, Sir Mark Oliphant, and later, the first indigenous governor Sir Douglas Nicholls. He enacted consumer protection laws, reformed and expanded the public education and health systems, abolished the death penalty, relaxed censorship and drinking laws, created a ministry for the environment, enacted anti-discrimination law, and implemented electoral reforms such as the overhaul of the Legislative Council of parliament, lowered the voting age to 18, enacted universal suffrage, and completely abolished malapportionment, changes which gave him a less hostile parliament and allowed him to enact his reforms. He established Rundle Mall, enacted measures to protect buildings of historical heritage, and encouraged a flourishing of the arts, with support for the Adelaide Festival Centre, the State Theatre Company, {{and the establishment of}} the South Australian Film Corporation. He encouraged cultural exchanges with Asia, multiculturalism and an increase in the state's culinary awareness and sophistication. He is recognised for his role in reinvigorating the social, artistic and cultural life of South Australia during his nine years in office, remembered as the Dunstan Decade. However, there were also problems; the economy began to stagnate, and the large increases to burgeoning public service generated claims of waste. One of Dunstan's pet projects, a plan to build a new city at Monarto to alleviate urban pressures in Adelaide, was abandoned when economic and population growth stalled, with much money and planning already invested. After four consecutive election wins, Dunstan's administration began to falter in 1978 following his dismissal of Police Commissioner Harold Salisbury, as controversy broke out over whether he had improperly interfered with a judicial investigation. In addition, policy problems and unemployment began to mount, as well as unsubstantiated rumours of corruption and personal impropriety. Dunstan became increasingly short-tempered, and the strain was increased by the death of his second wife. His resignation from the premiership and politics in 1979 was abrupt after collapsing due to ill health, but he would live for another 20 years, remaining a vocal and outspoken campaigner for progressive social policy.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year, the Fraser government (1975–1983) {{amended the}} <b>Aboriginal</b> <b>Land</b> (Northern Territory) Bill by introducing the <b>Aboriginal</b> <b>Land</b> Rights (Northern Territory) Bill.

It is significant however that this legislation was implemented at all, given the political allegiances of the Fraser Government, and shows the level of community support for social justice for Aboriginal people at the time.|$|E

The appointment was criticised by Aboriginal groups both for his lack of judicial experience and his history of defending developers accused of desecrating Aboriginal sacred sites. The Reeves Report was released in August 1998, and advocated sweeping changes to land rights legislation, including the scrapping of permits for access to <b>Aboriginal</b> <b>land,</b> granting the Northern Territory Government compulsory acquisition powers over <b>Aboriginal</b> <b>land,</b> and scrapping the <b>Aboriginal</b> <b>land</b> councils in favour of a new body.

30|$|For example, on <b>Aboriginal</b> <b>lands,</b> fire {{probability}} {{rises in}} July and remains relatively constant until October (Figure 5). Fire probability on <b>Aboriginal</b> <b>lands</b> and elsewhere declines sharply with distance from road {{early in the}} dry season, reflecting management in inhabited areas (Bowman et al. 2004). Late-season fires, which often travel tens of kilometres, reduce the effect of proximity to roads as the late season progresses. However, overall, the probability of fire on <b>Aboriginal</b> <b>lands</b> remains relatively constant throughout the dry season, {{and the number of}} return fires to the same area is lower. This is consistent with the contemporary and historical Aboriginal practice of multiple small, patchy burns throughout the dry season, starting on the upland areas and hills and moving towards lower lying (and hence wetter) areas as grass cures (Yibarbuk et al. 2001, Vigilante 2001, Preece 2002, Bowman et al. 2007 b).|$|R

These findings illustrate the impact of different management paradigms and cultural decisions about fire on physical fire patterns.|$|R
