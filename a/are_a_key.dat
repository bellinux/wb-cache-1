5|$|In biology, Holliday {{junctions}} <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> intermediate in {{many types}} of genetic recombination, {{as well as in}} double-strand break repair. These junctions usually have a symmetrical sequence and are thus mobile, meaning that the four individual arms may slide through the junction in a specific pattern that largely preserves base pairing. Additionally, four-arm junctions similar to Holliday junctions appear in some functional RNA molecules.|$|E
5|$|MFGM {{phospholipid}} components such as phosphatidylcholine <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> constituent of {{the intestinal}} mucus barrier, and therefore {{may contribute to}} intestinal defense against invasive pathogens. Sphingolipids, including sphingomyelin, {{are present in the}} apical membrane of the gut epithelia, and are also important for maintaining membrane structure, modulating growth factor receptors, and serving competitive binding inhibitors for microorganisms, microbial toxins, and viruses. Gangliosides are also present in intestinal mucosa and may possibly contribute to improved gut microflora and antibacterial defense.|$|E
5|$|Marine {{halfbeaks}} are omnivores {{feeding on}} algae; marine {{plants such as}} seagrasses; plankton; invertebrates such as pteropods and crustaceans; and smaller fishes. For some subtropical species at least, juveniles are more predatory than adults. Some tropical species feed on animals {{during the day and}} plants at night, while other species alternate between carnivory in the summer and herbivory in the winter. They are in turn eaten by many ecologically and commercially important fish, such as billfish, mackerel, and sharks, and so <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> link between trophic levels.|$|E

5|$|Nielsen {{is perhaps}} most closely {{associated}} outside Denmark with his six symphonies, written between 1892 and 1925. The works have much in common: they are all just over 30 minutes long, brass instruments <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> component of the orchestration, and they all exhibit unusual changes in tonality, which heighten the dramatic tension. From its opening bars, Symphony No. 1 (Op. 7, 1890–92), while reflecting the influence of Grieg and Brahms, shows Nielsen's individuality. In the Second (Op. 16, 1901–02), Nielsen embarks {{on the development of}} human character. Inspiration came from a painting in an inn depicting the four temperaments (choleric, phlegmatic, melancholic and sanguine).|$|E

25|$|Calcium {{transients}} in spines <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> {{trigger for}} synaptic plasticity. NMDA receptors, {{which have a}} high permeability for calcium, only conduct ions if the membrane potential is suffiently depolarized. The amount of calcium entering a spine during synaptic activity therefore depends on the depolarization of the spine head. Evidence from calcium imaging experiments (two-photon microscopy) and from compartmental modelling indicates that spines with high resistance necks experience larger calcium transients during synaptic activity.|$|E

Most varieties of pyroxene consist of permutations of Ca2+, Fe2+ and Mg2+ to balance the negative charge on the backbone.

Tablets from Nuzi, Alalakh, and other cities with Hurrian populations (as shown by personal names) reveal Hurrian cultural features even though they were written in Akkadian.

25|$|Floods (in {{particular}} {{more frequent}} or smaller floods) can also bring many benefits, such as recharging ground water, making soil more fertile and increasing nutrients in some soils.

Freshwater floods particularly {{play an important role}} in maintaining ecosystems in river corridors and <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> factor in maintaining floodplain biodiversity.
