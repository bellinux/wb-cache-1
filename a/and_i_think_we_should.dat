500|$|The {{urgency of}} {{negotiating}} a concession {{was made clear}} to Rhodes {{during a visit to}} London in June 1888, when he learned of the London syndicate's letter to Knutsford, and of their appointment of Maund. Rhodes now understood that the Matabeleland concession could still go elsewhere if he did not secure the document quickly. [...] "Someone has to get the country, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have the best chance," [...] Rhodes told Rothschild; [...] "I have always been afraid of the difficulty of dealing with the Matabele king. He is the only block to central Africa, as, once we have his territory, the rest is easy... the rest is simply a village system with separate headmen... I have faith in the country, and Africa is on the move. I think it is a second Cinderella." ...|$|E
2500|$|On November 9, 2009, Robertson {{said that}} Islam is [...] "a violent {{political}} system bent on {{the overthrow of}} the governments of the world and world domination". He went on to elaborate that [...] "you're dealing with not a religion, you're dealing with a political system, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> treat it as such, and treat its adherents as such as we would members of the communist party, members of some fascist group".|$|E
2500|$|Christie {{questioned}} {{the policy of}} allowing three dedicated lanes, saying [...] "I didn't know Fort Lee got three dedicated lanes until all this stuff happened, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> review that entire policy. Because I don't know why Fort Lee needs three dedicated lanes {{to tell you the}} truth," [...] and [...] "the fact that one town has three lanes dedicated to it? That kind of gets me sauced [...]" [...] However, members of the New Jersey Assembly Transportation Committee said at a November 25, 2013, hearing that the Fort Lee entrance has been used by an even greater number of commuters from the surrounding Bergen County towns. PA officials, including Patrick Foye, confirmed that assessment in their sworn testimony at the committee hearing on December 9, 2013.|$|E

2500|$|While United {{were eager}} to extend the loan deal, Larsson stated {{that he had made}} a promise to his family and his club to return on 12 March. This was {{confirmed}} on 20 February, when Larsson announced {{that he would not be}} extending his loan period. Despite this, Sir Alex Ferguson was full of praise for the striker, who scored 3 goals in 13 matches in all competitions during his three-month stay, saying, [...] "He's been fantastic for us, his professionalism, his attitude, everything he's done has been excellent." [...] "We would love him to stay but, obviously, he has made his promise to his family and Helsingborg <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> respect that – but I would have done anything to keep him." [...] Larsson scored Manchester United's only goal in their win against Lille at Old Trafford in the Champions League. He made his final appearance for United on 10 March in an FA Cup sixth round tie away to Middlesbrough, ending in a 2–2 draw.|$|E
6000|$|A {{few minutes}} later, the Spaniard crossed the after well. [...] "Now," [...] he said, [...] "we must decide when {{we ought to}} have our {{interview}} with Señor Kenwardine, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> put it off until just before we land." ...|$|E
6000|$|There was a supper-tray {{after we}} got home at night, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> all have enjoyed ourselves, but for a rather disagreeable {{domestic}} occurrence. Mr. Pocket was in good spirits, when a housemaid came in, and said, [...] "If you please, sir, I should wish to speak to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] agreed Louise; [...] "we all would. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> {{could turn}} out a very creditable paper--for Millville. But wouldn't it {{cost a lot of}} money?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The fairies, of course, {{you have}} invited? It {{has always been}} usual, in our family, on an {{occasion}} like this; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> have neglected them a little of late." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have put}} up a good fight, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> shall win; but, while you will {{understand}} me better by-and-by what you have offered me almost hurts," [...] he said.|$|R

"I don't know that; I have {{reflected}} coolly in the matter, after I got over my mortification; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have been flogged, had we attacked the French at sea. Your own plan was better, and capitally carried out. Harkee, Miles, this much will I do, {{and not a}} jot more.

Still you will be sixteen {{by the time we}} can arrive there, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> be able to manage. Besides, as you say, we can hire a man or two to help, and shall have some money to fall back upon until things begin to pay. There are plenty of women who manage even without the assistance of a son, and I do not know why I should {{not be able to get}} on with you and Marion to help me, especially as farming is a comparatively simple business, in a new country. At any rate, as you say, with two or three cows and plenty of ducks and hens, and what we can grow on the ground, there will be no fear of our starving." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{will try}} again, being a giant {{refreshed}} {{by the house}} being empty. The presence of people is the great obstacle to letter-writing. I deny that letters should contain news (I mean mine; those of other people should). But mine should contain appropriate sentiments and humorous nonsense, or nonsense without the humour. When the house is empty, the mind is seized with a desire--no, that is too strong--a willingness to pour forth unmitigated rot, which constitutes (in me) the true spirit of correspondence. When I have no remarks to offer (and nobody to offer them to), my pen flies, {{and you see the}} remarkable consequence of a page literally covered with words and genuinely devoid of sense. I can always do that, if quite alone, and I like doing it; but I have yet to learn that it is beloved by correspondents. The deuce of it is, that there is no end possible but the end of the paper; and as there is very little left of that--if I cannot stop writing--suppose you give up reading. It would all come to the same thing; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> all be happier....|$|E

60|$|The {{last point}} to which I may advert is one which {{concerns}} {{the action of}} the profession itself more than anything else. We have arrangements for teaching, we have arrangements for the testing of qualifications, we have marvellous aids and appliances for the treatment of disease in all sorts of ways; but I do not find in London at the present time, in this little place of four or five million inhabitants which supports so many things, any organisation or any arrangement for advancing the science of medicine, considered as a pure science. I am quite aware that there are medical societies of various kinds; I am not ignorant of the lectureships at the College of Physicians and the College of Surgeons; there is the Brown Institute; and there is the Society for the Advancement of Medicine by Research, but there is no means, so far as I know, by which any person who has the inborn gifts of the investigator and discoverer of new truth, and who desires to apply that to the improvement of medical science, can carry out his intention. In Paris there is the University of Paris, which gives degrees; but there are also the Sorbonne and the Collége de France, places in which professoriates are established {{for the express purpose of}} enabling men who have the power of investigation, the power of advancing knowledge and thereby reacting on practice, to do that which it is their special mission to do. I do not know of anything of the kind in London; and if it should so happen that a Claude Bernard or a Ludwig should turn up in London, I really have not the slightest notion of what we could do with him. We could not turn him to account, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have to export him to Germany or France. I doubt whether that is a good or a wise condition of things. I do not think it is a condition of things which can exist for any great length of time, now that people are every day becoming more and more awake to the importance of scientific investigation and to the astounding and unexpected manner in which it everywhere reacts upon practical pursuits. I should look upon the establishment of some institution of that kind as a recognition on the part of the medical profession in general, that if their great and beneficent work is to be carried on, they must, like other people who have great and beneficent work to do, contribute to the advancement of knowledge in the only way in which experience shows that it can be advanced.|$|E

5000|$|Rumours that then-President Thabo Mbeki was a philandererwere {{controversially}} {{brought to}} light by a comment Du Preez made on a national radio show in 2001.

5000|$|Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, {{during the}} launch of PNB at the White House on April 27, 2010, said, [...] "These {{projects}} can go much further to strengthening the bonds between the United States and the citizens of Muslim-majority nations, {{and to do so}} based on a philosophy - <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> keep repeating these words - mutual understanding, mutual interests, and mutual respect...

5000|$|In January 2010, {{prior to}} the {{election}} that brought him to power in May 2010, Cameron said in response to George Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, who worried about strain on the British tradition of hospitality: [...] "In the last decade, net immigration in some years has been sort of 200,000, so implying a 2 million increase over a decade, which I think is too much. We {{would like to see}} net immigration {{in the tens of thousands}} rather than the hundreds of thousands. I don’t think that’s unrealistic.

The tipster believed that Corchado was the target, and urged that he leave Mexico at once. Corchado phoned some “colleagues who were preparing a celebration dinner for me that evening” - {{he had just been}} awarded the Maria Moors Cabot Prize - and “said, there’s a death threat <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> cancel dinner.
