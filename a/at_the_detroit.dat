In May 1781, Indian leaders and Indian Department officials began to gather warriors at the Wyandot town of Upper Sandusky for this purpose. In mid-August, Brant and George Girty, Simon's brother, headed south to the Ohio River with about 90 Iroquois, Shawnee, and Wyandot warriors, {{as well as a}} few white men, while McKee and Simon Girty continued to collect reinforcements.|$|E

5|$|Born in Birmingham, Alabama, {{he moved}} {{with his family to}} Decatur, Illinois at age11. Prior to his senior year in high school, his family moved to Detroit. In 1945, {{following}} Fonville's lone track season at Detroit's Miller High School, he was named Michigan High School Track & Field Athlete of the Year for his first-place performance <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Detroit</b> City League Meet. Fonville's winning effort in the shot put was five feet better than that of the state champion. Later that summer, Charlie Fonville and Jessie Nimmons competed in the Detroit YMCA Track Championship as a two-man team for the St. Antoine YMCA; Fonville won the 100m, 200m, high jump, and shot put. Fonville and Nimmons won the 440yard relay, with each of them running 220yard legs. They were later disqualified for not having four runners. They finished in second place at the meet; their disqualification in the 440 preventing them from winning.|$|E
5|$|Fat Freddy's Drop {{returned}} to touring New Zealand, Australia and Europe {{to promote the}} new album in 2009. Three shows {{on the west coast}} of the United States, and a show in Canada, were also included in the tour. The only previous time the band had played in the United States was a single performance <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Detroit</b> Electronic Music festival in 2004. Before 2009, the cost of touring in the US, difficulty obtaining visas, and the band's low profile in North America prevented them from including tour dates there. Band members say they now consider playing together as Fat Freddy's Drop their first musical priority, and spend less time playing with other bands.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1847, Detroit {{fought to}} {{maintain}} the Capitol within its jurisdiction, but communities in the growing {{western part of the}} state had many reasons for wanting a move inland, including the need to increase defensibility by moving the state government away from the Canada–US border. Detroit had been occupied during the War of 1812, and the border area of Michigan of less than a mile between Detroit and Windsor, Ontario, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Detroit</b> River continued to be occupied by British troops on both banks. Proponents of moving the capitol also sought to promote settlement and the economy in the interior, as well as making the government more accessible to the people throughout the state.|$|E

5|$|The Gallery {{was located}} in the Palais Leuchtenberg, {{the house of the}} Leuchtenberg family in Munich, built by Leo von Klenze between 1817 and 1821. It was opened to the public from at least 1837 on. The {{collection}} was catalogued in French and German from 1825 on, with a new version in German from 1841 on, and in an illustrated catalogue in English in 1852. After the death of Duke Maximilian in 1852, the Gallery was closed, the collection divided between his children, and the Palace sold to Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria. Part of the collection was transferred to Saint Petersburg in 1854, where it was displayed in the Mariinsky Palace, and from 1870 on was lent to the Imperial Academy of Arts. The remainder moved together with Eugen Maximilianovich, Duke of Leuchtenberg, from Munich to Saint Petersburg in 1863. While the collection was still growing in the 1860s with purchases by Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia, {{by the end of the}} century, some works were being sold off. The majority of the collection remained together until the Russian Revolution in 1917, when it was dispersed and a number of paintings sold in Sweden. Many works were acquired by the Hermitage and the Pushkin Museum, with others ending up in museums all over the world. For example, Parmigianino's Circumcision of Jesus is now housed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Detroit</b> Institute of Arts. The remaining works are either lost or in private collections.|$|E
