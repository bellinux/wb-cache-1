2500|$|An {{electric}} dipole antenna {{was used to}} study the electric fields of plasmas, while two search coil magnetic antennas studied the magnetic fields. The {{electric dipole}} antenna was mounted {{at the tip of}} the magnetometer boom. The search coil magnetic antennas were mounted on the high-gain <b>antenna</b> <b>feed.</b> Nearly simultaneous measurements of the electric and magnetic field spectrum allowed electrostatic waves to be distinguished from electromagnetic waves. The PWS weighed [...] and used an average of 9.8 watts.|$|E
2500|$|The P-19 shares {{many of the}} {{physical}} features of the previous P-15 radar, the P-19 is a high mobility radar and with the antenna mounted on the single truck (Zil-131) with the electronic equipment contained in a second truck. The P-19 uses two open frame elliptical parabolic antenna accomplishing both transmission and reception, each antenna being fed by a single <b>antenna</b> <b>feed</b> {{in a similar fashion}} to the P-15. The radar can rapidly shift its frequency to one of four pre-set frequencies to avoid active interference with passive interference being removed by a coherent doppler filter. Azimuth was determined by mechanical scanning with an associated accompanying PRV-11 (NATO reporting name [...] "Side Net") used to determine elevation. A secondary radar for IFF is generally used in conjunction with the P-15, generally the 1L22 [...] "Parol". The armed forces of the Czech Republic described the P-19 as having [...] "outstanding mechanical parameters, simple maintenance, overall reliability and multifunctionality". This evaluation was mirrored by a French evaluation of a radar captured in Chad in 1987 during the Chadian–Libyan conflict, describing the P-19 as sturdy, with good low altitude detection and high resistance to countermeasures.|$|E
50|$|In the {{electromechanical}} antenna {{switching systems}} employed before solid state antenna switching systems were introduced, the blending was {{a by-product of}} the way the motorized switches worked. These switches brushed a coaxial cable past 50 (or 48) <b>antenna</b> <b>feeds.</b> As the cable moved between two <b>antenna</b> <b>feeds,</b> it would couple signal into both.|$|R

2500|$|Ulysses was {{spin-stabilised}} {{about its}} z-axis which roughly {{coincides with the}} axis of the dish antenna. [...] The RTG, whip antennas, and instrument boom were placed to stabilize this axis, with the spin rate nominally at 5rpm. [...] Inside the body was a hydrazine fuel tank. Hydrazine monopropellant was used for course corrections inbound to Jupiter, and later used exclusively to repoint the spin axis (and thus, the antenna) at Earth. [...] The spacecraft was controlled by eight thrusters in two blocks. [...] Thrusters were pulsed in the time domain to perform rotation or translation. [...] Four Sun sensors detected orientation. [...] For fine attitude control, the S-band <b>antenna</b> <b>feed</b> was mounted slightly off-axis. [...] This offset feed combined with the spacecraft spin introduced an oscillation to an S-band radio signal transmitted from Earth when received on board the spacecraft. The amplitude and phase of this oscillation was proportional to {{the orientation of the}} spin axis relative to the Earth direction. This method of determining the relative orientation is called CONSCAN and was used by early radars for automated tracking of targets and also very common in early infra-red guided missiles.|$|E

5000|$|The {{pattern of}} {{electric}} and magnetic fields {{at the mouth}} of a parabolic antenna is simply a scaled up image of the fields radiated by the <b>feed</b> <b>antenna,</b> so the polarization is determined by the <b>feed</b> <b>antenna.</b> In order to achieve maximum gain, the <b>feed</b> <b>antenna</b> in the transmitting and receiving antenna must have the same polarization. [...] For example, a vertical dipole <b>feed</b> <b>antenna</b> will radiate a beam of radio waves with their electric field vertical, called vertical polarization. The receiving <b>feed</b> <b>antenna</b> must also have vertical polarization to receive them; if the feed is horizontal (horizontal polarization) the antenna will suffer a severe loss of gain.|$|R

This paper also includes the radiation characteristics of the two different feeding techniques simulated using Ansoft HFSS 13. 0 software.

50|$|In {{measuring}} the impedance or radiation pattern {{of a balanced}} antenna using a coaxial cable, {{it is important to}} place a balun between the cable and the <b>antenna</b> <b>feed.</b> Unbalanced currents that may otherwise flow on the cable will make the measured antenna impedance sensitive to the configuration of the feed cable, and the radiation pattern of small antennas may be distorted by radiation from the cable.|$|E
50|$|The 8.8 m {{diameter}} parabolic antenna, using a Cassegrain <b>antenna</b> <b>feed,</b> had a 0.4° beamwidth and {{a gain of}} 51 dB. Its monopulse, 5 horn {{feed system}} permitted the reference and error antenna patterns to have their gains independently established {{as well as the}} slope of the error patterns optimized while supplying target return signals to the receiving system with a minimum of insertion loss.|$|E
50|$|In simple <b>antennas</b> the <b>feed</b> usually {{consists}} of the <b>feed</b> <b>antenna</b> (driven element), {{the part of the}} antenna which actually converts the radio frequency currents to radio waves or vice versa, and the feed line (transmission line), which connects the <b>feed</b> <b>antenna</b> with the receiver or transmitter. For example, in a rooftop Yagi television <b>antenna,</b> the <b>feed</b> {{consists of}} a dipole driven element, which converts the radio waves to an electric current, and a coaxial cable or twin lead transmission line which conducts the received signal from the driven element into the house to the television receiver. The rest of the antenna consists of rods called parasitic elements, which strengthen reception from a given direction.|$|R
50|$|The <b>feed</b> <b>antenna</b> at the reflector's {{focus is}} {{typically}} a low-gain type {{such as a}} half-wave dipole or more often a small horn <b>antenna</b> called a <b>feed</b> horn.

50|$|The three {{channel signal}} outputs of the <b>antenna</b> <b>feed</b> system were {{supplied}} {{directly to the}} receiving system without undergoing any additional loss-inducing signal manipulation with bandwidths optimized for the specified pulse widths of 0.5, 0.75, 1.0 and 2.4 microseconds and the receiver noise figure of 7.5 dB was improved to 3.5 dB through the addition of closed-cycle parametric RF amplifiers. This system ensured a dynamic range in excess of 120 dB.|$|E
