25|$|The {{principal}} {{mechanism of}} ventilation in VIP latrines is the <b>action</b> <b>of</b> <b>wind</b> blowing {{across the top}} of the vent pipe. The wind creates a strong circulation of air through the superstructure, down through the squat hole, across the pit and up and out of the vent pipe. Unpleasant fecal odors from the pit contents are thus sucked up and exhausted out of vent pipe, leaving the superstructure odor-free. In some cases solar-powered fans are added giving a constant outwards flow from the vent pipe.|$|E
500|$|... "Rowin Foula doon!" [...] {{refers to}} the fishermens' {{practice}} of rowing their open fishing boat out to sea until the high cliffs of Foula were no longer visible. This entailed the boat being some [...] west of Papa Stour. The 'tide-lumps' are increased swells of unusual size due to the combined <b>action</b> <b>of</b> <b>wind</b> against tide. The resonant final image of the piece is of the fishermen being led back home to Papa by the 'scent o flooers' across the water. This {{is an example of}} Vagaland's ability to create a vivid sensual impression of a situation. An extra layer of meaning is added by the knowledge that Da Horn o Papa collapsed in a storm around the time of this poem's composition, so that it is a tribute not just to a lost way of life, but a noted geographical feature.|$|E

50|$|Sea ice {{does not}} simply grow and melt. During its lifespan, it is very dynamic. Due to the {{combined}} <b>action</b> <b>of</b> <b>winds,</b> currents, water temperature, and air temperature fluctuations, sea ice expanses typically undergo {{a significant amount of}} deformation. Sea ice is classified according to {{whether or not it is}} able to drift, and according to its age.|$|R
500|$|Monsoons {{are caused}} by the larger {{amplitude}} of the seasonal cycle of land temperature {{compared to that of}} nearby oceans. This differential warming happens because heat in the ocean is mixed vertically through a [...] "mixed layer" [...] that may be fifty meters deep, through the <b>action</b> <b>of</b> <b>wind</b> and buoyancy-generated turbulence, whereas the land surface conducts heat slowly, with the seasonal signal penetrating perhaps a meter or so. [...] Additionally, the specific heat capacity of liquid water is significantly higher than that of most materials that make up land. [...] Together, these factors mean that the heat capacity of the layer participating in the seasonal cycle is much larger over the oceans than over land, with the consequence that the air over the land warms faster and reaches a higher temperature than the air over the ocean. The hot air over the land tends to rise, creating an area of low pressure. This creates a steady wind blowing toward the land, bringing the moist near-surface air over the oceans with it. [...] Similar rainfall is caused by the moist ocean air being lifted upwards by mountains, surface heating, convergence at the surface, divergence aloft, or from storm-produced outflows at the surface. However the lifting occurs, the air cools due expansion in lower pressure, which in turn produces condensation.|$|E
60|$|Fifty sciences! This greatly {{astonished}} the strangers, {{but they}} were told by the residents that all {{the knowledge of the}} highly cultivated Arabs of Bagdad and the Moors of Spain had been handed on to the select few of their African descendants, and that really beautiful poetry was still produced by the Marabouts. Certainly no one present could doubt of the architectural skill and taste of the Algerines, and Mr. Thompson declared that not a tithe of the wonders of their mechanical art had been seen, describing the wonderful silver tree of Tlemcen, covered with birds, who, by the <b>action</b> <b>of</b> <b>wind,</b> were made to produce the songs of each different species which they represented, till a falcon on the topmost branch uttered a harsh cry, and all became silent. General education had, however, fallen to a low ebb among the population, and the wisdom of the ancients was chiefly concentrated among the higher class of Marabouts, whose headquarters were at Bugia, and their present chief, Hadji Eseb Ben Hassan, had the reputation of a saint, which the Consuls believed to be well founded.|$|E
60|$|By {{the end of}} a fortnight, the new top-timbers {{were all}} in their places, and secured, while a {{complete}} set of bends were brought to them, and were well bolted. The caulking-irons were put in requisition as soon as a streak was on, the whole work advancing, as it might be, pari passu. Planks for the decks were much wanted, for, in the terrible strait for fuel which had caused the original assault on the schooner, this portion of the vessel had been the first burned, as of the most combustible materials. The quarter-deck of the Vineyard craft, luckily, was entire, and its planks so far answered an excellent purpose. They served to make a new quarter-deck for the repairs, but the whole of the main-deck and forecastle remained to be provided for. Materials were gleaned from different parts of the two vessels, until a reasonably convenient, and a perfectly safe deck was laid over the whole craft, the coamings for the hatches being taken from Daggett's schooner, which had not been broken up in those parts. It is scarcely necessary to say that the ice had early melted from the rocks of the coast. The caverns all disappeared within {{the first week of the}} thaw, the attitudes into which the cakes had been thrown greatly favouring the melting process, by exposing so much surface to the joint <b>action</b> <b>of</b> <b>wind,</b> rain, and sun. What was viewed as a favourable augury, the seals began to reappear. There was a remote portion of the coast, from which the ice had been driven by the winds around the north-west cape, that was already alive with them. Alas! these animals no longer awakened cupidity in the breasts of the sealers. The last no longer thought of gain, but simply of saving their lives, and of restoring themselves to the humble places they had held in the world, previously to having come on this ill-fated voyage.|$|E

40|$|Both {{marine and}} urban aerosols, which {{differ in their}} origin and {{chemical}} composition, are subjected to strong dynamic processes in the coastal areas, especially over strongly urbanised areas. The simultaneous presence of both types of aerosols leads to their effective mixing due to the <b>action</b> <b>of</b> <b>winds</b> and convection.

40|$|The paper {{compares the}} RC {{structure}} of a cooling tower unit under seismic loads and under strong wind loads. The calculated values of the envelopes of the displacements and the internal forces due to seismic loading states are compared with the envelopes of the loading states due to the dead, operational and live loads, wind and temperature actions. The seismic effect {{takes into account the}} seismic area of ground motion 0. 3 g and the ductility properties of a relatively rigid structure. The ductility is assessed as the reduction in seismic load. In this case the <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> <b>wind</b> pressure are higher than the seismicity effect under ductility correction. The seismic effects, taking into account the ductility properties of the structure, are lower than the <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wind</b> pressure. The other static loads, especially temperature action due to the environment and surface insulation are very important for the design of the structure. ...|$|R

It is shown that a three-dimensional current system generated by the dynamo <b>action</b> <b>of</b> <b>winds</b> is located at altitudes less than about 200 km basically. It {{does not depend on}} an ionosphere condition in upper layers and weaker field-aligned currents between the northern and southern hemispheres practically, and an almost complete closed current circuit is generated in the dynamo layer.|$|R

40|$|The humic {{substances}} were {{extracted from}} sediments, water and soil {{close to the}} Lagoa dos Patos-MS. The characterization was performed through fluorescence emission. In the HSs {{it is possible to}} see strong indications of incorporation of compounds originating from lignin degradation, confirmed by fluorescence emission (EEM and synchronous spectra). These differences observed in HSs may be due to tropical regions displaying a great variety of vascular plants and aquatic macrophytes that contribute natural organic matter. The seasonality effect also causes the entrance of pedogenic material and the suspension of sediments by the <b>action</b> <b>of</b> <b>winds...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{improvement}} {{of land management}} practices and control of fire is a direct human influence on the habitat conditions needed for the growth and development of blowout penstemon populations. In addition to these management plans, land managers may also reshape the blowouts with machinery to reduce the swirling <b>action</b> <b>of</b> <b>winds.</b> There are several common ways of leveling off the sharp edges of the blowouts. Mechanical means are often used to reshape the blowouts. Cattle are used to reshape the land and provide a layer of litter and debris.|$|R

40|$|Wind loads on {{buildings}} can {{be quantified}} through synchronous measurements of pressure over building model surfaces or by high frequency force balance (HFFB) measurements. Although this loading infor-mation can be directly utilized for building design applications, current design practice often requires the transformation <b>of</b> dynamic <b>wind</b> loading to the equivalent static wind loads (ESWLs). This paper addresses prediction <b>of</b> <b>wind</b> load effects and modeling of associated ESWLs of buildings with uncoupled mode shapes of vibration. Both building response in primary directions and that contributed by the combined <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> <b>wind</b> loads in different directions are studied. Various approaches used {{in the development of}} ESWLs associated with the peak <b>wind</b> load effects <b>of</b> buildings are critically evaluated with some new insights that lead to improved modeling <b>of</b> <b>wind</b> loading for design applications...|$|R

50|$|A rocky {{body with}} a thick {{atmosphere}} does not have significant craters on its surface. The friction generated when a meteor enters an atmosphere causes {{the vast majority of}} it to burn up before hitting the surface. When meteors do impact, the effects are often erased by the <b>action</b> <b>of</b> <b>wind.</b> As a result, craters are rare on objects with atmospheres.|$|E
50|$|A {{cleaning}} {{event is}} a phenomenon whereby dust is removed from solar panels, particularly ones on Mars, by the <b>action</b> <b>of</b> <b>wind.</b> The term cleaning event is used on several NASA webpages; generally the term is used {{in reference to the}} fact that Martian winds have blown dust clear off the solar panels of probes on Mars increasing their energy output.|$|E
50|$|Surface {{erosion of}} {{the surface of a}} levee is usually caused by the <b>action</b> <b>of</b> <b>wind</b> and water (waves but also normal flow). Erosion can be worsened by {{pre-existing}} or new damage to a levee. Areas with no surface protection are more prone to erosion. A levee grazed by certain types of animals, like sheep, can show trails used by the animals where grass does not grow.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical study {{on how the}} significance <b>of</b> <b>wind</b> <b>action</b> differs when varying the wave parameters. The quasi arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian finite element method (QALE-FEM) is used for this purpose. An improved model for wind-excited pressure and wind-driven current, which is recently developed by {{the authors of this}} paper [27], is coupled with the QALE-FEM. Many cases involving freak waves with different focusing time/point and frequency ranges under the <b>action</b> <b>of</b> <b>winds</b> are investigated. The results show that the significance <b>of</b> <b>wind</b> <b>actions</b> on freak waves strongly depends on the focusing time, the focusing point and the frequency range. The knowledge does not only help the proper set up <b>of</b> experiments studying <b>wind</b> effects on freak waves but also contributes {{to the development of a}} method for predicting freak waves...|$|R
60|$|In summer, {{changes in}} the motions of the ice {{take place in the}} most {{unexpected}} manner. Currents in the ocean are, no doubt, the chief cause <b>of</b> these; the <b>action</b> <b>of</b> <b>winds</b> has also something to do with them. One of these changes was now taking place. Almost before the men got on board the ice had separated, and long canals of water were seen opening up here and there. Soon after that a light breeze sprang up, the ice-anchors were taken aboard, the sails trimmed, and soon the Hope was again making her way slowly but steadily to the north.|$|R
