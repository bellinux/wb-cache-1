50|$|The {{cytotoxicity}} {{was investigated}} on healthy <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophage</b> cells obtained from adult guinea pigs for single-wall nanotubes (SWNTs), multi-wall nanotubes (with diameters ranging from 10 to 20 nm, MWNT10), and fullerene (C60) for comparison purposes. Profound cytotoxicity of SWNTs {{was observed in}} <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophage</b> (AM) after a 6-hour exposure in vitro. The cytotoxicity increased by as high as ~35% when the dosage of SWNTs was increased by 11.30 µg/cm2. No significant toxicity was observed for C60 up to a dose of 226.00 µg/cm2. The cytotoxicity apparently followed a sequence order on a mass basis: SWNTs > MWNT10 > quartz > C60. SWNTs significantly impaired phagocytosis of AM at the low dose of 0.38 µg/cm2, whereas MWNT10 and C60 induced injury only at the high dose of 3.06 µg/cm2. The macrophages exposed to SWNTs or MWNT10 of 3.06 µg/cm2 showed characteristic features of necrosis and degeneration. A sign of apoptotic cell death likely existed. It was concluded from the study that carbon nanomaterials with different geometric structures exhibit quite different cytotoxicity and bioactivity in vitro, although {{they may not be}} accurately reflected in the comparative toxicity in vivo.|$|E

40|$|Chronic {{administration}} of corticosteroids {{has been used}} to induce pulmonary infection in animals. but the specific mechanisms by which corticosteroids modulate pulmonary host defence have not been clarified. Specifically, little is known about how corticosteroids influence the function of lung cells, such as <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages.</b> Cytotoxicity and interleukin- 1 elaboration are two important mechanisms of macrophage defence against pathogens. To determine whether chronic {{administration of}} dexamethasone alters cytotoxicity and interleukin- 1 elaboration by <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages,</b> we studied <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> from rats treated with oral doses of dexamethasone for 2 weeks. We found that unstimulated <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> from dexamethasone-treated rats exhibited increased cytotoxicity compared with <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> from control rats. Moreover, <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> from both groups of rats showed enhanced cytotoxicity after in vitro interferon-gamma and lipopolysaccharide treatment, in a dose-dependent manner. Although no spontaneous interleukin- 1 elaboration was detected from <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> from either group of rats, lipopolysaccharide increased interleukin- 1 elaboration by <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> from both groups of rats equivalently. These results indicate that chronic oral administration of dexamethasone to rats increases cytotoxicity, and does not alter the capacity of <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> to elaborate interleukin- 1.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> {{are thought}} to play an {{important}} part in regulating lung immune responses. While it is clear that human <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> suppress T cell proliferation in vitro, the mechanisms by which this is achieved are not clear, nor is it known whether <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> also inhibit other aspects of T cell function. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with phytohaemagglutinin or house dust mite allergen, and cultured with variable numbers of autologous <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage from 20 normal subjects. RESULTS: <b>Alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> induced a reversible inhibition of T cell proliferation in response to both mitogen and allergen stimulation, with the latter being considerably more susceptible to inhibition. This was achieved via heterogenous mechanisms, involving both soluble factors derived from <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> and cell-cell contact. Despite inhibiting proliferation, <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> had little or no effect on T cell calcium flux, the characteristic changes in CD 3, CD 2, CD 28 and interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) receptor expression which accompany normal T cell activation, and IL- 2 and interferon gamma secretion. In contrast, <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> inhibited the tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins which may be involved in IL- 2 receptor-associated signal transduction. CONCLUSIONS: The immunoregulatory properties of <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> are relatively selective, allowing T cell activation and cytokine secretion while inhibiting T cell proliferation within the lung. ...|$|R
50|$|Gas {{exchange}} must {{be restored}} {{as quickly as}} possible to avoid collateral damage, so activated lymphocytes secrete IFN-γ to stimulate the production of matrix metalloproteinase MMP-9 by macrophages. AMs have been reported to produce MMP-9 partly via PGE2-dependent PKA signaling pathways, which are the pathways involved in the inhibition of phagocytosis. MMP-9 activates latent TGF-β, reinducing expression of αvβ6 integrins on alveolar epithelial cells, thereby returning the <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophage</b> to a resting state. Activation of TGF-β is also advantageous because its production stimulates collagen synthesis in interstitial fibroblasts, which is necessary for restoring alveolar wall architecture.|$|E
50|$|The {{other type}} II {{cells in the}} {{alveolar}} wall are granular cells, which secrete surfactant, a film of fatty substances {{that contributes to the}} lowering of alveolar surface tension. Without this coating, the alveoli would collapse and very large forces would be required to re-expand them. Another type of cell, known as an <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophage,</b> resides on the internal surfaces of the air cavities of the alveoli, the alveolar ducts, and the bronchioles. They are mobile scavengers that serve to engulf foreign particles in the lungs, such as dust, bacteria, carbon particles, and blood cells from injuries.|$|E
50|$|The {{reaction}} of the lung to mineral dusts depends on many variables, including size, shape, solubility, and reactivity of the particles. For example, particles greater than 5 to 10 μm are unlikely to reach distal airways, whereas particles smaller than 0.5 μm move {{into and out of}} alveoli, often without substantial deposition and injury. Particles that are 1 to 5 μm in diameter are the most dangerous, because they get lodged at the bifurcation of the distal airways. Coal dust is relatively inert, and large amounts must be deposited in the lungs before lung disease is clinically detectable. Silica, asbestos, and beryllium are more reactive than coal dust, resulting in fibrotic reactions at lower concentrations. Most inhaled dust is entrapped in the mucus blanket and rapidly removed from the lung by ciliary movement. However, some of the particles become impacted at alveolar duct bifurcations, where macrophages accumulate and engulf the trapped particulates. The pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophage</b> is a key cellular element in the initiation and perpetuation of lung injury and fibrosis. Many particles activate the inflammasome and induce IL-1 production. The more reactive particles trigger the macrophages to release a number of products that mediate an inflammatory response and initiate fibroblast proliferation and collagen deposition. Some of the inhaled particles may reach the lymphatics either by direct drainage or within migrating macrophages and thereby initiate an immune response to components of the particulates and/or to self-proteins that are modified by the particles. This then leads to an amplification and extension of the local reaction. Tobacco smoking worsens the effects of all inhaled mineral dusts, more so with asbestos than with any other particle.|$|E
40|$|Pneumocystis {{pneumonia}} (PcP) is {{the most}} common opportunistic disease in immunocompromised patients. <b>Alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> are responsible for the clearance of Pneumocystis organisms; however, they undergo a high rate of apoptosis during PcP due to increased intracellular polyamine levels. In this study, the sources of polyamines and mechanisms of polyamine increase and polyamine-induced apoptosis were investigated. The level of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) was elevated in <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages,</b> and the number of <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> that took up exogenous polyamines was increased 20 -fold during PcP. Monocytes, B lymphocytes, and CD 8 + T lymphocytes that were recruited into the lung during PcP expressed high levels of ornithine decarboxylase, suggesting that these cells are sources of polyamines. Both protein and mRNA levels of antizyme inhibitor (AZI) were increased in <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> during PcP. This AZI overexpression correlated with increased polyamine uptake by <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages,</b> because AZI expression knockdown decreased the polyamine uptake ability of these cells. AZI expression knockdown also decreased the apoptosis rate of <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages.</b> Pneumocystis organisms and zymosan A were found to induce AZI overexpression in <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages,</b> suggesting that β-glucan, which is the major component of the Pneumocystis cell wall, induces AZI overexpression. The levels of mRNA, protein, and activity of polyamine oxidase were increased in <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> during PcP, indicating that the H 2 O 2 generated during polyamine catabolism caused <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> to undergo apoptosis. Taken together, results {{of this study indicate that}} Pneumocystis organisms induce AZI overexpression in <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages,</b> leading to increased polyamine synthesis and uptake and apoptosis rate of these cells...|$|R

For smoke exposure, rats were divided into two groups. Five were exposed to a daily concentration of 10 mg/m 3 of cigarette smoke for an eight hour period, and five rats (controls) were not exposed to smoke.

40|$|We have {{previously}} demonstrated that fetal ethanol exposure deranges the function and {{viability of the}} neonatal <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophage.</b> Although altered differentiation of the <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophage</b> contributes to pulmonary disease states within the adult lung, the effects of fetal ethanol exposure on the normal differentiation of interstitial to <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophage</b> in the newborn lung are unknown. In the current study, using a mouse model of fetal ethanol exposure, we hypothesized that altered terminal differentiation of the neonatal interstitial to <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophage</b> contributes to the observed cellular dysfunction in the ethanol-exposed newborn mouse. Control <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophage</b> differentiation was characterized by increased expression of CD 32 /CD 11 b (P ≤ 0. 05) and increased in vitro phagocytosis of Staphylococcus aureus (P ≤ 0. 05) compared with interstitial macrophage. After in utero ethanol exposure, both alveolar and interstitial macrophage lacked the acquisition of CD 32 /CD 11 b (P ≤ 0. 05) and displayed impaired in vitro phagocytosis (P ≤ 0. 05). Ethanol significantly increased transforming growth factor-β 1 (TGF-β 1) in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (P ≤ 0. 05), {{as well as in}} both interstitial and alveolar macrophages (P ≤ 0. 05). Oxidant stress contributed to the ethanol-induced changes on the interstitial and alveolar cells, since maternal supplementation with the glutathione precursor S-adenosylmethionine during ethanol ingestion normalized CD 32 /CD 11 b (P ≤ 0. 05), phagocytosis (P ≤ 0. 05), and TGF-β 1 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and macrophages (P ≤ 0. 05). Contrary to our hypothesis, fetal ethanol exposure did not solely impair interstitial to <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophage</b> differentiation.

In this study, we analyze functions of <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> in poxvirus infection, using a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing firefly luciferase to quantify infection in mice and cell culture. Depletion of <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> with liposomal clodronate worsens the overall severity of infection in mice, including greater replication and systemic dissemination of vaccinia as determined by bioluminescence imaging.

40|$|HIV- 1 {{infection}} impairs <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophage</b> {{immune function}} and renders patients susceptible to pneumonia by poorly understood mechanisms. <b>Alveolar</b> <b>macrophage</b> maturation and function depends on granulocyte-macrophage colony–stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which is produced and secreted by the alveolar epithelium. Macrophages respond to GM-CSF through the GM-CSF receptor (GM-CSFR), {{which has a}} binding subunit (GM-CSFRα) and a signaling subunit (GM-CSFRβ). In this study, we measured GM-CSFR expression and <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophage</b> function in a transgene HIV- 1 rat model (NL 4 - 3 Δ gag/pol); this construct bears a pro-virus with gag and pol deleted, but other HIV- 1 –related proteins, such as gp 120 and Tat, are expressed, and the rats develop an AIDS-like phenotype as they age. We first determined that HIV- 1 –transgenic expression selectively decreased <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophage</b> expression of GM-CSFRβ and impaired bacterial phagocytosis in vitro. Next, we examined the role of zinc (Zn) deficiency as a potential mechanism underlying these effects, and determined that HIV- 1 –transgenic rats have significantly lower levels of Zn in the alveolar space and macrophages. To test the direct effect of Zn deficiency on macrophage dysfunction, we treated rat <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophage</b> cell line with a Zn chelator, N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis-(2 -pyridyl-methyl) ethylenediamine, and this decreased GM-CSFRβ expression and phagocytosis.

In this context, we asked: what is the transcriptome of oxidant-related genes in small airway epithelium and <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages,</b> and does their response differ substantially to inhaled cigarette smoke? Methods Using microarray analysis, with TaqMan RT-PCR confirmation, we assessed oxidant-related gene expression in small airway epithelium and <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> from the same healthy nonsmoker and smoker individuals. Results Of 155 genes surveyed, 87 (56 %) were expressed in both cell populations in nonsmokers, with higher expression in <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> (43 %) compared to airway epithelium (24 %). In smokers, there were 15 genes (10 %) up-regulated and 7 genes (5 %) down-regulated in airway epithelium, but only 3 (2 %) up-regulated and 2 (1 %) down-regulated in <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages.</b> Pathway analysis of airway epithelium showed oxidant pathways dominated, but in <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> immune pathways dominated. Conclusion Thus, the response of different cell-types with an identical genome exposed to the same stress of smoking is different; responses of <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> are more subdued than those of airway epithelium.

In patients with IPF, there was a significant correlation between the proportions of neutrophils in lavage fluid and the release of a chemotactic factor for neutrophils by <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> (p less than 0. 001). The chemotactic factor released by IPF <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> was of low molecular weight (400 - 600), at least partially lipid in nature, and preferentially attracted neutrophils compared with monocytes. Several lines of evidence suggested that immune complexes in the lung stimulated <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> of patients with IPF to release the chemotactic factor. First, immune complexes stimulated normal macrophages to release the factor. Second, there was a significant correlation between the release of the chemotactic factor by IPF <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> and the levels of immune complexes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Third, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid containing immune complexes stimulated normal macrophages to release the factor. Fourth, IPF <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> that released large amounts of the chemotactic factor had an apparent suppression of their immunoglobulin (Ig) G Fc receptor function, suggesting that immune complexes were bound to their surface. In contrast, the IgG Fc receptor function of IPF <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> that released only small amounts of the factor was similar to that of normal macrophages. These studies suggest that neutrophils are attracted to the lung in patients with IPF by a potent chemotactic factor released by <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> that have been stimulated, in vivo, via their IgG Fc receptor by immune complexes...|$|R
40|$|<b>Alveolar</b> <b>macrophage</b> {{accumulation}} and interstitial fibrin deposition {{are prominent}} in adult respiratory distress syndrome and chronic interstitial lung diseases. The role of alveolar macrophages in {{the initiation of}} fibrin deposition and lung injury in these diseases is uncertain. Expression of procoagulant activity by these cells may provide evidence of macrophage activation and involvement in the initiation of lung fibrin deposition. An experimental model of hyperoxia-induced lung injury in rats was studied for assessment {{of the relationship of}} lung injury, fibrin deposition, and <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophage</b> procoagulant activity. Lung injury was assessed histologically and functionally, and the accumulation of inflammatory cells was quantified by bronchoalveolar lavage. Pulmonary injury, manifested by increased capillary permeability, developed progressively during exposure to hyperoxia and was associated with significant augmentation of the procoagulant activity of alveolar macrophages early in the disease. This increase preceded the accumulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. <b>Alveolar</b> <b>macrophage</b> procoagulant activity had functional characteristics consistent with tissue factor. These studies provide evidence of early <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophage</b> activation in acute hyperoxic lung injury in rats and suggest a role for procoagulant activity in the development of interstitial fibrin deposition...|$|E

A genome-scale host–pathogen network {{of the human}} <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophage</b> and Mycobacterium tuberculosis is presented. This involved integrating two genome-scale network reconstructions. The reaction activity and gene essentiality predictions of the host–pathogen model represent a more accurate depiction of infection. Integration of high-throughput data into a host-pathogen model followed by systems analysis was performed in order to elucidate major metabolic differences under different types of M. tuberculosis infection...|$|E
40|$|The {{numbers of}} {{glucocorticoid}} receptors in human <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> and peripheral blood cells were measured with 3 H-prednisolone. <b>Alveolar</b> <b>macrophages,</b> which constituted 89. 0 +/- 5. 9 % of broncho-alveolar cells, obtained by broncho-alveolar lavage from normal volunteers had much {{larger numbers of}} specific glucocorticoid receptors than peripheral blood cells. The numbers of glucocorticoid receptors in peripheral polymorphonuclear leucocytes, lymphocytes and lymphocyte subpopulations (B cells, T cells, TG cells and TnonG cells) were nearly equal. In patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, in whom <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> amounted to over 85 % of the broncho-alveolar cells, the number of glucocorticoid receptors in <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> was significantly decreased, but the numbers in their peripheral blood cells were normal. This finding suggests {{that the number of}} glucocorticoid receptors in <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> may change specifically during disorders of the lung...|$|R
40|$|Viral infections play an {{important}} role in the exacerbation of asthma. The production of interferons (IFNs) is well known to limit viral spread, but IFN- � can also prime <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> to release more inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor- � (TNF-�) and macrophage inflammatory protein- 1 � (MIP- 1 �). Given the importance of these cytokines, we have investigated the effect of IFN- � on their release by <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> during stimulation by immunoglobulin (Ig) E/anti-IgE. <b>Alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> from normal or Nippostrongylus brasiliensis–infected rats, the latter having increased numbers of low-affinity receptors for IgE (Fc�RII) on their <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages,</b> were treated with IgE for 2 h and stimulated with anti-IgE for 18 h. The increase of TNF- � release (153 � 48 pg/ 10 6 cells) by IgE/anti-IgE occurred only with <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> from infected rats. The messenger RNA level for TNF- � in rat <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> was also increased by stimulation with IgE/anti-IgE. Treatment with IFN- � prior to stimulation with IgE/anti-IgE showed a time- and concentration-dependent increase of TNF- � release. Interestingly, IgE/anti-IgE treatment did not stimulate the release of MIP- 1 � (15 � 5 pg/ 10 6 cells), but IFN- � treatment alone and with IgE/anti-IgE significantly increased and potentiated MIP- 1 � release (98 � 40 pg/ 10 6 cells) by <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages,</b> respectively. These results suggest that IFN- � produced at times such as during viral infections primes <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> for enhanced release of inflammatory mediator...|$|R
40|$|In {{contrast}} to results with bacterial suspensions, phagocytosis of unopsonized bacteria readily occurs when bacteria are adhered to glass or plastic surfaces. However, in {{contrast to}} neutrophils, <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> produced much less DNA denaturation as measured by acridine orange metachromasia of phagocytized Staphylococcus aureus. We have studied the phagocytosis of unopsonized surface-adherent S. aureus and the subsequent production of reactive oxygen species by peripheral blood neutrophils, monocytes, and <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages.</b> Phagocyte-free systems were then used to show {{the relationship of the}} reactive oxygen species produced by neutrophils and <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> and the denaturation of unopsonized S. aureus DNA with acridine orange. Peripheral blood neutrophils, monocytes, and <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> from normal human volunteers were added to vials with adherent S. aureus without opsonin. Bacterial uptake and luminol- and lucigenin-dependent chemiluminescence were measured. Neutrophils developed much greater luminol-dependent chemiluminescence than monocytes or <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages.</b> Compared with neutrophils and monocytes, <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> developed significantly greater concentrations of superoxide, as measured by lucigenin-dependent chemiluminescence and ferricytochrome c reduction. These findings suggested that products of the myeloperoxidase-hydrogen peroxide-halide pathway were generated when peripheral blood neutrophils were stimulated and that <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> primarily produced superoxide. When these reactive oxygen species were generated in phagocyte-free systems containing S. aureus, products of the myeloperoxidase-hydrogen peroxide-halide pathway produced denaturation of S. aureus DNA, whereas superoxide did not. Thus, differences in reactive oxygen species produced during phagocytosis {{may be related to the}} different capacities of neutrophils and <b>alveolar</b> <b>macrophages</b> to denature unopsonized adherent S. aureus DNA...|$|R
