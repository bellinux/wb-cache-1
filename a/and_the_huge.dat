5|$|Among its {{weaknesses}} {{were the}} positioning of its gatehouse, {{on the wrong}} side of the castle, facing away from the road, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> windows in the hall, reaching down to the ground and making access relatively easy to any intruder. Indeed, this vulnerability may have been intentional - its builder Laurence was a newly moneyed member of the upper class, and he may not have wanted to erect a fortification that would have threatened the established Marcher Lords in the region.|$|E

Two projects carried out in the late 1920s, for Edgar W.

As of June 2008, China relocated 1.24million residents (ending with Gaoyang in Hubei Province) as 13 cities, 140 towns and 1350 villages either flooded or were partially flooded by {{the reservoir}} , about 1.5% of the province's 60.3million and Chongqing Municipality's 31.44million population. About 140,000residents were relocated to other provinces.|$|E

5|$|During the {{oil boom}} of the 1970s, Nigeria joined OPEC <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> oil {{revenues}} it was generating enriched the economy. Despite these revenues, the military government did little to improve {{the standard of living}} of the population, help small and medium businesses, or invest in infrastructure. As oil revenues fueled the rise of federal subsidies to states, the federal government became the centre of political struggle and the threshold of power in the country. As oil production and revenue rose, the Nigerian government became increasingly dependent on oil revenues and on international commodity markets for budgetary and economic concerns. It did not develop alternate revenue sources in the economy for economic stability. That spelled doom to federalism in Nigeria.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the battle}} {{something}} went wrong. While engaging the French galleys the Mary Rose suddenly heeled (leaned) heavily over to her starboard (right) side and water rushed in through the open gunports. The crew was powerless to correct the sudden imbalance, and could only scramble {{for the safety of}} the upper deck as the ship began to sink rapidly. As she leaned over, equipment, ammunition, supplies and storage containers shifted and came loose, adding to the general chaos. The massive port side brick oven in the galley collapsed completely <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> 360-litre (90 gallon) copper cauldron was thrown onto the orlop deck above. Heavy guns came free and slammed into the opposite side, impeding escape or crushing men beneath them.|$|E
5|$|Fatigue <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> {{cost of the}} indecisive battles {{eventually}} led Harald to seek peace with Sweyn, and in 1064 (or 1065 according to Morkinskinna) the two kings agreed on an unconditional peace agreement. By the agreement, they retained their respective kingdoms with the former boundaries, {{and there would be}} no payments of reparations. In the subsequent winter of 1065, Harald travelled through his realm and accused the farmers of withholding taxes from him. In response, he acted with brutality, and had peopled maimed and killed as a warning to those who disobeyed him. Harald maintained control of his nation through the use of his hird, a private standing army maintained by Norwegian lords. Harald's contribution to the strengthening of Norway's monarchy was the enforcement of a policy that only the king could retain a hird, thus centralising power away from local warlords.|$|E

5|$|In 1845 Chesham, {{along with}} the rest of Buckinghamshire, was {{transferred}} from the Diocese of Lincoln, of which for historical reasons it had been a part since the Norman Conquest despite its distance from Lincoln, to the Diocese of Oxford. It thus came under the control of Oxford's newly appointed dynamic young bishop Samuel Wilberforce, who in turn appointed Adolphus Aylward as vicar in 1847 to oversee the reform of the parish. A second church at Waterside was opened in 1867, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> parish of Chesham was partitioned between St.Mary's and the new Christ Church, Waterside. As Chesham and the surrounding towns grew following the arrival of the Metropolitan Railway the parish was divided further, leaving a total of four independent parishes: St.Mary's, Christ Church Waterside, St.John the Evangelist Ashley Green, and Latimer At the end of the 19th century the advowson of the much-reduced parish of St.Mary's was acquired by the recently created Peache Trust.|$|E
5|$|Passenger service {{began on}} September 11, 1972, {{initially}} just between MacArthur and Fremont. The {{rest of the}} system opened in stages, with the entire system opening in 1974 when the transbay service though the Transbay Tube began. The new BART system was hailed as {{a major step forward}} in subway technology, although questions were asked concerning the safety of the system <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> expenditures necessary for the construction of the network. Ridership remained well below projected levels throughout the 1970s, and direct service from Daly City to Richmond and Fremont was not phased in until several years after the system opened.|$|E
5|$|The {{enormous}} {{effort of}} the estimated population of 100 to 150 thousand residents of the Gniezno region {{who were involved in}} building or modernizing Gniezno and several other main Piast gords was made in response to a perceived deadly threat, not just to help them pursue regional conquests. After 935, when the Gniezno people were probably already led by Mieszko's father Siemomysł, the Czechs conquered Silesia and soon moved also against Germany. The fear of desecration of their tribal cult center by the advancing Czechs could have mobilized the community. A Polabian Slav uprising was suppressed around 940 by Germany under Otto I, and the eastbound moving Saxons must have added to the sense of danger at that time (unless the Piast state was already allied with Otto, helping restrain the Polabians). When the situation stabilized, the Piast state consolidated <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> gords turned out to be handy for facilitating the Piast's own expansion, led at this stage by Siemomysł.|$|E

5|$|The {{silver dollar}} {{had never been}} a popular coin, {{circulating}} little except in the West; it served as a means of monetizing metal and generally sat in bank vaults once struck. The Peace dollar, the last circulating dollar made of silver, was not struck after 1935, and in most years in the quarter century after that, the bullion value of a silver dollar did not exceed 70 cents. In the early 1960s, though, silver prices rose, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> stocks of silver dollars in the hands of banks and the government were obtained by the public through the redemption of silver certificates. This caused shortages of silver dollars in the western states where the pieces circulated, and interests there sought the issuance of more dollars.|$|E
