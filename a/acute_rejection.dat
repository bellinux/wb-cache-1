25|$|After a liver transplantation, {{there are}} three types of graft {{rejection}} that may occur. They include hyperacute rejection, <b>acute</b> <b>rejection</b> and chronic rejection. Hyperacute rejection is caused by preformed anti-donor antibodies. It {{is characterized by the}} binding of these antibodies to antigens on vascular endothelial cells. Complement activation is involved and the effect is usually profound. Hyperacute rejection happens within minutes to hours after the transplant procedure. Unlike hyperacute rejection, which is B cell mediated, <b>acute</b> <b>rejection</b> is mediated by T cells. It involves direct cytotoxicity and cytokine mediated pathways. <b>Acute</b> <b>rejection</b> is the most common and the primary target of immunosuppressive agents. <b>Acute</b> <b>rejection</b> is usually seen within days or weeks of the transplant. Chronic rejection is the presence of any sign and symptom of rejection after 1 year. The cause of chronic rejection is still unknown but an <b>acute</b> <b>rejection</b> is a strong predictor of chronic rejections.|$|E
25|$|<b>Acute</b> <b>rejection</b> {{occurs in}} 10–25% of people after {{transplant}} {{during the first}} 60 days. Rejection {{does not necessarily mean}} loss of the organ, but it may necessitate additional treatment and medication adjustments.|$|E
25|$|Ciclosporin has now {{replaced}} {{some of the}} azathioprine use due to {{a longer}} survival time, especially in heart-related transplantations. Moreover, despite being considerably more expensive, mycophenolate mofetil is also increasingly being used in place of azathioprine in organ transplantation, as it is associated with less bone marrow suppression, fewer opportunistic infections, and a lower incidence of <b>acute</b> <b>rejection.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Acute</b> graft <b>rejection</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common and serious postcomplications in renal transplantation. A noninvasive method is needed to {{specifically}} monitor <b>acute</b> graft <b>rejection.</b> We investigated metabolic alterations of <b>acute</b> graft <b>rejection</b> in human renal transplantation by applying a metabolomics approach. Sera from 11 <b>acute</b> graft <b>rejection</b> subjects and 16 nonacute graft rejection subjects were analyzed by a nontargeted liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomics approach including both hydrophilic interaction chromatography and reversed-phase liquid chromatography separations. Discriminative metabolites of <b>acute</b> graft <b>rejection</b> after transplantation were detected, including creatinine, kynurenine, uric acid, polyunsaturated fatty acid, phosphatidylcholines, sphingomyelins, lysophosphatidylcholines, etc. The lower level of serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate was found in the <b>acute</b> graft <b>rejection</b> group before transplantation. The results revealed comprehensive metabolic abnormalities in <b>acute</b> graft <b>rejection.</b> The findings are valuable for the clinic noninvasive diagnosis or therapy of <b>acute</b> graft <b>rejection...</b>|$|R
40|$|DCs are key {{mediators}} of {{the innate}} response to transplantation yet the substances that activate these cells during <b>acute</b> allograft <b>rejection</b> remain elusive. Prior work {{has suggested that}} HSP- 70 is associated with <b>acute</b> allograft <b>rejection.</b> Hence, {{the goal of this}} study was to determine whether HSP- 70 activates DCs and plays a critical role in <b>acute</b> allograft <b>rejection</b> in an experimental model that is dependent on innate MyD 88 signaling. Our in vitro data indicates that HSP- 70 does not activate DCs. In vivo transplant studies demonstrate that HSP- 70 levels are not increased during <b>acute</b> allograft <b>rejection</b> and an absence of the inducible form of HSP- 70 neither delays <b>acute</b> allograft <b>rejection,</b> impairs DCs maturation nor alters Th 1 immune responses during <b>acute</b> allograft <b>rejection.</b> In conclusion, our results indicate that HSP- 70 in our experimental models does not play an essential role in <b>acute</b> allograft <b>rejection.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Long-term {{success in}} {{xenotransplantation}} is currently hampered by <b>acute</b> vascular <b>rejection.</b> The inciting cause of <b>acute</b> vascular <b>rejection</b> {{is not yet}} known; however, a variety of observations suggest that the humoral immune response of the recipient against the donor {{may be involved in}} the pathogenesis of this process. Using a pig-to-baboon heterotopic cardiac transplant model, we examined the role of antibodies in the development of <b>acute</b> vascular <b>rejection.</b> After transplantation into baboons, hearts from transgenic pigs expressing human decay-accelerating factor and CD 59 underwent <b>acute</b> vascular <b>rejection</b> leading to graft failure within 5 d; the histology was characterized by endothelial injury and fibrin thrombi. Hearts from the transgenic pigs transplanted into baboons whose circulating antibodies were depleted using antiimmunoglobulin columns (Therasorb, Unterschleisshein, Germany) did not undergo <b>acute</b> vascular <b>rejection</b> in five of six cases. Biopsies from the xenotransplants in Ig-depleted baboons revealed little or no IgM or IgG, and no histologic evidence of <b>acute</b> vascular <b>rejection</b> in the five cases. Complement activity in the baboons was within the normal range during the period of xenograft survival. In one case, <b>acute</b> vascular <b>rejection</b> of a xenotransplant occurred in a baboon in which the level of antidonor antibody rose after Ig depletion was discontinued. This study provides evidence that antibodies {{play a significant role in}} the pathogenesis of <b>acute</b> vascular <b>rejection,</b> and suggests that <b>acute</b> vascular <b>rejection</b> might be prevented or treated by therapies aimed at the humoral immune response to porcine antigens...|$|R
25|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} {{used for}} autoimmune diseases include infliximab and adalimumab, which {{are effective in}} rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative Colitis by their ability to bind to and inhibit TNF-α.

Omalizumab inhibits human immunoglobulin E (IgE) and is useful in moderate-to-severe allergic asthma.|$|E
25|$|Transgenes {{may soon}} be used for {{xenotransplantation}} from pig organs. Through the study of xeno-organ rejection, {{it was found that}} an <b>acute</b> <b>rejection</b> of the transplanted organ occurs upon the organ's contact with blood from the recipient due to the recognition of foreign antibodies on endothelial cells of the transplanted organ. Scientists have identified the antigen in pigs that causes this reaction, and therefore are able to transplant the organ without immediate rejection by removal of the antigen. However, the antigen begins to be expressed later on, and rejection occurs. Therefore, further research is being conducted.|$|E

40|$|<b>Acute</b> graft <b>rejection</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common and serious post {{complications}} in renal transplantation, noninvasive diagnosis of <b>acute</b> graft <b>rejection</b> is essential for reducing risk of surgery and timely treatment. In this study, a non-targeted metabonomics approach based on ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MS) is used to investigate the effect of <b>acute</b> graft <b>rejection</b> in rat renal transplantation on metabolism. To collect more metabolite information both hydrophilic interaction chromatography and reversed-phase liquid chromatography were used. Using the partial least squares-discriminant analysis, we found that the change of metabonome in a sham-operated group and a non-graft rejection group had a similar trend, while that of the <b>acute</b> graft <b>rejection</b> group was clearly different. Several discriminating metabolites of the <b>acute</b> graft <b>rejection</b> were identified, including creatinine, phosphatidyl-cholines, lyso-phosphatidylcholines, carnitine C 16 : 0, free fatty acids and indoxyl sulfate etc. These discriminating metabolites suggested that <b>acute</b> graft <b>rejection</b> in renal transplantation can lead to the accumulation of creatinine in the body, and also the abnormal metabolism of phospholipids. These findings are useful to understand the mechanisms of the rejection, it also means that a UPLC-MS metabonomic approach is a suitable tool to investigate the metabolic abnormality in the <b>acute</b> graft <b>rejection</b> in renal transplantation...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{reported}} {{outcome of}} renal transplantation {{in patients with}} the hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) varies greatly, probably related to the diverse causes of HUS. In this single-center retrospective study, we have analyzed the recurrence rate, the incidence of <b>acute</b> <b>rejections,</b> and graft survival in patients suffering from adult-onset and childhood-onset HUS. METHODS: The medical records of 35 patients with end-stage renal disease caused by HUS, who received 50 renal allografts, were reviewed. A definite recurrence of HUS was diagnosed if both clinical and histologic signs of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) {{were present in the}} absence of any endovasculitis. If there were signs of mild endovasculitis, a probable recurrence was diagnosed. RESULTS: After first renal transplantation, 0 definite and 1 (6 %) probable recurrence occurred in 18 patients with childhood-onset HUS, as opposed to 7 (41 %) definite and 3 (18 %) probable recurrences in 17 adult-onset HUS patients (odds ratio [OR], 13. 4; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 7 - 105. 7). In the latter patients, early use of cyclosporine A increased the risk for recurrence. The incidence of <b>acute</b> <b>rejections</b> was increased compared with matched controls (OR, 1. 52; 95 % CI, 1. 05 - 2. 19 for adult-onset HUS and OR, 1. 88; 95 % CI, 1. 34 - 2. 62 for childhood-onset HUS). One-year graft survival in adult-onset HUS was poor (29 %), whereas 1 -year graft survival in childhood-onset HUS was comparable to matched controls. CONCLUSIONS: In adult-onset HUS, the recurrence rate and the incidence of <b>acute</b> <b>rejections</b> are high, resulting in a detrimental graft survival. In childhood-onset HUS, the recurrence rate is low, but the posttransplantation course is complicated by an increased incidence of <b>acute</b> <b>rejections...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Acute</b> humoral <b>rejection,</b> {{also known}} as <b>acute</b> {{vascular}} <b>rejection,</b> is a devastating condition of organ transplants and a major barrier to clinical application of organ xenotransplantation. Although initiation of acute humoral or vascular rejection is generally linked to the action of antibodies and complement on the graft, other factors such as ischemia, platelets, T cells, natural killer cells, and macrophages have also been implicated. Central to any understanding of the pathogenesis of <b>acute</b> humoral <b>rejection,</b> and to developing means of preventing it, is to know whether these factors injure the graft independently or through one or few pathways. We addressed this question by examining early events in a severe model of vascular rejection in which guinea pig hearts transplanted heterotopically into rats treated with cobra venom factor (CVF) develop disease over 72 hours. The early steps in <b>acute</b> vascular <b>rejection</b> were associated with expression {{of a set of}} inflammatory genes, which appeared to be controlled by availability of interleukin (IL) - 1. Interruption of IL- 1 signaling by IL- 1 receptor antagonist (IL- 1 ra) averted expression of these genes and early tissue changes, including coagulation and influx of inflammatory cells.

50|$|Developing with {{formation}} of cellular immunity, <b>acute</b> <b>rejection</b> occurs {{to some degree}} in all transplants, except between identical twins, unless immunosuppression is achieved (usually through drugs). <b>Acute</b> <b>rejection</b> begins as early as one week after transplant, the risk being highest {{in the first three}} months, though it can occur months to years later.

A single episode of <b>acute</b> <b>rejection</b> can be recognized and promptly treated, usually preventing organ failure, but recurrent episodes lead to chronic rejection.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Long-term {{maintenance}} immunosuppression with cyclosporine (CsA) {{is associated}} with chronic transplant nephropathy and adverse effects on blood pressure and lipid profile. Several nonrandomized studies suggest that CsA might safely be withdrawn from immunosuppressive regimens containing mycophenolate mofetil (MMF; CellCept). METHODS: A randomized, controlled study with 187 patients enrolled from 21 centers was conducted to compare CsA withdrawal with ongoing CsA therapy in stable renal transplant recipients receiving a triple-drug immunosuppressive regimen of MMF (2 g/day), CsA (Neoral), and corticosteroids. The primary endpoint was creatinine clearance at 6 months after complete withdrawal. RESULTS: In the intent-to-treat population, CsA withdrawal was associated with lower total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (- 0. 3 mmol/L, P= 0. 02; - 0. 4 mmol/L, P= 0. 015). There was a trend toward improved creatinine clearance (4. 5 mL/min, P= 0. 16) and serum creatinine (- 1 vs. + 4 micromol/L, P= 0. 34). In the per-protocol population, which excluded patients with <b>acute</b> <b>rejections,</b> the improvements in creatinine clearance and serum creatinine were statistically significant (7. 5 mL/min, P= 0. 02; - 11 vs. + 4 micromol/L, P= 0. 0003).

However, the {{introduction of}} CNIs has also come {{at the price of}} increased patient morbidity, particularly with regard to the well-known nephrotoxic effects of the medications. In an effort to minimize the adverse effects, immunosuppression regimen have evolved to include the use of various induction agents and purine synthesis inhibitors to limit the dose of CNI necessary to achieve low <b>acute</b> cellular <b>rejection</b> rates. Careful assessments of risks and benefits are needed as these newer agents have their own side effect profiles.
