One notable {{example of this}} phenomenon is Avatar, which was also released in 3D and IMAX: almost two-thirds of tickets for that film were for 3D showings with an <b>average</b> <b>price</b> of $10, and about one-sixth were for IMAX showings with an <b>average</b> <b>price</b> over $14.50, compared to a 2010 <b>average</b> <b>price</b> of $7.61 for 2D films. Social and economic factors such as population change {{and the growth of}} international markets also impact on the number of people purchasing theater tickets, along with audience demographics where some films sell a much higher proportion of discounted children's tickets, or perform better in big cities where tickets cost more.|$|E

40|$|Hoarding of money-supply {{increases}} {{can explain}} long and variable lags from money-supply changes {{to changes in}} aggregate expenditure and <b>average</b> <b>prices.</b> The Archibald-Lipsey model relies upon differences in income elasticities of demand for real money balances to explain aggregate hoarding of money-supply changes. Consequently, there is no presumption that <b>average</b> <b>prices</b> and aggregate expenditure will lag behind money-supply increases. This paper presents a general equilibrium model where money supply increases are partially hoarded in the short run. Lagged adjustment results from intertemporal substitution, rather than income effects, and the adjustment of aggregate expenditure and <b>average</b> <b>prices</b> is monotonic.

40|$|We {{examine the}} varying {{influence}} {{of the presence of}} homosexual couples on <b>average</b> home <b>prices</b> with different compositions of educational attainment and race.

The magnitude of positive influence and negative influence is lower when the number of black residents increases. This suggests that education is associated with a greater revealed tolerance for homosexuals, but the influence of education is less for areas with a higher percent black, perhaps due to homophily. ...|$|R

5|$|Between 1999 and 2002 Brown sold 60% of the UK's gold {{reserves}} shortly before gold entered a protracted bull market, since nicknamed by dealers as Brown Bottom.

The UK eventually sold about 395 tons of gold over 17 auctions from July 1999 to March 2002, at an <b>average</b> <b>price</b> of about US$275 per ounce, raising approximately US$3.5billion.
