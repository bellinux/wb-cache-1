However, the literature is vague as to whether the Internet has an impact on the export market growth of firms form developing countries. This paper examines of a cross-national sample of 204 firms from a Latin American country (Chile). The results show that Internet marketing activities positively influence information availability and business relationships, which lead to an increase in export market growth. The findings indicate that the Internet influences not only information <b>availability</b> <b>for</b> <b>export</b> performance but also business relationships generally thought to be face to face interactions in nature...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{looks at}} {{resource}} nationalism and political instability as potential causes of disruption to global oil supplies. It points to depletion preferences and strategies as {{one form of}} resource nationalism. In most cases, resource nationalism appears to be motivated by rent maximisation. Hence, we see the adoption of more restrictive policies when prices rise. Conversely, when oil prices are low, increasing export volumes becomes more important. Restrictions on exports are common, especially for natural gas, which is sometimes reserved for national consumption. Export taxes are a tool used by some countries to extract revenue from oil producers. Domestic prices of gas and petroleum products are frequently much lower than international prices, also in some sense reducing <b>availability</b> <b>for</b> <b>export.</b> Political instability has a much more elusive impact on oil and gas exports, and historical experience points to contradictory potential outcomes. This paper concludes that political instability and resource nationalism are rarely associated with acute supply crises or shortfalls. Their effect is rather gradual and normally compensated by action {{in other parts of}} the system...|$|E
40|$|The {{commercial}} energy {{relationship between the}} EU and Central Asia will be structured around gas above other hydrocarbons and minerals. More specifically, it would entail the provision of medium- to long-term volumes of around 15 bcm annually to supplement the core supply base from Azerbaijan’s Shah Deniz II project. The crucial Central Asian state in this equation is Turkmenistan, which alone has the requisite volume <b>availability</b> <b>for</b> <b>export.</b> As such, the initial finding {{of this paper is}} that Turkmenistan should be the EU’s strategic priority for engagement on energy issues. The secondary findings of this working paper are that there is both a role for the EU in Turkmenistan and a willingness {{on the part of the}} Turkmen, if only on a tactical level, to engage. The EU, with European energy companies, can up their game by: i) actively seeking to resolve the long-standing maritime boundary dispute between Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan; ii) seeking to secure a supply commitment on gas volumes from specified sources flowing through the proposed East-West pipeline; and iii) working to promote EU companies as the best technical and most environmentally responsible commercial partners to develop new onshore fields under a legal formula that protects all parties’ interests. For their part, EU energy companies must stay engaged and consider whether they would be prepared to work under commercial arrangements short of a Production-Sharing Agreement (PSA) and closer to the Joint Activity Agreement (JAA) model...|$|E
40|$|While {{the former}} Soviet Union is usually {{thought of as}} a gas {{producing}} region, it is also the second-largest regional market behind north America – and that even modest changes in consumption could have big implications for future production in the region, the investment required for it and the <b>availability</b> of gas <b>for</b> <b>export</b> markets. The paper considers the substantial demand reduction that could be achieved with efficiency measures, and the reasons why progress towards these has been painfully slow and the potential largely unrealised. The paper concludes that some efficiency gains have already been made, and more could be achieved quite soon, {{largely as a result of}} the long-term trend towards higher gas prices, whereas larger-scale gains, dependent e. g. on power and heat sector reforms, will take much longer. The analysis is underpinned by a detailed study of the statistical information available, with particular reference to consumption by various economic sectors...|$|R

40|$|The master thesis {{shows how}} {{important}} is the promotion of <b>export</b> <b>for</b> {{the economy of the}} Czech Republic in the present time of economic uncertainty and in front of such threats it now stands. I show in individual chapters of this study, {{that it is necessary to}} allow <b>for</b> <b>availability</b> of <b>export</b> credits <b>for</b> Czech exporters, because these may also help to achieve the objectives of the new Czech export strategy. Then I present methods of state aid, two Czech export agencies. And by using gravity model and subsequent analysis I show, that it is socially advantageous to support these agencie, since the positive impact of this support can also be expected as an increase in employment, GDP growth and increased income to the state budget through taxes. Furthermore, I introduce the leader to the threat posed to export financing in Europe by the regulatory requirements of the newly introduced Basel III banking regulation - not just capital requirements, but also the newly introduced leverage ratio. Econometric model empirically confirms the hypothesis, that Basel III will have a negative impact on the availability and price of export credits. On the contrary, according to the conclusions of this model I cannot assume that this regulation significantly influences the Czech export credit institutions...|$|R
40|$|The {{beneficial}} effects of using Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP) of persimmon fruits {{to extend its}} <b>availability</b> <b>for</b> <b>export</b> purpose to perform the consumers and markets demands were investigated during two successive seasons of 2007 and 2008. Hachia and Triumph persimmon fruits were harvested at three quarter color stage and enclosed in different packaging materials of Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE) bags at the thickness of 2, 4 and 7 :m LDPE. 100 % Nitrogen gas was flushed into the bags for complete replacing of normal air while control fruits were packed with aerobic atmosphere for each thickness. Fruit quality characteristics i. e. fruit firmness, respiration rate, fruit color, Softening as days to eat soft, soluble solid content, total acidity, ascorbic acid content, total phenols and total tannins were assessed periodically after storage periods at 0 ºC and after 7 days at 20 ºC and 80 - 85 % RH. Packaging fruits at 7 μm Low Density Polyethylene film (LDPE) with N 2 (100 %) can {{be more effective in}} keeping fruits firm with the least respiration rate during storage and after ripening at 20 ºC than 4 and 2 μm LDPE films and control fruits for the two cultivars respectively. Lightness (L*) and Chroma (C*) color parameters had the significant highest values in fruits received (N 2) application and packaged with 7 μm LDPE after 90 d storage at 0 ºC and 7 d ripe. SSC had slight insignificant decrease throughout the storage period at 20 ºC due to different polyethylene packaging films and 100 % N 2 exposure, also untreated fruits showed the same direction. LDPE film at 7 μm thickness recorded the highest content of ascorbic acid but with the least level of acidity and phenols content followed by 4 and 2 μm films throughout storage and ripening periods. Total tannins as indicator of removing fruit astringency were as storage period extend and the thickness of LDPE films increase in packed persimmon fruits in the two cultivars respectively. Moreover, Triumph persimmon fruit had higher content of tannins compared with Hachia variety. These results were suggested that the highest thickness of LDPE film (7 μm) and N 2 (100 %) are suitable application for modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) of Hachia and Triumph persimmon fruits as response for long storage under refrigeration with an additional period of time at ambient temperature...|$|E
