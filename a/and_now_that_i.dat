2500|$|In {{looking back}} on his early films, Pauline Kael writes that Mankiewicz had, in fact, written (alone or with others) [...] "about forty of the films I {{remember}} best from the twenties and thirties. I hadn't realized how extensive his career was. ... <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have looked into Herman Mankiewicz's career it's apparent {{that he was a}} key linking figure in just the kind of movies my friends and I loved best. These were the hardest-headed periods of American movies ... the most highly acclaimed directors of that period, suggests that the writers...in little more than a decade, gave American talkies their character." ...|$|E
2500|$|On October 17, 2014, Rebecca Wisocky was {{revealed}} {{to have been}} cast as the con-artist Madam Faustina for the ninth episode, [...] "Fall", while {{a few days later}} on October 22, David Paul Grove, Gabe Khouth, Michael Coleman, Mig Macario and Jeffrey Kaiser were confirmed to be returning as the remaining seven dwarves. On October 25, 2014, Ginnifer Goodwin revealed that Mary Margaret's and David's son, Neal Nolan, is portrayed by eight different babies, adding: [...] "I used to be like, 'babies look like babies.' <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have a baby, I'm like, how does the audience not notice that in every shot, this is a different kid?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{most intense}} {{work on the}} book was done {{during the winter of}} 1850–1851, when Melville had changed the noise of New York City for a farm in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. The move may well have delayed {{finishing}} the book. During these months, he wrote several excited letters to Hawthorne, including one of June 1851 in which he summarizes his career: [...] "What I feel most moved to write, that is banned, — it will not pay. Yet, altogether, write the other way I cannot. So the product is a final hash, and all my books are botches." [...] This is the stubborn Melville who stood by Mardi and talked about his other, more commercial books with contempt. The letter also reveals how Melville experienced his development from his 25th year: [...] "Three weeks have scarcely passed, at any time between then <b>and</b> <b>now,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have not unfolded within myself. But I feel that I am now come to the inmost leaf of the bulb, and that shortly the flower must fall to the mould." [...] One other theory holds that getting to know Hawthorne first inspired him to write Ahab's tragic obsession into the book, but Bryant and Springer object that Melville already had experienced other encounters which could just as well have triggered his imagination, such as the Bible's Jonah and Job, Milton's Satan, Shakespeare's King Lear, Byron's heroes.|$|E

2500|$|Cole has cited several hip-hop {{artists as}} {{influencing}} his rapping style, including Tupac Shakur, Nas, Jay Z, and Eminem. He described {{in an interview}} with Steve Lobel, [...] "Jay was a mentor before I ever signed to him." [...] "I studied his moves that much...I got to go on tour with him and steal a lot of gems. That's how you supposed to do it. You're supposed to learn and take pieces from the greatest. So, Jay was my mentor before I ever signed to him. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> signed to him it's just a blessing to be able to hit him for advice and get that real 20 years of experience or however long he been in the game. It's priceless.""My favorite rapper was Pac," [...] he said. [...] "He was my favorite rapper before I even started rapping. Before I even thought of-It went from Michael Jackson, Bobby Brown as a kid and artists like that. Even Kool Moe Dee. Just the cool dude that I looked up to. And then one day my stepfather came home from-I don't know if he was back from Desert Storm...I remember him coming home with that first Pac album. With [...] "Brenda's Got A Baby". It was 2Pacalypse Now. And since then-When I was too young to know what he was talking about, but it connected. Cause that's the thing about art. It's just truth. It's straight-Whatever you feel. So, even as a seven-year-old kid, eight-year-old kid I could hear Pac's early albums and feel the truth." [...] Cole drew comparisons to Nas following the release of Friday Night Lights, stating that Nas served as the primary inspiration behind the creation of the mixtape. Cole later addressed their musical similarities on [...] "Let Nas Down", a song written and composed due to his disparaging comments towards [...] "Work Out".|$|E
2500|$|Our Rabbis {{taught that}} the {{obligation}} to confess sins comes {{on the eve of}} the Day of Atonement, as it grows dark. But the Sages said that one should confess before one has eaten and drunk, lest one become inebriated in the course of the meal. And even if one has confessed before eating and drinking, one should confess again after having eaten and drunk, because perhaps some wrong happened during the meal. And even if one has confessed during the evening prayer, one should confess again during the morning prayer. And even if one has confessed during the morning prayer, one should do so again during the Musaf additional prayer. And even if one has confessed during the Musaf, one should do so again during the afternoon prayer. And even if one has done so in the afternoon prayer, one should confess again in the Ne'ilah concluding prayer. The Gemara taught that the individual should say the confession after the (silent recitation of the) Amidah prayer, and the public reader says it in the middle of the Amidah. Rav taught that the confession begins: [...] "You know the secrets of eternity [...] [...] [...] [...]" [...] Samuel, however, taught that the confession begins: [...] "From the depths of the heart [...] [...] [...] [...]" [...] Levi said: [...] "And in Your Torah it is said, [...] " [...] (...) Rabbi Johanan taught that the confession begins: [...] "Lord of the Universe, [...] [...] [...] [...]" [...] Rav Judah said: [...] "Our iniquities are too many to count, and our sins too numerous to be counted." [...] Rav Hamnuna said: [...] "My God, before I was formed, I was of no worth, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have been formed, it is as if I had not been formed. I am dust in my life, how much more in my death. Behold, I am before You like a vessel full of shame and reproach. May it be Your will that I sin no more, and what I have sinned wipe away in Your mercy, but not through suffering." [...] That was the confession of sins used by Rav all the year round, and by Rav Hamnuna the younger, on the Day of Atonement. Mar Zutra taught that one should say such prayers only if one has not already said, [...] "Truly, we have sinned," [...] but if one has said, [...] "Truly, we have sinned," [...] no more is necessary. For Bar Hamdudi taught that once he stood before Samuel, who was sitting, and when the public reader said, [...] "Truly, we have sinned," [...] Samuel rose, and so Bar Hamdudi inferred that this was the main confession.|$|E
