5|$|Cadmium electroplating, {{consuming}} 6% of {{the global}} production, {{is used in the}} <b>aircraft</b> <b>industry</b> to reduce corrosion of steel components. This coating is passivated by chromate salts. A limitation of cadmium plating is hydrogen embrittlement of high-strength steels from the electroplating process. Therefore, steel parts heat-treated to tensile strength above 1300 MPa (200 ksi) should be coated by an alternative method (such as special low-embrittlement cadmium electroplating processes or physical vapor deposition).|$|E
5|$|The 20th century saw further {{expansion}} of the city, {{the growth of the}} University of Bristol and the arrival of the <b>aircraft</b> <b>industry.</b> During World War II, the city centre was extensively bombed in the Bristol Blitz. The redevelopment of shopping centres, office buildings, and the harbourside continues to this day.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the <b>aircraft</b> <b>industry</b> {{as a whole}} was {{becoming}} increasingly interested in VTOL aircraft. It was expected that any future European war would start with a nuclear exchange that would destroy most airbases, so aircraft would need to operate from limited airbases, roads or even unprepared fields. Considerable research effort was put into various solutions to securing a second-strike capability. Some of these solutions included rocket-launched aircraft like the zero-length launch concept, while many companies started work on VTOL aircraft as a more appropriate long-term solution.|$|E

5|$|But {{daunting}} {{technical problems}} remained. Raeder wanted newer planes, {{specifically designed for}} carrier use. Reichsmarshall Hermann Göring, head of the Luftwaffe, replied that the already overburdened German <b>aircraft</b> <b>industry</b> could not possibly complete the design, testing and mass production of such aircraft before 1946. Instead, he proposed converting existing aircraft (again the Junkers Ju 87 and Messerschmitt Bf 109) as a temporary solution until newer types could be developed. Training of carrier pilots at Travemünde would also resume.|$|E
5|$|Jones did not {{actively}} seek {{the position of}} Chief of the Air Staff before being appointed in 1942, and his conflict with Bostock—with whom he had been friends for 20years—was partly {{the result of a}} divided command structure, which neither man had any direct role in shaping. After World WarII, Jones had overall responsibility for transforming what was then the world's fourth largest air force into a peacetime service that was also able to meet overseas commitments in Malaya and Korea. Following his retirement from the RAAF, he continued to serve in the <b>aircraft</b> <b>industry</b> and later ran unsuccessfully for political office. He was knighted in 1953.|$|E
5|$|The BT46 was an {{aluminium}} alloy monocoque featuring the trapezoidal cross section common {{to many of}} Gordon Murray’s 1970s designs. It featured inbuilt pneumatic jacks fed from an external supply of compressed air to lift it off the ground for tyre changes during practice. It employed a very early version of the carbon brakes that were in universal use by the mid-1980s—a concept taken from the <b>aircraft</b> <b>industry.</b> The system, which Brabham had been developing since 1976, combined carbon composite brake pads with a steel disc faced with carbon composite 'pucks'.|$|E

5|$|Wackett was {{appointed}} an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1941 New Year Honours. In June, {{he became the}} RAAF's representative on the federal Aircraft Advisory Committee, set up to assist the Director-General of Aircraft Production. As well as members from governmental and scientific bodies, the committee included delegates from aircraft manufacturers such as de Havilland Australia and CAC, with Lawrence Wackett acting as Chief Technical Advisor. Later that year, the two brothers joined various academics on the newly formed Australian Council for Aeronautics, established by Prime Minister John Curtin to advise government, educational and scientific organisations on technical developments in the <b>aircraft</b> <b>industry.</b>|$|E
5|$|Williams {{encouraged}} the local <b>aircraft</b> <b>industry</b> {{as a means}} to further the self-sufficiency of the Air Force and Australian aviation in general. He played a personal part {{in the creation of the}} Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation in November 1936, headed up by former Squadron Leader Lawrence Wackett, late of the RAAF's Experimental Section. Williams made the first overseas flight in an aeroplane designed and built in Australia when he accompanied Squadron Leader Allan Walters and two aircrew aboard a Tugan Gannet to Singapore in February 1938.|$|E
5|$|After the {{discovery}} of the short pulsed electric arc in 1800 by Humphry Davy and of the continuous electric arc in 1802 by Vasily Petrov, arc welding developed slowly. C. L. Coffin had the idea of welding in an inert gas atmosphere in 1890, but even in the early 20th century, welding non-ferrous materials such as aluminum and magnesium remained difficult because these metals react rapidly with the air and result in porous, dross-filled welds. Processes using flux-covered electrodes did not satisfactorily protect the weld area from contamination. To solve the problem, bottled inert gases were used {{in the beginning of the}} 1930s. A few years later, a direct current, gas-shielded welding process emerged in the <b>aircraft</b> <b>industry</b> for welding magnesium.|$|E

5|$|Boeing built a final {{assembly}} line in Washington at its Renton factory, home of 707, 727, and 737 production, to produce the 757. Early in the development program, Boeing, British Airways, and Rolls-Royce unsuccessfully lobbied the British <b>aircraft</b> <b>industry</b> to manufacture 757 wings. Ultimately, {{about half of the}} aircraft's components, including the wings, nose section, and empennage, were produced in-house at Boeing facilities, and the remainder subcontracted to primarily U.S.-based companies. Fairchild Aircraft made the leading edge slats, Grumman supplied the flaps, and Rockwell International produced the main fuselage. Production ramp-up for the new narrow-body airliner coincided with the winding-down of the 727 program, and {{final assembly}} of the first aircraft began in January 1981.|$|E
5|$|Gernot Klepper, in an {{analysis}} similar to Krugman and Baldwin, has also used the Brander Spencer and other models to analyze the effects of entry into the transport <b>aircraft</b> <b>industry.</b> He included the effects of learning during the production process which depends {{on the scale of}} production. His calibrated model suggested that per unit production costs can fall by as much as 20% if total production is doubled. In that case, the entry of another firm (in this case, Airbus) into the market would decrease per firm output and reduce the learning and scale effects. In his analysis, the entry of Airbus would cause an increase in consumer surplus, but this would be smaller than the resulting loss in producer surplus.|$|E
5|$|On March 23, 1943, {{he headed}} up a {{committee}} of USAAF and RAF commanders {{to draw up a}} plan for the Combined Bomber Offensive (CBO). Despite the fact that it altered the target system priorities outlined in AWPD-42, and changed the overall goal of the offensive from knocking Germany out of the war using airpower to one of preparing for the invasion of Europe, Hansell approved the designation of the German <b>aircraft</b> <b>industry</b> as its most important target and the destruction of the German Luftwaffe as its top priority. Hansell wrote the final draft of the CBO plan himself. Although Hansell did not personally participate in later strategic bombing operations against Germany, he had been instrumental in setting in motion the plans and policies that led to the near total destruction of German war industry.|$|E

The Australian delegate to the World Veterans Federation from 1956 to 1963, he was President of the New South Wales Division of the Australian Flying Corps and Royal Australian Air Force Association throughout the 1950s, becoming an honorary life member in 1958. In October 1956, he joined former Chiefs of the Air Staff Air Marshals Sir Richard Williams and Sir George Jones in calling for greater investment in the local <b>aircraft</b> <b>industry,</b> warning that unless prompt action was taken the situation would deteriorate to {{the same level as}} before World War II.|$|E
5|$|The Ikarus IK-2 was a 1930s high-wing, single-seat, {{monoplane}} fighter aircraft of Yugoslav design {{built for}} the Royal Yugoslav Air Force. The IK-2 was designed by French-trained engineers Kosta Sivčev and Ljubomir Ilić, who saw the desirability of a developing a home-grown <b>aircraft</b> <b>industry.</b> A gull-wing design, it was armed with a hub-firing autocannon and fuselage-mounted synchronised machine guns. Just 12 production models were built, as the aircraft was obsolescent {{at the time it}} was brought into service in 1935, and only eight were serviceable at the time of the German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941. After the defeat of Yugoslavia, the remaining four aircraft were taken onto the strength of the air force of the Axis puppet state, the Independent State of Croatia, but none survived the war.|$|E
5|$|The NKAP (Narodnyy komissariat aviatsionnoy promyshlennosti—People's Ministry of the <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Industry)</b> {{requested}} on 7 October 1940 {{that the}} OKO (opytno-konstrooktorskiy otdel—Experimental Design Department) of Factory (Zavod) No. 1, which {{would later become}} the Mikoyan-Gurevich design bureau (OKB) begin work on a twin-engined long-range, single-seat escort fighter intended to use the AM-37 engine, then under development by Mikulin. It also requested that specifications, along with a model, be ready to be discussed on 12 November of that year. Three days later Mikoyan and Gurevich were ordered to produce three prototypes to undergo State acceptance trials on 1 August, 1 September and 1 November 1941. After the meeting, the NKAP broadened its roles to include bombing, torpedo attack, reconnaissance and interdiction.|$|E
