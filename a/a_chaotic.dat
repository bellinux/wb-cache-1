She saw action during World War I at the Battle of Heligoland Bight in August 1914, where she badly damaged the British cruiser , and at the Battle of Jutland on 31 May 1916. There, in <b>a</b> <b>chaotic</b> night engagement, Frauenlob {{was hit by a}} torpedo launched by , which caused the ship to capsize and sink with the vast majority of her crew.

In <b>a</b> <b>chaotic</b> trial in which Guiteau often {{interrupted}} and argued, and in which his counsel used the insanity defense, the jury found him guilty on January 5, 1882, and he was sentenced to death by hanging. Guiteau might have had neurosyphilis, a disease that causes physiological mental impairment. He was executed on June 30, 1882.|$|E
5|$|Quneitra was the Syrian {{headquarters}} for the Golan Heights. The Israeli capture of the city occurred in chaotic circumstances on 10 June 1967, {{the last day of}} the Six-Day War. Israeli forces advancing towards Quneitra from the north-west prompted Syrian troops to deploy north of the city, under heavy bombardment, to defend the road to Damascus. At , Syrian radio broadcast an announcement that the city had fallen, though it actually had not. Alarmed, the Syrian Army's redeployment turned into <b>a</b> <b>chaotic</b> retreat along the Damascus road.|$|E

5|$|The {{strategy}} {{appears to}} work equally well in insects and in vertebrates. Simulations show that motion camouflage {{results in a}} more efficient pursuit path than classical pursuit (i.e. the motion camouflage path is shorter), whether the target flies {{in a straight line}} or chooses <b>a</b> <b>chaotic</b> path. Further, where classical pursuit requires the attacker to fly faster than the target, the motion camouflaged attacker can sometimes capture the target despite flying more slowly than it.|$|E
5|$|After quickly {{growing into}} a city, Omaha failed to pave its streets accordingly. <b>A</b> <b>chaotic</b> {{transportation}} system was highlighted by several miles of successful horsecar tracks; however, the city only ever had four miles (6km) of cable car service. Several early suburbs were built on reliance of service from these lines, including Dundee, Benson and Kountze Place. In the early 1880s an extensive boulevard system {{was built to}} create a park-like atmosphere for drivers throughout the city. The Trans-Mississippi Exposition in 1889 led {{to the construction of}} many new transportation features, particularly the magnificent Burlington Station.|$|E
5|$|Brown's main {{contribution}} to the game, however, was not {{to the development of}} new plays but to the organization and administration of teams. Before Brown, football was seen as <b>a</b> <b>chaotic</b> affair where winning was a product mostly of physical prowess. Few coaches took strategy and preparation seriously. Brown, by contrast, hired a full-time staff of assistants, tested his players on their intelligence and their knowledge of plays, instituted strict organization of practices and analyzed game film to get an edge on opponents. Brown created a detailed system for scouting college talent as a means to improve the Browns' college draft.|$|E

5|$|By 5 May 1536, {{the town}} council of Buena Esperanza had now lost all faith in Cerezeda and {{voted for the}} {{abandonment}} of Higueras {{and a return to}} Trujillo; Cerezeda opposed this decision, but the council forced him to sign off on the move. In the meantime, any party foraging outside of Buena Esperanza was ordered to consist of at least 20 members for defence from the hostile natives. <b>A</b> <b>chaotic</b> evacuation back to Trujillo began, and resentment against Cerezeda was such that he feared for his life and fled to Naco to seek refuge amongst friendly natives there. On 9 May, amidst this disordered Spanish retreat, García de Celís returned from Guatemala with news that help would soon be forthcoming.|$|E
5|$|Donna Jackson is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the BBC medical drama Holby City, played by actress Jaye Jacobs. She {{appeared in the}} programme from its sixth series in 2004, to its thirteenth in 2011, and from its nineteenth in 2017. Donna entered the series as a staff nurse, characterised as a wild-child with <b>a</b> <b>chaotic</b> personal life. During her tenure, she grew to take her work more seriously, becoming a ward sister and accepting more personal responsibilities by adopting her half-niece Mia (Jada Wallace-Mitchell). A tart with a heart character, Donna had many romantic liaisons with her colleagues, including a one-night stand with midwife Mickie Hendrie (Kelly Adams). She ultimately {{fell in love with}} agency nurse Keiran Callaghan (Barry Sloane), and departed to be with him after he was injured in Afghanistan as part of the Territorial Army.|$|E
5|$|In the confusion, {{the tail}} of the Dutch line {{disintegrated}} into <b>a</b> <b>chaotic</b> melee, with eight British ships of the line fighting four Dutch and the frigate Monnikkendam. So close was the action that the British ships found themselves at risk of firing into one another in the high seas, heavy rain and poor visibility. The Dutch centre, consisting of the ships of the line Brutus, Leijden and the fifth rate razee Mars, pulled away from the engagement behind them under Rear-Admiral Johan Bloys van Treslong, coming under only distant fire from the ships of Onslow's division. Isolated, the Dutch rearguard were rapidly overwhelmed, with Jupiter, Haarlem, Alkmaar and Delft all surrendering to Onslow's attack before 13:45, while the battered Monnikkendam was seized by the frigate Beaulieu.|$|E

5|$|On November 1, 1861, Frémont ordered Grant {{to embark}} south with his troops from Cairo to attack Confederate {{soldiers}} encamped in Belmont, Missouri. Grant, along with Brigadier General John A. McClernand, landed 2,500 men at Hunter's Point, two {{miles north of}} the Confederate base outside Belmont. They took the camp, but the reinforced Confederates under Brigadier Generals Frank Cheatham and Gideon J. Pillow forced <b>a</b> <b>chaotic</b> Union retreat. At first, Grant had wanted to destroy Confederate strongholds at both Belmont, Missouri and Columbus, Kentucky, but Frémont had not given Grant enough troops to do the job. All Grant's men could do was disrupt the Confederates and fight their way back to their Union boats. They escaped back to Cairo under fire from the heavily fortified stronghold at Columbus. A tactical defeat, the battle gave Grant's volunteers confidence and experience.|$|E
5|$|Planet Nine modifies {{the orbits}} of extreme trans-Neptunian objects via a {{combination}} of secular and resonant dynamics. The secular dynamics acts on very long timescales and causes {{the distance of the}} perihelia of anti-aligned objects to rise and fall while the directions of their perihelia oscillate. The resonant dynamics acts on shorter timescales and provides phase protection, maintaining the stability of the objects by preventing close approaches. The inclination of Planet Nine's orbit weakens this protection, resulting in <b>a</b> <b>chaotic</b> variation of semi-major axes as objects hop between resonances. The orbital poles of the objects circle that of the Solar System's Laplace plane, which is bent toward the plane of Planet Nine's orbit, causing their poles to be clustered toward one side.|$|E
5|$|Ship {{camouflage}} {{is a form}} {{of military}} deception in which a ship is painted in one or more colors in order to obscure or confuse an enemy's visual observation. Several types of marine camouflage have been used or prototyped: blending or crypsis, in which a paint scheme attempts to hide a ship from view; deception, in which a ship is made to look smaller or, as with the Q-ships, to mimic merchantmen; and dazzle, <b>a</b> <b>chaotic</b> paint scheme which tries to confuse any estimate of distance, direction, or heading. Counterillumination, to hide a darkened ship against the slightly brighter night sky, was trialled by the Royal Canadian Navy in diffused lighting camouflage.|$|E

5|$|The {{atmosphere}} is <b>a</b> <b>chaotic</b> system. As a result, small changes to {{one part of}} the system can accumulate and magnify to cause large effects on the system as a whole. This atmospheric instability makes weather forecasting less predictable than tides or eclipses. Although it is difficult to accurately predict weather {{more than a few days}} in advance, weather forecasters are continually working to extend this limit through meteorological research and refining current methodologies in weather prediction. However, it is theoretically impossible to make useful day-to-day predictions more than about two weeks ahead, imposing an upper limit to potential for improved prediction skill.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} Mask of the Lunar Eclipse came to series co-creator Keisuke Kikuchi {{when he first}} saw the Wii hardware. Kikuchi and series co-creator Makoto Shibata {{returned}} as respective producer and director, while Grasshopper Manufacture's Goichi Suda acted as co-director, co-writer and designer. The gameplay concept was making the player literally feel the fear evoked in the game. The addition of further developers to the project enabled the team to reconsider the standard formula, although it proved to be <b>a</b> <b>chaotic</b> experience. As with previous games, the theme songs were sung by Tsuki Amano. When released, it became the best-selling entry in the series to that date, and received mixed to positive from Japanese and Western critics.|$|E
5|$|The {{literary}} critic G. Koster writes that, when writing Siti Akbari, Lie Kim Hok was {{limited by the}} formulaic Pandji romances and syair poems common in Malay literature at the time. Koster notes basic structural similarities between Siti Akbari and the existing poetic forms. The work followed the archetype of a hero or heroine going from a lawful kingdom into exile then into <b>a</b> <b>chaotic</b> kingdom, one which Koster suggests {{is representative of the}} cycle of oral law. Such an archetype and formulas were used in contemporary works such as Syair Siti Zubaidah Perang Cina (Poem on Siti Zubaidah and the War against China). The plot device of a woman passing herself as a man to do war was likewise common in Malay and Javanese literature. Lie deviated greatly from the established traditions, mixing European and native literary influences.|$|E
