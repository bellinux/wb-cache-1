The proximate, <b>antinutrient</b> (phytate and cyanide), minerals (Ca, Fe, Mg, Na, K, Zn and Mn), Vitamin C and total phenol content were subsequently determined. The result of the study shows that the unprocessed Cnidoscolus acontifolus leaf had 7. 8 % protein, 1. 6 % fat, 2. 4 % crude fibre, 2. 3 % ash and 83. 4 % moisture content. The total phenol (0. 7 %), phytate (479. 5 mg/ 100 g), mineral and vitamin C (535. 6 mg/ 100 g) content were generally high, while the cyanide content was low.

Microbiological contents, temperature, pH and total titratable acidity were monitored on daily basis while the proximate composition, mineral contents and the <b>antinutrient</b> contents of the unfermented and the fermented samples were determined. Results: The bacteria isolated from seeds include Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus polymyxa, Lactobacillus fermentum, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus while the fungal isolates were Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Fusarium poae, Rhizopus stolonifer and Penicillium chrysogenum. Both bacterial and fungal counts increased throughout the fermentation period while temperature increased from 27. 5 °C to 30 °C on the third day but decreased to 29. 7 °C {{at the end of the}} fermentation. The moisture, crude protein and the ash contents increased while crude fat, crude fibre and the carbohydrate contents reduced in the fermented seeds.
