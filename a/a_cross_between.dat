5|$|Equine {{species can}} crossbreed with each other. The most common hybrid is the mule, <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> a male donkey {{and a female}} horse. With rare exceptions, these hybrids are sterile and cannot reproduce. A related hybrid, a hinny, is <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> a male horse and a female donkey. Other hybrids include the zorse, <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> a zebra and a horse and a zonkey or zedonk, a hybrid of a zebra and a donkey. In areas where Grévy's zebras are {{sympatric}} with plains zebras, fertile hybrids do occur.|$|E
5|$|Familiar {{examples}} of equid hybrids are the mule, <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> a female horse and a male donkey, and the hinny, <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> a female donkey and a male horse. Pairs of complementary types like the mule and hinny are called reciprocal hybrids.|$|E
5|$|Among the Wyandots was {{the legend}} of the hooh-strah-dooh. <b>A</b> <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> what current fiction/legends portray as zombies and vampires, the hooh-strah-dooh was an evil spirit that {{inhabited}} recently dead bodies and caused the corpse to rise and devour the living. The redbud was believed to be an effective ward.|$|E

5|$|Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney is, {{like the}} rest of the Ace Attorney series, <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> the {{adventure}} game and visual novel genres. The player's goal is to defend their clients in four cases, and prove their innocence. The gameplay is separated into two types of situations: Investigations and trials.|$|E
5|$|In the 1850s, Stonehenge {{recommended}} <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> a Beagle and a Scottish Terrier as a retriever. He {{found the}} crossbreed to {{be a good}} worker, silent and obedient, but it had the drawback that it was small and could barely carry a hare.|$|E
5|$|The {{less common}} tiglon or tigon is <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> a lioness and a male tiger. In {{contrast}} to ligers, tigons are often relatively small {{in comparison to}} their parents, because of reciprocal gene effects.|$|E
50|$|The Canadian Rustic Pony is a {{breed of}} pony that {{originated}} in Canada, particularly Saskatchewan and Manitoba. The pony {{is the result}} of <b>a</b> <b>crossing</b> <b>between</b> the Heck horse and Welsh pony-Arabian horse crosses.|$|R

5|$|The {{two major}} Limousin hybrids are Brahmousin (<b>a</b> <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> Brahman and Limousin cattle)) and Lim-Flex (<b>a</b> <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> Angus and Limousin cattle), which were both {{developed}} before {{the significance of}} the F94L myostatin variant had been quantified. When Limousins homozygous for the F94L myostatin mutation are used in crossbreeding, only one of the mutations will be inherited (that is, progeny will be heterozygous for the mutation), and a high level of phenotypic uniformity and hybrid vigour would be expected in the progeny. However, breeding using heterozygous animals as parents, which could include purebred Limousins of low percentage Full French content, and Lim-Flex and Brahmousin hybrids that have not been bred to a uniform (homozygous) standard over several generations, would produce progeny with inconsistent carcase characteristics and production value depending upon whether or not the F94L mutation was inherited.|$|E
5|$|Camel {{hybridisation}} {{began in}} the first millennium BC. For about a thousand years, Bactrian camels and dromedaries have been successfully bred in regions where they are sympatric to form hybrids with either a long, slightly lopsided hump or two humps – one small and one large. These hybrids are larger and stronger than their parents – they can bear greater loads. <b>A</b> <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> a first generation female hybrid and a male Bactrian camel can also produce a hybrid. Hybrids from other combinations tend to be bad-tempered or runts.|$|E
5|$|The {{concert in}} Cologne was {{recorded}} and released as an album titled Symphonic Odysseys by Dog Ear Records, Nobuo Uematsu's recording label. It was announced {{to be in}} production on October 26, 2011, and released on December 28, 2011. The artwork for the album features <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> a sword and a violin on a white background, in the vein of the Symphonic Fantasies album, which had <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> a violin and a game controller. The cover art was produced by German design house Schech, who earlier provided the artwork for the European release of Symphonic Fantasies. Accompanying the CD is a booklet which contains photos of the concert and discusses the arrangers and compositions included in each song. The album contains everything played at the concert, with the Final Fantasy suite split into three tracks, and the album is split at the intermission into two CDs. Its fourteen tracks have a duration of 1:34:56. While Dog Ear Records published the album in Japan, the album was released in Europe through the online music retailer MAZ-Sound.|$|E

5|$|The game {{received}} generally favorable reviews at launch. Reviewers {{noted the}} precision and craft of its game design. Reviewers compared Videoball to other games including the South Asian board game Carrom, and <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> Asteroids (1979) and Rocket League (2015). GameSpot reviewer wrote that Videoball was the 2016 equivalent of Rocket League, in that both had idiosyncratic concepts and little prior anticipation, but {{simple and fun}} gameplay.|$|E
5|$|The {{less common}} tigon is <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> a lioness and a male tiger. Because the male tiger does not pass on a growth-promoting gene and the lioness passes on a growth {{inhibiting}} gene, tigons are often relatively small, only weighing up to 150kg (350lb), {{which is about}} 10–20% smaller than lions. Like ligers, they have physical and behavioural traits from both parental species, and males are sterile. Females are sometimes fertile and have occasionally given birth to litigons when mated to a lion.|$|E
5|$|Alcelaphus lelwel x cokii: Known as the Kenya Highland {{hartebeest}} or the Laikipia hartebeest. It is <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> the Lelwel and Coke's hartebeest. This hybrid {{is lighter}} in colour and larger than Coke's hartebeest. It {{is a light}} buff with reddish-tawny upper parts, and the head is longer than in Coke's hartebeest. Both sexes have horns, which are heavier as well as longer {{than those of the}} parents. It was formerly distributed throughout the western Kenyan highlands, between Lake Victoria and Mount Kenya, but is now believed to be restricted to the Lambwe Valley (south-west Kenya) and Laikipia and nearby regions of west-central Kenya.|$|E

5|$|Earlier, Riesling was {{sometimes}} {{claimed to have}} originated from wild vines of the Rhine region, without much support to back up that claim. More recently, DNA fingerprinting by Ferdinand Regner indicated that one parent of Riesling is Gouais blanc, known to the Germans as Weißer Heunisch, a variety that, while rare today, was widely grown by the French and German peasantry of the Middle Ages. The other parent is <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> a wild vine and Traminer. It is presumed that the Riesling was born somewhere in {{the valley of the}} Rhine, since both Heunisch and Traminer have a long documented history in Germany, but with parents from either side of the Adriatic the cross could have happened anywhere on the way.|$|E
5|$|Eddie Izzard as {{the voice}} of Reepicheep, a swashbuckling mouse. Over 100 actors auditioned to voice the character. Izzard {{approached}} Reepicheep as less camp and more of a bloodthirsty assassin with a sense of honour (<b>a</b> <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> Mad Max and a Stormtrooper from Star Wars): Izzard interpreted Reepicheep as someone whose family was killed by the Telmarines. The Narnia series were some of the few books Izzard read as a child, and he cherished them. When discussing Reepicheep to the animators, Adamson told them to rent as many Errol Flynn films as possible. Adamson credits Izzard for making the role his own; beforehand, the director was approaching the character similarly to Puss in Boots in Shrek 2.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century German horticulturalists devoted many {{efforts to develop}} new Riesling hybrids that would create a more flexible, less temperamental grape that could still retain some of the elegant {{characteristics}} of Riesling. The most notable is the Müller-Thurgau developed in the Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute in 1882, which is a cross of Riesling and Madeleine Royale (although long believed to be Riesling x Silvaner). Other Riesling/Silvaner crosses include the Palatinate regional favorite Scheurebe and Rieslaner. Kerner, <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> Riesling and the red wine grape Trollinger is a high quality cross that has recently eclipsed Riesling in plantings.|$|E

5|$|The Selle Français stud {{book has}} long allowed {{crossbreeding}} {{with four other}} breeds: the Thoroughbred, Arabian, Anglo-Arabian and French Trotter. Today, restrictions exist to harmonize the stud book with directives for other European warmblood breeds. For a Selle Français to be registered, it must be from two registered Selle Français parents or from <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> a Selle Français and a facteur de selle français (non-Selle Français horse that has passed stud book selection procedures). Stallions must pass through a selection process before their progeny is allowed to be registered as Selle Français. The process involves an approval committee that judges stallions on criteria based on the age, breed and nationality of the horses. The qualification criteria involve the conformation, gaits, performance and are scored against national indices.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{designed}} to have a future-retro look, with heavy use of grey tones to give a dreary, stagnant feel to totalitarian London. The largest set created for the film was the Shadow Gallery, which was made to feel like <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> a crypt and an undercroft. The Gallery is V's home {{as well as the}} place where he stores various artefacts forbidden by the government. Some of the works of art displayed in the gallery include The Arnolfini Portrait by Jan van Eyck, Bacchus and Ariadne by Titian, a Mildred Pierce poster, St. Sebastian by Andrea Mantegna, The Lady of Shalott by John William Waterhouse and statues by Giacometti.|$|E
5|$|The king cheetah is {{a variety}} of cheetah with a rare {{mutation}} for cream-coloured fur marked with large, blotchy spots and three dark, wide stripes extending from their neck to the tail. In 1926 Major A.Cooper wrote about an animal he had shot near modern-day Harare. Describing the animal, he noted its remarkable similarity to the cheetah, but the body of this individual was covered with fur as thick {{as that of a}} snow leopard and the spots merged to form stripes. He suggested that it could be <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> a leopard and a cheetah. After further similar animals were discovered, it was established they were similar to the cheetah in having non-retractable clawsa characteristic feature of the cheetah.|$|E
