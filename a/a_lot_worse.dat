25|$|The {{economic}} crisis was also <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>worse</b> than FitzGerald had feared. Fine Gael had to jettison its plans {{for tax cuts}} {{in the run-up to}} the election and a draconian mid-year budget was introduced almost immediately. The July Budget seemed exceptionally austere for a government dependent on Independent TDs support. However, the second budget introduced by John Bruton led to the Government's shock defeat in Dáil Éireann on the evening of 27 January 1982.|$|E
25|$|Glamorgan batted {{first at}} Cardiff, coming out finally at 2.30pm as rain delayed the start. Matthew Elliott was then {{dismissed}} first ball. However, Mark Wallace performed better, adding 86 from 107 balls {{to still be}} there {{at the close of}} play. Surrey probably had the best of the day, which ended with the Dragons on 238 for 9. However, it could have been <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>worse</b> for Glamorgan, as David Hemp was dropped three times. Mohammad Akram got good rewards for his bowling, taking four wickets.|$|E

25|$|In {{the next}} 2009–10 season, he again had to {{battle with a}} couple of injuries. But during the season he was still able to play another 28 games for Feyenoord, where he scored a total of 12 goals, and thereby {{qualified}} to become the top scorer of Feyenoord. With his good performance on the field, he helped Feyenoord to achieve a fourth place in the Eredivisie, and qualify the club to play the final in the Dutch cup. The final was played as a double match, and clearly lost with a total score of 6–1 to Ajax, but Tomasson left a mark of his name in the history books, by scoring the one and only goal for Feyenoord. During the World Championships 2010, he was unfortunately hit by another serious injury, that spoiled his first half of the 2010–11 season for Feyenoord. According to the medical staff at Feyenoord, the injury was <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>worse</b> than original thought. When they tried to get him ready for a game at 15 August, the injury had not entirely healed; and after a too hard training session, it therefore reappeared at its previous strength. Based upon further examination of the injury, the coach now feared that Tomasson only would be ready to play his first game of the season in January 2011.|$|E

500|$|Desolate North {{received}} mixed reviews. The album garnered positive {{reviews from}} a number of ezines, with comparisons to founders of the genre, such as Disembowelment. AllMusic reviewer Eduardo Rivadavia, however, felt that Desolate North compared negatively with the efforts of more prominent bands, concluding that [...] "Celestiial could be a hell of <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>worse,</b> but they could be much better, too." [...] Scott Seward of Decibel Magazine felt that the music compared well to similar bands, said that Anderson [...] "makes beautiful sounds out of the darkness that others would rather run from".|$|E

[...] Tirdad Derakhshani of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film {{two and a half stars}} out of five, saying [...] "If you're looking for quality prepackaged, predigested Hollywood family fun this summer, you could do <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>worse</b> than Despicable Me 2." [...] Keith Uhlich of Time Out gave the film three out of five stars, saying [...] "A fleeter film than its predecessor, Despicable Me 2 delights more often than it disappoints." [...] Alonso Duralde of The Wrap gave the film a negative review, saying [...] "The minions are still wacky scene-stealers– and once again, we don't get nearly enough of them– but Gru and his daughters have been blanded down to bad-sitcom level." [...] Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film two out of four stars, saying [...] "With its predecessor having made a whopping $540 million globally, it's no wonder that Universal saw fit to order a sequel. But it's not enough just to trot out legions of minions and cobble together a plot. Audiences deserve more imagination and inventiveness than this wan recycling." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a 'C' grade, saying [...] "By the end, every child in the audience will want his or her own monster-minion toy. Adults will just regret the way that Despicable Me 2 betrays the original film's devotion to bad-guy gaiety." ...|$|E

I would say no, absolutely not, for humanitarian, moral, social, security, military, and political reasons.

2500|$|The album {{received}} generally positive critical reception, {{with many}} critics praising the band for staying true to their usual sound, though others {{have criticized the}} album for being too similar to their previous work.

[...] Tom Spinelli at Melodic praised the album as staying true to the sound of their previous material, stating [...] "Overall this album is everything you would expect and more from the band.
