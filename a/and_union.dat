40|$|In {{a recent}} paper (Waterman 1974) I {{discussed}} {{the debate that}} has been taking place, largely amongst socialists, {{over the role of}} workers <b>and</b> <b>unions</b> in Africa.

Another was the Fanonist thesis (as well as a common liberal one) that the regularly-employed workers <b>and</b> their <b>unions</b> are a privileged and conservative 'labour aristocracy'. The third was the new Marxist one that whilst workers <b>and</b> <b>unions</b> could not be categorised wholesale as a labour aristocracy (having considerable radical potential), such a group did exist significantly amongst them...|$|R

40|$|Agricultural sales cooperatives <b>and</b> <b>unions</b> {{that began}} {{their work in}} 1935 with the {{adoption}} of Law No 2834 {{made significant contributions to}} their producer members and the national economy in general in the first years. However changing circumstances and various economic fluctuations made it necessary to support agricultural sector and the agricultural sales cooperatives <b>and</b> <b>unions</b> were used actively in certain support policies {{because of the fact that}} they were organized among the producers. In time the subsidies in question caused the cooperatives <b>and</b> <b>unions</b> to be perceived as public institutions and governments started to play a more active role on them. Later the domination of the public influence continued and increased with certain legal arrangements being made for this purpose. The cooperatives <b>and</b> <b>unions</b> left behind their original purpose of establishment and as a result became a significant contributor to public deficits. The budgetary burden, deficits of support policies, choice of target segment, unfairness in income distribution, indifference to market conditions and obligations arising from the agreements signed brought to the agenda changes in support policies implemented through agricultural sales cooperatives <b>and</b> <b>unions.</b> In this paper the size of the damage cooperatives <b>and</b> <b>unions</b> that left behind their original purpose gave to the national economy is explained and Marmara Olive Agricultural Sales Cooperatives Union (Marmarabirlik) is analyzed as an example of the benefits these institutions would bring under correct policies...|$|R
