We use accounts of historical earthquakes to <b>assign</b> <b>intensities</b> and the intensity assignments for the 2010 Haiti earthquakes to derive an intensity attenuation relation for Hispaniola. The intensity assignments and the attenuation relation are used in a grid search to find source locations and magnitudes that best fit the intensity assignments. Here we describe a sequence of devastating earthquakes on the Enriquillo fault system in the eighteenth century. An intensity magnitude MI 6. 6 earthquake in 1701 occurred near the location of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, and the accounts of the shak-ing in the 1701 earthquake {{are similar to those of}} the 2010 earthquake. A series of large earthquakes migrating from east to west started with the 18 October 1751 MI 7. 4 – 7. 5 earthquake, probably located near the eastern end of the fault in the Dominican Republic, followed by the 21 November 1751 MI 6. 6 earthquake near Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and the 3 June 1770 MI 7. 5 earthquake west of the 2010 earth-quake rupture. The 2010 Haiti earthquake may mark the beginning of a new cycle of large earthquakes on the Enriquillo fault system after 240 years of seismic quiescence.

40|$|The online {{collection}} of earthquake reports in Europe is strongly fragmented across numerous seismological agencies.

Instead of using ZIP code Community Internet Intensity Maps, we geocode individual response addresses for location improvement, <b>assign</b> <b>intensities</b> to grouped answers within 100  km 2 grid cells, and generate intensity attenuation relations from the grid cell intensities. Grid cell intensity maps are less subjective and illustrate a more homogeneous intensity distribution than communal ZIP code intensity maps. Using grid cells for ground motion analysis offers an advanced method for exchanging transfrontier equal-area intensity data without sharing any personal information. The applicability of the method is demonstrated on the felt responses of two clearly felt earthquakes: the 8 September 2011 M L 4. 3 (M w 3. 7) Goch (Germany) and the 22 May 2015 M L 4. 2 (M w 3. 7) Ramsgate (UK) earthquakes. Both events resulted in a non-circular distribution of intensities which is not explained by geometrical amplitude attenuation alone but illustrates an important low-pass filtering due to the sedimentary cover above the Anglo-Brabant Massif and in the Lower Rhine Graben. Our study illustrates the effect of increasing bedrock depth on intensity attenuation and the importance of the WNW–ESE Caledonian structural axis of the Anglo-Brabant Massif for seismic wave propagation.

Participants completed an acute bout of exercise (30 min on a treadmill at a randomly <b>assigned</b> <b>intensity</b> [light, moderate, or vigorous]) during one of the visits, with the order counterbalanced. Chronic exercise was assessed via accelerometry for up to 7 days. Regarding acute exercise, a 30 min bout of acute exercise at a light-intensity (40 - 50 % of HRmax) improved CF-related reasoning (14. 8 vs. 18. 6, p = 0. 02), as assessed from the Grammatical Reasoning test. Similarly, a 30 min bout of moderate-intensity exercise (50 - 75 % of HRmax) improved CF-related concentration (103. 1 vs. 154. 1, p = 0. 01), as assessed from the Feature Match test of concentration. With regard to chronic exercise, for every 60 min increase in accelerometer-determined moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, there was a 5. 4 point/unit increase (β = 5. 4, p = 0. 04) in CF-related reasoning, as assessed from the Odd-One-Out test.

Substantial gender differences exist in patients with coronary artety disease. The poor prognosis and lack of treatment for coronary artety disease in the female is strongly present in the clinical literature. Early recognition and treatment of a myocardial infarction can reduce reinfarction or myocardial complications and improve survivability of the event. Absence of relevant clinical research exists regarding the study of chest pain descriptions in female patients presenting with myocardial infarctions. The goals of this clinical research project proposal are: 1) Describe how men and women express their chest discomfort differently to health care workers, 2) Identify if women utilize more emotional adjectives in describing chest pain than men, 3) Describe pain location differences on a human anatomical figure between genders, and 4) Describe visual analog pain scale rating {{differences between men and}} women.

The study had three major aims: first, to determine the normative responses for a novel, emotion decoding task based on the Frog, Where Are You? picture book (Mayer, 1969); second, to examine the roles that family expressiveness and affect intensity play, in isolation and in interaction, in emotion decoding skill; and third, to examine correlates of the <b>intensity</b> ratings <b>assigned</b> to decoded emotions. A total of 180 university students (89 males and 91 females) completed the Family Expressiveness Questionnaire (Halberstadt, 1986), the Affect Intensity Measure (Larsen, 1987), and an emotion decoding task requiring them to label and rate the intensity of the emotions of picture book characters. Norms for the decoded emotions were derived from the specific and general emotion modes reported for each stimulus. Decoding ability was measured in reference to the general emotion modes. Results indicated that low negative family expressiveness was related to the ability to recognize the negative emotions of others. Affect intensity and the interaction between family expressiveness and affect intensity were not found to influence decoding scores. Both affect intensity and negative family expressiveness correlated positively with average <b>assigned</b> <b>intensity</b> rating.

Since acquiring images at increased resolution often exacts an unacceptable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) pen-alty, methods to alleviate the adverse effects of partial volume blurring are instrumental for the accurate measurement of ar-chitectural parameters in applications such as predicting the mechanical competence of trabecular bone networks. In the current work, a novel post-processing method, referred to as “subvoxel processing, ” is described for increasing apparent image resolution. The method is applicable to volumes of inter-est containing material phases of two discrete signal intensi-ties. The principal strategy consists of subdividing voxels and <b>assigning</b> voxel <b>intensities</b> to each subvoxel on the basis o...|$|R

We connect the corners of an image pixel with the origin to construct four triangles and then <b>assign</b> the <b>intensity</b> function value of the pixel to these triangles. The Fourier Mellin moment integration of the pixel is converted to a summation of four integrations within domains of these constructed triangles. By using the trigonometric resolution, we derive the analytic equations of the four integrations of these triangles. Then, the analytic expressions of the Fourier Mellin moments and Zernike moments are obtained. The algorithm eliminates the geometric and discretization errors theoretically. Finally, a set of efficient computational recursive relations is proposed. An experiment is designed to verify {{the performance of the}} proposed algorithm. I...|$|R

Rivera University of Mary, Bismarck, ND Purpose: To {{test the}} effects of upper and lower body {{multiple}} exercise per muscle group resistance training regimen compared to traditional resistance training on resting energy expenditure (REE) 30 - 45 minutes post exercise, 24, and 48 hours post exercise. Methods: This study used a two way mixed design. Subjects were males ages 18 - 22 years, not currently participating in a resistance-training program. Subjects were randomly assigned into three groups: an upper body, lower body, and control group. The upper and lower body groups completed both a multiple exercise (three different exercises to comprise three sets per muscle group) and traditional training program, in a randomly <b>assigned</b> order. <b>Intensity</b> (70...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a gesture recognition method ex-tending Temporal Templates {{so that they}} can contain not only vertical and horizontal motion but also depth information obtained from a binocular stereopsis. The proposed method can discriminate gestures with depth motion. At first, a disparity image generated from stereo images is divided into several disparity levels and in each disparity level, a grayscale feature image (Tem-poral Template) is created by <b>assigning</b> the <b>intensity</b> ac-cording to the frame number to the area where motion has been detected. Next, a gesture model is generated from learning feature images acquired in each disparity level by SVM. A gesture is recognized by checking fea-ture images generated from input stereo images against SVM model. Experimental results have shown the effec-tiveness of the proposed method for recognizing gestures with depth motion. 1...|$|R

The scheme can choose the location for watermark inserting adaptively, and properly <b>assign</b> the embedding <b>intensity</b> in different inserting locations according to the characteristic of human visual system (HVS). On the other hand, this scheme combines chaos sequence and scrambling technique to improve the ability to withstand various attacks. The experimental results show that, the method can basically satisfy transparency and robustness requirement...|$|R
