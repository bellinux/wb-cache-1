5|$|From 1980 on, {{a better}} {{understanding}} of dinosaur biomechanics, <b>and</b> <b>studies</b> by palaeontologists Andreas Christian and Holger Preuschoft on the resistance to bending of the back of Plateosaurus, led to widespread acceptance of an erect, digitigrade limb posture and a roughly horizontal position of the back. Many researchers were of the opinion that Plateosaurus could use both quadrupedal gaits (for slow speeds) and bipedal gaits (for rapid locomotion), and Wellnhofer insisted that the tail curved strongly downward, making a bipedal posture impossible. However, Moser showed that the tail was in fact straight.|$|E

5|$|Given {{the large}} number of Latter Day Saint churches and their differing backgrounds, categorizing them can be difficult.
