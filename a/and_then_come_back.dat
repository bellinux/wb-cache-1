25|$|An ogbanje is a reincarnating evil {{spirit that}} would {{deliberately}} plague {{a family with}} misfortune. In folklore, the ogbanje upon being born by the mother, under {{a certain amount of}} time (usually before puberty), would deliberately die <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> and repeat the cycle, causing the family grief. This time period varies between minutes, hours, days and years. Female circumcision was sometimes thought to get rid of the evil spirit, whereas finding the evil spirits Iyi-uwa, which they have dug somewhere secret, would ensure the ogbanje would never plague the family with misfortune again. The Iyi-uwa is a stone that the ogbanje's way of coming back to the world and also a way of finding its targeted family. The stone is deep enough to not have been planted physically by a child. The iyi-uwa is dug out by a priest and destroyed. Furthermore, female ogbanje die during pregnancies along with the baby, male ogbanje die before the birth of a wife's baby or the baby dies. The child is confirmed to no longer be an ogbanje after the destruction of the stone or after they successfully give birth to another baby.|$|E
25|$|Fever during {{treatment}} can {{be due to}} a number of causes. It can occur as a natural effect of tuberculosis (in which case it should resolve within three weeks of starting treatment). Fever can be a result of drug resistance (but in that case the organism must be resistant to two or more of the drugs). Fever may {{be due to a}} superadded infection or additional diagnosis (patients with TB are not exempt from getting influenza and other illnesses during the course of treatment). In a few patients, the fever is due to drug allergy. The clinician must also consider the possibility that the diagnosis of TB is wrong. If the patient has been on treatment for more than two weeks and if the fever had initially settled <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>come</b> <b>back,</b> it is reasonable to stop all TB medication for 72 hours. If the fever persists despite stopping all TB medication, then the fever is not due to the drugs. If the fever disappears off treatment, then the drugs need to be tested individually to determine the cause. The same scheme as is used for test dosing for drug-induced hepatitis (described below) may be used. The drug most frequently implicated as causing a drug fever is RMP: details are given in the entry on rifampicin.|$|E
500|$|Some of the {{recording}} studios used by the band were not the most advanced. One studio in Vancouver, credited as [...] "a hut", had an 8-track set up that did not even have proper headphone facilities. The group's lead singer Robert Plant later discussed the writing and recording process, stating [...] "It was crazy really. We were writing the numbers in hotel rooms and then we'd do a rhythm track in London, add the vocal in New York, overdub the harmonica in Vancouver <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> to finish mixing at New York." ...|$|E

500|$|Hunter and Morse {{are written}} off the {{series in the}} episode [...] "Parting Shot", both leaving S.H.I.E.L.D., as Palicki and Blood [...] "physically had to go leave to shoot the pilot ... they had to stop being on S.H.I.E.L.D. {{and get ready for}} the pilot and then shoot the pilot and all of that, so it didn't make sense for us to have all these episodes with them and then not have them in two or three episodes, and then go, [...] "Oh, we were just over here," [...] <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> and go away again." [...] On whether they could return to the series at some point, Bell said, [...] "I can't answer that, but I can say it would be kind of {{cheating}} to make Mack cry like that only to buy it back—not that we haven't brought characters back from the dead. We want to earn stuff." ...|$|E
500|$|Lukather's {{approach}} to engineering his {{sound in the}} studio is usually simple. He is not known for doing {{a large number of}} takes or for incorporating much overdubbing—rather, he has a reputation for doing only single takes for many parts. He has said about this approach: [...] "If a solo didn't work—either because I didn't have the right sound, or because I wasn't inspired at that moment—I'd just move on. A part either works or it doesn't. You can't batter it into submission, or force inspiration to save you. It's always better to just surrender, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> later to give it a go with fresh ears." [...] Although he enjoys the technical mastery that is possible in the studio, Lukather prefers the dynamic of performing live on stage. He has stated that dynamics are the most important element of producing a recording with good sound quality.|$|E

500|$|Fuller readily agreed, having focused {{much of his}} {{own career}} on racial issues. Already {{familiar}} with the novel and {{with the concept of}} [...] "white dogs," [...] he was tasked with [...] "reconceptualizing" [...] the film to have the conflict depicted in the book occur within the dog rather than the people. In an earlier Variety magazine interview, Fuller stated that viewers would [...] "see a dog slowly go insane <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> to sanity." [...] Before filming began, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the Black Anti-Defamation Coalition (BADC), and other civil-rights leaders began voicing concerns that the film would spur racial violence. In an editorial in the Los Angeles Times, Robert Price, executive director of the BADC, criticized the studio for producing the film based on a book by a white man and using a primarily white cast and crew, rather than producing the film with African Americans in key positions. He also considered Gary's work to be a [...] "second-rate novel" [...] and questioned its use when [...] "bookshelves are laden with quality novels by black writers who explore the same social and psychological areas with far more subtlety?" ...|$|E
500|$|Jeff Pinkner and J. H. Wyman {{decided to}} {{alternate}} the episodes between the prime and parallel universes because they [...] "thought {{that the best}} way to really thoroughly tell these stories was to dive into them wholeheartedly... the journey that our heroine is on <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> over here because [...] is embedded in our team, we have point of view characters in both universes and it seemed to us the perfect opportunity to really explore in a really thorough fulsome way the alternate universe". Wyman elaborated that he felt fans [...] "would really appreciate a mythology in two places", and showing both universes [...] "just presented itself in such a natural organic way to evolution in our storytelling". Fox however was initially worried about the premise's sustainability, and that an episode without Peter or Walter [...] "wouldn't feel like our show anymore," [...] to which Pinkner responded that [...] "not unlike a show like Lost, Fringe has to constantly evolve, to move and grow and go forward, otherwise we'll get bored, the cast will get bored, the audience will get bored". After the first three episodes, both Fox and Warner Bros. became more favorable to the storyline.|$|E
500|$|Spotted {{eagle rays}} prefer {{to swim in}} waters of [...] Their daily {{movement}} {{is influenced by the}} tides; one tracking study showed that they are more active during high tides. Uniquely among rays they dig with their snouts in the sand, surrounding themselves in a cloud of sand that spews from their gills. They also exhibit two motions in which the abdomen and the pectoral fins are moved rapidly up and down: the pelvic thrust and the extreme pelvic thrust. The pelvic thrust is usually performed by a solitary ray, and repeated four to five times rapidly. The extreme pelvic thrust is most commonly observed when the ray is swimming in a group, from which it will separate itself before vigorously thrusting with its pectoral fins. The rays also performs dips and jumps; in a dip the ray will dive <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> up rapidly, perhaps as many as five times consecutively. There are two main types of jump: in one, the ray propels itself vertically out of the water, to which it returns along the same line; the other is when the ray leaps at a 45degree angle, often repeated multiple times at high speeds. When in shallow waters or outside their normal swimming areas the rays are most commonly seen alone, but they do also congregate in schools. One form of traveling is called loose aggregation, which is when three to sixteen rays are swimming in a loose group, with occasional interactions between them. A school commonly consists of six or more rays swimming in the same direction at exactly the same speed.|$|E

2500|$|On 10 August 2013, in an {{interview}} reported by John Bleasdale, Kitano revealed his current plans for a sequel to Outrage Beyond and an untitled personal film project. As Kitano stated, [...] "Ideally what would happen would be this: Outrage Beyond becomes a huge hit, so huge that my producer allows me to make one film I {{really want to do}} <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> to the sequel after I've made the film I really want to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hunt also {{commented on}} Grand Prix racing in {{newspaper}} columns which {{were published in}} The Independent and elsewhere, and in magazines. Hunt criticised 1992 world champion Nigel Mansell for failing to defend his F1 title in 1993, stating that Mansell left to [...] "avoid racing Alain Prost in the same car" [...] and gave [...] "two fingers to the business and the team". Hunt also described IndyCar as [...] "club racing, the standards are not high there compared to Grand Prix racing", stating that Mansell could [...] "win the championship easily <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> to real racing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bikel was {{an active}} {{supporter}} and campaigner for John F. Kennedy. He did some of his campaigning during the run of The Sound of Music which got him into trouble with the producers, who {{did not think it}} was becoming for an actor. He recalls, [...] "I would go out sometimes between matinee and evening performances, go to a rally and speak from a flat-bed truck, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> to the theater." [...] The producers stopped complaining, however, when after one show he was picked up backstage by a limousine carrying Eleanor Roosevelt, and he accompanied her to a Democratic rally as her special guest.|$|E

2500|$|Early on {{the morning}} of 28 August, , USS Wabash, and USS Cumberland began to bombard Fort Clark, while the lighter {{warships}} accompanied the transports to a point about three miles (about 5km) to the east, where the troops began disembarking. Stringham kept his ships moving in a loop, with Wabash towing Cumberland. About 11:00a.m., USS Susquehanna [...] "made her number" [...] and joined in. The ships would deliver their broadsides against the fort, move back out of range to reload, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> in to fire again. By remaining in motion, they did not let the artillerymen in the fort correct their aim between shots, and thereby negated much of the traditional advantage of shore-based guns over those on ships. This tactic had been used previously by the British and French at the siege of Sevastopol in the Crimean War, {{but this was the first}} time it was used by the US Navy.|$|E
2500|$|On September 21, 2012, the duo {{released}} a statement announcing their hiatus. Redfoo said, [...] "I feel like we've {{been doing this for}} so long, four or five years" [...] and that he and SkyBlu would not be performing together anytime soon as they would be taking their careers in different directions. Once the news surfaced that band members Redfoo and SkyBlu had split, the group went to MTV News to set the record straight. SkyBlu said, [...] "Well, you know, first of all, we're not breaking up. I know that for sure. We're family and stuff, so it's always love ... It's interesting because somebody will say one thing [...] it's just like high school, {{then all of a sudden}} [...] 'They're breaking up. They're fighting.'" [...] However, it has been revealed by SkyBlu that their plan is for fans to see the band as individuals <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> stronger than ever.|$|E
