40|$|<b>Aborts</b> {{during the}} {{critical}} ascent flight phase require {{the design and}} operation of Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) systems {{to escape from the}} Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV) and return the crew safely to the Earth. To accomplish this requirement of continuous <b>abort</b> coverage, CEV ascent <b>abort</b> modes are being designed and analyzed to accommodate the velocity, altitude, atmospheric, and vehicle configuration changes that occur during ascent. <b>Aborts</b> from the launch pad to early in the flight of the CLV second stage are performed using the Launch <b>Abort</b> System (LAS).

40|$|For human spaceflight missions, {{a launch}} vehicle failure poses the {{challenge}} of returning the crew safely to earth through environments that are often much more stressful than the nominal mission. Manned spaceflight vehicles require continuous <b>abort</b> capability throughout the ascent trajectory to protect the crew {{in the event of}} a failure of the launch vehicle. To provide continuous <b>abort</b> coverage during the ascent trajectory, different types of Orion <b>abort</b> modes have been developed. If a launch vehicle failure occurs, the crew must be able to quickly and accurately determine the appropriate <b>abort</b> mode to execute. Early in the ascent, while the Launch <b>Abort</b> System (LAS) is attached, <b>abort</b> mode selection is trivial, and any failures will result in a LAS <b>abort.</b> For failures after LAS jettison, the Service Module (SM) effectors are employed to perform <b>abort</b> maneuvers. Several different SM <b>abort</b> mode options are available depending on the current vehicle location and energy state. During this region of flight the selection of the <b>abort</b> mode that maximizes the survivability of the crew becomes non-trivial. To provide the most accurate and timely information to the crew and the onboard <b>abort</b> decision logic, on-board algorithms have been developed to propagate the <b>abort</b> trajectories based on the current launch vehicle performance and to predict the current <b>abort</b> capability of the Orion vehicle. This paper will provide an overview of the algorithm architecture for determining <b>abort</b> achievability as well as the scalar integration scheme that makes the onboard computation possible. Extension of the algorithm to assessing <b>abort</b> coverage impacts from Orion design modifications and launch vehicle trajectory modifications is also presented...|$|R

5|$|The {{role that}} gender plays {{in health care}} access can be {{determined}} by examining resource allocation within the household and public sphere. Gender discrimination begins before birth; females are the most commonly <b>aborted</b> sex in India. If a female fetus is not <b>aborted,</b> the mother’s pregnancy can be a stressful experience, due to her family’s preference for a son. Once born, daughters are prone to being fed less than sons, especially when there are multiple girls already in the household. As women mature into adulthood, many of the barriers preventing them from achieving equitable levels of health stem from the low status of women and girls in Indian society, particularly in the rural and poverty-affected areas.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the primary}} design drivers for NASA's Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) is to ensure crew safety. <b>Aborts</b> during the {{critical}} ascent flight phase require the design and operation of CEV systems {{to escape from the}} Crew Launch Vehicle and return the crew safely to the Earth. To accomplish this requirement of continuous <b>abort</b> coverage, CEV ascent <b>abort</b> modes are being designed and analyzed to accommodate the velocity, altitude, atmospheric, and vehicle configuration changes that occur during ascent. The analysis involves an evaluation of the feasibility and survivability of each <b>abort</b> mode and an assessment of the <b>abort</b> mode coverage. These studies and design trades are being conducted so that more informed decisions can be made regarding the vehicle <b>abort</b> requirements, design, and operation. This paper presents an overview of the CEV, driving requirements for <b>abort</b> scenarios, and an overview of current ascent <b>abort</b> modes. Example analysis results are then discussed. Finally, future areas for <b>abort</b> analysis are addressed...|$|R
40|$|NASA {{goals are}} set on {{resumption}} {{of human activity}} on the Moon and extending manned missions to Mars. <b>Abort</b> options are key elements of any system designed to safeguard human lives and stated requirements stipulate the provision of an <b>abort</b> capability throughout the mission. The present investigation {{will focus on the}} formulation and analysis of possible <b>abort</b> modes during the Earth departure phase of manned Mars interplanetary transfers. Though of short duration, the departure phase encompasses a mission timeline where failures have frequently become manifest in historical manned spacecraft necessitating the inclusion of a departure phase <b>abort</b> capability. Investigated <b>abort</b> modes included <b>aborts</b> to atmospheric entry, and to Earth or Moon orbit. Considered interplanetary trajectory types included conjunction, opposition, and free-return trajectory classes. All <b>abort</b> modes were analyzed for <b>aborts</b> initiated at multiple points along each of these possible departure trajectories across all launch opportunities of the fifteen-year Earth-Mars inertial period. The consistently low departure velocities of the conjunction trajectories facilitated the greatest <b>abort</b> capability. An analysis of Mars transportation architectures was performed to determine the amount of available delta V inherent in each candidate architecture for executing departure <b>aborts.</b> Results indicate that a delta V of at least 4 km/s is required to achieve a continuous departure phase entry <b>abort</b> capability with <b>abort</b> flights less than three weeks duration for all transfer opportunity years. Less demanding transfer years have a corresponding increase in capability. The Earth orbit <b>abort</b> mode does not become widely achievable until more than 6 km/s delta V is provided; a capacity not manifest in any considered architecture. Optimization of the Moon <b>abort</b> mode resulted in slight departure date shifts to achieve improved lunar alignments. The Moon <b>abort</b> mode is only widely achievable for conjunction transfers during the optimum transfer years and delta V values greater than 4 km/s. A lesser delta V potential of 3 km/s is sufficient to enable entry <b>aborts</b> during the least demanding transfer opportunity years. Extensive <b>abort</b> capability is achievable for high delta V capable Mars architectures. Less propulsively capable architectures achieve moderate <b>abort</b> capability during favorable opportunity years...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} how the <b>Abort</b> Motor thrust profile has been tailored and how optimizing the Concept of Operations on the Launch <b>Abort</b> System (LAS) of the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) aides in getting the crew safely away from a failed Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV). Unlike the passive nature of the Apollo system, the Orion Launch <b>Abort</b> Vehicle will be actively controlled, giving the program a more robust <b>abort</b> system with a higher probability of crew survival for an <b>abort</b> at all points throughout the CLV trajectory.
