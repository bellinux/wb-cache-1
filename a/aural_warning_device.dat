2500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{involved in}} the accident was a Beechcraft 200 Super King Air, registration VH-SKC, serial number BB-47, manufactured in 1975. The aircraft had 18,771 hours of service before the accident. The amount of air passed into the cabin is controlled by bleed air valves on the engines. The positions of the bleed air valves can be altered by the pilot. According to the accident report, [...] "The aircraft was not ﬁtted with a high cabin altitude <b>aural</b> <b>warning</b> <b>device,</b> nor was it required to be." [...] The aircraft was fitted with an emergency oxygen systeman oxygen tank which could supply oxygen to the crew through two masks located in the cockpit and to passengers through masks which drop from {{the ceiling of the}} cabin.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Ghost Flight, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority issued a Discussion Paper and a Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM), both proposing <b>aural</b> <b>warning</b> in the Beechcraft Super King Air and other pressurised aircraft. The outcome of consultation on the NPRM was that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority did not mandate <b>aural</b> <b>warning</b> of inadequate cabin pressure and this angered the families of some of the victims. [...] Instead, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority issued a notice to owners of pressurised aircraft registered in Australia recommending installation of an <b>aural</b> <b>warning,</b> but not making it mandatory. The notice said, [...] "The benefit to your pilots and passengers lies in the reduction in risk of an uncommanded depressurisation leading to an incident or fatal accident. The benefit is much greater than the cost of purchase and installation of one of these low-cost systems." ...|$|R

25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of an incident in 1999 in which the pilot of a Beechcraft Super King Air suffered hypoxia, the ATSB published Report 199902928 and recommended an <b>aural</b> <b>warning</b> be fitted on the flight deck of all Australian Beechcraft Super King Air aircraft. The flight deck of the Beechcraft Super King Air only has visual warning of inadequate cabin pressure.|$|R
5000|$|When an {{emergency}} vehicle is responding, it often uses audio <b>warning</b> <b>devices</b> {{in addition to}} the visual warnings provided by its warning lights. Audio <b>warning</b> <b>devices</b> are turned off once the vehicle is on-scene. Such devices include: ...|$|R

Redesigned valve prevents metal shavings and other debris from developing during operation, installation, or removal. New features include secondary seal in cap. Belleville washers create precise value of seating force.

50|$|In the {{predictive}} wind shear detection mode, the weather radar processor {{of the aircraft}} detects {{the presence of the}} microburst, a type of vertical wind shear condition by detecting the Doppler frequency shift of the microwave pulses caused by the microburst ahead of the aircraft and displays the area where it is present in the Navigation Display Unit (of the Electronic Flight Instrument System) along with an <b>aural</b> <b>warning.</b>|$|R
50|$|The speed dropped {{progressively}} from 160 kn during lift-off, {{to stall}} speed {{at the end}} of the recording. In fact, about ten seconds before the crash, the noise of the stick shaker is heard on the CVR (which usually indicates that the airplane is 7% from its stall speed). The <b>aural</b> <b>warning,</b> which normally indicates a radar altitude below 200 ft, appeared about six seconds before the end of the recording.|$|R
5000|$|Compared {{with other}} types of <b>warning</b> <b>devices,</b> the {{effectiveness}} of the embedded pavement flashing light system seem to be high. When approaching a crosswalk with an embedded pavement flashing light system, drivers are more apt to slow down and yield to pedestrians than when drivers approach a crosswalk with another type of lighted <b>warning</b> <b>device.</b> Also, compared to a crosswalk with no <b>warning</b> <b>device,</b> drivers are more likely to slow down and yield to pedestrians when the embedded pavement flashing light system is in place.|$|R
50|$|Newer devices {{can also}} act as {{authorized}} flight recorders by producing files in the IGC format {{defined by the}} FAI Gliding Commission. All FLARM devices can be connected to FLARM displays or compatible avionics (EFIS, moving map, etc.) to give visual and <b>aural</b> <b>warnings</b> and also to show the intruder's position on the map. Licensed manufacturers produce integrated FLARM devices in different avionics products. FLARM devices can issue spoken warnings similar to TCAS.|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of safety technologies into complex socio-technical systems requires an integrated and {{holistic approach to}} HF and engineering, considering the effects of failures not only within system boundaries, but also at the interfaces with other systems and humans. Level crossing <b>warning</b> <b>devices</b> are examples of such systems where technically safe states within the system boundary can influence road user performance, giving rise to other hazards that degrade safety of the system. Chris will discuss the challenges that have been encountered to date in developing a safety argument in support of low-cost level crossing <b>warning</b> <b>devices.</b> The design and failure modes of level crossing <b>warning</b> <b>devices</b> {{are known to have}} a significant influence on road user performance; however, quantifying this effect is one of the ongoing challenges in determining appropriate reliability and availability targets for low-cost level crossing <b>warning</b> <b>devices...</b>|$|R

Major reasons for electrocution {{in the construction}} industries are workers contact with the power line or material handling equipment contact with the power line.

Computer modeling is done in ANSYS to simulate human wrist in electrical proximity and electrical contact conditions. For the prevention of equipment related accidents, a low cost <b>warning</b> <b>device</b> has been developed using IC CD 4033. Warning device for the worker is envisaged by using elastic conductive cuffs around the wrist of the worker. Since, human wrist is analogous to hog leg, several experiments were conducted using hog leg specimen. To amplify the voltage across the pair of cuff fixed in the hog leg specimen an instrumentation amplifier is designed and developed...|$|R
2500|$|Approximately 27seconds {{later the}} Airport Movement Area Safety System (AMASS) issued an <b>aural</b> <b>warning</b> of an {{imminent}} collision, {{and the local}} controller instructed the SkyWest aircraft to stop, transmitting, [...] "uh, sky-, skywest uhh fifty seven forty one HOLD HOLD HOLD".

50|$|The {{high pitch}} {{attitude}} {{and loss of}} speed put the airplane in a stall situation. About fourteen seconds after the noise and the “gear up” callout, the stick shaker began to operate intermittently, then continuously, {{until the end of}} the recording. The “don’t sink” <b>aural</b> <b>warning</b> told the crew that the airplane was dropping. The pitch attitude was apparently maintained until impact with the ground, as examination of the site showed. On the wreckage, the horizontal stabilizer trim was found in the position for a normal takeoff, which tends to support this hypothesis.|$|R
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} was conveying {{the body of}} former governor of Ondo State Olusegun Agagu from Lagos to Akure for burial. It lifted off from runway 18L of Murtala Mohammed Airport at about 09:32 local time (08:32 UTC). The crew received warnings from the aircraft's <b>aural</b> <b>warning</b> system during the takeoff-roll and also failed to make [...] "V1" [...] and [...] "rotate" [...] calls; the aircraft then struggled to gain altitude immediately after takeoff. Less than a minute after lifting off, the aircraft impacted terrain in a nose-down-and-near-90-degrees-bank attitude.|$|R
