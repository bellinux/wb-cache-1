50|$|The <b>Aesop</b> <b>shrimp</b> is {{sometimes}} {{found to be}} parasitized by the bopyrid isopod, Hemiarthrus abdominalis. This isopod also parasitizes several other species of shrimp, but has never been found on Pandalus borealis.|$|E
5000|$|Pandalus montagui is {{a species}} of cold-water shrimp in the family Pandalidae. It is the type species of the genus Pandalus and is {{variously}} known as the pink shrimp, pink prawn, <b>Aesop</b> <b>shrimp</b> and Aesop prawn.|$|E
50|$|The terms {{shrimp and}} prawn {{originated}} in Great Britain. In {{the use of}} common names for species, shrimp is applied to smaller species, particularly species that are dorsoventrally depressed (wider than deep) with a shorter rostrum. It is the only term used for species in the family Crangonidae, such as the common shrimp or brown shrimp, Crangon crangon. Prawn is never applied to very small species. It is applied {{to most of the}} larger forms, particularly species that are laterally compressed (deeper than wide) and have a long rostrum. However, the terms are not used consistently. For example, some authors refer to Pandalus montagui as an <b>Aesop</b> <b>shrimp</b> while others refer to it as an Aesop prawn.|$|E
40|$|Larvae of the <b>Aesop</b> <b>shrimp</b> Pandalus montagui Leach (Decapoda: Caridea: Pandalidae), were {{reared in}} the {{laboratory}} at 5 different temperatures (6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 degrees C), and their growth patterns were analyzed in terms of molting frequency, size increments (total length, TL, carapace length, CL), and increase in larval dry weight (W). Pandalus montagui passed through 6 zoeal and 2 - 5 decapodid stages. While 2 of the latter occurred consistently (obligatory stages), up to 3 additional (facultative) decapodid stages were passed before metamorphosis to the first juvenile. Molting occurred at regular intervals, with little interstage variation, so that the instar number {{could be described as}} a linear function of the time of development, with an increasing molting frequency at increasing temperatures. A nonlinear relationship (power function) was found between average intermolt duration and temperature; this regression was linked with data for water temperatures measured during the spring near Helgoland (southern North Sea), in order to predict the approximate duration of larval development and peak settlement in the field. From instar I-VIII, larval size increased as a linear function of the number of molting cycles, but no significant growth and no further morphological changes were observed in later (facultative) larval stages. The morphometric relationship between TL and CL remained linear throughout larval development, with an increasing trend in the TL:CL quotient. W increased exponentially with the number of instars, and as a power function of larval size. The overall patterns of larval development and growth in P. montagui are compared with those known from other pandalid species and in other caridean shrimps...|$|E
