40|$|The {{study is}} {{motivated}} by the observation that the distribution <b>of</b> <b>income</b> across countries varies {{as a function of}} time. It would not be unreasonable to assume that there exists a statistical equilibrium distribution <b>of</b> <b>income</b> with a certain mean and variance, towards which the ensemble of countries considered tend to converge, and there is a speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> towards this said equilibrium. In order to quantify this process, the evolution through time <b>of</b> <b>income</b> around its trend is modeled using a classic stochastic differential equation. The model describes the diffusion of shocks across space, via an income adjustment process with noise. The dynamics rely on two opposing flows: (i) a factor equalization process, and (ii) a counteracting diffusion process. It is hypothesized that these flows follow simple evolutionary laws that can be described with five parameters — parameters that can be estimated from historical data with some accuracy. The dynamic behavior of the model is analytically derived. Both the extent and speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> are analyzed. An empirical application of the proposed model to the evolution of the distribution <b>of</b> <b>income</b> for 25 countries in the European Union tests the validity of the proposed method and suggests that diffusion may be a preferable technique for the analysis <b>of</b> <b>income</b> dynamics...|$|R

40|$|While {{research}} {{concerning the}} fundamental connection between financial crises and international trade, at first appearance, provides conclusive results, it displays two specific methodological biases by ignoring income effects: first, crisis influence is underestimated; second, crisis dynamics {{do not take}} account <b>of</b> <b>income</b> dynamics, thereby giving the analysis a touch of avoidable incompleteness. This paper offers a solution to both problems without leaving the standard framework of the gravity model of trade. The solution is brought by a basic crisis <b>adjustment</b> technique <b>of</b> <b>income.</b> As an empirical test, the developed approach is employed to estimate the crisis response of German trade during the recent global crisis. Results correspond to consequences deducted from an elementary impact model for a quasi-non-crisis country: exports are mainly affected by non-income effects and foreign income effects; imports are influenced by domestic income and global non-income effects, and reveal expected dynamics. The outcome has two implications of interest for policy decisions: (i) stimulus spillovers can come back, and (ii) the indirect effect sensitivity of imports delivers {{a strong case for}} an international coordination of fiscal measures. ...|$|R

This implies that governments cannot tax incomes generated in the traditional sector imposing policy constraints. The relationship between volatility and factor distribution is complex, depending upon the source of the risk and the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor in the formal sector. The policy options available to the government for counteracting changes in volatility are analyzed. We show that, following an increase in risk, a suitable <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> the capital <b>income</b> tax and the wage tax can maintain both factor shares and welfare at their original levels. The second-best optimal tax structure is also determined and shown to require a wage tax below the capital income tax...|$|R

In the short run, GDP growth increases inequality initially, an effect that is reversed in the next period, increases in domestic gross capital formation decreases inequality, and increases in the literacy rate have very minor adverse effects on income equality. However, in the long run these variables have no statistically significant effects on the Gini coefficient.

40|$|Hall (1978) {{showed that}} the {{permanent}} income hypothesis implies that consumption (1) follows a random walk, and (2) cannot be predicted by past <b>income.</b> Reexamination <b>of</b> Hall's data results in rejection of the random walk hypothesis {{in favor of the}} alternative hypothesis of positively autocorrelated changes. Evidently this is due to Hall's choice of a quadratic utility function. A logrithmic utility function implies a random walk in the log of consumption which is supported by the data. Hall reported that past income had a negative but insignificant relation to consumption. Changes in the log <b>of</b> <b>income,</b> however, do have a positive predictive relation to changes in the log <b>of</b> consumption.

Mankiw and Shapiro (1984) have pointed out that the effect of detrending may be to tend to rejection of the theory when it is in fact correct. For Hall's data the effect of detrending is to reverse the sign of the coefficient on past income. Its magnitude is what the Mankiw-Shapiro analysis predicts under the permanent income hypothesis. ...|$|R

Using a constrained maximization process founded on a behavioural equation, we underscore the relevance, for monetary policy, of the assumptions adopted by policymakers regarding how the economic system works. In particular, under a flexible exchange rate regime, the relevant hypotheses are those concerning the supply curve. Under a fixed exchange rate regime the relevant assumptions are those related to the maintenance of the currency agreements and to the internal sustainability of an interest rate setting policy. We demonstrate that these hypotheses define the objective pursued and the strategy followed. Furthermore, if they do not coincide with the actual characteristics of the market, the <b>adjustment</b> dynamics <b>of</b> aggregate <b>income</b> and inflation do not allow convergence toward equilibrium.

The intent {{of this study was to}} investigate if any statistical relationships existed between the marital <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> couples who bring children for therapy and the marital <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> couples who come for therapy and have identified their problem as marital in nature. The major premise of this study was that parents of referred children have as much marital maladjustment as couples who seek marital therapy. The sample for the study consisted of five couples who sought therapy for children and thirteen couples who sought marital therapy. Each couple was requested to complete Manson and Lerner's Marriage Adjustment Inventory (MAI). Personal and background information was also collected. The results of the study indicated there were no significant differences between the two groups in overall couple marital adjustment, female marital <b>adjustment,</b> number <b>of</b> children, <b>income,</b> age, or education. However, there was a significant difference between male parents who bring children for therapy and male spouses who seek therapy who have identified their problems as marital in nature. The latter group showed higher marital adjustment. A significant difference was also found regarding number of years married between the two groups. Couples who brought children for therapy were married more years than couples who sought marital therapy. The lower marital adjustment among male spouses who bring children for therapy as compared to males who seek marital therapy tends to suggest that the problems reside within the male member of the marital dyad, and sometimes those problems exhibit themselves through identification of a child having therapy needs. This, along with the finding of a significant difference in number of years married between the two groups, tends to suggest there is resistance to deal with underlying marital problems, and consequently those couples tend to focus their concerns on a child. Due to the restricted nature of the sample described, care should be taken in generalizing the results beyond the sample...|$|R
40|$|Social welfare {{expenditures}} rose by 4. 6 {{percent in}} 1989; {{as a share}} of GDP they fell below 27 percent {{for the first time in}} five years. Due to the favourable business cycle outlays for unemployment compensation have remained stable for the last two years, new claims for early retirement pensions, however, have not fallen significantly from their earlier peak. The old-age dependency ratio declined marginally in 1989 to 598 pension recipients per 1. 000 active insured. Some 30 percent of old-age insurance expenditure is covered by federal budget subsidies, with little change in the ratio since the last cyclical trough. The real value of retirement benefits rose ¾percent in 1989, a similar increase in 1990 is brought about only by an extra cost-of-living <b>adjustment.</b> Net <b>incomes</b> <b>of</b> many pensioners were raised substantially by the tax reform in 1989.

This is a weak point of such measures. The study investigates {{the change in the}} satisfaction judgements resulting from adaptation to income over time. Adaptation is understood as desensitization (sensitization) to the hedonic effect <b>of</b> <b>income</b> resulting from an upward (downward) <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> the standards. A framework is introduced that provides empirical estimates for the rate of adaptation using data from the Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP) ...|$|R

One objective {{of this paper is}} to investigate the speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> law schools to shifts in the demand for lawyers. Section I presents a theoretical model of the demand for and supply of lawyers. The empirical counterparts of the variables are introduced in Section II. Section III presents the results of the estimation and Section IV compares the actual number of lawyers with the number that would have existed if lawyers earned a normal return on their investment in legal education. Section V presents other evidence of an excess demand for lawyers and offers several explanations for the speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> enrollments in law schools to shifts in the demand for lawyers. The paper ends with a summary of the major findings of the paper. ...|$|R
