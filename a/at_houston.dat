5|$|In 2015, {{researchers}} at The University of Texas Health Science Center <b>at</b> <b>Houston</b> found that plants {{can be a}} vector for prions. When researchers fed hamsters grass that grew on ground where a deer that died with chronic wasting disease (CWD) was buried, the hamsters became ill with CWD, suggesting that prions can bind to plants, which then take them up into the leaf and stem structure, {{where they can be}} eaten by herbivores, thus completing the cycle. It is thus possible that there is a progressively accumulating number of prions in the environment.|$|E

Hill set the record as the oldest Top Fuel champion when he won the season championship as a 57-year-old. It was his twelfth championship.

5|$|In December 1934, at {{the insistence}} of the Automobile Club of New York, several {{numbered}} routes were extended and signed within New York City, with NY22 being one of these routes. NY22 was extended south from the Mount Vernon line in the Bronx along White Plains Road, then it shifted via East 233rd Street to Webster Avenue until Fordham Road (US1). From Fordham Road, it continued south along the Grand Concourse (overlapped with NY100), crossing into Manhattan via East 149th Street to the 145th Street Bridge. In Manhattan, the NY22/100 pair continued south along Lenox Avenue, 110th Street, Fifth Avenue, 96th Street, and Park Avenue, ending <b>at</b> <b>Houston</b> Street (NY1A). By 1941, the alignment within Mount Vernon was shifted east to use Columbus Avenue and South 3rd Avenue (current NY22), continuing its route to New York City via East 233rd Street as before. On January1, 1970, the NY22 designation was removed from Manhattan and most of the Bronx, and the short piece remaining in the city was realigned to meet US1 at its current southern terminus.|$|E
