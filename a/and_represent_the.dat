5|$|Another key {{aspect of}} SIM Lite's mission was {{determining}} {{the upper and}} lower limits of star's masses. Today, scientists understand that there are limits to the how small or large a star can be. Objects that are too small lack the internal pressure to initiate thermonuclear fusion, which is what causes a star to shine. These objects are known as brown dwarfs <b>and</b> <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> lower end of the stellar mass scale. Stars that are too large become unstable and explode in a supernova.|$|E

5|$|Pattern {{recognition}} receptors are proteins used {{by nearly}} all organisms to identify molecules associated with pathogens. Antimicrobial peptides called defensins are an evolutionarily conserved {{component of the}} innate immune response found in all animals and plants, <b>and</b> <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> main form of invertebrate systemic immunity. The complement system and phagocytic cells are also used by most forms of invertebrate life.

5|$|Callisto's surface can {{be divided}} into several geologically {{different}} parts: cratered plains, light plains, bright and dark smooth plains, and various units associated with particular multi-ring structures and impact craters. The cratered plains constitute most of the surface area <b>and</b> <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> ancient lithosphere, a mixture of ice and rocky material. The light plains include bright impact craters like Burr and Lofn, as well as the effaced remnants of old large craters called palimpsests, the central parts of multi-ring structures, and isolated patches in the cratered plains. These light plains are thought to be icy impact deposits. The bright, smooth plains constitute a small fraction of Callisto's surface and are found in the ridge and trough zones of the Valhalla and Asgard formations and as isolated spots in the cratered plains. They were thought to be connected with endogenic activity, but the high-resolution Galileo images showed that the bright, smooth plains correlate with heavily fractured and knobby terrain and do not show any signs of resurfacing. The Galileo images also revealed small, dark, smooth areas with overall coverage less than 10,000km2, which appear to embay the surrounding terrain. They are possible cryovolcanic deposits. Both the light and the various smooth plains are somewhat younger and less cratered than the background cratered plains.|$|E
5|$|Metallic or native iron {{is rarely}} {{found on the}} surface of the Earth because it tends to oxidize, but its oxides are {{pervasive}} <b>and</b> <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> primary ores. While it makes up about 5% of the Earth's crust, both the Earth's inner and outer core are believed to consist largely of an iron-nickel alloy constituting 35% of the mass of the Earth as a whole. Iron is consequently the most abundant element on Earth, but only the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, after oxygen, silicon, and aluminium. Most of the iron in the crust is found combined with oxygen as iron oxide minerals such as hematite (Fe2O3), magnetite (Fe3O4), and siderite (FeCO3). Many igneous rocks also contain the sulfide minerals pyrrhotite and pentlandite.|$|E
5|$|Population in the Sava River basin is {{estimated}} at 8,176,000, and it includes four capitals—Belgrade, Ljubljana, Sarajevo and Zagreb. All of them, except Sarajevo, are also located directly on the river banks <b>and</b> <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> three largest settlements found along the Sava River course. Belgrade, located at {{the confluence of the}} river, is the largest city in the basin with urban population of 1,135,502. Ten municipalities where the city is situated have combined population of 1,283,783 as suburban settlements are added, while the Belgrade metropolitan area encompasses population of 1,639,121. Zagreb is the second largest city on the river, comprising population of 688,163 living in the city itself, and 790,017 in the city-administered area. Together with the Zagreb County, largely corresponding to various definitions of the city's metropolitan area, it has a combined population of 1,110,517. Ljubljana is the third-largest city {{on the banks of the}} Sava, encompassing population of 258,873 living in the city itself and 265,881 in the city-governed area.|$|E

5|$|The {{treatise}} Tractatus of Glanvill, {{which is}} traditionally attributed to Osbert's uncle Ranulf de Glanvill, {{and to which}} Osbert himself may have contributed, names only seven judges, including Osbert. He {{was one of a}} group of royal justices that included Simon of Pattishall, Ralph Foliot, Richard Barre, William de Warenne, and Richard Herriard, used by Hubert Walter, the Justiciar of England during Richard's reign, and chosen for their ability rather than any familial ties. This group replaced the previous system of using mostly local men, <b>and</b> <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> first signs of a professional judiciary. In 1194 Osbert was one of the collectors of the carucage in eastern England, along with Barre and de Warrene.|$|E
5|$|Zajdel's early works, from 1960s {{and early}} 1970s, focuses on {{scientific}} inventions {{and their role}} in space exploration, alien contact or artificial intelligence. As his writing career continued, however, his stories evolved {{to focus on the}} social aspects and often negative consequences of those inventions. Over time, an increasingly visible theme became visible in his works - a concern over dangers inherent in attempts to control the human society. He is also condemning human ignorance, warning against xenophobia, and asking philosophical questions {{about the nature of the}} universe, happiness and human destiny. Zajdel's works from his second period - late 1970s and 1980s - <b>and</b> <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> genres of social and dystopian fiction. In his works, he envisions totalitarian states and societies leaving under extreme forms of mass surveillance.|$|E
