A lot of people don’t seem {{to understand that we}} can’t keep producing records if you keep not paying for them. Bands are having to sell beautiful albums for €2.99, labels can’t give you as much support since they’re losing income too and our alternative radio stations* are practically non existent now, meaning so many wonderful bands will not get a chance to get played on radio as they’ll be competing with huge pop acts.|$|E

25|$|Sir Launfal {{has gone}} to his room, but his faerie {{mistress}} does not appear and Sir Launfal soon realises why. Tryamour will no longer come {{to him when he}} wishes for her since he has given away her existence. Soon, her gifts have disappeared or changed. Now he is brought to trial. Since the jury of his peers <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the Queen is more likely to have propositioned Launfal than the other way around, they believe Launfal's version of the encounter. However, for his insult he is given a year and a fortnight to produce the beautiful lady as proof of his boast; Guenevere says she is willing to be blinded if he manages to produce such a woman. As the day of the proof progresses, the Queen presses for him to be executed while others express doubt, particularly when two parties of gorgeous women ride up. Finally Tryamour arrives and exculpates Launfal on both counts. She breathes on Guenevere and blinds her. Gyfre, now visible, brings his horse Blaunchard, and Tryamour, Launfal, and her ladies ride away to the island of Olyroun, which in Marie de France's twelfth-century version of the tale is Avalon. Once a year, on a certain day, Sir Launfal returns and his horse may be heard neighing and a knight may joust with him, although he was never seen again in Arthur's land.|$|E

500|$|During World War II, Citizen Kane was {{not seen}} in most European countries. It was shown in France {{for the first time}} on July 10, 1946 at the Marbeuf theatre in Paris. Initially [...] most French film critics were {{influenced}} by the negative reviews of Jean-Paul Sartre in 1945 and Georges Sadoul in 1946. At that time many French intellectuals and filmmakers shared Sartre's negative opinion that Hollywood filmmakers were uncultured. Sartre criticized the film's flashbacks for its nostalgic and romantic preoccupation with the past instead of the realities of the present and said that [...] "the whole film is based on a misconception of what cinema is all about. The film is in the past tense, whereas we <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> cinema has got to be in the present tense." ...|$|E

On a list of [...] "Greatest Soap Opera Supercouples" [...] by Kim Potts of The Huffington Post, Nick and Sharon were placed 16th. They are referred to by fans as [...] "Shick", a combination of Sharon and Nick's names. The couple's onscreen reunion in 2009 allowed the show's Nielsen Ratings to rise by an average of 447,000, capitalizing on their popularity. Nick's relationship with Phyllis has also gained a fan following, who refer to them as [...] "Phick".|$|E

500|$|We <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> {{steel making}} has been {{important}} to south Wales, just as slate making has changed {{the landscape of the}} north. We have to use a special type of steel that won't go rusty near to the salt-laden, maritime air of Cardiff Bay. This stainless steel will be made near to Pontypool. For the Wales Millennium Centre I thought it was important that the materials should have a [...] "natural" [...] texture, and that they should be instantly recognisable to anyone seeing them, even from a distance. For this reason I felt it was important that the steel of the shell should have the rough grain and the riveted pattern that we think of as more typical of old industrial structures, such as those that used to be commonplace around the landscape of the industrial south. —architect Jonathan Adams ...|$|E

Later that evening, Rhett, having heard the rumors, forces Scarlett {{to attend a}} birthday party for Ashley; incapable of believing anything bad of her beloved sister-in-law, Melanie stands by Scarlett's side so that <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> she believes the gossip to be false. After returning home from the party, Scarlett finds Rhett downstairs drunk, and they argue about Ashley. Rhett kisses Scarlett against her will, stating his intent {{to have sex with}} her that night, and carries the struggling Scarlett to the bedroom. The next day, Rhett apologizes for his behavior and offers Scarlett a divorce, which she rejects, saying {{that it would be a}} disgrace. When Rhett returns from an extended trip to London Scarlett informs him that she is pregnant, but an argument ensues which results in her falling down a flight of stairs and suffering a miscarriage. As she is recovering, tragedy strikes when Bonnie dies while attempting to jump a fence with her pony.|$|E
500|$|Reaction to the antagonist's {{death was}} mixed. [...] Kristin Dos Santos of E! criticized the writing for Keamy when he futilely asks Sayid where his fellow 815 {{survivors}} are {{so that he}} can kill them, but enjoyed his attractive physique, writing that [...] "that guy is deep-fried evil, and he must die horribly for what he did to Alex, but in the meantime, well, he's certainly a well-muscled young man". [...] The Huffington Post's Jay Glatfelter also called for Keamy's death, stating that [...] "nothing would be better to me than him getting run over by Hurley's Dharma Bus", alluding to a scene in the third-season finale. [...] Dan Compora of SyFy Portal commented that [...] "Keamy took a bit too long to die. [...] Yes, he was wearing a bulletproof vest so it wasn't totally unexpected, but it was a bit predictable." [...] In a review of the season finale, Erin Martell of AOL's TV Squad declared her disappointment in the conclusion of Keamy's arc, stating that [...] "it's always a shame when the hot guys die, [...] Kevin Durand did an amazing job with the character … he'll be missed." [...] In a later article titled [...] "Lost Season Four Highlights", Martell noted Durand's [...] "strong performance" [...] that was [...] "particularly fun to watch" [...] and wrote that [...] "we [...] <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Widmore's the big bad, but Keamy became the face of evil on the island in his stead." ...|$|E

500|$|Metalholic said 'I’m back…” [...] I can’t {{think of}} a more {{appropriate}} way to flow into the second track “Tragic Magic.” [...] Ronnie Radke is most definitely back {{and he is not}} afraid to tell you so.' This fairly slow tempo song obviously takes a few jabs at Radke’s former band Escape the Fate, but overall is a solid melodic song, [...] The third track “The Drug in Me is You” was the second single and the band’s first video and might I add a very entertaining video. “The Drug in Me is You,” is a nicely constructed musical performance that is just flat out catchy. [...] To me the song is about something most people can relate to, the battle you have with yourself, with your morality, with your demons. [...] We <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> we can be our own worst enemy and the only person that you truly have to blame in many instances is yourself. [...] “Trying to consume, the drug in me is you and I’m so high on misery can’t you see,” evokes the feeling that you are your own drug, the creator of your misery and if you need to point fingers at someone try looking in the mirror first. [...] “If we are born to die and we all die to live, then what’s the point of living life if life just contradicts?” [...] Questions we all ask when we pick ourselves up off the floor and do the only thing we can do, try again. [...] Life is what you make of it, if you have lost yourself, it is up to you to find your way again. [...] I got all profound there for a second, it happens.|$|E

[...] You <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I do not drink, and I am going to keep you all from it. [...] Don’t think because you may be closely related to me I will shield you, for I will not.
