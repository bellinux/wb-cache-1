5|$|For THSRC, {{the over}} heavy <b>accounting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fixed cost {{of fixed assets}} like rolling stock and {{infrastructure}} (depreciation) is a significant non-cash element of total operating costs. In its {{first two years of}} operation, THSRC applied straight-line depreciation, distributing costs evenly over a period of 26.5 years. As a result, the balance of operating revenues and costs (operating income) showed a high loss {{in the first year of}} operation, which was only reduced as revenues grew in the second year. The depreciation period set for THSRC reflected the length of the B.O.T. concession rather than the much longer lifespan of the infrastructure, and it is the factor for the operating loss. After adopting an activity depreciation method which is variable in time, THSRC posted its first operating profit for 2009, the third year of operation. The company reported its first annual profit of NT$5.78 billion for 2011 after five years of operation.|$|E
5|$|In early 1947, France, Britain and the United States unsuccessfully {{attempted}} {{to reach an}} agreement with the Soviet Union for a plan envisioning an economically self-sufficient Germany, including a detailed <b>accounting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> industrial plants, goods and infrastructure already removed by the Soviets. In June 1947, in accordance with the Truman Doctrine, the United States enacted the Marshall Plan, a pledge of economic assistance for all European countries willing to participate, including the Soviet Union. Under the plan, which President Harry S. Truman signed on 3 April 1948, the US government gave to Western European countries over $13 billion (equivalent to $189.39 billion in 2016) to rebuild the economy of Europe. Later, the program {{led to the creation of}} the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation.|$|E
5|$|Other {{pressures}} on O'Neill's colonization plan were {{the high cost}} of access to Earth orbit and the declining cost of energy. Building solar power stations in space was economically attractive when energy prices spiked during the 1979 oil crisis. When prices dropped in the early 1980s, funding for space solar power research dried up. His plan had also been based on NASA's estimates for the flight rate and launch cost of the Space Shuttle, numbers that turned out to have been wildly optimistic. His 1977 book quoted a Space Shuttle launch cost of $10 million, but in 1981 the subsidized price given to commercial customers started at $38 million. Eventual <b>accounting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> full cost of a launch in 1985 raised this as high as $180 million per flight.|$|E

25|$|The Franco-Prussian War (1870–71) {{showed up}} {{problems}} of the private railway {{to cope with the}} need to move troops quickly, leading to the second Railway Act of 1872.

40|$|Summary by Simon Susen : In the {{eleventh}} chapter, ‘Bourdieu’s Sociological Fiction: A Phenomenological Reading of Habitus’, Bruno Frère provides {{a detailed analysis}} of Bourdieu’s conception of habitus. Frère points out that just as we need to be aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> key strengths <b>of</b> Bourdieu’s genetic-structuralist approach, we need to identify its main weaknesses. Hence it is possible to draw on Bourdieu’s approach whilst developing it further and thereby overcoming its most significant shortcomings.

Following Motown's decision to rechristen the Supremes as Diana Ross & the Supremes, Ruffin felt entitled to the same treatment and demanded that his group be renamed as well, to David Ruffin & the Temptations. Ruffin was also causing friction with Berry Gordy by demanding an <b>accounting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group's earnings; Motown partially acquiesced by allowing the Temptations to retain an outside accounting firm, but the firm did not have full access to the books from the Temptations' manager, International Talent Management, Inc. - a subsidiary of Motown.|$|E

An even larger scoring scandal occurred in 1985 in which pro racer Peter Loncarevich apparently beat Greg Hill for the number one pro racer by a mere 3 points.
