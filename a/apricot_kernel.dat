40|$|Bitter <b>apricot</b> <b>kernels</b> have {{increasingly}} been offered {{for direct consumption}} for some time now, especially through Internet channels. In some cases, advertisements claim that <b>apricot</b> <b>kernels</b> offer protection against cancer. However, {{there is no scientific}} evidence of any such benefits. In fact, consumption of bitter <b>apricot</b> <b>kernels</b> can lead to severe poisoning which can be fatal if larger quantities are ingested. The toxic effect of bitter <b>apricot</b> <b>kernels</b> is due to the food ingredient amygdalin. From amygdalin, cyanide is released during ingestion and digestion. The body can break down small amounts of cyanide through metabolic processes. For adults, a quantity of two large bitter <b>apricot</b> <b>kernels</b> can be regarded as safe in terms of acute poisoning symptoms. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) therefore recommends that consumers limit their intake of bitter <b>apricot</b> <b>kernels</b> to no more than two a day or that no <b>apricot</b> <b>kernels</b> are eaten at all. In the opinion of the BfR, packaging of bitter <b>apricot</b> <b>kernels</b> intended for direct consumption should carry warnings of potential health risks and state the recommended maximum daily intake. To protect children against ingestion of large quantities of bitter <b>apricot</b> <b>kernels,</b> they should only be offered in small packs.

40|$|The Master’s {{thesis is}} focused on the {{analysis}} of biologically active substances in <b>apricot</b> <b>kernel</b> oil. Apricot oil has recently begun to be widely used in the cosmetics industry, particularly as a part of massage oils or as part of moisturizing creams. The aim of this thesis is to characterize and assess the quality of apricot oil, determination of the content of selected active ingredients, through a series of analytical methods, and subsequent use of this oil in cosmetics and food industry. The thesis is based on the comparison of the quality of pure apricot oil and the oil after the fermentation process. It has been found that <b>apricot</b> <b>kernel</b> oil actually contains large amounts of unsaturated fatty acids. The excellent antioxidant activity of apricot kernels was proven too, especially those after fermentation. In addition to antioxidant activity, the samples contain a relatively large amount of tocopherol after the fermentation. Tocopherol is important for the uptake of free radicals in lipid bilayers, thus slowing down aging, protect the membranes and also prevent from possible cardiovascular and oncological diseases. Furthermore, in the Master’s thesis there were confirmed not only the hydration effects of creams with apricot oil, but also their ability of inhibic transepidermal loss of water from the epidermis.

40|$|A human study {{conducted}} by the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) enables more differentiated risk assessment of cyanide exposure following the consumption of bitter <b>apricot</b> <b>kernels,</b> persipan, linseed or manioc (cassava). The study results have now been published in the scientific journal “Archives of Toxicology” (DOI 10. 1007 /s 00204 - 015 - 1479 - 8, open access). Bitter <b>apricot</b> <b>kernels,</b> linseeds and manioc contain, as natural plant substances, cyanogenic glycosides in relatively high concentrations. Through the enzyme ß-glucosidase which is also contained in the plants, cyanide is released during consumption. Cyanides are salts of hydrocyanic acid. Ingestion of a sufficiently high dose can lead to acute poisoning by blocking energy generation. The BfR study shows that in terms of risk assessment of foods with cyanogenic glycosides it is very important, over and above the dose of bound cyanide, whether and to what extent the plant enzyme ß-glucosidase is active. For only fast enzymatic release leads to high cyanide blood levels in the body which determine toxicity. The known health risks resulting from the consumption of bitter <b>apricot</b> <b>kernels</b> and unprocessed manioc are confirmed by the human {{study conducted}} by the BfR. Compared to these foods, the consumption of linseed, with the same dose of bound cyanide, leads to much lower maximum levels (peak levels) in the blood.

Manal K Abdel-Rahman Background and aims: The {{present study was}} aimed to analyze the chemical composition of ground <b>apricot</b> <b>kernel</b> (GAK) and examine its effect on hepatic fibrosis in vivo induced by dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) in rats. Methods and results: Hepatic fibrosis was induced by intraperitoneal injections of 10 mg/kg DMN for 3 consecutive days each week {{over a period of}} 4 wk. The rats were randomly assigned to five groups of nine rats each: the negative control group (NC), the hepatic fibrosis group (PC), hepatic fibrosis supplemented with GAK (0. 5 mg/kg/BW/rat), hepatic fibrosis supplemented with GAK (1 mg/kg/BW/rat) and hepatic fibrosis supplemented with GAK (1. 5 mg/kg/BW/rat). Rats were killed, blood was collected and livers were excised for biochemical measurements and histological examination. Results indicate that the diet supplemented with GAK led to improving liver function, lipid peroxides, and liver CAT, SOD and GSH. These results were confirmed by liver histology. Hierarchically high levels f GAK (1. 5 mg/kg/BW/rat) gave the best results compared to other tested levels. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that GAK administration specifically (1. 5 mg/kg/BW/rat) can effectively improve liver fibrosis caused by DMN, and may be used as a therapeutic option and preventive measure against hepatic fibrosis.
