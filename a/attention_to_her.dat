5|$|Focused on hockey, {{exposed to}} drugs and alcohol and {{frequently}} getting into fights, James paid little <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> education and nearly dropped out of school. A vice-principal at Valley Park Middle School, Ross Dixon, encouraged her to pay greater <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> studies, allowing her to graduate from Overlea High School, now named Marc Garneau Collegiate Institute, and move onto Seneca College in Toronto. James struggled academically in her first year at Seneca, partially because she had rarely been held accountable for failing in her studies in the past, and partly because she was playing two sports at both the college and community level while working part-time jobs to help pay the family's bills. Seneca's hockey coach Lee Trempe had several arguments with James before she began to take her studies seriously.|$|E
5|$|The {{nations of}} the world fund the {{construction}} of the machine at Cape Canaveral. An international panel is assembled to choose a candidate to travel in the machine. Although Arroway is a frontrunner to go, her hopes are scuppered by Christian philosopher Palmer Joss, a panel member whom Arroway met and briefly became romantically involved with in Puerto Rico. When he brings <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> atheism, the panel selects Drumlin instead on the belief he would be more representative of humanity. However, on the day the machine is tested, a religious fanatic destroys the machine in a suicide bombing, killing Drumlin and many others.|$|E
5|$|The woman's {{left ear}} is set, {{according}} to art historian Norbert Schneider, unnaturally high and far back, parallel {{to her eyes}} rather than to her nose; this position is probably an artistic device used to continue {{the flow of the}} diagonal line of the veil's inner-right wing. In the 15th century, veils were normally worn for modesty, to hide the sensuality of the flesh. In this work the veil has the opposite effect; the woman's face is framed by the headdress to draw <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> beauty.|$|E

5|$|In 1935 Wong {{was dealt}} {{the most severe}} {{disappointment}} of her career, when Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer refused to consider her for the leading role of the Chinese character O-Lan in {{the film version of}} Pearl S. Buck's The Good Earth, choosing instead the white actress Luise Rainer to play the leading role. Wong spent the next year touring China, visiting her family's ancestral village and studying Chinese culture. In the late 1930s, she starred in several B movies for Paramount Pictures, portraying Chinese, and Chinese Americans in a positive light. She paid less <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> film career during World War II, when she devoted her time and money to helping the Chinese cause against Japan. Wong returned to the public eye in the 1950s in several television appearances.|$|E
5|$|In early 2001, Boisselier {{promised the}} cloning {{of a human}} child within a year, drawing further <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> work. A {{prosecutor}} in New York began investigating her compliance with local medical laws. Boisselier said that the Food and Drug Administration also surreptitiously investigated her, and RaÃ«l claimed that U.S. President George W. Bush was concerned about Clonaid's work. The caretaker of the laboratory that Hunt had rented grew suspicious about their work and contacted law enforcement. They spoke with the FDA, who searched the site and persuaded Boisselier to suspend her cloning work pending legal clarification. After Hunt {{was asked by the}} laboratory's caretaker to shut down the cloning operation, he broke with Boisselier and criticized her for seeking media attention. The caretaker also spoke publicly, saying that Boisselier was seldom at the laboratory. Boisselier then announced that she was moving her cloning operations overseas. Boisselier never faced any legal charges in connection with the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Manning was incensed {{that the}} British Council did not {{immediately}} find a job for Reggie, whom she considered {{one of their most}} brilliant teachers. She took her revenge by writing scurrilous verse about the Council's representative, C.F.A. Dundas, later immortalised as the ineffectual Colin Gracey in Fortunes of War. Manning's characters were often based on real people though she never drew precisely from life. Her mocking portrait of the British Council lecturer Professor Lord Pinkrose was loosely based on Lord Dunsany, sent to occupy the Byron Chair of English at Athens University in 1940. She also resented that Amy Smart, wife of Walter Smart and frequent patron of artists, poets and writers in Cairo, paid so little <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> and Reggie; she later took revenge in a similar way.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{before the}} action began, Persano {{decided to leave}} Re d'Italia and {{transfer}} to Affondatore, though none of his subordinates on the other ships {{were aware of the}} change. They were thus left to fight as individuals without direction. More dangerously, by stopping Re d'Italia, he allowed a significant gap to open up between Vacca's three ships {{and the rest of the}} fleet. Tegetthoff took his fleet through the gap between Vacca's and Persano's ships, though he failed to ram any Italian vessels on the first pass. The Austrians then turned back toward Persano's ships, and took Re d'Italia, San Martino, and Palestro under heavy fire. The Austrian ships concentrated their fire on Re d'Italia, paying particular <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> stern. In their attempts to ram her, one of the Austrian ships destroyed Re d'Italias rudder, leaving her unmaneuverable.|$|E
5|$|When Jodie Gold (Kylie Babbington) and Poppy Meadow (Rachel Bright) become homeless, Anthony {{asks them}} {{to move in with}} him and Tyler. The girls move in, and it soon emerges that Poppy is {{attracted}} to Anthony. He prefers Jodie though, but nevertheless asks Poppy out on a date. After he and Jodie talk, Anthony suddenly kisses her, but she pulls away immediately. Jodie later reveals she is moving out and later confesses that she and Anthony kissed, which greatly upsets Poppy. Jodie and Poppy reconcile and decide to move away from Walford which upsets Anthony. Anthony takes a romantic interest to Amira Masood (Preeya Kalidas) when she kisses him, however Anthony becomes frustrated when she pays more <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> soon to be ex-husband Syed (Marc Elliott), who she is trying to win back. Amira later invites Anthony for a meal at her family's home, but it is awkward.|$|E

60|$|The {{two girls}} became rather uneasy {{during the days}} their cousin spent in the society of Aunt Jane.

25|$|When Maria's eldest sister Alexandra visited Gatchina in July 1894, she was {{surprised}} to see how weak her brother-in-law Alexander III had become. At the time Maria had long known that he was ill and did not have long left. She now turned her <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> eldest son, the future Nicholas II, for it was on him that both her personal future {{and the future of the}} dynasty now depended.|$|E
25|$|After their father's {{death in}} 1852, Grand Duchess Maria morganatically {{remarried}} to Count Grigori Stroganov two years later. As this union was kept secret {{from her father}} Emperor Nicholas I (and her brother Emperor Alexander II could not permit the union, preferring instead to feign ignorance), Maria was forced into exile abroad. Alexander felt sympathy for his sister however, and paid special <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> children from her first marriage, who lived in St. Petersburg without their mother.|$|E
25|$|A running gag {{throughout}} {{the series is}} that Namiko is extremely clumsy, and will very often fall in holes, fall out of buildings (usually out of her classroom window), or off of cliffs. While the students in her class are initially concerned about her many falls, they become jaded by how often it occurs and pay no <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> potentially getting injured {{later on in the}} series. Namiko remains a tough individual though and always recovers after her falls no matter how severe they may be.|$|E

Burns said that Tyler was untidy and relaxed, which was {{the exact opposite of}} Mark. Tyler had a short-lived romance with Imogen Willis (Ariel Kaplan), before switching his <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> half-sister Paige Smith (Olympia Valance).|$|R
60|$|These {{years had}} passed quietly at Stoneborough, with little change since Mary's marriage. She was the happy {{excellent}} wife that she was made to be; and perhaps it was better for Ethel that the first severance had been so decisive that Mary's <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> old home were received as favours, instead of as the mere scanty relics of her former attachment.|$|R
60|$|But Mary {{was reading}} the letter and paid no <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> what <b>her</b> father was saying. Presently she gave a sudden exclamation.|$|R
25|$|The arsonists left {{campaign}} {{literature and}} {{a photograph of}} activist Emmeline Pankhurst, to draw <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> incarceration in Holloway Prison, {{and the practice of}} force-feeding her and others, when on hunger strikes. Cricket-loving Sir Arthur Conan-Doyle reacted angrily to the fire in a meeting of The National League for Opposing Womenâs Suffrage, dubbing the arsonists âfemale hooligansâ and comparing the attack to âblowing up a blind man and his dog.â The pavilion was rebuilt within nine weeks, in time for the Tunbridge Wells Cricket Week, helped by a series of fund-raising concerts at Royal Tunbridge Wells' Opera House.|$|E
25|$|With Kirk's help, Noel {{reaches the}} facility's control room through a {{ventilation}} duct and interrupts Kirk's next neutralizer session by shutting off {{power to the}} entire complex. Freed from the neutralizer, Kirk attacks Adams, leaving him unconscious in the treatment room. A guard discovers Noel's sabotage, restoring power before turning his <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> She tricks him by feigning unconsciousness before surprising him with a well aimed kick, propelling him into the circuitry and electrocuting him. She turns off the power. With the force field now off, Spock, McCoy and a security team beam down to the planet. Spock restores power to the colony after disabling the force field.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, a {{cold case}} team {{investigated}} the killing to no avail. By 2011, Andy van den Hurk {{had moved to}} England. On 8 March, he confessed on Facebook to killing Nicole, and was arrested by British police. He was extradited to the Netherlands on 30 March, but was released five days later as the Facebook post was the only evidence against him. Later, Andy retracted his confession, saying that he believed his father Ad had raped Nicole and later killed her, which Ad denied; in 2016, Andy {{said that he had}} falsely confessed in order to revive <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> death and get her body exhumed for DNA testing.|$|E

Ambrose accepts the betâ"First over Westminster Bridge." ...|$|R
60|$|When there, though looking most wretchedly, she ate {{more and}} was calmer than {{her sister had}} expected. Had she tried to speak, or had she been {{conscious}} of half Mrs. Jennings's well-meant but ill-judged <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> this calmness {{could not have been}} maintained; but not a syllable escaped her lips; and the abstraction of her thoughts preserved her in ignorance of every thing that was passing before her.|$|R
60|$|It {{was very}} strange! She {{had begun to}} think he really loved <b>her,</b> and <b>to</b> fancy his affection for her {{something}} more than common; and his sister still said that he cared for nobody else. Yet {{there must have been}} some marked display of <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> cousin, there must have been some strong indiscretion, since her correspondent was not of a sort to regard a slight one.|$|R
25|$|Genie was the last, {{and second}} surviving, of four {{children}} of parents living in Arcadia, California, and was born in 1957 without any noted complications at a normal, healthy weight and size. Around {{the time of her}} birth, her father began to isolate himself and his family from other people. Her father decided that she was severely mentally retarded because she was late to walk due to treatment for a congenital hip dislocation, a view which intensified as she got older, and consequently disliked her. He tried not to talk to or pay <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> and discouraged his wife and son, who was five years older than Genie, from doing so.|$|E
25|$|The November 1980 {{release of}} John Lennon's album Double Fantasy seems an {{impressive}} feat {{for a new}} label, {{but at the time}} Lennon stated that Geffen was the only one with enough confidence in him to agree to a deal without hearing the record first. Yoko Ono, Lennon's wife and partner, stated that Geffen was the only label head to pay <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> In December 1980, Lennon was shot dead and Double Fantasy became a massive seller. Over the years Geffen Records/DGC has become well known as a label, releasing works by the likes of Olivia Newton-John, Asia with Steve Howe and John Wetton, Elton John, Cher, Sonic Youth, Aerosmith, Whitesnake, XTC, Peter Gabriel, Lone Justice, Blink-182, Guns N' Roses, Nirvana, Lifehouse, Tyketto, Pat Metheny, Sloan, the Stone Roses and Neil Young.|$|E
25|$|Genie {{was born}} {{about five years}} after her brother, around the time that her father began to isolate {{himself and his family}} from others. At birth she was in the 50th {{percentile}} for weight. The following day she showed signs of Rh incompatibility and required a blood transfusion, but had no sequelae and was otherwise described as healthy. A medical appointment at three months showed that she was gaining weight normally, but found a congenital hip dislocation which required her to wear a highly restrictive Frejka splint from the age of 4Â½ to 11 months. The splint caused Genie to be late to walk, and researchers believed this led her father to start speculating that she was mentally retarded. As a result, he made a concerted effort not to talk to or pay <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> and strongly discouraged his wife and son from doing so.|$|E
