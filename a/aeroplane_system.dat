40|$|The Air France 447 crash {{occurred}} in 2009 when an Airbus A 330 stalled {{and fell into}} the Atlantic Ocean, killing all on board. Following a major investigation, {{it was concluded that}} the incident resulted from a series of events that began when the autopilot disconnected after the aircraft's Pitot tubes froze in an adverse weather system. The findings place scrutiny on the aircrew's subsequent lack of awareness {{of what was going on}} and of what procedure was required, and their failure to control the aircraft. This article argues that this is inappropriate, instead offering a systems level view that can be used to demonstrate how systems, not individuals, lose situation awareness. This is demonstrated via a distributed situation awareness-based description of the events preceding the crash. The findings demonstrate that it was the sociotechnical system comprising aircrew, cockpit and <b>aeroplane</b> <b>systems</b> that lost situation awareness, rather than the aircrew alone...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} {{distributed}} real-time systems {{is difficult because}} of the large number of issues involved with their design [...] - inter-process communication, module structure, timing constraints, hardware constraints, reliability, etc. In this paper, we show how such issues may usefully be partitioned through the use of viewpoints before being combined together to provide an overall design solution. Our design approach and notation is based upon a set of concepts which are analagous to the construction industry's notion of an architecture which acts as the central artefact within the civil engineering design process. The approach is introduced by way of a small case study which allows the reader to be exposed to the detail of the notation as it becomes necessary within the development of the example design. 1. Introduction Distributed real-time systems {{are becoming more and more}} widely used in applications such as power station monitoring <b>systems,</b> <b>aeroplane</b> control <b>systems,</b> etc. A distrib [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The Air France 447 crash {{occurred}} in 2009 when an Airbus A 330 stalled {{and fell into}} the Atlantic Ocean, killing all on board. Following a major investigation, the French accident investigation authority concluded that the incident resulted {{from a series of}} events that began when the autopilot disconnected {{as a result of the}} aircraft’s Pitot tubes freezing upon entry to an adverse weather system. The findings placed scrutiny on the aircrew’s response, pinpointing their lack of awareness of what was going on and of what procedure was required to respond. This reflects a common tendency for accident investigations to cite poor situation awareness on behalf of individuals as a key causal factor. This presentation argues that this is inappropriate, instead offering a systems level view that can be used to demonstrate how systems and not individuals lose situation awareness. This is demonstrated via a systems analysis of situation awareness during the Air France crash. The analysis demonstrates that it was the sociotechnical system comprising aircrew, cockpit and <b>aeroplane</b> <b>systems</b> that lost situation awareness, rather than the aircrew alone. In closing, the importance of taking a systems view when examining concepts such as situation awareness during accident events is articulated...|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the effective range of a helicopter, Kamov designer Vladimir Barshevsky drew up a design for a helicopter with wings and an <b>aeroplane</b> propulsive <b>system.</b> In 1954 a proposal was agreed to produce three Ka-22s. The programme was delayed and on 28 March 1956 prototypes 2 and 3 were cancelled. The Ka-22 first lifted from the ground on 17 June 1959, and made its first untethered flight on 15 August 1959. Serious control difficulties were encountered, leading to orders being postponed until the problems were solved, and in July 1960 an order was received to manufacture three more Ka-22s.|$|R
50|$|The TV {{documentary}} series Mayday also reports claims in Season 9 Episode 3 that the flight recorder {{might have been}} tampered with and indicated that four seconds had been cut from the tape; this was shown by playing back a control tower tape and comparing it to the remaining tape. The pilot argues that he attempted to apply thrust earlier than indicated in the flight recorder data. When he increased throttle to level off at 100 ft, the engines did not respond. The pilot claims that this indicated {{a problem with the}} <b>aeroplane's</b> fly-by-wire <b>system</b> rather than pilot error. After some seconds he got worried and thought there was something like a short-circuit in the completely computerized throttle control. So he pulled the throttle back all the way and forth again. By that time the aircraft had touched the trees.|$|R

In those areas of the <b>aeroplane</b> where multiple <b>systems</b> and components are installed in close proximity, it should be ensured that the zonal analysis would identify any failure or malfunction which by itself is considered sustainable but which could have more serious effects when adversely affecting other adjacent systems or components. https://web.archive.org/web/20110719034508/http://www.easa.eu.int/agency-measures/docs/agency-decisions/2010/2010-013-R/CS-25%20Amdt%2010.pdf ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decade it became a common {{practice}} to formalise software requirements to improve the clarity of users' expectations. In this work we build {{on the fact that}} functional requirements can be expressed in temporal logic and we propose new sanity checking techniques that automatically detect flaws and suggest improvements of given requirements. Specifically, we describe and experimentally evaluate approaches to consistency and redundancy checking that identify all inconsistencies and pinpoint their exact source (the smallest inconsistent set). We further report on the experience obtained from employing the consistency and redundancy checking in an industrial environment. To complete the sanity checking we also describe a semi-automatic completeness evaluation that can assess the coverage of user requirements and suggest missing properties the user might have wanted to formulate. The usefulness of our completeness evaluation is demonstrated in a case study of an <b>aeroplane</b> control <b>system...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{efficient}} {{functioning of}} modern society {{depends on the}} smooth operation of many complex systems comprised of several pieces of equipment that provide a variety of products and services. These include transport systems (trains, buses, ferries, ships and <b>aeroplanes),</b> communication <b>systems</b> (television, telephone and computer networks), utilities (water, gas and electricity networks), manufacturing plants (to produce industrial products and consumer durables), processing plants (to extract and process minerals and oil), hospitals (to provide services) and banks (for financial transactions) to name a few. All equipment is unreliable {{in the sense that}} it degrades with age and/or usage and fails when it is no longer capable of delivering the products and services. When a complex system fails, the consequences can be dramatic. It can result in serious economic losses, affect humans and do serious damage to the environment as, for example, the crash of an aircraft in flight, the failure of a sewage processing plant or the collapse of a bridge...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to mount Airborne Electromagnetic (AEM) sensors for sea-ice {{thickness}} retrieval under the wings of long range airplanes and to quantify existing noise sources. Another aim was to determine and to characterise thickness distribution functions of several regions in the central Arctic. The accuracy of a prototype <b>aeroplane</b> EM <b>system</b> {{was found to be}} /- 0. 5 m. The accuracy was reduced due to wing flexure, which produces noise of equal amplitude as the wanted ocean signal. Other noise sources are inductive ocean-aeroplane coupling and pitch which may disturb the measurements by another 10 percent of the signal. It is suggested to take the 90 ° out of phase response signal, since wing flexure noise mainly is 180 ° out of phase. On transects in the central Arctic mean thickness standard errors as low as 0. 2 m could be obtained for 10 km long profiles in less deformed ice independently of the age of the ice regime. In a deformed multi year ice (MYI) regime standard errors of 0. 2 m were obtained on transects as long as 100 km. These results show that a reduction of central Arctic mean sea-ice thickness by 1. 8 between 1991 and 2007 was higher than typical spatial variability...|$|R
40|$|Gravity feed is one {{fuel supply}} way for {{aeroplane}} and the simulation {{of it is}} very important. The traditional method to calculate the gravity feed is to assume that only one tank in fuel system supplies the needed fuel to the engine, and then calculated for the single branch. Actually, all fuel tanks compete for supplying fuel and the key problem for gravity feed calculation is to simulate the multiple-branch and transient process. The present paper gives the mathematical model for fuel flow pipe, pump, check valve and the simulation model for fuel tank at first, and then presented a new calculation model for gravity feed fuel of <b>aeroplane</b> fuel <b>system</b> based on the flow network theory and time difference method. The model takes into consideration all fuel tanks and can solve the multiple-branch and transient process of gravity feed. Finally, the thesis gives a numerical example for {{a certain type of}} aircraft, achieved the variations of fuel level and flow mass per second of each fuel tanks, the variations of the fuel pressure at the engine inlet, and predicted the maximum time that the aeroplane could fly safely under gravity feed. The numerical example indicts that the method proposed here is intrinsically superior to the traditional methods and is closer to understanding the real seriousness of the fuel supply situation. </p...|$|R
40|$|M. Ing. Most {{companies}} in the modern capitalist world are driven by profitability. Since these companies compete with each other, {{there will always be}} a drive to minimise the costs of the company. The South African mining industry is no exception. Preventive maintenance and downtime of equipment are some of the biggest contributories to costs within the mining industry. In their efforts to achieve minimal downtime engineers have developed many maintenance strategies throughout history, but with the advent of the low cost computer systems, it has revolutionised the maintenance industry. Maintenance systems were developed extensively for equipment with low or no redundancy and high consequence of failure in the 60 s, by military institutions on equipment such as <b>aeroplanes.</b> These <b>systems</b> coupled with the autonomy of computer capabilities evolved into maintenance driven software. These systems have filtered through to the mining industry in South Africa in the past ten years and are used widespread by the bigger mining houses. Stockholding practises have also improved substantially as consequence of widespread computer usage. Best practises are developed for industries such as fast moving consumer goods. The base of knowledge developed in these industries is also adopted by the mining industry in recent times. This thesis aims firstly to explain the fundamentals of reliability engineering and how these fundamentals are practically implemented through a predictive maintenance program and computer aided management systems in the industry. Then further aims to use the information gathered through these systems and consolidate it with accurate stockholding procedures into a critical spare evaluation strategy. Since the South African mining industry has increased its dependency on global equipment, they have also left themselves exposed to the logistics of obtaining services and spares regarding this equipment. Critical parts evaluation is not common practice within the mining industry but the risks and consequence of failure have prompted more research and the need for a strategy...|$|R
40|$|Speech {{understanding}} systems (SUS's) {{came of age}} in late 1971 as {{a result}} of a five year development programme instigated by the Information Processing Technology Office of the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the Department of Defense in the United States. The aim of the programme was to research and develop practical man-machine communication systems. It has been argued since, that the main contribution of this project was not in the development of speech science, but in the development of artificial intelligence. That debate is beyond the scope of this paper, though no one would question the fact that the field to benefit most within artificial intelligence as a result of this programme is natural language understanding. More recent projects of a similar nature, such as projects in the United Kingdom's ALVEY programme and Europe's ESPRIT programme have added further developments to this important field. This paper presents a review of some of the natural language processing techniques used within speech understanding systems. In particular, techniques for handling syntactic, semantic and pragmatic information are discussed. They are integrated into SUS's as knowledge sources. The most common application of these systems is to provide an interface to a database. The system has to perform a dialogue with a user who is generally unknown to the system. Typical examples are train and <b>aeroplane</b> timetable enquiry <b>systems,</b> travel management systems and document retrieval systems...|$|R
40|$|At the {{beginning}} of our Age of Information, the 21 th century, the influence of IT (Information Technology) got so important that all parts of human live and society where involved. Especially Media Industry started a great hype which is not finished till now. Mobile Media have got a really up to date part of especially young society. On the level of serious science it has been up to date to use the word Information in all reports and publishing papers. A lot of semantics have been used and some scientists (Prof. FLEISSNER, Prof HOFKIRCHNER, Prof. CAPURRO and the author) tried to abstract this word to a constant scientific term. So for first time the author tried a worldwide unifying definition of the terms Information and Data. It’s importance is documented by the topic “Information Scientific Axioms”. In second part – based on it – Clues for generally evidence of Information are written down. They are a set of informationscientific terms - excerpted out of real nature and society. The way of Information between Object and Subject or involving Human Being in big and complex machine <b>systems</b> (<b>aeroplanes,</b> ships and industrial productions) made it necessary to think additionally about the general usage of Information. As a useful result many relationships to other sciences are possible. They bring the benefit to be unifying and scientifically worldwide structuring. As next research object general forms of actual Information are investigated. As final result for future the author asks: „How can we make Information – in all forms – more positive and precious for Human Being? “. This is a new, scientific topic for the future of IT and human society...|$|R
40|$|Software {{is a major}} {{worldwide}} industry. Software pervades {{a multitude}} of products and is an important corporate asset, with demand still increasing. Without software, most organizations could not survive in the current marketplace, and both the impact of software on everybody’s life and our dependence on software is rapidly increasing. Everyone uses software nowadays. We find software embedded, for example, in watches, coffee machines, cars, televisions, <b>aeroplanes,</b> phones, reservation <b>systems,</b> and medical equipment. It cannot, however, be denied that software engineering is still a discipline with much potential for improvement. Software projects are characterized by schedule and budget overruns, and the delivery of unreliable, and difficult to maintain, software products. A relatively unexplored area {{in the field of}} software management is the implementation or release decision, deciding whether or not a software product can be transferred from its development phase to operational use. Many software manufacturers have difficulty in determining the ‘right’ moment to release their software products. It is a trade-off between an early release, to capture the benefits of an earlier market introduction, and the deferral of product release, to enhance functionality, or improve quality. A release decision is a trade-off where, in theory, the objective is to maximize the economic value. Inputs into the release decision are expected cash inflows and outflows if the product is released. When should a product be released? What is the market window? What are the expectations of customers and end-users? A release decision deals with the difficulty of verifying the correct implementation of functional and non-functional requirements. How much testing is needed? Software manufacturers are challenged to find the optimal level of information, as information has its price in cost and time. The decision-making process to release a product will normally involve different stakeholders, who will not necessarily have the same preferences for the decision outcome. This means elements of individual and group behaviour are likely to surface when discussing a release decision to find a satisfactory consensus. A decision is only considered successful if there is congruence between the expected outcome and the actual outcome, which sets requirements for decision implementation. In this research project these different perspectives are reviewed, explored in-depth, both from a theoretical and from an empirical point of view, by studying practical examples. The results are used in a proposed methodology to improve strategic software release decisions, characterized by the existence of large prospective financial loss outcomes, including the presence of high costs for reversing a decision. Based on validation results in a practical setting, it is concluded that this methodology has a descriptive and a judgmental character, and can therefore support understanding, analysing, assessing and improving the capability of software manufacturers in this problematic area. ...|$|R
