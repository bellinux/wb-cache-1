5|$|Aboriginal {{people are}} thought to have {{inhabited}} the Riverina for at least 40,000 years. The Wiradjuri people were the original inhabitants of much of south western New South Wales including much of the Riverina region along the Murrumbidgee and Lachlan rivers. Other groups living along the Murrumbidgee included the Nari-Nari on the western plains where the town of Hay, the Muthi-Muthi along the Lowbidgee, Gurendji and the Yida-Yida of Oxley. Along both sides of the Murray River lived the Yorta Yorta people inhabiting the area of the Riverina as far east <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> day city of Albury and as far north as the Finley and Deniliquin districts. The Murray was also home to other groups such as the Bangerang, Baraba-Baraba, Wemba-Wemba, Wadi-Wadi, Dadi-Dadi and Paarkantji communities.|$|E
5|$|Early {{plans for}} the Interstate Highway System include a route along roughly the same {{alignment}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> I-35 through the Twin Cities area, but are not detailed enough to show exactly how the cities would be served. When preliminary urban routes were laid out in 1955, a split alignment was chosen to serve both cities equally. South of the Twin Cities, I-35 followed the corridor of old US65, which had followed Lyndale Avenue between Burnsville and downtown Minneapolis. I-35E was located parallel to MN13, which cut northeast to Saint Paul from old US65 south of the Minnesota River. North of the metropolitan area, I-35 closely paralleled US61, which passed through Saint Paul; I-35W paralleled old US8 from Minneapolis northeast through New Brighton {{and then to the}} present day I-35E–I-35W split at Columbus near Forest Lake, near where old US8 had joined US61. The Minnesota Legislature defined I-35E as part of unmarked Legislative Route390, which stretched south to the Iowa state line and north to the city of Duluth along I-35.|$|E

25|$|Designed by Richardson, {{the church}} was erected in 1884–1886 and built by Henry Shenk. The {{original}} plans were for a stone building of {{about the same size}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> church, but with central-tower theme, similar to the Trinity Church in Boston. The cost estimate of $25,000 was too high, and the congregation rejected the plans. The new budget was $12,000 and plans for the smaller brick church were approved.|$|E
25|$|When {{the large}} landmass of the Australian {{continent}} developed a drier and harsher climate, {{this type of}} forest was reduced to those boundaries areas. Although some remnants of archaic rich flora still persisted in coastal mountains and sheltered sites, their biodiversity were reduced. In times of high sea level such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> era, Tasmania as an island, has a climate moderated by the Southern and Pacific Oceans and maintained relatively humid and high rainfall, which has allowed these communities to persist to the present day.|$|E

25|$|There is also {{reason to}} believe that the rate on {{shingles}} can be materially advanced without affecting the tonnage, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> low price of the shingles is brought about wholly by local competition. It was not possible, however, to obtain a higher rate, except by concurrence of the Great Northern, which could not heretofore be obtained, on account of James Jerome Hill persistent effort to reduce the gross and net earnings of our system in order to facilitate his plans.|$|E
25|$|Sometime before 1896, the twenty-three {{northern}} spans {{were replaced}} with a longer structure consisting of 105 timber spans varying from 4.6 m to 9.14 m long, crossing the full width of the floodplain. In that year a ramp was installed {{on the western side}} of the bridge six spans north of the three main spans, in roughly the same location <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> ramp, in order to divert traffic from the timber approach spans, presumably because of maintenance problems with these spans.|$|E

25|$|The {{first two}} lighthouses in Lowestoft {{were built in}} 1609 on the {{foreshore}} and candlelit, to give warning of the dangerous sandbanks around the coast. These were the first lighthouses constructed by Trinity House. The Low Light was discontinued in 1706 following sea encroachment, but re-established in 1730 {{in a form that}} could be easily moved in response to further changes to the Stamford Channel and shoreline. It was finally discontinued in August 1923. The High Light tower was rebuilt <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> lighthouse in 1874 with the intention of displaying an electric light, but when opened paraffin oil was used instead; it was not until 1936 that it was electrified. The lighthouse, along with two cottages originally used by lighthouse keepers, is a Grade II listed building.|$|E
25|$|Category (c): {{substantive}} {{legitimate expectation}} – promise having {{the character of}} a contract. The third form manifests itself when a public authority's promise or practice has resulted in a legitimate expectation of a substantive benefit or a particular outcome of a situation. This type of case is likely to arise when the promise is confined to a few individuals, and thus has {{the character of a}} contract. For situations in this third category, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> case, the court must determine whether frustration of the expectation would be so unfair as to amount to an abuse of power by the authority. Unless sufficient justification is present, the authority is obliged to act in accordance with what is legitimately expected of it.|$|E

40|$|Facial palsy <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>presenting</b> {{symptom of}} leukemia is very rare, {{especially}} in acute myeloid leukemia.

Achieving a remission without WBI, the patients underwent stem cell transplantations (SCTs). Two patients remain event-free 52 months and 62 months after allotransplants. Facial palsy was the harbinger of leukemic relapse in one case after autotransplant. This patient is disease-free 59 months after unrelated SCT rescue. Facial palsy persisted in 2 cases.

25|$|Actuarial science {{became a}} formal {{mathematical}} {{discipline in the}} late 17th century with the increased demand for long-term insurance coverage such as burial, life insurance, and annuities. These long term coverage required that money be set aside to pay future benefits, such as annuity and death benefits many years into the future. This requires estimating future contingent events, such as the rates of mortality by age, {{as well as the}} development of mathematical techniques for discounting the value of funds set aside and invested. This {{led to the development of}} an important actuarial concept, referred to <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> value of a future sum. Certain aspects of the actuarial methods for discounting pension funds have come under criticism from modern financial economics.|$|E
25|$|Elizabethton (at Sycamore Shoals) was the Fort Watauga {{site of the}} Transylvania Purchase. In March 1775, land {{speculator}} and North Carolina judge Richard Henderson {{met with}} more than 1,200 Cherokees at Sycamore Shoals, including Cherokee leaders such as Attacullaculla, Oconostota, and Dragging Canoe. In the Treaty of Sycamore Shoals (also known as the Treaty of Watauga), Henderson purchased all the land lying between the Cumberland River, the Cumberland Mountains, and the Kentucky River, and situated south of the Ohio River. The land thus delineated, 20 million acres (81,000km²), encompassed an area half as large <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> state of Kentucky. Henderson's purchase was in violation of North Carolina and Virginia law, {{as well as the}} Royal Proclamation of 1763, which prohibited private purchase of American Indian land. Henderson may have mistakenly believed that a newer British legal opinion had made such land purchases legal.|$|E
25|$|Both of MD 197's freeway {{interchanges}} {{have evolved}} {{since they were}} constructed in the 1950s and 1960s. The highway's original interchange with US 50, a four-ramp partial cloverleaf with a loop from eastbound US 50, was completed in 1965. A ramp was added from eastbound US 50 to southbound MD 197 in 1977. The interchange was rebuilt <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> six-ramp partial cloverleaf in 1990 and 1991 {{in conjunction with the}} expansion of both highways in Bowie. MD 197's original interchange with the Baltimore–Washington Parkway, which opened in 1954, was a diamond interchange in which the ramp from MD 197 to the southbound parkway served as the eastern terminus of Muirkirk Road. Muirkirk Road was relocated to its present terminus north of the parkway in 1993. MD 197's present interchange with the Baltimore–Washington Parkway, including the new southbound lanes of MD 197 and the flyover ramp from the northbound parkway to northbound MD 197, was constructed in 2001 and 2002.|$|E

25|$|To {{serve the}} need for {{activities}} with Philips employees, the company founded its own football team in 1910: the Philips Elftal. Its ground was the Philips Sportpark, located on the same location <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> day stadium. Financial turmoil and worker strikes led to a quick demise of the team and in 1913, its successor emerged, Philips Sport Vereniging, founded on 31 August. It was the day that Philips organized celebrations and sports competitions {{in light of the}} centennial defeat of the French in the Napoleonic Wars. It was not until 1916, however, that the football department switched its name from Philips Elftal to PSV. Because of World War I, the first possibility to enter a league was in the 1915–16 season. The club's first ever match was a 3–2 defeat against Willem II Reserves on 19 September 1915. The team did achieve promotion that season to a newly created Third Division of the Brabantian FA. Under the guidance of coach Wout Buitenweg, PSV were promoted in 1918 and 1921 as well, eventually reaching the Eerste Klasse. The team was relegated in 1925, but its stint in the Second Division only lasted one year when PSV were promoted again. Since 1926, PSV has always played in the highest possible domestic league.|$|E
25|$|When such a {{complete}} convulsion has shaken the State, and hardly left any thing whatsoever, either in civil arrangements, {{or in the}} Characters and disposition of men's minds, exactly where it was, whatever shall be settled although in the former persons and upon old forms, will be in some measure a new thing and will labour under something of the weakness {{as well as other}} inconveniences of a Change. My poor opinion is that you mean to establish what you call 'L'ancien Régime,' If any one means that system of Court Intrigue miscalled a Government as it stood, at Versailles before the present confusions as the thing to be established, that I believe will be found absolutely impossible; and if you consider the Nature, as well of persons, as of affairs, I flatter myself you must be of my opinion.
