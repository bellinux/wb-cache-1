A week before Opening Day he was called into Manager Buck Showalter's office. But instead of telling Feldman he had made the team, for the first 10 minutes Showalter and the team's pitching coach Mark Connor spoke on <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>about</b> how Feldman had had a solid spring training — but needed to work on some things. Feldman couldn't believe it but eventually thought, [...] "Holy smoke, I’m going down [...]" [...] Suddenly, unable to continue the prank any longer, Showalter burst out laughing: [...] "Pack your bags, rookie, you’re coming with us!" ...|$|E
500|$|Writer Bill Oakley {{suggested}} the episode's barbecue scenes. Cohen's first draft contained a more philosophical argument between Lisa and Homer about eating meat, but Oakley told Cohen {{that the story}} needed something more specific {{to serve as the}} basis of Homer and Lisa's dispute. George Meyer, a writer known among the staff for his [...] "bizarre physical jokes", contributed the idea of the barbecue pig getting caught in the spillway and flying into the air. Cohen credits writer John Swartzwelder for inspiring the scene in which Homer finds it impossible to believe that bacon, ham, and pork chops could possibly come from the same animal. [...] According to Cohen it was based on a real statement made by Swartzwelder, who was going on <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>about</b> how amazing the pig is for the variety of cuts of meat that come from it.|$|E

The influence of death metal on the album is clear, and on the subject Jordison stated; [...] "the roots are death metal, thrash, speed metal, and I could go on <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>about</b> all those bands."

Slipknot also includes melody, most notably in the single [...] "Wait and Bleed".|$|E

While reviewing Femme Fatale, Alexis Petridis of The Guardian noted Spears [...] "does what pop stars invariably do {{in lieu of}} having a detectable character of their own: goes on <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>about</b> sex", while commenting that [...] "after a while, {{you get the feeling}} the lyricists just gave up trying in the face of her indifference: 'You got me kind of hot … Steaming like a pot full of vegetables,' she sings, which somehow makes you think not of thrillingly sweaty congress but the smell of boiled cabbage." [...] Contemporary critic Robert Christgau noted the songs on the album are [...] "such a convincing illusion that any guy who goes all the way with it has too much libido invested in the bimbo fantasy", saying that the singer is [...] "just too straight-faced" [...] on [...] "the nauseous 'Your body look so sick I think I got the flu'". A reviewer of Samesame.com.au compared the background vocals of the song to Kesha's [...] "Blow" [...] (2010), and noted [...] "guest rapper Sabi wish she was Nicki Minaj".

Wilson reported in 1967, [...] "I want to turn people on to vegetables, good natural food, organic food. Health is an important element in spiritual enlightenment. But I do not want to be pompous about it, so we will engage in a satirical approach."

2500|$|The {{overwhelmingly}} positive British {{response to}} the film led to its critical and commercial success throughout Europe. Derek Malcolm of Cosmopolitan wrote, [...] " [...] is fast {{becoming one of the}} cult movies of the year ... The great virtue of the film is the way it grabs hold of its audience and simply refuses to let go. It exploits all our fears of irrational violence and unmotivated attack, {{and at the same time}} manages to laugh at itself without spoiling the tension - a very considerable feat. Carpenter, who is clearly a director with places to go, has succeeded in making a comedy that scares the pants off us. And don't think you're laughing at it. As a matter of fact, it's laughing at you." [...] Malcolm later wrote that he held some reservations about the film: [...] "I don't feel like going on <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>about</b> the movie, partly because I think it is in grave danger of being oversold anyway, and partly because it isn't much more to me than tremendous fun". The film broke one house record in the UK and was named one of the best films of the year by critics and moviegoers.|$|E
2500|$|British rock critic Nick Kent wrote that, {{sometime}} in the mid-1960s: [...] "Wilson began getting wrapped up in big complicated ideas like 'Art' and 'Civilization'. People would tell him the most commonplace facts about such-and-such a composer or painter and Brian would just flip right out ... A visitor would read a fragment from a volume of Omar Khayyam and Brian Wilson would leap up, his head just awash with all this magical dumb inspiration, screaming 'Wow' and 'Too much' {{over and over again}} because he sensed right there and then that this guy had access to all the answers to the problems besetting our troubled universe. According to unnamed participants of the Smile sessions, [...] "If you came up to the house and introduced something new to Brian's thought processes–astrology, a different way to think about the relationship of Russia to China, anything at all–if {{all of a sudden he}} was into that, it would find its way into the music. You could hear a bit and say, 'I know where that feeling came from.'" [...] Tony Asher remembers that Wilson [...] "exhibit this awful taste. His choice of movies, say, was invariably terrible. ... every four hours we'd spend writing songs, there'd be about 48 hours of these dopey conversations about some dumb book he'd just read. Or else he'd just go on <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>about</b> girls." ...|$|E
2500|$|Asher {{explains}} that he and Wilson had many lengthy, intimate discussions centered around their [...] "experiences and feelings about women and the various stages of relationships and so forth". He maintains that his contribution to the music itself was minimal, serving mainly {{as a source of}} second opinion for Wilson as he worked out possible melodies and chord progressions, although the two did trade ideas as the songs evolved. On his role as co-lyricist, Asher clarified, [...] "The general tenor of the lyrics was always his... and the actual choice of words was usually mine. I was really just his interpreter." [...] While speaking about [...] "God Only Knows", Wilson reflected: [...] "I think Tony had a musical influence on me somehow. After about ten years, I started thinking about it deeper... because I had never written that kind of song. And I remember him talking about 'Stella by Starlight' and he had a certain love for classic songs." [...] A typical writing session would either start with Wilson playing melody or chord patterns that he'd been working on, by discussing a recent record that Wilson liked the feel of, or by discussing a subject that Wilson had always wanted to write a song about. Asher called his interactions with Wilson and the Beach Boys an [...] "embarrassing" [...] experience, and that Wilson [...] "exhibit this awful taste. His choice of movies, say, was invariably terrible. ... every four hours we'd spend writing songs, there'd be about 48 hours of these dopey conversations about some dumb book [...] he'd just read. Or else he'd just go on <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>about</b> girls." ...|$|E
