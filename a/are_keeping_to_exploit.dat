After the first years, there was a slackening in growth, despite the employment <b>was</b> <b>keeping</b> <b>to</b> increase, condition often labelled in the literature as growthless job creation (e.g. Boeri and Garibaldi 2007 a). Finally, there was a realignment of the unemployment rate towards the pre-reform level.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Aesthetics feature fascinates mathematician. Since ancient times, the Golden Ratio (φ) has <b>been</b> <b>keeping</b> <b>to</b> give a {{profound}} influence in various fields. We will show typical dynamic programming problems: Allocation problem, Linear-Quadratic control problem and Multi-variate stopping problem. For these problems, there appears the Golden Ratio in {{the solution of}} Bellman equation. This paper also considers a minimization problem of quadratic functions over an infinite horizon. We show that the Golden trajectory is optimal in the optimization. The Golden optimal trajectory is obtained through the corresponding Bellman equation, which in turn admits the Golden optimal policy. For Multi-variate stopping problem with three players on the unit interval [0, 1], its related expected value could be obtained as φ − 1...|$|R
