500|$|Moore is {{particularly}} known for playing troubled women, and specializes in [...] "ordinary women who suppress powerful emotions". Oliver Burkeman of The Guardian writes that her characters are typically [...] "struggling to maintain <b>a</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>on</b> normality {{in the face}} of some secret anguish or creeping awareness of failure". Suzie Mackenzie, also of The Guardian, has identified a theme of [...] "characters in a state of alienation... women who have forgotten or lost themselves. People whose identity is a question." [...] Her performances often include small hints at emotional turmoil, until there comes a point when the character breaks. The journalist Kira Cochrane has identified this as a [...] "trademark moment" [...] in many of her best films, while it has led Burkeman to call her the [...] "queen of the big-screen breakdown". [...] "When she does finally crack," [...] writes journalist Simon Hattenstone, [...] "it's a sight to behold: nobody sobs from the soul quite like Moore." [...] Ben Brantley of The New York Times has praised Moore's ability to subtly reveal the inner-turmoil of her characters, writing that she is [...] "peerless" [...] in her [...] "portraits of troubled womanhood." [...] When it comes to more authoritative roles, Brantley believes she is [...] "a bit of a bore". [...] "Emotional nakedness is Ms. Moore's specialty," [...] he says, [...] "and it's here that you sense the magic she is capable of." ...|$|E

60|$|It was {{my first}} idea to light up and be getting homeward; for the {{darkness}} and the glimmer of the dead wood and {{the shadows of the}} lantern made me lonely. But I knew where one of the harps hung; it seemed a pity it shouldn't go with the rest; {{and at the same time}} I couldn't help letting on to myself that I was mortal tired of my employment, and would like best to be at home and have the door shut. I stepped out of the cellar and argued it fore and back. There was a sound of the sea far down below me on the coast; nearer hand not a leaf stirred; I might have been the only living creature this side of Cape Horn. Well, as I stood there thinking, it seemed the bush woke and became full of little noises. Little noises they were, and nothing to hurt--a bit of a crackle, a bit of a rush--but the breath jumped right out of me and my throat went as dry as a biscuit. It wasn't Case I was afraid of, which would have been common-sense; I never thought of Case; what took me, as sharp as the colic, was the old wives' tales, the devil-women and the man-pigs. It was the toss of a penny whether I should run: but I got <b>a</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>on</b> myself, and stepped out, and held up the lantern (like a fool) and looked all round.|$|E

5000|$|The first room, called Impregnation, is {{approximately}} 50 m² {{and filled with}} a number of everyday, domestic objects in a variety of different shades of red. The effect is an overwhelming visual saturation of the color. Upon entering the room, the participant experiences an initial shock from the visual inundation of red. Dan Cameron writes that [...] "one's gaze is literally thwarted in an effort to gain <b>a</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>on</b> the specificity of things."
