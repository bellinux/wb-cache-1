40|$|This paper reports an {{innovative}} method based on electrochemistry {{to adjust the}} pH in nutrient solutions used in hydroponics. The required quantity of H+ or OH- ions is produced in-situ through electrolytic water decomposition. Because the direction and rate of electrochemical reactions can be easily manipulated by controlling the polarity and voltage applied between electrodes, the most important advantage of this method in comparison to traditional pH control using chemicals is the possibility to accomplish accurate and reliable pH control to within a narrow, preset pH range. Moreover, additional positive effects of {{improving the quality of}} added raw water such as alkalinity control, reducing the concentration of sodium, and water disinfection can be accomplished in the same electrolytic unit. Electrochemical technology offers possibilities to eliminate the risk of pH control failures due to overdoses and excludes the necessity of having reagent (<b>acid</b> and base) <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> and of handling these hazardous materials. Important savings of reagents, dosage and mixing equipment, <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> and improved environment and safety objectives can be realized.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{is to get a}} better {{understanding}} of how optimal weight savings of the cylindrical shell plates in <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> can be reached using higher strength duplex material. The design criteria will be based on the requirements given by the American Petroleum Institute standards API 650 for welded <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> and API 12 B for bolted <b>storage</b> <b>tanks.</b> The expected result is that use of duplex stainless steel instead of austenitic stainless steel can reduce the weight of the material needed to build a <b>storage</b> <b>tank.</b> A comparison between welded and bolted <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> will also be included in the work to find which joining method that is preferable. Additionally, an evaluation of the software TANKTM by Intergraph will be performed. Matlab® will be used in order to perform the evaluation to compare the results. The main difference between the standards API 650 and API 12 B is that there are already given standard sizes of bolted <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> API 12 B. Therefore, only <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> up to 1   625 m 3 could be compared. When comparing <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> sizes up to 1   625 m 3 the result is that bolted <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> require a smaller mean thickness of the cylindrical shell than welded <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> and therefore less material and total weight of the shell. If the trend continues also for larger <b>tank</b> sizes, bolted <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> will be preferable to reduce the total weight of the <b>storage</b> <b>tank.</b> By use of duplex stainless steel instead of austenitic stainless steel in <b>storage</b> <b>tanks,</b> the minimum required thickness can be reduced because of the higher strength of duplex stainless steel. This leads to a smaller mean shell thickness and therefore a reduced weight compared to <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> made of austenitic stainless steel. For most dimensions of <b>storage</b> <b>tanks,</b> duplex stainless steel is cheaper than austenitic stainless steel, but for some smaller dimensions, grade 1. 4307 (austenitic) is cheaper than LDX 2101 ® (duplex). Instability calculations have been performed for welded <b>storage</b> <b>tanks,</b> while no instability calculations have been performed for bolted <b>storage</b> <b>tanks.</b> With the wind speed 190 km/h (proposed by API 650), the welded <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> need to have wind girders to stiffen the cylindrical shell and in some cases also be anchored to the ground. Anchor is not required for large dimensions of <b>storage</b> <b>tanks.</b> The evaluation of TANKTM showed that most parameters agreed to the computed value of the same parameters in Matlab®. Why a few parameters not agrees is not fully known, therefore better explanations of the parameters used in the equations in API 650 would be preferable. To see the difference between Matlab® and TANKTM it would also be of interest to see how the calculations are performed in TANKTM, as only the results and inputs are printed at the moment...|$|R
