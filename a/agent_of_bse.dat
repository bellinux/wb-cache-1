Analysis of the epidemiological patterns in the NI epidemic reveals significant clustering of cases in herds and counties. The observed clustering of cases within herds results in lower per capita incidence of BSE in previously unaffected herds, providing support for {{the introduction of a}} certified herd scheme in NI. By fitting a backcalculation model to the case data, we can estimate the number of animals infected with the aetiological <b>agent</b> <b>of</b> <b>BSE</b> and project the number of future cases. We predict that the epidemic will decline rapidly, with approximately 99 cases (95 % confidence interval 30, 504) occurring in the five year period 1997 - 2001...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} whether a calf {{born to a}} dam that develops bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) (prior or subsequent to the birth) is itself at an enhanced risk of developing BSE. Analyses utilize the main database on reported BSE cases in the British cattle herd maintained by the Central Veterinary Laboratory in Weybridge to trace the dams of BSE-affected animals born following the ruminant feed ban in July 1988. The data reveal a significantly enhanced risk of disease in calves born to BSE-affected dams, with the risk being greatest when birth occurs after the onset of clinical signs of disease in the dam. The dependence of the maternally enhanced risk on the maternal incubation stage at birth argues for a significant component of direct maternal transmission of the aetiological <b>agent</b> <b>of</b> <b>BSE,</b> and offers little support for the hypothesis of genetic predisposition. Using a statistical likelihood model, we obtain estimates of the rate of direct maternal transmission by maternal incubation stage; however, biases in the available data make these values minimum estimates...|$|E

40|$|We report {{transmission}} of atypical L-type {{bovine spongiform encephalopathy}} to mouse lemurs after oral or intracerebral inoculation with infected bovine brain tissue. After neurologic symptoms appeared, transmissibility of the disease by both inoculation routes was confirmed by detection of disease-associated prion protein in samples of brain tissue. Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, also known as prion diseases, are fatal neurodegenerative disorders that affect humans and animals. An atypical form of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) was recently identified in cattle in Europe (1, 2), North America (3), and Japan (4). This atypical BSE was designated L-type BSE (L-BSE) because Western blot analysis showed that the disease-associated protease-resistant prion protein (PrPres) was of lower apparent molecular mass than in the <b>agent</b> <b>of</b> classical <b>BSE,</b> which {{is involved in the}} major foodborne epizooty in cattle and in variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans (5).

40|$|Abstract Background Transmission of the {{prion disease}} bovine spongiform {{encephalopathy}} (BSE) occurred accidentally to cattle and several other mammalian species via feed supplemented with meat and bone meal contaminated with infected bovine tissue. Prior to United Kingdom controls in 1996 on the feeding of mammalian meat and bone meal to farmed animals, the domestic chicken was potentially exposed to feed contaminated with the causal <b>agent</b> <b>of</b> <b>BSE.</b> Although confirmed prion diseases are unrecorded in avian species a study was undertaken to transmit BSE to the domestic chicken by parenteral and oral inoculations. Transmissibility was assessed by clinical monitoring, histopathological examinations, detection of a putative disease form of an avian prion protein (PrP) in recipient tissues and by mouse bioassay of tissues. Occurrence of a progressive neurological syndrome in the primary transmission study was investigated by sub-passage experiments. Results No clinical, pathological or bioassay evidence of transmission of BSE to the chicken was obtained in the primary or sub-passage experiments. Survival data showed {{no significant differences between}} control and treatment groups. Neurological signs observed, not previously described in the domestic chicken, were not associated with significant pathology. The diagnostic techniques applied failed to detect a disease associated form of PrP. Conclusion Important from a risk assessment perspective, the present study has established that the domestic chicken does not develop a prion disease after large parenteral exposures to the BSE agent or after oral exposures equivalent to previous exposures via commercial diets. Future investigations into the potential susceptibility of avian species to mammalian prion diseases require species-specific immunochemical techniques and more refined experimental models. </p...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn France, {{implementation}} of systematic screening programs in 2000, as a complement to the mandatory reporting of animals with clinical signs of BSE (passive surveillance), revealed certain {{limitations of the}} mandatory system. Indeed, systematic screening showed that some BSE cases were not detected by the clinical surveillance system, implying considerable BSE case under-reporting throughout the epidemic. As the most likely explanation for variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) is exposure to the aetiologic <b>agent</b> <b>of</b> <b>BSE,</b> {{it is essential to}} reconstruct the French BSE epidemic pattern accounting for this under-reporting. We estimated age- and year-specific incidence rates of BSE by using a back-calculation method. This approach relies on the principle that the number of clinical BSE cases is the consequence of the number of BSE-infected animals after a known incubation time, defined as the time between infection and clinical onset. We generalized this model to take into account epidemiological characteristics of BSE, such as French cattle mortality, BSE case reporting probability, and age-dependent susceptibility and/or exposure to the BSE agent. We confirmed that the average BSE incubation period is five years and that the peak risk of bovine infection occurs between 6 and 12 months of age. The results also showed that the proportion of underreporting is the most influential parameter in the model, and that BSE was substantially underreported until rapid tests were introduced. Indeed, only 103 BSE cases were detected by passive surveillance up to June 2000, while we estimated that there was 301 200 (95 % confidence interval (CI) [27 600 - 837 600]) cattle infected by the BSE agent. Despite uncertainty over the beginning of the epidemic, we showed that the French BSE epidemic in the late 1980 s was completely undetected, and only the second wave, after 1990, was observed...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Breast {{cancer is}} the most common cancer among women worldwide, and it can be {{detected}} at an early stage through self-examination which increases the chance of survival. This study aimed to assess knowledge and practice <b>of</b> breast self-examination (<b>BSE)</b> among females in a rural area of Trichy district. Methodology: This community-based, cross-sectional study was carried out among a total sample of 200 women in rural area of Trichy. The participants were interviewed using a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire to obtain information on their sociodemographic characteristics, awareness on breast cancer, and knowledge, attitude, practice <b>of</b> <b>BSE.</b> Data were entered into MS Excel and analyzed using SPSS version 20. 0. Spearman correlation and Chi-square test were used to analyze the association between the variables. Results: The mean age of the study group was 36. 9 ± 8. 8 years. Eighty percent were literates. Most of the women 178 (89 %) were aware of breast cancer.

40|$|This {{study used}} the Health Belief Model (HBM) to examine attitudes about breast health among {{women who had}} participated in the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial. More specifically, {{the purpose of this study}} was to {{identify}} the relationship between the HBM variables and the frequency <b>of</b> breast self-examination (<b>BSE).</b> A convenience sample of 80 women completed Champion’s (1993) HBM questionnaire. It was hypothesized that the HBM concepts would significantly correlate with the frequency <b>of</b> <b>BSE.</b> However, only two significant correlations were found: a positive correlation between the frequency <b>of</b> <b>BSE</b> and perceived benefits (r=. 37; p=. 000) and a negative correlation between the frequency <b>of</b> <b>BSE</b> and perceived barriers (r=-. 41; p=. 000). Therefore, this hypothesis was not supported. A second hypothesis addressed was whether the HBM concepts could differentiate between groups <b>of</b> frequency <b>of</b> <b>BSE.</b> Using an analysis of variance, a significant difference was found between the HBM concept of barriers and the frequency <b>of</b> <b>BSE.</b> Women who perceived significant barriers to BSE performance were less likely to perform this procedure on a routine basis.
