One {{of the most widely}} used helicopter on-board-mounted condition monitoring system these days is the Health and Usage Monitoring System. It has been specifically designed to monitor the condition of all safety-critical components operating in the helicopter through calculation of so-called condition indicators (CIs) - signal processing routines designed to output a single number that represents the condition of the monitored component. <b>Among</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> available <b>parameters,</b> there is a couple of CIs that over the years of testing have earned a reputation of being the most reliable measures of the gear tooth condition. At the same time, however, it has been observed that in some cases, those techniques do not properly indicate the deteriorating condition with the propagation of a gear tooth fault with the period of operation. Hence, three more robust methods have been suggested, which are discussed in this article...|$|R

Flexography is mainly used for packaging applications, but is also a potential method for the micro manufacture of electronic devices, smart packaging and RFID. The flexographic printing process poses as an attractive candidate for printing electronics for its high speed printing capabilities where such volume and large active areas need to be printed. Therefore an investigation for its potential usage in printing electronics is highly in demand hence a research for suitable conductive ink related to this process is vital. multiple fine solid lines of high quality are essential to enable printing of ink tracks for electronic applications.

40|$|Abstract-Choosing {{the right}} analog-to-digital {{converter}} for a stated measurement application {{and for a}} stated target uncertainty {{is not an easy}} task. In fact, each time the prospective purchaser browses among the manufacturer specifications, he finds different sets <b>of</b> <b>parameters</b> which qualify the product; moreover, the same figure of merit is often defined and measured in ambiguous way. One of the main reasons which has caused this situation is the coexistent of various Standards concerning the characterization of the analog-to-digital converters. The choice of the converter becomes more difficult taking into account that the potential buyer has to deal with the measurement uncertainty. Without question, the homogeneity of the figures of merit would facilitate the measurement evaluation. Target of the paper is the choice, <b>among</b> the large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>parameters</b> proposed by the various Standards, of the optimal set of merit figures, which allows a correct uncertainty evaluation of a generic measurement performed by using an analog-to-digital converter.

40|$|Micromolar {{nitric oxide}} (NO) rapidly (ms) {{inhibits}} cytochrome c oxidase in turnover with physiological substrates. Two reaction mechanisms {{have been identified}} leading, respectively, to formation of a nitrosyl- [a 3 (2 +) -NO] or a nitrite- [a 3 (3 +) -NO 2 -] derivative of the enzyme. In the presence of O 2, the nitrosyl adduct recovers activity slowly, following NO displacement at k' approximately equal to 0. 01 s(- 1) (37 degrees C); {{the recovery of the}} nitrite adduct is much faster. Relevant to pathophysiology, the enzyme does not degrade NO by following the first mechanism, whereas by following the second one it promotes NO oxidation and disposal as nitrite/nitrate. The reaction between NO and cytochrome c oxidase has been investigated at different integration levels of the enzyme, including the in situ state, such as in mouse liver mitochondria or cultured human SY 5 Y neuroblastoma cells. The respiratory chain is inhibited by NO, either supplied exogenously or produced endogenously via the NO synthase activation. Inhibition of respiration is reversible, although it remains to be clarified whether reversibility is always full and how it depends on concentration of and time of exposure to NO. Oxygraphic measurements show that cultured cells or isolated state 4 mitochondria exposed to micromolar (or less) NO recover from NO inhibition rapidly, as if the nitrite reaction was predominant. Mitochondria in state 3 display a slightly more persistent inhibition than in state 4, possibly due to a higher accumulation of the nitrosyl adduct. <b>Among</b> a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>parameters</b> that appear to control the switch over between the two mechanisms, the concentration of reductants (reduced cytochrome c) at the cytochrome c oxidase site has been proved to be the most relevant one...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} years, many Authors {{have dealt with}} the {{uncertainty}} evaluation of the measurement performed by using an analog-to-digital converter, proposing different approaches to analyze the uncertainty propagation. However, in these studies, in order to identify the uncertainty sources, different sets <b>of</b> <b>parameters</b> are used, and, often, it is not considered that the various uncertainty sources have different modalities of propagation. Obviously, this implies that the various proposed approaches are not directly comparable. One of the main reasons which has caused this situation is the coexistent of various Standards concerning the characterization of the analog-to-digital converters. Therefore, the manufacturers of converters have got a large arbitrariness in choosing and measuring the parameters which specify the performances of their products. With the aim to overtake these limitations and to suggest a common basis, in this paper, we identify, <b>among</b> the large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>parameters</b> proposed by the various Standards, a minimum set of figures of merit which allows a correct uncertainty evaluation of a generic measurement performed by using an analog-to-digital converter.

In the formula is <b>among</b> a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> other <b>parameters</b> also the permeability of the structure represented. A more permeable structure has the ability to dissipate more water and therefore more energy, this results into a lower required weight of the armour layer. This coefficient, described as the Notional Permeability P, has been determined for three different types of structures. A homogeneous structure, a structure with a permeable core and an impermeable structure. In practice structures are being build who deviate from these standard situations. Therefore there is a demand for values of P about structures other than the known standard situations. In this thesis P values are found by means of physical scale model tests. First of all two reference structures were tested. The permeable and the impermeable structure with known values of P= 0. 5 and respectively P= 0. 1. The values found in this study are almost equal to the values above. The new structure has an impermeable core covered with a thick filter layer. On top of that an under layer is placed and finally there is a double armour layer. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

Flexography is mainly used for packaging applications, but is also a potential method for the micro manufacture of electronic devices, smart packaging and RFID. Fine solid lines of high quality are essential to enable printing of ink tracks for electronic applications. Plate characteristics are <b>among</b> a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> process <b>parameters</b> that will influence print line quality, which will affect the electrical performance of printed tracks. Deformation of the photopolymer plate is an important factor in determining the line quality. Therefore, an investigation into plate deformation is vital. A numerical model of close multiple lines has been developed and used to examine its deformation under a range of printing conditions. An Ogden constitutive model was used to describe the response of the photopolymer plate material. A series of uniaxial tension and pure shear experiments was carried out to provide mechanical properties of the photopolymer. In validation of the material model, numerical results agree well with the experimental data in both simple tension and pure shear. Numerical models were then used to determine the change in line profile, as the deformations occur on a microscopic level and cannot be assessed experimentally. The simulations yield information on line width increase due to plate deformation. However, the predicted line width is smaller than that of printed line measured using image analysis. The difference in line width is due to ink spreading and by relating the numerical results with those from the printed copy; the proportion of increase in line width due to the deformation of the printing plate has been quantified at 53 to 69 %.

Therefore, a larger <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>parameters</b> {{can be handled}} by increasing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> computational nodes.
