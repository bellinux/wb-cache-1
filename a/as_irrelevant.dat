5|$|Although Jews are an ethnoreligious group, {{they were}} {{defined by the}} Nazis on purely racial grounds. The Nazi Party viewed the Jewish {{religion}} <b>as</b> <b>irrelevant,</b> persecuting Jews in accordance with antisemitic stereotypes of an alleged biologically determined heritage. Defining Jews as the chief enemy, Nazi racial ideology was also used to persecute other minorities.|$|E
5|$|Heterodox economists {{adhere to}} {{theories}} sufficiently {{outside the mainstream}} to be marginalized and treated <b>as</b> <b>irrelevant</b> by the establishment. Initially, heterodox economists including Joan Robinson, worked alongside mainstream economists, but heterodox groups isolated themselves and created insular groups in the late 1960s and 1970s. Present day heterodox economists often publish in their own journals rather {{than those of the}} mainstream and eschew formal modeling in favor of more abstract theoretical work.|$|E

5|$|East–West {{tensions}} rapidly subsided {{through the}} mid-to-late 1980s, culminating {{with the final}} summit in Moscow in 1989, when Gorbachev and George H. W. Bush signed the START I arms control treaty. During the following year it became apparent to the Soviets that oil and gas subsidies, along {{with the cost of}} maintaining massive troops levels, represented a substantial economic drain. In addition, the security advantage of a buffer zone was recognised <b>as</b> <b>irrelevant</b> and the Soviets officially declared that they would no longer intervene in the affairs of allied states in Central and Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{opportunity}} {{to graduate from}} provincial to national politics came soon after. The Conservative prime minister Honório Hermeto Carneiro Leão, Marquis of Paraná, faced overwhelming opposition from his own party in parliament. Paraná knew that the party's principles were seen <b>as</b> <b>irrelevant</b> and ignored at local and provincial levels. A cabinet could use patronage alone to gain backing from local bosses for its national candidates, including {{in the province of}} Rio Grande do Sul. Porto Alegre was a Liberal allied to Conservatives in his province. He pledged support to Paraná and in 1857 was elected general deputy (member of the Chamber of Deputies, the national legislature's lower house). He was reelected in 1860.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In the installment, an unborn child is apparently abducted from its mother's womb by a demon after the prospective parents discover that their child has birth defects. After Agent Spender dismisses the assignment <b>as</b> <b>irrelevant</b> to the X-Files, Mulder and Scully steal the case and investigate the creature. While looking into the report, the duo discover that Wayne Weinsider (Campbell) is a child-abducting demon.|$|E

5|$|With the Burger's {{house now}} empty, Rosa sells it and moves in with Conrad, {{a student who}} had befriended her during her father's trial. Conrad {{questions}} her about {{her role in the}} Burger family and asks why she always did what she was told. Later Rosa leaves Conrad and moves into a flat on her own and works as a physiotherapist. In 1975 Rosa attends a party of a friend in Soweto, and it is there that she hears a black university student dismissing all whites' help <b>as</b> <b>irrelevant,</b> saying that whites cannot know what blacks want, and that blacks will liberate themselves. Despite being labelled a Communist and under surveillance by the authorities, Rosa manages to get a passport, and flies to Nice in France to spend several months with Katya, her father's first wife. There she meets Bernard Chabalier, a visiting academic from Paris. They become lovers and he persuades her to return with him to Paris.|$|E

25|$|The {{request for}} a {{plebiscite}} for Slovaks and Ruthenians about rejoining Hungary was refused <b>as</b> <b>irrelevant,</b> because the Munich Agreement did not address question of these two nations, because it violated the sovereignty of Czechoslovakia and because the Ruthenian delegate declared that the Ruthenian nation (except communists) had already expressed their will to live in Czechoslovakia in the past.|$|E
25|$|In {{the seventh}} century, foreign Christian missionaries {{initiated}} {{the conversion of}} Anglo-Saxon England, with repercussions for burial practices.

25|$|Rerum novarum {{provided}} new {{impetus for}} Catholics to become {{active in the}} labor movement, even if its exhortation to form specifically Catholic labor unions was widely interpreted <b>as</b> <b>irrelevant</b> to the pluralist context of the United States. While atheism underpinned many European unions and stimulated Catholic unionists to form separate labor federations, the religious neutrality of unions in the U.S. provided no such impetus. American Catholics seldom dominated unions, but they exerted influence across organized labor. Catholic union members and leaders played important roles in steering American unions away from socialism.|$|E
25|$|Kabila's forces {{launched}} an offensive in March 1997 {{and demanded that}} the Kinshasa government surrender. On 27 March the rebels took Kasenga. The government denied the rebels' success, starting a long pattern of false statements from the Defense Minister as to the progress and conduct of the war. Negotiations were proposed in late March, and on 2 April a new Prime Minister of Zaire, Étienne Tshisekedi—a longtime rival of Mobutu—was installed. Kabila, by this point in control of roughly one-quarter of the country, dismissed this <b>as</b> <b>irrelevant</b> and warned Tshisekedi {{that he would have}} no part in a new government if he accepted the post.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time, nationalistic ferments in Calcutta, the then {{capital of the}} British Empire in South Asia, social {{instability}} in Bengal, coupled with British influence through Christian and Victorian sensibilities contributed to a portrayal of the hitherto popular worship of Radha-Krishna and Caitanya Mahaprabhu <b>as</b> <b>irrelevant</b> and deeply immoral. The growing public disapproval of Gaudiya Vaishnavism was aggravated by the prevalently lower social status of local Gaudiya Vaishnavas, {{as well as by}} erotic practices of tantrics such as the sahajiyas, who claimed close affiliation with the mainstream Gaudiya school. These negative perceptions led to the slow decline of Vaishnava culture and pilgrimage sites in Bengal such as Nabadwip, the birthplace of Caitanya.|$|E
25|$|The true reason, then, why Hegelism {{can give}} {{no reason for}} the Time-process, i.e. {{for the fact that}} the world is 'in time,' and changes continuously, is that it was {{constructed}} to give an account of the world irrespective of time and change. If you insist on having a system of eternal and immutable 'truth,' you can get it only by abstracting from those characteristics of reality, which we try to express by the terms individuality, time, and change. But you must pay the price for a formula that will enable you to make assertions that hold good far beyond the limits of your experience. And it is part of the price that you will in the end be unable to give a rational explanation of those very characteristics, which you dismissed at the outset <b>as</b> <b>irrelevant</b> to a rational explanation.|$|E
25|$|There were no written {{records of}} wolf attacks on humans {{prior to the}} European {{colonization}} of the Americas, though the oral history of some Indigenous American tribes confirms that wolves occasionally did kill humans. Tribes living in woodlands feared wolves more than their tundra-dwelling counterparts, as they could encounter wolves suddenly and at close quarters. Skepticism among North American scientists over the alleged ferocity of wolves began when Canadian biologist Doug Clark investigated historical wolf attacks in Europe and, based on his own experiences with the relatively timid wolves of the Canadian wilderness, concluded that all historical attacks were perpetrated by rabid animals, and that healthy wolves posed no threat to humans. Although his findings were later criticized for failing to distinguish between rabid and predatory attacks, {{and the fact that}} the historical literature contained instances of people surviving the attacks at a time when there was no rabies vaccine, his conclusions were nonetheless adopted by other North American biologists. This view subsequently gained popularity among laypeople with the publication of Farley Mowat's semi-fictional 1963 book Never Cry Wolf, with the language barrier hindering the collection of further data on wolf attacks elsewhere. Although some North American biologists were aware of wolf attacks in Eurasia, they dismissed them <b>as</b> <b>irrelevant</b> to North American wolves.|$|E
