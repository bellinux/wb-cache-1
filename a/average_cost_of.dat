5|$|In a {{departure}} {{from one of the}} F-16's original raison d'etre recent costs for both new and refurbished aircraft have risen significantly from its 1998 fly-away cost of $18.8 million. In 2011, Iraq ordered 18 F-16IQ (Block 52) for $3 billion, an <b>average</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> $165 million per unit. In 2014, the United Arab Emirates ordered 30 F-16s Block 60 aircraft with the <b>average</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> $200 million. In 2017, Romania purchased 12 refurbished used F-16A/Bs from Portugal for a total of €628 million, roughly $680 million, an <b>average</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> $56 million. This cost led the Polish deputy minister for national defence Bartosz Kownacki to counsel against buying used F-16s, saying that buying a new F-35 would be better value. In March 2017, the US government released plans to sell 19 new F-16s with 23 engines, radars, and armament to Bahrain for total cost of $4.867 billion.|$|E

During our research we have surveyed the data of 1969 sows in a Hungarian large-scale pig farm.

For the quantification of death intensity we applied another survival analysis model, the log-rate exponential model.

5|$|As more middle-class and {{affluent}} people {{fled the}} city to the relative quiet and open spaces of the suburbs, the urban centers deteriorated and lost population. At the same time that cities were experiencing a lower tax base due to the flight of higher income earners, pressures from The New Deal forced them to offer pensions and other benefits, increasing the <b>average</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> benefits per employee by 1,629percent. This was in addition to hiring an average of 20percent more employees to serve the ever shrinking cities. More Americans were driving cars and fewer were using public transportation, and it was not practical to extend to the suburbs. At the same time, the number of surface roads exploded to serve the ever-increasing numbers of individually owned cars, further burdening city and country resources. During this time, the perception of using public transportation turned more negative. In what is arguably the most extreme example, Detroit, the fifth largest city in the United States in 1950 with 1,849,568 residents, had shrunk to 706,585 by 2010, a reduction of 62 percent.|$|E

40|$|A {{randomized}} controlled trial {{was performed to}} examine the cost-effectiveness of external hip protectors {{in the prevention of}} hip fractures. Since the hip protectors were not effective in preventing hip fractures in our study, the main objective became to examine whether the use of hip protectors results in lower <b>average</b> <b>costs</b> per participant in the hip protector group as compared with the control group. In addition, the <b>average</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> a hip fracture and subsequent rehabilitation in frail, institutionalized elderly were calculated. Residents from apartment houses for the elderly, homes for the elderly and nursing homes with a high risk for hip fractures were randomized to the hip protector group (n = 276) or control group (n = 285). Costs were calculated for the hip fracture and subsequent rehabilitation until 1 year after the fracture. Six months after each hip fracture, a nurse was interviewed and after 12 months, a questionnaire was sent to the general practitioner or nursing home physician to determine the utilization of health care resources. Differences in costs between the groups were analyzed using non-parametric bootstrapping. Eighteen hip fractures occurred in the intervention group and 20 hip fractures (in 19 persons) in the control group (log rank P-value = 0. 86). The <b>average</b> <b>costs</b> per participant, including the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> the intervention, were € 913 in the intervention group and 502 in the control group (<b>cost</b> difference <b>of</b> €- 411; 95 % confidence interval: - 723; 57). The <b>average</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> a hip fracture and subsequent rehabilitation were € 8100 (95 % CI: 6716 - 10, 010). The use of hip protectors was not associated with lower costs. In addition, the <b>average</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> a hip fracture and subsequent rehabilitation in the first year after the fracture were estimated at € 8100 in institutionalized elderly. © International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation 2004...|$|R

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of livestock futures markets continues to receive attention, {{particularly with regard}} to their forward pricing or forecasting ability. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present a more general theory that encompasses the forward pricing concept. It is argued that futures contract prices for competitively produced nonstorable commodities, such as live cattle and live hogs, follow a rational formation process. Futures contract prices reflect expected market conditions when contracts are sufficiently close to the delivery month that the supply of the underlying commodity cannot be changed. However, prior to the period when future supplies are relatively fixed, futures contract prices should adjust to reflect the competitive equilibrium, where output price equals <b>average</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> production. Presented evidence suggests that live cattle and live hog futures markets support the rational price formation hypothesis: prices for distant contracts reflect <b>average</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> feeding. Implications for risk management strategies are considered. Demand and Price Analysis, Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|R
