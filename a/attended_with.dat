In her early life, she lived in various Surrey towns, including Walton-on-Thames, Weybridge, Esher and Cobham. Her father wanted her {{to have a good}} education so, despite the family's Protestant religion, sent her to various Catholic convent schools around the county. One was St Maur's Convent School in Weybridge, which she <b>attended</b> <b>with</b> Liza Tarbuck. Ripley did not feel academically challenged there, and later declared the school mediocre.|$|E

5|$|As a young man, Lincoln was a {{religious}} skeptic, or, {{in the words}} of a biographer, an iconoclast. Later in life, Lincoln's frequent use of religious imagery and language might have reflected his own personal beliefs or might have been a device to appeal to his audiences, who were mostly evangelical Protestants. He never joined a church, although he frequently <b>attended</b> <b>with</b> his wife. However, he was deeply familiar with the Bible, and he both quoted and praised it. He was private about his beliefs and respected the beliefs of others. Lincoln never made a clear profession of Christian beliefs. However, he did believe in an all-powerful God that shaped events and, by 1865, was expressing those beliefs in major speeches.|$|E
5|$|At age 15, Redding {{left school}} to help financially support his family; {{his father had}} {{contracted}} tuberculosis and was often hospitalized, leaving his mother as the family's primary income earner. He worked as a well digger, as a gasoline station attendant and occasionally as a musician. Pianist Gladys Williams, a locally well-known musician in Macon and another who inspired Redding, often performed at the Hillview Springs Social Club, and Redding sometimes played piano with her band there. Williams hosted Sunday talent shows, which Redding <b>attended</b> <b>with</b> two friends, singers Little Willie Jones and Eddie Ross.|$|E

5|$|The {{competition}} {{follows a}} point scoring system {{much like the}} Amsterdam Tournament, whereby each team plays two matches, with three points awarded for a win, one point for a draw and none for a loss. An additional point is awarded for every goal scored. Arsenal did not face Valencia, and Inter did not play against Paris Saint-Germain. On {{the first day of}} the Emirates Cup, Valencia beat Inter Milan by two goals, while Arsenal defeated Paris Saint-Germain 2–1. Valencia's loss to Paris Saint-Germain on day two meant Arsenal needed to beat Inter Milan in order to finish top of the group. They went a goal behind in the second half, but goals from Alexander Hleb and Robin van Persie secured the cup win. The tournament was well <b>attended</b> <b>with</b> over 110,000 filling the Emirates Stadium across the two-day tournament.|$|E
5|$|The inaugural Emirates Cup {{took place}} on 28 July and 29 July 2007 and was well <b>attended</b> <b>with</b> over 110,000 people filling the stadium across the two-day tournament. Each club played two sides; Valencia and Arsenal did not face each other, and Inter did not play against Paris Saint-Germain. Arsenal won the first tournament, having beaten their French opponents 2–1 and {{defeated}} Inter by the same scoreline, courtesy of a late Robin van Persie strike. The following year Hamburg made an appearance alongside Real Madrid and Juventus, and won the tournament as they finished two points clear of second-place Real.|$|E
5|$|After {{both the}} British Industrial Syndicalist Education League (ISEL), a {{short-lived}} syndicalist organization {{heavily involved in}} the strike wave in Britain from 1910, and the Dutch syndicalist union National Labor Secretariat (NAS) published proposals for an international syndicalist congress in 1913, the FVdG {{was the first to}} express support. There were difficulties in organizing the congress, and the largest syndicalist union worldwide— the CGT— refused to participate because it was already affiliated with the social democratic International Federation of Trade Unions. Despite these challenges, the First International Syndicalist Congress took place at Holborn Town Hall in London from September 27 to October 2. British, Swedish, Danish, Dutch, Belgian, French, Spanish, Italian, Cuban, Brazilian, and Argentine organizations—both labor unions and political groups— had delegates in London in addition to the FVdG, which was represented by Karl Roche, Carl Windhoff, and Fritz Kater. There were also links with Norwegian, Polish, and American groups. Kater was elected co-president of the congress alongside Jack Wills. After Wills was forced to resign, Kater served as co-president with Jack Tanner. The congress had difficulty agreeing on many issues, the main source of conflict being whether further schisms in the European labor movement (as had occurred in Germany and the Netherlands) should be risked. The FVdG generally agreed with their Dutch comrades in calling on other unions to decide between syndicalism and socialism, while their Italian, French, and Spanish counterparts, most notably Alceste De Ambris of the Italian USI, were more intent on preventing further division. Accordingly, the congress was divided {{on the question of whether}} its purpose was to simply pave the way for deeper relations between the syndicalist unions or whether a Syndicalist International was to be founded. The opponents of a new organization prevailed, but the congress agreed to establish an Information Bureau. The Information Bureau was based in Amsterdam and published the Bulletin international du mouvement syndicaliste. The congress was considered a success by most who <b>attended,</b> <b>with</b> the notable exception of De Ambris. A second congress was scheduled to take place in two years' time in Amsterdam. Due to the outbreak of World War I, the congress did not take place. The Bulletin only published for eighteen issues before the war caused it to cease publication.|$|E
