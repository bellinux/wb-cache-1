25|$|Conze {{immediately}} contacted Humann, who at {{the time}} was in Turkey working for a road construction company. Things then moved quickly. The German government arranged for a license to dig in Turkey and in September 1878 excavations began, headed by Humann and Conze. By 1886, large parts of the acropolis had been investigated and in the following years also scientifically appraised and published. Based on an agreement between the Ottoman Empire and the German government, starting in 1879 the relief panels from the Pergamon Altar along with some other fragments came to Berlin and into the possession of the Collection of Antiquities. The German side was well aware that by doing this a work of art was being removed from its original location and was not completely happy <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>situation.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} reasons which had brought <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>situation</b> – most {{significantly}} in the early 20th century there was no firmly upheld legislation to protect what is now {{considered to be the}} nation's heritage. Additionally, public opinion did not have the sentiment and interest in national heritage that is evident in Britain today. When the loss of Britain's architectural heritage reached its height at the rate of one house every five days in 1955, few were particularly interested or bothered. In the immediate aftermath of World War II, to the British public still suffering from the deprivations of food rationing and restriction on building work the destruction of these great redundant houses was of little interest. From 1914 onwards there had been a huge exodus away from a life in domestic service; having experienced the less restricted and better paid life away from the great estates, few were anxious to return – this in itself was a further reason that life in the English country house was becoming near impossible to all but the very rich.|$|E
25|$|Like {{any sexual}} contact, extramarital sex opens the {{possibility}} of the introduction of sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs) into a marriage. Since most married couples do not routinely use barrier contraceptives, STDs can be introduced to a marriage partner by a spouse engaging in unprotected extramarital sex. This can be a public health issue in regions of the world where STDs are common, but addressing this issue is very difficult due to legal and social barriersto openly talk <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>situation</b> would mean to acknowledge that adultery (often) takes place, something that is taboo in certain cultures, especially those strongly influenced by religion. In addition, dealing with the issue of barrier contraception in marriage in cultures where women have very few rights is difficult: the power of women to negotiate safer sex (or sex in general) with their husbands is often limited. The World Health Organisation (WHO) found that women in violent relations were at increased risk of HIV/AIDS, because they found it very difficult to negotiate safe sex with their partners, or to ask medical advice if they thought they have been infected.|$|E

500|$|In chapter 285, [...] "Kiss of Truth", Hild {{reveals that}} Keiichi's sexual desires for Belldandy have {{previously}} been sealed away {{in order to}} prevent humans and gods from mating, as would be the natural consequences of Keiichi's wish for a goddess to be with him always. This explains why Keiichi has never been very forward in their relationship. Although Belldandy has never lied <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>situation,</b> she has also never told him. When the old contract was dissolved and a new one is formed, Belldandy and Keiichi are immediately confronted with an Interracial Romance Inquisitor (Ansuz, mother of Belldandy and Skuld) who immediately sets a trial to determine if they are really meant to be together, and should Keiichi fail, they shall be separated forever. Once passing the test, Belldandy and Keiichi are allowed by the heavens to live together as a proper couple, with their wedding ceremony being held in the final chapter.|$|E
500|$|Bushnell Keeler has {{commented that}} Lynch's {{dropping}} out of the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston [...] "worked to his detriment then, but may now be one of his greatest assets". Keeler recounts that Lynch left the school after allowing one of his tutors to use his dormitory room; the tutor, who {{was in the process of}} divorcing his wife, spent several nights in Lynch's room with his mistress, while Lynch obligingly slept on the floor. Rather than confronting the tutor <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>situation,</b> Lynch felt it would be easier to leave school instead. Keeler and film critic Greg Olson posit that this desire to avoid confrontation has shaped the characters he has written, who often seek an [...] "escape route" [...] in the face of adversity rather than face it directly. Olson has further added that several of Lynch's later works—Dune and Twin Peaks—would have [...] "been less compromised" [...] had Lynch been of a more adversarial personality; as they were, both projects featured interference from film and television studios respectively.|$|E

2500|$|Collins' {{position}} {{in this conflict}} was extraordinary indeed. [...] "A majority perhaps" [...] of the army he'd led in the War of Independence were now ranged against the Free State, which he represented. In addition the force which by {{the will of the}} electorate he was obliged to lead had been re-organised since the Truce. Formed from a nucleus of pro-Treaty IRA men, it had evolved into a more formal, structured, uniformed National Army that was armed and funded by Britain. Many of the new members were World War I veterans and others who had not fought on the nationalist side before. It was now ten {{times the size of the}} force which had won independence, yet heavily populated with former British Army personnel.
