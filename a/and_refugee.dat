5|$|According to Citizenship and Immigration Canada, {{there are}} three main classifications for immigrants: Family class (persons closely related to Canadian residents), Economic class (admitted {{on the basis of}} a point system that {{accounts}} for age, health and labour-market skills required for cost effectively inducting the immigrants into Canada's labour market) <b>and</b> <b>Refugee</b> class (those seeking protection by applying to remain in the country by way of the Canadian immigration <b>and</b> <b>refugee</b> law). In 2008, there were 65,567 immigrants in the family class, 21,860 refugees, and 149,072 economic immigrants amongst the 247,243 total immigrants to the country.

40|$|This report {{examines}} {{the situation of}} asylum seekers <b>and</b> <b>refugees</b> from an equality and human rights perspective. It aims to contextualise measures taken towards asylum seekers <b>and</b> <b>refugees</b> within the broader range of measures relating to migrants and visitors to the UK, arguing {{that the government has}} itself increasing sought to integrate the measures taken towards asylum seekers <b>and</b> <b>refugees</b> within broader migration policy. After considering the policy area, the report describes the disadvantages for asylum seekers <b>and</b> <b>refugees</b> with relation to: health status, health and social care; education, training and the labour market; poverty, destitution and access to accommodation and financial support; and the legal and criminal justice system. It goes on to consider issues relating to integration and cohesion, such as racism and discrimination. The geographic distribution of asylum seekers <b>and</b> <b>refugees</b> <b>and</b> the situation in Scotland and Wales are considered. Finally, the report discusses implications for data collection, key strategic issues, and the scope for intervention. The report concludes that the ongoing tension between policies relating to immigration control and those concerned with welfare {{lies at the heart of}} many of the concerns regarding the equality and human rights of asylum seekers <b>and</b> <b>refugees...</b>|$|R

5|$|Arafat was {{pronounced}} dead at 03:30UTC on 11 November 2004 {{at the age of}} 75 of what French doctors called a massive hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (hemorrhagic stroke). Initially, Arafat's medical records were withheld by senior Palestinian officials, and Arafat's wife refused an autopsy. French doctors also said that Arafat suffered from a blood condition known as disseminated intravascular coagulation, although it is inconclusive what brought about the condition. When Arafat's death was announced, the Palestinian people went into a state of mourning, with Qur'anic mourning prayers emitted from mosque loudspeakers throughout the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and tires burned in the streets. The Palestinian Authority <b>and</b> <b>refugee</b> camps in Lebanon declared 40 days of mourning.|$|E
5|$|Bernier {{went on to}} win his {{election}} in Beauce with 62% of the vote. Harper won re-election as prime-minister; he did not appoint Bernier to a cabinet position. Bernier would eventually return to the cabinet following the 2011 election, in which the Conservatives won a majority government, as Minister of State for Small Business and Tourism. Bernier continues to sit as an MP, and is currently a candidate for the Conservative Party leadership. Stemming from Couillard's actions during the entire affair, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) launched investigations on how she obtained the secret documents; on whether Couillard's mother was offered a patronage appointment by a Conservative Party official to the Immigration <b>and</b> <b>Refugee</b> Board of Canada; and on whether there was influence peddling during the land sale between the Kevlar Group and Public Works.|$|E
5|$|By {{the morning}} of 29 April it was {{estimated}} that approximately 10,000 people had gathered around the Embassy, while some 2,500 evacuees were in the Embassy and consular compounds. The crowds prevented the use of buses for transporting evacuees from the Embassy to the DAO Compound for evacuation and the Embassy gates were closed to prevent the crowd from surging through. Eligible evacuees now had to make themselves known to the Marine guards or Embassy staff manning the walls and were then lifted over the walls and into the Embassy compound. Among those arriving at the Embassy were Dr Phan Quang Dan, former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister responsible for social welfare <b>and</b> <b>refugee</b> resettlement, and Lieutenant-General Dang Van Quang.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Aim: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} continuity of care in the psychiatric healthcare system from the perspective of patients, including vulnerable groups such as immigrants <b>and</b> <b>refugees.</b> Method: The study is based on 19 narrative interviews conducted with 15 patients with diverse migration backgrounds (immigrants, descendents, <b>refugees,</b> <b>and</b> ethnic Danes). Patients were recruited from a community psychiatric centre situated in an area with a high proportion of immigrants <b>and</b> <b>refugees.</b> Data were analysed through the lens of a theoretical framework of continuity of care in psychiatry, developed in 2004 by Joyce et al., which encompasses four domains: accessibility, individualised care, relationship base and service delivery. Results: Investigating continuity of care, we found issues of specific concern to immigrants <b>and</b> <b>refugees,</b> but also commonalities across the groups.
