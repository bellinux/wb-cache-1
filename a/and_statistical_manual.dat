5|$|In 1952, the American Psychiatric Association listed {{homosexuality}} in the Diagnostic <b>and</b> <b>Statistical</b> <b>Manual</b> (DSM) as {{a mental}} disorder.

In 1956, however, the psychologist Evelyn Hooker performed a study that compared the happiness and well-adjusted nature of self-identified homosexual men with heterosexual men and found no difference. Her study stunned the medical community and made her a hero to many gay men and lesbians, but homosexuality remained in the DSM until 1973.|$|E

This article discusses the conceptualisation of &# 039;sexual dysfunctions&# 039; in the DSM, of which HSDD is a part, and questions how it operates in clinical research into asexuality.

40|$|The continual {{process of}} mental disease {{classification}} in U. S. psychiatry {{is assumed to}} reflect advancing professional knowledge of these disorders. To date, the American Psychiatric Association has developed four standard classifications, or nosologies, called Diagnostic <b>and</b> <b>Statistical</b> <b>Manuals</b> ('DSMs'). DSM-I, the earliest, appeared in 1952 while the most recent, DSM-III-R, appeared in 1987. This paper employs a cultural constructivist perspective to deconstruct these nosologies and the classificatory process itself. Constructivism's premises, which emphasize culture, history, meaning and the constructed nature of medical phenomena, serve as the framework for the analysis. The paper shows that professional psychiatric classification expresses an underlying cultural psychology which encompasses four phenomenological domains and one of three Western person conceptions. Classifications {{are found to be}} explorations of culturally meaningful etiologies that explain the absence of 'self control', a central ethnopsychological aspect of the idealized self. Consideration of the vantage point of the voice of classification indicates that the ideal self is gender- (male), ethnic- (German Protestant) and age-specific (adult). The ethnic self's essence, and that of the Other, is believed to be biological, itself assumed to be natural and beyond culture or bias. Consequently, the ethnopsychology constructs as biologically caused the real and imagined differences in the gender, age or culturally Other. This invidious ethnobiological essentialism acts to create and maintain self-worth through a radical differentiation of self from those represented as Other. ethnopsychology psychiatric classification ethnopsychiatry United States medical anthropology...|$|R
5|$|The exact {{cause of}} Asperger's is unknown. While it is {{probably}} partly inherited, the underlying genetics have not been determined conclusively. Environmental factors are also believed to play a role. Brain imaging has not identified a common underlying problem. The diagnosis of Asperger's was removed in the 2013 fifth edition of the Diagnostic <b>and</b> <b>Statistical</b> <b>Manual</b> of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), and people with these symptoms are now included within the autism spectrum disorder along with autism and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. It remains within the tenth edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) as of 2015.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} the overlap between AS and high-functioning autism (HFA—autism unaccompanied by {{intellectual}} disability) is unclear. The ASD classification is to some extent an artifact of how autism was discovered, and may not reflect {{the true nature of}} the spectrum; methodological problems have beset Asperger syndrome as a valid diagnosis from the outset. In the fifth edition of the Diagnostic <b>and</b> <b>Statistical</b> <b>Manual</b> of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published in May 2013, AS, as a separate diagnosis, was eliminated and folded into autism spectrum disorder. Like the diagnosis of Asperger syndrome, the change was controversial and AS was not removed from the WHO's ICD-10.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the fifth}} edition of the Diagnostic <b>and</b> <b>Statistical</b> <b>Manual</b> of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), Tourette’s may be {{diagnosed}} when a person exhibits both multiple motor and one or more vocal tics over the period of a year; the motor and vocal tics need not be concurrent. The onset must have occurred {{before the age of}} 18, and cannot be attributed to the effects of another condition or substance (such as cocaine). Hence, other medical conditions that include tics or tic-like movements—such as autism or other causes of tourettism—must be ruled out before conferring a Tourette's diagnosis. Since 2000, the DSM has recognized that clinicians see patients who meet all the other criteria for Tourette's, but do not have distress or impairment.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis article {{argues that}} {{psychiatric}} diagnoses are not valid or useful. The use of psychiatric diagnosis increases stigma, does not aid treatment decisions, {{is associated with}} worsening long-term prognosis for mental health problems, and imposes Western beliefs about mental distress on other cultures. This article reviews the evidence base focusing in particular on empirical findings {{in relation to the}} topics of: aetiology, validity, reliability, treatment and outcome, prognosis, colonialism, and cultural and public policy impact. This evidence points toward diagnostic based frameworks for understanding and intervening in mental health difficulties being unable to either improve our scientific knowledge or improve outcomes in clinical practice and suggests that we need to move away from reliance on diagnostic based approaches for organising research and service delivery. Alternative evidence-based models for organising effective mental health care are available. Therefore formal psychiatric diagnostic systems such as the mental health section of the International Classification of Diseases Tenth Edition (ICD- 10) <b>and</b> Diagnostic <b>Statistical</b> <b>Manual</b> Fifth Edition (DSM 5) should be abolished...|$|R
40|$|M. A. There is a {{critical}} lack of local, clinical research into this growing problem which threatens to affect all of our lives, either directly or indirectly. The last government-sanctioned study on substance abuse in South Africa was conducted in 1970, and very limited research reports have been published that have reflected on the etiology, maintenance and treatment of the problem, either from a social or therapeutic perspective. This dissertation sets out to address the clinical, therapeutic issues of Substance Abuse disorder, including alcohol, within a South African context. The assumption of the author is that pathological personality styles and disorders underlie the problem of substance abuse in South Africa, as {{has been established in}} countries with similar substance abuse issues around the world. As will be seen in the following chapter, a distinct relationship has been established between the disorder of substance abuse, on Axis I and the personality disorders of Axis II, according to the DSM III-R. 4 A review of the literature will demonstrate the different findings surrounding this relationship, and describe the role that pathological personality patterns play in the development and maintenance of Substance Abuse disorder. These pathological personality styles and disorders are then discussed in detail, from the perspective of Millon's theory of personality. It is felt by this author that Millon's theory of personality provides a comprehensive framework for the discussion of the underlying personality issues associated with addiction. The extensive description of Millon's personality styles and disorders, their close association to the personality disorders described in the Diagnostic <b>and</b> <b>Statistical</b> <b>Manuals,</b> <b>and</b> their easy quantification through the MCMI II make Millon's theory, coupled with his test of personality the most well suited theory to form a foundation for the discussion and integration of an understanding of the problems associated with substance abuse in South Africa. In order to determine the relevance of foreign- based studies in a South African context, a study into the personality profiles of South African substance abusers was conducted at three rehabilitation centers within the Gauteng province of South Africa...|$|R
5|$|Since medical {{literature}} began to describe homosexuality, {{it has often}} been approached from a view that sought to find an inherent psychopathology as the root cause, influenced by the theories of Sigmund Freud. Although he considered bisexuality inherent in all people, and said that most have phases of homosexual attraction or experimentation, exclusive same-sex attraction he attributed to stunted development resulting from trauma or parental conflicts. Much literature on mental health and lesbians centered on their depression, substance abuse, and suicide. Although these issues exist among lesbians, discussion about their causes shifted after homosexuality was removed from the Diagnostic <b>and</b> <b>Statistical</b> <b>Manual</b> in 1973. Instead, social ostracism, legal discrimination, internalization of negative stereotypes, and limited support structures indicate factors homosexuals face in Western societies that often adversely affect their mental health.|$|E
5|$|The National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS) and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (ADRDA, {{now known}} as the Alzheimer's Association) {{established}} the most commonly used NINCDS-ADRDA Alzheimer's Criteria for diagnosis in 1984, extensively updated in 2007. These criteria require that the presence of cognitive impairment, and a suspected dementia syndrome, be confirmed by neuropsychological testing for a clinical diagnosis of possible or probable AD. A histopathologic confirmation including a microscopic examination of brain tissue is required for a definitive diagnosis. Good statistical reliability and validity have been shown between the diagnostic criteria and definitive histopathological confirmation. Eight cognitive domains are most commonly impaired in AD—memory, language, perceptual skills, attention, constructive abilities, orientation, problem solving and functional abilities. These domains are equivalent to the NINCDS-ADRDA Alzheimer's Criteria as listed in the Diagnostic <b>and</b> <b>Statistical</b> <b>Manual</b> of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) published by the American Psychiatric Association.|$|E

40|$|Animal cruelty is {{not only}} often a {{precursor}} to disruptive and delinquent behavior, it often co-occurs with the commission of family violence and other criminal behavior. The American Psychological Association, the National Crime Prevention Council, and the National School Safety Council cite animal cruelty {{as one of the}} warning signs for identifying at-risk youth. In 1987, the Diagnostic <b>and</b> <b>Statistical</b> Style <b>Manual</b> added animal cruelty as an indicator of the presence of conduct disorder in children. In recognition of this important link between animal cruelty and juvenile delinquency, 27 states have added statutory requirements for juveniles adjudicated for animal cruelty, or possibility of animal cruelty, to submit to psychological counseling. Despite this clear link between animal cruelty and youth violence, and the importance of accurately identifying risk factors that increase the likelihood of delinquent behavior, researchers and policy makers do not always grasp the utility of looking at animal cruelty as an important variable to consider. The development of disruptive and delinquent behavior takes place in a progressive fashion. Could the detection of animal cruelty generate earlier and more effective interventions and allow the research community to better understand the development of deviant behavior? This paper will assess the feasibility and usefulness of including animal cruelty as a variable in future research and practices, as well as make recommendations of how this can be accomplished.
