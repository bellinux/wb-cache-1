5|$|Dummy {{horses were}} {{sometimes}} used to deceive the enemy into misreading {{the location of}} troops. They were effectively used by Allenby during his campaigns in the east, especially late in the war. Evidence exists that the Germans used horses in their experimentations with chemical and biological warfare. German agents in the US <b>are</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>of</b> infecting cattle and horses bound for France with glanders, a disease which can fatally spread to humans; similar tactics were used by the Germans against the Russians, causing breakdowns {{in their ability to}} move artillery on the Eastern Front.|$|E

The same night, another action in took place in Karachi when the CID teams, in a high-speed chase in Hawke's Bay Beach, chased and apprehended five members of al-Qaeda's South Asian chapter who <b>are</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>of</b> planning {{an attack on a}} naval dockyard in Karachi in September.|$|E
5|$|By 07:40, {{all five}} hijackers were aboard the flight, which was {{scheduled}} to depart at 07:45. Wail and Waleed al-Shehri sat together in first class in seats 2A and 2B respectively. The aircraft taxied away from Gate26, and departed Logan International Airport at 07:59, following a 14-minute delay. Flight11 was hijacked at approximately 08:14, which is when the pilot stopped responding to air traffic control. Once the hijacking began, the brothers <b>are</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>of</b> having stabbed two flight attendants. At 08:46:40, Mohamed Atta deliberately crashed Flight11 into the northern facade of the North Tower (Tower1) of the World Trade Center. The immediate damage destroyed any means of escape from above the impact zone, trapping 1,344people. The North Tower collapsed at 10:28, after burning for 102 minutes.|$|E

5|$|Main {{group or}} Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. They {{are some of}} the largest objects in the Solar System outside the Sun and the eight planets in terms of mass and are larger than any known dwarf planet. Ganymede exceeds even the planet Mercury in diameter. They are {{respectively}} the fourth-, sixth-, first-, and third-largest natural satellites in the Solar System, containing approximately 99.997% of the total mass in orbit around Jupiter, while Jupiter is almost 5,000 times more massive than the Galilean moons. The inner moons are in a 1:2:4 orbital resonance. Models suggest that they formed by slow accretion in the low-density Jovian subnebula—a disc of the gas and dust that existed around Jupiter after its formation—which lasted up to 10 million years in the case of Callisto. Several <b>are</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>of</b> having subsurface oceans.|$|E
5|$|The {{nucleus of}} some comets may be fragile, a {{conclusion}} {{supported by the}} observation of comets splitting apart. A significant cometary disruption was that of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9, which was discovered in 1993. A close encounter in July 1992 had broken it into pieces, and {{over a period of}} six days in July 1994, these pieces fell into Jupiter's atmosphere—the first time astronomers had observed a collision between two objects in the Solar System. Other splitting comets include 3D/Biela in 1846 and 73P/Schwassmann–Wachmann from 1995 to 2006. Greek historian Ephorus reported that a comet split apart {{as far back as the}} winter of 372–373 BC. Comets <b>are</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>of</b> splitting due to thermal stress, internal gas pressure, or impact.|$|E
5|$|When {{confronted with}} {{inaccuracies}} or inconsistencies, those who <b>are</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>of</b> perpetrating fabrications may compound the deceit by accusing forum members of imposing greater stresses upon them, exacerbating their conditions, or worsening their depression. Users may employ sockpuppets—separate online identities {{controlled by the}} same person—to accuse other forum members of disloyalty and persecution, or support the user who is under suspicion. Feldman's 1998 article in the Western Journal of Medicine notes {{a case in which}} a member of a support group for people with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome created a husband, sister-in-law, and family friend who simultaneously engaged in arguments with and about the original member; when the amount of attention directed toward the original member became inadequate, she claimed the sister-in-law committed suicide in response to the lack of support.|$|E

25|$|Much {{speculation}} about the lovebug still thrives.
