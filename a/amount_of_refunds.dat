The basic method of writing the article was {{an analysis of the}} legal and regulatory framework, as well as trend analysis <b>of</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> VAT <b>refunding</b> in Ukraine. As a result of the study, it was found that during 2013 the competent authorities have not received any requests from payers for the VAT refunding with treasury bills.

40|$|Femtocell {{technology}} {{addresses the}} problem of poor indoor coverage, benefiting both wireless service provider (WSP) and end users. With the introduction of femtocell, the cross-tier interference between macro link and femto link becomes a major factor which greatly impacts the network performance. Different access control approaches, by generating different interference patterns, also severely affect the overall throughput of the network {{and need to be}} carefully investigated. Among all the access control mechanisms, hybrid access is the most promising one, which allows roaming unregistered users (referred to as macro users) to access the nearby femto base station (BS) while reserving certain resource for registered home users (referred to as femto users), improving overall network capacity. However, to successfully leverage hybrid access is challenging because the femto holders (FHs) are selfish, unwilling to share their femto facilities and spectrum resource with macro users without any incentive mechanism. In this paper, we propose a novel utility-aware refunding framework to motivate hybrid access in femtocell. Within the framework, both WSP and FHs are assumed to be selfish, and target at maximizing their own utilities. WSP provides certain refunding to motivate FHs to open their resource for macro users. FHs decide the resource allocation among femto and macro users according to the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>refunding</b> WSP offers. Under this framework, the optimal strategies of both WSP and FHs are analyzed by formulating the problem as a Stackelberg Game. A unique Nash Equilibrium is achieved and a hybrid access protocol is designed according to the analysis. Extensive simulations have been conducted and the results show that the utilities of both WSP and FHs are significantly improved exploiting the hybrid access mechanism...|$|R

50|$|Offshore bank {{accounts}} are sometimes less financially secure. In a banking crisis which swept {{the world in}} 2008, some savers lost funds that were not insured by {{the country in which}} they were deposited. Those who had deposited with the same banks onshore received all of their money back. In 2009, The Isle of Man authorities were keen to point out that 90% of the claimants were paid, although this only referred to {{the number of people who}} had received money from their depositor compensation scheme and not the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> money <b>refunded.</b> In reality, only 40% of depositor funds had been repaid: 24.8% in September 2009 and 15.2% in December 2009. Both offshore and onshore banking centres often have depositor compensation schemes. For example: The Isle of Man compensation scheme guarantees £50,000 of net deposits per individual depositor, or £20,000 for most other categories of depositor. Potential depositors should be aware that any deposits over the guaranteed amount are at risk. However, only offshore centres such as the Isle of Man have refused to compensate depositors 100% of their funds following Bank collapses. Onshore depositors have been refunded in full, regardless of what the compensation limit of that country has stated. Thus, banking offshore is historically riskier than banking onshore.|$|R

40|$|Key words. Newsvendor Model, Inventory Model, Seasonal Product, Weather Risk, Weather Option, Weather Derivative, Weather-Conditional Rebate, CVaR, Mean-CVaR. The {{first model}} {{considers}} {{the problem of}} hedging inventory risk for a newsvendor who sells a seasonal product. The newsvendor not only decides the order quantity, but also adopts a weather hedging strategy. A typical hedging strategy is to use an option that is constructed on a weather index before the season begins, which will compensate the buyer of the option if the actual seasonal weather index is above (or below) a given strike level. We explore the joint decision problem in mean-variance, expected utility, conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), and mean-CVaR frameworks. We analyze the impact of weather hedging on optimal order quantity. It is proven that the newsvendor may order {{more than in the}} absence of weather options. Numerical analysis on the sensitivity of the optimal order quantity, the risk premium of the option, the portfolio selection and the comparison between the weather option hedging and a particular operational hedging are presented as well. The second model investigates the advantages of early sales of a seasonal product. To induce early sales, the newsvendor adopts a weather-conditional rebate program, which will pay rebates to the customers who buy the product in the preselling period if a specified weather condition for normal selling season is realized. For an example, a certain <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>refund</b> will be paid to early buyer if the seasonal average temperature falls below the past-three-year seasonal average. Two conditional rebate programs with early booking and early purchasing are investigated and compared. Both of them can price differentiate within a customer among his/her post valuation on the seasonal product, and thus increase the sales. For the early purchasing program, it can further save inventory holding cost and ordering cost. The expected profit can be improved by the programs. Moreover, combined with weather derivatives, the conditional rebate program can manage the financial risk with the expected profit being still improved. To investigate the means that firms may adopt in managing the adverse impacts of weather on their businesses, this dissertation proposes and analyzes two inventory models for seasonal products when the demand is sensitive to the weather in the season. Both models are formulated under the newsvendor context. Gao, Fei. "October 2007. "Adviser: Youhua Frank Chen. Source: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 69 - 08, Section: B, page: 5002.

40|$|Reconstructive surgery of {{the head}} and neck region has {{undergone}} tremendous advancement over the past three decades, and the success rate of free tissue transfers has risen to greater than 95 %. It must always be considered that not all patients are ideal candidates for free flap reconstruction, and also that not every defect strictly requires a free flap transfer to achieve good functional results. At our institution, free flap reconstruction is first choice, although we use pedicled alternative flaps for most weak patients suffering from severe comorbidities, and for pretreated patients presenting a second primary or a recurrent cancer. From July 2006 to May 2010, 54 consecutive patients underwent soft tissue reconstruction of oral cavity and oropharyngeal defects. We divided the cohort in three groups: Group 1 (G 1) : 16 patients in good general conditions that received free radial forearm flap reconstruction; Group 2 (G 2) : 18 high-risk patients that received a reconstruction with infrahyoid flap; Group 3 (G 3) : 20 patients that received temporal flap (10 cases) or pectoral flap (10 cases) reconstruction. We must highlight that pedicled alternative flaps were used in elderly, unfavourable and weak patients, where usually the medical costs tend to rise rather than decrease. We compared the healthcare costs of the three groups, calculating real costs in each group from review of medical records and operating room registers, and calculating the corresponding DRG system reimbursement. For real costs, we found a statistically significant difference among groups: in G 1 the average total cost per patient was € 22, 924, in G 2 it was € 18, 037 and in G 3 was € 19, 872 (p = 0. 043). The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> the <b>refund,</b> based on the DRG system, was € 7, 650 per patient, independently of the type of surgery. Our analysis shows that the use of alternative non-microvascular techniques, in high-risk patients, is functionally and oncologically sound, and can even produce a cost savings. In particular, the infrahyoid flap (G 2) ensures excellent functional results, accompanied by the best economic savings in the worst group of patients. Our data reflect a large disconnection between the DRG system and actual treatment costs. Abstract available from the publisher...|$|R
