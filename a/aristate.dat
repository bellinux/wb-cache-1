50|$|Tachinid flies are {{extremely}} varied in appearance. Some adult flies may be brilliantly colored and then resemble blow-flies (family Calliphoridae). Most however are rather drab, some resembling house flies. However, Tachinid flies commonly are more bristly and more robust. Also, they {{usually have a}} characteristic appearance. They have three-segmented antennae, a diagnostically prominent postscutellum bulging beneath the scutellum (a segment of the mesonotum). They are <b>aristate</b> flies, and the arista usually is bare, though sometimes plumose. The calypters (small flaps above the halteres) are usually very large.

In some asilids, the stylus can be monoarticolate or absent.The mouthparts are short and modified for piercing-sucking. They consist of a strongly sclerotized proboscis which includes the labium and maxillae which form a food canal, the labrum and a piercing organ, the hypopharynx. The proboscis is rounded in cross section or laterally or dorsoventrally compressed and is usually stout, and straight and sometimes able to penetrate through the hard integument of Coleoptera.

50|$|All flies can be {{identified}} from other species by certain characteristics. They can differ in thoracic coloring, basicosta coloring, and spiracle coloring. Size and shape are aids in identification. Pollenia rudis eggs are oblong-shaped. They are very small and white. The P. Rudis larvae are white with posterior spiracles. The adult Pollenia rudis looks {{like most of the}} other Pollenia species such as pallida, and dasylpoda. They are dark gray with checkered black and silvery-black abdomens. A newly emerged fly has many golden hairs on its thorax which may be lost throughout the life of the fly. The stripes on the thorax are not as prominent as on the house fly and the tips of the wings overlap when at rest. The cluster fly is slightly larger than a house fly at 9.525-12.7mm (3/8-1/2 inch) long. The similarities between pallida and rudis are seen in the female specimens. P. pallida has a broad, flattened facial keel. P.dasyloda has a black head with yellow tint on the frons. The basicosta can be found in many colors ranging from yellow to light brown. Some specimens have black basicosta. The posterior spiracle ranges from yellow in color to light brown. The number of bristles and setae found on this species are characteristic of this species only. There are 2-3 rows of setae located on the thoracic section and 6-8 strong frontal bristles. Bristles are thick setae. They also have <b>aristate</b> antennae.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT—A nematocerous fly family known {{previously}} {{only from}} one species and specimen from the Upper Jurassic of Karatau, Kazakhstan, Archizelmiridae is expanded here to include additional records preserved as compression fossils and ones in amber. The compressions {{are from the}} Upper Jurassic of Shar-Teg, Mongolia and Lower Cretaceous of Baissa, Transbaikal, with a new species, Archizelmira baissa, from Baissa. Particularly significant are three finely preserved new species and genera in ambers from the Cre-taceous Period: Zelmiarcha lebanensis (Lebanon: Lower Aptian), Archimelzira americana (New Jersey: Turonian), and Burmazelmira aristica (Burma [Myanmar]: mid-Cretaceous).

40|$|This {{research}} {{was carried out}} in order to investigate the presence of different species from the genus Tilia,. Phenetic analysis confirmed the presence of seven groups of leaves with distinguishable character from Tilia in Hyrcanian forests. Distinctive analysis presented the size of serrate, the presence of trichome on the leaf upper and lower surfaces and on the petiole as important discriminating traits. The fourth group was separated from other groups due to the presence of trichome on the two sides of leaves, dull green color and leathery leaves. Size of serrate, long acuminate tip were diagnostic traits of second and third groups, but lower surface and petiole of leaves of second groups had settelate trichomes. In the fourth and fifth groups, lower surface of leaves had settlate trichomes with short <b>aristate</b> and short acuminate, but the petiole of forth group had settlate trichome. In the sixth group, only petiole had trichome, while the leaf surface and petiole of seventh group was glabrate. In conclusion, this research, in addition to confirming the presence of of Tilia platyphyllos doubted the presence of Tilia begonifolia Steven, Tilia caucasica Rupr. and Tilia dasystyla Steven in the north of Iran. Also, it reported a new form of the genus Tilia in mountainous regions of Hyrcanian forests.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to report on the {{occurrence}} of somaclonal variation in in vitro regenerated Ledebouria graminifolia an indigenous bulb in Botswana and assess its potential use as an ornamental plant. Plants that were regenerated using tissue culture were planted in a mixture of garden soil and potting soil in the greenhouse and also grown in the field under natural conditions without additional resources supplied to the plants. Morphological features and tolerance to drought were used to assess somaclonal variation among clones. In vitro propagated plants grew well in the greenhouse, they produced large attractive leaves and many flowered continuously. Field grown plants acclimatized well and survived periods of droughts and high temperatures. Morphological evaluation of the plants showed five visually distinct variants. Morphotype 1 consisted of prostrate plants with large, fewer, bright green leaves. Morphotype 2 consisted of prostrate plants with large, less bright green lanceolate leaves. Morphotype 3 consisted of plants with medium <b>aristate,</b> grayish green, curly leaves with rubbery appearance. Morphotype 4 had intermediate characteristics between 2 and 3 with grayish, lanceolate leaves.

40|$|Trees or shrubs, {{very rarely}} herbs or fleshy saprophytes. Leaves spiral, {{sometimes}} opposite or pseudowhorled, simple, entire, crenate or serrate, mostly evergreen and ± coriaceous (Malesia), exstipulate (stipule-like perulae of axillary buds occur in Diplycosia and Vaccinium p. p.). Flowers bisexual (rarely functionally unisexual; or the plant dioecious in extra-Mal.), characteristically regular, (4 -) 5 (rarely 6 - 7) -merous. Inflorescences terminal or axillary, entirely covered by perulae in bud, mostly in racemes, these sometimes arranged to panicles or condensed to umbels, or reduced to few-flowered fascicles, {{or even to}} a solitary flower. Sepals (reduced in Monotropastrum and Wirtgenia) very rarely free, generally connate below to a calyx tube, the latter free or ± adnate to the ovary, persistent, whether or not accrescent in fruit, lobes imbricate or open in bud. Corolla campanulate to funnel-shaped, urceolate or cylindric, sometimes slightly zygomorphous, caducous, lobed to various degree, lobes imbricate (sometimes ± contorted), rarely valvate in bud. Stamens usually 10 (rarely 5, 8, or up to 20), obdiplostemonous, rarely haplostemonous, inserted at the outer margin of the disk between its lobes, or slightly attached {{to the base of}} the corolla; filaments free (Malesia); anthers dorsifixed to almost basifixed, the 2 cells (thecae) not rarely extending into free or connate tubules, these muticous or sometimes (bi) <b>aristate</b> distally by the prolonged back-wall, opening by terminal or introrse, very rarely extrorse pores or slits, not rarely with projecting dorsal appendages or spurs; pollen in tetrads, simple in Monotropoideae. Gynoecium syncarpous, 5 - or pseudo- 10 -, rarely 2 - 4 - or 6 - 7 -celled. Disk hypogynous or epigynous, often fleshy and nectariferous, entire or mostly 5 - 10 -lobed. Ovary 1, superior, half-inferior or inferior, generally with as many cells as carpels; placentation central, with 1 or 2 lamellas per cell, each bearing mostly numerous, rarely 1, anatropous or obliquely amphitropous, 1 -tegumented ovulus. Style 1; stigma obtuse, capitate or peltate, whether or not 5 - 7 -lobed. Fruit a 5 (- 7) -valved, septicidal or (sometimes lately or irregularly) loculicidal capsule, which may be ± included by the accrescent, ± fleshy calyx, or a rather dry to fleshy berry (Malesia). Seeds usually numerous, small, whether or not winged or tailed at one or both ends; testa thin, often reticulate; embryo cylindric, small, with copious endosperm. Distribution. About 125 genera with approximately 3500 spp., predominantly woody, all over the world...|$|E
