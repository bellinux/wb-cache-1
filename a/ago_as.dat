5|$|Blue {{whales are}} {{rorquals}} (family Balaenopteridae), {{a family that}} includes the humpback whale, the fin whale, Bryde's whale, the sei whale, and the minke whale. The family Balaenopteridae {{is believed to have}} diverged from the other families of the suborder Mysticeti as long <b>ago</b> <b>as</b> the middle Oligocene (28 Ma ago). It is not known when the members of those families diverged from each other.|$|E

5|$|Coal {{has been}} mined around Worsley from as long <b>ago</b> <b>as</b> 1376, {{originally}} in bell pits. The coal seams {{in the area}} tend to be fairly thin, slanting downwards from north to south, and so deeper mining became necessary during the 17thcentury.|$|E
5|$|Fin {{whales are}} rorquals, {{members of the}} family Balaenopteridae, which also {{includes}} the humpback whale, the blue whale, Bryde's whale, the sei whale, and the minke whales. The family diverged from the other baleen whales in the suborder Mysticeti as long <b>ago</b> <b>as</b> the middle Miocene, although it is not known when the members of these families further evolved into their own species.|$|E
5|$|Humpback {{whales are}} {{rorquals}} (Balaenopteridae, {{a family that}} includes the blue, fin, Bryde's, sei and minke whales).

5|$|The {{great auk}} was a food source for Neanderthals more than 100,000 years <b>ago,</b> <b>as</b> {{evidenced}} by well-cleaned bones found by their campfires. Images believed {{to depict the}} great auk also were carved into {{the walls of the}} El Pendo Cave, Santander in Spain and Paglicci, Italy more than 35,000 years ago, and cave paintings 20,000 years old have been found in France's Grotte Cosquer.|$|E

5|$|Blowing from a gun was a {{reported}} means of execution as long <b>ago</b> <b>as</b> the 16th century, by the Mughal Empire, {{and was used}} until the 20th century. The method was utilized by Portuguese colonialists in the 16th and 17th centuries, from as early as 1509 across their empire from Ceylon (modern day Sri Lanka) to Mozambique to Brazil. The Mughals used the method throughout the 17th century and into the 18th, particularly against rebels.|$|E

5|$|During the Paleozoic era, {{the western}} part of what would become North America was near the equator and on a passive margin. The Cambrian Explosion of life took place over about 15million years {{in this part of the}} world. Climate was warm and invertebrates, such as the trilobites, were abundant. An ocean started to return to the Grand Canyon area from the west about 550million years <b>ago.</b> <b>As</b> its {{shoreline}} moved east, the ocean began to concurrently deposit the three formations of the Tonto Group.|$|E
5|$|Geologically, {{the canyon}} likely {{originated}} {{millions of years}} <b>ago</b> <b>as</b> the result of San Diego Creek cutting through the San Joaquin Hills. Uplift diverted that stream to its present course, leaving Laguna Canyon as a wind gap. California State Route 133 runs {{the entire length of}} the canyon connecting Laguna Beach and Irvine, while California State Route 73 crosses it, running southeast-northwest. A majority of the canyon is located within the Laguna Coast Wilderness Park; small portions are part of Aliso and Wood Canyons Wilderness Park and the cities of Irvine, Laguna Beach, Laguna Woods and Aliso Viejo.|$|E
5|$|Laboratory {{breeding}} {{experiments with}} it and other Omphalotus species have revealed {{a low level of}} compatibility (ability to breed and produce fertile hybrids), suggesting it is genetically distinct and has been isolated for a long time. It is particularly poorly compatible with O.illudens, the authors of the study suggesting the separation may have been as long <b>ago</b> <b>as</b> the Late Carboniferous separation of Gondwana from Laurasia but conceding the lack of any fossil record makes it impossible to know whether the genus even existed at the time.|$|E

5|$|Lake Manly and {{its sister}} lakes started {{to dry up}} about 10,000 years <b>ago</b> <b>as</b> the alpine glaciers that fed the rivers that filled the lakes {{disappeared}} and the region became increasingly arid. Fish that had migrated into the lake system from the Colorado River started to die off; the only survivors are the minnow-sized Death Valley pupfish and related species that adapted to living in springs. Ancient weak shorelines called strandlines from Lake Manly can easily be seen on a former island in the lake called Shoreline Butte.|$|E
5|$|Nueces Bay formed {{approximately}} 9,000 years <b>ago,</b> <b>as</b> the {{sea level}} rose {{at the conclusion}} of the last ice age. The sea level stabilized 6,000 years later, shaping the present-day Nueces Bay. The first human inhabitants were the nomadic Aransas Indians, who settled between the Copano and Baffin bays about 8,000 years ago, until 1300 CE. In the next century, the Karankawa Indians arrived, and were present when Europeans came ashore.|$|E
5|$|Paleontology lies on {{the border}} between biology and geology, but differs from {{archaeology}} in that it excludes the study of anatomically modern humans. It now uses techniques drawn {{from a wide range of}} sciences, including biochemistry, mathematics, and engineering. Use of all these techniques has enabled paleontologists to discover much of the evolutionary history of life, almost all the way back to when Earth became capable of supporting life, about 3.8 billion years <b>ago.</b> <b>As</b> knowledge has increased, paleontology has developed specialised sub-divisions, some of which focus on different types of fossil organisms while others study ecology and environmental history, such as ancient climates.|$|E
