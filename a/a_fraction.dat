5|$|The {{equatorial}} ring {{goes around}} {{the belly of the}} armillary sphere 91 and 5/19 (degrees) away from the pole. The circle of the ecliptic also goes round the belly of the instrument at an angle of 24 (degrees) with the equator.

Hence (the points) where the ecliptic and the equator intersect should give the north polar distances of the spring and autumn equinoxes. But now (it has been recorded that) the spring equinox is 90 and 1/4 (degrees) away from the pole, and the autumn equinox is 92 and 1/4 (degrees) away.

5|$|A radical {{strategy}} for avoiding predators which may otherwise kill {{a large majority}} of the emerging young of a population is to emerge very rarely, at irregular intervals. This strategy is seen in dramatic form in the periodical cicadas, which emerge at intervals of 13 or 17 years. Predators with a life-cycle of one or a few years are unable to reproduce rapidly enough in response to such an emergence, so predator satiation is a likely evolutionary explanation for the cicadas' unusual life-cycle, though not the only one. Predators may still feast on the emerging cicadas, but are unable to consume more than <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> of the brief surfeit of prey.|$|E

5|$|Although Disston's {{engineered}} canals aided {{water transport}} and steamboat traffic in Florida, he was ultimately unsuccessful in draining the Kissimmee River floodplain or lowering the surface water around Lake Okeechobee {{and in the}} Everglades.

Disston's immediate impact was in the Philadelphia area, where he was active in Republican politics and a philanthropist, but his legacy is often associated with the draining and development of Florida.|$|E
5|$|As {{a clandestine}} army {{operating}} in an enemy-occupied country, and separated by {{over a thousand}} kilometers from any friendly territory, the Home Army faced unique challenges in acquiring arms and equipment. It was able to overcome these difficulties to some extent and to field {{tens of thousands of}} armed soldiers. Nevertheless, the difficult conditions meant that only infantry forces armed with light weapons could be fielded. Any use of artillery, armor or aircraft was impossible (except for a few instances during the Warsaw Uprising, such as the Kubuś armored car). Even these light-infantry units were as a rule armed with a mixture of weapons of various types, usually in quantities sufficient to arm only <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> of a unit's soldiers.|$|E
40|$|Lipid A or lipid <b>A</b> <b>fractions</b> and liposomes {{containing}} lipid A {{were tested}} for the ability to gel Limulus amoebocyte lysates and for effects on intact Limulus amoebocytes. Liposomes having a relatively low concentration of lipid A did not produce coagulation of lysate and were designated as Limulus-negative, but liposomes having a high concentration of lipid A were Limulus-positive. Limulus-negative liposomes had no effect on intact amoebocytes. Limulus-positive liposomes caused a striking transformation in the appearance of amoebocytes in that the cells sent out long filamentous extensions that formed a tangled network of processes between cells. The filamentous projections were similar to those that have been previously observed in the presence of gram-negative bacteria. We conclude that amoebocytes have the ability to recognize Limulus-positive liposomes, but the lack of activation of Limulus lysate or the absence of amoebocyte recognition does not prove the absence of liposomal lipid A. We also found that individual lipid <b>A</b> <b>fractions</b> were heterogeneous in their ability to gel lysate. Of eight fractions tested, one (fraction 1) had no detectable activity above the background, and the seven others had activity that ranged from 10 -fold to 10, 000 -fold above the background. The heterogeneity of lipid <b>A</b> <b>fractions</b> detected in assays with amoebocyte lysate was consistent with the finding of heterogeneity in other functional assays of lipid <b>A</b> <b>fractions...</b>|$|R

After the commanding officer, Cunningham was the second man to fly it. The Beaufighter went through a teething stage in relation to its gun sight. The sight projected a ring of light with a spot at the centre onto a small sheet of glass {{directly in front of}} the pilots head.
