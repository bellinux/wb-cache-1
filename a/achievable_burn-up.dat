40|$|As {{early as}} the 1970 s, {{attempts}} were made to reduce the peak fuel temperature by means of so-called "wallpaper fuel", in which the fuel is arranged in a spherical shell within a pebble: By raising particle packing fraction, fuel kernels are condensed to the outer diameter of the fuel zone, leaving a central part of the pebble free of fuel. This modification prevents power generation in this central fuel-free zone and decreases temperature gradient across the pebble. Besides particle temperature reduction, the wallpaper concept also enhances neutronic performance through improved neutron economy, resulting in reduced fissile material and/or enrichment needs or providing the potential to achieve higher burn-up. To assess such improvements, calculations were performed using Monte Carlo neutron transport and depletion codes MCNP/MCB. Among others, investigations of conversion ratio, temperature coefficient of reactivity, spent fuel composition and neutron multiplication (for which a method to determine the six-factor formula was developed), were conducted. It is demonstrated that this fuel type impacts positively on the fuel cycle, reduces production of minor actinides (MA) and improves the safety-relevant parameters of the reactor. A comparison of these characteristics with PBMR-type fuel is presented: By comparison with PBMR fuel, the "wallpaper design" results in an effective neutron multiplication coefficient increase (by about 1750 pcm), which is combined with a decrease of between 4. 6 and 17. 5 % in MA production. An improved neutron economy of the heterogeneous design enables enrichment of the ¿wallpaper type¿ of fuel to be reduced by more than 6 %. The fuel changes suggested in this paper offer more versatility to the HTR concept: Conversion ratio can be decreased (leading to lower MA build-up and fuel reprocessing cost) or raised (leading to lower fuel consumption and fuel cost). Variations around this concept also enable higher reactivity, thus higher <b>achievable</b> <b>burn-up,</b> improving sustainability of HTRs. JRC. F. 4 -Safety of future nuclear reactor...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a desire}} to resolve fuel cycle issues for {{increasing}} the role of nuclear energy. The recent Laser Inertial Fusion-Fission Energy (LIFE) initiative that builds upon NIF ignition, is likely to rekindle national interest in developing intense, high power ion beam accelerators for fusion energy production and for fusion-fission hybrid concepts that combine an ion beam driven fusion neutron source with a fission blanket. While serving as a carbon-free energy source, hybrids offer the enormous potential benefit of transmuting the long-lived radioactive byproducts of fission-based nuclear reactors, thus dramatically reducing the nuclear waste problem. Systems with sufficiently efficient neutron sources to achieve deep or complete burn-up would {{eliminate the need for}} chemical separation reprocessing and make it possible to limit fuel shipments to non-weapons-usable materials, thus achieving a high level of proliferation resistance. In all inertial fusion energy (IFE) concepts, the driver and the reactor chamber are separate, which leads to savings in cost, improved access, ease of maintenance, and reduced concerns for safety and radiation contamination. For ion-driven fusion, the choice of accelerator has very significant consequences for the <b>achievable</b> energy gain, <b>burn-up</b> and the overall design and efficacy of an ion-driven hybri...|$|R
