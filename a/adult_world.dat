In Saharan and North African cultures, play is facilitated by children through the use of toys to enact scenes recognizable in their community such as hunting and herding. The value is placed in a realistic version of development in preparing a child for the future they are likely to grow up into. This allows the child to imagine and create a personal interpretation of how they view the <b>adult</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E

500|$|... "Indian Camp" [...] is an {{initiation}} story.

The story reaches a climax when Nick's [...] "heightened awareness" [...] of evil causes him to turn away from the experience.

Even before arrest, children who come into conflict with the law tend to represent the most disadvantaged and marginalized sectors of society.

500|$|The opera {{begins with}} a short, [...] "strenuous" [...] {{instrumental}} prelude, which forms {{the basis of the}} musical accompaniment to the opening congregational hymn; its first phrase is founded on a descending bass E-B-F, itself to become an important motif. Humphrey Carpenter notes that throughout the hymn the bass line is {{out of step with the}} singing, an effect which, he says, [...] "suggests an <b>adult</b> <b>world</b> where purity is unattainable". Following the hymn, the Voice of God is accompanied, as it is in all his pre-flood warnings and declamations, by the E-B-F notes from the opera's opening bass line, sounded on the timpani. After Noye's response in recitative, the next musical episode is the entry of Noye's children and their wives, a passage which, Carpenter suggests, replaces the pessimism of the adult word with [...] "the blissful optimism of childhood". The syncopated tune of the children's song is derived from the final line of Noye's recitative: [...] "As God has bidden us doe".|$|E

[...] Lat drew the children of Kampung Boy as [...] "mostly mop-topped, toothy, bare-bottomed or sarong-draped" [...] kids, who are often [...] "exaggeratedly dwarfed" [...] by items of the <b>adult</b> <b>world.</b> [...] He explained that the way the boys were drawn was partly due to the influence of comics he read in the 1950s; [...] "naughty ones with... bushy hair" [...] were prominent male protagonists in those books. [...] The adult characters are easily distinguished by their exaggerated clothing and accessories such as puffed out pants and butterfly glasses. [...] "Short and round" [...] shapes make the design of the characters distinctive. [...] These characters display exaggerated expressions, particularly when they are drawn to face the readers.|$|E
500|$|Early psychoanalytic critics saw {{the problem}} of Romeo and Juliet in terms of Romeo's impulsiveness, {{deriving}} from [...] "ill-controlled, partially disguised aggression", which leads both to Mercutio's death and to the double suicide. Romeo and Juliet is {{not considered to be}} exceedingly psychologically complex, and sympathetic psychoanalytic readings of the play make the tragic male experience equivalent with sicknesses. Norman Holland, writing in 1966, considers Romeo's dream as a realistic [...] "wish fulfilling fantasy both in terms of Romeo's <b>adult</b> <b>world</b> and his hypothetical childhood at stages oral, phallic and oedipal" [...] – while acknowledging that a dramatic character is not a human being with mental processes separate from those of the author. Critics such as Julia Kristeva focus on the hatred between the families, arguing that this hatred is the cause of Romeo and Juliet's passion for each other. That hatred manifests itself directly in the lovers' language: Juliet, for example, speaks of [...] "my only love sprung from my only hate" [...] and often expresses her passion through an anticipation of Romeo's death. This leads on to speculation as to the playwright's psychology, in particular to a consideration of Shakespeare's grief for the death of his son, Hamnet.|$|E

500|$|As McPherson stated, [...] "The {{journey to}} a distant goal, the return home, and the quest which {{involves}} the voyage out, achievement, and return are typical patterns in Black autobiography." [...] For Angelou, this quest took her from her childhood and adolescence, as described in her first two books, into the <b>adult</b> <b>world.</b> [...] The setting in Angelou's first two autobiographies was limited to three places (Arkansas, Missouri, and California), but the [...] "setting breaks open" [...] in Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas to include Europe as she traveled with her Porgy and Bess company. [...] McPherson saw Angelou's third autobiography as [...] "a sunny tour of Angelou's twenties", from early years marked by disappointments and humiliation, into the broader world—to the white world and to the international community. This period described [...] "years of joy", {{as well as the}} start of Angelou's great success and fulfillment as an entertainer. [...] Lupton stated that Angelou's travel narrative in Singin' and Swingin', which took up approximately 40 percent of the book, gave the book its organized structure. Angelou's observations about race, gender, and class made the book more than a simple travel narrative. As a Black American, her travels around the world put her in contact with many nationalities and classes, expanded her experiences beyond her familiar circle of community and family, and complicated her understandings of race relations.|$|E
500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review for Rolling Stone, Christopher Connelly called Thriller [...] "a zesty LP" [...] with a [...] "harrowing, dark message". He compared {{the songs on}} the album with the life challenges that the 24-year-old Jackson had faced since Off the Wall, while observing that he [...] "dropped the boyish falsetto" [...] and was facing his [...] "challenges head-on" [...] with [...] "a feisty determination" [...] and [...] "a full, adult voice". John Rockwell wrote in The New York Times that perhaps Jackson was a [...] "sometimes too practiced ... performer", that at times Quincy Jones may [...] "depersonalize his individuality" [...] with his [...] "slightly anonymous production", and that Jackson may be hiding his true emotions behind [...] "layers of impenetrable, gauzy veils". He nonetheless deemed Thriller [...] "a wonderful pop record, the latest statement {{by one of the}} great singers in popular music today" [...] and that there are [...] "hits here, too, lots of them". Rockwell believed it helped breach [...] "the destructive barriers that spring up regularly between white and black music", especially as [...] "white publications and radio stations that normally avoid black music seem willing to pretend he isn't black after all". In The Village Voice, Robert Christgau said [...] "this is virtually a hits-plus-filler job, but at such a high level it's almost classic anyway". He later wrote in retrospect, [...] "what we couldn't know is how brilliantly every hit but 'P.Y.T.' would thrive on mass exposure and public pleasure." [...] A year after the album's release, Time summed up the three main singles from the album, saying, [...] "The pulse of America and {{much of the rest of}} the world moves irregularly, beating in time to the tough strut of 'Billie Jean', the asphalt aria of 'Beat It', the supremely cool chills of 'Thriller'." [...] In 1989, Toronto Star music critics reflected on the albums they had reviewed in the past ten years in order to create a list judging them on the basis of [...] "commercial impact to social import, to strictly musical merit." [...] Thriller was placed at number 1 on the list, where it was referred to as his [...] "master work" [...] and that [...] "commercial success has since overshadowed Jackson's artistic accomplishments on Thriller, and that's a pity. It was a record for the times, brimming with breathless anticipation and a dread fear of the <b>adult</b> <b>world,</b> a brilliant fantasy that pumped with sexual heat, yet made room for serious reflection".|$|E
