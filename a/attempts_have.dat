5|$|A {{number of}} <b>attempts</b> <b>have</b> {{been made to}} explain the link between altered brain {{function}} and schizophrenia. One {{of the most common}} is the dopamine hypothesis, which attributes psychosis to the mind's faulty interpretation of the misfiring of dopaminergic neurons.|$|E

5|$|<b>Attempts</b> <b>have</b> {{been made}} to {{introduce}} H.gammarus to New Zealand, alongside other European species such as the edible crab, Cancer pagurus. Between 1904 and 1914, one million lobster larvae were released from hatcheries in Dunedin, but the species did not become established there.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the urban}} legend, this {{impulsive}} maneuver cost the team greatly, beginning the Curse of the Colonel, which states that the Tigers will not win the championship again until the statue is recovered. Subsequently, numerous <b>attempts</b> <b>have</b> been made to recover the statue, often {{as part of a}} variety TV show. Most of the statue was recovered in March 2009.|$|E
5|$|<b>Attempts</b> <b>have</b> {{been made}} to date recessions in America {{beginning}} in 1790. These periods of recession were not identified until the 1920s. To construct the dates, researchers studied business annals during the period and constructed time series of the data. The earliest recessions {{for which there is}} the most certainty are those that coincide with major financial crises.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{diversity}} of the originally broadly defined Liliaceae s.l., many <b>attempts</b> <b>have</b> been made to form suprageneric classifications, e.g. subfamilies and tribes. Classifications published since the use of molecular methods in phylogenetics have taken a narrower view of the Liliaceae (Liliaceae s.s.). The Angiosperm Phylogeny Website (APweb) recognizes three subfamilies, one of which is divided into two tribes.|$|E
5|$|Fauré {{revised and}} {{enlarged}} the Requiem {{in the years}} between its first performance in 1888 and {{the publication of the}} final version in 1901. The latter is scored for full orchestra; since the 1970s <b>attempts</b> <b>have</b> been made by several Fauré scholars to reconstruct the composer's earlier versions, scored for smaller orchestral forces.|$|E
5|$|In Ethiopia, {{there are}} several {{varieties}} of sheep landrace. <b>Attempts</b> <b>have</b> been made to classify the sheep based on factors such as tail shape and wool type, and H. Epstein made an attempt at classifying them this way by dividing the breeds into 14 types based on those two factors. However, in 2002, further genetic analysis revealed {{that there are only}} four distinct varieties of Ethiopian sheep: short-fat-tailed, long-fat-tailed, fat-rumped, and thin-tailed.|$|E

5|$|Many subgenres {{of heavy}} metal {{developed}} {{outside of the}} commercial mainstream during the 1980s such as crossover thrash. Several <b>attempts</b> <b>have</b> been made to map the complex world of underground metal, most notably by the editors of AllMusic, as well as critic Garry Sharpe-Young. Sharpe-Young's multivolume metal encyclopedia separates the underground into five major categories: thrash metal, death metal, black metal, power metal, and the related subgenres of doom and gothic metal.|$|E

5|$|The tarpan or European {{wild horse}} (Equus ferus ferus) {{was found in}} Europe and much of Asia. It survived into the {{historical}} era, but became extinct in 1909, when the last captive died in a Russian zoo. Thus, the genetic line was lost. <b>Attempts</b> <b>have</b> been made to recreate the tarpan, which resulted in horses with outward physical similarities, but nonetheless descended from domesticated ancestors and not true wild horses.|$|E
5|$|While {{significant}} <b>attempts</b> <b>have</b> {{been made}} recently {{to identify the}} exact locations of the individual Upanishads, the results are tentative. Witzel identifies the center of activity in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad as the area of Videha, whose king, Janaka, features prominently in the Upanishad. The Chandogya Upanishad was probably composed in a more western than eastern location in the Indian subcontinent, possibly somewhere in the western region of the Kuru-Panchala country.|$|E
5|$|<b>Attempts</b> <b>have</b> {{been made}} to {{establish}} the exact date of Good Friday by assuming that the darkness described at Jesus's crucifixion was a solar eclipse. This research has not yielded conclusive results, and Good Friday is recorded as being at Passover, which is held {{at the time of}} a full moon. Further, the darkness lasted from the sixth hour to the ninth, or three hours, which is much, much longer than the eight-minute upper limit for any solar eclipse's totality. In the Western hemisphere, there are few reliable records of eclipses before 800 AD, until the advent of Arab and monastic observations in the early medieval period. The first recorded observation of the corona was made in Constantinople in 968 AD.|$|E

5|$|Since first {{coming to}} wide {{notice in the}} late 1990s, the Harry Potter book series by J. K. Rowling has engendered a number of legal disputes. Rowling, her various {{publishers}} and Time Warner, {{the owner of the}} rights to the Harry Potter films, have taken numerous legal actions to protect their copyrights, and also have fielded accusations of copyright theft themselves. The worldwide popularity of the Harry Potter series has led to the appearance of a number of locally produced, unauthorised sequels and other derivative works, sparking efforts to ban or contain them. While these legal proceedings have countered a number of cases of outright piracy, other <b>attempts</b> <b>have</b> targeted not-for-profit endeavours and have been criticised.|$|E
5|$|The 20th century revived {{interest}} in Cofresí's piracy {{as a tourist}} attraction, with municipalities in Puerto Rico highlighting their historical connection to the pirates. By {{the second half of}} the century, beaches and sports teams (especially in his native Cabo Rojo, which features a monument in his honor) were named for him; in the Dominican Republic, a resort town was named after the pirate. Cofresí's name has been commercialized, with a number of products and businesses adopting it and its associated legends. Puerto Rico's first flag carrier seaplane was named for him. Several <b>attempts</b> <b>have</b> been made to portray Cofresí's life on film, based on legend.|$|E
5|$|Tigers {{have been}} studied in the wild {{using a variety of}} techniques. The populations of tigers have been {{estimated}} using plaster casts of their pugmarks, although this method was criticised as being inaccurate. More recent <b>attempts</b> <b>have</b> been made using camera trapping and studies on DNA from their scat, while radio collaring has been used to track tigers in the wild. Tiger spray {{has been found to be}} just as good, or better, as a source of DNA as scat.|$|E
