5|$|Analogously, the <b>alternating</b> {{group is}} a {{subgroup}} of index 2 in the symmetric group on n letters. The elements of the <b>alternating</b> group, called even permutations, are the products of even numbers of transpositions. The identity map, an empty product of no transpositions, is an even permutation since zero is even; it is the identity element of the group.|$|E
5|$|In {{engineering}} or household applications, {{current is}} often described as being either direct current (DC) or <b>alternating</b> current (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative. If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. <b>Alternating</b> current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this {{takes the form of a}} sine wave. <b>Alternating</b> current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an <b>alternating</b> current is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. <b>Alternating</b> current is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct current, such as inductance and capacitance. These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to transients, such as when first energised.|$|E

5|$|Westinghouse Electric asked Tesla to {{participate}} in the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago where the company had a large space in a building devoted to electrical exhibits. Westinghouse Electric won the bid to light the Exposition with <b>alternating</b> current and it was a key event in the history of AC power, as the company demonstrated to the American public the safety, reliability, and efficiency of a fully integrated <b>alternating</b> current system. Tesla showed a series of electrical effects related to <b>alternating</b> current as well as his wireless lighting system, using a demonstration he had previously performed throughout America and Europe; these included using high-voltage, high-frequency <b>alternating</b> current to light a wireless gas-discharge lamp.|$|E

5|$|Although Mars has no {{evidence}} of a structured global magnetic field, observations show that parts of the planet's crust have been magnetized, suggesting that <b>alternating</b> polarity reversals of its dipole field have occurred in the past. This paleomagnetism of magnetically susceptible minerals is similar to the <b>alternating</b> bands found on Earth's ocean floors. One theory, published in 1999 and re-examined in October 2005 (with the help of the Mars Global Surveyor), is that these bands suggest plate tectonic activity on Mars four billion years ago, before the planetary dynamo ceased to function and the planet's magnetic field faded.|$|E
