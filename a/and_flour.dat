40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to evaluate the ability of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to differentiate rice macromolecules and to calculate the surface composition of rice kernels <b>and</b> <b>flours.</b> The uncooked kernels <b>and</b> <b>flours</b> surface composition of the two selected rice varieties, Thadokkham- 11 (TDK 11) and Doongara (DG) demonstrated an over-expression of lipids and proteins and an under-expression of starch compared to the bulk composition. The results of the study showed that XPS was able to differentiate rice polysaccharides (mainly starch), proteins and lipids in uncooked rice kernels <b>and</b> <b>flours.</b> Nevertheless, it was unable to distinguish components in cooked rice samples possibly due to complex interactions between gelatinized starch, denatured proteins and lipids.

Of the Skopje Muslim population of the late Ottoman period German linguist Gustav Weigand noted that though most were Albanians regarded as Turks or Ottomans (Osmanli), they spoke Turkish in public and Albanian at home.

In a meeting on June 6, 1775, the townspeople voted against doing business with Jones.

5|$|The {{development}} of sawmills <b>and</b> <b>flour</b> mills at the falls spurred demand for railroad service to Minneapolis. In 1868, Minneapolis was only {{served by a}} spur from St. Paul, from the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad, and by the fledgling St. Paul and Pacific Railroad. Minneapolis millers found that railroads based in Milwaukee and Chicago were favoring their cities by diverting wheat from Minneapolis mills. In response, the owners of several Minneapolis mills chartered the Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway, which would connect the Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad through Minneapolis to the Iowa border. Meanwhile, Jay Cooke {{took control of the}} St. Paul and Pacific Railroad in 1871 with the goal of aggregating it into the Northern Pacific Railway. Bad economic conditions caused the Panic of 1873, and the Northern Pacific had to relinquish control of the St. Paul and Pacific Railroad and the Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad.|$|E
5|$|The {{total cost}} of the {{expedition}} was estimated at £90,000 (2009 equivalent about £7.25 million), of which £45,000 was offered by the British Government provided that the two Societies could raise a matching sum. They achieved this, thanks largely to a donation of £25,000 from wealthy RGS member Llewellyn W. Longstaff. The RGS itself contributed £8,000, its largest single contribution to any expedition to that date, and £5,000 came from Alfred Harmsworth, later Lord Northcliffe, who had earlier financed the Jackson-Harmsworth expedition to the Arctic, 1894–97. The rest was raised from smaller donations. The expedition also benefited from significant commercial sponsorship: Colman's provided mustard <b>and</b> <b>flour,</b> Cadbury's gave 3,500lb (1,600kg) of chocolate, Bird's donated baking and custard powders, Evans, Lescher & Webb provided all the lime juice.

40|$|A shrimp feed formulation, {{consisting}} of fishmeal, squid meal, prawn head meal, soybean meal, cereal flour (different sources), fish oil, lecithin and other feed additives {{was selected for}} evaluating aquastability of different sources of starch namely, corn flour, maida flour, rice <b>flour,</b> tapioca <b>flour</b> <b>and</b> wheat <b>flour</b> as binders at 15. 3 % each in combination with guar gum at three levels of 1, 2 and 3 %. The feed pellets were prepared (3 - 5 mm length, 3 mm diameter) by adding 40 ml water for 100 g dry powdered feed mix followed by steaming, pelleting in hand pelletizer and drying at 70 o C. The aqua-stability of feed pellets was determined by measuring the loss in weight of pellets soaked in water and the turbidity of water as Nephlometer reading (NMR). Among the starch sources tested, maida flour in combination with 2 % guar gum in the feed imparted better aqua-stability to pellets followed by tapioca flour, rice <b>flour,</b> wheat <b>flour</b> <b>and</b> corn <b>flour.</b> Further {{increase in the level}} of guar gum in feed had no beneficial effect. It was observed that pellets containing guar gum rapidly swelled and developed cracks and these effects were higher with increase in guar gum level. Feed pellets containing wheat <b>flour</b> <b>and</b> tapioca <b>flour</b> showed highest Nephlometer reading (water turbidity), while pellets with maida flour showed the least NMR followed by corn <b>flour</b> <b>and</b> rice <b>flour.</b> While addition of 1 % guar gum considerably reduced the NMR of tapioca <b>flour</b> <b>and</b> wheat <b>flour,</b> incorporation of 2 % guar gum resulted in the least NMR reading of pellets with wheat <b>flour</b> <b>and</b> maida <b>flour.</b> However, further increase in guar gum (3 %) has no beneficial effect. But raising guar gum level to 3 % decreased the NMR reading in the case of tapioca <b>flour</b> <b>and</b> increased the NMR of rice <b>flour</b> <b>and</b> corn <b>flour.</b> Feed pellets of the same shrimp feed formulation containing wheat flour along with 2 % guar gum and processed in a commercial scale ring-die pellet mill having three stage conditioners and steam injection facility, showed good water stability up to 4 hours (79. 5 % stability) ...|$|R

40|$|Twenty-six {{samples of}} hybrid maizes (ROSSO flint maize, VOLGA dent maize, DEA and MONARQUE flint-dent maizes) were dry-milled and {{separated}} into fractions. The milling yield was determined. Particle size {{was measured by}} mechanical sieving for grits, and by laser diffraction for coarse and fine semolina <b>and</b> <b>flours.</b> Bimodal particle size distributions of fine semolina <b>and</b> <b>flours</b> were analyzed {{as a function of}} mode size and proportion. Despite inherent variations in culture conditions, differences were apparent between VOLGA and the three other hybrids. The principal mode was characteristic of the fraction considered, without clear varietal differentiation. Analysis of the secondary mode of fine semolina <b>and</b> <b>flours</b> showed that it was principally due to particles similar in size to starch granules (14 to 17 /*m), VOLGA particles being smaller than the others. The relative "weight" of the secondary mode was greater with VOLGA than with the three other maize types. The small differences observed between DEA and the ROSSO and MONARQUE hybrids were not significant. A technological behaviour index is proposed: the calculated quantity (g) of very fine particles constituting the secondary modes of fine semolina <b>and</b> <b>flours</b> (per 1 g of ground maize). This index is inversely correlated with the yield of grits (r= 0. 913 for the 26 samples), and may therefore prove useful in the cultivation and processing of maize...|$|R
