5000|$|Thermal Wheel, or Rotary heat exchanger: A slowly {{rotating}} {{matrix of}} finely corrugated metal, operating in both opposing airstreams. When the <b>air</b> <b>handling</b> <b>unit</b> is in heating mode, heat is absorbed as air {{passes through the}} matrix in the exhaust airstream, during one half rotation, and released {{during the second half}} rotation into the supply airstream in a continuous process.

50|$|Air {{handlers}} {{may need}} to provide heating, cooling, or both to change the supply air temperature, and humidity level depending on the location and the application. Such conditioning is provided by heat exchanger coil(s) within the <b>air</b> <b>handling</b> <b>unit</b> air stream, such coils may be direct or indirect {{in relation to the}} medium providing the heating or cooling effect.|$|E

50|$|Air {{supply to}} a {{building}} is generally performed by an <b>air</b> <b>handling</b> <b>unit.</b> The process may include for filtering, heating, cooling, humidification, or dehumidification, {{all of which}} processes consume energy. Since the fresh air demand for the building occupants may be less than that is required for air conditioning purposes, it would be wasteful if 100% fresh air were used, with wholesome treated air rejected to the atmosphere in its place. Therefore, mixing is used to balance the needs between the occupants requirements for fresh air and the air conditioning process for the building.|$|E
50|$|An air handler, or <b>air</b> <b>handling</b> <b>unit</b> (often {{abbreviated}} to AHU), is a device used to regulate and circulate air {{as part of}} a heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system. An air handler is usually a large metal box containing a blower, heating or cooling elements, filter racks or chambers, sound attenuators, and dampers. Air handlers usually connect to a ductwork ventilation system that distributes the conditioned air through the building and returns it to the AHU. Sometimes AHUs discharge (supply) and admit (return) air directly to and from the space served without ductwork.|$|E

5000|$|UFAD systems rely on air {{handling}} units to filter and condition air to the appropriate supply conditions {{so it can be}} delivered to the occupied zone. While overhead systems typically use ducts to distribute the air, UFAD systems use the underfloor plenum formed by installation of a raised floor. The plenum generally sits 0.3 and 0.46 m above the structural concrete slab, although lower heights are possible. Specially designed floor diffusers are used as the supply outlets. [...] The most common UFAD configuration consists of a central <b>air</b> <b>handling</b> <b>unit</b> delivering air through a pressurized plenum and into the space through floor diffusers. Other approaches may incorporate fan powered terminal units at the outlets, underfloor ducts, desktop vents or connections to Personal Environmental Control Systems.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} {{was designed to}} be triangular in shape because it would allow 20% more of the office area to enjoy the harbour view as compared with a square or rectangular shaped buildings. From an architectural point of view, this arrangement provides better floor area utilisation, offering an internal column-free office area with a clear depth of 9 to 13.4 m and an overall usable floor area efficiency of 81%.Nonetheless, the triangular building plan causes the <b>air</b> <b>handling</b> <b>unit</b> (AHU) room in the internal core to also assume a triangular configuration. With only limited space, this makes the adoption of a standard AHU not feasible. Furthermore, all air-conditioning ducting, electrical trunking and piping gathered inside the core area has to be squeezed into a very narrow and congested corridor ceiling void.|$|E
50|$|Traditional {{control valve}} sizing for {{constant}} flow systems involves a Kv calculation, actual pressure drop calculation and {{a check to}} ensure minimum valve authority is met. This method is complicated and inflexible, as the changes in design flow, circuit pressure, and required pressure drops can change the required valve, and reduce control-ability. This method also relies on having the correct design information. Pressure independent control valves are used to limit the flow to the fan coil terminal and <b>air</b> <b>handling</b> <b>unit.</b> This flow is not affected by changes in inlet pressure. A diaphragm within the valve keeps the outlet pressure constant, and this delivers a constant flow to the terminal. The added advantage of pressure independent control valves is that, when fitted with an actuator, they replace the manual balancing valve and motorized control valve with a single valve, thus reducing installation cost.|$|E
