2500|$|But that I didn’t {{appreciate}} {{the techniques of}} playwriting from just listening it was certainly kind of him and I certainly often went to his room to listen to and discuss drama. The following summer, July if I remember correctly, I went as usual to visit him when Mr. Aston, laughing, said ‘similarly you don’t know about this person’s publications’ <b>and</b> <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> five books containing six volumes in temporary bindings which had been published. They, the Kawatake Mokuami script series, had been published as articles by the Ginza’s Kabuki Shinpō [...] (Kabuki News) Company. They covered ‘Nakamitsu’, ‘Four Thousand Ryō‘ (...) (in Japanese) and ‘’. When I went I {{had no idea that}} they had been successively published and had been delivered from a Ginza bookstore.

2500|$|The Australian {{said that}} the {{production}} team The Neptunes were to work with Aguilera on the album. In an interview with HitQuarters, Dr. Dre protege Focus... said, [...] "We did a song and an interlude together." [...] He produced the beats for the track [...] "Sex for Breakfast," [...] which were then worked on by Aguilera and producer Noel [...] "Detail" [...] Fisher. Focus... got involved with the project because he and Aguilera share a loyal, long-time engineer in Oscar Ramirez; Ramirez suggested and arranged the pairing. Of the experience Focus... commented, [...] " [...] knows exactly what she is looking for and {{is not afraid to}} tell you. It was the first project I've ever worked on where someone sent me examples <b>and</b> <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> exact parts in the song they were looking for." [...] Aguilera announced on her E! special {{that she was going to}} be working with American dance-punk band Le Tigre. Aguilera said in August 2009, that she co-wrote tracks with British Tamil songwriter M.I.A. and Santigold, and according to the producer Tricky Stewart, Flo Rida would be featured on the album. Producer Polow da Don, who produced two of the four singles released from the project, was the only producer to be suggested by RCA and not contacted by Aguilera personally. Additionally Stewart and Claude Kelly wrote the song [...] "Glam", which was described as [...] "a hard club song that's about high fashion. It's really for the ladies about getting dressed and looking your best, working it in the club and getting glam and sexy before you go out. ... It will surprise people. I'm calling it a modern day [...] "Vogue." [...] I wouldn't say it unless I believed it." [...] Kelly also co-wrote three other tracks for the album, including the first two singles [...] "Not Myself Tonight" [...] and [...] "Woohoo". He described the four tracks as being [...] "up-tempo and fun, they're party anthems but at the same time have underlying messages." [...] Commenting on the experience of working with Aguilera, Kelly said, [...] "What people don't know about her is that she's actually a really good writer. She has good ideas, good melodies, good concepts ... She's really involved from the very beginning to the very end." ...|$|E
