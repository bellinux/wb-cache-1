40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} predict the {{characteristics}} of the machined part, such as geometry, surface roughness and fatigue or corrosion resistance, the cutting forces values should be known as precisely as possible. The edge discretisation methodology can be used to model the three components of the cutting forces. The results are generally considered as suitable, even if the considered cutting operation is complex, because the geometry is well described. Usually, the local cutting forces model is identified from orthogonal or oblique cutting tests and the local contributions are assumed to be independent of the orientation of the elementary edge in the reference plane Pr. However, when turning in the tool nose or with round inserts, the tool cutting edge angle Kr (or Side Cutting Edge Angle) evolves along the <b>active</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> and the values of this angle are very small compared to that of 90 ° used in orthogonal/oblique cutting. For this study, a new elementary cutting operation, called "oriented cutting", has been tested. In this configuration, the <b>active</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> is rectilinear, without inclination, but oriented by an angle Kr different from 90 °. In addition, cylindrical turning tests have been done. The measurements, performed in pure copper, show an influence of the tool cutting edge angle on the cutting forces. An interaction between Kr and the workpiece radius is also highlighted...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{a new and}} {{innovative}} method for the patterning of grinding wheels is presented. The patterns are machined with a patterning tool by using fly-cutting kinematics. By changing the patterning process parameters, different pattern sizes and densities can be machined in a flexible way. Surface and cylindrical grinding experiments show that grinding with patterned grinding wheels can significantly reduce process forces, grinding burn, and grinding power. The surface roughness increases because less <b>active</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> remain when grinding with patterned wheels. But especially for roughing processes, the results show great potential for increasing the overall grinding performance. The final publication is available at Springer via [URL]...|$|R

Specifically, analytical expressions for the inclination and rake angles of the tip are derived. The validity of the models was confirmed through their application to plausible needle tip geometries such as: flat, cylindrical and helical tips.

40|$|Carbon {{and glass}} fibre {{reinforced}} polymers {{are applied to}} an increasing degree in the major industries, like automotive and aircraft industry. These materials are usually machined using cutting tools. Twist drills for instance are used for inserting drill holes to join components. These tools are subjected to a high wear and rounding of the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> due to the highly abrasive nature of the fibre content. In contrast, the use of diamond mounted points can be a promising option for inserting drill holes. The hollow structure of these tools significantly reduces the amount of material to be removed. Apart from that, diamond tools exhibit a high wear resistance to abrasive wear. The loss of a few individual diamond grains can be compensated {{by virtue of the}} high number of <b>active</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edges,</b> especially by the self-sharpening effect of sintered mounted points.

However, situations exist in which this ordinary tone is insufficient, and must be raised. These situations are the primary sources underlying activation” (Luria 1973, p. 52). Luria’s unique approach to explaining the functional interactions within the nervous system has been the framework of neuropsychological models of emotion and arousal. However, the application of this theoretical approach is incomplete.

40|$|In this paper, an {{analysis}} of various factors affecting machined surface texture is presented. The investigation was focused on ball end mill inclination against the work piece (defined by surface inclination angle α. Surface roughness was investigated in a 3 D array, and measurements were conducted parallel to the feed motion direction. The analysis of machined surface irregularities {{as a function of}} frequency (wavelength λ), {{on the basis of the}} Power Density Spectrum – PDS was also carried out. This kind of analysis is aimed at valuation of primary factors influencing surface roughness generation as well as its randomness. Subsequently, a surface roughness model including cutter displacements was developed. It was found that plain cutting with ball end mill (surface inclination angle α = 0 °) is unfavorable from the point of view of surface roughness, because in cutter’s axis the cutting speed vc ≈ 0 m/min. This means that a cutting process does not occur, whereas on the machined surface some characteristics marks can be found. These marks do not appear in case of α ≠ 0 °, because the cutting speed vc ≠ 0 on the full length of the <b>active</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> and as a result, the machined surface texture is more homogenous. Surface roughness parameters determined on the basis of the model including cutter displacements are closer to experimental data for cases with inclination angles α ≠ 0 °, in comparison with those determined for plain cutting (α = 0 °). It is probably caused by highe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractHigh-performance {{materials}} with excellent heat resistance {{are necessary to}} meet future demands on improving the efficiency of energy converting technologies {{in the field of}} power plant construction and aviation industry. Nickel base super alloys can meet these demands to a large extent. However, their excellent corrosion resistance and heat resistance as well as hardness and wear resistance have an adverse effect on the machinability with geometrically defined cutting edges. High local thermal and mechanical stress leads to short tool life and long non-productive time for the tool change. Along with a 90 % decrease of cutting speed in comparison to conventional steel machining, cutting of nickel base super alloys demands for more efficient machining processes. One attempt to reduce thermal loads of the tool is machining with rotary tools, where a round indexable insert is mounted on a rotating axis. While machining the workpiece, the rotation of the cutting insert constantly exchanges the <b>active</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> section. This allows for a better cooling of the temporarily inactive sections. Also tool wear is distributed equally along the circumference instead of using discrete positions only. In this paper two different types of rotary tools, a self-propelled rotary tool (SPRT) and an actively driven rotary tool (ADRT), are presented. In a series of experiments the influence of the modification of process parameters, penetration angle and tool rotation to the characterization of the surface area of the workpiece, stability of the cutting process and economic efficiency was investigated. Finally a process model was developed as a user-oriented guideline for turning the nickel base super alloy Inconel 718 with rotating indexable inserts...|$|E

40|$|In microdrilling, {{because of}} lower feed, the microdrill <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> radius is {{comparable}} to the chip thickness. The <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> therefore should be regarded as rounded edges, which results in a more complex cutting mechanism. Because of this, the macrodrilling thrust modeling is not suitable for microdrilling.

The thrust is modeled in three parts: major <b>cutting</b> <b>edges,</b> secondary <b>cutting</b> <b>edge,</b> and indentation zone. Based on slip-line field theory, the major <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> and secondary <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> are divided into elements, and the elemental forces are determined by an oblique cutting model and an orthogonal model, respectively.
