5|$|The {{existence}} of the Book of the Dead was known {{as early as the}} Middle Ages, well before its contents could be understood.

5|$|Becoming {{increasingly}} belligerent {{toward his}} father, Riley {{moved out of}} the family home and briefly had a job painting houses before leaving Greenfield in November 1870.

The job provided little income and he returned to Greenfield in March 1871 where he started an apprenticeship to a painter.

5|$|By 2011, {{several of}} the {{strippers}} JC's Girls members had spoken with in San Diego had begun attending <b>a</b> <b>Bible</b> study hosted by the organization and the chapter had helped one stripper leave the sex industry and gain unrelated employment. In March 2011, the chapter sent a delegation to Adultcon at the Los Angeles Convention Center, where Scher and Brown spoke with conference attendees and offered them prayer. That July, Veitch resigned from JC's Girls so she could {{spend more time with}} her family, handing the leadership of the organization to Scher and Brown. In June 2012, Scher gave up her co-leadership of the organization to focus on her family, leaving the leadership to Brown. By 2013, the organization had established guidelines regulating the transition of women from the sex industry into participation in the evangelistic activities of JC's Girls. The woman must consistently attend <b>a</b> <b>Bible</b> study for four months, read Francine Rivers' book Redeeming Love, and be interviewed by the chapter's leaders, who then decide whether the woman should join the organization's outreach team. These guidelines were established because some women who had quickly gone from working in the sex industry to evangelizing with JC's Girls soon left the organization and returned to the sex industry. Brown left JC's Girls in April 2014 and Laura Bonde took over leadership of the organization.|$|E

5|$|Protestants had {{received}} services from itinerant ministers {{in the late}} 1790s, but the Spanish required them to move to American territory until after the Louisiana Purchase. After the purchase, the Baptist missionary John Mason Peck built the first Protestant church in St. Louis in 1818. Methodist ministers reached the town {{during the early years}} after the purchase, but only formed a congregation in 1821. The Presbyterian Church in St. Louis began as <b>a</b> <b>Bible</b> reading society in 1811, and in December 1817 members organized a church and built a chapel late the next year. A fourth Protestant group to take root was the Episcopal Church, founded in 1825.|$|E

Children were forbidden to play games and required to carry <b>a</b> <b>Bible</b> wherever they went. Mackay remained minister on St Kilda for 24 years.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1940s Benjamin Britten had {{established}} himself as a leading composer of English opera, with several major works to his credit. In 1947 he suggested to his librettist Eric Crozier that they should create a children's opera, based on <b>a</b> <b>bible</b> story. Crozier gave Britten a copy of Pollard's book, as a possible source of material. Nothing came of this project immediately; instead, Britten and Crozier wrote the cantata Saint Nicolas (1948), the first of several works in which Britten combined skilled performers with amateurs. The cantata involves at least two children's choirs, and incorporates two congregational hymns sung by the audience. Britten also used this fusion of professional with amateur forces in The Little Sweep (1949), which forms the second part of his entertainment for children, Let's Make an Opera, that he devised with Crozier. Again, child singers (also doubling as actors) were used, and the audience sings choruses at appropriate points. In 1952, although Britten's collaboration with Crozier had ended, he used the Chester plays book as the source text for his Canticle II, based on the story of Abraham and Isaac.|$|E
5|$|In 1834, Waller went to New York City to be a tutor, {{but left}} after {{three or four}} weeks. This {{was the last time}} in his life that he was paid as a teacher but he still opened and funded some schools. He opened a {{classical}} school in Bloomsburg, which was built in 1839, and he contributed $3500 to it. Shortly after arriving in Bloomsburg, he organized a singing school and also created <b>a</b> <b>Bible</b> class in 1839. The class continued until after his death. He helped to open Bloomsburg's State Normal School. He was appointed a trustee of Lafayette College in 1849 by the Synod of Philadelphia. He held that position until 1879. He was also on Lafayette College's Ways and Means committee and helped stop the college from closing in 1852. In 1856, Waller helped convert a classical school into the Bloomsburg Literary Institute and served as one of the nine initial trustees. He resigned from being a trustee in 1866 after a dispute about where to set up a new building for the institute. Despite resigning from the trustees, he helped conduct the opening ceremony of the institute's new building on April 3, 1867.|$|E
5|$|In 1842 the Treaty of Nanking was concluded, which {{included}} among its provisions {{the creation of}} treaty ports in which Christian missionaries {{would be free to}} preach. Xiamen (then known as Amoy) was one of these treaty ports, and British, Canadian and American missionaries moved in to start preaching to the local inhabitants. These missionaries, housed in the cantonment of Gulangyu, created reference works and religious tracts, including <b>a</b> <b>bible</b> translation. Naturally, they based the pronunciation of their romanization on the speech of Xiamen, which became the de facto standard when they eventually moved into other areas of the Hokkien Sprachraum, most notably Taiwan. The 1858 Treaty of Tianjin officially opened Taiwan to western missionaries, and missionary societies were quick to send men to work in the field, usually after a sojourn in Xiamen to acquire the rudiments of the language.|$|E
