5|$|I am not {{too sure}} if John {{actually}} fully {{understood what he}} was saying. He knew he was onto something when he saw those words and turned them into a song. But to have experienced what the lyrics in that song are actually <b>about?</b> <b>I</b> don't know if he fully understood it.|$|E
25|$|When I am in my painting, I'm {{not aware}} of what I'm doing. It is only after a sort of 'get acquainted' period that I see what I have been <b>about.</b> <b>I</b> have no fear of making changes, {{destroying}} the image, etc., because the painting has {{a life of its}} own. I try to let it come through. It is only when I lose contact with the painting that the result is a mess. Otherwise there is pure harmony, an easy give and take, and the painting comes out well.|$|E
25|$|Nowhere has Channel Nine {{ever talked}} the one-day game down, nowhere have we ever {{said this is}} a 'B team'. It's rubbish and George should stick to playing cricket and leave (television) rights to the people who know what they're talking <b>about.</b> <b>I</b> reckon he's got his hands full as it is. He needs to {{concentrate}} on staying in the side. And he needs to understand where his money's coming from. Without the TV rights deal, George is probably working in a coalmine or flipping burgers at McDonald's.|$|E

25|$|Lake {{expressed}} interest in renegotiating her deal with Paramount:The studio feels that way about it too. They have indicated {{they are going to}} fuss more about the pictures in which I appear. I think I'll enjoy being fussed <b>about...</b> <b>I</b> want this to be the turning point and I think that it will. I am free and clear of unpleasant characters, unless they are strongly justified. I've had a varied experience playing them and also appearing as heroines. The roles themselves haven't been noteworthy and sometimes not even especially spotlighted, but I think they've all been beneficial in one way or another. From here on there should be a certain pattern of development, and that is what I am going to fight for if necessary, though I don't believe it will be because they are so understanding here at Paramount.|$|E
500|$|Described as Andrew Schwab's opus {{the record}} {{promises}} to be a fresh take on the P86 sound. Schwab said, [...] "On this record I was really able to take the reins of the creative process in a direction I was passionate <b>about.</b> <b>I</b> was able to write songs that pushed me to grow as an artist. It was also insanely fun to have so many of my friends involved in the process and {{at this point in the}} game that is what its <b>about.</b> <b>I</b> am really looking forward to people hearing this album." [...] With concert goers noting the new energy of the songs and new band members Scott Davis on drums, Dustinn Lowry on guitar and Mikee [...] "Norman" [...] Williams on bass it seems P86 has benefited from a back to basics reinvention.|$|E
500|$|Vanilla Ice {{stated that}} [...] "It's {{unbelievable}} how {{this whole thing}} just came <b>about.</b> <b>I</b> really {{believe that it was}} an action of God. God pushing my wave and riding it. And Ross is one of those people and Monty is one of those people that God put {{in front of me and}} I'm being blessed right now." ...|$|E

500|$|... is {{definitely}} an evolution. It is bolder than {{the music on}} my previous albums because I’m bolder. The more mature I become and the more life experiences I have, the more I have to talk <b>about.</b> <b>I</b> really focused on songs being classics, songs that would last, songs that I could sing when I’m 40 and when I’m 60.|$|E
500|$|... "10 Boxes: Everything I've Ever Thought <b>About,</b> <b>I</b> Put Inside a Box" [...] in 2000 was Wong's {{first solo}} exhibition. The series of ten sculptures, housed in {{wall-mounted}} boxes, each having its own name, explores a different theme or spatial relationship. For example, Office Block symbolises the power structures within companies; Only You {{is based on}} romantic relations; Destroy Them treats subjects like education and childhood influences.|$|E
500|$|... "I {{had some}} very {{specific}} ideas in mind, music that would {{stand on its own}} as well as support and enhance what was happening on screen {{and the only way to}} make that a reality was to have a hand in writing the tunes myself. [...] The songs aren't necessarily about Nikki [...] or written to be sung by someone like her, but there's a spirit to this music that captures both what the film and the characters are <b>about,</b> <b>I</b> think." ...|$|E

500|$|There {{was also}} {{controversy}} at the rear-end of the grid, as Spyker asked the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) {{to look at}} the new updates that were put on the Super Aguri at Indianapolis to see whether the Aguri team are receiving current Honda parts. On Saturday, Super Aguri's managing director Daniel Audetto said [...] "We have rules – they [...] can just protest.

500|$|.....I {{thought about}} what I had been offered and I said to myself, [...] "What am I being so damn grand <b>about?</b> <b>I</b> have two {{children}} to support, the part {{they want me to}} play has a lot of dignity, the show is already on the air, I wouldn't have to film a pilot, and they have a sponsor. This is really a great gift that has been offered me. I'd be stupid not to at least look into it." ...|$|E
500|$|When Missy and I do a record, {{the energy}} is {{on a whole}} other level. I can't explain exactly what it is. It's just the energy, I think. She knows how to really make a party a party. That's what I want – to make this record to be the {{ultimate}} party record. That's pretty much how that all came <b>about.</b> ... <b>I</b> guess each time we work together, we give 100% of our energy to each other. It's crazy. Sometimes you can't explain what the chemistry is. It's just how you feel.|$|E

500|$|A British tour {{followed}} in June 1980 before the band went to Rockfield Studios {{to record their}} debut album. Despite talk of the American singer Del Shannon being asked to produce the album, it was produced by the band's manager Bill Drummond and his business partner and The Teardrop Explodes keyboard player David Balfe. The recording of the album only took three weeks, but Pattinson was still surprised by how boring the recording process was: [...] "There {{was a lot of}} hanging <b>about.</b> <b>I</b> didn't get all the 'drop-ins' and 'edits' bit." ...|$|E
500|$|I Should Coco reached {{number one}} on the UK Albums Chart, stayed there for three weeks, and still remains the only number-one album Supergrass has ever achieved. It sold 500,000 copies domestically, earning Platinum status in the UK, and has sold over a million copies worldwide. NME writer Steve Sutherland gave the album a nine-out-of-ten rating. He wrote, [...] "They play with the skill and {{assurance}} of a band who've been going for decades yet they still burn off the buzz of being new to the game." [...] He added, [...] "There's nothing contrived <b>about</b> <b>I</b> Should Coco, nothing added for effect." ...|$|E
500|$|Following her {{critical}} {{success with}} Walk the Line, Witherspoon admits to spending several years [...] "kind of floundering career-wise". Reflecting on {{this period of}} time in a December 2014 interview, Witherspoon attributed it to her separation from her first husband in October 2006 and their subsequent divorce, stating that she spent [...] "a few years just trying to feel better. You know, you can't really be very creative when you feel like your brain is scrambled eggs." [...] She claims that she [...] "wasn't making things I was passionate <b>about.</b> <b>I</b> was just kind of working, you know. And it was really clear that audiences weren't responding to anything I was putting out there." ...|$|E

500|$|I {{needed to}} {{maintain}} a very strong relationship with Tommy [...] During that period, {{the beginning of their}} end, I had to stay away more than normal from her because she was going through a rough time. She felt that shutting her relationship with Tommy was also a cleansing of who she was. She felt that part of what she was dropping was the shmaltzy pop singer ballad kind of stuff he was adamant <b>about.</b> <b>I</b> had to make my exit and say 'Mariah, you need to redefine yourself, that's fine. I'm here doing what I do and if and when you want to come back and do it again, I'm here.|$|E
500|$|I've {{been in a}} {{reflective}} state of mind. I've done lot of soul searching and I just felt in a romantic mood when I was writing for [...] so that's what I wrote <b>about...</b> <b>I</b> decided that I {{wanted to work with}} a whole bunch of different producers. [...] Björk's album was one of my favorite for years—it's brilliantly produced. And I also wanted to work with Massive Attack. So obviously, he was on the list. Nellee was the last person I worked with, and it wasn't until then that I got a grip of what the sound of the whole record was, so I had to go back and redo a lot.|$|E
500|$|Swift solely penned [...] "Today Was a Fairytale" [...] in {{the summer}} of 2008 and stored it away for a while. After being cast as Felicia Miller on Valentine's Day, Swift offered the song to the film {{producers}} for the soundtrack as she did not believe it fit on her upcoming album. [...] "When this movie opportunity came <b>about,</b> <b>I</b> reached back into my pocket and thought, 'I think this is perfect for the soundtrack. I hope it's perfect for the soundtrack'", Swift told The Tennessean. [...] "Today Was a Fairytale" [...] was released as a single from the Valentine's Day soundtrack on January 22, 2010, exclusively through the iTunes Store.
