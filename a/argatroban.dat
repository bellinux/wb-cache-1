50|$|<b>Argatroban</b> {{is a small}} {{univalent}} DTI {{formed from}} P1 residue from arginine. It binds to the active site on thrombin. The X-ray crystal structure shows that the piperidine ring binds in the S2 pocket and the guanidine group binds with hydrogen bonds with Asp189 into the S1 pocket. It’s given as an intravenous bolus because the highly basic guanidine with pKa 13 prevents it to be absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The plasma half-life is approximately 45 minutes. As <b>argatroban</b> is metabolized via hepatic pathway and is mainly excreted through the biliary system, dose adjustments are necessary in patients with hepatic impairment but not renal damage. <b>Argatroban</b> has been approved in the USA since 2000 {{for the treatment of}} thrombosis in patients with HIT and 2002 for anticoagulation in patients with a history of HIT or are at risk of HIT undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI).

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThis study {{examined}} {{the effect of a}} small-molecule, direct thrombin inhibitor, <b>argatroban,</b> on reperfusion induced by tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). BACKGROUNDThrombin plays a crucial role in thrombosis and thrombolysis. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that <b>argatroban</b> has advantages over heparin for the inhibition of clot-bound thrombin and for the enhancement of thrombolysis with TPA. METHODSOne hundred and twenty-five patients with AMI within 6 h were randomized to heparin, low-dose <b>argatroban</b> or high-dose <b>argatroban</b> in addition to TPA. The primary end point was the rate of thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) grade 3 flow at 90 min. RESULTSTIMI grade 3 flow was achieved in 42. 1 % of heparin, 56. 8 % of low-dose <b>argatroban</b> (p = 0. 20 vs. heparin) and 58. 7 % of high-dose <b>argatroban</b> patients (p = 0. 13 vs. heparin). In patients presenting after 3 h, TIMI grade 3 flow was significantly more frequent in high-dose <b>argatroban</b> versus heparin patients: 57. 1 % versus 20. 0 % (p = 0. 03 vs. heparin). Major bleeding was observed in 10. 0 % of heparin, and in 2. 6 % and 4. 3 % of low-dose and high-dose <b>argatroban</b> patients, respectively. The composite of death, recurrent myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock or congestive heart failure, revascularization and recurrent ischemia at 30 days occurred in 37. 5 % of heparin, 32. 0 % of low-dose <b>argatroban</b> and 25. 5 % of high-dose <b>argatroban</b> patients (p = 0. 23).

30|$|<b>Argatroban</b> is a {{synthetic}} direct thrombin inhibitor {{and is often}} used as an anticoagulant [13].

[14] examined the effect of <b>argatroban</b> on peritonitis-induced impairment of microcirculation in a rat model of sepsis and reported improvement of the intestinal microcirculation; they attributed this effect to reduced leukocyte adherence to the endothelium induced by the drug.

30|$|Given {{the lack}} of {{prospective}} studies investigating <b>argatroban,</b> the present study aimed to retrospectively evaluate the efficiency, safety and controllability of <b>argatroban</b> compared with standard heparin in ARDS patients treated with extracorporeal lung support.|$|E

This article summarizes the main conclusions of this round table discussion. An ongoing issue is the appropriate dosing of <b>argatroban</b> in special patient groups.

40|$|<b>Argatroban</b> is a {{thrombin}} inhibitor used as anticoagulant {{in patients}} with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. It is usually administered as an intravenous bolus followed by infusion. Nevertheless, its pharmacokinetics after subcutaneous administration is unknown. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the pharmacokinetics of two different formulations of <b>argatroban</b> in pigs after subcutaneous administration. Antithrombotic activity in plasma was determined by ecarin chromogenic assay. To visualize the formation of crystals, <b>argatroban</b> was administered to rats into the subcutaneous tissue exposed after removing the skin, and the injection site was photographed at different times. After subcutaneous administration of a sorbitol/ethanol formulation of <b>argatroban</b> in pigs was observed a slow absorption phase was followed by long-lasting levels of this inhibitor. Cmax and AUC(0 - 24) showed dose-dependent increases, while elimination half-life and tmax value did not change significantly with dose. In contrast, saline-dissolved <b>argatroban</b> showed a faster absorption phase followed by a shorter elimination half-life. <b>Argatroban</b> dissolved in sorbitol/ethanol leads to long-lasting plasma levels due to the formation and permanent dissolution of a crystalline depot at the injection place.

40|$|Elisavet Grouzi Department of Transfusion Service and Clinical Hemostasis, “Agios Savvas” Regional Cancer Hospital, Athens, Greece Abstract: Heparin-induced {{thrombocytopenia}} (HIT) {{is a rare}} {{but potentially}} severe complication of heparin therapy that is strongly associated with venous and arterial thrombosis (HIT and thrombosis syndrome, HITTS), which requires urgent detection and treatment with a nonheparin anticoagulant. <b>Argatroban,</b> a synthetic direct thrombin inhibitor, is indicated for the treatment and prophylaxis of thrombosis in patients with HIT, including those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. <b>Argatroban</b> has a relatively short elimination half-life of approximately 45 minutes, which is predominantly performed via hepatic metabolism. It is derived from L-arginine that selectively and reversibly inhibits thrombin, both clot-bound and free, at the catalytic site. <b>Argatroban</b> anticoagulation has been systematically studied in patients with HIT and HITTS and {{proved to be a}} safe and effective agent for this indication. The current review presents the pharmacology of <b>argatroban,</b> data regarding monitoring of the agent, and an overview {{of the results of the}} major clinical trials assessing <b>argatroban</b> anticoagulation in HIT patients. Additionally, data from recent clinical trials with <b>argatroban</b> use in more special indications such as in percutaneous coronary intervention, liver dysfunction, renal replacement therapy, and intensive care medicine, are reviewed. The approved initial dosage of <b>argatroban</b> for adults with HIT or HITTS is 2 µg/kg/minute for patients with normal hepatic function and 0. 5 µg/kg/minute for patients with hepatic dysfunction. There is evidence that a reduced initial dose may also be advisable for patients with heart failure, multiple organ dysfunction, severe anasarca, or after cardiac surgery.

MethodsIn this randomized, 3 -way crossover study, ESRD patients underwent hemodialysis sessions of 3 - or 4 -hour duration using high-flux membranes and each of 3 <b>argatroban</b> treatment regimens (A: 250 -μg/kg bolus, with an additional 250 -μg/kg bolus allowed; B: 250 -μg/kg bolus followed by 2 -μg/kg/min infusion; C: steady-state, 2 -μg/kg/min infusion initiated 4 hours before dialysis). Pharmacodynamic effects including activated clotting times (ACTs); hemodialysis efficacy including single-pool Kt/V, urea reduction ratio (URR), and circuit flow; and safety through a 3 -day follow-up were monitored. <b>Argatroban</b> pharmacokinetic parameters including dialytic clearance were evaluated during regimen C. ResultsThirteen patients completed 38 hemodialysis sessions (1 patient withdrew consent after 2 sessions). Mean ± SD ACTs increased from 131 ± 14 seconds at baseline to 153 ± 24, 200 ± 30, and 197 ± 33 seconds, respectively, after 60 minutes of hemodialysis using regimens A, B, and C. Across regimens, mean Kt/Vs (1. 5 – 1. 6) and URRs (70 %- 73 %) were comparable. No dialyzer was changed; 1 session was shortened 15 minutes because of circuit clot formation.

ID 50 was obtained with the combination of 3 micrograms/kg G 4120 and 0. 5 mg/kg <b>Argatroban,</b> corresponding to an equi-effective fractional combination of 0. 62 with a 95 % confidence interval of 0. 50 to 0. 74. Alternatively the ID 50 was obtained with the combination of 1 mg/kg <b>Argatroban</b> and 1. 3 micrograms/kg G 4120, corresponding to an equi-effective fractional combination of 0. 52 with a 95 % confidence interval of 0. 18 to 0. 86. In both instances these results are indicative of a significant synergistic interaction. Bolus injection of 10 mg/kg aspirin, 100 U/kg heparin or the combination did not inhibit thrombus formation. The synergistic effect of the combination of platelet inhibiting RGD-peptides and synthetic thrombin inhibitors could be useful {{in the prevention of}} arterial occlusion with platelet-rich thrombus in patients with ischemic heart disease following thrombolytic therapy or angioplasty, although this combination is not expected to reverse platelet thrombus formation. status: publishe...|$|E
