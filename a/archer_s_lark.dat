We have recently reported that an enteritis-producing strain of Salmonella typhimurium signals intact intestinal epithelium to recruit subepithelial neutrophils to migrate across the epithelial (B.

We now utilize a cell culture model of human intestinal epithelium (with T 84 cells) to examine whether such transepithelial signaling to neutrophils by salmonellae is predictive of potential to elicit gastroenteritis. Various Salmonella serotypes, including S. typhimurium, S. enteritidis, S. pullorum, S. arizonae, S. typhi, and S. paratyphi, as well as invasion-defective mutants of S. typhimurium, were studied. Strains or serotypes which elicit diffuse enteritis in humans (defined histologically as transepithelial migration of neutrophils) exhibited transepithelial signaling to neutorphils across epithelial cell monolayers, while those which do not elicit diffuse enteritis in humans did not display transepithelial signaling. In contrast, the ability to enter the apical surface of T 84 cells did not differentiate strains or serotypes which induce diffuse enteritis from those which do not. These results strongly suggest that the ability of salmonellae to elicit transepithelial signaling to neutrophils is a key virulence mechanism underlying Salmonella-elicited enteritis...|$|R

40|$|In humans, a primate-specific variable-number tandem-repeat (VNTR) {{polymorphism}} (4 or 5 repeats 54 nt in length) in the circadian gene PER 3 {{is associated}} with differences in sleep timing and homeostatic responses to sleep loss. We investigated {{the effects of this}} polymorphism on circadian rhythmicity and sleep homeostasis by introducing the polymorphism into mice and assessing circadian and sleep parameters at baseline and during and after 12 h of sleep deprivation (SD). Microarray analysis was used to measure hypothalamic and cortical gene expression. Circadian behavior and sleep were normal at baseline. The response to SD of 2 electrophysiological markers of sleep homeostasis, electroencephalography (EEG) θ power during wakefulness and δ power during sleep, were greater in the Per 3 (5 / 5) mice. During recovery, the Per 3 (5 / 5) mice fully compensated for the SD-induced deficit in δ power, but the Per 3 (4 / 4) and wild-type mice did not. Sleep homeostasis-related transcripts (e. g., Homer 1, Ptgs 2, and Kcna 2) were differentially expressed between the humanized mice, but circadian clock genes were not. These data are in accordance with the hypothesis derived from human data that the PER 3 VNTR polymorphism modifies the sleep homeostatic response without significantly influencing circadian parameters. -Hasan, S., van der Veen, D.

In vitro circadian period was determined using luminometry of cultured fibroblasts, in which the expression of firefly luciferase was driven by the promoter of the circadian gene Arntl (Bmal 1). The period of the melatonin rhythm was assessed in a 9 -d forced desynchrony protocol, minimizing confounding effects of sleep-wake and light-dark cycles on circadian rhythmicity. In vitro periods (32 participants, 24. 61 ± 0. 33 h, mean±sd) were longer than in vivo periods (31 participants, 24. 16 ± 0. 17 h; P 0. 4). Analyses of replicate in vitro assessments demonstrated that circadian period was reproducible within individuals (intraclass correlation= 0. 62), but in vivo and in vitro period assessments did not correlate (P> 0. 9). In accordance with circadian entrainment theory, in vivo period correlated with the timing of melatonin (P< 0. 05) at baseline and with diurnal preference (P< 0. 05). Individual circadian rhythms can be reliably assessed in fibroblasts but may not correlate with physiological rhythms driven by the central circadian pacemaker. -Hasan, S., Santhi, N., Lazar, A.

40|$|During {{intestinal}} disease {{induced by}} Salmonella typhimurium transepithelial migration of neutrophils (PMN) rapidly follows attachment {{of the bacteria}} to the epithelial apical membrane. Among the events stimulated by these interactions is the release of chemotaxins that guide PMN through the subepithelial matrix and subsequently through the epithelium itself (McCormick, B. A., S. P. Colgan, C. Delp- <b>Archer,</b> <b>S.</b> I. Miller, and J. L. Madara. 1993. J. Cell Biol. 123 : 895 - 907). Given the substantial volume flow that normally characterizes matrix compartments underlying transporting epithelia, {{it is unclear how}} such transmatrix signaling is sustained. Here we show that when underlying matrices are isolated from biophysically confluent polarized monolayers of the human intestinal epithelial cell line T 84, they fail to support substantial transmatrix migration of PMN unless an exogenous chemotactic gradient is imposed. In contrast, such matrices isolated from confluent monolayers apically colonized with S. typhimurium support spontaneous transmatrix migration of PMN. Such chemotactic imprinting of underlying matrices is resistant to volume wash and is paralleled by secretion of the known matrix-binding chemokine IL- 8. Chemotactic imprinting of the matrix underlying S. typhimurium- colonized monolayers is dependent on epithelial protein synthesis, is directional implying the existence of a gradient, and is neutralized by antibodies either to IL- 8 or to the IL- 8 receptor on PMN. An avirulent S. typhimurium strain, PhoPc, which attaches to epithelial cells as efficiently as wild-type S. typhimurium, fails to induce basolateral secretion of IL- 8 and likewise fails to imprint matrices. Together, these observations show that the epithelial surface can respond to the presence of a luminal pathogen and subsequently imprint the subepithelial matrix with retained IL- 8 gradients sufficient to resist washout effects of the volume flow that normally traverses this compartment. Such data further support the notion that the primary role for basolateral secretion of IL- 8 by the intestinal and likely other epithelia is recruitment of PMN through the matrix to the subepithelial space, rather than directing the final movement of PMN across the epithelium...|$|R

40|$|This volume {{represents}} {{the proceedings of}} a conference held at the Folger Shakespeare Library in 1995. It consists of five parts. In part 1, Meanings of Material London, David Harris Sacks explores the 1601 Essex Rebellion and finds its failure in the primacy that commercial relationships now held over older patron client bonds. Will Kemp s Morris dance from London to Norwich, meanwhile, seemingly illustrates {{the way in which}} market capitalism corrupted civic virtue and traditional hospitality. Derek Keene s richly documented survey of the London economy reinforces the value of a long-term perspective on the capital s growth. The roots of London s consumption patterns can be traced back as far as 1300, and much of its skilled trades and mercantile expertise derived from Continental rather than native sources. Part 2 examines Consumer Culture: Domesticating Foreign Fashion. The title of Joan Thirsk s thoughtful essay England s Provinces: Did They Serve or Drive Material London? is an accurate guide to its content. Existing provincial skills could be exploited to develop new industries or crops catering either to the London market, or to gentry and aristocracy intent on creating islands of metropolitan taste in the provinces. Jane Schneider shows how the accession of James I ushered in a world in glorious technicolor, a welcome relief to the relative drabness of high Elizabethan fashion, and relates this sartorial revolution to familiar changes in England s overseas trade. Color is of concern also to Anne Jones and Peter Stallybrass, who describe the growing popularity of yellow mantles in the early seventeenth century, an enthusiasm that ignored their criminal and, worse, Irish associations. Jean Howard analyses Westward Ho, in order to explore attitudes to foreigners. Ian <b>Archer</b> <b>s</b> rewarding essay Material Londoners? begins part 3 of the volume. He explores the limited extent to which new, acquisitive commercial values conflicted with traditional Christian personal and communal values. This is followed by Gail Paster s examination of that age s peculiar fashion for ever more violent purges and evacuations. Patricia Fumerton contributes an essay notable for its wrongheaded conflation of the experience of vagrancy with that of London s servants and apprentices. ...|$|R
