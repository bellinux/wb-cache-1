The deviations from the geometrical jet axis were {{on the order of}} 2 - 4 % of the nozzle diameter, and the pure jet axis had the form of a helical wave. A similar asymmetry in the radiated noise was also noted. The measured circumferential distribution of rms fluctuating velocity signals confirmed the asymmetry of even a circular jet...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new methodology for {{the formulation of}} the aeroelastic stability and response problem for helicopter rotor blades. The mathematical expressions for the aerodynamic loads need not be explicit functions of the blade displacement quantities. This methodology is combined with a finite element model of the blade, and a quasilinearization solution technique. The resulting computer program is used to study the behavior of blades with noncoincident elastic <b>axis,</b> <b>aerodynamic</b> centers, and centers of mass...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the techniques involved {{in determining the}} aerodynamic stability derivatives for the frequency domain analysis of the Space Launch System (SLS) vehicle. Generally for launch vehicles, determination of the derivatives is fairly straightforward since the aerodynamic data is usually linear through a moderate range of angle of attack. However, if the wind tunnel data lacks proper corrections then nonlinearities and asymmetric behavior may appear in the aerodynamic database coefficients. In this case, computing the derivatives becomes a non-trivial task. Errors in computing the nominal derivatives could lead to improper interpretation regarding the natural stability {{of the system and}} tuning of the controller parameters, which would impact both stability and performance. The aerodynamic derivatives are also provided at off nominal operating conditions used for dispersed frequency domain Monte Carlo analysis. Finally, results are shown to illustrate that the effects of <b>aerodynamic</b> cross <b>axis</b> coupling can be neglected for the SLS configuration studie...|$|R

5000|$|The aeolipile {{consists}} of a vessel, usually a [...] "simple" [...] solid of revolution, such as a sphere or a cylinder, arranged to rotate on its axis, having oppositely bent or curved nozzles projecting from it (tipjets). When the vessel is pressurised with steam, steam is expelled through the nozzles, which generates thrust due to the rocket principle {{as a consequence of}} the 2nd and 3rd of Newton's laws of motion. When the nozzles, pointing in different directions, produce forces along different lines of action perpendicular to the axis of the bearings, the thrusts combine to result in a rotational moment (mechanical couple), or torque, causing the vessel to spin about its <b>axis.</b> <b>Aerodynamic</b> drag and frictional forces in the bearings build up quickly with increasing rotational speed (rpm) and consume the accelerating torque, eventually cancelling it and achieving a steady state speed.|$|R
40|$|A {{technique}} {{was developed for}} global modeling of nonlinear aerodynamic coefficients using multivariate orthogonal functions based on the data. Each orthogonal function retained in the model was decomposed into an expansion of ordinary polynomials in the independent variables, so that the final model {{could be interpreted as}} selectively retained terms from a multivariable power series expansion. A predicted squared-error metric was used to determine the orthogonal functions to be retained in the model; analytical derivatives were easily computed. The approach was demonstrated on the Z-body <b>axis</b> <b>aerodynamic</b> force coefficient (Cz) wind tunnel data for an F- 18 research vehicle which came from a tabular wind tunnel and covered the entire subsonic flight envelope. For a realistic case, the analytical model predicted experimental values of Cz very well. The modeling technique is shown to be capable of generating a compact, global analytical representation of nonlinear aerodynamics. The polynomial model has good predictive capability, global validity, and analytical differentiability...|$|R
40|$|The {{deployment}} {{dynamics of}} a tape-spring style, folding MAV wing in flight are complicated and an investigation is made using wind tunnel testing. High speed photography {{is used to}} characterize the deployment motion of the wing while a force balance records six- <b>axis</b> <b>aerodynamic</b> loading of the model. An in-flight deployment of a folding wing would be advantageous after an autonomous tube launch, however the dynamics are potentially problematic due to buckling. Steady state aerodynamics of prototype tube-launch MAVs are characterized for both rigid body and compliant, rolling wings. Aerodynamic phenomena associated with the significant relative body size are identified. Wing deployments are demonstrated at four different angles-of-attack at single velocity, while an extreme case deployment is shown at a high velocity. Two-piece cylindrical shells are used to retain the wing prior to deployment and are released by hot-wire cutting of retaining lines. Three phenomena leading improper deployment are noted. Aeroelastic flutter is observed and characterized after the wing deployment at certain conditions...|$|R
