40|$|Nuclei {{isolated}} from excised soybean plumules that {{were treated with}} 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D) were active in transcription of four auxin-regulated genes or DNA sequences, which have been described previously (G. Hagen, A. Kleinschmidt, and T. Guilfoyle, Planta 162 : 147 - 153, 1984). The rates of transcription of the auxin-responsive sequences were 10 - to 100 -fold greater with nuclei {{isolated from}} auxin-treated plumules than with those from untreated plumules. The transcriptional response was also observed with hypocotyls of intact soybean seedlings and hypocotyl sections, {{as well as with}} green bean and mung bean plumules that were treated with 2, 4 -D. Other auxins, including 2, 4, 5 -trichlorophenoxyacetic acid, <b>alpha-naphthaleneacetic</b> <b>acid,</b> and indole- 3 -acetic acid, also induced the transcriptional response. Increased transcription rates were observed within 5 min after application of auxins to excised plumules, and half-maximal to maximal transcription rates were achieved by 15 min after application of auxins. As little as 10 (- 7) to 10 (- 8) M 2, 4 -D induced a transcriptional response, but maximal transcription rates were achieved at 10 (- 3) M 2, 4 -D. Brief treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide did not inhibit the induction of transcription by auxins. These results clearly demonstrated that auxin-regulated gene expression is under rapid transcriptional control...|$|E
40|$|Mature zygotic embryos of 24 genotypes of {{loblolly pine}} (Pinus taeda L.) {{were used as}} explants to {{establish}} an adventitious shoot regeneration system through somatic organogenesis. Callus formation frequencies of 18. 2 (genotype 11 - 1103) - 77. 7 % (genotype 7 - 100) have been induced from mature zygotic embryos of all genotypes tested on callus induction medium (basal salts) containing 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D) or <b>alpha-naphthaleneacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (NAA), 6 -benzyladenine (BA), and kinetin. Adventitious shoot regeneration via organogenesis with the frequency of 5. 4 (genotype 11 - 1103 and 7 - 2) - 77. 2 % (genotype 8 - 1082) was obtained from callus and tissue cultures derived from mature zygotic embryos of 24 genotypes of loblolly pine. The highest mean number of 18 adventitious buds per piece of callus 0. 5 x 0. 5 cm(2) in size was obtained from genotype 8 - 1082. Elongation of adventitious buds was achieved on TE medium supplemented with 0. 5 mg/l indole- 3 -butyric acid (IBA) and 1 mg/l BA. After rooting, regenerated plantlets were established in soil. These results suggested that adventitious shoot regeneration via somatic organogenesis {{was influenced by the}} genotypes. The in vitro regeneration procedure established in this investigation could be used for clonal micropropagation of some genotypes of loblolly pine, as well as for establishing a transformation system in coniferous species...|$|E

It is the most {{economically}} important tree harvested for heartwood oil, and India is among the chief exporters of sandalwood and its products. Multiple shoots were induced from nodal shoot segments derived from a 50 - to 60 -year-old candidate plus tree (CPT) on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 0. 53 mu M <b>alpha-naphthaleneacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (NAA) and 11. 09 mu M 6 -benzylaminopurine (BA). In vitro differentiated shoots were multiplied on MS medium with 0. 53 mu M NAA, 4. 44 mu M BA, and additives: 283. 93 mu M ascorbic acid, 118. 10 mu M citric acid, 104. 04 mu M cystine, 342. 24 mu M glutamine, and 10 % (v/v) coconut milk.

After 4 weeks, {{the best results}} were observed with 0. 54 microM <b>alpha-naphthaleneacetic</b> <b>acid</b> and 2. 22 microM benzyladenine. On this medium, the rate of regeneration depended on seedling age and agar concentration. The highest number of shoots per explant was obtained with small cuttings from 30 -day-old seedlings grown on a medium containing 8 g/l of agar. Regeneration success was also dependent on explant size. When longer explants (7 - 20 mm) were cut from the main root, direct regeneration was obtained in two weeks. These cuttings also generated shoots through callogenesis in four weeks but always in lower quantities than with direct regeneration, whatever the seedling age. Here also, the best regeneration was obtained with cuttings from 30 -day-old seedlings maintained on a medium with 8 g/l of agar. Regenerants were rooted on growth-regulator-free Murashige and Skoog medium and then acclimatized in a greenhouse. A better survival to transplantation was observed when plantlets were inoculated with the photosynthetic #Bradyrhizobium$ strain ORS 278.

40|$|A healthy {{root system}} {{is vital for}} tissue culture {{plantlet}} survival and rapid adaptation from the in vitro microenvironment to glasshouse conditions. Optimization of the root induction medium is {{an effective way to}} promote root induction and elongation. Levels of three auxins (<b>alpha-naphthaleneacetic</b> <b>acid</b> [NAA], 3 -indoleacetic acid [IAA], and 3 -indolebutyric acid [IBA]) and copper sulfate (CuSO 4) have been investigated in a series of experiments with a sorghum inbred line, Tx 430. Significant improvement in root proliferation and shoot growth were observed on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 1 mu mol/L CuSO 4, 1 mg/L NAA, 1 mg/L IAA, and 1 mg/L IBA. On average, one explant (the original in vitro-derived shoot) of Tx 430 regenerated 56. 7 roots, which was 20 -fold higher on the optimal medium than on MS control medium. Another tested genotype SA 281 showed similar response patterns as Tx 430 across media. In addition, 100 % of Tx 430 and SA 281 plantlets originating from the optimized root induction medium all survived after being transferred to potting soil in the glasshouse. The results demonstrate that a combination of auxins (NAA, IAA, and IBA) and CuSO 4 together at optimal concentrations provide additive effects on promoting root proliferation and explant growth of in vitro sorghum in root induction medium, and subsequently resulted in 100 % survival rate of plantlets ex tissue culture. Compared with two published and frequently used root induction media, the optimized medium significantly enhanced root induction and plantlet growth...|$|E

Six south-east Asian Indica rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars produced embryogenic structures after 6 weeks of culture at 26 +/- 1 degrees C. Efficiency in embryogenic response of genotypes differed, Kurkaruppan = FR 13 A > Khao Dawk Mali 105 = Nam Sagui 19 = RD 7 > Pin Gaew 56. Additives such as mannitol, tryptophan and ABA nor manipulation of light environment improved callus initiation or embryogenic callus formation. The {{use of a}} number of different plantlet regeneration media either free of plant growth regulators or containing auxins (indole- 3 -acetic acid and <b>alpha-naphthaleneacetic</b> <b>acid),</b> cytokinins (kinetin and 6 -benzylaminopurine) and an ethylene producing chemical (1 -aminocyclopropane carboxylic acid) showed that the plant: growth regulator-free medium or the one supplemented with 1 -aminocyclopropane carboxylic acid (5 mu M) and kinetin mu 5 mu M) were best for plantlet formation. However, a single recommendation could not be made for all cultivars. One further culture modification involving a mild osmotic stress (polyethylene glycol 100 g L(- 1)) in R- 2 liquid medium enhanced plantlet regeneration in Nam Sagui 19 two-fold but Khao Dawk Mali 105 was recalcitrant to this treatment.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the induction and in vitro alkaloid yield of calluses and protocorm-like bodies (PLBs) from Pinellia ternata (Thunb.) Berit (Araceae). We planned to use this material in future studies related to the mass production of medicinally valuable compounds and regulation of alkaloid metabolism. Different combinations of 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D), 6 -benzyladenine (6 -BA), kinetin (Kin), and <b>alpha-naphthaleneacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (NAA) were used to induce callus and PLB formation from P. ternata tuber explants. The results showed that three physiologically distinct calluses were induced by different combinations of 2, 4 -D, 6 -BA, and Kin used in this study. The calluses differed in color, texture, differentiation status, and alkaloid content. The alkaloid content of the three calli types ranged from 0. 0175 % to 0. 0293 %. In comparison, the alkaloid content of field-grown tubers was 0. 0072 %. Many reports have indicated that 2, 4 -D suppresses the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites; however, our results show that 2, 4 -D promoted alkaloid production in Pinellia calluses. The combination of NAA + 6 -BA induced PLB formation. The PLB alkaloid content of 0. 0321 % was 1. 1 to 1. 8 {{times higher than the}} alkaloid content of the calluses and 4. 5 times higher than the field-grown tubers. In conclusion, the induction of calluses and PLBs with alkaloid content greater than that of field-grown tubers indicates the potential use of these tissue culture materials for bioprocessing alkaloids from P. ternata and for the study of alkaloid metabolism...|$|E
40|$|We have {{isolated}} two cDNA clones (cdc 2 -S 5 and cdc 2 -S 6) encoding p 34 cdc 2 protein kinases, homologs of yeast cdc 2 /CDC 28 genes, from a soybean nodule cDNA library. The two sequences share 90 % {{sequence homology}} in the coding regions. The 5 ' and 3 ' noncoding regions are distinct from each other, however, indicating {{that at least}} two genes encode p 34 cdc 2 protein kinases in soybean. Both sequences can rescue the cdc 28 mutation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae but rescue it with different efficiency. Genomic Southern analysis showed the existence of two copies for each of these genes, which are not closely linked and are nonallelic. The relative expression level of the two soybean p 34 cdc 2 genes varies in different tissues. Expression of cdc 2 -S 5 is higher in roots and root nodules, whereas cdc 2 -S 6 is more actively expressed in aerial tissues, indicating that regulation of these two p 34 cdc 2 genes is coupled with plant developmental pathways. Expression of cdc 2 -S 5 is, furthermore, enhanced after Rhizobium infection, whereas cdc 2 -S 6 fails to respond, suggesting that cdc 2 -S 5 plays a role in nodule initiation and organogenesis. This latter gene preferentially responds to auxin (<b>alpha-naphthaleneacetic</b> <b>acid)</b> treatment, indicating that phytohormones may be involved in the control of cell division mediated by Rhizobium infection. Thus, different p 34 cdc 2 protein kinases may control cell division in different tissues in a multicellular organism and respond to different signals [...] e. g., phytohormones...|$|E

Some of these cells underwent division while the surrounding cells accumulated starch. Callus was capable of shoot bud regeneration after 70 days when it was transfered to liquid medium of the same composition. After 30 days in liquid medium, buds developed from nodular structures. The adventitious shoots developed extensive root systems when they were placed on agar-solidified Murashige and Skoog medium without growth regulators at 25 º C in the light.

40|$|Jatropha curcas is an {{oil bearing}} species with {{multiple}} uses and considerable economic {{potential as a}} biofuel crop. A simple and reproducible protocol was developed for Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated stable genetic transformation of J. curcas using leaf explains. Agrobacterium strain LBA 4404 harbouring the binary vector pCAMBIA 1304 having sense-dehydration responsive element binding (S-DREB 2 A), beta-glucuronidase (gus), and hygromycin-phosphotransferase (hpt) genes were used for gene transfer. A number of parameters such as preculture of explains, wounding of leaf explants, Agrobacterium growth phase (OD), infection duration, co-cultivation period, co-cultivation medium pH, and acetosyringone, were studied to optimized transformation efficiency. The highest transformation efficiency was achieved using 4 -day precultured, non-wounded leaf explants infected with Agrobacterium culture corresponding to OD(600) = 0. 6 for 20 min, followed by co-cultivation for 4 days in a co-cultivation medium containing 100 mu M acetosyringone, pH 5. 7. Co-cultivated leaf explants were initially cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 2. 27 mu M thidiazuron (TDZ) for regeneration of shoot buds, followed by selection on same medium with 5 mu g ml(- 1) hygromycin. Selected shoot buds were transferred to MS medium containing 10 mu M kinetin (Kn), 4. 5 mu M 6 -benzyl aminopurine (BA), and 5. 5 mu M <b>alpha-naphthaleneacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (NAA) for proliferation. The proliferated shoots were elongated on MS medium supplemented with 2. 25 mu M BA and 8. 5 mu M indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA).

40|$|The use of (35) S-labeled calmodulin (CaM) {{to screen}} a corn root cDNA {{expression}} library {{has led to}} the isolation of a CaM-binding protein, encoded by a cDNA with sequence similarity to small auxin up RNAs (SAURs), a class of early auxin-responsive genes. The cDNA designated as ZmSAUR 1 (Zea mays SAURs) was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant protein was purified by CaM affinity chromatography. The CaM binding assay revealed that the recombinant protein binds to CaM in a calcium-dependent manner. Deletion analysis revealed that the CaM binding site was located at the NH(2) -terminal domain. A synthetic peptide of amino acids 20 - 45, corresponding to the potential CaM binding region, was used for calcium-dependent mobility shift assays. The synthetic peptide formed a stable complex with CaM only in the presence of calcium. The CaM affinity assay indicated that ZmSAUR 1 binds to CaM with high affinity (K(d) approximately 15 nM) in a calcium-dependent manner. Comparison of the NH(2) -terminal portions of all of the characterized SAURs revealed that they all contain a stretch of the basic alpha-amphiphilic helix similar to the CaM binding region of ZmSAUR 1. CaM binds to the two synthetic peptides from the NH(2) -terminal regions of Arabidopsis SAUR-AC 1 and soybean 10 A 5, suggesting that this is a general phenomenon for all SAURs. Northern analysis was carried out using the total RNA isolated from auxin-treated corn coleoptile segments. ZmSAUR 1 gene expression began within 10 min, increased rapidly between 10 and 60 min, and peaked around 60 min after 10 microM <b>alpha-naphthaleneacetic</b> <b>acid</b> treatment. These results indicate that ZmSAUR 1 is an early auxin-responsive gene. The CaM antagonist N-(6 -aminohexyl) 5 -chloro- 1 -naphthalenesulfonamide hydrochloride inhibited the auxin-induced cell elongation but not the auxin-induced expression of ZmSAUR 1. This suggests that calcium/CaM do not regulate ZmSAUR 1 at the transcriptional level. CaM binding to ZmSAUR 1 in a calcium-dependent manner suggests that calcium/CaM regulate ZmSAUR 1 at the post-translational level. Our data provide the first direct evidence for the involvement of calcium/CaM-mediated signaling in auxin-mediated signal transduction...|$|E
