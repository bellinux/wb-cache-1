The US began to lose confidence in Diệm's ability to run the country effectively and prevent {{the growth of the}} communist insurgency, and concluded that he was an obstacle to religious and thus national stability. During this time, the American press corps wrote unvarnished stories <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Vietnamese government's policies and actions, in contrast to the supportive pieces of the 1950s, and Diệm's attempt to physically intimidate correspondents backfired. After Diệm tried to settle the Buddhist crisis by launching synchronized raids on Buddhist temples across the country to round up those monks who were leading protests against him, the Americans began to look for alternative leadership, sending Cable 243 to their embassy in Saigon to authorise the search for someone to replace Diệm. In November 1963, Diệm was overthrown in a US-backed coup and he and Nhu were captured and executed.|$|E

500|$|It was revealed, {{a quarter}} century after the war, that Benjamin and Davis had agreed for the {{secretary}} to act as scapegoat rather than reveal the shortage of arms.

The general's son, Captain Jennings Wise, fell at Roanoke Island, and Henry's grandson John Wise, interviewed in 1936, told Meade that [...] "the fat Jew sitting at his desk" [...] was to blame.

500|$|After a {{successful}} season for England in 1967, D'Oliveira {{was chosen to}} tour the West Indies in 1967–68; this raised awareness in England and South Africa {{that he was a}} realistic contender to tour South Africa a year later. However, his opportunities to excel were few in the West Indies; circumstances were against him in several matches, and he had a statistically poor tour. Any mitigating circumstances were offset by problems off the field. D'Oliveira took full advantage of the social opportunities available {{on a tour of the}} West Indies and frequently disappeared to parties and other events, often not reappearing until after breakfast. Rumours to this effect reached the press and the MCC tour manager spoke to D'Oliveira about his responsibilities on tour. D'Oliveira said that his behaviour and poor form were partly a result of the pressure placed on him. He was frequently questioned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> African tour and about race—some groups in the West Indies accused him of [...] "selling out" [...] by playing for England's [...] "white" [...] team.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{uses the}} {{relatively}} strong economic growth of <b>the</b> <b>South</b> over <b>the</b> past 20 to 30 {{years as the}} basis for a discussion of recent developments in economic growth theory. First, three facts <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>South's</b> rise relative to other regions are discussed. This is followed by a discussion of the two leading macroeconomic explanations of economic growth, neoclassical growth theory and endogenous growth theory, showing how endogenous growth theory's focus on innovation as the engine of growth, and on the externalities related to innovations, might be used to explain key regional characteristics of southern economic growth, such as clustering and uneven growth. The paper concludes with some observations <b>about</b> how <b>the</b> <b>South's</b> future might unfold in light of these newer growth theories and briefly discusses how the resurgence in inter-est in regional economic growth presents excellent opportunities for regional science.

500|$|Poe's early detective fiction tales {{featuring}} C. Auguste Dupin {{laid the}} groundwork for future detectives in literature.

[...] The Mystery Writers of America have named their awards for excellence in the genre the [...] "Edgars". Poe's work also influenced science fiction, notably Jules Verne, who wrote a sequel to Poe's novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket called An Antarctic Mystery, also known as The Sphinx of the Ice Fields. Science fiction author H. G. Wells noted, [...] "Pym tells what a very intelligent mind could imagine <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> polar region a century ago."

2500|$|Burney {{published}} {{her fourth}} novel, , {{a few days}} before Charles Burney's death. Described as [...] "a story of love and misalliance set in the French Revolution", it criticises the English treatment of foreigners during the war years. It also pillories the hypocritical social curbs put on women in general – as the heroine tries one means after another to earn an honest penny – as well as the elaborate class criteria for social inclusion or exclusion. That strong social message sits uneasily within a strange structure that might be called a melodramatic proto-mystery novel with elements of the picaresque. The heroine is no scalliwag, in fact a bit too innocent for modern taste, but she is wilful and for obscure reasons refuses to reveal her name or origin. So as she darts <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> of England as a fugitive, she arouses suspicions that it is not always easy to agree with the author are unfair or unjustified. There are a dismaying number of coincidental meetings of characters.|$|E

In 1997 he co-authored Killing Rage, with journalist Mick McGovern, a biographical account of his life and IRA career. He also contributed to the book Bandit Country by Toby Harnden <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Armagh IRA. At the same time in the media he called for the re-introduction of Internment after the Omagh bombing for those continuing to engage in such acts; published newspaper articles openly denouncing and ridiculing the fringe Real IRA's attempts to re-ignite paramilitary warfare in Ulster, alongside publicly analyzing his own past role in such activity, and the damage that it had caused on a personal and social level to the two communities of Ulster.|$|E
2500|$|Rather than {{go through}} the {{time-consuming}} process to add the route to the STAA system, the state decided to get it approved as an Interstate.

Immediately after the response from the FHWA, NCDOT added the project (W-5007) to the state Transportation Improvement Plan, but AASHTO denied the I-795 numbering at their May 4, 2007, meeting, citing concerns <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> end not being at another Interstate and the lack of FHWA approval. However, AASHTO decided at their September 28 meeting to give conditional approval, pending FHWA concurrence. The North Carolina Highway Patrol, which had begun ticketing overlength truckers on US117 in mid-2007, stopped enforcing the ban on October 3, due to the AASHTO decision. The first I-795 signs were posted on November 28, 2007, replacing US117 signs along the whole route. Most, but not all signage at the interchange on-ramps was updated at the same time. Other changes, including shifting US117 back to the old route and changing exit numbers and mileposts, were to be completed by early 2008, but complications with the road surface and approval of moving US117 delayed those plans to December 2009.|$|E
