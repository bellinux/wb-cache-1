5|$|Article8 {{recognises}} {{the right}} of workers to form or join trade unions and protects the right to strike. It allows these rights to be restricted {{for members of the}} armed forces, police, or government administrators. Several parties have placed reservations on this clause, allowing it to be interpreted in <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> their constitutions (e.g.,China, Mexico), or extending the restriction of union rights to groups such as firefighters (e.g.,Japan).|$|E

5|$|The AdS/CFT {{correspondence}} resolves {{the black}} hole information paradox, {{at least to some}} extent, because it shows how a black hole can evolve in <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> quantum mechanics in some contexts. Indeed, one can consider black holes {{in the context of the}} AdS/CFT correspondence, and any such black hole corresponds to a configuration of particles on the boundary of anti-de Sitter space. These particles obey the usual rules of quantum mechanics and in particular evolve in a unitary fashion, so {{the black hole}} must also evolve in a unitary fashion, respecting the principles of quantum mechanics. In 2005, Hawking announced that the paradox had been settled in favor of information conservation by the AdS/CFT correspondence, and he suggested a concrete mechanism by which black holes might preserve information.|$|E

In 2004, confidential memos surfaced that discussed the limits to how much pain, discomfort and fear could be used in the interrogation of detainees in the global war on terror.

40|$|In Listeria monocytogenes, nisin induced ATP efflux, {{reduced the}} {{intracellular}} ATP concentration within 1 min, and dissipated the {{proton motive force}} within 2 min. Efflux accounted for only 20 % of the ATP depletion, suggesting that ATP hydrolysis also occurred. ATP efflux depended on nisin concentration and followed saturation kinetics. These results suggest that nisin breaches the membrane permeability barrier in <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> more <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> pore formation than with a nonspecific detergent-like membrane destabilization...|$|R

25|$|In 1966 Sagan was {{a member}} of the AdHoc Committee to Review Project Blue Book, the U.S.Air Force's UFO {{investigation}} project. The committee concluded Blue Book had been lacking as a scientific study, and recommended a university-based project to give the UFO phenomenon closer scientific scrutiny. The result was the Condon Committee (1966–68), led by physicist Edward Condon, and in their final report they formally concluded that UFOs, regardless of what any of them actually were, did not behave in <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> a threat to national security.|$|E
25|$|Various {{experiments}} {{document that}} changes in {{the conditions under which}} the dance is performed lead to characteristic changes in recruitment to external resources, in <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> von Frisch's original conclusions. Experiments with robotic dummies were indeed to induce some recruitment, which should not have been possible if the dance contains no information. Various experimental results demonstrate that the dance does convey information, but the use of this information may be context-dependent, and this may explain why the results of earlier studies were inconsistent. Researchers have also discovered other forms of honeybee dance communication, such as the tremble dance.|$|E

25|$|A {{key factor}} in a party's {{decision}} to participate in or engage with a corporation is their confidence that the corporation will deliver the party's expected outcomes. When categories of parties (stakeholders) do not have sufficient confidence that a corporation is being controlled and directed in <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> their desired outcomes, {{they are less likely}} to engage with the corporation. When this becomes an endemic system feature, the loss of confidence and participation in markets may affect many other stakeholders, and increases the likelihood of political action. There is substantial interest in how external systems and institutions, including markets, influence corporate governance.|$|E
25|$|The Bill {{established}} {{a set of}} principles that CIDA {{must take into account}} when adjudging how aid is to be spent. First, it requires that the perspectives and concerns of those who receive ODA be taken into account. This means that Canadian aid flows will have to respect the priorities of its beneficiaries - the people living in poverty. Secondly, it requires that ODA be promulgated in <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> Canadian values and foreign policy, sustainable development, and the promotion of democracy and human rights. The Bill also requires that Canadian foreign aid spending be more transparent and accountable to Parliament and must be reported in a timely manner.|$|E
25|$|The Court was {{determined}} to simultaneously save capital punishment in the United States and impose some reasoned basis for carrying it out. That reasoning flows from the Eighth Amendment's {{cruel and unusual punishment}} clause. Although capital punishment, per se, was not found by the Court to be cruel and unusual, it must still be carried out in <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society. In the Court's view, the country's history with capital punishment suggests that those evolving standards of decency could not tolerate a return to the mandatory death penalty for murder that had prevailed in medieval England.|$|E

25|$|Insulin {{is a major}} {{regulator}} of endocannabinoid (EC) {{metabolism and}} insulin treatment {{has been shown to}} reduce intracellular ECs, the 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG) and anandamide (AEA), which correspond with insulin-sensitive expression changes in enzymes of EC metabolism. In insulin-resistant adipocytes, patterns of insulin-induced enzyme expression is disturbed in <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> elevated EC synthesis and reduced EC degradation. Findings suggest that insulin-resistant adipocytes fail to regulate EC metabolism and decrease intracellular EC levels in response to insulin stimulation, whereby obese insulin-resistant individuals exhibit increased concentrations of ECs. This dysregulation contributes to excessive visceral fat accumulation and reduced adiponectin release from abdominal adipose tissue, and further to the onset of several cardiometabolic risk factors that are associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes.|$|E
