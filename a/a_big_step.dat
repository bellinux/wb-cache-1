5|$|By June 1942, the Manhattan Project {{had reached}} the stage where the {{construction}} of production facilities could be contemplated. On June 25, 1942, the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) S-1 Executive Committee deliberated on {{where they should be}} located. Moving directly to a megawatt production plant looked like <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>step,</b> given that many industrial processes do not easily scale from the laboratory to production size. An intermediate step of building a pilot plant was considered prudent. For the pilot plutonium separation plant, a site was wanted close to the Metallurgical Laboratory, where the research was being carried out, but for reasons of safety and security, it was not desirable to locate the facilities in a densely populated area like Chicago.|$|E

The rescue of 1520 Sedgwick was largely made possible through a sustained organizing campaign within the tenant body.

25|$|Ramtanu Lahiri {{had already}} {{come under the}} {{influence}} of David Hare and Henry Vivian Derozio. Now {{it was his turn to}} be influenced by Thomas Babington Macaulay. Initially the English had sponsored classical education in India, based on Arabic, Persian and Sanskrit, but as new ideas came from England, it was felt essential to introduce Indians to western education, particularly the sciences. There were strong protagonists on both sides. Indeed, the setting up of Hindu College in 1817 was <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>step</b> forward in the direction of western education.|$|E

The PKK demanded {{that it should}} be recognized as a legitimate entity and not as a terrorist organization. The PKK had been banned in Germany in 1993. If the PKK's demand had passed, it would be <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>step</b> for Damascus, not just for the water issues and Hatay demands, but also because a Western country was negotiating with a banned organization. It would be a big blow to Turkey as the inability to stop terrorism in the country could end with balkanization of the region.|$|E
25|$|The new Fronte was <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>step</b> {{away from}} the SS20, making the switch from a rear-engined, rear-wheel drive {{configuration}} to a more up-to-date transversely mounted engine in front, driving the front wheels. Wheelbase was increased from 2030 to 2150mm and the new car was much more spacious. The four-door Fronte had an opening rear glass window, whereas the two-door Alto got a proper rear hatch. In some export markets the car was just known as the Suzuki SS40. In Europe, the Fronte (labelled Alto) was also sold with a 796cc four-stroke three (SS80) from July 1981 and was 100mm longer, thanks to bigger bumpers. These cars also received larger 12-inch wheels. Four-doors received the SS80F chassis code, while three-door passenger versions were called SS80G.|$|E
25|$|The new {{calendar}} {{received little}} {{support from the}} Indian Zoroastrian community, since it was considered to contradict the injunctions expressed in the Denkard. In Iran, however, the Fasli calendar gained momentum following a campaign in 1930 to persuade the Iranian Zoroastrians to adopt it, under {{the title of the}} Bastani (traditional) calendar. In AD 1925, the Iranian Parliament had introduced a new Iranian calendar, which (independent of the Fasli movement) incorporated both points proposed by the Fasili Society, and since the Iranian national calendar had also retained the Zoroastrian names of the months, it was not <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>step</b> to integrate the two. The Bastani calendar was duly accepted by many of the Zoroastrians. Many orthodox Iranian Zoroastrians, especially the Sharifabadis of Yazd, continued to use the Qadimi, however.|$|E

25|$|Government {{repression}} of political dissent has dropped sharply since the mid-1990s. The previous decades are sometimes {{described as the}} Years of Lead (Les Années de Plomb), and included forced disappearances, killings of government opponents and secret internment camps such as Tazmamart. To examine the abuses committed {{during the reign of}} King Hassan II (1961–1999), the government has set up an Equity and Reconciliation Commission (IER), which is to rehabilitate the victims, and pay compensation for state outrages against them. This has been hailed internationally as <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>step</b> forward, and an example to the Arab world. However, the IER has also come under attack from parts of the human rights-community, since its mission was not to reveal the identities of or prosecute human rights offenders, which most of the victims were requesting.|$|E

Amr was so fascinated that after the show he hugged Samer and they started their musical journey. During Salah and Samer's work in Bahrain they met Amr Khairy, the drummer, in 1996. Many has already given Khairy positive reviews and joining forces with the two friends on the musical project was <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>step.</b> Khairy was introduced to the music and was impressed resulting in the trio performing gigs and playing in a 5 star jazz club called the Magical Blue Moods. However, the group hasn't even started yet although there were plans to 'do something' in the future. Returning from Bahrain, everyone went to their different musical projects and the trio was separated to be reunited again in 2000.|$|E

APOEL got their Europa League group stage campaign off to a winning start after coming from behind to beat FC Astana 2–1 at GSP Stadium. On matchday 2, APOEL earned their first ever continental group stage away win with a shock 0–1 victory over Olympiacos in Piraeus. On matchday 3, two second-half penalties condemned APOEL to their first defeat of their Europa League campaign, as they went down 3–1 away to Young Boys.

50|$|The {{collaboration}} with the Kurchatov Institute is directed at {{the construction of the}} Ignitor machine, the first experiment proposed to achieve ignition conditions by nuclear fusion reactions on the basis of existing knowledge of plasma physics and available technologies. Ignitor is part of the line of research on high magnetic field, experiments producing high density plasmas that began with the Alcator and the Frascati Torus programs at MIT and in Italy, respectively. It remains, at the world level, the only experiment capable of reaching ignition by the magnetic field confinement approach.

25|$|On August 1 of {{this year}} the 1929 Palestine riots broke out between Palestinians and Jews {{over control of the}} Western Wall. The rioting, {{initiated}} in part when British police tore down a screen the Jews had constructed in front of the Wall, continued {{until the end of the}} month. In total, 133 Jews and 116 Palestinians were killed. Two of the more famous incidents occurring during these riots were the August 23–24 1929 Hebron massacre, in which almost 70 Jews were killed by Palestinians and the remaining Jews are forced to stay at Hebron. The Palestinians had been told that Jews were killing Palestinians. Jews would not return to Hebron until after the Six-Day War in 1967. The other major clash was the 1929 Safed massacre, in which 18–20 Jews were killed by Palestinians in Safed in similar fashion. Elsewhere in the Middle East, Iraq took <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>step</b> toward gaining independence from the British. The Iraqi government had, since the end of World War I and the beginning of the British Mandate in the Middle East, consistently resisted British hegemony. In September, Great Britain announced it would support Iraq's inclusion in the League of Nations, signaling the beginning of the end of their direct control of the region.|$|E
