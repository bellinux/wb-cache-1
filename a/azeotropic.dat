25|$|There are {{basically}} three dehydration processes {{to remove the}} water from an <b>azeotropic</b> ethanol/water mixture. The first process, used in many early fuel ethanol plants, is called <b>azeotropic</b> distillation and consists of adding benzene or cyclohexane to the mixture. When these components {{are added to the}} mixture, it forms a heterogeneous <b>azeotropic</b> mixture in vapor–liquid-liquid equilibrium, which when distilled produces anhydrous ethanol in the column bottom, and a vapor mixture of water, ethanol, and cyclohexane/benzene.|$|E
25|$|The boiling {{points of}} {{components}} in an azeotrope overlap {{to form a}} band. By exposing an azeotrope to a vacuum or positive pressure, it's possible to bias the boiling point of one component {{away from the other}} by exploiting the differing vapour pressure curves of each; the curves may overlap at the <b>azeotropic</b> point, but are unlikely to be remain identical further along the pressure axis either side of the <b>azeotropic</b> point. When the bias is great enough, the two boiling points no longer overlap and so the <b>azeotropic</b> band disappears.|$|E
25|$|The {{hydrated}} solid can be dehydrated {{with heat}} or by <b>azeotropic</b> distillation.|$|E
25|$|Powdered PTFE {{is used in}} a {{suspension}} with a low-viscosity, <b>azeotropic</b> mixture of siloxane ethers to create a lubricant for use in twisty puzzles.|$|E
25|$|Pressure-swing {{distillation}} {{is essentially}} the same as the unidirectional distillation used to break <b>azeotropic</b> mixtures, but here both positive and negative pressures may be employed.|$|E
25|$|To break <b>azeotropic</b> {{distillation}}s {{and cross}} distillation boundaries, {{such as in}} the DeRosier Problem, it is necessary to increase the composition of the light key in the distillate.|$|E
25|$|If two {{solvents}} {{can form}} a positive azeotrope, then distillation of any mixture of those constituents {{will result in}} the distillate being closer in composition to the azeotrope than the starting mixture. For example, if a 50/50 mixture of ethanol and water is distilled once, the distillate will be 80% ethanol and 20% water, which is closer to the <b>azeotropic</b> mixture than the original. Distilling the 80/20% mixture produces a distillate that is 87% ethanol and 13% water. Further repeated distillations will produce mixtures that are progressively closer to the <b>azeotropic</b> ratio of 95.5/4.5%. No numbers of distillations will ever result in a distillate that exceeds the <b>azeotropic</b> ratio. Likewise, when distilling a mixture of ethanol and water that is richer in ethanol than the azeotrope, the distillate (contrary to intuition) will be poorer in ethanol than the original but slightly richer than the azeotrope. This means the solution left behind will be richer in ethanol.|$|E
25|$|Large scale {{industrial}} distillation applications {{include both}} batch and continuous fractional, vacuum, <b>azeotropic,</b> extractive, and steam distillation. The {{most widely used}} industrial applications of continuous, steady-state fractional distillation are in petroleum refineries, petrochemical and chemical plants and natural gas processing plants.|$|E
25|$|Rectified spirit, an <b>azeotropic</b> {{composition}} of 96% ethanol containing 4% water, {{is used instead}} of anhydrous ethanol for various purposes. Wine spirits are about 94% ethanol (188 proof). The impurities {{are different from those}} in 95% (190 proof) laboratory ethanol.|$|E
25|$|A rare type {{of complex}} binary {{azeotrope}} {{is one where}} the boiling point and condensation point curves touch at two points in the phase diagram. Such a system is called a double azeotrope, and will have two <b>azeotropic</b> compositions and boiling points. An example is water and N-methylethylenediamine.|$|E
25|$|For {{both the}} top and bottom traces, the {{temperature}} point of the azeotrope is the constant temperature chosen for the graph. If the ambient pressure is controlled to be equal to the total vapor pressure at the <b>azeotropic</b> mixture, then the mixture will boil at this fixed temperature.|$|E
25|$|Mixtures {{of ethanol}} and water form an {{azeotrope}} at about 89 mole-% ethanol and 11 mole-% water or {{a mixture of}} 95.6 percent ethanol by mass (or about 97% alcohol by volume) at normal pressure, which boils at 351K (78°C). This <b>azeotropic</b> composition is strongly temperature- and pressure-dependent and vanishes at temperatures below 303K.|$|E
25|$|Extractive {{distillation}} {{is similar}} to <b>azeotropic</b> distillation, except {{in this case the}} entrainer is less volatile than any of the azeotrope's constituents. For example, the azeotrope of 20% acetone with 80% chloroform can be broken by adding water and distilling the result. The water forms a separate layer in which the acetone preferentially dissolves. The result is that the distillate is richer in chloroform than the original azeotrope.|$|E
25|$|Column stills are {{frequently}} {{used in the}} production of grain whisky and are the most commonly used type of still {{in the production of}} bourbon and other American whiskeys. Column stills behave like a series of single pot stills, formed in a long vertical tube. Whereas a single pot still charged with wine might yield a vapour enriched to 40–50% alcohol, a column still can achieve a vapour alcohol content of 95.6%; an <b>azeotropic</b> mixture of alcohol and water.|$|E
25|$|A {{mixture of}} 5% water with 95% {{tetrahydrofuran}} {{is an example}} of an azeotrope that can be economically separated using a pressure swing – a swing in this case between 1 atm and 8 atm. By contrast the composition of the water to ethanol azeotrope discussed earlier is not affected enough by pressure to be easily separated using pressure swings and instead, an entrainer may be added that either modifies the <b>azeotropic</b> composition and exhibits immiscibility with one of the components, or extractive distillation may be used.|$|E
25|$|Ethylene glycol {{is used as}} a {{protecting}} {{group for}} carbonyl groups in organic synthesis. Treating a ketone or aldehyde with ethylene glycol in the presence of an acid catalyst (e.g., p-toluenesulfonic acid; BF3·Et2O) gives the corresponding a 1,3-dioxolane, which is resistant to bases and other nucleophiles. The 1,3-dioxolane protecting group can thereafter be removed by further acid hydrolysis. In this example, isophorone was protected using ethylene glycol with p-toluenesulfonic acid in moderate yield. Water was removed by <b>azeotropic</b> distillation to shift the equilibrium to the right.|$|E
25|$|The {{idealized}} {{model is}} accurate {{in the case}} of chemically similar liquids, such as benzene and toluene. In other cases, severe deviations from Raoult's law and Dalton's law are observed, most famously in the mixture of ethanol and water. These compounds, when heated together, form an azeotrope, which is a composition with a boiling point higher or lower than the boiling point of each separate liquid. Virtually all liquids, when mixed and heated, will display <b>azeotropic</b> behaviour. Although there are computational methods {{that can be used to}} estimate the behavior of a mixture of arbitrary components, the only way to obtain accurate vapor–liquid equilibrium data is by measurement.|$|E
25|$|Absolute or {{anhydrous}} alcohol refers to ethanol {{with a low}} water content. There are various grades with maximum water contents ranging from 1% to a few parts per million (ppm) levels. If <b>azeotropic</b> distillation is used to remove water, it will contain trace amounts of the material separation agent (e.g. benzene). Absolute alcohol is not intended for human consumption. Absolute ethanol {{is used as a}} solvent for laboratory and industrial applications, where water will react with other chemicals, and as fuel alcohol. Spectroscopic ethanol is an absolute ethanol with a low absorbance in ultraviolet and visible light, fit for use as a solvent in ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy.|$|E
25|$|If two {{solvents}} {{can form}} a negative azeotrope, then distillation of any mixture of those constituents {{will result in}} the residue being closer in composition to the azeotrope than the original mixture. For example, if a hydrochloric acid solution contains less than 20.2% hydrogen chloride, boiling the mixture will leave behind a solution that is richer in hydrogen chloride than the original. If the solution initially contains more than 20.2% hydrogen chloride, then boiling will leave behind a solution that is poorer in hydrogen chloride than the original. Boiling of any hydrochloric acid solution long enough will cause the solution left behind to approach the <b>azeotropic</b> ratio.|$|E
25|$|Vapor {{pressure}} of both pure liquids {{as well as}} mixtures is a sensitive function of temperature. As a rule, vapor {{pressure of}} a liquid increases nearly exponentially {{as a function of}} temperature. If the graph were replotted for a different fixed temperature, then the total vapor pressure at the <b>azeotropic</b> composition will certainly change, but {{it is also possible that}} the composition at which the azeotrope occurs will change. This implies that the composition of an azeotrope is affected by the pressure chosen at which to boil the mixture. Ordinarily distillation is done at atmospheric pressure, but with proper equipment it is possible to carry out distillation at a wide variety of pressures, both above and below atmospheric pressure.|$|E
25|$|Other {{methods of}} {{separation}} involve introducing an additional agent, called an entrainer, {{that will affect}} the volatility {{of one of the}} azeotrope constituents more than another. When an entrainer is added to a binary azeotrope to form a ternary azeotrope, and the resulting mixture distilled, the method is called <b>azeotropic</b> distillation. The best known example is adding benzene or cyclohexane to the water/ethanol azeotrope. With cyclohexane as the entrainer, the ternary azeotrope is 7% water, 17% ethanol, and 76% cyclohexane, and boils at 62.1°C. Just enough cyclohexane is added to the water/ethanol azeotrope to engage all of the water into the ternary azeotrope. When the mixture is then boiled, the azeotrope vaporizes leaving a residue composed almost entirely of the excess ethanol.|$|E
25|$|With {{increasing}} attention {{being paid}} to saving energy, many methods have been proposed that avoid distillation altogether for dehydration. Of these methods, a third method has emerged and has been adopted {{by the majority of}} modern ethanol plants. This new process uses molecular sieves to remove water from fuel ethanol. In this process, ethanol vapor under pressure passes through a bed of molecular sieve beads. The bead's pores are sized to allow adsorption of water while excluding ethanol. After a period of time, the bed is regenerated under vacuum or in the flow of inert atmosphere (e.g. N2) to remove the adsorbed water. Two beds are often used so that one is available to adsorb water while the other is being regenerated. This dehydration technology can account for energy saving of 3,000 btus/gallon (840 kJ/L) compared to earlier <b>azeotropic</b> distillation.|$|E
25|$|A {{hypothetical}} azeotrope of constituents X and Y {{is shown}} in the adjacent diagram. Two at an arbitrarily chosen low pressure and another at an arbitrarily chosen, but higher, pressure. The composition of the azeotrope is substantially different between the high- and low-pressure plots – higher in X for the high-pressure system. The goal is to separate X in as high a concentration as possible starting from point A. At the low pressure, it is possible by progressive distillation to reach a distillate at the point, B, which is {{on the same side of}} the azeotrope as A. Note that successive distillation steps near the <b>azeotropic</b> composition exhibit very little difference in boiling temperature. If this distillate is now exposed to the high pressure, it boils at point C. From C, by progressive distillation it is possible to reach a distillate at the point D, which is on the same side of the high-pressure azeotrope as C. If that distillate is then exposed again to the low pressure, it boils at point E, which is on the opposite side of the low-pressure azeotrope to A. So, by means of the pressure swing, it is possible to cross over the low-pressure azeotrope.|$|E
500|$|Hydrochloric acid is the {{preferred}} acid in titration for determining the amount of bases. Strong acid titrants give more precise results due to a more distinct endpoint. <b>Azeotropic,</b> or [...] "constant-boiling", hydrochloric acid (roughly 20.2%) {{can be used as}} a primary standard in quantitative analysis, although its exact concentration depends on the atmospheric pressure when it is prepared.|$|E
2500|$|If the {{azeotrope}} is {{not considered}} sufficiently pure for use, there exist some techniques to break the azeotrope to give a pure distillate. This set of techniques are known as <b>azeotropic</b> distillation. Some techniques achieve this by [...] "jumping" [...] over the <b>azeotropic</b> composition (by adding another component {{to create a new}} azeotrope, or by varying the pressure). Others work by chemically or physically removing or sequestering the impurity. For example, to purify ethanol beyond 95%, a drying agent (or desiccant, such as potassium carbonate) can be added to convert the soluble water into insoluble water of crystallization. Molecular sieves are often used for this purpose as well.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{processes}} {{require that}} the isopropyl alcohol be separated from water and other by-products by distillation. Isopropyl alcohol and water form an azeotrope and simple distillation gives a material that is 87.9% by weight isopropyl alcohol and 12.1% by weight water. [...] Pure (anhydrous) isopropyl alcohol is made by <b>azeotropic</b> distillation of the wet isopropyl alcohol using either diisopropyl ether or cyclohexane as azeotroping agents.|$|E
2500|$|If the {{constituents}} of a mixture {{are not completely}} miscible, an azeotrope can be found inside the miscibility gap. This type of azeotrope is called heterogeneous azeotrope. If the <b>azeotropic</b> composition is outside the miscibility gap or {{the constituents}} of the mixture are completely miscible, the type of azeotrope is called a homogeneous azeotrope. [...] A heteroazeotropic distillation (see heteroazeotrope) will have two liquid phases.|$|E
2500|$|Distillation {{is one of}} {{the primary}} tools that chemists and {{chemical}} engineers use to separate mixtures into their constituents. Because distillation cannot separate the constituents of an azeotrope, the separation of <b>azeotropic</b> mixtures (also called azeotrope breaking) is a topic of considerable interest. Indeed, this difficulty led some early investigators to believe that azeotropes were actually compounds of their constituents. But there are two reasons for believing {{that this is not the}} case. One is that the molar ratio of the constituents of an azeotrope is not generally the ratio of small integers. For example, the azeotrope formed by water and acetonitrile contains 2.253 moles ( [...] or 9/4 with a relative error of just 2% [...] ) of acetonitrile for each mole of water. A more compelling reason for believing that azeotropes are not compounds is, as discussed in the last section, that the composition of an azeotrope can be affected by pressure. Contrast that with a true compound, carbon dioxide for example, which is two moles of oxygen for each mole of carbon no matter what pressure the gas is observed at. That <b>azeotropic</b> composition can be affected by pressure suggests a means by which such a mixture can be separated.|$|E
2500|$|Many <b>azeotropic</b> {{mixtures}} of pairs of compounds are known, and many azeotropes {{of three or}} more compounds are also known. In such a case {{it is not possible}} to separate the components by fractional distillation. There are two types of azeotropes: minimum boiling azeotrope and maximum boiling azeotrope. A solution that shows greater positive deviation from Raoult's law forms a minimum boiling azeotrope at a specific composition. For example, an ethanol-water mixture (obtained by fermentation of sugars) on fractional distillation yields a solution containing approximately 95% by volume of ethanol. Once this composition has been achieved, the liquid and vapour have the same composition, and no further separation occurs.|$|E
