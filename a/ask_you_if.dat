2500|$|John Conteh was on {{the same}} show as Peter Cook and Dudley Moore. Parkinson asked the boxer {{if it was true}} that he never had sex before a fight. While Conteh looked embarrassed, Cook chipped in with an {{observation}} for the host: [...] "I wouldn't <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> you have sex before a show. I can see that you have." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the urging}} of his friends, Patel won an {{election}} to become the sanitation commissioner of Ahmedabad in 1917. While often clashing with British officials on civic issues, he did not show any interest in politics. Upon hearing of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, he joked to the lawyer and political activist, Ganesh Vasudev Mavlankar, that [...] "Gandhi would <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> {{you know how to}} shift pebbles from wheat. And that is supposed to bring independence." [...] A subsequent meeting with Gandhi, in October 1917 brought a radical change in Patel and ushered him into the Indian independence struggle.|$|E

2500|$|Now that we {{are talking}} about {{literary}} subjects I <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> you know a great writer, Rafael Barrett, with a free and bold spirit. With tears in my eyes and on my knees I beg you that when you have a national or two to spend, go straight to Mendesky's, or any other library- and ask for a copy of [...] "Looking the life" [...] of this author. I think that it was published in Montevideo. Is a great book, and reading it soothed me from the foolishness of Giusti, Soiza, O'Reilly and my cousin Alvarito Melián Lafinur.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do excuse me. But I MUST <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> {{it was you}} {{we heard}} playing the flute so {{perfectly}} wonderfully, just before dinner." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That's why I <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{had been}} painted,--so {{as to make}} some little {{distinction}} between the two. I am a painter by profession, and do portraits." ...|$|R
60|$|Of course I regard {{your time}} as valuable, and {{consider}} it so when I <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> you could devote {{any of it}} to this purpose.|$|E
6000|$|Grace laughed. [...] "One would {{certainly}} fancy {{that you had}} quite enough already--but I wonder if one might <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> you have heard from Reggie lately?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> {{you call}} this FAIR to the boy, Mr. Twing?" [...] said Mrs. Martin hotly; [...] "but is this your idea of discipline?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We will away, {{straight}} for your father's trading-post." [...] Jean Bevoir paused a moment. [...] "It may be I can persuade Pontiac to give <b>you</b> up. <b>If</b> I can, {{so much the}} better. But if not, remember what I have told <b>you.</b> <b>If</b> Pontiac <b>asks</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will go with me, say yes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> couldn't. But you can't. It's too dreadful for me, as so near a relation, to have, loyally--loyally to YOU--to say it. But he's impossible." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No, we doesn't want nothink," [...] {{repeated}} the domestic, stoutly. [...] "Missus said so, an' she bid me <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> you'd like {{a cup of}} tea?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{came down}} to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> you will come up to lunch, Jim, but I suppose {{you will not be}} able to tear {{yourself}} away from here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Art thou mocking thy master, Gino? I have <b>asked</b> <b>thee</b> <b>if</b> {{thou art}} {{acquainted with the}} person of a certain Jacopo Frontoni, a dweller here in Venice?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aye!" [...] she said; [...] "I <b>asked</b> <b>thee</b> <b>if</b> thou wert content. Thou hast humiliated a {{daughter}} of Cæsar, a humiliation which she is not like to forget." ...|$|R

60|$|Dr Oakes {{was a big}} {{man with}} a breezy manner, the sort of doctor who hits you with the force of a {{sledge-hammer}} in the small ribs, and <b>asks</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> felt anything then. It was on this principle that he acted with regard to Barry's ankle. He seized it in both hands and gave it a wrench.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{little while}} ago you spoke of your indignation at the inequalities and injustices of the world, and when I <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had always felt this, you replied that this feeling had grown upon you.

6000|$|Clarence's {{previous}} experience of this grim, smileless Californian chaff was not calculated to restore his confidence. He drew {{away from the}} cabin, and repeated doggedly, [...] "I <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> {{this was the way}} to the mines." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I'm so glad! I couldn't {{live where}} there were no trees--something vital in me would starve. Well, after that, there's no use <b>asking</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> there's a brook {{anywhere}} near. THAT would be expecting too much." ...|$|R
