50|$|The largest {{weakness}} of any TOFU-style model {{is that a}} human being must initially validate every interaction, which does not scale infinitely, and can quickly scale beyond the capabilities of any group of people using and managing computers with a need for trusted and secure protocols. People tend to <b>approve</b> <b>without</b> verification, {{not to mention the}} increased surface area for human error.|$|R

5000|$|Commentators argued that, {{being just}} 90 metres {{downstream}} {{from the very}} wide O'Connell Bridge, the new bridge could not bring much benefit, and any benefit would be cancelled out by the {{negative impact on the}} city's classical Georgian urban plan - especially to the symmetry of spacing between existing Liffey bridges.
