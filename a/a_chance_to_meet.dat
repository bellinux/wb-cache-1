5|$|This year, {{the first}} ever EA Sports Jersey Creator Contest was held to design the jerseys for both the rookie and the sophomore team. The contest called for the {{participants}} {{to come up with}} a computer-generated jersey design that would replace the individual team jerseys worn by the players during the Rookie Challenge. Of 12,000 participants, 18-year-old Tim Ahmed, a freshman at Baruch College, won the contest. Ahmed won a free trip to Phoenix and <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> players.

25|$|Into {{the early}} decades of the twentieth century Vietnam, young men and women used the festival as <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> future life companions.

50|$|Early in 1973, {{progress}} on the generation I Wankel engine had progressed {{to the point where}} GM felt it had <b>a</b> good <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> '75 emissions standards. <b>To</b> <b>meet</b> those standards GM had to scrap the design theory of widely spaced dual spark plugs and move them closer to the rotor chamber, Mazda fashion.

In 1927 he had a victory over Henner Henkel at the Youth Games. In 1929 at the age of 13 he already defeated then-Polish champion Maximilian Stolarow. In 1931, he won the Austrian junior tennis championships as well as the international junior championships of Berlin in singles and doubles. He was ranked tenth on the Austrian rankings. The next year he was classified fifth. While in 1934 he climbed to number four on the same list. In 1935 he won the national singles and doubles championships and drew attention with back to back straight victories against famed players Franz Wilhelm Matejka and Hermann Artens to be crowned champion. Subsequently, he rose to the second place after Matejka. Later he became member of the Wiener Park Club.|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{longitudinal}} {{study was to investigate}} the relationship between adolescents’ psychosocial wellbeing and internet-specific parenting on meeting online contacts IRL. Information was collected amongst adolescents who participated in the Monitor Internet and Youth of the Addiction Research Institute (IVO, The Netherlands) : 5237 adolescents in 2007, 5403 adolescents in 2008 and 2416 adolescents participated in both surveys. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses were performed. The results show that low self-esteem and low feelings of loneliness predict <b>a</b> larger <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> online contacts IRL a year later. For depression and social anxiety only cross-sectional relations were found, indicating that depressed feelings are related <b>to</b> <b>a</b> larger <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> online contacts IRL, but that this is no causal relationship. In addition, negative longitudinal relations were found between parental rules about the content of internet use, parental monitoring and the quality of communication about internet use on meeting online contacts IRL a year later. Cross-sectionally, positive relations were found between the parental rules about the duration of internet use and the frequency of the communication about internet use. Overall, when parents want to prevent their children from meeting online contacts IRL, {{it would be wise to}} impose strict rules about the content of their children’s internet use, to monitor their internet use and to have high quality communication about it...|$|R

It was then decided that Jaura would accompany her to film shoots, so that continuity in training could be maintained. Though he did not get <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> Kom, he used her videos to study her body language and prepare a workout plan for Chopra, who started training in April 2013.

500|$|Barker {{grew up in}} the Florence Park area of Oxford, {{and went}} to Donnington Junior School, and then the City of Oxford High School for Boys. [...] Barker's {{chemistry}} textbook at Oxford was previously used by T. E. Lawrence. He found his talent for humour at school and developed his musical ability by singing in the choir at St James's, his local church. He got into the sixth form a year early after gaining the School Certificate but he felt what he was learning would be of no use to him in later life and so left as soon as he could. After leaving school he trained as an architect but gave it up after six months, feeling he was not skilled enough. Barker took his sister Vera's job as a bank clerk at the Westminster Bank after she had left to become a nurse. He harboured dreams of becoming an actor, and took up amateur dramatics, although initially he just saw the pastime as <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> girls. For 18 months, while at the bank, he worked as an actor and stage manager, making his first appearance in A Murder Has Been Arranged as the musical director of the play-within-a-play.

40|$|Abstract—In-network data {{aggregation}} {{is a useful}} technique to reduce redundant data and to improve communication efficiency. Traditional {{data aggregation}} schemes for wireless sensor networks usually rely on a fixed routing structure to ensure data can be aggregated at certain sensor nodes. However, they cannot be applied in highly mobile vehicular environments. In this paper, we propose an adaptive forwarding delay control scheme, namely Catch-Up, which dynamically changes the forwarding speed of nearby reports so that they have <b>a</b> better <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> each other and be aggregated together. The Catch-Up scheme is designed based on a distributed learning algorithm. Each vehicle learns from local observations and chooses a delay based on learning results. The simulation results demonstrate that our scheme can efficiently {{reduce the number of}} redundant reports and achieve a good trade-off between delay and communication overhead. Index Terms—Vehicular networks, data aggregation, distributed learning. ...|$|R

In this field, we notice the sharp fundamental problem that voluminous complex models were developed {{but there is an}} absence of sufficient data of interest for justifying the success in tackling the real engineering problems. Instead of following the myth of using simple models to face the complex reality, we select and review some practical models, particularly the stochastic processes behind them. The Models in three quick growth areas: age models, condition monitoring technique related models, say, proportional intensity and their extensions, and shock and wearing models, including the delay-time models are reviewed. With the belief that only those stochastic processes reflecting the instinct nature of the actual physical processes of repairable systems, without excessive assumptions, may have <b>a</b> better <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> the demands of engineers and managers...|$|R
