There is now serious concern for the long-term genetic viability of <b>red</b> <b>mulberry</b> because of extensive hybridization in some areas.|$|R

50|$|The {{edible fruit}} is dark purple, almost black, when ripe, 2 - 3 cm long, a {{compound}} cluster of several small drupes; it is richly flavoured, {{similar to the}} <b>red</b> <b>mulberry</b> (Morus rubra) but unlike the more insipid fruit of the white mulberry (Morus alba).|$|R
5000|$|The ripe {{fruit is}} edible and {{is widely used}} in pies, tarts, wines, cordials, and herbal teas. The fruit of the black {{mulberry}} (native to southwest Asia) and the <b>red</b> <b>mulberry</b> (native to eastern North America) have the strongest flavor, which has been likened to 'fireworks in the mouth'.|$|R

5000|$|... "On that land, {{there are}} many Fusang plants (perhaps <b>red</b> <b>mulberry)</b> that produce oval-shaped leaves similar to paulownia and edible purplish-red fruits like pears. The place was rich in copper and traces of gold and silver but no iron. The native tribes in Fusang were civilized, living in well-organized communities. They {{produced}} paper from the bark of the Fusang plants for writing and produced cloth from the fibers of the bark, which they used for robes or wadding. Their houses or cabins were constructed with <b>red</b> <b>mulberry</b> wood. The fruits and young shoots of the plants were one of their food sources. They raised deer for meat and milk, just as the Chinese raised cattle at home, and produced cheese with deer milk. They traveled on horseback and transported their goods with carts or sledges pulled by horses, buffalo, or deer." ...|$|R
50|$|Morus rubra, {{commonly}} known as the <b>red</b> <b>mulberry,</b> is a species of mulberry native to eastern and central North America. It is found from Ontario, Minnesota, and Vermont south to southern Florida, and west as far as southeastern South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, and central Texas. There have been reports of isolated populations (very likely naturalized) in New Mexico, Idaho, and British Columbia.|$|R

5000|$|The {{fruit of}} the white {{mulberry}} - an East Asian species extensively naturalized in urban regions of eastern North America - has a different flavor, sometimes characterized as refreshing and a little tart, {{with a bit of}} gumminess to it and a hint of vanilla.

50|$|The <b>American</b> <b>red</b> {{squirrel}} (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) is one {{of three}} species of tree squirrel currently classified in the genus Tamiasciurus, known as the pine squirrels (the others are the Douglas squirrel, T. douglasii, and Mearns's squirrel, T. mearnsi). <b>American</b> <b>red</b> squirrels are also referred to as pine squirrels, North <b>American</b> <b>red</b> squirrels, boomers, and chickarees. They are medium-sized (200-250 g) diurnal mammals that defend a year-round exclusive territory. The diet of these tree squirrels is specialized on the seeds of conifer cones. As such, they are widely distributed across North America wherever conifers are common, except on the Pacific coast, where they are replaced by Douglas squirrels. Recently, <b>American</b> <b>red</b> squirrels have been expanding their range to include primarily hardwood areas.|$|R
50|$|The eastern <b>American</b> <b>red</b> fox has a {{primarily}} carnivorous diet {{dominated by}} small mammals (Frey, 2013).

Food sources can vary depending on region, but cottontails rabbits (Sylvilagus) {{are the most important}} prey for eastern <b>American</b> <b>red</b> foxes (Frey, 2013). The eastern <b>American</b> <b>red</b> fox will consume larger animals as carrion, and their diet changes depending on seasonal variability (Tesky, 1995).|$|R

40|$|Avulsion of tooth is {{complete}} displacement of tooth {{out of its}} socket that results in mutilation of periodontal ligaments. The desirable treatment option is replantation of the tooth. However, unsuccessful replantation {{is a matter of}} great discontentment. Unsuccessful replantation is due to inappropriate management of the avulsed tooth. Protection of teeth from desiccation due to drying of the periodontal ligament tissue, by keeping it in storage media can improve the outcome of the treatment. This review paper focuses on the use of natural products as storage media for avulsed teeth. In vitro and in vivo research published during 1995 - 2014, allowing open access on National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database and articles on EBSCO host (EBSCO-Elton B. Stephens Company) were included. It was found that natural products such as milk, coconut water, propolis, green tea, <b>red</b> <b>mulberry,</b> Aloe vera, egg-white and pomegranate have shown ability to maintain viability of periodontal ligament cells of avulsed teeth. Few natural products such as coconut water and milk can be used in raw form, while other products such as green tea and <b>red</b> <b>mulberry</b> need processing. Ability to maintain periodontal cell viability for a longer time is warranted in cases of major accidents, where teeth can be replanted only after other major surgeries. Natural products have easy availability, greater efficacy and longer storage time as compared to Hank′s balanced salt solution which has been recommended by the International Association of Dental Traumatology as standard solution for storage of avulsed teeth. Natural products have shown good qualities in in vitro experiments; further in vivo studies are needed to evaluate their efficacy as storage media...|$|R

50|$|The <b>American</b> <b>red</b> fox (Vulpes vulpes fulvus), {{commonly}} known as the eastern <b>American</b> <b>red</b> fox, is a North American subspecies of the red fox (Vulpes vulpes). Historically, red foxes were classified as two species: Vulpes vulpes in Eurasia and Vulpes fulva in the Americas (Tesky, 1995). Since 1959 they have been considered to be a singular species of Vulpes vulpes, with Vulpes fulva one of the ten subspecies (Hall, 1981; Kamler & Ballard, 2002). The <b>American</b> <b>red</b> fox differs from European forms by the greater breadth of its feet, its longer fur, noticeably shorter nose and ears, and its finer brush. According to hunters' accounts, they have less vigor and endurance in the chase compared to the European variant.|$|R
