5|$|Greater London's {{population}} declined {{steadily in}} the decades after the Second World War, from an estimated peak of 8.6million in 1939 to around 6.8million in the 1980s.

5|$|Lundy {{was granted}} to the Knights Templar by Henry II in 1160. The Templars were <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>international</b> {{maritime}} force at this time, with interests in North Devon, and almost certainly an important port at Bideford or on the River Taw in Barnstaple. This was probably because of the increasing threat posed by the Norse sea raiders; however, {{it is unclear whether}} they ever took possession of the island. Ownership was disputed by the Marisco family who may have already been on the island during King Stephen's reign. The Mariscos were fined, and the island was cut off from necessary supplies. Evidence of the Templars' weak hold on the island came when King John, on his accession in 1199, confirmed the earlier grant.|$|E
