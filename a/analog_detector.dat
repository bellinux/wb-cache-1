First, a clinical reader assessment {{as the one}} we performed might carry an inherent bias since {{it is virtually impossible}} to totally blind readers to the image “appearance” of different reconstruction algorithms.

Further evaluation of corrected SUV would possibly alter the results. Third, we did not stratify our analyses by tumor size. Fourth, we used only a small range of possible β-values based on pretests.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a method to}} obtain the brightness and number of molecules at each pixel of an image stack obtained with a laser scanning microscope. The method is based on intensity fluctuations due to the diffusion of molecules in a pixel. For a detector operating in the analog mode, the variance must be proportional to the intensity. Once this constant has been calibrated, we use the ratio between the variance and the intensity to derive the particle brightness. Then, from {{the ratio of the}} intensity to the brightness we obtain the average number of particles in the pixel. We show that the method works with molecules in solution and that the results are comparable to those obtained with fluctuation correlation spectroscopy. We compare the results obtained with the detector operating in the analog and photon counting mode. Although the dynamic range of the detector operating in the photon counting mode is superior, the performance of the <b>analog</b> <b>detector</b> is acceptable under common experimental conditions. Since most commercial laser scanning microscopes operate in the analog mode, the calculation of brightness and number of particles can be applied to data obtained with these instruments, provided that the variance is proportional to the intensity. We demonstrate that the recovered brightness of mEGFP, independent of concentration, is similar whether measured in solution or in two different cell types. Furthermore, we distinguish between mobile and immobile components, and introduce a method to correct for slow variations in intensity. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{facilities}} are inherently noisy places. Try {{as one might}} to eliminate it, there {{always seems to be}} some residual low frequency electronic hum that works its way into low level analog signals, such as calorimetry into analog-to-digital converters (ADC). At the Fermilab Wide Band Lab, the predominant noise (between experimental hall and counting room, and between electronics racks within experimental hall and within counting room) consists of a combination of 60 Hz plus 180 Hz adding together with equal amplitudes and identical phase. The noise contributions at these low frequencies are easily removed by capacitor-coupling or isolation transformers. This approach works well for most detector systems. However, for the highest rate <b>analog</b> <b>detector</b> systems, e. g. the calorimeters within the beam stops for the electron (RESH- 0), positron (POSH-O), and photon (BGM) beams for E- 831 lFOCUS, these AC couplers introduce unacceptable signal distortion and rate-dependent analog baseline shifts. The residual 60 / 180 Hz hum, between these detectors and their ADCS, is typically on the order of 10 revolt peak-to-peak at the Wide Band Laboratory, which drastically smears the pedestal spectra and constitutes the major contribution to the resolution for these detector systems. The author, rather than continue to beat his head against the wall in trying to eliminate all this noise, implemented a simple 60 Hz analog clock ramp which was read into an ADC channel simultaneously as part of the data event record and which indicated the instantaneous phase relative to the 60 Hz AC power at Wide Band Laboratory. The pedestal was then monitored and parameterized as a function of this phase. During analysis, the digitized analog system had its phase-dependent pedestal subtracted, thereby substantially reducing the low-frequency pedestal noise. The 60 Hz analog clock circuit is a simple saw-tooth ramp generator. It is packaged in two NIM modules to provide additional isolation between the 120 VAC and 6 VAC and the output ramp. The 74121 Schmitt-trigger one-shot multi-vibrator fires at approximately 1 / 3 of the (positive) amplitude of the clipped 6 VAC, providing a 4 y-see TTL reset pulse at this specific phase of the AC line voltage. No additional phase-locking or missing cycle compensation was included. The 4 p-see pulse was used to reset the charging capacitor via the 75452 switch. The 741 op amp provided buffering and offset adjustment, producing the desired sawtooth ramp from {minus} 30 revolt to {minus} 90 revolt into the 50 ohm input of the ADC. The analog ramp, along with the half-rectified 6 VAC phase is shown in Figure 2. Although the analog ramp is fairly linear, for off-line correction of pedestal noise, the only requirement is that there be a one-to-one correspondence between the analog ramp and the phase of the line power...|$|E

Before its installation, the MVD and all associated hard- and software components have been tested. The objectives of this test - the so-called ''system test'' - were to investigate {{the performance of the}} detector and to check the stability and interplay of all components and the monitoring systems. In this thesis, the online software to calibrate the detector signals and to store and monitor the calibration parameters has been developed. Furthermore the stability of the calibration parameters over the system test running period has been investigated. In addition, the simulation of the <b>analog</b> <b>detector</b> signals (digitisation) has been worked out, and the simulated signals have been compared with the real detector response. After a short introduction into the HERA collider and the ZEUS experiment in Chap. 1, the principles of silicon strip detectors are exposed in Chap. 2. Chap. 3 describes the layout of the MVD in detail, and an overview of the data acquisition system is given. Some results of previous measurements on single silicon strip detectors of the MVD obtained with an electron test beam, which are relevant for this thesis, are summarised. The aims and the set-up of the system test are described in Chap. 4. Then results of analyses on the system test data are presented, which have been obtained in parallel to the work of this thesis. The calibration of the detector signals is described in detail in Chap. 5. After an introduction into the meaning and the calculation of the calibration parameters, the methods to obtain, monitor and store them are explained. Also an analysis is introduced, which studies the stability of the calibration parameters. Overall 98 % of all MVD channels operate reliably. The signal-to-noise ratio is approx. 14. 6 for the middle part of the MVD. The digitisation of the detector signals is described in detail in Chap. 6. The simulation model is introduced and tested with the system test data after customising the signal height. Since the free simulation parameters obtained from the test beam measurements do not describe the data, they are reevaluated from the system test data. The used method is explained, and the simulation is refined by defining a set of new parameters. The new digitisation procedure describes the system test data better for various control distributions. The simulation reaches a resolution of 26. 7 #mu#m in describing a given particle impact position. The simulation model is rather successful, but also some remaining problems are revealed. (orig.)

40|$|Accurate {{measurements}} of surface heights and atmospheric backscatter {{have been demonstrated}} with the SLA, MOLA and LITE space lidar. Recent MOLA {{measurements of}} the Mars surface have 40 cm resolution and have reduced the global uncertainty in Mars topography from a few km to approx. 10 m. GLAS is a next generation lidar being developed as part of NASA's Icesat Mission for Earth orbit. The GLAS design combines a 10 cm precision surface lidar with a sensitive dual wavelength cloud and aerosol lidar. GLAS will precisely measure the heights of the Earth's polar ice sheets, determine the height profiles of the Earth's land topography, and profile the vertical backscatter of clouds and aerosols on a global scale. GLAS will fly on a small dedicated spacecraft in a polar orbit at 598 km altitude with an inclination of 94 degrees. GLAS is scheduled to launch in summer 2001 and to operate continuously {{for a minimum of}} 3 years with a goal of 5 years. The primary mission for GLAS is to measure the seasonal and annual changes in the heights of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. GLAS will measure the vertical distance to the ice sheet from orbit with 1064 nm pulses from a Nd:Yag laser at 40 Hz. Each 5 nsec wide laser pulse is used for a single range measurement. When over land GLAS will profile the heights of the topography and vegetation. The GLAS receiver uses a I m diameter telescope and a Si APD detector. The detector signal is sampled by an all digital receiver which records each surface echo waveform with I nsec resolution and a stored echo record lengths of either 200, 400, or 600 samples. Analysis of the echo waveforms within the instrument permits discrimination between cloud and surface echoes. Ground based echo analysis permits precise ranging, determining the roughness or slopes of the surface as well as the vertical distributions of vegetation illuminated by the laser, Errors in knowledge of the laser beam pointing angle can bias height measurements of sloped surfaces. For surfaces with 2 deg. slopes, knowledge of pointing angle of the beam centroid to about 8 urad is required to achieve 10 cm height accuracy. GLAS uses a stellar reference system (SRS) to determine the pointing angle of each laser firing relative to inertial space. The SRS uses a high precision star camera oriented toward local zenith whose measurements are combined with a gyroscope to determine the inertial orientation of the SRS optical bench. The far field pattern of each laser pulse is measured with a laser reference system (LRS). Optically measuring each laser far field pattern relative to the star camera and gyroscope permits the angular offsets of each laser pulse to be determined. GLAS will also determine the vertical distributions of clouds and aerosols by measuring atmospheric backscatter profiles at both 1064 and 532 nm. The 1064 nm measurements use an <b>analog</b> <b>detector</b> and profile the height and vertical structure of thicker clouds.

The short-term performance to characterize it is batted two essentially identical diode lasers also to find short-term line width. Between these lasers phase locking is achieved with a servo small bandwidth although it is required for subradian residual phase error to use of an <b>analog</b> phase <b>detector.</b> The concept of the laser is suitable for atomic or molecular coherence experiments only due to the excellent performance...|$|R
40|$|A new 2 -D {{photon-counting}} camera, the PAPA (precision <b>analog</b> photon address) <b>detector</b> {{has been}} built, tested, and used successfully for {{the acquisition of}} speckle imaging data. The camera has 512 x 512 pixels and operates at count rates of at least 200, 000 /sec. In this paper, technical details on the camera are presented {{and some of the}} laboratory and astronomical results are included which demonstrate the detector's capabilities...|$|R
40|$|This article {{deals with}} the {{software}} extension for metallic loops. This extension consists of using the binary signal which can be generated by the Control and Indicating Equipment (CIE) to unite <b>analog</b> and digital <b>detectors.</b> Designed improvement {{can be applied to}} all existing modes of analog CIE such as Normal Closed (NC), End of Line (EOL) or Advanced Technology Zone (ATZ). It can be also applied to all common digital bus...|$|R
