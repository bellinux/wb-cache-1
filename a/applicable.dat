5|$|There are {{a number}} of types of {{legislation}} which can be passed. The strongest is a regulation, an act or law which is directly <b>applicable</b> in its entirety. Then there are directives which bind members to certain goals which they must achieve. They do this through their own laws and hence have room to manoeuvre in deciding upon them. A decision is an instrument which is focused at a particular person/group and is directly <b>applicable.</b> Institutions may also issue recommendations and opinions which are merely non-binding declarations.|$|E

5|$|A major {{difference}} from the US Navy tables is that the repetitive group designators represent nitrogen levels in all tissues, unlike the USN table which represent only the 120-minute compartment. The Huggins repetitive group indicates {{a percentage of the}} M0 for the most saturated tissue, and this is intended to make the tables more <b>applicable</b> to multilevel diving procedures.|$|E
5|$|As {{pointed out}} by Paul Krugman, the Brander–Spencer model, due to the {{sensitivity}} of the results to its assumptions, does not establish a generally <b>applicable</b> policy prescription in favor of government subsidies.

5|$|Ideasthesia {{theory of}} art {{may be used}} for {{psychological}} studies of aesthetics. It may also help explain classificatory disputes about art as its main tenet is that experience of art can only be individual, depending on person's unique knowledge, experiences and history.

5|$|Limb of {{a living}} animal (ever min ha-chai): in , God forbade Noah and his {{descendants}} to consume a limb torn from a live animal. Hence, Jewish law considers this prohibition <b>applicable</b> even to non-Jews, and therefore, a Jew may not give or sell such meat to a non-Jew.|$|E

5|$|Parliament {{subsequently}} {{passed the}} Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1989 and the Internal Security (Amendment) Act 1989. They took effect on 27 and 30 January 1989 respectively. Section8B(1) of the amended ISA provides {{that the law}} pertaining to the judicial review of decisions made by the President or the Minister was restored to the legal position <b>applicable</b> in Singapore on 13 July 1971, the date when Lee Mau Seng was decided. In Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs (1990), the Court of Appeal held that these amendments reinstated the legal position set out in Lee Mau Seng as the <b>applicable</b> law governing judicial review in Singapore, thus prompting {{a return to the}} subjective test in reviewing the exercise of executive discretion under the ISA.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the model}} assumes {{homogeneous}} mixture, {{the theory is}} well <b>applicable</b> to study the explosive behavior of solid fuels (spontaneous ignition of bio fuels, organic materials, garbage, etc.,).

5|$|The Due Process Clause prohibits {{state and}} local {{government}} officials from depriving persons of life, liberty, or property without legislative authorization.

5|$|The United States Air Force, focused toward {{nuclear weapons}} and {{delivery}} of such munitions against static strategic targets had spent little effort in expanding its tactical capabilities {{since the end of}} the World War II. Operation Shed Light sought to rectify this by bringing together improved tactics and technology. The programs were subsequently centered on improved communication and navigation aids for all-weather and night flying, sensor equipment for seeing through clouds, foliage, and darkness, improved equipment and methods for target marking and battlefield illumination, and aircraft and tactics to utilize these developments. In the end, few of the programs would yield <b>applicable</b> results and most of the aircraft developed under its umbrella would largely fall into obscurity. The most <b>applicable</b> developments were those that could be mainstreamed such as the work done on navigation and communication and sensor equipment.|$|E
5|$|The act was {{originally}} intended to discourage the handling of stolen property but several courts have judged that the National Stolen Property Act is sufficiently broad in scope to apply to goods crossing into the United States from a foreign nation, and is therefore <b>applicable</b> {{in the case of}} stolen cultural property.|$|E
5|$|The county prefects {{and city}} and {{municipal}} mayors are elected to four-year terms by majority of votes cast within <b>applicable</b> local government units. A runoff election is held if no candidate achieves {{a majority in}} the first round of voting. Members of county, city, and municipal councils are elected to four-year terms through proportional representation; the entire local government unit forms a single constituency. The number of council members is defined by the councils themselves based on <b>applicable</b> legislation. Electoral committees are then tasked with determining whether the national minorities are represented in the council as required by the constitution. If the minorities are not represented, further members, who belong to the minorities and who have not been elected through the proportional representation system, are selected from electoral candidate lists and added to the council.|$|E
5|$|The {{few other}} areas that operate the special {{legislative}} procedures are justice & home affairs, budget and taxation and {{certain aspects of}} other policy areas: such as the fiscal aspects of environmental policy. In these areas, the Council or Parliament decide law alone. The procedure used also depends upon which type of institutional act is being used. The strongest act is a regulation, an act or law which is directly <b>applicable</b> in its entirety. Then there are directives which bind members to certain goals which they must achieve, but they do this through their own laws and hence have room to manoeuvre in deciding upon them. A decision is an instrument which is focused at a particular person or group and is directly <b>applicable.</b> Institutions may also issue recommendations and opinions which are merely non-binding declarations.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary goal}} in {{treatment}} of IIH is {{the prevention of}} visual loss and blindness, as well as symptom control.
