In response, five 6-pounder quick-firing guns and searchlights were installed to deal with the torpedo boat threat and, between 1899 and 1901, the east battery was converted to hold breech-loading guns at a cost of £16,670.|$|E

5|$|Parathyroid glands share {{a similar}} blood supply, venous {{drainage}}, and lymphatic drainage to the thyroid glands. Parathyroid glands {{are derived from}} the epithelial lining of {{the third and fourth}} branchial pouches, with the superior glands arising from the fourth pouch, and the inferior glands arising from the higher third pouch. The relative position of the inferior <b>and</b> <b>superior</b> glands, which are named according to their final location, changes because of the migration of embryological tissues.|$|E

5|$|The low status of—and {{subsequent}} discrimination against—women in India can {{be attributed}} to many cultural norms. Societal forces of patriarchy, hierarchy and multigenerational families contribute to Indian gender roles. Men use greater privileges <b>and</b> <b>superior</b> rights to create an unequal society that leaves women with little to no power. This societal structure is exemplified with women’s low participation within India’s national parliament and the labour force.|$|E

5|$|A 1948 {{review of}} the entire F-84 program {{discovered}} {{that none of the}} F-84B or F-84C aircraft could be considered operational or capable of executing any aspect of their intended mission. The program was saved from cancellation because the F-84D, whose production was well underway, had satisfactorily addressed the major faults. A fly-off against the F-80 revealed that while the Shooting Star had a shorter takeoff roll, better low altitude climb rate <b>and</b> <b>superior</b> maneuverability, the F-84 could carry a greater bomb load, was faster, had better high altitude performance and greater range. As a temporizing measure, the USAF in 1949 committed US$8million to implement over 100 upgrades to all F-84Bs, most notably reinforcing the wings. Despite the resultant improvements, the F-84B was withdrawn from active duty by 1952.|$|E

5|$|A {{struggle}} over {{the power of the}} purse brought Adams back into the political limelight. Traditionally, the Massachusetts House of Representatives paid the salaries of the governor, lieutenant governor, <b>and</b> <b>superior</b> court judges. From the Whig perspective, this arrangement was an important check on executive power, keeping royally appointed officials accountable to democratically elected representatives. In 1772, Massachusetts learned that those officials would henceforth be paid by the British government rather than by the province. To protest this development, Adams and his colleagues devised a system of committees of correspondence in November 1772; the towns of Massachusetts would consult with each other concerning political matters via messages sent through a network of committees that recorded British activities and protested imperial policies. Committees of correspondence soon formed in other colonies, as well.|$|E
5|$|According to some authors, {{who use the}} {{original}} description by Treitz, the muscle may {{be divided into two}} sections: a ligamentous portion attaching the right crus of diaphragm to the connective tissue surrounding the coeliac artery <b>and</b> <b>superior</b> mesenteric artery; and a lower muscular portion from the connective tissue attaching to the duodenum. The superior portion is also described as the Hilfsmuskel. These two parts are now considered anatomically distinct, with the suspensory muscle referring solely to the lower structure attaching at the duodenum.|$|E
5|$|Antibiotics are {{not usually}} used for gastroenteritis, {{although}} they are sometimes recommended if symptoms are particularly severe or if a susceptible bacterial cause is isolated or suspected. If antibiotics are to be employed, a macrolide (such as azithromycin) is preferred over a fluoroquinolone due to higher rates {{of resistance to the}} latter. Pseudomembranous colitis, usually caused by antibiotic use, is managed by discontinuing the causative agent and treating it with either metronidazole or vancomycin. Bacteria and protozoans that are amenable to treatment include Shigella Salmonella typhi, and Giardia species. In those with Giardia species or Entamoeba histolytica, tinidazole treatment is recommended <b>and</b> <b>superior</b> to metronidazole. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of antibiotics in young children who have both bloody diarrhea and fever.|$|E

40|$|This study {{compared}} multiple {{ratings of}} the organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) of managers obtained from three different sources: self, <b>superiors,</b> <b>and</b> subordinates. The results examining convergence across sources demonstrated that there were stronger correlations between ratings made by others (subordinates <b>and</b> <b>superiors)</b> than between ratings made by self and others. The results also indicated that there were mean level differences in ratings across sources. Specifically, ratings made by self <b>and</b> <b>superiors</b> were higher than were ratings made by subordinates. The results examining convergence within sources suggested that the reliability of OCB ratings based on a single rater were quite low; however, reliability increased considerably when aggregating raters. Future research and implications are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Because the {{territorial}} boundary {{line between the}} U.S. and British North America (specifically, the province of Quebec until 1791 and Upper Canada thereafter) ran {{through the middle of}} Lake Erie and then up the Detroit River, combined with the prevailing belief regarding the location of the southern tip of Lake Michigan, the framers of the 1802 Ohio Constitution believed it was the intent of Congress that Ohio's northern boundary should certainly be north of the mouth of the Maumee River, and possibly even of the Detroit River. Ohio would thus be granted access to most or all of the Lake Erie shoreline west of Pennsylvania, and any other new states carved out of the Northwest Territory would have access to the Great Lakes via Lakes Michigan, Huron, <b>and</b> <b>Superior.</b>|$|E
5|$|In his discourses {{recorded}} in the Vachanamrut, Swaminarayan mentions that humans {{would not be able}} to withstand meeting god in his divine form, hence God takes human form (simultaneously living in his abode) so people can approach, understand and love him in the form of an Avatar. While no detailed statistical information is available, most of the followers of Swaminarayan share a belief that Swaminarayan is the complete manifestation of Narayana or Purushottam Narayana - the Supreme Being <b>and</b> <b>superior</b> to other avatars. A Swaminarayan sectarian legend tells how Narayana from the Nara Narayana pair, was cursed by sage Durvasa to incarnate on the earth as Swaminarayan.|$|E

5|$|John Service, {{while under}} Stilwell's command, {{served as a}} {{diplomatic}} observer for both Stilwell and the American Embassy in Chungking. Over the next three months, he sent {{a series of reports}} to Chungking, and sparked controversy immediately. Service praised the CPC and compared them to European socialists, rather than the feared U.S.S.R. Service credited the CPC for a clean <b>and</b> <b>superior</b> society {{in stark contrast to the}} corruption and chaos he saw in the Nationalist areas controlled by Chiang Kai-shek. He was found bias. After visiting Yan'an, Service advocated that the United States should work with the forces opposed to the Nationalists, such as the Communists, though he did not advocate abandoning Chiang. This opinion was shared by John Paton Davies, and this position ruined both careers.|$|E
