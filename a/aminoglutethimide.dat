25|$|Medications {{that block}} the {{production}} of adrenal androgens such as DHEA include ketoconazole and <b>aminoglutethimide.</b> Because the adrenal glands make only about 5% of the body's androgens, these medications are, in general, used only {{in combination with other}} methods that can block the 95% of androgens made by the testicles. These combined methods are called total androgen blockade (TAB). TAB can also be achieved using antiandrogens.|$|E
25|$|Each {{treatment}} has disadvantages that limit {{its use in}} certain circumstances. Although orchiectomy is a low-risk surgery, the psychological impact of removing the testicles can be significant, and sterility is certain. The loss of testosterone can cause hot flashes, weight gain, loss of libido, enlargement of the breasts (gynecomastia), impotence, penile atrophy, and osteoporosis. GnRH agonists eventually cause the same side effects as orchiectomy but may cause worse symptoms {{at the beginning of}} treatment. When GnRH agonists are first used, testosterone surges can lead to increased bone pain from metastatic cancer, so antiandrogens or abarelix is often added to blunt these side effects. Estrogens are not commonly used because they increase the risk for cardiovascular disease and blood clots. In general, the antiandrogens do not cause impotence, and usually cause less loss of bone and muscle mass. Ketoconazole can cause liver damage with prolonged use, and <b>aminoglutethimide</b> can cause skin rashes.|$|E
500|$|There is also {{research}} in progress on more genes and biomarkers {{that may be}} linked to endometrial cancer. The protective effect of combined oral contraceptives and the IUD is being investigated. Preliminary research has shown that the levonorgestrel IUD placed for a year, combined with 6monthly injections of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, can stop or reverse the progress of endometrial cancer in young women. An experimental drug that combines a hormone with doxorubicin is also under investigation for greater efficacy in cancers with hormone receptors. [...] Hormone therapy that is effective in treating breast cancer, including use of aromatase inhibitors, is also being investigated for use in endometrial cancer. One such drug is anastrozole, which is currently being researched in hormone-positive recurrences after chemotherapy. Research into hormonal treatments for endometrial stromal sarcomas is ongoing as well. It includes trials of drugs like mifepristone, a progestin antagonist, and <b>aminoglutethimide</b> and letrozole, two aromatase inhibitors.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Aminoglutethimide,</b> also {{inhibits}} {{the enzyme}} P450scc and so decreases synthesis of all steroid hormones.|$|E
50|$|Rogletimide, {{also known}} as pyridoglutethimide, is a drug related in {{chemical}} structure to the sedative glutethimide, but instead having pharmacological activity as a selective aromatase inhibitor similar to the related drug <b>aminoglutethimide,</b> but with no significant sedative effect. This makes it potentially useful {{in the treatment of}} some forms of cancer, and with less side effects than <b>aminoglutethimide,</b> but its lower potency caused it to be unsuccessful in clinical trials.|$|E
50|$|<b>Aminoglutethimide</b> is {{indicated}} {{in conjunction with}} other drugs for the suppression of adrenal function in patients with Cushing's syndrome.|$|E
5000|$|In the past, {{surgical}} adrenalectomy {{and early}} androgen biosynthesis inhibitors like ketoconazole and <b>aminoglutethimide</b> were successfully {{employed in the}} treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer. However, adrenalectomy is an invasive procedure with high morbidity, ketoconazole and <b>aminoglutethimide</b> have relatively high toxicity, and both treatment modalities require supplementation with corticosteroids, making them in many ways unideal. The development of [...] with [...] like bicalutamide and enzalutamide and with newer and more tolerable androgen biosynthesis inhibitors like abiraterone acetate has since allowed for non-invasive, convenient, and well-tolerated therapies that have replaced the earlier modalities.|$|E
5000|$|Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) such as <b>aminoglutethimide,</b> anastrozole, exemestane, letrozole, and {{testolactone}} {{inhibit the}} production of estrogens from androgens and are used mainly {{in the treatment of}} estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.|$|E
50|$|Its {{side effects}} are skin rash, hepatotoxicity, {{inhibition}} of cortisol {{in the human}} body, and it may also cause hypothyroidism. Since cortisol helps break down muscle, <b>aminoglutethimide</b> is used by bodybuilders in a steroid cycle.|$|E
50|$|An anti{{glucocorticoid}} {{is a drug}} {{which reduces}} glucocorticoid activity in the body. They include direct glucocorticoid receptor antagonists such as mifepristone and synthesis inhibitors such as metyrapone, ketoconazole, and <b>aminoglutethimide.</b> They are used to treat Cushing's syndrome.|$|E
50|$|<b>Aminoglutethimide</b> is {{abused by}} bodybuilders and other steroid users to lower {{circulating}} levels of cortisol {{in the body}} and prevent muscle loss. Cortisol is catabolic to protein in muscle and effective blockade of P450scc by aminogluthethimide at high doses prevents muscle loss.|$|E
50|$|Inhibitors of {{cholesterol}} side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc), such as <b>aminoglutethimide</b> and ketoconazole, may block production of all neurosteroids, both excitatory and inhibitory, while CYP17A1 (17α-hydroxylase/17,20 lyase) inhibitors, such as abiraterone acetate, may block production of excitatory neurosteroids. Antigonadotropins may also lower neurosteroid levels.|$|E
50|$|<b>Aminoglutethimide</b> is an anti-steroid drug marketed {{under the}} tradename Cytadren by Novartis around the world. It blocks the {{production}} of steroids derived from cholesterol and is clinically used {{in the treatment of}} Cushing's syndrome and metastatic breast cancer. It is also used by bodybuilders.|$|E
50|$|<b>Aminoglutethimide</b> {{has more}} {{recently}} found {{use as a}} recreational CYP2D6 inducer, resulting in an increased conversion of codeine to morphine when the former is taken concomitantly with <b>aminoglutethimide.</b> This increases the effect of codeine per dose and increases the ceiling effect threshold, allowing smaller doses of codeine {{to achieve the same}} effect as a larger dose taken alone as well as increasing the metabolic limit on the effect of codeine (normally codeine doses above 400 mg stop producing any significant increase in opioid effects due to depletion of the CYP2D6 enzyme which essentially halts the conversion process until the enzyme has replenished). A similar effect is seen with tramadol due to an increased conversion to O-desmethyltramadol and an increased availability of the CYP2D6 enzyme.|$|E
50|$|The {{androgen}} synthesis inhibitors <b>aminoglutethimide</b> and ketoconazole {{were first}} marketed in 1960 and 1977, respectively, and the newer drug abiraterone acetate {{was introduced in}} 2011. GnRH analogues were first introduced in the 1980s. The 5α-reductase inhibitors finasteride and dutasteride were introduced in 1992 and 2002, respectively.|$|E
50|$|<b>Aminoglutethimide</b> {{inhibits}} both aromatase {{and other}} enzymes critical for steroid hormone synthesis in the adrenal glands. It was formerly used {{for breast cancer}} treatment, but has since been replaced by more selective aromatase inhibitors. It {{can also be used}} for the treatment of hyperadrenocortical syndromes, such as Cushing's syndrome and hyperaldosteronism in adrenocortical carcinoma.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} antiandrogens have been {{associated}} with hepatotoxicity. These include, to varying extents, cyproterone acetate, flutamide, nilutamide, bicalutamide, <b>aminoglutethimide,</b> and ketoconazole. In contrast, spironolactone, enzalutamide, and other antiandrogens are not associated with hepatotoxicity. However, although they do not pose a risk of hepatotoxicity, spironolactone has a risk of hyperkalemia and enzalutamide has a risk of seizures.|$|E
5000|$|Cholesterol {{side-chain}} cleavage enzyme (P450scc, CYP11A1) inhibitors such as <b>aminoglutethimide,</b> ketoconazole, and mitotane {{inhibit the}} production of pregnenolone from cholesterol and thereby prevent the synthesis of all steroid hormones. They {{have been used to}} inhibit corticosteroid synthesis in the treatment of Cushing's syndrome and adrenocortical carcinoma, and ketoconazole has also been used to inhibit androgen production in the treatment of prostate cancer.|$|E
50|$|Androgen {{synthesis}} inhibitors are {{enzyme inhibitors}} which prevent the biosynthesis of androgens. This process occurs {{mainly in the}} gonads and adrenal glands. These drugs include <b>aminoglutethimide,</b> ketoconazole, and abiraterone acetate. <b>Aminoglutethimide</b> inhibits cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, also known as P450scc or CYP11A1, {{which is responsible for}} the conversion of cholesterol into pregnenolone and by extension the production of all steroid hormones, including the androgens. Ketoconazole and abiraterone acetate are inhibitors of the enzyme CYP17A1, also known as 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase, which is responsible for the conversion of pregnane steroids into androgens, as well as the conversion of mineralocorticoids into glucocorticoids. Because these drugs all prevent the formation of glucocorticoids in addition to androgens, they must be combined with a glucocorticoid like prednisone to avoid adrenal insufficiency. A newer drug which is currently under development for the treatment of prostate cancer, seviteronel, is selective for inhibition of the 17,20-lyase functionality of CYP17A1, and for this reason, unlike earlier drugs, does not require concomitant treatment with a glucocorticoid.|$|E
50|$|Medications {{that block}} the {{production}} of adrenal androgens such as DHEA include ketoconazole and <b>aminoglutethimide.</b> Because the adrenal glands make only about 5% of the body's androgens, these medications are, in general, used only {{in combination with other}} methods that can block the 95% of androgens made by the testicles. These combined methods are called total androgen blockade (TAB). TAB can also be achieved using antiandrogens.|$|E
50|$|MPA {{increases}} the risk of breast cancer, dementia and thrombus when used in combination with conjugated equine estrogens to treat the symptoms of menopause. When used as a contraceptive, MPA does not generally interact with other drugs. When combined with <b>aminoglutethimide</b> to treat metastases from breast cancer, MPA is associated with an increase in depression. St John's wort may decrease its effectiveness as a contraceptive.|$|E
5000|$|Androgen {{synthesis}} inhibitors: {{drugs that}} directly inhibit the enzymatic biosynthesis of androgens like testosterone and/or DHT. Examples include the CYP17A1 inhibitors ketoconazole, abiraterone acetate, and seviteronel, the CYP11A1 (P450scc) inhibitor <b>aminoglutethimide,</b> and the 5α-reductase inhibitors finasteride, dutasteride, epristeride, alfatradiol, and saw palmetto extract (Serenoa repens). A {{number of other}} antiandrogens, including cyproterone acetate, spironolactone, medrogestone, flutamide, nilutamide, and bifluranol, are also known to weakly inhibit androgen synthesis.|$|E
50|$|In 1944 the Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology (WFEB) was established. The {{foundation}} was {{the center}} point of collaboration of many scientists interested in reproduction, neurophysiology and steroid biochemistry. One of the foundations work was {{the understanding of the}} mechanism of conversion of androgens to estrogens. The group worked on understanding the biosynthesis and metabolism of steroids that are produced by adrenal glands, testes and ovaries. Andre Meyer later hypothesized that the aromatization of androstenedione was enzymatic and this was proven in the 1980s with the purification of aromatase. In the early 1970s the investigators agreed upon the fact that aromatization of ring A was facilitated by a cytochrome P450-mediated enzyme, proven with the blockade of <b>aminoglutethimide</b> (AG, known to block P450-mediated enzymes.|$|E
50|$|Metandienone binds to and {{activates}} the {{androgen receptor}} (AR) {{in order to}} exert its effects. These include dramatic increases in protein synthesis, glycogenolysis, and muscle strength over a short space of time. Side effects such as gynecomastia, high blood pressure, acne and male pattern baldness may begin to occur. The drug causes severe masculinizing effects in women even at low doses. In addition, it is metabolized into methylestradiol by aromatase. This means that without the administration of aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole or <b>aminoglutethimide,</b> estrogenic effects like gynecomastia (breast development) may appear over time in men. Many users combat the estrogenic side effects with anastrozole, tamoxifen or clomifene. In addition, as with other 17α-alkylated steroids, the use of metandienone over {{extended periods of time}} can result in liver damage without appropriate precautions.|$|E
50|$|High-dose {{estrogen}} was {{the first}} functional antiandrogen {{to be used in}} the treatment of prostate cancer and was widely employed, but has largely been abandoned for this indication in favor of newer agents with improved safety profiles and fewer feminizing side effects. Cyproterone acetate was developed subsequently to high-dose estrogen and is the only steroidal antiandrogen that has been widely used in the treatment of prostate cancer, but it has largely been replaced by nonsteroidal antiandrogens, which are newer and have greater effectiveness, tolerability, and safety. Bicalutamide, as well as enzalutamide, have largely replaced the earlier nonsteroidal antiandrogens flutamide and nilutamide, which are now little used. The earlier androgen synthesis inhibitors <b>aminoglutethimide</b> and ketoconazole have only limitedly been used in the treatment of prostate cancer due to toxicity concerns and have been replaced by abiraterone acetate.|$|E
50|$|Each {{treatment}} has disadvantages that limit {{its use in}} certain circumstances. Although orchiectomy is a low-risk surgery, the psychological impact of removing the testicles can be significant, and sterility is certain. The loss of testosterone can cause hot flashes, weight gain, loss of libido, enlargement of the breasts (gynecomastia), impotence, penile atrophy, and osteoporosis. GnRH agonists eventually cause the same side effects as orchiectomy but may cause worse symptoms {{at the beginning of}} treatment. When GnRH agonists are first used, testosterone surges can lead to increased bone pain from metastatic cancer, so antiandrogens or abarelix is often added to blunt these side effects. Estrogens are not commonly used because they increase the risk for cardiovascular disease and blood clots. In general, the antiandrogens do not cause impotence, and usually cause less loss of bone and muscle mass. Ketoconazole can cause liver damage with prolonged use, and <b>aminoglutethimide</b> can cause skin rashes.|$|E
50|$|There is also {{research}} in progress on more genes and biomarkers {{that may be}} linked to endometrial cancer. The protective effect of combined oral contraceptives and the IUD is being investigated. Preliminary research has shown that the levonorgestrel IUD placed for a year, combined with 6 monthly injections of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, can stop or reverse the progress of endometrial cancer in young women. An experimental drug that combines a hormone with doxorubicin is also under investigation for greater efficacy in cancers with hormone receptors. Hormone therapy that is effective in treating breast cancer, including use of aromatase inhibitors, is also being investigated for use in endometrial cancer. One such drug is anastrozole, which is currently being researched in hormone-positive recurrences after chemotherapy. Research into hormonal treatments for endometrial stromal sarcomas is ongoing as well. It includes trials of drugs like mifepristone, a progestin antagonist, and <b>aminoglutethimide</b> and letrozole, two aromatase inhibitors.|$|E
50|$|Subsequently, analogues of amphenone B {{with reduced}} {{toxicity}} and improved specificity were developed. One {{of the most}} potent of these was metyrapone (2-methyl-1,2-di(pyridin-3-yl)propan-1-one), a selective inhibitor of 11β-hydroxylase, which was selected for clinical development and was eventually approved and marketed in 1958 as a diagnostic agent for Cushings syndrome. Another was mitotane (o,p-DDD, or 1,1-(dichlorodiphenyl)-2,2-dichloroethane), an inhibitor of cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme {{and to a lesser}} extent of other steroidogenic enzymes, which additionally has selective and direct cytotoxic effects on the adrenal glands similarly to p,p-DDD, and was introduced in 1960 for the treatment of adrenocortical carcinoma. <b>Aminoglutethimide</b> (3-(4-aminophenyl)-3-ethylpiperidine-2,6-dione), which was originally introduced as an anticonvulsant in 1960, is closely related structurally to amphenone B, and following its introduction, was found to cause adrenal insufficiency in patients due to inhibition of cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme and suppression of corticosteroid production. The drug was subsequently repurposed for use in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer and Cushings syndrome.|$|E
40|$|<b>Aminoglutethimide</b> is a {{clinically}} available {{drug that}} suppresses steroid biosynthesis by inhibiting enzymes such as cytochrome P 450 scc and aromatase. Because {{several members of}} neurosteroids regulate glutamate receptors, we investigated the effect of <b>aminoglutethimide</b> on cell death induced by overactivation of glutamate receptors in CNS neurons. Long-term pretreatment of organotypic cerebrocortical slice cultures with <b>aminoglutethimide</b> (100 – 1000 [*]μM) for 6 days or over resulted in concentration-dependent suppression of neuronal cell death induced by NMDA. <b>Aminoglutethimide</b> (1000 [*]μM) also inhibited neurotoxicity of AMPA and kainate, but not of ionomycin or staurosporine. The protective effect of <b>aminoglutethimide</b> against NMDA cytotoxicity was not mimicked by other steroid synthesis inhibitors including trilostane and exemestane, and was not reversed by concurrent application of steroids such as pregnenolone, estrone, 17 β-estradiol and estriol. In dissociated rat cerebrocortical cell cultures, long-term treatment with <b>aminoglutethimide</b> (10 – 1000 [*]μM) attenuated NMDA receptor-mediated glutamate cytotoxicity but produced no significant effect on glutamate-induced increases in intracellular Ca 2 +. Brief as well as long-term pretreatment with <b>aminoglutethimide</b> (30 – 1000 [*]μM) prevented NMDA receptor-dependent ischemic neuronal injury in organotypic cerebrocortical slice cultures, which was associated with suppression of glutamate release during the ischemic insult. These results indicate that <b>aminoglutethimide,</b> irrelevant to its actions on neurosteroid synthesis, protects CNS neurons from excitotoxic and ischemic injuries. Development of <b>aminoglutethimide</b> analogs possessing neuroprotective properties may be of therapeutic value...|$|E
40|$|The present 12 -month {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} {{the effects of the}} aromatase inhibitor <b>aminoglutethimide,</b> alone and in combination with orchiectomy, on pancreatic carcinogenesis in azaserine-treated rats and N-nitrosobis(2 -oxopropyl) amine-treated hamsters. Treatment of the animals started 4 months after the last injection with the carcinogen. They were surgically castrated and/or treated with <b>aminoglutethimide.</b> Aminoglutethimide-treated rats developed less pancreatic tumours than did untreated controls. Multiplicity of (pre-) -neoplastic acinar lesions was lower in orchiectomized rats than in intact rats. Inhibition of pancreatic carcinogenesis was most pronounced in rats that were both orchiectomized and treated with <b>aminoglutethimide.</b> These effects were statistically significant after 8 months, but not after 4 months, of treatment. In hamsters, <b>aminoglutethimide</b> showed an enhancing rather than an inhibitory effect on the formation of ductular pancreatic tumours. Castration appeared to have no effect on the development of N-nitrosobis(2 -oxopropyl) amine-induced ductular lesions in the pancreas, either alone, or in combination with <b>aminoglutethimide.</b> The present findings indicate that <b>aminoglutethimide,</b> alone and in combination with surgical castration, might be of value for the treatment of pancreatic acinar tumours, whereas the usefulness of <b>aminoglutethimide</b> for treatment of ductular adenocarcinomas of the pancreas is somewhat doubtful...|$|E
40|$|Altogether 117 {{patients}} with advanced breast cancer {{were treated with}} either tamoxifen 10 mg by mouth twice daily or <b>aminoglutethimide</b> 250 mg by mouth four times daily with hydrocortisone 20 mg twice daily in a randomised cross-over trial in which patients who {{failed to respond to}} the first treatment or relapsed while receiving it were switched to the other. Eighteen (30 %) out of 60 patients initially treated with tamoxifen achieved an objective response and 11 (18 %) showed stable disease. Seventeen (30 %) out of 57 patients treated initially with <b>aminoglutethimide</b> achieved an objective response and 13 (23 %) achieved stable disease. Objective responses in bone metastases were achieved more commonly with <b>aminoglutethimide</b> (11 patients (35 %)) than with tamoxifen (five (17 %)). The predicted median duration of response for tamoxifen was 15 months and for <b>aminoglutethimide</b> over 15 months (no significant difference). Five (15 %) out of 34 patients who failed to respond to tamoxifen and four out of six patients who relapsed after responding to tamoxifen subsequently responded to <b>aminoglutethimide.</b> In contrast, only two (6 %) out of 31 patients who failed to respond to <b>aminoglutethimide</b> and none out of four patients who relapsed while receiving <b>aminoglutethimide</b> subsequently responded to tamoxifen. The main side effects occurring in the 97 patients who received <b>aminoglutethimide</b> as first- or second-line treatment were lethargy and drowsiness (36 patients) and rash (29); seven patients had to stop treatment because of side effects. In contrast, side effects were rare and mild with tamoxifen and no patient had to stop treatment because of them. Both tamoxifen and <b>aminoglutethimide</b> appeared from this study to be equally effective in the medical endocrine treatment of advanced breast cancer...|$|E
40|$|A {{model of}} human leucopenia has been {{developed}} further in the female mouse. Following daily administration to female mice of 50 mg/kg of the aromatase inhibitor <b>aminoglutethimide,</b> significant falls in platelet and white cell counts occurred after 2 and 3 weeks. At week 4, drug dosage was stopped and the cell counts recovered {{at the end of}} that week, although on rechallenge at the beginning of week 5, both platelet and white cell counts fell rapidly. Administration to the mice of structural analogues of <b>aminoglutethimide,</b> such as WSP- 3, glutethimide and 4 -nitroglutethimide, showed no reductions in platelet and white cell counts. The haemotoxicity of <b>aminoglutethimide</b> over 21 days was unaffected by the presence of either the P- 450 inhibitor SKF- 525 A or the hepatic P- 450 inducer phenobarbitone. However, the co-administration of cimetidine abolished the haemotoxicity of <b>aminoglutethimide</b> in terms of platelet and white cell levels. In in vitro studies, both <b>aminoglutethimide</b> and WSP- 3 were oxidised to cytotoxic species, although <b>aminoglutethimide</b> was significantly more cytotoxic than WSP- 3. The NADPH-dependent covalent binding of 14 C <b>aminoglutethimide</b> to mouse microsomes in vitro was significantly reduced by the presence of cimetidine. The activation of the compound to reactive species in vitro, the inhibitory effects of cimetidine in vivo and in vitro, as well as the rapid fall in the in vivo white cell count on rechallenge with <b>aminoglutethimide</b> suggest that this model illustrates a form of leucopenia which may be related to hapten formation and subsequent immune-mediated platelet and white cell lysis. © 2003 Elsevier B.
