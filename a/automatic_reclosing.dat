50|$|Other {{standard}} {{features include}} <b>automatic</b> <b>reclosing</b> circuit breakers (reclosers). Most faults (overcurrent) are transient. Since {{the network is}} rural, most of these faults will be cleared by the recloser. Each service site needs a rewirable drop out fuse for protection and switching of the transformer. The transformer secondary should also be protected by a standard high-rupture capacity (HRC) fuse or low voltage circuit breaker. A surge arrestor (spark gap) on the high voltage side is common, especially in lightning-prone areas.|$|E
5000|$|Reactor {{power winding}} current is {{regulated}} according to proportional control mode, when control angle of rectified current source thyristors is changed according to proportional mode depending on mismatching between the prescribed voltage setting and the voltage {{at the point}} of reactor connection. In case of necessity to implement the rapid transfer of the reactor from one quasi-steady-state mode to another one, the scheme of overexcitation/underexcitation is realized. In such case, time to gain full power starting from no-load condition is reduced up to 0,3 s. Constructively, it is possible to ensure every speed of the reactor power variation. However, based on practical experience of MCSR application, the optimal balance between the reactor operating speed and capacity of biasing system has been determined: speed of power increase/relief within 0,3 - 1,0 s, capacity of biasing system - 1 - 2% of the reactor rated capacity. [...] Depending upon desired requirements, MCSR is adjusted {{in such a way that}} would be possible to realize either voltage level stabilization, or consumed reactive power value, or consumed current magnitude. Controlled reactors, same as their non-controlled analogues, are subdivided into bus reactors and line reactors. Based on this principle, MCSR design would be completed with additional element which ensures pre-biasing of electromagnetic part and subsequent inertialess energizing of the reactor (with power increase time less than one cycle of power frequency). Similar to all transformer equipment, MCSR is able to withstand long-term overload up to 120 - 130% as well as should-term overload up to 200%. Moreover, considering the additional measures and the control algorithms, MCSR realizes all functions of uncontrolled shunt reactor including ability to operate within the interval of single-phase <b>automatic</b> <b>reclosing.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Automatic</b> line <b>reclosing</b> schemes {{used in an}} extra-high-voltage {{power system}} is an {{economical}} and effective means to maintain transient stability. A novel method is proposed in the paper to adaptively optimize the <b>automatic</b> line <b>reclosing</b> time after a transient fault for enhancement of interconnected power system transient stability. Both the study on the transient energy over network and the structure-preserving multi-machines power system model illustrate that the excessive convergence of potential energy on the lines with a certain cutset deteriorate power system stability, and therefore, an optimum line reclosing strategy can be established by minimizing the change in transient potential energy distribution across a cutset lines {{in the vicinity of}} the faulty line as an optimization target, and the optimal reclosure time is set to the time of minimum line phase angle difference. Without any pre-determined knowledge, the method is adaptive to various power system operation modes and fault conditions, and easy to implement because only a limited number of data measured at one location on a tie-line linking sub-networks are required. Simulations have been performed with the OMIB(One Machine and Infinite Bus System) and a real inter-connected power system to verify the applicability of the method proposed.

40|$|Conventional {{recloser}} {{stresses the}} circuit with current fault {{every time they}} reclose into a fault. After clearing a fault, a conventional recloser simply recloses the interrupters to continuously test {{the presence of the}} fault. If the fault is still there, the interrupters are tripped again. Then, after a time delay, the interrupters are reclosed. During <b>reclosing</b> operation of <b>Automatic</b> <b>Recloser,</b> including the faster recloser one, powerful transient processes occurs and significant amount of energy is feeding the fault, resulting in system-damaging and voltage sags. Replacing conventional recloser with PulseCloser one minimizes these effects and creates the possibility to use multiple reclosing even when traditional autoreclosing can not be allowed. PulseCloser Technology drastically reduces overcurrent stress on the system. Once the PulseCloser interrupts a fault, it sends the impulses to intelligently tests for current fault before reclosing. The relative let-through energy of a pulseclosing operation is typically less than 2 % of a conventional reclosing operation. Pulseclosing is superior to conventional reclosing. It greatly reduces stress on system components as well as voltage sags experienced by customers’ upstream fault. This paper analyzes transient processes during simulation of operation of traditional recloser and PulseCloser type. Simulations are performed using ATP software. The simulations show the remarkable difference in current versus time during fault testing in the transmission line equipped with conventional recloser and PulseCloser. The analysis justifies the replacement of Conventional Recloser with PulseCloser one...|$|R
40|$|The <b>automatic</b> circuit <b>recloser</b> (ACR) is {{responsible}} for protecting electrical distribution grids {{in the event that}} high voltage power lines come in contact with ground. In order to prevent damage, ACRs break the electrical continuity of the circuit {{through the use of a}} vacuum interrupter and a weld breaking mechanism. Vacuum interrupters consist of two metallic contacts in an air-tight ceramic housing. Due to the electrical interactions that take place during the interruption process, unintended welds are formed between the contacts. These welds have the ability to impede or completely stop the interruption process, thus rendering the ACR inoperable. In order to ensure that the ACR can interrupt current even when welds have formed, a mechanism is used to complement the opening force and impart an impact load on the weld. This mechanism is generally designed based on rules of thumb and engineering judgment. This thesis develops a dynamic model of an ACR, which acts as a blueprint for the further development and optimization of the weld-breaking motion. The dynamic model consists of four main submodels: the dynamic motion of the masses, the dielectric breakdown model, the contact bounce model, and the weld-strength model. The dynamic motion and the weld-strength model are developed based on first principles, while the dielectric breakdown model and the contact bounce model are determined based on experimental data. The overarching dynamic model is compared to performance data and shows good agreement...|$|R

Large scale implementation of distributed generation (DG) means that this fundamental assumption is not true any more. This causes several challenges to network design and operation. One {{of the most critical}} affected areas is system protection. The impact of DG on protection has been examined in several research papers during the last years. The most challenging issue seems to be anti-islanding protection, especially when <b>automatic</b> <b>reclosing</b> is applied. In this paper, the effect of DG on <b>automatic</b> <b>reclosing</b> is studied. After a short literature review, the method and results of simulation studies are presented. The simulations verify the existence of the problems. Protection requirements and possible solutions are discussed. Because of speed and reliability requirements, telecommunication based protection seems to be the most suitable solution, when the share of DG becomes significant.

Consequently, improper reclosing of the line onto a fault is avoided. The fault identification prior to reclosing is based on optimized artificial neural network associated with three different training algorithms.

A comparison of overall performance of the three algorithms, developed and coded in MATLABTM software environment, is also presented.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the dissertation is to develop simplified analytical models for typical linear-motion and rotary-motion energy-conversion systems under active DC excitation without tedious numerical-simulation effort, and provide practical implementation of the models in optimal-design and thermal-protection aspects. The model of a vacuum <b>automatic</b> circuit <b>recloser</b> (a typical linear-motion system under DC excitation) is first developed {{in the form of}} a non-linear discontinuous eighth-order dynamic system. The model is then used to simulate the transient mechanical and electromagnetic performance during the opening and closing movements of the recloser. Such a model is not found in the literature. Although the model is based on certain simplifying assumptions, the result is validated by high-speed-camera measurements. In addition, the impact of key design variables is explored, based on which an improved recloser design is proposed, and helps to optimize capital and production costs without degrading performance. Further analytical investigation is carried out in modeling an inverter-fed induction motor (IM) (a typical rotary-motion system) with active DC injection. The IM is closed-loop controlled via two popular motor-control algorithms, namely, the direct-torque-control (DTC) algorithm and field-oriented-control (FOC) algorithm. Quantitative relationships between the changes of various machine variables during the active DC excitation are provided in the theoretical analysis. The developed DC-injection model is further simplified for practical implementation. The developed IM model under DC injection results in practical ways to excite a proper amount of DC current directly or indirectly into IM stator windings via different closed-loop motor-control algorithms. In a DTC motor-drive system, the modeling work makes it possible to excite the DC current indirectly inside the motor by superimposing a stator-flux-linkage-bias command in the flux-control loop or a torque-ripple command in the torque-control loop. The proposed flux-linkage-injection and torque-injection methods are the first novel efforts to implement the DC-signal-injection method in a DTC motor-drive system. In addition, the analysis carried out in a standard FOC drive system brings about an improved DC-current-injection approach: the torque ripple in this method is significantly mitigated compared to all existing DC-injection methods in FOC systems. The proposed DC-injection methods, either in a DTC or an FOC system, lead to a simple, low-cost, accurate, and non-invasive thermal-monitoring scheme for closed-loop-controlled IMs, where the stator temperature is indirectly estimated from stator resistance. Furthermore, considering inverter non-idealities, there is a challenge for a typical inverter drive to accurately estimate the DC component of motor terminal voltages. The existing methods are extended to provide a complete study of the real-time signal-processing technique for both DTC and FOC algorithms, and are finally implemented in a custom-built programmable motor-drive system. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed technique gives accurate and robust stator-temperature estimation, regardless of the operating conditions and cooling modes. The analytical modeling method for the linear-motion and rotary-motion energy-conversion systems can be further extended to other power devices with similar mechanisms, and implemented in optimal design, control, and thermal-protection areas.

40|$|In {{the last}} twenty years the Distributed Generation (DG) {{increased}} till a high level that introduced several issues to the classical management system of distribution networks. In many countries different technical rules have been introduced in order to integrate the DG units in the medium voltage (MV) and low voltage (LV) distribution network. New standards state requirements for all generators, included inverter based ones, imposing a Fault Ride Through (FRT) philosophy and new active and reactive power regulation actions with the aim of maintaining the transmission system stability at the level it was with traditional rotating generators, or even increasing it. These technical rules may not be fully compliant with the <b>automatic</b> <b>reclosing</b> cycle usually performed from the CB at the beginning of MV feeders and/or with the automatic selection procedure of faulty section selection and supply restore to healthy ones.

This issue {{is especially important}} for cases of three phase short circuit and unsuccessful reclosure of lines {{in the vicinity of the}} thermal plant.

Unsuccessful three phase reclosing for selected lines in the area closed to the plant indicated most critical cases.
