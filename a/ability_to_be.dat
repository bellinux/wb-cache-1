5|$|A key {{question}} surrounding the FairTax {{is whether the}} tax has the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> revenue-neutral; that is, whether the tax would result in an increase or reduction in overall federal tax revenues. Economists, advisory groups, and political advocacy groups disagree about the tax rate required for the FairTax to be truly revenue-neutral. Various analysts use different assumptions, time-frames, and methods resulting in dramatically different tax rates making direct comparison among the studies difficult. The choice between static or dynamic scoring further complicates any estimate of revenue-neutral rates.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{always being}} found in {{combination}} with the other rare-earth elements in minerals such as monazite and bastn√§site, cerium is easy to extract from its ores, as it can be distinguished among the lanthanides by its unique <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> oxidized to the +4 state. It is the most common of the lanthanides, followed by neodymium, lanthanum, and praseodymium. It is the 26th most abundant element, making up 66ppm of the Earth's crust, half as much as chlorine and five times as much as lead.|$|E
5|$|Francium's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> synthesized, trapped, and cooled, {{along with}} its {{relatively}} simple atomic structure, has made it the subject of specialized spectroscopy experiments. These experiments have led to more specific information regarding energy levels and the coupling constants between subatomic particles. Studies on the light emitted by laser-trapped francium-210 ions have provided accurate data on transitions between atomic energy levels which are fairly similar to those predicted by quantum theory.|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} {{managerial}} overconfidence {{can be a}} rational response to the economic and institutional environment, rather than a personal trait. A manager, whose contract may not be renewed upon poor performance relative to his peers, chooses risky projects in the firm. This may result {{in more than half}} of the managers rationally estimating their <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> better than average. Although there can be underconfident managers in equilibrium, it is never the case that {{more than half of the}}m estimate their <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> below average in any equilibrium...|$|R

5|$|The song's lyrics {{describe}} of {{the individual}} power that lies inside every person, their <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> their own hero. According to author Carol K. Ingall, the song inspires anyone to be a hero. Ingall continued how due to a hero's power to transform and inspire those around them, so too every person has inside of them the light and force needed to help change the world. Similarly, author Darlene Wade connects the song's lyrical content to the power within the soul, however also with the inclusion of God.|$|E

5|$|After leaving Apogee, Jackson {{entered into}} {{a joint venture with}} Clair Brothers to design a digital {{loudspeaker}} controller for control of complex concert sound systems. Jackson estimated that the project would cost $800,000 in U.S. dollars, but it ended up costing Clair Brothers more than $2M. From the same garage in which he started Apogee, Jackson developed the proprietary Clair iO: a two-input, six-output digital audio matrix with opto-isolated output circuits. An essential element of the system was its <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> controlled by wireless tablet computer by an audio engineer walking around to various seating sections in a concert venue, to tailor the system's response more precisely.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, viruses {{were defined}} in terms of their infectivity, their <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> filtered, and their {{requirement}} for living hosts. Viruses had been grown only in plants and animals. In 1906, Ross Granville Harrison invented a method for growing tissue in lymph, and, in 1913, E. Steinhardt, C. Israeli, and R. A. Lambert used this method to grow vaccinia virus in fragments of guinea pig corneal tissue. In 1928, H. B. Maitland and M. C. Maitland grew vaccinia virus in suspensions of minced hens' kidneys. Their method was not widely adopted until the 1950s, when poliovirus was grown on a large scale for vaccine production.|$|E
5|$|Depleted uranium is {{also used}} as a {{shielding}} material in some containers used to store and transport radioactive materials. While the metal itself is radioactive, its high density makes it more effective than lead in halting radiation from strong sources such as radium. Other uses of depleted uranium include counterweights for aircraft control surfaces, as ballast for missile re-entry vehicles and as a shielding material. Due to its high density, this material is found in inertial guidance systems and in gyroscopic compasses. Depleted uranium is preferred over similarly dense metals due to its <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> easily machined and cast {{as well as its}} relatively low cost. The main risk of exposure to depleted uranium is chemical poisoning by uranium oxide rather than radioactivity (uranium being only a weak alpha emitter).|$|E

5|$|He is {{critical}} of greed for gold, such as the absurdity of using the metal for coins in the early Republic. He gives examples of the way rulers proclaimed their prowess by exhibiting gold looted from their campaigns, such as that by Claudius after conquering Britain, and tells the stories of Midas and Croesus. He discusses why gold is unique in its malleability and ductility, far greater than any other metal. The examples given are its <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> beaten into fine foil with just one ounce, producing 750 leaves four inches square. Fine gold wire can be woven into cloth, although imperial clothes usually combined it with natural fibres like wool. He once saw Agrippina the Younger, wife of Claudius, at a public show on the Fucine Lake involving a naval battle, wearing a military cloak made of gold. He rejects Herodotus's claims of Indian gold obtained by ants or dug up by griffins in Scythia.|$|E
5|$|In the third-season premiere, Shelly accepts J.T.'s {{marriage}} proposal. Donovan gets a work visa {{after finding}} a job selling makeup products for a British company. Shelly and J.T. break up again, resolving to remain just friends. J.T. pursues a career in medicine and enrolls in the Miami State Medical School. He finds out that college is more difficult than he first thought, and struggles with his classes and finances. During the spring, Rita reignites her relationship with Donovan and buys her own apartment. In the series' finale, Beverly finally admits to Yusef, Shelly's father, that she is carrying his child; Shelly questions his <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a father again.

5|$|Nolan North, {{the voice}} actor who played Drake, {{had a large}} role in {{defining}} the character's physical and vocal reactions. In the Uncharted series, the actors were used for motion capture, and acted as if performing in a movie. Motion capture was done on a soundstage, and the dialog recorded during this process was used in the game. North was allowed to ad-lib dialog and insert aspects of his own personality into the character. In naming the character, the development team considered many different choices, including Ethan, Samuel, and John. Matthew Drake was seriously contemplated, but received a poor reaction from those it was presented to. Eventually, Naughty Dog settled on the name Nathan for its <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> shortened to Nate, and the perception that it sounded historical. Drake's character design changed little between Drake's Fortune and Among Thieves.|$|E
5|$|Promyelocytic leukaemia bodies (PML bodies) are spherical bodies found {{scattered}} throughout the nucleoplasm, measuring around 0.1‚Äì1.0 ¬µm. They are known {{by a number of}} other names, including nuclear domain 10 (ND10), Kremer bodies, and PML oncogenic domains. PML bodies are named after one of their major components, the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML). They are often seen in the nucleus in association with Cajal bodies and cleavage bodies. PML bodies belong to the nuclear matrix, an ill-defined super-structure of the nucleus proposed to anchor and regulate many nuclear functions, including DNA replication, transcription, or epigenetic silencing. The PML protein is the key organizer of these domains that recruits an ever-growing number of proteins, whose only common known feature to date is their <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> SUMOylated. Yet, pml-/- mice (which have their PML gene deleted) cannot assemble nuclear bodies, develop normally and live well, demonstrating that PML bodies are dispensable for most basic biological functions.|$|E
5|$|The {{control systems}} {{also had some}} innovations. The control column was {{centrally}} placed and the pilot sat {{on the port side}} of the cockpit. The column had an extension arm fitted and had the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> swung over to the starboard side in case the pilot was incapacitated. The control instruments were located above the pilot's head in the ceiling, which allowed viewing and did not block the pilot's vision. The fuel instruments were electrical. The He 111 used the inner fuel tanks, closest to the wing root, first. The outer tanks acted as reserve tanks. The pilot was alerted to the fuel level when there was 100L (26US gal) left. A manual pump was available in case of electrical or power failure but the delivery rate of just 4¬ΩL (1.2US gal) per minute demanded that the pilot fly at the lowest possible speed and just below 3,048m (10,000ft). The He 111 handled well at low speeds.|$|E

5|$|Articles 87 through 89 of the Constitution {{deal with}} how the {{presidency}} can change hands in-between election cycles. The President {{has the ability to}} resign from office at any time under Article 87. The letter of resignation is sent to the House of Representatives and is accepted by them. The President has the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> removed from office if his physical or mental health is impaired under Article 88. In order for this to happen, a two-thirds majority must be reached in the House of Representatives and the Council of the Republic on the resolution to remove the President. An ad hoc committee is formed and must make the determination about the state of health before any motion can begin. If the President has committed a grave crime, such as treason, one-third of the House must bring charges against the President formally. The investigation of the charges will be conducted by the Council of the Republic. In order to evict the President from office, a two-thirds majority is needed to vote in favor of conviction. The criminal case is further sent to the Supreme Court for review. The actions of either option must occur one month after the resolution is passed or the action will be considered void by the Constitution.|$|E
