5000|$|... #Caption: <b>Acetylene</b> <b>generator</b> {{as used in}} Bali by a {{reaction}} of calcium carbide with water. This is used where acetylene cylinders are not available. The term 'Las Karbit' means acetylene (carbide) welding in Indonesian.|$|E
50|$|He got a {{job with}} Baguès, an {{electrical}} engineering company in Paris. He left the company after developing the world's first practical headlamp for automobiles, using a compact integral <b>acetylene</b> <b>generator.</b> In 1897, Blériot opened a showroom for headlamps at 41 rue de Richlieu in Paris. The business was successful, and soon he was supplying his lamps to both Renault and Panhard-Levassor, two of the foremost automobile manufacturers of the day.|$|E
5000|$|Carbon dioxide, hydrogen, nitrous oxide, oxygen, ammonia, chlorine, {{sulfur dioxide}} and {{manufactured}} fuel gas were already being {{used during the}} 19th century, and mainly had uses in food, refrigeration, medicine, and for fuel and gas lighting. For example, carbonated water was being made from 1772 and commercially from 1783, chlorine was first used to bleach textiles in 1785 [...] and nitrous oxide was first used for dentistry anaethesia in 1844. At this time gases were often generated for immediate use by chemical reactions. A notable example of a generator is Kipps apparatus which was invented in 1844 [...] and {{could be used to}} generate gases such as hydrogen, hydrogen sulfide, chlorine, acetylene and carbon dioxide by simple gas evolution reactions. Acetylene was manufactured commercially from 1893 and <b>acetylene</b> <b>generators</b> were used from about 1898 to produce gas for gas cooking and gas lighting, however electricity took over as more practical for lighting and once LPG was produced commercially from 1912, the use of acetylene for cooking declined.|$|R
50|$|In 1893, Slattery {{installed}} {{gas lighting}} fixtures with incandescent burners {{into the study}} halls, almost one year before these became available in Australia. In 1895, the college acquired a gasoline powered engine, a six-inch (15 cm) sparking coil and two Crookes tubes. That same year the school upgraded to an oil powered engine, dynamo and storage batteries that supplied electric light to the science halls. At the time {{this was the only}} electric light in Bathurst. Next Slattery built an <b>acetylene</b> gas powered <b>generator</b> to provide stage lighting for the college theater. At this time he developed an early interest in color photography.|$|R
5000|$|In 1905, Andreas Applied to the Commonwealth Commissioner of Patents to {{register}} his improvements to an <b>acetylene</b> <b>generator.</b> Only 46 of his [...] "Fortuna Reel Andreas Pat. No 123405/18 & 19 Ex Wide" [...] were produced between 1934 and 1936 {{and one was}} sold at auction in London on 14 July 2012 for £5,200. His friend and fellow Old Newingtonian, George Harker, was the inventor of a patented system of extinguishing fires at sea and fumigation and in 1908 when the Harker FIre Extinguisher and Fumlgator Company was formed Andreas became a director.|$|E
5000|$|Claiming to be [...] "winner of the Glidden Tour", the 1914 Model 22 was a two-seat {{roadster}} or torpedo. It had a 22½ hp (17 kW) four-cylinder water-cooled engine with Bosch magneto, full-elliptic springs {{front and}} rear. It ran on artillery wheels with Goodrich clincher tires, and featured a Prest-O-Lite-type <b>acetylene</b> <b>generator</b> for the headlights. It {{was billed as}} [...] "gearless", having a friction drive mechanism, and priced at $475; by contrast, the Success was an uncommonly low US$250, the Black started at $375, the Brush Runabout was US$485 Western's Gale Model A was US$500, and even the high-volume Oldsmobile Runabout ten years earlier was US$650.|$|E
5000|$|On January 27, 1901, when Sidna Allen was 35 {{years old}} he got married to Bettie Mitchell. After Sidna and Bettie married, {{they decided to}} build a house. According to the book [...] "The Courthouse Tragedy," [...] the whole house {{was made of the}} best wood around, and there were 8 rooms in the house. In the book it says, [...] "The floors were of oak, except the floor of our living room, which was white maple." [...] The walls in the house were all plastered. It also says, [...] "In the dining room we used quarter-sawed oak, {{finished}} in natural color wainscoting." [...] The roof of the house was made of slate, which back then, all this wood and other materials were very expensive. They had a windmill at the house, and an <b>acetylene</b> <b>generator</b> which is what provided them the lights. The house back in 1911 was worth $13,000.00 and was said to be the most beautiful house in South-West Virginia. But a year later the Hillsville courthouse tragedy occurred and Sidna and his wife had only lived there a year.|$|E
