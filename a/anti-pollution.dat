25|$|On January 16, 2006, it was {{announced}} that Morning Musume had won a Kanagawa Image Up Award in recognition of Hello! Project's support of an <b>anti-pollution</b> campaign. Yoshizawa, Fujimoto, and Takahashi represented the group to accept the award.|$|E
25|$|The cover's dark {{atmosphere}} and Vico C holding up an <b>anti-pollution</b> mask might represent the society's contamination with crime (blood on the street, {{the police car}} behind Vico and a barricade tape), poverty (the homeless man and the buildings deterioration) and prostitution (the strip club at the background).|$|E
25|$|West and Watson argued as {{well over}} lesser issues, such as state aid for {{municipal}} sewer projects, a state college for Rock Hill, and <b>anti-pollution</b> guidelines. Watson vowed if elected {{to sell the}} $600,000 governor's jet, which cost more than $150,000 per year to operate, but West countered that the plane is needed for industrial recruitment.|$|E
25|$|In 1987 fitment of <b>anti-pollution</b> systems {{allowed the}} V6 turbo to be {{distributed}} to Switzerland, Germany, Austria and the Netherlands. 1989 saw {{the launch of the}} limited edition GTA Mille Miles to celebrate Alpine's 35th anniversary. Production was limited to 100 cars, all fitted with ABS braking, polished wheels, special leather interior and paintwork. This version was not available in RHD.|$|E
25|$|On 6 May 2015 it was {{reported}} that during a coast guard inspection of the Polar Pioneer, a piece of <b>anti-pollution</b> gear failed, resulting in fines and delay of the operation. Oil executives from Total and Eni interviewed by the New York Times, expressed scepticism about Shell's new ambitions for offshore drilling in the Arctic, and cited economic and environmental hurdles. ConocoPhillips and Statoil suspended Arctic drilling earlier, after Shell's failed attempt in 2012.|$|E
25|$|Secondly, the <b>anti-pollution</b> and rubbish-recycling {{industries}} can be profitable; {{additional income}} {{is generated by}} low-wage workers cleaning up the environment {{after it has been}} fouled up by rich people. After the largest oil spill in history, the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, J.P. Morgan analysts concluded that the business generated by clean-up work would very likely be larger than the financial losses to tourism or fishing, resulting in a net increase in GDP.|$|E
25|$|The River {{class are}} {{significantly}} {{larger than the}} Island-class vessels and have a large open deck aft allowing them to be fitted with equipment for a specific role, which can include fire-fighting, disaster relief and <b>anti-pollution</b> work. For this purpose, a 25 tonne capacity crane is fitted. In addition, the deck is strong enough for the transport of various tracked and wheeled light vehicles, or an LCVP. The class are primarily used with the Fishery Protection Squadron and EEZ patrol.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s {{it became}} evident that smog from {{factories}} and an ever-increasing fleet of automobiles, {{as well as}} a lack of adequate free space due to congestion, had evolved into the city's most important challenge. A series of <b>anti-pollution</b> measures taken by the city's authorities in the 1990s, combined with a substantial improvement of the city's infrastructure (including the Attiki Odos motorway, the expansion of the Athens Metro, and the new Athens International Airport), considerably alleviated pollution and transformed Athens into a much more functional city. In 2004 Athens hosted the 2004 Summer Olympics.|$|E
25|$|Following the collision, {{there were}} {{concerns}} raised that such {{incidents in the}} area were commonplace, with local politicians on both Gibraltar and Spanish sides calling {{for a review of}} procedures. On 21 August the Spanish Maritime Safety Agency (Salvamento Maritimo) announced that it had put in place its <b>anti-pollution</b> alert program. This involved the deployment of the ship Don Inda, based in Galicia, which arrived at Algeciras on 14 August. On 31 August the European Maritime Safety Agency announced that, {{at the request of the}} Spanish administration the ship Mistra Bay, which specialised in the treatment of pollution, would be sent to the area.|$|E
25|$|With the {{environment}} a national concern by 1970, Chiles announced {{his opposition to}} the Cross Florida Barge Canal. This had originally been supported by every member of the Florida congressional delegation. The project, one-third completed, was cancelled early in 1971; the area is now a protected green belt corridor. Chiles endorsed federal funding to remove waste from Lake Apopka in central Florida, which was known for its bass fish. Cramer received little credit from environmentalists, although he had drafted the Water Pollution Control Act of 1956 and had sponsored legislation to protect alligators, stop beach erosion, dredge harbors, and remove oil spills. Instead, Cramer critics accused him of having weakened <b>anti-pollution</b> laws. Cramer questioned Chiles' opposition to a proposed severance tax on phosphate mining, which particularly affected Tampa Bay.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, the National Academy of Sciences {{was looking}} into {{research}} about the controversial issues regarding acid rain. President Ronald Reagan did not place a huge {{attention on the}} issues of acid rain until his personal visit to Canada and confirmed that Canadian border suffered from the drifting pollution from smokestacks in Midwest of US. Reagan honored the agreement to Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau’s enforcement of <b>anti-pollution</b> regulation. In 1982, US President Ronald Reagan commissioned William Nierenberg to sit on National Science Board. Nierenberg selected scientists including Gene Likens to sit on a panel to draft a report on acid rain. In 1983, the panel of scientists came up with a draft report, which concluded that acid rain is a real problem and solutions should be sought. White House Office of Science and Technology Policy reviewed the draft report and sent Fred Singer’s suggestions of the report, which cast doubt on the cause of acid rain. The panelists revealed rejections against Singer’s positions and submitted the report to Nirenberg in April. In May 1983, the House of Representatives voted against legislations that aimed to control sulfur emissions. There was a debate about whether Nierenberg delayed to release the report. Nierenberg himself denied the saying about his suppression of the report and explained that the withheld of the report after the House's vote was {{due to the fact that}} the report was not ready to be published.|$|E
25|$|Another {{obstacle}} {{emerged on}} June 6. Ameren {{was required to}} install pollution-reducing equipment on its five coal-fired generating plants in 2015. But because Ameren was in financial difficulty, it sought and received a waiver {{from the state of}} Illinois granting it a five-year delay. Ameren sought to transfer this delay to Dynegy, so that Dynegy would not have to immediately install the devices until 2020, either. But the Illinois Pollution Control Board denied Ameren's request. Dynegy filed its own request for a five-year waiver in July, and warned that the Ameren deal would fall apart if it did not receive the waiver. But the Sierra Club, the Environmental Law and Policy Center, and other environmental groups said Dynegy had the resources to install the equipment, and opposed a waiver. ACM Partners, a financial firm hired by the Sierra Club, also argued that Dynegy purposefully left IPH significantly underfunded and unable to tap into the parent company's resources. Dynegy disagreed, but the firm warned that if IPH went bankrupt, workers would lose pensions and local communities would have to pay for any environmental remediation. The Illinois AFL-CIO, however, supported Dynegy's request on September 16, saying that local jobs depended on the waiver. The pollution board said it would make a decision by November 2013. Foresight Energy, a major Illinois coal mining company, said it would install the $500 million <b>anti-pollution</b> devices for free if Dynegy agreed to sign a long-term contract to accept coal only from Foresight Energy. Dynegy declined the offer (in part because it already has long-term coal contracts), and environmental groups opposed it.|$|E
500|$|Following the Exxon Valdez spill, the United States {{passed the}} Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA-90), which {{excluded}} single-hull tank vessels of 5,000 gross tons or more from US waters from 2010 onward, apart from {{those with a}} double bottom or double sides, which may be permitted to trade to the United States through 2015, depending on their age. Following the sinkings of [...] (1999) and Prestige (2002), the European Union passed its own stringent <b>anti-pollution</b> packages (known as Erika I, II, and III), which also require all tankers entering its waters to be double-hulled by 2010. The Erika packages are controversial because they introduced the new legal concept of [...] "serious negligence".|$|E
2500|$|... 1 slot aft. Diana class ships {{normally}} {{operate with}} a storage or <b>anti-pollution</b> module fitted.

2500|$|The Moke {{was built}} in Australia from 1966 to 1981 where it was {{originally}} marketed as the Morris Mini Moke and from 1973 as the Leyland Moke. Initially Australian Mokes had the same 10-inch wheels as British Mokes and Mini saloons but in 1968 these were replaced by 13-inch wheels with longer rear trailing arms, which made them more practical for gentle off-road or beach use than the British version. There was also a widening piece welded to the wheel arches, front and rear to allow for wider tyres and rims. [...] The solid metal seats of the British Mokes were replaced with tubular-framed [...] "deck-chair" [...] seats. This variant started with a 998cc engine, which was switched mid-production to 1,098cc. In 1976, {{with the advent of}} new <b>anti-pollution</b> requirements (Australian Design Rule 27A), the locally manufactured 1,098cc motor was replaced by an imported version of the 998cc motor with an air pump and exhaust gas recirculation, which had been developed to meet UK (US?) <b>anti-pollution</b> requirements.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the fact}} that <b>anti-pollution</b> {{measures}} and patient-support programmes started in the 1970s, it took four more decades for the Government to fully admit responsibility and apologize on-site; [...] On 1 May 2010 Prime Minister Hatoyama was the first Prime Minister {{to participate in a}} yearly-held Memorial Service for the Victims of Minamata Disease and to so demonstrate regret on behalf of the national government.|$|E
2500|$|Amnesty International {{notes that}} China [...] "has the largest {{recorded}} number of imprisoned journalists and cyber-dissidents in the world" [...] and Paris-based Reporters Without Borders stated in 2010 and 2012 that [...] "China is the world's biggest prison for netizens." [...] The offences {{of which they}} are accused include communicating with groups abroad, signing online petitions, and calling for reform and an end to corruption. The escalation of the government's effort to neutralize critical online opinion and organizing comes after a series of large, <b>anti-pollution,</b> anti-corruption protests, and ethnic riots, many of which were organized or publicized using instant messaging services, chat rooms, and text messages. The size of the Chinese Internet police force was reported by the state government to be 2 million in 2013.|$|E
2500|$|Wearing or {{displaying}} a pink ribbon {{has been criticized}} by the opponents of this practice {{as a kind of}} slacktivism, because it has no practical positive effect. [...] It has also been criticized as hypocrisy, because some people wear the pink ribbon to show good will towards women with breast cancer, but then oppose these women's practical goals, like patient rights and <b>anti-pollution</b> legislation. [...] Critics say that the feel-good nature of pink ribbons and pink consumption distracts society from the lack of progress on preventing and curing breast cancer. [...] It is also criticized for reinforcing gender stereotypes and objectifying women and their breasts. [...] Breast Cancer Action launched the [...] "Think Before You Pink" [...] campaign, and said that businesses have co-opted the pink campaign to promote products that cause breast cancer, such as alcoholic beverages.|$|E
2500|$|Charles Thomson {{was born}} in Romford, London Borough of Havering, East London, and educated at Brentwood School, Essex, {{where he was a}} classmate of Douglas Adams. While still at school, he {{organised}} mixed media arts events and contributed to Broadsheet, a magazine edited by Paul Neil Milne Johnstone and published by Artsphere, a school arts group. Outside school, he started the Havering Arts Lab. this resulted in a headline [...] "Sex Orgy Tale—Group Banned" [...] in the local Havering Express newspaper. In 1970 he produced a satirical magazine, called 'Lubricant', which ran for 10 issues. In 1971 he stood (unsuccessfully) as a Dwarf candidate in the Havering council elections, and was involved in <b>anti-pollution</b> protests. He distributed [...] "underground" [...] magazines around London, including [...] "Schoolkids OZ". In 1975 he went to Maidstone College of Art, where he was the only person in ten years to fail the painting degree. 1979–87 he worked part-time as a telephonist and receptionist at Kent County Ophthalmic and Aural Hospital. 1987–99 he was a full-time poet, with work in over 100 anthologies.|$|E
2500|$|In 1990, Howe Kraft was {{replaced}} by Wyatt Robertson, and Believer recorded its second album titled Sanity Obscure, which is more technical than its predecessor. Believer continued its co-working with Scott Laird, and incorporated more symphonic elements on the song ”Dies Irae (Day of Wrath).” Scott Laird's sister Julianne Laird Hoge was featured as a soprano on the song. Sanity Obscure also features an <b>anti-pollution</b> song titled ”Nonpoint” (which the band nonpoint named themselves after) and an anti-drug song called ”Stop the Madness”, which was released as a single with the U2 cover ”Like a Song.” Sanity Obscure was first released by R.E.X. Records to Christian market {{and a year later}} by Roadrunner Records to wider audience. The album became more popular than Believer's first album, and after the release Believer toured with the English deathgrind band Bolt Thrower and the Canadian thrash metal band Sacrifice. Joined by bands Cynic and Pestilence on the label's roster, Roadrunner Records pushed a progressive metal/thrash campaign with the three bands called [...] "The Breed Beyond".|$|E
