5|$|MY09: {{models were}} {{launched}} on 15 March 2008. Six <b>airbags</b> were made standard across the range—Omega and SV6 variants were previously fitted with two and four <b>airbags</b> respectively. Omega models also received standard fitment of air conditioning, 16-inch alloy wheels, body colour wing mirrors and door handles, {{and a new}} grille insert with chrome highlights. Revised alloy wheel designs were featured on the Calais (seven-spoke) and Calais V (10-spoke).|$|E
5|$|Passenger safety {{was a key}} design aspect for the Ford engineers. Anti-lock brakes were {{standard}} on all models; electronic brakeforce distribution was also {{standard on}} most variants. The addition of traction control for higher trim levels helped to prevent loss of traction. On top of this, dual front <b>airbags</b> were a standard fitment across the range; side-impact <b>airbags</b> were equipped on higher luxury levels such as the Fairmont. In a crash safety assessment conducted by ANCAP, the BA model scored 27.27 {{out of a possible}} 37 points, giving a rating of four out of five stars.|$|E
5|$|The Futura model gained power {{adjustable}} pedals, {{and side}} <b>airbags,</b> with a DVD entertainment system being offered on upmarket trim levels. The XR8 sedan variant also received the premium audio system.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate whether the effectiveness of a passenger <b>airbag</b> can be increased by making the passenger <b>airbag</b> adaptive to crash conditions, such as severity and type of impact, belt use, and passenger size. Such an adaptive passenger <b>airbag</b> will better cover a wider range of crash situations than a conventional <b>airbag</b> system. In this study, mathematical modeling was performed for the optimization of an existing passenger <b>airbag</b> restraint system. The final solution can be used as reference for the design of an adaptive <b>airbag</b> system. The present study was divided into four steps: (1) a FEM <b>airbag</b> model was developed by using the MADYMO 3 D program based on an existing prototype of a passenger airbag; (2) the <b>airbag</b> model was validated against <b>airbag</b> static deployment tests, <b>airbag</b> drop tests, and sled tests; (3) the performance of passenger <b>airbag</b> systems of different volumes was evaluated in terms of injury criteria for front seat occupants of different sizes; (4) a parameter study with different impact conditions and varying levels of variables was carried out to find an optimized design of an adaptive passenger <b>airbag</b> restraint system. Three variables selected for passenger <b>airbag</b> optimization are the <b>airbag</b> volume, the bag pressure, and the size of the ventilation hole. Four input factors that varied in different crash conditions are the dummy size, belted/unbelted, impact speed, and rigid/deformable barrier. The HIC, chest acceleration, chest deflection, neck moment, and axial femur force were calculated in each simulation. The effectiveness of the passenger <b>airbag</b> models was evaluated in terms of the injury criteria of FMVSS 208 and other relevant injury parameters. The influence of the <b>airbag</b> variables on the dummy response was analyzed and discussed. The size of the ventilation hole was found to have the dominating influence on the performance of the <b>airbag.</b> The best effect of the passenger <b>airbag</b> system could be obtained either by using a small <b>airbag</b> with high initial pressure or by using a big <b>airbag</b> with low initial pressure. The findings in the present study indicate that a midsize volume (120 -liter) <b>airbag</b> with variable venthole can give front seat occupants of different sizes better protection over a range of crash severities than a conventional big (150 -liter) <b>airbag</b> with only one size of venthole. The results from this study can be used for the development of a future adaptive passenger <b>airbag</b> system...|$|R
50|$|The first {{motorcycle}} crash {{tests with}} an <b>airbag</b> were performed in 1973 and proved that <b>airbag</b> systems could be advantageous to a rider. These tests were followed up by {{tests in the}} 1990s that showed <b>airbag</b> devices could not fully restrain a rider when traveling more than 30 mi/h km/h, but still reduced a rider's velocity {{and his or her}} trajectory. Honda has recently developed a fuel tank mounted <b>airbag</b> for the Goldwing model that takes just 0.15 seconds to deploy. Crash sensors in the front wheel send data to the <b>airbag</b> ECU (electronic control unit) which in turn activates the <b>airbag</b> inflator. The <b>airbag</b> then takes the force of the rider.|$|R

5|$|As {{cars have}} become safer for {{occupants}} (due to <b>airbags,</b> structural crashworthiness and other improvements) {{the percent of}} pedestrian fatalities {{as a percent of}} total motor vehicle fatalities steadily increased from 11% in 2004 to 15% in 2014 according to NHTSA data. Bicyclists accounted for 2 percent of all traffic deaths in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Prevention of MTBI {{involves}} {{general measures}} such as wearing seat belts and using <b>airbags</b> in cars. Older people are encouraged to reduce fall risk by keeping floors free of clutter and wearing thin, flat, shoes with hard soles that do not interfere with balance.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} received knee <b>airbags,</b> lighted rear-seat vanity mirrors, and new trim selections, including bird's eye maple wood. New options {{included an}} updated navigation system, Bluetooth and a backup camera. A driver-programmable electronic key feature allowed {{the vehicle to}} detect the key fob in the owner's pocket and unlock the doors by touch.|$|E

50|$|Advanced <b>airbag</b> {{technologies}} {{are being developed}} to tailor <b>airbag</b> deployment to {{the severity of the}} crash, the size and posture of the vehicle occupant, belt usage, and how close that person is to the actual <b>airbag.</b> Many of these systems use multi-stage inflators that deploy less forcefully in stages in moderate crashes than in very severe crashes. Occupant sensing devices let the <b>airbag</b> control unit know if someone is occupying a seat adjacent to an <b>airbag,</b> the mass/weight of the person, whether a seat belt or child restraint is being used, and whether the person is forward in the seat and close to the <b>airbag.</b> Based on this information and crash severity information, the <b>airbag</b> is deployed at either at a high force level, a less forceful level, or not at all.|$|R
50|$|Driver side <b>airbag</b> {{standard}} in RHD cars, passenger side <b>airbag</b> {{not available in}} them.|$|R
5|$|The semi-luxury Futura variant {{was heavily}} {{based on the}} XT, and marketed towards families. Futura models gained cruise control, 16-inch alloy wheels, rear power windows and full {{body-coloured}} side-view mirrors and side-protection moldings. But, side-impact <b>airbags</b> and power adjustable pedals were only available as options.|$|E
5|$|A {{pulmonary}} contusion {{is usually}} caused directly by blunt trauma {{but can also}} result from explosion injuries or a shock wave associated with penetrating trauma. With the use of explosives during World Wars I and II, pulmonary contusion resulting from blasts gained recognition. In the 1960s its occurrence in civilians began to receive wider recognition, in which cases it is usually caused by traffic accidents. The use of seat belts and <b>airbags</b> reduces the risk to vehicle occupants.|$|E
5|$|Safety {{played a}} {{substantial}} {{role in the}} development of the VX model. Bosch 5.3 anti-lock brakes were made standard on all variants, a first for an Australian manufactured car; and traction control was made available on vehicles equipped with manual transmission. Extensive research was undertaken to reduce the effects from a side-impact collision through modification of the B-pillars. The risk presented by a side-impact collision in a VX fitted without side <b>airbags</b> is reduced by 50percent when compared to a similarly specified VT model.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the injury risk of driver's lower extremities, a driver knee <b>airbag</b> was {{developed}} and optimized by using mathematical models. The influence of eight design parameters of belt and knee <b>airbag</b> on the injuries of driver's lower extremities was analyzed. The result shows that the key influence factors are sensitive to the injuries of lower extremity, including initiation timing of knee <b>airbag,</b> the strap length of knee <b>airbag</b> and area coefficient for the exhaust openings of knee <b>airbag.</b> Based on multi-objective genetic algorithms, an optimization of the knee <b>airbag</b> was conducted in terms of the three factors. After optimization, the injury risk of driver's lower extremities is greatly reduced. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland...|$|R
50|$|A {{rear-facing}} infant restraint put in {{the front}} seat of a vehicle places an infant's head close to the <b>airbag,</b> which can cause severe head injuries, or death if the <b>airbag</b> deploys. Some modern cars include a switch to disable the front passenger <b>airbag,</b> in case a child-supporting seat is used there (although not in Australia, where rear-facing child seats are prohibited in the front where an <b>airbag</b> is fitted).|$|R
50|$|In 1981, Mercedes-Benz {{introduced}} the <b>airbag</b> in West Germany {{as an option}} on its flagship saloon model, S-Class (W126). In the Mercedes system, the sensors would automatically pre-tension the seat belts to reduce occupant's motion on impact (now a common feature), and then deploy the <b>airbag</b> on impact. This integrated the seat belts and <b>airbag</b> into a restraint system, rather than the <b>airbag</b> being considered {{an alternative to the}} seat belt.|$|R
5|$|Since a {{major cause}} of TBI are vehicle accidents, their {{prevention}} or the amelioration of their consequences can both reduce the incidence and gravity of TBI. In accidents, damage can be reduced by use of seat belts, child safety seats and motorcycle helmets, and presence of roll bars and <b>airbags.</b> Education programs exist to lower the number of crashes. In addition, changes to public policy and safety laws can be made; these include speed limits, seat belt and helmet laws, and road engineering practices.|$|E
5|$|Introduced a Mark Levinson premium sound system. In {{its highest}} trim specification, the LS 430 {{included}} Lexus Link telematics, power door and trunk closers, heated and cooled front seats, and power reclining massage rear seats equipped with audio controls, power sunshade, a cooler, and air purifier. Several rear seat features adopted for the LS 430 {{had been previously}} available in Japanese market luxury vehicles. Safety features added to the LS 430 included front and rear side curtain <b>airbags,</b> park sensors, rain-sensing windshield wipers, and electronic brakeforce distribution. The vehicle also gained water repellent windshield and side glass.|$|E
5|$|Lange {{says that}} his girlfriend, Sarah Flannigan (Laura MacDonald), is jogging near the harbor, so Pembleton sends detectives Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Falsone (Jon Seda) to look for her. Lewis and Falsone talk {{about the nature of}} death while {{questioning}} random joggers; their search effort proves fruitless. Lange tries to convince EMT Joy Tolson (Wendee Pratt) to give him painkillers, but she refuses because it will reduce their chances of saving his life, even while she insists he cannot be saved. Pembleton keeps Lange company, despite his initial annoyance at Lange's bullying and mean-spirited attitude. The emergency personnel plan to use <b>airbags</b> to push the subway train away from the platform, then pull Lange free and rush him to the hospital.|$|E

40|$|This work {{presents}} the results of a novel approach to obtaining a geometric mesh of a given <b>airbag</b> after a series of folds are defined on it, for use in crash simulations. The process of <b>airbag</b> folding is simulated as a series of geometric transformations applied on to the <b>airbag</b> mesh, which is modeled as a stack of connected planar layers. Along with these transformations, optimization techniques are used to ensure that there is minimum change in the geometry and the area of the <b>airbag.</b> The results from this approach are compared with several other commercial <b>airbag</b> folding software, and it is observed that the algorithm proves to be very effective in ensuring minimum change in the area and geometry of the <b>airbag</b> during the folding process...|$|R

5|$|It was {{the first}} LS with {{continuous}} controlled Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS). The addition of an automated parallel parking assist feature, {{the first of its}} kind in the U.S., allowed the LS 460 to steer itself into preselected parking spaces. Other drive-assist features included a brake-hold system, radar cruise control, electric variable gear ratio power steering, and electronically controlled braking. The new stability control system was improved to anticipate skids and alter steering assist and gear ratios. The suite of new safety features extended from an eye-tracking Driver Monitoring System to a lane departure warning system. The pre-collision system added the first production image processing chip in a car capable of identifying vehicles and pedestrians in real time, along with millimeter-wavelength radar, stereo cameras, and infrared night vision projectors. A rear pre-collision system with whiplash-preventing active seat headrests and dual-chamber front <b>airbags</b> was also introduced.|$|E
5|$|Holden's {{standardisation}} of six <b>airbags</b> in March 2008 for MY09 {{made the}} VE {{eligible for the}} ANCAP side pole test, yielding additional scoring points. The second stage of the VE's safety rollout in October 2008 for MY09.5 included {{the addition of a}}n energy absorbing steering column shroud and redesigned rear door latches across the VE range. The inclusion of a seat belt reminder on the Omega sedan yielded another point, thus allowing the Omega sedan to score five-stars, or a score of 33.45 when tested the following December. The Omega Sportwagon was the next model to be awarded the full five stars the following February, following the addition of a seat belt reminder in Sportwagon production. The remaining VE models, including the Ute and WM Statesman/Caprice, which had already received most of the safety upgrades, received the seat belt reminder as standard fitment as of MY10 production from August 2009. As a result, all VE sedan and Sportwagon variants along with the extended length WM models received the five-star rating. The VE Ute officially received the rating on 19 October 2009, making the entire line-up of Australian-made Holdens five-star ANCAP rated.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{years the}} {{numerical}} method of the simulation for the <b>airbag</b> deployment {{process has been}} improved with new material model and thermodynamic model, {{and has become a}} standard application of finite element codes. With such simulation tools, it is possible to attempt supporting the <b>airbag</b> module design and evaluating the injuries of dummy in <b>airbag</b> hazard area or out-of-position. Although the simulation model for the <b>airbag’s</b> deployment process is usually correlated with the static <b>airbag</b> deployments and reaction force results, up-to-date the numerical approach to represent the fluid flow within the <b>airbag</b> is both costly and time consuming. This paper will provide an overview of the correlation process for reducing the resource to be invested. The following two tests are conducted for acquiring the reference data. 1. Static deployment test for acquiring the <b>airbag</b> internal pressure during the deployment process and 2. Drop tower test for acquiring the fully deployed <b>airbag’s</b> reaction force. The drop tower test is simulated to determine the parameter related to the leakage of fabric and vent holes with the <b>airbag</b> model using the uniform pressure method offering the relatively short solving time. And then Static deployment test is simulated for determining the parameter related to the unfolding phase with the <b>airbag</b> model using the corpuscular (particle) method. These two simulations are compared to the test results and satisfactory correlation is found in both the cases. The drop tower simulation using the uniform pressure method leads to reduce the total correlation time and to easily extend the application for protection of the driver occupant while in-position. This <b>airbag</b> model can be used in parametric studies to investigate the effects of <b>airbag</b> module design changes and to study the out-of-position (OOP) load case...|$|R
40|$|Many {{accidents}} {{with children}} or small adults, where the ignition of the <b>airbag</b> leads to dangerous and even fatal injuries for the passengers, {{have led to}} a number of efforts to analyze this so-called „Out-of-Position “ load cases more deeply within the development process of an <b>airbag</b> system. In the framework of simulation systems the fluid-structure interaction between the inflating gas and the <b>airbag</b> fabric has not been taken into account in the past. Recent developments in the LS-DYNA software package allow a fully coupled arbitrary Lagrange-Euler formulation and thus a more exact representation of the <b>airbag</b> deployment process within the simulation system. In the present contribution we will describe the standard procedure, based on the assumption of a uniform pressure distribution in the <b>airbag</b> and the recently achieved advances in LS-DYNA with respect to fluidstructure interaction of the expanding gas and the inflating <b>airbag</b> fabric.

40|$|Abstract. Accelerated thermal-oxidative aging {{tests on}} Nylon 66 {{automotive}} <b>airbag</b> material are designed and performed in this paper. After the environmental profile of <b>airbag</b> was analyzed, Nylon 66 <b>airbag</b> yarns were reasonably {{selected as the}} test samples, and its tensile strength {{was chosen as the}} significant character of their aging stability. By heat aging,humidity aging,cycle ageing and comprehensive process aging experiments, 350 dtex Nylon 66 filament were sampled and the tensile strength loss of samples was measured, to determine the mechanisms and factors that influence aging stability of the Nylon 66 <b>airbag</b> materials. The experiment results show that Nylon 66 has excellent aging stability, and that water molecules can accelerate its degradation. The experiment data can be used to predict the <b>airbag</b> lifetime in a benign store environment, and as references in selecting <b>airbag</b> materials...|$|R
