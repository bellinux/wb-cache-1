40|$|This {{article focuses}} on {{partition}} of real and personal property in Florida in the 21 st century. It discusses questions and issues about partitioning real and personal property, so that private lawyers who practice {{in a variety of}} areas can familiarize themselves with how partition proceedings work. Partition of real and personal property is not restricted to one area of the law. Instead, it relates to and bleeds over into a multitude of areas of the law making it necessary for all practitioners to be familiar with the area of partition. Partition is now provided in all 50 states, and Florida’s partition law is regulated by Chapter 64, Florida Statutes. Partition may seem simple and straight forward for the purpose of dividing jointly owned real and personal property, nonetheless the partition process can be cumbersome, unpredictable, and confusing. When joint owners of real and personal property – whether they are married, unmarried live-in companions, cotenants as business partners and shareholders, or beneficiaries of real and personal property – come to a decision to part ways they often find that breaking up their undivided interests is hard to do. Today’s lawyers’ will come in contact with disputes regarding joint ownership of real and personal property especially on account of an improving economy. Cotenants are no longer reluctant to divide and sell their real property on account of the increased value of their jointly held real property in light of a growing and stronger economy. This article discusses issues pertaining to partition, including the following: stating a cause of <b>action</b> <b>for</b> <b>partition</b> and whether property is divisible or indivisible; exceptions to mandatory partition; what is property according to Chapter 64, Florida Statutes; treatment of a deposit and down payment when purchasing jointly titled real property; applicability of the statute of limitations to a partition actions; maximizing interests in real and personal property partition actions and the importance of a written agreement upon separation; contractual and statutory provisions for entitlement to attorney fees; other causes of actions that may be consolidated in a partition proceeding; personal and constructive service of process; when does jointly titled property vest in a cotenant upon death of an cotenant; setoffs and credits in jointly titled marital residence; the benefits and burdens of cotenants of jointly own real and personal property; homestead property and forced sale in partition; “ouster” of one cotenant and the effect of ouster on setoffs and credits; nonexistent and void ab initio marriage and its effect on joint ownership in partition; effect of Obergefell v. Hodges and same-sex marriage on partition...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we outline the {{computation}} of the <b>partition</b> function <b>for</b> the generalized Kodama states (GKod) of quantum gravity using the background field method. We {{show that the}} coupling constant for GKod is the same dimensionless coupling constant that appears in the partition function of the pure Kodama state (Chern [...] Simons functional) and argue that the GKod partition function is renormalizable as a loop expansion in direct analogy to Chern [...] Simons perturbation theory. The GKod partition function contains an infinite set of 1 PI vertices uniquely fixed, {{as a result of}} the semiclassical-quantum correspondence, by the first-order vertex. This implies the existence of a well-defined effective <b>action</b> <b>for</b> the <b>partition</b> function since the `phase' of the GKod, provided a finite state exists, is equivalent to this effective action. Additionally, the separation of the matter from the gravitational contributions bears a resemblance to the infinite dimensional analogue to Kaluza [...] Klein theory. Future directions of research include extension of the computations of this paper to the norm of the GKod as well as to examine the analogue of the Chern [...] Simons Jone's polynomials and link invariants using the GKod as a measure.

40|$|ABSTRACT. — We {{introduce}} a hook length expansion technique and explain how to discover {{old and new}} hook length formulas <b>for</b> <b>partitions</b> and plane trees. The new hook length formulas for trees obtained by our method can be proved rather easily, whereas those <b>for</b> <b>partitions</b> are much more difficult {{and some of them}} still remain open conjectures. We also develop a Maple package HookExp for computing the hook length expansion. The paper {{can be seen as a}} collection of hook length formulas for partitons and plane trees. All examples are illustrated by HookExp and, for many easy cases, expained by well-known combinatorial arguments. Summary § 1. Introduction. Selected hook formulas. Conjecture § 2.

The leading logarithmic divergence of the regularized effective <b>action</b> <b>for</b> the canonical shadow field leads to simple BRST invariant action of conformal field.
