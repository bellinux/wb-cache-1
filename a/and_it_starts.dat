As air is drawn into the column, the bulk density decreases <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>starts</b> to rise buoyantly into the atmosphere. At {{a point where the}} bulk density of the column {{is the same as the}} surrounding atmosphere, the column will cease rising and start moving laterally. Lateral dispersion is controlled by prevailing winds and the ash may be deposited hundreds to thousands of kilometres from the volcano, depending on eruption column height, particle size of the ash and climatic conditions (especially wind direction and strength and humidity).|$|E

Three of them are stolen by a group called Phantom Pain, which is controlled by the Blue Cosmos terrorist organization. Cagalli's bodyguard Athrun Zala joins ZAFT pilot Shinn Asuka to stop them. During the fight, ZAFT's battleship Minerva is ordered to destroy the ruins of a space colony to prevent it from crashing into Earth. They find out that rogue ZAFT soldiers are controlling the colony in order to crash it into Earth. After failing to completely destroy the colony, a second war starts between the factions, the Earth Alliance and ZAFT, once news has spread that ZAFT soldiers caused the colony to collide on Earth. The neutral country of Orb allies with the Earth Alliance, with the former having also joined Blue Cosmos. This leads these three faction to confront the ZAFT soldiers several times, with Athrun having returned there.|$|E

2500|$|Stallions {{form and}} expand their harems by abducting young mares from their natal harems. When a mare reaches sexual maturity, she will exhibit the oestrous posture, which attracts nearby {{stallion}}s, both bachelors and harem leaders. Her family stallion (likely her father) will chase off or fight stallions attempting to abduct her. Even after a young mare is isolated from her natal harem, {{the fight over}} her continues until her estrous cycle is over, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>starts</b> again with the next estrous cycle. It is rare that the mare's original abductor keeps her for long. When the mare finally ovulates, the male that impregnates her keeps her for good. Thus, the mare becomes a permanent member of a new harem. The estrous posture of a female becomes less noticeable to outside males as she gets older, hence competition for older females is virtually non-existent.|$|E

2500|$|In 2008, Bauhaus {{released}} {{their first}} new studio album since 1983, Go Away White (Cooking Vinyl). It marked the band's {{end and the}} album had no promotional tour. In late 2007, Kevin Haskins said [...] "We were getting along really well, {{but there was an}} incident that occurred", and added that as a result, [...] "Some of us just felt that we didn't want to carry on as a working unit". In early 2008, Murphy claimed that he [...] "was most satisfied with the bonding on an emotional level. It was good to be working together and to put the past behind us and it was very positive. The result was coming out really fast, so it was exciting and it was very enjoyable", but in the end, [...] "that rocky character worked and I think it was a bit right to finish it, really". The same year, David J commented on the breakup: [...] "You have a test tube, and you pour in one chemical, and you pour in another chemical, and something happens. It starts to bubble. Pour in another chemical, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>starts</b> to bubble a bit more. You pour in a fourth chemical, and it bubbles really violently, and then explodes. That's my answer".|$|E
2500|$|The album's first song, [...] "My Boy", {{opens to}} crowd noise, {{engineered}} by Brendan Reilly and Aaron Sokell. Described as [...] "one {{of the few}} songs to sound as though it emerged from the 21st century", it {{was said to be}} a reference point and introduction to the [...] "classic girl group sound" [...] seen on Endlessly, and {{a combination of the two}} aforementioned styles. As with the rest of the album, it was written and produced by Duffy and Hammond. It was praised for its use of keyboards and percussion, played by Hammond, said to [...] "sound like piano's laughing", and [...] "creating a preponderance of beats that dig themselves into your brain", respectively. Lyrically, Duffy sings of [...] "the completely rude and judgemental comments made about her relationship with a significantly younger gentleman." [...] The next song, titled [...] "Too Hurt to Dance", was called a [...] "grand glitterball ballad", and is inspired by the music of the 1950s. Q named it the ninth best song of December 2010, whilst Kitty Empire of The Observer was critical of Duffy's voice on the song, noting that her [...] "quacking patent-leather vocal" [...] was of prevalence. This was in contrast to the disco music displayed in [...] "Keeping My Baby", which again received comparisons to the music of Minogue. Originally intended to be the second single released from the album, it was said to omit a tango style, and was both positively and negatively received by critics. As lyrically it is sung from the point of view of a pregnant girl, it was compared to the song [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] (1986) by Madonna. The single [...] "Well, Well, Well" [...] follows. Said to debut Duffy's [...] "inner diva", the song, like [...] "Mercy" [...] (2008) is heavily influenced with Northern Soul, aided by a rhythm section provided by The Roots. Duffy was able too secure their part in the song and others on the album through telephoning the president of Island Def Jam Records, LA Reid. It was negatively reviewed by the BBC Chart Blog, as despite its provocative lyrics and challenging nature, [...] "it basically has one idea, one note, one refrain, and it stops <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>starts</b> and it repeats and repeats and repeats like someone is prodding and prodding at your chest." [...] The reviewer continued that the song was [...] "monumentally irritating", a sentiment that several reviewers echoed. Elsewhere, it was described as an [...] "instant classic".|$|E

Zuckerberg writes: [...] "I read over all the stuff you sent and it seems like it shouldn't take too long to implement, so we can talk about that after I get all the basic functionality up tomorrow night." [...] The next day, on December 1, 2003, Zuckerberg sent another email to the HarvardConnection team. [...] "I put together one of the two registration pages so I have everything working on my system now. I'll keep you posted as I patch stuff up <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>starts</b> to become completely functional." [...] On December 4, 2003, Zuckerberg writes: [...] "Sorry I was unreachable tonight. I just got about three of your missed calls. I was working on a problem set." [...] On December 10, 2003: [...] "The week has been pretty busy thus far, so I haven't gotten a chance to do much work on the site or even think about it really, so I think it's probably best to postpone meeting until we have more to discuss. I'm also really busy tomorrow so I don't think I'd be able to meet then anyway." [...] A week later: [...] "Sorry I have not been reachable for the past few days. I've basically been in the lab the whole time working on a cs problem set which I'm still not finished with." [...] On December 17, 2003, Zuckerberg met with the Winklevosses and Narendra in his dorm room, allegedly confirming his interest and assuring them that the site was almost complete. On the whiteboard in his room, Zuckerberg allegedly had scrawled multiple lines of code under the heading “Harvard Connection,” however, this would be the only time they saw any of his work. On January 8, 2004, Zuckerberg emailed to say he was [...] "completely swamped with work [...] week" [...] but had [...] "made some of the changes ... and they seem to be working great" [...] on his computer. He said he could discuss the site starting the following Tuesday, on January 13, 2004. On January 11, 2004, Zuckerberg registered the domain name thefacebook.com. On January 12, 2004, Zuckerberg e-mailed Eduardo Saverin, saying that the Facebook site [...] was almost complete and that they should discuss marketing strategies. Two days later, on January 14, 2004, Zuckerberg met again with the HarvardConnection team; however, he allegedly failed to disclose registering the domain name thefacebook.com or developing a competing social networking website. Rather, he allegedly reported progress on HarvardConnection, told the team he would continue to work on it, and would email the group later in the week. On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched thefacebook.com, a social network for Harvard students, designed to expand to other schools around the country.|$|E

6000|$|It {{was a warm}} golden evening, fit for October, and I was {{watching}} (with regret) {{a lot of little}} black pigs being turned out of my garden, when the postman handed to me, with a perfunctory haste which doubtless masked his emotion, the Declaration of Futurism. If you ask me what Futurism is, I cannot tell you; even the Futurists themselves seem a little doubtful; perhaps they are waiting for the future to find out. But if you ask me what its Declaration is, I answer eagerly; for I can tell you quite a lot about that. It is written by an Italian named Marinetti, in a magazine which is called Poesia. It is headed [...] "Declaration of Futurism" [...] in enormous letters; it is divided off with little numbers; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>starts</b> straight away like this: [...] "1. We intend to glorify the love of danger, the custom of energy, the strengt of daring. 2. The essential elements of our poetry will be courage, audacity, and revolt. 3. Literature having up to now glorified thoughtful immobility, ecstasy, and slumber, we wish to exalt the aggressive movement, the feverish insomnia, running, the perilous leap, the cuff and the blow." [...] While I am quite willing to exalt the cuff within reason, it scarcely seems such an entirely new subject for literature as the Futurists imagine. It seems to me that even through the slumber which fills the Siege of Troy, the Song of Roland, and the Orlando Furioso, and in spite of the thoughtful immobility which marks [...] "Pantagruel," [...] "Henry V," [...] and the Ballad of Chevy Chase, there are occasional gleams of an admiration for courage, a readiness to glorify the love of danger, and even the [...] "strengt of daring," [...] I seem to remember, slightly differently spelt, somewhere in literature.|$|E
