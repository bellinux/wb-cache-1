5|$|ASL {{is thought}} to have {{originated}} in the American School for the Deaf (ASD), founded in Hartford, Connecticut in 1817. Originally known as The American Asylum, At Hartford, For The Education And Instruction Of The Deaf <b>And</b> <b>Dumb,</b> the school was founded by the Yale graduate and divinity student Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet. Gallaudet, inspired by his success in demonstrating the learning abilities of a young deaf girl Alice Cogswell, traveled to Europe in order to learn deaf pedagogy from European institutions. Ultimately, Gallaudet chose to adopt the methods of the French Institut National de Jeunes Sourds de Paris, and convinced Laurent Clerc, an assistant to the school's founder Charles-Michel de l'Épée, to accompany him back to the United States. Upon his return, Gallaudet founded the ASD on April 15, 1817.|$|E
5|$|Sailor Brian Hancock {{encountered}} Hurricane Lili {{during the}} Route of Discovery yacht race from Benalmádena, Spain to Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic.Tropical Storm Lili was traveling at around 18 knots {{along the same}} path as the race fleet and was starting to pick off the slower boats. Astern of us we were getting reports of gale force winds, ripped sails and some damage all the while Lili gained in strength. By our calculation we would get to the Bahamas before the storm did, but {{the problem was that}} the Bahamas were not our final destination. We had to round San Salvador and then sail just under 500 miles back toward the east, well southeast to be exact. We rounded San Salvador and sailed slap bang into the teeth of a ferocious storm. Hurricane Lili was packing around 70 to 80 knots of wind and we hove to to ride it out. I remember feeling exhilarated by it all.

(He would not even admit pupils who could sign, so only 14 were admitted.) This was {{the policy of the}} school until 1979.

25|$|He {{journeyed to}} Peshawar {{with the help}} of the Abwehr, where he was met by Akbar Shah, Mohammed Shah and Bhagat Ram Talwar.

For this reason, he enlisted the help of Mian Akbar Shah, then a Forward Bloc leader in the North-West Frontier Province. Shah had been out of India en route to the Soviet Union, and suggested a novel disguise for Bose to assume. Since Bose could not speak one word of Pashto, it would make him an easy target of Pashto speakers working for the British. For this reason, Shah suggested that Bose act deaf <b>and</b> <b>dumb,</b> and let his beard grow to mimic those of the tribesmen. Bose's guide Bhagat Ram Talwar, unknown to him, was a Soviet agent.|$|E
