It may also derive from not being satisfied during sex, which may be due to issues such as anorgasmia, <b>anaphrodisia,</b> premature ejaculation, delayed ejaculation, erectile dysfunction or an incompatibility or discrepancy in libido.|$|E
50|$|Although {{an average}} {{individual}} {{may have an}} aversion to particular bodyparts, the hallmark of eurotophobia is that it exceeds the disinclinations shown by most people, and is a trait that can inauspiciously affect both men and women. The condition is sometimes linked to erotophobia and can affect an individual's confidence in social and professional interactions. The condition can emanate from both a direct antipathy, to a woman's vicarious perception of what others, such as a spouse, might think of her vulva. Symptoms include anxiety, inhibition, distractions, <b>anaphrodisia</b> and an inability to construct a romantic relationship. People with such inclinations may express a compounded desire to substitute audible mentions of the vulva with euphemisms. The extent of the condition varies from person to person, with some feeling a sense of repulsion, others reacting only once evoked, avoidance of thinking about female sex organs or a sense of deep fear. Eurotophobia has also been given an account by Planned Parenthood in the lexicon section of their publications.|$|E
