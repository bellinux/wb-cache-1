40|$|The aims of this {{extended}} essay are {{to identify}} what types of bacteria are present at school environment and what type of cleaning product {{is the most effective}} at decreasing their growth when the surfaces are cleaned manually. In other words, bactericidal properties of various cleaning agents are compared within the scope of this study. My research question is: “Is there a statistically significant mean difference between the selected cleaning products, which are named as soft soap, multi-purpose cleaner 1 and 2, <b>alkaline</b> <b>disinfectant</b> and alkaline surface cleaner, in terms of their bactericidal effects on bacterial flora found in school environment?” It was hypothesized that; there would be a significant mean difference in terms of bactericidal effect in between the cleaning agents used. <b>Alkaline</b> <b>disinfectant</b> would be the most effective, followed by the other alkaline products (alkaline surface cleaner and soft soap), and then the neutral products (multi-purpose cleaners). In order to test the hypothesis, bacterial samples were collected from each student’s desk before and after wiping with each product. According to the variety and amount of bacteria that grow after overnight incubation, types of bacteria present, and bactericidal actions of the products were determined. Amount of bacteria was reported in colony forming units per milliliter, and the units were counted by microbiologists. Resultantly, alkaline surface cleaner reduced the largest number of colony forming units, followed by <b>alkaline</b> <b>disinfectant,</b> soft soap and multi-purpose cleaners respectively. Cheaper multi-purpose cleaner reduced more units than the expensive one, so it was concluded that the expensive was not worth its price. ANOVA results revealed that there was a significant mean difference between the agents in terms of their bactericidal effects, with the alkaline surface cleaner being the most effective, followed by <b>alkaline</b> <b>disinfectant,</b> soft soap and multi-purpose cleaners...|$|E
40|$|Digital {{dermatitis}} is a {{major problem}} in the dairy production in many countries. Footbaths have been the preferred method in the control of digital dermatitis, and various products are used in despite of a lack of scientific evidence of the effect. The objective was to evaluate calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) 2) used in footbaths as treatment and prevention of digital dermatitis. The study was conducted as a clinical trial in 4 commercial Danish dairy herds including 405 cows. Ca(OH) 2 is an <b>alkaline</b> <b>disinfectant</b> which is recommended in footbaths to control digital dermatitis by some Danish hoof trimmers. The footbath used in the study was a commercial available split-footbath, which made it possible to treat one side of the cow and using the other side as a negative control. Digital dermatitis lesions were registered in a trimming chute {{at the start of the}} study. The prevalence of active digital dermatitis lesions in the hind legs was 40...|$|E
40|$|Enterococci {{are common}} milk contaminants, and {{microbial}} contamination of milk by {{this group of}} microorganisms can occur {{from a variety of}} sources. Significance of enterococci can be assessed by many separated points of view, otherwise a lot of research has focused on the potential role of food enterococci as reservoirs and/or vehicles of antibiotic resistance. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the occurence of enterococci in rinses of milking equipment (n = 38) on two farms using automatic sanitation system. Our results showed, that <b>alkaline</b> <b>disinfectant</b> (on chlorine basis) was effective towards enterococci because apart from 2 samples, their presence in rinses has not been determined. Average number of enterococci survived the aplication of acid disinfectant reached the value 5. 00. 101 CFU. ml- 1. Together, 60 strains were randomly isolated and identified from the grown colonies of genus Enterococcus, and E. faecalis was the predominat species (69. 6 %). In rinses, also E. faecium, E. mundtii and undefined enterococci were found. Among antibiotic resistant isolates, 83. 9 % of isolates were sensitive to erytromycin (15 mcg/disk) and resistant to vancomycin (30 mcg/disk) were 20 % of isolates...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} the ability of six yeast and two bacterial species associated with wine spoilage to form biofilms in mono- or co-culture using the Calgary Biofilm Device (CBD). Moreover, the efficacy of several disinfectants was evaluated against these spoilage microorganisms, both in the planktonic and the biofilm states. Results showed that Dekkera bruxellensis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomycodes ludwigii, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Acetobacter aceti formed biofilms both in wine and in synthetic medium. Zygosaccharomyces bailii formed biofilm only in wine and Pichia guilliermondii and Lactobacillus hilgardii formed biofilms only in synthetic medium. In wine, D. bruxellensis presented the same biofilm population when grown in pure culture or in mixed culture with acetic acid bacteria. There was a 3 -log increase in biofilm formed by A. aceti in mixed culture with L. hilgardii. <b>Alkaline</b> chlorine-based <b>disinfectant</b> was the most effective in decontaminating spoilage yeast and bacteria both in planktonic and biofilm tests. Sodium hydroxide-based detergents and peracetic-based disinfectant were also efficient against suspended cells, but at least 10 - fold more concentrated solutions were needed to remove the biofilms. Furthermore, the results showed that, except for the neutral detergent VK 10, the tested agents wereactually effective when used under the conditions recommended by manufacturers. In any case, biofilms showed greater tolerance to biocides when compared to the same microorganisms in the planktonic state. To our knowledge, this is the first study in which the CBD is used to assess the ability of wine spoilage microorganisms to form biofilms and their susceptibilities to disinfectant agent...|$|R
40|$|A {{strain of}} Listeria monocytogenes {{isolated}} from a drain in a food-processing plant was demonstrated, by determination of D values, {{to be more}} resistant to the lethal effect of heat at 56 or 59 °C following incubation for 45 min in tryptose phosphate broth (TPB) at pH 12. 0 than to that of incubation for {{the same time in}} TPB at pH 7. 3. Cells survived for at least 6 days when they were suspended in TPB at pHs 9. 0, 10. 0, and 11. 0 and stored at 4 or 21 °C. Cells of L. monocytogenes incubated at 37 °C for 45 min and then stored for 48 or 144 h in TPB at pH 10. 0 were more resistant to heat treatment at 56 °C than were cells stored in TPB at pH 7. 3. The alkaline-stress response in L. monocytogenes may induce resistance to otherwise lethal thermal-processing conditions. Treatment of cells in 0. 05 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7. 00 ± 0. 05) containing 2. 0 or 2. 4 mg of free chlorine per liter reduced populations by as much as 1. 3 log 10 CFU/ml, while treatment with 6. 0 mg of free chlorine per liter reduced populations by as much as 4. 02 log 10 CFU/ml. Remaining subpopulations of chlorine-treated cells exhibited some injury, and cells treated with chlorine for 10 min were more sensitive to heating at 56 °C than cells treated for 5 min. Contamination of foods by L. monocytogenes cells that have survived exposure to processing environments ineffectively cleaned or sanitized with <b>alkaline</b> detergents or <b>disinfectants</b> may have more severe implications than previously recognized. Alkaline-pH-induced cross-protection of L. monocytogenes against heat has the potential to enhance survival in minimally processed as well as in heat-and-serve foods and in foods on holding tables, in food service facilities, and in the home. Cells surviving exposure to chlorine, in contrast, are more sensitive to heat; thus, the effectiveness of thermal processing in achieving desired log 10 -unit reductions is not compromised in these cells...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the work}} {{was to examine the}} effect of {{different}} disinfectants on production trichothecenes (especially of T- 2 toxin and deoxynivalenol). Lipophilicity, chemical structure, the presence of bioactive groups and functional groups in their structure modifies biological activity and toxic potency of trichothecenes. For this reason, limits have been established designating maximum levels of mycotoxins in cereals while maintaining proper growing practices. Appropriate nutritive media were prepared with different concentration of tested disinfectants (Desanal A  plus, ProCura spray and Guaa-Pool) and were inoculated using   Fusarium strains. The density of  Fusarium was 10 5 spores per mililitre. Nutrient media was cultivated at 15 °C and 25 °C for seven days. The strains of Fusarium graminearum CCM F- 683 and Fusarium species (isolated from barley) produced quantities of deoxynivalenol. Fusarium poae CCM F- 584 and Fusarium species (isolated from malthouse air) produced quantities of T- 2 toxin. Desanal A plus prevented Fusarium growth and production of T- 2 toxin and deoxynivalenol at the concentration 10 %. It is an <b>alkaline</b> <b>disinfectant</b> on the basis of active chlorine and the surfactant that contains ˂ 5 % of NaClO. ProCura spray at the concentration 0. 6 % proved to be very effective. This disinfectant contains 35 % of propan- 1 -ol and 25 % of propan- 2 -ol.   Guaa-Pool at the concentration 0. 004 % proved to be very effective. It is a polymeric disinfectant with anion surface-acting agent and it contains ˂ 0. 9 % of polyhexamethylene guanidine hydrochloride and ˂ 0. 2 % of alkyl (C 12 -C 16) dimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride. Lower contentration of  disinfectants that  not prevented growth of Fusarium caused higher production  of T- 2 toxin and deoxynivalenol. The contents of T- 2 toxin and deoxynivalenol were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using commercially produced kits (Agra Quant ® Deoxynivalenol Test kit and Agra Quant ® T- 2 toxin Test kit). The experiment showed that the variability in the production of T- 2 toxin and deoxynivalenol depended on the Fusarium strain used, concentration of disinfectants and temperature of cultivation. <!
