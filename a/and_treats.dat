30|$|Evidently, the {{adsorption}} process {{consisted of two}} main reaction stages; a fast adsorption followed by a slow adsorption. The fast Na+ {{adsorption process}} by the natural <b>and</b> <b>treated</b> zeolite material occurred among the 100  min. The rapid process is then followed by a slow adsorption that gradually decreased as contact time increased. After 480  min, the Na+ adsorption process almost reached the maximum adsorption capacity under the experimental conditions for natural <b>and</b> <b>treated</b> zeolite material.
