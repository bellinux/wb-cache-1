5|$|While {{the show}} was still in previews, writer Owen Davis claimed the story had been lifted from his earlier play Lola, which had {{appeared}} briefly on Broadway in March 1911, then was adapted as <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>in</b> 1914.

5|$|Guardians of the Galaxy earned $11.2 {{million on}} its Thursday night pre-opening, surpassing Captain America: The Winter Soldiers gross ($10.2 million) {{for the biggest}} Thursday evening start for <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>in</b> 2014. IMAX {{accounted}} for 17% of the total gross ($1.9 million), which was the biggest August pre-release in IMAX format. On its opening day, the film earned $37.8 million, including the Thursday night earnings.

5|$|Later, a huge onboard {{television}} screen displays an emergency message {{from a military}} officer, warning the crew and passengers about a deadly virus that has started to spread on the mainland. He says that all ships must remain at sea to ensure that humanity survives. The message is actually taken from <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>in</b> the Simpson cabin's DVD library, set up by Bart to broadcast all over the ship. He also disables communications with the mainland by pouring hot fudge on a control panel. As the ship stays at sea, conditions deteriorate and the food supply starts to run out. Eventually, the cruise turns into a post-apocalyptic civilization, with gladiator arenas, marauders, capital punishment, and Priddis claiming kingship over the passengers.|$|E

5|$|The movie {{rights to}} Night of January 16th were {{initially}} purchased by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in October 1934 {{as a possible}} vehicle for Loretta Young. They hired Rand to write a screenplay, but the project was scrapped. After MGM's option expired, Woods considered making a movie version through a production company of his own, but in 1938 RKO Pictures bought the rights for $10,000, a fee split between Woods and Rand. RKO considered Claudette Colbert and Lucille Ball as possible stars, but they also gave up on the adaptation. The rights were resold to Paramount Pictures in July 1939 for $35,000. Paramount released <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>in</b> 1941; Rand {{did not participate in}} the production.
