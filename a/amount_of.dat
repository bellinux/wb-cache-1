5|$|Appendicitis {{may present}} with vomiting, {{abdominal}} pain, {{and a small}} <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> diarrhea in up to 33% of cases. This {{is in contrast to}} the large <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> diarrhea that is typical of gastroenteritis. Infections of the lungs or urinary tract in children may also cause vomiting or diarrhea. Classical diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, but without diarrhea. One study found that 17% of children with DKA were initially diagnosed as having gastroenteritis.|$|E

5|$|As many {{symptoms}} {{of carbon monoxide}} poisoning also occur with many other types of poisonings and infections (such as the flu), the diagnosis is often difficult. A history of potential carbon monoxide exposure, such as being exposed to a residential fire, may suggest poisoning, but the diagnosis is confirmed by measuring the levels of carbon monoxide in the blood. This can be determined by measuring the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> carboxyhemoglobin compared to the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> hemoglobin in the blood.|$|E

40|$|Acid {{metabolic}} {{products of}} 23 strains {{of human and}} animal pathogenic corynebacteria, representing eight different species, were determined by gas chromatography. The {{results showed that the}} species examined were metabolically heterogeneous and could be presumptively identified based on the acid products produced. Corynebacterium equi did not produce any acids; C. renale produced lactate; and C. pyogenes produced major <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> lactate, variable <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> acetate, and minor <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> succinate and pyruvate. C. kutscheri produced propionate and lactate as major products and pyruvate and oxalacetate as minor products. C. diphtheriae and C. pseudotuberculosis produced major <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> propionate, acetate, and formate. In addition, C. pseudotuberculosis produced major <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> pyruvate and minor <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> succinate, lactate, and oxalacetate, whereas C. diphtheriae strains produced minor but variable <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> lactate, succinate, fumarate, pyruvate, and oxalacetate. C. bovis produced aicd products similar to those of C. pyogenes but was readily distinguishable from the latter by the lack of hemolysis on blood agar, colony morphology, catalase reaction, and biochemicals. C. suis characteristically produced major <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> ethanol, acetate, and formate and minor <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> lactate and succinate but no propionate...|$|R

50|$|Many {{biological}} and forensic cases involving genetic analysis require sequencing of DNA from minute <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> sample, such as DNA from uncultured single cells or trace <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> tissue collected from crime scenes. Conventional Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-based DNA amplification methods require sequence-specific oligonucleotide primers and heat-stable (usually Taq) polymerase, {{and can be}} used to generate significant <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> DNA from minute <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> DNA. However, this is not sufficient for modern techniques which use sequencing-based DNA analysis. Therefore, a more efficient non-sequence-specific method to amplify minute <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> DNA is necessary, especially in single cell genomic studies.|$|R

5|$|Despite these advances, {{movable type}} {{printing}} never gained the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> widespread use in East Asia that woodblock printing had achieved since the Chinese Tang Dynasty in the 9th century.

Furthermore, the European printing press, first invented by Johannes Gutenberg (1398–1468), was eventually wholly adopted as the standard in China, yet the tradition of woodblock printing remains popular in East Asian countries still.|$|E
