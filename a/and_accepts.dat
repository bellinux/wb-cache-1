40|$|About the {{expression}} of giving <b>and</b> <b>accepting</b> in Japanese, the differences between honorific and unhonorific expression of giving <b>and</b> <b>accepting</b> verbs {{are very difficult to}} Chinese learners. It's said about {{the expression}} of giving <b>and</b> <b>accepting,</b> that there are seven giving <b>and</b> <b>accepting</b> verbs <b>and</b> these verbs have a complicated system like honorific and unhonorific expression, inside and outside expression in Japanese, but Chinese is very easy and just has one verb without any systems by okutukeiitirou. In fact, because there are honorific and unhonorific expression in Japanese, there is a direction of {{up and down in the}} relationship between giving <b>and</b> <b>accepting.</b> On the other hand, in Chinese, the verb for giving <b>and</b> <b>accepting</b> doesn't have a difference between honorific and unhonorific expressions, so maybe there is no direction up and down just from the verb. In this paper, comparison of Japanese and Chinese about the direction of up and down in the relationship between giving <b>and</b> <b>accepting</b> will be looked at with a focus on the verbs of giving <b>and</b> <b>accepting</b> in Japanese...|$|R

5|$|Disraeli {{justified}} {{his ideas}} by {{his belief in}} an organic society in which the different classes have natural obligations to one another. He saw society as naturally hierarchical and emphasised the obligation of those at the top to those below. This was based in the feudal concept of noblesse oblige, which asserted that the aristocracy {{had an obligation to}} be generous and honourable; to Disraeli, this implied that government should be paternalistic. Unlike the New Right, one-nation conservatism takes a pragmatic and non-ideological approach to politics <b>and</b> <b>accepts</b> the need for flexible policies; one-nation conservatives have often sought compromise with their ideological opponents for the sake of social stability. Disraeli justified his views pragmatically by arguing that, should the ruling class become indifferent to the suffering of the people, society would become unstable and social revolution would become a possibility.|$|E

5|$|In 2012 {{the museum}} was headed by Sujatmiko. That year David Kristian Budhiyanto of Petra Christian University wrote that {{the museum was}} rarely visited and in some places poorly maintained.

In order to attract new visitors, the museum has {{initiated}} several competitions in 2012 and 2013, including a photography contest on the museum's Facebook page. It has also undertaken mobile exhibitions, showing some of its collection in cities such as Yogyakarta and Magelang. Between January and September 2013 the museum received 26,249 visitors, an increase of 250 per cent over the previous year's target; this was credited to the various promotional efforts undertaken.

In this period, he disguises himself as an impoverished, old leper and becomes a man-servant of Banai's father.
