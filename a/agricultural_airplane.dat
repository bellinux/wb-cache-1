50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s Cessna decided {{to expand their}} already wide line of light {{aircraft}} by entering the agricultural aircraft market. They surveyed pilots and operators of other brands of agricultural aircraft to see what features and capabilities these operators were looking for. The resulting aircraft was a conventional single-seat, piston-engined, strut-braced low-wing <b>agricultural</b> <b>airplane.</b>|$|E
50|$|Agricultural {{airplanes}} {{are typically}} certificated {{in the normal}} category at a moderate weight. For single-engine airplanes this requires successful demonstration of the one-turn spin. However, with the agriculture hopper full these airplanes are {{not intended to be}} spun and recovery is unlikely. For this reason, at weights above the maximum for the normal category, these airplanes are not subjected to spin testing and, as a consequence, can only be type certificated in the restricted category. As an example of an <b>agricultural</b> <b>airplane,</b> see the Cessna AG series.|$|E
40|$|The time {{structure}} {{characteristics of}} <b>agricultural</b> <b>airplane</b> missions were studied by using records from NASA VGH flight recorders. Flight times varied {{from less than}} 3 minutes to more than 103 minutes. There was {{a significant reduction in}} turning time between spreading runs as pilot experience in the airplane type increased. Spreading runs accounted for only 25 to 29 percent of the flight time of an <b>agricultural</b> <b>airplane.</b> Lowering the longitudinal stick force appeared to reduce both the turning time between spreading runs and pilot fatigue {{at the end of a}} working day...|$|E
40|$|Small {{scale models}} of <b>agricultural</b> <b>airplanes</b> were tested and {{numerical}} methods were utilized to study {{interactions between the}} airplane wake and the dispersed spray and granular materials. Methods were developed to measure and predict dispersal transport and wake characteristics and dispersal techniques to obtain interactions more favorable to wide, uniform deposition patterns and reduced drift. In the full scale wind tunnel, full scale <b>agricultural</b> <b>airplanes</b> and dispersal systems for both liquid and solid applications were evaluated to improve aircraft aerodynamics and dispersal systems efficiency. The program status in these two facilities is reported with emphasis on wake interactions and dispersal systems research...|$|R
50|$|To reduce {{drift of}} the sprayed materials, {{agricultural}} pilots attempt to fly {{just above the}} crops being treated. Fields are often surrounded by obstacles such as trees, telephone lines, and farm buildings. Purpose-built <b>agricultural</b> <b>airplanes</b> have strengthened cockpits to protect the pilot if an accident occurs.|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} {{procedure is}} given and cases analyzed {{for the effects}} of wing geometry on lateral transport of a variety of agricultural particles released in the wake of an <b>agricultural</b> <b>airplane.</b> The cases analyzed simulate the release of particles from a fuselage centerline-mounted dry material spreader; however, the procedure applies to particles released anywhere along the wing span. Consideration is given to the effects of taper ratio, aspect ratio, wing loading, and deflected flaps. It is noted that significant lateral transport of large particles can be achieved using high-lift devices positioned to create a strong vortex near the location of particle release...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} wingtip {{modifications}} on {{the stability and}} control characteristics of an <b>agricultural</b> <b>airplane</b> has been studied {{by means of a}} nonplanar quasi-vortex-lattice method. The method is used to compute the changes in steady state and perturbed state lateral-directional stability and control derivatives produced by wingtip mounted winglets, vortex diffuser vanes, and tip extensions. The study shows that the combination of the excessive positive dihedral effect produced by the winglets and adverse yaw due to aileron deflection can have a detrimental effect on the roll control characteristics of the airplane. Introduction of an aileron-rudder-interconnect, and reduction of the effective dihedral by canting-in of the winglets, or addition of a lower winglet can eliminate the roll control problems...|$|E

5000|$|In 1991, barrel {{bombs were}} used by Croatian forces against Serbian forces during the Battle of Vukovar, where they were dropped from Antonov An-2 <b>agricultural</b> <b>airplanes.</b> The device was called the Bojler Bomba ("boiler bomb") as it was made by filling {{ordinary}} household hot water boilers with explosives and shrapnel. The effects were predominantly psychological. As background, a Croatian airforce was established in 1990, made up of volunteers from a sports club at Sinj. They were private individuals and enthusiasts. Their weapons were home-made and improvised. Bojler Bomba are now on display {{at a number of}} museums in Croatia including the Technical Museum Zagreb and the Military Museum of the Croatian Ministry of Defence. Human Rights Watch (HRW) also reported a first-hand account of a boiler bomb being used in ground combat in Zlatište. A 70 kg boiler bomb was rolled down a hill into enemy trenches while snipers tried to blow it up before it reached their position - it eventually got stuck in a tree and [...] "all it did was destroy a lot of trees".|$|R
50|$|In his new {{position}} {{he had to}} face many problems and overcome bureaucratic hurdles. The Civil Aviation of Kazakhstan had a great development and a powerful qualitative leap forward {{during the time of}} his management. It {{became one of the most}} advanced sectors of the Kazakh economy, which was equipped with advanced aviation technology. By the early 1980s more than one hundred thousand kilometers of air lines were opened in Kazakhstan. The capital of Kazakh SSR Alma-Ata was linked to all the capitals of Soviet republics. Also, Alma-ata was linked with all regional centers of Kazakhstan and various major cities and resort areas of the Soviet Union. More than fifty percent of Kazakhstan's population each year used these air transport services of Aeroflot Soviet Airlines. Up to fifteen million hectares of farmland were served by <b>agricultural</b> special <b>airplanes.</b> Seventeen airports were built during this time, as well as ten airports having their own hotels. Even in small villages of Kazakhstan people were able to purchase airflight tickets to any point of destination of the Soviet Union. The appearance of a new airplanes for civil and cargo usage such as models An-24, An-26, An-30, Il-18, Il-62, Il-86, Tu-134, Tu-154, Yak-40, Mi-2, and Mi-8 required the presence of highly qualified crew, engineering, and dispatch teams. All pilots of large airplanes had higher education. One out of every seventh employee of the technical aviation base had engineering degree.Under Kuznetsov’s leadership many professional aviators were trained, as well as flight operators, and other aviation related professionals. The Academy of Civil Aviation was founded in Alma-Ata. At the same time the Flight School was founded in Aktobe. The Ministry of Civil Aviation of the USSR founded a flight operations school in Burunday village. With the development of new aircraft in Domodedovo and Sheremetyevo airports in Moscow the flight personnel of Kazakhstan were predominantly selected.|$|R
40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{wind-powered}} drive location and functioning pecularities of <b>agricultural</b> <b>airplane</b> special equipment. The data on the advantages and prospects {{of the use of}} the wind-powered drive on agricultural aircraft as well as the experimental and analytical data on discontinuity of the wind stream in the zone of the wind-powered drive installa- and parameters of its operation at aerial spraying on the example of specially equipped An- 2 are presented. A mathe- matical model of a wind propeller in discontinuous wind stream is developed. Software package to comprehensively assess wind-powered drive conditions and performance indicators is generated and tested taking into account experimental data, as well as airplane performance and flight modes. The typical data on the wind propeller and the wind-powered drive in the spraying process are received; specific features of the dynamics at the wind-powered drive turning-on and the wind propel- ler rotation at zero load are determined and the data on the wind-propeller blades load imbalance at spraying and transient processes are defined. The author made a quantitative estimation of how the standard change of flight parameters and the operation of the aircraft power plant at spraying influence on the factors of wind-powered drive operation and working liq- uids suppey.

40|$|Nonplanar {{wing tip}} mounted lifting {{surfaces}} reduce lift induced drag substantially. Winglets, which are small, nearly vertical, winglike surfaces, are {{an example of}} these devices. To achieve reduction in lift induced drag, winglets produce significant side forces. Consequently, these surfaces can seriously affect airplane lateral directional aerodynamic characteristics. Therefore, the effects of nonplanar wing tip mounted surfaces on the lateral directional stability and control of low speed general aviation airplanes were studied. The study consists of a theoretical and an experimental, in flight investigation. The experimental investigation involves flight tests of winglets on an <b>agricultural</b> <b>airplane.</b> Results of these tests demonstrate the significant influence of winglets on airplane lateral directional aerodynamic characteristics. It is shown that good correlations exist between experimental data and theoretically predicted results.

40|$|Introduction: The <b>agricultural</b> <b>airplane</b> pilot are daily {{exposed to}} intense noises, being {{susceptible}} to the noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and its auditory and extra auditory effects. Objective: To analyze the audiological profile of this population, verifying the work's influence on its hearing. Method: It was realized a retrospective, individual, observational, and cross-sectional study through {{the data obtained by}} means of a questionnaire and audiometric thresholds of 41 agricultural pilots. To the statistical analysis were utilized the chi-square, Spearman, and Wilcoxon tests with significance level of 5 %. Results: It was verified that 95, 1 % of the pilots use PPE (personal protective equipment) during flight and 58, 5 % have contact with pesticides. More than half of individuals referred to feel auditory and extra auditory symptoms, being the buzz the more frequent (29, 1 %). It has the occurrence of 29, 3 % of NIHL suggestive hearing loss and 68, 3 % of normality, taking this presence of unilateral notch in 24, 4 % and bilateral notch in 31, 7 %. It was found correlation statistically significant in the associations between time of service and the average of the acute frequencies in the right ear (p= 0038), and in the left ear (p= 0, 010). It has a statistical tendency in the association between audiometric configuration and contact with pesticides (p= 0, 088). Conclusion: The hearing loss prevalence in this study was showed high. More than half of the sample has normal audiometric thresholds with notch configuration.
