50|$|The Mars Society internationally has pioneered a {{field of}} study known as Mars {{analogue}} research. This seeks to investigate technologies, exploration strategies and human factors issues involved in the future human exploration of Mars by undertaking realistic earth based simulations. In doing so, it seeks to highlight gaps in the existing body of knowledge, and encourage further research by the wider scientific community. MSA has run a number of Mars analogue research projects taking advantage of internationally recognised Mars analogue locations in outback Australia. The Society's vision is to position Australia {{for participation in the}} eventual establishment of a human presence on Mars. MSA has published widely in conference proceedings and peer reviewed Australian and international journals, including the Journal of the British Interplanetary <b>Society,</b> and the <b>American</b> <b>Astronautical</b> <b>Society's</b> science and technology series.|$|R

40|$|According to Dr. Edward J. Weiler, Director of the Goddard Space Flight Center, "Exploration without {{science is}} tourism". At the <b>American</b> <b>Astronautical</b> <b>Society's</b> 43 rd Annual Robert H. Goddard Memorial Symposium {{it was quite}} {{apparent}} to all that NASA's current Exploration Initiative is tightly coupled to multiple scientific initiatives: exploration will enable new science and science will enable exploration. NASA's Science Mission Directorate plans to develop priority science missions that deliver science that is vital, compelling and urgent. This paper will discuss {{the theme of the}} Goddard Memorial Symposium that science {{plays a key role in}} exploration. It will summarize the key scientific questions and some of the space and Earth science missions proposed to answer them, including the Mars and Lunar Exploration Programs, the Beyond Einstein and Navigator Programs, and the Earth-Sun System missions. It will also discuss some of the key technologies that will enable these missions, including the latest in instruments and sensors, large space optical system technologies and optical communications, and briefly discuss developments and achievements since the Symposium. Throughout history, humans have made the biggest scientific discoveries by visiting unknown territories; by going to the Moon and other planets and by seeking out habitable words, NASA is continuing humanity's quest for scientific knowledge...|$|R
