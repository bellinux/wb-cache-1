40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Economics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. Tourism <b>and</b> <b>trade</b> {{are growing}} at an {{unprecedented}} rate. The United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) barometer (2007) finds that foreign arrivals for January 2007 to August 2007 showed a 5. 6 percent increase {{compared with the}} previous year. Furthermore, the World Trade Organization (2007) finds that merchandise trade grew by 8 percent worldwide. A {{number of studies have}} been conducted internationally on the relationship between tourism <b>and</b> <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> empirical evidence for these studies support that, in many cases, a relationship does indeed exist. The main objective {{of this study is to}} examine the relationship between tourist arrivals <b>and</b> <b>trade</b> in South Africa. In order to do this, the empirical investigation is divided into two analyses. The first analysis involved a panel set data which includes tourism <b>and</b> <b>trade</b> data of 40 countries with South Africa for the period 1992 - 2007. In the second analysis, South Africa's nine main tourism <b>and</b> <b>trade</b> partners namely: Argentina, Australia, Botswana, France, Germany, Japan, Mozambique, the Netherlands, the U. K. and the U. S. were identified and investigated on their own. Using cointegration tests, Granger causality and Block exogeneity tests, the long-term relationship between tourist arrivals <b>and</b> <b>trade</b> in South Africa was investigated, as well as which series leads the other series, thus assisting in predicting that series. The results for the first, panel data analysis indicate that, for South Africa as a whole, there is indeed a long-term relationship between tourist arrivals <b>and</b> <b>trade,</b> that trade predicts tourist arrivals and tourist arrivals influence trade. The second analysis involved analysing the relationship between tourist arrivals <b>and</b> <b>trade</b> between South Africa and South Africa's main tourism <b>and</b> <b>trading</b> partners. The results show that certain control variables, namely climate, travel costs, price competitiveness and exchange rates, were added to reveal the effect that it might have on the relationship between tourist arrivals <b>and</b> <b>trade.</b> These results indicate that a causal relationship between tourism <b>and</b> <b>trade</b> still exists for Argentina, Australia, Germany and the Netherlands. For Argentina, Germany <b>and</b> the Netherlands, <b>trade</b> leads to tourism and a two-way causality exists between tourism <b>and</b> <b>trade</b> for Australia. However, when examining France, the United Kingdom, Japan, Mozambique and the United States, no direct relationship can be determined between tourism <b>and</b> <b>trade.</b> In these cases, the link between tourism <b>and</b> <b>trade</b> is explained by one or more of the control variables. The tourist arrivals of Mozambique and the United States were the exception, as these arrivals could not be explained by trade or any of the other control variables. This study therefore concludes that there is indeed a long-term relationship between tourist arrivals <b>and</b> <b>trade</b> in South Africa, <b>and</b> that <b>trade</b> predicts tourist arrivals, and tourist arrivals influence trade.
