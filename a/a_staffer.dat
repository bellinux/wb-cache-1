25|$|The {{series was}} {{originally}} pitched to HBO, though the network preferred the series {{to have been}} a Taxicab Confessions-style series taking place at the Gold & Silver's night window.

The network concurred, believing that name to be more pleasing and easily remembered. The staffer adjusted its story-line in order to bring it in line with the network's brand, which included the on-camera experts appraising the items brought into the Gold & Silver, though she did not discourage the interpersonal conflicts among the show's stars.|$|E
