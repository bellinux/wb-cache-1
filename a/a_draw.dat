5|$|Chess {{players and}} theoreticians have long debated whether, given perfect play by both sides, the game should {{end in a}} win for White, or <b>a</b> <b>draw.</b> Since {{approximately}} 1889, when World Champion Wilhelm Steinitz addressed this issue, the overwhelming consensus has been that a perfectly played game would end in <b>a</b> <b>draw.</b> However, a few notable players have argued that White's advantage may be sufficient to force a win: Weaver Adams and Vsevolod Rauzer claimed that White is winning after the first move 1.e4, while Hans Berliner argued that 1.d4 may win for White.|$|E
5|$|If {{the player}} to move has no legal move, {{the game is}} over; it is either a checkmate (a loss for the player with no legal moves) if the king is under attack, or a {{stalemate}} (<b>a</b> <b>draw)</b> if the king is not.|$|E

5|$|In {{the next}} match against Lancashire, Toshack made four in Australia's 204, before {{claiming}} both openers {{after they had}} put on 48, including Test batsman Cyril Washbrook.

After six consecutive matches {{in the space of}} 21 days, Toshack was rested for the next two matches against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge and Hampshire; the matches ended in <b>a</b> <b>draw</b> and an eight-wicket Australian win respectively.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we study}} {{a new problem}} of finding <b>a</b> convex <b>drawing</b> of graphs with a non-convex {{boundary}}. It is proved that every triconnected plane graph whose boundary is fixed with a star-shaped polygon admits <b>a</b> <b>drawing</b> in which every inner facial cycle is <b>drawn</b> as <b>a</b> convex polygon. Such <b>a</b> <b>drawing,</b> called <b>an</b> inner-convex <b>drawing,</b> can be obtained in linear time. ...|$|R

50|$|A {{complete}} {{bipartite graph}} Ka,b has <b>a</b> RAC <b>drawing</b> with straight edges if {{and only if}} either min(a,b) ≤ 2 or a + b ≤ 7. If min(a,b) ≤ 2, then the graph is a planar graph, and (by Fáry's theorem) every planar graph has <b>a</b> straight-line <b>drawing</b> with no crossings. Such <b>a</b> <b>drawing</b> is automatically <b>a</b> RAC <b>drawing.</b> The only two cases remaining are the graphs K3,3 and K3,4. <b>A</b> <b>drawing</b> of K3,4 is shown; K3,3 can be formed from it by deleting one vertex. Neither of the next two larger graphs, K4,4 and K3,5, has <b>a</b> RAC <b>drawing.</b>|$|R

5|$|The next {{match was}} The Undertaker against Batista in a Last Man Standing Match for the World Heavyweight Championship. At one spot, Undertaker leg dropped Batista through an {{announce}} table. Towards the end, the two fought up the entrance ramp, where Batista speared to The Undertaker off the stage. Neither man {{could get to}} their feet before the referee's count of ten; in result, the match ended in <b>a</b> <b>draw.</b> Due to WWE regulations, titles can't change hands in a Last Man Standing match by <b>a</b> <b>draw,</b> so The Undertaker remained champion.|$|E
40|$|This paper proposes <b>a</b> <b>drawing</b> tool {{recognition}} method {{based on}} features {{calculated from the}} shape of stroke endings. The application for this method is to help art historians to identify the drawing tool used for <b>a</b> <b>drawing.</b> Since the style of <b>a</b> <b>drawing</b> depends on the drawing tool used, drawing tool recognition {{is an important step}} toward a style analysis. A dominant feature of <b>a</b> <b>drawn</b> stroke is its ending. Several features regarding curvature, proportions etc. are calculated out of the shape of the endings. These features are then used to classify stroke endings with a SVM classifier. ...|$|R

5|$|The old rivalry {{reached its}} peak {{in the final round}} of the 2000–01 season, when one of the most celebrated matches in Slovenian League history was played. Olimpija met Maribor at their home stadium, Bežigrad, and both teams were {{competing}} for their fifth Slovenian League title. The home team needed a win for the title, while <b>a</b> <b>draw</b> was enough for Maribor. The atmosphere was electric days before the kick-off, and the stadium with a capacity of 8,500 was completely sold out. At the end, the match ended with <b>a</b> <b>draw</b> (1–1) and Maribor started to celebrate their fifth consecutive title in front of 3,000 of their fans that gathered in Ljubljana that day.|$|E

5|$|Amid this environment, Davidson was {{selected}} for New South Wales. On debut against South Australia, Davidson claimed the wicket of Bob McLean with his second ball and finished with 4/32. He then made 34 with the bat as New South Wales took a 282-run lead, but was unsuccessful in the second innings, taking 0/90 as South Australia held on for <b>a</b> <b>draw.</b>|$|E

40|$|Traditional graph drawing {{algorithms}} {{can also}} be called one-shot algorithms because given a graph as input, they typically construct <b>a</b> <b>drawing</b> only once. However, in several applications, such as software engineering and database design, users interact extensively with a displayed graph, continuously adding or deleting its vertices and edges. In such a scenario, <b>a</b> graph <b>drawing</b> system should update <b>a</b> <b>drawing</b> each time the displayed graph is updated by the user. Unfortunately, traditional drawing algorithms may not be suitable in such situations. Since they typically construct <b>a</b> <b>drawing</b> from scratch, they may fail to update <b>a</b> <b>drawing</b> quickly after the user updates the displayed graph. Also, the new drawing constructed after the update may be {{significantly different from the}} previous drawing even if only a small change was made in the displayed graph, making it difficult for the user to correlate the previous drawing and the new <b>drawing</b> (making only <b>a</b> small change in <b>a</b> <b>drawing</b> when <b>a</b> sma [...] ...|$|R

5|$|Arsenal {{began the}} match the {{brighter}} {{of the two}} teams, dominating in possession {{and the number of}} chances created. Tottenham created their best chance to score in the first half, but struggled to find a breakthrough in the second half, hardly troubling the Arsenal defence. With neither team able to score after 90 minutes, the match ended in <b>a</b> <b>draw,</b> meaning each team held the trophy for six months each.|$|E
5|$|As of August 27, 2017, 115 golden point {{games have}} been played, with 14 {{remaining}} <b>a</b> <b>draw</b> after the {{ten minutes of}} golden point extra-time. Johnathan Thurston has scored the winning points on four occasions, more {{than anyone in the}} NRL. Clinton Schifcofske, Chris Sandow, Trent Hodkinson, Cooper Cronk, Josh Reynolds and Daly Cherry-Evans have each scored the winning points on three occasions. Todd Carney, Jarrod Sammut, Luke Burt, Luke Walsh, Darren Lockyer, Stacey Jones and Mitchell Pearce have also achieved the feat more than once. The Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks have played the most golden point games with 18 in total, while Manly-Warringah have played the least with eleven. The Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs are the most successful team under the format, having won nine of their thirteen golden point matches (including <b>a</b> <b>draw),</b> whilst the Wests Tigers have lost twelve of their sixteen matches. The St. George Illawarra Dragons were the final club to win their first golden point match, after five previous failed attempts. The South Sydney Rabbitohs have featured in the most drawn matches with four, followed by the New Zealand Warriors and Brisbane Broncos with three drawn matches.|$|E
5|$|Australia went on {{to start}} the post-war Ashes era with a {{crushing}} win by an innings and 332 runs.
