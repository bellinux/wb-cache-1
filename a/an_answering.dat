25|$|Questions {{were raised}} {{on why the}} SS Uganda {{did not come to}} give {{assistance}} when the distress rockets were fired. The captain of the ship, Captain Kilpatrick, stated that he thought the lights were from Troubridge Island Lighthouse, and were not distress signals; as a result, he continue on according to procedure. This excuse was challenged {{by the fact that the}} locals nearby could see and identify the lights as distress signals. Furthermore, one of the survivors stated that the SS Uganda did answer the distress signal by replying with <b>an</b> <b>answering</b> light. This suggests that they knew what it was but did not came to help them.|$|E

25|$|Some {{cassettes}} {{were made}} to play a continuous loop of tape without stopping. Lengths available are from around 30 seconds to a standard full length. They are used in situations where a short message or musical jingle is to be played, either continuously or whenever a device is triggered, or whenever continuous recording or playing is needed. Some include a sensing foil on the tape to allow tape players to re-cue. From as early as 1969 various patents have been issued, covering such uses as uni-directional, bi-directional, and compatibility with auto-shut-off and anti-tape-eating mechanisms. One variant has a half-width loop of tape for <b>an</b> <b>answering</b> machine outgoing message, and another half-width tape on spools to record incoming messages.|$|E
500|$|... "Shake It Off" [...] {{is a song}} {{performed}} by American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey, taken from her tenth studio album, The Emancipation of Mimi (2005). It was written and produced by Carey along with Jermaine Dupri, Bryan-Michael Cox, and Johntá Austin. The song was initially solicited to radio on July 12, 2005 by Island and Mercury Records as the album's third single in the United States, while [...] "Get Your Number" [...] served as the album's third single elsewhere. Described by Dupri as [...] "ghetto," [...] the track is a R song that makes use of pop and hip hop influences and a simple, sparse production. Lyrically, the song follows Carey as she moves on from her relationship with an unfaithful lover, packing her things and breaking up with him over <b>an</b> <b>answering</b> machine.|$|E
500|$|... "Bye Bye Baby" [...] is a hip hop {{and dance}} song which {{begins with the}} declaration, [...] "This is not a love song". A low bass is heard against a high-pitched 1960s {{keyboard}} sound. Madonna's vocals were attenuated to sound much thinner with more treble. Guitar sounds are spread throughout occasionally with shouting voices being heard in the background. The song ends {{with the sound of}} an explosion. Madonna's filtered voice sounds like <b>an</b> <b>answering</b> machine; the final line, [...] "You fucked it up", is bleeped out like the machine's end-of-message tone. According to the sheet music published by Alfred Publishing Inc., the song is set in the time signature of common time with a fast tempo of 120 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of F minor, with Madonna's voice in a high register, spanning between F3 to A4. The song has a basic sequence of G–B–G–D–G–Dm as its chord progression.|$|E

50|$|However, {{although}} {{more difficult to}} implement, saturation arithmetic has numerous practical advantages. The result is as numerically close to the true answer as possible; for 8-bit binary signed arithmetic, when the correct answer is 130, it is considerably less surprising to get <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> of 127 from saturating arithmetic than to get <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> of −126 from modular arithmetic. Likewise, for 8-bit binary unsigned arithmetic, when the correct answer is 258, it is less surprising to get <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> of 255 from saturating arithmetic than to get <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> of 2 from modular arithmetic.|$|R

Jerry's friend Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) tells George how something similar happened to her brother-in-law, {{who took care of}} the problem by secretly switching the tape. Jerry advises George to wait a few days for Carol to call back; George agrees, but continues to leave increasingly angry — and eventually almost hostile — messages on her machine. When he discovers she was out of town, he decides to go through with the plan of changing the tape. Frustrated by his inability to use <b>an</b> <b>answering</b> machine, George convinces Jerry to go with him. They decide to wait for Carol outside her apartment, and George will distract her while Jerry changes the tape. They succeed, but, just as they are about to leave Carol's apartment, she tells George that she had already heard the messages and found them funny, adding that she [...] "loves jokes like that." ...|$|E
500|$|Pippa Trench (née Croker) (Janine Duvitski) – Patrick's wife sought {{friendly}} {{relations with}} the Meldrews and, after a while, became good friends with Margaret. The two women usually attempt to get the men {{to make peace with}} each other at least once per series. Eventually Patrick proposes that the Trenches move house, but they soon realise that the Meldrew curse has followed them: Victor sent workmen to their home, thinking they were removal men who had initially come to the wrong house. They were in fact from a house clearance firm Margaret had employed to clear her late cousin Ursula's country mansion. The workmen consequently cleared Patrick and Pippa's house of their entire furniture and sold it for a mere four hundred and seventy five pounds. Pippa is slightly dim-witted (once described by Victor as a [...] "gormless twerp" [...] on <b>an</b> <b>answering</b> machine message, unaware she was listening)for example, believing Victor had murdered an elderly blind man simply because the victim had been found clutching a double-one domino in his hand, and Victor had two pimples on his nose.|$|E
500|$|It took Levi {{approximately}} {{one year to}} record all of his dialogue {{due in part to}} his busy schedule. Levi recorded once every six weeks for six hours at a time, recording each of his lines at least twice. The actor's voice ultimately helped shape and develop Flynn's character. Howard explained, [...] "He's so smart and clever, and his adlibs are so great, and you like him straight away ... he brings that to Flynn." [...] On Levi's own influence on his character, the actor explained that Flynn's [...] "voice was really just a slight variation of [...] own". Wanting to sound [...] "more appropriate" [...] for the film's medieval setting, Levi [...] "cleaned up [...] own diction and made things a little bit more polished", referring to Flynn's accent as Mid-Atlantic. Describing Tangled as a [...] "very family friendly" [...] version of Romancing the Stone (1984), Levi studied and channelled the film's star, American actor Michael Douglas, and English legend Robin Hood. However, when Levi heard his performance in its entirety for the first time after the film's release, the actor admitted that he was ultimately dissatisfied with his performance, explaining, [...] "I felt like I sounded incredibly nasally and I was plugged up," [...] likening the experience to hearing one's voice played back on <b>an</b> <b>answering</b> machine.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 1690s, London {{had only one}} officially countenanced theatre company, the [...] "United Company", badly managed and with its takings bled off by predatory investors ("adventurers"). To counter the {{draining}} of the company's income, the manager Christopher Rich slashed the salaries and traditional perks of his skilled professional actors, antagonising such popular performers as Thomas Betterton, the tragedienne Elizabeth Barry, and the comedian Anne Bracegirdle. Colley Cibber wrote in his autobiography that {{the owners of the}} United Company, [...] "who had made a monopoly of the stage, and consequently presumed they might impose what conditions they pleased upon their people, did not consider that they were all this while endeavouring to enslave a set of actors whom the public… were inclined to support." [...] Betterton and his colleagues set forth the bad finances of the United Company and the plight of the actors in a [...] "Petition of the Players" [...] submitted to the Lord Chamberlain. This unusual document is signed by nine men and six women, all established professional actors, and details a disreputable jumble of secret investments and [...] "farmed" [...] shares, making the case that owner chicanery rather than any failure of audience interest was {{at the root of the}} company's financial problems. Barely veiled strike threats in the actors' petition were met with <b>an</b> <b>answering</b> lock-out threat from Rich in a [...] "Reply of the Patentees", but the burgeoning conflict was pre-empted by a suspension of all play-acting from December until March 1695 on account of Queen Mary's illness and death. During this interval, a cooperative actors' company took shape under the leadership of Betterton and was granted a Royal [...] "licence to act" [...] on 25 March, to the dismay of Rich, who saw the threat too late.|$|E

Then a wet wind blew, and ruined all the uniforms of that gorgeous army; and the oaks, who had held themselves in reserve, buckled on their dull and bronzed cuirasses and stood it out stiffly to the last blown leaf, till nothing remained but pencil-shadings of bare boughs, and one could see into the most private heart of the woods." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the intimate relationship between philosophy and theology, another {{important aspect of the}} method of correlation is Tillich’s distinction between form and content in the theological answers. [...] While the nature of revelation determines the actual content of the theological answers, the character of the questions determines the form of these answers. [...] This is because, for Tillich, theology must be <b>an</b> <b>answering</b> theology, or apologetic theology. God is called the “ground of being” because God is the answer to the ontological threat of non-being, and this characterization of the theological answer in philosophical terms means that the answer has been conditioned (insofar as its form is considered) by the question. [...] Throughout the Systematic Theology, Tillich is careful to maintain this distinction between form and content without allowing one to be inadvertently conditioned by the other. [...] Many criticisms of Tillich’s methodology revolve around this issue of whether the integrity of the Christian message is really maintained when its form is conditioned by philosophy.|$|E
