5|$|The {{original}} mihrab, {{uncovered in}} 1933, has a semi-dome above {{it with a}} marble column on either side. Intricate stucco decorations were a prominent feature of the mosque, with the mihrab and the walls ornately decorated. The mihrab had two sets of verses from the Quran inscribed in the conch, which is still intact. The first set of verses are the three that open al-Mu’minoon:Successful indeed are the believers – who are humble in their prayers – and who avoid vain talkThe next inscription {{is made up of}} verses 162 and 163 of al-An'am:Say: Surely my prayer and my sacrifice and my life and my death are (all) for Allah, the Lord of the worlds – No associate has He; and this am I commanded, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>the</b> first of those who submit.These inscriptions are the only surviving piece of decoration that has been definitively traced to the Fatimids.|$|E

500|$|As in Islam, a {{fundamental}} tenet of Judaism is that God is {{not bound by}} any limitations of time, matter, or space, and {{that the idea of}} any person being God, a part of God, or a mediator to God, is heresy. The Book of Ezra, which Judaism accepts as a chronicle of the life of Ezra and which predates Muhammad and the Qur'an by around 1000 years, gives Ezra's human lineage as being the son of Seraiah and a direct descendant of Aaron. Tractate Ta'anit of the Jerusalem Talmud, which predates Muhammad by two to three hundred years, states that “if a man claims to be God, he is a liar.” Exodus Rabba 29 says, [...] "'I am the first <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>the</b> last, and beside Me there is no God' I am the first, I have no father; I am the last, I have no brother. Beside Me there is no God; I have no son." [...] However the term 'sons of gods' occurs in Genesis. The Encyclopedia of Judaism clarifies that the title of 'son of God' is attributed a person whose piety has placed him in a very near relationship to God and [...] "by no means carries the idea of physical descent from, and essential unity with, God".|$|E
500|$|Due to the Palm Beach media {{attention}} and the Thomas hearings, Kennedy's public image suffered. A Gallup Poll gave Kennedy {{a very low}} 22percent national approval rating. A Boston Herald/WCVB-TV poll found that 62 percent of Massachusetts citizens thought Kennedy should not run for re-election, by a 2-to-1 margin thought Kennedy had misled authorities in the Palm Beach investigation, and had Kennedy losing a hypothetical Senate race to Governor William Weld by 25points. Meanwhile, at a June 17, 1991, dinner party, Kennedy saw Victoria Anne Reggie, a Washington lawyer at Keck, Mahin & Cate, a divorced mother of two, and {{the daughter of an}} old Kennedy family ally, Louisiana judge Edmund Reggie. They began dating and by September were in a serious relationship. In a late October speech at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, Kennedy sought to begin a political recovery, saying: [...] "I am painfully aware that the criticism directed at me in recent months involves far more than disagreements with my positions ... involves the disappointment of friends and many others who rely on me to fight the good fight. To them I say, I recognize my own shortcomings– the faults in the conduct of my private life. I realize that I alone am responsible for them, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>the</b> one who must confront them." [...] In December 1991, the William Kennedy Smith rape trial was held; it was nationally televised and the most watched until the O. J. Simpson murder case three years later. Kennedy's testimony at the trial seemed relaxed, confident, and forthcoming, and helped convince the public that his involvement had been peripheral and unintended. Smith was acquitted.|$|E

2500|$|In early 1985, Models started {{recording}} {{material for}} their next album, Out of Mind, Out of Sight, produced by Launay, Lucas and Mark Opitz. A single from the album, [...] "Barbados", was released in March, which peaked at No.2. It was a reggae influenced song co-written by Freud and Duffield (prior to his departure). The song related a tale of alcoholism and suicide, it later provided Freud with the titles of his two autobiographies, I Am the Voice Left from Drinking (2002) <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>Am</b> <b>the</b> Voice Left from Rehab (2007).

2500|$|Models' {{extended}} live exposure {{ensured that}} {{they stayed in}} the public eye when other contemporaries had been forgotten: the band's later work remained popular on radio throughout the 1990s; this, coupled with critical acclaim and cult appeal of earlier work, re-stimulated interest in their work {{in the latter half of}} that decade. The band reformed for a few gigs in 2000; in 2001 their rarities album Melbourne was released. Freud has written two memoirs, I Am The Voice Left From Drinking (2002) <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>Am</b> <b>The</b> Voice Left From Rehab (2007); the titles are both taken from [...] "Barbados" [...] and allude to his addiction with drugs and alcohol, and his subsequent recovery attempts.|$|E

[...] On the Gemini City album, Nigel of Bermondsey covered his song The Green Man Is Come. His texts for Beltane, Lammas and Samhain featured on the MegaT album with music by Universal Mind Sound System. His poems Spark In the Dark <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>Am</b> <b>The</b> Wind featured on Hawklords' 2012 album We Are One.

2500|$|On April 5, 2006, Rae {{applied for}} {{membership}} in the Liberal Party of Canada. His candidacy for the federal party leadership was supported by Greg Sorbara and George Smitherman, former Chrétien aides Eddie Goldenberg and Rae's brother John, as well as former top Martin advisor John Webster and others associated with the Martin camp. He announced his candidacy on April 24, 2006. At his campaign launch he responded to his critics by saying, [...] "I made mistakes before I was in politics, I made mistakes when I was in politics, I made mistakes as premier... I can only tell you I have learned from those mistakes <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>the</b> wiser for them." [...] Rae's predecessor as premier, David Peterson who was supporting Michael Ignatieff, criticized Rae's entry into the race due to his record as NDP provincial premier, though insisting that he did not hold a personal grudge against Rae.|$|E
