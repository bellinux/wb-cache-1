5|$|Another {{difficulty}} encountered {{during the}} aircraft's introduction was {{the occurrence of}} surging and stalling with the Avon engines. The F.2, which used the Armstrong-Siddeley Sapphire engine, did not suffer from this issue. Further problems occurred; ejected cannon ammunition links {{had a tendency to}} strike and damage the underside of the fuselage, and diverting the gas emitted by the cannon during firing was another necessary modification. The original split-flap airbrakes caused adverse changes in pitch trim and were quickly replaced by a single ventral <b>airbrake.</b> This meant, however, that the <b>airbrake</b> could not be used for landings.|$|E
5|$|The Victor {{has been}} {{described}} as an agile aircraft, atypical for a large bomber aircraft; in 1958, a Victor had performed several loops and a barrel roll during practices for a display flight at Farnborough Airshow. Manoeuvrability was greatly enabled by the light controls, quick response of the aircraft, and the design of certain flight surfaces such as the infinitely-variable tail-mounted <b>airbrake.</b> The Victor was designed for flight at high subsonic speeds, although multiple instances have occurred in which the sound barrier was broken. During development of the Victor B.2, the RAF had stressed the concept of tactical manoeuvrability, which led to much effort in development being given to increasing the aircraft's height and range performance.|$|E
25|$|The {{undercarriage}} was conventional, with a nose skid, fixed monowheel {{and tail}} bumper. A simple-friction wheelbrake {{is applied to}} the mainwheel by pulling on the <b>airbrake</b> lever {{at the end of its}} furthest travel.|$|E
40|$|The <b>airbrakes</b> {{are part}} of high {{performance}} aircraft and its location is arrived at based on wind tunnel experiments and in actual practice it is a compromise between the x 2018;desiredx 2019; location, which gives the least pitching moment and the best x 2018;availablex 2019; location on aircraft x 2018;near to the desired onex 2019;. The requirement is such that on deployment of <b>airbrakes</b> the drag should increase without any decrease in lift. If the <b>airbrakes</b> are not installed at the x 2018;desired locationsx 2019;, aircraft starts pitching up and x 2018;pitch upx 2019; increases with the airspeed. The x 2018;idealx 2019; requirement is that when <b>airbrakes</b> are deployed pilot {{should be able to}} concentrate on his mission without making an effort towards controlling the pitching moment. Thus, it is necessary to automatically compensate the pitch up tendency of the aircraft on deployment of <b>airbrakes,</b> and can be implemented in the Digital Flight Control Computer (DFCC) software. 13; This paper addresses the design of the automatic pitching moment compensation loop on deployment of <b>airbrakes.</b> The pitching moment compensation is implemented as a feed forward loop and hence, can be designed independent of the feedback control laws. It is very important to model all the nonlinearities related to the <b>airbrakes</b> very accurately, since the pitching moment compensation loop is in the feed forward path. Therefore, any delays or nonlinearities affect the performance significantly...|$|R

Had provision for an unguided rocket pack under each wing, elongated tailfin fillet, all-moving tailplane, third <b>airbrake</b> added behind the ventral fin. Vympel K-13 (AA-2 'Atoll') air-to-air missile (AAM) capability was added late in its service life; entered production in 1955.|$|E
25|$|Developed {{from the}} medium-range Tupolev Tu-104, the Tu-124 {{was meant to}} meet Aeroflot's {{requirement}} for a regional airliner to replace the Ilyushin Il-14 on domestic routes. Resembling a 75% scaled-down Tu-104, the two were hard to tell apart at a distance {{but it was not}} a complete copy of the Tu-104. The Tu-124 had a number of refinements, including double-slotted flaps, a large centre-section <b>airbrake</b> and automatic spoilers. Unlike the Tu-104, the wing trailing edge inboard of the undercarriage was unswept.|$|E

25|$|During flight testing, the Mosquito prototypes were {{modified}} {{to test a}} number of experimental configurations. W4050 was fitted with a turret behind the cockpit for drag tests, after which the idea was abandoned in July 1941. W4052 had {{the first version of}} the Youngman Frill <b>airbrake</b> fitted to the fighter prototype. The frill was mounted around the fuselage behind the wing and was opened by bellows and venturi effect to provide rapid deceleration during interceptions and was tested between January – August 1942, but was also abandoned when it was discovered that lowering the undercarriage had the same effect with less buffeting.|$|E
25|$|The Javelin was {{reportedly}} easy to fly even on one engine. The flight controls were fully power-assisted and production aircraft adopted a hydraulic 'feel' {{system for the}} pilot. The Javelin featured an infinitely variable airbrake; the <b>airbrake</b> proved to be extremely responsive and effective, allowing pilots to conduct rapid descents and heavy braking manoeuvres, enabling equally rapid landings to be performed. The turnaround time between sorties was significantly shorter than with the preceding Gloster Meteor, due to improved ground accessibility and engine ignition sequence. Unlike the Meteor, the Javelin was fitted with ejector seats, at the introduction to service of the type.|$|E
25|$|With 41 deposits, it {{was named}} 7X in November with first flight {{slipping}} from late 2004 to early 2005 and certification planned for mid-2006. With a simplified structure to reduce cost and weight, the optimised high-transonic wing improves by more than 10% the lift-to-drag ratio over the supercritical-section wing of the Falcon 50 shared by previous Falcons. The cabin is 2.4m (8ft) longer than the 900 and have a lower 6,000ft (1,800m) cabin altitude. the 6,100lb-thrust (21.7kN) PW307A was finally selected, among other risk-sharing partners: Honeywell for avionics architecture, auxiliary power unit, air management system; with Parker Hannifin for the power generation system and wheels brakes; and TRW Aeronautical Systems for the hydromechanical flap and <b>airbrake</b> systems.|$|E

25|$|Two prototypes of the Mü17 Merle {{were built}} with {{emphasis}} on simple construction, straightforward handling and easy rigging and de-rigging, using automatic connections for the aileron and <b>airbrake</b> controls. The plywood- and fabric-covered wooden wings are trapezoidal in plan view with swept leading edges and straight trailing edges, ailerons over the outer half of the trailing edges and spoilers mid-chord at approx half span. Adhering to the 'Schüle München' the fuselage is a welded steel-tube space-frame with fabric covering and wooden tail surfaces, also covered in plywood and fabric. Despite failing in the Olympic selection the Mü17 Merle was put into production with around 60 units built before and after World War II, many with variations such as retractable landing gear.|$|E
25|$|The Melmoth 2 {{was started}} in August 1981 as a {{composite}} follow-on to the complex Melmoth homebuilt. Initial fuselage lay-up was performed by Garrison along with engineer Burt Rutan and future private astronaut Mike Melvill, who also performed {{a fair number of}} the test flights. The aircraft is a single engine four-seat retractable tricycle gear low-wing with a T-tail arrangement. The rear seats face aft. The engine is cooled using updraft air which enters through a single inlet below the spinner and emerges {{from the top of the}} cowling near the spinner. A single <b>airbrake</b> panel opens under the fuselage. The tapered wings are equipped with large Fowler flaps. The original design has been modified with 45-degree sweep winglets and gear doors.|$|E
25|$|The Su-57 has a blended wing body {{fuselage}} and incorporates all-moving {{horizontal and}} vertical stabilizers; the vertical stabilizers toe inwards {{to serve as the}} aircraft's <b>airbrake.</b> The aircraft incorporates thrust vectoring and has adjustable leading edge vortex controllers (LEVCONs) designed to control vortices generated by the leading edge root extensions, and can provide trim and improve high angle of attack behaviour, including a quick stall recovery if the thrust vectoring system fails. The advanced flight control system and thrust vectoring nozzles make the aircraft departure resistant and highly maneuverable in both pitch and yaw, enabling the aircraft to perform very high angles of attack maneuvers such as the Pugachev's Cobra and the Bell maneuver, along with doing flat rotations with little altitude loss. The aircraft's high cruising speed and normal operating altitude is also expected to give it a significant kinematic advantage over prior generations of aircraft.|$|E

2500|$|The bridge can {{be raised}} to its full height of 135 feet in about a minute, and is raised about 5,000 times per year. [...] The span is about 390 feet (120 meters).

2500|$|The metal {{semi-monocoque}} fuselage had {{a forward}} section which contained the cockpit {{ahead of the}} wing leading edge but became markedly slimmer aft, in pod and boom style.

2500|$|British Aerospace {{promoted}} the BAe 146 to airlines as a [...] "feederliner" [...] and short-haul regional airliner. The airframe {{of the aircraft}} and many other key areas were designed to {{be as simple as}} possible. The engines lack thrust reversers due to their perceived reduced effectiveness in anticipated conditions. Instead, the BAe 146 features a large <b>airbrake</b> with two petals below the tail rudder {{at the rear of the}} fuselage, which has the advantage of being usable during flight and allowing for steep descent rates if required. In addition, the aircraft has full width wing spoilers which are deployed immediately on landing.|$|E
2500|$|The {{accident}} {{was determined to}} {{have been caused by}} a closed [...] "angle cock", a valve on the front and rear of all locomotives and rail cars used in the train's <b>airbrake</b> system, on the rear of the third car in the train. The handle of the angle cock had been improperly placed and had contacted the bottom of the car. Once it was closed the air brake pipe on all the cars behind the closed valve remained at full pressure, keeping the brakes released on those cars while the brakes on the locomotive and first three cars were applied in emergency.|$|E
50|$|The Ghoppia was a {{cantilever}} mid-wing monoplane. Its straight {{tapered wing}} {{was built in}} one piece for lightness around a single spar and had marked dihedral. The outer half of the wing's trailing edge carried ailerons mounted on a false spar; trailing edge <b>airbrakes</b> occupied the inner portion of the wingspan. These <b>airbrakes</b> {{turned out to be}} rather ineffective. The wing terminated in small tip bodies.|$|R
2500|$|It was an all-wood framed aircraft, skinned with {{a mixture}} of plywood and fabric. [...] High mounted wings were built around single spar with a ply covered D-box leading edge. Behind the spar the wings were largely fabric covered apart from an inboard section {{containing}} the CVV-type <b>airbrakes</b> which extended above and below the wing, where the ply skin reached aft to the trailing edge. There was also extra ply skinning inboard of the <b>airbrakes,</b> forward of the oblique, internal drag strut. Outboard of the <b>airbrakes</b> Frise ailerons formed the trailing edge out to rounded tips. In plan the wings were straight tapered, mostly on the trailing edge; they had 8.2° of washout and each could be detached separately for transport.|$|R
