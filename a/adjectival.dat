5|$|Mongolian {{allows for}} <b>adjectival</b> depictives {{that relate to}} either the subject or the direct object, e.g. Ljena nücgen untdag 'Lena sleeps naked', while <b>adjectival</b> resultatives are marginal.|$|E
5|$|Juno {{is named}} after the mythological Juno, the highest Roman goddess. The <b>adjectival</b> form is Junonian (jūnōnius).|$|E
5|$|Noun {{compounds}} {{are commonly}} formed by combining {{two or more}} nominal stems or combining a nominal stem with an <b>adjectival</b> or verbal stem.|$|E
5|$|In the 3rd century CE, {{when the}} army was removed, Legio became a city and its name was {{augmented}} with the <b>adjectival</b> Maximianopolis. The better accepted identification is that the site of Maximianopolis is {{at the location of}} modern-day Rummanah.|$|E
5|$|Quenya nouns are {{declined}} for case. Parmaquesta Quenya has ten cases. These {{include the}} four primary cases: nominative, accusative, genitive, and instrumental; three adverbial cases: allative (of which the dative is a shortened form), locative (also with a shortened form), and ablative; and a possessive or <b>adjectival</b> case. The accusative was however only used for Parmaquesta {{and had been}} replaced by nominative in late colloquial Quenya.|$|E
5|$|The common {{blackbird}} is {{the national}} bird of Sweden, which has a breeding population of 1–2 million pairs, and was featured on a 30öre Christmas postage stamp in 1970; it has also featured {{on a number of}} other stamps issued by European and Asian countries, including a 1966 4d British stamp and an 1998 Irish 30p stamp. This bird—arguably—also gives rise to the Serbian name for Kosovo, which is the possessive <b>adjectival</b> form of Serbian kos ("blackbird") as in Kosovo Polje ("Blackbird Field").|$|E
5|$|Compounding in Khmer is {{a common}} derivational process that takes two forms, {{coordinate}} compounds and repetitive compounds. Coordinate compounds join two unbound morphemes (independent words) of similar meaning to form a compound signifying a concept more general than either word alone. Coordinate compounds join either two nouns or two verbs. Repetitive compounds, {{one of the most}} productive derivational features of Khmer, use reduplication of an entire word to derive words whose meaning will depend on the class of the reduplicated word. A repetitive compound of a noun indicates plurality or generality while that of an <b>adjectival</b> verb could mean either an intensification or plurality.|$|E
25|$|In English morphology, -y is an <b>adjectival</b> suffix.|$|E
25|$|<b>Adjectival</b> participles {{decline as}} adjectives, while {{adverbial}} participles are not declined..|$|E
25|$|There {{were two}} types of {{adjectives}}: regular adjectives and <b>adjectival</b> nouns.|$|E
25|$|<b>Adjectival</b> participles {{have all}} the <b>adjectival</b> characteristics: three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter), pronominal forms, mostly {{identical}} declension and sometimes even degrees of comparison. Their primary function is to describe a nominal part of speech (usually a noun), like any adjective would in their position, hence they are matched by gender, case and number with the noun they are describing.|$|E
25|$|Na-adjectives (<b>adjectival</b> verbs) {{that end}} in -ka have okurigana from the ka.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two classes}} of <b>adjectival</b> nouns {{inherited}} from Early Middle Japanese: -nar and -tar.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} {{table lists}} the <b>adjectival</b> and demonymic forms {{of cities and}} towns in the U.S. State of Colorado.|$|E
25|$|It {{causes a}} chain of events in the two <b>adjectival</b> classes which {{eventually}} results in the two merging into one.|$|E
25|$|In Sanskritized and Persianized {{registers}} of Hindustani, comparative and superlative <b>adjectival</b> forms using suffixes {{derived from}} those languages can be found.|$|E
25|$|In this sense, cool {{is used as}} {{a general}} {{positive}} epithet or interjection, which can have a range of related <b>adjectival</b> meanings.|$|E
25|$|Some {{other forms}} having {{variations}} {{in a standard}} language: pė́sčias, pėsčià, pė́sčia – pedestrian, afoot; pėsčiàsis, pėsčióji and pėstỹsis, pėsčióji (<b>adjectival</b> and substantival meanings).|$|E
25|$|<b>Adjectival</b> surnames, {{like all}} Polish adjectives, have {{masculine}} and feminine forms. If a masculine surname ends in -i or -y; its feminine equivalent ends in -a.|$|E
25|$|Participles may {{be turned}} into adverbs or nouns by {{replacing}} the <b>adjectival</b> suffix -a with -e or -o. This means that, in Esperanto, some nouns may be inflected for tense.|$|E
25|$|Problematic point(s): the sufix {{that marks}} the possessive {{relationship}} is lost in the <b>adjectival</b> form, so the relationship is eventually unmarked, but the hyphen is still not used. For example, when Vác környéke ‘Vác environs’ becomes Vác környéki ‘of/from Vác environs’, the possessive-marker -e is lost, so it seemingly becomes analogous with the above Kaszpi-tengeri type. In addition, while names like Külső Pesti út (‘Outer Pest Road’) makes it obvious that külső {{is part of the}} name (rather than an occasional designation), the <b>adjectival</b> form Külső Pesti úti can only be given correctly with this knowledge.|$|E
25|$|Coin {{experts in}} Europe and {{elsewhere}} often shun the numerical system, preferring to rate specimens on a purely descriptive, or <b>adjectival,</b> scale. Nevertheless, most grading systems use similar terminology and values and remain mutually intelligible.|$|E
25|$|In German, some verbs {{can occur}} in <b>adjectival</b> resultative {{sentences}} while others cannot. In the example below, an argument {{can be made that}} the noun phrase after the verb can be interpreted as a verb argument.|$|E
25|$|Tethys {{is named}} after the titaness Tethys of Greek mythology. It is also {{designated}} SaturnIII or S III Tethys. The correct <b>adjectival</b> form of the moon's name is Tethyan, although other forms are also used.|$|E
25|$|If a {{geographical}} name consists of several elements whose relationship {{is marked by}} suffixes or postpositions, these elements are also written separately. The uppercase letter of the beginning element is kept even in an <b>adjectival</b> form.|$|E
25|$|For the {{specific}} epithet, the names {{can be converted}} into either <b>adjectival</b> form (adding -nus (m.), -na (f.), -num (n.) according to {{the gender of the}} genus name) or the genitive of the latinised name.|$|E
25|$|The moon {{is named}} after Hyperion, the Titan god of watchfulness and {{observation}} – the elder brother of Cronus, the Greek equivalent of Saturn – in Greek mythology. It is also designated SaturnVII. The <b>adjectival</b> form of the name is Hyperionian.|$|E
25|$|The <b>adjectival</b> determiners {{ending in}} -u have the usual dual {{function}} of adjectives: standing alone as proforms, as in ĉiu (everyone); and modifying a noun, as in ĉiu tago (every day). Those ending in -io are exclusively used standing alone: ĉio (everything).|$|E
25|$|Tabled below on {{the left}} are the {{paradigms}} for <b>adjectival</b> concord (A), here only slightly different from that introduced previously: the f. pl. can nasalize under certain conditions. To the right are the paradigms for personal concord (P), used by the subjunctive.|$|E
25|$|Pohnpeian {{distinguishes between}} in{{transitive}} and transitive verbs. Transitive verbs are those {{with both a}} subject and an object. Intransitive verbs indicate most other verbal, <b>adjectival,</b> and adverbial relationships. Within verb phrases, aspect markers are followed by adverbs, and lastly the main verb.|$|E
25|$|The term Hispanic {{derives from}} Latin Hispanicus ('Spanish'), the <b>adjectival</b> {{derivation}} of Latin (and Greek) Hispania ('Spain') and Hispanus/Hispanos ('Spaniard'), ultimately probably of Celtiberian origin. In English {{the word is}} attested from the 16th century (and in the late 19th century in American English).|$|E
25|$|Names {{of public}} spaces (roads, streets, squares, bridges etc.) are written {{separately}} (except for {{elements that are}} already compounds or hyphenated). Their first element is capitalized, and this capitalization is kept even in the <b>adjectival</b> forms, e.g. Váci utca ‘Váci Street’ and Váci utcai.|$|E
25|$|Sign {{languages}} convey much {{of their}} prosody through non-manual signs. Postures or movements of the body, head, eyebrows, eyes, cheeks, and mouth are used in various combinations to show several categories of information, including lexical distinction, grammatical structure, <b>adjectival</b> or adverbial content, and discourse functions.|$|E
25|$|Names of offices, social organizations, {{educational}} institutions, academic institutes, cooperatives, companies etc. {{are written}} capitalizing all elements except conjunctions and articles. In <b>adjectival</b> forms, only actual proper names and fancy names are left uppercase. For example, Országos Széchényi Könyvtár ‘National Széchényi Library’ vs. országos Széchényi könyvtári.|$|E
25|$|A resultative {{is either}} an <b>adjectival</b> phrase {{indicating}} {{the state of}} a noun resulting from {{the completion of the}} event denoted by the verb, or a verbal construction denoting the result state of an event. This verbal construction type of resultative is usually considered part of the field of aspect.|$|E
25|$|According to the Oxford English Dictionary, {{the correct}} {{spelling}} of the element is phosphorus. The word phosphorous is the <b>adjectival</b> {{form of the}} P3+ valence: so, just as sulfur forms sulfurous and sulfuric compounds, phosphorus forms phosphorous compounds (e.g., phosphorous acid) and P5+ valence phosphoric compounds (e.g., phosphoric acids and phosphates).|$|E
