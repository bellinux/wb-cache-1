5|$|Macdonald's {{more than}} 15 years as premier brought {{fundamental}} changes. Under his leadership, the Nova Scotia government {{spent more than}} $100million paving roads, building bridges, extending electrical transmission lines and improving public education. Macdonald dealt with the mass unemployment of the Great Depression by putting the jobless to work on highway projects. He felt direct government relief payments would weaken moral character, undermine self-respect <b>and</b> <b>discourage</b> personal initiative. However, he also faced the reality that the financially strapped Nova Scotia government {{could not afford to}} participate fully in federal relief programs that required matching contributions from the provinces.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{driven by}} the will to take revenge for the {{destruction}} of Palmyrene trade centers <b>and</b> <b>discourage</b> Shapur from initiating future attacks, Odaenathus launched an invasion against the Persians. In the spring of 262, the king marched north into the occupied Roman province of Mesopotamia, driving out the Persian garrisons and freeing Edessa and Carrhae. The first onslaught was aimed at Nisibis, which Odaenathus regained but sacked since the inhabitants were sympathetic toward the Persian occupation. The Palmyrene monarch destroyed the Jewish city of Nehardea, 45km west of the Persian capital Ctesiphon, as he deemed the Jews of Mesopotamia loyal to Shapur. By late 262 or early 263, Odaenathus stood at the walls of the Persian capital.|$|E
5|$|The French {{squadron}} {{had become}} disorganised in its initial pursuit the British, with Manche, under Captain Jean Dornal de Guy, falling substantially to leeward of the flagship. Seeing this, Stewart realised {{that the best}} hope his convoy had of survival was to unite and attack Manche together. The combined batteries of the East Indiamen could be deployed en masse, hopefully inflicting enough damage to drive Manche away <b>and</b> <b>discourage</b> Hamelin in Vénus from attacking alone. Signalling his intentions to the captains of Charlton and United Kingdom, Stewart turned towards Vénus and bore down on her. Hamelin, realising the threat his scattered squadron faced, signalled for his ships to join up. With the wind against him however, {{it was obvious that}} Windham would reach Manche first.|$|E

5|$|One {{animator}} {{was dedicated}} full-time during {{three years of}} the game's development to work out the boy's animations, including animations that showed anticipation on the player's actions or events in the game, such as reaching out for a cart handle as the player moved the boy near it. Jensen felt this was important as the character was always {{at the center of the}} player's screen, and the most important element to watch. Playdead included gruesome death sequences to highlight incorrect solutions <b>and</b> <b>discourage</b> players from repeating their mistakes. While they expected players to run the boy into numerous deaths while trying solutions, Carlsen stated that their goal was to ensure death wasn't a penalty in the game, and made the death animations entertaining to keep the player interested. Carlsen noted several early puzzles were too complex for the game, but they would end up using a portion of these larger puzzles in the final release.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade {{advanced}} {{across the}} river and established two bridgeheads. The first was across the bridge {{on the main road}} near Khirbet Hadrah (also referred to as Khurbet Hadra) and the second was at Sheik Muanis, near the mouth of the river. These operations had two aims– to gain territory <b>and</b> <b>discourage</b> the Ottoman Eighth Army from transferring troops into the Judean Hills to reinforce the Seventh Army. After successful actions by the New Zealand Mounted Brigade, two infantry battalions of the 54th (East Anglian) Division held these two bridgeheads on the northern bank until they were attacked by overwhelming forces on 25 November. The 3rd and 7th Divisions of the Ottoman Eighth Army had driven in the bridgeheads and restored the tactical situation.|$|E
5|$|With {{the onset}} of the Great Depression, Sampson worked to control {{government}} costs, but endorsed highway progression. A severe drought in 1930 left 86 of Kentucky's counties applying for federal aid. As unemployment in the eastern coal fields climbed to 40 percent, the United Mine Workers made their first inroads in the region. In 1931, mine owners began firing workers who joined the union. Many of these workers gathered in Evarts, Kentucky. The local sheriff added 26 deputies to his staff, helping enforce the blacklisting of these miners <b>and</b> <b>discourage</b> further organization. Union leaders petitioned Sampson to remove the sheriff and the county judge from office. Violent squabbles between striking union miners and local authorities began as early as mid-April 1931. On May 5, 1931, three guards and a miner were killed in a shootout that became known as the Battle of Evarts. Two days later, Sampson called in the National Guard to disarm both the mine guards and the union miners. All of the union's leaders were arrested, and the strike ultimately failed.|$|E

5|$|Free silver Democrats {{challenged}} Hunter's naturalization. It {{was finally}} concluded that Hunter, an Englishman, was naturalized under provisions {{of a federal}} law {{that allowed him to}} omit the standard preliminaries because of his service as a surgeon in the U.S. Army. Over the course of the contest, Hunter was also indicted for bribery, but was acquitted in short order for lack of evidence. Voting proceeded over several days, and demonstrators in the chamber galleries became disruptive in their support of various candidates. A Kentucky Post account from March 7, 1896, recorded that good-humored legislators began pelting each other with paper wads during the day's deliberations. This attempt at levity escalated until wrapped transcripts of the governor's message to the legislature were flying through the air. By March 11, tensions had reached the point that armed Democratic supporters were standing outside the state house in an attempt to intimidate Republican lawmakers <b>and</b> <b>discourage</b> them from entering. Attempts were made to unseat several legislators in the General Assembly, leading to threats of violence. Observers were banned from the gallery, and everyone entering the state house was searched for weapons.|$|E
5|$|Frogs {{are much}} more vocal, {{especially}} during the breeding season when they use their voices to attract mates. The presence of a particular species in an area may be more easily discerned by its characteristic call than by a fleeting glimpse of the animal itself. In most species, the sound is produced by expelling air from the lungs over the vocal cords into an air sac or sacs in the throat or {{at the corner of}} the mouth. This may distend like a balloon and acts as a resonator, helping to transfer the sound to the atmosphere, or the water at times when the animal is submerged. The main vocalisation is the male's loud advertisement call which seeks to both encourage a female to approach <b>and</b> <b>discourage</b> other males from intruding on its territory. This call is modified to a quieter courtship call on the approach of a female or to a more aggressive version if a male intruder draws near. Calling carries the risk of attracting predators and involves the expenditure of much energy. Other calls include those given by a female in response to the advertisement call and a release call given by a male or female during unwanted attempts at amplexus. When a frog is attacked, a distress or fright call is emitted, often resembling a scream. The usually nocturnal Cuban tree frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis) produces a rain call when there is rainfall during daylight hours.|$|E

25|$|All {{avoidance}} actions {{attempt to}} limit {{the risk of the}} legal system accelerating the financial demise of a financially unstable debtor who has not yet declared bankruptcy.

Avoidance actions {{are some of the most}} obvious of the mechanisms to encourage this goal.|$|E
25|$|Barnett et al. divides postconflict peacebuilding {{into three}} dimensions: {{stabilizing}} the post-conflict zone, restoring state institutions {{and dealing with}} social and economic issues. Activities within the first dimension reinforce state stability post-conflict <b>and</b> <b>discourage</b> former combatants from returning to war (disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, or DDR). Second dimension activities build state capacity to provide basic public goods and increase state legitimacy. Programs in the third dimension build a post-conflict society's ability to manage conflicts peacefully and promote socioeconomic development.|$|E

25|$|Streets in {{downtown}} follow a grid pattern. In residential areas of downtown, some neighbourhoods are traffic-calmed and include traffic circles at intersections {{to slow the}} speed of cars <b>and</b> <b>discourage</b> thoroughfare traffic. Northumberland Street and Odell Avenue have adopted speedbumps to slow fast moving traffic. The pattern of streets {{in the rest of}} the city varies including straight thoroughfares (such as Smythe Street, Prospect Street and Regent Street), to curved streets and cul-de-sacs in primarily residential areas.|$|E
25|$|Following Morgan's capture in {{the summer}} of 1863, there were no major engagements fought in Kentucky until spring of 1864. Portions of three {{infantry}} regiments from Bragg's army had requested to reorganize as a mounted infantry under Abraham Buford, but the Confederacy had no horses to supply them. In response, Nathan Bedford Forrest, who had been operating in Mississippi, began to organize a raid on western Tennessee and Kentucky. Besides obtaining mounts for the mounted-infantry-to-be, Forrest intended to disrupt Union supply lines, obtain general provisions for Confederate forces, <b>and</b> <b>discourage</b> enlistment of blacks in Kentucky into the Union army.|$|E
25|$|Each Nintendo 64 Game Pak {{contains}} a lockout chip (conceptually {{similar to the}} 10NES) to prevent manufacturers from creating unauthorized copies of games <b>and</b> <b>discourage</b> production of unlicensed games. Unlike previous versions, the N64 lockout chip {{contains a}} seed value {{which is used to}} calculate a checksum of the game's boot code. To discourage playing of copied games by piggybacking on a real Game Pak, Nintendo produced five different versions of the chip. During the boot process, and occasionally while the game is running, the N64 computes the checksum of the boot code and verifies it with the lockout chip in the Game Pak, failing to boot if the check fails.|$|E
