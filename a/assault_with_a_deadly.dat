25|$|The harm to a {{child from}} PCE has {{implications}} for public policy and law.

25|$|Mixon had an {{extensive}} criminal history. Beginning at age 13, {{he was arrested}} multiple times for battery, and by age 20 was serving a Corcoran state prison sentence following a felony conviction for <b>assault</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>deadly</b> weapon and armed robbery in San Francisco. After he was paroled, Mixon went {{in and out of}} prison. When the shootings happened, he was living in East Oakland at his grandmother's house and was wanted on a no-bail arrest warrant for violating his current parole conditions. On March 20, 2009, the day before the shootings, the Oakland Police Department learned that Mixon was linked by DNA to the February 5, 2009, rape of a twelve-year-old girl who was dragged off the street at gunpoint in the East Oakland neighborhood where Mixon's sister lived. On May 4, 2009, a state laboratory confirmed not just this link, but also confirmed that Mixon robbed and raped two young women about seven hours before the shootings (see above). Investigators said that Mixon may have committed several other rapes during recent months, although no convictions or indictments had been secured before his death. Had Mixon been arrested for his parole violation, he would have faced at most six months in prison; if convicted of rape, he faced a life sentence.|$|E
