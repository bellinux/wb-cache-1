40|$|The {{hat section}} used by {{certain of the}} {{aircraft}} companies has been quite widely accepted as the most efficient compression carrying member when stiffened by a sheet.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental investigation about the shear lag effects of tension steel members with welded connections. In total twenty tests were conducted, including twelve on single <b>angles</b> <b>and</b> eight on single tees. Various weld arrangements were considered as test parameters for the angle specimens which were connected by their short legs. For the tees, {{the influences of}} weld length and flange-to-web width ratio were studied. The test results showed that, the test efficiency, which {{is defined as the}} ratio of the ultimate capacity to the calculated tensile capacity of the gross section, can be increased when a balanced weld arrangement instead of an unbalanced one was employed for the angle specimens. For the tee specimens, the test efficiency was not sensitive to the weld length. In addition, increasing the flange-to-web width ratio could increase the test efficiency of the tees, although the improvement was not significant. Subsequently, design specifications for shear lag were examined, and the test-to-predicted ratios were presented. For more extensive comparisons, the ratios from an earlier investigation undertaken by the authors and co-workers and those from other researchers were also included for discussion. Finally, with the available database, reliability studies were undertaken to examine the resistance factors used in the current codes for predicting the ultimate tensile capacity of single <b>angles</b> <b>and</b> tee <b>sections,</b> <b>and</b> accordingly, new design recommendations are proposed.

Aiming at micro {{machining}} of 3 D microstructure of {{brittle materials}} {{with a novel}} tiny-grinding wheel based on the electro-magneto-rheological (EMR) effect, five conical tools with different cone angles are designed to reveal {{the effect of the}} cone angle on the machining characteristics. The distribution of the magnetic and electric fields in the polishing area is simulated using the finite element analysis software, and the machining experiments of micro groove were conducted to confirm the simulation results. Experimental results indicate that the material removal rate increases first and decreases afterwards with the increase of the cone <b>angle,</b> <b>and</b> the <b>section</b> width of micro groove increases but the section depth of micro groove shows a fluctuation phenomenon within a certain range. The intensities of the electric and magnetic fields on the tip of the conical tool with the 45 ° cone angle are at a larger level in the five tools, which is helpful to form a stable tiny-grinding wheel based on the EMR effect and obtain a better machining effect, so the tool with the 45 ° cone angle is an effective and ideal machining tool for the machining of 3 D microstructure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{magnetic}} resonance microscopy technique {{was developed to}} visualize and quantify the three-dimensional structure of snowpack. Because the NMR signal from the ice was very weak, {{we looked at the}} air space in the snow that was filled with dodecane doped with iron acetylaetonate. Four types of snow were tested: ice spheres, large rounded poly-crystals, small rounded mono-crystals and depth hoar crystals. Among these materials, the depth hoar crystals were the best for the test imaging, since they were sufficiently large and have anisotropic structures. A specific specimen-cooling system was developed to keep the temperature below 0 °C. In the experiments 0. 5 to 2 hours were necessary to accumulate the signals enough to obtain a 3 D micro-image; the image matrix 1283, voxel size 200 1 Jlll 3 or the image matrix 2563, voxel size 120 1 Jlll 3.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the dynamic pressure {{effects of a}} long duration blast load on small-diameter circular and angular structural steel members for a Mach stem region where a shock wave travels at near the speed of sound. In complicated flow fields, where fully coupled analyses are not reasonably practicable, the correct application of translational drag loads is vital. The variability in drag coefficient {{for members of the}} same shape can differ greatly owing to stagnation of the flow and the level of flow field obstruction. To investigate this effect, this paper details a simplified experimental trial conducted in the world’s most powerful blast tunnel, the US large-blast thermal simulator at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico. Four assemblies were examined based upon hollow steel sections mounted at different <b>angles</b> <b>and</b> positions. The experiment indicated a drop in drag coefficient for shielded circular members in close proximity of approximately 40 %. The drag force on unshielded sections was lower in magnitude than initially expected; this was attributed to an absence of flow stagnation and reduced boundary layer effects.
