By 2002, the bodies of five of the eight British victims had been identified through DNA testing.|$|E
50|$|The jodhpur boot is an <b>ankle</b> <b>boot</b> {{designed}} as a riding boot with a rounded toe and a low heel. They originally fastened with a strap and buckle, but today the term also includes designs with straps that do not wrap entirely around the ankle and the elastic-sided design without a strap also known as Chelsea boots. A closely related riding boot design is called a paddock boot, particularly if modified to have a lace-up front.|$|E

50|$|Ammunition boots, {{also known}} as <b>Boots,</b> <b>ankle,</b> General Service (BGS), were the {{standard}} footwear for the British Army from the late 1880s until the late 1950s. They replaced the earlier <b>ankle</b> <b>boots</b> {{that had been in}} service since the early 1800s.|$|R

50|$|Wellington's {{utilitarian}} new boots quickly {{caught on}} with patriotic British gentlemen eager to emulate their war hero. Considered fashionable and foppish {{in the best}} circles and worn by dandies, such as Beau Brummell, they remained the main fashion for men through the 1840s. In the 1850s they were more commonly made in the calf-high version, and in the 1860s they were both superseded by the <b>ankle</b> <b>boot,</b> except for riding. Wellington {{is one of the}} two British Prime Ministers to have given his name to an item of clothing, the other being Sir Anthony Eden (see Anthony Eden hat) whilst Sir Winston Churchill gave his name to a cigar.|$|E
5000|$|When first {{exhibited}} in 1874, {{under the title}} La Parisienne, the painting, {{like most of the}} other works on display that day, received mixed reviews; though most critics mentioned it in passing. French critic Ernest Chesneau described it as a 'failure'. Jean Prouvaire of Le Rappel expressed mixed sentiments about the painting:"The toe of her <b>ankle</b> <b>boot</b> is almost invisible, and peeps out like a little black mouse. Her hat is tilted over one ear and is daringly coquettish. Her dress does not reveal enough of her body. There is nothing more annoying than locked doors. Is the painting a portrait? It is to be feared so. The smile is false, and the face is a strong mixture of the old and the childish. But there is still something naïve about her. One gets the impression that this little lady is trying hard to look chaste. The dress which is extremely well painted, is a heavenly blue." ...|$|E
50|$|The British Army {{introduced}} the DMS (Direct Moulded Sole) <b>ankle</b> <b>boot</b> in 1958. This had a moulded plastic sole and was externally {{similar to the}} World War Two Ammo Boot. However, as the leather was of shoddy quality at best, the boots leaked {{and could not be}} made satisfactorily water-resistant. The low sideless tongue also allowed water to get in {{over the top of the}} foot. Once water had got into the boot, it would evaporate through the top of the boot but not through the plastic sole, thereby keeping the foot wet and accelerating trench-foot. Although mesh insoles were issued to combat this, they were themselves fragile and could lead to 'burning' of the sole of the foot, with the result that most soldiers used commercially available sports-shoe insoles instead. This type of boot continued in service until the mid-1980s, after its unsatisfactory characteristics became a matter of public concern owing to the severe cases of trench-foot incurred during the Falklands War. The DMS boot was worn with anklets or wind-around puttees.|$|E
50|$|These are {{the most}} widely worn style of fashion boots, usually under pants. <b>Ankle</b> <b>boots</b> are also the only type of fashion boot {{commonly}} worn by both men and women, {{and the only one}} to have remained popular without a break since the 19th Century.

5000|$|Until 1983, {{when the}} Dr Martens' largest {{producer}} licensed exclusive {{use of the}} brand from its Munich-based owners, White & Co shared the work of producing Dr. Martens-branded boots with companies including George Cox, NPS, GB Britton and Sons, Hawkins of Northampton ("Hawkins ASTRONAUT with Dr Martens air cushioned soles"), Earls Barton neighbours WJ Brookes, R Griggs Group (where the Airwear brand was registered) and Blundstone of Australia. 70% of White's 10,000 pair annual production was air-cushioned footwear in the early 90s, according to an interview with Management Today. White's best seller was a 4 eyelet gibson shoe, along with short production-runs of fashion styles and the classic 8 eyelet <b>ankle</b> <b>boot,</b> made on a rolling army last. To maintain independence White's registered the Tredair trade mark in 1976 to produce boots labelled [...] "Dr Martens Tredair", and then just [...] "Tredair" [...] after 1983, using their own patented foam-injection system to make a bouncier mid-sole than the DM felt. They filed patent 2292878B with Harry Gee as inventor. In 1990 White & Company (Earls Barton) Ltd. was awarded a Queens Award for Export Achievement after exporting 70% of production including Gripfast shoes, made by the same company and mainstream Goodyear-welted styles - similar to standard styles from Loake - and employing 380 people.|$|E
50|$|For many years, and unusually for an {{infantry}} unit, the Regiment {{wore the}} Denison parachute smock which it inherited from its predecessors, only adopting the 1968 pattern DPM combat jacket in the 1980s (which it issued {{into the new}} millennium, although the 1968 uniform actually became obsolete with Regular British Army regiments in the 1980s). At the time os amalgamation, the basic combat uniform worn under the Denison was composed of the Second World War-era green tropical shirt and trousers, ankle boots and puttees. Carrying equipment was initially the 1937 Pattern. By the early 1980s, these uniform items {{had been replaced by}} the green lightweight trousers, green shirt and sweater, 1968 Pattern combat jacket, high boots (otherwise identical to the old <b>ankle</b> <b>boot),</b> and the 1958 Pattern carrying equipment. Green shirts and lightweight combat trousers began to be supplemented by DPM tropical uniforms in the 1980s, and by the mid 1990s had been entirely replaced by them (although the green kit, like the Denison smocks, was handed down to the Regiment's Junior Leaders and to the Bermuda Cadet Corps, which continued to wear it). The tropical DPM uniform (worn in colder weather with the '68 Pattern Combat Jacket and the green pullover) was fully adopted by 1994, and continued to be issued for some time after its replacement in Britain by the Soldier 95 uniform. The beret worn is the dark blue one worn by the Royal Artillery and by various British Army units not authorised to wear distinctive colours of their own.|$|E

40|$|A solo {{exhibition}}. The exhibition {{opens with}} the five short texts of Le Lever, torn from a from an auction catalogue description of an engraving after a painting by Pierre-Antoine Baudouin, the son-in-law of Boucher, who, like his father-in-law, depicted the voluptuous eroticism of the ancien régime, transformed into chapters. The servant girl kneels before her mistress, holding her satin mule. Stuffed animals (aristocratic greedy squirrels who take everything from themselves, a mob of stoats, sporting Phrygian bonnets, cunning radical foxes who have read Marx) proliferate. In La Forme-valeur, Marx’s Capital is read, chapter three on exchange-value, {{in an attempt to}} find a woman speaking, yet all is found is an object speaking in the charming voice of a commodity in the chorus of goods going to market. Scent bottles (Allure and Chanel No. 5) might become Molotov cocktails, the material that may be soaked and ignited is French wedding tulle, which is rather expensive. The repetitive (and as the artist is the first to admit, dull and amateur) films of Mes coquetteries follow silk-clad bodies while a voiceover recalls the radio transmissions of the Resistance and from the Underworld via the car radio of Cocteau’s film Orphée. In Encore un effort a banner carries the breathless descriptions of the new fashions for 1968, when anything goes and details place the accent on this or that part of the body and its adornment: a pair of shoes that have come off in a struggle, for example, the heel of one snapped off; a checked shirt, with two buttons undone; a light-coloured trench coat (perfect for a May day); a blouson- style jacket that allows easy freedom of movement; pale casual slacks worn with an <b>ankle</b> <b>boot.</b> Beauty is in the streets as fashion becomes democratic (or so say the houses of haute couture), while the philosopher of the boudoir extorts us once again to take action.

50|$|By {{the turn}} of the 21st century (2000-2007 and 2017) and fashion boots in a variety of styles were back to the same level of ubiquity that they had enjoyed in the 1970s.

In 2009 thigh-length boots were a subject of major attention by the fashion press, receiving guarded approval and a level of mainstream acceptance that they had never previously achieved; this trend continued in 2010 and by the following year over-the-knee styles had become commonplace.
