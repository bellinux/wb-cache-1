5|$|Some {{predictions}} {{of general relativity}} differ significantly from those of classical physics, especially concerning the passage of time, the geometry of space, the motion of bodies in free fall, and the propagation of light.

The {{predictions of}} general relativity have been confirmed in <b>all</b> <b>observations</b> and experiments to date.

25|$|Charvaka's {{epistemological}} {{argument can}} be explained with the example of fire and smoke.

While this is often true, it need not be universally true, everywhere or all the times, stated the Charvaka scholars. Smoke can have other causes. In Charvaka epistemology, as long as the relation between two phenomena, or observation and truth, has not been proven as unconditional, it is an uncertain truth. Such methods of reasoning, that is jumping to conclusions or inference, is prone to flaw in this Indian philosophy. Charvakas further state that full knowledge is reached when we know <b>all</b> <b>observations,</b> all premises and all conditions. But the absence of conditions, state Charvakas, can not be established beyond doubt by perception, as some conditions may be hidden or escape our ability to observe. They acknowledge that every person relies on inference in daily life, but to them if we act uncritically, we err. While our inferences sometimes are true and lead to successful action, it is also a fact that sometimes inference is wrong and leads to error. Truth then, state Charvaka, is not an unfailing character of inference, truth is merely an accident of inference, and one that is separable. We must be skeptics, question what we know by inference, question our epistemology.|$|E

The study consisted of 88 healthy, unbroken, 2 -year-old mixed breed horses (primarily Quarter horse and draft type). Group 1 animals (n = 44) received MOS at the dose of 0. 6  mg per kg body weight administered orally at the time of castration then daily for two consecutive days. Group 2 animals (n = 44) received 0. 9 % saline at the dose of 1  mL per 25 -kg body weight administered orally at the time of castration then daily for two consecutive days. Animals were castrated on day 0 and observed for clinical signs of pain and inflammation for four (4) consecutive days. Pain behavior scores and visual analog scores were significantly greater in control animals over meloxicam-treated animals at <b>all</b> <b>observation</b> periods (P <. 05). The Stiffness Score at the time of leaving the chute was significantly different in control animals over meloxicam-treated animals at <b>all</b> <b>observation</b> periods (P <. 05).
