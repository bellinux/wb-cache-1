He organized a large display of his firearms at the Great Exhibition of 1851 at Hyde Park, London and ingratiated himself by presenting cased engraved Colt revolvers to such appropriate officials as Britain's Master General of the Ordnance. At one exhibit Colt disassembled ten guns and reassembled ten guns using different parts from different guns. As the world's leading proponent of mass production techniques, Colt went on to deliver a lecture on the subject to the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) in London. The membership rewarded his efforts by awarding him the Silver Telford Medal. With help from ICE secretary, Charles Manby, Colt established his London operation near Vauxhall Bridge on the Thames River and began production on January 1, 1853. On {{a tour of the}} factory, Charles Dickens was so impressed with the facilities that he recorded his favorable comments of Colt's revolvers in an 1852 edition of Household Words. The factory's machines mass-produced its parts that were completely interchangeable and could be put together on <b>assembly</b> <b>lines</b> using standardized patterns and gauges by unskilled labor as opposed to England's top gun makers making each part by hand. Colt's London factory remained in operation for only four years. Unwilling to alter his open-top single-action design for the solid frame double-action revolver that the British asked for; Colt scarcely sold 23,000 revolvers to the British Army and Navy. In 1856 he closed the London plant and had the machinery, tooling, and unfinished guns shipped to Hartford.|$|E

40|$|<b>Assembly</b> <b>Line</b> {{balancing}} (ALB) problems {{deal with}} the allocation of the tasks among workstations {{such a way that}} the precedence relations are not violated and a given objective function is optimized. It is a fundamental problem in continuous production line, and it is one of the difficult optimization problems. Installing <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> is a long-term decision and required high capital investments. Hence, it is very important to design the <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> and balance the workload on the workstations. The <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> has to be rebalanced periodically or if there is a change in the production plan or process. Based on the strategic goals of the manufacturers, the performance measures have to be carefully chosen, since balancing decisions have a long term effect. Due to the technological advancements, human workforce is replaced by robots to perform the tasks in an <b>assembly</b> <b>line.</b> Different robots with different capacity and specialization are available to perform the assembly task, hence it is required to choose the best fit robot among the available robots such a way that it helps in improving the productivity of the <b>assembly</b> <b>line.</b> Robotic <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> balancing (RALB) problem aims at assigning the tasks to workstation and allocate robot for each workstation in {{such a way that the}} productivity is improved. Very few researchers have proposed models for balancing a robotic <b>assembly</b> <b>line.</b> The main objective of this research is to develop efficient algorithms to solve robotic <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> balancing problems. RALB problem is NP-hard, since the basic version of <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> balancing problems falls under this category. To solve problem of this nature it is necessary to use metaheuristic algorithms. RALB problems with different objective functions are proposed and solved. The objectives considered for the RALB study are: minimizing cycle time, minimizing energy consumption, minimizing <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> cost and maximizing line efficiency of a robotic <b>assembly</b> <b>line.</b> Straight and U-shaped RALB problems are considered. The results obtained for the two <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> problems are compared. RALB problem with an objective of minimizing cycle time is solved using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and hybrid models of PSO and efficient metaheuristics. Two allocation procedures are used for allocating tasks and robots in the <b>assembly</b> <b>line.</b> PSO and its variants are the metaheuristics proposed to solve the RALB problem. PSO is also hybridized with Genetic Algorithm and Cuckoo search to solve RALB problem. Proposed algorithms are able to produce better results when compared with the benchmark results reported in the literature. Manufacturing industries give importance to the reduction of energy consumption due to the increase in energy cost and to create an eco-friendly environment. Due to the importance of reducing energy consumption in an <b>assembly</b> <b>line,</b> an energy based RALB problem is proposed. RALB problem with an objective of minimizing energy consumption for straight and U-shaped robotic <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> is proposed. Particle swarm optimization algorithm is the metaheuristic used to solve the proposed model. Cost reduction is one of the important tasks for the manufacturing companies throughout the world. In this thesis, a cost based RALB problem is also proposed. The objective considered in this problem is to minimize the <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> cost. Particle swarm optimization and Differential evolution algorithms are proposed to solve the problem. Straight and U-shaped robotic <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> problems are solved using the proposed algorithms and the results obtained are presented Since the investment in <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> is high, industries try to maximize their usage in the shortest time possible. Maximizing the line efficiency is another measure considered in this thesis. Particle swarm optimization and Differential evolution algorithms are proposed to solve this RALB problem. Line efficiency of both straight and U-shaped configuration of robotic <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> is compared. The research on RALB problem optimizing various performance measures considered reveals that U-shaped robotic <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> is better than straight robotic <b>assembly</b> <b>line...</b>|$|R
