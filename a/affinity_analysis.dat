This mecha-nismof localization {{is similar to}} that described for neuronal calcium sensors, which undergo calcium-dependent changes in conforma-tion, which modulate the availability of the acyl groups for mem-brane interaction and partner association. To test whether FCaBP undergoes a calcium-dependent conformational change and to explore the role of such a change in flagellar targeting,we first intro-duced point mutations into each of the two EF-hand calcium-bind-ing sites of FCaBP to define their <b>affinities.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of recombinant EF- 3 mutant (E 151 Q), EF- 4 mutant (E 188 Q), and double mutant proteins showed EF- 3 to be the high affinity site (Kd 9 M) and EF- 4 the low affinity site (Kd 120 M).

50|$|Kinetic {{capillary}} electrophoresis or KCE is {{capillary electrophoresis}} of molecules that interact during electrophoresis. KCE was introduced and developed by Professor Sergey Krylov and his research group at York University, Toronto, Canada. It {{serves as a}} conceptual platform for development of homogeneous chemical affinity methods for studies of molecular interactions (measurements of binding and rate constants) and affinity purification (purification of known molecules and search for unknown molecules). Different KCE methods are designed by varying initial and boundary conditions - the way interacting molecules enter and exit the capillary. Several KCE methods were described: non-equilibrium capillary electrophoresis of the equilibrium mixtures (NECEEM), sweeping capillary electrophoresis (SweepCE), plug-plug KCE (ppKCE). More detailed description and several applications of KCE methods (measuring equilibrium and rate constants of molecular interactions, quantitative <b>affinity</b> <b>analysis</b> of proteins, thermochemistry of protein-ligand interactions, selection of aptamers, determination of temperature inside a capillary) {{can be found in}} a PDF presentation: KCE ia a conceptual platform for kinetic homogeneous affinity methods.|$|E

40|$|Many {{systems in}} biology rely on binding of ligands to target {{proteins}} {{in a single}} high-affinity conformation with a favorable ΔG. Alternatively, interactions of ligands with protein regions that allow diffuse binding, distributed over multiple sites and conformations, can exhibit favorable ΔG because of their higher entropy. Diffuse binding may be biologically important for multidrug transporters and carrier proteins. A fine-grained computational method for numerical integration of total binding ΔG arising from diffuse regional interaction of a ligand in multiple conformations using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach is presented. This method yields a metric that quantifies the influence on overall ligand affinity of ligand binding to multiple, distinct sites within a protein binding region. This metric is essentially a measure of dispersion in equilibrium ligand binding and depends on both the number of potential sites of interaction {{and the distribution of}} their individual predicted <b>affinities.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of test cases indicates that, for some ligand/protein pairs involving transporters and carrier proteins, diffuse binding contributes greatly to total affinity, whereas in other cases the influence is modest.

The four MAbs showed {{differences in their}} affinity: two (HA 6, HA 9) of them were dominant after four rounds of panning, and showed higher affinity {{than the other two}} (HA 1, HA 12). All four MAbs showed HAV-neutralizing activity in radioimmunofocus inhibition assay and their neutralizing activity was positively correlated with their <b>affinities.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of their epitope specificity by cross-competition binding assays suggested that HA 6 and HA 9 recognize extensively overlapping epitopes, which overlap with those of HA 1 and HA 12, although HA 1 and HA 12 recognize distinct epitopes. In addition, competition assays with known neutralizing murine MAbs suggested that the epitopes of four human MAbs extensively overlap with those of B 5 B 3 and K 34 C 8 which are distinct but reside within the single, immunodominant neutralization site on the HAV capsid. The human MAbs (HA 6 and HA 9) with highest affinity may be useful in the immunoprophylaxis of HAV infection...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of Cu and Zn exposure, alone and in combination, on the {{bioaccumulation}} of Cd and Hg were investigated in an estuarine oyster Crassostrea hongkongensis under different salinity gradients. We showed that Zn, but not Cu, exposure significantly enhanced the Cd bioaccumulation. In contrast, both Cu and Zn exposure significantly enhanced the Hg bioaccumulation. Combined exposure and salinity {{did not affect the}} metal interactions in oysters. The increased tissue concentrations of Cd or Hg were associated with their increased storage in inducible metal-binding ligands (e. g. metallothionein-like proteins, MTLP) by Cu/Zn exposure.

40|$|AbstractThe {{potential}} of the common biosynthetic precursor of neurophysin and neuropeptide hormones to self-associate has been assessed by quantitative <b>affinity</b> chromatographic <b>analysis.</b> The precursor form, with the hormone sequence in the amino terminal region and assumed able to interact intramolecularly with the hormone binding site of the neurophysin domain of the folded precursor, exhibits an affinity for neurophysin-agarose which is intermediate between those of unliganded neurophysin and non-covalently hormone-liganded neurophysin. The results lead to a prediction that neurophysin self-association is established upon precursor synthesis and prior to limited proteolysis of the precursor to release mature neurophysin and hormone components.

40|$|International audienceA well-preserved fossil talus [National Museum of Myanmar Primates (NMMP) 82] of a large-bodied primate is {{described}} {{from the late}} middle Eocene Pondaung Formation of central Myanmar. The specimen was collected at Thandaung Kyitchaung, a well-known amphipithecid primate-bearing locality {{near the village of}} Mogaung. NMMP 82 adds to a meager but growing sample of postcranial remains documenting the large-bodied primates of the Pondaung Formation. This new talus exhibits a suite of features that resemble conditions found in living and fossil haplorhine primates, notably anthropoids. As such, the phylogenetic signal deriving from the morphology of NMMP 82 conflicts with that provided by NMMP 20, a partial skeleton (including a fragmentary calcaneus) of a second large-bodied Pondaung primate showing undoubted adapiform <b>affinities.</b> <b>Analysis</b> subtalar joint compatibility in a hypothetical NMMP 82 /NMMP 20 combination (talus/calcaneus) reveals a substantial degree of functional mismatch between these two tarsal bones. The functional incongruence in subtalar joint morphology between NMMP 20 and NMMP 82 is consistent with the seemingly divergent phylogenetic affinities of these specimens, indicating that two higher level taxa of relatively large-bodied primates are documented in the Pondaung Formation. On the basis of its size and morphology, we refer the NMMP 82 talus to the large-bodied amphipithecid Pondaungia. The occurrence of anthropoid-like tali in the Pondaung Formation obviates the need to invoke homoplasy to explain the shared, derived dental characters that are common to amphipithecids and undoubted anthropoids. Functionally, the NMMP 82 talus appears to have pertained to a primate that is engaged in active quadrupedalism in an arboreal environment along broad and subhorizontal branches.
