Despite these efforts, 35 per cent of women in the labour force remain unemployed and the majority have university degrees. Evidence suggests that there are considerable barriers to Nitaqat initiatives in the form of legal restrictions on women‟s employment, cultural norms, economic influence and relevant skills. Therefore, this study aims to identify, explore and analyse the political, economic, legal, social and cultural factors that impact on Saudi women's low labour force participation rate, particularly in the multinational sector...|$|R
