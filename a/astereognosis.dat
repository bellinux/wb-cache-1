50|$|<b>Astereognosis</b> (or {{tactile agnosia}} {{if only one}} hand is affected) is the {{inability}} to identify an object by active touch of the hands without other sensory input, such as visual or sensory information. An individual with <b>astereognosis</b> is unable to identify objects by handling them, despite intact elementary tactile, proprioceptive, and thermal sensation. With the absence of vision (i.e. eyes closed), an individual with <b>astereognosis</b> is unable to identify what is placed in their hand based on cues such as texture, size, spatial properties, and temperature. As opposed to agnosia, when the object is observed visually, one {{should be able to}} successfully identify the object.|$|E
50|$|<b>Astereognosis</b> is {{the failure}} to {{identify}} or recognize objects by palpation {{in the absence of}} visual or auditory information, even though tactile, proprioceptive, and thermal sensations may be unaffected. It may be caused by disease of the sensory cortex or posterior columns. People suffering from Alzheimers disease show a reduction in stereognosis. <b>Astereognosis</b> can be caused by damage to the posterior association areas of the parietal, temporal, or occipital lobes, or the postcentral gyrus of either hemisphere. For other types of dementia, stereognosis does not appear to decline.|$|E
50|$|Damage to the {{superior}} parietal lobule can cause contralateral <b>astereognosis</b> and hemispatial neglect. It is {{also associated with}} deficits on tests involving the manipulation and rearrangement of information in working memory, but not on working memory tests requiring only rehearsal and retrieval processes.|$|E
50|$|For example, if {{your dog}} lightly presses its nose on your leg, mechanoreceptors in your skin will sense the smooth texture of your dog’s nose whereas thermoreceptors will detect its coldness. When a dog bites someone, nociceptors detect the sharp pressure. <b>Astereognosis</b> is the {{inability}} to identify an object by touch.|$|E
50|$|<b>Astereognosis</b> is {{associated}} with lesions of the parietal lobe or dorsal column or parieto-temporo-occipital lobe (posterior association areas) of either the right or left hemisphere of the cerebral cortex. Despite cross-talk between the dorsal and ventral cortices, fMRI results suggest that those with ventral cortex damage are less sensitive to object 3D structure than those with dorsal cortex damage. Unlike the ventral cortex, the dorsal cortex can compute object representations. Thus, those with object recognition impairments {{are more likely to}} have acquired damage to the dorsal cortex. Those suffering from Alzheimer’s disease show a reduction in stereognosis, the ability to perceive and recognize the form of an object in the absence of visual and auditory information. This supports the notion that <b>astereognosis</b> appears to be an associative disorder in which the connections between tactile information and memory is disturbed.|$|E
50|$|Lesions {{affecting}} the primary somatosensory cortex produce characteristic symptoms including: agraphesthesia, astereognosia, hemihypesthesia, {{and loss of}} vibration, proprioception and fine touch (because the third-order neuron of the medial-lemniscal pathway cannot synapse in the cortex). It can also produce hemineglect, if it affects the non-dominant hemisphere. Destruction of brodmann area 3, 1, and 2 results in contralateral hemihypesthesia and <b>astereognosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{significant}} {{relationship has been}} found between agraphesthesia and people living with Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's patients typically experience the lack of sensation in both their dominant and non-dominant hands. <b>Astereognosis,</b> the inability to identify a physical object solely by touch, is commonly found in conjunction with agraphesthesia in Alzheimer's patients. Some research suggest that agraphesthesia {{can be used to}} track the cognitive decline in Alzheimer's patients once the disease is diagnosed.|$|E
50|$|Agnosia is the {{inability}} to recognize certain objects, persons or sounds. Agnosia is typically caused by damage to the brain (most commonly in the occipital or parietal lobes) or from a neurological disorder. Treatments {{vary depending on the}} location and cause of the damage. Recovery is possible depending on the severity of the disorder and the severity of the damage to the brain. Many more specific types of agnosia diagnoses exist, including: associative visual agnosia, <b>astereognosis,</b> auditory agnosia, auditory verbal agnosia, prosopagnosia, simultanagnosia, topographical disorientation, visual agnosia etc.|$|E
50|$|The son of Maurice Delay, a {{successful}} surgeon and mayor of Bayonne, at age fourteen Delay earned a baccalaureate in philosophy. He studied medicine in Paris. After studying in hospitals for twenty years, especially {{the teaching of}} Pierre Janet and Georges Dumas, he turned to psychiatry. He also specialized in neurology at the Salpetriere. He wrote his doctoral thesis on <b>astereognosis</b> in 1935. He then undertook the study at the Sorbonne and in 1942 wrote his thesis on diseases of memory. He received degrees in medicine, literature, and philosophy.|$|E
50|$|The {{absence of}} {{proprioception}} or two-point tactile discrimination {{on one side}} of the body suggests injury to the contralateral side of the primary somatosensory cortex. However, depending on the extent of the injury, damage can range in loss of proprioception of an individual limb or the entire body. A deficit known as cortical <b>astereognosis</b> of the receptive type describes an inability to make use of tactile sensory information for identifying objects placed in the hand. For example, if this type of injury effects the hand region in the primary somatosensory cortex for one cerebral hemisphere, a patient with closed eyes cannot perceive the position of the fingers on the contralateral hand and will not be able to identify objects such as keys or a cell phone if they are placed into that hand.|$|E
50|$|Individuals with {{tactile agnosia}} {{may be able}} to {{identify}} the name, purpose, or origin of an object with their left hand but not their right, or vice versa, or both hands. <b>Astereognosis</b> refers specifically to those who lack tactile recognition in both hands. In the affected hand(s) they {{may be able to}} identify basic shapes such as pyramids and spheres (with abnormally high difficulty) but still not tactilely recognize common objects by easily recognizable and unique features such as a fork by its prongs (though the individual may report feeling a long, metal rod with multiple, pointy rods stemming off in uniform direction). These symptoms suggest that a very specific part of the brain is responsible for making the connections between tactile stimuli and functions/relationships of that stimuli, which, along with the relatively low impact this disorder has on a person's quality of life, helps explain the rarity of reports and research of individuals with tactile agnosia.|$|E
5000|$|From 1933 to 1937, Askenasy {{worked on}} his neurosurgical {{residency}} at the Hospital de la Pitie. He {{had the luxury of}} working under the direction of Professor Clovis Vincent, a legendary French neurosurgeon. He had the chance to work amongst many other renowned scientists and physicians during his residency, such as Gerard Guiot, P. Puech, Jean Talairach, Marcel David, and Count Thierry De Martel. All were heralded as neurosurgical leaders throughout France and the world for their scientific contributions. The field of neurosurgery began to grow during Askenasy’s tenure in France, with many neurologists and neurosurgeons paving the way in the development of surgical practices. During his residency, Askenasy discovered the use of sulphur amides followed by cystic lesion puncture to treat brain abscesses. This therapy avoided the need of an early surgical procedure to remove infected areas of the brain. It was considered the first minimally invasive surgical therapy technique used to treat brain abscesses, replacing the need of craniotomies to treat acute cerebrates. Sulfur amides revolutionized brain abscess therapy, and their use along with modern antibiotics is still being practiced today. Along with Professor Clovis Vincent and Marcel David, Askenasy described the association of brain tumors with psychiatric disease, and the associations of the vascular brain stem lesion with ataxia and <b>astereognosis.</b>|$|E
40|$|Nineteen {{patients}} with organic mercury poisoning were examined clinically and electrophysiological studies {{were carried out}} on their peripheral nerves. Four severely affected patients were disorientated, restless, and unable to speak. Vision was abnormal in nearly half the patients, usually consisting of gross constriction of visual fields with preservation of central acuity. Severe cerebellar abnormalities were present in most. Paraesthesiae were common. On sensory examination, all except three patients had {{one or more of the}} following abnormalities: reduced appreciation of pin prick peripherally, defective position sensation, abnormal two-point discrimination, <b>astereognosis.</b> Vibration sensation was normal in all. Despite these sensory findings no electrophysiological abnormality was demonstrated in the peripheral nerves. It is suggested that the sensory disturbances are predominantly or entirely due to damage to the central nervous system...|$|E
40|$|Introduction] Until a {{few years}} ago, {{prevailing}} views regarding the syndrome of the corpus callosum in man were based very largely on the studies of Akelaitis and his co-workers (Akelaitis et al. 1942; Akelaitis 1944). Using {{a wide variety of}} tests Akelaitis examined a series of more than two dozen patients with partial and complete surgical sections of the corpus callosum and anterior commissure and was unable to find any consistent neurological or psychological dysfunctions that could be reliably attributed to the commissural sections. Symptoms such as unilateral <b>astereognosis,</b> alexia, agraphia, ideo-motor apraxia (Sweet 1941), as well as apathy, amnesia, personality changes and related effects, that earlier had been ascribed to callosal lesions (Alpers and Grant 1931) seemed accordingly to be more properly explained in terms of the extracallosal cerebral damage that commonly accompanies lesions in the commissures. These Akelaitis reports in combination with confirmatory observations on absence of symptoms after callosum section in animals established the general doctrine of the 1940 's and 1950 's in which it was believed that behavioral deficits seen in connection with callosal lesions are best ascribed to associated brain damage (Bremer et al. 1956). Meanwhile, the discrepancy between the enormous size and strategic position of the corpus callosum {{on the one hand and}} the observed lack of any important functional disturbance following its complete surgical section on the other remained during this period one of the more puzzling enigmas of neurology...|$|E
40|$|Objetiva-se resgatar, considerando o seu valor histórico, um sinal semiológico descrito em 1931 por eminente neurologista do Rio de Janeiro, em parceria com um mestre da neurologia francesa. No artigo de Alajouanine e Akerman, intitulado "Atitude da mão em um surto monobraquial astereognósico da esclerose em placas", foi descrita uma alteração semiológica caracterizada por "uma instabilidade na atitude dos dedos, que se observa sobretudo com a mão estendida na atitude de juramento". Essa atitude da mão se exagerava muito com os olhos fechados e estava acompanhada por ataxia sensitiva, astereognosia e comprometimento da sensibilidade profunda no membro acometido. A partir do artigo original, é possível atualmente considerar-se a alteração semiológica descrita como uma forma de pseudoatetose localizada na mão. It {{is aimed}} to recover, {{considering}} its historical value, a semiological sign described in 1931 by an eminent neurologist of Rio de Janeiro, {{together with a}} master of the French neurology. In the article by Alajouanine and Akerman, named "Attitude of the hand in an astereognostic monobrachial crisis of multiple esclerosis", a semiologic alteration was described which was characterized by "an instability in the attitude of the fingers, which is observed mainly with the hand extended in the attitude of swearing". This attitude of the hand worsened a lot with the eyes closed and was accompanied by sensory ataxia, <b>astereognosis,</b> and impaired deep sensation in the affected member. From the original article, it is possible to consider at the present time the described semiologic alteration as a form of pseudoathetosis localized in the hand...|$|E
40|$|Detailed {{clinical}} sensory {{and motor}} signs were correlated {{case by case}} with somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) in 22 selected patients with a single circumscribed hemisphere lesion. The lesions collectively mapped out a variety of cerebral sites from the anterior frontal to the posterior parietal regions. SEPs were averaged from 8 standard scalp sites with an earlobe reference electrode, so that parietal N 20 -P 27 -P 45 were differentiated from prerolandic P 22 -N 30 SEP components. SEP wave forms to stimulation on the unaffected side served as the patient's own control. A complete parietal lesion produced contralateral hemianaesthesia without upper motor neuron signs and eliminated the parietal N 20 -P 27 -P 45 while the prerolandic P 22 -N 30 persisted at usual latencies. The neural generators for the N 20 and the P 22 components are thus distinct. It is also proposed that direct, short latency pathways convey somatosensory inputs to the motor cortex, independently of connections via parietal areas 2 and 5. Enhancement of P 22 -N 30 after chronic parietal lesions suggests collateral reinnervation by residual inputs after partial deafferentiation of prerolandic cortex. Small postcentral lesions produced <b>astereognosis</b> (with preserved tactile and deep sensation) and reduced or eliminated the N 20 and P 27 SEP components, but {{did not affect the}} P 22 -N 30 components. Precentral lesions with severe hemiplegia (but not prefrontal lesions) eliminated the prerolandic P 22 -N 30 SEP components and did not alter the parietal N 20 -P 27 -P 45 components. The data are pertinent {{to the understanding of the}} pathophysiology of somatosensory deficits and for the diagnostic use of SEPs in cerebral lesions. © 1983 Oxford University Press.
