In term of using the harvesting machinery operated by human, the principle of ergonomic should be applied to fulfill the goal of work productivity and ensure occupational health and safety. It is because, during its operation, there will be a potential hazard, caused by noise and vibration, to workers and the environment. This research was aimed to analyze the noise and vibration level of Saccof Harvester during its employment. It was expected that the time limit for the optimal use of the machine can be determined based on the available standard. Furthermore, the method to reduce the negative impacts of noise and vibration can also be identified. According to the research, it was revealed that the noise and vibration level which was received by operator exceeded the ambient level.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to predict profit level of UPJA.

The data determined description of UPJA management in the DIJ and then it was analyzed through technically, economically, and socially approached. Technical analysis indicated that tractor capacity was high, while thresher and RMU were low. Economical analysis indicated that tractor and thresher were in not economical, because the NPV was less than 0 and BCR was less than 1. Whereas on RMU there were two samples, that can achieve NPV more than 0, and BCR more than 1. Social analysis indicated that actually farmers received and needed the presence of the technology, although the appreciation on <b>agricultural</b> <b>machinery</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> service was still low. As a whole, UPJA activity had not been good and given benefit. It needed agricultural explanation more intensive to the farmer on importance of agrocultural mechanization.

40|$|In {{the present}} article — based on {{questionnaire}} research carried out in SGGW- -AR in 1987 — the author undertakes an attempt to distinguish the factors influencing the level of income from agricultural activity and to determine quantitative impact of these factors on the growth of income of a farm in different area groups. The selection of explanatory variables was based on correlation analysis and step regression. The research indicates that the income of a farm depends on the growth of production factors and relations between them, and on the efficiency of their exploitation. The basic factors shaping the income of a farm in all area groups are the cost of mineral fertilizers and lime {{as well as the}} value of basic flock and the rate of botanization of land. Additionally, in farms larger than 5 ha to these factors belong the value of <b>agricultural</b> <b>machinery</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> and the value of feeding stuff. Besides, it can be observed that in the growth of income the importance of land (area and quality), <b>agricultural</b> <b>machinery</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> and the expenses on feeding stuffs, energy, the value of basic flock and the number of full-time employees decreases with the increase in the area of a farm. The results indicate that in order to increase the income of a farm it is necessary to decrease gradually the resources of labour and to increase the area of a farm and its technical equipment with the simultaneous increase of outlays on turnover means (such as fertilizers and lime). At the same time the above conditions are indispensable for structural changes in the private sector of agricultureDigitalizacja i deponowanie archiwalnych zeszytów RPEiS sfinansowane przez MNiSW w ramach realizacji umowy nr 541 /P-DUN/ 201...|$|E

In response to disruptions and imbalances of power resulting from so vast a concentration of economic power, industrial workers organized the Congress of Industrial Organizations, a coherent agricultural cooperative movement, and the Progressive politics led by Wisconsin's Governor and Senator Robert M. La Follette Sr.. State universities, professional social work, and unemployment and workers' compensation were some of the region's permanent contributions to American social policy.|$|R
