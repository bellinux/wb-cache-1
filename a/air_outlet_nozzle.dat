40|$|The use of {{hyperbaric}} chambers {{prevailed in}} medical therapy for vascular diseases and for outbreaks of embolism in emergency situations. This implies {{the achievement of}} environmental pressure conditions from {{two to three times}} higher than the atmospheric one, {{in such a short time}} to require delivery of the air flow that leads to very high intensity noise. The attenuation of this noise is usually performed through the installation of silencers at the <b>air</b> <b>outlets.</b> In this work a series of noise measurements is presented, carried out inside the chamber, limited to the periods it is available to maintenance activities, in various conditions of the opening of the air inlet valve, with and without silencers mounted on the <b>air</b> <b>outlet</b> <b>nozzles</b> and with or without different layers of floor covering. In order to characterize the attenuation capacity of the silencers and to verify that the air flow is the most significant source of noise, a series of noise measurements is also presented, carried out in the open field while emptying a pressurized tank, in various conditions of opening of the exhaust valve, for different types of silencers placed at the outlet. The analysis of the frequency spectra allows to evaluate the behaviour of these devices, at the light of theoretical predictions concerning the aerodynamic noise. The results suggest that the optimization of some of the flow parameters and the operating conditions of the chamber can contribute significantly to the reduction of noise, with a consequent net improvement of such device, in particular under operating conditions of emergency...|$|R

The steady state PEMFC operation has been taken into account. The model of the PEMFC system used in the work is based on a moving least squares technique. A centrifugal compressor has been taken into account, and the operating line of the compressor has been evaluated for an optimal fixed opening of the <b>outlet</b> <b>nozzle.</b> A multi-level optimization procedure has been implemented to solve the optimization problem. The developed algorithm is useful to design an optimum air subsystem, reducing the number of the control variables and the consequences of the dynamic behavior of a controlled electric adjustable valve on the PEMFC performance.

40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} was carried out, using {{standard}} techniques, to identify and count the bacterial contamination of hand air dryers, used in washrooms. Bacteria were isolated from the <b>air</b> flow, <b>outlet</b> <b>nozzle</b> of warm <b>air</b> dryers in fifteen air dryers used in these washrooms. Bacteria {{were found to be}} relatively numerous in the air flows. Bacterially contaminated air was found to be emitted whenever a warm air dryer was running, even when not being used for hand drying. Our investigation shows that Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas alcaligenes, Bacillus cereus and Brevundimonad diminuta/vesicularis were emitted from all of the dryers sampled, with 95 % showing evidence of the presence of the potential pathogen S. haemolyticus. It is concluded that hot air dryers can deposit pathogenic bacteria onto the hands and body of users. Bacteria are distributed into the general environment whenever dryers are running and could be inhaled by users and none-users alike.

Appropriate modeling of complicated behavior induced by a multi-dimensional flow {{is important for the}} reactor safety analysis results. SPACE, a safety analysis code for thermal hydraulic systems which is currently being developed, was designed to have the capacity of multi-dimensional two-phase thermo-dynamic phenomena induced in the various phases of a nuclear system. To validate the performance of SPACE, a two-dimensional two-phase flow test was performed with slab geometry of the test section having a scale of 1. 43 m × 1. 43 m × 0. 11 m. The test section has three inlet and three <b>outlet</b> <b>nozzles</b> on the bottom and top gap walls, respectively, and two <b>outlet</b> <b>nozzles</b> installed directly {{on the surface of the}} slab. Various kinds of two-dimensional air/water flows were simulated by selecting combinations of the inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>nozzles.</b> In this study, two-dimensional two-phase void fraction profiles were quantified by measuring the local gap impedance at 225 points. The flow conditions cover various flow regimes by controlling the flow rate at the inlet boundary. For each selected inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>nozzle</b> combination, the water flow rate ranged from 2 to 20 kg/s, and the air flow rate ranged from 2. 0 to 20 g/s, which corresponds to 0. 4 to 4 m/s and 0. 2 to 2. 3 m/s of the superficial liquid and gas velocities based on the inlet port area, respectively...|$|R

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{contribution}} is to investigate problems connected with the application of plain water jets in surroundings between jet outlet and target differing from standard atmosphere. Two cases are especially interesting from the practical viewpoint. Application of water jets under the water level, i. e., in pressurized water: it is sometimes necessary to perform certain reparations on dam walls, bridge pillars, and other structures under the water level without emptying the dam or changing the river flow. The second case particularly involves water jets used for cleaning of chemical or radioactive facilities, which is much safer if done in underpressure. By these reasons, behavior of plain water jets on several different rock materials was tested inside the pressure vessel with the application of normal air pressure, air underpressure, and water overpressure. The effectiveness of rock material disintegration by water jet in various environmental conditions has been described. The depth of penetration decreases with increasing water overpressure, approximately with the second degree of the overpressure value. The cut depth decreases with the increasing value of certain material characteristics. The cut depth decreases also with decreasing pressure of <b>air</b> between <b>nozzle</b> <b>outlet</b> and sample surface. The dependence seems to be linear within the experimental range.

The next chapter explains the processes that take place when liquid state LPG is injected into the air flow of an internal combustion engine intake manifold. A simplified calculation is used to show that the injection of liquid state LPG is associated with extreme low temperature of the LPG injected into intake manifold and with ice formation on the <b>outlet</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The article sets out the design of an end part injector (EPI) for liquid state LPG that reduces the risk of icing of the <b>outlet</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The results of experimental research indicate very good operational properties for a vehicle SI engine with the combustion mixture formed by the injection of liquid state LPG into the engine intake manifold.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} these two major topics. The first part id {{describing}} flowing through the distribution pipe during the pressure pulse. In the second one the most effective cleaning device configuration and venturi shape are selected. Finally the results of experiments were proofed in the field test. A criterion for uniform distribution of pressurized air along the distribution pipe resulting from condition of constant momentums of the airflow at the outlet from the distribution pipe has been derived. This criterion uses <b>outlet</b> <b>nozzle</b> cross-sections and static pressures in the pipe at the nozzles. Based on this criterion a relation which enables to design <b>outlet</b> <b>nozzle</b> diameters only from pipe and nominal nozzle diameter has been derived as well. The consumption of pressurized air as an important value for evaluation of the overall cleaning efficiency of the whole filter has been calculated for 1 pulse. Derived formula can be used easily in the field since the tank pressure is usually measured. A mathematical model describing air flow through the pipe has been set together. The model results from basic Bernoullis equation and equation of continuity. All necessary quantities (velocity, pressure, temperature and density) along the distribution pipe can be computed during the pressure pulse. Air flows through the <b>outlet</b> <b>nozzles</b> and pressurised <b>air</b> consumption can be calculated from these values. Very good agreement between calculated and experimentally measured values has been achieved. Twelve basic venturi shapes and six displacements between <b>outlet</b> <b>nozzle</b> and venturi were tested. For comparison of results an evaluation system was put together. The system is based on 6 criteria describing an efficient pressure pulse along the bag. The initial set of test was carried out without dust feeding. A gross selection was done. Followingly 4 selected venturis and 3 displacements were measured at conditions simulating a real operation, i. e. fan was in operation and dust was fed. Based on these tests the cleaning device configuration showing the most effective pulse was selected. The selected venturis were applied on the real fabric filter. The states {{before and after the}} retrofit were recorded. The pressurised air consumption, pressure drop and boiler steam production were calculated.

Two options were suggested: the normal head option uses 16. 0 mm <b>outlet</b> <b>nozzles</b> and maintains the 500 mm tundish level, while the high head option uses 14. 8 mm <b>outlet</b> <b>nozzles</b> and raises the depth of liquid steel within the tundish to 800 mm. The important effects of flow control devices on the hydrodynamic performance of the tundish were also tested, using {{two different types of}} flow modifiers: Impact Pad and Turbo-Stop.

Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) was used to visualize the actual instantaneous, or momentary, flows, thereby providing the data needed for time averaged velocity fields and turbulent kinetic energies. A mathematical model based on METFLO was developed to simulate these tundish operations numerically. The Renormalization Group turbulence model (RNG) as well as the standard high Reynolds number k-s turbulence model (STD) was implemented in order to simulate the turbulent flows within the tundish.
