25|$|Among <b>American</b> <b>adolescents,</b> {{baseball}} {{metaphors for}} sex {{are often used}} as euphemisms for the degree of physical intimacy achieved in sexual encounters or relationships. In the metaphor, first prevalent {{in the aftermath of}} World War II, sexual activities are described as if they are actions in a game of baseball.|$|E
25|$|Sexual {{abstinence}} is {{the practice}} of refraining from some or all aspects of sexual activity for medical, psychological, legal, social, financial, philosophical, moral or religious reasons. For the last twenty years, abstinence rates among <b>American</b> <b>adolescents</b> have risen. The percentage {{of high school students}} in the US who reported that they have ever had sexual intercourse dropped from 54.1% in 1991 to 47.8% in 2007 and to 43% in 2011. A cross-sectional survey in 1998 found that fear of pregnancy was the most commonly cited reason for choosing abstinence, especially among girls, as well as boys who had caused a pregnancy in the past. Other reasons included a fear of sexually transmitted infections, a lack of desire, being afraid of getting caught, and the belief that sex was not appropriate for someone of their age.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{studies have}} {{analyzed}} the changing attitudes about sex that <b>American</b> <b>adolescents</b> have outside marriage. [...] Adolescents {{were asked how}} they felt about oral and vaginal sex in relation to their health, social, and emotional well-being. [...] Overall, teenagers felt that oral sex was viewed as more socially positive amongst their demographic. Results stated that teenagers believed that oral sex for dating and non-dating adolescents was less threatening to their overall values and beliefs than vaginal sex was. When asked, teenagers who participated in the research viewed oral sex as more acceptable to their peers, and their personal values than vaginal sex.|$|E
2500|$|A study {{performed}} at the University of Texas at Austin examined over 9,000 <b>American</b> <b>adolescents</b> to determine how their engagement in problematic behavior (such as stealing, fighting, and truancy) was related to their friendships. Findings indicated that adolescents {{were less likely to}} engage in problem behavior when their friends did well in school, participated in school activities, avoided drinking, and had good mental health. The opposite was found regarding adolescents who did engage in problematic behavior. Whether adolescents were influenced by their friends to engage in problem behavior depended on how much they were exposed to those friends, and whether they and their friendship groups [...] "fit in" [...] at school.|$|E
2500|$|Because {{exposure}} to media has {{increased over the}} past decade, adolescents' utilization of computers, cell phones, stereos and televisions {{to gain access to}} various mediums of popular culture has also increased. Almost all American households have at least one television, more than three-quarters of all adolescents' homes have access to the Internet, and more than 90% of <b>American</b> <b>adolescents</b> use the Internet at least occasionally. [...] As a result of the amount of time adolescents spend using these devices, their total media exposure is high. In the last decade, {{the amount of time that}} adolescents spend on the computer has greatly increased. Online activities with the highest rates of use among adolescents are video games (78% of adolescents), email (73%), instant messaging (68%), social networking sites (65%), news sources (63%), music (59%), and videos (57%).|$|E
40|$|Obesity and {{overweight}} disproportionately impact Black <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> females—placing them at {{a lifetime}} of elevated physical health risks. Despite this burden, the literature that explores the contributors to obesity and overweight among Black <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> females remains limited and unclear. This dissertation aims to develop knowledge related to obesity and overweight in Black <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> females, by appraising the current understanding of {{factors that contribute to}} their obesity and overweight, and explicating the everyday social influences on dietary practices. The primary study conducted for this dissertation used a mixed method, multiple case study design to examine the mother, daughter, and other household contributors to Black <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> daughters’ everyday practices of food consumption, acquisition, preparation, and planning. Findings reveal the importance of understanding the complex and dynamic ways mothers and other household members contribute to a holistic view of everyday dietary practices among adolescent daughters. By deeply examining the nuanced ways the multiple cases varied, context-dependent knowledge essential to understanding the complicated health challenge of obesity was produced. Subsequently, recommendations are provided for health providers and scholars to more holistically approach and examine obesity—particularly among populations who are disproportionately affected.

40|$|African <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> females aged 13 to 19 {{are among}} the fastest growing populations of new HIV infections, and those with mental {{illnesses}} are also at risk. Within this demographic, depressive symptoms have correlated with HIV risk-related sexual behaviors (HRRSB) including inconsistent condom use, multiple sexual partners, and early sexual debut. Little is known however, about underlying constructs resulting in HRRSB among clinically depressed African <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> females who seek mental health services, or about the links between depression and specific behavioral risks within this group. Guided by the Theory of Planned Behavior, {{the purpose of this}} sequential exploratory mixed methods research (QUAL→QUAN) was to develop {{a better understanding of the}} context of sexual risk for HIV among clinically depressed African <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> females. African <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> females (N = 128, 13 - 19 years old) were recruited from outpatient mental health facilities and complimentary settings in the Hampton, Virginia and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania metropolitan areas to participate in individual interviews and/or anonymous surveys. The results indicate that the psychopathology of depression (i. e. low self-esteem, hopelessness, guilt, etc.) may create situations where clinically depressed African <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> females could become exposed to HIV. Participants recounted stories of how through fear of abandonment and the search for attention and emotional release, the inclination to acquiesce to one 2 ̆ 7 s partners demands (i. e. noncondom use, engaging in undesired sexual activity, etc.) is increased. Empirically, depression severity is a significant determinant of HRRSB including early sexual debut, inconsistent condom use, not inquiring about partners HIV status and engaging in sexual activity under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol. The condition is also a moderator of the relationship between adolescents 2 ̆ 7 beliefs and intentions, and condom use at last sex. The results of this study have the potential to directly guide the modification and/or development of HIV prevention programs by providing explicit, psychologically and culturally relevant information regarding the interaction between depression and sexual risk for HIV among clinically depressed African <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> females. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: It is {{not clear}} whether the decline in African <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> smoking in the 1980 s {{reflected}} a delay in age of onset of regular smoking initiation rather than success in preventing initiation completely. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify whether the marked reductions in African <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> smoking in the 1980 s were offset by increased initiation in young adults. Methods: We combined data from the Tobacco Use Supplements of the 1992 - 1993, 1995 - 1996, and 1998 - 1999 Current Population Surveys (n = 512, 258), and reconstructed year of smoking initiation and calculated age-specific incidence of initiation from 1970 to 1992. We then compared detailed age-specific rates of initiation for two 5 -year periods selected to be before and after the documented large declines in African <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> smoking. Results: In the time period after marked declines in African <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> smoking (1987 - 1991), the incidence of initiation of regular smoking decreased for African Americans ages 14 to 16 and increased for ages 18 to 20. Such a delay was not as evident among non-Hispanic Whites. The delay that was slight in regular smoking initiation among African Americans relative to non-Hispanic Whites in 1975 - 79 had increased substantially by 1987 - 91. Conclusions: Reductions in African <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> smoking in the 1980 s were offset by increased initiation among young adults ages 18 to 20 during this time period and suggest that the window for uptake of regular smoking shifted to older ages for African Americans more so than non-Hispanic Whites. Efforts to combat smoking should remain aggressive into young adulthood, when the tobacco industry's efforts to gain new smokers intensify...|$|R

40|$|The life {{circumstances}} facing African <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> {{males are}} reported {{with a fair}} amount of frequency by numerous media outlets in our society. Reports generally communicate negative circumstances facing African <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> males in the educational, economic, social, and political arenas. These sorts of life experiences have the potential to have a tremendous impact on the lives and development, particularly identity developmental process of young African American men; however, few research efforts have been devoted to specifically exploring the identity development process of African <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> males. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to examine the meaning of being a young African American man and to explore how the types of experiences and socialization messages contribute to the perception of being a young African American man. A series of focus groups were conducted with African <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> males aged 14 - 18 (N= 17). Participants were asked questions about what comes to mind when they think about African American young men, when was the first time that they realized that they were African American, and what do others think about African Americans. Several themes emerged from this investigation including, lives consistently filled with struggle, an appreciation for the history of struggle and sacrifice by African Americans, early encounter experiences that made participants aware of their Blackness, and negative stereotypes and perceptions of young African American men.

40|$|In this phenomenological study, I {{explore the}} lived {{experience}} of African <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> girl poets {{in an organized}} poetry group in their school. My research question unfolds, "What is the lived experience of writing poetry to uncover the power for African <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> girls to name who they really are?" My exploration calls upon the works of such phenomenologists as Edward Casey, John O'Donohue, Michael D. Levin and Martin Heidegger. My study is further augmented by Black feminists scholars and writers such as Patricia Hill Collins, Alice Walker and Zora Neale Hurston. Furthermore, Max van Manen provides a research guide pedagogically on this journey, alongside culturally responsive educators such as Gloria Ladson Billings and Jacqueline Jordan Irvine. The paths, thoughts, and meanings of phenomenology and poetry danced through, between and alongside one another. 	 		 Poetic Eight is what the African <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> poets of my study have named themselves. The eight poets' names are brought forth by their external identities, lived experiences and cultural collective as African <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> girls. And while these identities and names offer some insight into who these girl poets are, the girls, themselves, reveal who they are through their writing and voices. Through {{the process of writing}} and weaving between concealing and revealing, individually and collectively, identities begin to unfold. As each participant begins to reveal her poetic identity (ies) and lived experiences, themes quickly emerge around grief, loss, naming as I Am, love and divinity. Finally, I offer poetic and pedagogical insights into the lived experience of writing poetry for African <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> girl poets to uncover and maintain their power through naming. These insights and suggestions are concluded with my own poetic reflections. As an educator, igniting poetic voices for listeners and readers occurs through a process of unraveling and writing renderings with the intention of embodying the hope, joy, rage and love that the poets have spilled onto the pages, as they read in the group in earnestness and conviction...|$|R

40|$|Background: Although it is {{recognized}} that African Americans experience racial discrimination, relatively {{little research has}} explored the health implications of this experience. Few {{studies have examined the}} relationship between racial discrimination and specific health risks. Objectives: To examine the relationship between smoking habits and perceptions of racial discrimination among African <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> girls and to identify and test potential psychological mechanisms through which racial discrimination may operate to increase smoking among this group. Methods: A sample of 105 African <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> girls (mean age 15. 45 years) derived from a larger cross-sectional research project comprised the sample. Univariate analyses were conducted to provide descriptive data on the participants of the study, including information about their use of licit and illicit substances. Bivariate correlational analyses were conducted to evaluate the relationship between perceptions of discrimination and smoking habits. The ability of stress to mediate the relationship between discrimination and smoking was examined by using standard analytical procedures for testing mediation models as outlined by Baron and Kenny (1986). Results: The sample (93 %) reported experiencing discrimination and racial discrimination was highly correlated with cigarette smoking (r =. 35, p >. 001). Removing the effects of stress significantly reduced the relationship between racial discrimination and smoking (r =. 17, p <. 05), indicating that racial discrimination is related to smoking because of its stressful nature.
