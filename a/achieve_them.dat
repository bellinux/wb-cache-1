5|$|In the infancy of the hacker {{subculture}} and {{the computer}} underground, criminal convictions were rare because there was an informal code of ethics {{that was followed by}} white hat hackers. Proponents of hacking claim to be motivated by artistic and political ends, but are often unconcerned about the use of criminal means to <b>achieve</b> <b>them.</b> White hat hackers break past computer security for non-malicious reasons and do no damage, akin to breaking into a house and looking around. They enjoy learning and working with computer systems, and by this experience gain a deeper understanding of electronic security. As the computer industry matured, individuals with malicious intentions (black hats) would emerge to exploit computer systems for their own personal profit.|$|E

For the first time, the army headquarters co-ordinated the artillery arrangements with an Army Artillery Operation Order, in which tasks and timetable were laid down and corps artillery officers left to decide the means to <b>achieve</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

It can be an opposite situation when both Goal2 and Goal3 need to be fulfilled and to <b>achieve</b> <b>them</b> one must fulfil Goal1.

In many real-world planning problems, it is necessary to trade the benefits of achieving goals against the cost of <b>achieving</b> <b>them.</b> In practice, many goals are not absolute requirements, but an expression of preferences of varying degrees of importance.

For example, tissue invasion and displacement to distant sites are normal properties of leukocytes; these steps are not needed {{in the development of}} leukemia. The different steps do not necessarily represent individual mutations. For example, inactivation of a single gene, coding for the p53 protein, will cause genomic instability, evasion of apoptosis and increased angiogenesis. Not all the cancer cells are dividing. Rather, a subset of the cells in a tumor, called cancer stem cells, replicate themselves and generate differentiated cells.|$|E
25|$|Tony Blair had in 1993, before {{becoming}} Leader of the Labour Party, written a pamphlet for the Fabian Society which criticised {{the wording of}} Clause IV for not clearly stating the means and ends of the party. Blair put forward a case for defining socialism {{in terms of a}} set of values which were constant, while the policies needed to <b>achieve</b> <b>them</b> would have to account for changing society. After becoming Leader, he announced at the conclusion of his 1994 conference speech that the Labour Party needed a new statement of aims and values and that he would draw one up and present it to the party. This astonished many people, as the last time such a move had been taken (by Hugh Gaitskell in the late 1950s), it had been a failure.|$|E

500|$|From {{his early}} days, Auerbach was {{convinced}} that the fast break, where a team used a quick outlet pass to fast guards who run downcourt and score before the opponent had re-established position, was a potent tactical weapon. This new strategy proved lethal for the opposition. Further, Auerbach moved emphasis away from individual accolades and instilled the teamwork element into his players. He also invented the concept of the role player and of the sixth man, stating: [...] "Individual honors are nice, but no Celtic has ever gone {{out of his way to}} <b>achieve</b> <b>them.</b> We have never had the league's top scorer. In fact, we won seven league championships without placing even one among the league's top 10 scorers. Our pride was never rooted in statistics." ...|$|E

As they had done with previous games in the series, Bethesda threw out their old content and technology and began work anew. A new engine was envisioned, one which would take advantage of advanced lighting and shader routines, like high dynamic range rendering and specular mapping. The final product was shipped with an engine formed of a mixture of in-house tech and Numerical Design Limited's Gamebryo engine, [...] "tricked out" [...] in collaboration with Bethesda's graphics programmers and NDL. Cheng has described the game as [...] "pixel-shader heavy", taking advantage of the feature in rendering [...] "metal, wood, stone, blood, skin," [...] in addition to water, which was the only use Morrowind made of the technology. In particular, Oblivion uses normal maps, diffuse maps, specular maps, and parallax maps, which Howard described as [...] "kind of like displacement mapping". Oblivion makes use of Radiant AI, a new artificial intelligence system that allows non-player characters to dynamically react and interact with the world around them. General goals, such as [...] "Eat at this city at 2pm" [...] are given to NPCs, and NPCs are left to determine how to <b>achieve</b> <b>them.</b> The absence of individual scripting for each character allowed {{for the construction of a}} world on a much larger scale than other games had developed, and aided in the creation of what Todd Howard described as an [...] "organic feel" [...] for the game.|$|E

Porter wrote: [...] "chieving competitive advantage requires a firm to make a choice...about the type of competitive advantage it seeks to attain and the scope within which it will attain it." [...] He also wrote: [...] "The two basic types of competitive advantage [...] combined with the scope of activities for which a firm seeks to <b>achieve</b> <b>them</b> lead to three generic strategies for achieving above average performance in an industry: cost leadership, differentiation and focus.

On 14 November, III Corps was told when to move its reserve, the 29th Division forward, to capture the canal crossings at Masnières and Marcoing. The RFC, Tank Corps and Royal Artillery, arranged their plans through Third Army HQ, rather than direct with corps headquarters, to ensure that the new artillery techniques, the role of the tanks in creating gaps in the German wire ahead of the infantry and organised air operations over the battlefield, were co-ordinated.|$|E
