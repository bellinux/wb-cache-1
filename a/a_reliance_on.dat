5|$|The Great Depression (1929–c. 1939) hit {{especially}} hard in Western Canada, including Manitoba.

The Voyager crew rescues Torres and restores her to her original state, while she attempts to reconcile with her identity as a half-human half-Klingon.

5|$|More recently, Taylor (1992) pointed {{that the}} {{relatively}} high dependency ratio and the slow demographic transition in Argentina led to <b>a</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> foreign capital to offset the resulting low savings rate. From the 1930s onwards, the accumulation of capital was hampered by {{the relatively high}} prices of (mostly imported) capital goods, which {{was caused by the}} industrial policy of import substitution, in contrast with the export-led growth favoured by Canada. Other distorting factors behind the high relative prices of capital goods include the multiple exchange rates, the black market for foreign currencies, the depreciation of the national currency and high customs tariffs. This resulted in a lower capital intensity, which led to lower rates of labour productivity.|$|E

5|$|Viking metal is a {{style of}} heavy metal music {{characterized}} by a lyrical and thematic focus on Norse mythology, Norse paganism, and the Viking Age. Viking metal is quite diverse as a musical style, {{to the point where}} some consider it more a cross-genre term than a genre, but it is typically seen as black metal with influences from Nordic folk music. Common traits include a slow-paced and heavy riffing style, anthemic choruses, use of both sung and harsh vocals, <b>a</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> folk instrumentation, and often the use of keyboards for atmospheric effect.|$|E
50|$|These {{original}} Polynesians in Tonga shifted somewhat {{away from}} maritime subsistence towards <b>an</b> increased <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> agriculture and animal husbandry.

25|$|On 9 September 2002, Yearwood was {{appointed}} Deputy Prime Minister of Antigua by Lester Bird in a reorganisation {{of the government}} aimed at tackling a series of corruption scandals; he retained his Aviation, Public Information and Public Utilities portfolio.

Following the resignation of five government members in protest at Bird's leadership, Bird he announced he was reshuffling the Cabinet, and handed Yearwood the position of Minister of Finance.

25|$|Service on Flowers in the North Atlantic was {{typically}} cold, wet, monotonous and uncomfortable. Every dip of the forecastle into an oncoming wave {{was followed by}} a cascade of water into the well deck amidships. Men at action stations were drenched with spray, and water entered living spaces through hatches opened to access ammunition magazines. Interior decks were constantly wet and condensation dripped from the overheads. The head (or sanitary toilet) was drained by a straight pipe to the ocean; and a reverse flow of the icy North Atlantic would cleanse the backside of those using it during rough weather. By 1941 corvettes carried twice as many crewmen as anticipated in the original design. Men slept on lockers or tabletops or in any dark place that offered a little warmth. The inability to store perishable food meant <b>a</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> preserved food such as corned-beef and powdered potato for all meals.|$|E
25|$|After the {{turbulence}} of the Sengoku {{period and the}} establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate in 1603, old temples like Hieizan, Tō-ji and Tōdai-ji lost their power and the schools of Buddhism were surpassed in influence by the Nichiren-shū and Jōdo-shū. The Edo period was an era of unprecedented building fervor in religious architecture. The number of faithful coming for prayer or pilgrimage had increased, so designs changed to take into account their necessities, and efforts were made to catch their ears and eyes. Old sects limited themselves to revive old styles and ideas, while the new relied on huge spaces and complex designs. Both, in spite of their differences, have in common <b>a</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> splendor and excess. Early pre-modern temples were saved from monotony by elaborate structural details, the use of undulating karahafu gables and the use of buildings of monumental size. While structural design tended to become gradually more rational and efficient, the surface of religious edifices did the opposite, growing more elaborate and complex. After the middle Edo period, passed its zenith, religious architecture ended up just repeating told ideas, losing its innovative spirit and entering its final decline.|$|E
25|$|Eye {{movement}} in reading involves the visual processing of written text. This {{was described by}} the French ophthalmologist Louis Émile Javal in the late 19th century. He reported that eyes do not move continuously along a line of text, but make short, rapid movements (saccades) intermingled with short stops (fixations). Javal's observations were characterised by <b>a</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> naked-eye observation of eye {{movement in}} the absence of technology. From the late 19th to the mid-20th century, investigators used early tracking technologies to assist their observation, in a research climate that emphasised the measurement of human behaviour and skill for educational ends. Most basic knowledge about eye movement was obtained during this period. Since the mid-20th century, there have been three major changes: the development of non-invasive eye-movement tracking equipment; the introduction of computer technology to enhance the power of this equipment to pick up, record and process the huge volume of data that eye movement generates; and the emergence of cognitive psychology as a theoretical and methodological framework within which reading processes are examined. Sereno & Rayner (2003) believed that the best current approach to discover immediate signs of word recognition is through the recordings of eye movements and event-related potential.|$|E
