40|$|This paper {{presents}} <b>a</b> hybrid <b>adaptive</b> {{control method}} {{for improving the}} command-following performance of a flight control system. The hybrid adaptive control method {{is based on a}} neural network on-line parameter estimation using <b>an</b> indirect <b>adaptive</b> control in conjunction with <b>a</b> direct <b>adaptive</b> control. The parameter estimation revises a dynamic inversion control model to reduce the tracking error. The direct adaptive control then accounts for any residual tracking error by a rate command augmentation. The plant parameter estimation is based on two approaches: 1) <b>an</b> indirect <b>adaptive</b> law derived from the Lyapunov direct method to ensure that the tracking error is bounded, and 2) a recursive least-squares method that minimizes the modeling error. Simulations show that the hybrid adaptive control can provide a significant improvement in the tracking performance over <b>a</b> direct <b>adaptive</b> control method alone. I...|$|R

5|$|The American {{biologist}} Sewall Wright, who had {{a background}} in animal breeding experiments, focused on combinations of interacting genes, {{and the effects of}} inbreeding on small, relatively isolated populations that exhibited genetic drift. In 1932, Wright introduced the concept of <b>an</b> <b>adaptive</b> landscape and argued that genetic drift and inbreeding could drive a small, isolated sub-population away from <b>an</b> <b>adaptive</b> peak, allowing natural selection to drive it towards different adaptive peaks. The work of Fisher, Haldane and Wright founded the discipline of population genetics. This integrated natural selection with Mendelian genetics, which was the critical first step in developing a unified theory of how evolution worked.|$|E
5|$|Behavior theorists see delaying {{gratification}} as <b>an</b> <b>adaptive</b> skill. It {{has been}} shown that learning to delay gratification promotes positive social behavior, such as sharing and positive peer interactions. For example, students who learn to delay gratification are better able to complete their assigned activities. To put it simply, if someone undertakes an activity with the promise of a delayed reward after, the task's completion becomes more likely.|$|E

5|$|Antibodies are protein {{components}} of <b>an</b> <b>adaptive</b> immune system whose main {{function is to}} bind antigens, or foreign substances in the body, and target them for destruction. Antibodies can be secreted into the extracellular environment or anchored in the membranes of specialized B cells known as plasma cells. Whereas enzymes are limited in their binding affinity for their substrates by the necessity of conducting their reaction, antibodies have no such constraints. An antibody's binding affinity to its target is extraordinarily high.|$|E

Most archaea have CRISPR–Cas systems as <b>an</b> <b>adaptive</b> defence against viruses. These enable archaea to retain sections of viral DNA, which are then used to target and eliminate subsequent infections by the virus using a process similar to RNA interference.|$|E
