25|$|Like Tristan {{the subject}} of Pelléas is a love {{triangle}} set in a vaguely Medieval world. Unlike the protagonists of Tristan, the characters rarely seem to understand or be able to <b>articulate</b> <b>their</b> own feelings.

25|$|Meanwhile, other action painters, notably Willem de Kooning, Arshile Gorky, Norman Bluhm, Joan Mitchell, and James Brooks, (see gallery) used imagery via either {{abstract}} landscape or as expressionistic {{visions of}} the figure to <b>articulate</b> <b>their</b> highly personal and powerful evocations. James Brooks' paintings were particularly poetic and highly prescient in relationship to Lyrical Abstraction that became prominent in the late 1960s and the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|In the 14th century much of Central Asia, {{and many}} areas beyond it, were conquered by Timur (1336–1405) {{who is known}} in the west as Tamerlane. It was during Timur’s reign that the nomadic steppe culture of Central Asia fused with the settled culture of Iran. One of its {{consequences}} was an entirely new visual language that glorified Timur and subsequent Timurid rulers. This visual language was also used to <b>articulate</b> <b>their</b> commitment to Islam. Timur's large empire collapsed soon after his death, however. The region then became divided among a series of smaller Khanates, including the Khanate of Khiva, the Khanate of Bukhara, the Khanate of Kokand, and the Khanate of Kashgar.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{physical}} health {{factors associated with}} developmental disabilities. For some specific syndromes and diagnoses, these are inherent, such as poor heart function in people with Down syndrome. People with severe communication difficulties {{find it difficult to}} <b>articulate</b> <b>their</b> health needs, and without adequate support and education might not recognize ill health. Epilepsy, sensory problems (such as poor vision and hearing), obesity and poor dental health are over-represented in this population. Life expectancy among people with developmental disabilities as a group is estimated at 20 years below average, although this is improving with advancements in adaptive and medical technologies, and as people are leading healthier, more fulfilling lives, and some conditions (such as Freeman-Sheldon syndrome) do not impact life expectancy.|$|E

25|$|While the trustees' honorary degree {{committee}} {{approved the}} honorees unanimously, five student {{members of the}} committee wrote to complain that they had to vote on the five honorees as a slate in the final stage of the voting, and felt the selection of Schlafly was a mistake despite her prominence as a famous WU graduate. In {{the days leading up to}} the commencement ceremony, Washington University Chancellor Mark S. Wrighton explained the trustees' decision to award Schlafly’s degree with the following statement:In bestowing this degree, the University is not endorsing Mrs. Schlafly's views or opinions; rather, it is recognizing an alumna of the University whose life and work have had a broad impact on American life and have sparked widespread debate and controversies that in many cases have helped people better formulate and <b>articulate</b> <b>their</b> own views about the values they hold.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} 1990s the Seattle/Olympia Washington area had a {{sophisticated}} {{do it yourself}} infrastructure. Young women involved in underground music scenes took advantage of this to <b>articulate</b> <b>their</b> feminist thoughts and desires through creating punk-rock fanzines and forming garage bands. The political model of collage-based, photocopied handbills and booklets was already used by the punk movement {{as a way to}} activate underground music, leftist politics and alternative (to mainstream) sub-cultures. There was a discomfort among many women in the punk movement who felt that they had no space for organizing, because of the misogyny in the punk culture. Many women found that while they identified with a larger, music-oriented subculture, they often had little to no voice in their local scenes. Women at the punk-rock shows saw themselves as girlfriends of the boys, so they took it upon themselves to represent their own interests by making their own fanzines, music and art.|$|E
25|$|Articulated {{thoughts}} in stimulated situations (ATSS): ATSS is a paradigm {{which was created}} {{as an alternative to}} the TA (think aloud) method. This method assumes that people have continuous internal dialogues that can be naturally attended to. ATSS also assesses a person’s inner thoughts as they verbalize their cognitions. In this procedure, subjects listen to a scenario via a video or audio player and are asked to imagine that they are in that specific situation. Later, they are asked to <b>articulate</b> <b>their</b> thoughts as they occur in reaction to the playing scenario. This method is useful in studying emotional experience given that the scenarios used can influence specific emotions. Most importantly, the method has contributed to the study of personality. In a study conducted by Rayburn and Davison (2002), subjects’ thoughts and empathy toward anti-gay hate crimes were evaluated. The researchers found that participants showed more aggressive intentions towards the offender in scenarios which mimicked hate crimes.|$|E
50|$|During the Renaissance period, {{the differing}} {{representations}} of buildings evolved and grew rapidly through {{the introduction of}} perspective.

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} developments of the disability rights movement was the growth of the independent living movement, which emerged in California in the 1960s through the efforts of Edward Roberts and other wheelchair-using individuals. This movement, a subset of the disability rights movement, postulates that people with disabilities are the best experts on their needs, and therefore they must take the initiative, individually and collectively, in designing and promoting better solutions and must organize themselves for political power. Besides de-professionalization and self-representation, the independent living movement's ideology comprises de-medicalization of disability, de-institutionalization and cross-disability (i.e. inclusion in the independent living movement regardless of diagnoses). Similarly, The Architectural Barriers Act was passed in 1968, mandating that federally constructed buildings and facilities be accessible to people with physical disabilities. This act is generally considered to be the first ever-federal disability rights legislation. Unfortunately for those with cognitive disabilities, their disability made it more difficult to be the best expert of their own needs, hindering their ability to self-advocate as their wheelchair-using counterparts could. Self-representation was much more difficult for those who could not <b>articulate</b> <b>their</b> thoughts, leading to their dependence on others to carry on the movement.|$|E
500|$|A music video, co-directed by Neil Pollock and Jonathan Bekemeier, {{to promote}} the single shows the band playing its {{instruments}} through a distorted fish-eye lens, the camera variously panning horizontally across the performance space and vertically over the individual band members. Keeping {{in the spirit of}} the mimed performance, Francis and bassist Kim Deal open and shut their mouths in time with their prerecorded vocals, yet make no attempt to <b>articulate</b> <b>their</b> lips in synch with the words that they are supposed to be singing. Instead, they simply keep their mouths wide open with blank expressions for the duration of each verse. Francis stated that [...] "Water on the brain" [...] was the theme of the clip.|$|E
500|$|In 1884 Riel {{was called}} {{upon by the}} Métis leaders in Saskatchewan to <b>articulate</b> <b>their</b> [...] grievances to the Canadian government. [...] Instead he {{organized}} a military resistance that escalated into a military confrontation, the North-West Rebellion of 1885. [...] Ottawa used the new rail lines to send in thousands of combat soldiers. It ended in his arrest and conviction for high treason. [...] Rejecting many protests and popular appeals, Prime Minister MacDonald decided to hang him. Riel {{was seen as a}} heroic victim by French Canadians; his execution had a lasting negative impact on Canada, polarizing the new nation along ethno-religious lines. Although only a few hundred people were directly affected by the Rebellion in Saskatchewan, the long-term result was that the Prairie provinces would be controlled by the Anglophones, not the Francophones. An even more important long-term impact was the bitter alienation Francophones across Canada showed and anger against the repression of their countrymen.|$|E
5000|$|After {{parties have}} <b>articulated</b> <b>their</b> animosities, {{the next stage}} is termed the reflexive-reframing stage where the [...] "why" [...] and [...] "who" [...] of the issue is examined. The {{identity}} needs of all sides are brought to the forefront {{with the goal of}} getting [...] "the disputants to move from positional bargaining to interest-based approaches." [...] Rothman and Olson suggest that the parties should now engage in a [...] "deep dialogue" [...] to give a voice and structure to the underlying needs of the various parties. The needs of the various parties are, in turn, the underlying causes of the conflict. The effect of this stage is termed resonance, as each side has <b>articulated</b> <b>their</b> core concerns and heard the concerns of the other actors. At this point, actors begin to see where their identities converge, and where they diverge.|$|R

500|$|Foremost of the disorienting effects, {{to critics}} and scholars, is Whedon's use {{of sound and}} silence. While Buffy {{performs}} CPR, she cracks one of Joyce's ribs with a startling snap. After Buffy vomits on the floor, she stands in the back doorway listening to life carrying on: children playing, someone practicing a trumpet, and birds singing. Long pauses between dialogue create gaps that turn awkward as the characters {{try to think of}} what to say, made especially notable in a series famous for its rapid banter. The transition between the Christmas dinner scene and the living room scene is abrupt, and the sound of Buffy and Joyce shouting because they dropped a pie on the floor carries over into the silence of Joyce's lifeless face and Buffy standing alone in the living room. This effect is also used when shifting between Buffy's alternate version of her mother being [...] "good as new" [...] in the hospital and the paramedics trying to revive her. In the car on the way to Willow's dormitory, Anya is shot by a camera mounted on the front bumper, separated from the audience by the windshield. Xander, driving, faces the other way; neither of them speak and only the sound of the car can be heard. Joyce Millman at Salon.com writes of the sound issues, [...] "The effect was almost Bergmanesque in its starkness. The spooky stillness and the long, spacey pauses in conversation as characters struggled to <b>articulate</b> <b>their</b> feelings exaggerated the sense of time elongating and standing still." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Symposium is {{considered}} a dialogue – a form used by Plato in more than thirty works – {{but in fact it}} is predominantly a series of essay-like speeches from differing points of view. So dialogue plays a smaller role in the Symposium than it does in Plato’s other dialogues. [...] With dialogue, Socrates is renowned for his dialectic, which is his ability to ask questions that encourage others to think deeply about what they care about, and <b>articulate</b> <b>their</b> ideas. In the Symposium the dialectic exists among the speeches: in seeing how the ideas conflict from speech-to-speech, and in the effort to resolve the contradictions and see the philosophy that underlies them all.|$|E
