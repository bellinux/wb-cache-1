Prisoners were sent to work before and after breakfast (in their cells), before assembling for muster at midday. This was followed by dinner in the exercise yard or the work site, and more work throughout the afternoon, until supper at 6:00 pm in the cells. Night officers took over at 7:15 pm.|$|E

5|$|Adolf Hitler—accompanied by Generalfeldmarschall Wilhelm Keitel, {{his former}} naval {{adjutant}} Commander Karl-Jesko von Puttkamer, and his Luftwaffe adjutant Oberst Nicolaus von Below, among others—visited Bismarck on 5 May 1941. Missing was Grand Admiral Erich Raeder. Hitler was {{taken on a}} tour of the ship by Admiral Lütjens and inspected the various battle stations. Hitler and Lütjens also met in private and discussed the risks of a mission in the North Atlantic. After this meeting, Hitler <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> of Bismarck had lunch in the officers' mess, where Hitler spoke about America's unwillingness to enter the war. Lindemann openly disagreed with Hitler, expressing his opinion that the possibility of the United States entering the war could not be ruled out.|$|E
50|$|According to <b>the</b> {{incident}} report <b>and</b> criminal complaint filed in court, <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> showed Craig his police identification beneath the partition separating their stalls, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> then pointed his finger towards the restroom exit. Craig initially said no, but he ultimately complied with <b>the</b> <b>officer's</b> request {{to leave the}} restroom. After Craig <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> left <b>the</b> restroom, Craig was reluctant to go with <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> <b>and</b> demanded <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> show his police identification a second time. Once <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> complied with <b>the</b> request, Craig, <b>the</b> arresting <b>officer,</b> <b>and</b> a police detective, who was stationed outside of the restroom, went to the airport police station.|$|R

5|$|One night, {{a pair of}} LAPD {{officers}} come in {{to speak}} to Sweetback's boss, Beetle (Simon Chuckster). A black man has been murdered, and there is pressure from the black community {{to bring in a}} suspect. The police ask permission to arrest Sweetback, blame him for the crime, and then release him a few days later for lack of evidence, in order to appease the black community. Beetle agrees, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> arrest Sweetback. On the way to the police station, the officers arrest a young Black Panther named Mu-Mu (Hubert Scales). They handcuff him to Sweetback, but when Mu-Mu insults the officers, they take both men out of the car, undo the handcuff from Mu-Mu's wrist, and beat him. In response, Sweetback uses the handcuffs, still hanging from his wrist, to beat the officers into unconsciousness.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Mercer {{had arrived}} in the trenches, a massive German {{artillery}} bombardment began, heavy calibre shells destroying trenches and caving in dugouts, killing many Canadian soldiers. Mercer was trapped in a dugout and then stunned by a huge shell burst which wounded most of his staff <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> of the battalion he was inspecting. The more badly wounded among the officers were transported to an underground field hospital but Mercer was left behind with wounded aide Captain Lynam Gooderham, and so was not present when the hospital was buried by the explosion of four mines which preceded a large-scale German attack. In the confused situation, Mercer and Gooderham attempted to escape the advancing enemy but inadvertently ran into crossfire, where Mercer's leg was broken by a bullet.|$|E
5|$|The College of Arms is a {{corporation}} of thirteen heralds, styled Officers in Ordinary. This thirteen {{can be divided}} hierarchically into three distinctive ranks: three Kings of Arms, six Heralds of Arms and four Pursuivants of Arms. There are also presently seven Officers Extraordinary, who take part in ceremonial occasions but {{are not part of}} the College. As members of the Royal Household, the heralds are appointed at the pleasure of the Sovereign on the recommendation of the Earl Marshal. The Officers in Ordinary are appointed by Letters Patent under the Great Seal of the Realm, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Officers</b> Extraordinary by Royal Sign Manual; all appointments are announced in the London Gazette.|$|E

50|$|In a 7-2 vote, the Court {{overturned}} the lower courts' decision <b>and</b> ruled that <b>the</b> <b>officer's</b> search of containers within the car {{were not considered}} unreasonable. Since a reasonable person would expect narcotics to be carried in a container, <b>and</b> because <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> told Jimeno of his suspicions, the Court ruled that <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> acted within reason. Jimeno was thus found guilty <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> was not {{in violation of the}} 4th amendment.|$|R

5|$|UNTAG {{was a large}} operation, {{with nearly}} 8,000 men and women {{deployed}} to Namibia from more than 120 countries to assist the process. The military force numbered approximately 4,500, and was commanded by Lieutenant-General Dewan Prem Chand of India; the main military UNTAG Headquarters was in Windhoek, Namibia's capital and largest city. The commanders of the Australian contingents were Colonels Richard D. Warren (1ASC) and John A. Crocker (2ASC). Other senior appointments included the contingent seconds-in-command, Lieutenant colonels Kevin Pippard (1ASC) and Ken Gillespie (2ASC), <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> commanding the 17th Construction Squadron, Majors David Crago (1ASC) and Brendan Sowry (2ASC).|$|E
5|$|Eyre and {{the crew}} were landed and marched to Antibes, where they were imprisoned with the crew of a Sardinian frigate that had been {{captured}} the day before Speedy. The crew had been imprisoned on Martin's flagship Sans Culotte and had been severely treated, with their captain, Ross, not being allowed to wash or shave. The British were placed in a dungeon at Antibes, with only straw to lie on, awaiting {{the decision of the}} authorities. After three weeks in this state, they were marched to Aix-en-Provence and were confined in the prison there. After a month imprisoned in Aix, Maximilien Robespierre fell and the Reign of Terror came to an end. The British were paroled. Eyre <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> were taken to Romans, in Dauphiné where Eyre remained until May 1795 when he was released in exchange for a French officer. He faced a court-martial for the loss of Speedy, but was honourably acquitted.|$|E
5|$|In 1952–3, Brooke-Little {{served on}} the staff {{assembled}} by the Earl Marshal to plan the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. He was appointed a Gold Staff Officer for the Coronation and held a key co-ordination role during planning {{as well as on}} the day. It was his abiding interest in heraldry that led to this appointment, and this work with the Earl Marshal <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> of arms led to his first heraldic appointment. He joined the College of Arms as Bluemantle Pursuivant in 1956. The rank of pursuivant is the junior of the three levels an officer of arms can attain, and Brooke-Little related the story of his appointment in an editorial. In 1956, Sir George Bellew, the Garter King of Arms, had recommended Brooke-Little and Colin Cole for the open position of Bluemantle. The two were asked to meet with the Earl Marshal in London. The Earl Marshal was not usually faced with two candidates for an opening; he offered the position to Cole, who turned it down as his wife was expecting a child. Brooke-Little was made Bluemantle. Several months later when Sir Gerald Wollaston died, in the ensuing shuffle Cole was finally given his appointment as Portcullis Pursuivant.|$|E

5|$|Stan {{tries to}} persuade Randy {{to tell the}} truth about the stolen magnet, but Randy refuses in order to avoid embarrassment. As the pair works on the warp drive, an Intergalactic Police ship {{approaches}} Earth; McGeezax cloaks his ship and drags Stan out of sight as a hostage, leaving the townspeople to divert the officers' questions. The officers say that McGeezax stole a large sum of space cash, but no one admits to seeing him, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> leave. Randy then provides a diversion for McGeezax while Stan, at Randy's insistence, stabs him to death with a shank. McGeezax's ship is found to contain the stolen space cash, but instead of returning it, Randy persuades everyone to divide it among themselves. Randy, in contact with all world leaders, buys other countries' silence by giving them a share. Four days later, the officers return to South Park. They now know that McGeezax landed here and Randy tells them of his death, but everyone denies finding any space cash.|$|E
5|$|The first {{attack on}} Île de la Passe was {{launched}} {{on the evening}} of 10 August, with Staunch towing boats carrying over 400 soldiers, Royal Marines and volunteer sailors to the island under cover of darkness, guided by Nereides pilot. During the night however, the pilot became lost and the boats were scattered in high winds and had not reassembled by dawn. To distract French attention from the drifting boats, Pym directed Captain Henry Lambert in Iphigenia to sail conspicuously off Port Napoleon, where {{the main body of the}} French squadron, led by Hamelin in Vénus, was based. Pym joined Lambert later in the day and the frigates subsequently returned to the waters of Grand Port by different routes, confusing French observers from the shore as to British intentions. By 13 August, the boats originally intended for the attack had still not been assembled and Pym decided that he could not risk waiting any longer without the French launching a counterattack. Launching his own boats at 8:00 pm, guided by the pilot and commanded by Pym's second in command, Lieutenant Norman, Pym's marines and sailors landed on the island in darkness under heavy fire from the defenders. Norman was killed in the initial exchange of fire, but his deputy, Lieutenant Watling, seized the island by storming the fortifications surrounding the battery. Seven British personnel were killed and 18 wounded in the battle, in which the storming party managed to seize intact French naval code books and took 80 prisoners. Willoughby was furious that Pym had assumed command of the operation without his permission <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> exchanged angry letters, part of an ongoing disagreement between them that engendered mutual distrust.|$|E
