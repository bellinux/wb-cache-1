5|$|The main {{microprocessor}} is a 16/32-bit Motorola 68000 CPU clocked at 7.6 MHz. The console uses a Zilog Z80 sub-processor, mainly used {{to control}} the sound hardware and provide backward compatibility with the Master System. The system has 72 kB of RAM, 64 kB of video RAM, and can display up to 61 colors at once from <b>a</b> <b>palette</b> <b>of</b> 512. The games are in ROM cartridge format and inserted in the top.|$|E
5|$|Video {{output is}} through an RF {{modulator}} and {{was designed for}} use with contemporary television sets, for a simple colour graphic display. Text can be displayed using 32columns × 24rows of characters from the ZX Spectrum character set or from a set provided within an application, from <b>a</b> <b>palette</b> <b>of</b> 15 shades: seven colours at two levels of brightness each, plus black. The image resolution is 256×192 with the same colour limitations. To conserve memory, colour is stored separate from the pixel bitmap in a low resolution, 32×24 grid overlay, corresponding to the character cells. In practice, this means that all pixels of an 8x8 character block share one foreground colour and one background colour.|$|E

The lounge represents a world-class experience carefully planned with appropriate amenities, for example: an exclusive smoking zone, an enclosed VIP sitting area and baby changing units. Just as the village elders sat {{in a circle and}} shared a traditional beverage and discussed matters, the lounge’s focal feature is its central circular banquette seating, where guests from different backgrounds can meet and converse.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} standard {{provides a}} mono spaced 40×24 character grid. Characters are sent using a 7-bit codec, with an 8th bit employed for error detection. The standard was improved in 1976 {{to allow for}} improved appearance {{and the ability to}} individually select the color of each character from <b>a</b> <b>palette</b> <b>of</b> 8. The proposed higher resolution Level 2 (1981) was not adopted in Britain (in-vision services from Ceefax & ORACLE did use it at various times however, though even this was ceased by the BBC in 1996), although transmission rates were doubled from two to four lines a frame.|$|E

25|$|Blue {{gradually}} {{returned to}} court fashion in the 17th century, {{as part of}} <b>a</b> <b>palette</b> <b>of</b> peacock-bright colours shown off in extremely elaborate costumes. The modern blue business suit {{has its roots in}} England {{in the middle of the}} 17th century. Following the London plague of 1665 and the London fire of 1666, King Charles II of England ordered that his courtiers wear simple coats, waistcoats and breeches, and the palette of colours became blue, grey, white and buff. Widely imitated, this style of men's fashion became almost a uniform of the London merchant class and the English country gentleman.|$|E
25|$|Le Chahut is an oil {{painting}} on canvas measuring 170 by 141cm (67 x 55 in). Seurat employed a Divisionist style, with pointillist dots of color. The work {{is dominated by}} a color scheme that tends toward the red end of the spectrum, of earth tones that draw from <b>a</b> <b>palette</b> <b>of</b> browns, tans, warm grays, and blues, interspersed with not just the primary colors (reds and yellows), nor even with the six principal colors, but with eighteen mixtures on his palette prior to application on the canvas (any {{of which could be}} mixed with white). A deeper blue border painted {{around the edge of the}} canvas culminates in a shallow arch on the upper edge.|$|E
25|$|In 2002 and 2010, the Hudson Shakespeare Company of New Jersey staged {{separate}} productions as part {{of their}} respective Shakespeare in the Parks seasons. The 2002 version was directed by Michael Collins and transposed the action to a West Indies, nautical setting. Actors were featured in outfits indicative of looks of various Caribbean islands. The 2010 production directed by Jon Ciccarelli was fashioned after the atmosphere of the film The Dark Knight with <b>a</b> <b>palette</b> <b>of</b> reds and blacks and set the action in an urban setting. Lear (Tom Cox) appeared as a head of multi-national conglomerate who divided up his fortune among his socialite daughter Goneril (Brenda Scott), his officious middle daughter Regan (Noelle Fair) and university daughter Cordelia (Emily Best).|$|E

25|$|During the {{recording}} of the band's second album In the Wake of Poseidon Greg Lake departed to form Emerson, Lake and Palmer, leaving Fripp and Sinfield as the only remaining founder members. They issued two more albums (Lizard and Islands) and were the only constants in a regularly changing King Crimson lineup. It included (at various times) Gordon Haskell, saxophonist/flute player Mel Collins, drummers Andy McCulloch and Ian Wallace and future Bad Company bass player Boz Burrell, in addition to <b>a</b> <b>palette</b> <b>of</b> guest players from Soft Machine, Keith Tippett's band, Brotherhood of Breath and Centipede. Fripp was listed as the sole composer of the band's music during this time, which built on the first album's blueprint but progressed further into jazz rock and free jazz while also taking form from Sinfield's esoteric lyrical and mythological concepts.|$|E
25|$|A typical episode {{features}} several vignettes of {{the everyday}} life of a couple, with the camera mostly centered on them. Often other characters are cropped, giving the programme its unique visual style. The couple receive friends for supper, go to the convenience store, or leave on a trip, and sometimes get on each other's nerves. Their quirks, and loving bickering, provide much of the program's humor. The graphic design style associated with the original Un gars, une fille, which consists of <b>a</b> <b>palette</b> <b>of</b> pastel blue and pink, and rough lines and scribbles, (seen in the transition graphics, see Original section), {{as well as a}} logo with simulated printing mistakes and smears, has been imitated by most of the other versions, with the notable exception of the American version. The character names are often those of the actors, as in the first version.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{the death}} of Saidie May in 1951, Jensen settled in New York and began to focus {{exclusively}} on painting, out of his Lincoln Arcade studio. Here he first gained the attention of James Johnson Sweeney, Director of the Guggenheim Museum. His first solo exhibition of twelve canvases was held in 1952 at the John Heller Gallery, including portraits, still life, landscapes and figures in an abstract expressionist style, influenced by his studies of Goethe's color theory, with <b>a</b> <b>palette</b> <b>of</b> prismatic colors. Around this time, he began what would be long friendships with painter Mark Rothko and art critic Lil Picard. This was followed by his first solo show at the Tanager Gallery in 1955, the same year he began to exchange ideas with Sam Francis. In 1957, he started to incorporate checkerboards in his prismatic colored murals, and in diagrams and paintings on paper. He also began to investigate his compositional logic, including calligraphy, and became extremely prolific. Henry Luce III, son of the founder of Time Magazine, first collected his work, eventually commissioning a mural for the Time/Life building in Paris in 1959.|$|E
