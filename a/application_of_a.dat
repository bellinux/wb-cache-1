5|$|The restorers {{washed the}} {{surfaces}} {{using a variety}} of solvents. Distilled water was used wherever possible to remove soot and dissolve water-soluble gums. Retouching and repainting that had been part of previous later restorations were removed with a gelatinous solvent, applied in several stages for measured times, and washed with distilled water. Salt efflorescences of calcium carbonate were treated by the <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> solution of dimethylformamide. The final step was the <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> weak solution of acrylic polymer to consolidate and protect the surface, and further washing.|$|E

For day sailing, a solution of hydrogen peroxide and sea water would be applied, producing sulphate and returning the hull to a white colour desirable for daytime conditions.|$|E

With ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), the flesh becomes very pale vinaceous, and the tubes turn bright red. Iron(II) sulfate (FeSO4) turns the flesh gray, the tubes dark gray to black, and the stipe cuticle light gray.|$|E

5|$|A bite from a {{black mamba}} causes initial {{neurological}} and neuromuscular symptoms that may commonly include headache and a metallic taste in the mouth, which may {{be accompanied by a}} triad of paresthesias, profuse perspiration and salivation. Other symptoms may include ptosis and gradual bulbar palsy. Localised pain or numbness around the bite site is common but not typically severe; therefore, <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tourniquet proximal to the bite site is feasible and may assist in slowing the onset of prominent neurotoxicity. Without appropriate treatment, symptoms typically progress to more severe reactions such as tachydysrhythmias and neurogenic shock, leading to death by asphyxiation, cardiovascular collapse, or respiratory failure.|$|E
5|$|After the work-ins had ended, work {{continued}} on finishing the cap which {{was scheduled for}} lift-on in October. The weather hampered the work initially, but the <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> modern microporous paint, designed to withstand normal movement of the timber and yet remain waterproof, was completed {{in time for the}} lift-on. A mini work-in was held the weekend before the cap was lifted, with 17 people participating over the weekend. Final work was done to the cap and a new window was fitted to the stone floor of the mill. The tarpaulin was removed and the trammel dismantled. The 5-ton cap was lifted into place by a mobile crane on 24 October 1983, watched by a crowd of some 70 people. The fitting of the cap was toasted with beer from Adnams Brewery, Southwold.|$|E

5|$|Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs is {{a seminal}} case in {{administrative}} law {{decided by the}} Court of Appeal of Singapore in 1988. The Court decided the appeal in the appellants' favour on a technical ground, but considered obiter dicta the reviewability of government power in preventive detention cases under the Internal Security Act ("ISA"). The case approved the application by the court of an objective test in the review of government discretion under the ISA, stating that all power has legal limits {{and the rule of}} law demands that the courts should be able to examine the exercise of discretionary power. This was a landmark shift from the position in the 1971 High Court decision Lee Mau Seng v.

5|$|Consistent {{condom use}} {{reduces the risk}} of HIV {{transmission}} by approximately 80% over the long term. When condoms are used consistently by a couple in which one person is infected, the rate of HIV infection is less than 1% per year. There is some evidence to suggest that female condoms may provide an equivalent level of protection. <b>Application</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> vaginal gel containing tenofovir (a reverse transcriptase inhibitor) immediately before sex seems to reduce infection rates by approximately 40% among African women. By contrast, use of the spermicide nonoxynol-9 may increase the risk of transmission due to its tendency to cause vaginal and rectal irritation.|$|E
5|$|Electroporation is {{the rapid}} {{increase}} in bilayer permeability induced by the <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large artificial electric field across the membrane. Experimentally, electroporation is used to introduce hydrophilic molecules into cells. It is a particularly useful technique for large highly charged molecules such as DNA, which would never passively diffuse across the hydrophobic bilayer core. Because of this, electroporation {{is one of the}} key methods of transfection as well as bacterial transformation. It has even been proposed that electroporation resulting from lightning strikes could be a mechanism of natural horizontal gene transfer.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that a question of fact involves a matter concerning primary facts such as a new witness or what people saw or heard, while a question of law involves an <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> statutory word or phase to such facts. However, this distinction is debatable, and the view has been taken that courts sometimes simply regard a matter as one involving an error of law if they wish to adopt an interventionist approach, and seek to allow judicial review to take place. In any case, it is said that the courts generally treat errors of fact committed by public authorities differently from errors of law. While errors of law are regarded by the courts as within their jurisdiction and thus subject to judicial review, they show more reluctance to intervene when errors of fact are alleged.|$|E
5|$|Munitions and {{ammunition}} handling is accomplished using a Babcock designed highly mechanised weapons handling system (HMWHS). This {{is a first}} naval <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> common land-based warehouse system. The HMWHS moves palletised munitions from the magazines and weapon preparation areas, along track ways and via several lifts, forward and aft or port and starboard. The tracks can carry a pallet to magazines, the hangar, weapons preparation areas, and the flight deck. In a change from normal procedures the magazines are unmanned, the movement of pallets is controlled from a central location, and manpower is only required when munitions are being initially stored or prepared for use. This system speeds up delivery and reduces {{the size of the}} crew by automation.|$|E

The reasons for doing so are not usually open to judicial review. On the other hand, it is the job of the courts to determine whether an authority's <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> policy to an individual who has been led to expect something different is a just exercise of power.|$|E
