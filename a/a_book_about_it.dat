[...] while maintaining a healthy skepticism towards the validity of mind cure adding, [...] "These things are true, or they are not.

500|$|At {{the time}} of Acquainted with the Nights writing, author and poet Christopher Dewdney was 52 years old and living in Toronto with his wife, Barbara Gowdy. He had {{previously}} written 14 books, the last being the 2002 book of poetry, The Natural History. His previous non-fiction books were Last Flesh: Life in the Transhuman Era (1998) on the impacts of technological advances on humanism, The Secular Grail: Paradigms of Perception (1993) regarding the human psyche, and The Immaculate Perception (1986) on his views of consciousness, language and dreams. Dewdney's past books were described as being [...] "more admired than read". On the topic of 'the night', he had a lifelong fascination with nightlife and eventually decided to write <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> He quickly became overwhelmed {{by the amount of}} information relating to the subject. For research, he consulted a variety of genres and formats, including books, journals, magazines, music, and movies, and collected information within the broad topics of art, science, social sciences and history. The perspective Dewdney took was that of [...] "explaining night to beings from another planet that had two opposed suns and no night at all".|$|E

Brackett, who receives more screen time in this film, allows Laurie {{to move in with}} him and his daughter after the events of the first film. Zombie explained, [...] "He's old, he's worn out, he's just this beat-down guy with these two girls he can't deal with." [...] Zombie characterized Loomis in the sequel as more of a [...] "sellout", who exploits the memories of those who were killed by Michael in the 2007 film. Zombie explained that he tried to channel Vincent Bugliosi, a lawyer who prosecuted Charles Manson and then wrote <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> into Loomis's character for the sequel; noting that he wanted Loomis to seem more [...] "ridiculous" [...] this time. As for Michael Myers, the character is given almost an entirely new look for the film, which is being used, according to Taylor-Compton, to illustrate a new emotion for the character as he {{spends much of his time}} trying to hide himself. Zombie said that of all of the characters that return in the sequel, Michael is the only one that does not change: [...] "All the other characters are very different. Laurie; Loomis; they're having all kinds of problems in their life, but Michael just moves along. Michael is no different; he's exactly the same as he was ten years old and he killed everybody [...] He has no concept of the world around him, so he can never be affected by it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mailer {{took part}} in the October 1967 March on the Pentagon, but {{initially}} had no intention of writing <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> After conversations with his friend, Willie Morris, editor of Harper's magazine, he agreed to produce a long essay describing the March. In a concentrated effort, he produced a 90,000-word piece in two months, and it appeared in Harpers March issue. At that time, and to date, it is the longest nonfiction piece to be published by an American magazine. As one commentator states, [...] "Mailer disarmed the literary world with Armies. The combination of detached, ironic self-presentation , deft portraiture of literary figures (especially Robert Lowell, Dwight Macdonald, and Paul Goodman), a reportorially flawless account of the March itself, and a passionate argument addressed to a divided nation, resulted in a sui generis narrative praised by even some of his most inveterate revilers." [...] Alfred Kazin, writing in the New York Times Book Review, said, “Mailer’s intuition is that the times demand a new form. He has found it." [...] He later expanded the article to a book, The Armies of the Night (1968), awarded a National Book Award and a Pulitzer Prize.|$|E
2500|$|After {{a further}} period of {{imprisonment}} westerners {{became interested in}} meeting him as well. Thornton Chase, the first Bahá'í of the West, came in 1907, and he wrote <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> `Abdu'l-Bahá, highly impressed by Chase's qualities, conferred on him the title thábit, [...] "steadfast." [...] Stanwood Cobb managed to meet `Abdu'l-Bahá, then head of the religion, after an accidental meeting with Lua Getsinger in 1908 in Egypt. [...] `Abdu'l-Bahá traveled to Egypt in September 1910 after being released following events of the Young Turk Revolution. This was the initial event {{of a series of}} journeys he took. Sometime from late September to mid-August 1910 until the winter of 1913, `Abdu'l-Bahá would travel from Egypt to various countries and back in two successive trips – first to Europe, second to America (United States and Canada) and back to Europe on the return trip. Before, between, and on return he would stop in Egypt. See `Abdu'l-Bahá's journeys to the West. Wellesley Tudor Pole became a Bahá'í after traveling to Egypt to interview him in November 1910. In the same year, `Abdu'l-Bahá referred to an early Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly of Cairo. Playwright Isabella Grinevskaya traveled to meet `Abdu'l-Bahá in Egypt and {{became a member of the}} religion. Louis Gregory visited `Abdu'l-Bahá at Ramleh in 1911. `Abdu'l-Bahá was about to make long travels to the West. Just before `Abdu'l-Bahá's first trip, a message from Lady Blomfield extended an invitation for `Abdu'l-Bahá when he was in London. `Abdu'l-Bahá then set sail 11 August 1911, reached as far as London, and returned in early December to rest for the winter. His next trip was more extensive and reached to California. He left 25 March 1912 and returned 17 June 1913 and on return stayed in Egypt almost six months before returning to Haifa/Akka. Upon his return he gave a number of talks. These were eventually published as `Abdu'l-Bahá in Egypt. After `Abdu'l-Bahá returned to Haifa, Martha Root stayed there for six months in 1915. One of the earliest Bahá'ís of the west and a Disciple of `Abdu'l-Bahá, Lua Getsinger, died in 1916 and she was buried in Egypt. And following `Abdu'l-Bahá laying the cornerstone for the first Bahá'í House of Worship of the West, the Bahá'ís from Cairo, Port Said and Alexandria contributed to the Fund for its construction in Wilmette, Illinois. [...] During World War I Bahá'ís in Port Said were pillaged twice. Meanwhile, Tudor Pole was stationed in Egypt and was directly involved in addressing the concerns raised by Ottoman threats against `Abdu'l-Bahá. As the battle lines advanced from Egypt through Palestine, the Ottomans had threatened that `Abdu'l-Bahá would be killed if the Ottomans had been forced to leave the region. This threat was taken seriously by the British Military who then sought to make his protection part of the plans for the Palestine theatre. General Allenby altered his plans for the prosecution of the war and succeeded in protecting `Abdu'l-Bahá.|$|E
