5|$|On April 6, 1917, the U.S. Congress {{declared}} war on Germany and officially entered World War I. At the time, soldiers <b>and</b> <b>sailors</b> with Spanish surnames or Spanish accents were sometimes the objects of ridicule and relegated to menial jobs. However, Hispanics continued to join the military and serve their nation.|$|E
5|$|The Confederate Soldiers <b>and</b> <b>Sailors</b> Monument was {{commissioned}} by the U.S. federal government in 1912 to memorialize the 1,616 Confederate soldiers buried in a mass grave at Indianapolis' Greenlawn Cemetery.

5|$|A {{military}} post {{was established}} on Key Biscayne in March 1838. Its first commander was Lt. Col. James Bankhead. The fort was initially known as Fort Dallas or Fort Bankhead, {{but it was}} eventually renamed Fort Russell for Captain Samuel L. Russell. He was killed when the Seminoles ambushed two boats on the Miami River in February 1839. In the summer of 1839, a total of 143 soldiers <b>and</b> <b>sailors</b> were stationed at Fort Russell. Some of the Seminoles captured during the war were held at Fort Russell until they could be placed on ships to be removed to Indian Territory.|$|E
5|$|A {{rangefinder}} {{was installed}} on the bridge and her fore and aft holds were refitted as magazines. Half-inch (12.7mm) steel plating was added to protect her steering gear and her interior cabin bulkheads and glass ventilators were removed to reduce damage from splinters. Her furniture was removed {{to make room for}} the mess decks needed to feed large numbers of troops <b>and</b> <b>sailors</b> and an operating room and sickbay were installed amidships.|$|E
5|$|Blandy ordered Warren {{to explain}} his {{position}} to 1,400 skeptical officers <b>and</b> <b>sailors.</b> Some found him persuasive, but it was August 9 before he convinced Blandy. That was the date when Blandy realized, for the first time, that Geiger counters could not detect plutonium. Blandy {{was aware of the}} health problems of radium dial painters who ingested microscopic amounts of radium in the 1920s, and the fact that plutonium was assumed to have a similar biological effect. When plutonium was discovered in the captain's quarters of Prinz Eugen, unaccompanied by fission products, Blandy realized that plutonium could be anywhere.|$|E

5|$|Earlier {{hypotheses}} of the epidemic's origin have varied. Some hypothesized the flu {{originated in}} East Asia. Dr. C. Hannoun, leading expert of the 1918 flu for the Institut Pasteur, asserted the former virus {{was likely to}} have come from China, mutating in the United States near Boston and spreading to Brest, France, Europe's battlefields, Europe, and the world using Allied soldiers <b>and</b> <b>sailors</b> as main spreaders. He considered several other hypotheses of origin, such as Spain, Kansas, and Brest, as being possible, but not likely.|$|E
5|$|Some Scots {{settled in}} the country's more {{temperate}} regions, where the climate and the forested landscape with glaciers and islands may have reminded them of their homeland (the Highlands and Northern Scotland) while English and Welsh made up the rest. The Irish immigrants, who were frequently confused with the British, arrived as merchants, tradesmen <b>and</b> <b>sailors,</b> settling along with the British in the main trading cities and ports.|$|E
5|$|The {{evidence}} for auxiliary ranks and pay is scant: even less exists than the patchy {{evidence for}} their legionary counterparts. There {{seems to be}} some consensus, however, that the auxiliary was paid one third of what a legionary received: 300 sesterces a year (400 after the reign of the emperor Commodus). Both auxiliaries and seamen received the viaticum of 300 sesterces, although the various sources differ as to whether auxiliaries <b>and</b> <b>sailors</b> received the retirement bonus known as the honesta missio, or honorable discharge.|$|E

5|$|When United States agents {{discovered}} that the German merchant ship Ypiranga was carrying illegal arms to Mexico, President Wilson ordered the Navy to stop the ship from docking {{at the port of}} Veracruz. On 21 April 1914, a naval brigade of marines <b>and</b> <b>sailors</b> occupied Veracruz. A total of 55 Medals of Honor were awarded for acts of heroism at Veracruz, the largest number ever granted for a single action.|$|E
5|$|While Alcibiades {{was still}} en route, the two fleets clashed at Abydos, where the Peloponnesians {{had set up}} their main naval base. The battle was evenly matched, and raged for a long time, but the balance tipped towards the Athenians when Alcibiades sailed into the Hellespont with {{eighteen}} triremes. The Persian satrap Pharnabazus, who had replaced Tissaphernes as the sponsor of the Peloponnesian fleet, moved his land army to the shore to defend the ships <b>and</b> <b>sailors</b> who had beached their ships. Only {{the support of the}} Persian land army and the coming of night saved the Peloponnesian fleet from complete destruction.|$|E
5|$|Wilson's {{experience}} in the militia, service with the 22nd Massachusetts, and chairmanship of the Military Affairs Committee provided him with more practical military knowledge and training than any other Senator.
