But I do remember hearing them. I remember the weird cadence of their song in the dark distance; I remember the brittle sound of the camel's hooves crushing the frozen snow; and I remember the mysterious tinkling of their silver bridles.|$|E

Of course, if he's too friendly with me, then I think that it hurts his other relatives. He was very loyal to his mother. That was the first thing that was in his mind." [...] Nevertheless, she and Sean attended the opening of Julian's photo exhibition at the Morrison Hotel in New York City in 2010, appearing for the first time for photos with Cynthia and Julian. She also promoted the exhibition on her website, and Julian and Sean are close.|$|E

The film was directed by Shinde, her second directorial after the comedy-drama film English Vinglish (2012). When Shinde was asked {{in an interview with}} The Indian Express, whether there is a personal story to Dear Zindagi, she replied, [...] "Dear Zindagi is inspired by life in general. It started with an idea about the connections we make in our lives and how such connections can impact us. That’s something that interested me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to develop a story around the philosophy." [...] In August 2015, Shinde revealed that she had [...] "almost" [...] completed working on the screenplay.|$|E

500|$|The revived Doctor Who {{series was}} to feature a script by Stephen Fry, {{set in the}} 1920s. Rumours {{appeared}} on the BBC's websites shortly after the airing of the new Series 1 and the story was pencilled in as the eleventh episode of Series 2. According to a video diary entry by David Tennant, Fry attended the very first cast read-through for Series 2, indicating that his script was still under consideration at that point. Due to budgetary constraints, the episode was moved to Series 3 and replaced by Fear Her. The story was subsequently abandoned, as Fry did not have spare time for the rewriting necessary to replace Rose with Martha. Fry said, [...] "They {{asked me to do}} a series <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried,</b> but I just ran out of time, and so I wrote a pathetic letter of [...] "I'm sorry I can't do this" [...] to Davies." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the success}} of The Dark Knight, Eckhart next {{appeared}} in Alan Ball's Towelhead (2008), an adaption of the Alicia Erian novel of the same name, in which he played a Gulf War Army reservist who sexually abuses his 13-year-old Arab-American neighbor. The film was screened under the name Nothing is Private at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival. When he was first approached for the role, Eckhart revealed {{that he did not}} want to play a [...] "pedophile". When asked about the sex scenes, Eckhart said: [...] "Those were difficult times.... The way I did it was to really trust Alan. It was in the words. I really trusted Summer , <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to get her to trust me, to build a relationship when we were doing physical scenes. We'd really rehearse them mechanically, and I'd say, 'OK, I'm going to put my hand here, I'm going to do this.'... I think I found it more difficult." [...] Towelhead was critically and financially unsuccessful.|$|E

I thought I was clear... <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> going down slowly, and Jimmie just must have been there a little bit, turned me sideways and got me on the apron—scared everybody half to death, including me." [...] Stewart, who finished second, said, [...] "I actually had fun racing at Daytona again, which I haven't had for a while. I don't know what the consensus is from everybody else, but I had more fun as a driver tonight than what we've had in the past." [...] Ambrose, who finished third in the race, explained, [...] "It's definitely a lot more fun, more entertaining for the fans, and more in control for the drivers." ...|$|E

500|$|Waltrip, {{who failed}} {{to qualify for the}} Daytona 500 after {{crashing}} on lap 52, said he felt he had let everyone down but was thankful his team and his sponsor Aaron's had given him an opportunity to race in the Duels. Patrick, who was hit by Almirola on the final lap and crashed heavily into the wall, said, [...] "It sucks [...] You just have to brace yourself. I guess in these situations, I just have to be glad that I'm a small driver and that I've got room. Kinda hug it in and let it rip." [...] She also said the crash was [...] "a blessing in a big disguise". Patrick, along with Gilliland, Montoya and Menard, were required to drive their backup cars for the Daytona 500. After the wreck on lap nine, Gilliland cut his thumb on his helmet; the thumb required one stitch but he was confident about driving his backup car. According to Menard, who was involved in the lap nine wreck, [...] "Somebody turned (David) Gilliland; I saw him get sideways underneath me. I was three lanes up <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to clear him and didn’t quite make it.” It took 56 minutes and 34 seconds to complete the first race; because it ended under caution, no margin of victory was recorded.|$|E

She also states that she constantly had a feeling that she lacked something: [...] "a deficit.

The second time occurs as Bendrix searches for his former lover, Sarah Miles: “There was an A.B.C in the High Street <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> that. She wasn’t there” (Book Four, Chapter 1).

What made me excited? And I remembered art, that I loved going to museums and I loved looking at paintings, loved listening to music. Those things came from my mother, who took me to concerts and museums. I remembered Grandma and the blocks, and just on a hunch, I tried some architecture classes."

2500|$|Mark Wahlberg as Jack Salmon, Susie's father, {{who becomes}} obsessed with his daughter's murder case. Wahlberg stated that {{his role in}} the film {{encouraged}} him to be a more cautious parent with his three children and to talk to them more about [...] "not talking to strangers." [...] Before Wahlberg's casting, Ryan Gosling was set to play the role but dropped out of the film in October 2007, one month before filming. Gosling had gained weight and grown a beard for the role, but said, [...] "The age of the character versus my real age [...] was always a concern of mine. Peter [...] <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to make it work and ultimately it just didn't. I think the film is much better off with Mark Wahlberg in that role."

2500|$|In a July 2012 {{interview}} with the Independent newspaper, Plant stated he [...] "eloped and ran off to Texas" [...] with Band of Joy co-vocalist, American singer Patty Griffin.

Actually, according to a July 2012 Ultimate Classic Rock article, Plant and Griffin had been dating for over a year, spending half of their time together in Austin, Texas. On 23 August 2014, The Independent, a UK publication, indicated Plant had broken up with Patty Griffin: [...] "“Patty <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> a sort of zig-zag across the Atlantic,” Plant told the publication, “but she didn’t share my penchant for cider and she used to marvel at the Black Country character I became after four pints of Thatchers.

2500|$|In {{preparing}} for the recording of episodes, long and acrimonious shouting matches occurred between Milligan and BBC managers {{as he tried to}} get his own way. Was he a diva?

Sound effects were 'a knock on the door and tramps on gravel'– that was it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to transform it." [...] Using techniques already developed by the drama department, he went on to give the show an indelible sense of reality, going {{out of his way to}} achieve maximum believability by the use of FX (live sound effects) and Grams (pre-recorded sound effects), making the show the first comedic production of its kind to try actively to persuade the listeners that the happenings were real, and especially to create alternate realities or surreal audio imagery that would be impossible to realise visually. This approach was echoed on television in Monty Python's Flying Circus which began in 1969, through the surreal animation inserts created by Terry Gilliam.|$|E
