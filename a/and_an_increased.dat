50|$|There is {{evidence}} that system Xc- may serve as an entry point for neurotoxins and viruses. β-N-methyl-L-alanine (BMAA) is an environmental neurotoxin that can act on system Xc- and inhibit cystine uptake.

BMAA can also be transported by system Xc- <b>and</b> lead to <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> in glutamate release <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> in excitotoxicity.

5|$|Antibiotics are {{frequently}} {{applied to the}} skin or taken orally to treat acne and are thought to work due to their antimicrobial activity against P. acnes {{and their ability to}} reduce inflammation. With the widespread use of antibiotics for acne <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>increased</b> frequency of antibiotic-resistant P. acnes worldwide, antibiotics are becoming less effective, especially macrolide antibiotics such as topical erythromycin. Commonly used antibiotics, either applied to the skin or taken orally, include clindamycin, erythromycin, metronidazole, sulfacetamide, and tetracyclines such as doxycycline and minocycline. When antibiotics are applied to the skin, they are typically used for mild to moderately severe acne. Antibiotics taken orally are generally considered to be more effective than topical antibiotics, and produce faster resolution of inflammatory acne lesions than topical applications. Topical and oral antibiotics are not recommended for use together.|$|E
5|$|Care must {{be taken}} with medications, as side effects may be more common and harder to {{evaluate}} in individuals with AS, and tests of drugs' effectiveness against comorbid conditions routinely exclude individuals from the autism spectrum. Abnormalities in metabolism, cardiac conduction times, <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>increased</b> risk of type 2 diabetes have been raised as concerns with these medications, along with serious long-term neurological side effects. SSRIs can lead to manifestations of behavioral activation such as increased impulsivity, aggression, and sleep disturbance. Weight gain and fatigue are commonly reported side effects of risperidone, which may also lead to increased risk for extrapyramidal symptoms such as restlessness and dystonia and increased serum prolactin levels. Sedation and weight gain are more common with olanzapine, which has also been linked with diabetes. Sedative side-effects in school-age children have ramifications for classroom learning.

5|$|Environmental hazards {{induced by}} humans also puts {{sirenians}} at risk. Sirenians, especially the West Indian manatee, face high mortality from watercraft collision, {{and about half}} of all West Indian manatee deaths are caused by watercraft collisions. An increased usage of hydroelectric power and subsequent damming of rivers increase waterway traffic, which can lead to vessel collisions, and manatees may become entangled in navigational locks. The urbanized coastline of areas such as the Caribbean and Australia can result in the decline of seagrass populations. Reliable areas of warm water in Florida are generally the result of discharge from power plants, but newer plants with more efficient cooling systems may disrupt the pattern of warm water refuges, <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>increased</b> demand for artesian springs for water, the natural source of warm water, decreases the number of warm water refuges. Sirenians can be caught as bycatch from fisheries, and they can be seen as pests with the interference of local fishermen and the destruction of their nets. African manatees have also been known to venture into rice paddies and destroy the crops during the rainy season, and these confrontations with locals may lead to intentional culling of the manatees.|$|E
5|$|Europe was {{immersed}} in power struggles on many different fronts. The Christian Church split along Latin Orthodox lines in 1054 after centuries of disagreement {{leading to a}} permanent division called the East–West Schism. Following the Gregorian Reform, an assertive, reformist papacy attempted to increase its power and influence over the laity. Beginning around 1075 and continuing during the First Crusade, the Investiture Controversy was a power struggle between Church and state in medieval Europe over whether the Catholic Church or the Holy Roman Empire held the right to appoint church officials and other clerics. Antipope Clement III was an alternative pope {{for most of this}} period, and Pope Urban spent much of his early pontificate in exile from Rome. The result was intense piety <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>increased</b> interest in religious affairs amongst the general population in Catholic Europe and religious propaganda by the Papacy advocating a just war to reclaim Palestine from the Muslims. Participation in a crusade was seen as a form of penance that could counterbalance sin.|$|E

40|$|The author {{studied the}} trends of serum cholesterol, lipoprotein, and proteins, mainly in leukemia and various blood diseases, and {{obtained}} the following results. The {{subjects of the}} present investigation were the cases diagnosed as such by bonemarrow tissue cultures and hematological examinations. 1. The cholesterol value in leukemia is almost at the normal level, showing not any marked difference {{by the type of}} the disease, but the ratio of β- and α- lipoproteins generally presents <b>an</b> <b>increasing</b> tendency. <b>As</b> for the trend of serum proteins on the whole a decrease in total concentration <b>and</b> albumin <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> in γ-globulin are the common changes, and the differences by the type can not be considered to be marked. Only in mono cytic leukemia the decrease in albumin and the increase in γ-globulin are marked. 2. Hypoplastic anemia shows the normal level of cholesterol, but {{it is interesting to note}} that the total cholesterol, ester cholesterol as well as the ratio of ester to total chole sterol are all in the decreasing order of type I>type III>type IV. Moreover, a decrease in α-globulin <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> in γ-globulin in the serum protein content can be observed. As for the other anemias Banti's disease shows <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> in the lipoprotein ratio, a marked decrease in serum protein, <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> in γ-globulin; idiopathic hypochromic anemia a decrease in serum proteins; a single case of hemolytic anemia <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> in cholesterol, <b>a</b> decrease in the serum protein content and albumin fraction <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> in γ-globulin. In addition, in one case of hookworm anemia an extremely high value of the lipoprotein ratio, a decrease in albumin <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> in γ-globulin can be recognized. 3. In cancer a decrease in cholesterol, serum protein content, and albumin fraction <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> in γ-globulin can be recognized, but as for the differences in the site only hapatoma shows a marked change in serum protein and fractions. 4. Choresterol in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura is decreased, and in one of them a decrease in albumin of serum protein fractions <b>and</b> <b>a</b> slight <b>increase</b> in γ-and β- globulin can be observed. In lymphogranulomatosis a decrease in albumin <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> in γ-globulin are marked, and in one case of reticulum cell sarcoma a decrease in cholesterol, the serum protein content, and albumin as well as <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> in γ-globulin can be recognized...|$|R
