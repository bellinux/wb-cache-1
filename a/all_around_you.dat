500|$|Final Destination 3 was {{released}} on DVD on July 25, 2006, in widescreen and fullscreen. Special features include audio commentary, a deleted scene, three documentaries, the theatrical trailer and an original animated video. Audio commentary is by Wong, Morgan and cinematographer Robert Mclachlan. The deleted scene is an extended version of Wendy and Kevin's discussion after they are questioned by the police. The first documentary, Dead Teenager Movie, examines the history of slasher films. The second, Kill Shot: Making Final Destination 3, focuses on {{the making of the}} film and includes interviews with the cast and crew. The third documentary, Severed Piece, discusses the film's special effects, pyrotechnics and gore effects. A seven-minute cartoon, It's <b>All</b> <b>Around</b> <b>You,</b> explains the various ways people can die. Special DVD editions labelled [...] "Thrill Ride Edition" [...] also include an optional [...] "Choose Their Fate" [...] feature, allowing viewers to make decisions at several points in the film. Most provide only a minor alternate scene, but the first choice allows the viewer to stop the four characters from getting on the roller coaster before the premonition, thus ending the film immediately. Final Destination 3 {{was released}} digitally on streaming platforms Amazon Video, Google Play and Netflix.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{the release}} of their debut album, the band {{recorded}} two demos in 1999 and 2000. In mid-2001, {{it was reported that}} Meacham had attempted suicide by drinking excessive amounts of cough syrup. The attempt affected the band's Take Action Tour. During his hospitalization he remained in poor condition and was replaced by Dameon Ash. In an interview, lead singer M. Shadows said of Meacham that [...] "he perma-fried his brain and was in a mental institution for a long time, and when you have someone in your band who does that, it ruins everything that's going on <b>all</b> <b>around</b> <b>you,</b> and it makes {{you want to do something}} to prevent it from happening to other people." [...] Avenged Sevenfold's debut album, Sounding the Seventh Trumpet, was recorded when the band members were in their late teens and still in high school. It was originally released on their first label, Good Life Recordings in 2001. When lead guitarist Synyster Gates joined the band after the album was released, the introductory track [...] "To End the Rapture" [...] was re-recorded featuring a full band element. The album was subsequently re-released on Hopeless Records in 2002. The band started to receive recognition, performing with bands such as Mushroomhead and Shadows Fall and playing on the Take Action Tour.|$|E
