40|$|Summaryδ-opioid receptors (DORs) form heteromers with μ-opioid receptors (MORs) and {{negatively}} regulate MOR-mediated spinal analgesia. However, the underlying mechanism remains largely unclear. The present {{study shows that}} the activity of MORs can be enhanced by preventing MORs from DOR-mediated codegradation. Treatment with DOR-specific agonists led to endocytosis of both DORs and MORs. These receptors were further processed for ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation, resulting in a reduction of surface MORs. Such effects were attenuated by treatment with an interfering peptide containing the first transmembrane domain of MOR (MORTM 1), which interacted with DORs and disrupted the MOR/DOR interaction. Furthermore, the systemically <b>applied</b> <b>fusion</b> protein consisting of MORTM 1 and TAT at the C terminus could disrupt the MOR/DOR interaction in the mouse spinal cord, enhance the morphine analgesia, and reduce the antinociceptive tolerance to morphine. Thus, dissociation of MORs from DORs in the cell membrane is a potential strategy to improve opioid analgesic therapies...|$|E

The rate of cooling (under controlled conditions) was found to have a significant influence on the relative distribution of the three modifications: the lower the cooling rate, the higher the relative amount of the extended modification. Crystallization from organic solution yielded mainly the once folded form. The presence of diazepam and temazepam influenced the relative amount of the different PEG 6000 modifications.

40|$|We {{present the}} sensor-fusion results {{obtained}} from measurements within the European research project ground explosive ordinance detection (GEODE) system that strives for the realisation of a vehicle-mounted, multi-sensor, anti-personnel landmine-detection system for humanitarian de-mining. The system has three sensor types: {{a metal detector}} (MD), an infrared camera (IR), and a ground penetrating radar (GPR). The output of the sensors is processed to produce confidence levels on a grid covering the test-bed. A confidence level expresses a confidence or belief in a landmine detection on a certain position. The grid with confidence levels is the input for the decision-level sensor-fusion and provides a co-registration of the sensors. The <b>applied</b> <b>fusion</b> methods are naive Bayes' approaches, Dempster-Shafer theory, fuzzy probabilities, a rule-based method, and voting techniques.

40|$|Images {{and videos}} are often {{characterized}} by multiple types of local descriptors such as SIFT, HOG and HOF, {{each of which}} describes certain aspects of object feature. Recognition systems benefit from fusing multiple types of these descriptors. Two widely <b>applied</b> <b>fusion</b> pipelines are descriptor concatenation and kernel average. The first one is effective when different descriptors are strongly corre-lated, while the second one is probably better when de-scriptors are relatively independent. In practice, however, different descriptors are neither fully independent nor fully correlated, and previous fusion methods may not be satis-fying. In this paper, we propose a new global representa-tion, Multi-View Super Vector (MVSV), which is composed of relatively independent components derived {{from a pair of}} descriptors. Kernel average is then applied on these com-ponents to produce recognition result. To obtain MVSV, we develop a generative mixture model of probabilistic canoni-cal correlation analyzers (M-PCCA), and utilize the hidden factors and gradient vectors of M-PCCA to construct MVSV for video representation. Experiments on video based ac-tion recognition tasks show that MVSV achieves promising results, and outperforms FV and VLAD with descriptor con-catenation or kernel average fusion strategy. 1...|$|E

In this context, image fusion {{plays an important role}} since it effectively combines complementary image content to enhance information contained in the individual datasets. This article presents an overview of the existing fusion techniques and their achievements for Earth scientists. This research started off with the compilation of a database on remote sensing image fusion journal publications.

40|$|The modern {{software}} development landscape {{has seen a}} shift in focus toward mobile applications as tablets and smart-phones near ubiquitous adoption. Due to this trend, the complexity of these “apps ” has been increasing, making de-velopment and maintenance challenging. Additionally, cur-rent bug tracking systems {{are not able to}} effectively support construction of reports with actionable information that di-rectly lead to a bug’s resolution. To address the need for an improved reporting system, we introduce a novel solution, called FUSION, that helps users auto-complete reproduction steps in bug reports for mobile apps. FUSION links user-provided information to program ar-tifacts extracted through static and dynamic analysis per-formed before testing or release. The approach that FU-SION employs is generalizable to other current mobile soft-ware platforms, and constitutes a new method by which off-device bug reporting can be conducted for mobile software projects. We evaluated FUSION by conducting a study that quantitatively and qualitatively measured the user experi-ence of the system for both reporting and reproducing bugs, as well as the quality of the bug reports it produces. In a study involving 28 participants we <b>applied</b> <b>FUSION</b> to sup-port the maintenance tasks of reporting and reproducing defects on 15 real-world bugs found in 14 open source An-droid apps.

We investigated the effect of 2 different bone grafts and amniotic fluid application on radiologically and histologically evaluated vertebral fusion in an experimental rat model. Materials and methods: Forty-eight 24 -week-old Sprague Dawley rats were included and assigned into 1 of 4 groups: allograft group, allograft plus human amniotic fluid group, demineralized bone matrix (DBM) group, or DBM plus human amniotic fluid group. After decortication and L 4 –L 6 spinal fusion, study treatments were <b>applied.</b> <b>Fusion</b> in each rat was examined radiologically and histologically 8 weeks after the intervention. Results: The group that received only allograft had better radiologic scores (median = 3. 5; range = 3 – 4) {{when compared with the}} group that received only DBM (median = 2; range = 1 – 4) (P = 0. 002); however, histologic scores did not differ. When amniotic fluid was added to the grafting, allograft-based treatments performed better than DBM-based treatments both on radiologic (median = 4; range = 3 – 4 vs median = 3; range = 3 – 4; P = 0. 003) and histologic (median = 7; range = 6 – 7 vs median = 5; range = 3 – 6; P < 0. 001) evaluation. Addition of amniotic fluid did not result in better outcomes in the rats that received DBM-based treatments but based on histologic evaluation, rats that received allograft-based treatments benefited from this application.

40|$|It is {{commonly}} acknowledged that using Internet applications {{is an integral}} part of an individual’s everyday life, with more than three billion users now using Internet services across the world; and this number is growing every year. Unfortunately, with this rise in Internet use comes an increasing rise in cyber-related crime. Whilst significant effort has been expended on protecting systems from outside attack, only more recently have researchers sought to develop countermeasures against insider attack. However, for an organisation, the detection of an attack is merely the start of a process that requires them to investigate and attribute the attack to an individual (or group of individuals). The investigation of an attack typically revolves around the analysis of network traffic, in order to better understand the nature of the traffic flows and importantly resolves this to an IP address of the insider. However, with mobile computing and Dynamic Host Control Protocol (DHCP), which results in Internet Protocol (IP) addresses changing frequently, it is particularly challenging to resolve the traffic back to a specific individual. The thesis explores the feasibility of profiling network traffic in a biometric-manner in order to be able to identify users independently of the IP address. In order to maintain privacy and the issue of encryption (which exists on an increasing volume of network traffic), the proposed approach utilises data derived only from the metadata of packets, not the payload. The research proposed a novel feature extraction approach focussed upon extracting user-oriented application-level features from the wider network traffic. An investigation across nine of the most common web applications (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Dropbox, Google, Outlook, Skype, BBC and Wikipedia) was undertaken to determine whether such high-level features could be derived from the low-level network signals. The results showed that whilst some user interactions were not possible to extract due to the complexities of the resulting web application, a majority of them were. Having developed a feature extraction process that focussed more upon the user, rather than machine-to-machine traffic, the research sought to use this information to determine whether a behavioural profile could be developed to enable identification of the users. Network traffic of 27 users over 2 months was collected and processed using the aforementioned feature extraction process. Over 140 million packets were collected and processed into 45 user-level interactions across the nine applications. The results from behavioural profiling showed that the system is capable of identifying users, with an average True Positive Identification Rate (TPIR) in the top three applications of 87. 4 %, 75 % and 61. 9 % respectively. Whilst the initial study provided some encouraging results, the research continued to develop further refinements which could improve the performance. Two techniques were <b>applied,</b> <b>fusion</b> and timeline analysis techniques. The former approach sought to fuse the output of the classification stage to better incorporate and manage the variability of the classification and resulting decision phases of the biometric system. The latter approach sought to capitalise on the fact that whilst the IP address is not reliable over a period of time due to reallocation, over shorter timeframes (e. g. a few minutes) it is likely to reliable and map to the same user. The results for fusion across the top three applications were 93. 3 %, 82. 5 % and 68. 9 %. The overall performance adding in the timeline analysis (with a 240 second time window) on average across all applications was 72. 1 %. Whilst in terms of biometric identification in the normal sense, 72. 1 % is not outstanding, its use within this problem of attributing misuse to an individual provides the investigator with an enormous advantage over existing approaches. At best, it will provide him with a user’s specific traffic and at worst allow them to significantly reduce the volume of traffic to be analysed...|$|E
