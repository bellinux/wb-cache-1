5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} the coup, Taraki and other party leaders initiated other radical Marxist policies that challenged both traditional Afghan values and well-established traditional power structures in rural areas. Taraki introduced women to political life and legislated an end to forced marriage. However, he ruled over <b>a</b> <b>nation</b> <b>with</b> a deep Islamic religious culture and {{a long history of}} resistance to any type of strong centralized governmental control, and consequently many of these reforms were not actually implemented nationwide. Popular resentment of Taraki's drastic policy changes triggered surging unrest throughout the country, reducing government control to only a limited area. The strength of this anti-reform backlash would ultimately lead to the Afghan civil war.|$|E
5|$|Addressing the mercantilist {{belief that}} {{monetary}} intervention {{could cause a}} perpetually favourable balance of trade, Cantillon developed a specie-flow mechanism foreshadowing future international monetary equilibrium theories. He suggested that in countries with a high quantity of money in circulation, prices will increase and therefore become less competitive in relation to countries {{where there is a}} relative scarcity of money. Thus, Cantillon also held that increases in the supply of money, regardless of the source, cause increases in the price level and therefore reduce the competitiveness of a particular nation's industry in relation to <b>a</b> <b>nation</b> <b>with</b> lower prices. However, Cantillon did not believe that international markets tended toward equilibrium, and instead suggested that government hoard specie to avoid rising prices and falling competitiveness. Furthermore, he suggested that a favourable balance of trade can be maintained by offering a better product and retaining qualitative competitiveness. Cantillon's preference towards a favourable balance of trade possibly stemmed from the mercantilist belief in exchange being a zero-sum game, in which one party gains at the expense of another.|$|E

25|$|The Philippines {{has been}} the most vocal against Chinese incursions in the dispute, even {{bringing}} its case against China to a United Nations international tribunal in the Hague, the first case filed by a nation against China. Vietnam, Japan, and other Western countries, especially the United States, have strongly supported the Philippines. Vietnam, bordered both by land and sea with China, has also claims all the Spratly Islands. This dispute focuses on the Paracel Islands, which China has occupied following the Battle of the Paracel Islands, in 1974. Brunei, claiming only one reef, has been silent on the issue ever since it began, mostly because of its trade with China. Malaysia, <b>a</b> <b>nation</b> <b>with</b> deep economic ties to China, and <b>a</b> <b>nation</b> <b>with</b> billions in Chinese investment, has remained neutral and 'China-friendly' over the conflict. This despite China claiming various reefs and islands in the Spratlys as well as most of its territorial waters and exclusive economic zones in Borneo.|$|E

25|$|With the {{publication}} of The Influence of Sea Power upon History, 1660–1783 in 1890, Navy Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan was immediately hailed as the world's outstanding naval theorist by the leaders of Europe. Roosevelt paid very close attention to Mahan's emphasis that only <b>a</b> <b>nation</b> <b>with</b> the world's most powerful fleet could dominate the world's oceans, exert its diplomacy to the fullest, and defend its own borders. He incorporated Mahan's ideas into his views on naval strategy {{for the remainder of}} his career.|$|E
25|$|A {{growing economy}} that creates jobs at rate faster than {{population}} growth, offers people opportunities and incentive to relocate from poor slum to more developed neighborhoods. Economic stagnation, in contrast, creates uncertainties and risks for the poor, {{encouraging people to}} stay in the slums. Economic stagnation in <b>a</b> <b>nation</b> <b>with</b> a growing population reduces per capita disposal income in urban and rural areas, increasing urban and rural poverty. Rising rural poverty also encourages migration to urban areas. A poorly performing economy, in other words, increases poverty and rural-to-urban migration, thereby increasing slums.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{most of its}} history, Poland has {{experienced}} only very limited immigration from abroad; this trend can be largely attributed to Poland's rejection of slavery and {{to a lack of}} overseas colonies as well as occupation of its territories during much of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Despite this, the country has for a long time been regarded as having a very tolerant society, which affords equal rights to all people no matter what their ethnic background. This can be said to stem largely from the reign of King Casimir III the Great and his acceptance of Poland's Jewish community, in a time when most of Europe recessed into antisemitic moods and actions. The history of Jews in Poland exemplifies peaceful co-existence of <b>a</b> <b>nation</b> <b>with</b> a particular ethnic group.|$|E

25|$|Australia, <b>a</b> <b>nation</b> <b>with</b> a long {{record of}} using IRV for the {{election}} of legislative bodies, has had representation in its parliament broadly similar to that expected by plurality methods. Medium-sized parties, such as the National Party of Australia, can co-exist with coalition partners such as the Liberal Party of Australia, and can compete against it without fear of losing seats to other parties due to vote splitting. IRV {{is more likely to}} result in legislatures where no single party has an absolute majority of seats (a hung parliament), but does not generally produce as fragmented a legislature as a fully proportional method, such as is used for the House of Representatives of the Netherlands or the New Zealand House of Representatives, where coalitions of numerous small parties are needed for a majority.|$|E
25|$|Some 6,500 Royal Lao Army {{troops out}} of its 30,000 {{personnel}} were surrounded by North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces. Because Laos was <b>a</b> <b>nation</b> <b>with</b> a nearly nonexistent road network, the RLAF's first mission was aerial resupply of these besieged troops. The French air crews operated the transports while Laotians were being trained. The first aggressive action by the new air force was the aerial movement of Royalist troops to the Plaine de Jarres in early 1955. These Royalist ground troops on the Plaine de Jarres {{became part of the}} air bridge resupply effort. In late 1955, 22 Lao students departed to France and Morocco for aviation training. One of these cadets was Thao Ma, an ex-paratrooper who later rose to command the Royal Lao Air Force.|$|E
25|$|The {{octane rating}} became {{important}} as the military sought higher output for aircraft engines in the late 1930s and the 1940s. A higher octane rating allows a higher compression ratio or supercharger boost, and thus higher temperatures and pressures, which translate to higher power output. Some scientists even predicted that <b>a</b> <b>nation</b> <b>with</b> a good supply of high octane gasoline would have the advantage in air power. In 1943, the Rolls-Royce Merlin aero engine produced 1,320 horsepower (984kW) using 100 RON fuel from a modest 27 liter displacement. By the time of Operation Overlord during World War II both the RAF and USAAF were conducting some operations in Europe using 150 RON fuel (100/150 avgas), obtained by adding 2.5% aniline to 100 octane avgas. By this time the Rolls-Royce Merlin 66 was developing 2,000hp using this fuel.|$|E

25|$|Mark N. Franklin {{argues that}} salience, the {{perceived}} effect {{that an individual}} vote will have on how the country is run, has {{a significant effect on}} turnout. He presents Switzerland as an example of <b>a</b> <b>nation</b> <b>with</b> low salience. The nation's administration is highly decentralized, so {{that the federal government has}} limited powers. The government invariably consists of a coalition of parties, and the power wielded by a party is far more closely linked to its position relative to the coalition than to the number of votes it received. Important decisions are placed before the population in a referendum. Individual votes for the federal legislature are thus unlikely to have a significant effect on the nation, which probably explains the low average turnouts in that country. By contrast Malta, with one of the world's highest voter turnouts, has a single legislature that holds a near monopoly on political power. Malta has a two-party system in which a small swing in votes can completely alter the executive. On the other hand, countries with a two party system can experience low turnout if large numbers of potential voters perceive little real difference between the main parties. Voters' perceptions of fairness also have an important effect on salience. If voters feel that the result of an election is more likely to be determined by fraud and corruption than by the will of the people, fewer people will vote.|$|E

500|$|The transcontinental {{railroad}} {{project was}} heavily subsidised by the government. The CPR was granted [...] of land {{along the route}} of the railroad, and $25,000,000 from the government. In addition, the government was pledged to build $32,000,000 of other railways to support the CPR. The entire project was extremely costly, especially for <b>a</b> <b>nation</b> <b>with</b> only 4.1million people in 1881. Between 1880 and 1885, as the railway was slowly built, the CPR repeatedly came close to financial ruin. Not only was the terrain in the Rocky Mountains difficult, the route north of Lake Superior proved treacherous, as tracks and engines sank into the muskeg. When Canadian guarantees of the CPR's bonds failed to make them salable in a declining economy, Macdonald obtained a loan to the corporation from the Treasury—the bill authorizing it passed the Senate just before the firm would have become insolvent.|$|E

Under the direction of Major Edward Sabine of the Royal Artillery, a multi-year measuring project began, with the results {{to be published in}} 1838. As the measurements were being made a number of proposals were put forth to expand the program worldwide. In 1836 the German explorer and naturalist Alexander von Humboldt wrote to Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex, then President of the Royal Society, stating that a formal program was important to <b>a</b> <b>nation</b> <b>with</b> dominions spread across the globe. At the seventh meeting of the British Association in Liverpool in 1837, Sabine declared that [...] "the magnetism of the earth cannot be counted less than {{one of the most important}} branches of the physical history of the planet we inhabit" [...] and mapping its variations would be [...] "regarded by our contemporaries and by posterity as a fitting enterprise of a maritime people; and a worthy achievement of a nation which has ever sought to rank foremost in every arduous undertaking".|$|E
500|$|While {{discussing}} {{the origin of}} the title [...] "Rhythm Nation", Jackson stated she first uttered the phrase during a conversation with her producers.

[...] She based the idea on the prevalence of various youth groups and organizations that are formed as a means of creating a common identity. The usage of the number [...] "1814" [...] represents the year the national anthem [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner" [...] was written. Rolling Stone emphasized the core concept is further explored in the album's opening pledge (the first track of the recording), which states: [...] "We are <b>a</b> <b>nation</b> <b>with</b> no geographic boundaries, bound together through our beliefs. We are like-minded individuals, sharing a common vision, pushing toward a world rid of color-lines." [...] Several critics noted that [...] "R" [...] (Rhythm) and [...] "N" [...] (Nation) are the eighteenth and fourteenth letters of the alphabet, though Jackson said this was coincidental.|$|E
500|$|Saint Joan (1923) drew {{widespread}} praise {{both for}} Shaw and for Sybil Thorndike, {{for whom he}} wrote the title role and who created the part in Britain. In {{the view of the}} commentator Nicholas Grene, Shaw's Joan, a [...] "no-nonsense mystic, Protestant and nationalist before her time" [...] is among the 20th century's classic leading female roles. The Apple Cart (1929), was Shaw's last popular success. He gave both that play and its successor, Too True to Be Good (1931), the subtitle [...] "A political extravaganza", although the two works differ greatly in their themes; the first presents the politics of <b>a</b> <b>nation</b> (<b>with</b> a brief royal love-scene as an interlude) and the second, in Judith Evans's words, [...] "is concerned with the social mores of the individual, and is nebulous." [...] Shaw's plays of the 1930s were written in the shadow of worsening national and international political events. Once again, with On the Rocks (1933) and The Simpleton of the Unexpected Isles (1934), a political comedy with a clear plot was followed by an introspective drama. The first play portrays a British prime minister considering, but finally rejecting, the establishment of a dictatorship; the second is concerned with polygamy and eugenics and ends with the Day of Judgement.|$|E
