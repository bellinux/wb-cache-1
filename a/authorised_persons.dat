50|$|In 1981, Kombo Moyana left UNCTAD to join Mr Bernard Chidzero, former Deputy Secretary General of UNCTAD and Minister of Finance in Zimbabwe at the time. Other {{members of}} the Branch had to cover Sub-Saharan Africa waiting for the {{replacement}} of Mr Moyana. In particular, Mr Cosío-Pascal covered Liberia, Madagascar and Zaire (now Democratic Republic of Congo). Four countries, in 1981, agreed to form the initial DMFAS pool—contributing from their national United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) funds to a common technical cooperation fund with UNCTAD—that allowed {{the development of the}} first version. Those countries were two from Latin America: Bolivia and Costa Rica and two from Africa: Liberia and Madagascar. These resources allowed hiring a systems analyst, Pekka Sankala Finland and a programmer, Ms Cameron Turkey. These two persons, jointly with Mr Cosio-Pascal, team leader, and Mr Baert, formed the first DMFAS Programme team. The first DMFAS version, finalised in early 1982, was developed in COBOL and designed to run on an IBM System/370 mainframe computer. This very first version was installed at the National Institute of Statistics of Bolivia, which was the only institution in Bolivia owning an IBM 370 computer. However, at the time, the country was governed by a Military Junta, the Head of State being General Luis García Meza, and it was decided by the Bolivian authorities that external debt data was classified information, and no one should be able to access it, {{with the exception of the}} <b>authorised</b> <b>persons</b> belonging to the International Department of the Central Bank of Bolivia. Therefore, it was requested to UNCTAD to develop a DMFAS version for Personal Computer (PC) that should be at the Central Bank with limited access to authorised staffs. This was a very fortunate request, because PC’s prices subsequently went down, being by far less expensive than mainframe computers, and since all DMFAS versions have be created to run on PCs. The second version of DMFAS, the PC version, was installed at the Central Bank of Bolivia, the Central Bank of Costa Rica and the Central Bank of Madagascar. It was never installed in Liberia due to the recrudescence of civil war.|$|E
