5000|$|In 1315 {{there was}} a Romanesque church in Schwaben built out of brick. In 1474 a small Gothic church was consecrated. It was already known as Saint Margaret's at that time. In 1671, {{building}} work was begun on the new Pfarrkirche St. Margaret (Saint Margaret’s Parish Church) 20 metres southeast of its forerunner. The work took ten years. The first set of bells consisted of three new (in 1684) ones and one other taken from the old church (1585). In 1704, the Rosenkranzbruderschaft - the [...] "Rosary Brotherhood", a lay Dominican order - endowed the Marienaltar ("Mary's Altar"). In 1718 the Jungfrauenaltar ("Virgins' Altar", with Saints Agatha, Barbara and Catharine), the Josefialtar ("Joseph's Altar") and the Antoniusaltar ("Anthony's Altar") were built. The brewer Trappentreu had the high altar installed in 1723 with a new top and tabernacle, all richly gilt. In 1862 the church was renovated, at which time the original high altarpiece was removed. Its whereabouts remain unknown to this day. In 1873 a new organ was built. The country couple Hundseder endowed a complete new set of bronze bells in 1911, poured at the bellworks in Erding with the [...] "Salve Regina" [...] motif in the <b>arrangement</b> <b>D</b> - F# - A - B. While the church managed to keep its bells in the First World War, in 1942 they were seized and melted down for war requirements. In 1948 the parish church received a substitute set of bells poured from steel in Bochum, with the same tonal arrangement as the old ones, which is still in use today. In 1975 came yet another, quite extravagant, restoration, whereby the church's south side, facing Erdinger Straße, had to be deeply underpinned owing to the vibration from traffic. In the mid-1990s, the church tower was threatening to tear away from the nave. A woodworm infestation was successfully dealt with in 1999. As of 2015 a further expensive restoration is expected as the stuccoed vault is showing threatening cracks apparently caused by bell vibrations.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} {{the operation of}} the windward mole, regarding the protection it provides to the basin and widely to the port of Kolympari from incident waves of main direction and specifically from waves of northern direction. The likelihood of optimising the mole arrangement, via extension of the mole, is also studied. A satisfactory answer to the problems that wind-generated waves create can be given by laboratorial research of various solutions in natural effigy, {{as well as with the}} use of numerical models. The latter can impress the conditions of the harbours‟ area of study in a very satisfactory degree and with the realisation of numerical applications the most optimal possible solution for the protection of the harbour can be found. The windward mole of the port of Kolympari constitutes an outer harbour construction with sloping sides, according to the new arrangement that was proposed by the municipality of Kolympari. In the particular study, the new <b>arrangement</b> (<b>D</b> 3) that was proposed by the municipality, the existing <b>arrangement</b> (<b>D</b> 1) and an additional <b>arrangement</b> (<b>D</b> 2) are examined. Nine one-dimensional waves were selected to be simulated and their choice was made by a previous experiment that was carried out in the Laboratoty of Harbour Works of the National Technical University of Athens. The simulation of the wave phenomena in the area of study was achieved using the numerical model MIKE 21 BW, which measured the height of waves that reaches 7 characteristic points inside and outside the basin, depending on the initial waves‟ characteristics, for the three different arrangements of the windward mole. According to the results of the numerical simulations and after their processing and analysis, it is concluded that the existing <b>arrangement</b> (<b>D</b> 1) of the windward mole provides enough protection to the port, while the second <b>arrangement</b> (<b>D</b> 2), in which the mole is extended by 50 m, constrains the wave height to a larger extent. In the third <b>arrangement</b> (<b>D</b> 3), in which the windward mole is extended from the second <b>arrangement</b> (<b>D</b> 2) by additional 50 m under a corner of 30 ν to south, it is observed that the height of waves is constrained to even greater extent, providing the most optimal protection in the port. Moreover, it is observed that for a particular height of incident waves, as long as the wave period increases, the wave height also increases inside the basin. Finally, according to the wind data, for the existing <b>arrangement</b> (<b>D</b> 1) of the windward mole, the port is not functional for 7 days of the year. Παναγιώτης Μπινίσκος 158 σ...|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{arrangements of}} rational sections over curves. They generalize line arrangements on P^ 2. Each <b>arrangement</b> of <b>d</b> sections defines a single curve in P^d- 2 through the Kapranov's construction of M̅_ 0,d+ 1. We show a one-to-one correspondence between <b>arrangements</b> of <b>d</b> sections and irreducible curves in M_ 0,d+ 1, giving also correspondences for two distinguished subclasses: transversal and simple crossing. Then, we associate to each arrangement A (and so to each irreducible curve in M_ 0,d+ 1) several families of nonsingular projective surfaces X of general type with Chern numbers asymptotically proportional to various log Chern numbers defined by A. For example, for extended families over the complex numbers, one has {{that any such}} X is of positive index and π_ 1 (X) = π_ 1 (A̅), where A̅ is the normalization of A. In this way, any rational curve in M_ 0,d+ 1 produces simply connected surfaces with 2 < c_ 1 ^ 2 (X) /c_ 2 (X) < 3. Inequalities like these come from log Chern inequalities, which are in general connected to geometric height inequalities (see Appendix). Along the way, we show examples of étale simply connected surfaces of general type in any characteristic violating any sort of Miyaoka-Yau inequality.

Powered by a 3 hp single-phase electric motor, the machine was constructed with materials being available locally at affordable costs.

40|$|Abstract: The {{number of}} {{external}} facets {{of a simple}} arrangement depends on its combinatorial type. A computation framework for {{counting the number of}} external facets is introduced and improved by exploiting the combinatorial structure of the set of sign vectors of the cells of the arrangement. 1 Background and introduction n hyperplanes in dimension d form a hyperplane arrangement. An hyperplane arrangement is called simple if n ≥ d and any d hyperplanes intersect at a unique distinct point. A facet of a hyperplane arrangement belongs to either zero, one or two bounded cells. We call a facet external if it belongs to exactly one bounded cell. It has been shown that the line <b>arrangement</b> (<b>d</b> = 2) that minimizes the number of external facets maximizes the average diameter, but it is not known whether this relation holds for general dimension. The computational results for small n and d will give us a better insight into this problem. One of the computational combi-natorial problems herein is as following. Given a simple arrangement Ad,n represented by n inequalities with d variables, count its external facets. As an example, Figure 1 shows the enumeration of the 6 line arrangements formed by 5 lines, or A 2, 5. Among the 6 arrangements, Ao has 8 external facets, which is minimal. The star-shaped arrangement at the bottom right corner has 10 external facets and all the others have 9. Let Ad,n be a simple arrangement formed by hyperplanes h 1, h 2, [...] ., hn. Each hyperplane partition the space into 2 sides: positive and negative. By giving each hyperplane of Ad,n an orientation indicating which side is positive, each cell is associated with a sign vector whose ith element (i = 1, [...] ., n) indicates which side of hyperplane hi the cell is located on (+ and − for positive and negative side respectively). See Figure 2 for the sign vectors of all the cells of Ao 2, 4. ...|$|E

However, the r ising cost of energy generation, the deplet ion and the unpredictability of availability of energy resources and the adverse impacts of energy generation and its usage on the environment, have been causing much anxiety and great concern from recent t imes. Within this context, buildings have been considered as one of the largest consumers of energy and have therefore been ident ified as one of the target areas for energy conservat ion. Statistics have revealed that the proportion of energy consumed for light ing in buildings is much greater than what is consumed ind ividually for providing thermal comfort or other ancillary services. Therefore adding of daylight for space, architectural designing has become a vital overcomes above problems. Adding adequate sunlight, integration with artificial light ing and reducing the cooling load on HVAC systems are effect ively providing wide energy savings in buildings and houses. The principle object ive in this research is therefore to explore strategies of designing buildings with opt imal utilisation of natural light, efficient application of electrical energy for inter ior light ing and minimising energy usage of HVAC systems. A simulation modelling on daylight implementation was carried out under this research, with different kinds of light <b>ing</b> <b>arrangement</b> against a few different external characteristics within the control of the designer. The computer simulation software DIALUX 4. 11 version was used to analyse illuminat ion level inside the building and a n extensive literature survey on maximising ut ilisation of daylight and its effect on HVAC system was also carried out under this research project. As per the research energy savings from daylight design in buildings cannot be realized unless the electric lights are dimmed or switched in response to the amount of available daylight. The analysis results shows, that there is potential for saving 51 % of energy consumed for building light ing with daylight implementation for the building. But due to practical limitation, exist <b>ing</b> light <b>ing</b> <b>arrangement</b> is not suitable for daylight implementation and therefor e new light <b>ing</b> <b>arrangement</b> was considered under this research and new light <b>ing</b> <b>arrangement</b> shows that there is potent ial for 50 % of energy saving with daylight integration. The analysis was further carried out for new type of luminar ies to find out further energy saving potent ial with implementation of energy saving lights with integration of daylight. This analysis results shows, that there is potent ial for 52 % of energy saving with new type of luminaries and its arrangement. Effect on HVAC system due to daylight implementation was also analysed and it is shown that there is 10 % increase of building cooling load due to daylight implementation. Also this research presents guide lines for designing of daylight efficient buildings light ing systems to contribute towards energy conservation, environmental protect ion and establishment of sustainable economic system as well. This research can be further extended to analysis for different kind of building with different wall colouring and internal objects arrangement for opt imal energy saving with daylight implementation for commercial buildings...|$|R
