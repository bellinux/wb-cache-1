2500|$|One of the marvellous {{things about}} John Bonham which made things very easy [...] {{was the fact}} that he really knew how to tune his drums, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what, that was pretty rare in drummers in those days. He really knew how to make the {{instrument}} sing, and because of that, he could just get so much volume out of it by just playing with his wrists. It was just an astonishing technique that was sort of pretty holistic if you know what I mean.|$|E

2500|$|After filming Cobra, {{the cast}} of The Hooded Falcon sailed for France to be fitted for costumes. After three months, they {{returned}} to the United States, where Valentino's new beard, which he had grown for the film, caused a sensation. [...] "I opened once a paper <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what was in. It was Rudolph Valentino with a beard upon his chin. My heart stopped off from beating and I fainted dead away, and I never want to come to life until the judgement day," [...] was soon printed in Photoplay. The cast and crew left for Hollywood to begin preparations for the film, but much of the budget was taken up during preproduction. Due to the Valentinos' lavish spending on costumes and sets, Ritz-Carlton terminated the deal with the couple, effectively ending Valentino's contract with Ritz-Carlton.|$|E

2500|$|The {{cartoonist}} visited John Lennon and Yoko Ono {{at their}} 1969 Bed-In for Peace in Montreal, and their testy exchange later {{appeared in the}} documentary film [...] (1988). Introducing himself with the words [...] "I'm a dreadful Neanderthal fascist. How do you do?," [...] Capp sardonically congratulated Lennon and Ono on their [...] nude album cover: [...] "I think that everybody owes {{it to the world}} to prove they have pubic hair. You've done it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that I applaud you for it." [...] Following this exchange, Capp insulted Ono ("Good God, you've gotta live with that?"), and is asked to [...] "get out" [...] by Derek Taylor. Lennon allowed him to stay however, but the conversation had soured considerably. On Capp's exit, Lennon sang an impromptu version of his Ballad of John and Yoko song with a slightly revised, but nonetheless prophetic lyric: [...] "Christ, you know it ain't easy / You know how hard it can be / The way things are goin' / They're gonna crucify Capp!

2500|$|There are those, however, who {{deny that}} Jesus was a pacifist and state that Jesus never {{said not to}} fight, citing {{examples}} from the New Testament. One such instance portrays an angry Jesus driving dishonest market traders from the temple. [...] A frequently quoted passage is Luke 22:36: [...] "He said to them, 'But now, {{the one who has}} a purse must take it, and likewise a bag. And the one who has no sword must sell his cloak and buy one.'" [...] Pacifists have typically explained that verse as Jesus fulfilling prophecy, since in the next verse, Jesus continues to say: [...] "It is written: 'And he was numbered with the transgressors'; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that this must be fulfilled in me. Yes, what is written about me is reaching its fulfillment." [...] Others have interpreted the non-pacifist statements in the New Testament to be related to self-defense or to be metaphorical and state that on no occasion did Jesus shed blood or urge others to shed blood.|$|E
2500|$|In these {{difficult}} times {{the one person}} who continuously provided moral support to Pisemsky was Ivan Turgenev. In 1869 he informed Pisemsky that his One Thousand Souls had been translated into German and enjoyed [...] "great success in Berlin". [...] "So now {{the time has come for}} you to step outside the borders of your motherland and for Aleksey Pisemsky to become a European name," [...] Turgenev wrote on October 9, 1869. [...] "The best Berlin critic, Frenzel, in National Zeitung devoted a whole article to you where he calls your novel 'a rare phenomenon', <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> now you are well known in Germany," [...] wrote Turgenev in another letter, enclosing clips from other papers, too. [...] "The success of One Thousand Souls encourages [...] to start upon the novel Troubled Seas and I am so happy both for you and for Russian literature in general… Critical reviews of One Thousand Souls here in Germany are most favourable, your characters are being compared to those of Dickens, Thackeray, etc, etc", he continued. Julian Schmidt’s large article in Zeitgenossensche [...] Bilder, part of the series devoted to first class European authors, provided for Pisemsky another cause to celebrate, and following Turgenev's advice, in 1875 he visited Schmidt to thank him personally.|$|E

2500|$|On 7 June in {{a speech}} {{promoting}} the government's handling of the economy, Treasurer Peter Costello recalled the [...] of the 2004 election: [...] "This [...] is like a highly engineered racing car <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what, I wouldn't be putting an L-plate driver in the cockpit at the moment". August 2007 saw, {{for the first time}} during an election campaign, a 0.25-point interest-rate rise to 6.5 per cent by the Reserve Bank, the sixth rise since the last election in 2004. Labor used the news to argue that the Coalition could not be trusted to keep interest rates low, while Costello argued that interest rates would be higher under Labor. In November 2007 interest rates were raised for the sixth time since the 2004 election, to a 10-year high of 6.75 per cent. In response to Labor criticism of the government on the rate rises, Howard stated in August 2007 [...] " [...] can scour every transcript, and I will make them available, of every interview that I gave during that election campaign and he will find no such commitment. [...] During October 2007 Immigration Minister Kevin Andrews's decision to cut Australia's refugee intake and expressing public concern about Sudanese migrants was branded as racist.|$|E
