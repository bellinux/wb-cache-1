2500|$|His {{approach}} to modern knowledge is also seen in sectarian Orthodox Judaism, where {{the skills and}} technical knowledge of modernity are encouraged, but the values rejected. Bhaktivedanta Swami stated [...] "devotees should not be lazy, idle...we {{are not afraid to}} work. Whatever our engagement is, by offering the result to Krishna we become Krishna conscious". Some of his representations are believed to affect women adversely and are male-centred, others <b>are</b> <b>tender</b> and celebratory. Bhaktivedanta Swami himself taught a dualism of body and soul and that of the genders. Similar to many traditional religions he considered sexuality and spirituality as conflicting opposites. Among some liberal male followers there is a positive recognition of his example in applying the spirit of the law according to time, place, person and circumstance, rather than literal tracing of the tradition.|$|E

If our feelings (which <b>are</b> <b>tender)</b> happen to be hurt because his talent is not exercised for the praise and consolation of mankind, our intelligence (which is great) should let us see that he is a very splendid sinner, like all those who in this valley of compromises err by over-devotion to the truth that is in them. His determinism, barren of praise, blame and consolation, has all the merit of his conscientious art. The worth of every conviction consists precisely in the steadfastness with which it is held.|$|E
