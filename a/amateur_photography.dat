5|$|During {{the era of}} the {{collodion}} process, {{before the}} arrival of less demanding photographic technology (the gelatin silver process, photographic film, and smaller cameras) and the consequent rise of <b>amateur</b> <b>photography,</b> commercial photographers like Farsari had a particular importance for recording events and views. In Japan before 1899 such photographers were even more significant because the government required foreigners to obtain passes to journey to the interior, and commercial photographers based in Japan could more easily gain access and provide rare images of restricted areas. By 1889, however, Farsari estimated that about half of all visitors to Yokohama were amateur photographers; even if this was an exaggeration, the presence of increasing numbers of amateur photographers was obviously affecting the commercial photography business. To encourage amateur photographers to visit his studio and possibly buy his merchandise, Farsari provided free use of a darkroom.|$|E

25|$|An amateur {{photographer}} is one {{who practices}} photography as a hobby/passion and not necessarily for profit. The quality of some amateur work is {{comparable to that of}} many professionals and may be highly specialized or eclectic in choice of subjects. <b>Amateur</b> <b>photography</b> is often pre-eminent in photographic subjects which have little prospect of commercial use or reward. <b>Amateur</b> <b>photography</b> grew during the late 19th century due to the popularization of the hand-held camera. Nowadays it has spread widely through social media and is carried out throughout different platforms and equipment, switching to the use of cell phone as a key tool for making photography more accessible to everyone.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the club}} was founded before <b>amateur</b> <b>photography</b> was widespread, many early members were more {{advanced}} practitioners, a handful even making modest advances in photo technology. Even after more consumer-friendly processes came online in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, some club members continued to attract notice. Starting no later than the early 1890s, the Boston Camera Club has awarded honorary life membership on two classes of deserving individuals: its own members having given extraordinary service to the club, and outside personalities in the Boston area for signal photographic achievement.|$|E
25|$|Glass {{plates were}} the medium for most {{original}} camera photography {{from the late}} 1850s until the general introduction of flexible plastic films during the 1890s. Although the convenience of the film greatly popularized <b>amateur</b> <b>photography,</b> early films were somewhat more expensive and of markedly lower optical quality than their glass plate equivalents, and until the late 1910s they were not available in the large formats preferred by most professional photographers, so the new medium did not immediately or completely replace the old. Because of the superior dimensional stability of glass, the use of plates for some scientific applications, such as astrophotography, continued into the 1990s, and in the niche field of laser holography, it has persisted into the 2010s.|$|E

25|$|The {{invention}} of photography {{and more recently}} the video camera has opened the art of capturing images of people and scenes at a relatively low cost to the true amateur. A person can now capture images in {{both public and private}} situations. A feature of most private photographs and videos is that they are not intended for viewing outside of a very limited range of people, and seldom if ever by the general public. <b>Amateur</b> <b>photography,</b> which includes nude photography, which has previously been produced for personal enjoyment, is increasingly being more widely disseminated through the internet, at times without the knowledge and consent of the subject of the photograph, and to their subsequent embarrassment. Also, the use of secret photography to capture images of an unsuspecting person (undressed or not, and whether for personal use, or intended for posting on the Internet) creates additional personal privacy issues.|$|E

He spent his time on reading, meditating, attending church, gardening, hunting, <b>amateur</b> <b>photography.</b> Besides, Diệm also extensively conducted his nationalist activities during those 21 years, with meetings and correspondence with various leading Vietnamese revolutionaries, such as his friend, Phan Bội Châu, a Vietnamese anti-colonial activist, who Diệm respected for his knowledge of Confucianism and argued that Confucianism's teachings could be applied to a modern Vietnam. With the start of the Second World War in the Pacific, seeing an opportunity for Vietnam to challenge French colonization from the presence of Japan, he attempted to persuade the Japanese forces to declare independence for Vietnam in 1942 but was ignored. Diệm also tried to establish relationships with Japanese diplomats, army officers, and intelligence operatives who supported Vietnam's independence. In 1943, Diệm's Japanese friends helped him to contact Prince Cường Để, an anti-colonial activist, who was exiled in Japan. After contacting Cường Để, Diệm formed a secret political party, the Association for the Restoration of Great Vietnam (Việt Nam Đại Việt Phục Hưng Hội), which was dominated by his Catholic allies in Hue. When its existence was discovered in the summer of 1944, the French declared Diệm to be a subversive and ordered his arrest. He flew to Saigon under Japanese military protection, staying there until the end of WWII.|$|E

2500|$|Photography was {{introduced}} in 1839. [...] For some decades, practice was limited largely to professionals because it involved laborious wet-plate processes. [...] <b>Amateur</b> <b>photography</b> in the United States received major impetus in 1880, when the future Eastman KodakCo., and others, introduced dry platesglass plates with chemical emulsion already applied. [...] In 1888 Kodak introduced the first flexible roll photographic mediumfirst paper and soon filmand third-party processing. These innovations brought photography to the masses. Still, photography practiced in camera cubs (and among professionals as well) typically used glass plates until the early 20th century, when film was finally accepted. During the chemistry-based era, third-party processing and printing were typically prohibited in camera clubs, except later in the 20th century for color photographs.|$|E
2500|$|At {{least five}} persons named Boston Camera Club honorary {{members in the}} 1970s2000s had {{achievements}} of note. [...] H.

[...] Photojournalist Arthur Leo Griffin (19032001) was the best-known photographer of New England scenery in the mid-20th century. Aeronautical engineer HenryF. Weisenburger (b. 1924), who has practiced photography since the 1940s and who joined the club in 1954, is arguably the longest-active living exponent of <b>amateur</b> <b>photography</b> in New England, having instructed many in the field.

50|$|The {{popularity}} of <b>amateur</b> stereoscopic <b>photography</b> helped trigger a brief pop culture fad of 3D movies, 3D comic books, etc., {{which in turn}} helped to introduce new enthusiasts to the ranks of amateur stereo photographers. Unlike the pop culture 3D fad, which came and went quickly and was primarily a 1953 phenomenon, the {{popularity of}} <b>amateur</b> stereo <b>photography</b> started earlier, grew more slowly, peaked later, and declined more gradually. Eight new stereo cameras hit the market in 1954, including the Kodak Stereo Camera which may have driven several competitors out of the business. Kodak's stereo camera was not discontinued until 1959, Kodaslide stereo viewers were available until 1962, and the Realist continued in production, although ultimately in very small quantities, into 1971. Subsequent decades found new users replenishing the ranks of loyal devotees and supporting a solid market for second-hand equipment. Kodak's stereo mounting service was continued, through Qualex, into the early 1990s. Even today, despite the general transition from film to digital and from slide viewing and projection to slide scanning and video display, some of this sturdy equipment is still in use by a small core of enthusiasts of all ages.|$|R
