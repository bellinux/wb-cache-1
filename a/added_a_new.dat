5|$|In 1972, key {{elements}} of the park, including the Memorial to Heroic Self Sacrifice, were grade II listed to preserve their character.

In June 2009, a city worker, Jane Shaka (née Michele), via the Diocese of London <b>added</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> tablet to the Memorial, the first new addition for 78 years.

5|$|Until 1902 the Portland Public Library, {{which started}} as a reading room for sailors {{and then as a}} {{subscription}} library, was housed in the building. In 1928, the city began {{one of a series of}} renovations on the building to increase floor space.

5|$|Following {{the success}} of the GR1B/T2B upgrade, the RAF {{launched}} a plan to upgrade its Jaguar fleet to a common standard, incorporating improvements introduced to some aircraft during the Gulf War, together with adding the ability to use TIALD and new reconnaissance pods. The upgrade came in two parts; the interim GR3 (Jaguar 96) upgrade <b>added</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> HUD, a new hand controller and stick top, integrated GPS and TERPROM Terrain Referenced Navigation. It was delivered in two standards, for recce and TIALD. The further upgraded Jaguar GR3A (also known as Jaguar 97) introduced fleet-wide compatibility with TIALD and the new EO GP1 (JRP) digital reconnaissance pod, a helmet mounted sight, improved cockpit displays, a datalink, and improved Night vision goggles compatibility. All GR3As were subsequently re-engined with the new Adour 106 turbofan.|$|E
5|$|Following this, in 1972, the {{legislature}} <b>added</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> SR117, which extended {{this part of}} SR75 southwest to the Mexican border near Border Field State Park, to the state highway system, and a southerly extension of SR125 to the border at Otay Mesa to the state highway and Freeway and Expressway systems. Two years later, planning began {{for the construction of}} the Otay Mesa crossing and the construction of SR75 to connect it to I-5 and I-805. Later, the Comprehensive Planning Organization (CPO), the local association of municipal governments, recommended using $4million of federal funding for the construction of SR75. The CPO later endorsed expediting construction of the freeway before completion of the border crossing, so that the freeway would primarily serve border traffic, thus preventing land speculation in Otay Mesa. While Mexican authorities wanted the crossing constructed in 1975, the CPO indicated that the funding for SR75 would not be available until at least 1980, or even 1985. Following this, Representative Lionel Van Deerlin attempted to accelerate the construction of the crossing, even though there was no funding for the highway.|$|E

5|$|Significant {{changes were}} made both during and shortly after the war. Owing to {{obsolete}} navigational systems being unable to provide the accuracy required, both French and British Jaguars were quickly modified with Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers, a recent technology at the time. Prior to 1995 NATO bombing campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina known as Operation Deliberate Force, a dozen Jaguars were upgraded with the capability to carry the TIALD laser designator pod and redesignated Jaguar GR1B or T2B respectively. Shortly afterwards, the RAF upgraded its Jaguar fleet to a common standard, incorporating TIALD {{and the ability to}} use new reconnaissance pods. The interim GR3 (Jaguar 96) upgrade <b>added</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> HUD, a new hand controller and stick top, integrated GPS and TERPROM Terrain Referenced Navigation.
