5|$|For {{several decades}} after the uprising, Chiprovtsi <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> {{remained}} desolate. In 1699, the Ottomans attempted to settle 1,238 anti-Habsburg Hungarian rebels in those lands and provided them with 5-year tax exemptions, but this proved unsuccessful as in 1717 the same Hungarians were moved to the Rousse barracks and sent to fight at Niš.|$|E

5|$|Urban renewal {{projects}} and {{the transition to}} a service economy have resulted in strong economic growth in some parts of Northern England, but a definite North–South divide remains both in the economy and the culture of England.

50|$|The Department of <b>the</b> Environment, Transport <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Regions</b> {{was widely}} {{considered}} unwieldy {{and so was}} broken up, with the Transport functions now combined with Local Government <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Regions</b> in <b>the</b> DTLR (Department for Transport, Local Government <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Regions).</b> Critics argued from the outset {{that this was a}} mistake and that a post of Secretary of State for Transport was needed in its own right.|$|R

5|$|A {{significant}} {{influx of}} population and economic activity occurred around the 1850s goldrushes, particularly the Kiandra rush of 1859–60. The goldrushes prompted {{the establishment of}} communication between Sydney <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> {{by way of the}} Cobb & Co coaches, which transported mail and passengers. The first post offices opened in Ginninderra in 1859 and at Lanyon the following year. Bushranger activity continued with the goldrushes: Australian-born bandits Ben Hall and the Clarke brothers were active in the area, targeting mail coaches and gold transportation.|$|E
5|$|After Gia Long's death, Minh Mạng and Duyệt clashed frequently. As the {{southern}} governor, Duyet had significant autonomy, as only {{the centre of}} Vietnam was under direct royal rule. Duyet was a supporter of Catholic missionaries, while Minh Mạng was a staunch Confucianist. Duyet often disobeyed Minh Mạng's orders, and the emperor attempted to reduce the Duyet's autonomous power, which became easier with the general's death in 1831. The governor's post was abolished <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> was put under direct control.|$|E
5|$|Basin and Range-associated {{stretching}} {{of large}} parts of crust below southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico started around 16millionyears ago <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> is still spreading. This stretching began to affect the Death and Panamint valleys area by 3million years ago. Before this, rocks now in the Panamint Range were on top of rocks that would become the Black Mountains and the Cottonwood Mountains. Lateral and vertical transport of these blocks was accomplished by movement on normal faults. Right-lateral movement along strike-slip faults that run parallel to and {{at the base of}} the ranges also helped to develop the area. Torsional forces, probably associated with northwesterly movement of the Pacific Plate along the San Andreas Fault (west of the region), is responsible for the lateral movement.|$|E

5|$|Buses are an {{important}} part of the Northern transport mix, with bus ridership above the England and Wales average in all three Northern regions. Many of the municipal bus companies were located in Northern England, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> saw intense competition and bus wars following deregulation in the 1980s and 1990s. Increasing car ownership in the same era caused bus use to decline, although it remains higher than in most areas of the South.|$|E

There was further unrest in the early 15th century when the Welsh rebelled under Owain Glyndŵr, and more strife during the English Civil War in the 17th century.|$|E

5|$|In April 1941, Yugoslavia was {{occupied}} by Germany and Italy. Following the invasion the territory, parts of Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> of Syrmia were incorporated into the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), a Nazi-backed puppet state. Parts of Dalmatia were annexed by Italy and the northern Croatian regions of Baranja and Međimurje were annexed by Hungary. The NDH regime was led by Ante Pavelić and ultranationalist Ustaše. The regime introduced anti-semitic laws and conducted a campaign of ethnic cleansing and genocide against Serb and Roma inhabitants of the NDH, exemplified by the Jasenovac and Stara Gradiška concentration camps.|$|E

During <b>the</b> fourth state reform, the responsibilities of <b>the</b> Communities <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Regions</b> were expanded again, their resources were increased and they were given more fiscal responsibilities. Other major changes included the direct election of the parliaments of <b>the</b> Communities <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Regions,</b> <b>the</b> splitting up of the Province of Brabant into Flemish Brabant and Walloon Brabant, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> reformation of the Federal Parliament's bicameral system <b>and</b> <b>the</b> relations between <b>the</b> Federal Parliament <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Federal Government.

5|$|In {{the early}} years of Basil I's reign, Arab raids on the coasts of Dalmatia were {{successfully}} repelled, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> once again came under secure Byzantine control.

5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1271–1272 {{reinforcements}} arrived from Meissen, led by Count Dietrich II. The army invaded Natangia and besieged an unnamed Natangian castle. While the assault claimed 150 lives of the crusaders, most of Natangian resistance was broken <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> was decimated. Herkus Monte, {{with a small group}} of his followers, was forced to withdraw to the forests of southern Prussia. Within a year he was finally captured and hanged. The last Prussian leader, Glappe of Warmians, was also hanged when his siege campaign on Brandenburg (now Ushakovo) was attacked from the rear. The last tribe standing were the Pogesanians, who made a surprise raid into Elbing and ambushed its garrison. In 1274 the Knights made a great expedition to avenge this raid, capturing the rebel headquarters at Heilsberg (Lidzbark Warmiński) and ending the uprising.|$|E
