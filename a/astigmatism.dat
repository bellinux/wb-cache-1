5|$|By {{combining}} the wide angle focal lengths with narrow apertures, the lens provides strong {{depth of field}} rather than making blurred backgrounds. The lens is constructed with a hybrid aspherical lens that when combined with two glass mold elements provides excellent correction for distortion as well as <b>astigmatism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous proponent of the Bates method was the British writer Aldous Huxley. At the age of sixteen Huxley had an attack of keratitis, which, after an 18-month period of near-blindness, left him with one eye just capable of light {{perception}} {{and the other with}} an unaided Snellen fraction of 10/200. This was mainly due to opacities in both corneas, complicated by hyperopia and <b>astigmatism.</b> He was able to read only if he wore thick glasses and dilated his better pupil with atropine, to allow that eye to see around an opacity {{in the center of the}} cornea.|$|E
25|$|When {{treating}} {{a patient with}} preexisting <b>astigmatism,</b> most wavefront-guided LASIK lasers are designed to treat regular <b>astigmatism</b> as determined externally by corneal topography. In patients who have an element of internally induced <b>astigmatism,</b> therefore, the wavefront-guided <b>astigmatism</b> correction may leave regular <b>astigmatism</b> behind (a cross-cylinder effect). If the patient has preexisting irregular <b>astigmatism,</b> wavefront-guided approaches may leave both regular and irregular <b>astigmatism</b> behind. This can result in less-than-optimal visual acuity compared with a wavefront-guided approach combined with vector planning, as shown in a 2008 study. Thus, vector planning offers a better alignment between corneal <b>astigmatism</b> and laser treatment, and leaves less regular <b>astigmatism</b> behind on the cornea, which is advantageous whether irregular <b>astigmatism</b> coexists or not.|$|E
25|$|The optical {{power of}} {{corrective}} lenses {{is measured in}} diopters, a value equal to the reciprocal of the focal length measured in metres; with a positive focal length corresponding to a converging lens and a negative focal length corresponding to a diverging lens. For lenses that correct for <b>astigmatism</b> as well, three numbers are given: one for the spherical power, one for the cylindrical power, {{and one for the}} angle of orientation of the <b>astigmatism.</b>|$|E
25|$|A spherical contact lens bends light evenly {{in every}} {{direction}} (horizontally, vertically, etc.). They are typically used to correct myopia and hypermetropia. A toric contact lens has a different focusing power horizontally than vertically, {{and as a result}} can correct for <b>astigmatism.</b> Some spherical rigid lenses can also correct for <b>astigmatism.</b> Because a toric lens must have the proper orientation to correct for a person's <b>astigmatism,</b> such a lens must have additional design characteristics to prevent it from rotating away from the ideal alignment. This can be done by weighting the bottom of the lens or by using other physical characteristics to rotate the lens back into position. Some toric contact lenses have marks or etchings that can assist the eye doctor or the user in fitting the lens. The first disposable toric contact lenses were introduced in 2000 by Vistakon.|$|E
25|$|Visual {{function}} declines as {{a result}} of the irregular corneal shape, resulting in <b>astigmatism,</b> and causing a distortion in vision. Deterioration can become severe over time.|$|E
25|$|The {{abbreviation}} PH {{is followed}} by the visual acuity as measured with a pinhole occluder, which temporarily corrects for refractive errors such as myopia or <b>astigmatism.</b>|$|E
25|$|Carl Fisher {{was born}} in Greensburg, Indiana, nine {{years after the end}} of the American Civil War, the son of Albert H. and Ida Graham Fisher. Apparently {{suffering}} from alcoholism, a problem which would also plague Carl later in life, his father left the family when Fisher was a child. Suffering from severe <b>astigmatism,</b> it was difficult for Carl to pay attention in school, as uncorrected <b>astigmatism</b> can cause headaches or eyestrain, and blur vision at all distances. He quit school when he was twelve years old to help support his family.|$|E
25|$|Lenses {{are used}} as {{prosthetics}} for the correction of visual impairments such as myopia, hyperopia, presbyopia, and <b>astigmatism.</b> (See corrective lens, contact lens, eyeglasses.) Most lenses used for other purposes have strict axial symmetry; eyeglass lenses are only approximately symmetric. They are usually shaped to fit in a roughly oval, not circular, frame; the optical centres are placed over the eyeballs; their curvature may not be axially symmetric to correct for <b>astigmatism.</b> Sunglasses' lenses are designed to attenuate light; sunglass lenses that also correct visual impairments can be custom made.|$|E
25|$|These designs allow {{compensation}} of the cavity beam's <b>astigmatism,</b> which {{is produced by}} Brewster-cut elements in the cavity. A 'Z'-shaped arrangement of the cavity also compensates for coma while the 'delta' or 'X'-shaped cavity does not.|$|E
25|$|Toric or sphero-cylindrical lenses have {{surfaces}} {{with two}} different radii of curvature in two orthogonal planes. They {{have a different}} focal power in different meridians. This forms an astigmatic lens. An example is eyeglass lenses {{that are used to}} correct <b>astigmatism</b> in someone's eye.|$|E
25|$|Pellucid {{marginal}} degeneration causes thinning of {{a narrow}} (1–2mm) band of the cornea, usually along the inferior corneal margin. It causes irregular <b>astigmatism</b> that, {{in the early stages}} of the disease can be corrected by spectacles. Differential diagnosis may be made by slit-lamp examination.|$|E
25|$|Keratoconus (KC) is a {{disorder}} {{of the eye}} which results in progressive thinning of the cornea. This may result in blurry vision, double vision, nearsightedness, <b>astigmatism,</b> and light sensitivity. Usually both eyes are affected. In more severe cases a scarring or a circle may be seen within the cornea.|$|E
25|$|Carl Graham Fisher (January 12, 1874– July 15, 1939) was an American entrepreneur. Despite severe <b>astigmatism,</b> {{he became}} {{actively}} involved in auto racing. He was a seemingly tireless pioneer and promoter of the automotive industry and highway construction, and of real estate development in Florida. He {{is widely regarded as}} a promotional genius.|$|E
25|$|The size of {{the contact}} lens market is likely to grow due to the {{increasing}} occurrence of eye-related conditions such as <b>astigmatism,</b> hypermetropia and myopia. The other drivers are increasing population, the desire to make fashion statements, and technological advancement. By the end of 2020, {{the value of the}} contact lens market is predicted to reach $13.5 billion.|$|E
25|$|However in Essex's next match, {{a county}} {{championship}} match against Derbyshire at Derby, Pettini {{was forced to}} miss {{the second and third}} days' play after suffering an <b>astigmatism</b> in his eye. He travelled to Cambridge to see a specialist for treatment. The eye problem would flare up again just a day before the county's Friends Provident Trophy final against Kent at Lord's.|$|E
25|$|In {{early stages}} of keratoconus, glasses or soft contact lenses can suffice to correct for the mild <b>astigmatism.</b> As the {{condition}} progresses, these may no longer provide the person with a satisfactory degree of visual acuity, and most practitioners will move to manage the condition with rigid contact lenses, known as rigid, gas-permeable, (RGP) lenses. RGP lenses provide a good level of visual correction, but do not arrest progression of the condition.|$|E
25|$|All {{of these}} {{conditions}} can be corrected using corrective lenses. For presbyopia and hyperopia, a converging lens provides the extra curvature necessary to bring the near point closer to the eye while for myopia a diverging lens provides the curvature necessary to send the far point to infinity. <b>Astigmatism</b> is corrected with a cylindrical surface lens that curves more strongly in one direction than in another, compensating for the non-uniformity of the cornea.|$|E
25|$|The American {{scientist}} Benjamin Franklin, {{who suffered}} from both myopia and presbyopia, invented bifocals. Serious historians have {{from time to time}} produced evidence to suggest that others may have preceded him in the invention; however, a correspondence between George Whatley and John Fenno, editor of The Gazette of the United States, suggested that Franklin had indeed invented bifocals, and perhaps 50 years earlier than had been originally thought. The first lenses for correcting <b>astigmatism</b> were designed by the British astronomer George Airy in 1825.|$|E
25|$|A rigid lens is able {{to replace}} the natural shape of the contact (cornea) with a new refracting surface. This means that a spherical rigid contact lens can correct <b>astigmatism.</b> Rigids can also be made as a front-toric, back-toric, or bitoric. This is {{different}} from a spherical contact lens in that one or both surfaces of the lens deliver a toric correction. Rigids can also correct for corneal irregularities, such as keratoconus. In most cases, patients with keratoconus see better through rigids than through glasses. Rigids are more chemically inert, allowing them to be worn in more challenging environments than soft lenses.|$|E
25|$|As a child, Knight {{was deeply}} {{interested}} {{in nature and}} animals, and spent many hours copying the illustrations from his father’s natural history books. Though legally blind because of <b>astigmatism</b> and a subsequent injury to his right eye, Knight pursued his artistic talents {{with the help of}} specially designed glasses, and at the age of twelve, he enrolled at the Metropolitan Art School to become a commercial artist. In 1890, he was hired by a church-decorating firm to design stained-glass windows, and after two years with them, became a freelance illustrator for books and magazines, specializing in nature scenes.|$|E
25|$|A {{common cause}} of low visual acuity is {{refractive}} error (ametropia), or errors in how the light is refracted in the eyeball. Causes of refractive errors include aberrations {{in the shape of}} the eyeball, the shape of the cornea, and reduced flexibility of the lens. Too high or too low refractive error (in relation to the length of the eyeball) is the cause of nearsightedness (myopia) or farsightedness (hyperopia) (normal refractive status is referred to as emmetropia). Other optical causes are <b>astigmatism</b> or more complex corneal irregularities. These anomalies can mostly be corrected by optical means (such as eyeglasses, contact lenses, laser surgery, etc.).|$|E
25|$|Electron lenses are {{designed}} {{to act in a}} manner emulating that of an optical lens, by focusing parallel electrons at some constant focal distance. Electron lenses may operate electrostatically or magnetically. The majority of electron lenses for TEM use electromagnetic coils to generate a convex lens. The field produced for the lens must be radially symmetrical, as deviation from the radial symmetry of the magnetic lens causes aberrations such as <b>astigmatism,</b> and worsens spherical and chromatic aberration. Electron lenses are manufactured from iron, iron-cobalt or nickel cobalt alloys, such as permalloy. These are selected for their magnetic properties, such as magnetic saturation, hysteresis and permeability.|$|E
25|$|The National Eye Institute reports {{keratoconus}} is {{the most}} common corneal dystrophy in the United States, affecting about one in 2,000 Americans, but some reports place the figure as high as one in 500. The inconsistency may be due to variations in diagnostic criteria, with some cases of severe <b>astigmatism</b> interpreted as those of keratoconus, and vice versa. A long-term study found a mean incidence rate of 2.0 new cases per 100,000 population per year. Some studies have suggested a higher prevalence amongst females, or that people of South Asian ethnicity are 4.4 times as likely to suffer from keratoconus as Caucasians, and {{are also more likely to}} be affected with the condition earlier.|$|E
25|$|Defects in vision can be {{explained}} using optical principles. As people age, the lens becomes less flexible and the near point recedes from the eye, a condition known as presbyopia. Similarly, people suffering from hyperopia cannot decrease the focal length of their lens enough to allow for nearby objects to be imaged on their retina. Conversely, people who cannot increase the focal length of their lens enough to allow for distant objects to be imaged on the retina suffer from myopia and have a far point that is considerably closer than infinity. A condition known as <b>astigmatism</b> results when the cornea is not spherical but instead is more curved in one direction. This causes horizontally extended objects {{to be focused on}} different parts of the retina than vertically extended objects, and results in distorted images.|$|E
25|$|Leonard's primary health {{concern is}} his lactose intolerance: his {{consuming}} melon or any dairy products (and {{according to the}} pilot episode, even corn) results in flatulence. Leonard wears eyeglasses because of <b>astigmatism,</b> and cannot see without them. On one occasion, when his glasses were broken at the movie theater, he had to surreptitiously return to his apartment and retrieve his backup glasses. In order to avoid detection by a sick Sheldon and Penny, who was nursing him, Howard and Raj helped him to navigate {{through the living room}} by using a helmet camera. Leonard states in one episode that he suffers from sleep apnea. During his relationship with Leslie Winkle, he tells her that many members of his family have died from heart disease and thus he has a genetic disposition to the condition.|$|E
25|$|As a cricketer, domesticity {{was just}} not in his line. He began his innings usually as one who, {{suffering}} from violent <b>astigmatism,</b> has not only mislaid his glasses, but had in addition a fearful headache. He made a pass or two after the ball had gone past him: he lunged fitfully and missed: he stabbed down just in time at the straight ones: he sliced the rising offside ball over the second slip: he snicked hazily past his leg stump. So, for {{about a quarter of}} an hour, it went on: or, to such an agonized onlooker as I, it seemed to go on. Then suddenly, he would catch a half volley or a long hop such a crack that the bowler, fearful of his own safety, lost all his aggressive intention, and, with it, any idea of length.|$|E
25|$|Typically a TEM {{consists}} of three stages of lensing. The stages are the condenser lenses, the objective lenses, and the projector lenses. The condenser lenses are responsible for primary beam formation, while the objective lenses focus the beam that comes through the sample itself (in STEM scanning mode, there are also objective lenses above the sample to make the incident electron beam convergent). The projector lenses are used to expand the beam onto the phosphor screen or other imaging device, such as film. The magnification of the TEM {{is due to the}} ratio of the distances between the specimen and the objective lens' image plane. Additional stigmators allow for the correction of asymmetrical beam distortions, known as <b>astigmatism.</b> It is noted that TEM optical configurations differ significantly with implementation, with manufacturers using custom lens configurations, such as in spherical aberration corrected instruments, or TEMs using energy filtering to correct electron chromatic aberration.|$|E
25|$|The {{patient may}} be {{examined}} with pupillary dilation and education given {{prior to the}} procedure. Before the surgery, the patient's corneas are examined with a pachymeter to determine their thickness, and with a topographer, or corneal topography machine, to measure their surface contour. Using low-power lasers, a topographer creates a topographic map of the cornea. The procedure is contraindicated if the topographer finds difficulties such as keratoconus The preparatory process also detects <b>astigmatism</b> and other irregularities {{in the shape of}} the cornea. Using this information, the surgeon calculates the amount and the location of corneal tissue to be removed. The patient is prescribed and self-administers an antibiotic beforehand to minimize the risk of infection after the procedure and is sometimes offered a short acting oral sedative medication as a pre-medication. Prior to the procedure, anaesthetic eye drops are instilled. Factors that may rule out LASIK for some patients include large pupils, thin corneas and extremely dry eyes.|$|E
25|$|Patients with {{keratoconus}} typically present initially {{with mild}} <b>astigmatism</b> and myopia, commonly {{at the onset}} of puberty, and are diagnosed by the late teenage years or early 20s. The disease can, however, present or progress at any age; in rare cases, keratoconus can present in children or not until later adulthood. A diagnosis of the disease at an early age may indicate a greater risk of severity in later life. Patients' vision will seem to fluctuate over a period of months, driving them to change lens prescriptions frequently, but as the condition worsens, contact lenses are required in the majority of cases. The course of the disorder can be quite variable, with some patients remaining stable for years or indefinitely, while others progress rapidly or experience occasional exacerbations over a long and otherwise steady course. Most commonly, keratoconus progresses for a period of 10 to 20 years before the course of the disease generally ceases in the third and fourth decades of life.|$|E
25|$|Prior to any {{physical}} examination, {{the diagnosis of}} keratoconus frequently begins with an ophthalmologist's or optometrist's assessment of the person's medical history, particularly the chief complaint and other visual symptoms, the presence of any history of ocular disease or injury which might affect vision, {{and the presence of}} any family history of ocular disease. An eye chart, such as a standard Snellen chart of progressively smaller letters, is then used to determine the person's visual acuity. The eye examination may proceed to measurement of the localized curvature of the cornea with a manual keratometer, with detection of irregular <b>astigmatism</b> suggesting a possibility of keratoconus. Severe cases can exceed the instrument's measuring ability. A further indication can be provided by retinoscopy, in which a light beam is focused on the person's retina and the reflection, or reflex, observed as the examiner tilts the light source back and forth. Keratoconus is amongst the ophthalmic conditions that exhibit a scissor reflex action of two bands moving toward and away from each other like the blades of a pair of scissors.|$|E
25|$|OA1 is {{recognized}} by many different symptoms. Reduced visual acuity {{is accompanied by}} involuntary movements of the eye termed as nystagmus. <b>Astigmatism</b> is a condition wherein there occurs significant refractive error. Moreover, ocular albino eyes become crossed, a condition called as ‘lazy eyes’ or strabismus. Since very little pigment is present the iris becomes translucent and reflects light back. It appears green to blueish red. However, {{the most important part}} of the eye, the fovea which is responsible for acute vision, does not develop properly, probably indicating the role of melanin in the development stages of the eye. Some affected individuals may also develop photophobia/photodysphoria. All these symptoms are due to lack of pigmentation of the retina. Moreover, in an ocular albino eye, nerves from back of the eye to the brain may not follow the usual pattern of routing. In an ocular albino eye, more nerves cross from back of the eye to the opposite side of the brain instead of going to the both sides of the brain as in a normal eye. An ocular albino eye appears blueish pink in color with no pigmentation at all unlike a normal eye. Carrier women have regions of hypo- and hyper-pigmentation due to X-inactivation and partial iris transillumination and do not show any other symptoms exhibited by those affected by OA1.|$|E
500|$|During {{the same}} period, other {{researchers}} developed alternative, more radical theories. The ophthalmologists August Goldschmidt and Germán Beritens argued that El Greco painted such elongated human figures {{because he had}} vision problems (possibly progressive <b>astigmatism</b> or strabismus) that made him see bodies longer than they were, and {{at an angle to}} the perpendicular; the physician Arturo Perera, however, attributed this style to the use of marijuana. Michael Kimmelman, a reviewer for The New York Times, stated that [...] "to Greeks [...] became the quintessential Greek painter; to the Spanish, the quintessential Spaniard".|$|E
500|$|Recurrent {{pulmonary}} trouble ailed {{the young}} Gibbs and his physicians {{were concerned that}} he might be susceptible to tuberculosis, which had killed his mother. [...] He also suffered from <b>astigmatism,</b> whose treatment was then still largely unfamiliar to oculists, so that Gibbs had to diagnose himself and grind his own lenses. [...] Though in later years he used glasses only for reading or other close work, Gibbs's delicate health and imperfect eyesight probably explain why he did not volunteer to fight in the Civil War of 1861–65. [...] He was not conscripted and he remained at Yale {{for the duration of the}} war.|$|E
500|$|... l. [...] This theory enjoyed {{surprising}} popularity {{during the}} early years of the twentieth century and was opposed by the German psychologist David Kuntz. Whether or not El Greco had progressive <b>astigmatism</b> is still open to debate. Stuart Anstis, Professor at the University of California (Department of Psychology), concludes that [...] "even if El Greco were astigmatic, he would have adapted to it, and his figures, whether drawn from memory or life, would have had normal proportions. His elongations were an artistic expression, not a visual symptom." [...] According to Professor of Spanish John Armstrong Crow, [...] "astigmatism could never give quality to a canvas, nor talent to a dunce".|$|E
500|$|Marcus [...] "Mark" [...] Laurence Elwin Oliphant {{was born}} on 8 October 1901 in Kent Town, a suburb of Adelaide. His father was Harold George [...] "Baron" [...] Oliphant, a civil servant with the South Australian Engineering and Water Supply Department and {{part-time}} lecturer in Economics with the Workers' Educational Association. His mother was Beatrice Edith Fanny Oliphant, née Tucker, an artist. He was named after Marcus Clarke, the Australian author, and Laurence Oliphant, the British traveller and mystic. Most people called him Mark; this became official when he was knighted in 1959. He had four younger brothers, Roland, Keith, Nigel and Donald. His parents were theosophists, and as such were opposed to eating meat. Marcus became a lifelong vegetarian while a boy, after witnessing the slaughter of pigs on a farm. He {{was found to be}} completely deaf in one ear and he needed glasses for severe <b>astigmatism</b> and short-sightedness.|$|E
