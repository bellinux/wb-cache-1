5|$|Aside from {{professional}} wrestling performances, celebrity involvement {{has been a}} major key in the production of WrestleMania events. WWE involves celebrities in the WrestleMania events to gain more hype and media attention for the event, in this way receiving more attraction to the event, pay-per-view buys, and ticket sales. The celebrities involved with WrestleMania events have come from a range of occupations, including singing, acting, professional boxing, <b>and</b> <b>modeling,</b> and usually appear in non-wrestling roles, such as singing, promoting a subject, or managing wrestlers at ringside. There have been exceptions, however, in which celebrities have had a professional wrestling role.|$|E

40|$|A {{conceptual}} {{analysis of}} controls <b>and</b> <b>models</b> from a semiotic perspective {{is provided with}} the goal of elucidating their nature in complex systems. Atomic control systems <b>and</b> <b>models</b> are described as the paradigmatic forms of systems in relation to their environments. While they share measurement relations, they differ topologically in that control systems are circularly <b>and</b> <b>models</b> linearly related related to their environments. Computation is then introduced in control systems, which motivates hierarchical decompositions <b>and</b> hybrid <b>modeling</b> <b>and</b> control systems. The various relations in complex control systems <b>and</b> <b>models</b> are placed in a semiotic context in terms of constraint relations among various entities, where rules and laws are distinguished as contingent and necessary entailments respectively.

40|$|Background: The family, {{and parents}} in particular, are {{considered}} the most important influencers regarding children’s energy-balance related behaviours (EBRBs). When children become older and gain more behavioural autonomy regarding different behaviours, the parental influences may become less important and peer influences may gain importance. Therefore the current study aims to investigate simultaneous and interactive associations of family rules, parent and friend norms <b>and</b> <b>modelling</b> with soft drink intake, TV viewing, daily breakfast consumption and sport participation among schoolchildren across Europe. Methods: A school-based cross-sectional survey in eight countries across Europe among 10 – 12 year old schoolchildren. Child questionnaires {{were used to assess}} EBRBs (soft drink intake, TV viewing, breakfast consumption, sport participation), and potential determinants of these behaviours as perceived by the child, including family rules, parental and friend norms <b>and</b> <b>modelling.</b> Linear <b>and</b> logistic regression analyses (n = 7811) were applied to study the association of parental (norms, <b>modelling</b> <b>and</b> rules) and friend influences (norm <b>and</b> <b>modelling)</b> with the EBRBs. In addition, potential moderating effects of parental influences on the associations of friend influences with the EBRBs were studied by including interaction terms. Results: Children reported more unfavourable friend norms <b>and</b> <b>modelling</b> regarding soft drink intake and TV viewing, while they reported more favourable friend and parental norms <b>and</b> <b>modelling</b> for breakfast consumption and physical activity. Perceived friend and parental norms <b>and</b> <b>modelling</b> were significantly positively associated with soft drink intake, breakfast consumption, physical activity (only <b>modelling)</b> <b>and</b> TV time. Across the different behaviours, ten significant interactions between parental and friend influencing variables were found and suggested a weaker association of friend norms <b>and</b> <b>modelling</b> when rules were in place. Conclusion: Parental and friends norm <b>and</b> <b>modelling</b> are associated with schoolchildren’s energy balance-related behaviours. Having family rules or showing favourable parental <b>modelling</b> <b>and</b> norms seems to reduce the potential unfavourable associations of friends’ norms <b>and</b> <b>modelling</b> with the EBRBs...|$|R
