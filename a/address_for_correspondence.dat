25|$|Muravyov was {{a liberal}} and Bakunin, as his relative, became a {{particular}} favourite. In {{the spring of}} 1859 Muravyov helped Bakunin with a job for Amur Development Agency which enabled him to move with his wife to Irkutsk, the capital of Eastern Siberia. This enabled Bakunin {{to be part of}} the circle involved in political discussions centred on Muravyov's colonial headquarters. Resenting the treatment of the colony by the Saint Petersburg bureaucracy, including its use as a dumping ground for malcontents, a proposal for a United States of Siberia emerged, independent of Russia and federated into a new United States of Siberia and America, following the example of the United States of America. The circle included Muravyov's young Chief of Staff, Kukel– who Kropotkin related had the complete works of Alexander Herzen– the civil governor Izvolsky, who allowed Bakunin to use his <b>address</b> <b>for</b> <b>correspondence,</b> and Muravyov's deputy and eventual successor, General Alexander Dondukov-Korsakov.|$|E

"The teachet of Russian language" [...] and the Japanese {{connoisseur}} of the Russian language.During {{the cargo}} operations in Japan, some crew {{members of the}} ship Matallurg Anosov were taken for tour in Kyoto, old capital of Japan. The tour guide was Mr. M. Hamano, a Japanese. Mr. Hamano had very good knowledges in Russian language and wished to improve it. It is why he often asked a seaman of the ship about correct and proper pronunciation and understanding some of the words. Soon he stopped to ask questions to the seaman and commenced to ask to Nikolay. When the ship back in Odessa, Nicholas {{received a letter from}} Mr. Hamano and told his son: [...] "The Janapese had very good knowladges in Russian language and he was a professor of Russian language in a University. He ask me a question about the correct pronunciation and the use of Russian words. I was puzzled often due to his knowledges in Russian had sometimes better then my knowledges in Russian language includes Ukrainian words and Ukrainian pronunciation. I am Ukranian. I understood that another seaman redirected Mr. Hamano to me and asked that seaman after the tour. he is tired of questions from the Japanese and said to Mr. Hamano that Nikolay is a teacher of Russian language. It is why Nikolay was interviewed with the addiction regarding Russian language and was forced to give his <b>address</b> <b>for</b> <b>correspondence</b> letters." ...|$|E

40|$|Owing to {{increased}} technological relatedness, managers {{are believed to}} be under increased pressure to develop competencies around a growing number of technologies. In this paper, by measuring the co-patenting activities of large firms between 1890 - 1932; 1940 - 1968 and 1969 - 1995 we present evidence of this phenomenon. Our results show that formerly unrelated technologies have indeed become related; that different groups of technologies drive the phenomenon in different periods and that the role of associated versus non-associated firms in forging these relationships changes through time. <b>Addresses</b> <b>for</b> <b>correspondence...</b>|$|R
40|$|Recent {{controversy}} has surrounded the relative value {{of public and}} private sector remuneration. We define a comprehensive measure of Total Reward (TR) which includes not just pay, but pensions and other ‘benefits in kind’, evaluate it as the present value of the sum of all these payments over the lifetime and compare it in the UK public and private sectors. Our results suggest that TR is equalized over the lifecycle for men while women have a clear TR advantage in the public sector by the end of their career. We suggest that the current controversy over public-private sector pension differentials and the perennial issues of public/private sector pay gaps requires a life time perspective and that the concept of TR is appropriate. <b>Addresses</b> <b>for</b> <b>correspondence...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: International {{organizations}} pursue multiple {{objectives in}} hiring policies ⎯ including cultural diversity, reducing costs and avoiding discrimination ⎯ among which {{there can be}} sharp trade-offs. The paper studies how these trade-offs are resolved in the World Bank’s hiring processes. It estimates that half of salary and grade differentials {{between men and women}} and staff from high- and low-income countries are attributable to differences in productive characteristics. Alternative explanations for the remainder are explored, including omitted variable bias, quotas and discrimination. It is argued that the first two are not compelling explanations. Discrimination probably exists, though less than would be implied by a cost minimizing hiring policy.

The DNA density is supposed nonuniform {{and as a}} result the Donnan effect is also inhomogeneous. The coarse-grained DNA density is a nonlinear function of the DNA radius of curvature at a given position inside the bacteriophage. It turns out that a region (or regions) exists totally free from DNA. The size of such holes is computed. <b>Address</b> <b>for</b> <b>correspondence...</b>|$|E

Most other service chaining approaches confine themselves to handling either syntactic or semantic service descriptions.
