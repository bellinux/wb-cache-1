5|$|As Rosenbaum {{describes}} it, Lex views Lana as this beautiful, charming {{girl with}} a little naïveté. It is this naïveté that allows Lex {{to believe that he}} can trust and confide in Lana, and that she is his one true love. Lex <b>also</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> Lana will always love Clark, but he expects her to love him for who he is just the same. Rosenbaum does not believe that Lana gives that to Lex. Writer Holly Harold finds parallels between Lex's relationship with Lana, and that of Lionel's relationship with Martha. Both men believe that these two women will be their saving grace, and pull them back from the dark side. In Lex's defense, Rosenbaum contends that Lex is not using Lana in an effort to hurt Clark, but that he really does love her. The actor believes that Lex's problem {{lies in the fact that}} every time he has loved someone and opened up to them he has been hurt, or betrayed. Even though Lex loves Lana more than anyone else before her, he just cannot bring himself to open up completely for fear of repeating the past. Rosenbaum believes that the eventual dissolution of the marriage between Lex and Lana was a tragic moment in both characters' lives. It is a moment that solidifies Lex's history of opening up to women and having them hurt him.|$|E
25|$|Lizzie Hexam also {{objects to}} her {{marriage}} to Eugene Wrayburn. She does not aspire to marrying Wrayburn even though she loves him and would be elevated in society simply by marrying him, which almost any woman would have done at the time. Lizzie feels that she is unworthy of him. Wrayburn, however, feels that he is unworthy of such a good woman. He <b>also</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> his father would disapprove of her low social status. Therefore, both of them end up going against expectations by marrying each other.|$|E
500|$|West Ham's {{final game}} {{before the final}} was against Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League, and a 2–1 win meant they {{finished}} the season in ninth place. West Ham also had injury concerns ahead of the final, with midfielder Matthew Etherington and striker Dean Ashton both doubts to be fit for the match. However, manager Alan Pardew was optimistic they would be available for selection stating: [...] "You expect everyone to put their {{life on the line}} for the final." [...] Pardew was also optimistic about his teams chances in the final, despite them being considered as the underdogs: We're up against a technical team who are better than us, Liverpool have got more experience and more international players, too. But everyone <b>also</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> we attack teams and that we've got a big punch." ...|$|E

500|$|Santer, {{who stood}} down as {{executive}} producer after the episode's transmission, succeeded by Bryan Kirkwood, commented {{that he was}} happy, relieved and proud with the broadcast. Santer stated: [...] "I just think everyone did brilliantly tonight—the cast, the crew, everyone. It's everything I wished for and more. I'm thrilled with how it went. It was quite remarkable. Everything went to plan. I spotted a couple of little wobbles but what I was proudest of was the recovery. The technical crew, the cast—every time we maybe veered slightly off course, they pulled it back round." [...] Santer explained that he had always intended for Stacey to be revealed as Archie's killer, and was never tempted to air a different conclusion, despite at least ten characters having strong motives. Turner {{was surprised to learn}} that Stacey was the killer, and hoped that viewers would sympathise with her character, observing: [...] "She not only has to deal with the guilt of what she did but she <b>also</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> she's inadvertently responsible for Bradley's death. I think that's going to hurt her more than anything." ...|$|E

[...] This increase in fitness is achieved by reducing the time, energy or risk of injury unnecessarily incurred by defending a territory or its resources (e.g. mate, food, space) against a familiar animal with its own territory; the territory-holder already knows about the abilities of the neighbour, and <b>also</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> the neighbour is unlikely to try to take over the territory because it already has one.|$|E

60|$|The reader {{knows that}} we are now writing of Suffolk County, Long Island, New York. He <b>also</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> our opening scene is to be on the shorter, or most {{northern}} of the two prongs of that fork, which divides the eastern end of this island, giving it what are properly two capes. The smallest territorial division that is known to the laws of New York, in rural districts, is the 'township,' as it is called. These townships are usually larger than the English parish, corresponding more properly with the French canton. They vary, however, greatly in size, some containing as much as a hundred square miles, which is the largest size, while others do not contain more than a tenth of that surface.|$|E

She had begun to doubt--to doubt whether her first judgment as to Mr. Saul's character had not been unjust--to doubt whether, in addressing her, he was not right, seeing that his love for her was so strong--to doubt whether she did not like him better than she had thought she did--to doubt whether an engagement with a penniless curate was in truth a position utterly to be reprehended and avoided. Young penniless curates must love somebody as well as young beneficed vicars and rectors. And then Mr. Saul pleaded his cause so well! ...|$|E

6000|$|... 2d, Reason. It is {{urged that}} man knows that {{whatever}} is must either {{have had a}} beginning, or have existed from all eternity: he <b>also</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> whatever is not eternal {{must have had a}} cause. When this reasoning is applied to the universe, it is necessary to prove that it was created: until that is clearly demonstrated we may reasonably suppose that it has endured from all eternity. We must prove design before we can infer a designer. The only idea which we can form of causation is derivable from the constant conjunction of objects, and the consequent inference of one from the other. In a case where two propositions are diametrically opposite, the mind believes that which is least incomprehensible;--it is easier to suppose that the universe has existed from all eternity than to conceive a being beyond its limits capable of creating it: if the mind sinks beneath the weight of one, is it an alleviation to increase the intolerability of the burthen? ...|$|E

60|$|Everybody knows, of course, that up {{and down}} over the face of England a whole crop of places may be found with such {{terminations}} as Lancaster, Doncaster, Manchester, Leicester, Gloucester, or Exeter; and everybody <b>also</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> these words are various corruptions or alterations of the Latin castra, or perhaps we ought rather to say of the singular form, castrum. So much we have all been told from our childhood upward; {{and for the most}} part we have been quite ready to acquiesce in the statement without any further troublesome inquiry on our own account. But in reality the explanation thus vouchsafed us does not help us much towards explaining the real origin and nature of these ancient names. It is true enough as far as it goes, but it does not go nearly far enough. It reminds one a little of Charles Kingsley's accomplished pupil-teacher, with his glib derivation of amphibious, 'from two Greek words, amphi, the land, and bios, the water.' A detailed history of the root 'Chester' in its various British usages may serve to show how far such a rough-and-ready solution as the pupil-teacher's falls short of complete accuracy and comprehensiveness.|$|E
