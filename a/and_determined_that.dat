5|$|Citing Hirabayashi, Chief Justice Stone {{wrote the}} opinion of the court, <b>and</b> <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> the curfew and {{exclusion}} orders were valid, even as applied to citizens of the United States. Stone’s opinion was three pages and did not contain any concurring opinions or dissents, while the Hirabayashi decision had thirty-four pages and two concurring opinions. In Yasui the court affirmed his conviction of the misdemeanor, but ordered re-sentencing since the lower court had determined that the curfew was not valid, and that Yasui had forfeited his citizenship. The Supreme Court remanded (returned) the case back to the district court to determine a sentence in light of these circumstances.|$|E

5|$|Engineers from AG Weser, UB-45s German builder, {{inspected}} the hulk <b>and</b> <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> repair of the wreck was feasible. A {{restoration of the}} submarine to operating condition, as either a training vessel or a military, would cost 21 million leva (about US$250,000 in 1936 dollars), significantly less than the 56 to 65 million leva ($680,000 to $790,000) that a comparable new submarine would cost. Ultimately, the Bulgarian Navy opted to order new submarines from Germany rather than repair UB-45. UB-45s deck gun was reused, however, {{and one of the}} U-boat's diesel engines was restored to operating condition and used on the training ship Assen.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, Walter Sydney Adams, using a 60-inch (1.5m) {{reflector}} at Mount Wilson Observatory, {{observed the}} spectrum of Sirius B <b>and</b> <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> it was a faint whitish star. This led astronomers to conclude {{that it was a}} white dwarf, the second to be discovered. The diameter of Sirius A was first measured by Robert Hanbury Brown and Richard Q. Twiss in 1959 at Jodrell Bank using their stellar intensity interferometer. In 2005, using the Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers determined that Sirius B has nearly the diameter of the Earth, , with a mass 102% of the Sun's.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, Moxon and Carla Smith had a daughter, Stacy Grove Meyer. Meyer died on June 25, 2000 {{after she}} {{fell off a}} ladder and was {{electrocuted}} after touching a 7,200-volt wire while working at Golden Era Productions. Golden Era Productions was cited by the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health for improper wiring precautions near a vault where Grove Meyer had been working. The California Occupational Safety and Health Administration investigated the incident, <b>and</b> <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> her death {{was not related to}} the safety violations at the facility. Grove Meyer had worked for two years at Golden Era Productions in landscaping and maintenance.|$|E

5|$|In 1981, Fisher {{joined the}} faculty of George Mason University School of Law in Arlington, Virginia, {{teaching}} various seminars on negotiation tactics. From 1981 to 1982, Mr. Fisher also served as an advisor to John J. McCloy during the hearings of the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians (established by Congress in 1980). This commission reviewed the impact of Executive Order 9066 on Japanese-Americans <b>and</b> <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> they were the victims of discrimination by the Federal government.

5|$|In 2005, Mayr and Peters {{described}} {{the anatomy of}} a very well preserved specimen of Archaeopteryx, <b>and</b> <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> its anatomy was more like non-avian theropods than previously understood. Specifically, they found that Archaeopteryx had a primitive palatine, unreversed hallux, and hyper-extendable second toe. Their phylogenetic analysis produced the controversial result that Confuciusornis was closer to Microraptor than to Archaeopteryx, making the Avialae a paraphyletic taxon. They also suggested that the ancestral paravian was able to fly or glide, and that the dromaeosaurids and troodontids were secondarily flightless (or had {{lost the ability to}} glide). Corfe and Butler criticized this work on methodological grounds.|$|E
5|$|In June 1776, American Patriot {{officers}} Henry Knox, Nathanael Greene, William Heath, and Israel Putnam {{examined the}} terrain on which Fort Washington would be located; {{they agreed that}} if the fort was properly fortified, it would be practically impossible to take. Later in June, the Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, George Washington, inspected the location <b>and</b> <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> the area {{was the key to}} defense of the lower Hudson. Shortly after Washington's survey, troops from Pennsylvania began construction on the fort under the supervision of Rufus Putnam.|$|E

5|$|It {{is clear}} from several sources that Donnchadh made these grants on the {{condition}} that the Abbey of Paisley established a Cluniac house in Carrick, but that the Abbey did not fulfil this condition, arguing that it was not obliged to do so. The Bishop of Glasgow intervened in 1244 <b>and</b> <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> a house of Cluniac monks from Paisley should indeed be founded there, that the house should be exempt from the jurisdiction of Paisley save recognition of the common Cluniac Order, but that the Abbot of Paisley could visit the house annually. After the foundation Paisley was to hand over its Carrick properties to the newly established monastery.|$|E
5|$|James E. Rhoads, an {{astronomer}} at the Kitt Peak National Observatory, analyzed the burst <b>and</b> <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> it was not strongly beamed. Further analysis by Frail and his colleagues indicated that the total energy released by the burst was approximately 5×1050ergs (5×1043J), and Rhoads determined that the total gamma-ray energy was approximately 3×1050erg (3×1043J). This implied that the gamma-ray and kinetic energy of the burst's ejecta were comparable, effectively ruling out those GRB models which are relatively inefficient at producing gamma rays.|$|E
5|$|The four judges {{then went}} on to decide that the {{jurisdiction}} involved an exercise of judicial power, mentioning an earlier decision of Justice Isaacs, in which he had taken a functional approach, <b>and</b> <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> some functions, when conferred upon a legislative or executive body, can involve the exercise of non-judicial power, but the same functions when conferred on a judicial body involve the exercise of judicial power. The four judges found that the powers conferred on the court, to take evidence and compel witnesses and such, when vested in a judicial body such as the court, involved the exercise of judicial power. As such, the jurisdiction did not offend the separation of powers.|$|E

5|$|The {{supernova}} SN 1006 {{appeared in}} the southern constellation of Lupus during the year 1006 CE. This was the brightest recorded star ever {{to appear in the}} night sky, and its presence was noted in China, Egypt, Iraq, Italy, Japan and Switzerland. It may also have been noted in France, Syria, and North America. Egyptian physician, astronomer and astrologer Ali ibn Ridwan gave the brightness of this star as one-quarter the brightness of the Moon. Modern astronomers have discovered the faint remnant of this explosion <b>and</b> <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> it was only 7,100 light-years from the Earth.|$|E
5|$|Charlotte Johnson taught {{part-time}} at the Nottingham School of Art, {{and managed}} to have Knight enrolled as an 'artisan student' there, paying no fees, aged just 13. At the age of fifteen, and still a student herself, Knight took over her mother's teaching duties when Charlotte {{was diagnosed with cancer}} and became seriously ill. Later Knight won a scholarship and the gold medal in the national student competition held by the then South Kensington Museum. She continued to give private lessons after she left the School of Art, as both she and her sister Evangeline Agnes, known as Sissie, had been left to live alone on very little money, after the deaths of their mother, their sister Nellie and both their grandmothers. At the School of Art, Laura met {{one of the most promising}} students, Harold Knight, then aged 17, <b>and</b> <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> the best method of learning was to copy Harold's technique. They became friends, and married in 1903.|$|E
5|$|In May 1963 Menzies {{announced}} an A£200million increase in defence spending {{over the next}} five years, and proposed to send a team led by Hancock overseas to evaluate Canberra replacements. Early candidates were the French Dassault Mirage IV, the TSR-2, and the U.S. North American A-5 Vigilante, McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II and the TFX. From June to August, Hancock's team visited France, Britain and the United States to evaluate the competitors, <b>and</b> <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> the TFX would be the aircraft best suited for the role. The Mirage IV had insufficient range and the A£108 million price was too expensive. The F-4 and the A-5 were immediately available, but the less expensive F-4 would need air-to-air refueling to reach Indonesia from Australia. The TSR-2 was behind schedule and over budget, was the most expensive at A£122 million for 24 aircraft, and British government support for the program was uncertain. While the TFX was also controversial in the United States, its promised performance specifications and per-aircraft cost were superior to that of the TSR-2. As he did not expect TFX to be available before 1970, however, Hancock recommended buying 36 A-5 aircraft for A£88 million to counteract the perceived imminent threat from Indonesia.|$|E

5|$|Michael's mother, Dowager Empress Marie, {{moved back}} to Anichkov Palace with Michael and Olga. Like most male members of his family, Michael was {{enrolled}} in the military. He completed training at a gunnery school and joined the Horse Guards Artillery. In November 1898, he attained legal adulthood and, just eight months later, became heir presumptive to Nicholas as the middle brother, George, {{was killed in a}} motorcycle accident. George's death and the subsequent change in the line of succession highlighted that Nicholas lacked a son. As the succession was limited to males, his three daughters were ineligible. When Nicholas's wife, Alexandra, became pregnant in 1900 she hoped that the child would be male. She manoeuvred to get herself declared regent for her unborn child in the event of Nicholas's death, but the government disagreed <b>and</b> <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> Michael would succeed regardless of the unborn child's gender. She was delivered of a fourth daughter the following year.|$|E
5|$|Redevelopment of the {{disturbance}} {{was a possibility}} following its degeneration, and on August19, convection once again increased, prompting the JTWC to resume monitoring {{the system as a}} tropical depression at 0900UTC, with the JMA following suit nine hours later. Due to slight wind shear, the depression's circulation center remained slightly displaced from the stronger convection. At 0600UTC on August20, the JTWC determined that {{the disturbance}} had intensified to reach tropical storm status. Upon the 1200UTC upgrade to such an intensity by the JMA, the tropical cyclone was assigned the name Krovanh. Subsequently, following reclassification, Krovanh began to quickly intensify as it tracked in a somewhat southwest bearing. By August21, the tropical storm had begun to develop a banding eye feature. At 0600UTC that day, the JMA upgraded Krovanh to severe tropical storm intensity, whilst the JTWC indicated that the storm intensified into a typhoon. On August22, the JMA reassessed Krovanh as a typhoon <b>and</b> <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> the storm had reached its peak intensity with winds of 120km/h (75mph). Meanwhile, the JTWC analyzed the storm to have peaked with one-minute sustained winds of 165km/h (105mph); this was followed by the storm making landfall on Luzon, just north of Palanan, Isabela, at 1115UTC later that day.|$|E
