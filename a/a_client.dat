5|$|During Artavasdes' imprisonment, a {{civil war}} between the Parthians later took place, which gave him the {{opportunity}} to escape prison.

Artavasdes I was succeeded in the Kingship of Media Atropatene by Asinnalus.|$|E

5|$|In AD 6, Judea, Idumea, and Samaria were {{transformed}} from <b>a</b> <b>client</b> {{kingdom of the}} Roman Empire into an imperial province, also called Judea. A Roman prefect, rather than <b>a</b> <b>client</b> king, ruled the land. The prefect ruled from Caesarea Maritima, leaving Jerusalem to be run by the High Priest of Israel. As an exception, the prefect came to Jerusalem during religious festivals, when religious and patriotic enthusiasm sometimes inspired unrest or uprisings. Gentile lands surrounded the Jewish territories of Judea and Galilee, but Roman law and practice allowed Jews to remain separate legally and culturally. Galilee was evidently prosperous, and poverty was limited enough {{that it did not}} threaten the social order.|$|E

5|$|The {{same year}} that Abaoji became Great Khan, the Chinese warlord Zhu Wen, who in 904 had murdered the last {{legitimate}} emperor of the Tang dynasty, declared the Tang over and named himself emperor of China. His dynasty dissolved quickly, ushering in the fifty-three-year period of disunity known as the Five Dynasties period. One of the five dynasties, the Later Jin (936–947), was <b>a</b> <b>client</b> state of the Khitans.|$|E
5|$|Access to {{the emperor}} by others might be gained at the daily {{reception}} (salutatio), a development of the traditional homage <b>a</b> <b>client</b> paid to his patron; public banquets hosted at the palace; and religious ceremonies.

By the 4th century, as urban centres decayed, the Christian emperors became remote figureheads who issued general rulings, no longer responding to individual petitions.|$|E

With the release of the 4th edition, it was modified and renamed 9P2000.|$|E
5|$|Billy, though experienced, {{is still}} {{somewhat}} goofy and absent-minded. He sometimes helps Harry with scenes and Harry tries {{to convince him}} too {{that he is an}} actor and not a prostitute. On several occasions, Billy picks up men only to discover that the man is not actually his client. In one case he and the man fall in love and they plan to get Billy out of the business and start a life together. Shortly thereafter, Billy mistakes a man (Michael Haynes) for <b>a</b> <b>client</b> in a public restroom and that man stabs him to death.|$|E
5|$|By 1591, {{the king}} of Jaffna Ethirimanna Cinkam was {{installed}} by the Portuguese.

Eventually, a usurper named Cankili II, resisted Portuguese overlordship only to find himself ousted and hanged by Phillippe de Oliveira in 1619. The subsequent rule by the Portuguese saw the population convert to Roman Catholicism. The population also decreased due to excessive taxation, as most people fled the core areas of the former kingdom.|$|E

5|$|During the Iron Age, Celtic culture, {{deriving}} from the Hallstatt and La Tène cultures, arrived from Central Europe. Brythonic was the spoken language during this time. Society was tribal; according to Ptolemy's Geographia there were around 20 tribes in the area. Earlier divisions are unknown because the Britons were not literate. Like other regions {{on the edge}} of the Empire, Britain had long enjoyed trading links with the Romans. Julius Caesar of the Roman Republic attempted to invade twice in 55BC; although largely unsuccessful, he managed to set up <b>a</b> <b>client</b> king from the Trinovantes.|$|E
5|$|From the 1080s, the lordships of South Wales {{were held}} by a {{succession}} of Norman families inter-married with older Welsh houses loyal to the English throne, with many lordships also held by the English King in his own right.
