5|$|Mozart did {{not write}} down a cadenza for the movement, or at least there is no {{evidence}} of him having done so.

Uniquely among Mozart's concertos, the score does not direct the soloist to end the cadenza with a cadential trill. The omission of the customary trill is likely to have been deliberate, with Mozart choosing to have the cadenza connect directly to the coda without one.|$|E
