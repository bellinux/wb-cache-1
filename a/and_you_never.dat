25|$|It's {{a complex}} {{question}} to answer, really. As musicians {{you try to}} find a name for your band that represents you <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> really do, because, basically, names for bands lose their meaning after a while. They become a series of sounds that you associate with people in music. The most important thing for a name is that you can imagine forty-thousand people screaming it in unison.|$|E
25|$|So I {{wrote this}} song that I loved and I {{sent it to}} them and he and Joel, I remember, left me a great message saying, I hate you, you bastard, I love this song. We're gonna have to do it. We're gonna have to re-build the Wiltern Theater, which they had taken down, it was {{a million dollars to}} re-do the ending... and I felt all his hostility for Universal. A guy named Sean Daniels, who was head of production, one day said to me, well there is hostility because we {{understand}} you waited about eight months to come up with that final song <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> did it. I said, where'd you hear that? I did it in two days. He said, Jimmy Iovine. So I went to Jimmy Iovine and I said all that to his, yeah it's true, I know. I blamed you but you can't be upset with me. I'm not like a writer. I've gotta make my way with these people. I had to have a scapegoat.|$|E

A Simple Plan marked the second on-screen collaboration between Paxton and Thornton after One False Move (1992). Thornton recalled, [...] "I {{got a call from}} one of my agents who said, 'John Boorman wants you to do a script that I sent you a year ago <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> read,' I said, 'Send it to me again, and this time I'll really read it.'

500|$|His {{performance}} {{earned him}} another Best Actor Academy Award nomination, 17 {{years after his}} first. Reviews were strong, and the film {{is considered one of}} the best of his later career. In Day, he found a co-star with whom he could build a rapport, such as he had had with Blondell at the start of his career. Day herself was full of praise for Cagney, stating that he was [...] "the most professional actor I've ever known. He was always 'real'. I simply forgot we were making a picture. His eyes would actually fill up when we were working on a tender scene. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> needed drops to make your eyes shine when Jimmy was on the set." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{the verses}} are {{dedicated}} to him, the chorus was written in a third-person point of view, for her fans: [...] "This is for my peoples who just lost somebody / Your best friend, your baby, your man or your lady / Put your hand way up high / We will never say bye / Mamas, daddies, sisters, brothers, friends and cousins / This is for my peoples who lost their grandmothers / Lift your hands to the sky / Because we won't ever say bye bye". As Carey sings the second chorus, she reverts to the singular conversation with her deceased father, however now revisiting 2005, [...] "And you {{never got a chance}} to see how good I've done / <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> got to see me back at No. 1", referencing her return to the top of music with The Emancipation of Mimi. The song does not feature a bridge, instead repeating the chorus twice, once in the same key as the rest of the song, while the other in a raised octave. During the last chorus, Carey's voice is doubled, with her regular tone voice singing softly over the piano chords, while her more prominent and higher pitched vocals are laid over it.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the winter}} of 1982/83, England's winning Ashes team {{travelled}} to Australia under Willis' captaincy. Willis took two three-wicket hauls in two warm-up first-class matches; however, he was absent from two others and Botham took over the captaincy. By now, continuing injury problems were beginning to plague the ageing bowler's body. He took 3/95 in the first Test as Australia reached 424 in reply to England's first innings 411, of which Willis had made 26. Derek Randall's century in England's second innings took them to 358, and Australia reached 73 {{at the close of}} play on the final day for the loss of two wickets, both of which were taken by Willis, leaving the match drawn. Willis picked up 5/66 in the second Test; however, Australia easily reached a low fourth innings target to go 1–0 up. The third Test followed a similar pattern, with England replying with two low scores in the face of Australia's first innings 438, and Australia taking an eight-wicket win to take a 2–0 lead in the series, despite Willis' three wickets. England achieved what was then the narrowest Ashes victory margin of three runs in the fourth Test at Melbourne, with Willis taking three wickets. Wills commentated on the game that [...] "You never give up <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> think it has gone." [...] The fifth match ended in a draw, so Australia won the series 2–1. Across the entire tour, Willis took 28 first-class wickets. In the following World Series Cup between England, Australia and New Zealand, England were knocked out despite 14 wickets for Willis at 21.14.|$|E

500|$|Usher and will.i.am {{shot the}} video {{the weekend of}} March 6, 2010. The video was {{directed}} by Anthony Mandler. In an interview with Rap-Up, Mandler said about {{the concept of the}} video: [...] "...The video is a spectacle. It really emphasizes what we love about Usher and the character and the icon that he is, and most importantly, it’s really a video that showcases his superstardom". The video was released on March 30, 2010, on VEVO and AMTV. According to Mandler, the original idea for the video was citing Max Headroom, a fictional artificial intelligence character from 1980s British television and film. The reference is made when Usher is seen on a flickering television {{at the beginning of the}} video. Mandler specified, commenting, [...] "Max Headroom was always in his room," [...] he continued, [...] "this unidentifiable room, '80s shapes. I used that for inspiration." [...] Usher stated that he wanted to do something theatrical and fun, and that while will.i.am. brought the international sound, he wanted to bring the producer into his world, [...] "working off of each other and playing off of each other as artists, but the cinematography would be artistic and incredible." [...] Mandler described the visuals in the clip as [...] "Hitchcock-ian", as well as simply capturing Usher in his element, as he said he wanted the R singer's talent to take over. He further explained, stating, [...] "The concept was to create a world where we put Usher in a space where he does what I think he does better than anyone else in the world, which is perform at a level and magnitude of a superstar and take us, the viewer, whether audible or visually, on a journey, not a ride. And, in that, I wanted to create an unpredictability, so one set leads to another and another, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> know what's gonna happen. Along the way, Usher becomes our guide. We're so focused on him, we don't notice the change. The thing is unfolding little by little, and you can't quite see far enough ahead to know what's gonna come next." ...|$|E

2500|$|Betza {{also created}} a second 16×16 variant, which he termed Golden Age Chess on a Really Big Board. He wrote: [...] "This game is {{designed}} to create an open position in which development, initiative, and attack are all-important, the positions are too complex to calculate so you must play by intuition, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> count Pawns -- in other words, {{a return to the}} Golden Age!" [...] However, he appears to have considered Chess on a Really Big Board to be the primary 16×16 game, that could be translated to 3D to make 16×16×16 chess.|$|E

Though sympathetic, the judge ruled that Blount was violating the law and was at risk for being drafted into the U.S. military. Blount responded that if inducted, he would use military weapons and training to kill the first high-ranking military officer possible. The judge sentenced Blount to jail (pending draft board and CPS rulings), and then said, [...] "I've never seen a nigger like you before." [...] Blount replied, [...] "No, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> will again." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 2016, it was {{reported}} that the outgoing executive producer of EastEnders, Dominic Treadwell-Collins, had tried to get Tully to return to the show, saying [...] " [...] emailed back and forth, but she's a director now. I briefly considered a recast, but it just didn't sit right. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> know, maybe someone else can woo Sue Tully to come back." [...] He added, [...] "Michelle carries the one unexploded secret—the child. But there are ways around that! So, yes, it was one of my original ideas—bringing Michelle in and the secrets she brings. I love secrets." [...] Instead, Treadwell-Collins introduced Michelle's son with Grant, Mark Fowler, played by Ned Porteous.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2007 {{interview}} with CNN, band member Don Henley declared, [...] "This {{is probably the}} last Eagles album that we'll ever make." [...] When questioned {{about the possibility of}} a follow-up album in November 2010, band member Timothy B. Schmit said, [...] "My first reaction would be: no way. But I said that before the last one, so you never really know. Bands are a fragile entity <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> know what's going to happen. It took a long time to do that last album, over a span of years, really, and it took a lot out of us. We took a year off at one point. I'm not sure if we're able to do that again.

2500|$|Working with Heide Museum for Rings of Saturn, firstly {{we agreed}} on a maquette. Then when I saw the site I knew I had to enlarge the work to do what I call 'conquer the {{landscape}}'. The Australian landscape is an enormously powerful landscape; vast and with clarity of atmosphere, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> know in advance how work will look in it. [...] The landscape grips my imagination – I try to measure my work against the vast spaces of this country. Conquering the landscape does not rely on scale but simplicity and clarity of form expressing inner strength and tension. If my sculpture is outdoors or {{in the public domain}} I like it to arouse people's curiosity to explore the work. Multidimensional objects look different from every angle. The exciting thing about outdoor sculpture is the change with the light, the weather... everything is in constant flux. It becomes almost a living entity.|$|E
