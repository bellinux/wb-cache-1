40|$|ABSTRACT: Intracranial brain parenchymal tuberculomas may form paradoxically, days to {{months after}} {{starting}} <b>antituberculous</b> drug therapy. They may develop {{in and around}} optic chiasm and optic nerves after <b>antituberculous</b> treatment as a quite rare occurrence in tuberculous meningitis (TBM) this may lead to severe visual loss if not treated properly. We describe a 5 year-old child with documented TBM being treated with first line <b>antituberculous</b> drugs which developed visual impairment 3 months after starting the treatment. MRI after gadolinium administration revealed multiple perichiasmatic ring enhancing lesions due to tuberculomas.

40|$|Tuberculous {{meningitis}} (TBM), {{the most}} severe form of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in humans, is associated with significant morbidity and mortality despite successful treatment with <b>antituberculous</b> drugs. This {{is due to the}} irreversible brain damage subsequent to the local inflammatory response of the host to M. tuberculosis. Corticosteroids have been used in conjunction with <b>antituberculous</b> therapy in an attempt to modulate the inflammatory response, but this strategy has been of limited success. Therefore, we examined whether combining <b>antituberculous</b> drugs with the immunomodulatory drug thalidomide or with a new thalidomide analog, immunomodulatory drug 3 (IMiD 3), would be effective in reducing morbidity and mortality in an experimental rabbit model of TBM. Intracisternal inoculation of 5 × 104 CFU of Mycobacterium bovis Ravenel in rabbits induced progressive subacute meningitis characterized by high cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leukocytosis, protein influx, release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), substantial meningeal inflammation, and mortality by day 28. Treatment with <b>antituberculous</b> drugs or with <b>antituberculous</b> drugs plus thalidomide improved the clinical course of disease somewhat and increased survival to about 50 %. In contrast, treatment with <b>antituberculous</b> drugs in combination with IMiD 3 limited pathological neurologic changes and resulted in marked improvement (73 %) in survival. IMiD 3 treatment was also associated with reduced leukocytosis in the CSF and significantly lower levels of TNF in CSF and plasma. Histologically, the meningeal inflammation in animals treated with <b>antituberculous</b> drugs plus IMiD 3 was considerably attenuated compared to that of the other treatment groups. These results suggest a potential role for IMiD 3 in the management of TBM in patients...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the risks}} of disease {{progression}} and transmission to the newborn, treatment of tuberculosis is often pursued during pregnancy and fixed-dose combined <b>antituberculous</b> agents {{have been found to}} be beneficial. Unfortunately, there is paucity of data on the safety of the fixed-dose combined <b>antituberculous</b> drugs during pregnancy. This study intends to assess the teratogenic effect of fixed-dose combined <b>antituberculous</b> drugs on the organogenesis stage of fetal development and also investigate the possible roles of vitamin C in modulating the teratogenic effects of these agents on the fetus using animal model. Pregnant rats were divided into 3 groups with 12 animals per group: group 1 received distilled water (10 [*]mL/kg) orally; group 2 received 51. 4 [*]mg/kg/day of fixed-dose combined <b>antituberculous</b> agents orally; group 3 received 51. 4 [*]mg/kg/day of fixed-dose combined <b>antituberculous</b> agents plus vitamin C (10 [*]mg/kg/day) orally. Six rats in each group were randomly selected and sacrificed on day 20 by cervical dislocation prior to day 21 of gestation, and the foetuses were harvested through abdominal incision for physical examination. Blood samples were collected from the 1 st filial rats of the remaining six animals for biochemical and hematological examination. The liver, kidney, heart, and brain of all the sacrificed animals were used for histopathological examination. There were significant (≤ 0. 05) low birth weights of the foetuses of the animals that were treated with fixed-dose combined <b>antituberculous</b> agents. The haematological parameters also revealed a reduction in the platelets counts and neutrophiles at the first filial generation. Significant (≤ 0. 05) elevations in the levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in the foetuses of the animals treated with fixed-dose combined <b>antituberculous</b> agents were also observed. However, the combination of vitamin C with fixed-dose combined <b>antituberculous</b> agents significantly (≤ 0. 05) reduced the level of AST.

40|$|A {{retrospective}} {{study of the}} prevalence and pattern of tuberculosis in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) was performed. Thirty-eight cases of tuberculosis were diagnosed among 790 patients (18 men, 20 women; mean age, 58 ± 12. 6 years) between July 1994 and June 2000. The interval between the initiation of CAPD and onset of tuberculosis ranged from 1 to 168 months (median, 22 months). There were 18 cases of pulmonary tuberculosis, 14 cases of tuberculous peritonitis, 5 cases of tuberculous lymphadenitis, and 1 case of tuberculous synovitis. Patients with pulmonary tuberculosis usually presented with fever, constitutional symptoms, and pleural effusion or pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiograph. Abdominal pain and turbid dialysate were the main presenting symptoms in patients with tuberculous peritonitis. Diagnosis was established by positive culture in 20 patients, typical histological characteristics on a tissue biopsy specimen in 10 patients, and response to empirical <b>antituberculous</b> treatment in 8 patients. The duration of symptoms before the diagnosis of tuberculosis and initiation of <b>antituberculous</b> treatment ranged from 7 to 57 days (median, 30 days). <b>Antituberculous</b> treatment consisted of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ofloxacin for 9 to 15 months. <b>Antituberculous</b> treatment generally was well tolerated. Twenty-seven patients (71 %) completed <b>antituberculous</b> treatment. No recurrence of tuberculosis was observed after a mean follow-up of 19. 8 months. Eleven patients (29 %) died while on <b>antituberculous</b> treatment; none of the deaths appeared to be directly caused by tuberculosis. We conclude that: (1) tuberculosis is prevalent among CAPD patients in our locality; (2) extrapulmonary tuberculosis, particularly tuberculous peritonitis, is common; and (3) a high index of suspicion for tuberculosis among CAPD patients is warranted to ensure early diagnosis and prompt initiation of treatment. © 2001 by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Background : Tuberculosis is endemic in {{developing}} countries. However, calvarial tuberculosis is rare, even {{in areas where}} tuberculosis is endemic. In the literature, only few case series of calvarial tuberculosis have been reported. Aim : To report a case series of 11 patients with calvarial tuberculosis, and discuss their presentation and management. Materials and Methods : This study is a retrospective analysis of case records of 11 patients with calvarial tuberculosis treated between 2001 and 2005 in a tertiary hospital. Clinical features, radiological findings, surgical and medical management, and outcomes were reviewed. Results : Of the 11 patients, seven were male and the age ranged between 1 and 25 years (mean 15. 09 years). The mean duration of symptoms was 2. 9 months (range 1 - 5 months). The most common presenting features were scalp swelling, discharging sinus, and pain. Computed tomography (CT) scan of brain showed punched out bony defect, with a peripherally enhancing extradural collection {{in most of the}} cases.

40|$|The rise of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} has complicated {{therapy for}} tuberculosis and {{led us to}} search for a potentially active combination of drugs against these strains. The susceptibilities of 12 strains of multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis to standard <b>antituberculous</b> drugs (isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide), clarithromycin, and its metabolite, 14 -hydroxyclarithromycin, were determined by use of the BACTEC radiometric method. All strains were resistant to {{at least two of the}} <b>antituberculous</b> drugs. Clarithromycin and 14 -hydroxyclarithromycin MICs were in the range indicating resistance at > or = 8. 0 micrograms/ml for all strains. Combination testing by the BACTEC method was performed with various concentrations of isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol, and with clarithromycin/ 14 -hydroxyclarithromycin at fixed concentrations of 2. 0 / 0. 5 micrograms/ml, respectively. Addition of clarithromycin/ 14 -hydroxyclarithromycin to these <b>antituberculous</b> drug mixtures resulted in a 4 - to 32 -fold reduction in MICs of isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol and made resistant strains susceptible. Fractional inhibitory concentrations ranged from 0. 23 to 0. 50 for all strains, suggesting a synergistic interaction between standard <b>antituberculous</b> drugs and clarithromycin/ 14 -hydroxyclarithromycin.
