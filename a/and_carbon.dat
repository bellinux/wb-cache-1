30|$|From the table, it may {{be noted}} that the active carbon {{developed}} in this work, namely, NVNC is more effective than commercially available F- 4000 <b>carbon</b> <b>and</b> also than many other active carbons reported in literature such as A. farnesiana fruits carbon, T. angustata plant carbon, Lagenaria siceraria shell <b>carbon,</b> <b>and</b> aluminum-impregnated <b>carbon.</b> Though KMnO 4 -modified carbon prepared from rice straw, aluminum-supported <b>carbon</b> nanotubes, <b>and</b> <b>carbons</b> loaded with specific chemical moieties pecan nut shells (CMPNS) seem to be scoring better than NVNC, they have their inherent disadvantages.
