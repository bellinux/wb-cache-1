5|$|According to Stratton and Martin, {{movement}} is the game's most important pillar.

On March 31, 2016, the release date of the Doom beta, a cinematic trailer directed by Joe Kosinski was created to evoke the game's three core pillars: incessant combat, terrifying demons, and powerful guns.|$|E

5|$|Although {{beginning}} {{during the}} events of , the plot is a retcon to the earliest period in the Mortal Kombat series, {{the events of}} Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat II and Mortal Kombat 3 (as well as the latter title's two updates).

While having characters <b>and</b> <b>levels</b> rendered in three-dimensions, the gameplay distances itself from the fully 3D graphics one seen in the last four games, bearing closer resemblance to that of the 2D era of the series, using a camera that is perpendicular to the two-dimensional playing field.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{aimed to}} examine the {{relationship}} between skull size <b>and</b> the <b>level</b> of cranial vault suture closure. A total of 50 Myrmecophaga tridactyla Linnaeus, 1758 and 178 Tamandua tetradactyla Linnaeus, 1758 skulls were analyzed in relation to 18 skull dimensions. The skulls were grouped into three levels of suture closure: no sutures closed (level 0), one or all the fallowing sutures closed: interfrontalis, sagitalis <b>and</b> coronalis (<b>level</b> 1) <b>and</b> all sutures closed (level 2). The results indicated that among the 18 variables measured, 17 showed significant differences (p ≤ 0. 01) between <b>level</b> 0 <b>and</b> <b>level</b> 1 skulls of T. tetradactyla; as well as between <b>level</b> 0 <b>and</b> <b>level</b> 1, <b>and</b> <b>level</b> 0 <b>and</b> <b>level</b> 2 skulls of M. tridactyla. M. tridactyla <b>level</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>level</b> 2 had no significant difference among any of the 18 dimensions. The foramen magnum height in both species showed no significant difference (p > 0. 05) among any suture categories. In principle, suture closure <b>level</b> <b>and</b> cranial dimensions are related. The specimens with larger cranial dimensions showed greater number of cranial vault sutures closed for both species of anteaters. Tamandua tetradactyla and M. tridactyla specimens with none of the cranial vault suture closed have a foramen magnum height similar to those with cranial vault suture closed...|$|R

5|$|Serum copper is low, {{which may}} seem {{paradoxical}} given that Wilson's {{disease is a}} disease of copper excess. However, 95% of plasma copper is carried by ceruloplasmin which is often low in Wilson's disease. Urine copper is elevated in Wilson's disease and is collected for 24 hours in a bottle with a copper-free liner. Levels above 100 μg/24h (1.6 μmol/24h) confirm Wilson's disease, <b>and</b> <b>levels</b> above 40 μg/24h (0.6 μmol/24h) are strongly indicative. High urine copper levels are not unique to Wilson's disease; they are sometimes observed in autoimmune hepatitis and in cholestasis (any disease obstructing the flow of bile from the liver to the small bowel).|$|E

5|$|The {{biology of}} life {{operates}} {{within a certain}} range of temperatures. Heat {{is a form of}} energy that regulates temperature. Heat affects growth rates, activity, behaviour, and primary production. Temperature is largely dependent on the incidence of solar radiation. The latitudinal and longitudinal spatial variation of temperature greatly affects climates and consequently the distribution of biodiversity <b>and</b> <b>levels</b> of primary production in different ecosystems or biomes across the planet. Heat and temperature relate importantly to metabolic activity. Poikilotherms, for example, have a body temperature that is largely regulated and dependent on the temperature of the external environment. In contrast, homeotherms regulate their internal body temperature by expending metabolic energy.|$|E
