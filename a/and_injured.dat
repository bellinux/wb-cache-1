5|$|Occasionally a Portia {{is killed}} or injured while {{pursuing}} prey up to twice Portia′s size. P. labiata is killed in 2.1% of pursuits <b>and</b> <b>injured</b> but not killed in 3.9%, P. schultzi is killed in 1.7% <b>and</b> <b>injured</b> but not killed in 5.3%, and P. fimbriata in Queensland is killed in 0.06% of its pursuits <b>and</b> <b>injured</b> but not killed in another 0.06%.
