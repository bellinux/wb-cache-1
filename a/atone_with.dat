And feeling that he had fallen low indeed, {{to be trying to}} <b>atone</b> <b>with</b> some miserable gewgaw for never having thought of her all day, because he had been thinking of another, he went in and bought the only ornament whose ingredients did not make his gorge rise, two small pear-shaped black pearls, one at each end of a fine platinum chain. Coming out with it, he noticed over the street, in a clear sky fast deepening to indigo, the thinnest slip of a new moon, like a bright swallow, with wings bent back, flying towards the ground. That meant--fine weather! If it could only be fine weather in his heart! And in order that the azalea might arrive first, he walked up and down the Square which he and Oliver had patrolled the night before.|$|E

In the Satsuma Rebellion, he lost a banner of the emperor in battle, for which he tried to <b>atone</b> <b>with</b> suicidal bravery in order to recapture it, until ordered to stop. In the Russo-Japanese War, he captured Port Arthur but he felt that he had lost too many of his soldiers, so requested permission to commit suicide, which the emperor refused. These two events, as well as his desire not to outlive his master (junshi), motivated his suicide {{on the day of the}} funeral of the Emperor Meiji. His example revitalized the samurai practice of seppuku ritual suicide.|$|E

Meanwhile, Frank was visiting his aunt, who dies soon after he arrives. Now he and Jane reveal to the Westons {{that they have been}} secretly engaged since the autumn but Frank knew that his aunt would disapprove. The strain of the secrecy on the conscientious Jane had caused the two to quarrel and Jane ended the engagement. Frank's easygoing uncle readily gives his blessing to the match and the engagement becomes public, leaving Emma chagrined to discover that she had been so wrong.|$|E

Mead's {{problem was}} that Hindus knew nothing of Jesus while Bengali Muslims thought that they already knew {{everything}} important about him through the Qur'an: they hoped that "correct" acceptance would grant them admission into Heaven. But the New Testament showed that those who only accepted Jesus by mouth would all be utterly annihilated. Mead politely likened the Muslims to those who threw royal robes upon Jesus and then handed him over for crucifixion. Jesus {{said that he had}} come in the world to <b>atone</b> <b>with</b> his life for the sins of humanity. But the Qur'an says that Jesus never died: if true, that would mean that Jesus told a lie.

If she was pregnant with her husband's child, she could not have intercourse with other men before the birth of the child, even if thrown out by him. These rules were binding for Celtic noblewomen, but they may have been less strictly binding on the lower classes. In Wales, the wife was allowed to leave her husband if he committed adultery three times, if he was impotent and if he had bad halitosis taking with her the property which she had brought into the marriage or acquired during it. A rape had to be atoned for by the culprit by handing over the sort of gifts customarily given at a wedding and paying a fine, since it was considered a form of [...] "temporary" [...] marital tie.|$|R

50|$|This {{change from}} more supernatural ideas methods to naturalistic ones is present also in aspects of law other than {{completely}} sacrificial rituals.

These two versions are thought to be intricately woven together, but nevertheless the general content of the rituals are still thought able to be separated. One version is considered to only involve a jealousy offering, of barley, being placed in the woman's hands, and then waved by the priest, with a handful being subsequently burnt, the other version involving the woman drinking cursed water. The version involving the less naturalistic idea of a curse making a woman's thigh rot is thought to represent the earlier law, which subsequently evolved into the other version more concerned <b>with</b> <b>atoning.</b>|$|R

To the right and left, however, our guns got into play, and simultaneously a furious infantry fire broke out along the entire front, the paralyzed center excepted.

The marches counted with the presence of prominent right-wing figures such as former MK Michael Ben-Ari, and Jewish Agency officials. Referring to [...] "the enemy", Ben-Ari called on Israelis to [...] "make Ramadan into a month of darkness for them!" [...] The evening before the killing, a group of racist supporters of the Beitar football club, known as La Familia, held a violent demonstration, in which they chanted [...] "death to Arabs" [...] and harassed Palestinians nearby. In Hebron, settlers assaulted Palestinian residents; in Bethlehem a 9-year-old child was run over by a settler car. A 'rash of racist incitement on Israeli social media' broke out after the deaths were revealed. Rabbi Noam Perel, head of Bnei Akiva, the world's largest religious-Zionist youth organization, urged on his Facebook page that the IDF be transformed into an army of avengers, which [...] "will not stop at 300 Philistine foreskins".
