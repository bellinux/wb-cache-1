5|$|Khan lures Enterprise to {{the space}} station Regula I, and he {{launches}} a surprise attack that disables Kirk's ship. Kirk tricks Khan by using a special code to remotely lower Reliants shields, allowing Enterprise to inflict significant damage. Khan is forced to withdraw to make repairs. Using the mind-controlled Terrell and Chekov as spies, Khan captures the Genesis device and leaves Kirk marooned on Regula I. Spock deceives Khan into thinking that Enterprise is crippled, surprising Khan when Enterprise rescues Kirk and escapes to the nearby Mutara Nebula. Goaded into following Kirk, Khan pilots Reliant into the nebula, where shields and sensors are inoperable. Due to Khan's inexperience with three-dimensional space combat, Enterprise defeats Reliant and Khan is severely wounded. Refusing to accept defeat, Khan activates the Genesis device, intent on killing his foe along with himself. Khan quotes Ahab's words of vengeance from Moby Dick <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>watches</b> Enterprise try to escape.|$|E

5|$|Lisa {{dreams that}} it is December 1944 and that Marge is a soldier in World War II. Due to Marge being taken {{suddenly}} for overseas deployment while buying a Christmas tree the previous year, Lisa has sworn to never see another Christmas tree until Marge returns home safely. However, during Christmas of 1944, the family gets a telegram saying that Marge is missing in action. After hearing the news, Lisa runs away {{to the place where}} she had last seen her mother, the Christmas Tree Farm. The owner of the place says that Marge paid for a tree the previous year but never picked it up. Lisa, believing the tree to be a symbol that Marge is alright, takes it home and decorates it together with Homer and Bart. Marge is then seen assassinating Adolf Hitler with an MP40 in a movie theater in France <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>watches</b> a propaganda film.

5|$|The Resistance use {{the nuclear}} codes and the Spindly Torque {{to mount an}} assault on Deathshead's compound. Rescuing the {{captured}} resistance prisoners and evacuating them, Blazkowicz {{makes it to the}} top of the tower, struggling to Deathshead's workshop. Inside, Deathshead greets Blazkowicz, revealing to him that he possesses the brain of the soldier that Blazkowicz chose to die, and puts it in a robot. The robot comes alive and assaults Blazkowicz, who defeats it and puts his friend to rest by destroying the brain. Commandeering a larger robot mecha, Deathshead then attacks Blazkowicz, who gets the upper hand and destroys the robot, dragging Deathshead out of it. He repeatedly stabs Deathshead, who pulls out a grenade which explodes, killing Deathshead and mauling Blazkowicz. As a gravely wounded Blazkowicz crawls towards a window, he mentally recites The New Colossus <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>watches</b> the Resistance survivors boarding a helicopter, alongside Anya and Set. Seeing that they have reached safety, and bleeding heavily from his injuries, Blazkowicz orders the Resistance to fire the nuclear cannon. After the credits, a helicopter is heard approaching.|$|E
5|$|Rodrigues {{is taken}} to Nagasaki, where he is imprisoned with many Japanese converts. At a tribunal, he is told Catholic {{doctrine}} is anathema to Japan. Rodrigues demands to see governor Inoue Masashige, who he learns, to his dismay, is the old man seated before him {{in charge of the}} proceedings. Rodrigues is returned to prison, and Kichijiro soon arrives to be imprisoned as well. He explains to Rodrigues that court officials threatened him in order that he betray Rodrigues. Kichijiro then says he is a Christian and asks to be absolved of his betrayal through a confession, which Rodrigues reluctantly grants him. He later is released after being told to step on a fumi-e (a crudely carved crucifix), an act symbolizing rejection of the faith. Later, Rodrigues is brought under guard to the shoreline to await someone. In the far distance, he witnesses an emaciated Garupe and three other prisoners approaching on the shoreline under separate guard. Still in the distance, the three other prisoners are taken offshore on a small boat and are about to be drowned from the boat one-by-one as an inducement to get Garupe to renounce his faith. Rodrigues is restrained by guards on shore <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>watches</b> Garupe refuse to apostatize. He then sees the desperate Garupe drowned next to the other three prisoners when he attempts to swim offshore trying to rescue the last prisoner from being drowned.|$|E

5|$|The {{story begins}} in the pre-dawn hours as the young Nick Adams, his father, his uncle and their Indian guides row across a lake to a nearby Indian camp. Nick's father, a doctor, has been called out to deliver a baby {{for a woman who}} has been in labor for days. At the camp, they find the woman in a cabin lying on a bottom bunkbed; her husband lies above her with an injured foot. Nick's father is forced to perform a {{caesarian}} operation on the woman with a jack-knife because the baby is in the breech position; he asks Nick to assist by holding a basin. The woman screams throughout the operation, and when Nick's uncle tries to hold her down, she bites him. After the baby is delivered, Nick's father turns to the woman's husband on the top bunk and finds that he fatally slit his throat with a straight razor during the operation. Nick is sent out of the cabin, and his uncle leaves with two Natives, not to return. The story ends with only Nick and his father on the lake, rowing away from the camp. Nick asks his father questions about birth and death, and thinks to himself that he will never die, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>watches</b> his father row.|$|E

25|$|As {{the narrator}} reads of the knight's forcible {{entry into the}} dwelling, {{cracking}} and ripping sounds are heard somewhere in the house. When the dragon is described as shrieking as it dies, a shriek is heard, again within the house. As he relates the shield falling from off the wall, a reverberation, metallic and hollow, can be heard. Roderick becomes increasingly hysterical, and eventually exclaims that these sounds are being made by his sister, who was in fact alive when she was entombed. Additionally, Roderick somehow {{knew that she was}} alive. The bedroom door is then blown open to reveal Madeline standing there. She falls on her brother, and both land on the floor as corpses. The narrator then flees the house, and, as he does so, notices a flash of moonlight behind him which causes him to turn back, {{in time to see the}} moon shining through the suddenly widened crack. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>watches,</b> the House of Usher splits in two and the fragments sink into the tarn.|$|E
25|$|The Salinas {{prepare to}} attend a ball, {{one of the most}} {{important}} of the Palermo social season. The Prince is both excited and concerned about the evening to come. It will be the first time Angelica and her beauty are to be presented to the public. However, he remains concerned that Don Calogero will make a complete fool of both himself and the Salinas. When Angelica (looking beautiful) and Don Calogero (looking acceptable) arrive shortly after, Angelica, thanks to detailed training in etiquette given to her by Tancredi, makes a huge social success. The Prince, after being satisfied that Angelica has been accepted, wanders through the rooms of the Palazzo Ponteleone where the ball is being held, becoming increasingly gloomy at the callowness of the young men, the boredom in the older men, and the silliness of the girls. The Prince notices Tancredi and Angelica dancing happily together, oblivious to the other's desperation, ambition, and greed. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>watches,</b> the Prince comes to realize and accept, if only for a moment, that whatever happiness the lovers feel is to be celebrated, no matter what.|$|E

500|$|Liszt's Faust and Dante symphonies {{share the}} same {{aesthetic}} stance as the symphonic poems, though they are multi-movement works that employ a chorus, their compositional methods and aims are alike. Two Episodes from Lenau's Faust should also be considered with the symphonic poems. The first, [...] "Der nächtliche Zug", is closely descriptive of Faust <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>watches</b> a passing procession of pilgrims by night. The second, [...] "Der Tanz in der Dorfschenke", which {{is also known as}} the First Mephisto Waltz, tells of Mephistopheles seizing a violin at a village dance.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Myers as Austin Powers, {{receiving}} {{a call from}} his boss Basil Exposition (Michael York) who warns him against a dangerous spy describing her as a [...] "master of disguise". The screen of his car depicts five images of Madonna wearing different looks, and Exposition clarifies {{that she has been}} [...] "seducing our top agents". He also warns Powers [...] "whatever you do don't fall in love. We've already lost 007 and 008". As the video continues, Powers finds Madonna at a club performing in front of a crowd, which includes Verne Troyer in character as Mini-Me. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>watches</b> her perform Powers finds himself fantasizing about the two of them dancing in front of a white background with psychedelic fluorescent whirls. He also visualizes them riding a car together, where Madonna dances suggestively and licks Powers' face while rubbing her crotch and bottom on his cheeks.|$|E

500|$|The {{video is}} set in a forest; Jackson, in scruffy clothes, sings [...] "Childhood" [...] while sitting on a tree stump. The camera moves up the trees into the night sky and flying {{airships}} travel overhead. On board the ships, children are seen playing a variety of games as they travel further away from Jackson, towards the moon. Other children appear in the forest undergrowth before floating up towards the airships, but Jackson remains seated on the tree stump. Although the concept of the video had little in common with the corresponding film, Free Willy 2, two of its actors-Jason James Richter and Francis Capra-appear in the video. Richter appears halfway through, leading the armada of airships. Capra appears {{near the end of the}} video alongside Jackson <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>watches</b> the airships above. Richter looks down and sees him and extends his arm to bring him up to the airship as Capra floats upward toward it. Erika Christensen and Jena Malone also appeared in the video playing baseball. The video for [...] "Childhood" [...] is 4:27 minutes long. In the publication, Doug Pratt's DVD: Movies, Television, Music, Art, Adult, and More!, Pratt describes the video as [...] "outstanding, a Chris Van Allsburg-style vision of children in flying airships, crusading through a forest at night".|$|E
500|$|Writing for The Scotsman, Andrea Mullaney articulated, [...] "Theroux {{really had}} found the {{ultimate}} in weirdness for his latest documentary – they're so beyond the point of reason, into a self-perpetuating psychosis, {{that no matter how}} he tried, he couldn't challenge their beamingly-delivered pronouncements, or trip them up. But he did manage to show them as human beings (more than the courtesy they extend to us sinners)." [...] Hilary Fannin of The Irish Times commented that the airing of the documentary, [...] "saw Louis Theroux, in The Most Hated Family in America, shatter another redneck American target, the Westboro Baptist Church". In a review of the documentary for The Sunday Times, Roland White discussed Theroux's stylistic technique, [...] "Theroux's usual technique [...] the friendly ingenue [...] made absolutely no impact on these people. It was like watching a youngster from a village cricket team trying to bowl out Geoff Boycott, and I began to wonder what Theroux was hoping to achieve. It is impossible to outargue the religious bigot. They have impeccable logic on their side: the word of God is the righteous truth; only they understand the true word of the Lord; therefore, they are right and everybody else is wrong." [...] Liverpool Daily Post recommended the film in its column, [...] "Sunday: What to Watch". Writing for the Birmingham Mail, Graham Young observed, [...] "The Most Hated Family in America is the best documentary from Louis since long before his Michael Jackson fiasco." [...] John Dugdale of The Sunday Times highlighted the film as his [...] "Pick of the day". Dugdale wrote favorably of the film, [...] "There are echoes of Theroux's film about a woman raising her daughters as neo-Nazis <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>watches</b> Phelps' daughter, Shirley, handing out placards to kids as young as seven. While tangling with her and her dad is pointless, the family's younger women are less inflexible, and his encounters with them are more rewarding." [...] A review in the Leicester Mercury noted of Theroux's interview techniques, [...] "His subtle interviewing style was perfect for showing off the crazy views of the members." ...|$|E
500|$|Similar to [...] "If I Can't Love Her", [...] "Evermore" [...] {{provides}} the Beast with [...] "a stronger voice". The song occurs at a pivotal {{moment in the}} film during which the Beast bemoans his decision to free Belle, while uncovering both his inner pain and growth as a character as he voices [...] "a sad sense of longing." [...] For the first time, audiences learn exactly how the Beast feels when he allows Belle to rescue Maurice, summarizing his love for her. In the musical sequence, the Beast continues to climb higher up the turret of his castle to watch Belle as she rides away on her horse and gradually disappears into the distance. Staged {{in a way that}} resembles a live musical due to Stevens' performance and its cinematography, the orchestra increases and swells as the anguished Beast continues to climb. Menken explained that the character, singing [...] "with a raw emotion", watches Belle leave while thinking to himself [...] "I know what love is now, and it's wonderful, even though I'll never see her again", and [...] "Evermore" [...] captures the Beast's agony <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>watches</b> the woman he loves leave him. Citing the song {{as an example of the}} film's characters resorting to singing whenever they find that they are not able to speak, Condon described [...] "Evermore" [...] as one of the film's [...] "dramatic high points", proving that the Beast has finally become [...] "worthy of love". For the Beast, the song represents [...] "an ode to his love for Belle and his unending, longing devotion as she rides away from him, possibly forever", serving as [...] "a profound meditation on his own isolation and heartache". According to Menken, the character is [...] "basically singing about how he now knows what love is". The Beast is now shown to be capable of feeling and expressing human emotions, namely heartbreak, loneliness and helplessness, having learned about true love and sacrifice. According to Zoe Nicholson of The Daily Gamecock, [...] "Evermore" [...] "adds humanity not yet seen in a character regarded as savage or spoiled rotten." [...] Walt Disney Studios president of music and soundtracks Mitchell Leib described the scene as the film's [...] "Phantom of the Opera moment." [...] Traditionally in Disney films, heroines are typically assigned [...] "rousing" [...] musical numbers to perform. Screen Rant contributor Kacey Spivey observed that Belle's departure and the scene represents a reversal of the traditional fairy tale trope in which a princess is trapped in a tower. Instead the Beast is confined to his tower, longing for the heroine to return and free him from his enchantment. Brett Nachman compared the scene to Quasimodo performing [...] "Out There" [...] in Disney's animated musical The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996).|$|E
