5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> {{campaign}} continued, the Coalition's {{expectations of}} an Iraqi offensive decreased. As a result, the United States redeployed the XVIII Airborne Corps and the VII Corps 480kilometers (300mi) to the west. The Coalition's leadership believed that should an Iraqi force {{go on the}} offensive, it would be launched from the al-Wafra oil fields, in Southern Kuwait.|$|E
5|$|Near Townsend, Wisconsin, a UFO crashes in the woods. When {{the deputy}} sheriff arrives on the scene, he is {{killed by an}} {{invisible}} figure while surrounded by bright white light. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> Force monitors the crash, Colonel Calvin Henderson, the military's UFO reclamations expert, launches an operation {{to clean up the}} site.|$|E
5|$|Subsonic-cruise unarmed decoy: SCUD {{resembled the}} B-52 on radar. As an active decoy, it carried ECM and other devices, {{and it had}} a range of several hundred miles. Although SCUD was never {{deployed}} operationally, the concept was developed, becoming known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> launched cruise missile (ALCM-A).|$|E

5|$|In July 1942 the U-boats {{became aware}} of Coastal Command {{aircraft}} using another innovation – sonobuoys, which were thought of <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> equivalent of the Navy's ASDIC. A U-boat reported them on 29 July being dropped in the north transit area, and they were thought by the enemy to be devices for preventing U-boats from travelling on the surface. They were, in fact, for detecting submerged U-boats, and were used by No. 210 Squadron RAF, operating Sunderlands. In operational records they were coded High Tea. Most crews were unaware of their existence. The devices stayed in use until 1998, when some wartime crews saw {{them for the first}} time. Until then the RAF had kept them secret.|$|E
5|$|Industrialists such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, Andrew W. Mellon, and Charles M. Schwab {{built their}} {{fortunes}} in Pittsburgh. Also based in Pittsburgh was George Westinghouse, credited with such advancements <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> brake {{and founder of}} over 60 companies, including Westinghouse Air and Brake Company (1869), Union Switch & Signal (1881), and Westinghouse Electric Company (1886). Banks {{played a key role}} in Pittsburgh's development as these industrialists sought massive loans to upgrade plants, integrate industries and fund technological advances. For example, T. Mellon & Sons Bank, founded in 1869, helped to finance an aluminum reduction company that became Alcoa.|$|E
5|$|On 18 December 1939, Vickers Wellington bombers {{carried out}} a raid on German {{shipping}} in what became known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> Battle of the Heligoland Bight. Detected on radar and engaged en route to their targets, over half the attacking force was destroyed or damaged beyond repair. Ludlow-Hewitt presented {{a report on the}} attack on 22 December 1939, noting that flying straight and level for the CSBS made the bombers easy targets for fighters and anti-aircraft gunners. He again pressed for a new bombsight that featured stabilization to allow the aircraft to manoeuvre while it approached the target.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Air</b> Force {{underwent}} several name {{changes during}} the 1950s, being known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Dominican Military Aviation during 1952-55 and 1957-62 and <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Dominican <b>Air</b> Force during 1955-57. In 1962 it again became known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Dominican <b>Air</b> Force, <b>the</b> name {{is still in}} use today.|$|R
25|$|The corps was {{originally}} established <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Northern <b>Air</b> Defence Corps in February 1957 with headquarters at Severomorsk, Murmansk Oblast, part of <b>the</b> Northern <b>Air</b> Defence Army. On 21 March 1960 it gained a combined-arms number <b>as</b> <b>the</b> 21st <b>Air</b> Defence Corps, {{and at the}} same time <b>the</b> Northern <b>Air</b> Defence Army became <b>the</b> 10th <b>Air</b> Defence Army.|$|R
50|$|In 1946, Godman was {{reassigned to}} <b>the</b> Tenth <b>Air</b> Force <b>as</b> part of <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> Force Reserve. <b>The</b> 315th Army <b>Air</b> Force Base Unit became the host organization, and the 477th Bomb Group {{remained}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> flying organization until its inactivation in October 1946. Redesignated <b>as</b> <b>the</b> 315th <b>Air</b> Force Base Unit in September 1947 {{with the establishment}} of <b>the</b> United States <b>Air</b> Force, it was further redesignated <b>as</b> <b>the</b> 2236th <b>Air</b> Force Reserve Training Center in July 1948. Concurrently, Godman Field was renamed Godman Air Force Base.|$|R
5|$|Raw {{subsequently}} {{served in}} staff and diplomatic roles until 1965, {{when he took}} command of No. 82 Wing. Between May 1966 and April 1967, he served <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> support coordinator for the Australian forces in South Vietnam; his initial refusal to commit RAAF helicopters to assist the Australian Army force that {{was in danger of}} being defeated during the Battle of Long Tan in August 1966 generated lasting controversy. Raw served in various staff and training positions until 1972, when he was appointed the commander of RAAF Base Butterworth. He returned to Australia in 1976 and retired from the RAAF two years later.|$|E
5|$|The ZBGM-75 Advanced Intercontinental Ballistic Missile, {{also known}} as Weapons System 120A (WS-120A), was a program to develop an {{intercontinental}} ballistic missile (ICBM), proposed by the United States Air Force in the 1960s {{as a replacement for}} the LGM-30 Minuteman <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> Force's standard ICBM. Funding was not allocated for the program and the project was cancelled in 1967.|$|E
5|$|The air pistol {{range is}} the same <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> rifle range, giving each shooter a table, a 1metre wide firing point, and a 10-metre {{distance}} between the firing line and the target line. The current rules require ranges to be built indoors, with specified minimum requirements for artificial lighting. Many of the top-level competitions are held at temporary ranges installed in versatile sporting facilities or convention centres.|$|E

5|$|After a posting to Amberley, Queensland, Cresswell {{served on}} the {{directing}} staff {{of the first two}} courses held at the newly formed RAAF Staff College, Point Cook. The college was the successor organisation to the wartime RAAF Staff School, and commenced its first six-month course on 13June 1949. Cresswell had by this time reverted to the rank of squadron leader, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> force and its wartime officer corps shrank dramatically following demobilisation. On 10July 1950, he was appointed commanding officer of No.21 (City of Melbourne) Squadron, a Citizen Air Force unit based at Laverton and equipped with Mustangs crewed by reserve pilots. Cresswell was unimpressed by what he saw as the casual attitude displayed by his part-time pilots and soon had them practising appropriate fighter tactics.|$|E

5|$|An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump {{followed}} in 1768, the emotionally charged experiment contrasting with the orderly scene from The Orrery. The painting, which measures 72 by 94½inches (183 by 244cm), shows a white cockatoo fluttering in panic <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> is slowly {{withdrawn from the}} vessel by the pump. The witnesses display various emotions: {{one of the girls}} worriedly watches the fate of the bird, while the other is too upset to observe and is comforted by her father; two gentlemen (one of them dispassionately timing the experiment) and a boy look on with interest, while the young lovers {{to the left of the}} painting are absorbed only in each other. The scientist himself looks directly out of the picture, as if challenging the viewer to judge whether the pumping should continue, killing the bird, or whether the air should be replaced and the cockatoo saved.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> {{ambulance}} {{prepares to}} land outside {{the emergency department}} a rotor blade is struck by a drone, causing the helicopter to crash land {{in the parking lot}} outside the hospital and into the back of an ambulance, causing the ambulance to knock scaffolding down over Alicia Munroe (Chelsea Halfpenny) and Ethan Hardy (George Rainsford). The tail of the helicopter smashes into the entrance of the emergency department causing brutal injuries. The department is shut down following the incident, with Connie and Grace’s lives prioritised. Grace is freed from the helicopter and taken into the department for treatment. Connie learns Grace has life-threatening injuries and may not survive surgery. The staff at Holby City come together to treat casualties of the accident. Grace survives surgery, but remains in a critical condition.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, Lympne was {{designated}} a First Class Landing Ground and the Day and Night Bombing Observation School was formed here in May. The RFC and the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) were merged {{to form the}} Royal Air Force (RAF) in April 1918. From 17 July 1919, No. 120 Squadron RAF flew air mail services between Lympne and Cologne, Germany, using de Havilland DH.9 aircraft fitted with Beardmore Halford Pullinger engines. This service ended on 1 September 1919 when 120 squadron moved to RAF Hawkinge. Hawkinge and Lympne lay within {{a few miles of}} each other and <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> Ministry could not justify keeping the two bases open following the end of the war, they decided to retain Hawkinge. In August 1919 the RAF moved out of Lympne and it was turned over to civilian use, although 120 Squadron did not depart until 21 October.|$|E

5|$|In late May 2011, Sukhoi {{delivered}} the first Su-35S to Akhtubinsk to conduct state joint tests with the Defence Ministry {{to prepare the}} aircraft for operational service. Before {{the start of the}} tests, the aircraft's Su-35's avionics and integrated defence systems were reportedly not up to the standard of American aircraft. The first of two stages of the trials commenced in August 2011. By March 2012, the two prototypes and four production aircraft were conducting flights <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> force tested the type's technical characteristics, which were assessed {{by the end of that}} year to have generally complied with requirements. Of the batch of six production aircraft that were handed over in December 2012, five flew to the Gromov Flight Research Institute in Zhukovsky where the aircraft would, in February 2013, start the second stage of the trials. This stage, which was scheduled to last eighteen months, would focus on the Su-35's weapons and manoeuvrability in combat.|$|E
5|$|More than 80percent of Madagascar's 14,883 {{plant species}} are found {{nowhere else in}} the world, {{including}} five plant families. The family Didiereaceae, composed of four genera and 11 species, {{is limited to the}} spiny forests of southwestern Madagascar. Four-fifths of the world's Pachypodium species are endemic to the island. Three-fourths of Madagascar's 860 orchid species are found here alone, as are six of the world's nine baobab species. The island is home to around 170 palm species, three times as many as on all of mainland Africa; 165 of them are endemic. Many native plant species are used as herbal remedies for a variety of afflictions. The drugs vinblastine and vincristine are vinca alkaloids, used to treat Hodgkin's disease, leukemia, and other cancers, were derived from the Madagascar periwinkle. The traveler's palm, known locally as ravinala and endemic to the eastern rain forests, is highly iconic of Madagascar and is featured in the national emblem as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> Madagascar logo.|$|E
5|$|Taylor and Westmoreland {{began to}} lobby Kỳ and Thi, {{the two most}} {{powerful}} generals in the junta outside Khánh, hoping to enlist them {{in an effort to}} shut down Phát and Thảo while also removing Khánh. Kỳ was the most convenient outlet, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> force along with both the American and South Vietnamese military headquarters were adjacent to one another at Tan Son Nhut, making communication easy, whereas Thi was commanding I Corps in the far north. Westmoreland communicated with Kỳ through the latter’s adviser, Robert R. Rowland. Despite his inconvenient geographical location, Thi was seen as being hostile to Khánh by this point in time, and as a supporter of and commander of a region which was seen as the Buddhist heartland of Vietnam, he and his grassroots support base were strongly opposed to the Diemist pro-Catholic ideology espoused by Phát and Thảo.|$|E
