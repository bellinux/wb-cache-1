5|$|Nucleotides <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> amino acids, {{carbon dioxide}} and formic acid in {{pathways}} that require large amounts of metabolic energy. Consequently, most organisms have efficient systems to salvage preformed nucleotides. Purines are synthesized as nucleosides (bases attached to ribose). Both adenine and guanine <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> the precursor nucleoside inosine monophosphate, which is synthesized using atoms from the amino acids glycine, glutamine, and aspartic acid, as well as formate transferred from the coenzyme tetrahydrofolate. Pyrimidines, on the other hand, are synthesized from the base orotate, which is formed from glutamine and aspartate.|$|E

5|$|During the Spanish era Rondalya music, where {{traditional}} string orchestra mandolin type {{instruments were}} used, was widespread.

5|$|Apart {{from the}} churches, each area {{has its own}} characteristics. Most of Bath's Grade I listed {{buildings}} <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> the local golden-coloured Bath Stone, and date from the 18th and 19th centuries. Their dominant architectural style is Georgian. In the Mendip district, the greatest concentrations of these cluster around the cathedral and abbey in Wells and in Glastonbury. North Somerset features bridges and piers along with a selection of Manor houses. The Sedgemoor district has many buildings related to trade and commerce centred on Bridgwater; while in South Somerset abbeys, priories and farmhouses predominate.

5|$|Archaea {{differ from}} {{bacteria}} in both their genetics and biochemistry. For example, while bacterial cell membranes <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> phosphoglycerides with ester bonds, archaean membranes {{are made of}} ether lipids. Archaea were originally described as extremophiles living in extreme environments, such as hot springs, but have since been found in all types of habitats. Only now are scientists beginning to realize how common archaea are in the environment, with Crenarchaeota being {{the most common form}} of life in the ocean, dominating ecosystems below 150 m in depth. These organisms are also common in soil and play a vital role in ammonia oxidation.|$|E
5|$|Bees {{have been}} kept in hives {{since at least the}} First Dynasty of Egypt, five {{thousand}} years ago, and man had been harvesting honey from the wild long before that. Fixed comb hives are used {{in many parts of the}} world and <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> any locally available material. In more advanced economies, where modern strains of domestic bee have been selected for docility and productiveness, various designs of hive are used which enable the combs to be removed for processing and extraction of honey. Quite apart from the honey and wax they produce, honey bees are important pollinators of crops and wild plants, and in many places hives are transported around the countryside to assist in pollination.|$|E
5|$|Chancellor Law's Fountain – Unveiled in May 1871, the {{fountain}} was sculpted by Turner and Allen of London.
