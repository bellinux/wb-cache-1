5|$|The {{absence of}} any {{reference}} to a Davidic son-ship in the gospel text suggests that Jesus has been elected to be the end-time prophet, the Chosen One, sent to <b>abolish</b> <b>the</b> Jewish sacrifices. The Prophet-Christology of the gospel text quoted by Epiphanius is more {{at home with the}} Clementine literature than the Christology of the Ebionites known to Irenaeus. According to scholars Richard Bauckham and Petri Luomanen, Jesus is understood in this gospel as having come to <b>abolish</b> <b>the</b> sacrifices rather than substituting for them; thus it is unlikely that it contained the same institution of the Eucharist as practiced by Nicene orthodox Christianity. However, scholars have yet to reach a consensus over the sacrificial significance of Jesus' mission as depicted in the Ebionite gospel.|$|E
5|$|Wilberforce's {{life and}} work have been commemorated in the United Kingdom and elsewhere.

5|$|A 1943 {{attempt by}} Somervell to <b>abolish</b> <b>the</b> Technical Services failed amid the furor and panic created by false rumors {{that he was}} being {{considered}} for the post of chief of staff if Marshall was sent to Europe to command the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force. Somervell sometimes pushed extravagant white elephant projects, such as the Canol Road, which he continued long after the strategic imperative behind it had faded.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Cold War {{there have}} been a number of {{attempts}} to curb military activity or even <b>abolish</b> <b>the</b> armed forces altogether. A notable referendum on the subject, launched by an anti-militarist group, was held on 26 November 1989. It was defeated with about two thirds of the voters against the proposal. A similar referendum, called for before, but held shortly after the 11 September attacks in the US, was defeated by over 78% of voters.|$|E

Paul {{believes}} that the country could <b>abolish</b> <b>the</b> individual income tax by scaling back federal spending to its fiscal year 2000 levels; financing government operations would be primarily by excise taxes and non-protectionist tariffs. He endorses eliminating most federal government agencies, terming them unnecessary bureaucracies.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} common {{indication}} for tracheal intubation is for the placement of a conduit through which nitrous oxide or volatile anesthetics may be administered. General anesthetic agents, opioids, and neuromuscular-blocking drugs may diminish or even <b>abolish</b> <b>the</b> respiratory drive. Although {{it is not the}} only means to maintain a patent airway during general anesthesia, intubation of the trachea provides the most reliable means of oxygenation and ventilation and the greatest degree of protection against regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration.|$|E
5|$|Several {{proposals}} to <b>abolish</b> <b>the</b> Electoral College by constitutional amendment {{have been introduced}} in Congress over the decades. These efforts have, however, been hampered {{by the fact that}} a two-thirds vote in both the House and Senate are required to send an amendment to the states, where ratification by three-fourths of the State legislatures or by conventions in three fourths of the states is required for it to become operative.|$|E

The party {{believes that}} regular people should rather decide what good culture is, and demands that artists on public support should offer something the audience wants. It also wants to <b>abolish</b> <b>the</b> annual fee for the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation and privatise the company.

5|$|A second {{conflict}} emerged {{just before}} the end of his term, when in 1945, the Labour government sought to <b>abolish</b> <b>the</b> country quota, a system that gave additional electoral seats in rural areas. Farming groups – predominantly National-supporting – strongly opposed the move, and argued that such a major change could only be made after gaining approval in a general election. Newall sympathised, and advised Fraser to wait until after the election, but did not feel it was appropriate to intervene; he assented to the bill.|$|E
5|$|Advocacy of such {{a nation}} became illegal when separatist demands were banned by law in 1957. Regardless of these measures, a Dravida Nadu Separation Day was {{observed}} on 17 September 1960 resulting in numerous arrests. However, Periyar resumed his campaign in 1968. He wrote an editorial on 'Tamil Nadu for Tamilians' in which he stated, that by nationalism only Brahmins had prospered and nationalism had been developed to <b>abolish</b> <b>the</b> rights of Tamils. He advocated that there was need to establish a Tamil Nadu Freedom Organization {{and that it was}} necessary to work towards it.|$|E

The Student Action Committee on their behalf urged fellow students to return to the campuses.|$|R
30|$|An {{important}} question arises {{as to why}} only <b>the</b> Taiheiyo Coalmine <b>abolished</b> <b>the</b> gaikin system, and why the other mine unions were not eager to dismantle it. There are two reasons for this. First, in 1970, when Taiheiyo <b>abolished</b> <b>the</b> gaikin system, there were only large coalmines operating in Japan, {{most of which were}} facing imminent closure. So finding how to keep operations going and deferring closure was a more pressing issue than <b>abolishing</b> <b>the</b> gaikin system.|$|R

5|$|As a result, the {{referendum}} on 29 April was categorically rejected with 802,512 votes (42.4%) for abolition and 1,089,193 votes (57.5%) against. This {{would be the}} last attempt to <b>abolish</b> <b>the</b> council and, as the first time the NSW Labor party had lost a state poll in many years, was widely seen as {{the beginning of the end}} for the Labor government, which had been in power since 1941.

5|$|As the {{political}} climate in New South Wales became more volatile after Lang's attempts to <b>abolish</b> <b>the</b> Legislative Council and conflict with the Federal Government over debts, Bruxner emphasised the need that the Country Party remain independent of the United Australia Party (which had succeeded the Nationalist Party) amidst calls for the opposition to unite. On 26 April 1932, Country Party Leader Buttenshaw notified the party of his intention to resign. Bruxner was then elected as the new party Leader.|$|E
5|$|Clark's ruling drew a {{resolution}} of condemnation from the Kentucky General Assembly. He was summoned {{to appear before the}} legislature, but opted to respond to their charges in writing instead. Incensed, the legislature attempted to removed him from office, but the vote of 5935 fell short of the needed two-thirds majority. In October 1823, Clark's decision was upheld by the Kentucky Court of Appeals; that decision touched off the Old Court-New Court controversy, wherein the legislature attempted to <b>abolish</b> <b>the</b> Court of Appeals {{and replace it with a}} more sympathetic court.|$|E

In the late 1960s, Vivian Seton, Massaquoi's daughter, had the autobiographical manuscript microfilmed for preservation. After Massaquoi's death, her writings and notes were rediscovered, edited and published in 2013 as The Autobiography of an African Princess.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{these new}} rules, {{football}} remained a violent sport. Dangerous mass-formations, which involved interlocking interference, like the flying wedge resulted in serious injuries and deaths.

In response, sixty-two colleges and universities met in New York City to discuss rule changes on December 28, 1905, and these proceedings resulted {{in the formation of}} the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States, later named the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).|$|E

However, in 1985 the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in the Reference re Manitoba Language Rights that §23 still applied, and that legislation published only in English was invalid (unilingual legislation was declared valid for a temporary period to allow time for translation).|$|E
