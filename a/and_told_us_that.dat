2500|$|In a 1920 {{interview}} with historian James Cowan, Te Kahu-Pukoro, a fighter {{who took part}} in the attack, explained: [...] "The Pai-marire religion was then new, and we were all completely under its influence and firmly believed in the teaching of Te Ua and his apostles. Hepanaia Kapewhiti was at the head of the war-party. He was our prophet. He taught us the Pai-marire karakia (chant), <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> if we repeated it as we went into battle the pakeha bullets would not strike us. This we all believed." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{next day}} trains loaded with workers from {{factories}} in Oltenia arrived in Timișoara. The regime {{was attempting to}} use them to repress the mass protests, but after a brief encounter they ended up joining the protests. One worker explained, [...] "Yesterday our factory boss and a party official rounded us up in the yard, handed us wooden clubs <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> Hungarians and ‘hooligans’ were devastating Timișoara and that it is our duty to go there and help crush the riots. But I realised that wasn't the truth." ...|$|E
2500|$|Three weeks later, on 30 April 1864, {{the measure}} of devotion to the Hauhau {{movement}} displayed itself in the reckless march by 200 warriors on the Sentry Hill redoubt, 9km north-east of New Plymouth, in a one-sided battle that cost the lives of possibly {{a fifth of the}} Māori force. The redoubt had been built in late 1863 by Captain W. B. Messenger and 120 men of the Military Settlers on the crown of a hill that was the site of an ancient pā, and garrisoned by a detachment of 75 men from the 57th Regiment under Captain Shortt, with two Coehorn mortars. The construction of the outpost was regarded by the Atiawa as a challenge, being built close to the Māori position at Manutahi and on their land. In April 1864 a war party was formed of the best fighting men from the west coast iwi that had joined the rapidly spreading Hauhau movement. In a 1920 interview with historian James Cowan, Te Kahu-Pukoro, a fighter {{who took part in the}} attack, explained: [...] "The Pai-marire religion was then new, and we were all completely under its influence and firmly believed in the teaching of Te Ua and his apostles. Hepanaia Kapewhiti was at the head of the war-party. He was our prophet. He taught us the Pai-marire karakia (chant), <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> if we repeated it as we went into battle the pakeha bullets would not strike us. This we all believed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Yes, Parson <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that.</b> Well, well! Why, it {{was only}} two days ago that Tom Stevens came in. He has growed to be a fine young fellow too, <b>and</b> he <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> you were well and hearty and had been through lots of fights. But he didn’t say nothing about your having come home.” ...|$|R
60|$|The {{night of}} the burial he laid {{his hand on the}} old {{horseshoe}} nailed as a charm to the foremast, <b>and</b> solemnly <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that,</b> in less than three weeks, not one quarter of our number would remain aboard the ship--by that time they would have left her for ever.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing; but John Flett and David Mowat passed our stage {{yesterday}} in a canoe, <b>and</b> they <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> the hut of old Liz Rollin {{has been carried}} away with her and her father and Winklemann's mother, {{and they say that}} her son has been seen in a small canoe rangin' about by himself like a madman searchin' for her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That was so," [...] {{the colonel}} agreed, [...] "for I {{know that you}} were talking to me when Hoolan ran in <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> there was a row in the town. On what do you base your suspicions, O'Grady?" ...|$|E
60|$|When Mr. Malcolm MacPherson had gone, {{after an}} hour of useless pleading, Aunt Olivia came up to us, pale and prim and determined, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> there was to be no wedding. We could not pretend surprise, but Peggy ventured a faint protest.|$|E
6000|$|... "We did," [...] said they, [...] "till the Fishes swam down <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> {{some day}} {{they would come}} for us and not hurt us at all and carry us away. So now we are playing at being babies down here. The people like it." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2004, the Bureau {{considered}} {{filing a}} lawsuit against Mel Gibson, the director of The Passion of the Christ, and the film’s distributor in Russia. Brod said [...] "several Jewish organizations <b>and</b> individuals <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> the film fuels ethnic hatred and cultivates xenophobic myths about the Jewish people’s guilt for crucifying Christ". He also approved Russian military action against Georgia in 2008, saying that Russian troops prevented a genocide there.|$|R
6000|$|Lest {{the reader}} should fancy {{that we are}} here merely inventing a mode of action, it may be well to state that we have conversed with a man styled [...] "the Rescue," [...] whose duty it was to watch the boys of Aberdeen while bathing on the {{dangerous}} coast there, <b>and</b> who <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> he had saved some hundreds of lives--many {{of them in the}} manner above described.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{were looking}} for Mr. Wumble--and you know it. I care nothing for your Mr. Wimple. <b>And</b> besides, you <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> the Western Palace and the Palace of the West were one and the same. That was a {{deliberate}} falsehood." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We feel it so,--Clary and I,--and so does Mary. I can't {{tell you}} the sort of anxiety we were in all day yesterday. First we got the {{telegram}} about your arm,--and then Stemm came down at eight <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> you were returned. Stemm was quite humane on the occasion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ma can't believe to-morrow is {{the last}} day, or she wouldn't scold like that," [...] she told us; and this comforted us until after dinner, when the Story Girl and Peter came over <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> Uncle Roger had really gone to Summerside. Then we plunged down into fear and wretchedness again.|$|E
60|$|The {{next morning}} at breakfast, old Tonoi ran in, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> the voyagers were returning. We hurried down to the beach, and saw the boat gliding toward us, with a dozing {{islander}} at the helm, and Zeke standing up in the bows, jingling a small bag of silver, the proceeds of his cargo.|$|E
60|$|I {{never knew}} {{scientists}} could rise to such occasions. Old Mangum orally labelled and classified Goodloe and myself easily {{among the lowest}} orders of the vertebrates; and in English, too, without going any further into Latin than the simple references to Orgetorix, Rex Helvetii--which {{is as far as}} I ever went, myself. <b>And</b> he <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> if he ever caught us around his house again he would add us to his collection.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Little didst thou {{think of}} our woe and grief when thy palfrey was found {{standing}} riderless at the stable door, <b>and</b> Sister Scholastica <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> there he had been since nones! And she had none to send in quest but Cuddie, the neatherd.' ...|$|R
60|$|The {{gratitude}} {{they expressed}} for our kindly using {{the two young}} women I have mentioned, was a token of generous principles; <b>and</b> our men <b>told</b> <b>us,</b> <b>that</b> they would have given them whatever they could have asked, that was {{in their power to}} bestow.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was almost}} a sob that burst from them, and moaningly they asked when help was coming. At that moment a man ascended the ramparts <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> the protonotary had {{received}} a letter from the Pope, in which he informed him that relief was on the way. A cheer broke from us. At last! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, dear; {{he passed}} away half an hour ago, {{a few minutes after}} Dr. Leeds returned. The doctor ran down himself for a moment, almost {{directly}} he had gone up, and said that the General was sinking fast, and that the end might come at any moment. Ten minutes later he came down <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> all was over." ...|$|E
60|$|About {{nine o'clock}} that evening, Pomona {{came to us}} with tears in her eyes, and the canary-haired baby in her arms, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> Corinne was lost. They had searched everywhere; {{they had gone to}} the police; telegrams had been sent to every station; they had done {{everything}} that could be done, but had found no trace of the child.|$|E
6000|$|... "Lesher {{also said}} that you were angry at us for leaving the ship before the rest, and that you had said you would have us all tried for mutiny the first chance you got. Baxter said the same, <b>and</b> also <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> you were going to dump all the rum and other liquor into the ocean, so that the mate and none of the others could get a drop of it while they stayed on the islands." ...|$|R
5000|$|It {{has been}} claimed that Saudi Prince Bandar cut {{the price of}} oil (thus {{reducing}} gas prices) to help ensure a Bush victory. According to a 60 Minutes broadcast, [...] "Prince Bandar enjoys easy access to the Oval Office. His family and the Bush family are close. <b>And</b> Woodward <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> Bandar has promised the president that Saudi Arabia will lower oil prices in the months before the election to ensure the U.S. economy is strong on Election Day." ...|$|R
60|$|To {{put an end}} to the matter, we went upstairs, {{and asked}} the traffic superintendent, <b>and</b> he <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> he had just met a man, who said he had seen it at number three platform. We went to number three platform, but the {{authorities}} there said that they rather thought that train was the Southampton express, or else the Windsor loop. But they were sure it wasn’t the Kingston train, though why they were sure it wasn’t they couldn’t say.|$|R
6000|$|... "We at Craighall {{heard nothing}} of this history till after {{the search was}} over, but it was told us on the morrow {{by some of the}} {{servants}} who had been with the rest at the search; and on Saturday Glasclune's son came over to Craighall <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> William Soutar had given a very distinct account of it to his father.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Goyles met us on deck, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> {{lunch was}} ready. I must admit Goyles had secured the {{services}} of a very fair cook. The capabilities of {{the other members of the}} crew I had no opportunity of judging. Speaking of them in a state of rest, however, I can say of them they appeared to be a cheerful crew.|$|E
6000|$|... "The God of Israel be thanked and praised, my children!" [...] Martha exclaimed. [...] "He {{has brought}} {{you back to}} us, as from the dead, for we never thought to see you again. Some of the {{fishermen}} returned, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> they saw your boat, far on the lake, before the storm burst; and none held out hope {{that you could have}} weathered such a storm." ...|$|E
60|$|None of us could. We went to {{the grown-ups}} <b>and</b> <b>told</b> them so; <b>and</b> the grown-ups, with unaccustomed {{understanding}} <b>and</b> sympathy, <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> we need not. Then we roamed about in our wretchedness and tried to comfort one another. We avoided the orchard; it was for us too full of happy memories to accord with our bitterness of soul. Instead, we resorted to the spruce wood, where the hush and the sombre shadows and the soft, melancholy sighing of {{the wind in the}} branches over us did not jar harshly on our new sorrow.|$|R
2500|$|Dibaba did {{not enter}} the 5000 metres at the World Championships, despite saying in July {{immediately}} after her Paris 5000 metres victory that she intended to contest both events. In explaining her decision to skip the race, she denied that she was avoiding longtime rival Meseret Defar, saying, [...] "The [...] federation asked us to just run one race each, and that's why I left that race. Both of us have run many times, <b>and</b> they <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> they wanted upcoming athletes to have a chance, and we agreed with that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know that}} Antoinette made millions, {{after her father}} died, from the mines. By current report she retired and {{invested}} her money wisely, in sound securities, which accords with her excellent business reputation. Her daughter not being of age--let me see: {{she must have been}} but eleven when her mother passed away--there would be a guardian appointed for the heiress, <b>and</b> Alora <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> it was her mother's wish that her father act as her guardian. So the conclusion is evident that Mr. Jones has a large income at his command." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then the Doctor {{came back}} to us <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> aphasia was like all the arrears of [...] "Punjab Head" [...] falling in a lump; and that only once before--in {{the case of a}} sepoy--had he met with so {{complete}} a case. I myself have seen mild aphasia in an overworked man, but this sudden dumbness was uncanny--though, as the Blastoderm himself might have said, due to [...] "perfectly natural causes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{tried to}} see Zikali but could not. Then I went to inspan the horses {{with the idea of}} {{following}} you, only to find that they were gone. Indeed I have not seen them from that day to this. Next we thought of starting on foot, for we were quite desperate. But Nombe intervened <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> if we ventured out of the Black Kloof we should be killed. In short we were prisoners.|$|E
60|$|The room {{in which}} we sat was small and bare {{but to me it}} was very beautiful, because of the fire, and by reason of the merry voices which filled my ears with music. Aunt Rebecca brought to us a handful of {{crackers}} <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> we were to have oyster soup for supper. This gave us great pleasure even in anticipation, for oysters were a delicious treat in those days.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know you}} did, my boy; {{but you did}} so much futile arithmetic, <b>and</b> so often <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> a+b-c equalled Peter the Great, that Dr. Worth said you must not be put to {{mathematics}} for months to come, <b>and</b> I have <b>told</b> your father that if he cannot send you to Oxford, we will manage it." ...|$|R
60|$|So much I knew; {{the rest}} I {{was left to}} suppose. The Doctor <b>and</b> Marcella <b>told</b> me much, {{but there were some}} things too sacred to be told, even to me. So that to this day I don't know how the doctor found out that Marcella loved him. All I know is that one day, just a month before her sixteenth birthday, the two came hand in hand to Miss Sara and me, as we sat on Miss Sara's veranda in the twilight, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> simply <b>that</b> they had plighted their troth to each other.|$|R
40|$|Breathing through nose is {{a healthy}} habit {{approved}} by researchers {{and it is also}} helpful in cure of flu. Because normal nose breathing help us to use nitric oxide generated in our sinuses. <b>And</b> research <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> nitric oxide has confirmed function of destruction of viruses, parasitic organisms, and malignant cells in the airways and lungs by inactivating their respiratory chain enzymes. NO inhibits the replication of influenza viruses, probably during the early steps of the viruses’ replication cycle, involving the synthesis of vRNA and mRNA encoding viral proteins. Thus NO is responsible for the cure of flu by killing influenza virus...|$|R
