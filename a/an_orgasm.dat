5|$|Many {{academics}} {{have discussed}} {{use of the}} Magic Wand to treat chronic anorgasmiaa type of sexual dysfunction {{in which a person}} cannot achieve orgasmand other sexual problems including female sexual arousal disorder. A study published in 1979 in the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology analyzed the training of women in self-masturbation techniques in a sample of individuals who previously had difficulty experiencing orgasm. The researchers gave women the Magic Wand to help excite the clitoris and increase the likelihood they would experience <b>an</b> <b>orgasm.</b> They found self-administered treatment using the Magic Wand to be the most efficient option to address prior problems achieving orgasm.|$|E
5|$|Sex {{therapist}} Ruth Westheimer {{said the}} device was most favored by those selecting from vibrators of the corded electrical variety. Therapist and sex educator Laura Berman recommended the device in many articles for the Chicago Sun-Times, both for women who had never experienced <b>an</b> <b>orgasm</b> {{and those who had}} difficulty becoming aroused. Sexologist Gloria Brame wrote in her book The Truth about Sex, a Sex Primer for the 21st Century that the Magic Wand was one of the more successful masturbation aids marketed, and stated it was popular due to its non-penetrative nature. Australian clinical psychologist and sex therapist Bettina Arndt reported that a couple she corresponded with had success using the Magic Wand while simultaneously engaging in sexual intercourse. Physician and sex columnist Hilda Hutcherson recommended the Magic Wand in her book Pleasure, and suggested women could place a soft cloth over their vulva if they felt it was needed to decrease delivered intensity from the device. Cosmopolitan magazine reported that the Magic Wand was the vibrator most often suggested by sex therapists.|$|E
40|$|The way women {{experience}} orgasm {{is of interest}} to scientists, clinicians, and laypeople. Whereas the origin and the function of <b>a</b> woman's <b>orgasm</b> remains controversial, the current models of sexual function acknowledge a combined role of central (spinal and cerebral) and peripheral processes during orgasm experience. At the central level, although it is accepted that the spinal cord drives orgasm, the cerebral involvement and cognitive representation of <b>a</b> woman's <b>orgasm</b> has not been extensively investigated. Important gaps in our knowledge remain. Recently, the astonishing advances of neuroimaging techniques applied in parallel with a neuropsychological approach allowed the unravelling of specific functional neuroanatomy of <b>a</b> woman's <b>orgasm.</b> Here, clinical and experimental findings on the cortico-subcortical pathway of <b>a</b> woman's <b>orgasm</b> are reviewed and compared with the neural basis of <b>a</b> man's <b>orgasm.</b> By defining the specific brain areas that sustain the assumed higher-order representation of <b>a</b> woman's <b>orgasm,</b> this review provides a foundation for future studies. The next challenge of functional imaging and neuropsychological studies is to understand the hierarchical interactions between these multiple cortical areas, not only with a correlation analysis but also with high spatio-temporal resolution techniques demonstrating the causal necessity, the temporal time course and {{the direction of the}} causality. Further studies using a multi-disciplinary approach are needed to identify the spatio-temporal dynamic of <b>a</b> woman's <b>orgasm,</b> its dysfunctions and possible new treatments...|$|R
2500|$|An {{empirical}} study {{carried out}} in 2008 provides evidence for Freud's implied link between inability to have <b>a</b> vaginal <b>orgasm</b> and psychosexual immaturity. In the study, women reported their past month frequency of different sexual behaviors and corresponding orgasm rates and completed the Defense Style Questionnaire (DSQ-40), which is associated with various psychopathologies. The study concluded that <b>a</b> [...] "vaginal <b>orgasm</b> was associated with less somatization, dissociation, displacement, autistic fantasy, devaluation, and isolation of affect." [...] Moreover, [...] "vaginally anorgasmic women had immature defenses scores {{comparable to those of}} established (depression, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and obsessive–compulsive disorder) outpatient psychiatric groups." [...] In the study, <b>a</b> vaginal <b>orgasm</b> (as opposed to <b>a</b> clitoral <b>orgasm)</b> was defined as being triggered solely by penile–vaginal intercourse. According to Wilhelm Reich, the lack of women's capacity to have <b>a</b> vaginal <b>orgasm</b> is {{due to a lack of}} orgastic potency, which he believed to be the result of culture's suppression of genital sexuality.|$|R

5|$|The {{clitoral}} glans doubles {{in diameter}} upon arousal, and, upon further stimulation, it becomes less visible {{as it is}} covered by the swelling of tissues of the clitoral hood. The swelling protects the glans from direct contact, as direct contact at this stage can be more irritating than pleasurable. Vasocongestion eventually triggers a muscular reflex, which expels the blood that was trapped in surrounding tissues, and leads to <b>an</b> <b>orgasm.</b> A short time after stimulation has stopped, especially if orgasm has been achieved, the glans becomes visible again and returns to its normal state, with a few seconds (usually 5–10) to return to its normal position and 5–10 minutes to return to its original size. If orgasm is not achieved, the clitoris may remain engorged for a few hours, which women often find uncomfortable. Additionally, the clitoris is very sensitive after orgasm, making further stimulation initially painful for some women. Masters and Johnson documented the sexual response cycle, which has four phases and is still the clinically accepted definition of the human orgasm.|$|E
25|$|People who are orgasmic in some {{situations}} {{may not be in}} others. A person may have <b>an</b> <b>orgasm</b> from one type of stimulation but not from another, achieve orgasm with one partner but not another, or have <b>an</b> <b>orgasm</b> only under certain conditions or only with a certain type or amount of foreplay. These common variations are within the range of normal sexual expression and should not be considered problematic.|$|E
25|$|The {{observation}} that {{women tend to}} reach orgasm more easily when they are ovulating also {{suggests that it is}} tied to increasing fertility. Evolutionary biologist Robin Baker argues in Sperm Wars that occurrence and timing of orgasms are all a part of the female body's unconscious strategy to collect and retain sperm from more evolutionarily fit men. <b>An</b> <b>orgasm</b> during intercourse functions as a bypass button to a woman's natural cervical filter against sperm and pathogens. <b>An</b> <b>orgasm</b> before functions to strengthen the filter.|$|E

25|$|Women's orgasms are {{preceded by}} {{erection}} of the clitoris and moistening {{of the opening}} of the vagina. Some women exhibit a sex flush, a reddening of the skin over much of the body due to increased blood flow to the skin. As <b>a</b> woman nears <b>orgasm,</b> the clitoral glans retracts under the clitoral hood, and the labia minora (inner lips) become darker. <b>As</b> <b>orgasm</b> becomes imminent, the outer third of the vagina tightens and narrows, while overall the vagina lengthens and dilates and also becomes congested from engorged soft tissue.|$|R
25|$|Secondary anorgasmia is {{the loss}} of the ability to have orgasms (as opposed to primary anorgasmia which {{indicates}} a person who has never had <b>an</b> <b>orgasm).</b> Or loss of the ability to reach orgasm of past intensity. The cause may be alcoholism, depression, grief, pelvic surgery (such as total hysterectomy) or injuries, certain medications, illness, estrogen deprivation associated with menopause, or rape.|$|E

25|$|Orgasm {{disorders}} are persistent delays {{or absence of}} orgasm following a normal sexual excitement phase in at least 75 percent of sexual encounters. The disorder can have physical, psychological, or pharmacological origins. SSRI antidepressants are a common pharmaceutical culprit, as they can delay orgasm or eliminate it entirely. A common physiological culprit of anorgasmia is menopause, where one in three women report problems obtaining <b>an</b> <b>orgasm</b> during sexual stimulation following menopause.|$|E
50|$|Planning a debut album, to be titled <b>A</b> Little <b>Orgasm</b> of Disappointment, {{the band}} began recording, again with Gav Thomson, at Berkeley 2, Glasgow, in September 2005.

The 2009 release of <b>A</b> Little <b>Orgasm</b> of Disappointment is a compilation of The Littlest Orgasm and It Stings When I EP, {{and not to be}} mistaken for the abandoned full-length.|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> forced <b>orgasm</b> is <b>a</b> form of <b>orgasm</b> control {{where the}} active partner sexually stimulates a {{submissive}} partner {{to the point}} of the submissive's involuntary orgasm, with the submissive attempting to restrain the onset of orgasm. [...] In BDSM or other sexual roleplay, the submissive partner can be put in physical restraints, to enable the active partner to control the rate and duration of stimulation.|$|R
5000|$|The {{previously}} accepted {{notion that}} all fluid expelled during <b>a</b> woman's <b>orgasm</b> is urine {{is now being}} challenged...sexologists must {{take care not to}} assume now that any fluid produced at orgasm is [...] "female ejaculate".|$|R
25|$|The {{inability}} to have orgasm, or regular difficulty reaching orgasm after ample sexual stimulation, is called anorgasmia or inorgasmia. If a male experiences erection and ejaculation but no orgasm, {{he is said}} to have sexual anhedonia (a condition in which an individual cannot feel pleasure from <b>an</b> <b>orgasm)</b> or ejaculatory anhedonia. Anorgasmia is significantly more common in women than in men, which has been attributed to the lack of sex education with regard to women's bodies, especially in sex-negative cultures, such as clitoral stimulation usually being key for women to orgasm.|$|E
25|$|Female {{masturbation}} alters {{conditions in}} the vagina, cervix and uterus, in ways that can alter the chances of conception from intercourse, depending on {{the timing of the}} masturbation. A woman's orgasm between one minute before and 45 minutes after insemination favors the chances of that sperm reaching her egg. If, for example, she has had intercourse with more than one male, such <b>an</b> <b>orgasm</b> can increase the likelihood of a pregnancy by one of them. Female masturbation can also provide protection against cervical infections by increasing the acidity of the cervical mucus and by moving debris out of the cervix.|$|E
25|$|Primary anorgasmia is a {{condition}} where one has never experienced <b>an</b> <b>orgasm.</b> This is significantly more common in women, although it can occur in men who lack the gladipudendal (bulbocavernosus) reflex. Women with this condition can sometimes achieve a relatively low level of sexual excitement. Frustration, restlessness, and pelvic pain or a heavy pelvic sensation may occur because of vascular engorgement. On occasion, {{there may be no}} obvious reason why orgasm is unobtainable. In such cases, women report that they are unable to orgasm even if they have a caring, skilled partner, adequate time and privacy, and an absence of medical issues which would affect sexual satisfaction.|$|E

25|$|In 2014, Betty Dodson, {{who is also}} {{acknowledged}} {{as one of the}} leaders of the early 1980s pro-sex feminist movement, expressed that she considers herself a fourth wave feminist. Dodson expressed that the previous waves of feminist were banal and anti-sexual, which is why she has chosen to look at a new stance of feminism, fourth wave feminism. In 2014, Dodson worked with women to discover their sexual desires through masturbation. Dodson says her work has gained a fresh lease of life with a new audience of young, successful women who have never had <b>an</b> <b>orgasm.</b> This includes fourth-wave feminists - those rejecting the anti-pleasure stance they believe third-wave feminists stand for.|$|E
25|$|A woman's orgasm {{may last}} {{slightly}} longer or {{much longer than}} a man's. Women's orgasms have been estimated to last, on average, approximately 20 seconds, and to consist {{of a series of}} muscular contractions in the pelvic area that includes the vagina, the uterus, and the anus. For some women, on some occasions, these contractions begin soon after the woman reports that the orgasm has started and continue at intervals of about one second with initially increasing, and then reducing, intensity. In some instances, the series of regular contractions is followed by a few additional contractions or shudders at irregular intervals. In other cases, the woman reports having <b>an</b> <b>orgasm,</b> but no pelvic contractions are measured at all.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 25% {{of women}} report {{difficulties}} with orgasm, 10% {{of women have}} never had <b>an</b> <b>orgasm,</b> and 40% or 40–50% have either complained about sexual dissatisfaction or experienced difficulty becoming sexually aroused {{at some point in}} their lives. A 1994 study by Laumann et al. found that 75% of men and 29% of women always have orgasms with their partner. Women are much more likely to be nearly always or always orgasmic when alone than with a partner. However, in a 1996 study by Davis et al., 62% of women in a partnered relationship said they were satisfied with the frequency/consistency of their orgasms. Additionally, some women express that their most satisfying sexual experiences entail being connected to someone, rather than solely basing satisfaction on orgasm.|$|E
50|$|In human sexuality, the {{refractory}} period {{is usually the}} recovery phase after orgasm during which it is physiologically impossible {{for a man to}} have additional orgasms due to increase in the penile sensory threshold (PST). Though it is generally reported that women do not experience a {{refractory period}} and can thus experience <b>an</b> additional <b>orgasm</b> (or multiple orgasms) soon after the first, some sources state that both men and women experience a refractory period because women may also experience <b>a</b> moment after <b>orgasm</b> in which further sexual stimulation does not produce excitement.|$|R
50|$|Women {{are able}} to achieve {{multiple}} orgasms {{due to the fact}} that they generally do not require a refractory period like men do after the first orgasm; though generally reported that women do not experience a refractory period and thus can experience <b>an</b> additional <b>orgasm,</b> or multiple orgasms, soon after the first orgasm, some sources state that both men and women experience a refractory period because, due to clitoral hypersensitivity or sexual satisfaction, women may also experience <b>a</b> period after <b>orgasm</b> in which further sexual stimulation does not produce excitement.|$|R

25|$|An area in {{the vagina}} that may be an erogenous zone is the G-spot (also known as the Gräfenberg spot); it is {{typically}} defined as being located at the anterior wall of the vagina, a couple or few inches in from the entrance, and some women experience intense pleasure, and sometimes <b>an</b> <b>orgasm,</b> if this area is stimulated during sexual activity. A G-spot orgasm {{may be responsible for}} female ejaculation, leading some doctors and researchers to believe that G-spot pleasure comes from the Skene's glands, a female homologue of the prostate, rather than any particular spot on the vaginal wall; other researchers consider the connection between the Skene's glands and the G-spot area to be weak. The G-spot's existence, and existence as a distinct structure, is still under dispute, as its reported location can vary from woman to woman, appears to be nonexistent in some women, and it is hypothesized to be an extension of the clitoris and therefore the reason for orgasms experienced vaginally.|$|E

The portrayal of a double rape caused significant problems with the MPAA {{and had to be}} trimmed to avoid the NC-17 rating. Both the Australian and European version are more explicit, particularly the first rape. Peirce was angry because the MPAA wanted the sex scene between Brandon and Lana removed but was satisfied with the level of brutality in the murder scene.

5|$|Sex-positive feminist writer Susie Bright {{called the}} Magic Wand {{one of her}} two {{favorite}} vibrators, and called it a miracle that the device {{was able to bring}} about <b>a</b> <b>orgasm</b> in under sixty seconds.

Shaidle wrote that its effectiveness was not hampered by its appearance which brought to mind objects featured in the Mütter Museum.
