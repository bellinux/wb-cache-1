5|$|The Man-Eating Myth: Anthropology and <b>Anthropophagy</b> is an {{influential}} anthropological study of socially sanctioned cultural cannibalism across the world, which casts a critical {{perspective on the}} existence of such practices. It was authored by the American anthropologist William Arens of Stony Brook University, New York and first published by Oxford University Press in 1979.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of {{violence}} and cannibalism has been documented in the central Mesa Verde region. While most of the violence, which peaked between 1275 and 1285, is generally ascribed to in-fighting amongst Mesa Verdeans, archaeological evidence found at Sand Canyon Pueblo, in Canyons of the Ancients National Monument, suggests that violent interactions also occurred between Mesa Verdeans and people from outside the region. Evidence of the attacks was discovered {{by members of the}} Crow Canyon Archaeological Center during the 1990s. The assaults, which also occurred at the national monument's Castle Rock Pueblo, were dated to , and are considered to have effectively ended several centuries of Puebloan occupation at those sites. Many of the victims showed signs of skull fractures, and the uniformity of the injuries suggest that most were inflicted with a small stone axe. Others were scalped, dismembered, and cannibalized. The <b>anthropophagy</b> (cannibalism) might have been undertaken as a survival strategy during times of starvation. The archaeological record indicates that, rather than being isolated to the Mesa Verde region, violent conflict was widespread in North America during the late 13th and early 14th centuries, and was likely exacerbated by global climate changes that negatively affected food supplies throughout the continent.|$|E
500|$|In chapter one, [...] "The Nature of Anthropology and Anthropophagy", Arens {{discusses}} {{the study of}} <b>anthropophagy,</b> or cannibalism, within the anthropological discipline. Noting that anthropologists have widely taken {{it for granted that}} there are societies who socially sanction cannibalism, he nevertheless states that there is no [...] "adequate documentation" [...] for such practices anywhere in the world. In {{the second part of the}} chapter, he explores several first-hand accounts of cannibalism and highlights their implausible and inaccurate nature. Beginning with the German Hans Staden's claims to have encountered socially sanctioned cannibalism among the Tupinambá people of South America in the 1550s, Arens illustrates a number of logical contradictions in Staden's account, and highlights the dubious nature of the text. The anthropologist then moved on to the 19th-century accounts of widespread socially approved cannibalism among the Polynesian people of Rarotonga in the Cook Islands provided by Ta'unga, a Polynesian native who had been converted to Christianity and wrote for the London Missionary Society; Arens again highlights a number of inconsistencies and logical impossibilities in Ta'unga's claims.|$|E
500|$|The English {{archaeologist}} Timothy Taylor critically discussed Arens' work in {{his book}} The Buried Soul: How Humans Invented Death (2002). Proclaiming that [...] "there is now overwhelming biological, anthropological and archaeological evidence that cannibalism was once all around us", he attacked Arens for his blanket and [...] "bizarre" [...] accusations against the concept of cultural <b>anthropophagy.</b> He argued that The Man-Eating Myth had become so influential upon publication because it was what a generation of anthropological and archaeological students wanted to hear, not because it represented a coherent argument, citing P.G. Rivière's negative review in Man. Commenting {{on the situation in}} archaeology, he felt that following the publication of Arens' work, archaeologists had ceased to cite cannibalism as an explanation, {{to the detriment of the}} discipline itself. Presenting evidence to counter Arens' claims, Taylor cites the accounts of cannibalism among Pom and Passon, two chimpanzees of Gombe National Park whose anti-social activities were recorded by Jane Goodall, and from this discusses the evolutionary benefits of cannibalism. Proceeding to defend various ethnographic accounts of cultural cannibalism, he argues that this thoroughly disproves the beliefs which [...] "Arensite" [...] anthropologists find it [...] "comfortable or fashionable" [...] to believe. Later in The Buried Soul, he proclaims that Arens' book is pervaded by a [...] "hollow certainty of viscerally insulated inexperience", and he claims that such a flawed methodology has echoes in the anthropologist Jean La Fontaine's [...] (1998); Taylor himself suggests that multiple claims of the Satanic ritual abuse have been incorrectly dismissed for being considered [...] "improbable".|$|E
500|$|The journal Man {{published}} a highly negative review by P. G. Rivière of the University of Oxford. Criticizing {{what he saw}} as the [...] "chatty 'Holier-than-Thou' tone" [...] of the book, Rivière asserted that at only 160 pages of text, Arens had failed to give sufficient attention to the subject and evidence, instead devoting much of the space to constructing and demolishing straw men arguments. Coming to the defence of those who believe the account of Staden regarding cannibalism among the Tupinambá by arguing that it could indeed reflect the German explorer's genuine experiences, Rivière notes that Arens has not tackled all of the claims which assert that this South American people committed <b>anthropophagy.</b> Furthermore, he expresses his opinion that Arens' work has made him reassess the evidence for Tupinambá cannibalism, the existence of which he is now even more thoroughly convinced. Proclaiming it to be both a [...] "bad" [...] and a [...] "dangerous" [...] book, he finally expresses his fear that it might prove to be [...] "the origin of a myth". Similarly, Shirley Lindenbaum of the New School for Social Research published her highly negative review of Arens' work in the journal Ethnohistory. Casting a critical eye on his claims, she notes that his use of source material was [...] "selective and strangely blinkered", which detracted from his ideas of [...] "collective prejudice" [...] which she considers valuable. Critiquing his discussion of the Fore people of New Guinea as being littered with inaccuracies, she draws comparisons between cannibalism and sexual activity, noting the latter is also not directly observed by anthropologists but nonetheless undoubtedly goes on. She furthermore expresses surprise that the work was ever designed for a scholarly audience because of its poor levels of accuracy.|$|E
2500|$|Cannibalism {{derives from}} Caníbales, the Spanish {{name for the}} Caribs, a West Indies tribe that {{formerly}} practiced cannibalism, from Spanish canibal or caribal, [...] "a savage". It is also called <b>anthropophagy.</b>|$|E
60|$|I made careful inquiry about <b>anthropophagy</b> {{amongst the}} Fán, and my account must differ greatly {{from that of}} M. du Chaillu. The reader, however, will {{remember}} that Mayyán is held by a comparatively civilized race, who have probably learned to conceal a custom so distasteful to all their neighbours, white and black; in the remoter districts cannibalism may yet assume far more hideous proportions. Since the Fán have encouraged traders to settle amongst them, the interest {{as well as the}} terrors of the Coast tribes, who would deter foreigners from direct dealings, has added new horrors to the tale; and yet nothing can exceed the reports of older travellers.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Anthropophagy</b> without {{apparent}} {{cause was}} not unknown in Southern Africa. Mr. Layland found a tribe of [...] "cave cannibals" [...] amongst the mountains beyond Thaba Bosigo in the Trans-Gariep Country.[FN#21] He remarks with some surprise, [...] "Horrible as all this may appear, {{there might be}} some excuse made for savages, driven by famine to extreme hunger, for capturing and devouring their enemies. But with these people it was totally different, for they were inhabiting a fine agricultural tract of country, which also abounded in game. Notwithstanding this, they were not contented with hunting and feeding upon their enemies, but preyed much upon each other also, for many of their captures were made from amongst the people of their own tribe, and, even worse than this, in times of scarcity, many of their own wives and children became the victims of this horrible practice." ...|$|E
6000|$|During my peregrinations I {{did not see}} {{a single}} skull. The chiefs, {{stretched}} at full length, and wrapped in mats, are buried secretly, the object being to prevent some strong Fetish medicine being made by enemies from {{various parts of the}} body. In some villages the head men of the same tribe are interred near one another; the commonalty are put singly and decently under ground, and only the slave (Máká) is thrown as usual into the bush. Mr. Tippet, who had lived three years with this people, knew only three cases of cannibalism; and the Rev. Mr. Walker agreed with other excellent authorities, that it is a rare incident even in the wildest parts--perhaps opportunity only is wanted. As will appear from the Fán's bill of fare, <b>anthropophagy</b> can hardly be caused by necessity, {{and the way in which}} it is conducted shows that it is a quasi-religious rite practised upon foes slain in battle, evidently an equivalent of human sacrifice. If the whole body cannot be carried off, a limb or two is removed for the purpose of a roast. The corpse is carried to a hut built expressly on the outskirts of the settlement; it is eaten secretly by the warriors, women and children not being allowed to be present, or even to look upon man's flesh; and the cooking pots used for the banquet must all be broken. A joint of [...] "black brother" [...] is never seen in the villages: [...] "smoked human flesh" [...] does not hang from the rafters, and the leather knife-sheaths are of wild cow; tanned man's skin suggests only the tannerie de Meudon, an advanced [...] "institution." [...] Yet Dr. Schweinfurth's valuable travels on the Western Nile prove that public <b>anthropophagy</b> can co-exist with a considerable amount of comfort and, so to speak, civilization--witness the Nyam-Nyam and Mombattu (Mimbuttoo). The sick and the dead are uneaten by the Fán, and the people shouted with laughter when I asked a certain question.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Anthropophagy,</b> {{either as}} a necessity, a sentiment, or a superstition, is known to sundry, though by no means to all, the tribes {{dwelling}} between the Nun (Niger) and the Congo rivers; how much farther south it extends I cannot at present say. On the Lower Niger, and its branch the Brass River, the people hardly take the trouble to conceal it. On the Bonny and New Calabar, perhaps the most advanced of the so-called Oil Rivers, cannibalism, based upon a desire of revenge, and perhaps, its sentimental side, the object of imbibing the valour of an enemy slain in battle, has caused many scandals of late years. The practice, on the other hand, is execrated by the Efiks of Old Calabar, who punish any attempts of the kind with extreme severity. During 1862 the slaves of Creek-town attempted it, and were killed. At Duke-town an Ibo woman also cut up a man, sun- dried the flesh, and sold it for monkey's meat--she took sanctuary at the mission house. Yet it is in full vigour amongst their Ibo neighbours to the north-west, and the Duallas of the Camarones River also number it amongst their [...] "country customs." [...] The Mpongwe, as has been said, will not eat a chimpanzee; the Fán devour their dead enemies.|$|E
60|$|I use {{the word}} {{humanitarian}} in the ordinary sense, as meaning one who upholds the claims of all creatures against those of humanity. They suggest that through the ages we have been growing more and more humane, that is to say, that one after another, groups or sections of beings, slaves, children, women, cows, or what not, have been gradually admitted to mercy or to justice. They say that we once thought it right to eat men (we didn't); but I am not here concerned with their history, which is highly unhistorical. As a fact, <b>anthropophagy</b> is certainly a decadent thing, not a primitive one. It {{is much more likely}} that modern men will eat human flesh out of affectation than that primitive man ever ate it out of ignorance. I am here only following the outlines of their argument, which consists in maintaining that man has been progressively more lenient, first to citizens, then to slaves, then to animals, and then (presumably) to plants. I think it wrong to sit on a man. Soon, I shall think it wrong to sit on a horse. Eventually (I suppose) I shall think it wrong to sit on a chair. That is the drive of the argument. And for this argument {{it can be said that}} it is possible to talk of it in terms of evolution or inevitable progress. A perpetual tendency to touch fewer and fewer things might--one feels, be a mere brute unconscious tendency, like that of a species to produce fewer and fewer children. This drift may be really evolutionary, because it is stupid.|$|E
6000|$|At Banza Nokki I saw {{the first}} {{specimen}} of a Mundongo slave girl. The tribe is confounded with the Mandingo (Mandenga) Moslems {{by the author of}} the [...] "Introduction to Tuckey's Journey" [...] (p. Ixxxi.); by Tuckey (p. 141), who also calls them Mandonzo (p. 135), and by Prof. Smith (p. 315); but not by the accurate Marsden (p. 389). She described her tribe as living inland to the east and north- east of the Congo peoples, distant two moons--a detail, of course, not to be depended upon. I afterwards met many of these [...] "captives," [...] who declared that they had been sold after defeats: a fine, tall race, one is equal to two Congo men, and the boldness of demeanour in both sexes distinguishes them from other serviles. Apparently under this name there are several tribes inhabiting lands of various elevations; some are coloured café au lait, as if born in a high and healthy region; others are almost jet black with the hair frightfully [...] "wispy," [...] like a mop. Generally the head is bullet-shaped, the face round, the features negroid, not negro, and the hands and feet large but not ill- shaped. Some again have the Hausa mark, thread-like perpendicular cuts from the zygomatic arches running parallel with the chin; in other cases the stigmata are broad beauty-slashes drawn transversely across the cheeks to the jawbone, and forming with the vertical axis an angle of 45°. All are exceedingly fond of meat, and, like the Kru-men, will devour it semi-putrified. The Congoese declare them to be [...] "papagentes" [...] (cannibals), a term generally applied by the more advanced to the bushmen living beyond their frontier, and useful to deter travellers and runaways. They themselves declare that they eat the slain only after a battle--the sentimental form of <b>anthropophagy.</b> The slave- girl produced on this occasion was told to sing; after receiving some beads, without which she would not open her lips, we were treated to a [...] "criard" [...] performance which reminded me of the [...] "heavenly muse" [...] in the Lake Regions of Central Africa.|$|E
6000|$|The [...] "unnatural" [...] practice, which, by the by, has at {{different}} ages extended {{over the whole}} world, now continues to be most prevalent in places where, as in New Zealand, animal food is wanting; and everywhere pork readily {{takes the place of}} [...] "long pig." [...] The damp and depressing atmosphere of equatorial Africa renders the stimulus of flesh diet necessary. The Isángú, or Ingwánba, the craving felt after a short abstinence from animal food, does not spare the white traveller more than it does his dark guides; and, though the moral courage of the former may resist the [...] "gastronomic practice" [...] of breaking fast upon a fat young slave, one does not expect so much from the untutored appetite of the noble savage. On the eastern parts of the continent there are two cannibal tribes, the Wadoe and the Wabembe; and it is curious to find the former occupying the position assigned by Ptolemy (iv. 8) to his anthropophagi of the Barbaricus Sinus: according to their own account, however, the practice is modern. When weakened by the attacks of their Wákámbá neighbours, they began to roast and eat slices from the bodies of the slain in presence of the foe. The latter, as often happens amongst barbarians, and even amongst civilized men, could dare to die, but were unable to face the horrors of becoming food after death: the great Cortez knew this feeling when he made his soldiers pretend <b>anthropophagy.</b> Many of the Wadoe negroids are tall, well made, and light complexioned, though inhabiting the low and humid coast regions-- a proof, if any were wanted, that there is nothing unwholesome in man's flesh. Some of our old accounts of shipwrecked seamen, driven to the dire necessity of eating one another, insinuate that the impious food causes raging insanity. The Wabembe tribe, occupying a strip of land on the western shore of the Tanganyika Lake, are [...] "Menschenfresser," [...] as they were rightly called by the authors of the [...] "Mombas Mission Map." [...] These miserables have abandoned to wild growth a most prolific soil; too lazy and unenergetic to hunt or to fish, they devour all manner of carrion, grubs, insects, and even the corpses of their deceased friends. The Midgán, or slave-caste of the semi-Semitic Somal, are sometimes reduced to the same extremity; but they are ever held, like the Wendigo, or man-eaters, amongst the North American Indians, impure and detestable. On the other hand, the Tupi- Guaranís of the Brazil, a country abounding in game, fish, wild fruits, and vegetables, ate one another with a surprising relish. This subject is too extensive even to be outlined here: the reader is referred to the translation of Hans Stade: old travellers attribute the cannibalism of the Brazilian races to [...] "gulosity" [...] rather than superstition; moreover, these barbarians had certain abominable practices, supposed to be known only to the most advanced races.|$|E

5000|$|A Căpcăun is a {{creature}} in Romanian folklore, depicted as an ogre who kidnaps children or young ladies (mostly princesses). It represents evil, as do its counterparts Zmeu and the Balaur.

According to Romanian folkloric phantasy, the căpcăun has a dog head, sometimes with four eyes, with eyes in the nape, or with four legs, but whose main characteristic is <b>anthropophagy.</b>|$|E
50|$|It {{describes}} {{the adventures of}} ten young men, the Kumaras, {{all of whom are}} either princes or sons of royal ministers, as narrated by the men themselves (however, there are irregularities in the text). These narratives are replete with accounts of demigods, ghosts, prostitutes, gamblers, intrigues with voluptuous women, astonishing coincidences, cockfights, <b>anthropophagy,</b> sorcery, robberies, murders and wars. The reader is treated to some very striking passages; for instance, a seductive young girl (all of whose anatomical features are very frankly described) deftly prepares a fragrant meal of rice-gruel and vegetables for her prospective suitor in the sixth chapter of the Dashakumaracharita.|$|E
5000|$|Due to {{the fact}} that our {{understanding}} of Tupi cannibalism relies solely on primary source accounts of primarily European writers, the very existence of cannibalism has been disputed by some in academic circles. William Arens seeks to discredit Staden's and other writers' accounts of cannibalism in his book The Man-Eating Myth: Anthropology & <b>Anthropophagy,</b> where he claims that when concerning the Tupinambá, [...] "rather than dealing with an instance of serial documentation of cannibalism, we are more likely confronting only one source of dubious testimony which has been incorporated almost verbatim into the written reports of others claiming to be eyewitnesses".|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} lurid {{allegations}} against Bokassa was the charge of cannibalism. In the Central African Republic, statutes forbidding cannibalism classified any crime of eating human remains as a misdemeanour. Upon seizing power from David Dacko in 1981, the current President André Kolingba had declared amnesty for all misdemeanours committed during the tenure of his predecessors. Bokassa could not be charged or convicted with the crime, {{even if there was}} evidence of guilt. The cannibalism charges against him were brought from old indictments in 1980 that resulted in his conviction in absentia, a year before Kolingba's amnesty, so the <b>anthropophagy</b> charge remained listed among Bokassa's crimes.|$|E
50|$|Towards {{the end of}} the Second French Empire, Gagne {{became more}} lavished in public meetings, where he would make speeches on socialism, anti-monarchy, and other similar subjects. Often he would {{organize}} strange political demonstrations at which he was the only participator. Many of his antics brought on laughter, but he was always a perpetual candidate for parliament. Gagne consistently took the radical route. In 1868, during an Algerian Famine, when his cries for hippophagy were not reciprocated he asked for <b>anthropophagy.</b> He called for legislature that would prevent the famine by making the Algerians eat all elderly persons in France over the age of 60, including himself.|$|E
5000|$|Vulcano {{released}} a live recording Live! in 1985 to gain {{exposure to a}} greater audience outside of their home city of Santos. Live! was recorded in August {{in the city of}} Americana, without any mixing, and with a lineup of Zhema on bass, Soto Junior on guitar, Zé Flávio in guitar, drums and Lauder Piloni Angel on vocals. This served as preparation for Vulcano to record the first Brazilian black metal album Bloody Vengeance in 1986. In the years following the band released <b>Anthropophagy</b> (1987) and Who Are the True (1988). Throughout this period, Vulcano got access to increasingly better production as the metal scene in Brazil grew further. However, after releasing their fifth album Rat Race in 1990, Vulcano stopped releasing new albums for several years. In this period of reflection the Vulcano still did some live shows, but the only official release from the band was a Cogumelo Records compilation from 2000 with a re-release of the song [...] "Bloody Vengeance".|$|E
