5|$|In the Dunphy household, Alex (Ariel Winter) and Haley (Sarah Hyland) {{are furious}} at Manny (Rico Rodriguez) and Luke (Nolan Gould) for barging into their room {{while they were}} changing. This leads to their mother, Claire (Julie Bowen) to yell at them, while their dad, Phil (Ty Burrell) {{attempts}} to push himself away from Claire's anger behind her back. Annoyed, Claire confronts Phil about how he always makes her play the 'bad cop' role in their family and keeps the 'good cop' role for himself. He reluctantly agrees to switch roles with her. Claire takes Manny and Luke go-carting (although Phil had been quite keen to go), while Phil has to stay and make the girls clean their bathroom. The go-carting goes horribly as Claire, trying to be fun, crashes her cart into the boys, and makes them order large quantities of food. While driving home, Luke gets sick from drinking a milkshake he did not want. Meanwhile, Phil goes berserk when the girls lie to him about cleaning the bathroom and jump on their car {{to stop them from}} leaving, before forcing them to clean the bathroom under his direct supervision <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> them clean his bathroom. That evening, Phil and Claire admit that they cannot handle each other's natural parent roles, and agree to go back to normal.|$|E
25|$|The lessons {{lasted from}} nine {{o'clock in the}} morning to four o'clock in the {{afternoon}} <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> to return to the farm. There he remembered not having anybody to talk to, as his parents were busy and he had little in common with his brother.|$|E
25|$|On October 6, 1956, Woodcock {{was riding}} his bike around Cabbagetown {{when he picked}} up 9-year-old Gary Morris. He then drove the boy to Cherry Beach, where he strangled and beat him to death - with a coroner later {{determining}} that Morris had died from a ruptured liver. Morris' body was found with a bite mark on his throat and this time paper clips {{seemed to have been}} ritualistically sprinkled near the corpse. Again, the clothing had been removed from the victim <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been re-dressed.|$|E
60|$|Silas tried five squeaky ones, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>'ad</b> a fit o' {{coughing}} {{that would}} ha' woke the dead, as they say, but it didn't wake Bill.|$|R
50|$|Mike is an {{animated}} microphone. His function is spoken-language development. He shows videos that model real kids speaking English, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> the viewer practice {{a word or}} phrase.|$|R
6000|$|... "No;--he is {{not married}} yet. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> also stopped the {{allowance}} {{he used to}} make you." [...] Harry nodded assent. [...] "Now, all {{this is a great}} shame." ...|$|R
25|$|On {{their final}} {{offensive}} {{possession of the}} second quarter, Tyrone Prothro made {{one of the most}} memorable receptions in Alabama history. On a fourth-and-twelve, Croyle threw a 42-yard pass that Prothro caught on the back of Golden Eagles cornerback Jasper Faulk. Prothro had to wrap his right arm around Faulk's neck and his left arm under Faulk's right armpit to catch the ball (which appeared on replays to be blocked from his view by Faulk), <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> to maintain possession of the ball until his knee touched down at the one-yard line. Referred to as simply The Catch, the play won the 2006 Best Play ESPY Award. The Crimson Tide then cut the lead on the following play to 21–17 just before the half after Croyle connected with Le'Ron McClain on a one-yard touchdown reception.|$|E
25|$|Ulster's {{geography}} {{presented a}} formidable challenge. There were three main routes by which an invading army could enter the province, {{and all three}} favoured the defenders. Brian first {{had to find a}} means of getting through or around these defensive 'choke points', <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> to subdue the fiercely independent regional Kings of Ulster. It took Brian ten years of campaigning to achieve his goal, which, considering that he could and did call on all of the military forces of the rest of Ireland, indicates how formidable the Kings of Ulster were. Once again, it was his coordinated use of forces on land and at sea that allowed him to triumph; while the rulers of Ulster could bring the advance of Brian's army to a halt, they could not prevent his fleet from attacking the shores of their kingdoms. Once Brian entered the province of Ulster, he systematically defeated each of the regional rulers who defied him, forcing them to recognise him as their overlord.|$|E
25|$|He was a {{tall and}} bulky person with a {{prominent}} stomach and invariably played with a clean shaven head without any hat or cap {{or any kind of}} head gear. He always wore very loose pants and after batting for a while or keeping wicket for sometime his shirt will be hanging out of the trousers and somebody must tuck it in, now <b>and</b> <b>then.</b> <b>He</b> <b>had</b> a rather ugly and uncouth stance at the wicket as he held his bat very low and bent his body forward so much that his head was practically in line with the top of the wickets. Those who watched him from the on side could only see his prominent hind portion of the body sticking up while the head, bat and the rest of Dilawar Hussain were hardly visible. However, he had a very sound defense and so {{it was very difficult to}} get him out. He was the most selfish batsman that I have ever seen.|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{was just}} getting so I hated him, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> to go do {{something}} I admire him for. I wish people would be good all over or bad all over." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is so hard; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> such will, such power. He will thrust it {{off from}} him and {{determine}} that it shall not oppress him. I know him so well." ...|$|R
50|$|Mahadev {{joined the}} {{industry}} in 1996 as a camera attendant to Prakash Mehra <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> worked as assistant to J. P. Dutta. Later, he moved over to television as a director.|$|R
25|$|Gavilan was {{managed by}} Yamil Chade, a boxing manager (based in Puerto Rico) who also {{directed}} {{the careers of}} Wilfredo Gómez, Wilfred Benítez, Carlos De León and Félix Trinidad among others. He started as a professional boxer {{on the evening of}} June 5, 1943, when he beat Antonio Diaz by a decision in four rounds in Havana. His first ten bouts were in Havana, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> one in Cienfuegos, but soon he returned to Havana for three more wins. After 14 bouts, he left Cuba for his first fight abroad, and he beat Julio César Jimenez by a decision in 10 rounds in his first of three consecutive fights in Mexico City. It was there that he suffered his first defeat, at the hands of Carlos Macalara by a decision. They had an immediate rematch, this time in Havana, and Gavilan avenged that loss, winning by decision too. Gavilan had a record of 25 wins, 2 losses and 1 draw already when he had his first fight on American soil. This happened on November 1, 1946, when he beat Johnny Ryan by a knockout in five rounds at New York City.|$|E
500|$|According to Furtado, in the studio, Timbaland {{had some}} beats that were [...] "already kind of halfway there; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> beats {{that he just}} had nucleuses of; and then other stuff we jammed together". While she was working with Timbaland and Danja in Miami, Pharrell Williams {{introduced}} Furtado to reggaeton, a musical genre that was unfamiliar to her. After he played a song for her, Furtado became inspired and wrote the lyrics to [...] "No Hay Igual" [...] "nearly on the spot". In an interview with MTV News, Furtado joked: [...] "Supposedly it was Pharrell's idea for me to work with Tim [...] Jimmy Iovine, the head of my record label , might beg to differ." ...|$|E
2500|$|He was {{recalled}} to the Australian one day {{team for}} the WSC finals series in 1988–89, as a third spinner. However he bowled poorly, going for 0-62 off 7 overs. [...] "I {{felt sorry for him}} in a lot of ways", said Alan Border, [...] "because I gave him a pretty tough task, bowling in that first 15 overs, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> to bowl towards the end when their guys were wacking out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor Lucius! yes; in his {{position}} it is necessary. His little bit of property is already his own; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> no one like Sir Peregrine {{to look out for}} him. Necessity makes him manly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh; {{the matter}} with him? Well, to say it out at once <b>then,</b> <b>he</b> do take a drop too much at times, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> the horrors--what is it they call it? delicious beam-ends, or {{something}} of that sort." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lil, you {{fortunate}} creature, you! Positively it's {{the best}} match {{that there has}} been about here this summer. He's rich, of an old, respectable family; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> good principles, you know, and all that," [...] said Belle.|$|R
2500|$|The parting was not amicable. Virgin {{had to wait}} half {{a season}} before he could make his County Championship debut in 1973 for Northamptonshire <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> limited success. But in 1974, he had a second season of high achievement: 1,936 runs {{at an average of}} almost 57 runs per innings meant that he was fifth in the {{national}} averages. Again, he was talked of as a potential England player; but again he was not selected.|$|E
60|$|That {{much and}} glaring eyes and {{compressed}} lips and emphasizing fingers <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> gone again.|$|E
60|$|He {{fumbled with}} the door latch, grumbling some inarticulate self-pity, as if he sought a handle, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> it open.|$|E
6000|$|He {{got some}} of ’is money from his landlady at eight o’clock, arter {{listening}} to ’er for ’arf an hour, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>’ad</b> {{to pick it up}} off of the floor, and say [...] "Thank you" [...] for it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{the fault}} is less your own, sir, than his. Bluewater is {{addicted}} to fits of absence of mind, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> {{no reason to}} complain that others do not understand him, for he does not always understand himself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did {{you ever}} see such an ass as that Biffin? I don't wonder that she has become sick of him; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> behaved so very badly to her. I really do pity her. She has {{told me all about}} it." ...|$|R
60|$|Carrie saw {{him for a}} moment, a tall, black figure {{silhouetted against}} the cold blue, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{vanished}} into the night.|$|E
60|$|There {{was much}} {{laughter}} over Tom's statement, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{to give a}} detailed account of the whole affair, which elicited many expressions of approval.|$|E
60|$|The Sergeant {{nodded at}} the guide, as much as to say, You see how the land lies; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{sufficient}} consideration for his daughter's feelings to change the subject.|$|E
6000|$|She {{had still}} allowed {{her hand to}} remain in his, but now she withdrew it, {{and asked him to}} sit down. [...] "Lucius is not here," [...] she said. [...] "He never remains at home after breakfast. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> much to settle as to our journey; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> his lawyers to see." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hugh doesn't {{talk about}} anything," [...] she complained. [...] "He goes about looking as though <b>he</b> <b>had</b> the cares {{of the world}} upon his shoulders, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> the--well, the cheek, I call it, to lecture me about Captain Granet. He does talk about Captain Granet in the most absurd manner, you know, mother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{what is the}} use {{of marrying}} if you do not marry a rich woman--and the heiresses of the present age will not marry. What can be more unnatural! It alone ought to produce a revolution. Why, Alfred is the only fellow who has made a coup; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> not got it down." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You wouldn't have {{to train}} them any," [...] began Toby; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{no time to}} say {{anything}} more, for Ben, who had been talking with the manager, called to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I see {{a way of}} {{clearing}} this matter up--if Mr. Poole attempts to act against Dave," [...] said Mr. Wadsworth. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a long talk with Professor Potts.|$|E
60|$|He {{broke the}} spell by {{stepping}} {{back into the}} lane. He made a gesture with his hands, {{as if he would}} have wrung them. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> fled down the lane--almost at a run.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{do not see}} that," [...] {{said the}} mother, keen to defend her {{daughter}} from what {{might seem to be}} an implied reproach. [...] "George Hotspur is a man who will make himself thought of wherever he goes. He is clever, and very amusing;--there is no denying that. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> the Hotspur look all over." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1993, {{he moved}} to Germany <b>and</b> since <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> played with Dynamo Dresden, Dresdner SC and OFC Neugersdorf.|$|R
60|$|Ancliffe brought your sweetheart, Allie Lee, to me--to {{hide her}} from Durade. He {{told me to}} find you <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> died. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> been stabbed in saving her from Durade's gang. And Hough, too, was killed.|$|R
