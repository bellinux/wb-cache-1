5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be used}} to help identify the mushroom. <b>A</b> <b>drop</b> of ammonium hydroxide solution turns the cap cuticle a greenish to bluish colour. Application of iron(II) sulphate solution causes the flesh to stain a dull bluish-green, while the pores turn golden brown with <b>a</b> <b>drop</b> of dilute potassium hydroxide.|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be used}} to help verify an identification of L.rugosiceps. <b>A</b> <b>drop</b> of ammonium hydroxide solution turns the cap cuticle a reddish color or is unreactive, and yellow or unreactive on the flesh. <b>A</b> <b>drop</b> of dilute potassium hydroxide (KOH) turns the cap surface red, and the flesh yellowish to orangish.

5|$|Various {{parts of}} the {{mushroom}} display characteristic color reactions to chemical tests commonly used in mushroom identification. The cap cuticle will turn a blackish color with the application of <b>a</b> <b>drop</b> of potassium hydroxide (KOH), iron sulfate (FeSO4) solution, or ammonia solution. The mushroom flesh turns grayish-green to greenish black with <b>a</b> <b>drop</b> of FeSO4, and olive to greenish black with KOH or NH4OH.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>drop</b> of dilute ammonia (as a 12% NH4OH solution) {{placed on}} the cap surface {{immediately}} turns dark red. If {{placed on the}} bulbous part of the stem base of a dried specimen, it will turn dark for roughly 15 seconds before starting to fade.|$|E

Furthermore, despite <b>a</b> <b>drop</b> in 2001, investment in the sector has increased since 1999.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{tests are}} {{sometimes}} used to rapidly distinguish between closely related or morphologically similar species of mushrooms, or, in some cases, as characters to group species into subsections of a genus. Pigments {{present in the}} fungal hyphae are dissolved or react differently with various chemicals, and the color reactions {{may be used as}} taxonomic characters. When <b>a</b> <b>drop</b> of 10% aqueous solution of ammonium hydroxide is applied to the cap of B.mirabilis, the tissue turns a fleeting pink color that fades away. If <b>a</b> <b>drop</b> of commercial bleach (calcium hypochlorite) is applied, the tissue loses its color and becomes a pale blue.|$|E
