5|$|United States v. More, , was a United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court held that it had no {{jurisdiction}} to hear appeals from criminal cases in the circuit courts by writs of error. Relying on the Exceptions Clause, More held that Congress's enumerated grants of appellate jurisdiction to the Court operated <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>exercise</b> of Congress's power to eliminate all other forms of appellate jurisdiction.|$|E

5|$|Being Cristian Nemescu's last {{completed}} project, {{the film}} stars Mădălina Ghiţescu as Marilena and Gabriel Huian as Andrei. Originally, {{the film was}} intended to be used <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>exercise,</b> and was not supposed to be longer than seven minutes. In the end, the project evolved to an unusual length of 45minutes; the film's approach also turned from comedy to teenage love. Reception from the public was favorable – it impressed through its unitary view and the way the screenplay, picture and sound combine together into a new and organic way, by using innovative, unusual techniques.|$|E
5|$|Jumping {{technique}} {{has played a}} significant part {{in the history of}} the event. High jumpers typically cleared the bar feet first in the late 19th century, using either the Scissors, Eastern cut-off or Western roll technique. The straddle technique became prominent in the mid-20th century, but Dick Fosbury overturned tradition by pioneering a backwards and head-first technique in the late 1960s – the Fosbury Flop – which won him the gold at the 1968 Olympics. This {{technique has}} become the overwhelming standard for the sport from the 1980s onwards. The standing high jump was contested at the Olympics from 1900 to 1912, but is now relatively uncommon outside of its use <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>exercise</b> drill.|$|E
5|$|Like {{her sister}} Preussen, Lothringen missed the Battle of Jutland on 31 May– 1 June 1916, though for {{different}} reasons. Preussen had been temporarily transferred to guard duties in the Baltic, while Lothringen {{was in such}} poor condition that Vice Admiral Reinhard Scheer, the fleet commander, removed her from the squadron. Jutland proved to Scheer that the pre-dreadnought battleships were too vulnerable {{to take part in}} a major fleet action, and so detached the II Squadron from the High Seas Fleet. Lothringen became a guard ship in the Baltic after she left the battle fleet. The following year she was transferred to Wilhelmshaven, where she was used <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>exercise</b> ship, as well as to train engineers. She served in this capacity until the end of the war in 1918.|$|E

5|$|Section 22 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 {{authorized}} writs {{of error}} from the circuit courts only in civil cases. The District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801which created the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia and granted it jurisdiction over crimes committed within the federal districtdid not explicitly limit writs of error from the D.C. circuit court to civil cases, except {{insofar as it}} required an amount in controversy. Although the Court reached the merits of a criminal writ of error from the D.C. circuit court in United States v. Simms (1803), without any discussion of the jurisdictional issue, in United States v. More (1805), the Court held {{that it had no}} such jurisdiction. More held that Congress's piecemeal statutory grants of appellate jurisdiction to the Court operated <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>exercise</b> of Congress's power under the Exceptions Clause, eliminating all jurisdiction not explicitly granted.|$|E
5|$|U.S. diplomats were {{concerned}} that the move {{would be seen as}} a power grab, as Diệm was organising and driving an electoral process in which he was a candidate. The Americans felt that a legislature should be formed first and that the body should oversee the referendum, but Diệm ignored their advice. Ambassador G. Frederick Reinhardt informed Washington that Diệm had no intention of allowing a level playing field for the opposition, and that the foreign press had already made much of Diệm's democratic pronouncements being a facade. The Department of State agreed and opted to avoid trumpeting the referendum <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>exercise</b> in democracy for fear of attracting negative reactions to their foreign policy. Nevertheless, U.S. officials in Vietnam were pleased with the referendum, as they saw it as an opportunity to strengthen South Vietnam and avoid defeat to the communists, as they saw a republican model as being more robust.|$|E
5|$|In late 1833 Etty was {{commissioned}} by Williams-Wynn to paint a portrait of two of his seven children. Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball depicts Williams-Wynn's daughters Charlotte and Mary, dressing up in lavish Italian-style costume. Although their dress is generally described as Italian, Dennis Farr's 1958 biography of Etty speculates that elements of the costumes were possibly intended to be Russian, based on Charlotte's headdress. The Italian-style clothing likely represents {{the high level of}} interest in Italian culture in early 19th-century England. The popularity of the style of music now known as bel canto, widely associated with Italy, was at its peak; likewise, the Italian plays of William Shakespeare had become extremely popular in the period. Etty, who had {{spent a good deal of}} time in Venice and other Italian cities, would have been very familiar with Italian clothing designs, and the costumes worn by the Williams-Wynn sisters closely resemble those of women in Venetian scenes painted by Etty, such as 1831's Window in Venice, During a Fiesta. As art historian Leonard Robinson points out, despite the title the sisters are not in fact shown preparing for the ball, but are fully dressed. The style of the work reflects that of Thomas Lawrence, who had been Etty's teacher in 1807–08, as well as that of Joshua Reynolds, of whom Etty was a great admirer and of whose works Etty had often made copies <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>exercise.</b>|$|E
