40|$|ABSTRACT: Since {{high levels}} of nitric oxide (NO) are implicated in {{neurodegenerative}} disorders, inhibition of the neuronal isoform of nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and reduction of NO levels are therapeutically desirable. None-theless, many nNOS inhibitors mimic L-arginine and are poorly bioavailable. 2 -Aminoquinoline-based scaffolds were designed {{with the hope that}} they could (a) mimic amino-pyridines as potent, isoform-selective arginine isosteres and (b) possess chemical properties more conducive to oral bioavailability and CNS penetration. A series of these compounds was synthesized and assayed against purified nNOS enzymes, endothelial NOS (eNOS), and inducible NOS (iNOS). Several compounds built on a 7 -substituted 2 -aminoquinoline core are potent and isoform-selective; X-ray crystallography indicates that aminoquinolines exert inhibitory effects by mimicking substrate interactions with the conserved active site glutamate residue. The most potent and selective compounds, 7 and 15, were tested in a Caco- 2 assay <b>and</b> <b>showe...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We give {{an answer}} to the {{question}} as to whether quantifier elimination is possible in some infinite algebraic extensions of Qp (‘infinite p-adic fields’) using a natural language extension. The present paper deals with those infinite p-adic fields which admit only tamely ramified algebraic extensions (so-called tame fields). In the case of tame fields whose residue fields satisfy Kaplansky’s condition of having no extension of p-divisible degree quantifier elimination is possible when the language of valued fields is extended by the power predicates Pn introduced by Macintyre and, for the residue field, further predicates and constants. For tame infinite p-adic fields with algebraically closed residue fields an extension by Pn predicates is sufficient. § 1. Introduction. When the model theory of p-adic fields started around 1965, the analogy of Qp with the real numbers played an important role. 1 Indeed, James Ax and Simon Kochen [1], as well as independently Yuri Ershov [3] established the decidability of the theory of p-adic numbers.

However, it is still rarely reported in pae-diatric IBD. We studied the diagnostic value of gadolinium enhanced MRI in revealing inflammation of the distal ileum in children with Crohn’s disease (CD) and in differentiating them from patients with other inflammatory diseases of the gut. MRI was performed using a polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution as oral contrast agent to distend the small bowel (CE-PEG-MRI). Subjects and methods: Seventy five consecutive patients (median age 13. 6 years, range 8 – 17) with suspected CD underwent ileocolonoscopy with biopsy and CE-PEG-MRI. CD activity {{was measured by the}} paediatric Crohn’s disease activity index (PCDAI). CE-PEG-MRI was evaluated with an overall score calculated, taking into account both wall thickness and contrast enhancement. Results: Active CD with distal ileitis was diagnosed in 26 cases, active ulcerative colitis (UC) in 18, and spondyloarthropathy and indeterminate ileocolitis in 11; 20 children served as controls. In all CD patients, CE-PEG- MRI revealed a marked ileal involvement with increased wall thickness and parietal contrast enhancement and showed a high concordance with endoscopy and histology, whereas the test was negative in all controls.

40|$|Tuberculosis of {{the spine}} {{is the most common}} and the most {{dangerous}} of all forms of skeletal tuberculosis, and an increasing dissatisfaction is developing with the results of our present methods of treatment. The harmful effects of prolonged recumbency, especially in adults, are well known, and there is a growing tendency towards early operative intervention and perhaps towards a too optimistic view of the benefits of antibiotics. Nevertheless our present methods are based upon long experience and should be reviewed carefully before being altered radically.

Later Hibbs (1 91 8) reported a series of 210 cases of spinal caries treated by surgical fusion during the active phase of the disease.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{dynamically}} and rapidly adjust task performance {{based on its}} outcome is fundamental to adaptive, flexible behavior. Over trials of a task, responses speed up until an error is committed and after the error responses slow down. These dynamic adjustments serve to optimize performance and are well-described by the speed-accuracy trade-off (SATO) function. We hypothesized that SATOs based on outcomes reflect reciprocal changes in the allocation of attention between the internal milieu and the task-at-hand, as indexed by reciprocal changes in activity between the default and dorsal attention brain networks. We tested this hypothesis using functional MRI to examine the pattern of network activation over a series of trials surrounding and including an error. We further hypothesized that these reciprocal changes in network activity are coordinated by the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and would rely on the structural integrity of its white matter connections. Using diffusion tensor imaging, we examined whether fractional anisotropy of the posterior cingulum bundle correlated with the magnitude of reciprocal changes in network activation around errors. As expected, reaction time (RT) in trials surrounding errors was consistent with predictions from the SATO function. Activation in the default network was: (i) inversely correlated with RT, (ii) greater on trials before than after an error and (iii) maximal at the error. In contrast, activation in the right intraparietal sulcus of the dorsal attention network was (i) positively correlated with RT <b>and</b> <b>showe...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{geographic}} information required to implement precision viticulture applications in real fields {{has led to}} the extensive use of remote sensing and airborne imagery. While advantageous because they cover large areas and provide diverse radiometric data, they are unreachable to most of medium-size Spanish growers who cannot afford such image sourcing. This research develops a new methodology to generate globally-referenced vigor maps in vineyards from ground images taken with a camera mounted on a conventional tractor. This monocular camera was able to sense in the visible, NIR, and UV spectra, selectively isolated with bandpass filters. The versatility of the system was further enhanced by implementing two sampling levels: intensive coverage of 1 m 2 and super-intensive for 0. 1 m 2. The core of the procedure resides in the algorithm for automatically segmenting the filtered images {{in such a way that}} relative differences in canopy vigor were objectively quantified. The calculation of the dynamic threshold involved the math-ematical concepts of gradient and curvature. Field results showed that relative differences in vine vigor can be de-tected from NIR-filtered images and intensive sampling. Furthermore, individual images were successfully merged into a global vigor map that can be directly employed by end-users. Super-intensive sampling and UV perception were not appropriate for building vigor maps, but could be of interest for other agronomical purposes as the early detection of diseases.

Case presentation: We present a case of emphysematous cholecystitis in a middle-aged diabetic patient who, postoperatively, presented edema in both flanks and left chest crepitation on palpation, associated with hemodynamic worsening. Computed tomography scan of the chest and abdomen revealed a large pneumomediastinum, pneumoretroperitoneum, gas in subcutaneous tissue and flank abscesses. In both blood and surgical wound exudate cultures, Escherichia coli was found. Conclusion: Emphysematous cholecystitis {{should be considered as}} a possible cause of pneumomediastinum. Background Emphysematous cholecystitis (EC) is a rare life-threatening form of acute cholecystitis presenting mainly in patients aged 50 - 70 years. The rate of male-female incidence is 3 - 8 / 1 [1], while the mortality rate due to EC is reported as 15 % compared to 4 % for acutecholecystitis [1, 2]. Approximately 50 % of patients have diabetes mellitus and suffer other types of associated pathology such as peripheral vascular disease [2]. In these patients, EC frequently occurs without severe symptoms. EC is widely considered to be caused by a gas-forming micro-organism in general.

Methodology/Principal Findings: Eighteen healthy subjects, age 2162 year, BMI 22. 662. 6 kgm 22 followed randomly three physical activity regimes for four days. Participants were instructed to sit 14 hr/day (sitting regime); to sit 13 hr/day and to substitute 1 hr of sitting with vigorous exercise 1 hr (exercise regime); to substitute 6 hrs sitting with 4 hr walking and 2 hr standing (minimal intensity physical activity (PA) regime). The sitting and exercise regime had comparable numbers of sitting hours; the exercise and minimal intensity PA regime had the same daily energy expenditure. PA was assessed continuously by an activity monitor (ActivPAL) and a diary. Measurements of insulin sensitivity (oral glucose tolerance test, OGTT) and plasma lipids were performed in the fasting state, the morning after the 4 days of each regime. In the sitting regime, daily energy expenditure was about 500 kcal lower than in both other regimes.
