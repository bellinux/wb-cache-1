40|$|Introduction: The <b>Day</b> <b>Ward</b> or Observation Ward is an {{essential}} part of an Accident and Emergency Department (AED), and for the hospital as a whole. The <b>Day</b> <b>Ward</b> serves as an area where patients can be observed and reviewed after a few hours, before decisions are made whether admissions are required. This study was carried out to assess the profiles of admissions to the <b>Day</b> <b>Ward</b> of the AED of RIPAS hospital and to assess the rate of admissions to the hospital. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study on 4, 459 patients who were admitted to the <b>day</b> <b>ward</b> of the AED, RIPAS Hospital from 1 st January to 30 th June 2007 was carried out. The triage sheets were analysed. Data on the time from triage to the time of admission/discharge, the presenting symptoms, and reasons for admissions to the various wards were extracted. Results: Close to 60, 000 patients visited the AED during the 6 month study. There were more male patients than female patients; however female patients were more likely to be admitted to the <b>day</b> <b>ward</b> for observation. The most common age group was in the 31 - 60 years. The most common indications for admissions to the <b>Day</b> <b>Ward</b> were for abdominal pain (18 %), non–specific giddiness (15 %), non-specific body weakness (13 %) and headache (12 %). Of the 4, 459 patients who were admitted to the <b>day</b> <b>ward,</b> only 179 patients (4. 01 %) were admitted to the hospital wards, more female than male patients. The most common symptoms were giddiness and body weakness. They were mainly admitted to the medical wards primarily for deranged laboratory investigations. The average duration spent in the <b>day</b> <b>ward</b> was 5 - 6 hours. Conclusion: The <b>Day</b> <b>Ward</b> is very essential to the AED and hospital. Many patients present to AED with a wide spectrum of symptoms, but only a small fraction of the require admission, most of them are discharged after a brief period of observation...|$|R
40|$|Aims: The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a clear {{understanding}} of the psychotropic drugs being used in older people (equal to or greater than 65 years) with mental illness being cared for by a South West Yorkshire Mental (SWYMH) NHS Trust in Wakefield, UK. Methods: Psychotropic drugs are widely prescribed in older people but compared with younger patients, relatively little has been published on their use in older people in routine clinical practice. This was a comprehensive survey of all patients equal to or greater than 65 years of age being cared for by the South West Yorkshire Mental Health NHS trust in Wakefield, England. Information collected included demographic details, clinical information about diagnosis and symptoms and detailed information about medication. patients were seen in a variety of settings including out-patients, <b>acute</b> <b>wards,</b> <b>day</b> hospitals and in the community i. e. in patients’ own homes. If patients were attending more thant one site or were being assessed by more than one team they were only included once in the study. Clinical and other information was collected by a research nurse from patients, carers, medical and nursing staff, other health care professionals and patients’ medical notes. Results: In total 595 patients were included in the study and of these 49. 4...|$|R

40|$|Background: Percentage {{reduction}} of inpatient admissions by <b>acute</b> general psychiatric <b>day</b> care in individual facilities (i. e. feasibility rate of <b>acute</b> <b>day</b> care) {{seems to be}} an important parameter for service planning. Previously reported feasibility rates showed significant variation, however, and were based on eligibility criteria defined for randomized controlled trials. This paper aims to perform an in-depth exploration of the calculation method of these feasibility rates, to propose different calculation methods expanding research definitions to the reality of service provision, and to analyze the association between the availability of residential services in regional mental health service systems and these rates. Methods: Data from the randomization process of the European Day Hospital Evaluation (EDEN) study in which a total of 1117 patients were included in five sites provided the basis to calculate site-specific and overall rates of patients for whom this mode of treatment might be adequate. Sensitivity analyses were carried out by varying the selection of patients’ eligibility criteria and thus calculating different feasibility estimates. Data on the regional mental health care systems were collected by use of the European Service Mapping Schedule. Results: The use of four different calculation methods showed that site-specific feasibility rates of <b>acute</b> <b>day</b> care for general psychiatric patients varied from 13. 8 % to 25. 7 % up to 44. 1 % to 79. 0 %. Overall rates varied from 17. 3 % up to 67. 7 %, respectively. The high values were calculated under a scenario where the current <b>acute</b> <b>day</b> care model of care is enhanced to manage more complicated patients than currently treated under existing <b>acute</b> <b>day</b> care models. In three out of the four calculation methods higher rates were calculated for sites which demonstrated higher figures of residential services, and thus were less advanced in their process of deinstitutionalization. Conclusions: In order to determine the capacity of day hospitals as an alternative to acute psychiatric hospital care, mental health care planning must clearly decide on the eligibility criteria of patients to be treated in these facilities. Guided by such definitions, treatment concepts and professional qualifications of the staff in these facilities need to be adapted. The finding that less de-institutionalized regions may benefit most from a transition to <b>acute</b> <b>day</b> care as a means for promoting the transition to a community model of care for otherwise institutionalized patients must be assessed in more detail. Comprehensive research exploring the impact of all regional mental health service configuration characteristics on the concept of <b>acute</b> <b>day</b> care is needed. </p...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Ambulatory {{surgery is}} a {{standard}} of care for many surgical procedures due to cost-effectiveness and benefits to patients including the reduced risk of contracting hospital infection by reducing the hospital stay. However, late cancellations can be costly. We examined the utilisation of the surgical <b>day</b> <b>ward</b> in our institution over a four-year period. Methods: A retrospective study of surgical <b>day</b> <b>ward</b> records from September 2007 to September 2011 in one institution. Parameters investigated included the number of planned admissions. Reasons for cancellations were also collected. Results: A total of 17, 461 procedures were intended as a <b>day</b> <b>ward</b> admission during the study interval. There were 3, 539 procedures that were cancelled (20. 3 %). The prevalent proportion of cancellations (n = 1, 367) (38. 6 %) were due to patients not showing up for their procedures (7. 8 % of planned admissions); 1, 188 (33. 6 %) patients were cancelled by the admissions office due to bed shortages, accounting for 6. 8 % of planned admissions and 650 (18. 4 %) of cases were due to last minute cancellations by patients, accounting for 3. 7 % of all planned admission. The remaining 334 (9. 4 %) of cases were cancelled on medical grounds including patients who were considered unfit for the intended procedure, or anti-coagulations not appropriately ceased prior to surgery, accounting for 1. 9 % of all planned admissions. Conclusion: The cancellation rate {{in this study was}} high, mainly due to failure of patients to attend or signal their intentions, inadequate bed capacity and bed closure strategies. The ring fencing and protection of day beds and a more active patient management interaction would have had the greatest impact on increased efficiency...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{evaluate}} a <b>day</b> <b>ward</b> treatment program for eating disorders by examining the patients' expectations and experiences of treatment. Previous research suggests that patients' expectations are important variables to be considered in the treatment of eating disorders as they have shown to influence treatment outcome in various ways. The present study included 38 patients who had completed the <b>day</b> <b>ward</b> treatment and fulfilled the criteria for either anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa or eating disorder-not otherwise specified. Data was collected using the self report questionnaire Eating Disorder Patients' Expectations and Experiences of Treatment (ED-PEX) which measures patients' expectations prior to treatment as well as their experiences directly after treatment termination. Data was also collected using ten half-structured interviews which were held 3 - 18 months post treatment. Diagnosis criteria were used to assess the treatment outcome. At treatment termination 23 of 38 patients were diagnosis free. The results indicated that the control-focused interventions were most helpful according to the patients. It was also revealed that the patients desired more specific information about the {{purpose of the}} treatment components prior to, as well as during, the treatment process...|$|R

40|$|In-patient {{admission}} {{represents a}} failure of a day care service.

The in-patient admission rate could be reduced by improved out-patient selection of cases, use of a separate day care theatre, increased use oflocal anaesthetic techniques, reduction in the use ofparenteral opioids, the use of simple oral analgesics or non- steroidal anti- inflammatory agents as pre- emptive analgesia and a wider use of propofol as an induction agent which provides superior recovery from anaesthesia...|$|R
