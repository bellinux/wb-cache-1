5|$|The high injury toll and {{congested}} schedule {{contributed to}} complaints <b>about</b> <b>Joe</b> Warbrick's behaviour. His {{comments to the}} English press – who directed much of their focus towards him – were viewed negatively by {{some members of the}} squad; he was accused of neglecting to acknowledge the contributions of players such as Thomas Ellison, Gage, Keogh, and Edward McCausland but to extol the efforts of himself and his brothers.|$|E
5|$|British {{knowledge}} of thermonuclear weapons {{was based on}} work done at the Los Alamos Laboratory during the war. Two British scientists, Bretscher and Fuchs, had attended the conference on the Super (as it was then called) there in April 1946, and Chadwick had written a secret report on it in May 1946. The Classic Super design was unsuccessful. Fuchs and John von Neumann had produced an ingenious alternative design, for which they filed a patent in May 1946. This was tested in the American Operation Greenhouse George test in May 1951, but was also found to be unworkable. There was also some intelligence <b>about</b> <b>Joe</b> 4 derived from its debris, which was provided to Britain under the 1948 Modus Vivendi. Penney established three megaton bomb projects at Aldermaston. Orange Herald, under Bryan Taylor, a large boosted fission weapon; Green Bamboo an interim thermonuclear design similar to Soviet Layer Cake used in Joe 4 and the American Alarm Clock; and Green Granite, a true thermonuclear design. Orange Herald {{would be the first}} British weapon to incorporate an external neutron initiator.|$|E

Everyone dances, except for Bonnie, because her husband is handicapped. Joe feels {{self-conscious}} about his disability, and decides to get surgery so that {{he will be able to}} walk again. When Joe comes out of the operation, he invites his friends to go do physical activities such as rock climbing, karate, and dance. Joe starts to not care about his friends and his wife, and finds three new jock friends that share his status. Lois and Peter are worried <b>about</b> <b>Joe,</b> and Lois suggests that Peter should find a new friend to replace him. Meanwhile, Joe realizes that he has outgrown Bonnie and leaves her. Desperate to get their friend back, Peter, Cleveland and Quagmire try to re-cripple Joe, failing miserably until Bonnie comes along with Joe's handgun and shoots (and misses) Joe's spine. Sick of waiting in pain, Joe takes the gun and shoots himself in the spine, re-crippling himself. They all then go to the Drunken Clam where Joe apologizes to Peter, Cleveland and Quagmire for how he acted and they all forgive him.|$|E

25|$|The Vice President {{advised that}} it was {{conceivable}} {{that he may have}} had discussions <b>about</b> <b>Joe</b> Wilson during the week of 7/6/03 because the Tenet statement covered the bulk of the Wilson matter, namely that the CIA had dispatched Wilson to Niger on its own without direction from the Vice President; Wilson's report had confirmed there had been an approach by Iraq to Niger at one time; and the results of Wilson's trip were not briefed to the Vice President.|$|E

The album is narrated by a government employee identifying himself as The Central Scrutinizer, who delivers a cautionary tale <b>about</b> <b>Joe,</b> a typical adolescent male who forms a band as the government prepares to criminalize music. The Central Scrutinizer explains that music leads to a [...] "slippery slope" [...] of drug use, disease, unusual sexual practices, prison, and eventually, insanity.

500|$|Despite much prepublicity, Harlow {{received}} a lukewarm response from critics: Variety referred to Baker's portrayal of Harlow as [...] "a fairly reasonable facsimile, although she lacks the electric fire of the original." [...] Relations between Baker and Levine soured; in a 1965 interview, Baker sardonically commented: [...] "I'll say this <b>about</b> <b>Joe</b> Levine: I admire his taste in leading ladies," [...] which led {{the press to}} suspect a rift between the actress and producer. Baker sued Levine over her contract with Paramount Pictures in 1966, and was ultimately fired by Paramount and had her paychecks from Harlow frozen amid the contentious legal dispute; this left Baker {{hundreds of thousands of}} dollars in debt (however, she was eventually awarded $1 million in compensation).|$|E

Bauman was a baseball player who, despite hitting 72 home runs during the 1954 season—at the time, a record for a professional player—never {{made it to the}} Major Leagues. Duchovny immediately connected the story of Bauman, who played for the Roswell Rockets, with the 1947 Roswell Incident, saying [...] "I just made the association...What if this guy was an alien? and I just started working on that idea." [...] Duchovny later said that [...] "these happy chronological coincidences" [...] facilitated the development of the story. Duchovny worked on his idea alone, later admitting that he was satisfied that he did not receive any help.|$|E
