In this paper it is proved that the optimal controller for a discrete-time linear dynamic system with quadratic performance criterion is <b>a</b> linear <b>function</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state variables when the additive random vector is <b>a</b> nonlinear <b>function</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state and/or control variables and not necessarily Gaussian noise which is independently distributed in time, provided only that <b>the</b> mean value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> random vector is zero (there is no loss of generality in assuming this) and <b>the</b> covariance matrix <b>of</b> <b>the</b> random vector is <b>a</b> quadratic <b>function</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state and/or control variables.

5|$|Covered {{interest}} rate parity is a no-arbitrage condition in foreign exchange markets which {{depends on the}} availability of the forward market. It can be rearranged to give the forward exchange rate as <b>a</b> <b>function</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other variables. The forward exchange rate depends on three known variables: the spot exchange rate, the domestic {{interest rate}}, and the foreign interest rate. This effectively means that the forward rate is the price of a forward contract, which derives its value from the pricing of spot contracts and the addition of information on available interest rates.|$|E

Within the Haldanian logic of the model, at least three compartments are offgassing at the prescribed depth - the 5 and 10 minute half time compartments under a relatively high pressure gradient. Therefore, for decompression dives, the existing obligation is not increased during the stop.|$|E
