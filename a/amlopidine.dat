50|$|Drug-related gingival {{hyperplasia}} is a cutaneous condition {{characterized by}} {{enlargement of the}} gums noted {{during the first year}} of drug treatment. There are three drug classes that are associated with this condition namely, anticonvulsants (such as phenyotoin and phenobartibal), calcium channel blocker (such as <b>amlopidine,</b> nifedipine and verapamil) and ciclosporin, an immunosuppressant Although the mechanism of drug related gingival hyperplasia is not well understood, some risk factors for the condition include the duration of drug use and poor oral hygiene. In most cases, alternative drugs are given, in order to avoid this side effect.|$|E
40|$|Objective: This study {{assessed}} {{the effects of}} calcium chanelle blocker Amlodipine on the cerebral circulation in patientsz with essential hypertension. Methods: Cerebral circulation in 37 patients with essential hypertension and 10 healthy subjects was assessed using rheoplethysmography. In patients with essential hypertension cerebral circulation values were also re-esti-mated after treatment with <b>Amlopidine</b> (5 - 10 mg daily). Results: The cerebral circulatory parameters in hypertensive patients before treatment with Amlodipine were dif-ferent from those in healthy persons. Amlodipine along with the reduction in systemic blood pressure caused attenuation of cerebrovascular abnormalities: decrease in spastic signs and incrase in cerebral blood supply in patients with essential hypertension. Conclusion: Amlodipine causes reduction of cerebral vascular resistance and promotes improvement in arterial blood filling in patients with essential hypertension. These changes in cerebral circulation may be secondary to the increase of cardiac output-known effect of Amlodipine. (Ana Kar Der, 2001; 1 : 14 - 16...|$|E
