The reliability of assemblies which have been cleaned with vapor degreasing and spray cleaning can be seriously compromised by residual contaminants leading to solder joint failure, board corrosion, and even electrical failure of the mounted parts. In addition, recent government actions to eliminate fully halogenated chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) and chlorinated hydrocarbons from the industrial environment require the development of new <b>cleaning</b> <b>materials</b> and techniques. This paper will discuss alternative <b>cleaning</b> <b>materials</b> and techniques and results that can be expected with them.

40|$|Hypothesis Due {{to their}} highly {{retentive}} properties, innovative recently developed, semi-interpenetrated hydrogels {{made up of}} poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) chains embedded in a poly(2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (p(HEMA)) network should be efficiently used as <b>cleaning</b> <b>material</b> for fragile and degraded paper artworks. In restoration practice, indeed the wet cleaning of these artworks is usually performed by immersion of paper in water, a procedure which may lead to several drawbacks, including paper fibers swelling and dissolution of water-soluble original components. Experiments This class of gels were yet presented in literature, but their interactions with paper materials and ability to be spiked with active enzymes (as cleaning agents), have not been analyzed. To establish the suitability of these hydrogels as paper <b>cleaning</b> <b>materials,</b> first, a rheological and microstructural characterization of the gels was performed. Moreover, diffusion of macromolecules inside gels was studied using fluorescence microscopy, to check if these innovative hydrogels {{can be used as}} carriers for hydrolytic enzymes. Indeed, pastes and glues are usually found in old paper artworks, and their removal is a very delicate operation that requires a selective action, which is granted by specific hydrolytic enzymes. At the same time, spectroscopic analyses on paper samples under investigation before and after cleaning treatment has been performed, thus assessing the capabilty of these gels as <b>cleaning</b> <b>materials.</b> Findings With the aim of demonstrating the versatility of these hydrogels, several case studies, i. e., the removal of grime and water-soluble cellulose degradation byproducts, the removal of animal glue and the removal of starch paste from real samples, are presented.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to develop an {{environmentally}} conscious closed-loop cleaning process which would meet the cleaning needs of ATC, reduce worker exposure to hazardous chemicals, and eliminate or reduce their hazardous waste. In order to accomplish this, new <b>cleaning</b> <b>materials</b> needed {{to be tested for}} cleaning efficacy as compared to trichloroethylene. The project work plan was broken down into five phases including establishing a baseline cleaning level, evaluating alternative cleaners, specifying and purchasing closed-loop cleaning equipment, installing and evaluating the new equipment, and publicizing the results. In general, it was the responsibility of the KCP to perform cleaning efficacy measurements on sample panels and actual parts that were processed by ATC. The cleaners chosen were evaluated for their abilities to remove the potential contaminants using an ultrasonic cleaning process at the KCP. The cleaning abilities of 20 different cleaners were compared to that of trichloroethylene, the baseline <b>cleaning</b> <b>material.</b> At least nine alternative cleaners produced cleaning results which exceeded trichloroethylene for this application. After evaluating the alternative cleaners and as new cleaning equipment was being tested, ATC terminated the Cooperative Agreement. Further equipment evaluations were suspended...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, the dry {{cleaning}} process has become an excellent alternative to solvent or water-based mixtures, which prevents diffusing the dirt into the painting structure during the cleaning process. The use {{of this kind of}} cleaning is especially effective on contemporary paintings as it prevents the solubilisation of additives such as the surfactants contained in polymeric dispersions (e. g. in acrylic and PVAc-based paints). In addition to some reported side effects that could be caused by dry cleaning processes on paintings (such as changes in the integrity of the paint or any residual materials which may be left behind) one parameter that should be tested is the colorimetric change seen on treated surfaces. In some cases, the use of certain dry <b>cleaning</b> <b>materials</b> can cause burnishing or roughening of the painted surface. This effect results in a change in brightness and chroma and subsequently to a change in the colour of the treated area, especially on dark shades. This article evaluates the colorimetric change of different kinds of painted surfaces caused by the dry cleaning process, such as gouache, commercial formulated acrylic, fish glue tempera, casein tempera, PVAc and primal acrylic paint. The <b>cleaning</b> <b>materials</b> tested include different kinds of sponge cloths, malleable materials and erasers used in the field of heritage conservation/restoration. The change in colour is measured by means of a spectrophotometer and the chromatic values are processed in a spreadsheet.
