5|$|Peter asks Quagmire {{where he}} heard the dirty joke in the first place, and Quagmire reveals that he heard it from Bruce. Locating Bruce at {{his job at the}} bowling alley, the group discovers that the joke has been {{transmitted}} by <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people,</b> and eventually trace it to a Virginia bartender.|$|E
5|$|The Christmas tree is {{decorated}} with lights that are switched on at a seasonal ceremony. It is usually held twelve days before Christmas Day. The festivity {{is open to the}} public and attracts <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people.</b> The switch-on is usually followed by several nights of Christmas carol singing and other performances and events. On the twelfth night of Christmas, the tree is taken down for recycling. Westminster City Council threatened to abandon the event to save £5,000 in 1980 but the decision was reversed.|$|E
5|$|The {{registration}} for, and issuing of, National identity cards, {{a legally}} required document for accessing various services, to these remote tribes has been problematic for many years, {{and in the}} past had even resulted in <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> from the Penan ethnic group being rendered effectively stateless. In recent years, this issue has seen progressive improvement with the implementation of systems such as mobile registration units.|$|E
50|$|If the IDS doesn't {{garbage collect}} TCBs {{correctly}} and efficiently, an attacker can exhaust the IDS's memory by starting <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> TCP connections very quickly. Similar attacks {{can be made}} by fragmenting <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> packets into <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> smaller packets, or send <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> out-of-order TCP segments.|$|R

5|$|The {{sex ratio}} in 2011, at 908 women to 1000 men, {{was lower than}} the {{national}} figure of 933. The state's 2001–2011 decennial growth rate (including Uttrakhand) was 20.09%, {{higher than the national}} rate of 17.64%. Uttar Pradesh has <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> living below the poverty line. Estimates released by the Planning Commission for the year 2009–10 revealed that Uttar Pradesh had 59million people below the poverty line, the most for any state in India.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{had been}} {{authorized}} by Congress to recruit {{an army of}} up to 28,501 troops, but he had only 19,000 when he reached New York. Military discipline was inadequate; routine orders were not carried out, muskets were fired in camp, flints were ruined, bayonets were used as knives to cut food, and firearm readiness was lax. Petty internal conflict was common under the strain of <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> from different environments and temperaments in relative closeness.|$|E
5|$|As the Cardiff team bus {{arrived at}} the stadium, the fans threw leeks at the vehicle. The team had adopted a black cat for the occasion, which Ferguson had found {{wandering}} astray prior to their earlier match with Bolton and decided {{it was a good}} omen. He found the owners of the animal, who agreed to let the club keep the cat in return for two final tickets if they progressed that far. Police reinforcements were required at Empire Stadium, as at 1pm <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> had gathered outside the ticket office in a threatening manner. A large number of fake tickets had been sold to members of the crowd, and the stewards were refusing to allow them entry.|$|E

30|$|The {{forests that}} are cleared for mining {{purposes}} {{are home to}} <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> organisms. Indiscriminate clearing of the forests leads to loss <b>of</b> habitat <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> animals.

5|$|The {{cutting of}} the first sod for the Isle of Axholme Light Railway was an {{altogether}} grander occasion. It took place on 20 July 1899, and was reported at great length in the Epworth Bells newspaper. The ceremony was performed by Miss Bletcher, the daughter {{of one of the}} Directors, after which a luncheon for <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> was held in a marquee. Following speeches, about 400 children were given a free tea in the Temperance Hall, while adults were catered for in the schoolrooms of four local chapels. Sports were then held, watched by a crowd of 1,500, and finally there was a fireworks display. Most of the children later received a commemorative medal.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> staged protests near Jantar Mantar, New Delhi. There were minor clashes between some groups of protesters and the police; the police then removed some protesters from the area. One group of protesters also observed a one-day hunger strike at Jantar Mantar. All roads leading to India Gate were closed by police and areas where protesters had gathered {{during the previous}} week were out of bounds to the public. Some of the protesters drew graffiti and slogans on papers spread on the road, condemning the incident and demanding stricter laws and speedy judgement. The BJP renewed its demand for a special parliament session to discuss the case and to adopt stricter laws on crime against women.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Beryl was a weak system, {{and unlike}} Alberto, its rapid motion up the Eastern Seaboard spread its heavy {{rainfall}} across a large area. Beryl caused inland flooding {{as it moved}} through Georgia, across the Carolinas, {{and all the way}} to Connecticut. Property damage reached at least $74.22 million, with $40 million in damage in South Carolina, $15 million in Virginia, $12 million in New York, $5.9 million in Florida, and at least $1.32 million in Georgia. Five deaths were reported, while <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> ndash& 37 in Lexington County, South Carolina, alone ndash& were injured by the tornadoes Beryl produced as it weakened.|$|E

5|$|Spanish {{control of}} Texas was {{followed}} by Mexican control of Texas, {{and it can be}} difficult to separate the Spanish and Mexican influences on the future state. The most obvious legacy is that of the language; the state's name comes from the Spanish rendering of an Indian word. Every major river in modern Texas, except the Red River, has a Spanish or Anglicized name, as do 42 of the state's 254 counties and numerous towns also bear Spanish names. Even many of the words that have been incorporated into American English, such as barbecue, canyon, ranch, and plaza, come from Spanish words. An additional obvious legacy is that of Roman Catholicism. At the end of Spain's reign over Texas, virtually all inhabitants practiced the Catholic religion, and it is still practiced in Texas by <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people.</b> The Spanish missions built in San Antonio to convert Indians to Catholicism have been restored and are a National Historic Landmark.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{principal}} damage mechanisms {{to the inner}} ear in industrialised society, and both injure hair cells. The first is exposure to elevated sound levels (noise trauma), {{and the second is}} exposure to drugs and other substances (ototoxicity). <b>A</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> are exposed to sound levels on a daily basis that are likely to lead to significant hearing loss. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has recently published research on the estimated numbers of persons with hearing difficulty (11%) and the percentage of those that can be attributed to occupational noise exposure (24%). Furthermore, according to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), approximately twenty-two million (17%) US workers reported exposure to hazardous workplace noise. Workers exposed to hazardous noise further exacerbate the potential for developing noise-induced hearing loss when they do not wear hearing protection.|$|E
