5|$|The Severn bore is a {{tidal bore}} {{seen on the}} tidal reaches of the River Severn in south western England. It is formed when the rising tide moves into the funnel-shaped Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary and the surging water forces its way {{upstream}} {{in a series of}} waves, as far as Gloucester and beyond. The bore behaves differently in different stretches of the river; in the lower, wider parts it is more noticeable in the deep channels as a slight roller, while the water creeps <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> and mudflats. In the narrower, upper reaches, the river occupies the whole area between its banks and the bore advances in a series of waves that move upstream. Near Gloucester, the advancing water overcomes two weirs, and sometimes one in Tewkesbury, before finally petering out.|$|E
5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race—two on Friday, {{and a third}} on Saturday. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions each lasted 90minutes. The third session was held on Saturday morning and lasted an hour. The Ferraris outpaced the other teams in the first session on a dusty track surrounded by the sand dune desert of Sakhir. Massa's time of 1:32.233 was quicker than Räikkönen's, who was slowed down by an early excursion <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand,</b> requiring a pit stop. Nico Rosberg of Williams, Hamilton, McLaren driver Heikki Kovalainen, Williams driver Kazuki Nakajima and Kubica rounded out the top seven. In the second session, Hamilton lost control {{of his car and}} slid sideways into a wall. Hamilton emerged unharmed from the collision, but his McLaren suffered significant damage. Except for the crash, the second session ended like the first: once again, Massa led Räikkönen to Ferrari 1–2, ahead of Kovalainen, Hamilton and Kubica. The third session was again held on a dusty track, where Rosberg was quickest with a time of 1:32.521. Massa took second, ahead of Red Bull driver Mark Webber, Toyota driver Jarno Trulli, David Coulthard of Red Bull, Nakajima and Kubica. Räikkönen was ninth quickest, and Hamilton 18th.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Peter Wilcock and Joanna Crowe (now Joanna Curran) {{published}} a sediment transport formula {{that works with}} multiple grain sizes <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> and gravel range. Their formula works with surface grain size distributions, as opposed to older models which use subsurface grain size distributions (and thereby implicitly infer a surface grain sorting).|$|E

25|$|In October 23, 1826, the {{engineers}} submitted the study, presenting the proposed canal route in three sections. The eastern section comprised Georgetown to Cumberland; the middle section, Cumberland (going up Wills Creek to Hyndman then <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sand</b> Patch Grade crossing the Eastern Continental Divide to Garrett) to {{the confluence of}} the Casselman River and the Youghiogheny River; and the western section from there to Pittsburgh.|$|E
25|$|The {{group that}} landed at Le Touquet had the Merlimont Plage Hotel as an objective. Intelligence had {{suggested}} that the Germans were using the hotel as a barracks. When the group reached the hotel they discovered it was empty and {{the doors and windows}} boarded up. Unable to find another target, they returned to the beach, only to discover their boat had put back out to sea. During the wait, two German sentries stumbled on the group and were quietly killed by the troops' bayonets. Another German patrol then approached <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> dunes and the group was forced to swim out to the boat, leaving its weapons behind.|$|E
25|$|Brigadier General S. F.

The 159th (Cheshire) Brigade on the left was to capture Sheikh Ajlin on the sea shore, while the 160th (Wales) Brigade on the right was to capture Sampson Ridge, each supported by one tank. They were to subsequently {{make contact with the}} 52nd (Lowland) Division on Ali Muntar in order to launch a joint attack from the Zowaiid trench in the west to the Romani trench on the Rafa to Gaza road.|$|E

25|$|Long {{before the}} Eighth Army reached {{the port of}} Tripoli, thought {{had been given to}} an attack on the Mareth line and the LRDG had been sent to survey the land south of the Matmata Hills. Despite maps and reports {{indicating}} that the ground was impossible for tanks and lorrries, the LRDG found a route inland southwards and around the hills to the Tebaga Gap, between the Chott el Fejaj salt marsh and the hills. The 7th Armoured Division (Major-General George Erskine) had probed forward from Tripoli, while the 51st (Highland) Division (Major-General Douglas Wimberley) and the 2nd New Zealand Division (Major-General Bernard Freyberg) rested at the port. Winter rains turned the ground into a swamp, until a short lull beginning on 15 February, when the 7th Armoured and 51st (Highland) divisions moved forward and captured airfields at Medenine on 17 February. Next day the Free French Flying Column (FFFC) and the 1st Infantry Battalion Marine and Pacific (1st IBMP) arrived with General Philippe Leclerc, after a long march <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sand</b> Sea from Lake Chad to join the Eighth Army. XXX Corps (Lieutenant-General Oliver Leese) brought the 2nd New Zealand Division forward from Tripoli, which had the 8th Armoured Brigade and the 201st Guards Brigade under command.|$|E
500|$|Edson {{brought with}} him a [...] "hastily devised" [...] plan of attack—primarily written by Lieutenant Colonel Merrill B. Twining, a member of Vandegrift's {{division}} staff—that called for Griffith's Raiders—along with Puller's Company C—to cross the one-log bridge and then outflank the Japanese at the river mouth/sand spit from the south. At the same time, McDougal's battalion was to attack <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> spit. If the attacks were successful, the rest of Puller's battalion would land by boat west of Point Cruz to take the Japanese by surprise from the rear. Aircraft from Henderson Field—as well as Marine [...] and [...] artillery—would provide support for the operation. The Marine offensive would begin the next day, on 27 September.|$|E

60|$|By and by {{he found}} it needful to engage some drain-cutters, and one {{afternoon}} Jake, taking Carrie with him, started for a village {{on the other side}} of the bay. It was a long way round <b>the</b> <b>sands</b> and when they were near the village the car stopped and Jake found a valve had broken. He engaged the men he wanted and afterwards resolved to leave the car and walk back <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>sands.</b> <b>The</b> few cottages were very small and their occupants had no room for strangers, but the bay got narrow near its mouth and <b>the</b> distance <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>sands</b> was scarcely three miles. Jake did not expect to find much water in the channels, and when he had borrowed a pair of fishermen's waders for Carrie, and they had got a meal at a cottage, they set off.|$|R
2500|$|After sailing north, meeting Vancouver, and {{spending}} {{a time in}} Grays Harbor, as it was later named, Gray returned to the river. This time he ordered a small sailboat launched to attempt to find a safe passage <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> bars in the process known as sounding. Finally in the evening of May 11, 1792, Gray's men found a safe channel, and so ship and crew sailed into the estuary of the Columbia River.|$|E
2500|$|When on Monday {{morning it}} {{appeared}} that the tug might break up, Captain Erickson signaled the life-saving crew, which had been waiting on the beach since Friday, to execute a rescue.

2500|$|Afterward, Gray {{carried on}} south to what was, he rightly suspected, {{the mouth of}} a great river, and looked further for a way into this river.

Finally, on the evening of May 11, 1792, Gray's men found a safe channel, so ship and crew sailed into the estuary of the Columbia River.

2500|$|Only one {{infantry}} division could be supplied and maintained {{at a distance}} of [...] from railhead, with the camels and wheeled transport allotted to the EEF infantry corps. During the attack on Beersheba the transport of the XXI Corps had been assigned to supply the XX Corps, which marched back to near railhead at Karm after the victory. Here minimal transport was needed so the transport was sent back to the XXI Corps. Many thousands of camels in long lines slowly converged on their allotted areas, before being loaded up for the advance. Motor lorries caked with dust, also drove westwards <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> and powdered earth. The sleepless drivers' vehicles were then load up before driving off to supply their infantry units.|$|E
2500|$|Once he had recovered, Stirling {{involved}} him in {{preparations for}} a larger SAS attack on Benghazi. They attended a dinner with Churchill, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff General Alan Brooke, and General Harold Alexander, {{who was about to}} assume control of Middle East Command, the post responsible for the overall conduct of the campaign in the North African desert. Four operations were designed to create a diversion from Rommel's attempt on El Alamein: attacks on Benghazi (Operation Bigamy), Tobruk, Barce, and the Jalo oasis. [...] These all started out from Kufra, an oasis 800 miles inland. [...] Maclean's convoy drove to the Gebel <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sand</b> Sea at its narrowest point, Zighen, and made it there undetected, although [...] "bazaar gossip" [...] from an Arab spy indicated that the enemy expected an imminent attack. When Maclean's group reached the outskirts of Benghazi, they were ambushed and had to retreat. [...] Axis planes repeatedly bombed them, destroying many of the vehicles and most of their supplies. Thus began a painful limp of days and nights over the desert towards Jalo, without even knowing whether that oasis was in Allied hands. They existed on rations of [...] "a cup of water and a tablespoon of bully beef a day.... We found ourselves looking forward to the evening meal with painful fixity". When they got to that oasis, they found a battle going on between the Italian defenders and the Sudan Defence Force, and despite their offers to help, they received orders from GHQ to abandon the assault. [...] Some days later they made it back to Kufra.|$|E
