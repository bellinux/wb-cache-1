5|$|Alpine {{skiing is}} an Olympic sport, contested at the Winter Olympic Games. The first Winter Olympics, held in 1924, {{included}} nordic skiing, {{but the first}} alpine skiing events were not held until 1936 in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany. A combined event was held for both men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> 1936. The International Ski Federation (FIS) decided that ski instructors could not compete in 1936 because they were professionals, and the Olympics were meant for amateur athletes. Because of this, Austrian and Swiss skiers boycotted the events, although some Austrians decided to compete for Germany.|$|E
5|$|Cats {{are common}} pets {{throughout}} the world, and their worldwide population exceeds 500million.

5|$|The {{expanding}} {{population of}} Scandinavia {{led to a}} shortage of available resources and arable land there {{and led to a}} period of Viking expansion, the Norse gradually shifting their attention from plundering to invasion. Shetland was colonised during the late 8th and 9th centuries, the fate of the existing indigenous population being uncertain.

5|$|After his stint {{with the}} Conquistadors, Chamberlain {{successfully}} went into business and entertainment, made money {{in stocks and}} real estate, bought a popular Harlem nightclub, which he renamed Big Wilt's Smalls Paradise, and invested in broodmares. Chamberlain also sponsored his personal professional volleyball and track and field teams, and also provided high-level teams for girls <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> basketball, track, volleyball and softball, and made money by appearing in ads for TWA, American Express, Volkswagen, Drexel Burnham, Le Tigre Clothing and Foot Locker. After his basketball career, volleyball became Chamberlain's new passion: being a talented hobby volleyballer during his Lakers days, he became {{board member of the}} newly founded International Volleyball Association in 1974 and became its president one year later. As a testament to his importance, the IVA All-Star game was televised only because Chamberlain also played in it: he rose to the challenge and was named the game's MVP. He played occasional matches for the IVA Seattle Smashers before the league folded in 1979. Chamberlain promoted the sport so effectively that he was named to the Volleyball Hall of Fame: {{he became one of the}} few athletes who were enshrined in different sports.|$|E
5|$|Antibody {{tests in}} {{children}} younger than 18months are typically inaccurate due to the continued presence of maternal antibodies. Thus HIV infection can only be diagnosed by PCR testing for HIV RNA or DNA, or via testing for the p24 antigen. Much of the world lacks access to reliable PCR testing and many places simply wait until either symptoms develop or the child is old enough for accurate antibody testing. In sub-Saharan Africa as of 2007–2009 between 30 and 70% of the population were aware of their HIV status. In 2009, between 3.6 and 42% of men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> Sub-Saharan countries were tested which represented a significant increase compared to previous years.|$|E

5|$|Between September 1997 and September 2006, Woon was {{seconded}} to the Foreign Service. He was Singapore's Ambassador to Germany from 6 February 1998 to July 2003, and was concurrently accredited to Greece from March 2000 to July 2003. He then {{served as}} Ambassador to Belgium (from 22 August 2003) with concurrent accreditation to the European Union, the Netherlands (from 22 October 2003), Luxembourg and the Holy See. In this capacity, he represented Singapore together with Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Law S. Jayakumar {{at the funeral}} mass of Pope John Paul II in the Vatican City on 8 April 2005, {{believed to be the}} largest gathering of heads of state in history. In 2006, the Vatican made Woon a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St. Gregory the Great, which is conferred on Roman Catholic men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> recognition of their service to the Church, unusual labours, support of the Holy See, and the good example set in their communities and country.|$|E
5|$|Chesney was {{a builder}} in his diocese, where {{he ordered the}} {{construction}} of the episcopal palace. He also founded a Gilbertine house of canons just outside the city of Lincoln, the priory of St Catherine, shortly after the order was recognised by the papacy in 1148. Unusually for its time it was only founded for men, although Gilbertine monastic houses typically accommodated both men <b>and</b> <b>women.</b> <b>In</b> 1161 he bought the Old Temple in London as a house for himself. These expenditures contributed to his financial difficulties, along with royal demands, which led to complaints about Chesney's spending. Another cause for complaint was that he gave away some of his estates as marriage portions for his nieces. Chesney also was a benefactor to the town of Banbury, to which he granted the right to hold a fair some time before 1154.|$|E
5|$|Clay {{attempts}} to romance Rain Turner, a gorgeous young woman auditioning {{for a role}} in his new film, leading her on {{with the promise of}} being cast, all the while knowing she is too old for the part. His narration reveals he has done this with a number of men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> the past, and yet often comes out of the relationship hurt and damaged himself. Over the course of their relationship, he is stalked by unknown persons driving a Jeep and is frequently reminded by various individuals of the grisly murder of a young producer whom he knew. Clay disinterestedly watches a snuff film of the murder—later attributed to Rip—on his iPhone.|$|E

40|$|Although the {{prevalence}} of overweight and obesity in Australia has increased during the past 30 years, {{little is known about}} the dietary and behavioural antecedents of body mass index (BMI). We examined changes in mean BMI, diet, and other lifestyle behaviours between 1976 and 2005 and described the cross-sectional associations between these factors and BMI. A series of biennial biomedical surveys by Sydney Adventist Hospital from 1976 to 2005 allowed examination of BMI trends, while the selection of three surveys enabled detailed examination of likely dietary and lifestyle associations. Subjects included in this study were: 384 men <b>and</b> 338 <b>women</b> <b>in</b> 1976; 160 men <b>and</b> 146 <b>women</b> <b>in</b> 1978; 166 men <b>and</b> 141 <b>women</b> <b>in</b> 1980; 164 men <b>and</b> 142 <b>women</b> <b>in</b> 1982; 177 men <b>and</b> 13 <b>women</b> <b>in</b> 1984; 239 men <b>and</b> 227 <b>women</b> <b>in</b> 1986; 210 men <b>and</b> 225 <b>women</b> <b>in</b> 1988; 165 men <b>and</b> 148 <b>women</b> <b>in</b> 1990; 138 men <b>and</b> 167 <b>women</b> <b>in</b> 1992 <b>and</b> 270 men <b>and</b> 62 <b>women</b> <b>in</b> 2005. Height <b>and</b> weight were measured by hospital staff. Mean BMI increased in the early 1990 s. Salt, coffee, cola, alcohol and meat consumption, dieting to lose weight and eating between meals were positively associated with BMI while physical activity, food variety, large breakfasts and consumption of spreads were negatively associated. Food consumption and daily activities have important associations with BMI, though their specific associations differ by sex. “Affluent” lifestyle patterns appear to contribute to higher BMI, while a more “prudent” lifestyle seems to protect from such increases...|$|R
5|$|Concepts of women's {{social rights}} {{and social status}} during the Tang era were notably liberal-minded for the period. However, this was largely {{reserved}} for urban women of elite status, as men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> the rural countryside labored hard in their different set of tasks; with wives and daughters responsible for more domestic tasks of weaving textiles and rearing of silk worms, while men tended to farming in the fields. There were many women in the Tang era who gained access to religious authority by taking vows as Daoist priestesses. The head mistresses of the bordellos in the North Hamlet of the capital Chang'an acquired large amounts of wealth and power. Their high-class courtesans, who likely influenced the Japanese geishas, were well respected. These courtesans were known as great singers and poets, supervised banquets and feasts, knew the rules to all the drinking games, and were trained to have the utmost respectable table manners.|$|E
5|$|Demi Moore had {{appeared}} {{on the cover of}} Vanity Fair exactly one year earlier in the August 1991 edition in Leibovitz's photograph, More Demi Moore. As a groundbreaking work, the photograph of her pregnant pose was an iconic one for Moore, Leibovitz <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> general who now view public representation of pregnancy as socially acceptable. It had a cultural impact by causing numerous celebrities to pose for photographs in advanced pregnancy, which has made pregnancy photos fashionable and created a profitable business for photographers such as Jennifer Loomis. The American Society of Magazine Editors regards it {{as one of the best}} U.S. magazine covers ever, and it is one of Leibovitz' best-known works. Additionally, the photo served as a litmus test when Internet decency standards were first being legislated and adjudicated.|$|E
5|$|Freestyle {{skiing is}} one of the six skiing {{disciplines}} contested at the Winter Olympic Games, and one of the youngest. In 1924, the first Winter Olympics featured Nordic skiing disciplines (cross-country skiing, ski jumping, and Nordic combined), while alpine skiing was first contested in 1936. Only at the 1992 Winter Olympics, in Albertville, France, were freestyle skiing events first held as official medal events. Before that, freestyle skiing was contested at the 1988 Winter Olympics as a demonstration sport, consisting of events for both men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> three variants: moguls, aerials and ski ballet. In Albertville, moguls was the first-ever official freestyle skiing medal event; aerials and ski ballet were also held but still as demonstration events. The growing popularity of aerials convinced the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to add this freestyle discipline to the 1994 Winter Olympics official program. Moguls and aerials have thus been contested at every Winter Games since. Ski cross inclusion in the Winter Olympics program was approved at an IOC Executive Board meeting in November 2006, and the first events were held at the 2010 Winter Olympics.|$|E
