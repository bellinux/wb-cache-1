5|$|Forest owners with pre-1990 forests were {{to receive}} a fixed one-off free <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> units. Transport (liquid fossil fuels), {{stationary}} energy and industrial processes would not receive a free <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> units. Trade-exposed industries would have received a free <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> 90% of 2005 emissions annually to 2018. From 2019 to 2029 the free <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> units would have phased out {{at the rate of}} a 1/12 (8.3%) reduction each year. Agriculture would have received a free <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> 90% of 2005 emissions each year to 2018. From 2019 to 2029 the free allocation would have phased out at the rate of a 1/12 (8.3%) reduction each year.

At various times locomotives were also seconded to Liverpool Edge Hill (8A). A typical <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> the 1950s was Camden 15, Crewe North 10, Polmadie 9 and Upperby 4.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the links between}} the time <b>allocations</b> <b>of</b> partners in couple families, {{and the impact of}} children on these links. The analyses are conducted on samples separated according to the age of the youngest child. In childless couple families the time <b>allocations</b> <b>of</b> partners have complementary relationships. In couple families with only older (than 12 years) children, the time <b>allocations</b> <b>of</b> partners appear to be independent. In contrast, in couple families with younger children the time allocated to home duties and employment-related activities by the partners are substitutes. Children therefore affect the time allocation decisions in couple families through reducing the apparent complementarity in time <b>allocations</b> <b>of</b> their parents...|$|R
40|$|We propose an {{intermediation}} core for {{an economy}} that explicitly specifies how traders organize themselves into trade cooperatives (intermediaries) and how trade between them gets carried out. The intermediation core allocations {{are closely related to}} the equilibrium <b>allocations</b> <b>of</b> a non-cooperative intermediation game in Townsend (1983). We show that the intermediation core contains all subgame perfect equilibrium <b>allocations</b> <b>of</b> the intermediation game, similar to the inclusion <b>of</b> competitive equilibrium <b>allocations</b> in the core usually studied. We identify intermediation core allocations that are also subgame perfect equilibrium <b>allocations</b> <b>of</b> the intermediation game in terms of the supporting intermediary structures. These results help to characterize subgame perfect equilibrium <b>allocations</b> <b>of</b> the intermediation game and to analyze their welfare and stability properties. © 2013 Elsevier B. V...|$|R
5|$|The Labour Party {{noted that}} the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> credits to {{emitters}} on a 'intensity' basis, with no cap on emissions, meant that emitters would {{have an incentive to}} continue to emit greenhouse gases.
