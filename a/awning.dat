5|$|In the 1870s {{the flat}} <b>awning</b> over the station main's {{entrance}} {{was replaced with}} the current zig-zag canopy.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1920s, {{the station}} was proving {{inadequate}} for the passenger numbers, and so work began on a comprehensive rebuild in 1926. The new buildings were made of brick; with a large, four-chimneyed building containing most of the facilities; {{as well as a}} separate parcels office. The northern platform had a wooden <b>awning</b> built, which is still in place today.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} was altered in 1890, with two additions of Victorian architecture, the first being the main entrance, above the fanlight, is an arched <b>awning</b> with incised consoles. The other addition was the octagonal cupola {{on the roof}} over the original bell tower which dates from 1830. The exterior of the school has complementary colors. The walls are painted a cream color while the foundation, doors, window trims, and cornices are a chocolate-brown.|$|E
50|$|<b>Awnings</b> with sides {{provide the}} best sun {{protection}} for east and west facing windows. North and South facing windows can be protected from the sun with <b>awnings</b> without sides. <b>Awnings</b> provide shade keeping your house cooler, <b>awnings</b> are also great shade creators around porches, decks and patios.|$|R
50|$|Commonly used {{to shade}} a window, with a roller tube at the top, {{spring-loaded}} side arms, and a motor, crank or tape-pull operator. <b>Awnings</b> with sides are {{commonly known as}} traditional style <b>awnings</b> as they have been used for many years dating back to the early 19th century using cotton canvas fabric. Canvas was replaced in the 1960s by more acrylic materials and polyester in more recent times driven by a focus on the environment. Traditional style <b>awnings</b> are appropriate for historical buildings and are still popular today using a more weather resistant fabric such as a solution dyed acrylic fabric such as Sunbrella Fabric and a rope and pulley system for retracting the <b>awnings.</b> <b>Awnings</b> without sides do not provide as much sun protection as those with sides. <b>Awnings</b> without sides come in many different styles. Drop Arm <b>Awnings</b> without sides come with roller tubes at the top and are available with motors and wind sensors for automatic retraction. Spear <b>Awnings</b> are made without sides and are made with Wrought Iron Frames and they can be retracted with a rope and pulley system but are not available with motors.|$|R
50|$|Platforms and <b>awnings</b> were {{constantly}} re-arranged at the Roma Street Station. In 1959 the early iron carriage shed was removed {{and was replaced}} with more modest <b>awnings.</b>|$|R
5|$|Green Grocer (set number: 10185) was {{the third}} of the Modular Buildings series. It was {{originally}} released in 2008. The set contains 2352 pieces and is recommended for builders 16 {{years of age or}} older. Some of the set features include a blue and white <b>awning,</b> opening doors and windows, detailed interiors to each room, a roof terrace, a fire escape, access to a courtyard behind the building, and 4 minifigures. Advanced building techniques used in Green Grocer include using black skeleton legs and hammers to make railings, using black spear guns as railings for the fire escape, using a paddle for a pendulum in a grandfather clock, and using hinges to make a bay window.|$|E
5|$|In 1874, with Waterloo Bridge station {{becoming}} extremely busy, the LSWR {{attempted to}} take {{over one of the}} LNC's two rail lines. An 1875 agreement between the LSWR and LNC permitted the LSWR {{to take over}} the westernmost track (that not served by the platform), in return for improved terms on the lease of the land currently leased by the LNC from the LSWR, and the LSWR taking over the maintenance of the structure supporting the LNC lines. In 1876 and 1877 the roof and western wall of the LNC train shed were demolished and replaced with a cantilevered <b>awning</b> over the single platform; the platform was extended to compensate for the loss of the second line.|$|E
5|$|The {{same year}} Gaudí was {{consulted}} about {{the construction of}} a monumental train station for Barcelona (the future Estació de França). Gaudí suggested an iron structure {{in the form of a}} large suspended <b>awning,</b> a solution quite ahead of its time; perhaps for this reason, it put the head engineers off, and they declined Gaudí's offer. The last known projects by the architect are the chapel for the Colónia Calvet in Torelló, of 1923, and a pulpit for Valencia (the exact location is unknown), of 1924. From then on, Gaudí worked exclusively on the Sagrada Família until his death.|$|E
50|$|The {{platforms}} {{originally had}} glass <b>awnings</b> to shelter passengers, {{but these were}} removed in the 1970s. The sawn-off remnants of these <b>awnings</b> can still be seen attached to the station buildings.|$|R
50|$|Lateral arm <b>awnings</b> {{are also}} known as deck or patio <b>awnings,</b> as they can extend as far as 18 ft and be as long as 30 ft or more - thus {{covering}} a large outdoor space.|$|R
50|$|Aluminium <b>awnings</b> {{have long}} been popular in {{residential}} applications throughout the world. They are available in many colors and are usually painted with a baked-on enamel paint. Among the many benefits of these <b>awnings</b> are cooler temperatures inside the home, shade for your patio, extending the life of furniture and window treatments. Possibly the most beneficial feature of the <b>awnings</b> are {{the fact that they}} have a usable life of well over 40 years.|$|R
5|$|At {{the railway}} {{grouping}} of 1923, the LBSCR {{became part of}} the Southern Railway and the agreements between the hospital (renamed the East Sussex Mental Hospital in 1919) and the LBSCR were updated. The wooden platform at Hellingly station was drastically shortened in 1922. Because service levels depended on patient numbers and the hospital's coal and food requirements, the line never operated to a timetable. By 1931, passenger numbers had fallen {{to such an extent that}} the hospital authorities no longer considered passenger usage of the line to be economical, and the passenger service was withdrawn. The passenger car was moved to the hospital grounds, fitted with an <b>awning,</b> and became the hospital's sports pavilion. surviving into the mid-1990s before being destroyed in a fire started by vandals. The wooden platform at Hellingly station was removed in 1932, and the platform at the hospital was converted into a coal bay.|$|E
5|$|The team then {{flies out}} to Hawaii to film a video, with the protagonist aiming for local spots that skaters have not filmed at before. Finding a tall hotel, the protagonist climbs {{to the roof}} and {{recruits}} Eric to film a trick video atop it. The police arrive to arrest them for trespassing, but the protagonist uses the opportunity to perform a McTwist over the helicopter and onto the <b>awning</b> of an adjacent hotel, allowing them and an awestruck Eric to evade the police. The team then travels to Vancouver, British Columbia. After doing errands for locals and finishing their {{part of the team}} video, the protagonist attends the video premiere at the Slam City Jam. However, Eric steals the idea and edits the protagonist's part out of the video, allowing only Eric to become a professional. After angrily confronting Eric, the protagonist enters Eric's pro contest and wins, becoming a pro as well.|$|E
5|$|Campervans, caravans and trailer tents are {{not allowed}} into the main festival site. However, the {{purchase}} of a campervan ticket in addition to the main ticket allows access to fields just outside the boundary fence; and the cost includes access for the campervan or towing vehicle and the caravan; the car, or other vehicle used to tow the caravan, may be parked alongside it but sleeping is only authorised in the campervan/caravan and connected <b>awning,</b> not in the accompanying vehicle. One additional tent may accompany the caravan/campervan if space within the plot allows. Some people choose to bring or hire a motorhome, though drivers of larger vehicles or motorhomes may have to purchase a second campervan ticket if they cannot fit within the defined plot. The 2009 festival saw changes to the campervan fields; commercial vehicles were no longer classed as 'campervans', all campervans had to have a fitted sleeping area and either washing or cooking facilities, and caravans and trailer tents were allowed back at the festival. Prior to this only campervans were allowed on site, caravans and trailers being banned in the early 1990s after a number were stuck in the mud and abandoned.|$|E
5000|$|Retractable <b>awnings</b> are now {{becoming}} {{very popular with}} homeowners in the United States. They have been popular in Europe for many years, due to higher energy costs and lack of air conditioning. Retractable <b>awnings</b> can include the following types: ...|$|R
50|$|These are {{a modern}} {{version of the}} old {{storefront}} crank-up <b>awnings</b> of the last century. Tension arms and a roller bar are supported by a torsion bar. The torsion bar fits into wall or soffit brackets that spread the load to {{the width of the}} wall. Hand-cranked <b>awnings</b> are still available, but motorized <b>awnings</b> are now most common. The motor is inside the roller tube. Many motors now have a built-in receiver and are operated by remote control or home automation.|$|R

25|$|The three-story Italianate Jacobs Block {{was known}} also as the National Clothing House. The {{structure}} was built sometime around 1870 and the aluminum <b>awning</b> was {{added in the}} 1960s.|$|E
25|$|This tent is {{most often}} seen in a yellow/blue-grey stripe, but were also {{available}} in red/white, orange/blue, orange/white, and green/white. The tent's frame mounts to brackets {{on the roof and}} bumpers. The front bumper mount is a flat plate of steel bent into an open S or Z shape. Tent poles are steel, either black or grey, around 2cm in diameter, and there are fourteen sections that must be assembled to create a rectangular, peaked <b>awning</b> with support rods leading to the bumpers. Once the <b>awning</b> has been set up, curtains can be attached to the three outer sides (with Tenax lift-the-dot fasteners) to achieve a weatherproof - though windowless and floorless - portable shelter. Leather straps secure the sidewalls to the support poles, and stakes hold the bottom edges down as with the small tent. An additional set of poles and stakes were available to permit the outer flap to be extended horizontally as a second <b>awning,</b> resulting in a large shaded space {{on the side of the}} bus.|$|E
