5|$|Council House is {{constructed}} from concrete-encased steel frame, with lifts and service rooms located at its eastern end and a fire escape stairwell at its western end. Level 9 houses the distinctive circular Council Chamber, which features wood panelling {{and has been}} restored to largely its original state in the 1990s refurbishment (by contrast {{to most of the}} other levels of the building). The building is almost completely clad with glass, which led to criticism about its excessive air conditioning costs. The glass exterior of the building has T-shaped white sunbreakers superimposed in an <b>alternating</b> <b>pattern</b> across the building, coated with fine mosaic tiles. With the newly enclosed top floor, the building now has 13 levels above ground.|$|E
5|$|The {{behavior}} of certain other systems, such as one-dimensional cyclic cellular automata, {{can also be}} {{described in terms of}} ballistic annihilation. There is a technical restriction on the particle positions for the ballistic annihilation view of Rule 184 that does not arise in these other systems, stemming from the <b>alternating</b> <b>pattern</b> of the background: in the particle system corresponding to a Rule 184 state, if two consecutive particles are both of the same type they must be an odd number of cells apart, while if they are of opposite types they must be an even number of cells apart. However this parity restriction does not {{play a role in the}} statistical {{behavior of}} this system.|$|E
5|$|Nothing survives of the {{original}} buildings, La Oriole and the smaller St Martin's Hall in the south-east; both were demolished before the quadrangle {{was built in the}} artisan mannerist style during the 17th century. The south and west ranges and the gate tower were built around 1620 to 1622; the north and east ranges and the chapel buildings date from 1637 to 1642. The façade of the east range forms a classical E shape comprising the college chapel, hall and undercroft. The exterior and interior of the ranges are topped by an <b>alternating</b> <b>pattern</b> of decorative gables. The gate house has a Perpendicular portal and canted Gothic oriel windows, with fan vaulting in the entrance. The room above has a particularly fine plaster ceiling and chimney piece of stucco caryatids and panelling interlaced with studded bands sprouting into large flowers.|$|E

5|$|The next {{species of}} Stegosaurus {{to be named}} was S. marshi, by Frederick Lucas in 1901. Lucas {{reclassified}} this species in the new genus Hoplitosaurus later that year. Lucas also re-examined {{the issue of the}} life appearance of Stegosaurus, coming {{to the conclusion that the}} plates were arranged in pairs in two rows along the back, arranged above the bases of the ribs. Lucas commissioned Charles R. Knight to produce a life restoration of S. ungulatus based on his new interpretation. However, the following year, Lucas wrote that he now believed the plates were probably attached in staggered rows. In 1910, Richard Swann Lull wrote that the <b>alternating</b> <b>pattern</b> seen in S. stenops was probably due to shifting of the skeleton after death. He led the construction of the first ever Stegosaurus skeletal mount at the Peabody Museum of Natural History, which was depicted with paired plates. In 1914, Charles Gilmore argued against Lull's interpretation, noting that several specimens of S. stenops, including the now-completely prepared holotype, preserved the plates in alternating rows near the peak of the back, and that there was no evidence of the plates having shifted relative to the body during fossilization. Gilmore and Lucas' interpretation became the generally accepted standard, and Lull's mount at the Peabody Museum was changed to reflect this in 1924.|$|E
25|$|The 1985 {{campaign}} {{was one of}} the most frustrating in the team's history. Seattle went through an <b>alternating</b> <b>pattern</b> of winning two games in a row and losing two in a row, to end at 8-8. Quarterback Dave Krieg passed for 3,602 yards on the season. A final game loss at home to Denver proved to be a microcosm of the season, as the Seahawks squandered an early lead and then had a potentially game-tying field goal attempt hit the upright as time expired.|$|E
25|$|There {{was a small}} quirk in this <b>alternating</b> <b>pattern</b> when Edward VIII became king in January 1936 and {{was portrayed}} facing left, the same as his {{predecessor}} George V. This was because Edward thought his left to be his best side. However, Edward VIII abdicated in December 1936 and his coins were never put into general circulation. When George VI came to the throne, he had his coins struck with him facing the left, as if Edward VIII's coins had faced right (as {{they should have done}} according to tradition). Thus, in a timeline of circulating British coins, George V and VI's coins both feature left-facing portraits, although they follow directly chronologically.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} {{non-parametric}} adaptive surrogate test {{that allows for}} the differentiation of statistically significant T-Wave Alternans (TWA) from <b>alternating</b> <b>patterns</b> that can be solely explained by the statistics of noise. The proposed test is based on estimating the distribution of noise induced <b>alternating</b> <b>patterns</b> in a beat sequence from a set of surrogate data derived from repeated reshuffling of the original beat sequence. Thus, in assessing {{the significance of the}} observed <b>alternating</b> <b>patterns</b> in the data no assumptions are made about the underlying noise distribution. In addition, since the distribution of noise-induced alternans magnitudes is calculated separately for each sequence of beats within the analysis window, the method is robust to data non-stationarities in both noise and TWA. The proposed surrogate method for rejecting noise was compared to the standard noise rejection methods used with the Spectral Method (SM) and the Modified Moving Average (MMA) techniques. Using a previously described realistic multi-lead model of TWA, and real physiological noise, we demonstrate the proposed approach reduces false TWA detections, while maintaining a lower missed TWA detection compared with all the other methods tested. A simple averaging-based TWA estimation algorithm was coupled with the surrogate significance testing and was evaluated on three public databases; the Normal Sinus Rhythm Database (NRSDB), the Chronic Heart Failure Database (CHFDB) and th...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} W-waveform Standing Surface Acoustic Waves (W-SSAW), and as its application, patterning of {{two groups}} of microparticles with different sizes alternately without fixing firstly patterned particles. W-SSAW is constructed by two standing surface acoustic waves of frequencies f and 2 f. Combined with linear phase modulation to translate Gor'kov potential at a constant speed, W-SSAW can selectively trap particles. The trapped particles follow the moving Gor'kov potential maintaining force equilibrium between Stokes' drag and the radiation force by W-SSAW. There exist two asymmetric equilibrium positions every period, and by the asymmetry, each group of particles is trapped at different equilibrium positions to form an <b>alternate</b> <b>pattern.</b> This technique is extended to two-dimensional <b>alternate</b> <b>patterning</b> by maintaining phase difference 90 ^∘ between X- and Y-directional W-SSAWs. The patterning method utilizing W-SSAW is advantageous over SSAW-based patterning in {{that it does not}} require temporal separation to fix firstly patterned particles...|$|R
500|$|Each {{end of each}} caisson is {{supported}} on small wheels, which run on rails on the inside face of the [...] diameter holes {{at the ends of}} the arms. The rotation is controlled by a train of gears: an <b>alternating</b> <b>pattern</b> of three [...] diameter ring gears and two smaller idler gears, all with external teeth, as shown in the picture. The large central gear is fitted loosely over the axle at its machine-room end and fixed in place prevent it from rotating. The two smaller gears are fixed to each of the arms of the wheel at its machine-room end. When the motors rotate the central axle, the arms swing and the small gears engage the central gear, which results in the smaller gears rotating at a higher speed than the wheel but in the same direction. The smaller gears engage the large ring gears {{at the end of the}} caissons, driving them at the same speed as the wheel but in the opposite direction. This cancels the rotation due to the arms and keeps the caissons stable and perfectly level.|$|E
500|$|In 1981 for the River tour, Jackson {{arrived at}} a [...] "checkerboard" [...] {{configuration}} of loudspeakers which were supplied with nominal left and right stereo signals, the signals connected throughout the sound system in an <b>alternating</b> <b>pattern</b> of vertical lines of eight loudspeakers each, giving the audience a semblance of stereo imaging otherwise impractical on such a large scale. [...] He continued its use on the Born in the U.S.A. tour in 1985. A reporter from Popular Mechanics described the 160 main and 40 auxiliary loudspeakers typically used at a large arena or stadium. Jackson set the main loudspeakers [...] high on scaffolding, each enclosure holding two 18-inch low-frequency cone drivers, four 10-inch mid-frequency cone drivers, two high-mid compression drivers and two high-frequency compression drivers. The auxiliary zones covered audience areas which wrapped around {{to the sides of}} the stage. The 200 loudspeakers were driven by 96 amplifier channels capable of putting out a total of 380,000 watts. The tour was said to have drawn [...] "unusual critical acclaim for crispness and distortion-free performances."

500|$|John Williams {{composed}} the film's score, which earned him an Academy Award {{and was later}} ranked the sixth-greatest score by the American Film Institute. The main [...] "shark" [...] theme, a simple <b>alternating</b> <b>pattern</b> of two notes — variously identified as [...] "E and F" [...] or [...] "F and F sharp" [...] — became a classic piece of suspense music, synonymous with approaching danger (see leading-tone). Williams described the theme as [...] "grinding away at you, just as a shark would do, instinctual, relentless, unstoppable." [...] The piece was performed by tuba player Tommy Johnson. When asked by Johnson why the melody was written in such a high register and not played by the more appropriate French horn, Williams responded that {{he wanted it to}} sound [...] "a little more threatening". When Williams first demonstrated his idea to Spielberg, playing just the two notes on a piano, Spielberg was said to have laughed, thinking that it was a joke. As Williams saw similarities between Jaws and pirate movies, at other points in the score he evoked [...] "pirate music", which he called [...] "primal, but fun and entertaining". Calling for rapid, percussive string playing, the score contains echoes of La mer by Claude Debussy as well of Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring.|$|E

40|$|Non-rapid eye {{movement}} (NREM) sleep {{is characterized by}} recurring transient events (Cyclic <b>Alternating</b> <b>Patterns,</b> CAP), some of which consist of increased slow wave activity (A 1 subtype).

A significant increase of interictal activity was found during CAP A 1 subtypes. A positive correlation between scalp EEG delta power and spike activity was found only in CAP A 1 subtypes, but not during other events. These results show that transient (but not subcontinuous) delta activity has a facilitating effect on epileptoform activity, also suggesting a functional dissociation between morphologically similar delta activities.
