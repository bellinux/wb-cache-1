50|$|The {{procedure}} of the register-based census {{should lead to}} equally robust results as <b>a</b> traditional <b>census.</b> At the same time, taxpayers should incur lower costs. While <b>a</b> new <b>census</b> according to the conventional method would have cost an estimated one billion euros, according to the German Institute for Economic Research, the new model costs about 300 million euros. Estimates by the Federal Statistical Office estimated to be about 1.4 billion euros for <b>a</b> traditional <b>census</b> and around 450 million euros for <b>a</b> register-based <b>census.</b> The information portal www.zensus2011.de mentions total costs of €710 million.|$|R
50|$|Within the Europe Union a {{regulation}} for the European-wide census was agreed {{that allows for}} <b>a</b> register-based <b>census</b> that may use the continuously updated information from the national resident registers with a statistical correction drawn from <b>a</b> sample <b>census</b> performed at another magnitude of the census poll. The first register census was performed in 1981 in Denmark, joined later by other Nordic countries. Germany, Austria and Switzerland intend to use <b>a</b> register-based <b>census</b> model for the EU Census scheduled for 2011.

5|$|Early in 1902, {{the colonial}} {{government}} appointed him their {{representative to the}} Ewondo people, and interpreter and clerk for the Germans posted in Jaunde. He was tasked with organising <b>a</b> <b>census</b> and tax collection system. He chose 300 headmen to be tax collectors, of whom the Germans approved 233. Atangana negotiated a cut of 5% for the collectors, much to their delight.|$|E
5|$|Once Emperor, Domitian {{immediately}} {{sought to}} attain his long delayed military glory. As early as 82, or possibly 83, {{he went to}} Gaul, ostensibly to conduct <b>a</b> <b>census,</b> and suddenly ordered {{an attack on the}} Chatti. For this purpose, a new legion was founded, Legio I Minervia, which constructed some 75kilometres (46mi) of roads through Chattan territory to uncover the enemy's hiding places.|$|E
5|$|The war {{led to the}} {{strengthening}} of Ayutthaya's defences, such as stronger walls and forts. <b>A</b> <b>census</b> of all able-bodied men was taken, {{as well as a}} massive hunt for wild elephants for use in future wars. The size of the navy was also increased.|$|E
50|$|Section 57 of Alberta's Municipal Government Act (MGA) enables {{municipalities}} {{to conduct}} censuses. The City of Calgary first conducted <b>a</b> municipal <b>census,</b> or civic census, in 1931. It has conducted <b>a</b> civic <b>census</b> annually since 1958.|$|R

5|$|According to E. P. Sanders, {{the birth}} {{narratives}} in Matthew and Luke are the clearest case of invention in the Gospel narratives of Jesus' life. Both accounts have Jesus born in Bethlehem, {{in accordance with}} Jewish salvation history, and both have him growing up in Nazareth. But Sanders points that the two Gospels report completely different and irreconcilable explanations for how that happened. Luke's account of <b>a</b> <b>census</b> in which everyone returned to their ancestral cities is not plausible. Matthew's account is more plausible, but the story reads {{as though it was}} invented to identify Jesus as like a new Moses, and the historian Josephus reports Herod the Great's brutality without ever mentioning that he massacred little boys.|$|E
5|$|Bureaucratic affairs were {{completed}} during Diocletian's stay: <b>a</b> <b>census</b> took place, and Alexandria, in punishment for its rebellion, {{lost the ability}} to mint independently. Diocletian's reforms in the region, combined with those of Septimius Severus, brought Egyptian administrative practices much closer to Roman standards. Diocletian travelled south along the Nile the following summer, where he visited Oxyrhynchus and Elephantine. In Nubia, he made peace with the Nobatae and Blemmyes tribes. Under the terms of the peace treaty Rome's borders moved north to Philae and the two tribes received an annual gold stipend. Diocletian left Africa quickly after the treaty, moving from Upper Egypt in September 298 to Syria in February 299. He met with Galerius in Mesopotamia.|$|E
5|$|Citizens were {{organized}} {{on the basis}} of centuries and tribes, which would each gather into their own assemblies. The Comitia Centuriata ("Centuriate Assembly") was the assembly of the centuries (i.e., soldiers). The president of the Comitia Centuriata was usually a consul. The centuries would vote, one at a time, until a measure received support from a majority of the centuries. The Comitia Centuriata would elect magistrates who had geimperium powers (consuls and praetors). It also elected censors. Only the Comitia Centuriata could declare war, and ratify the results of <b>a</b> <b>census.</b> It also served as the highest court of appeal in certain judicial cases.|$|E

His remarks to his sister about Tomsk were to become notorious.|$|E
5|$|In December 1817, Edwards, {{responding}} to a movement for statehood led by his ally Daniel Pope Cook, recommended to the legislature that Illinois apply for admission to the Union. He also recommended that <b>a</b> <b>census</b> first be taken of the territory, a standard practice, but the legislature rejected this. Legislators, particularly those opposed to slavery, feared that any delay would allow Missouri to apply for statehood before Illinois, and that since Missouri was a slave state, this would cause so much turmoil in Congress that it would delay Illinois' admission even longer.|$|E
5|$|In early 1816, the Territory {{approved}} <b>a</b> <b>census</b> and Pennington {{was named}} to be the census enumerator. The population of the territory {{was found to be}} 63,897, above the cutoff required for statehood. A constitutional convention met on June 10, 1816, in Corydon. Because of the heat of the season, the delegation moved outdoors on many days and wrote the constitution beneath the shade of a giant elm tree. The state's first constitution was completed on June 29, and elections were held in August to fill the offices of the new state government. In November Congress approved statehood.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> {{national}} <b>census</b> in Germany (Volkszählung) {{was held}} {{every five years}} from 1875 to 1910.

5|$|Quantitative {{methods are}} often used to ask {{questions}} about a population that is very large, making <b>a</b> <b>census</b> or a complete enumeration of all the members in that population infeasible. A 'sample' then forms a manageable subset of a population. In quantitative research, statistics are used to draw inferences from this sample regarding the population as a whole. The process of selecting a sample is referred to as 'sampling'. While it is usually best to sample randomly, concern with differences between specific subpopulations sometimes calls for stratified sampling. Conversely, the impossibility of random sampling sometimes necessitates nonprobability sampling, such as convenience sampling or snowball sampling.|$|E
5|$|The French {{settlers}} brought {{both black}} and Indian slaves to St. Louis; although the majority were used as domestic servants, others worked as agricultural laborers. In 1769, the Spanish prohibited Indian slavery in Louisiana, but the practice was entrenched among the French Creoles in St. Louis. As a compromise, Spanish governors ended the Indian slave trade but allowed the retention of current slaves and any children born to them. In 1772, <b>a</b> <b>census</b> determined {{the population of the}} village to be 637, including 444 whites (285 males and 159 females) and 193 African slaves, with no Indian slaves reported due to their technical illegality.
