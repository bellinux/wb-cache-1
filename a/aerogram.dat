50|$|A {{letter sent}} via airmail {{may be called}} an {{aerogramme}}, <b>aerogram,</b> air letter or simply airmail letter. However, aerogramme and <b>aerogram</b> may also refer to a specific kind of airmail letter which is its own envelope; see <b>aerogram.</b>|$|E

50|$|Most <b>aerograms</b> have an {{imprinted}} stamp {{indicating the}} prepayment of postage. As such, this meets {{the definition of}} being postal stationery. However, some countries such as New Zealand, Zimbabwe and Ireland, sell unstamped <b>aerograms.</b> Unstamped <b>aerograms</b> {{are referred to as}} formular <b>aerograms</b> and can be issued by either postal authorities or by private companies. Senders are required to write their name and address on the reverse.|$|R

5000|$|On April 29, 1947, the US {{entered the}} scene with a 10 cent Air Letter Sheet. The same {{imprinted}} stamp with the propeller plane was used until updated with a jet airliner image in 1958. The US issued a total of 25 <b>aerograms</b> through 1999. The production of United States <b>aerograms</b> has ceased. Linn's Stamp News in late 2006 reported that the United States Postal Service had announced as the supply of <b>Aerograms</b> on hand at Post Offices were exhausted the stock would not be replenished. It quotes David Failor, Postal Service executive director of stamp services as explaining, [...] "Demand for these has been next to nothing {{for the past five}} years." ...|$|R

50|$|Some {{forms of}} airletter, such as <b>aerogram,</b> may forbid {{enclosure}} of other material {{so as to}} keep the weight down.|$|E
50|$|The postal {{services}} of some countries {{also offer a}} form of letter sheet called an <b>aerogram</b> consisting of a blank sheet of paper with folding instructions and adhesive flaps that becomes its own envelope, and carries prepaid postage at either the international airmail letter rate or at a special lower <b>aerogram</b> rate. Letter sheets lend themselves to airmail usage because they are lightweight. Enclosures are not permitted in aerograms. Sales of aerograms in the United States ended in 2006 due to poor sales.|$|E
50|$|Many other {{countries}} have issued <b>aerograms.</b> The United Nations Postal Administration produced its first, 10 cent, sheet on August 29, 1952, and periodically issued new ones as designs changed or postal rates increased.|$|R
50|$|The term formular (often spelled formula) is an {{adjective}} {{applied to}} envelopes, cards and <b>aerograms,</b> etc., produced by postal authorities or to their specification, but bearing no imprinted or embossed stamp or other indication of prepayment of postage.|$|R
50|$|Postal {{stationery}} {{has been}} {{produced in the}} form of postal cards, including picture postal cards, <b>aerograms,</b> inland letter sheets and -only once- a stamped envelope.

5000|$|With {{the coming}} of the Castro era, the stamps of Cuba proliferated in number. [...] Topical stamps abound, as do postal cards. About thirty <b>aerograms</b> have been produced.

50|$|Despite the {{abortive}} {{attempt to}} popularize lettersheets in 1861, two cent lettersheets {{with a picture}} of President Ulysses Grant were issued on August 18, 1886. They were last produced in 1894, but slow sales of lettersheets continued until 1902. The US has not produced any since, other than air letter sheets or <b>aerograms</b> which became available in 1947 and were likewise discontinued in 2006.|$|R
5000|$|A postal {{stationery}} airmail letter sheet, entitled [...] "Forces Letter Card", now {{commonly known as}} an <b>aerogram,</b> was made available during World War II for British military forces and a few were issued with a large St. Andrew's cross printed on the front portion of the air letter.|$|E
50|$|The <b>aerogram,</b> {{also written}} aérogramme, aerogramme, or airletter, also {{made from a}} {{lightweight}} paper, is the modern equivalent of the WWII lettersheet and most postal operators issue them prepaid, though Ireland, New Zealand and Rhodesia have issued them without an indicium requiring {{the addition of a}} postage stamp before mailing.|$|E
5000|$|A {{piece of}} postal {{stationery}} is a stationery item, {{such as a}} stamped envelope, letter sheet, postal card, lettercard, <b>aerogram</b> or wrapper, with an imprinted stamp or inscription indicating that a specific rate of postage or related service has been prepaid. [...] It does not, however, include any postcard without a pre-printed stamp.|$|E
5000|$|On 1 March 1941, the {{air mail}} service between the Middle East and the UK was started, using a {{combination}} of British Overseas Airways flying boats and military transport. The private nature of the air letter ensured its popularity among its users and that popularity, with its lightness, brought about its continued use as today's civilian air letter (<b>aerograms)</b> and the British military [...] "bluey". (see British Forces Post Office for further information).|$|R
5000|$|The terms Letter Card or Air Mail Letter Card were {{sometimes}} used on aerogrammes prior to 1952, {{the year that}} the U.P.U. gave official recognition of the word aerogramme. [...] But for <b>aerograms,</b> those terms are misleading. The {{use of the word}} [...] "card" [...] implies a heavier card stock when, in fact, many of these [...] "cards" [...] were actually printed on light paper and were letter sheets instead of letter cards.|$|R
5000|$|On August 27, 1940, de Bernardi piloted the Caproni Campini N.1 - {{sometimes}} called [...] "Caproni Campini CC.2" [...] - experimental motorjet aircraft {{on its first}} flight; the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale considered it the first successful flight of a jet aircraft until news of the August 1939 flight of the German Heinkel He 178 jet later became public. On November 30, 1941, de Bernardi flew an N.1 from Milan to Guidonia Montecelio in about two hours carrying <b>aerograms</b> with canceled postage stamps, becoming the first pilot to carry air mail in a jet aircraft.|$|R
50|$|An <b>aerogram</b> {{is related}} to a lettersheet, both being {{designed}} to have writing on the inside to minimize the weight. Any handmade envelope is effectively a lettersheet because prior to the folding stage it offers the opportunity for writing a message on that area of the sheet that after folding becomes {{the inside of the}} face of the envelope.|$|E
5000|$|In philately, an {{imprinted}} stamp is a stamp printed onto a {{piece of}} postal stationery such as a stamped envelope, postal card, letter sheet, letter card, <b>aerogram</b> or wrapper. The printing may be flat upon {{the surface of the}} paper, or embossed with a raised relief. An imprinted stamp is also known as unadhesive stamp [...] or indicium.|$|E
5000|$|In philately, a cut square is an {{imprinted}} stamp {{cut from}} {{an item of}} postal stationery such as a stamped envelope, postal card, letter sheet, letter card, <b>aerogram</b> or wrapper in a square or rectangular shape. [...] An alternative {{use of the term}} is simply any stamp, from sheets or postal stationery, cut in a square or rectangular shape and not cut to shape.|$|E
2500|$|Postal {{stationery}} are mailable products, {{issued by}} postal authorities, such as envelopes, letter sheets, postcards, lettercards, <b>aerograms</b> or wrappers, {{on which the}} amount of postage has usually been pre-printed with an imprinted stamp or indicium, at the rate required for a particular postal service. Postal stationery is generally sold at post offices. Each stationery type can be an area of study {{in its own right}} but can also be studied by country or by time period. [...] Studies of mint (unused) postal stationery are considered to be traditional philately, while studies of how postal stationery was used are considered to be postal history.|$|R
5000|$|The name, e-bluey, {{comes from}} the <b>aerograms</b> that are (still) {{provided}} for troops on active service and their families at home. Self-adhesive strips {{along the edges of}} the paper allowed it to be folded and sealed without the added weight of an envelope, meaning that more of them could be carried by air or by hand for the same total weight. Because of the blue paper these self-contained kits were inevitably known as [...] "blueys", and the name came to carry something of an emotional charge due to the significance of receiving a possibly rare bluey from a loved one. [...] "e-Bluey" [...] was thus a natural term for the BFPO's electronic hybrid mail system.|$|R
5000|$|Before 1845 {{correspondence}} was not {{enclosed in}} an envelope. Letters were folded, sealed, addressed and postmarked on the outside. This continued even after adhesive postage stamps were introduced. The popularity of folded letters led postal authorities to introduce stamped letter sheets. [...] These became {{available in the}} U.S. in 1861, but the first official postal stationery were the 1838 embossed letter sheets of New South Wales. These were followed by the Mulready stationery that was issued by Great Britain {{at the same time}} as the Penny Black in 1840. Since then, most postal services have issued a steady stream of stationery alongside stamps. Often the design of the stationery mimics the contemporaneous stamps, though with less variety and lower printing quality, due to the limitations of printing directly onto the envelope. Much later, 1947 in the U.S., letter sheets morphed into lithographed air letter sheets or <b>aerograms.</b>|$|R
