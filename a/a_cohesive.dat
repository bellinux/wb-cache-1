5|$|Argentina was {{the first}} Latin American country with a gay rights group, Nuestro Mundo (NM, or Our World), created in 1969. Six mostly secret {{organizations}} concentrating on gay or lesbian issues were founded around this time, but persecution and harassment were continuous and grew worse with the dictatorship of Jorge Rafael Videla in 1976, when all groups were dissolved in the Dirty War.

5|$|It {{was over}} {{a year before the}} 2nd Division came {{together}} as <b>a</b> <b>cohesive</b> unit and, during the interim period between formation and arrival in the United Kingdom, many changes to its organization were made.

The 4th Brigade assembled at Camp Borden in Ontario, the 5th at Valcartier Camp in Quebec, and the 6th at Camp Shilo in Manitoba. The divisional artillery was concentrated at artillery training centres at Camp Petawawa in Ontario, and at Shilo.|$|E

Along with preserved trench lines, several other memorials and cemeteries are contained within the park.|$|E
5|$|The next {{significant}} group of artists to emerge were the Scottish Colourists in the 1920s. The name was later given to four artists who {{knew each other}} and exhibited together, but did not form <b>a</b> <b>cohesive</b> group. All had spent time in France between 1900 and 1914 and all looked to Paris, particularly to the Fauvists, such as Monet, Matisse and Cézanne, whose techniques they combined with the painting traditions of Scotland. They were John Duncan Fergusson (1874–1961), Francis Cadell (1883–1937), Samuel Peploe (1871–1935) and Leslie Hunter (1877–1931). They {{have been described as}} the first Scottish modern artists and were the major mechanism by which post-impressionism reached Scotland.|$|E

5|$|Continuing the {{tradition}} {{set by the}} first game, Wipeout 3 contains electronica offerings from various artists, including The Chemical Brothers, Orbital, and the Propellerheads. Psygnosis' development manager, Enda Carey, focused on bringing together music early in the game's development cycle, instead of as an afterthought or last-minute addition to the game. Unlike previous soundtracks, Psygnosis selected a single music director, DJ Sasha, who worked with artists to create <b>a</b> <b>cohesive</b> soundtrack. Sasha included several of his own tracks made specifically for the game. The game disc is a Mixed Mode CD that allows Wipeout 3s soundtrack to be played in a standard compact disc player. To promote Wipeout 3 and its game music, Psygnosis sponsored a Global Underground tour for Sasha. Game pods featuring Wipeout 3 were placed at parties and venues, accompanied by a tie-in marketing campaign.|$|E

5|$|Critics cited Arkham Origins {{handling}} of the genesis of Batman's relationships with his adversaries and allies and its question of whether Batman's presence enhances crime in Gotham City as the game's greatest assets. Scenes with the Joker received the most praise, with Polygon saying that although {{he was also a}} central antagonist in previous Arkham games, the story shone new light on the character; GameSpot called the story surprising in its exploration of the bond and similarities between Batman and the Joker. The story was criticized for lacking <b>a</b> <b>cohesive</b> narrative (particularly the opening plot line of assassins hunting Batman, largely forgotten by the game's end), but EGM said that when it works, the story was worthy of any Batman film, TV show or comic book.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century the romantic medieval gothic style {{appeared}} as a backlash to the symmetry of Palladianism which brought certain changes to the city's appearance. Many of the new churches, for example, {{were built in the}} gothic style as were a number of new villas. Most of the new civic and retail buildings however continued to be designed in the classical mode but along much more ornamented and elborate lines than their 18th century predecessors. However virtually all the new buildings were constructed using the local bath stone so the city continued to have <b>a</b> <b>cohesive</b> look. By the middle of the 19th century, as a result of new technology, construction was able to develop incorporating steel as a building component.|$|E
5|$|The first {{significant}} group of Scottish artists {{to emerge in}} the twentieth century were the Scottish Colourists in the 1920s. The name was retrosepctively given to John Duncan Fergusson (1874–1961), Francis Cadell (1883–1937), Samuel Peploe (1871–1935) and Leslie Hunter (1877–1931). They knew each other and exhibited together, but did not form <b>a</b> <b>cohesive</b> group.

5|$|The mutual {{attraction}} {{between individual}} insects continues into adulthood, {{and they continue}} to act as <b>a</b> <b>cohesive</b> group. Individuals that get detached from a swarm fly back into the mass. Others that get left behind after feeding, take off to rejoin the swarm when it passes overhead. When individuals {{at the front of the}} swarm settle to feed, others fly past overhead and settle in their turn, the whole swarm acting like a rolling unit with an ever-changing leading edge. The locusts spend much time on the ground feeding and resting, moving on when the vegetation is exhausted. They may then fly a considerable distance before settling in a location where transitory rainfall has caused a green flush of new growth.|$|E
5|$|When Sir William Sharington {{purchased}} {{the remains of}} the Augustinian nunnery in 1540, after the dissolution, he built a country house on the cloister court. He retained the cloisters and the medieval basement largely unaltered and built another storey above, so that the main rooms are on the first floor. The house is constructed of ashlar and rubble stone, the roofs are of stone slates and there are many twisted, sixteenth century chimney stacks. The house is a blend of different styles but lacks <b>a</b> <b>cohesive</b> plan; the four wings of the house are built above the cloister passages, but the house cannot be entered from the cloisters, and the cloisters cannot be seen from inside the house. The abbey underwent substantial alterations in the Gothic Revival style in the 1750s, under the ownership of John Ivory Talbot. The great hall was redesigned during this period, the architect being Sanderson Miller.|$|E
5|$|With this {{widespread}} appeal, {{the myth}} appears in more ancient texts {{than any other}} myth and in an exceptionally broad range of Egyptian literary styles. These sources also provide an unusual amount of detail. Ancient Egyptian myths are fragmentary and vague; the religious metaphors contained within the myths were more important than coherent narration. Each text that contains a myth, or a fragment of one, may adapt the myth to suit its particular purposes, so different texts can contain contradictory versions of events. Because the Osiris myth was used in such a variety of ways, different versions often conflict with each other. Nevertheless, the fragmentary versions, taken together, give it a greater resemblance to <b>a</b> <b>cohesive</b> story than most Egyptian myths.|$|E

2500|$|Group {{cohesiveness}} {{is another}} variable {{that can affect}} the helping behaviour of a bystander. As defined by Rutkowski et al., cohesiveness refers to an established relationship (friends, acquaintances) between two or more people. Experiments have been done to test the performance of bystanders {{when they are in}} groups with people they have been acquainted with. According to Rutkowski et al., the social responsibility norm affects helping behavior. The norm of social responsibility states that [...] "people should help others who are in need of help and who are dependent on them for it." [...] As suggested by the research, the more <b>cohesive</b> <b>a</b> group, the more likely the group will act in accordance to the social responsibility norm. To test this hypothesis, researchers used undergraduate students and divided them into four groups: <b>a</b> low <b>cohesive</b> group with two people, <b>a</b> low <b>cohesive</b> group with four people, <b>a</b> high <b>cohesive</b> group with two people, and <b>a</b> high <b>cohesive</b> group with four people. Students in the high cohesive group were then acquainted with each other by introducing themselves and discussing what they liked/disliked about school and other similar topics. The point of the experiment was {{to determine whether or not}} high cohesive groups were more willing to help a hurt [...] "victim" [...] than the low cohesive groups. The four member high cohesive groups were the quickest and most likely groups to respond to the victim who they believed to be hurt. The four member low cohesive groups were the slowest and least likely to respond to the victim.|$|R
