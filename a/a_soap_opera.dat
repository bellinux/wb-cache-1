5|$|Critical {{response}} to Chad was mixed; some reviewers praised the sensationalism of the incest storyline with Whitney, while others criticized {{his relationship with}} Vincent as an irresponsible and problematic representation of racial and sexual identity. The character marks a notable step in daytime television and soap opera history; {{it was the first}} depiction in <b>a</b> <b>soap</b> <b>opera</b> of two men having sex. Chad has also been cited as expanding the representation of LGBT characters of color on daytime television. Divins discussed the storyline with his gay friends and researched LGBT culture to better shape his performance. Media outlets expressed varying opinions of the exact nature of Chad's sexual orientation.|$|E
5|$|National {{legislation}} {{requires that}} all television programmes broadcasts in Croatia {{are made in}} Croatian language or with appropriate translations either using dubbing or subtitling. In general, all foreign programming is subtitled, except for cartoons and narrated parts of documentaries and similar programmes. An attempt to change this was made by Nova TV in 2006, when <b>a</b> <b>soap</b> <b>opera</b> was dubbed, but the move provoked negative response from viewers and critics, causing the experiment to be abandoned. The legislation does not provide for mutually intelligible languages. That led to formal requests made by the Electronic Media Council demanding language localisation of television programmes made in Serbian language. Ultimately, that issue was resolved through subtitling using teletext service normally used for closed captioning.|$|E

5|$|Davies {{moved into}} writing adult {{television}} dramas in 1994. His early scripts generally explored concepts {{of religion and}} sexuality among various backdrops: Revelations was <b>a</b> <b>soap</b> <b>opera</b> about organised religion and featured a lesbian vicar; Springhill was a soap drama about a Catholic family in contemporary Liverpool; The Grand explored society's opinion of subjects such as prostitution, abortion and homosexuality during the interwar period; and Queer as Folk, his first prolific series, recreated his experiences in the Manchester gay scene. Following this, his adult series in the 2000s include Bob & Rose, which portrayed a gay man who {{fell in love with}} a woman; The Second Coming, which focused on the second coming and deicide of Jesus Christ from a mostly non-religious point of view; Mine All Mine, a comedy about a family who discover they own the entire city of Swansea; and Casanova, an adaptation of the complete memoirs of Venetian adventurer Giacomo Casanova.|$|E
5|$|During his {{production}} tenure on Children's Ward, Davies continued to seek other freelance writing jobs, particularly for soap operas; his {{intention was to}} eventually work on the popular and long-running Granada soap Coronation Street. In pursuit of this career plan, he storylined soaps such as Families and wrote scripts for shows such as Cluedo, a game show based on the board game of the same name, and Do the Right Thing, a localised version of the Brazilian panel show Você Decide with Terry Wogan as presenter and Frank Skinner as a regular panellist. One writing job, for The House of Windsor, <b>a</b> <b>soap</b> <b>opera</b> about footmen in Buckingham Palace, was so poorly received that his other scripts for the show would be written under the pseudonym Leo Vaughn.|$|E
5|$|The third {{series of}} Cold Feet (2000) was {{extended}} {{from six to}} eight episodes by ITV. Bullen believed that the production team had covered all potential storylines {{in the first two}} series, so declined to write any more episodes. A team of five writers was hired by Granada Television, overseen by Bullen as a co-executive producer. Four out of the five writers left the team due to their scripts not being appropriate for the series, leaving only David Nicholls on staff. The writing process had made Bullen think twice about not writing and he began thinking about further storylines, such as mid-life crises and IVF. The same year, he signed a two-year contract with Granada to develop new projects. A fourth series of Cold Feet, also of eight episodes, was commissioned for 2001. Bullen announced {{that he did not want}} to write a fifth series, and that the fourth would be the last. His reasons were that with ITV's proposed commission of up to 20 episodes a year, the series would become like <b>a</b> <b>soap</b> <b>opera.</b> The popularity of the fourth series persuaded Bullen to write four more episodes that formed the fifth series in 2003. The fifth series won Bullen the Writer of the Year Award at the 2003 British Comedy Awards.|$|E
