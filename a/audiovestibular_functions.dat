40|$|Menière's {{disease is}} a chronic {{condition}} with a prevalence of 200 - 500 per 100, 000 and characterized by episodic attacks of vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, aural pressure and a progressive loss of <b>audiovestibular</b> <b>functions.</b> Over 150 years ago, Prosper Menière {{was the first to}} recognize the inner ear as the site of lesion for this clinical syndrome. Over 75 years ago, endolymphatic hydrops was discovered as the pathologic correlate of Menière's disease. However, this pathologic finding could be ascertained only in post-mortem histologic studies. Due to this diagnostic dilemma and the variable manifestation of the various audiovestibular symptoms, diagnostic classification systems based on clinical findings have been repeatedly modified and have not been uniformly used in scientific publications on Menière's disease. Furthermore, the higher level measures of impact on quality of life such as vitality and social participation have been neglected hitherto. Recent developments of high-resolution MR imaging of the inner ear have now enabled us to visualize in vivo endolymphatic hydrops in patients with suspected Menière's disease. In this review, we summarize the existing knowledge from temporal bone histologic studies and from the emerging evidence on imaging-based evaluation of patients with suspected Menière's disease. These indicate that endolymphatic hydrops is responsible not only for the full-blown clinical triad of simultaneous attacks of auditory and vestibular dysfunction, but also for other clinical presentations such as "vestibular" and "cochlear Menière's disease". As a consequence, we propose a new terminology which is based on symptomatic and imaging characteristics of these clinical entities to clarify and simplify their diagnostic classification...|$|E
40|$|The {{three most}} common {{vestibular}} diseases, {{benign paroxysmal positional vertigo}} (BPPV), Meniere's disease (MD) and vestibular neuritis (VN), {{are presented in}} this paper. BPPV, which is the most common peripheral vestibular disorder, can be defined as transient vertigo induced by a rapid head position change, associated with a characteristic paroxysmal positional nystagmus. Canalolithiasis of the posterior semicircular canal is considered the most convincing theory of its pathogenesis and the development of appropriate therapeutic maneuvers resulted in its effective treatment. However, involvement of the horizontal or the anterior canal has been found in a significant rate and the recognition and treatment of these variants completed the clinical picture of the disease. MD is a chronic condition characterized by episodic attacks of vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, aural pressure and a progressive loss of <b>audiovestibular</b> <b>functions.</b> Presence of endolymphatic hydrops on postmortem examination is its pathologic correlate. MD continues to be a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Patients with the disease range from minimally symptomatic, highly functional individuals to severely affected, disabled patients. Current management strategies are designed to control the acute and recurrent vestibulopathy but offer minimal remedy for the progressive cochlear dysfunction. VN is {{the most common cause of}} acute spontaneous vertigo, attributed to acute unilateral loss of vestibular function. Key signs and symptoms are an acute onset of spinning vertigo, postural imbalance and nausea as well as a horizontal rotatory nystagmus beating towards the non-affected side, a pathological headimpulse test and no evidence for central vestibular or ocular motor dysfunction. Vestibular neuritis preferentially involves the superior vestibular labyrinth and its afferents. Symptomatic medication is indicated only during the acute phase to relieve the vertigo and nausea/vomiting. Vestibular rehabilitation hastens the recovery. The efficacy of topical and systemic steroids requires further validation...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} done to assess the safety of {{gentamicin}} administration by a bolus method. A total of 63 patients were randomly treated with intravenous gentamicin by bolus administration (3 to 5 min) and by slow infusion (2 h). Serum gentamicin levels were measured. Renal and <b>audiovestibular</b> <b>function</b> were monitored. Pure-tone audiometry was performed at the beginning, on day 3, {{and at the end}} of therapy. The study revealed that the bolus administration was safe and nontoxic...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} whether the saccule exhibits temporary or permanent functional loss resembling threshold shifts in auditory brainstem response (ABR) of guinea pigs following noise exposure. Design: Randomly bred guinea pigs {{were divided into}} 3 groups: A (short-term noise exposure, 30 minutes, n= 15), B (long-termnoise exposure, 40 hours, n= 9), and C (no noise exposure, n= 5). Setting: University hospital. Main OutcomeMeasures: All animals underwent ves-tibular-evokedmyogenic potential (VEMP) andABR tests. Chronological changes of VEMP and ABR responses fol-lowing noise exposure were analyzed and compared. Af-ter <b>audiovestibular</b> <b>function</b> testing, animalswere killed for morphological study with light and electron microscopy...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Vestibular schwannomas (VS) are benign tumours of the {{vestibular}} nerve {{and can lead}} to hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, facial palsy, and brainstem compression. Audiovestibular diagnostic tests are essential for detection and treatment planning. Methods. Medline was used to perform a systematic literature review with regard to how audiovestibular test parameters correlate with symptoms, tumour size, and tumour location. Results. The auditory brainstem response can be used to diagnose retrocochlear lesions caused by VS. Since hearing loss correlates poorly with tumour size, a retrocochlear lesion is probably not the only cause for hearing loss. Also cochlear mechanisms seem to play a role. This can be revealed by abnormal otoacoustic emissions, despite normal ABR and new MRI techniques which have demonstrated endolymphatic hydrops of the inner ear. Caloric and head impulse tests show frequency specific dynamics and vestibular evoked myogenic potentials may help to identify the location of the tumour regarding the involved nerve parts. Conclusion. In order to preserve <b>audiovestibular</b> <b>function</b> in VS, it is important to stop the growth of the tumour and to avoid degenerative changes in the inner ear. A detailed neurotological workup helps to diagnose VS of all sizes and can also provide useful prognostic information...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} {{this thesis is about}} investigation of the two less well understood mechanisms of balance system, namely utricular function and interactions of visual and vestibular system. Utricules are part of otolith apparatus and sense linear acceleration including gravity and lateral head tilts. Recent advances in rotational technology allow robust methods of assessment of unilateral utricular function using centrifugation techniques. Unilateral centrifugation generates substantial linear acceleration and the utricular response can be measured via tilt perception using subjective visual vertical (chapter 2). Utricular function was studied in common vestibular disorders seen in clinics, like chronic vestibular neuritis, benign positional paroxysmal vertigo, unilateral Ménière’s disease, migraine and bilateral vestibular hypofunction. Bilateral vestibular hypofunction produced significantly low utricular gain (chapter 3). A detailed study of the utricular function of larger group of unilateral Ménière’s disease showed significantly greater utricular asymmetry and lower utricular gain than normal controls. Interestingly, hearing loss was a predictor of utricular asymmetry (chapter 4). There was poor correlation between subjective measures and <b>audiovestibular</b> <b>function.</b> The chronic course of Ménière’s disease is well known with slow decline over years and absence of correlation between symptoms and function may point to ‘burn out’ as long term phenomenon (chapter 5). An investigation into visual dependence and vertigo was performed to understand the effect of visual dependence on tilt perception in chronic vertigo. Individuals with vestibular symptoms can have increased visual dependency and migraineurs can have a non-adaptable increase in visual dependency (chapter 6). In summary, we found that the unilateral centrifugation is a safe and well tolerated technique and provides additional, potentially useful information about utricular function. In future, the study of utricular function during acute phases of vertigo will further help overall understanding of otolith pathophysiology and mechanisms used for compensation. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|Migraine can be conceptualised as a {{disorder}} of sensory processing, manifest by such symptoms as headache (pain), phonophobia and photophobia. Current models of migraine pathophysiology incorporate {{a significant role}} for the brainstem. Vestibular migraine (VM) is a subtype of the disorder in which significant brainstem dysfunction has been documented. The condition {{is known to have}} a significant effect on mental health. This study was designed to investigate disturbances in <b>audiovestibular</b> brainstem <b>function</b> in vestibular migraine in a four part study: 1. Otoacoustic emission suppression by contralateral noise, a test of auditory efferent pathway function, was measured in a group of 33 VM patients and compared with 31 healthy controls. Regression analysis showed a higher rate of abnormality amongst the VM group (p= 0. 03). 2. Vestibular evoked myogenic potentials were recorded in a group of 30 VM patients and compared with 35 healthy controls. Recordings showed a higher rate of abnormal responses in the VM group than amongst controls (p= 0. 008). 3. The potential for vestibular stimuli to act as migraine triggers was investigated by observing the effect of vestibular testing or a control condition on 148 individuals. Vestibular stimulation was associated with a significant increase in the probability of developing a migraine attack over the following 24 hour period (p= 0. 01). 4. Psychological symptoms of depression and anxiety were assessed using questionnaires 39 patients with VM and compared with a control group of 44 patients with dizziness of other causes. Although the VM group had a significantly higher load of symptoms of depression and anxiety, regression modelling showed that this effect was largely accounted for by an excess of dizziness symptoms. In conclusion, this study documents a number of audiovestibular sensory processing abnormalities using a variety of techniques. Vestibular migraine has a significant effect on psychological wellbeing, largely via the associated balance symptoms...|$|R
