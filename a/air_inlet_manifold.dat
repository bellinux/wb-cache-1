We have applied this kind of connection equipment on gas engine which has no PCV.

S., Mechanical Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2012 Fuel {{combustion}} {{inside the}} cylinder of an engine is greatly {{affected by the}} mixing {{of the air and}} the fuel. Better mixing leads to more efficient combustion. There {{has been a lot of}} research in the past to improve the mixing of air fuel mixture in the engine. Better mixing can be achieved by modifying the designs of <b>inlet</b> <b>manifold</b> or piston head grove etc. In this Thesis the focus is on <b>inlet</b> <b>manifold.</b> This thesis compares three designs of <b>inlet</b> <b>manifold</b> for combustion efficiency achieved by them. Those designs are helical <b>inlet</b> <b>manifold,</b> spiral <b>inlet</b> <b>manifold,</b> helical-spiral <b>inlet</b> <b>manifold.</b> 			Star CCM+ is used as a tool to model these three <b>inlet</b> <b>manifold</b> designs, cylinder and a piston. Same tool is used to do the analysis for combustion efficiency using some boundary conditions. Stoichiometric equation was given to the program to do the calculations. CO, CO 2, NO, H 2, N 2, H 20, temperature and pressure were chosen as the results that the program should give out once the calculation is done. The comparison of these results for all the three designs would recommend the best design among three designs of <b>inlet</b> <b>manifolds.</b> 			When compared, among three, Helical-Spiral <b>inlet</b> <b>manifold</b> design stood the best. It had the fewer amounts of Carbon Monoxide, more Carbon Di-oxide and more Nitrous Oxide. Having more Nitrous Oxide in the exhaust gases is contradicting the thesis; however the reasons and remedies for that problem are addressed in the conclusions section. Also Helical-Spiral design had higher pressure and temperatures generated inside the cylinder than other two designs. So Helical-Spiral <b>inlet</b> <b>manifold</b> design is suggested as the best design among the three. Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|Great {{improvements}} {{have been}} made in engine performance and emission control due to recent intensive research on engine systems. Further improvements are still required and turbocharging is aiding further improvements in emissions, power and downsizing. Turbocharged vehicles, however, exhibit a weak point of poor drivability under transient running conditions. This poor drivability has a detrimental affect on the engines emission output during the transient phase. Various methods are being researched to improve transient performance of turbocharged engine systems. This study analyses the effectiveness of injecting <b>air</b> into the <b>inlet</b> <b>manifold</b> and the compressor at improving the transient performance of a turbocharged diesel engine when performing rapid load changes. The paper expands upon previous work carried out which demonstrates the potential of the system. Computer simulations have been used to analyse the transient engine performance including the drive train. The transient engine models have been developed to analyse the transient engine performance with various injection strategies. The air injection system was modelled by injecting air into the plenum on the intake manifold and using an additional torque on the compressor wheel. The injection pressure was set at a pressure of 3 bar, which is in commonly used range. The valve and additional compressor torque were programmed to activate at the same instant that the transient regime begins. To assess the effectiveness of the air injection strategies at improving the transient response of the engine the load step simulation was undertaken. During the simulations the air was injected either into the <b>inlet</b> <b>manifold,</b> compressor or both manifold and compressor also known as two point injection. A parametric study has been undertaken analysing vehicle speed, outlet pressure of the compressor, turbine inlet temperature and driver demand. It has been observed that the air injection systems improve the transient response of the turbocharger and the overall performance of the engine. The vehicle speed response {{has been shown to be}} greatly improved, with the time required for the engine to reach 30 kph when air injection is used, reduced by 71...|$|R

The influences of the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature and velocity on the air outlet temperature and heat transfer rate were investigated The <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature used for the solidification of RT 25 were 10 °C, 12 °C and 14 °C and for the melting 34 °C, 36 °C and 38 °C. The selected <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> velocities were {{the same for the}} melting and solidification process: 0. 5 m/s, 1. 4 m/s and 2. 5 m/s. The results suggest that an increase of the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> velocity reduces linearly the temperature difference between the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> and outlet for the solidification process of the RT 25.

40|$|International audienceWith {{the gradual}} {{depletion}} of petroleum and environmental degradation, intensive research activity has been {{addressed to the}} utilization of alternative fuels in internal combustion engines. In the present work, an experimental investigation is carried out to study the effect of eucalyptus biodiesel and natural gas under dual fuel combustion mode on the performance and the exhaust emissions of a single cylinder DI diesel engine. The natural gas (NG) is inducted with the intake <b>air</b> through the <b>inlet</b> <b>manifold.</b> The liquid pilot fuel (eucalyptus biodiesel or diesel fuel) is injected into the combustion chamber to cover approximately 10 % of the maximum power output. Then, keeping constant the pilot fuel flow rate, the power output is further increased using only natural gas. The combustion characteristics (cylinder pressure, ignition delay and heat release rate), performance and exhaust emissions of the dual fuel mode (NG-diesel fuel and NG-biodiesel) are {{compared with those of}} conventional diesel engine mode at various load conditions. The combustion analysis has shown that biodiesel as pilot fuel exhibits similar pressure-time history, with highest peak, as diesel fuel in conventional and dual fuel modes. The performance and pollutant emission results show that, compared to diesel fuel in dual fuel mode, the use of eucalyptus biodiesel as pilot fuel reduces the high emission levels of unburned hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) particularly at high engine loads. However this is accompanied by an increase in the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and the nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, which {{can be explained by the}} lower calorific value and the oxygen presence in the molecule of the eucalyptus biodiesel, respectively.

The increase of the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> velocity reduced the charging and discharging time, however not linearly. The time for the complete melting and solidification is substantially reduced when the velocity has been increased from 0. 6 m/s to 1. 6 m/s.
