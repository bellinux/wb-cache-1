Here we study two massive famines that struck France between 1693 and 1710, killing over two million people. In both cases the impact of harvest failure was exacerbated by wartime demands on the food supply; we ask whether the crises were exacerbated yet further by a failure of markets to function {{as they did in}} normal times. The evidence, we conclude, is most consistent with the view that markets in fact helped alleviate these crises, albeit modestly. <b>Aujourd</b> <b>hui</b> ces mati res paraissent d une telle aridit qu elles provoquent le vide, m me au sein du parlement, si par hasard on les y discute On ne voit plus des carts de prix comparables ceux des grandes ann es de famine de la fin du r gne de Louis XIV: 1693 et 1709.

Prajñāraśmi was {{the author}} of the classification of the Eight great chariots of the practice lineages (Sgrub brgyud shing rta chen po brgyad) widely known through the nonsectarian (ris med) movement. He had an exceptionally eclectic itinerary within the different Buddhist orders when Tibet suffered from civil wars and sectarian conflicts. As a revealer (gter ston), he founded the Rnying ma monastery of Dpal ri theg chen gling in the Phyong rgyas valley and made a major revision and edition of the Padma thang yig. The now forgotten Dpal ri monastery formed a precedent for the great Rnying ma renaissance that occurred during the reign of the Vth Dalai Lama.

Recently, we used a targeted metabolomics approach using mass spectrometry and NMR to identify changes in the metabolic profile of wild type and mutants in the flagellar glycosylation locus, characterize novel metabolites, and assign function to genes to define the pseudaminic acid biosynthetic pathway in Campylobacter jejuni 81 - 176 (McNally, D. <b>J.,</b> <b>Hui,</b> <b>J.</b> P., Aubry, A.

In this study, we use a similar approach to further define the glycome and metabolomic complement of nucleotide-activated sugars in Campylobacter coli VC 167. Herein we demonstrate that, in addition to CMP-pseudaminic acid, C. coli VC 167 also produces two structurally distinct nucleotide-activated nonulosonate sugars that were observed as negative ions at m/z 637 and m/z 651 (CMP- 315 and CMP- 329). Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry yielded suitable amounts of the pure sugar nucleotides for NMR spectroscopy using a cold probe. Structural analysis in conjunction with molecular modeling identified the sugar moieties as acetamidino and N-methylacetimidoyl derivatives of legionaminic acid (Leg 5 Am 7 Ac and Leg 5 AmNMe 7 Ac). Targeted metabolomic analyses of isogenic mutants established a role for the ptmA-F genes and defined two new ptm genes in this locus as legionaminic acid biosynthetic enzymes.

40|$|Un problème relationnel évident entre l Eglise Catholique et les Média constituait le point de départ de cette thèse de doctorat. Des membres de l Eglise se plaignent à répétition de la machinerie des Média et leur préférence pour les scandales et des accroches négatives. La {{critique}} est que l image de l Eglise créée par les Média ne correspond pas à la réalité, les aspects positifs sont souvent ignorés. Mais de quelle façon les Média représentent effectivement l Eglise ? La thèse répond à cette question en démontrant les conditions de communication médiatiques ainsi qu en décrivant l image de l Eglise dans les discours journalistiques. The {{relationship between}} the Catholic Church and the media is apparently difficult. Members of the church frequently complain about the media s partiality for scandals and negative headlines. The Catholic Church, they say, is portrayed in an excessively bad light, while positive aspects are overlooked. But how does the press actually write about the Church? By illustrating media-related terms of communication and characterizing the Church s image in press-discourse, the current thesis answers this question. On the assumption that impartial reality is not available and therefore not illustratable, news coverage never reflects reality, but reconstructs it. Reality as transported by the media is affected by ideas about life and moral concepts not only by journalists, but also by editorial boards, cultures and other media-related terms of communication. Thereby, and through factors influencing the selection of news, e. g. focussing on hot potatoes and bad news, coverage of the Church turns out one-sided and negative. This thesis is, on the one hand, a media-linguistic investigation, but also uses an interdisciplinary approach by drawing upon knowledge of linguistic sub-disciplines {{as well as of}} media- and communication science. In 2009, a sample of 212 articles of Austrian and French daily newspapers was investigated by means of Inhaltsanalyse (content analysis) following Werner Früh and Kritischer Diskursanalyse (critical discourse analysis) following Siegfried Jäger. The articles (Austria: Die Presse, Der Standard, Kronen Zeitung; France: <b>Aujourd</b> <b>hui</b> en France, Le Figaro, Le Monde) were reviewed with regard to content, topic and language. Only such articles were chosen, which were information- and opinion-centred and in line with the editorial board. Additionally, journalists of the mentioned newspapers were interviewed to gain information on the coverage of religious issues and the attitude of the editorial staff towards the Catholic Church. The content analysis was, on the one hand, aimed at the classification of reported topics. On the other hand, news factors should be identified, which were relevant for the selected events. Finally, the content analysis should gain information on to what extent topic structure and distribution of news factors differed between the newspapers. The discourse analysis particularly aimed at classifying content and language of explicit and implicit comments in the articles. In addition, linguistic characteristics of coverage of the Catholic Church should be identified, as far as they allowed conclusions to be drawn with respect to underlying ideologies. Finally, press photos should be analysed in terms of ideological and evaluative contents. Comparison of the different newspapers should permit to trace the individual editorial staff s principles and identify country-and culture-specific differences, as the relationship between state and church is regulated differently. While in France there is a very strict disestablishment of state and church (Laizism), in Austria there is a system of cooperation, which is founded in a concordat. This thesis shows, that all of the reviewed daily newspapers consider the topic Catholic Church as socio-politically relevant. At the same time, no consistent disapproval of the Church by means of the media was visible. This becomes evident by the quite extensive and frequent coverage that expands for example into the rubric politics. Furthermore, all of the reviewed newspapers had one journalist being in charge of topics concerning catholic matters, and who was socialised in - and in many cases - is close to the Church [...] PARIS 5 -Bibliotheque electronique (751069902) / SudocSudocFranceF...|$|R
40|$|Grace aux récents développements des {{technologies}} d intégration, il est <b>aujourd</b> <b>hui</b> possible d envisager la réalisation de circuits et systèmes intégrés sur Silicium fonctionnant à des fréquences auparavant inatteignables. Par conséquence, depuis quelques années, on assiste à la naissance de nouvelles applications en bande millimétrique, comme {{la communication}} sans fil à haut-débit à 60 GHz, les radars automobiles à 76 - 77 et 79 - 82 GHz, et l imagerie millime trique à 94 GHz. Cette thèse vise, en premier lieu, à la définition d une méthodologie de conception des circuits intégrés en bande millimétrique. Elle est {{par la suite}} validée au travers de son application à la conception des amplificateurs faible-bruit en technologie BiCMOS SiGe. Dans ce contexte, une attention particulière a été portée au développement d une stratégie de conception et de modélisation des inductances localisées. Plusieurs exemples d amplificateurs faible-bruit ont été réalisés, à un ou deux étages, employant des composants inductifs localisés ou distribués, à 60, 80 et 94 GHz. Tous ces circuits présentent des caractéristiques au niveau de l état de l art dans le domaine, ainsi en confirmant l exactitude de la méthodologie de conception et son efficacité sur toute la planche de fréquence considérée. En outre, la réalisation d un récepteur intégré pour applications automobiles à 80 GHz est aussi décrite comme exemple d une possible application système, ainsi que la co-intégration d un amplificateur faible-bruit avec une antenne patch millimétrique intégrée sur Silicium. The interest towards millimeter waves has rapidly grown up {{during the last few}} years, leading {{to the development of a}} large number of potential applications in the millimeter wave band, such as WPANs and high data rate wireless communications at 60 GHz, short and long range radar at 77 - 79 GHz, and imaging systems at 94 GHz. Furthermore, the high frequency performances of silicon active devices (bipolar and CMOS) have dramatically increased featuring both fT and fmax close or even higher than 200 GHz. As a consequence, modern silicon technologies can now address the demand of low-cost and high-volume production of systems and circuits operating within the millimeter wave range. Nevertheless, millimeter wave design still requires special techniques and methodologies to overcome a large number of constraints which appear along with the augmentation of the operative frequency. The aim of this thesis is to define a design methodology for integrated circuits operating at millimeter wave and to provide an experimental validation of the methodology, as exhaustive as possible, focusing on the design of low noise amplifiers (LNAs) as a case of study. Several examples of LNAs, operating at 60, 80, and 94 GHz, have been realized. All the tested circuits exhibit performances in the state of art. In particular, a good agreement between measured data and post-layout simulations has been repeatedly observed, demonstrating the exactitude of the proposed design methodology and its reliability over the entire millimeter wave spectrum. A particular attention has been addressed to the implementation of inductors as lumped devices and in order to evaluate the benefits of the lumped design two versions of a single-stage 80 GHz LNA have been realized using, respectively, distributed transmission lines and lumped inductors. The direct comparison of these circuits has proved that the two design approaches have the same potentialities. As a matter of fact, design based on lumped inductors instead of distributed elements is to be preferred, since it has the valuable advantage of a significant reduction of the circuit dimensions. Finally, the design of an 80 GHz front-end and the co-integration of a LNA with an integrated antenna are also considered, opening the way to the implementation a fully integrated receiver.

40|$|Background: Numerous {{areas of}} the human genome have {{previously}} been associated with asthma and asthma-related phenotypes, but few positive findings have been successfully replicated in independent populations. Initial studies have reported strong associations of variants in the plant homeodomain zinc finger protein 11 (PHF 11) gene with serum IgE levels, asthma, airway hyper-responsiveness and childhood atopic dermatitis. Objectives: To investigate the association of variants in the PHF 11 gene with asthma and associated intermediate phenotypes in two independent Western Australian population-based samples. Methods: A linkage-disequilibrium (LD) -tagging set of 20 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was genotyped in PHF 11 in two separate populations (total n =  2315), a family-based twin study consisting of 230 families (n =  992 subjects) and a population-based nested case-control study consisting of 617 asthma cases and 706 controls. Information regarding asthma, respiratory physiology, atopy and environmental exposures was collected. Transmission disequilibrium tests, variance components models and generalised linear models were used to test for association between PHF 11 SNPs and selected asthma outcomes (including longitudinal change in lung function). Results: After correction for multiple testing, no statistically significant (p< 0. 05) associations were found between PHF 11 and either asthma or total serum IgE levels in either population. No statistically significant associations were found with any other asthma-associated phenotypes in either population. Conclusions: Previously reported associations of PHF 11 with asthma outcomes were not replicated in this study. This study suggests that PHF 11 is unlikely to contain polymorphic loci that {{have a major impact on}} asthma susceptibility in our populations.

A cross-sectional survey of an age-stratified random general population sample of 1, 969 adults from the electoral register of Busselton (Australia) was performed in 2005 – 2007. Respiratory symptoms, DDA ever, DDB ever, recent wheezing and smoking history, together with anthropometric measurements, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) and forced vital capacity (FVC), methacholine challenge or bronchodilator response, exhaled nitric oxide (eNO), skin-prick tests to common allergens, and blood eosinophil and neutrophil counts were studied. Cluster analysis (variables sex, age, atopy, FEV 1 % predicted, FEV 1 /FVC, airway hyperresponsiveness, eNO, log eosinphil count, log neutrophil count and body mass index) was used to identify phenotypic patterns. Seven clusters (subjects with DDA and DDB, respectively) were identified: normal males (n= 467; 7 and 13 %), normal females (n= 477; 12 and 18 %), obese females (n= 250; 16 and 28 %), atopic younger adults (n= 330; 21 and 17 %), atopic adults with high eNO (n= 130; 30 and 25 %), atopic males with reduced FEV 1 (n= 103; 33 and 32 %) and atopic adults with bronchial hyperreactivity (n= 212; 40 and 26 %).

As a consequence, targeted therapy based on screening of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is necessary. Spinal cord metastasis of lung cancer is a serious clinical problem. Here, we report a case of lung adenocarcinoma with severe spinal cord metastasis that was successfully treated with a second administration of an EGFR-TKI. Magnetic resonance imaging showed spinal cord metastasis to the cervical vertebrae. The patient received a second administration of an EGFR-TKI (150  mg/day erlotinib). Four months later, we observed {{the disappearance of the}} paravertebral tumor and a reduction in the size of pulmonary tumors in both lungs. These results indicate that EGFR-TKI therapy could be a new strategy for the treatment of advanced lung adenocarcinoma with spinal metastasis.

40|$|Dans la pensée contemporaine (tous {{domaines}} confondus), le traditionnel problème du fondement a disparu. Et cela à juste titre : les plus importants résultats <b>aujourd</b> <b>hui</b> ont été obtenus, en effet, sans passer par une hypostase méthodologique que le concept de fondement impose à la pensée. La phénoménologie, plus que toute autre approche, semble avoir accompli ce processus; pour ce faire, cependant, elle a gardé un vocabulaire souvent ambigu; voire, elle s est réclamée expressément comme étant au fondement des sciences. Notre travail trouve son point de départ, dans {{la philosophie}} d inspiration phénoménologique de Michel Henry. Elle permet de penser un fondement sans passer par la violence d un maître-mot, et simultanément sans passer par le dogme d une théorie où le fondement porterait à une réaffirmation des dualismes, lui-même hypostasié (comme être par exemple). Pour Henry, le fondement, comme ce qui est sans condition, est l apparaître de quelque chose. À son tour, il se dit comme une condition absolue de tout ce qui se manifeste, comme une force de manifestation de l être. Mais le chemin vers un fondement s avère difficile, puisqu il n existe pas de thématisation de ce concept chez Henry, ni de possibilité de concept de fondement dans le dire le phénomène, dans un langage qui doit, pour se dire fondamental, exprimer l immédiateté de la manifestation en tant que telle, une manifestation qui se dise elle-même sans avoir recours à une référence externe. Peu importe la manière, le fondement doit lui-même bâtir sa propre problématique. Le phénomène du fondement représente, à travers un parcours aux limites de la philosophie, à la fois théorétique, empirico-transcendantale et expérimental, la tentative de penser le fondement comme ce qui se manifeste et, sans médiation, manifeste une altérité finalement comprise à partir d une immanence irréductible. In contemporary thinking (all fields included), the traditional {{problem of the}} foundation has disappeared. Rightfully: the most important results today have been obtained, in fact, without going through a methodological hypo-stasis {{that the concept of}} foundation imposes to the thought. Phenomenology, more than any other approach, seems to have been through this process; for doing so, however, it kept a vocabulary often ambiguous; it even claimed it specifically as the foundation of science. Our work finds its starting point, in the phenomenological philosophy of Michel Henry. It suggests a basis without going through the violence of a master word, and simultaneously bypassing the dogma of a theory in which the foundation would be a reaffirmation of dualism, itself an hypo-stasis (as the "being", for example). For Henry, the foundation, understood as what is unconditional, is the appearing of something. Thus he says as an absolute condition that manifests itself as a force of manifestation of being. But the path to one foundation is difficult, since there is no theming of this concept in Henry, and no possibility of concept basis in the to say the The phenomenon of foundation.

The phenomenon is the basis, through a journey to the limits of philosophy, theoretical, empirico-transcendental and experimental, trying to understand of the foundation as what is manifest and without mediation, manifest otherness finally understood from an irreducible immanence.
