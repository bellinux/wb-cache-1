40|$|SummaryBackgroundPrior {{studies suggest}} that obesity may cause asthma. Obesity and asthma are {{prevalent}} in low-income urban neighborhoods, but the impact of obesity on asthma in such neighborhoods has not been examined. MethodsThe New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene surveyed 6119 adults age 18 – 54 years in 2002. Obesity was defined as body mass index≥ 30 kg/m 2 and current asthma as physician diagnosed asthma plus recent symptoms. We calculated prevalence (risk) differences (RD) and population <b>attributable</b> <b>risk</b> <b>percents</b> (PAR%). ResultsObese individuals had a 2. 0 % (95 % CI: 0. 5 %, 3. 6 %; p= 0. 01) higher risk of current asthma than normal weight individuals overall. Obesity was more common in low-income neighborhoods compared with middle-to-upper-income neighborhoods (23 % vs. 14 %, p< 0. 001), as was current asthma (6 % vs. 4 %, respectively, p= 0. 02). The risk of current asthma associated with obesity was similar in low-income (RD: 1. 3 %, 95 % CI: − 1. 5 %, 4. 0 %; p= 0. 36) and middle-to-upper-income neighborhoods (RD: 2. 0 %, 95 % CI: 0. 1 %, 3. 9 %; p= 0. 04). The PAR% for asthma due to obesity was not greater in low-income (7. 3 %) than in middle-to-upper-income neighborhoods (7. 7 %).

40|$|Abstract Background Estrogen/progestin {{replacement}} therapy (EPRT), alcohol consumption, physical activity, and breast-feeding duration differ from other {{factors associated with}} breast cancer in being immediately modifiable by the individual, thereby representing attractive targets for future breast cancer prevention efforts. To justify such efforts, {{it is vital to}} quantify the potential population-level impacts on breast cancer considering population variations in behavior prevalence, risk estimate, and baseline incidence. Methods For each of these four factors, we calculated population <b>attributable</b> <b>risk</b> <b>percents</b> (PARs) using population-based survey (2001) and cancer registry data (1998 – 2002) for 41 subpopulations of white, non-Hispanic California women aged 40 – 79 years, and ranges of relative risk (RR) estimates from the literature. Results Using a single RR estimate, subpopulation PARs ranged from 2. 5 % to 5. 6 % for hormone use, from 0. 0 % to 6. 1 % for recent consumption of >= 2 alcoholic drinks daily, and 4. 6 % to 11. 0 % for physical inactivity. Using a range of RR estimates, PARs were 2 – 11 % for EPRT use, 1 – 20 % for alcohol consumption and 2 – 15 % for physical inactivity. Subpopulation data were unavailable for breastfeeding, but PARs using published RR estimates ranged from 2 % to 11 % for lifetime breastfeeding >= 31 months. Thus, of 13, 019 breast cancers diagnosed annually in California, as many as 1, 432 attributable to EPRT use, 2, 604 attributable to alcohol consumption, 1, 953 attributable to physical inactivity, and 1, 432 attributable to never breastfeeding might be avoidable. Conclusion The relatively feasible lifestyle changes of discontinuing EPRT use, reducing alcohol consumption, increasing physical activity, and lengthening breastfeeding duration could lower population breast cancer incidence substantially. </p...|$|R

The relatively high prevalence of cocaine use in the US population, especially in younger individuals, mandates a more extensive investigation of this relationship. Methods: We determined the relationship between cocaine use and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in a nationally representative sample of 9013 US adults aged 18 to 45 years who participated in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Mortality Follow-up Study using Cox proportional haz-ards analyses. We categorized the participants as nonusers if they responded to the lifetime cocaine use question as never used, as infrequent users if they responded as using 100 times, respectively. Potential confounding factors in the association between cocaine use and death (cardiovascular and all cause) included age, sex, race/ethnicity, cigarette smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, educational attainment, body mass index, and insurance status.

40|$|Objectives: We {{aimed to}} {{determine}} risk {{factors associated with}} Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and assess the contributions of these factors on CDI burden. Methods: We conducted a 1 : 4 matched case-control study using a national claims dataset. Cases were incident CDI without a history of CDI in the previous 84 days, and were age- and sex-matched with control patients. We ascertained exposure, defined as a history of morbidities and drug use within 90 days. The population <b>attributable</b> <b>risk</b> (PAR) <b>percent</b> for <b>risk</b> factors was estimated using odds ratios (ORs) obtained from the case-control study. Results: Overall, the strongest CDI-associated risk factors, which have significant contributions to the CDI burden as well, were the experience of gastroenteritis (OR =  5. 08, PAR% =  17. 09 %) and use of antibiotics (OR =  1. 69, PAR% =  19. 00 %), followed by the experiences of female pelvic infection, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and pneumonia, and use of proton-pump inhibitors (OR =  1. 52 – 2. 37, PAR% =  1. 95 – 2. 90). Conclusions: The control of risk factors that had strong association with CDI and affected large proportions of total CDI cases would be beneficial for CDI prevention.

This multicentre matched case-control study examined the chewing areca nut alone, betel quid with tobacco, oral snuff (snuff dipping) and cigarette smoking as the risk factors for oesophageal squamous-cell carcinoma. We enrolled 91 cases of oesophageal squamous-cell carcinoma and 364 matched controls from three tertiary-care hospitals in Karachi, Pakistan. A structured questionnaire was used to collect the data through face-to-face interview of the participants. Multivariable conditional logistic regression model showed that after adjusting for the effect of ethnicity, ever chewed areca nut alone (adjusted matched odds ratio (mOR(adj)) = 3. 7, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 6 - 8. 5), ever chewed betel quid with tobacco (mOR(adj) = 12. 8, 95 % CI: 6. 3 - 26. 2), ever practiced snuff dipping (mOR(adj) = 4. 3, 95 % CI: 1. 6 - 11. 7) and ever smoked cigarettes (mOR(adj) = 2. 9, 95 % CI: 1. 4 - 5. 9) were significantly and independently associated with oesophageal squamous-cell carcinoma status. The adjusted summary population <b>attributable</b> <b>risk</b> (PAR) <b>percent</b> for all four substances together was 67. 0.

These drugs are commonly used in inpatient medical therapeutics. Since population attributable risk (PAR) is generally related both to strength of association and to the frequency of exposure to a risk factor, the PAR of depressive symptoms associated with these drug exposures is potentially high.

40|$|The <b>attributable</b> <b>risk,</b> {{often called}} the {{population}} <b>attributable</b> <b>risk,</b> is in many epidemiological contexts a more relevant measure of exposure-disease association than the excess risk, relative risk, or odds ratio. When estimating <b>attributable</b> <b>risk</b> with case-control data and a rare disease, we present a simple correction to the standard approach making it essentially unbiased, and also less noisy. As with analogous corrections given in Jewell (1986) for other measures of association, the adjustment often won’t make a substantial difference unless the sample size is very small or point estimates are desired within fine strata, but we discuss the possible utility for applications. Key phrases: <b>attributable</b> <b>risk,</b> case-control studies, small sample corrections. 1 1 <b>Attributable</b> <b>risk</b> Although an exposure may be strongly associated with a disease, an intervention removing the risk factor can produce a limited public health benefit if the exposure is uncommon.

A different measure of association is Levin’s (1953) <b>attributable</b> <b>risk</b> AR = {pr(disease) − pr(disease|unexposed) } /pr(disease) = pr(exposed|disease) (1 − 1 /RR), where equality of the two lines {{can be seen from}} (5. 1) of Jewell (2003).

It was also designed to evaluate CREC as an air sacculitis risk factor and to explore the CREC relationship to other air sacculitis risk factors (poultry house temperature, air-ammonia levels, and presence of other diseases). In addition, this study was used to assess a possible role of the broiler-breeder flocks and hatchers in the spread of CREC air sacculitis. Congo red E. coli-associated airsacculitis risk was based on CREC exposure of the chicks in the hatchers.

The patients were 2489 men and 2856 women 30 to 74 years old at baseline with 12 years of follow-up. During the 12 years of follow-up, a total of 383 men and 227 women developed CHD, which was significantly associated with categories of blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol (all P,. 001). Sex-specific prediction equations were formulated to predict CHD risk according to age, diabetes, smoking, JNC-V blood pressure categories, and NCEP total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol categories. The accuracy of this categorical approach was found to be comparable to CHD prediction when the continuous variables themselves were used. After adjustment for other factors, ' 28 % of CHD events in men and 29 % in women were attributable to blood pressure levels that exceeded high normal ($ 130 / 85). The corresponding multivariable-adjusted <b>attributable</b> <b>risk</b> <b>percent</b> associated with elevated total cholesterol ($ 200 mg/dL) was 27 % in men and 34 % in women. Conclusions—Recommended guidelines of blood pressure, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol effectively predict CH...|$|E
40|$|When {{analyzing}} naturalistic driver performance data, different {{analysis methods}} can have large impacts on safety {{estimates for the}} condition being assessed. To illustrate, this paper reanalyzed the data for a secondary task (conversation on a hand-held cell phone) from the recently-released Virginia Tech Transportation Institute (VTTI) 100 -Car databases, using a standard method for epidemiological analysis. It found substantially lower estimates for the odds ratio (OR), population exposure percent (Pe%), and population <b>attributable</b> <b>risk</b> <b>percent</b> (PAR%) than with the VTTI analysis method. The crash/near-crash OR was reported by VTTI as 1. 29, but {{was found to be}} 0. 78 with the standard method, a reversal in direction from a potentially crash-increasing to a potentially crash-reducing effect. The Pe% for crashes/near-crashes was 12. 5 % using the VTTI method, but declined to 6. 7 % with the standard method. The PAR% was reported as 3. 6 % but a population preventive fraction of 1. 5 % (a protective effect) was estimated by the standard method. The OR difference was traced to an “assumption bias” in the VTTI method that had unequal effects for the unexposed vs. exposed cases. The Pe% and PAR% differences were traced to an error in the VTTI calculation of Pe%. This bias and error were systemic in the VTTI analysis methods, overestimating OR, Pe%, and PAR% for all tasks examined. Future research should seek to better understand the epidemiologic analysis methods that are most appropriate in the new and emerging field of naturalistic driving research...|$|E
40|$|Purpose To {{calculate}} {{the burden of}} lung cancer illness due to radon for all thirty-six health units in Ontario and {{determine the number of}} radon-attributable lung cancer deaths that could be prevented. Methods We calculated the population <b>attributable</b> <b>risk</b> <b>percent,</b> excess life-time risk ratio, life-years lost, the number of lung cancer deaths due to radon, and the number of deaths that could be prevented if all homes above var-ious cut-points were effectively reduced to background levels. Results It is estimated that 13. 6 % (95 % CI 11. 0, 16. 7) of lung cancer deaths in Ontario are attributable to radon, corresponding to 847 (95 % CI 686, 1, 039) lung cancer deaths each year, approximately 84 % of these in ever-smokers. If all homes above 200 Bq/m 3, the current Canadian guideline, were remediated to background levels, it is estimated that 91 lung cancer deaths could be pre-vented each year, 233 if remediation was performed at 100 Bq/m 3. There was important variation across health units. Conclusions Radon is an important contributor to lung cancer deaths in Ontario. A large portion of radon-attributable lung cancer deaths are from exposures below the current Canadian guideline, suggesting interventions that install effective radon-preventive measures into buildings at build may be a good alternative population prevention strategy to testing and remediation. For some health units, testing and remediation may also prevent a portion of radon-related lung cancer deaths. Regional attributable risk estimates can help with local public health resource allocation and decision making...|$|E
40|$|The <b>attributable</b> <b>risk,</b> {{often called}} the {{population}} <b>attributable</b> <b>risk,</b> is in many epidemiological contexts a more relevant measure of exposure-disease association than the excess risk, relative risk, or odds ratio. When estimating <b>attributable</b> <b>risk</b> with case-control data and a rare disease, we present a simple bias correction to the standard approach, which also makes it more stable and less variable. As with analogous corrections given by Jewell (1986) for other measures of association, the adjustment often won't make a substantial difference unless the sample size is very small or point estimates are desired within fine strata, but we discuss the possible utility for applications. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Smoking is {{the main}} risk factor for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), an {{important}} cause of morbidity and mortality. Aim: To estimate smoking <b>attributable</b> <b>risk</b> and population <b>attributable</b> <b>risk</b> in COPD patients attended in Public Health Services of Santiago. Materials and methods: A case control study matched by sex and age was carried out. Crude and adjusted <b>attributable</b> <b>risks</b> as well as population <b>attributable</b> <b>risk</b> were estimated, controlled by potential confounders and by interaction variables. Results: Mean ages for cases and controls were 68 and 67 years respectively. When compared to the control group, COPD patients had a higher smoking prevalence (at least 100 cigarettes in their life span: 89. 7 % vs 60. 3 %; p < 0. 01). Among COPD patients, heavy smokers proportion was 4 times higher than in controls, they smoked for more years (43 vs 31; p < 0. 01) and more cigarettes per day (18 vs 5; p < 0. 01). Adjusted <b>attributable</b> <b>risk</b> was 87 % (95 % Confidence Interval (CI) : 63. 7 - 94. 8). If a patient smoked at least 100 cigarettes in his/her life span and this risk was 92. 7 % (CI: 82. 4 - 96. 9) for heavy smokers. Projecting this index to Santiago inhabitants, about 87, 000 individuals older than 40 years would be suffering COPD due to smoking. Conclusions: This article confirms the strong association between smoking and COPD. <b>Attributable</b> <b>risks</b> are high and significant, {{even when they are}} adjusted by confounding variables. Women had a higher risk than men, at lower levels of tobacco consumptio...|$|R
