40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the performance persistence of hedge funds over time horizons between 6 and 36 months {{based on a}} merged sample from the Lip-per/TASS and CISDM databases for the time period from 1994 to 2008. Unlike previous literature, we use a panel probit regression approach to identify fund characteristics that are significantly related to performance persistence. We then investigate the performance of two-way sorted portfolios where sorting is based on past performance {{and one of the}} additional fund characteristics identified as persistence-enhancing in the probit analysis. We find statistically and econom-ically significant performance persistence for time horizons of up to 36 months. Although we identify several fund characteristics that are strongly correlated with the probability of observing performance persistence, we find only one fund char-acteristic, a strategy distinctiveness index that attempts to measure manager skills and the uniqueness of the hedge fund’s trading strategies, {{to have the ability to}} systematically improve performance persistence up to a time horizon of 24 months. The economic magnitude of this improvement amounts to a sizeable increase in alpha by approximately 4. 0 % and 2. 3 % p. <b>a.</b> <b>for</b> <b>annual</b> and biennial rebalancing, respectively...|$|E
30|$|Data were {{downloaded}} {{from the}} Agri 4 Cast website ([URL] It contains daily {{data for the}} period 1975 –current, at 25  km resolution. We extracted monthly values for mean temperature, total precipitation, total potential evapotranspiration and total radiation, for the period 1990 – 2015. For all four variables we then computed for each year the annual total (or mean {{in the case of}} temperature), the standard deviation and the maximum and the minimum. For every year, the warmest, the coldest, the wettest and the driest quarter of the year was identified. A quarter was defined as a successive period of 3  months, where the value for the months January–March was assigned to January, February–April to February, etc. For the quarters starting in November and December, the months of the next year were used. For every warmest, coldest, wettest and driest quarter, the mean monthly value of all four variables was computed. The resulting explanatory variables where labelled according to their operator (denoted by M for mean, SD for standard deviation, MAX for maximum and MIN for minimum), their aggregation period (<b>a</b> <b>for</b> <b>annual,</b> m for month, waq for warmest quarter, coq for coldest quarter, weq for wettest quarter and drq for driest quarter) and their variable (T for temperature, P for precipitation, PET for potential evapotranspiration and R for radiation), 32 in total.|$|E
