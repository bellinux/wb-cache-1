We used these two models to simulated data sets, under standard conditions (limit of detection (LOD) = 1 cfu/ 25 g; limit of quantification (LOQ) = 10 cfu/g) and used a maximum likelihood estimation method (directly for the model M-CLD and via the Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm for the model M-RD. The comparison suggests that in most cases estimates provided by the proposed model M-RD are similar to those obtained by model M-CLD accounting for censorship. Nevertheless, in some cases, the proposed model M-RD leads to less biased and more precise estimates than model M-CLD. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Microbiological Quality of Kilishi (Traditional Dried Beef) Produced in Ngaoundere, Cameroon. In {{order to}} verify the {{hypothesis}} that the total microbial load of kilishi samples and the strain of micro-organism they contain would have an influence on their hygienic quality, twenty-four samples of spiced and non spiced kilishi, a traditional sun-dried beef were collected from seven production and sales points in Ngaoundere (North Cameroon). In this regard, aerobic mesophilic flora, coliforms, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella spp., sulphito-reducing Clostridium, yeast and moulds were counted on kilishi samples that were diluted serially (ten-fold) and inoculated on selective media. Results obtained showed that 33. 34 % and 50 % of the spiced kilishi samples were contaminated by B. cereus and Salmonella spp., respectively, whereas 83. 34 % of the non spiced kilishi samples were contaminated by these two micro-organisms. Furthermore, the other investigated micro-organisms were found in all kilishi samples, independent of the type of product. The ratio A/B expressed as the mean level of contamination of spiced kilishi (A) to that of non spiced kilishi (B) was determined for each type of micro-organisms counted. The mean value was 0. 43 for sulphito-reducing Clostridium, while the highest value was 0. 63 for Salmonella spp. and the lowest 0. 27 for Bacillus cereus. This confirms that samples of non spiced kilishi were more contaminated by foodborne pathogens than those of spiced kilishi (P 102 CFU/g) were higher than the recommended microbiological standards for cooked meat products (<b>absence</b> <b>in</b> <b>25</b> <b>g</b> of product), thus presents a risk of foodborne intoxication for consumers...|$|E

When necessary, food business operators will conduct studies in accordance with annex II of Regulation, especially on RTE foods that may support the growth of L. monocytogenes and may pose a risk for public health. Evidence proving that the limit of 100 cfu/g will not be exceeded throughout the product shelf-life shall be based on shelf-life studies, initially consisting of information on the product specific composition (intrinsic and extrinsic characteristics) and of comparison with data from relevant scientific literature on the pathogen growth and survival characteristics. The repository of data of manufactured products, the predictive microbiology and the specific shelf-life studies conducted in laboratory (durability and challenge studies) are additional tools to be used in case the studies on foodstuff composition, the process conditions and comparison to published data on scientific journals are not enough to prevent any doubt on L. monocytogenes ability to grow. Nevertheless, challenge studies on foodstuffs should be avoided and be used with caution.

40|$|Abstract Salmonellosis is a {{major public}} health problem related to food {{contamination}} and ensuing food poisoning. Brazilian resolution RDC nº 12 / 2001 of the Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) established the <b>absence</b> of Salmonella <b>in</b> <b>25</b> <b>g</b> of fish for consumption. However, the {{significant increase in the}} occurrence of fish contamination by Salmonella and other pathogenic bacteria shows that the currently applied strategies are not sufficient and that, in addition to the implementation of good health practices, the application of new sanitizer technologies in the fish industry is also necessary. In this context, the present study evaluated the effectiveness of ozone in an aqueous medium as a sanitizer for Salmonella contaminated fish. The experiment was carried out using a completely randomized design with eight treatments and five replicates, giving a total of 40 experimental units. Each sample consisted of three fishes, totalizing 120 fishes. The treatments consisted of different combinations of temperature and water-dissolved ozone (O 3) concentrations (21 °C × 0. 35 ppm; 20 °C × 0. 45 ppm; 21 °C × 0. 60 ppm; 20 °C × 0. 80 ppm; 19 °C × 1. 7 ppm; 6 × 5. 1 ppm; 4 °C × 7. 2 ppm; and 2 °C × 9. 1 ppm). Colossoma macropomum (Tambaqui) samples were experimentally infected with Salmonella typhymurium (ATCC 14028) and immersed in water with the different treatments. After three minutes, the fish samples were collected and subjected to qualitative Salmonella analyses. The ozone tests were not efficient in eradicating Salmonella under the experimental conditions presented here, indicating the need for the identification of effective sanitizers {{in order to meet the}} determinations of Brazilian law...|$|R

In a broth model system, phage P 100 at a concentration equal to or greater than 7 log PFU/mL completely inhibited 2 log CFU/cm 2 or 3 log CFU/cm 2 of L. monocytogenes growth at 30 °C. The temperature (4, 10, 20 °C) seemed to influence P 100 activity; the best results were obtained at 4 °C. On dry-cured ham slices, a P 100 concentration ranging from 5 to 8 log PFU/cm 2 was required to obtain a significant reduction in L. monocytogenes. At 4, 10, and 20 °C, an inoculum of 8 log PFU/cm 2 was required to completely eliminate 2 log L. monocytogenes/cm 2 and to reach the <b>absence</b> <b>in</b> <b>25</b> <b>g</b> product according to USA food law. Conversely, it was impossible to completely eradicate L. monocytogenes with an inoculum of approximately of 3. 0 and 4. 0 log CFU/cm 2 and with a P 100 inoculum ranging from 1 to 7 log PFU/cm 2. P 100 remained stable on dry-cured ham slices over a 14 -day storage period, with only a marginal loss of 0. 2 log PFU/cm 2 from an initial phage treatment of approximately 8 log PFU/cm 2. Moreover, phage P 100 eliminated free L. monocytogenes cells and biofilms on the machinery surfaces used for dry-cured ham production. These findings demonstrate that the GRAS bacteriophage Listex P 100 at level of 8 log PFU/cm 2 is listericidal and useful for reducing the L. monocytogenes concentration or eradicating the bacteria from dry-cured ham...|$|E

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have recently launched risk assessment studies of a number of pathogen^food commodity combinations (Salmonella in eggs and in broiler chickens, Listeria monocytogenes in ready-to-eat foods, Campylobacter in broiler chickens, Vibrio in seafood) to be used to lower the risk associated with these food-borne diseases and ensure fair practices in the international trade of food. The FAO/WHO Listeria risk assessment was undertaken in part to determine how previously developed risk assessments done at the national level could be adapted or expanded to address concerns related to L. monocytogenes in ready-to-eat foods at an international level. In addition, after initiation of the risk assessment, the risk assessors were asked by the Codex Committee on Food to consider three specific questions related to ready-to-eat foods in general, which are: (1) estimate the risk for consumers in different susceptible populations groups (elderly, infants, pregnant women and immunocompromised patients) relative to the general population; (2) estimate the risk for L. monocytogenes in foods that support growth and foods that do not support growth under specific storage and shelf-life conditions; (3) estimate the risk from L. monocytogenes in food when the number of organisms ranges from <b>absence</b> <b>in</b> <b>25</b> <b>g</b> to 1000 colonies forming units per gram or milliliter, or does not exceed specified levels at the point of consumption.

40|$|Background:  Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) {{may be an}} {{interesting}} hypnotic agent in burn patients because of its good respiratory or hemodynamic tolerance. However, its clinical and electroencephalographic (EEG) sedative effects are not yet described in children. The aim of this prospective and randomized study was to assess clinical and EEG effects of increasing intravenous (IV) doses of GHB in burn children requiring sedation for burn wound cares. Methods:  Thirty six children hospitalized in a burn care unit were included and randomly assigned into three groups (G) according to the single IV dose of GHB they received before burn wound care: 10  mg·kg(- 1) <b>in</b> <b>G</b> 10, <b>25</b>  mg·kg(- 1) <b>in</b> <b>G</b> <b>25,</b> or 50  mg·kg(- 1) in G 50. All patients received oral premedication (morphine and hydroxyzine) 30  min before GHB injection. Respiratory rate, heart rate, pulse oximetry, and bispectral index (BIS) were continuously monitored. Depth of sedation was clinically assessed using Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (OAAS) Score, every 2  min until recovery (i. e., OAAS =  4). Results:  Median age was 17. 5 [12 - 34] months. Whatever the dose, BIS decreased after IV GHB.

Overall, the prevalence of L. monocytogenes in these RTE foods {{in the present study was}} lower compared to former studies in Belgium. For mayonnaise-based deli-salads, in 80 out of 1187 samples (6. 7 %) the pathogen was detected <b>in</b> <b>25</b> <b>g.</b> L. monocytogenes positive samples were often associated with smoked fish deli-salads. Cooked meat products showed a 1. 1 % (n = 639) prevalence of the pathogen. For both food categories, numbers per gram never exceeded 100 CFU. L. monocytogenes was detected in 27. 8 % (25 / 90) smoked fish samples, while 4 / 25 positive samples failed to comply to the 100 CFU/g limit set out in EU Regulation 2073 / 2005. Challenge testing showed growth potential in 18 / 182 (9. 9 %) deli-salads and 61 / 92 (66 %) cooked meat products. Nevertheless, both for deli-salads and cooked meat products, appropriate product formulation and storage conditions based upon hurdle technology could guarantee no growth of L. monocytogenes throughout the shelf-life as specified by the food business operator.

In addition, Salmonella and Staphyococcus aureus are well known pathogens for their mayor impact in public health. The objective {{for the present study}} consisted on determinate the sanitary quality from chorizo and longaniza samples from several butcheries in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico. Samples of chorizo (50) and longaniza (50) were obtained from different points in Guadalajara metropolis. Presence of Salmonella and recounts for S. aureus were tested <b>in</b> <b>25</b> <b>g</b> samples. Procedure was followed according Mexican NOM 145 -SSA 1 - 1995 methods. In chorizo, 18 samples were positive to Salmonella. The count of S. aureus showed a mean of 24, 600 UFC/g. On the other hand, 24 samples of longaniza were positive to Salmonella spp. In this case, the mean of S. aureus was 7, 800 UFC/g. The serotypes of Salmonella spp were: Derby (30 %), Adelaile (17 %), Azteca (15 %), Infantis (15 %), Muenster(10 %) y Anatum (13 %). The high positivity of Salmonella spp. and S. aureus is a potential hazard to consumers...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} study of {{extended}} γ-ray emission with the Large Area Telescope (LAT) onboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, {{which is likely to}} be the second case of a γ-ray detection from a star-forming region (SFR) in our Galaxy. The LAT source is located <b>in</b> the <b>G</b> <b>25</b> region, 1. 7 ^∘× 2. 1 ^∘ around (l, b) = (25. 0 ^∘, 0. 0 ^∘). The γ-ray emission is found to be composed of two extended sources and one point-like source. The extended sources have a similar sizes of about 1. 4 ^∘× 0. 6 ^∘. An ∼ 0. 4 ^∘ diameter sub-region of one has a photon index of Γ = 1. 53 ± 0. 15; and is spatially coincident with HESS J 1837 - 069, likely a pulsar wind nebula. The other parts of the extended sources have a photon index of Γ = 2. 1 ± 0. 2 without significant spectral curvature. Given their spatial and spectral properties, they have no clear associations with sources at other wavelengths. Their γ-ray properties are similar to those of the Cygnus cocoon SFR, the only firmly established γ-ray detection of an SFR in the Galaxy. Indeed, we find bubble-like structures of atomic and molecular gas <b>in</b> <b>G</b> <b>25,</b> which may be created by a putative OB association/cluster. The γ-ray emitting regions appear confined in the bubble-like structure; similar properties are also found in the Cygnus cocoon. In addition, using observations with the the XMM-Newton we find a candidate young massive OB association/cluster <b>G</b> <b>25.</b> 18 + 0. 26 <b>in</b> the <b>G</b> <b>25</b> region. We propose that the extended γ-ray emission <b>in</b> <b>G</b> <b>25</b> is associated with an SFR driven by <b>G</b> <b>25.</b> 18 + 0. 26. Based on this scenario, we discuss possible acceleration processes in the SFR and compare them with the Cygnus cocoon. Comment: 31 pages, 23 figures, accepted for publication in Ap...|$|R
40|$|Very low {{cell count}} {{detection}} of Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 in foods is critical, since an infective dose for this pathogen {{may be only}} 10 cells, and fewer still for vulnerable populations. A flow cytometer is able to detect and count individual cells of a target bacterium, in this case E. coli O 157 :H 7. The challenge {{is to find the}} single cell in a complex matrix like raw spinach. To find that cell requires growing it as quickly as possible to a number sufficiently in excess of matrix background that identification is certain. The experimental design for this work was that of a U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) In-House Level 3 validation executed in the technology’s originating laboratory. Using non-selective enrichment broth, 6. 5 h incubation at 42 °C, centrifugation for target cell concentration, and a highly selective E. coli O 157 fluorescent antibody tag, the cytometry method proved more sensitive than a reference regulatory method (p = 0. 01) for detecting a single target cell, one E. coli O 157 :H 7 cell, <b>in</b> <b>25</b> <b>g</b> of spinach. It counted that cell’s daughters with at least 38 × signal-to-noise ratio, analyzing <b>25</b> samples <b>in</b> total-time-to-results of 9 h...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{range of}} dental {{varnishes}} have been commercialized recently that contain calcium and inorganic phosphate {{in addition to}} fluoride. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyse the fluoride, calcium and inorganic phosphate ion release from: (1) MI Varnish containing casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP); (2) Clinpro White containing functionalized tricalcium phosphate (fTCP); (3) Enamel Pro containing amorphous calcium phosphate; (4) Bifluorid 5 containing calcium fluoride; and (5) Duraphat (no added calcium control). METHODS: The varnishes were applied to a standardized surface area of polyvinyl chloride (n = 7 per group) and immersed <b>in</b> <b>25</b> <b>g</b> of distilled deionized water which was changed at 1, 4, 24, 72 and 168 hours. The ion release was determined by ion chromatography and expressed as μmol (cumulative) per gram of varnish. RESULTS: All varnishes released measurable fluoride and calcium, however only MI Varnish and Enamel Pro released significant levels of inorganic phosphate. At 24 hours the order of cumulative fluoride release was: 1 > 3 > 4 > 2 = 5 with 1 significantly higher (p 4 > 3 > 2 = 5 with 1 significantly higher (p < 0. 05) than the rest. CONCLUSIONS: MI Varnish containing CPP-ACP had the highest release of calcium and fluoride ions...|$|R
40|$|Faster {{detection}} of contaminated foods can prevent adulterated foods from being consumed and {{minimize the risk}} of an outbreak of foodborne illness. A sensitive molecular detection method is especially important for Shigella because ingestion of as few as 10 of these bacterial pathogens can cause disease. The objectives of this study were to compare the ability of four DNA extraction methods to detect Shigella in six types of produce, post-enrichment, and to evaluate a new and rapid conventional multiplex assay that targets the Shigella ipaH, virB and mxiC virulence genes. This assay can detect less than two Shigella cells in pure culture, even when the pathogen is mixed with background microflora, and it can also differentiate natural Shigella strains from a control strain and eliminate false positive results due to accidental laboratory contamination. The four DNA extraction methods (boiling, PrepMan Ultra [Applied Biosystems], InstaGene Matrix [Bio-Rad], DNeasy Tissue kit [Qiagen]) detected 1. 6 × 103 Shigella CFU/ml post-enrichment, requiring ~ 18 doublings to one cell <b>in</b> <b>25</b> <b>g</b> of produce pre-enrichment. Lower sensitivity was obtained, depending on produce type and extraction method. The InstaGene Matrix was the most consistent and sensitive and the multiplex assay accurately detected Shigella in less than 90 min, outperforming, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, molecular assays currently in place for this pathogen...|$|R
