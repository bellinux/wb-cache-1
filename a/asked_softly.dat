6000|$|... "What {{troubles}} you, Vernoon," [...] the Asika <b>asked</b> <b>softly,</b> {{then added}} anything but softly to Jeekie, [...] "Translate, you dog, and be swift." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He will live, then, you think?" [...] she <b>asked</b> <b>softly,</b> marveling {{that after}} {{what she had}} {{witnessed}} the man {{was still able to}} breathe.|$|E
6000|$|Lady Claudia {{looked up}} from her {{embroidery}} again. [...] "Are you going to see them yourself?" [...] she <b>asked</b> <b>softly.</b> [...] "I thought the steward--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm sorry;" [...] and Demi sat silent a minute, {{wondering}} what subject {{would be safe}} to try next. He felt delicate about speaking of the departed lady, but was very curious about the cats, and could not resist <b>asking</b> <b>softly,</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What is odd?" [...] <b>asked</b> a <b>softly</b> stepping, softly {{speaking}} {{gentleman in}} black, suddenly {{appearing on the}} threshold of the parlor door.|$|R
6000|$|... "Are you lads {{ready for}} the journey?" [...] he <b>asked,</b> {{speaking}} <b>softly</b> and looking around cautiously like one who fears his words may be overheard.|$|R
6000|$|... "Are we, then," [...] he <b>asked</b> <b>softly,</b> [...] "such very {{important}} things {{in the scheme of}} God's entire creation that everything must be ordered so as to suit us best?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} I could hurt her?" [...] she <b>asked,</b> <b>softly,</b> {{and was so}} startled to hear him mutter a gloomy [...] "Perhaps," [...] that she hesitated before she smiled.|$|E
6000|$|... "Is it a game, this?" [...] he <b>asked</b> <b>softly.</b> [...] "You {{press the}} button {{and the little girl}} appears. That means that I {{increase}} the stakes and the prize pops up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dost thou still say, O my life, that Sakr-el-Bahr is the stoutest {{champion}} of the Prophet's law?" [...] she <b>asked</b> him <b>softly,</b> yet on a note of amazement.|$|R
6000|$|... "When {{they see}} this holy mark, think you that the priests of Amen will cast me to the flames, O Royal Son of Mermes?" [...] <b>asked</b> Tua <b>softly.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "May I have her?" [...] <b>asked</b> Helen <b>softly,</b> {{holding out}} her arms. She took the child, {{and placed it}} upon her knee where its look of solemnity soon changed to one of {{infantile}} delight.|$|R
6000|$|... "Should I {{have died}} before the morning {{if you had}} not come here?" [...] she <b>asked,</b> <b>softly.</b> [...] "Have you saved my life for the second time? I can well believe it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you mad to come here?" [...] she <b>asked,</b> <b>softly.</b> [...] "You {{ought not}} to show {{yourself}} in the streets. Do you not {{know that you are}} the most unpopular person in Theos?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Had {{the doctor}} {{anything}} new to tell you?' she <b>asked,</b> <b>softly,</b> at length, with that gentle, timid sympathy which touched a keen fibre in his heart. He lifted his eyebrows with a negligent, indifferent expression.|$|E
6000|$|... "'I am not angry,' I said; 'I {{have nothing}} to forgive. We are both imprudent; we are both unhappy.' I laid my head on his shoulder. 'Do you really love me?' I <b>asked</b> him, <b>softly,</b> in a whisper.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{has promised}} to drink his tea here to-night. You would not take away our child's pleasure, Martin?" [...] <b>asked</b> the mother, <b>softly.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Should I {{be right}} or wrong, Mr. Armadale, if I guessed {{that you were}} {{thinking}} of somebody?" [...] <b>asked</b> a voice, <b>softly,</b> behind him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{take care}} of myself, don't fear, Dora," [...] he made reply, and then, as they were all alone he drew her up to him. [...] "Dora, may I?" [...] he <b>asked,</b> <b>softly</b> and tenderly.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{will become}} of us?" [...] I <b>asked</b> <b>softly,</b> for Lord Lumley had ceased his exertions for {{a moment with a}} little gesture of despair. His face was very pale, but it might have been from fatigue.|$|E
6000|$|A redness stole into Marty's {{face as she}} {{mentioned}} Giles's name, which Mrs. Charmond did not fail to notice informed her {{of the state of}} the girl's heart. [...] "Are you engaged to him?" [...] she <b>asked,</b> <b>softly.</b>|$|E
60|$|After {{the company}} were {{withdrawn}} {{he fell into}} a sound sleep, which lasted from two till six, and his sister, being apprehensive of the return of his fit, came to the bedside, and, <b>asking</b> <b>softly</b> if he wanted anything, he turned about to her and spoke to this effect: Dear sister, you see me not only recovered out of a terrible fit, but likewise that I have the liberty of speech, a blessing that I have been deprived of almost sixty years, and I am satisfied you are sincerely joyful to find me in the state I now am in; but, alas! it is but a mistaken kindness. These are things but of short duration, {{and if they were}} to continue for a hundred years longer, I can't see how I should be anyways the better.|$|R
6000|$|... "I will try, Mother, I truly will. But {{you must}} help me, remind me, and {{keep me from}} flying out. I used to see Father {{sometimes}} {{put his finger on}} his lips, and look at you with a very kind but sober face, and you always folded your lips tight and went away. Was he reminding you then?" [...] <b>asked</b> Jo <b>softly.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Please {{tell about}} it. I have horrid quarrels with Mamie Parsons sometimes, {{but we always}} kiss and make up, and feel all happy again. Can't you, Cousin Penny?" [...] <b>asked</b> the child, <b>softly</b> {{touching}} the little white curls under the lace cap.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear, dear Dr. May!" [...] was {{her first}} exclamation. [...] "Oh, how happy you must all be! And Margaret?" [...] She looked up at Norman, and came nearer. [...] "Is not Mr. Ernescliffe come?" [...] she <b>asked</b> <b>softly,</b> and trembling.|$|E
6000|$|She {{looked so}} sweet and pure in her budding innocence, like a half-blown water-lily, {{that the young}} man, already more than two-thirds in love, was {{instantly}} captivated. [...] "Because they were forget-me-nots, or because they were MINE, Miss Barton?" [...] he <b>asked</b> <b>softly,</b> all timorousness.|$|E
6000|$|... "How am I {{to answer}} that?" [...] he <b>asked</b> <b>softly.</b> [...] "I will answer it {{first in the}} way that seems most natural. I will beg you to accept your losings as a little gift from me--as a proof, if you will, of my friendship." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why is the Great Chief sad?" [...] <b>asked</b> Mushymush, <b>softly.</b> [...] "Does {{his soul}} still yearn for {{the blood of}} the pale-faced teachers? Did not the {{scalping}} of two professors of geology in the Yale exploring party satisfy his warrior's heart yesterday? Has he forgotten that Hayden and Clarence King are still to follow? Shall his own Mushymush bring him a botanist to-morrow? Speak, for the silence of my brother lies on my heart like the snow on the mountain, and checks the flow of my speech." ...|$|R
6000|$|Rose was warming {{her feet}} and sipping the {{chocolate}} which Phebe always had ready for her, as she never ate supper, when a hurried tap came at the long window whence the light streamed and Mac's voice was heard <b>softly</b> <b>asking</b> to be let in [...] "just for one minute." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shall we pity {{him on that}} account?" [...] he <b>asked,</b> {{and laughed}} <b>softly</b> and shortly. [...] "Come away," [...] he added abruptly. [...] "They wait for you!" [...] And so, by the suasion of his arm and his {{imperious}} will, she was swept onward along the road of her destiny.|$|R
6000|$|... "Have I been a brute?" [...] he <b>asked</b> <b>softly.</b> [...] "You must forgive me, Fedora. I am {{not much}} used to girls and I am sort of carried away myself, only I {{want you to}} believe that there's the real thing in my heart. I'll make you just as happy as a woman can be. Don't shake your head, dear. I want you to trust me and believe in me." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Princess {{was dressed}} with {{exquisite}} simplicity, entirely in white. Her only ornaments were white roses {{in her hair}} and in her bosom. To say that she looked lovely is to say nothing. She {{seemed to be the}} ethereal creature of some higher sphere; too exquisitely delicate and pure to be approached by a mere mortal man like myself. I was awed; I was silent. Her Highness's sweet smile encouraged me to venture a little nearer. She pointed to a footstool which the Baroness had placed for her. [...] "Are you afraid of me, Ernest?" [...] she <b>asked</b> <b>softly.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Why {{should it}} be denied?" [...] he <b>asked</b> <b>softly</b> and coming towards her. [...] "Is there not much between you and me? Did not you, brave and blessed woman that you are, risk your life for my sake in the Old Tower at Jerusalem? Did you not for my sake stand there upon the gate Nicanor to perish miserably? And I, though it be little, have I not done {{something}} for you? Have I not so soon as your message reached me, journeyed here to Rome, at the cost, perhaps, of what I value more than life--my honour?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are {{you going}} away?" [...] she <b>softly</b> <b>asked.</b> [...] "Why need you? I {{know that people}} always seem to think they can't be friends after--such a thing as this. But why shouldn't we? I respect you, and I like you very much. You have shown me more regard and more {{kindness}} than any other friend"-- ...|$|R
6000|$|The sweet {{pale face}} and languid eyes were as a charm to expel all but kindly thoughts, as Theodora {{sat down with}} the living weight warm on her lap, and the gentle mother at {{intervals}} <b>softly</b> <b>asking</b> about her boy. 'Poor little man, they would not let him come in: they kept away both the people I wanted.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What... {{what did}} you say, Lionel?" [...] she <b>asked.</b> Oliver laughed <b>softly.</b> [...] "He was about to add proof of his statement, I think," [...] he jeered. [...] "He was about to mention the wound he took in that fight, which left those tracks in the snow, thus to prove that I lied--as indeed I did--when I said that he took Peter unawares.|$|R
