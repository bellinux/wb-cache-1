5|$|Since 2001, Hamar Olympic Amphitreatre {{has hosted}} the annual Idrettsgallaen, a {{television}} show that honors the past year's Norwegian sports and athlete achievements. Hamar was selected to host the event because its main sponsor, the national lottery company Norsk Tipping, has its head office in Hamar. Idrettsgallaen is held in early January, when many of winter sports <b>athletes</b> <b>are</b> home and the summer <b>athletes</b> <b>are</b> off season. In 2010, Idrettsgallaen was hosted in Lillehammer because the weekend crashed with the 2010 European Speed Skating Championships in Vikingskipet and Hamar lacks sufficient hotel capacity to host both simultaneously. Concerts hosted at the arena since the opening concert with Fats Domino on 25 November 1992 include Little Richard in 1993, Vamp in 2005, Willie Nelson in 2008 and José Carreras in 2010.|$|E

5|$|The {{sport is}} {{classified}} as a B1 event, meaning that it is for blind athletes, however vision-impaired <b>athletes</b> <b>are</b> also able to take part as all competitors wear eyeshades to ensure they are equally disadvantaged.

5|$|Track {{and field}} <b>athletes</b> <b>are</b> banned from ingesting or using certain {{substances}} by governing bodies for the sport, {{from the national}} to the international level. The IAAF's constitution incorporates the World Anti-Doping Code among other anti-doping measures. Practices such as blood doping {{and the use of}} anabolic steroids, peptide hormones, stimulants, or diuretics can give athletes a physical competitive advantage in track and field. The use of such substances in track and field is opposed on both ethical and medical grounds. Given that the sport functions by measuring and comparing athletes' performances, performance-enhancing substances create an uneven playing field — athletes who do not use doping substances have a disadvantage over rivals who do. Medically, the use of banned substances may have an adverse effect upon athletes' health. However, some exemptions are made for athletes who take banned substances for therapeutic use, and <b>athletes</b> <b>are</b> not sanctioned for usage in these cases, such as Kim Collins' failed drug test due to asthma medication.|$|E
40|$|The {{value of}} {{different}} articles of food {{as sources of}} energy to <b>athletes</b> <b>is</b> discussed.

Regular weighing of <b>athletes</b> <b>is</b> important to ascertain that the input {{is equal to the}} output.

5|$|Combined (or multi-discipline) {{events are}} {{competitions}} in which athletes {{participate in a}} number of track and field events, earning points for their performance in each event, which adds to a total points score. Outdoors, the most common combined events are the men's decathlon (ten events) and the women's heptathlon (seven events). Due to stadium limitations, indoor combined events competition have a reduced number of events, resulting in the men's heptathlon and the women's pentathlon. <b>Athletes</b> <b>are</b> allocated points based on an international-standard points scoring system, such as the decathlon scoring table.|$|E
5|$|In the past, the {{decision}} to allow athletes to return to participation was frequently based on the grade of concussion. However, current research and recommendations by professional organizations including the National Athletic Trainers' Association recommend against such use of these grading systems. Currently, injured <b>athletes</b> <b>are</b> prohibited from returning to play before they are symptom-free during both rest and exertion and until results of the neuropsychological tests have returned to pre-injury levels.|$|E
5|$|One-day {{track and}} field {{meetings}} form {{the most common and}} seasonal aspect of the sport – they are the most basic level of {{track and field}} competition. Meetings are generally organised annually either under the patronage of an educational institution or sports club, or by a group or business that serves as the meeting promoter. In the case of the former, <b>athletes</b> <b>are</b> selected to represent their club or institution. In the case of privately run or independent meetings, athletes participate on an invitation-only basis.|$|E

5|$|The flag is also popularly flown during {{important}} sporting events, {{such as the}} FIFA World Cup, if Polish <b>athletes</b> <b>are</b> participating; {{and during}} an official visit of a particularly important person, especially a pope, in Poland. During a pope's visit, the national flag is usually flown together with yellow and white Church flags, and white and blue Marian flags. It is uncommon to fly the national flag on personal occasions, such as birthdays or weddings.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two types}} of field events: jumps, and throws. In jumping competitions, <b>athletes</b> <b>are</b> judged on either the length or height of their jumps. The {{performances}} of jumping events for distance are measured from a board or marker, and any athlete overstepping this mark is judged to have fouled. In the jumps for height, an athlete must clear their body over a crossbar without knocking the bar off the supporting standards. The majority of jumping events are unaided, although athletes propel themselves vertically with purpose-built sticks in the pole vault.|$|E
5|$|Unlike ski jumping, {{which can}} be contested in the summer on {{specially}} equipped hills, ski flying is strictly a winter sport and {{not part of the}} Winter Olympics; no world records have therefore been set at the games. Also in contrast to ski jumping, <b>athletes</b> <b>are</b> not able to practice on ski flying hills out-of-season, as they are used only for competition events. Among the Alpine countries there is an unwritten gentlemen's agreement forbidding athletes under the age of 18 to participate in ski flying events, although an exception was made for 17-year-old Domen Prevc in 2017.|$|E
