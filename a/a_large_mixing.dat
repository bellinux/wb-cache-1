He began studying the piano at the age of four years, and in his teens worked to gain a scholarship to Trinity College of Music in London. There, he learned the play the organ, then transferred to the University of Bristol in 1966 to study electronic engineering, a decision made easier because he was [...] "hopelessly infatuated with an astonishingly pretty girl from my social group at home who'd gone up the year before." [...] At Bristol, Blyth founded the Student Music Society, and studied orchestra conducting; as a senior he conducted a performance of Bach's complex masterpiece St Matthew Passion. After college, he obtained a position with the Compton Organ Company in their research department where he met Bill Kelsey, his early mentor, who showed him how to lay out circuits on printed circuit boards. Compton was [...] "on its last legs", according to Blyth, and he left to join Graseby Instruments where he designed electronic filters for underwater weapons to satisfy Admiralty contracts. Blyth spent evenings at Kelsey's Notting Hill flat helping him assemble <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>mixing</b> desk, one used by Emerson, Lake & Palmer at the [...] "legendary" [...] Isle of Wight Festival 1970.

40|$|We discuss {{models of}} {{neutrino}} masses {{that lead to}} <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>mixing</b> angle for atmospheric neutrino oscillations. In particular we study a mechanism where a simple texture for the Dirac matrix leads to the observed pattern of mixings for a continuous range of Majorana matrices in a reasonably natural way. Both nearly maximal and small mixing solutions for solar neutrinos are compatible with this model. Possible dynamical realizations are discussed and a detailed example in terms of horizontal U(1) charges is presented. CERN-TH/ 98 - 310 DFPD- 98 /TH/ 46 September 1998 Following the experimental results from Superkamiokande [1] {{a lot of attention}} has been devoted to the problem of a natural explanation of the observed nearly maximal mixing angle for atmospheric neutrino oscillations. It is possible that also solar neutrino oscillations, if explained by vacuum oscillations, occur with <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>mixing</b> angle [2]. Large mixing angles are somewhat unexpected because the observed quark mixings are small and the quark, charged lepton and neutrino mass matrices are to some extent related in Grand Unified Theories.
