The Portland Mercury {{said the}} restaurant was a [...] "kinda retro-y bar... popular with a young college-y, drinkin', party crowd". One Portland resident described the club as [...] "the {{kind of place where}} you can go with your sophisticated friends and look at the Daddy-O decor. Or you can go on a date and snuggle in a corner where the lighting is low. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to meet new people you can stroll through there and see people whose faces you've never seen before, which is a rare thing in Portland." ...|$|E
500|$|Biographer Karen Hollinger {{described}} the early 1990s as {{a downturn in}} the popularity of Streep's films, attributing this partly to a critical perception that her comedies had been an attempt to convey a lighter image following several serious but commercially unsuccessful dramas, and more significantly {{to the lack of}} options available to an actress in her forties. Streep commented that she had limited her options by her preference to work in Los Angeles, close to her family, a situation that she had anticipated in a 1981 interview when she commented, [...] "By the time an actress hits her mid-forties, no one's interested in her anymore. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to fit a couple of babies into that schedule as well, you've got to pick your parts with great care." [...] At the Screen Actor's Guild National Women's Conference in 1990, Streep keynoted the first national event, emphasizing the decline in women's work opportunities, pay parity, and role models within the film industry. She criticized the film industry for downplaying the importance of women both on screen and off.|$|E

2500|$|In 1981, at {{a conference}} co-organized by MIT and IBM, {{physicist}} Richard Feynman urged the world to build a quantum computer. He said [...] "Nature isn't classical, dammit, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to make a simulation of nature, you'd better make it quantum mechanical, and by golly it's a wonderful problem, because it doesn't look so easy." ...|$|E

Hood received an M.D. from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in 1964 and a Ph.D. from Caltech in 1968, {{where he worked}} with William J. Dreyer on antibody diversity. Dreyer is credited with giving Hood two important pieces of advice: [...] “If you want to practice biology, {{do it on the}} leading edge, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to be on the leading edge, invent new tools for deciphering biological information.” ...|$|E

2500|$|During a {{campaign}} stop in October 2007, a reporter inquired {{as to why}} Obama had stopped wearing a lapel pin of the American flag, which he had started wearing after the September 11, 2001 attacks, and his response was that {{it had come to}} feel like [...] "a substitute for true patriotism." [...] This led to discussion on the cable news channels and was covered by satirists such as Stephen Colbert, who had an ongoing disagreement with the Fox & Friends assertion that [...] "this is America, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to be president of America, it might be [...] behoove him to wear an American flag."

2500|$|The rebels {{increased}} their pressure and reaching {{the door of}} the house of Uthman set it on fire. Some rebels climbed the houses of the neighbors and then jumped into the house of Uthman. It was July 17, 656 C.E. and Uthman was fasting that day. The previous night he had seen Muhammad in a dream. Muhammad had said,"If you wish help can be sent to you <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> you can break your fast with us this evening. We will welcome you. Uthman opted for the second. That made Uthman know that it was his last day of life.He was assassinated while reciting the Quran, The ayat of Surah Baqarah [...] "137. So if they believe in the like of that which you believe, then they are rightly guided, but if they turn away, then they are only in opposition. So Allah will suffice you against them. And He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower". According to some traditions, the blood-stained Quran he was reciting from is still preserved in a museum in Tashkent today. Other copies of the Quran, preserved in other cities, are also claimed to be [...] "Uthman's Quran" ...|$|E
2500|$|Vanda & Young {{returned}} to Australia in 1973 and were reunited with Ted Albert, who had established Albert Productions under EMI Records. Recently formed AC/DC's band members, and George Young's brothers, Malcolm and Angus Young joined the Marcus Hook Roll Band project on guitars to complete Tales of Old Grand-Daddy with John Proud on drums. In late 1974 Vanda & Young produced AC/DC's single [...] "Can I Sit Next to You Girl". They also produced early albums for AC/DC including High Voltage (1975), TNT and Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap (both 1976), Let There Be Rock (1977), Powerage <b>and</b> <b>If</b> <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> Blood You've Got It (both 1978).

2500|$|In a 2007 Beat the Blizzard webzine's article, {{the writer}} Jan Lindsø states that [...] "any metal fans {{are of the}} opinion that Christians should 'not be allowed' to use the black metal {{aesthetics}} musically since they do not inherit this evil and perhaps misantropic [...] trait that many people say is necessary in order to be convincing as black metal musicians". Kittil Kittilsen, who left Mayhem in 1988 after becoming a born-again Christian, expressed his concern for the unblack metal musicians: [...] "I think they're completely off the mark. I cannot seriously understand how they even manage to do it. They have missed the target completely. I mean, {{if you want to be}} a Christian, be it with all you've got, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to be metal, be it with all you've got. If those people really took their faith seriously, and followed the instructions of the One they profess to believe in, they would never be found in a context like that. They are on collision course with Christian life and teaching. I say this because of my own experience, and because of what is written in the Bible; rock music, metal music has nothing at all to do in a Christian setting!" ...|$|E
2500|$|At first, {{it might}} {{appear that the}} boyfriend is {{straight}} up busted. But it's more complicated than that, especially as you see Mýa and her girls engaged in their own energetic calisthenics, then (apparently) commanding their male admirers to hit the ground and perform push-ups, constructing a kind of reciprocal relationship that, for instance, Christina Aguilera's video for [...] "What a Girl Wants" [...] cannot do, in its celebration of the most excellent boyfriend {{whose job is to}} be endlessly appreciative of his girlfriend's super-gloriousness (see also, Christina's video for Genie in a Bottle," [...] in which she also dances seductively with a group of girls for a group of boys). Director Diane Martel has done her share of conventionally alluring Mariah Carey and Christina Aguilera videos, but here the terms have shifted. Mýa and her girls—in moves recalling Janet's—don't pretend to be charming or enticing. Instead, they present themselves as young women with demands and desires, proudly hard-bodied and self-possessed.Mýa can rock the midriff tops like any other pop star, but as always, she remains slightly offbeat, neither apologetic nor solicitous. Sexy and self-assured without being coy, she knows who she is and what she wants, and says it outright: [...] "What'cha gonna do / When you can't say no / And your feelings start to show? / Boy I really need to know / And how you gonna act?" [...] In Mýa's world, it's not the girl who turns emotional and unsure of herself when a question of integrity arises, but the more fragile, less stable boy. She warns,"There's no need to / Reminisce about the past, / Obviously, 'cause that shit did not last." [...] The video's imagery underlines her admonition, as the camera shoots up at her looking unafraid and austere, backed by her crew as the dust flies from their work-out: [...] "She don't know me / She's about to know me / I'm in your life / That's how it's gon' be." [...] <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to mess around, you're free to choose, but it will cost: [...] "If you want her back / You can take her back. / Cause game recognize game. / I could do the same thing." [...] And she does. At the end of the [...] video, Mýa and her dancers exit, leaving their audience dusty and on their own.|$|E

5000|$|Born in Budapest, Hungary, Kovács, {{with his}} parents and sister, fled Hungary {{at the time of}} the Hungarian Revolution of 1956.

As Kovács recalled in an interview, I remember there were no refrigerators, just iceboxes. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> chicken for dinner, you went to the market and brought home a live chicken, holding it by its feet.|$|R
