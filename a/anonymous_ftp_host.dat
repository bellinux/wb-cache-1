40|$|This brief {{annotated}} bibliography describes a select {{subset of the}} RESOLVE literature, focusing on the most accessible references for the interested reader {{who would like to}} learn more about RESOLVE. A more complete bibliography of RESOLVE papers is available by <b>anonymous</b> <b>FTP</b> from <b>host</b> <b>ftp.</b> cis. ohio-state. edu in the file pub/rsrg/RESOLVE-refs. txt. Most of the papers in this list that are not published in journals or major conference proceedings can be ordered from the National Technical Information Service (NTIS) or from University Microfilms (UMI), as noted, or are available electronically. PostScript versions of all Ohio State University technical reports listed (mostly pre-prints of papers to appear and recent Ph.

Vickers established an <b>anonymous</b> <b>FTP</b> site to <b>host</b> the collected FAQs of the newsgroup. In 1995, Vickers started the TalkOrigins Archive web site as another means of hosting the talk.origins FAQs. It maintains an extensive FAQ on topics in evolutionary biology, geology and astronomy, {{with the aim of}} representing the views of mainstream science. It has spawned other websites, notably TalkDesign [...] "a response to the intelligent design movement", Evowiki, and the Panda's Thumb weblog.|$|R
