In particular, actions of group II muscle, joint and Pacinian <b>afferent</b> <b>fibres</b> and rubro- and corticospinal tract fibres were investigated. Group II muscle <b>afferent</b> <b>fibres</b> evoked excitation and inhibition at a minimal latency compatible with a disynaptic linkage. Increasing the stimulus strength to include group III <b>afferent</b> <b>fibres</b> enhanced these post-synaptic actions only modestly. Inhibition was evoked less frequently and/or required trains of stimuli. Weak {{stimulation of the}} interosseous nerve evoked short latency (disynaptic) inhibition or excitation, the latter less frequently. Post-synaptic potentials evoked below threshold for group III <b>afferent</b> <b>fibres</b> of the interosseous nerve are attributed to the actions of Pacinian corpuscles.

Such contraction discharges, presumed to originate from intrafusal muscle fibre contractions, were not seen in the spastic patients during clonus. During the clonic oscillations each afferent stretch discharge was regularly followed by a stretch reflex contraction which on its falling phase elicited a new volley of impulses in the Ia afferent fibres. The findings are considered to support the notion that, like the contractions in normal voluntary alternating movements, the contractions in tremor of Parkinsonism are organized according to the principle of alpha-gamma coactivation, whereas the contractions in clonus are stretch reflexes causing pure alpha contractions...|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{addressed}} to the following questions: when a muscle nerve is sectioned and regenerates {{to what extent are}} muscle receptors (spindles and tendon organs) reinnervated? is the reinnervation specific? that is, do group Ia and spindle group II fibres preferentially reinnervate spindles and do group Ib fibres preferentially reinnervate tendon organs? what are the consequences to the afferent of failure to re-establish appropriate receptor innervation? In normal cats, and in cats 3, 6 or 9 months after section and resuture of the medial gastrocnemius muscle nerve, medial gastrocnemius afferent fibres in continuity were impaled in dorsal rootlets for recording and stimulation. Receptor innervation was determined electrophysiologically by manipulation of the medial gastrocnemius muscle. <b>Afferent</b> <b>fibre</b> type was determined by the presence (group Ia or spindle group II) or absence (group Ib) of field potentials in the homonymous motoneurone pool in response to activation of the <b>afferent</b> <b>fibre.</b> In normal cats, two-thirds of recorded afferents innervated spindles; 89 % of these generated field potentials detected in the motoneurone pool. One-third of recorded afferents innervated tendon organs; none of these generated such field potentials. In operated cats, about half of the recorded afferents innervated spindles, about one-third responded abnormally or not at all to muscle manipulation, and fewer than one-tenth innervated tendon organs. Numbers of afferents which innervated spindles increased with time. The proportion of afferents generating field potentials was smaller in operated than in normal animals (40 % vs. 60 %) and declined progressively with time. Field potentials were generated by fibres in all categories of receptor reinnervation. This ability was lost at long post-operative intervals by fibres failing to reach the muscle. Conduction velocity of fibres fell in operated animals. Fibres reinnervating their original type of receptor (e. g. group Ia fibre [...] spindle) exhibited greater conduction velocity than fibres innervating an inappropriate receptor or no receptor. From these findings and other considerations (see Discussion) we conclude that following section and resuture of the medial gastrocnemius muscle nerve: about 75 % of afferents regenerate into the medial gastrocnemius muscle, many more spindles than tendon organs become reinnervated, random populations of groups Ia and Ib (and probably spindle group II) fibres reinnervate spindles, fibres which fail to re-establish appropriate receptor innervation also fail to recover normal conduction velocity.

40|$|A {{characteristic}} {{feature of}} hippocampal organisation is the lamina-specific termination of afferent fibres. The factors determining this characteristic fibre segregation are not known. By using slice cultures as a model, we have recently {{demonstrated that the}} laminated termination of hippocampal afferents does not result from the temporal sequence of ingrowth of the various <b>afferent</b> <b>fibre</b> systems during development. Moreover, the lack of extrinsic afferents in culture does not induce a substantial translaminar sprouting of the remaining (intrinsic) fibres or of a defined afferent system supplied by a coculture. These results contrast with previous reports on an expansion of intact fibre systems in the hippocampus in response to partial deafferentation, for instance by removal of entorhinal afferents. We therefore studied the sprouting of commissural fibres following an entorhinal lesion directly by labelling commissural axons in vivo with the anterogradely transported tracer Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin. Sprouting of commissural fibres following an entorhinal lesion was observed but, in accordance with our in vitro observations, this growth of commissural terminals took place within the appropriate termination zones of commissural fibres. These results point to a rigid laminar specificity of hippocampal afferents that is preserved after partial deafferentiation...|$|E

40|$|Lung vagal sensory fibres are broadly {{categorized}} as C fibres (nociceptors) and A fibres (non-nociceptive; rapidly and slowly adapting low-threshold stretch receptors). These <b>afferent</b> <b>fibre</b> types differ in degree of myelination, conduction velocity, neuropeptide content, sensitivity to chemical and mechanical stimuli, {{as well as}} evoked reflex responses. Recent studies in nociceptive fibres of the somatosensory system indicated that the tetrodotoxin-resistant (TTX-R) voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSC) are preferentially expressed in the nociceptive fibres of the somatosensory system (dorsal root ganglia). Whereas TTX-R sodium currents have been documented in lung vagal sensory nerves fibres, a rigorous comparison of their expression in nociceptive versus non-nociceptive vagal sensory neurons has not been carried out. Using multiple approaches including patch clamp electrophysiology, immunohistochemistry, and single-cell gene expression analysis in the guinea pig, we obtained data supporting {{the hypothesis that the}} TTX-R sodium currents are similarly distributed between nodose ganglion A-fibres and C-fibres innervating the lung. Moreover, mRNA and immunoreactivity for the TTX-R VGSC molecules NaV 1. 8 and NaV 1. 9 were present in nearly all neurons.

CO 2 has a mainly depressant action on overall transmission from a forelimb nerve to the midbrain medial lemniscus, and on the excitability of the presynaptic afferent terminals and postsynaptic relay neurones in the cuneate. From an input/output analysis, correlating trans-synaptic responses at the medial lemniscus and antidromic responses at the nerve, {{it was concluded that}} (i) the efficiency of synaptic transmission at individual active synapses was maintained, (ii) the block of afferent transmission was mainly presynaptic. Depression of <b>afferent</b> <b>fibre</b> excitability was greater in the presynaptic terminals than in the dorsal column.

We evaluated the effect of octreotide on responses to noxious colorectal distension in rats.  METHODS—In a behavioural study, pressor and electromyographic responses to colorectal distension were evaluated before and after intravenous or intrathecal administration of octreotide. In pelvic nerve <b>afferent</b> <b>fibre</b> recordings, responses of mechanosensitive fibres innervating the colon to noxious colorectal distension (80  mm Hg, 30  seconds) were tested before and after octreotide.  RESULTS—Octreotide was ineffective in attenuating responses to colorectal distension in either normal or acetic acid inflamed colon when administered intravenously but attenuated responses when given intrathecally. Administration of octreotide over a broad dose range (0. 5  µg/kg to 2. 4  mg/kg) did not alter responses of afferent fibres to noxious colorectal distension in untreated, or acetic acid or zymosan treated colons.  CONCLUSIONS—In the rat, octreotide has no peripheral (pelvic nerve) modulatory action in visceral nociception. The antinociceptive effect of octreotide in this model of visceral nociception is mediated by an action at central sites.    Keywords: octreotide; colorectal distension; electromyographic responses; afferent fibres; visceral pain; analgesic effect; ra...|$|E

Of 588 terminal boutons that were counted in the compact caudal part of the Me 5 nucleus, less than 8 % formed synapses on the somata of the predominantly unipolar Me 5 neurons. About 79 % formed synapses on fibres located between the Me 5 somata, while about 13 % of the vesicle-containing terminals had no clear synaptic specialization. All of these non-synaptic terminals were G type boutons, with pleomorphic and large characteristic dense-core vesicles. Approximately 60 % of the axosomatic synapses were of the S type, containing spherical vesicles and an asymmetrical or symmetrical synaptic specialization. About 20, respectively 15 % of the axosomatic synapses, were of the F, respectively P type; both are symmetrical synapse types containing either a majority of flat or pleomorphic vesicles. Less than 10 % of the axosomatic synapses were of the G type.

In all of these investigations the thermal effect was studied {{in terms of the}} change in the number of impulses per second in the afferent nerve fibre connected to the sense organ, or more precisely to the sensory cells. It was shown that the frequency of afferent impulses changes when the temperatures at the receptor site varies, e. g. lowering the temperature (—AT ° C.) provokes a temporary increase of frequency ('paradoxical ' thermal effect; see Sand, 1938) and the final frequency after this temporary effect is positively correlated with the decreased temperature (- T ° C.)

D. r. p. s were recorded from the dorsal rootlet that entered the spinal cord in the main area of termination of the tibial nerve. The location of this area was assessed by mapping the spinal cord in the rostro-caudal axis while recording cord dorsum potentials evoked by A-fibre volleys from the tibial nerve. No differences in peak amplitude, area or time to peak amplitude were observed between the d. r. p. s evoked in control and capsaicin-treated rats by stimulation of the tibial, sural or common peroneal nerves. The relation between the size of incoming A volleys to the spinal cord {{and the size of}} the d. r. p. s evoked by them was unaffected by the neonatal capsaicin treatment. Rats treated at birth with capsaicin showed a virtual absence of <b>afferent</b> C <b>fibres</b> as assessed from the lack of C waves in the compound action potentials evoked in each of the three nerves studied after antidromic stimulation of the dorsal roots. The presence of p. a. d. in control and in capsaicin-treated animals was also established using the technique of excitability testing of primary <b>afferent</b> <b>fibres</b> (Wall, 1958).

There were those responding to mucosal stroking (mucosal receptors), to circular tension (tension receptors) and those responding to mucosal stroking and circular tension, which we have termed tension/mucosal (TM) receptors. The conduction velocities for mucosal, TM and tension receptor fibres were 6. 38 ± 1. 22 m s− 1 (n = 22), 6. 20 ± 1. 49 m s− 1 (n = 13) and 5. 33 ± 0. 86 m s− 1 (n = 22), respectively. Receptive fields of afferents showed random topographical distribution by fibre type and conduction velocity.

Exposure of rats’ tails to UVA-light caused hyperalgesia to a noxious thermal challenge, immersion of the rats’ tails into 49 °C water, and a noxious mechanical challenge, application of a static force of 3. 9 N by a bar algometer onto the rats’ tails. The hyperalgesia to the thermal challenge lasted eight days and hyperalgesia to the mechanical challenge continued for up to 16 days. Despite the sustained hyperalgesia, rats exposed to UVA-light showed no overt signs of morbidity as they gained weight normally and were mobile throughout the study. Histological examination of rat tail tissue showed mild, chronic inflammation in rats exposed to UVA-light and in rats that had their tails covered with a protective layer of aluminium foil during UVA-light exposure. This inflammation was therefore not responsible for the behavioural hyperalgesia.

Thus, {{to better understand the}} mechanisms to optimize this process, we studied the role of the neuropeptide oxytocin (previously shown to stimulate locomotor networks) on network and motoneuron properties using the isolated neonatal rat spinal cord. On motoneurons oxytocin (1 nM– 1 mM) generated sporadic bursts with superimposed firing and dose-dependent depolarization. No desensitization was observed despite repeated applications. Tetrodotoxin completely blocked the effects of oxytocin, demonstrating the network origin of the responses. Recording motoneuron pool activity from lumbar ventral roots showed oxytocin mediated depolarization with synchronous bursts, and depression of reflex responses in a stimulus and peptide-concentration dependent fashion. Disinhibited bursting caused by strychnine and bicuculline was accelerated by oxytocin whose action was blocked by the oxytocin antagonist atosiban. Fictive locomotion appeared when subthreshold concentrations of NMDA plus 5 HT were coapplied with oxytocin, an effect prevented after 24 h incubation with the inhibitor of 5 HT synthesis, PCPA. When fictive locomotion was fully manifested, oxytocin did not change periodicity, although cycle amplitude became smaller.

40|$|The Na+ −K+ − 2 Cl− cotransporter NKCC 1 is {{expressed}} in sensory neurons where it accumulates intracellular Cl− and facilitates primary afferent depolarization. Depolarization of primary <b>afferent</b> <b>fibre</b> terminals interferes with the gating of incoming sensory signals to the spinal cord. The cotransporter belongs to a family of ion transporters which are sensitive to changes in cell volume. Cell shrinkage, through mechanisms that are still unknown, leads to the phosphorylation and activation of NKCC 1. Similarly, axotomy results in increased NKCC 1 phosphorylation in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. This review summarizes {{the work on the}} kinases that directly mediate NKCC 1 activation. These are the sterile- 20 -like kinases SPAK and OSR 1. Upon their activation through phosphorylation by upstream kinases, SPAK and OSR 1 bind to specific peptides located in the cytosolic N-terminal tail of NKCC 1, phosphorylate, and stimulate cotransport activity. Expression of SPAK and OSR 1 varies from tissue to tissue, but in DRG neurons and in spinal cord, SPAK and OSR 1 expression levels are similar. In DRG neurons, both kinases participate in the modulation of NKCC 1, as the knockdown of one kinase only results in a partial decrease of NKCC 1 function, while the knockdown of both kinases is additive. The identity of the kinases (e. g. WNK kinases) that possibly act upstream of SPAK and OSR 1 is also discussed...|$|E
40|$|The gain of {{the spike}} encoder at the <b>afferent</b> <b>fibre</b> {{terminal}} constitutes {{the last step}} in signal processing at the semicircular canal. To estimate the encoder properties EPSPs and spikes were intracellularly recorded, at rest and during rotation, from single fibres of the posterior nerve in the isolated labyrinth. The recordings were fed into the computer and analyzed. The spike frequency (encoder output) was determined and, after digital subtraction of the spikes, the EPSP rate (encoder input) was evaluated {{by means of a}} procedure of fluctuation analysis. In the examined units the main features of EPSP and spike responses can be summarized as follows: 1) resting spike rates were generally low (< 3 spikes/s); 2) during excitation, while the EPSP rate was rising, the spike rate increased even faster; 3) the decline in the spike rate, after the excitatory peak, anticipated that of the EPSP rate; 4) fibres with low resting spike rates showed marked rectification of the response (silencing of spike rate during inhibition). It follows that the relation between spike and EPSP rates (encoder gain) is not linear, leading to amplification of the asymmetry in the response and rectification by the encoder. The dynamic behaviour of the encoder is also complex and determines a phase lead in the spike rate larger than that observed in the EPSP rate with respect to angular velocity...|$|E
40|$|Potassium {{transport}} by dark cells produces marked K-concentration {{differences between}} endo- and perilymphatic fluids in labyrinthine organs and generates the transepithelial potential. The ensuing electrochemical potential for K sustains the transduction current which regulates {{activity at the}} cytoneural junction. Clofilium, a compound which is known to block cardiac K channels and to decrease the endocochlear potential, {{was applied to the}} endolymphatic side of the isolated frog semicircular canal. The drug abolished the transepithelial potential and increased K outflux from the lumen to the dark cells (or the basolateral perilymph) with no apparent interference with active K secretion. When applied to the perilymphatic side in the intact labyrinth, clofilium reduced the rate of occurrence of miniature excitatory postsynaptic potentials (mEPSPs), both at rest and in response to mechanical stimulation (sinusoidal rotation at 0. 1 Hz, 12. 5 deg/s 2 peak acceleration). This effect may be related to a reduced K-electrochemical unbalance and a decreased transduction current. The drug consistently reduced mEPSP size, although amplitude distributions remained log-normal and time intervals between successive mEPSPs remained exponentially distributed; this suggests a direct effect of clofilium on the postsynaptic membrane, in addition to any possible presynaptic effects. Spike discharge by the <b>afferent</b> <b>fibre</b> was almost completely abolished at rest and responses to mechanical stimulation were reduced by 85 - 90 %. These effects cannot be accounted for by the mild reduction of mEPSP rates and confirm a direct action of clofilium on the afferent postsynaptic terminal...|$|E
40|$|Peripheral nerves arising {{in joint}} {{capsules}} {{are known to}} contain a ‘contaminating’ contribution from muscle <b>afferent</b> <b>fibres.</b> In the present report we provide the first electrophysiological evidence that some joint <b>afferent</b> <b>fibres</b> may take an ‘ectopic’ path to {{the central nervous system}} via a nearby muscle nerve. Experiments were conducted in anaesthetized cats in which a distal extension of the indicis proprius nerve was observed to project beyond its own muscle to the dorsal surface of the wrist joint capsule which is also supplied by the ‘classic’ wrist joint nerve, a branch of the dorsal interosseous nerve. Both the proximal and distal segments of the indicis proprius nerve were exposed for recording, by means of silver hook electrodes, while each segment remained in continuity. Individual wrist joint <b>afferent</b> <b>fibres</b> with receptive fields on the dorsal surface of the joint capsule could be identified electrophysiologically within the distal segment of the indicis proprius nerve. In each of these cases the same fibre could also be identified at the proximal recording site. The identity of each of these simultaneously recorded units was established (1) by the short fixed interval between their times of spike occurrence, (2) from the exact correspondence of the capsular receptive field for the simultaneously recorded spikes, and (3) by the unfailing correlation in the presence, or absence, of the distally and proximally recorded spikes in association with either manual or controlled stimulation of the wrist joint capsule. Most joint <b>afferent</b> <b>fibres</b> identified with this projection path were in the group II range of conduction velocities and had conventional properties but group III fibres also appeared to be represented. The present demonstration that some joint <b>afferent</b> <b>fibres</b> may be located within ‘muscle’ nerves emphasizes the importance of activating deep inputs, of joint or muscle origin, by adequate stimulation of the peripheral receptors in order to examine selectively the central actions of either source of input. Electrical stimulation of the peripheral nerves may lead to interpretative ambiguities...|$|R

The first component of the blink reflex has been demonstrated in patients with Friedreich's ataxia, who have selective loss of large sensory fibres resulting in loss of proprioceptive input. It has been established that both components of the blink reflex are cutaneous reflexes which represent a highly organized and purposeful mechanism in man. <b>Afferent</b> <b>fibres</b> for the blink reflex have been identified in the human supraorbital nerve and their conduction velocity has been estimated {{for the first time in}} man.
