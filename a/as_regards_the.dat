5|$|<b>As</b> <b>regards</b> <b>the</b> first question, in Borissik v. Urban Redevelopment Authority (2009), the Singapore High Court adopted four {{conditions}} {{set out in}} De Smith's Judicial Review (6th ed., 2007) {{to determine}} whether a legitimate expectation has been created. The public body's representation must be clear, unambiguous and devoid of any relevant qualification; induced by the conduct of the decision-maker; made by a person with actual or ostensible authority; and applicable to the applicant, who belongs to the class of persons to whom the representation is reasonably expected to apply.|$|E

5|$|Although he feuded with York {{over the}} primacy, it appears clear that Ralph {{considered}} the Investiture Crisis settled in England for, in 1117 while visiting Rome, {{he took a}} neutral position <b>as</b> <b>regards</b> <b>the</b> issues between the Pope and the Emperor. In 1115, however, he refused to consecrate Bernard as Bishop of St David's in the royal chapel, although Robert of Meulan, the king's chief counsellor, advocated that the consecration must {{take place in the}} royal chapel according to ancient custom. The king did not insist and Ralph won the confrontation. He was also involved in ecclesiastical affairs in Normanday, as he attended the provincial synod, or Council of Rouen, held in 1118.|$|E
5|$|As English courts do {{not form}} part of Singapore's {{hierarchy}} of courts, decisions of such courts are not binding on Singapore courts. However, {{as a result of}} Singapore's colonial heritage, English judicial precedents continue to exercise a strong influence on the legal system and are regarded as highly persuasive, particularly <b>as</b> <b>regards</b> <b>the</b> development of the common law, and the interpretation of English statutes applicable in Singapore and Singapore statutes modelled on English enactments. Judicial precedents from other jurisdictions may also be persuasive in specific areas of Singapore law. For instance, Indian decisions are persuasive in the areas of criminal law and procedure because Singapore borrowed heavily from India in these areas.|$|E
5|$|In 802, Harun and {{the most}} {{powerful}} officials of the Abbasid government made the pilgrimage to Mecca, where the definitive succession arrangement was drawn up: al-Amin would succeed Harun in Baghdad, but al-Ma'mun would remain al-Amin's heir and would additionally rule over an enlarged and practically independent Khurasan. A third son, al-Qasim (al-Mu'tamin), was also added as third heir and received responsibility over the frontier areas with the Byzantine Empire. The stipulations of the agreement, extensively recorded by the historian al-Tabari, may however have been distorted by later apologists of al-Ma'mun, especially <b>as</b> <b>regards</b> <b>the</b> extent of the autonomy granted to al-Ma'mun's eastern viceroyalty.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the Court of Appeal's judgment can be interpreted in one of two ways: that the exercise of a power is not amenable to judicial review either if it has no public element altogether, or if it has an insufficient public element. Neither of these interpretations is without complications. <b>As</b> <b>regards</b> <b>the</b> first interpretation, {{it may be difficult to}} conceive of an exercise of statutory power that has no public element at all. If the second interpretation is correct, there is doubt as to the level of sufficiency required for the exercise of a power to be amenable to judicial review as the Court did not explain this.|$|E
5|$|Related {{to this is}} Article 16, {{subsection}} (1) {{of which}} prohibits discrimination against citizens of Singapore on the ground only of, among others, religion {{in the administration of}} public educational institutions (and, in particular, <b>as</b> <b>regards</b> <b>the</b> admission of students or the payment of fees), and in providing financial aid from public funds for the maintenance or education of students in any educational institution. The Constitution declares that religious groups have the right to establish and maintain institutions for the education of children and to provide them religious instruction in those institutions, but provides that people cannot be discriminated against on the ground only of religion in laws relating to such institutions or the administration of such laws. Furthermore, no person may be compelled to receive instruction in or take part in any ceremony or act of worship of a religion apart from his or her own.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Appeal {{suggested}} that, in {{the light}} of Chng Suan Tze, the validity of an order for preventive detention made by the Minister under section 30 of the CLTPA is dependent on the objective satisfaction of the Minister. Moreover, in Re Wong Sin Yee (2007), which also involved judicial review of an applicant's detention under section 30 of the CLTPA, the High Court, following the decision in Chng Suan Tze, held that the absence of the need to establish a jurisdictional or precedent fact meant that the scope of judicial review <b>as</b> <b>regards</b> <b>the</b> exercise of the Minister's discretion under section 30 was limited to the GCHQ grounds of judicial review. The Court thus applied an objective test to the subjectively worded powers in section 30; if it Court had applied a subjective test, it would have deferred to the subjective satisfaction of the Minister that the detention was in the interests of public safety, peace and good order.|$|E

Honest hard work, and some cunning in the method of his eloquence, had at first sufficed him. He was not called upon to have, or at any rate to state, any marked political tenets. But no man can rise to great note as a lawyer without a party. Opulence without note would by no means have sufficed with Mr. Harcourt.|$|R

5|$|The {{presence}} of judicial {{members on the}} Council may also pose additional problems. There is a possibility of conflict of interest for judges who sit {{as members of the}} Council if they find themselves having to review the very Acts of Parliament that they have either endorsed or rejected previously. This is exacerbated {{by the fact that the}} Council, in examining the legitimacy of Bills, plays a quasi-judicial role. There may be confusion <b>as</b> <b>regards</b> <b>the</b> legality of a piece of legislation if, for example, it was initially condemned by the Council but enacted by the Government and later endorsed by the courts upon judicial review. When the potential conflict between the Chief Justice's role as head of the judiciary and as Chairman of the Council was raised in 2010 by Githu Muigai, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Contemporary Forms of Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Tolerance, he was informed that the Chief Justice would recuse himself from any matter in which a conflict arose.|$|E
5|$|Garcia de Orta was {{responsible}} for building the manor-house (Bombay Castle) in Bombay. He also mentioned several accounts of the islands and {{the people living in}} Bombay during his time. During his regime, <b>as</b> <b>regards</b> <b>the</b> population of the island, Bombay was composed of seven villages subordinate to two cacabas (kashas) or chief stations, at which customs-duty was levied. These villages were Mahim, Parel, Varella (Wadala) and Syva (Sion) under the kasba (chief officer) of Mahim, and Mazagaon, Bombaim (Bombay), and Varel (Worli) under the kasba (chief officer) of Bombay. In addition to these, there were smaller hamlets like Cavel, Colaba, Naigaon and Dongri, which had existed from the epoch of indigenous Hindu settlement. The Kolis, a fishing community, formed the most numerous class of people, and dwelt in most parts of Bombay from Colaba in the south to Sion and Mahim in the north. Other Hindu communities residing were, the Kunbis and Agris (Curumbins) (who cultivated the fields and sowed them with rice and all sorts of pulse), the Malis (who tended the orchards), and the Piaes (men-at-arms) (who were Bhandaris). The Parus (Prabhus) dwelt in Mahim, Bombay, and Parel. They collected the rents of the King and of the inhabitants and their estates, and were also merchants. The Muslim Moors in Bombay were solely engaged in maritime trade. A few Muslims of less mixed descent were living in Mahim, but the bulk of the followers of Islam belonged to the Konkani Muslim community. Christians residing in Bombay during his time included eleven Roman Catholic Portuguese families of married men. The other three communities mentioned by Orta as residents in Bassein and its surrounding tracts were Baneanes (Banias), Coaris or Esparcis (Parsis), and Deres (Dheds or Mahars) or Farazes. Most Banias and Parsis did not actually settle in Bombay until after its cession to England by the Portuguese. Bombay apparently remained in Orta's possession until his peaceful death in Goa in 1570. Several years later, his bones were exhumed and burnt at the stake for his Jewish faith. The islands appears to have been granted on the same tenure to several Portuguese officials in succession.|$|E
5|$|However, Purcell's music (and with it The Fairy-Queen) was resuscitated by {{two related}} movements: a growing {{interest}} in Baroque music {{and the rise of}} the countertenor, led by pioneers such as Alfred Deller and Russell Oberlin. The former movement led to performances of long-neglected composers such as Purcell, John Dowland, John Blow and even George Frideric Handel, while the latter complemented it by providing a way of making such performances as authentic as possible <b>as</b> <b>regards</b> <b>the</b> original music and the composer's intentions (less true for Handel, where countertenors appear as castrati replacements). This has led to The Fairy-Queen's increased popularity, and numerous recordings have been made, often using period instruments. The format of the work presents problems to modern directors, who must decide whether or not to present Purcell's music as part of the original play, which uncut is rather lengthy. Savage calculated a length of four hours. The decision to curtail the play is usually taken together with the resolution to modernise to such an extent that the cohesion between music, text and action sketched above is entirely lost, a criticism levelled at the English National Opera's 1995 production directed by David Pountney. The production was released on video the same year, and revived by the company in 2002. A bold approach was taken at the Brazilian Opera Company's 2000 staging by Luiz PÃ¤etow, with the libretto becoming unstuck in time.|$|E
