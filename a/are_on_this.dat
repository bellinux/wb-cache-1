5|$|The Mainland is {{the largest}} island of Orkney. Both of Orkney's burghs, Kirkwall and Stromness, <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> island, {{which is also the}} heart of Orkney's {{transportation}} system, with ferry and air connections to the other islands and to the outside world. The island is more densely populated (75% of Orkney's population) than the other islands and has much fertile farmland. The Mainland is split into areas called East and West Mainland. These areas are determined by whether they lie East or West of Kirkwall. The bulk of the mainland lies West of Kirkwall, with comparatively little land lying East of Kirkwall.|$|E

Carroll's Homewood House {{is considered one of}} the finest examples of Federal residential architecture. The estate then came to the Wyman family, which participated in making it the park-like main campus of the schools of arts and sciences and engineering at the start of the 20th century. Most of its architecture was modeled after the Federal style of Homewood House. Homewood House is preserved as a museum. Most undergraduate programs <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> campus.|$|E
500|$|The Atlas of Oregon ranks 31 {{rivers in}} the state by average streamflow; the top five are the Columbia, Snake, Willamette, Santiam, and Umpqua.

On the other hand, the list includes four low-flow intermittent streams—Dry River, Rattlesnake Creek, Rock Creek, and Dry Creek—that cross parts of the Oregon High Desert.|$|E
500|$|... "The Master Plan" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Matt Fowler of IGN {{said the}} budget problems created strong character development potential for Leslie and comedic opportunities for Ron. Fowler also enjoyed that the normally-dissolute Tom formed an authentic romantic connection, and said Chris Pratt brought [...] "a certain naturalness" [...] to {{a role that}} could otherwise have been overly idiotic. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club strongly praised the episode, praising Rob Lowe and the entire regular cast. He declared Parks and Recreation the best television show since Arrested Development, and said, [...] "As much as I like the '50 jokes a minute' style of comedies ... I'm a sucker for a show where the characters are as well-wrought and as purely funny as they <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> show." [...] HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall praised {{the implementation of the}} new characters, particularly the fact that the script did not rely too heavily on them. Sepinwall also said the episode balanced well the workplace humor with the romantic subplots between Leslie and Ben, April and Andy, and Ann and Chris.|$|E

[...] "This Is How We Do", produced by Max Martin and Klas Ahlund, was described as being the possible [...] "song of summer" [...] for 2014. Shirley Halperin from The Hollywood Reporter described [...] "This Is How We Do" [...] as [...] "a sunny 80s throwback", while Edna Gundersen from USA Today {{described it as a}} [...] "buoyant pop blast with hip-hop underpinnings" [...] and praised the song's recurring refrain ("It's no big deal!"). James Montgomery from MTV News called the song a [...] "cocksure, club-ready banger". With [...] "Double Rainbow", produced by Greg Kustin and co-writer Sia Furler, Perry was allowed to [...] "dump pent-up emotions" [...] and [...] "get things off her chest". The song was described as a [...] "massive ballad". Lipshutz deemed it as a [...] "breathy love track" [...] with a [...] "powerful chorus that explodes upon impact" [...] with lyrics that include [...] "One man's trash is another man's treasure / so if it's up to me, I'm gonna keep you forever". He added that [...] "Kurstin brings the pop sensibility he's flashed with artists like Kelly Clarkson and P!nk, while Sia's presence connects this sleek, shimmering pop track to [...] 'Titanium'".

2500|$|The {{organisation}} {{was unique}} {{in the history of}} the Camorra in that it was highly centralised and possessed a rudimentary form of ideology. For example, he publicly declared that children were not to be kidnapped or mistreated and allegedly arranged the assassination of at least one kidnapper. Perhaps the most potent ideological weapon was the cult of violence, which sometimes bordered on a kind of death wish, as Cutolo once wrote: [...] "the value of a life doesn’t consist of its length but in the use made of it; often people live a long time without living very much. Consider this, my friends, as long as you <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> earth everything depends on your will-power, not on the number of years you have lived." ...|$|E

[...] Prompted by Scull's insistent and promiscuous wife Inez, Governor Pease sends Call and McCrae out in charge of another typically small Ranger troop to rescue Captain Scull.

[...] The Civil War takes most of the soldiers away from the frontier, enabling the Comanches to push back the white settlers. [...] After the Civil War, Call and McCrae are sent in pursuit of Blue Duck and his band of renegades. Buffalo Hump has gone off to die. [...] Blue Duck hears of this and leaves his cutthroats to pursue his father. The Rangers attack his band, but Blue Duck, having left, evades capture. [...] He finds his father at his chosen place of death and kills him there. Maggie dies while the Rangers <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> expedition.|$|E

2500|$|The St. Paul {{campus is}} {{in the city of}} Falcon Heights, about [...] away from the Minneapolis campus. The default place name for the ZIP code serving the campus is [...] "St. Paul", but [...] "Falcon Heights" [...] is also {{recognized}} for use in the street addresses of all campus buildings. The College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences, including the University of Minnesota Food Industry Center and many other disciplines from social sciences to vocational education <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> campus.

There are campus connectors running every 5 minutes on the weekdays when school is in session, and every 20 minutes on weekends, allowing students easy access to both campuses.|$|E
2500|$|Here {{is a list}} {{of items}} on the canal, as a canaller {{traveling}} by boat from Georgetown to Cumberland would see. (Note: some present day items <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> list also.) A typical canaller would know the canal by the names of the levels and the locks. Most list of points of the canal's points of interest do not contain a list of the levels with their names like we have here. Also note that most lists of locks do not include Guard Locks 4 and 5, which a boat would have to pass through, if navigating the entire canal (It was generally possible for boats to pass through the other guard locks also, but that is {{if they were going to}} other destinations, usually on the Virginia/West Virginia side of the river). Also note sometimes there are often slight discrepancies in mileages, for instance NPS and Hahn reports Lock 75 at 175.60 miles, Davies lists [...] "175.35 (175.50)", and Hahn also reports the NPS mile markers are in the wrong place from Milepost 117 to Lock 51, further adding to the confusion. Also note that Some streets in Georgetown were renamed, mostly as numbered streets, pursuant to an 1895 law. See Georgetown street renaming.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the largest}} N scale layouts {{in the world is}} located at the San Diego Model Railroad Museum. Pacific Desert Lines [...] is a [...] layout {{featuring}} hand-laid code 40 rail. Each piece of rail is [...] (forty thousandths) high and is manually affixed to the roadbed by solder to copper-clad ties placed every 5th tie. About [...] (scale miles, actually [...] ) of mainline track <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> massive layout, as well as over 500 hand-made turnouts. Many models of local San Diego structures can be identified on the layout, including an intricate scale model of San Diego's Santa Fe Depot, the Western Metal Supply Building, the Carrizo Gorge's Goat Canyon Trestle, Palomar Observatory, the American Agar building, and the Carlsbad, California flower fields and power plant. The model of the Santa Fe depot was constructed using the actual building's blueprints and has been featured on the cover of Model Railroader magazine. The Spanish revival architecture is reproduced using epoxy castings of scale model adobe roof tiles. The Western Metal Supply Building (now part of the left field foul line in the San Diego Padres' Petco Park) was constructed using historic photographs and contains brick castings, brass-etched fire escapes, and computer-generated window panes. The detail on the Goat Canyon Trestle includes the prototype's railings, catwalks, and fire suppression system. The power plant contains fibre-optic strobe lights in its chimney. Many buildings have detailed interiors, right down to the napkin dispenser and placemats on the tables at the corner cafe. Some surfers appear in the water off the coast. The layout can be operated by manual or computer control. Trains can run completely unattended or a single operator can control the layout with the click of a mouse.|$|E
