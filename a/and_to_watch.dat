5|$|This crisis had {{its roots}} in the Great Powers' {{competition}} for colonies in the last decades of the 19th century. The German Empire, invigorated by its victory over France in the Franco-Prussian War and by its unification under the Prussian monarchy, had newfound imperial ambitions that stretched beyond Europe. It had shared in the division of Africa, and in the 1880s looked to the Pacific as well. Ships of its Imperial Navy were sent to Apia in Samoa, where German agents had fomented rebellion against the indigenous government. They were countered there by the Asiatic Squadron of the United States Navy. The United States had nearly completed establishing control over its territories on the North American continent, leading American ambitions to stretch beyond its shores. The squadron was at Samoa to assert US interests in the Pacific <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> the Germans.|$|E

25|$|In July 1987, {{faced with}} growing anger among its own Tamils and {{a flood of}} refugees, India intervened {{directly}} in the conflict {{for the first time}} by initially airdropping food parcels into Jaffna. After negotiations, India and Sri Lanka entered into the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord. Though the conflict was between the Tamil and Sinhalese people, India and Sri Lanka signed the peace accord instead of India influencing both parties to sign a peace accord among themselves. The peace accord assigned a certain degree of regional autonomy in the Tamil areas, with Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF) controlling the regional council and called for the Tamil militant groups to surrender. India was to send a peacekeeping force, named the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF), part of the Indian Army, to Sri Lanka to enforce the disarmament <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> over the regional council.|$|E
25|$|A record 160,000 fans {{arrived at}} Atlanta Motor Speedway to witness Petty's final ride, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> the {{exciting}} championship battle. At the start, polesitter, Rick Mast and Brett Bodine battled into turn 1, with Bodine leading the first lap. On lap 2, the two cars tangled, and crashed in turn 1. Dale Earnhardt, {{who was running}} third, slipped by, and took over the lead. Several other cars were collected in the crash, and five of the championship contenders got through unscathed. Davey Allison, however, slowed to avoid the crash, and was tagged from behind in the left rear by Hut Stricklin. The left rear fender was badly bent, but did not puncture the tire. Allison stayed out on the track, and the crew {{would be able to}} bend the bodywork away from the tire on the next pit stop.|$|E

25|$|Eugène {{commanded}} 70,000 Franco-Italian {{troops in}} his Army of Italy. Of his six French and three Italian infantry divisions, only two defended the Soča (Isonzo) River near the eastern frontier, {{while the rest}} were scattered across the Kingdom of Italy. On 16 April 1809, an overconfident Eugène gave battle with only one cavalry and five infantry divisions, about 35,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry. At the Battle of Sacile, John's invading army mauled Eugène's army, inflicting 6,500 casualties for a loss of only 3,600. The defeated Army of Italy fell back to Verona on the Adige River gathering reinforcements until it had accumulated 60,000 soldiers. After John detached forces to besiege the Osoppo and Palmanova fortresses, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> the large French garrison of Venice, the Austrian army arrived before Verona with only 30,000 troops on 28 April. After hearing of the main Austrian army's defeat at the Battle of Eckmühl on 22 April, Emperor Francis I of Austria ordered his brother Archduke John to retreat to Inner Austria.|$|E
25|$|In Lithuania, President Antanas Smetona {{doubted that}} it was worth gaining Vilnius for such a price and debated whether the {{negotiations}} could be broken off. Bizauskas argued that refusing the treaty would not prevent Soviet Union from implementing its plan. Soviet Union had already threatened Estonia with force in case it refused its mutual assistance treaty and was gathering forces in Vilnius Region {{in the east and}} in Latvia in the north. In such light, the government decided to demand as much territory as possible. However, when the delegation returned to Moscow, it found the atmosphere changed. Soviets were inflexible, refused further negotiations, and intimidated the delegation to sign the treaty. They presented a new draft, which combined the mutual assistance pact and transfer of Vilnius into one agreement. The Lithuanian delegation saw little choice but to sign the proposed treaty. After signing the treaty, Stalin invited the Lithuanian delegation to celebrate <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> two movies with him. Urbšys informed the Lithuanian government about signing of the treaty only in the morning of October 11 – at the time the treaty was already published by Soviet news agency TASS.|$|E
25|$|The {{damage the}} French Trans-Atlantic fleet had {{suffered}} in the winter operation took months to repair {{and it was not}} in a condition to sail again until June 1795, although several squadrons had put to sea in the meanwhile. One such squadron consisted of three ships of the line and a number of frigates under Contre-Amiral Jean Gaspard Vence sent to Bordeaux to escort a merchant convoy up the coast to Brest. The British Channel Fleet had briefly sortied from Torbay in February in response to the Croisière du Grand Hiver and subsequently retired to Spithead, from where a squadron of five ships of the line and two frigates were sent on 30 May to patrol the approaches to Brest <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> the French fleet. The force consisted of the 100-gun first-rate ship of the line HMS Royal Sovereign, the 74-gun ships of the line HMS Mars, HMS Triumph, HMS Brunswick and HMS Bellerophon, the frigates HMS Phaeton and HMS Pallas and the small brig-sloop HMS Kingfisher, under the overall command of Vice-Admiral William Cornwallis in Royal Sovereign. Cornwallis was a highly experienced naval officer who had been in service with the Navy since 1755 and fought in the Seven Years' War and the American Revolutionary War, including the significant naval victories over the French at the Battle of Quiberon Bay in 1759 and the Battle of the Saintes in 1782.|$|E

He elaborated, [...] "To watch an umpire take responsibility <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> a pitcher do what he did, the type of sportsmanship that was exhibited there—I think that gives a lot of heart (...) I think it's tremendously heartening to see somebody understand that {{they made a mistake}} and somebody accept the apology from somebody who made that mistake. I think that's a good lesson in baseball." [...] Michigan state Governor Jennifer Granholm also issued a gubernatorial proclamation stating, in part, [...] "I, Jennifer M.

500|$|The 2012 Summer Games marked Sherab Zam's Olympic debut. She was {{the flag}} bearer {{at both the}} opening and closing ceremonies. She {{qualified}} for the individual archery competition after receiving a wildcard from the Tripartite Commission. In an interview with Reuters before the games Zam said that [...] "Participation {{is more important than}} winning a medal." [...] Zam spent time in South Korea and India preparing for the games. The archery events at the 2012 games were held at the Lord's Cricket Ground. Zam competed on 27 July in the ranking round, finishing 61st out of 64 competitors with 589 points. She scored 82 points less than the leading competitor, Ki Bo-bae of South Korea. Zam competed against American Khatuna Lorig, the fourth ranking athlete in the ranking round, in the round of 64. Lorig beat Zam three sets to none in about six minutes. This meant Zam was eliminated from the competition. After the games Zam said: [...] "I am not that good at archery but I love it. It was so good to meet world ranking archers who are famous <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> how they do it. I have learnt a lot from them," [...] and that, [...] "When I grew up I never dreamt I would come to London, let alone compete in an Olympics. This just shows that anything is possible.

500|$|The East Persian Cordon (later {{called the}} Seistan Force), {{consisting}} of British Indian Army troops, {{was established in}} the Sistan province of south-east Persia to prevent the Germans from crossing into Afghanistan and to protect British supply caravans in Sarhad from Damani, Reki, and Kurdish Balushi tribes who might be tempted by German gold. The 2nd Quetta Brigade, a small force maintained in Western Balochistan {{since the beginning of the}} war, was expanded in July 1915 and became the East Persia Cordon, with troops stationed from Russian Turkestan to Baluchistan. A similar Russian cordon was established to prevent infiltration into north-west Afghanistan. From March 1916 the force was renamed the Seistan Force, under the direction of General George Macaulay Kirkpatrick, the Chief of the General Staff in India. The cordon was initially under the command of Colonel J. M. Wilkeley before it was taken over by Reginald Dyer in February 1916. The cordon's task was to [...] "intercept, capture or destroy any German parties attempting to enter Sistan or Afghanistan", to establish an intelligence system, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> the Birjand-Merked road. Persian subjects were not to be targeted as long as they were not accompanying Germans or acting as their couriers, and as long as Persia remained neutral. Following the Revolution in Russia, the Malleson Mission was sent to Trans-Caspia and the Seistan Force became the main line of communication for the mission. With the withdrawal of the force from Trans-Caspia, the troops in Persia were withdrawn; the last elements left in November 1920.|$|E
2500|$|In June, 1964, Austrian-American fashion {{designer}} Rudi Gernreich introduced a topless swimsuit called the monokini that generated {{a great deal}} of controversy in the United States and internationally. During Gernrich's youth, some Austrians advocated nude exercising, which gave him this fashion idea. The Vatican denounced the swimsuit, and L'Osservatore Romano said the [...] "industrial-erotic adventure" [...] of the topless bathing suit [...] "negates moral sense." [...] In Italy and Spain the church warned against the topless fashion. At Saint-Tropez, the mayor ordered police to ban toplessness <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> over the beach via helicopter.|$|E

A large model was built and a large-scale map produced for officers and men to study and reconnaissance was conducted by officers and staffs to see the ground up to the objective. The divisional artillery was reinforced with the 25th Divisional artillery, three army field brigades, a counter-battery double-group, (one with , [...] and [...] howitzers, the other with [...] and [...] guns) a double bombardment group (one group with [...] and [...] howitzers, the other with , [...] and [...] howitzers).

2500|$|Socially, {{the estate}} failed {{to develop into}} a {{community}} and the residents were in poor economic situations. The start {{of the decline of}} the estate began in the 1970s when crime rates started to increase. Rent pay was initially collected from the 'rent man' who went from door-to-door, but muggings meant the service was withdrawn in the mid to late-1970s and rent had to be collected from the local post office in the shopping centre. Drug dealing also started becoming prominent in the late-1970s, with violent incidents also increasing in number. The problems continued into the 1980s with the top of Concorde Tower becoming a popular vantage point for teenagers to watch joyriders speed along the straight main roads (often in stolen cars), <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> the police chase them. Castle Vale had six pubs, (Trade Winds, Albatross, Trees, Skylark, Artful Dodger and Lancaster), but all had closed by 1996, having been associated with drug dealing for a long time.|$|E

Shore then based his orchestrations around Enya's recorded vocals and themes to create [...] "a seamless sound".
