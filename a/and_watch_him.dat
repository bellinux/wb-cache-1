5|$|Ip {{figures out}} that Lin was beaten {{and killed by}} the Japanese after an earlier fight. Barely able to contain his rage, Ip demands a match with ten karateka at once. Despite having not practiced Wing Chun since the Japanese {{occupied}} their town (to conserve energy and thus food for his family), he mercilessly defeats all of them with a brutal and effective barrage of blows, showing none of the restraint he exhibited in earlier matches. His skill arouses the interest of General Miura, who wants {{to learn more about}} Ip <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>him</b> fight again.|$|E
25|$|Norman {{had another}} four wins in Australia in 1988. In the U.S., Norman won the MCI Heritage Golf Classic at Hilton Head Island, South Carolina in April 1988, {{inspired}} by a leukemia-stricken teenager who got his wish to meet Norman <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>him</b> play. The teenager was only supposed to watch the golfer for two rounds, but Norman arranged for him to stay until the tournament's completion. After the tournament, Norman awarded the teen with the trophy. He {{was inducted into the}} Sport Australia Hall of Fame in that year.|$|E
25|$|Hannibal and his Carthaginians had outgeneraled, outmaneuvered, outfought and obliterated three {{successive}} Roman armies {{since their}} arrival in Italy in 218 BC. The fear of defeat {{had caused the}} current Roman dictator to avoid fighting a pitched battle, {{and when he had}} managed to get the Carthaginians trapped at Ager Falernus, Hannibal had again made fools of the Romans and burst out with his army. All the while the Carthaginians had pillaged Italian property at will, despoiling the Romans while fattening their own pockets. Against this backdrop, the news of Minucius outmaneuvering Hannibal in this skirmish, and the retreat of the Carthaginian army was hailed in Rome as a great “victory”. This provided the political opponents of Fabius, embittered with his strategy, to spring a surprise on the dictator. The Roman army commanded by Fabius had apparently done little except follow Hannibal around <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>him</b> ruin Roman economy, while the same army under a different general had caused Hannibal to retreat. So, the Roman senate sought a way to reward Minucius for his service to the state.|$|E

500|$|Listed at 5ft 10 in (1.78 m) and 160 pounds (73kg), Pierce {{was also}} among the more {{diminutive}} pitchers to enjoy great success, and is likely the smallest pitcher since the 1920s to win 200 games. Sherm Lollar, his catcher for ten years in Chicago, noted that his lack of size didn't diminish his velocity, noting, [...] "He isn't too big, but he has wonderful coordination. And he sure is pretty to watch, the way he pumps and rocks and throws. Sometimes, when I'm not catching a game, I'll just go {{off to one side}} <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>him</b> pitch." [...] And Paul Richards noted, [...] "Pierce is a perfectionist who has achieved maximum potential out of the equipment nature gave him." [...] Pierce's size also belied his durability, as {{he was one of the}} few pitchers under [...] in height to lead the league in complete games since the 1920s, with Ned Garver, Frank Lary, Camilo Pascual and Fernando Valenzuela – all of whom were an inch taller and outweighed Pierce by at least 20 pounds – being the only other pitchers under six feet tall to lead the league more than once since the early 1930s. He remains the last pitcher to lead the AL in complete games three years in a row.|$|E
500|$|During {{the first}} work by Shinichirō Watanabe on Cowboy Bebop, the first image {{that came to}} him was of Spike. Prior to that, Watanabe had the {{character}} of Spike in mind {{for a long time}} beforehand. From that point on, Watanabe [...] "tried to build a story around him, trying to make him cool." [...] Watanabe created Spike as a mirror image of himself: in Watanabe's words, [...] "I don't smoke or drink or fight, but I want to – so Spike does." [...] Spike forms the main focus on the series, with the central theme being his past and its karmic effect on him. Spike was portrayed as a [...] "typical old-style Japanese man", who would simply do what he wanted and expect others to follow his lead <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>him</b> from the sidelines. Spike's artificial eye was included as Watanabe wanted his characters to have flaws. He was originally going to give Spike an eye patch, but the producers vetoed it. In order to portray him as cool, Toshihiro Kawamoto designed Spike to look [...] "uncool": when he stands still, he has a hunched appearance. This meant that when the character was moving vigorously, he came across as [...] "extra cool". Spike's appearance was primarily based on the main protagonist of Tantei Monogatari, portrayed by famous Japanese actor Yusaku Matsuda. Although Yamadera was a fan of Matsuda's, he avoided imitating his distinctive manner of speaking, noting that it [...] "wouldn't have sounded right" [...] for Spike. Spike's Swordfish II spaceship was created by mecha designer Kimitoshi Yamane. Yamane liked the English biplane torpedo-bomber Fairey Swordfish, which led him to name the Swordfish II after the bomber. The conclusion of Spike's story and his final battle with Vicious were planned by Watanabe well in advance, with each episode featuring them meant to shadow their final confrontation. Some of the staff were unhappy about this approach as a continuation of the series would be difficult. While he considered altering the ending, he eventually settled with his original idea.|$|E
2500|$|On 3 December 2010, it was {{confirmed}} Harrison would continue {{his career as}} a professional boxer despite the calls for him to retire. Former British and Commonwealth champion Dereck Chisora was critical of the decision, stating, [...] "He's going to box on, but who's going to buy the tickets to go <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>him?</b> Even if he gives them to you for free {{are you going to go}} and watch?... Good luck to Audley anyway." ...|$|E

2500|$|I watch none. He [...] {{sits and}} listens and I read books, because I know {{perfectly}} well that, don't take offense, that 90 percent of what I hear on television is supposition, when we're talking about the news. And he's not, not as understanding of my pettiness about that. But why should we hear about body bags and deaths, and how many, what day it's gonna happen, and how many this or that or what do you suppose? Or, I mean, it's not relevant. So, why should I waste my beautiful mind on something like that, <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>him</b> suffer.|$|E
2500|$|Boros {{spent the}} full 1961 {{season with the}} Detroit Tigers, {{including}} 115 games as the team's starting third baseman. As the season got underway, Boros was touted as a [...] "can't miss" [...] star. Joe Falls, who was later inducted into the writers' wing of the Baseball Hall of Fame, wrote:"'Steve Boros can't miss. He's got all the tools. Great hands, great speed, great desire – <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>him</b> swing that bat. He's got everything.' It may be so, too. For this young man up from Denver ... is the most celebrated rookie to move up to the Detroit Tigers since Frank Bolling in 1954." ...|$|E
2500|$|Scates {{was highly}} {{competitive}} {{both as a}} player and a coach, and he designed his practices to underscore competition and intensity. Practices moved at a high pace, with high repetitions and little time between drills. [...] "I ran shorter drills and quicker, and I didn’t stop the drills to explain things very much. I just tried to coach and keep things going at the same time." [...] John Wooden was a major influence on Scates and eventually a lifelong friend. [...] "I used to sit up there <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>him</b> when we weren’t practicing. I learned a lot from that. I liked how he changed drills very quickly. He didn’t have any down time. And then I read a book he wrote in 1965 called 'Practical Modern Basketball.'" ...|$|E

60|$|And then {{he turned}} to go. She meant to stand there <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>him</b> cross the tangled lawn, and the little bridge, and to see him lose himself amidst the great shadows of the park.|$|E
60|$|He was so attractive, and so repulsive at one. The sardonic suggestivity that flickered {{over his}} face and looked from his narrowed eyes, {{made her want to}} hide, to hide herself away from him <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>him</b> from somewhere unseen.|$|E

60|$|But Baker {{proposed}} to conduct this business in person. It is {{ten times more}} pleasant to administer a series of shocks to a friend than to sit by <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>him</b> administering them to himself. He retained The Sportsman, {{and began to read}} out the team.|$|E
60|$|In {{order that}} we too may see that more comfortably, you and I, reader, will again go under water <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>him.</b> We will also listen to him, for Rooney has a {{convenient}} habit {{of talking to}} himself, and neither water nor helmet can prevent us from overhearing.|$|E
