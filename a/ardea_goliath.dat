5|$|The {{wide variety}} of birds in Basse Casamance was noted by early explorers. While Basse Casamance National Park and Kalissaye Avifaunal Reserve have not been open for years due to the Casamance Conflict, Carabane {{has been found to}} be very conducive to ornithological observation. A study in 1998 {{discovered}} the following species on the island: African darter (Anhinga rufa), Goliath heron (<b>Ardea</b> <b>goliath),</b> palm-nut vulture (Gypohierax angolensis), black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa), whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus), Eurasian curlew (Numenius arquata), Caspian tern (Sterna caspia), blue-spotted wood-dove (Turtur afer), red-eyed dove (Streptopelia semitorquata), white-rumped swift (Apus caffer), woodland kingfisher (Halcyon senegalensis), grey-backed camaroptera (Camaroptera brachyura), red-bellied paradise-flycatcher (Terpsiphone rufiventer), pied crow (Corvus albus), black-rumped waxbill (Estrilda troglodytres) and yellow-fronted canary (Serinus mozambicus).|$|E
50|$|The Goliath heron (<b>Ardea</b> <b>goliath),</b> {{also known}} as the giant heron, is a very large wading bird of the heron family, Ardeidae. It is found in sub-Saharan Africa, with smaller numbers in Southwest and South Asia.|$|E
50|$|The {{only known}} endemic bird species is the black-tailed cisticola (Cisticola melanura) {{although}} there is a fairly rich selection of bird life. Following rains the following {{can be found in the}} wetlands: greater swamp-warbler (Acrocephalus rufescens), African yellow warbler (Iduna natalensis), chirping cisticola (Cisticola pipiens), Bocage's weaver (Ploceus temporalis), saddle-billed stork (Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis), marabou stork (Leptoptilos crumeniferus), Goliath heron (<b>Ardea</b> <b>goliath),</b> and wattled crane (Bugeranus carunculatus).|$|E
50|$|More than 500 {{species of}} birds live in the Gambia. The Bijilo Forest Park and the Abuko are {{important}} bird habitats. Faunal species seen here are the pelicans, spoonbills, yellow-billed stork (Mycteria ibis), Goliath heron (<b>Ardea</b> <b>goliath),</b> blue-cheeked bee-eater (Merops persicus), mouse-brown sunbird (Anthreptes gabonicus), African fish eagle (Hieraaetus spilogaster) (in the river valleys). Wetland bird species are Dendrocygna viduata, sacred ibis (Threskiornis aethiopicus), palm-nut vulture (Gypohierax angolensis), crakes, greater painted snipe (Rostratula benghalensis) and African jacana (Actophilornis africanus).|$|E
50|$|The {{order of}} Ciconiiformes is {{represented}} by birds like western reef heron (Egretta gularis), little egret (Egretta garzetta), woolly-necked stork (Ciconia episcopus), hammerkop (Scopus umbretta), squacco heron (Ardeola ralloides), little bittern (Ixobrychus minutus), Goliath heron (<b>Ardea</b> <b>goliath),</b> great egret (Egretta alba, marabou (Leptoptilos crumeniferus), night heron (Nycticorax nycticorax), grey heron (Ardea cinerea), cattle egret (Bubulcus ibis) and the sacred ibis (Threskiornis aethiopicus). With their long legs, this division of birds searches the river banks for food.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{the largest}} North American heron and, among all extant herons, it is surpassed only by the goliath heron (<b>Ardea</b> <b>goliath)</b> and the white-bellied heron (Ardea insignis). It has head-to-tail length of 91 - 137 cm, a {{wingspan}} of 167 - 201 cm, a height of 115 - 138 cm, and a weight of 1.82 - 3.6 kg. In British Columbia, adult males averaged 2.48 kg and adult females 2.11 kg. In Nova Scotia and New England, adult herons of both sexes averaged 2.23 kg, while in Oregon, both sexes averaged 2.09 kg Thus, great blue herons are roughly twice as heavy as great egrets (Ardea alba), although only slightly taller than them, but they can weigh about {{half as much as}} a large goliath heron.|$|E
50|$|The {{purple heron}} usually breeds in colonies but {{sometimes}} the nests are solitary. It sometimes associates with other species such as the goliath heron (<b>Ardea</b> <b>goliath)</b> or grey heron at multi-species nesting colonies. The site chosen is generally in reed beds, canebrakes or low bushes close to large lakes or other extensive wetlands. It builds a bulky nest of dead reeds, sticks or whatever is available, carelessly pulling the material together. The eggs are bluish-green, averaging 56 by 45 mm. The clutch is usually four or five eggs, with occasionally seven or eight eggs being laid, though these large clutches may have resulted from two females laying in the same nest. The eggs are laid at intervals of three days, and incubation may begin with the first egg, or start when the clutch is complete. Both parents share the incubation, which lasts between 24 and 28 days, and {{the care of the}} young. When an adult brings food, its beak is dragged down by the chicks and it regurgitates food from the crop onto the nest, or the young may take food directly from the beak. The young fledge at about six weeks and become independent at two months. They then disperse widely.|$|E
50|$|Wading birds, even {{large and}} {{relatively}} slow-moving types {{such as the}} goliath heron (<b>Ardea</b> <b>goliath),</b> tend to be highly cautious about avoiding deep water in crocodile occupied wetlands whereas cormorants and waterfowl forage over deeper water and are easier for crocodiles to ambush, with Egyptian geese (Alopochen aegyptiaca) and spur-winged geese (Plectropterus gambensis) recorded as being taken largely while flightless due to molting their flight feathers. On the contrary, there are several records of them capturing wading birds. Guggisberg (1972) saw multiple cases of predation on marabou storks (Leptoptilos crumenifer) and around Lake Turkana several may frequent heronries to pick off fledglings. In one case, a crocodile was filmed capturing a striated heron (Butorides striata) in mid-flight. Osprey (Pandion haliaetus) {{are known to be}} grabbed while they dive for fish as are possibly African fish eagles (Haliaeetus vocifer) while crowned eagles (Stephanoaetus coronatus) have reportedly been ambushed on land at carrion. Crocodiles are occasionally successful in grabbing passerines such as weaver birds, including the abundant red-billed quelea (Quelea quelea), and swallows, having been observed to breach the water and {{in a matter of seconds}} sweep off a branch full of birds with remarkable success. Larger land birds, such as bustards, guineafowl, ground hornbills (Bucorvus sp.) and ostriches (Struthio camelus), may be taken when they come to water to drink but like most birds are seldom harassed and a minor part of the diet.|$|E
5000|$|The {{shoebill}} {{is noted}} for its slow movements and tendency to remain still for long periods, resulting in repeated descriptions of the species as [...] "statue-like". They are quite sensitive to human disturbance and may abandon their nests if flushed by humans. However, while foraging, if dense vegetation stands between it and humans, this wader can be fairly tame. The shoebill is attracted to poorly oxygenated waters where fish frequently surface to breathe. Exceptionally for a bird this large, the shoebill often stands and perches on floating vegetation, making them appear somewhat like a giant jacana, although the similarly-sized and occasionally sympatric Goliath heron (<b>Ardea</b> <b>goliath)</b> is also known to stand on aquatic vegetation. Shoebills typically feed in muddy waters and, being solitary birds, forage at a minimum distance of 20 m from one another even where relatively densely populated. This species stalks its prey patiently, in a slow and lurking fashion. While hunting, the shoebill strides very slowly and is frequently motionless. Unlike some other large waders, this species hunts entirely using vision and is not known to engage in tactile hunting. When prey is spotted, it launches a quick, violent strike. However, {{depending on the size}} of the prey, handling time after the strike can exceed 10 minutes. Around 60% of strikes are successful in yielding prey. Frequently water and vegetation is snatched up during the strike and is spilled out from the edges of the mandibles. The activity of hippopotamus may inadvertently benefit the shoebill, as the hippos occasionally force fish to the surface of the water while they are submerged.|$|E
