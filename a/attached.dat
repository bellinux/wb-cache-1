5|$|The Kaivalya Upanishad manuscripts vary, {{depending}} on which Veda it is <b>attached</b> to. The one <b>attached</b> to Krishna Yajurveda has 26 verses, while the edition <b>attached</b> to the Atharvaveda has 24 verses with an epilogue. Both convey the same message, but the former is structured as a single chapter, and the latter into two chapters (19 verses in first, 5 verses in second). The text is structured as verses, set to a poetic Vedic meter (exactly same number of syllables per verse of the song).|$|E
5|$|The {{policy was}} revised, with Negro {{soldiers}} serving in provisional platoons. In the 12th Army Group these were <b>attached</b> to regiments, {{while in the}} 6th Army Group the platoons were grouped into whole companies <b>attached</b> to the division. The former arrangement were generally better rated by the units they were <b>attached</b> to, because the Negro platoons had no company-level unit training.|$|E

50|$|Gating {{was then}} changed to include only {{depth of the}} die <b>attach</b> {{material}} that <b>attaches</b> the silicon die to the die paddle. The die, the die paddle, and other features {{above and below the}} die <b>attach</b> depth are ignored. In the resulting acoustic image, shown above slightly magnified, the red areas are voids (defects) in the die <b>attach</b> material.|$|R
5|$|There are six stamens in one to {{two rows}} (whorls), with the {{filaments}} separate from the corona, <b>attached</b> at the throat or base of the tube (epipetalous), often of two separate lengths, straight or declinate-ascending (curving downwards, then upwards). The anthers are basifixed (<b>attached</b> at their base).|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} {{commonly}} used configurations of manifold. The oldest type is a tube with a connector on each end which is <b>attached</b> to the cylinder valve outlet, {{and an outlet}} connection in the middle, to which the regulator is <b>attached.</b> A variation on this pattern includes a reserve valve at the outlet connector. The cylinders are isolated from the manifold when closed, and the manifold can be <b>attached</b> or disconnected while the cylinders are pressurised.|$|E
5|$|A {{combination}} of 14 longitudinal stringers and four main longerons <b>attached</b> to the frames helped form a light but rigid structure to which sheets of alclad stressed skinning were <b>attached.</b> The fuselage plating was 24, 20 and 18 gauge {{in order of}} thickness towards the tail, while the fin structure was completed using short longerons from frames 20 to 23, before being covered in 22 gauge plating.|$|E

Tunnel Mounts <b>attach</b> to the raised floor area (drive shaft tunnel) between the driver and passenger. Passenger Side Mounts <b>attach</b> to floor {{on the passenger side}} of the vehicle. Console mounting brackets <b>attach</b> to an existing vehicle center console. Trunk Mounts provide mounting options for use inside car trunks.|$|R
5|$|A {{downline}} {{used for}} open ocean diving {{is much the}} same as a shotline, but does not reach {{all the way to the}} bottom. An open-ocean downline is weighted at the bottom, and <b>attached</b> to a substantial float at the surface, which may be tethered to the boat. It may be marked at intervals by knots or loops, and may be <b>attached</b> to decompression trapeze system. In some cases a sea anchor may be used to limit wind drift, particularly if <b>attached</b> to a boat with significant windage.|$|E
5|$|A release {{mechanism}} was provided on the gas-bag, such that, in an emergency, a {{pull on the}} <b>attached</b> rope would release hydrogen from the gas-bag. This rope was <b>attached</b> to ballast, {{so that it would}} also be activated automatically {{in the case of a}} catastrophic loss of ballast. Failure to attach this rope was to play a pivotal role in the loss of the Patrie.|$|E

For example, <b>attaching</b> two Energy Runes will give the monster a 15% health bonus, while <b>attaching</b> four Violent Runes gives the monster a 22% chance to attack again after its turn.|$|R

They prevent proteins and microorganisms from <b>attaching,</b> which prevents large organisms such as barnacles from <b>attaching.</b> Larger organisms require a biofilm to <b>attach,</b> which {{is composed of}} proteins, polysaccharides, and microorganisms.|$|R
40|$|NASA {{analyzes}} electrical, electronic, and electromechanical (EEE) parts used {{in space}} vehicles to understand failure modes of these components. The diode is an EEE part critical to NASA missions that can fail due to excessive voiding in the die <b>attach.</b> Metallography, one established method {{for studying the}} die <b>attach,</b> is a time-intensive, destructive, and equivocal process whereby mechanical grinding of the diodes is performed to reveal voiding in the die <b>attach.</b> Problems such as die <b>attach</b> pull-out tend to complicate results {{and can lead to}} erroneous conclusions. The objective {{of this study is to}} determine if three-dimensional computed tomography (3 DCT), a nondestructive technique, is a viable alternative to metallography for detecting die <b>attach</b> voiding. The die <b>attach</b> voiding in two- dimensional planes created from 3 DCT scans was compared to several physical cross sections of the same diode to determine if the 3 DCT scan accurately recreates die <b>attach</b> volumetric variabilit...|$|R

5|$|Even {{though the}} brigade was an Imperial Service unit, the cavalry regiments and brigade {{headquarters}} included <b>attached</b> British Indian Army Special Service Officers (SSO), {{but only as}} advisors. In 1914, the three cavalry regiments had two SSOs <b>attached,</b> and Colonel J. Desaraj Urs Commander-in-Chief of the Mysore State Forces accompanied the Mysore Lancers as an observer. The Jodhpur Lancers joined the brigade with seven SSOs <b>attached.</b> Throughout the war the establishment of British officers assigned to the cavalry regiments was gradually increased; in February 1915 there were four in each regiment, in 1917 another two were assigned and in mid-1918 {{a full complement of}} twelve British officers in each of the regiments was reached.|$|E
