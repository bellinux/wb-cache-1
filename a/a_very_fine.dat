5|$|Phidias, who {{had been}} in charge of all {{building}} projects, was first accused of embezzling gold meant for the statue of Athena and then of impiety, because, when he wrought the battle of the Amazons on the shield of Athena, he carved out a figure that suggested himself as a bald old man, and also inserted <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>fine</b> likeness of Pericles fighting with an Amazon.|$|E
5|$|Sebaceous glands {{are part}} of the body's {{integumentary}} system and serve to protect the body against germs. Sebaceous glands secrete acids that form the acid mantle. This is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>fine,</b> slightly acidic film {{on the surface of the}} skin that acts as a barrier to bacteria, viruses, and other potential contaminants that might penetrate the skin. The pH of the skin is between 4.5 and 6.2, and this acidity helps to neutralise the primarily alkaline nature of contaminants.|$|E

5|$|Difficulties {{with the}} {{diffusers}} and pumps paled into insignificance besides {{those with the}} porous barrier. In order to work, the gaseous diffusion process required a barrier with microscopic holes, but not subject to plugging. It had to be extremely porous, but strong enough to handle the high pressures. And, like everything else, it had to resist corrosion from uranium hexafluoride. The latter criterion suggested a nickel barrier. Foster C. Nix at the Bell Telephone Laboratories experimented with nickel powder, while Edward O. Norris at the C. O. Jelliff Manufacturing Corporation and Edward Adler at the City College of New York worked on a design with electroplated metallic nickel. Norris was an English interior decorator, who had developed <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>fine</b> metal mesh for use with a spray gun. Their design appeared too brittle and fragile for the proposed use, particularly on the higher stages of enrichment, but there was hope {{that this could be}} overcome.|$|E
5|$|No one {{familiar}} {{with the history of}} this country can deny that congressional committees are useful. It is necessary to investigate before legislating, but the line between investigating and persecuting is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>fine</b> one, and the junior Senator from Wisconsin has stepped over it repeatedly. His primary achievement has been in confusing the public mind, as between the internal and the external threats of Communism. We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law. We will not walk in fear, one of another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason, if we dig deep in our history and our doctrine, and remember that we are not descended from fearful men—not from men who feared to write, to speak, to associate and to defend causes that were, for the moment, unpopular.|$|E
5|$|This {{beautiful}} species, {{which is}} sufficiently characterised to {{distinguish it from}} every other individual of the class, is copiously produced in Dutch Guiana, about 300 paces from the sea, and nearly {{as far from the}} left bank of the river of Surinam. It was communicated to me by the elder Vaillant, who discovered it in 1755 on some raised ground which was never overflowed by the highest tides, and is formed of <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>fine</b> white sand, covered with a thin stratum of earth. The prodigious quantity of individuals of this species which grow at the same time, the very different periods of their expansion, the brilliancy and the varied shades of their colours, present a prospect truly picturesque. The fungus was later placed in a new genus, Dictyophora, in 1809 by Nicaise Auguste Desvaux; it was then known for many years as Dictyophora indusiata. Christian Gottfried Daniel Nees von Esenbeck placed the species in Hymenophallus in 1817, as H.indusiatus. Both genera were eventually returned to synonyms of Phallus and the species is now known again by its original name.|$|E

5000|$|Despite his {{nationalism}} Thomas {{could be}} hard on his fellow countrymen. Often his works read {{as more of a}} criticism of Welshness than a celebration. He himself said there is a [...] "lack of love for human beings" [...] in his poetry. Other critics have not been so harsh. Al Alvarez said: [...] "He was wonderful, very pure, very bitter but the bitterness was beautifully and very sparely rendered. He was completely authoritative, <b>a</b> <b>very,</b> <b>very</b> <b>fine</b> poet, completely off on his own, out of the loop but a real individual. It's not about being a major or minor poet. It's about getting a work absolutely right by your own standards and he did that wonderfully well." ...|$|R

When {{she returned}} to England a few months later, her physicians diagnosed her with breast cancer. She received months of chemotherapy and radiation treatment, and the cancer was in remission. In 1995, in apparent good health, Springfield set about promoting the album, which was released that year. By mid-1996, the cancer had returned, {{and in spite of}} vigorous treatments, she died in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire on 2 March 1999.|$|E
25|$|In those {{windows that}} are set with figurative rondels, the style within them is often Classical (see below) but {{sometimes}} Medievalising and sometimes seeks {{to reproduce the}} original style so accurately that to they casual eye they have the appearance of ancient windows.

There is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>fine</b> Jesse Tree (the Ancestors of Christ) window of this nature at the eastern end. Two panels of the original have since been returned.|$|E

Some fuels, in particular certain types of biomasses, can form slag that is corrosive for ceramic inner walls that serve to protect the gasifier outer wall. However some entrained flow type of gasifiers do not possess a ceramic inner wall but have an inner water or steam cooled wall covered with partially solidified slag. These types of gasifiers do not suffer from corrosive slags.|$|E
