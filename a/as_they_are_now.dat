25|$|One of the {{fundamental}} puzzles that Russell hopes to resolve with the theory of descriptions {{is the problem of}} non-referring expressions or, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> called, negative existentials. He finally explains how his theory resolves this problem after invoking a distinction between what he calls primary and secondary occurrences of denoting phrases.|$|E
25|$|The Mangyans, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> anthropologically known, do {{not have}} a warrior society. They are a peaceful, shy but {{friendly}} people. They are rarely known to be hostile, and have had no significant record of violent conflict with other people in the entire history of the province. They grow root crops in forest clearings (slash and burn farms), and hunt wild animals in the forest for their meat needs.|$|E

50|$|It {{was looking}} {{too late for}} Liverpool to {{challenge}} for a league title win and a unique domestic treble, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>now</b> 15 points behind leaders Blackburn (though they did have two games in hnd) and occupying fourth place.|$|R
50|$|This {{would be}} the Young Guns final Queensland Cup Match <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>now</b> officially out of the Cup {{due to the fact}} <b>they</b> had <b>been</b> merged/replaced with/by Northern Pride, based in Cairns and owned by the Cairns Taipans Australian NBL Team.|$|R
25|$|Ubiquitous <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> at shrines, Komainu {{have been}} used {{outdoors}} only since the 14th century. In Asia, the lion was popularly believed to {{have the power to}} repel evil, and for this reason it was habitually used to guard gates and doors. In Japan, too it ended up being installed at the entrance of shrines and temples next to the lion-dog. As a protection against exposure to Japan's rainy weather, the komainu started being carved in stone.|$|E
25|$|The {{release of}} video-capable iPods {{also saw the}} store launch in Australia with music videos and short films by Pixar. iTunes Gift Cards (<b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> known) are now also {{available}} in many more stores such as JB Hi-Fi, David Jones, and the Woolworths chain of stores. Access was inadvertently given to some people in New Zealand, too. Failed negotiations with the Sony BMG label meant that none of that label's artists were {{available at the time}} of launch; they were later added on January 17, 2006.|$|E
25|$|The 20th century saw {{by far the}} {{greatest}} extent of tunnelling when the Rock {{was turned into a}} huge underground fortress capable of accommodating 16,000 men along with all the supplies, ammunition and equipment needed to withstand a prolonged siege. The tunnelling finally ceased in 1968 when the British Army's last specialist tunnelling unit was disbanded. Since then, the tunnels have progressively been turned over to the civilian Government of Gibraltar, although a number are still owned by the Ministry of Defence and some have been sealed off entirely <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> too dangerous to enter.|$|E
50|$|Back in the league, Liverpool had {{returned}} to their winning ways {{and back to the}} top of the First Division table by the end of November, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>now</b> five points ahead of their nearest rivals Arsenal and had a game in hand.|$|R

"I knew," [...] said Mary, {{drawing her}} breath more freely, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>now</b> {{out of reach}} of the musketry--"I knew my squire's truth, promptitude, and sagacity.--I must have him my dear friends--with my no less true knights, Douglas and Seyton--but where, then, is Douglas?" ...|$|R
5000|$|At {{the end of}} 1907, a {{new version}} of the Key Plate design {{included}} the inscription [...] "POSTAGE & REVENUE", <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>now</b> allowed for use as revenue stamps. In 1908 a 1/4d stamp appeared, with a design consisting of the denomination in an oval frame.|$|R
25|$|Hard (also {{known as}} hardsubs or open {{subtitle}}s). The subtitle text is irreversibly merged in original video frames, and so no special equipment or software {{is required for}} playback. Hence, complex transition effects and animation can be implemented, such as karaoke song lyrics using various colors, fonts, sizes, animation (like a bouncing ball) etc. to follow the lyrics. However, these subtitles cannot be turned off unless the original video is {{also included in the}} distribution <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> part of the original frame, and thus it is impossible to have several variants of subtitling, such as in multiple languages.|$|E
25|$|Later, {{the disciples}} of Cyril and Methodius were {{expelled}} from Great Moravia by King Svätopluk I, who re-orientated the Empire to Western Christianity. Nevertheless, the expulsion {{had a significant}} impact on countries where the disciples settled and from there continued their evangelizing missions - especially Southeastern Europe and later Eastern Europe. Arriving in the First Bulgarian Empire, the disciples continued the Cyrilo-Methodian mission and the Glagolitic script was substituted by Cyrillic which used some of its letters. The Cyrillic script and translations of the liturgy were disseminated to other Slavic countries, particularly in the Balkans and Kievan Rus', charting a new path in these Slavic nations' cultural development and establishing the Cyrillic alphabets <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> known in Bulgaria, Belarus, Macedonia, Mongolia, Montenegro, Russia, Serbia, and Ukraine.|$|E
25|$|In {{head-to-head}} terms, Leinster dominate Irish provincial rivals Ulster with a 27–7 win-loss record. Similarly Leinster enjoy a 22–7 win:loss ratio against western province Connacht. Leinster hold only {{a narrow}} head-to-head lead against arch-rivals Munster {{in one of}} the most intense derbies in world rugby, where they possess a 20–15 advantage. Munster are the closest Pro12 team to having a positive record against Leinster - all of the league's other sides have substantial losing records against Leinster. The Welsh side Celtic Warriors existed in the league for its first couple of seasons and have a positive record against Leinster of two wins and zero defeats, but the sides only ever played a couple of matches head-to-head before Celtic Warriors and a number of other Welsh clubs went out of business or merged. This was also at a time when Leinster were nowhere near as strong <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Southern Cherokees, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>now</b> known, {{held their}} own {{convention}} on December 31, 1866. They voted {{to send their}} own delegation to Washington.

25|$|The first Huguenots {{to leave}} France sought freedom from {{persecution}} in Switzerland and the Netherlands. A group of Huguenots {{was part of}} the French colonisers who arrived in Brazil in 1555 to found France Antarctique. A couple of ships with around 500 people arrived at the Guanabara Bay, present-day Rio de Janeiro, and settled in a small island. A fort, named Fort Coligny, was built to protect them from attack from the Portuguese troops and Brazilian Native Americans. It was an attempt to establish a French colony in South America. The fort was destroyed in 1560 by the Portuguese, who captured part of the Huguenots. The Portuguese threatened the prisoners with death if they did not convert to Catholicism. The Huguenots of Guanabara, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> known, produced a declaration of faith to express their beliefs to the Portuguese. This was their death sentence. This document, the Guanabara Confession of Faith, became the first Protestant confession of faith in the whole of the Americas.|$|E
25|$|After {{the split}} with the Western World and {{synthesis}} with Nestorianism, the Church of the East expanded rapidly due to missionary works during the Medieval period. During {{the period between}} 500–1400 the geographical horizons of the Church of the East extended well beyond its heartland in present-day northern Iraq, north eastern Syria and south eastern Turkey. Communities sprang up throughout Central Asia, and missionaries from Assyria and Mesopotamia took the Christian faith as far as China, with a primary indicator of their missionary work being the Nestorian Stele, a Christian tablet written in Chinese script found in China dating to 781 AD. Their most important conversion, however, was of the Saint Thomas Christians of the Malabar Coast in India, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> {{the largest group of}} non ethnically Assyrian Christians on earth, with around 10 million followers when all denominations are added together and their own diaspora is included. The St Thomas Christians were believed by tradition to have been converted by St Thomas, and were in communion with the Church of the East {{until the end of the}} medieval period.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, {{many new}} {{universities}} were opened in Britain, while car ownership was relatively low, especially among young people. Furthermore, internal flights {{were not as}} cheap or prevalent <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now.</b> Most students either hitched or took a long distance coach. The National Union of Students had a very large travel company at the time with charter flights all over the world. They wanted to expand their operations domestically and so went to various regional sales managers of British Railways to develop special fares for holders of NUS cards. These were usually an allocated number of seats on specified weekend trains but they were very successful and Paul Connellan, who was the Travel Company General Manager, went to the British Railways Board with a proposal to allow a general discount based on the NUS card. The railways management, led by Alan Chamberlain, were reluctant to offer a discount based just on such cards particularly as some colleges and universities were not members of the NUS. A compromise was agreed where a special card would be sold but only through student travel offices.|$|E
6000|$|After {{that they}} whispered so low (which <b>they</b> could do <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>now</b> much nearer each other) that I could catch only one remark.

60|$|Here {{the natives}} were {{assembled}} in great force and, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>now</b> {{out of sight}} of those on board ship, the guns could no longer render assistance to the little party.

25|$|By late May, {{following}} {{the evacuation of}} British forces from Dunkirk, France, in Operation Dynamo, the Royal Navy was in immediate need of ships, especially <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>now</b> fighting the Battle of the Atlantic in which German U-boats threatened Britain's supplies of food and other resources essential to the war effort.|$|R
25|$|As {{can be seen}} in {{the graph}} to the right, the {{retailer}} has seen rapid growth since the end of 2008, doubling the number of their stores from 61 in November 2008 to 123 in December 2009. Company owner Lalani said that finding sites was getting easier because of the new empty rate tax on commercial property. Whereas, previously, landlords would decline to have a discount shop filling their empty stores, they are now less reluctant to fill them with discount stores, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> being charged for stores which lie empty. Stuart Donnelly, head of property at 99p Stores, notes that landlords are now being much more proactive, inviting potential retailers to come and have a look at their locations with the hope of them taking up a lease, as the property market has been badly affected by the recession, allowing the company to drive competitive deals to further expand their portfolio of stores with less expenditure, something that wouldn't have been possible just a few years ago. Landlords are now regarding 99p Stores as an anchor tenant due to the significant number of customers one of their stores can bring to a location.|$|E
500|$|In May 1636, Cotton was {{appointed}} to a committee to make a draft of laws that agreed with the Word of God and {{would serve as a}} constitution. [...] The resulting legal code was titled An Abstract of the laws of New England <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> established. [...] This was only modestly used in Massachusetts, but the code became the basis for John Davenport's legal system in the New Haven Colony and also provided a model for the new settlement at Southampton, Long Island.|$|E
500|$|Walt Whitman {{has been}} claimed as America's first [...] "poet of democracy", a title meant to reflect {{his ability to}} write in a {{singularly}} American character. A British friend of Walt Whitman, Mary Smith Whitall Costelloe, wrote: [...] "You cannot really understand America without Walt Whitman, without Leaves of Grass... He has expressed that civilization, 'up to date,' as he would say, and no student of the philosophy of history can do without him." [...] Modernist poet Ezra Pound called Whitman [...] "America's poet... He is America." [...] Andrew Carnegie called him [...] "the great poet of America so far". Whitman considered himself a messiah-like figure in poetry. Others agreed: one of his admirers, William Sloane Kennedy, speculated that [...] "people will be celebrating the birth of Walt Whitman <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> the birth of Christ".|$|E
50|$|Even {{during their}} novitiate Father Francis and Father Bonaventure (<b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>now</b> known) {{had to make}} a begging trip to Canada, so great was the burden of debt on the new foundation. Their trip was successful, and the debts <b>were</b> paid. <b>They</b> made their first {{profession}} of vows on February 16, 1859.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, that's so," [...] Lemuel admitted. He {{remained}} silent, with a vague wonder flitting {{through his}} mind whether Mr. Sewell could make anything better of the case, and then settled back to his thoughts of Statira, pierced and confused <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>now</b> with his pain from that trouble with Miss Vane.|$|R
50|$|Flights {{began in}} 1992, when Adria Airways re-established its {{activities}} on a truncated market. The majority of charter destinations from Western Europe to the Adriatic coast had become inaccessible <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>now</b> {{situated on the}} territory of other countries. The fleet was too big, so many aircraft were leased out across the globe.|$|R
500|$|In 1948, {{the ninth}} CGPM {{approved}} the first formal recommendation for {{the writing of}} symbols in the metric system when {{the basis of the}} rules <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> known was laid down. These rules were subsequently extended by International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and now cover unit symbols and names, prefix symbols and names, how quantity symbols should be written and used and how the values of quantities should be expressed. Both ISO and the IEC have published rules for the presentation of SI units that are generally compatible with those published in the SI Brochure. [...] ISO and IEC {{were in the process of}} merging their standards for quantities and units into a single set of compatible documents identified as the ISO/IEC 80000 Standard. The rules covering printing of quantities and units are part of ISO 80000-1:2009.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the flags, Wrigley authorized Bill Veeck, {{the leader of the}} bleacher reconstruction project, to add colored lights on the crossbar of the masthead so that the Chicago 'L' passengers would {{be able to see the}} outcome of Cubs home games after sunset. In his autobiography, Veeck remembered the colors as green for a win and red for a loss. Hartell's book acknowledges Veeck's comments, but reports that contemporary newspapers stated that the colors of the lights were blue and white, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now.</b> Eventually the original lights on the masthead were replaced by lights directly on the top of scoreboard, still visible from outside Wrigley field. The lights complement the flags by helping night time passersby learn the result of that day's Cubs game at a glance. The current blue and white Win/Loss lights were added atop the scoreboard in 1978, while the [...] "Wintrust W" [...] light on the left-field video board was implemented in 2015.|$|E
500|$|The {{fossil record}} of the Dermaptera starts in the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic period about [...] in England and Australia, and {{comprises}} about 70 specimens in the extinct suborder Archidermaptera. Some of the traits believed by neontologists to belong to modern earwigs are {{not found in the}} earliest fossils, but adults had five-segmented tarsi (the final segment of the leg), well developed ovipositors, veined tegmina (forewings) and long segmented cerci; in fact the pincers would not have been curled or used <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now.</b> The theorized stem group of the Dermaptera are the Protelytroptera. These insects, which resemble modern Blattodea, or cockroaches owing to shell-like forewings and the large, unequal anal fan, are known from the Permian of North America, Europe and Australia. There are no fossils from the Triassic when the morphological changes from Protelytroptera to Dermaptera took place. The most likely, and most closely resembling, related order of insects is Grylloblattaria, theorized by Giles in 1963. However, other arguments have been made by other authors linking them to Phasmida, Embioptera, Plecoptera, and Dictyoptera.|$|E
50|$|The 41st Primetime Emmy Awards {{were held}} on Sunday, September 17, 1989. The {{ceremony}} was broadcast on Fox from the Pasadena Civic Auditorium in Pasadena, California.

Two networks, Lifetime, and USA, received their first major nominations this year.|$|R
5000|$|The band also {{revisited}} their a capella 1988 album English Rebel Songs 1381-1914 {{and felt}} that <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>now</b> more confident singers, they should re-record it and bring it up to date. And so English Rebel Songs was remade in 2003 with the added track [...] "Coal Not Dole" [...] bringing the record up to 1984.|$|R
25|$|On 30 January 1583 Fenton {{reached the}} bay of São Vicente with Leicester, Edward Bonaventure and Elizabeth, and were in talks with the Portuguese {{residents}} of nearby Santos.
