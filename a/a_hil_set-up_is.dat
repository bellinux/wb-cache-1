In the system, <b>a</b> <b>HIL</b> <b>set-up</b> supported by model-based approaches simulates vehicle network in real-time, and provides all essential signals to the instrument cluster under test. The machine vision system with novel image processing algorithms is designed to perform function tests by detecting gauges, warning lights/tell-tales, patterns and text displays.

40|$|Advanced {{testing methods}} are {{becoming}} more and more prevalent to increase the reliability of wind turbines. In this field, dynamometers that allow for system level tests of full-scale nacelles will play an important role. Operating these test benches in <b>a</b> hardware-in-the-loop (<b>HiL)</b> <b>set-up</b> that emulates realistic drive train modes is challenging because of the relatively low stiffness of the load machinesâ€™ drive trains. This paper proposes a control method for enabling the said operation mode. It is based on the idea that the HiL-controller overrides the present unrealistic dynamics and directly imposes desired realistic dynamics on the test bench. A solution for the control problem is given and applied in a design study with a generic wind turbine and a test bench model obtained from construction data of a real test bench. In the design study, the HiL-controller robustly imposes desired drive train dynamics on the test bench model. Despite measurement noise, unmodelled parametric uncertainty, and unmodelled delays, the first drive train mode is correctly reproduced. This is confirmed by a comparison with simulation results from a full servo-aero-elastic code. Furthermore, an implementation of the test bench model on a programmable logic controller showed the real-time feasibility of the proposed method...|$|R
40|$|Accurate time {{synchronization}} of Phasor Measurement Unit (PMUs) play {{an important}} role in application of synchrophasor technology. Dierent time distribution methods are present which are capable of synchronizing Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) with dierent timing accuracies. Initial part of this report presents information about some of the high-accuracy time distribution methods which were studied and evaluated based on their usability for synchrophasor applications. Later part of the report assesses timing requirements for PMUs by carrying out tests in a controlled experimental environment. In the past, generally PMUs were tested using a stand-alone relay test kit. A major drawback of this type of testing <b>set-up</b> <b>is</b> that it does not tests the PMUs in their practical operational environment which includes an instrumentation channel feeding input signals to the PMU. Overcoming this drawback, a new generic real-time Hardware-in-the-Loop (<b>HIL)</b> test <b>set-up</b> has <b>been</b> used to assess timing requirements of commercial PMUs in the laboratory. The results obtained showcase the eect of instrumentation channel on phase errors and also in determining timing requirements of PMUs. Insightful information showcasing the behaviour of PMU estimates in case of jitters in timing signals has also been presented...|$|R
40|$|<b>A</b> {{hardware-in-the-loop}} (<b>HIL)</b> simulation is <b>a</b> hybrid simulation {{that includes}} a hardware element within a numerical simulation loop. One {{of the goals of}} performing <b>a</b> <b>HIL</b> simulation at the European Proximity Operation Simulator (EPOS) is to simulate on-orbit servicing for verification and validation of the docking phase. The simulator essentially consists of two robots, with very accurate position controllers, holding a docking interface and a probe element, respectively. A key feature of the <b>HIL</b> docking simulator <b>set-up</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> feedback loop that is closed on the real force sensed at the docking interface during the contact with the probe, which is used in order to drive the free-floating bodies numerical simulation. The high stiffness of the robots causes the contact duration to be shorter than the (incompressible) time delay in the robots' dynamics. This leads to inconsistencies in the HIL docking simulation results and to potential instability and damage of the closed-loop system. This work presents a novel mitigation strategy to the given challenge, accompanied with stability analysis and validating experiments. The high-stiffness compliance issue is modified by combining virtual and real compliances in the software and hardware. The method is presented here for six degrees of freedom. Experimental results for the case of a translational motion along a single axis and the six degrees of freedom are presented, too. In addition, analysis is performed in order to characterize the stability region of the HIL docking simulator {{as a function of the}} contact force parameters, the time delay and the simulated satellites' masses. This hybrid contact dynamics model and the accompanying analysis is envisioned to provide a safe and flexible docking simulator tool. This tool shall allow reproduction of the desired impact dynamics for any stiffness and damping characteristics within the stability region...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{interaction}} between pantograph and overhead line (OHL) heavily influences {{the quality of}} the current collection that, on one side assures the correct power transmission from the contact wire to the electrical traction drives of the vehicle, {{and on the other side}} affects the amount of wear of both the contact wire of the OHL and the collector strips of the pantograph. Moreover the dynamics of pantograph-catenary coupled system is a mandatory topic when considering the interoperability issues, among which there is the requirement of the assessment of the quality of interaction between a pantograph running on a catenary belonging to a network different from its original one. Usually a pantograph <b>is</b> optimised and <b>set-up</b> for a given category of OHL, but it is not assured that running under different catenaries allows to obtain the same performances. To this purpose the key option is to perform test runs. Nevertheless an analysis before test trials would be very useful for a first evaluation of a new pantograph-OHL combination, enabling to save time and cost of the experimental runs. A first possibility, nowadays widely used especially in the design stage of new catenaries, is to perform numerical simulations by means of a validated numerical model, e. g. according to EN 50318. As an auxiliary option, a hardware in the loop (<b>HIL)</b> indoor <b>set-up</b> can <b>be</b> used in order to analyse the dynamic behaviour of a real pantograph coupled with a overhead line (OHL), virtually simulated in real time. This work focuses on the analysis of the correspondences between indoor test carried out on a pantograph, and the results that are obtained during test runs on the real line. The laboratory tests are fundamentally of two types: classical sinusoidal tests (step sine or sweep sine) and tests with <b>HIL</b> <b>set-up.</b> The results of both approaches are compared with on track test results considering the influence pantograph mean contact force and contact wire mechanical tension. The potentialities of <b>HIL</b> approach as <b>a</b> useful tool for an effective application of the virtual homologation concept are pointed out...|$|R
40|$|Recently CNH {{developed}} {{a new series of}} wheel excavators equipped with a Electronic Control Unit (ECU) that use a new control software. It was critical to test and validate the design of this new control system before deployment to ensure high customer satisfaction and reducing warranty costs. Test on <b>a</b> Hardware-In-the-Loop (<b>HIL)</b> platform accelerates the verification and validation process. <b>A</b> validated <b>HIL</b> <b>set-up,</b> being <b>a</b> repeatable and reliable test platform with a short turnaround time is ideal for developing standardized processes for ECU testing and calibration. The goal {{of this paper is to}} show the development of the wheel excavator model for HIL application. In particular the model of the hydraulic circuit and the mechanical system of the wheel excavator arm are reported. An analytical model of the hydraulic system includes orifice flow equations, fluid compressibility equations for all the oil volumes, as well as the force balance equations for all the cylinders. In order to describe the motion of the excavator arm both kinematic and dynamic models were developed from the fundamental theory for robotic manipulators [1]. The kinematic model is derived following the Denavit-Hartenberg guidelines while the dynamic model is created by writing Newton- Euler equations for each link of the arm. By combining the equations, a dynamical model in terms of the joint variables is obtained. The mathematical model have many nonlinearities because of nonlinear opening characteristics and dead zone of main control valves, geometrical relationship in the kinematic model, frictions, ecc. These aspects make modeling very complex. The model has been built in a modular approach so that model updates due to a modification of the system configurations could be performed starting from available model, by single component specifications, thereby reducing the total effort for the new models. The model must have same specific property due to the HIL application; the first of all is that the model must run in real time. A second general target is that the developed model easily fit into the available simulation models environment for HIL closed-loop simulation, in particular it must turn employing maximum 15 % of resources at fixed time step 1 ms and with one of the following numerical integrators typologies: ODE 1 to ODE 4.

30|$|Several {{previous}} researchers {{observed the}} set-up within 30 Â days after the pile installation day, and after that, {{the rate of}} change was very slow (e.g., [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]). The <b>set-up</b> value <b>is</b> related to soil characteristics, pile type and the installation technique. Pile set-up occurs in almost all types of soils including organic and inorganic clays, loose to medium dense silts, sandy silts, and fine sands [16, 17]. The set-up in granular soils typically depends on the depth of the ground water table (GWT). Svinkin [18] stated that the rate of <b>set-up</b> <b>is</b> linear with time above GWT, while the set-up with respect to the time is a power function below GWT. The increase in capacity was reported at approximately 100 % over 3 Â months in non-cohesive soils. In clay soils, the <b>set-up</b> <b>is</b> mainly related to reconsolidation of the disturbed soil around the pile, and aging [2]. Alternatively, pile <b>set-up</b> <b>is</b> also dependent on the driven pile types. The <b>set-up</b> <b>was</b> shown to be affected by the composition of piles (i.e., timber, concrete, steel, and composite piles) and the level of soil displacement induced during pile installation process which can be a function of pile size and type (e.g., H-piles, open-ended pipe piles, and closed-end pipe piles).|$|R
