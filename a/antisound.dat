40|$|The term Active Noise Control (ANC) {{describes}} {{the suppression of}} an unwanted sound field by the superposition of an antiphase field. In general, an active control system consists of a sensing mechanism to detect the unwanted noise, a processing element to analyse the sound and produce the antiphase signal and a system of secondary sources to radiate the required <b>antisound.</b> The ideal ANC system would {{have the ability to}} modify its own response to accommodate any changes in the environment in which it is placed. Such as system is known as anadaptive one. This thesis is concerned with assessing the suitability of several different recursive algorithms for adapting digital controllers to control random noise within ventilation ducts. Algorithms for adapting both Finite Impulse Response (FIR) and Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) digital filters are studied. Computer simulations are presented which directly compare the performance of the algorithms when used in system identification and when used to control adaptive systems in ducts. Experiments were made in ducts of varying length and ranging from anechoic to highly reverberant in nature. Conclusions drawn from the simulations indicate some very significant savings in terms of economy of filter length when implementing adaptive systems within the duct. <p...|$|E
40|$|This Chapter {{tries to}} explain that sound depends on colliding matter and can be {{described}} in terms of frequency and amplitude. It explains how <b>antisound</b> can be used to create silence, what echolocation is, and that the human perception of sound is logarithmic. Medical and military applications and home entertainment are discussed as an illustration. Then we turn to music, discuss what music scales and chords are, when music is considered ‘beautiful, ’ and which areas of the brain are involved in perceiving music. MIDI systems and CD-ROMs are discussed for their relation to digitized music. Speech as the ultimate tool of sound communication is discussed for applications ranging from car navigation to lie detection. You will exercise with creating auditory icons and earcons. The second part of this Chapter deals with the concept of touch and how sound fits in to that. You will get introduced to an intelligent touchscreen that changes handwriting into digital text, a mouse that senses more than clicks, haptic devices in virtual reality applications, domotica, and you will exercise with creating hapticons. Sound In the previous Chapters, we have focused on information that travels by light (reading, visuals, and motion). Light can travel through a vacuum, whereas sound cannot. Sound needs matter (gas, liquids, or solids) to be heard. Unlike light, sound depends on particles of matter that bang against each other and thus transmi...|$|E

The desired objective is achieved by active means, i. e., by introducing additional sources of sound called control sources, which generate the appropriate annihilating acoustic signal (<b>antisound).</b> A general solution for the control sources has been obtained previously in both continuous and discrete formulation of the problem. In the current paper, we focus on optimizing the overall absolute acoustic source strength of the control sources. Mathematically, this amounts to the minimization of multivariable complex-valued functions {{in the sense of}} L 1 with conical constraints, which are only “marginally ” convex. The corresponding numerical optimization problem appears very challenging even for the most sophisticated state-of-the-art methodologies, and even when the dimension of the grid is small and the waves are long. Our central result is that the global L 1 -optimal solution can, in fact, be obtained without solving the numerical optimization problem. This solution is given by a special layer of monopole sources on the perimeter of the protected region. We provide a rigorous proof of global L 1 minimality for both continuous and discrete optimization problems in the one-dimensional case. We also provide numerical evidence that corroborates our result in the two-dimensional case, when the protected domain is a cylinder. Even though we cannot fully justify it, we believe that the same result holds in the general case, i. e., for multidimensional settings and domains of arbitrary shape. We formulate this notion as a conjecture {{at the end of the}} paper...|$|E
40|$|Noise {{sources in}} an {{axial flow fan}} {{can be divided into}} {{fluctuating}} axial thrust forces and circumferential drag forces. For the popular design of a seven-blade rotor driven by a motor supported by four struts, drag noise dominates. This study aims to suppress the drag noise globally by active control schemes. Drag noise features a rotating dipole {{and it has to be}} cancelled by a secondary source of the same nature. This is achieved experimentally by a pair of loudspeakers positioned at right angles to each other on the fan rotational plane. An adaptive LMS feedforward scheme is used to produce the control signal for one loudspeaker and the time derivative of this signal is used to drive the other loudspeaker. The <b>antisounds</b> radiated by the two loudspeakers have a fixed phase relation of 90 ° forming a rotating dipole. An open-loop control scheme is also implemented for the purpose of comparison and easier implementation in real-life applications. The results show that the globally integrated sound power is reduced by about 13 dB for both closed-and open-loop schemes. A possible limiting factor for the cancellation performance is found to be the presence of higher order modes of drag noise. © 2006 Acoustical Society of America. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
