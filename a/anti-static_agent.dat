In this paper, {{an attempt was made}} to apply low temperature plasma treatment to improve the anti-static property of polyester fabric. The polyester fabrics were treated under different conditions using low temperature plasma. An Orthogonal Array Testing Strategy was employed to determine the optimum treatment condition. After low temperature plasma treatment, the polyester fabrics were evaluated with different characterisation methods. Under the observation of scanning electron microscope, the surface structure of low temperature plasma-treated polyester fabric was seriously altered. This provided more capacity for polyester to capture moisture and hence increase the dissipation of static charges. The relationship between moisture content and half-life decay time for static charges was studied and the results showed that the increment of moisture content would result in shortening the time for the dissipation of static charges. Moreover, there was a great improvement in the anti-static property of the low temperature plasma-treated polyester fabric after comparing with that of the polyester fabric treated with commercial <b>anti-static</b> finishing <b>agent.</b> Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} the electrostatics of the {{pneumatic}} conveying of granular materials in a non-conducting (PVC) vertical pipe is studied using Electrical Capacitance Tomography (ECT) system. The non-conducting wall in general attains static charges arising from particle-wall collisions {{in the initial}} periods of conveying process and then reaches equilibrium with the surroundings. The polarity of particles and conveying pipe inner wall agrees reasonably well with the contact potential difference measurements. The perturbations in the capacitance signal due to charge accumulation are larger with smaller air superficial velocity. The denser flow regimes give larger wall residual charge. Wall charging process shows similar trend by surface potential and ECT measurements.

40|$|Concerns {{regarding}} {{environmental issues}} such as greenhouse gas emissions and climate change {{have led to a}} shift within the research community and chemical and energy industry sectors for finding sustainable routes for producing fuels and chemicals from renewable resources, thereby minimizing our dependence on petroleum. The C 3 -chemical 3 -hydroxypropionic acid has been identifed as a top candidate for the biobased chemical industry. This platform chemical is a Î²-hydroxy acid containing two functional groups (hydroxyl and carboxyl) enabling its conversion into value-added chemicals such as 1, 3 -propanediol, acrolein, malonic acid, acrylamide and acrylic acid, which can be used in resins, coatings, paints, adhesives, lubricants, and in the textile industry as <b>anti-static</b> <b>agent.</b> Polymerized 3 - HP, poly(3 -hydroxypropionate) (poly(3 -HP)), is a biodegradable and stable polymer which, besides its potential role as a biomaterial, can be degraded to 3 -HP monomer. In recent years, a dramatic increase in the interest for microbial production of 3 -HP and poly(3 -HP) has been observed. Metabolic engineering and recombinant expression of various enzymatic pathways in a number of bacterial strains have been suggested and implemented, with mainly renewable glucose and glycerol as substrates. This thesis presents a novel pathway called the propanediol utilization pathway present in Lactobacillus reuteri that catalyzes dehydration of glycerol to 3 - hydroxypropionaldehyde (3 -HPA) and further to 3 -HP by a series of reactions catalyzed by propionaldehyde dehydrogenase (PduP), phosphotransacylase (PduL) and propionate kinase (PduW). Through structural modeling and kinetic characterization of PduP, its 3 -HPA consuming ability was confirmed and catalytic mechanism proposed. PduP, PduL and PduW-mediated conversion of 3 -HPA to 3 - HP was confirmed through their recombinant expression in Escherichia coli. 3 -HPA produced from glycerol by L. reuteri was used as a substrate for conversion to 3 -HP by the recombinant E. coli. A yield of 1 mol/mol was reached with a titer of 12 mM 3 -HP. Depletion of the cofactor NAD+ required for the catalysis of 3 -HP to 3 -HPCoA, was deemed responsible for the low titer. Regeneration of NAD+, used up in PduP catalyzed reaction, was achieved by recombinant expression of NADH oxidase (Nox) from L. reuteri in E. coli expressing PduP, PduL and PduW. The final 3 -HP titer by this recombinant strain was at least twice that of E. coli carrying solely PduP, PduL and PduW. For the production of poly(3 -HP), PduL and PduW in the recombinant strain were replaced by polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase of Chromobacterium sp. that converts 3 - HP-CoA to poly(3 -HP). A poly(3 -HP) content of up to 40 % (w/w) cell dry weight was reached in an efficient and cheap process requring no additivies or expensive cofactors...|$|E
40|$|This report {{compares the}} effects of {{radiation}} and heating on nylon bagout materials used at the Savannah River Site (SRS) and the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (RFETS). Recently, to simplify the processing of sand, slag, and crucible (SS and C), FB-Line has replaced the low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) bags normally used to package cans of plutonium-bearing material with nylon bags. LDPE and PVC are not soluble in the nitric acid dissolver solution used in F-Canyon, so cans bagged using these materials had to be repackaged before they {{were added to the}} dissolver. Because nylon dissolves in nitric acid, cans bagged in nylon can be charged to the F-Canyon dissolvers without repackaging, thereby reducing handling requirements and personnel exposure. As part of a program to process RFETS SS and C at SRS, RFETS has also begun to use a nylon bagout material. The RFETS bag materials is made from a copolymer of nylon 6 and nylon 6. 9, while the SRS material is made from a nylon 6 monomer. In addition, the SRS nylon has an <b>anti-static</b> <b>agent</b> added. The RFETS nylon is slightly softer than the SRS nylon, but {{does not appear to be}} as resistant to flex cracks initiated by contact with sharp corners of the inner can containing the SS and C. 2 FB-Line Operations has asked for measurement of {{the effects of}} radiation and heating on these materials. Specifically, they have requested a comparison of the material properties of the plastics before and after irradiation, a measurement of the amount of outgassing when the plastics are heated, and a calculation of the amount of radiolytic gas generation. Testing was performed on samples taken from material that is currently used in FB-Line (color coded orange) and at RFETS. The requested tests are the same tests previously performed on the original and replacement nylon and LDPE bag materials. 3, 4, 5. To evaluate the effect of irradiation on material properties, tensile stresses and elongations to break w ere compared for unirradiated and irradiated samples. A standard ASTM method for the measurement of tensile plastic properties 6 was used. Properties were measured both parallel to the direction of machining (MD) and transverse to the direction of machining (TD). Tensile strength measurements showed that the ultimate strengths of the SRS replacement bag material decreased by 22 percent in the MD orientation and 17 percent in the TD orientation after irradiation with 5 x 106 rad, a dose equivalent to about 8 - 9 months exposure in a plutonium can. For the RFETS material, the decreases were 23 percent in the MD orientation and 56 percent in the TD orientation. Although the 5 x 106 dose significantly degraded the properties of both materials, their strengths remained superior to those previously measured for LDPE, 4 even after irradiation. Elongations to break also decreased, especially for the SRS material. The decrease for the SRS material were 86 percent in the MD orientation and 95 percent in the TD orientation. For the RFETS material, elongations to break decreased at least 18 percent in the MD orientation and 29 percent in the TD orientation. When samples of both the SRS and RFETS materials were heated in a sealed container to the maximum expected storage can temperature of about 95 C, they outgassed at pressures ranging from 16 to 22 psig. These pressure increases would not cause a can to fail. Using a representative G value of 1. 6 molecules/ 100 ev, the amount of outgassing due to radiolysis was calculated to be negligible. In conclusion, it may be stated that the results of the strength tests and the outgassing measurements and calculations demonstrate that the SRS and RFETS replacement bag materials are acceptable substitutes for LDPE with respect to mechanical properties...|$|E
40|$|Packaging {{has become}} an {{indispensible}} element in the food manufacturing process, and different types of additives, such as antioxidants, stabilizers, lubricants, <b>anti-static</b> and anti-blocking <b>agents,</b> have also been developed to improve the performance of polymeric packaging materials. Recently the packaging {{has been found to}} represent a source of contamination itself through the migration of substances from the packaging into food. Various analytical methods have been developed to analyze the migrants in the foodstuff. Overall migration corresponds to the total components, identified or not, that migrate from the packaging material. The objective of the present work is the optimization and validation of the methodology to determine the overall migration from plastic materials to foodstuffs aiming the accreditation according ISO/IEC 17025 (1). The chosen method consists in the total immersion of plastic materials intended to come in contact with foodstuffs into aqueous based food simulants. The selection of the simulating conditions was made in agreement with National Legislation and NP EN 1186 (2). The overall migration from plastic samples was determined as the mass of non-volatile residue after evaporation of the food simulant following immersion. The validation of the analytical procedure consisted on the evaluation of the parameters: limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), repeatability (ri) and intermediate precision (Pi). LOD and LOQ were determined through the analyses of a series of blank samples. Repeatability (ri) and Intermediate Precision (Pi) were evaluated using real samples of different kinds of plastic with different levels of overall migration, according ISO 5725 (3). The uncertainty estimation was based on intralaboratory validation data. We concluded the laboratory performance complies with the requirements of EN 1186 (4) and is able to evaluate the requirements laid down in Commission Regulation (EU) No 10 / 2011 (5) ...|$|R
40|$|Master of EngineeringSpray dryers are {{the core}} {{components}} of a milk powder production plant, where the basic configuration usually features co-current flow of milk powder and air. Spray dryers have to be cleaned frequently due to powder deposit build-up on the walls. Powder deposit build-up gives rise to lower product yields and poses a potential fire risk. If the powder deposits are scorched (from being overheated) they will contaminate, and thus compromise, the quality and consumer safety of the final product, if the powder deposits fall in and mix with it. With milk powder production rates of most industrial spray dryers ranging from 4 - 28 tonnes of dry powder an hour, these wall deposition problems are significant. This problem is worth investigating because the outcome of reducing or eliminating wall deposition is that a spray dryer could operate {{for a longer period}} of time without having to be cleaned. Reduction in downtime due to cleaning would give rise to increased production time and possibly a reduction in the cost of manufacturing the product. The spray dryer used in this work was a modified short-form co-current Niro unit, fabricated from stainless steel. The spray dryer had an internal diameter of 0. 80 m, narrowing down to 0. 06 m at the base, and a height of 2 m. A two-fluid nozzle was used to spray the process fluids (water, skim milk and grape skin extract) into the drying chamber. To measure the wall deposition fluxes on the internal walls of the spray dryer, four stainless steel plates (dimensions 110 mm by 120 mm) were inserted in place of the windows that were previously used as sight glasses. A fifth plate (dimensions 110 mm by 120 mm) and a sixth plate (dimensions 110 mm by 110 mm) were also placed on the conical section of the spray dryer at different circumferential locations. Before this work, no quantitative data on the effects of spray dryer operating conditions on the wall deposition fluxes of food material were available. This work investigated the effect on the spray deposition flux of skim milk powder on the walls of the spray dryer of (i) flow patterns in the spray dryer, by changing the degree of swirl imparted to the incoming air by using three swirl vane angles of 0 o, 25 o and 30 o, and (ii) the stickiness of the product, through first changing the temperature of the incoming air by using three inlet air temperatures of 170 oC, 200 oC and 230 oC; and then changing the process fluid flowrate by using three flowrates of 1. 4 kg hr- 1, 1. 6 kg hr- 1 and 1. 8 kg hr- 1. Previous researchers have found that the extent to which water droplets spread out in the drying chamber is affected by the amount of swirl in the inlet air. This is likely to affect wall deposition fluxes because the particles will be closer to the walls if the droplets spread out widely. The results of this work have quantitatively confirmed that the spray deposition flux increases at higher swirl vane angles, where the spray deposition flux increased from 7 g m- 2 hr- 1 (swirl vane angle 0 o) to 12. 9 g m- 2 hr- 1 (swirl vane angle 30 o). When a swirl vane angle of 0 o was used, it was observed that the cross-sectional area of the spray cloud did not change very significantly with time. However, when a swirl vane angle of 25 o was used, the spray cloud was observed to âflutterâ, and when the swirl vane angle was increased to 30 o, the spray cloud was observed to recirculate rapidly back in the direction of the nozzle. Thus, the chance of the particles being thrown further towards the walls of the chamber is likely to increase at higher swirl vane angles. This result suggests that higher wall deposition arises because more swirl is imparted to the air entering the dryer, which in turn affects the stability of the spray cloud and, therefore, the stability of the flow patterns in the spray dryer. The stickiness of the skim milk powder is related to the temperature and moisture content of the particles. In the past, the sticky-point curve has been suggested as a semi-quantitative concept in selecting operating conditions for spray drying food material containing carbohydrates, where it has been implied that there is no significant wall deposition below the sticky-point curve. This work has quantified the spray deposition in spray dryers with respect to the sticky-point curve, where the highest spray deposition flux of skim milk powder on the walls was 16 g m- 2 hr- 1, and the operating point corresponding to this spray deposition flux was located at and above the sticky-point curve. Hence, both particle stickiness and flow patterns affect the wall deposition of particles in a spray dryer. This work also investigated the effect of wall properties, namely a non-stick food grade material (nylon), adhesive tape and stainless steel, on the spray deposition flux of skim milk powder on the walls. The effect of electrostatics on wall deposition was studied by grounding the spray dryer and an <b>anti-static</b> <b>agent</b> was added to the skim milk to investigate if altering the properties of the feed material could reduce wall deposition. This work has quantitatively confirmed that cohesion occurs at the same rate as adhesion for skim milk powder in this spray dryer, because firstly, decreasing the adhesion tendency of the v wall by using nylon coating had no significant effect on the spray deposition flux compared with a smooth stainless steel wall and a wall covered with a double-sided adhesive tape; and secondly the powder collected on the walls was a linear function of time with and without adhesive on the plates. Furthermore, using a nylon coated wall did not eliminate wall deposition, and the wall deposition flux was found to be the same as when a stainless steel wall was used. This result further supports the finding here that spray deposition on the walls for skim milk powder is controlled by cohesion rather than adhesion. The spray dryer operating parameters that gave rise to the least spray deposition flux on the walls were a swirl vane angle of 0 o, an inlet air temperature of 230 oC and a process fluid flowrate of 1. 4 kg hr- 1. Decreasing the feed flowrate from 1. 8 kg hr- 1 to 1. 4 kg hr- 1 (decrease by 24 %), with the inlet air temperature and swirl vane angle held constant, decreased the wall deposition flux by 43 % from 7 g m- 2 hr- 1 to 4 g m- 2 hr- 1. Since the spray deposition flux on the walls decreased by 43 % when the feed flowrate was decreased by 24 %, it might be considered that the production process is in favour of a decrease in the feed flowrate to 1. 4 kg hr- 1 in this dryer, and consequently a decrease in the spray deposition flux on the walls per unit production output. Finally, this work investigated if the outlet moisture content from this small spray dryer used here was equilibrium limited or controlled by drying kinetics. The findings in this work confirmed the product moisture locus concept, which implies that the outlet moisture content of the skim milk particles approaches the equilibrium moisture content (in equilibrium with the outlet gas), and that the outlet moisture content of spray-dried food material containing carbohydrates is probably not limited by particle drying kinetics, even though the spray dryer is smaller (diameter 0. 8 m, height 2 m) than those used in the dairy industry, typically with a diameter of 30 m and a height of 10 m...|$|E
