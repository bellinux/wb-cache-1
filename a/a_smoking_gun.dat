5|$|When {{trying to}} explain past phenomena, paleontologists and other {{historical}} scientists often construct a set of hypotheses about the causes and then look for <b>a</b> <b>smoking</b> <b>gun,</b> a {{piece of evidence that}} indicates that one hypothesis is a better explanation than others. Sometimes the smoking gun is discovered by a fortunate accident during other research. For example, the discovery by Luis Alvarez and Walter Alvarez of an iridium-rich layer at the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary made asteroid impact and volcanism the most favored explanations for the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.|$|E

25|$|As president, Zardari {{called for}} a United Nations {{investigation}} into his wife's assassination. In 2009, Secretary General Ban Ki-moon established a three-person team to lead the investigation comprising the Chilean Heraldo Muñoz, Irish Peter FitzGerald, and Indonesian Marzuki Darusman. Although {{it was not in}} the commission's remit to identify a culprit, Muñoz later expressed the view that the assassination was likely carried out by the Pakistani Taliban, perhaps with the support of Mehsud, and that they may well have been assisted by rogue elements in the country's intelligence agencies. He also expressed the view that the original police investigation had been deliberately botched. In February 2012, the Pakistani official enquiry issued its final report, placing responsibility for the attack with 27 different militant groups. In May 2013, the state's main prosecutor in the Bhutto case, Zulfikar Ali, was himself assassinated in Islamabad. There was never <b>a</b> <b>smoking</b> <b>gun</b> in the Bhutto investigation.|$|E

40|$|The {{stability}} of Bose gases near resonance {{has been a}} puzzling problem in recent years. In this Letter, we demonstrate {{that in addition to}} generating thermal pressure, thermal atoms enhance the repulsiveness of the scale-dependent interactions between condensed atoms due to renormalization effect and further stabilize the Bose gases. Consequently, we find that, as a precursor of instability, the compressibility develops an anomalous structure as a function of scattering length and is drastically reduced compared with the mean-field value. Furthermore, the density profile of a Bose gas in a harmonic trap is found to develop a flat top near the center. This is due to the anomalous behavior of compressibility and can be <b>a</b> potential <b>smoking</b> <b>gun</b> for probing such an effect. Comment: 5 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
500|$|On 6 November 2013, Al Jazeera {{reported}} that the Swiss forensic team had found levels of polonium in Arafat's ribs and pelvis 18 to 36 times the average. According to the Swiss expert team (including notably experts in radio-chemistry, radio-physics and legal medicine), on a probability scale ranging from one to six, death by polonium poisoning is around five. While Al Jazeera {{reported that}} the scientist were [...] "confident up to an 83 percent level" [...] that polonium poisoning occurred, but Francois Bochud (the head of the Swiss team) clarified to Al Jazeera {{that this is not}} the case and that the scale does not allow a simple division like this; he stated only that the poisoning hypothesis by polonium is [...] "reasonably supported". [...] Forensic Biologist Nathan Lents of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said the report's results are consistent with a possible polonium poisoning, but [...] "There's certainly not <b>a</b> <b>smoking</b> <b>gun</b> here." [...] Derek Hill, a professor in radiological science at University College London who was not involved in the investigation, said [...] "I would say it's clearly not overwhelming proof, and there is a risk of contamination (of the samples), but it is a pretty strong signal. ...

40|$|The {{merger of}} a super-massive {{binary black hole}} (SBBH) {{is one of the}} most extreme events in the {{universe}} with a huge amount of energy released by gravitational radiation. Although the characteristic gravitational wave (GW) frequency around the merger event is far higher than the nHz regime optimal for pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), nonlinear GW memory might be <b>a</b> critical <b>smoking</b> <b>gun</b> of the merger event detectable with PTAs. In this paper, basic aspects of this interesting observation are discussed for SBBHs, and the detection numbers of their memory and inspiral GWs are estimated for ongoing and planned PTAs. We find that the expected detection number would be smaller than unity for the two-types of signals even with the Square Kilometer Array. We also provide various scaling relations that would be useful to study detection probabilities of GWs from individual SBBHs with PTAs. Comment: 5 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
40|$|A {{predictive}} Leptogenesis {{scenario is}} presented {{based on the}} Minimal Lepton Flavour Violation symmetry. In the realisation with three right-handed neutrinos transforming under the same flavour symmetry of the lepton electroweak doublets, lepton masses and PMNS mixing parameters can be described according to the current data, including a large Dirac CP phase. The observed matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe can be achieved through Leptogenesis, with the CP asymmetry parameter ε {{described in terms of}} only lepton masses, mixings and phases, plus two real parameters of the low-energy effective description. This is in contrast with the large majority of models present in the literature, where ε depends on several high-energy parameters, preventing a direct connection between low-energy observables and the baryon to photon ratio today. Recovering the correct amount of baryon asymmetry in the Universe constrains the Majorana phases of the PMNS matrix within specific ranges of values: clear predictions for the neutrinoless double beta decay emerge, representing <b>a</b> potential <b>smoking</b> <b>gun</b> for this framework.

60|$|The {{darkness}} lightened, {{turned to}} slow-drifting haze, and lifted. Through {{a thin film}} of blue smoke she saw the rough-hewn timbers of the court roof.
