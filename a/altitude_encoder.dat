50|$|The <b>altitude</b> <b>encoder</b> was cleaned in November 2006 {{since the}} {{automatic}} calibration procedure stopped working in October. The hydraulic motor {{for the lower}} hatch broke on 13 December 2006 prohibiting low altitude observations. It was repaired by January 2.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A typical <b>altitude</b> <b>encoder,</b> the ACK Technologies A-30. Note the 15-way D-type {{connector}} to {{send the}} Gillham code to the transponder and the port {{on the top of}} the case that connects to the aircraft's static pressure system.|$|E
50|$|A Mode A {{transponder}} code response can be augmented by a pressure altitude response, {{which is then}} referred to as Mode C operation. Pressure altitude is obtained from an <b>altitude</b> <b>encoder,</b> either a separate self-contained unit mounted in the aircraft or {{an integral part of}} the transponder. The altitude information is passed to the transponder using a modified form of the Gray code called a Gillham Code.|$|E
50|$|Typical {{installations}} {{also include}} an <b>altitude</b> <b>encoder,</b> {{which is a}} small device connected to both the transponder and the aircraft's static system. It provides the aircraft's pressure altitude to the transponder, so that it may relay {{the information to the}} ATC facility. The encoder uses 11 wires to pass altitude information to the transponder {{in the form of a}} Gillham Code, a modified binary Gray code.|$|E
50|$|The <b>altitude</b> <b>encoder</b> was cleaned {{again in}} January 2011 since the {{automatic}} calibration procedure started to fail. In February, the archive HDD {{was moved to}} a new computer due to compatibility problems. A new UBVRI filter set was installed in the late winter because the old filters had degraded and it was not known if they were physically damaged or just dirty. After cleaning it was established that they was just dirty.|$|E
50|$|Different {{classes of}} <b>altitude</b> <b>encoder</b> {{do not use}} all of the {{available}} bits. All use the A, B and C bits; increasing altitude limits require more of the D bits. Up to and including 30700 ft does not require any of the D bits. This is suitable for most light general aviation aircraft. Up to and including 62700 ft requires D4. Up to and including 126700 ft requires D4 and D2. Note that D1 is never used.|$|E
50|$|Mode 3/A uses a P1 to P3 spacing of 8.0 μs, {{and is used}} {{to request}} the beacon code, which was {{assigned}} to the aircraft by the controller to identify it. Mode C uses a spacing of 21 μs, and requests the aircraft's pressure altitude, provided by the <b>altitude</b> <b>encoder.</b> Mode 2 uses a spacing of 5 μs and requests the aircraft to transmit its Military identification code. The latter is only assigned to Military aircraft and so {{only a small percentage of}} aircraft actually reply to a mode 2 interrogation.|$|E
50|$|An <b>altitude</b> <b>encoder</b> {{takes the}} form of a small metal box {{containing}} a pressure sensor and signal conditioning electronics. The pressure sensor is often heated, which requires a warm-up time during which height information is either unavailable or inaccurate. Older style units can have a warm-up time of up to 10 minutes; more modern units warm up in less than 2 minutes. Some of the very latest encoders incorporate unheated 'instant on' type sensors. During the warm-up of older style units the height information may gradually increase until it settles at its final value. This is not normally a problem as the power would typically be applied before the aircraft enters the runway and so it would be transmitting correct height information soon after take-off.|$|E
40|$|An {{optically}} coupled pressure <b>altitude</b> <b>encoder</b> {{which can be}} incorporated into commercially available inexpensive general aviation altimeters was successfully developed. The encoding of pressure altitude is accomplished in 100 -ft (30. 48 -m) increments from - 1000 to 20, 000 ft (- 304. 8 to 6096 m). The prototype encoders were retrofitted into two different internal altimeter configurations. A prototype encoder was checked for accuracy of transition points and environmental effects. Each altimeter configuration, with the encoder incorporated, was laboratory tested for performance and was subsequently flight-tested over the specified altitude range. With few exceptions, the assembled altimeter-encoder met aeronautical standards for altimeters and encoders. Design changes are suggested to improve performance to meet required standards consistently...|$|E
