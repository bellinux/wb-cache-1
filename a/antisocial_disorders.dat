50|$|Men {{and women}} do not differ on their overall rates of psychopathology; however, certain {{disorders}} are more prevalent in women, and vice versa. Women have higher rates of anxiety and depression (internalizing disorders) and men have higher rates of substance abuse and <b>antisocial</b> <b>disorders</b> (externalizing disorders). It is believed that divisions {{of power and the}} responsibilities set upon each sex are critical to this predisposition. Namely, women earn less money than men do, they tend to have jobs with less power and autonomy, and women are more responsive to problems of people in their social networks. These three differences can contribute to women's predisposition to anxiety and depression. It is believed that socializing practices that encourage high self-regard and mastery would benefit the mental health of both women and men.|$|E

Sarah Rosenfield uses this theory to argue that males and females develop different types of symptoms when they are mentally ill. Men tend to display externalized symptoms, expressing problematic emotions in outward behavior. Women tend to develop internalized symptoms, where problematic feelings are directed towards the self. In accordance with the internalized-externalized dichotomy, women are more commonly diagnosed with mental illnesses such as anxiety, depression, and phobias.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{investigated}} deliberate self-harm (DSH) in young inmates. The objectives are twofold: first, {{to identify the}} social and clinical characteristics of inmates who commit DSH; and secondly, to ascertain the types of personality who are vulnerable {{in order to be}} able to predict future inmates who may harm themselves. A cross-sectional design was used to study psychosocial correctional personality characteristics and clinical pictures in inmates with DSH versus a control group without DSH. The measures used to evaluate different variables were a standard protocol and a self-report questionnaire (MCMI-II). Although the two groups compared are homogeneous and similar in terms of different psychosocial variables, inmates with DSH presented a significant background of maltreatment. Borderline, passive-aggressive, and antisocial personality disorders best discriminated both groups. The detection of borderline, negativistic, and <b>antisocial</b> <b>disorders</b> may help the medical services of penitentiary centers to predict youths with a possible risk of DSH.

40|$|Pathological gambling, {{alongside}} addictive and <b>antisocial</b> <b>disorders,</b> forms {{part of a}} broad psychopathological {{spectrum of}} externalizing disorders, which share an underlying genetic vulnerability. The shared externalizing propensity is a highly heritable, continuously varying trait. Disinhibitory personality traits such as impulsivity and novelty seeking (NS) function as indicators of this broad shared externalizing tendency, which may reflect, at the neurobiological level, variation in the reactivity of dopaminergic (DAergic) brain reward systems centered on the ventral striatum (VS). Here, we examined whether individual differences in ventral striatal dopamine (DA) synthesis capacity were associated with individual variation in disinhibitory personality traits. Twelve healthy male volunteers underwent 6 -[18 F]Fluoro-L-DOPA (FDOPA) positron emission tomography (PET) scanning to measure striatal DA synthesis capacity, and completed a measure of disinhibited personality (NS). We found that levels of ventral, but not dorsal, striatal DA synthesis capacity were significantly correlated with inter-individual variation in disinhibitory personality traits, particularly a propensity for financial extravagance and irresponsibility. Our {{results are consistent with}} preclinical models of behavioral disinhibition and addiction proneness, and provide novel insights into the neurobiology of personality based vulnerability to pathological gambling and other externalizing disorders...|$|E
40|$|Guilt is {{a central}} moral emotion due to its {{inherent}} link to norm violations, thereby affecting both individuals and society. Furthermore, the nature and specificity of guilt is still debated in psychology and philosophy, {{particularly with regard to}} the differential involvement of self-referential representations in guilt relative to shame. Here, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in healthy volunteers, we identified specific brain regions associated with guilt by comparison with the 2 most closely related emotions, shame and sadness. To induce high emotional intensity, we used an autobiographical memory paradigm where participants relived during fMRI scanning situations from their own past that were associated with strong feelings of guilt, shame, or sadness. Compared with the control emotions, guilt episodes specifically recruited a region of right orbitofrontal cortex, which was also highly correlated with individual propensity to experience guilt (Trait Guilt). Guilt-specific activity was also observed in the paracingulate dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, a critical "Theory of Mind" region, which overlapped with brain areas of self-referential processing identified in an independent task. These results provide new insights on the unique nature of guilt as a "self-conscious" moral emotion and the neural bases of <b>antisocial</b> <b>disorders</b> characterized by impaired guilt processing...|$|E

40|$|Background Men with <b>antisocial</b> {{personality}} <b>disorder</b> show lifelong abnormalities in adaptive {{decision making}} {{guided by the}} weighing up of reward and punishment information. Among men with <b>antisocial</b> personality <b>disorder,</b> modifi cation of the behaviour of those with additional diagnoses of psychopathy seems particularly resistant to punishment. Methods We did a case-control functional MRI (fMRI) study in 50 men, of whom 12 were violent off enders with <b>antisocial</b> personality <b>disorder</b> and psychopathy, 20 were violent off enders with <b>antisocial</b> personality <b>disorder</b> but not psychopathy, and 18 were healthy non-off enders. We used fMRI to measure brain activation associated with the representation of punishment or reward information during an event-related probabilistic response-reversal task, assessed with standard general linear-model-based analysis. Findings Offenders with <b>antisocial</b> personality <b>disorder</b> and psychopathy displayed discrete regions of increased activation in the posterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula in response to punished errors during the task reversal phase, and decreased activation to all correct rewarded responses in the superior temporal cortex. This finding was in contrast to results for off enders without psychopathy and healthy non-off enders. Interpretation Punishment prediction error signalling in off enders with <b>antisocial</b> personality <b>disorder</b> and psychopathy was highly atypical. This finding challenges the widely held view that such men are simply characterised by diminished neural sensitivity to punishment. Instead, this fi nding indicates altered organisation of the information processing system responsible for reinforcement learning and appropriate decision making. This difference between violent offenders with <b>antisocial</b> personality <b>disorder</b> with and without psychopathy has implications for the causes of these disorders and for treatment approaches...|$|R
40|$|Bruxism has a multifactorial etiology, {{and psychosocial}} {{factors have been}} {{considered}} to {{increase the risk of}} occurrence of this parafunction. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the behavior profile of a group of children diagnosed with bruxism. Eighty 7 - 11 -year-old children of both genders (mean age 8. 8 years) first recruited as eligible participants. Twenty-nine children (18 males and 11 females) whose parents/guardians reported to present frequent episodes of tooth grinding/clenching while awake or during sleep (at least 3 nights a week) in the previous 3 months were enrolled in the study. The diagnosis of bruxism was established based on the parents/guardians' report about the children's behavior, habits and possible discomforts in the components of the stomatognathic system allied to the presence of signs and symptoms such as pain on the masticatory muscles, masseter muscle hypertrophy, wear facets, fractures of restorations, dental impressions on the cheek mucosa and tongue. As part of the psychological evaluation, the Rutter's Child Behavior Scale-A 2 was applied to the parents/caregivers (one for each child) and the Child Stress Scale was applied to the children. Data were analyzed descriptively based on the frequency of each studied variable.

40|$|Background and Aim: Bruxism {{has been}} defined as a diurnal or nocturnal parafunctional habit. Etiology of bruxism has {{remained}} controversial and some investigators believe that psychological factors may {{play a major role in}} promoting and perpetuating this habit. The aim of this case-control study was to assess the existence of an association between bruxism and psychosocial disorders in adolescents., Participants were chosen among 114, 12 - 14 year old students (girls). They were divided into two groups, bruxers and nonbruxers, on the basis of both validated clinical criteria and interview with each patient. A few participants were excluded on the basis of presence of systemic disorders, TMJ disorders, other oral habits, primary teeth, defective restorations and premature contacts. Following matching of two groups in regard to parent&#x 2032;s age and education, mother&#x 2032;s marital status, child support status, mother&#x 2032;s employment status, and socio-economical status, 25 cases and 25 controls were enlisted. A self report validated questionnaire (YSR, 11 - 18 yr) was then filled out by both groups for the evaluation of 12 psychosocial symptoms. Results: Remarkable differences in certain psychosocial aspects were found between the two groups. Prevalence of psychosocial disorders including Thought Disorders (P < 0. 005), Conduct Disorders (P < 0. 05), <b>Antisocial</b> <b>Disorders</b> (P < 0. 06) as identified by YSR was significantly higher in bruxers. Significant differences between the two groups also emerged in total YSR scores (P < 0. 005). The results of Odds Ratio revealed that a bruxer adolescent has 16 times greater probability for psychosocial disorders than a non-bruxer one. Fischer exact test and T-test were used and Odds Ratio and Confidence Interval was estimated. Conclusion: Support to the existence of an association between bruxism and psychosocial disorders has been provided...|$|E
40|$|The article {{describes}} {{the development of the}} self-report Questionnaire of Personality Disorders (VMO), which was constructed on the basis of DSM-IV classification for personality disorders(American Psychiatric Association, 1994), Beck&# 39;s theory of dysfunctional cognitive schemas (Beck in Freeman, 1990) and psychoanalytic theories of basic personality structures. We focused on the basic experiencing of self and others, which is characteristic of specific personality type. In regard to these theories we believe that personality disorder is a broader term; the disorders within it are not limited to existing DSM-IV axis II categories. The personality disorders are complex phenomenon, which are better described on dimensional then categorical scales as well. The questionnaire consists of 213 items, which correspond to 12 clinical scales (for histrionic, obsessive-compulsive, passive-aggressive, avoidant, dependent, depressive, narcissistic, borderline, antisocial, paranoid, schizoid and schizotypal personality disorders) and a lie scale. According to the personality organization theory (Kernberg, 1986) and other psychoanalytic theories it is divided into four parts: for neurotic (histrionic, obsessive-compulsive, passive-aggressive and avoidant disorders), depressive (dependent and depressive disorders), borderline (narcissistic, borderline and <b>antisocial</b> <b>disorders)</b> and psychotic disorders (paranoid, schizoid and schizotypal disorders). The questionnaire was administered to 415 adult psychiatric patients and 215 health persons of both sexes. They were compared according to the responses of the questionnaire. The internal reliability of scales is sufficient, but correlation between scales is quite strong. The validity was tested with the Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire (PDQ- 4, Hyler, 1994) and through comparing of the results of healthy individuals and psychiatric patients with different diagnosis. The results are generally in accordance with the expectations and support the connection between different personality organizations and specific mental disorders. Validation of the questionnaire with the factor analysis still has to be made...|$|E

5000|$|In {{addition}} to these two courses that are recognized by the DSM-IV-TR, {{there appears to be}} a relationship among oppositional defiant disorder, conduct <b>disorder</b> and <b>antisocial</b> personality <b>disorder.</b> Specifically, research has demonstrated continuity in the disorders such that conduct disorder is often diagnosed in children who have been previously diagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder, and most adults with <b>antisocial</b> personality <b>disorder</b> were previously diagnosed with conduct disorder. For example, some research has shown that 90% of children diagnosed with conduct disorder had a previous diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder. [...] Moreover, both disorders share relevant risk factors and disruptive behaviors, suggesting that oppositional defiant disorder is a developmental precursor and milder variant of conduct disorder. However, this is not to say that this trajectory occurs in all individuals. In fact, only about 25% of children with oppositional defiant disorder will receive a later diagnosis of conduct disorder. [...] Correspondingly, there is an established link between conduct disorder and the diagnosis of <b>antisocial</b> personality <b>disorder</b> as an adult. In fact, the current diagnostic criteria for <b>antisocial</b> personality <b>disorder</b> require a conduct disorder diagnosis before the age of 15.
