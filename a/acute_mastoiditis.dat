5000|$|The {{pathophysiology}} of mastoiditis is straightforward: bacteria {{spread from}} the middle ear to the mastoid air cells, where the inflammation causes damage to the bony structures. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis {{are the most common}} organisms recovered in <b>acute</b> <b>mastoiditis.</b> Organisms that are rarely found are Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Gram-negative aerobic bacilli, and anaerobic bacteria. P. aeruginosa, Enterobacteriaceae, S. aureus and anaerobic bacteria (Prevotella, Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, and Peptostreptococcus spp. [...] ) are the most common isolates in chronic mastoiditis. Rarely, Mycobacterium species can also cause the infection. Some mastoiditis is caused by cholesteatoma, which is a sac of keratinizing squamous epithelium in the middle ear that usually results from repeated middle-ear infections. If left untreated, the cholesteatoma can erode into the mastoid process, producing mastoiditis, as well as other complications.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{characteristics}} of <b>acute</b> <b>mastoiditis</b> in children in different age groups {{in order to identify}} risk groups and risk factors for <b>acute</b> <b>mastoiditis.</b> METHODS: Records for all children aged 0 - 16 years treated for <b>acute</b> <b>mastoiditis</b> during 1993 - 2007 at 33 Ear, Nose and Throat departments in Sweden were reviewed retrospectively according to defined criteria for <b>acute</b> <b>mastoiditis.</b> RESULTS: A total of 678 cases fulfilled the inclusion criteria. <b>Acute</b> <b>mastoiditis</b> was most common in children younger than two years of age and this group was characterized by less prior history of other diseases and ear diseases, fewer visits to health care centers and less antibiotic treatment before admission, shorter duration of symptoms before admission, hospitalization for fewer days and lower frequency of complications and mastoidectomies. These children also showed a higher incidence of clinical findings, increased inflammatory markers such as fever and heightened counts of C-reactive protein and white blood cells compared with older children. They also tested positive for significantly more samples of Streptococcus pneumoniae while the older children more often exhibited growth of Streptococcus pyogenes or Pseudomonas aeruginosa or no microbial growth. CONCLUSIONS: The characteristics of pediatric <b>acute</b> <b>mastoiditis</b> differed significantly between age groups. <b>Acute</b> <b>mastoiditis</b> was most common in children younger than two years of age. They showed more rapid progress of symptoms and more distinct signs of <b>acute</b> <b>mastoiditis.</b> This is probably the reason why parents rapidly seek medical care for small children and hospital treatment thus starts earlier in the youngest children, which may in turn explain the excellent outcome. This study showed that younger children have neither more severe <b>acute</b> <b>mastoiditis</b> nor more complications than older ones. The differences between age groups suggest that there are distinctions in the pathophysiology behind the onset and course of <b>acute</b> <b>mastoiditis</b> in younger and older children...|$|E
40|$|Objectives To {{investigate}} the internal {{validity of the}} diagnosis code used at discharge after treatment of <b>acute</b> <b>mastoiditis.</b> Design Retrospective national re-evaluation study of patient records 19932007 and make comparison with the original ICD codes. Setting All ENT departments at university hospitals and one large county hospital department in Sweden. Participants A total of 1966 records were reviewed for patients with ICD codes for in-patient treatment of acute (529), chronic (44) and unspecified mastoiditis (21) and acute otitis media (1372). Main outcome measures ICD codes were reviewed by the authors with a defined protocol for the clinical diagnosis of <b>acute</b> <b>mastoiditis.</b> Those not satisfying the diagnosis were given an alternative diagnosis. Results Of 529 records with ICD coding for <b>acute</b> <b>mastoiditis,</b> 397 (75 %) were found to meet the definition of <b>acute</b> <b>mastoiditis</b> used in this study, while 18 % were not diagnosed as having any type of mastoiditis after review. Review of the in-patients treated for acute media otitis identified an additional 60 cases fulfilling the definition of <b>acute</b> <b>mastoiditis.</b> Overdiagnosis was common, and many patients with a diagnostic code indicating <b>acute</b> <b>mastoiditis</b> had been treated for external otitis or otorrhoea with transmyringeal drainage.

40|$|This {{retrospective}} study reviews our {{experience in the}} management of acute otomastoiditis over 10 years. During the study period we identified 40 cases in children aged 3 months/ 15 years with a peak incidence in the second year of life. Sixty per cent of them had a history of acute otitis media (AOM). All the children were already receiving oral antibiotic therapy. Otalgia, fever, poor feeding and vomiting were the most common symptoms, all the children had evidence of retroauricolar inflammation. Computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were used to support the diagnosis and to evaluate possible complications. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common isolated bacterium. All the patients received intravenous antibiotics, 65 % of children received only medical treatment, 35 % also underwent surgical intervention. Mean length of hospital stay was 12. 3 days. Cholesteathoma was diagnosed in one child. We conclude from our study that acute otomastoiditis is a disease mainly affecting young children, that develops from AOM resistant to oral antibiotics. Adequate initial management always requires intravenous antibiotics, conservative surgical treatment with miryngotomy is appropriate in children not responding within 48 h from beginning of therapy.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To study {{whether the}} {{incidence}} {{and characteristics of}} <b>acute</b> <b>mastoiditis</b> in children changed in Sweden following {{the introduction of new}} guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of acute otitis media advocating "watchful waiting" as an option in children 2 - 16 years of age with uncomplicated acute otitis media. METHODS: The records for all patients treated for mastoiditis during 1993 - 2007 at all Ear, Nose and Throat departments in Sweden were reviewed retrospectively according to defined criteria for <b>acute</b> <b>mastoiditis.</b> In this study the data from children aged 0 - 16 years were analyzed and compared 71 / 2 years before and 71 / 2 years after the introduction of the new guidelines in 2000. RESULTS: A total of 577 cases aged 0 - 16 years fulfilled the inclusion criteria during the whole study period. Cases involving cholesteatoma were excluded. The number of children affected by <b>acute</b> <b>mastoiditis</b> did not increase after the introduction of new guidelines. <b>Acute</b> <b>mastoiditis</b> was most common in children younger than two years of age. The proportion of <b>acute</b> <b>mastoiditis</b> increased after 2000 in the group aged 2 - 23 months although they were not affected concerning treatment by the new guidelines. No decrease was found in the frequency of prehospital antibiotic treatment among the children admitted with <b>acute</b> <b>mastoiditis,</b> and no increase was seen in the duration of ear symptoms before hospital admission, duration of hospital stay, or in the frequency of complications or mastoidectomies, after the introduction of the new guidelines in either group of children. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of <b>acute</b> <b>mastoiditis</b> in children in Sweden did not increase following the introduction of new guidelines in 2000 for the diagnosis and treatment of acute otitis media. This is despite the fact that a significant decrease in antibiotic prescriptions for otitis media has been reported during the same time period. The characteristics of <b>acute</b> <b>mastoiditis</b> reflecting severity of illness did not change over time. <b>Acute</b> <b>mastoiditis</b> was most common and increased after 2000 only in children younger than two years of age in which antibiotics were still recommended in all cases of acute otitis media...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, facial {{paralysis}} is an uncommon complication of acute {{inflammation of the}} middle ear, with an estimated incidence of 0. 005 %; {{it was not so}} rare in the pre-antibiotic era, occurring in 0. 5 - 0. 7 % of middle ear inflammatory processes.

40|$|Introduction. Etiopathogenetically, {{there are}} two types of chollesteatomas: congenital, and acquired. Numerous {{theories}} in the literature try to explain the nature of the disease, however, the question about cholesteatomas remain still unanswered. The aim of the study was to present a case of external ear canal cholesteatoma (EEC) developed following microsurgery (ventilation tube insertion and mastoidectomy), as well as to point ant possible mechanisms if its development. Case report. A 16 -yearold boy presented a 4 -month sense of fullness in the ear and otalgia on the left side. A year before, mastoidectomy and posterior atticotomy were performed with ventilation tube placement due to <b>acute</b> purulent <b>mastoiditis.</b> Diagnosis was based on otoscopy examination, audiology and computed tomography (CT) findings. CT showed an obliterative soft-tissue mass completely filled the external ear canal with associated erosion of subjacent the bone. There were squamous epithelial links between the canal cholesteatoma and lateral tympanic membrane surface. They originated from the margins of tympanic membrane incision made for a ventilation tube (VT) insertion. The position of VT was good as well as the aeration of the middle ear cavity. The tympanic membrane was intact and of normal appearance without middle ear extension or mastoid involvement of cholesteatoma. Cholesteatoma and ventilation tube were both removed. The patient recovered without complications and shortly audiology revealed hearing improving. Follow-up 2 years later, however, showed no signs of the disease. Conclusion. There could be more than one potential delicate mechanism of developing EEC in the ear with VT insertion and mastoidectomy. It is necessary to perform routine otologic surveillance in all patients with tubes. Affected ear CT scan is very helpful in showing the extent of cholesteatoma and bony defects, which could not be assessed by otoscopic examination alone...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: <b>Acute</b> <b>mastoiditis</b> {{is serious}} {{otological}} condition which may cause difficult, sometimes fatal complications. The {{aim of the}} study is to present our experiences in diagnosis and treatment of <b>acute</b> <b>mastoiditis</b> in children. MATERIALS and METHODS: Medical records of 52 children with diagnosis of <b>acute</b> <b>mastoiditis</b> were reviewed retrospectively. Data on clinical presen-tation, laboratory tests, microbiological and radiological features, prehospital treatment and delay in making the diagnosis, hospital treatment and outcome were analyzed. A relationship between white blood cell count or level of C-reactive protein and therapeutic protocols was investigated. RESULTS: All children were admitted as emergency patients and were treated with intravenous antibiotics. Almost 15 % of patients were not exam-ined by a doctor prior to hospitalization. The conservative treatment was successfully conducted in 15 % of patients. One-third of the patients were recovered after myringotomy.

40|$|Objectives: We {{aimed to}} figure out {{clinical}} characteristics of pediatric <b>acute</b> <b>mastoiditis</b> and to plan a strategy {{for the management of}} these young patients. Methods: In this retrospective study we evaluated the medical records of 32 patients aged less than 16  years old, who were treated in our department for <b>acute</b> <b>mastoiditis</b> between 2000 and 2011. Results: The mean age of the population was 3. 7  years. In 6 children (18 %) previous pathologic conditions of the ear have been reported. All children had some evidence of post-auricular inflammation. Other symptoms such as auricular protrusion, otorrhea, fever and otalgia have been reported. White blood cell count showed elevated values of leucocytes in 72 % of the cases. Anemia was noted in 24 patients with a mean hemoglobin rate of 9  g/dl. Computerized tomographic scan of the petrous temporal bones was required in 27 children. In our series, 19 patients had subperiosteal abscess and 3 children presented involvement of the central nervous system.

40|$|Mastoiditis aguda: aumento de su incidencia y controversias en el tratamiento antibiótico SUMMARY An {{important}} {{complication of}} {{acute otitis media}} is <b>acute</b> <b>mastoiditis</b> which responds to antibiotic therapy and myringotomy. Patients with <b>acute</b> <b>mastoiditis</b> were reviewed during 1996 - 2005 in the tertiary University Children’s Hospital in Madrid. The number of patients with <b>acute</b> <b>mastoiditis</b> increased by about 2 -fold during this period. Of 205 children with mastoiditis, ranging from 0. 6 - 17 years of age, surgical treat-ment was needed in about 4. 3 % in 1996 and in 70 % in 2005. In spite of 80 % of the children having received antibiotics at the pediatric visit, the number of complications increased (periostitis, subperiosteal abscess), {{and the number of}} surgical interventions increased by 8 -fold. Etiological agents were Streptococcus pneumoniae (28. 5 %) and Staphylococcus aureus (16. 3 %). Negative cultures were obtained in 53. 6 % of cases.

40|$|A {{middle ear}} cholesteatoma is a {{dangerous}} pathology, because it leads to intra and extracranial complications which are fatal [1].

40|$|BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: <b>Acute</b> <b>mastoiditis</b> {{has been}} {{increasingly}} reported. We reviewed {{our experience of}} mastoiditis in children {{in the era of}} expanding application of imaging tools and endless emerging antimicrobial resistance. METHODS: We reviewed all medical records of children (< 18 years of age) hospitalized with mastoiditis between January 2001 and December 2010. Diagnosis of mastoiditis was based on clinical features and confirmed by imaging studies. Patients were classified as having acute or nonacute mastoiditis according to the duration of the disease. <b>Acute</b> <b>mastoiditis</b> was defined as illness of less than 3 weeks prior to hospitalization. Cases of longer than 3 weeks' duration were defined as nonacute mastoiditis. We compared the clinical, laboratory and microbiological features of acute and nonacute mastoiditis. RESULTS: A total of 104 children were enrolled in this study, comprising 56 acute cases and 48 nonacute cases. Fever and coryza were significantly more common in acute cases. C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were both initially higher in <b>acute</b> <b>mastoiditis.</b> CRP, rather than ESR, declined faster in acute than in nonacute mastoiditis. Computerized tomography (CT) scans, but not plain films, were highly sensitive. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae accounted for 52 % of all isolates. Staphylococci, Pseudomonas spp. and polymicrobials were predominantly seen in non-acute mastoiditis. CONCLUSION: With the application of imaging studies, many cases of mastoiditis were identified.

This study reports the authors' experience {{in the treatment of}} children admitted with <b>acute</b> <b>mastoiditis</b> to the Pediatric Hospital of Cairo University throughout the year 2007, also we aimed to evaluate our current management of this serious disease. Methods Nineteen children were included in this study, 11 females and 8 males, their ages ranged from 9 months to 11 years. All children were treated with intravenous antibiotic on initial admission, myringotomy was considered for cases that did not respond to medical treatment for 48 hours, while cortical mastoidectomy (with myringotomy) was reserved for cases that presented initially with subperiosteal abscess with or without post-auricular fistula, cases with intracranial complications and for cases that showed no response to myringotomy (after 48 hours). Follow up of the patients was carried out for at least 1 year. Results Medical management alone was enough in 5 cases (26 %); all of them had erythematous tender mastoid on first presentation. Seven cases (37 %) needed myringotomy; 2 of them showed no response and they needed cortical mastoidectomy and the other 5 cases responded well except for 1 case that developed post-auricular subperiosteal abscess 2 months later necessitating cortical mastoidectomy with no evidence of recurrence till the end of the follow-up period. Seven cases (37 %) presented with subperiosteal abscess and they needed cortical mastoidectomy with myringotomy; they showed no recurrence till the end of the study. Conclusion Conservative management is an effective method in the treatment of non-complicated <b>acute</b> <b>mastoiditis,</b> but myringotomy should be considered if there is no response within 48 hours.

Herein we report {{a case of a}} 28 -day-old child with right aural atresia and {{ipsilateral}} mastoiditis requiring mastoidectomy. To our knowledge, this is the youngest case reported in the literature. Issues on diagnosis and management of mastoiditis in cases of aural atresia are further discussed. Based on our experience and on previous reported cases we conclude that mastoiditis is difficult to diagnose in a child with aural atresia. Moreover, mastoidectomy may be necessary, although identification of the facial nerve and consequent treatment of the atresia are usually too difficult to perform simultaneously...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Congenital cholesteatoma may be {{expected}} in abnormally developed ear, it may cause bony erosion {{of the middle ear}} cleft and extend to the infratemporal fossa. We present the first case of congenital cholesteatoma of the infratemporal fossa in a patient with congenital aural atresia that has been complicated with <b>acute</b> <b>mastoiditis.</b> Case presentation A sixteen year old Egyptian male patient presented with congenital cholesteatoma of the infratemporal fossa with congenital aural atresia complicated with <b>acute</b> <b>mastoiditis.</b> Two weeks earlier, the patient suffered pain necessitating hospital admission, magnetic resonance imaging revealed a soft tissue mass in the right infratemporal fossa. On presentation to our institute, Computerized tomography was done as a routine, it proved the diagnosis of mastoiditis, pure tone audiometry showed an air-bone gap of 60 dB. Cortical mastoidectomy was done for treatment of mastoiditis, removal of congenital cholesteatoma was carried out with reconstruction of external auditory canal. Follow-up of the patient for 2 years and 3 months showed a patent, infection free external auditory canal with an air-bone gap has been reduced to 35 db. One year after the operation; MRI was done and it showed no residual or recurrent cholesteatoma. Conclusions Congenital cholesteatoma of the infratemporal fossa in cases of congenital aural atresia can be managed safely even if it was associated with mastoiditis. It is an original case report of interest to the speciality of otolaryngology. </p...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study aims to {{investigate}} the clinical features and outcomes of <b>acute</b> <b>mastoiditis</b> in children referred to the ENT/Audiology Department of the University of Ferrara from January 1994 to December 2005. It also aims to discuss risk factors and to find predictors for surgery. METHODS: A retrospective study on case sheets of children with an <b>acute</b> <b>mastoiditis</b> diagnosis was carried out. Fifty-five cases fulfilled the inclusion criteria: they presented otoscopical evidence of acute otitis media and inflammatory findings of the mastoid area such as post-auricular swelling, redness or tenderness, protrusion of the auricle and/or radiological findings. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were only treated with antibiotic therapy, tympanocentesis alone was performed in 11 cases; in 5, a ventilation tube was positioned. Mastoidectomy was performed in 13 patients. The group who underwent mastoidectomy had a median hospital stay of 15 days (5 - 54), in this group were found the following complications: 1 meningitis, 1 meningo-encephalitis, 1 lateral and sigmoid sinus thrombosis, 1 facial palsy. CONCLUSION: the incidence of otomastoiditis {{does not seem to}} be decreasing, on the contrary, in some countries, it seems to be on the increase. Our experience cannot confirm a real increase of the incidence but we noted periodic variations during the time of observation. It is important, that careful attention is paid to the clinical assessment of children who are 2 -years old or under, as they seem to be more exposed to the risk of clinical complications; therefore, it is highly recommended that the otologist and the paediatrician collaborate closely...|$|E
40|$|Background/PurposeAcute {{mastoiditis}} {{has been}} increasingly reported. We reviewed {{our experience of}} mastoiditis in children {{in the era of}} expanding application of imaging tools and endless emerging antimicrobial resistance. MethodsWe reviewed all medical records of children (< 18 years of age) hospitalized with mastoiditis between January 2001 and December 2010. Diagnosis of mastoiditis was based on clinical features and confirmed by imaging studies. Patients were classified as having acute or nonacute mastoiditis according to the duration of the disease. <b>Acute</b> <b>mastoiditis</b> was defined as illness of less than 3 weeks prior to hospitalization. Cases of longer than 3 weeks’ duration were defined as nonacute mastoiditis. We compared the clinical, laboratory and microbiological features of acute and nonacute mastoiditis. ResultsA total of 104 children were enrolled in this study, comprising 56 acute cases and 48 nonacute cases. Fever and coryza were significantly more common in acute cases. C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were both initially higher in <b>acute</b> <b>mastoiditis.</b> CRP, rather than ESR, declined faster in acute than in nonacute mastoiditis. Computerized tomography (CT) scans, but not plain films, were highly sensitive. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae accounted for 52 % of all isolates. Staphylococci, Pseudomonas spp. and polymicrobials were predominantly seen in non-acute mastoiditis. ConclusionWith the application of imaging studies, many cases of mastoiditis were identified. The classical postauricular signs were present in only 10 % of patients. The presenting symptoms, inflammatory markers, pathogens, management and outcome were greatly influenced by the duration of the illness prior to admission...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to obtain {{comprehensive}} data on clinical presentation, microbiology, computed tomography, surgical findings and histology in acute, sub-acute and chronic mastoiditis. We performed a prospective, observational study in children under 16 years of age presenting to our institution during the 2 -year period beginning in April 2000. The children were examined and their condition treated in accordance with a standardized protocol elaborated by the paediatric, otolaryngology (ORL) and radiology departments. Thirty-eight patients were hospitalized (22 with <b>acute</b> <b>mastoiditis,</b> seven with sub-acute mastoiditis, nine with chronic mastoiditis). There were 30 complications present in 21 patients (55 %). Streptococcus pyogenes was the most common pathogen (7 / 24 cases), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (4 / 24 cases). Mastoid surgery was performed in 29 patients. Histology of mastoid tissue revealed predominantly acute inflammation in two cases, mixed acute/chronic inflammation in 19 cases and predominantly chronic inflammation in seven cases. Radiologic data were evaluated retrospectively. Spiral, volume-based high-resolution (HR) computed tomography (CT) of the temporal bone had a sensitivity of 100 %, specificity of 38 %, positive predictive value (PPV) of 50 % and negative predictive value (NPV) of 100 % in detecting coalescence of mastoid trabeculae. Cranial CT with contrast had a sensitivity of 80 %, specificity of 94 %, PPV of 80 % and NPV of 94 % in identifying intra-cranial extension. Conclusion: histological evidence suggests that sub-acute/chronic infection underlies not only sub-acute and chronic mastoiditis, but most cases of <b>acute</b> <b>mastoiditis</b> as well. HR-CT of the temporal bone is effective in ruling out coalescence. Cranial CT is valuable in identifying intra-cranial extension. Cranial and HR-CT are recommended in the examination of children with mastoiditis...|$|E
40|$|The March issue {{featured}} {{an article}} on the manage-ment of <b>acute</b> <b>mastoiditis.</b> 1 This article nicely summa-rizes the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment algorithm for mastoiditis in children. While reading it, however, there were 2 points that were concerning. First, the diagnosis and treatment algorithm (Figure 5) shows that in the absence of postauricular abscess, coales-cence of the air cells, or cortical bone erosion on com-puted tomography (CT) scan, these cases should be treated with antibiotics and observation. However, {{in the absence of any}} of these findings, this is no longer con-sidered mastoiditis, and is treated as a severe acute otitis media. It would be quite concerning for clinicians to even consider treating mastoiditis with antibiotic ther-apy alone, without otolaryngic consultation to perform...|$|E
