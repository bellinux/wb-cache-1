5000|$|The allium {{subfamily}} of the Amaryllidaceae {{sensu lato}} is treated in some systems {{as a separate}} family, the Alliaceae. Members of the subfamily are found worldwide, in temperate, subtropical and tropical regions. They are herbaceous perennials, usually with bulbs, although {{in some cases they}} have short rhizomes. The subfamily can be easily recognized by its characteristic smell (the smell of garlic and onions, singular enough to be called [...] "garlic odour"), by the very soft, fleshy leaves and the umbel-like inflorescence {{at the end of a}} stem (scape), which has small to medium flowers with a superior ovary. The subfamily is of considerable economic importance, being grown as vegetables and seasoning, medicinal plants and ornamentals. The genus Allium includes some of the most widely used edible plants, such as onion and shallot (varieties of Allium cepa), garlic (A. sativum and A. scordoprasum), leek (Allium ampeloprasum var. porrum), and various flavourings such as chives (<b>Allium</b> <b>schoenoprasum).</b> The organosulphur compounds responsible for the characteristic odour are believed to have antioxidant, antibiotic and anticarcinogenic properties, to stimulate the immune system and to be protective of liver functioning. The family also has important ornamentals, mainly from the dominant genus Allium, but also including genera such as Ipheion.|$|E

Methods: In this exprimental study, 72 male wistar Rats (250 - 300 g) were divided into 6 groups equally {{and at the same}} maintenance condition. strptozotosin (60 mg/kg) was used for diabetes induction 2 - 6 groups and then feed all of groups with usual food and water freely and we give them the Tribulus terrestris Extract, <b>Allium</b> <b>schoenoprasum</b> and Walnut leaves aqueous extract, mixture of 3 extracts and Glibenclamide orderly and daily after 72 hour in 2 - 6 groups additional food and water. serum glucose were determined before the study, and at 1 th and 4 th weeks after the study. Results: serum glucose was significantly lower in diabetic Rats of 2 - 6 groups(P< 0. 001) but Walnut leaves aqueous extract had maximum effects (P= 0. 002). Also the results show that using mixture of 3 extract wont have more effects on decreasing serum glucose. Conclusion: In spite of better effects of Walnut leaves aqueous extract on serum glucose rather than Tribulus terrestris Extract and <b>Allium</b> <b>schoenoprasum,</b> we can use them just as complemented common Diabetic medicine.

40|$|Chives (<b>Allium</b> <b>schoenoprasum)</b> {{continuously}} produce leaves {{during spring}} and summer, {{and continue to}} develop leaves in winter, although growth is slow (evergreen). They do not produce well-defined bulbs, whereas asatsuki (A. schoenoprasum var. foliosum) forms bulbs with leaf desiccation in summer. Bulb formation of F 1 progenies of chives × asatsuki and BC 1 plants obtained by crosses with asatsuki was investigated in this study. No F 1 progenies formed bulbs. The bulb formation of BC 1 was classified based on the bulbing ratio into two phenotypes, e. g. non-bulb-forming and bulb-forming types; however, the variation persisted in obvious bulb-forming and non-bulb-forming individuals. The index of the maximum thickness of scale leaves was an alternative to clearly segregate the BC 1 progenies into three types, e. g. no bulb formation, intermediate, and bulb-forming phenotypes. These results indicate that more than two recessive genes {{are involved in the}} bulb formation of chive. チャイブ（Allium schoenoprasum）は春から夏にかけて分げつを繰り返し，生育は遅くなるが，冬にも成長を続ける．チャイブは，夏季に明瞭な鱗茎を生産しないが，アサツキは鱗茎を生産する．本研究では，チャイブ×アサツキの F 1 個体および F 1 個体にアサツキを戻し交雑して得られた BC 1 個体について，鱗茎形成の有無を調査した．すべての F 1 個体は鱗茎を形成しなかった．鱗茎肥大率（球径／葉鞘径）に基づく分類で，BC 1 個体の鱗茎形成は，非結球型および結球型の 2 つのタイプに分かれた．しかしながら，鱗茎肥大率による分類では，これらの変異は連続的であるため結球型と非結球型とを区別するのは困難であった．そこで，鱗茎内の最大鱗葉厚に基づいて分類したところ，結球型，中間型および非結球型に明瞭に区別された．これらの結果より，チャイブにおける鱗茎形成には，少なくとも 2 つ以上の劣性遺伝子が関与していることが示唆された...|$|E

It is Allium cepa, Allium x proliferum, Allium fistulosum, Allium tuberosum, <b>Allium</b> <b>schoenoprasum,</b> Allium porrum, Allium cepa var. agregatum. Polyphenols are micronutrients that {{have been identified in}} plants. These secondary metabolites involved the defence against pathogens or sunlight (Pandey, Rizvi, 2009). The studies that follow up these substances have been shown to {{play a significant role in}} the prevention of degenerative diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases and neurodegenerative disease. The aim of this study was to determine the amount of myricetin, morin, luteolin, quercetin, apigenin and quercetin in selected types of vegetable grown in 2015 and 2016. The analysis was performed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Samples were lyophilized in advance and ready for analysis. The analysis resulted in the chromatogram from which was then calculated content of selected material.

40|$|Parsley (Petroselinum crispum) is commercialized either {{fresh or}} dried, {{alone or with}} chives (<b>Allium</b> <b>schoenoprasum),</b> forming the {{seasoning}} called “green seasoning ” (cheiro verde) (Heredia-Zarate et al., 2003). This specie is cultivated mainly by small farmers who send their production in natura to market or industry. One of the limiting factors for successful parsley cropping has been the difficulty in obtaining seeds that permit fast establishment with an ideal and uniform population, in other words, vigorous plants. This {{is due to the}} fact that the seeds are derived from inflorescences composed of sequentially formed umbels, that produce seeds with different degrees of maturity (Hawtuokn et al., 1962; Gray & Steckel, 1983). One of the characteristics related to seed maturation of parsley is the mericarps color, parsley fruit, commonly treated as seed-unit (Brasil, 2009 a) because, during this physiological process, the chlorophyll is degraded, soluble sugars are synthesized and soluble proteins modified (Adams et al., 1983; Steckel et al., 1989; Ward et al., 1992, 1995), altering the mericarps color. Even when the harvest is divided up the seed maturity varies in each umbel so that germination is uneven (Gray & Steckel, 1983; Pill & Kilian, 2000). Thus, seed emergence in the field takes up to four weeks or more, depending on the climatic conditions, soil management and irrigation. Therefore it is viable to use techniques that standardize the lots, accelerate germination and identify problems related to the seed, such as improving beneficiation, priming and image analysis (Nascimento, 2009; Rodrigues et al., 2009). Image analysis represented by the X-ray test is a promising technique due to the possibility of adding some new and essential information for seed lot quality control (Cícero & Banzatto-Junior, 2003). X-ray images show the seed parts, identify the degre...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} debated whether {{pollination}} success in nonrewarding plants that flower {{in association with}} nectar-producing plants will be diminished by competition for pollinator visits or, alternatively, enhanced through increased local abundance of pollinators (the magnet species effect). We experimentally evaluated these effects using the nonrewarding bumblebee-pollinated orchid Anacamptis morio and associated nectar-producing plants at a site in Sweden. Pollination success (estimated as pollen receipt and pollen removal) in A. morio was significantly greater for individuals translocated to patches of nectar-producing plants (Geum rivale and <b>Allium</b> <b>schoenoprasum)</b> than for individuals placed outside (similar to 20 m away) such patches. These results provide support {{for the existence of}} a facilitative magnet species effect in the interaction between certain nectar plants and A. morio. To determine the spatial scale of these interactions, we correlated the visitation rate to flowers of A. morio with the density of sympatric nectar plants in 1 -m(2) and 100 -m(2) plots centered around groups of translocated plants, and at the level of whole meadows (similar to 0. 5 - 2 ha). Visitation rate to flowers of A. morio was not correlated with the 1 -m(2) patch density of G. rivale and A. schoenoprasum, but showed a significant positive relationship with density of these nectar plants in 100 -m(2) plots. In addition, visitation to flowers of A. morio was strongly and positively related to the density of A. schoenoprasum {{at the level of the}} meadow. Choice experiments showed that bees foraging on the purple flowers of A. schoenoprasum (a particularly effective magnet species) visit the purple flowers of A. morio more readily (47. 6 % of choices) than bees foraging on the yellow flowers of Lotus corniculatus (17 % of choices). Overall similarity in flower color and shape may increase the probability that a pollinator will temporarily shift from a nectar-producing "magnet" plant to a nonrewarding plant. We discuss the possibility of a mimicry continuum between those orchids that exploit instinctive food-seeking behavior of pollinators and those that show an adaptive resemblance to nectar-producing plants...|$|E

Here, we report {{the results of a}} floristic inventory of the lower Coppermine River valley and vicinity, including Kugluk (Bloody Falls) Territorial Park and the hamlet of Kugluktuk. The study area is approximately 1, 200 km 2, extending from the forest-tundra south of the treeline to the Arctic coast. Vascular plant floristic data are based on a review of all previous collections from the area and more than 1, 200 new collections made in 2014. Results are presented in an annotated checklist, including citation of all specimens examined, comments on taxonomy and distribution, and photographs for a subset of taxa. The vascular plant flora comprises 300 species (311 taxa), a 36. 6 % increase from the 190 species documented by previous collections made in the area over the last century, and is considerably more diverse than other local floras on mainland Nunavut. We document 207 taxa for Kugluk (Bloody Falls) Territorial Park, an important protected area for plants on mainland Nunavut. A total of 190 taxa are newly recorded for the study area. Of these, 14 taxa (13 species and one additional variety) are newly recorded for Nunavut (<b>Allium</b> <b>schoenoprasum,</b> Carex capitata, Draba lonchocarpa, Eremogone capillaris subsp. capillaris, Sabulina elegans, Eleocharis quinqueflora, Epilobium cf. anagallidifolium, Botrychium neolunaria, Botrychium tunux, Festuca altaica, Polygonum aviculare, Salix ovalifolia var. arctolitoralis, Salix ovalifolia var. ovalifolia and Stuckenia pectinata), seven species are newly recorded for mainland Nunavut (Carex gynocrates, Carex livida, Cryptogramma stelleri, Draba simmonsii, Festuca viviparoidea subsp. viviparoidea, Juncus alpinoarticulatus subsp. americanus and Salix pseudomyrsinites) and 56 range extensions are reported. The psbA-trnH and rbcL DNA sequence data were used to help identify the three Botrychium taxa recorded in the study area. Three new combinations are proposed: Petasites frigidus subsp. sagittatus (Banks ex Pursh) Saarela, Carex petricosa subsp. misandroides (Fernald) Saarela and Carex simpliciuscula subsp. subholarctica (T. V. Egorova) Saarela...|$|E
40|$|Comparison {{of seven}} {{isolates}} of rust from leek (Allium porrum), three from chives (<b>Allium</b> <b>schoenoprasum),</b> one from A. scorodoprasum {{and one from}} A. babingtonii {{on the basis of}} telial and uredinial morphology showed there to be three morphologically distinct species. Application of these criteria to herbarium material confirmed these findings and showed the rust on leeks in the U. K. to be the same species found on European leeks, garlic and certain wild Allium spp. from the Mediterranean. It is suggested that the following names be adopted, viz. Puccinia allii (DC.) Rud. for the rust on leeks, Puccinia mixta Fuck. for the rust on chives and Uromyces ambiguus (DC) Lev. for the rust on A. babingtonii. Infection studies on isolates of each rust supported the morphological evidence, and showed the three species to have different, extensive but overlapping host ranges within the genus Allium. In the ampeloprasum complex, A. kurrat accessions were highly susceptible to leek rust whereas some accessions of A. ampeloprasum and A. babingtonii had high levels of quantitative resistance. There was no evidence of 'hypersensitive-type' resistance in the complex. Tests within one leek cultivar (Musselburgh) showed older plants to be more resistant than seedlings in at least two quantitative components. However leaf tissue appeared to become more susceptible to infection with age, except in the leaf tips, which did not change in susceptibility over time. Inoculation of 16 leek cultivars with leek rust isolates from different geographical areas, and subsequent analysis during the disease cycle of several components of resistance (viz; latent period, pustule density and pustule length) showed that some cultivars performed consistently better against all isolates. However, in most cases there was a considerable and complex cultivar-isolate-component interaction. There was no evidence of physiologic specialisation in the isolates, but low levels of specialisation could have been hidden by the high level of variation in the experiments. Comparison of field cultivars of garlic with equivalent virus-free material using an isolate of leek rust gave inconclusive results, and further study of the rust-garlic-virus interaction is recommended. Major trends in the infection/resistance studies included a high level of environmentally-dependent variation and a lack of 'hypersensitive-type' resistance, even in host species quite distantly related to the normal host...|$|E
40|$|Concentration of {{engineered}} {{nickel oxide}} nanoparticle (NiO-NP) in nature {{is on the}} rise, owing to large scale industrial uses, which have accreted the scope of its exposure to plants, the primary producers of the ecosystem. Though an essential micronutrient for the animal system, supported by numerous studies confirming its toxicity at higher dosages, nickel oxide is graded as a human carcinogen by WHO. A few studies do depict toxicity and bioaccumulation of nickel in plants; however, interaction of NiO-NP with plants is not well-elucidated. It is known that exposure to NiO-NP can incite stress response, leading to cytotoxicity and growth retardation in some plants, but a defined work on the intricate physicochemical cellular responses and genotoxic challenges is wanting. The present study was planned to explore cytotoxicity of NiO-NP in the model plant, Allium cepa L., its internalization in the tissue and concomitant furore created in the antioxidant enzyme system of the plant. The prospect of the NiO-NP causing genotoxicity was also investigated. Detailed assessments biochemical profiles and genotoxicity potential of NiO-NP on A. cepa L. was performed and extended to four of its closest economically important relatives, Allium sativum L., <b>Allium</b> <b>schoenoprasum</b> L., Allium porrum L., and Allium fistulosum L. Growing root tips were treated with seven different concentrations of NiO-NP suspension (10 – 500 mg L− 1), with deionised distilled water as negative control and 0. 4 mM EMS solution as positive control. Study of genotoxic endpoints, like, mitotic indices (MI), chromosomal aberrations (CAs), and chromosome breaks confirmed NiO-NP induced genotoxicity in plants, even at a very low dose (10 mg L− 1). That NiO-NP also perturbs biochemical homeostasis, disrupting normal physiology of the cell, was confirmed through changes in state of lipid peroxidation malonaldehyde (MDA), as well as, in oxidation marker enzymes, like catalase (CAT), super oxide dismutase (SOD), and guiacol peroxidase (POD) activities. It was evident that increase in NiO-NP concentration led to decrease in MIs in all the study materials, concomitant with a spike of stress-alleviating, antioxidant enzymes-CAT, POD, SOD, and significant increase in MDA formation. Hence, it can be confirmed that NiO-NP {{should be treated as}} an environmental hazard...|$|E
40|$|A {{study in}} 1997, on mineral levels in acidic {{compared}} to alkaline well waters, and in women’s hair, revealed higher concentrations {{of a number}} of mineral elements like Ca, Mo and Se in alkaline waters and hair. Thus, median Ca levels were six times higher in well water and five times higher in hair from the alkaline area compared to the acidic area. This finding raised the probability of similar differences in vegetables from these areas. Thus, in the year 2006, 60 women who had participated in the study in 1997 were asked to cultivate parsley, lettuce, carrot and chive. During the spring of 2006, the women from the water and hair study of 1997, 30 of them from the acidic area and 30 women from the alkaline district cultivated vegetables: carrot (Daucus carota L), parsley (Petroselinum crispum), chive (<b>Allium</b> <b>schoenoprasum)</b> and lettuce (Eruca sativa). The vegetables were harvested, and rinsed in tap water from the kitchens of the participating women in August. The concentrations of about 35 elements and ions were determined by ICP OES and ICP-MS predominantly. In addition, soil samples from the different cultivators were also analyzed for a number of elements. Lettuce and parsley showed the highest concentrations of mineral elements per gram dry weight. Only Mo concentrations were significantly higher in all the different vegetables from the alkaline district compared to vegetables from the acidic areas. On the other hand, the concentrations of Ba, Br, Mn, Rb and Zn were higher in all the different vegetables from the acidic area. In the soil, only pH and exchangeable Ca from the alkaline area were higher than from the acidic area, while exchangeable Fe, Mn and Na concentrations were higher in soils from the acidic area. Soil elements like Al, Fe, Li, Ni, Pb, Si, Ti, V, Zn and Zr were found in higher concentrations in lettuce and parsley, which were attributed to soil particles being splashed on the plants by the rain and absorbed by the leaves. Strong correlations appeared between Ca and Sr in all the vegetables, except for carrot. No strong correlations were found between soil elements and vegetable elements, except for soil Mn and carrot/lettuce Mn. The differences in mineral levels in both, vegetables and soils were however small, compared to differences in well waters and hair. It was also suggested that the garden soils on limestone bedrock had been drained of minerals and thereby, the soil had an acidic pH. The contribution of mineral elements to daily intake in humans was considered minor from the analysed vegetables, except for some samples of lettuce that should give significant contributions of Ca, Zn, Mn and Mo. The main conclusion is that, differences in water and hair mineral levels between the two areas in the earlier study (1997) were not mirrored in vegetables cultivated in 2006. Principally, this suggests that, for humans the mineral intake of some elements from water may be more important than from vegetables...|$|E
