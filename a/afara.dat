25|$|With Tribuna da Imprensa credentials, Baciu {{traveled}} across Latin America. In Mexico, {{he interviewed}} Natalia Sedova, widow of Leon Trotsky. In 1956, {{he was at}} Lima, where he met the Romanian writer-violinist Grigore Cugler. The two began a correspondence, with Baciu persuading Cugler to republish his 1930s avant-garde stories. He prepared for publishing Cugler's <b>Afară</b> de unul singur, but the manuscript {{was lost in the}} process (although an earlier print was eventually recovered in 1998). Baciu also embarked on a mission to popularize Romanian avant-garde writers, publishing Spanish and Portuguese essays about Urmuz and Constant Tonegaru.|$|E
25|$|On 15 May 1786, Mavrogenes reached Văcăreşti, near Bucharest, and on 17 May he was ceremoniously crowned {{and settled}} at the princely {{residence}} of Curtea Nouă. One {{of his first}} decrees was issued four days later, when he announced that {{all the people of}} Wallachia could address their grievances directly to him. He even set up a gazebo in Târgul de <b>afară</b> (Obor), so that peasants could speak to him. He also attempted to erect stakes on all major crossroads, to show the people what would happen to them if they engaged in theft or murder, or if they failed to attend church services. During the same year, he ordered the building of an aqueduct, which, although completed, was destroyed during the conflicts that followed his rule, and never fully rebuilt.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{of these}} new {{compounds}} appear in literary texts during the late empire; French dehors, Spanish de fuera and Portuguese de fora ("outside") all represent de + foris (Romanian <b>afară</b> – ad + foris), and we find Jerome writing stulti, nonne qui fecit, quod de foris est, etiam id, quod de intus est fecit? (Luke 11.40: [...] "ye fools, did not he, that made which is without, make that which is within also?"). In some cases, compounds were created by combining {{a large number of}} particles, such as the Romanian adineauri ("just recently") from ad + de + in + illa + hora.|$|E
40|$|Current {{diagnostic}} {{methods for}} assessing the severity of articular cartilage degenerative conditions, such as osteoarthritis, are inadequate. There is also a lack of techniques {{that can be used}} for real-time evaluation of the tissue during surgery to inform treatment decision and eliminate subjectivity. This book, derived from Dr <b>Afara’s</b> doctoral research, presents a scientific framework that is based on near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy for facilitating the non-destructive evaluation of articular cartilage health relative to its structural, functional, and mechanical properties. This development is a component of the ongoing research on advanced endoscopic diagnostic techniques in the Articular Cartilage Biomechanics Research Laboratory of Professor Adekunle Oloyede at Queensland University of Technology (QUT), Brisbane Australia...|$|R
50|$|The project {{included}} many technology contributions among Linux, Solaris and SPARC. The <b>Afara</b> CPU used a SPARC port of Debian GNU/Linux initially. Debian GNU/Linux contributions to <b>Afara</b> Websystem's former CPU architecture continued to grow, including commercial support for Ubuntu, a Debian GNU/Linux-based operating system. <b>Afara</b> Websystems' former platform direction seemed further validated when Sun hired Ian Murdock, {{founder of the}} Debian distribution, to head operating system platform strategy, and cross-pollinate Solaris with a new OS packaging technology {{similar to that of}} Debian GNU/Linux.|$|E

50|$|The {{search for}} venture capital continued, since {{creating}} a server company requires substantial resources, {{but there was}} little available during the recession following 9/11. <b>Afara</b> began negotiations with Sun Microsystems, and the acquisition was consummated in July 2002. This new acquisition fell under the umbrella of Fred DeSantis, the vice president of engineering for horizontal systems at Sun. During the due-diligence process, Brian Sutphin sensed from executives he was interacting with that <b>Afara</b> did not have any alternate sources of funding and reduced the offer from triple digit millions of dollars to < $50M.|$|E
5000|$|The new CPU {{architecture}} of <b>Afara</b> Websystems, which {{became known as}} [...] "Niagara", had enough merit to cause a competing internal Sun project under DeSantis' organization, called [...] "Honeybee", to be canceled.|$|E

50|$|It was a Prince's {{road that}} had its {{beginning}} at St. Anton square/market, close to Curtea Veche. The street was much shorter in the past, {{the city limits}} being just somewhere at Saints' Church (Biserica Sfinţilor) towards the northeast, at junction with Strada Sfinţilor. This was the first known location of the Outside Market. Later, the city expanded and city limits were moved towards Oborul Vechi Church and Fire Watchtower (Foisorul de Foc). Because {{it was meant to}} be an out of city market, these new limits became the next location of Târgul de <b>Afară.</b> The city limits were eventually moved farther, and the road extended with it. Now Târgul de <b>Afară</b> found its destination in the place which is now known as Obor Market Piaţa Obor. Târgul de <b>Afară</b> became Târgul Moșilor, famous Fair throughout Wallachia held twice a week and it was direct precursor of Obor Market. From here on heading towards North-East, the road was making connection to cities from Moldova, but also cities like Brăila, Galaţi or Lvov.|$|E

50|$|In the mid-1990s, Olukotun and his co-authors {{argued that}} {{multi-core}} computer processors {{were likely to}} make better use of hardware than existing superscalar designs.In 2000, while a professor at Stanford, Olukotun founded <b>Afara</b> Websystems, a company that designed and manufactured multi-core SPARC-based computer processors for data centers. <b>Afara</b> was purchased by Sun Microsystems in 2002; at Sun, Olukotun {{was one of the}} architects of the 2005 UltraSPARC T1 processor.In 2008, Olukotun returned to Stanford, and founded the Pervasive Parallelism Laboratory at Stanford after gathering US$6M in funding from several computer-industry corporations. His recent work focuses on domain-specific programming languages that can allow algorithms to be easily adapted to multiple different types of parallel hardware including multi-core systems, graphics processing units, and field-programmable gate arrays.|$|E
5000|$|The old name of Calea Moșilor is Podul Târgului din <b>Afară</b> which {{translated}} means The Bridge of Outside Fair (also {{market or}} even field), {{referring to a}} big fair held outside the city. Why [...] "the Bridge" [...] (Romanian: pod)? Probably because all main roads in medieval Bucharest were [...] "paved" [...] with wood and had a resemblance to a bridge. In any case, pod was a common name for a major road in Romania into the 19th Century. For example, Calea Victoriei was once known as Podul Mogoșoaiei. Most of main roads were Prince's Roads (alternatively [...] "Princely Roads", Podurile Domnesti) and they usually began from the nearby Curtea Veche (Old Princely Court). Podul Târgului din <b>Afară</b> was in fact {{one of the major}} streets of medieval Bucharest.|$|E
5000|$|Orodo is an Igbo {{community}} in Mbaitoli local government area of Imo State, Nigeria. It is situated between Owerri city and Orlu town. Orodo has borders with Ogwa, Mbieri, <b>Afara,</b> Ifakala, Umuaka, Amurie Omanze and Amandugba. Also, the current Mbaitoli Local Government Headquarters is significantly located at {{a part of}} Orodo called Ofekata.|$|E
50|$|The legend had it {{that they}} settled at that spot because of the {{presence}} of a natural pond that stretched forth the land that is occupied by the people of Umuezala Ugbele that run down along the present boundary areas between settlement of Ibele and Amiyi towards <b>Afara</b> community in Mbaitoli local government area.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Afara</b> Websystems Inc. was a Sunnyvale, California, USA server {{company whose}} {{goal was to}} build servers {{surrounding}} a custom high-throughput CPU architecture, [...] "developing IP traffic management systems that will bring quality-of-service {{to the next generation}} of IP access infrastructure." [...] The word [...] "Afara" [...] means [...] "bridge" [...] in the West African Yoruba language.|$|E
5000|$|Olukotun {{has used}} several words from his African {{heritage}} in his research. <b>Afara,</b> {{the name of}} the company he founded, means [...] "bridge" [...] in the Yoruba language, and he has named his server at Stanford Ogun after the Yoruba god of iron and steel, a play on words since large computers are frequently called big iron.|$|E
50|$|Rick Hetherington left Sun {{to create}} a {{start-up}} company. Venture capitalists Sequoia Capital introduced Hetherington to Olukotun. When Hetherington's startup failed, he returned to Sun. Hetherington wrote memos to Mike Splain, CTO of the Processor group at Sun, encouraging technology acquisition of <b>Afara</b> Websystems. Hetherington became Chief Architect for Horizontal Systems at Sun, which develops and sells servers for data centers and Web systems.|$|E
50|$|The end of Podul Târgului de <b>Afară</b> near Piaţa Obor {{was also}} the place where convicted people were {{executed}} by hanging. This is The place where famous bandit Iancu Jianu {{was supposed to be}} executed for his outlaw activity but one of noble ladies of the Court, Sultana Gălăşescu, saved him from death penalty by taking him as a husband. They had two children afterwards.|$|E
50|$|Umunoha is {{a village}} in southeastern Nigeria, located {{near the city of}} Owerri. The town usually, that is not always, is claimed to have been founded by a common ancestor, as we saw, usually larger-than-life, who begat several {{children}} to whom he allocated areas on which to settle. These areas eventually evolved to become villages.A typical example of such a claim is the tradition of origin of Umunoha autonomous community in Mbaitoli Local Government Area (LGA) of Imo State, Nigeria. Today, Umunoha is one of the autonomous communities in the LGA. It is a typical Igbo town. It is bounded on the north by Eziama Obiato and <b>Afara</b> communities; on the south and southwest by Ogbaku and Ejemekwuru communities; and on the south and southeast by Ifakala and <b>Afara</b> communities. It is served by the great East-West Road-the Port-Harcourt-Lagos Highway. It is about thirteen kilometers from Owerri, the Imo State capital. It is a small, compact but thickly populated community with a projected 1997 population of twenty-five thousand people.|$|E
50|$|The {{company was}} founded by Kunle Olukotun, a Stanford University professor. First {{employee}} to be hired was by Raza Foundries Board Member - Atul Kapadia. It was Neil Sadaranganey who was the sole business person at <b>Afara</b> Web Systems. He was hired out of Real Networks. Subsequently, Les Kohn (employee #2) a microprocessor designer for: Sun Microsystems UltraSPARC; Intel i860 and i960; National Semiconductor Swordfish took the basic idea and developed a product plan.|$|E
5000|$|The highest {{mortality}} was in October 1813; the gravediggers couldn't even bury all the dead, {{and many}} of them were put in large pits, which were not covered and many [...] "were eaten by dogs and other beasts". In February 1814, the last market still open, Târgul de <b>Afară</b> (Obor), was closed down, but soon the people returned to the city. In 1818 the quarantine hospitals of Plumbuita and Văcăreşti were closed down.|$|E
50|$|He {{made his}} stage debut at the Bulandra Theatre, Romania, in the 1975 {{production}} of Ferma, playing George. From 1978 to 1981 he acted at the National Theatre, Cluj, in numerous roles such as Beckman {{in the play}} <b>Afară</b> în faţa uşii and Conifeul in Persii. During the early 1980s, Iureş appeared at both the Bulandra and Odeon Theatres in Bucharest. Among his roles were the title roles in Shakespeare's were Hamlet, Henry IV and Richard III.|$|E
50|$|Kanu {{was born}} in Isiama <b>Afara,</b> Abia State, Nigeria. His father is HRM Eze Israel Okwu Kanu (JP) and his mother is Ugoeze Nnenne Kanu.

5000|$|Oracle Corporation {{announced}} {{its intention to}} acquire Sun in April 2009, a deal which closed in January 2010. By the end of 2010, market competitors started to release similar products with multiple cores, a less radical approach to threading, but with similar performance characteristics. Oracle continued the radical approach of the original <b>Afara</b> SPARC architecture (large numbers of threads per large number of simple cores) {{with the release of}} the SPARC T3 processor in September 2010 - the first 16 core commodity central processing unit, yielding another top performance benchmark, but only by a slim margin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Afara</b> Websystems pioneered {{a radical}} thread-heavy SPARC design. The company was {{purchased}} by Sun, and the intellectual property became {{the foundation of the}} CoolThreads line of processors, starting with the T1. The T1 is a new-from-the-ground-up SPARC microprocessor implementation that conforms to the UltraSPARC Architecture 2005 specification and executes the full SPARC V9 instruction set. Sun has produced two previous multicore processors (UltraSPARC IV and IV+), but UltraSPARC T1 is its first microprocessor that is both multicore and multithreaded. The processor is available with four, six or eight CPU cores, each core able to handle four threads concurrently. Thus the processor is capable of processing up to 32 threads concurrently.|$|E
