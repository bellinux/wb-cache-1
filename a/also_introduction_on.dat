40|$|Principal {{component}} analysis (PCA) {{is a popular}} tool for linear dimensionality reduc-tion and feature extraction. Kernel PCA is the nonlinear form of PCA, which better exploits the complicated spatial structure of high-dimensional features. In this paper, we first review the basic ideas of PCA and kernel PCA.

We <b>also</b> give an <b>introduction</b> <b>on</b> how PCA is used in ac-tive shape models (ASMs), and discuss how kernel PCA can be applied to improve tra-ditional ASMs. Then we show some exper-imental results to compare the performance of kernel PCA and standard PCA for clas-sification problems. We also implement the kernel PCA-based ASMs, and use it to con-struct human face models. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This is {{the report}} of {{neutrino}} and astroparticle physics working group at WHEPP- 8. We present the discussions carried out during the workshop on selected topics in the above fields and also indicate progress made subsequently. The neutrino physics subgroup studied the possibilites of constraining neutrino masses, mixing and CPT violation in lepton sector from future experiments. Neutrino mass models {{in the context of}} abelian horizontal symmetries, warped extra dimensions and in presence of triplet Higgs were studied. Effect of threshold corrections on radiative magnification of mixing angles was investigated. The astroparticle physics subgroup focused on how various particle physics inputs affect the CMBR fluctuation spectrum, and on brane cosmology.

40|$|In the {{biopharmaceutical}} industry, {{identification of}} glycans in a glycoprotein is a regulatory requirement {{and is a}} part of the characterization of the protein. Glycans are constructed of several monosaccharides linked together. N-linked glycans, which have been studied in this project, are attached to the nitrogen atom in asparagine. A method for separating N-linked glycans by high performance anion exchange chromatography had already been developed at the department. To develop a method for identification of the N-glycans by mass spectrometry, a desalting method on porous graphitic carbon (PGC) columns was used and optimized resulting in the eluents A (0, 05 % TFA in ACN:water 5 : 95 v/v) and B (0, 05 % TFA in ACN:water 50 : 50 v/v). <b>Also</b> the sample <b>introduction</b> <b>on</b> the mass spectrometer was optimized and resulted in a sensitive on-line liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) approach which gave mass spectrometric peaks with high signal to noise ratios and with high mass accuracy.

40|$|The castle of Montreuil-Bellay was rebuilt by Guillaume d’Harcourt († 1487) and {{his wife}} Yolande de Laval († 1487). It {{contains}} {{in one of the}} chapels a rare testimony of murals dating from {{the last quarter of the}} fifteenth century in the Loire Valley, in France. Based on a widespread iconography, images however respond to specific expectations of the owners. Several complementary readings can be made in the representation of the six saints painted in the chapel. Individual devotions combine collective concerns of several members of the Harcourt and Laval families. <b>Also,</b> this short <b>introduction</b> <b>on</b> the murals <b>also</b> leads us to take a new look at the painter in charge of it. The artist, who was familiar with Flemish painting innovations during the fifteenth century. He probably can be identified with Coppin Delf. From an artistic standpoint, the murals of Montreuil-Bellay put on display an entanglement of different influences and iconographic sources. Indeed, they emphasize the extent and complexity in artistic transfers away from political divisions or distant geographical areas...|$|R

The last, by Mike Heyworth, on blogs and feeds {{might be the}} shortest but informs us about an emerging and potentially crucial technology that is allowing us to keep up right to date with all manner of archaeological (and other) information. I found out the penetrating potential of this technology by accident when I loaded the article onto the journal server but did not immediately {{add it to the}} issue contents page or announce it via the usual round of archaeology discussion lists. I had however updated our own newsfeed to reflect the new content.

The thread of sharing knowledge runs throughout the articles in issue 14. Of course the raison d'être of any self-respecting journal is to share knowledge, and that of an e-journal is its ability to bring that knowledge to an even wider audience, and in ways that are more empowering to the reader. But this issue's authors wished not just to engage with that larger audience but had something to say to a whole new community of readers. ...|$|R

This fruit crop has good {{productive}} potential but {{it is necessary to}} grow adequate cultivars in concordance with the ecological conditions and market demands. Lateral bearing walnut cultivars are grown in many countries due to their productivity and precocity.

These cultivars showed higher susceptibility to bacterial blight then ’Franquette’ and Romanian cultivars in the sub-Carpathian area of Oltenia ecological conditions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} some of Martin Bell’s {{major research}} contributions and introduces the seven essays written {{in honour of}} Martin who recently retired. The <b>Introduction</b> focuses <b>on</b> one of Martin’s core areas of interest: learning {{and the development of}} technological capabilities in developing countries, illustrating Martin’s profound and enduring influence on this field of study. The Introduction attempts to summarise the core of Martin’s research on what we term ‘dynamic learning’ (to be contrasted with static, learning by doing) and shows the way Bell’s thinking on this subject has {{had a significant impact on}} other related fields of study, including knowledge management, the knowledge-based economy, the resourced-based view of the firm, networks and industrial clusters, global value chain analysis, and research on foreign direct investment spillovers. The Introduction refers to Martin’s own published work and that of some of his many PhD students and colleagues who have followed in his footsteps. The <b>Introduction</b> <b>also</b> touches <b>on</b> Bell’s contribution to policy thinking and policy making at the national and international levels. Finally, it uses the above to develop questions for future research on technological progress in developing economies, focusing especially on Asia. While this brief Introduction cannot capture the breadth or depth of Martin’s intellectual and policy contributions, we hope to reveal Bell’s towering influence on this field of study and the increasing impact of his research on other important academic fields concerned with technological and economic development, catching up and industrial innovation...|$|R
