5|$|Because {{of their}} status as the largest {{warships}} in the U.S. Navy, the deployment of an aircraft carrier can fulfill a symbolic role, not {{just in terms of}} a deterrent to an enemy, but often as a diplomatic tool, in strengthening relations with allies and potential allies. The latter of these functions can take place either as a single visit to <b>a</b> <b>country,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> senior naval officers are allowed to observe the operating of the carrier and to interact with its senior officers, or as part of an international task force. This can be in combat operations, such as NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999, or other deployments involving training, such as Exercise RIMPAC. In addition, carriers have participated in international Maritime security operations, combating piracy in the Persian Gulf and off the coast of Somalia.|$|E

25|$|The {{bank was}} the first modern bank in Iran and {{introduced}} European banking ideas to <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> they were previously unknown. The legal centre of the bank was in London and whilst it was subject to British law, its activities were based in Tehran. It also had operations in other Middle Eastern countries. It was later named British Bank of the Middle East (BBME) and is now called HSBC Bank Middle East Limited. After the Iranian Revolution of 1979, all the Iranian activities of this bank were transferred to Bank Tejarat.|$|E
25|$|Half dollars issued {{through the}} end of the 1960s were hoarded as the only {{precious}} metal U.S. coins remaining in production, and as the price of silver continued to rise, pre-1964 halves disappeared from circulation as well.

25|$|Wayang klitik figures {{occupy a}} middle ground between the figures of wayang golek and wayang kulit. They are {{constructed}} similarly to wayang kulit figures, but from thin pieces of wood instead of leather, and, like wayang kulit figures, are used as shadow puppets. A further similarity {{is that they are}} the same smaller size as wayang kulit figures. However, wood is more subject to breakage than leather. During battle scenes, wayang klitik figures often sustain considerable damage, much to the amusement of the public, but in <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> before 1970 there were no adequate glues available, breakage generally meant an expensive, newly made figure. On this basis the wayang klitik figures, which are to appear in plays where they have to endure battle scenes, have leather arms. The name of these figures is onomotopaeic, from the sound klitik-klitik, that these figures make when worked by the dalang.|$|E

He was informed by the Rhodes trustees that if he passed the Oxford entrance examination his application would be favourably considered, and in 1906 he went to England to be privately coached. After his fourth attempt, he succeeded in passing the required examination. In October 1908 Fairbridge entered Exeter College, Oxford, with a Rhodes Scholarship. In 1909 he published an anthology of poetry entitled Veld Verse and Other Lines. He began to write on child emigration until he was advised by a friend that speaking would be more effective. Fairbridge was rebuffed by the British South Africa Company, which informed him that they considered Rhodesia too young <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> to start child emigration. The Premier of Newfoundland, however, provided support for the concept.|$|E

His complaint included statistics detailing slow sales in some markets, including the fact that between September 2001 and June 2007, Trek only sold $10,393 worth of LeMond bikes in France, <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> LeMond was both famous and popular.|$|E
500|$|Although Europeans knew Priestley best as a {{scientist}} (he had discovered oxygen gas in 1774), Americans knew him best as a defender of religious freedom and as an advocate for American independence. Immediately upon his arrival, he was [...] by various political factions vying to gain his support. Priestley declined their entreaties, however, hoping to avoid the political discord that had embroiled him in Britain. He wrote to John Adams that he [...] "made it a rule to take no part whatever {{in the politics of}} <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> I am a stranger, and in which I only wish to live undisturbed".

However, upon the game's 2008 release, Thompson called Grand Theft Auto IV [...] "the gravest assault upon children in this country since polio," [...] and asked Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty to [...] "pursue and file criminal charges against [...] Target and Best Buy". He also {{sent a letter to}} Take-Two chairman Strauss Zelnick's attorney, addressed to Zelnick's mother, in which Thompson accused her son of [...] "doing everything he possibly can to sell as many copies of GTA: IV to teen boys in the United States, <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> your son claims you raised him to be a 'a Boy Scout'. ... More like the Hitler Youth, I would say." [...] On May 1, 2008 Thompson appeared on the CNN Headline News program Glenn Beck, asserting that the game's sexual content made its sale to minors illegal, and that he was working with law enforcement to have criminal prosecutions brought. Thompson also {{filed a complaint with the}} Chicago Transit Authority about poster ads for the game at Chicago, Illinois bus stops.|$|E
500|$|Ghost in the Shell {{gained an}} {{aggregate}} rating of 78.50% at GameRankings, {{which would be}} a mostly positive metascore. AllGame praised the graphics, sound and gameplay; the review stated, [...] "Even with plenty of eye candy and strong audio, a game is nothing without actually being fun to play and as you've probably guessed, Ghost in the Shell supplies the fun, whether you're familiar with the license or not." [...] GameSpot rated the game as good, eulogizing the controls as [...] "simple... most people will take to them like a fish to water" [...] and praising the animation sequences. GameFan reviewers cited the game's unique wall-scaling mechanics and noted how it lives up to the name of the Ghost in the Shell series. IGN said that the game was great, faithful to its manga counterpart, stating that [...] "the techno music, including tracks from artists like Derrick May and Hardfloor, is superb," [...] but adding that [...] "the levels aren't incredibly difficult, and don't really encourage replay." [...] Super GamePower reviewed the game short after the movie was released in Brazil, stating that the opening animation was better than the drawing of the film. In Russia, Velikij Drakon lauded the orientation system, the game graphics and the overall design, highlighting the unlockable animation scenes. NowGamer praised the gameplay mechanics but criticized the option to unlock, stating, [...] "The tremendous feeling of agility you get from Ghost In The Shell and the slick weapons is where the fun comes from. But it's a tough game and playing for more scenes of new footage will not be compelling enough for <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> anime is a cult industry and not a national fixation." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the conference}} in Vienna later in the year, Metternich found himself {{constrained}} by the Kings of Württemberg and Bavaria to abandon his plans to reform the German federation. He now regretted having so quickly forced through its original constitution five years before. Nevertheless, he held ground on other issues and the Conference's Final Act was highly reactionary, much as Metternich had envisaged it. He remained in Vienna until the close in May 1820, finding the whole affair a bore. On 6 May he heard {{of the death of}} his daughter Klementine from tuberculosis. Journeying on to Prague, he heard that his eldest daughter Maria had also contracted the disease. He was at her bedside in Baden bei Wien when she died on 20 July. This prompted Eleonore and the remaining children to leave for the cleaner air of France. The rest of 1820 was filled with liberal revolts to which Metternich was expected to respond. Ultimately, the Austrian Foreign Minister was torn between following through on his conservative pledge (a policy favoured by the Russians) and keeping out of <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Austria had no interest (favoured by the British). He chose [...] "sympathetic inactivity" [...] on Spain but, much to his dismay and surprise, Guglielmo Pepe led a revolt in Naples in early July and forced King Ferdinand I to accept a new constitution. Metternich reluctantly agreed to attend the Russian-initiated Congress of Troppau in October to discuss these events. He need not have worried: the Tsar gave way and accepted a compromise proposal of moderate interventionism. Still worried by Kapodistrias' influence over the Tsar, he laid down his conservative principles in a long memorandum, including an attack on the free press and the initiative of the middle classes.|$|E
