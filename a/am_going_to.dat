5|$|I {{spend my}} time out in the open, on the shingle beach {{when the weather is}} bad or the fishing boats go out, or I go into the {{countryside}} which is very beautiful here, that I find perhaps still more charming in winter than in summer and, naturally I work all the time, and I believe that this year I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do some serious things.|$|E
5|$|The story I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> tell is {{a horrible}} one: I beg that daughters and fathers should hold {{themselves}} aloof, while I sing, or if they find my songs enchanting, let them refuse to believe this part of my tale, and suppose that it never happened: or else, if they believe that it did happen, they must believe also in the punishment that followed.|$|E
5|$|Picture {{me in this}} market-place – I spend {{nearly every}} day there for it fascinates me {{completely}} – have done 16 drawings and two oil things so far – Am feeling thoroughly at home now so <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take out my big oil box – wanted {{to get used to}} people and things first – Oh how I do love it all!...

5000|$|..... Upon the {{suggestion}} of Gendarmerie Forces Commander Gen. Şener Eruygur, {{we went to the}} social facilities of the gendarmerie. (...) We decided to form an action plan on our own. We <b>were</b> first <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take control of the media, so I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> invite M.Ö. for that purpose. We <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> keep in contact with rectors and arrange for students to engage in demonstrations. We <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> act in unison with unions. We <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get posters hung in the streets. We <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> contact associations and incite them against the government. We <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do all of this across the country, and it would be known as Sarıkız.|$|R
5|$|It's not literal {{about the}} drug for me, I've never taken lithium before. It's sort of a metaphor about {{numbness}} and happiness... it's me looking at happiness {{in a negative way}} because I've always been... kind of afraid to be happy. Like with the band and the art and everything else, it's always like I'm never letting myself break through into the happiness it seems like, because it's not cool or something. And describing happiness is lithium, it's like saying 'that's numbness, I won't be able to be an artist anymore if I'm happy', which is hilarious because that's just not true, I'm happy. So it's... this fight within the song of... 'do I do this and get out of here and get happy or do I wallow in it like I always do?' and it's cool because {{at the end of the}} song I say 'I'm going to let it go', like I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be happy.|$|E
25|$|I wish no harm to {{any human}} being, but I, as one man, <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{exercise}} my freedom of speech. No human {{being on the}} face of the earth, no government is going to take from me my right to speak, my right to protest against wrong, my right to do everything that is for the benefit of mankind. I am not here, then, as the accused; I am here as the accuser of capitalism dripping with blood from head to foot.|$|E
25|$|Before I forget it, let {{me remind}} you that I shall want the trunk and the things you took away from my house as soon as possible. I learn that instead of taking old things, you took my best. Mrs. Rogers is at the White Mountains. I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Fairhaven this afternoon. I hope you will not be there. By the way, I have been using a pair of your gloves in the Mountains, and they don't seem to be much of an attraction.|$|E

5000|$|Describing her experience, Ramírez said, [...] "I couldn’t {{stand the}} pain anymore. If my baby <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> die, then I decided I {{would have to}} die, too. But if he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> grow up, I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> see him grow up, and I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> with my child. I thought that God would save both our lives." ...|$|R
25|$|In {{his final}} letter, to Blumentritt – Tomorrow at 7, I shall be shot; but I am {{innocent}} {{of the crime}} of rebellion. I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> die with a tranquil conscience. Rizal {{is believed to be the}} first Filipino revolutionary whose death is attributed entirely to his work as a writer; and through dissent and civil disobedience enabled him to successfully destroy Spain's moral primacy to rule. He also bequeathed a book personally bound by him in Dapitan to his 'best and dearest friend.' When Blumentritt received it in his hometown Litoměřice (Leitmeritz) he broke down and wept.|$|E
25|$|Lake {{expressed}} interest in renegotiating her deal with Paramount:The studio feels that way about it too. They have indicated {{they are going to}} fuss more about the pictures in which I appear. I think I'll enjoy being fussed about... I want this to be the turning point and I think that it will. I am free and clear of unpleasant characters, unless they are strongly justified. I've had a varied experience playing them and also appearing as heroines. The roles themselves haven't been noteworthy and sometimes not even especially spotlighted, but I think they've all been beneficial in one way or another. From here on there should be a certain pattern of development, and that is what I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> fight for if necessary, though I don't believe it will be because they are so understanding here at Paramount.|$|E

500|$|After {{the release}} of her seventh studio album Ray of Light (1998), Madonna stated in a live {{interview}} with Larry King on January 19, 1999 that [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do a movie in April; The Next Best Thing, and then I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> rehearse to go on tour. And then I'll probably play up until the millennium, New Year's Eve." [...] The tour was delayed until 2001, as she had, in her own words, [...] "been distracted by having children and filming movies". She also began a serious relationship with Guy Ritchie in 1999. By 2000, she had become pregnant with her son Rocco Ritchie, released her eighth studio album Music that year, and married Ritchie in December 2000.|$|E
500|$|Facing an {{ultimately}} detached nature, {{the characters}} find solace in human solidarity. They are {{often referred to}} collectively as [...] "the men", rather than singularly by their professions, creating a silent understanding between them of their togetherness. The first few sentences of section three attest to this connection: [...] "It {{would be difficult to}} describe the subtle brotherhood of men that was here established on the seas. No one said that it was so. No one mentioned it. But it dwelt in the boat, and each man felt it warm him. They were a captain, an oiler, a cook, and a correspondent, and they were friends, friends in a more curiously iron-bound degree than may be common." [...] Survival is also an important thematic element in itself, as it is contingent upon the men to battle the elements in order to save themselves. The correspondent's desire to survive is evident in his refrain of the lyrical line: [...] "If I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be drowned—if I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be drowned—if I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be drowned, why, {{in the name of the}} seven mad gods who rule the sea, was I allowed to come thus far and contemplate sand and trees?" [...] By repeating himself, the correspondent expresses himself ritualistically, and yet he remains existentially adrift.|$|E
500|$|Bullen and {{his family}} {{returned}} to the UK in 2011; Bullen told The Manly Daily [...] "I realised if I still <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have a UK-based television career I need to be based in the UK." [...] As of 2012, Bullen has three television series in development with British television networks.|$|E

5000|$|But Double Take adds a {{contemporary}} twist: [...] "You {{think all the}} way through that cinema <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> killed by television or television <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> kill cinema or America <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> kill Russia or Russia <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> kill America.

500|$|Despite his radical views, Haywood {{emerged from}} the trial with a {{national}} reputation. Eugene Debs called him [...] "the Lincoln of Labor." [...] Along with his colorful background and appearance, he {{was known for his}} blunt statements about capitalism. [...] "The capitalist has no heart," [...] he often said, [...] "but harpoon him in the pocketbook and you will draw blood." [...] Another time, he began a speech by noting, [...] "Tonight I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> speak on the class struggle and I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make it so plain that even a lawyer can understand it." [...] Yet Haywood also had a flair for dangerous hyperbole that, when quoted in newspapers, was used to justify wholesale arrests of IWW strikers. [...] "Confiscate! That's good!" [...] he often said. [...] "I like that word. [...] It suggests stripping the capitalist, taking something away from him. [...] But there {{has got to be a}} good deal of force to this thing of taking." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1935 Kanae {{settled in}} Tokyo and {{returned}} to painting full-time. [...] He produced a number of oils and watercolours that were exhibited in January 1940 at the Mitsukoshi gallery.

5000|$|On 8 July 2016 series creator Charlie Higson {{explained}} in a sequence of tweets {{what would have happened}} in season 2 had ITV not cancelled the production: [...] "We had lots of great stories already written for series 2 of Jekyll & Hyde.

5000|$|According to the show's creator, Eric Kripke, {{the third}} season <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{different}} from the first two seasons: [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> great. It was gonna be this kind of treasure story where they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> hear a legend of a very mythic treasure. It wasn't gonna be gold, it was gonna be supplies. It was gonna be this incredible stockpile of supplies. All the good guys and all the bad guys in the show <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> fight for this gold mine of material and supplies. It <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fun. It wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a war season. It <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a treasure hunt season, {{which would have been}} fun and mixed up the show in a really interesting way".|$|R

The general, at that time, had some doubts about whether his road led to the same country, and made no reply; but it is hoped he found the way to everlasting life before he left the world.' ...|$|E
500|$|In 2005, he also feuded with {{democracy}} activist Martha Beatriz Roque, accusing her of collaborating with security forces to provide justification {{for a further}} crackdown. Although his political activity was tolerated and on a few occasions {{he was allowed to}} travel abroad, Payá reported that both he and his family were subject to routine intimidation: [...] "I have been told that I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be killed before the regime is over but I am not going to run away." ...|$|E
