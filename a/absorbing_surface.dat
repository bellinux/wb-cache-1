25|$|Kirchhoff in 1860 {{introduced}} the theoretical {{concept of a}} perfect black body with a completely <b>absorbing</b> <b>surface</b> layer of infinitely small thickness, but Planck noted some severe restrictions upon this idea. Planck noted three requirements upon a black body: the body must (i) allow radiation to enter but not reflect; (ii) possess a minimum thickness adequate to absorb the incident radiation and prevent its re-emission; (iii) satisfy severe limitations upon scattering to prevent radiation from entering and bouncing back out. As a consequence, Kirchhoff's perfect black bodies that absorb all the radiation that falls on them cannot be realized in an infinitely thin surface layer, and impose conditions upon scattering of the light within the black body {{that are difficult to}} satisfy.|$|E

40|$|Using a local {{plane wave}} assumption, one can {{determine}} the normal incidence sound absorption coefficient of a surface by measuring the acoustic pressure and the particle velocity normal to that surface. As the measurement surface lies {{in front of the}} material surface, the measured active and incident acoustic power will generally deviate from those at the material surface, leading to a possibly inaccurate sound absorption coefficient. This phenomenon is particularly pronounced for poorly <b>absorbing</b> <b>surfaces</b> if sound is not normally incident over the whole material surface. Based on an analytical model, it is shown that the accuracy can be improved by extending the measurement surface upon which the active acoustic power is measured. Experimental results demonstrate the usefulness of this approach, in particular for poorly <b>absorbing</b> <b>surfaces...</b>|$|R
40|$|Reduction of the {{transportation}} noise nuisance has become an important challenge in today's societies. As a consequence of engine noise reduction, tyre / road contact noise is now {{the main source of}} traffic noise under normal driving conditions. In this respect, the aim of the present work is to understand and to control the mechanisms of tyre radiation by designing accurate tools to predict the tyre noise radiation over arbitrary impedance surfaces. Tyre radiation is modelled using the Equivalent Sources method. Besides low frequency limitations because of two [...] dimensional simplifications, this model is proved to be an accurate tool for predicting tyre noise over acoustically rigid surfaces. Ground effects induced by <b>absorbing</b> <b>surfaces</b> are only approximated. Therefore, a model for the propagation of sound due to an arbitrary order source over an arbitrary impedance plane is developed. It is mainly an alternative to integral equation methods. In addition, the exact solution to this problem is presented. Based on the two previous models, an iterative model of the tyre radiation over arbitrary impedance surfaces is implemented. Comparison with horn effect sound amplification indicate that this model is accurate for homogeneous as well as inhomogeneous <b>absorbing</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Using this model, trends for the tyre radiation over <b>absorbing</b> <b>surfaces</b> are discussed in a parametrical study. The work presented in this thesis gives further insights into the mechanisms of tyre / road noise radiation; furthermore, it allows to study the possibilities of reducing traffic noise by the use of so [...] called "low [...] noise" road surfaces...|$|R
2500|$|Electric {{radiant heating}} [...] uses heating {{elements}} that reach a high temperature. The element is usually packaged inside a glass envelope resembling {{a light bulb}} and with a reflector to direct the energy output {{away from the body}} of the heater. The element emits infrared radiation that travels through air or space until it hits an <b>absorbing</b> <b>surface,</b> where it is partially converted to heat and partially reflected. This heat directly warms people and objects in the room, rather than warming the air. This style of heater is particularly useful in areas through which unheated air flows. They are also ideal for basements and garages where spot heating is desired. More generally, they are an excellent choice for task-specific heating.|$|E
60|$|A wood, then, may be {{regarded}} {{either as a}} superficies or as a solid; that is, either {{as a part of}} the earth's surface slightly elevated above the rest, or as a diffused and heterogeneous body displacing a certain portion of free and mobile atmosphere. It is primarily in the first character that it attracts our attention, as a radiating and <b>absorbing</b> <b>surface,</b> exposed to the sun and the currents of the air; such that, if we imagine a plateau of meadow-land or bare earth raised to the mean level of the forest's exposed leaf-surface, we shall have an agent entirely similar in kind, although perhaps widely differing in the amount of action. Now, by comparing a tract of wood with such a plateau as we have just supposed, we shall arrive at a clear idea of the specialities of the former. In the first place, then, the mass of foliage may be expected to increase the radiating power of each tree. The upper leaves radiate freely towards the stars and the cold inter-stellar spaces, while the lower ones radiate to those above and receive less heat in return; consequently, during the absence of the sun, each tree cools gradually downward from top to bottom. Hence we must take into account not merely the area of leaf-surface actually exposed to the sky, but, to a greater or less extent, the surface of every leaf in the whole tree or the whole wood. This is evidently a point in which the action of the forest may be expected to differ from that of the meadow or naked earth; for though, of course, inferior strata tend to a certain extent to follow somewhat the same course as the mass of inferior leaves, they do so to a less degree--conduction, and the conduction of a very slow conductor, being substituted for radiation.|$|E

The development of the concept for the gauge was performed in a heat flux measurement facility at Lewis. In this facility, transient and steady state <b>absorbed</b> <b>surface</b> heat flux information was obtained from transient temperature measurements taken at points within the gauge. A schematic of the TBT is presented, and plots of the <b>absorbed</b> <b>surface</b> heat flux measured on the three blades tested in the TBT are presented. High quality heat flux values were measured on all three blades. The experiments demonstrated that reliable and durable gauges can be repeatedly fabricated into the airfoils.

40|$|One of the {{limitations}} of Fourier-based planar near-field acoustic holography (P-NAH) is that the wave-field extrapolation only holds for outgoing waves, making the study of certain vibro-acoustic sources in reverberant environments a costly and difficult procedure. The present paper is concerned with a single-layer formulation of Fourier-based P-NAH that accounts for the presence of partially <b>absorbing</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The underlying theory is based on the WRW model, which is a rather popular technique in the seismic processing community. Unlike P-NAH, the WRWmodel proposes a solution to the forward acoustic problem, by performing the spatial convolutions via matrix multiplications. The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate the use of the WRW model for inverse acoustics, particularly in the context of P-NAH. Numerical reconstructions with baffled point sources are carried out, investigating a geometrical case with one reflector under noise-free conditions. Several combinations of frequencies, reflection coefficients, measurement apertures and reflector positions are explored. Opportune observations are made regarding the influence of the propagation distances on the numerical implementation of the Green’s functions. The source reconstructions are performed via free-field P-NAH and via the present formulation, aiming towards a quantitative and qualitative understanding of the influence of the partially <b>absorbing</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Qc 20150828 </p...|$|R

In a second set, for a relatively "silent " road surface, the influence of using different tires was studied. The results of the psychoacoustic evaluations are compared to data from physical measurements. When using A-weighted level and the well-known rule of thumb “ 10 dB less means half loudness ” the noise reduction of sound <b>absorbing</b> road <b>surfaces</b> as perceived by the broad public can be considerably underestimated.

30|$|In the coal-based {{combustion}} and gasification processes, {{the mineral}} matter {{contained in the}} coal (predominantly oxides), is left as an incombustible residue, termed ash. Commonly, ash deposits are formed on the heat <b>absorbing</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the exposed equipment of the combustion/gasification processes. These deposits lead to the occurrence of slagging or fouling and, consequently, reduced process efficiency. The ash fusion temperatures (AFTs) signify the temperature range over which the ash deposits are formed on the heat <b>absorbing</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the process equipment. Thus, for designing and operating the coal-based processes, {{it is important to}} have mathematical models predicting accurately the four types of AFTs namely initial deformation temperature, softening temperature, hemispherical temperature, and flow temperature. Several linear/nonlinear models with varying prediction accuracies and complexities are available for the AFT prediction. Their principal drawback is their applicability to the coals originating from a limited number of geographical regions. Accordingly, this study presents computational intelligence (CI) based nonlinear models to predict the four AFTs using the oxide composition of the coal ash as the model input. The CI methods used in the modeling are genetic programming (GP), artificial neural networks, and support vector regression. The notable features of this study are that the models with a better AFT prediction and generalization performance, a wider application potential, and reduced complexity, have been developed. Among the CI-based models, GP and MLP based models have yielded overall improved performance in predicting all four AFTs.|$|R
