5|$|The Holy Bible is {{the third}} studio album by Welsh {{alternative}} rock band Manic Street Preachers. It was released on 29 August 1994 by record label Epic. At the time the album was written and recorded, lyricist and rhythm guitarist Richey Edwards was struggling with severe depression, alcohol abuse, self-harm and <b>anorexia</b> <b>nervosa,</b> and its contents are considered by many sources to reflect his mental state. The songs focus on themes relating to politics and human suffering. The Holy Bible was the band's last album released before Edwards' disappearance on 1 February 1995.|$|E

2500|$|After its {{appearance}} in the DSM-III, {{there was a sudden}} rise in the documented incidences of bulimia nervosa. In the early 1980s, incidences of the disorder rose to about 40 in every 100,000 people. [...] This decreased to about 27 in every 100,000 people {{at the end of the}} 1980s/early 1990s.

5|$|The drug label advises that {{bupropion}} {{should not}} be prescribed to individuals with epilepsy or other conditions that lower the seizure threshold, such as <b>anorexia</b> <b>nervosa,</b> bulimia nervosa, active brain tumors, or concurrent alcohol and/or benzodiazepine use and/or withdrawal. It should be avoided in individuals who are also taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). When switching from MAOIs to bupropion, {{it is important to}} include a washout period of about two weeks between the medications. The label recommends that caution should be exercised when treating people with liver damage, severe kidney disease, and severe hypertension, and in children, adolescents and young adults due to the increased risk of suicidal ideation.|$|E
5|$|Clinicians {{assess the}} {{physical}} aspects {{such as the}} appearance of a patient, including apparent age, height, weight, and manner of dress and grooming. Colorful or bizarre clothing might suggest mania, while unkempt, dirty clothes might suggest schizophrenia or depression. If the patient appears much older than his or her chronological age this can suggest chronic poor self-care or ill-health. Clothing and accessories of a particular subculture, body modifications, or clothing not typical of the patient's gender, might give clues to personality. Observations of physical appearance might include the physical features of alcoholism or drug abuse, such as signs of malnutrition, nicotine stains, dental erosion, a rash around the mouth from inhalant abuse, or needle track marks from intravenous drug abuse. Observations can also include any odor which might suggest poor personal hygiene due to extreme self-neglect, or alcohol intoxication. Weight loss could also signify a depressive disorder, physical illness, <b>anorexia</b> <b>nervosa</b> or chronic anxiety.|$|E
25|$|<b>Anorexia</b> <b>nervosa</b> causes {{alterations}} {{in the female}} reproductive system; significant weight loss, as well as psychological stress and intense exercise, typically results in a cessation of menstruation in women who are past puberty. In patients with <b>anorexia</b> <b>nervosa,</b> there is a reduction of the secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone in the central nervous system, preventing ovulation. <b>Anorexia</b> <b>nervosa</b> can also result in pubertal delay or arrest. Both height gain and pubertal development are dependent on the release of growth hormone and gonadotrophins (LH and FSH) from the pituitary gland. Suppression of gonadotrophins in people with <b>anorexia</b> <b>nervosa</b> has been documented. Typically, growth hormone (GH) levels are high, but levels of IGF-1, the downstream hormone that should be released in response to GH are low; this indicates a state of “resistance” to GH due to chronic starvation. IGF-1 is necessary for bone formation, and decreased levels in <b>anorexia</b> <b>nervosa</b> contribute {{to a loss of}} bone density and potentially contribute to osteopenia or osteoporosis. <b>Anorexia</b> <b>nervosa</b> can also result in reduction of peak bone mass. Buildup of bone is greatest during adolescence, and if onset of <b>anorexia</b> <b>nervosa</b> occurs during this time and stalls puberty, low bone mass may be permanent.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the brain of}} patients with <b>anorexia</b> and bulimia <b>nervosa</b> by localized proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1 H-MRS) and to look for metabolic alterations. METHOD: Twenty patients with <b>anorexia</b> and bulimia <b>nervosa</b> were investigated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 1 H-MRS in three regions of the brain. Age and sex-matched healthy subjects were investigated as controls. RESULTS: 1 H-MRS revealed metabolic changes, such as a significant decrease of both myo-inositol and lipid compounds within the frontal white matter. The concentration of these compounds was further reduced with decreasing body mass index. Reduced lipid signals were {{also found in the}} occipital gray matter. In the cerebellum, the concentration of all metabolites including water, except lipids, was increased. DISCUSSION: The metabolic changes found in this study seem to be a consequence of nutritional deficiency. It has to be further investigated whether these findings have any relevance for brain function. 1 H-MRS might serve as a valuable investigative tool to observe eating disorders as <b>anorexia</b> and bulimia <b>nervosa</b> and to follow the success of therapy...|$|R

25|$|<b>Anorexia</b> <b>nervosa,</b> and the {{associated}} malnutrition that results from self-imposed starvation, can cause complications in every major organ system in the body.

25|$|The term <b>anorexia</b> <b>nervosa</b> {{was coined}} in 1873 by Sir William Gull, one of Queen Victoria's {{personal}} physicians. The history of <b>anorexia</b> <b>nervosa</b> begins with descriptions of religious fasting {{dating from the}} Hellenistic era and continuing into the medieval period. The medieval practice of self-starvation by women, including some young women, {{in the name of}} religious piety and purity also concerns anorexia nervosa; it is sometimes referred to as anorexia mirabilis.|$|E
25|$|Zinc {{deficiency}} {{may cause}} {{a decrease in}} appetite which can degenerate into anorexia or <b>anorexia</b> <b>nervosa.</b> Appetite disorders, in turn, cause malnutrition and, notably, inadequate zinc intake. Anorexia itself is a cause of zinc deficiency, thus leading to a vicious cycle: the worsening of anorexia worsens the zinc deficiency. A 1994 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial showed that zinc (14mg per day) doubled the rate of body mass increase {{in the treatment of}} <b>anorexia</b> <b>nervosa.</b>|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{systematic}} review was to summarise the evidence from randomised controlled trials examining the effectiveness of physical therapy compared with care as usual or a wait-list condition on eating pathology and on physiological and psychological parameters in patients with <b>anorexia</b> and bulimia <b>nervosa.</b> Method: EMBASE, PsycINFO, PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Physiotherapy Evidence Database and The Cochrane Library were searched from their inception until February, 2013. Articles were eligible if they utilised a randomised controlled trial design, compared physical therapy with a placebo condition, control intervention, or standard care and included patients with <b>anorexia</b> and bulimia <b>nervosa.</b> The methodological quality was assessed with the Jadad scale. Results: Eight randomised controlled trials involving 213 patients (age range: 16 - 36 years) met all selection criteria. Three of the 8 included studies were of strong methodological quality (Jadad score >= 3). Major methodological weaknesses were attrition and selection bias. The main results demonstrate that aerobic and resistance training result in significantly increased muscle strength, body mass index and body fat percentage in anorexia patients. In addition, aerobic exercise, yoga, massage and basic body awareness therapy significantly lowered scores of eating pathology and depressive symptoms in both <b>anorexia</b> and bulimia <b>nervosa</b> patients. No adverse effects were reported. Conclusions: The paucity and heterogeneity of available studies limits overall conclusions and highlights {{the need for further}} research...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examined}} influential {{factors in}} the development and maintenance of eating disorders. The first chapter investigated homosexuality as a predisposing factor in the development of <b>anorexia</b> and bulimia <b>nervosa</b> in males by considering the published literature on this subject. The implications of the role of homosexual culture in the treatment of males with eating disorders are examined. The main study used techniques from grounded theory to examine the subjective experiences of women with <b>anorexia</b> and bulimia <b>nervosa</b> regarding the influence of media {{in the development and}} maintenance of their disorder. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine women and data collection and analysis were carded out until a point of saturation was reached. A model was developed to explain the relationship between media influence and eating disorder development and maintenance. Clinical implications and avenues of further research were explored. The brief paper examined the stories of women with <b>anorexia</b> and bulimia <b>nervosa</b> about the development of their eating disorder using narrative analysis techniques. Three semi-structured interviews were analysed {{and the ways in which}} the women made sense of their eating disorders were examined. Clinical implications were also discussed. The final chapter explored the researcher's reflections on the research process focusing on methodological considerations and personal reflections of the researcher.

40|$|Aim. The {{purpose was}} to {{evaluate}} the relationship between negative body-related attitudes and self-representation among patients with <b>anorexia</b> and bulimia <b>nervosa.</b> Method. A sample of 33 female anorexic, 38 female bulimic and 40 female students without eating disorders participated in present study. We used The Figure Rating Scale (Stunkard et al., 1983) and the Body Attitude Test (Probst et al., 1995). Results. The results showed that there are statistically {{significant differences in the}} ideal self, the ought self, actual-ideal discrepancy, actual-ought discrepancy, negative appreciation of body size, lack of familiarity with one’s own body and general body dissatisfaction in the three examined groups. The results also indicate that the negative appreciation of body size and general body dissatisfaction are associated with actual-ideal discrepancy and actual-ought discrepancy in both groups of eating disordered patients.

50|$|The {{album and}} {{included}} booklet {{tell the story}} of a woman named Nervosa who begins her story by taking a job at The 120 Days Of Sodom (named from the controversial novel of the same name by Marquis de Sade) which is a combination strip club and slaughterhouse. The 120 Days Of Sodom has two floors, a killing floor and a dance floor above it. The dance floor features a transparent bottom so that visitors to the strip club can see through to the killing floor where animals are being slaughtered. Like her sister <b>Anorexia,</b> <b>Nervosa's</b> story takes place within two texts. The first section of each chapter tells Nervosa's story in a more stylized, fairy tale-esque and metaphorical manner. Within this text, Nervosa spends the story laboring to dig a hole as deeply as possible, which parallels her quest to reach the depths of human depravity. The subsequent text in each chapter is narrated by Nervosa herself, and takes place in real time in the actual world. One evening while giving a private dance, Nervosa is assaulted, beaten and raped. She later learns she has become pregnant {{as a result of the}} rape and seeks an unsafe abortion. At this point in the story, the real time narrative ceases and the remaining chapters are carried exclusively through metaphorical means. Nervosa, broken and dying within her deep hole she has dug, wakes in a sunlit field and finds that she has been carried to safety by a small lamb who died in the process of rescuing her. The lamb however, resurrects and explains that he had given his life to save Nervosa simply to fulfill his lifelong desire to be with her.|$|R
