5|$|No {{matter which}} side of the debate the experts are on, they all agree on one thing: All forms of custody work best with good {{communication}} <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>willingness</b> for the parents to work and to shield children from being involved in their parents' disputes.|$|E
5|$|The second {{daughter}} of King Frederick II of Denmark, Anne married James in 1589 at age 15 and bore him three children who survived infancy, including the future Charles I. She demonstrated an independent streak <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>willingness</b> to use factional Scottish politics in her conflicts with James over {{the custody of}} Prince Henry and his treatment of her friend Beatrix Ruthven. Anne appears to have loved James at first, but the couple gradually drifted and eventually lived apart, though mutual respect and a degree of affection survived.|$|E

5|$|The third {{industrial}} revolution is spreading from {{the developed world}} to some, but not all, parts of the developing world. To participate in this new global economy, developing countries {{must be seen as}} attractive offshore production bases for multinational corporations. To be such bases, developing countries must provide relatively well-educated workforces, good infrastructure (electricity, telecommunications, transportation), political stability, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>willingness</b> to play by market rules.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} hours of 1 May, Krebs talked to General Chuikov, {{commander}} of the Soviet 8th Guards Army, informing him of Hitler's death <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>willingness</b> to negotiate a citywide surrender. They could not agree on terms because of Soviet insistence on unconditional surrender and Krebs' claim that he lacked authorisation to agree to that. Goebbels was against surrender. In the afternoon, Goebbels and his wife killed their children and then themselves. Goebbels's death removed the last impediment which prevented Weidling from accepting the terms of unconditional surrender of his garrison, but he chose to delay the surrender until the next morning to allow the planned breakout to take place under the cover of darkness.|$|E
5|$|Socially, {{economic}} dynamism {{opened up}} one of the avenues of social mobility in the Roman Empire. Social advancement was thus not dependent solely on birth, patronage, good luck, or even extraordinary ability. Although aristocratic values permeated traditional elite society, a strong tendency towards plutocracy is indicated by the wealth requirements for census rank. Prestige could be obtained through investing one's wealth in ways that advertised it appropriately: grand country estates or townhouses, durable luxury items such as jewels and silverware, public entertainments, funerary monuments for family members or coworkers, and religious dedications such as altars. Guilds (collegia) and corporations (corpora) provided support for individuals to succeed through networking, sharing sound business practices, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>willingness</b> to work.|$|E

5|$|The Nazi era {{continues}} to inform how Germans view {{themselves and their}} country. Virtually every family suffered losses during the war or has a story to tell, though Germans kept quiet about their experiences and {{felt a sense of}} communal guilt, even if they were not directly involved in war crimes. Once study of Nazi Germany was introduced into the school curriculum starting in the 1970s, as people began researching the experiences of their family members. Study of the era <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>willingness</b> to critically examine its mistakes has {{led to the development of}} a strong democracy in today's Germany, but with lingering undercurrents of antisemitism and neo-Nazi thought.|$|E
5|$|The {{capture of}} Detroit and Hull's army wounded American morale, and {{eliminated}} the main American {{force in the}} area as a threat, {{while at the same}} time boosting morale among his own forces. Brock took the American supplies at Detroit and used them for his own forces, particularly the ill-equipped militia. Under prize regulations, a substantial part of the value of the captured military stores would accrue to him. (If he had lived longer, he could have settled his debts.) Brock valued the captured ordnance supplies at £30,000. Finally, the victory secured the support of Tecumseh and the other chiefs in his confederation, who took Brock's actions as both a sign of competence <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>willingness</b> to take action.|$|E
5|$|The {{extensive}} campaigning abroad by Rome, and the rewarding {{of soldiers}} with plunder from those campaigns, {{led to the}} trend of soldiers becoming increasingly loyal to their commanders {{rather than to the}} state, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>willingness</b> to follow their generals in battle against the state. Rome was plagued by several slave uprisings during this period, in part because in the past century vast tracts of land had been given to veterans who farmed by use of slaves and who came to greatly outnumber their Roman masters. In the last century BC, at least twelve civil wars and rebellions occurred. This pattern did not break until Octavian (later Caesar Augustus) ended it by becoming a successful challenger to the Senate's authority, and was made princeps (emperor).|$|E

25|$|In the Third Step members {{surrender}} {{their will}} to a Higher Power, {{this should not}} be understood as encouraging passiveness, rather its purpose is to increase acceptance of reality. The process of working the Twelve Steps is intended to replace self-centeredness with a growing moral consciousness <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>willingness</b> for self-sacrifice and unselfish constructive action; this is known as a spiritual awakening, or religious experience.|$|E
25|$|Outside of the {{relatively}} urban space of Trabzon proper, and within parts of it as well, rural traditions from the Black Sea village life are still thriving. These include traditional gender roles, social conservatism, hospitality <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>willingness</b> to help strangers; and all aspects, both positive and negative, of an agrarian lifestyle, such as hard work, poverty, strong family ties, and a closeness to nature.|$|E
25|$|Holt fostered greater {{collaboration}} between the government, the courts, employers and trade unions. He enjoyed good relationships with union leaders like Albert Monk, President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions; and Jim Healy, leader of the radical Waterside Workers Federation;and he gained a reputation for tolerance, restraint <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>willingness</b> to compromise, although his controversial decision to use troops {{to take control of}} cargo facilities during a waterside dispute in Bowen, Queensland in September 1953 provoked bitter criticism.|$|E

25|$|Petals of Blood was Ngugi's {{first novel}} written whilst not in {{full-time}} education, instead written {{over a five-year}} period. Initially begun whilst teaching at Northwestern University in 1970, the writer continued {{to work on the}} novel after his return to Kenya, finally finishing the novel in Yalta as a guest of the Soviet Writers' Union. Ngugi was inspired to write the novel as a way of synthesizing the notion of a postcolonial nation, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>willingness</b> to portray the agents of social change present in Kenya's change from British East Africa. Petals of Blood was the last of Ngugi's novels to be written first in English.|$|E
25|$|Early on 10 May 1940, the German diplomat Von Radowitz {{handed the}} general {{secretary}} of the Luxembourgish government a memorandum from the German government, stating that Germany had no intention of changing the territorial integrity or political independence of the Grand Duchy. The following day, a military administration for Luxembourg was set up. Luxembourgish interests were represented by a governmental commission under Albert Wehrer, which consisted of senior civil servants and had been legitimated by the Chamber of Deputies. There was a good relationship between this commission and the military authorities, as Colonel Schumacher showed a broad-minded attitude towards the country's problems <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>willingness</b> to solve these in consultation with the government commission.|$|E
25|$|Priapus joined Pan and the satyrs as {{a spirit}} of {{fertility}} and growth, though he was perennially frustrated by his impotence. In a ribald anecdote told by Ovid, he attempted to rape the goddess Hestia but was thwarted by an ass, whose braying caused him to lose his erection at the critical moment and woke Hestia. The episode gave him a lasting hatred of asses <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>willingness</b> to see them destroyed in his honour. The emblem of his lustful nature was his permanent erection and his large penis. Another myth states that he pursued the nymph Lotis until the gods took pity on her and turned her into a lotus plant.|$|E
30|$|Variability in {{both natural}} herd growth (potential offtake) and actual offtake has decreased, {{pointing}} to increased stability. However, actual offtake {{in this study}} is more than potential offtake, which also indicates reduced productivity <b>and</b> ultimately <b>a</b> <b>willingness</b> to reduce herd size and compromise long-term herd growth, if viable breeding females are sold.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} the auditor’s misstatement detection and reporting process, which consists of three steps: (1) awareness of the transaction, (2) recognition that the transaction’s accounting treatment results in <b>a</b> misstatement, <b>and</b> (3) <b>a</b> <b>willingness</b> to modify the audit opinion to disclose the nature of misstatement if management does not correct the misstatements...|$|R
25|$|Charles {{analysed}} {{what would}} be necessary for him to withstand a larger force and superior technology (the Muslim horsemen had adopted the armour and accoutrements of heavy cavalry from the Sassanid warrior class, which made the armored mounted knight possible). Not daring to send his few horsemen against the Islamic cavalry, he had his army fight in a formation used by the ancient Greeks to withstand superior numbers and weapons by discipline, courage, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>willingness</b> to die for their cause: a phalanx. He had trained a core of his men year round, using mostly Church funds, and some had been with him since his earliest days after his father's death. It was this hard core of disciplined veterans that won the day for him at Tours.|$|E
25|$|In December 1918, Stalin {{was sent}} to Perm to lead an inquiry into how the Red Army forces based there had been {{decimated}} in an attack by Alexander Kolchak's White forces. He returned to Moscow between January and March 1919, before being assigned to the Western Front at Petrograd. When the Third Regiment defected, he ordered any captured defectors to be publicly shot. In September he was returned to the Southern Front. During the war, he proved his worth to the Central Committee, displaying decisiveness, determination, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>willingness</b> to take on responsibility in conflict situations. At the same time, he disregarded orders and when affronted he repeatedly threatened to resign, forcing Lenin to convince him to reconsider. In November 1919, the government awarded him the Order of the Red Banner for his service in the war.|$|E
25|$|American Jews in the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries {{played a}} major role in {{developing}} America's financial services industry, both at investment banks and investment funds. German Jewish bankers began to assume a major role in American finance in the 1830s when government and private borrowing to pay for canals, railroads and other internal improvements increased rapidly and significantly. Men such as August Belmont (Rothschild's agent in New York and a leading Democrat), Philip Speyer, Jacob Schiff (at Kuhn, Loeb & Company), Joseph Seligman, Philip Lehman (of Lehman Brothers), Jules Bache, and Marcus Goldman (of Goldman Sachs) illustrate this financial elite. As was true of their non-Jewish counterparts, family, personal, and business connections, a reputation for honesty and integrity, ability, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>willingness</b> to take calculated risks were essential to recruit capital from widely scattered sources. The families and the firms which they controlled were bound together by religious and social factors, and by the prevalence of intermarriage. These personal ties fulfilled real business functions before the advent of institutional organization in the 20th century. Antisemitic elements often falsely targeted them as key players in a supposed Jewish cabal conspiring to dominate the world.|$|E

25|$|Few Palestinian Arabs {{joined the}} Arab Liberation Army because they {{suspected}} that the other Arab States did not plan on an independent Palestinian state. According to Ian Bickerton, for that reason many of them favored partition <b>and</b> indicated <b>a</b> <b>willingness</b> to live alongside a Jewish state. He also mentions that the Nashashibi family backed King Abdullah and union with Transjordan.|$|R
40|$|Respect {{is one of}} the {{cornerstones}} {{of healthy}} relationships. The article features the Couple’s Respect Questionnaire as a tool for couples to explore specific examples and qualities of respect in their relationship. The four Rs are presented as core components of respect. They consist of Respect for differences, Responsibility (ability to respond respectfully), Review (<b>a</b> <b>willingness</b> to review), <b>and</b> Release (<b>a</b> <b>willingness</b> to release). Following a profile of the assessed behaviors, a stepwise procedure is outlined to increase <b>a</b> couple’s respect <b>and</b> understanding of behavioral and personality differences...|$|R
