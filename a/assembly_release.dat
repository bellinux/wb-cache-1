40|$|Hepatitis C virus (HCV) {{is known}} to be a major cause of chronic hepatitis, liver {{cirrhosis}} and hepatocarcinoma. Therapeutic reagents are improving, but are still limited, and the protective vaccine against HCV is not available yet. However, the research of HCV life cycle and pathogenesis has been difficult due to obstacles, which are the lack of effective cell culture systems and small-animal models. Recently, breathtaking progress in terms of HCV replication system has been made using various forms of HCV clones and human hepatocarcinoma 7 cell lines (huh 7). The establishment of complete cell-culture system for HCV replication gave researchers opportunities to study the entire viral life cycle including entry, <b>assembly,</b> <b>release</b> of viral particles and the interaction with host cells.

40|$|SummaryFanconi anemia (FA) {{is a human}} {{genetic disease}} {{characterized}} by chromosome instability, cancer predisposition, and cellular hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents. The FA pathway regulates the repair of DNA crosslinks. A critical step in this pathway is the monoubiquitination and deubiquitination of FANCD 2. Deubiquitination of FANCD 2 is mediated by the ubiquitin protease, USP 1. Here, we demonstrate that targeted deletion of mouse Usp 1 results in elevated perinatal lethality, male infertility, crosslinker hypersensitivity, and an FA phenotype. Usp 1 −/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts had heightened levels of monoubiquitinated Fancd 2 in chromatin. Usp 1 −/− cells exhibited impaired Fancd 2 foci assembly and a defect in homologous recombination repair. Double knockout of Usp 1 and Fancd 2 resulted in a more severe phenotype than either single knockout. Our results indicate that mouse Usp 1 functions downstream in the FA pathway. Deubiquitination is a critical event required for Fancd 2 nuclear foci <b>assembly,</b> <b>release</b> from chromatin, and function in DNA repair...|$|E

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the underlying mechanism by which direct cell-cell contact enhances the efficiency of cell-to-cell transmission of retroviruses. Applying 4 D imaging to a model retrovirus, the murine leukemia virus, we directly monitor and quantify sequential <b>assembly,</b> <b>release,</b> and transmission events for individual viral particles as they happen in living cells. We demonstrate that de novo assembly is highly polarized towards zones of cell-cell contact. Viruses assembled approximately 10 -fold more frequently at zones of cell contact with no change in assembly kinetics. Gag proteins were drawn to adhesive zones formed by viral Env glycoprotein and its cognate receptor to promote virus assembly at cell-cell contact. This process was dependent on the cytoplasmic tail of viral Env. Env lacking the cytoplasmic tail while still allowing for contact formation, failed to direct virus assembly towards contact sites. Our data describe a novel role for the viral Env glycoprotein in establishing cell-cell adhesion and polarization of assembly prior to becoming a fusion protein to allow virus entry into cells...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe porcine {{endogenous}} retrovirus (PERV) Gag protein contains two late (L) domain motifs, PPPY and P(F/S) AP. Using viral release assays we demonstrate that PPPY is the dominant L domain involved in PERV release. PFAP represents a novel retroviral L domain variant and is defined by abnormal viral assembly phenotypes visualized by electron microscopy and attenuation of early PERV release as measured by viral genomes. PSAP is functionally dominant over PFAP in early PERV release. PSAP virions are 3. 5 -fold more infectious in vitro by TCID 50 and in vivo results in more RNA positive tissues {{and higher levels of}} proviral DNA using our human PERV-A receptor (HuPAR- 2) transgenic mouse model [Martina, Y., Marcucci, K.

40|$|Late {{steps of}} HIV- 1 life cycle are {{determinant}} for optimal dissemination {{of the virus}} to new target cells. These steps include assembly of structural precursors, budding of the new particle and maturation into fully infectious virions. Each step is finely tuned and timely regulated to allow the appropriate assembly of structural components, the efficient recruitment of viral and cell partners and the timely regulated proteolytic processing of the protein precursors. Despite the huge number of studies devoted {{to the definition of}} molecular mechanisms regulating these steps, a number of question remains to be answered before they are clearly apprehended. The elucidation of the role played by each viral proteins, nucleic acids as well as host-encoded factors will provide new clues in the understanding of the retroviral assembly/maturation process and will allow further development of new antiviral compounds. This review reports the most recent progress as well as the questions that remain to be answered in the field of HIV- 1 <b>assembly,</b> <b>release</b> and maturation. Finally, we also describe the data available on the design and use of new antiretroviral drugs targeting these specific steps of the retroviral replication...|$|E

The average intermarker spacing was 251. 8 kb. The average minor allele frequency (MAF) was 0. 29 (0. 05 – 0. 5). Following recent precedents in human HapMap studies, a haplotype block was defined where 95 % of combinations of SNPs within a region are in very high linkage disequilibrium. A total of 727 haplotype blocks consisting of ≥ 3 SNPs were identified. The average block length was 69. 7 ± 7. 7 kb, which is ∼ 5 – 10 times larger than in humans. These blocks comprised a total of 2964 SNPs and covered 50, 638 kb of the sequence map, which constitutes 2. 18 % of the length of all autosomes. A set of tag SNPs, which will be useful for further fine-mapping studies, has been identified. Overall, the results suggest that as many as 75, 000 – 100, 000 tag SNPs would be needed to track all important haplotype blocks in the bovine genome. This would require ∼ 250, 000 SNPs in the discovery phase...|$|E
40|$|Fluorescently labeled human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) derivatives, combined {{with the use of}} advanced fluorescence microscopy techniques, allow the direct visualization of dynamic events and individual steps in the viral life cycle. HIV proteins tagged with fluorescent proteins (FPs) have been successfully used for live-cell imaging analyses of HIV-cell interactions. However, FPs display limitations with respect to their physicochemical properties, and their maturation kinetics. Furthermore, several independent FP-tagged constructs have to be cloned and characterized in order to obtain spectral variations suitable for multi-color imaging setups. In contrast, the so-called SNAP-tag represents a genetically encoded non-fluorescent tag which mediates specific covalent coupling to fluorescent substrate molecules in a self-labeling reaction. Fusion of the SNAP-tag to the protein of interest allows specific labeling of the fusion protein with a variety of synthetic dyes, thereby offering enhanced flexibility for fluorescence imaging approaches. Here we describe the construction and characterization of the HIV derivative HIV SNAP, which carries the SNAP-tag as an additional domain within the viral structural polyprotein Gag. Introduction of the tag close to the C-terminus of the matrix domain of Gag did not interfere with particle <b>assembly,</b> <b>release</b> or proteolytic virus maturation. The modified virions were infectious and could be propagated in tissue culture, albeit with reduced replication capacity. Insertion of the SNAP domain within Gag allowed specific staining of the viral polyprotein in the context of virus producing cells using a SNAP reactive dye as well as th...|$|E
40|$|To {{study the}} precise {{role of the}} {{neuraminidase}} (NA), and its stalk region in particular, in the <b>assembly,</b> <b>release,</b> and entry of influenza virus, we deleted the 20 -aa stalk segment from 2009 pandemic H 1 N 1 NA (09 N 1) and inserted this segment, now designated 09 s 60, into the stalk region of a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus H 5 N 1 NA (AH N 1). The biological characterization of these wild-type and mutant NAs was analyzed by pseudotyped particles (pseudoparticles) system. Compared with the wild-type AH N 1, the wild-type 09 N 1 exhibited higher NA activity and released more pseudoparticles. Deletion/insertion of the 09 s 60 segment did not alter this relationship. The infectivity of pseudoparticles harboring NA {{in combination with the}} hemagglutinin from HPAI H 5 N 1 (AH H 5) was decreased by insertion of 09 s 60 into AH N 1 and was increased by deletion of 09 s 60 from 09 N 1.
