5|$|Known {{initially}} as <b>a</b> <b>kindly</b> physician, Doc Ames led {{the city}} into corruption during four terms as mayor just before 1900. The gangster Kid Cann {{was famous for}} bribery and intimidation during the 1930s and 1940s. The city made dramatic changes to rectify discrimination as early as 1886 when Martha Ripley founded Maternity Hospital for both married and unmarried mothers.|$|E
5|$|Located in St John's Lodge in the Inner Circle of Regent's Park, the IOA {{was founded}} in 1937, largely by {{archaeologist}} Mortimer Wheeler, but until 1946 relied primarily upon volunteer lecturers. Childe's relationship with the conservative Wheeler was strained, the latter being intolerant of the shortcomings of others, something Childe made an effort never to be. He was popular among students, who saw him as <b>a</b> <b>kindly</b> eccentric; they commissioned a bust of Childe from Marjorie Maitland Howard. His lecturing was nevertheless considered poor, as he often mumbled and walked into an adjacent room to find something while continuing to talk. He consistently referred to the socialist states of eastern Europe by their full official titles, and called towns by their Slavonic rather than Germanic names, further confusing his students. He was deemed better at giving tutorials and seminars, where he devoted more time to interacting with his students. As Director, Childe was not obliged to excavate, though he did undertake projects at the Orkney Neolithic burial tombs of Quoyness (1951) and Maes Howe (1954–55).|$|E

5|$|Mr. Poe {{leaves them}} with their Aunt Josephine, <b>a</b> <b>kindly</b> woman who is {{nonetheless}} obsessed with grammar and has irrational fears. Olaf appears disguised as Captain Sham to interfere with their plans again. One day, Josephine is not at the house, leaving what is apparently a suicide note; Klaus takes advantage of mistakes in the letter's grammar (which Josephine would never have tolerated) to decode her location; Curdled Cave. A hurricane sweeps through the town, ultimately destroying the house but allowing the children to flee before the structure falls apart. They sail to the cave and rescue her, but attract leeches due to Josephine having eaten a banana. Olaf appears and takes the kids with him, throwing Josephine off the boat and to the Lachrymose Leeches after she annoys him by correcting his speech.|$|E

25|$|By all accounts, Burbank was <b>a</b> <b>kindly</b> man {{who wanted}} to help other people.

25|$|As a deaf from birth, {{and growing}} up in a time when no {{standardized}} sign language for the deaf existed, the young Brewster probably interacted with few people outside of the circle of his family and friends, with whom he would have learned to communicate. <b>A</b> <b>kindly</b> minister taught him to paint, and by the 1790s he was traveling through Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, and eastern New York State, taking advantage of his family connections to offer his services to the wealthy merchant class.|$|E
25|$|The Hammer {{films are}} a {{series in the}} loosest sense, since there is only tenuous {{continuity}} between the films after the first two (which are carefully connected). Starting with The Evil of Frankenstein, the films are standalone stories with occasional vague references to previous films, much the way the James Bond films form a series. In some of the films, the Baron is <b>a</b> <b>kindly,</b> even heroic figure, while in others he is ruthless and cruel and clearly the villain of the piece.|$|E
25|$|At her {{original}} audition, show's composer Andrew Lloyd Webber had asked {{whether she would}} be interested if he wrote anything he thought appropriate for her voice. Assuming it was <b>a</b> <b>kindly</b> rejection, she was later surprised to be invited for a meal at Mr. Chow, a London restaurant, with Lloyd Webber and the lyricist Don Black to discuss {{the concept of a}} song cycle inspired by the story of a friend of the writers who had moved from London to the United States to begin a new life.|$|E

25|$|Murray {{was sent}} off sick {{for a month}} (24 January 1915) and French demanded his {{resignation}} (25 January 1915), despite Murray insisting that he only needed {{to take a few}} days off. Wilson was widely suspected of having plotted for Murray's removal in the vain hope of replacing him, but the job went to Robertson. Although a sore throat prevented him seeing Murray off, French wrote to him (29 January) saying he hoped to see him back as an army commander before long. Haig wrote (diary 26 January) that “Murray was <b>a</b> <b>kindly</b> fellow but not a practical man in the field”.|$|E
25|$|Sixteen-year-old Subaru Sumeragi, {{the main}} character, {{is a very}} {{powerful}} magician, the thirteenth head of the foremost family of onmyōji in Japan, which has served the Emperor for centuries. As such, he is called upon to solve various occult mysteries, or stumbles himself on people whom his kind nature compels him to help. These occurrences form the main plot of most chapters. He lives in Tokyo with his twin sister Hokuto, an exuberant girl whose chief occupations are to design eccentric clothing for herself and her brother, and to egg on their mutual friend Seishirō Sakurazuka, <b>a</b> <b>kindly,</b> 25-year-old veterinarian, when he declares his love for Subaru.|$|E

25|$|Set {{in early}} 19th-century France, {{it is the}} story of Jean Valjean, a French peasant, and his quest for {{redemption}} after serving nineteen years in jail for having stolen a loaf of bread for his sister's starving child. Valjean decides to break his parole and start his life anew after <b>a</b> <b>kindly</b> bishop inspires him by a tremendous act of mercy, but he is relentlessly tracked down by a police inspector named Javert. Along the way, Valjean and a slew of characters are swept into a revolutionary period in France, where a group of young idealists make their last stand at a street barricade.|$|E
25|$|The {{description}} of Herod Agrippa as a cruel, heartless king who persecuted the Jerusalem church, having James son of Zebedee killed and imprisoning Peter, stands {{in contrast with}} Josephus' account of <b>a</b> <b>kindly</b> man. According to Josephus, he was a milder ruler than his grandfather Herod the Great, and Josephus records him as talking with and then forgiving a law student accused of political rabble rousing, rather than punishing him as his grandfather and some other Herods would have done. Christian scholars argue that the biblical account makes sense given that Agrippa had been raised with a strong Jewish identity. Agrippa would resent a movement begun during his absence from Judæa that tried to declare a man as divine.|$|E
25|$|Tragedy {{struck the}} family in the summer of 1883, when a {{debilitating}} fever swept through the family. Johnny's half-sister Annie, 13, was the first to succumb; and his mother died shortly thereafter. By the time September 1883 had passed, three more McGraw children had died. The devastated family moved from their house in the country into a hotel in town. Johnny's father, understandably bitter, heaped even more responsibility on the young boy's shoulders, and had very little patience for his son's passion for baseball. He became abusive toward the boy; and later on in 1885 (still only 12 years old), Johnny ran away. From that day onward, young John was raised by <b>a</b> <b>kindly</b> neighbor, Mary Goddard, under whose care he did quite well.|$|E
