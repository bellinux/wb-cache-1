5|$|By 1926, {{the piece}} of current NY9N from Hague to Ticonderoga was {{designated}} as the easternmost leg of NY47, which continued west to Chestertown on modern NY8. In 1927, most of NY6 north of Round Lake was replaced by US9 when U.S. Highways were first signed in New York. The lone exception was between Elizabethtown and Keeseville, where US9 followed a previously unnumbered highway to the east instead. The bypassed section of NY6 between the two locations was redesignated as NY9W at this time. NY9W was renumbered to NY9N {{as part of the}} 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, eliminating the <b>alphanumerical</b> duplication between itself and US9W.|$|E
25|$|Keyboard is {{organized}} as a matrix with maximum 11 input lines and 8 output lines, accounting for maximum 88 keys (including all control, numerical and <b>alphanumerical</b> keys). Each scan line is regularly queried {{to identify the}} state of the keys on the line; query speed is identified by the system interrupt frequency. Such organization allows system to sense state of each key, not exhibiting notorious problem with 8042 microcontroller-based keyboards when pressing several keys simultaneously (usually more than 3) generates wrong input characters, or renders inability to sense the press of more keys.|$|E
25|$|Shoe size is an <b>alphanumerical</b> {{indication}} of the fitting size of a shoe for a person. Often it just consists of a number indicating the length because many shoemakers only provide a standard width for economic reasons. There are several different shoe-size systems that are used worldwide. These systems differ in what they measure, what unit of measurement they use, and where the size 0 (or 1) is positioned. Only a few systems also take {{the width of the}} feet into account. Some regions use different shoe-size systems for different types of shoes (e.g., men's, women's, children's, sport, or safety shoes).|$|E
500|$|LDUs {{ending in}} zero {{correspond}} to postal facilities, from post offices and small franchised retail postal outlets {{all the way}} up to sortation plants. In urban areas, LDUs may be specific postal carriers' routes. In rural areas where direct door-to-door delivery is not available, an LDU can describe a set of post office boxes or a rural route. [...] LDU 9Z9 is used exclusively for Business Reply Mail. In rural FSAs, the first two characters are usually assigned in <b>alphanumerical</b> order by the name of each community.|$|E

2500|$|Enter {{a string}} of <b>alphanumerical</b> characters. Certain characters, like accented foreign letters, are not allowed. Thus, to search for {{sequences}} relating to Znám's problem, try enter it without the accents: [...] "Znam's problem". The handling of apostrophes has been greatly improved in the 2006 redesign. The search strings [...] "Pascal's triangle," [...] "Pascals triangle" [...] and [...] "Pascal triangle" [...] all give the desired results.|$|E

BUMED is divided into ten departments, each referred to with an <b>alphanumerical</b> code. Each of the staff corps is headed by a rear admiral, except for the Hospital Corps, which is headed by a force master chief petty officer because of its status as an enlisted rating. [...] The other department heads are mostly either rear admirals or civilians.|$|E
2500|$|CAPTCHA {{is a form}} {{of reverse}} Turing test. [...] Before being allowed to perform some action on a website, the user is {{presented}} with <b>alphanumerical</b> characters in a distorted graphic image and asked to type them out. [...] This is intended to prevent automated systems from being used to abuse the site. [...] The rationale is that software sufficiently sophisticated to read and reproduce the distorted image accurately does not exist (or is not available to the average user), so any system able to do so {{is likely to be a}} human.|$|E

Reynolds, MD, a prominent citizen of Asheville; and commissioned on 6 July 1920, with Lieutenant Commander (LCDR) Elliott Buckmaster, {{who would later}} command the carrier [...] during World War II, in temporary command. One week later, on 13 July, Commander Jesse B. Gay relieved Buckmaster. On 17 July, the ship was given the <b>alphanumerical</b> designation PG-21.|$|E
2500|$|Emily and Emily's Entourage have {{received}} significant {{regional and national}} media coverage. The attention has driven donations as well research opportunities and public awareness. Philadelphia Magazine profiled Emily as a [...] "Health Hero" [...] in September 2015. [...] Emily said, [...] "My biggest motivations for working my hardest to stay as healthy as possible — {{even in the face}} of an advanced and progressing fatal illness — are my family and friends, this burning desire to do more things and see more places, and the unbelievable Entourage that rallied behind me to give me and so many others real, tangible hope for that chance." [...] People magazine wrote, [...] "Perhaps the most critical of Emily's Entourage's efforts has been its success in putting a beautiful face on an ugly issue. Case in point: The test tubes that fill the testing laboratories at USCF are all marked with random <b>alphanumerical</b> codes – except those marked with Emily's name." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the oldest}} and least {{complicated}} DRM protection methods for computer and Nintendo NES games was when the game would pause and ask you to look up a certain page in the booklet that came with the game, if you did not have the book or entered the key wrong you could not continue. A product key, a typically <b>alphanumerical</b> serial number used to represent a license to a particular piece of software. During the installation process or launch for the software, the user is asked to input the key; if the key correctly corresponds to a valid license (typically via internal algorithms), the key is accepted, then the user who bought the game can continue. In modern practice, product keys are typically combined with other DRM practices (such as online [...] "activation"), as the software could be cracked to run without a product key, or [...] "keygen" [...] programs could be developed to generate keys that would be accepted.|$|E

Many outlines include a numerical or <b>alphanumerical</b> prefix preceding each {{entry in the}} outline, to provide a specific path for each item, to aid in referring to and discussing the entries listed. An <b>alphanumerical</b> outline uses alternating letters and numbers to identify entries. A decimal outline uses only numbers as prefixes. An outline without prefixes is called a [...] "bare outline".|$|E
