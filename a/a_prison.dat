5|$|Pardelup Prison Farm {{opened in}} 1927, near Mount Barker, while Barton's Mill, though {{planned to be}} a {{temporary}} measure, remained open as <b>a</b> <b>prison</b> after World War II.

In both cases, the only aspects resembling <b>a</b> <b>prison</b> were the presence of guards, and the compulsion to remain there – enforced by the remoteness of the facilities {{and the integrity of}} prisoners chosen to be transferred there. Escapees were generally punished with extended sentences at the harsher Fremantle Prison, which had little change over the four decades from 1920 to 1960.|$|E

5|$|Richard's son, Edmund {{took over}} the earldom in 1278 but had little {{interest}} in Lydford, preferring Restormel and Lostwithiel; by his death in 1299 the castle had been left to decay and was in ruins. It reverted to the Crown, and when Edward II made his royal favourite, Piers Gaveston, the Earl of Cornwall in 1307, Lydford Castle was passed to him. The castle was repaired {{at the start of the}} century and was in use once again as <b>a</b> <b>prison.</b> Edward II and Gaveston fell from power in 1327 and Thomas le Ercedekne was temporarily entrusted with the castle and Dartmoor by the new regime. In 1329 the castle was valued at a little over £11. Piers Gaveston's widow, Margaret de Clare, leased the property to Tavistock Abbey, and it continued to operate as <b>a</b> <b>prison.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{documentary evidence}} of building work at Halton Castle shows {{that during the}} 15thcentury and into the 16thcentury it was regularly maintained.

However a survey of the Royal Palaces in 1609 suggests that by then the castle had fallen into disrepair. During the Tudor period it was used less as a fortress and more as <b>a</b> <b>prison,</b> an administrative centre, and a court of law. In 1580–81 the castle was designated as <b>a</b> <b>prison</b> for Catholic recusants, but there is no evidence that it was ever used for that purpose.|$|E
