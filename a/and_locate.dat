They can cause injuries such as hemorrhaging of the lungs, and contusion and ulceration of the gastrointestinal tract. Underwater noise is generated from shipping, the oil and gas industry, research, and military use of sonar and oceanographic acoustic experimentation. Acoustic harassment devices and acoustic deterrent devices used by aquaculture facilities to scare away marine mammals emit loud and noxious underwater sounds.|$|E

Avatars can sense the existence of their moral opponent, but are unable to detect or identify them outside of close physical proximity.

These abilities contribute to the convergence of the two storylines in Carnivàle.|$|E
