25|$|Misao's mother. She remembers Kyo {{from his}} and Misao's {{childhood}} and trusts him a lot, despite knowing little about him. She is initially upset when Misao becomes pregnant, but agrees {{to let her}} and Kyo marry. In chapter 69, she discovers Kyo's secret as a demon when he saves her; however, she believes that Kyo will be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>husband</b> to Misao and father to Sou.|$|E
25|$|His first {{marriage}} {{lasted only a}} couple of months. Angered by demeaning treatment from his in-laws, he assaulted them, for which he spent some time in prison. He never returned to his wife. Instead, he moved to Zabok and married Katica Tisanić, a divorced woman with a child. They built a house in Zabok and had a daughter. For a while, Pintarić was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>husband</b> and father, a man who wanted to move away from his traumatic childhood and failed marriage.|$|E
25|$|Never Better {{is about}} Keith Merchant (Mangan), a {{recovering}} alcoholic in his mid-thirties whose life {{never seems to}} get better. His problems come from him being self-centred and preoccupied with his own flaws. He attends Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, but his behaviour often turns meetings into a farce, to the annoyance of group leader Doug (Christopher Fairbank). He has a family, with his wife Anita (Ashfield) and two children, Tom and Poppy. Whilst he attempts to be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>husband</b> and father, his optimism for his family and attempts {{to do the right}} thing tend to lead to even more problems. Outside of AA, he has his friend Richard (Tom Goodman-Hill) for support, although Richard believes that Keith was a better friend when he was drinking.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Only once, Fred! On my honour, only once. The Duke is <b>a</b> fairly <b>good</b> <b>husband,</b> I repeat. But {{you deserve}} {{punishment}} for this night's trick of drawing me out. What does it mean?' ...|$|R
25|$|Though not {{all women}} are {{politicians}} or war generals, boys are {{raised in the}} domestic sphere. Not only that, but men come back to it every day in their private homes. Even President Theodore Roosevelt can be quoted to say “o man {{can be a good}} citizen who is not <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>husband</b> and a good father.” Similar to how history needs domestic history incorporated into it, men’s history cannot be understood without their private experiences known. Women’s history thus needs their private experiences to be combined with their public. To successfully integrate these histories, the world must not have male and female spheres that are synonyms for the private and public. The connections found in public and private men’s and women’s history need to be systematically synthesized to successfully integrate them. So the idea of just two histories creates the challenge that most feminist historians have.|$|E
25|$|At age 9 {{the younger}} Rav Scheinberg moved {{with his family}} into a small {{apartment}} on the Lower East Side, where his mother gave birth to twins, Shmuel and Chana Baila. After briefly attending public school, Scheinberg enrolled in the Rabbi Jacob Joseph School (RJJ), where he studied until age 14. At that time, Yaakov Yosef Herman, who influenced promising young Jewish men in New York City to advance in their Torah learning, encouraged him to transfer to Rabbi Yehuda Levenberg's Beis Medrash LeRabbonim yeshiva in New Haven, Connecticut, where no secular subjects were taught. Herman also decided that the youth would make <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>husband</b> for his third daughter, Bessie, who was then only 12 years old. By the time Scheinberg left the yeshiva {{at the age of}} sixteen and a half, he was regarded as a diligent student and had completed the entire Talmud.|$|E
500|$|Other themes {{prevalent}} in the episode include Lori's pregnancy. After getting into a heated argument, Rick reveals to Shane about her pregnancy. Although he didn't question who the biological father was, Robert Kirkman felt that Rick was [...] "smart {{enough to know that}} the kid's either his or Shane's and there may not be any way of ever finding out that definitively." [...] He continued: [...] "Bringing that up to his wife, who he loves, is only going to be painful for her. I think that’s him being <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>husband</b> and him showing his tremendous leadership ability in that he can put his self aside for the betterment of someone else." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then why not {{use those}} {{measures}} you spoke of?" [...] De Brensault said eagerly. [...] "I shall make Jeanne <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>husband,</b> I assure you. I shall promise you that in a fortnight's time she will be only too delighted with her lot." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr Brandon's spirits {{began to}} rise. This {{did not look}} quite like desertion. [...] "I have no doubt you have <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>husband.</b> I am sure you deserve such a one," [...] he said with {{the air of a}} father, and the purpose of a lawyer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Gar'ner {{will make}} <b>a</b> right <b>good</b> <b>husband</b> for any young woman, and I do {{advise you to}} have him. You are my brother's da'ghter, Mary, and I give you this advice, which I should give you all the same, had you been my own child, instead of his'n." ...|$|R
500|$|According to Horner, [...] "In 1896, as {{the country}} was mired in an {{economic}} slowdown that affected millions, a real, substantive policy debate was conducted by candidates who believed firmly in their respective positions." [...] Bryan, whose campaign was ill-financed, felt that his best means of persuading the voter of his position was personal communication, and embarked on an unprecedented itinerary of whistle stop appearances by train. [...] If the train passed any large group of homes and did not stop for Bryan to speak, it would at least disgorge a bundle of political tracts for local distribution. [...] McKinley felt he could not match Bryan's speaking tour, as the Democrat was a better stump speaker. [...] Despite Hanna's urgings to the candidate {{to get on the}} road, the former governor decided on a front porch campaign; he would remain at home in Canton and allow the people to come to him. [...] As McKinley's wife, Ida, was an invalid, this also boosted his image as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>husband.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Greg Daniels and {{directed}} by Carlos Baeza. It was the second script Daniels wrote for the show. He thought the staff had previously done many episodes where Homer [...] "wasn't good at anything", so he {{tried to figure out}} something Homer was really good at, and he {{came up with the idea}} of Homer being <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>husband.</b> While Bart had been the star of the show during the early years, by Season 5, the focus had clearly shifted to Homer. Writer/showrunner Al Jean stated that because Homer is an adult character, he has more depth to him and thus storyline possibilities. Showrunner David Mirkin commented: [...] "Bart, to write him accurately as a child, he can only have so much depth at a certain age. With Homer, we try to explore all levels of adulthood. There are just more places to go. Writing Homer properly is the trick, he's our main rock of the whole series. Homer's IQ is fairly flexible, he won't necessarily understand how to open a door at some point, but he can name the Supreme Court justices. Finding that balance is key to making the show work and making it surprising and making it believable and emotionally grounded." [...] Mirkin was very fond of the fact that Homer and Marge have the biggest fight they have ever had on the show in the episode, and he thought it was a [...] "really great" [...] exploration of their marriage. He noticed that because Homer is thrown out of the house, the audience really worry about their relationship. Mirkin had been asked many times why Marge and Homer are still together, to which he replied that all people stay together even if they argue, [...] "there's some sort of connection".|$|E
2500|$|Friends {{later said}} that Whitman {{had told them}} about {{striking}} his wife on two occasions. They said that Whitman despised himself for this and confessed to being [...] "mortally afraid of being like his father." [...] Whitman lamented his actions in his journal, and resolved to be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>husband</b> and not abusive as his father had been.|$|E
50|$|Because of his naïvety and unfaithfulness, he and Xia Xiong's {{marriage}} ended years ago, but {{he still}} has feelings for her as demonstrated by his interference with Xia Xiong's dates. Even though he was not <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>husband,</b> he is <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> father, and will do anything in his capacity to protect his family.|$|R

60|$|The good woman, being sadly frightened, {{gave him}} all she had: for this Ogre was <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>husband,</b> though {{he used to}} eat up little children. Little Thumb, having thus got all the Ogre's money, came home to his father's house, where he was {{received}} with abundance of joy.|$|R
2500|$|Nancy {{encourages}} him to sink {{under the}} water again and to show her how he did it. Charlie again refuses and turns the conversation to her. He tells {{her that she was}} a good wife. Nancy says the same about him, listing the many ways in which he was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>husband.</b> When she is done, she is bitter because the [...] "good life" [...] they have had seems limited to her. Charlie is hurt by her attitude. They argue. Nancy is still angry that his only interest is to rest, while she wants to experience new things.|$|E
2500|$|Marcella {{belonged to}} the {{generation}} whose childhood was marred by {{the violence of the}} civil wars of the Roman Republic. Her first marriage took place to Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa in 28 BC. [...] She was his second wife. Augustus held Agrippa in the highest place of honor. Agrippa was a military man loyal to Octavian throughout the civil war. The marriage of Marcella and Agrippa probably occurred because of the strong bond between the two men. Marcella brought Agrippa a tie to an elite republican family and to Augustus himself, for she was Augustus's niece. Although Agrippa was older than Marcella but austere, he appeared to be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>husband</b> to Marcella.|$|E
2500|$|Marriage {{is one of}} {{the major}} themes in Middlemarch as, {{according}} to the critic Francis George Steiner, [...] "both principal plots [...] are case studies of unsuccessful marriage". Within this account is the suggestion that the lives of Dorothea and Lydgate are unfulfilled because of these [...] "disastrous marriages". This is arguably more the case for Lydgate than for Dorothea, who obtains a second chance through her eventual marriage to Will Ladislaw; however, a favourable interpretation of this marriage is dependent upon the character of Ladislaw himself, whom numerous critics have viewed as Dorothea's inferior. In addition to these marriages there is the [...] "meaningless and blissful" [...] marriage of Dorothea's sister Celia Brooke to Sir James Chettam and, more significantly, Fred Vincy's courting of Mary Garth; in this latter story, Mary Garth will not accept Fred until he abandons the Church and settles on a more suitable career. In this regard, Fred resembles Henry Fielding's character Tom Jones, both characters being moulded into <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>husband</b> by the love they give to and receive from a woman.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Savine merely nodded, {{and dipped}} her needle {{somewhat}} blindly into the embroidery {{on her knee}} before she replied: [...] "I had guessed it already. You missed <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>husband,</b> my dear. I don't want to force your confidence, but I imagine that you have some distress to bear, and I might help you. I have seen <b>a</b> <b>good</b> deal of trouble in my time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “They don’t believe it. The duty of an American {{husband and}} father is to keep them going. If he asks them how, that’s his own affair. So by way of not being mean, of being <b>a</b> <b>good</b> American <b>husband</b> and father, poor Ruck stands staring at bankruptcy.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is nothing}} to be afraid of in marrying me," [...] he answered. [...] "I should make you <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>husband.</b> Some day you would be rich, very rich indeed.

6000|$|... "Oh, if {{she took}} the wrong man!" [...] said Mrs. Cadwallader, {{who was in a}} decidedly wicked mood. [...] "Marriage is always bad then, first or second. Priority is a poor {{recommendation}} in a husband if he has got no other. I would rather have <b>a</b> <b>good</b> second <b>husband</b> than <b>an</b> indifferent first." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why don't you say you'd have <b>a</b> splendid, wise, <b>good</b> <b>husband</b> {{and some}} angelic little children? You know your castle wouldn't be perfect without," [...] said blunt Jo, {{who had no}} tender fancies yet, and rather scorned romance, except in books.|$|R

5000|$|Manley also {{described}} {{his pursuit of}} two mistresses, and Skipworth's philandering led to him living apart from his wife {{on at least one}} occasion. In 1707, Isabella Wentworth, a Lady of the Bedchamber to Queen Anne, wrote privately of his return: [...] "Sir Thomas Skippoth has turned out his hoar, and is grown <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>husband,</b> his lady lives with him hear...I sopose he wants money and soe weedles her." ...|$|R
60|$|LADY BRITOMART. Oh, Adolphus Cusins {{will make}} <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>husband.</b> After all, nobody can {{say a word}} against Greek: it stamps a man at once as an educated gentleman.

Let snobbish people say what they please: Barbara shall marry, not the man they like, but the man I like.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hate the}} way you talk about your married life, Harry," [...] said Basil Hallward, strolling towards the door that led into the garden. [...] "I believe that you are really <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>husband,</b> but that you are {{thoroughly}} ashamed of your own virtues. You are an extraordinary fellow. You never say a moral thing, and you never do a wrong thing. Your cynicism is simply a pose." ...|$|R
