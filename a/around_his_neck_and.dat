5|$|After {{four minutes}} of deliberation, the jury's foreman {{announced}} a guilty verdict and {{a sentence of}} death. The trial lasted about one hour. Court officers approached Washington to escort him away, but were pushed aside by a surge of spectators, who seized Washington and dragged him outside. Washington initially fought back, biting one man, but was soon beaten. A chain was placed <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> he was dragged toward city hall by a growing mob; on the way downtown, he was stripped, stabbed, and repeatedly beaten with blunt objects. By the time he arrived at city hall, a group had prepared wood for a bonfire next to a tree {{in front of the}} building. Washington, semiconscious and covered in blood, was doused with oil, hung from the tree by a chain, and then lowered to the ground. Members of the crowd cut off his fingers, toes, and genitals. The fire was lit and Washington was repeatedly raised and lowered into the flames until he burned to death. German scholar Manfred Berg posits that the executioners attempted to keep him alive to increase his suffering. Washington attempted to climb the chain, but was unable to, owing to his lack of fingers. The fire was extinguished after two hours, allowing bystanders to collect souvenirs from the site of the lynching, including Washington's bones and links of the chain. One attendee kept part of Washington's genitalia; a group of children snapped the teeth out of Washington's head to sell as souvenirs. By the time that the fire was extinguished, parts of Washington's arms and legs had been burned off and his torso and head were charred. His body was removed from the tree and dragged behind a horse throughout the town. Washington's remains were transported to Robinson, where they were publicly displayed until a constable obtained the body late in the day and buried it.|$|E
25|$|That night Lavy tied {{his shirt}} <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> around the prison bars, {{then sat down}} until he slowly strangled to death. The {{prisoner}} suicide was discovered at 6 a.m. by a guard. Lavy was taken to University Hospital and declared legally dead at 7am.|$|E
25|$|When Starkad was so {{old that}} he wished to die and his {{eyesight}} was bad, he hung his gold <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> went out to wander. He killed a man who wanted one of his swords and some riders who were contracted to kill Starkad by Hather (Hatherus), Lennius' son.|$|E

25|$|Marlo, Chris and Snoop visit Michael at home. Marlo {{questions}} {{him about}} the ring he is wearing on a chain <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> Michael reports that he took it from someone. Marlo is shocked, as the ring, which he initially took from Old Face Andre {{as part of a}} punishment for his stash house being robbed by Omar, had been stolen from Marlo by Omar several weeks ago in the poker game robbery, and then by Officer Walker from Omar when he was falsely arrested for murder, and then by Michael from Walker when the schoolboys ambushed him and covered him with yellow paint in an alley. Michael offers to give him the ring, unaware of its past, but Marlo allows him to keep it. Dukie descends and offers to ready Bug for school. Marlo tells Michael that he is putting him in charge of Bodie's corner and that he has another task for him. Snoop asks Michael who they killed for him and he reveals that it was Bug's father.|$|E
25|$|Three Israeli commandos were {{captured}}. The first captured soldier, {{the commanding}} officer of the assault team, was abseiling from the helicopter when he was attacked by ten men before his feet hit the deck. He was beaten across his body and head, then picked up and thrown to the lower deck, where he was attacked by a dozen activists. They beat and choked him, removed his bulletproof vest and sidearm and smashed his helmet, and shoved him into a passenger hall below deck. The second soldier {{was surrounded by a}} team of fifteen to twenty activists in two groups. One group attacked him when he landed on the ship's roof. He fired one shot at an activist holding a knife before being subdued. The activists seized his gun and beat him as he attempted to fight them off {{with his back to the}} hull. He was picked up by his arms and legs, and thrown over the hull. He attempted to hang onto the hull with both hands, but was forced to let go when activists beat his hands and pulled him down by his legs. He was then surrounded by another group of activists, stabbed in the stomach and dragged into a lounge while being beaten. A third soldier who was lowered onto the deck saw an activist waiting to attack him with an iron crowbar. After shoving him away, he was attacked by four more activists, one of whom wrapped a chain <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> choked him until he lost consciousness. He was then thrown onto the bridge deck, where he was attacked by about twenty activists, who beat him, cut away his equipment, and dragged him into the lounge. The three soldiers were severely wounded and bleeding heavily. Two of the soldiers had their hands tied, and a third was unconscious and went into convulsions. During their captivity, they were subjected to physical and verbal abuse, and photographed and filmed. One of the soldiers said that he was beaten after he began moving and yelling that one of the soldiers needed a doctor, and another said that he was placed onto a couch, beaten, and threatened that he would be beaten every time he moved. Although radical activists attempted to harm them further, more moderate passengers intervened and protected the soldiers. Two were given water and one with a severe stomach wound was given a gauze pad. Hasan Huseyin Uysal, a Turkish doctor, cleaned the blood off their faces and tended to facial cuts.|$|E

500|$|Morales's unorthodox {{behavior}} {{contrasts with}} the usual manners of dignitaries and other political leaders in Latin America. During speeches he made use of personal stories and anecdotes, and used coca as [...] "a potent political symbol", wearing a coca leaf garland <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> a hat with coca leaves in it when speaking to crowds of supporters. Following his election, he wore striped jumpers rather than the suits typically worn by politicians. It {{became a symbol of}} Morales, with copies of it selling widely in Bolivia.|$|E
500|$|Lennon {{had once}} given Harry a {{collection}} of photos taken in Hamburg, showing Lennon standing on the Reeperbahn reading a newspaper and wearing nothing but his underpants, performing on stage with a toilet seat <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck,</b> <b>and</b> one of McCartney sitting on a toilet. After Epstein became the Beatles' manager, Lennon rushed into Harry's office and asked for them back, saying, [...] "Brian [...] insists I've got to get them back—the pictures, everything you've got. I must take it all with me now." [...] When Epstein finally secured a recording contract with EMI, he sent Harry a telegram from London to the Mersey Beat office to announce the news.|$|E
500|$|Very {{little is}} known about the god B'olon Yokte'. According to an article by Mayanists Markus Eberl and Christian Prager in British Anthropological Reports, his name is {{composed}} of the elements [...] "nine", 'OK-te' (the meaning of which is unknown), and [...] "god". Confusion in classical period inscriptions suggests that the name was already ancient and unfamiliar to contemporary scribes. He also appears in inscriptions from Palenque, Usumacinta, and La Mar as a god of war, conflict, and the underworld. In one stele he is portrayed with a rope tied <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck,</b> <b>and</b> in another with an incense bag, together signifying a sacrifice to end a cycle of years.|$|E
50|$|Henry Wadsworth Longfellow {{attested to}} his macabre streak in an anecdote {{relating}} how at one {{dinner at the}} Webster home, the host amazed his guests by lowering the lights, fitting a noose <b>around</b> <b>his</b> own <b>neck,</b> <b>and</b> lolling <b>his</b> head forward, tongue protruding, over a bowl of blazing chemicals, to give a ghastly imitation of a man being hanged.|$|R

500|$|Catesby survived, albeit scorched. Digby left, {{ostensibly to}} give himself up, as did John Wintour. Thomas Bates fled, along with Robert Wintour. Remaining were Catesby (described as [...] "reasonably well"), Rookwood, the Wright brothers, Percy and John Grant, who had been so badly injured that his eyes were [...] "burnt out". They {{resolved}} {{to stay in the}} house and wait for the arrival of the king's men. Catesby, believing his death to be near, kissed the gold crucifix he wore <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> said he had given everything for [...] "the honour of the Cross". He refused to be taken prisoner, [...] "against that only he would defend himself with his sword".|$|E
500|$|The {{body was}} buried in a coffin and later {{translated}} to Beodericsworth, but Abbo failed to date either events, although from the text {{it can be seen}} that he believed that the relics had been taken to Beodericsworth by the time that Theodred became Bishop of London in around 926. Upon exhumation of the body, a miracle was discovered. All the arrow wounds upon Edmund's corpse had healed and his head was reattached. The only evidence of decapitation was a line <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> his skin was still soft and fresh, as if he had been sleeping. [...] The last recorded inspection of the body whilst at Bury St Edmunds was in 1198.|$|E

50|$|In {{many parts}} of Croatia, Krampus is {{described}} as a devil wearing a cloth sack <b>around</b> <b>his</b> waist <b>and</b> chains <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck,</b> ankles, <b>and</b> wrists. As a part of a tradition, when a child receives a gift from St. Nicholas he is given a golden branch to represent his good deeds throughout the year; however, if the child has misbehaved, Krampus will take the gifts for himself and leave only a silver branch to represent the child's bad acts.|$|R

500|$|Meanwhile, news of {{the advance}} of the Byzantine army soon reached Antioch. Realising {{that he had no}} hope of {{defeating}} Manuel, Raynald also knew that he could not expect any help from king Baldwin III of Jerusalem. Baldwin did not approve of Raynald's attack on Cyprus, and in any case had already made an agreement with Manuel. Thus isolated and abandoned by his allies, Raynald decided that abject submission was his only hope. He appeared before the Emperor, dressed in a sack with a rope tied <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck,</b> <b>and</b> begged for forgiveness. Manuel at first ignored the prostrate Raynald, chatting with his courtiers; William of Tyre commented that this ignominious scene continued for so long that all present were [...] "disgusted" [...] by it.* William of Tyre, Historia, XVIII, [...] Eventually, Manuel forgave Raynald on condition that he would become a vassal of the Empire, effectively surrendering the independence of Antioch to Byzantium.|$|E
500|$|In early July 1955, Hensley began {{a series}} of {{meetings}} near Altha, Florida. He conducted the meetings without snakes for three weeks, before procuring a [...] snake and bringing it to a Sunday afternoon service on July 24. Several dozen people gathered at an abandoned blacksmith shop for the observance. During the service, Hensley loudly delivered a sermon on the topic of faith. He removed the snake from the lard can in which it was stored, wrapped it <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck,</b> <b>and</b> rubbed it on his face. He walked around the audience while preaching and then returned the snake to the can. As he placed the snake into the can, it bit him on his wrist. After a few minutes, Hensley became visibly ill, experiencing severe pain, a discolored arm, and hematemesis. He refused medical attention, although he remained in pain and was urged to seek treatment both by congregants and the Calhoun County Sheriff. One eyewitness claimed that Hensley attributed his suffering to the congregation's lack of faith, although his wife Sally stated that she believed it was the will of God. Hensley died early the next morning. Calhoun County Judge Hannah Gaskin ruled his death a suicide.|$|E
500|$|Morrison and EMI {{producer}} Norman Smith negotiated Pink Floyd's first recording contract, {{and as part}} of the deal, {{the band}} agreed to record their first album at EMI Studios in London. Mason recalled that the sessions were trouble-free. Smith disagreed, stating that Barrett was unresponsive to his suggestions and constructive criticism. EMI-Columbia released The Piper at the Gates of Dawn in August 1967. The album peaked at number 6, spending 14 weeks on the UK charts. One month later, it was released under the Tower Records label. Pink Floyd continued to draw large crowds at the UFO Club; however, Barrett's mental breakdown was by then causing serious concern. The group initially hoped that his erratic behaviour would be a passing phase, but some were less optimistic, including Jenner and his assistant, June Child, who commented: [...] "I found [...] in the dressing room and he was so... gone. Roger Waters and I got him on his feet, [...] we got him out to the stage... The band started to play and Syd just stood there. He had his guitar <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> his arms just hanging down".|$|E
5000|$|In 2012-13 {{he played}} Cassius in Greg Doran's Royal Shakespeare Company {{production}} of Julius Caesar in Stratford upon Avon, London and New York, where in his New York Times review Ben Brantley said of Nri, [...] "Mr. Nri’s expression as he registers Caesar’s words {{is that of}} a man who feels a noose tightening <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck.</b> Wary <b>and</b> sly, scared and manipulative, Mr. Nri is an excellent Cassius, capturing the climate of paranoia and politicking that thickens the air." ...|$|R

25|$|The {{best known}} {{expedition}} {{was that of}} Tore Hund (Tore Dog) who together with some friends, arrived in Bjarmaland in 1026. They started to trade with the inhabitants and bought a great many pelts, whereupon they pretended to leave. Later, they made shore in secret, and plundered the burial site, where the Bjarmians had erected an idol of their god Jomali. This god had a bowl containing silver on his knees, and a valuable chain <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck.</b> Tore <b>and</b> <b>his</b> men managed {{to escape from the}} pursuing Bjarmians with their rich booty.|$|R
500|$|On 1 March he was {{promoted}} to Generalmajor, and five days later he became the 205th recipient of the Oak Leaves to the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, in recognition of his outstanding commitment as the commander of the 25th Panzergrenadier Regiment during winter 1942–43. Of modest habits, Mickl had rarely worn the Knight's Cross itself, usually wearing only the ribbon <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck,</b> <b>and</b> now he merely added the Oak Leaves device to the ribbon. During his time in the Führerreserve, he also had the opportunity to meet with his mentor Rommel, now a Generalfeldmarschall, and he also attended a course for divisional commanders, which he referred to as a [...] "fool's course". In early May, Mickl was summoned to Berlin and advised that he was to be entrusted with the command of the 11th Panzer Division during the absence of Generalleutnant Dietrich von Choltitz, who had been suffering with heart problems. Despite the good news of being appointed to a divisional command, Mickl expressed his disappointment that he was being allocated a division in need of re-organisation, rather than a fully equipped and full-strength modern division.|$|E
500|$|The entire {{series was}} shot on sound stages. Production {{designers}} Greg Loewen and Graemay Murray designed the medical facility as a [...] "circular hub with offices and rooms radiating outward", and included a second floor in which DeMilla could oversee the entire hospital's operations. Director Joe Napolitano praised the sets while filming the episode [...] "Last Resort", calling the show [...] "a good candy store for a director" [...] {{due to the}} functionality {{and size of the}} hospital. He explained that the set enabled him to direct long takes and walk and talk sequences without much difficulty. The series required extensive prosthetic work for Dr. Batung and the non-human patients. The application of Lund's prosthetic makeup required several hours each day that he was filmed. Napolitano said that he found this to be a challenge to the production schedule, explaining that there would be discussions about the amount of prosthetics necessary for Batung depending on the scene. Batung's prosthetic work included a tail that wrapped <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> shoulders; Lund was pushed around the set on a sled to mimic the character's movements as a slug. Napolitano also specified that the patients required a similar amount of time and work for their prosthetic makeup, such as a man who has gills under his chin.|$|E
500|$|When {{developing}} Advent Children, Nomura {{stated that}} because of the comparisons between Barret's original design and Mr. T, they decided to take it in a different direction for the film, implementing co-director Takeshi Nozue's suggestion to give him cornrows for his hair, while Nomura designed his face. Artist Yusuke Naora influenced the design as well, developing his attire, which originally consisted of white overalls, before instead having him wear him a down vest. Barret's arm tattoo was changed as well, although it retained the [...] "skull and fire" [...] motif of the original. Other aspects of his design included the loss of the metal bands around his body, a white sleeve extending from the middle of his right forearm to his elbow fastened by straps, a black band on his left forearm surrounded by a pink string and bow, and a fishnet shirt that ends in torn fibers below his waist. The dog tags were altered to a bullet and medallion supported by a chain <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck,</b> <b>and</b> three rings covered his left hand. His Gimmick Arm was modified into a robotic prosthetic hand, developed by Nomura, with the only guideline being [...] "a huge, over-the-top gun that transforms in a huge, over-the-top way." [...] Nozue stated that these specifics made it difficult to work with, and decided to conceal the hand's transformation sequence into the gun as much as possible. His Advent Children design was also planned to be used for the Final Fantasy VII remake. However, the staff later decided to give every character in the party a new look.|$|E
