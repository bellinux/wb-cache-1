5|$|In the past, the Hebrides {{as a whole}} were {{a strong}} Scottish Gaelic-speaking area, and in 1921 more than 50% of the populations of most of these islands, {{including}} Skye, Mull and Islay, were proficient in the language.

To amuse themselves the creatures play shinty when the skies are clear and bright at night. They are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> and converse with mariners and are especially vocal when soaking vessels with water spray, roaring with laughter as vessels capsize.|$|E

On the other hand, Vietnamese that live in predominantly Khmer-speaking neighbourhoods send their children to public schools, and as a result the children are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> Khmer fluently but show very limited understanding of Vietnamese.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from their}} blue colour, the mythical creatures {{look much like}} humans, and {{are about the same}} size.

They are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak,</b> and when a group approaches a ship its chief may shout two lines of poetry to the master of the vessel and challenge him to complete the verse. If the skipper fails in that task then the blue men will attempt to overturn the ship and capsize it.|$|E

5|$|Because of his stammer, Albert dreaded public speaking. After {{his closing}} {{speech at the}} British Empire Exhibition at Wembley on 31 October 1925, one which was an ordeal for both him and his listeners, he began to see Lionel Logue, an Australian-born speech therapist. The Duke and Logue practised {{breathing}} exercises, and the Duchess rehearsed with him patiently. Subsequently, he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> with less hesitation. With his delivery improved, the Duke opened the new Parliament House in Canberra, Australia, during {{a tour of the}} empire in 1927. His journey by sea to Australia, New Zealand and Fiji took him via Jamaica, where Albert played doubles tennis partnered with a black man, Bertrand Clark, which was unusual at the time and taken locally as a display of equality between races.|$|E
5|$|Beside {{being the}} capital city of Sarawak, Kuching became a {{business}} and cultural centre for the Malays of Sarawak. The dialect of Malay spoken in Kuching is known as Bahasa Sarawak (Sarawakian Malay Language), which is a subset of the Malay language. The dialect used in Kuching is a little different from the dialect used in Miri. Since the second largest population in the city is made up of Han Chinese, the Chinese language is also commonly used, particularly Hokkien, Hakka and Mandarin Chinese. Almost all residents are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> English. A number of special private schools that teach English for expatriates child can be found through the city.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1930s, Wijnhamer, known as PahWongso, was {{recognised}} in West Java for his promotion of social causes.

In conveying his messages he often used the Sundanese wayang golek (a form of rod puppet), as the local people were generally unable to read. He was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> Dutch, Malay, and Javanese fluently, and had some command of Chinese and Japanese. This social work was funded predominantly from PahWongso's day job, selling fried peanuts (kacang goreng).|$|E

5|$|Due to {{his age and}} ill health, Brown was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> {{only once}} per week. At a {{campaign}} event in Madisonville, he challenged Goebel to a debate, but Goebel ignored the challenge. Brown, and other speakers enlisted {{on behalf of his}} campaign, frequently called attention to Goebel's refusal to acknowledge the challenge or agree to a debate. When William Jennings Bryan came to the state to campaign with Goebel, Brown sent him a letter challenging him to repudiate Goebel's nomination because of the broken agreement between Goebel and Stone. Bryan refused to comment on the events of the convention and stressed the importance of party loyalty. He denounced the Honest Election League's convention as irregular and invalid.|$|E
