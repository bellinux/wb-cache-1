40|$|SUMMARY Vigabatrin (y-vinyl GABA) {{is a new}} <b>anticonvulsive</b> <b>drug</b> that irreversibly {{inhibits}} {{the activity}} ofGABA transaminase. The effect ofvigabatrin on neurotransmission-related amino acids in CSF of 28 epileptic patients was studied {{and the relationship between}} the amino acid pattern and clinical response during 7 months ofadministration ofvigabatrin. Of this study population, 46 % had more than 50 % decrease in seizure frequency (responders). In 54 % the seizures decreased less than 50 % (nonresponders). In the whole study group, the levels of total GABA during vigabatrin treatment were 283 %, free GABA 197 %, homocarnosine 310 % and glycine 128 % that ofthe levels at baseline in the same patients. Glutamate, glutamine, aspartate, asparagine, and taurine concentra-tions did not change. The amino acid pattern in CSF during administration of vigabatrin did not differ significantly in responders and nonresponders. The study suggests that both GABAergic and glycinergic neurotransmission are affected by vigabatrin. The changes in CSF levels of neurotrans-mitter amino acids are, however, not necessarily related to the clinical response.

Pharmacol., 2001, 53, 81 – 82. Prolonged seizures may alter the brain function in numerous ways. It {{is conceivable that}} they might lead to modifications of seizure susceptibility or <b>anticonvulsive</b> <b>drug</b> efficacy, however, only limited data address this issue. Therefore, we have decided to estimate the antiepileptic activity of drugs interfering with GABA-ergic neurotransmission in mice subjected to prolonged clonic seizures 2 weeks before, using pentetrazol test. The activity of valproate, but not diazepam or phenobarbital, was diminished in animals following repetitive clonic seizures. It might be hypothesized that in humans suffering from epilepsy, prolonged seizures in the past might contribute to the lowered efficacy of valproic acid later on. Key words: prolonged seizures, antiepileptic drugs, valproate, phenobarbital, diazepam correspondence G. Haberek, T. Tomczyk, E. M.

Since other aetiologic causes of chorea were excluded, acutely occurring chorea in the patient {{was thought to be}} related with valproate usage because of persistence of choreiform movements for days without any fluctuation. Valproate was stopped slowly and lamotrigine was added at a dose of 400 mg/day. Within a two-month period after cessation of the valproate, choreiform movements had disappeared.

The concentrations of each pharmaceutical compound were determined in raw sewage, effluent and sewage sludge samples by LC-MS/MS analysis. The occurrence of antidepressant by-products formed in treated effluent after ozonation was also investigated. Results Current primary treatments using physical and chemical processes removed little of the compounds (mean removal efficiency: 19 %). Experimental sorption coefficients (K d) of each studied compounds were also calculated. Sorption of venlafaxine, desmethylvenlafaxine, and carbamazepine on sludge {{was assumed to be}} negligible (log K d ≤ 2), but higher sorption behavior can be expected for sertraline (log K d ≥ 4). Ozonation treatment with O 3 (5 mg/L) led to a satisfactory mean removal efficiency of 88 % of the compounds. Screening of the final ozone-treated effluent samples by high resolution-mass spectrometry (LC-QqToFMS) did confirm the presence of related N -oxide by-products. Conclusion Effluent ozonation led to higher mean removal efficiencies than current primary treatment, and therefore represented a promising strategy for the elimination of antidepressants in urban wastewaters.

SE was controlled in all patients by the given combination of drugs; application of further antiepileptic medications after ivLEV was necessary in two episodes. No severe side effects occurred. Our data suggest that ivLEV may be an alternative for the treatment of SE in the future, even in patients that did not respond to benzodiazepines. A large prospective...|$|R
30|$|Results: Sixty-one {{patients}} (74 % males 26 % females + age— 56  years [16  +  92] (median [percentiles 25, 75]) {{were included}} in this study. Patients were chronic alcoholics (41 %) and drug users (16 %). The following <b>anticonvulsive</b> <b>drugs</b> were administered—levetiracetam (N =  46, 75 %), fosphenytoine (N =  40, 66 %), clonazepam (N =  37, 61 %), clobazam (N =  28, 46 %), midazolam (N =  22, 36 %), valproic acid (N =  10, 16 %), carbamazepine (N =  7, 12 %) and phenobarbital (N =  7, 12 %). Among the 46 61 patients (77 %) treated with a CYP inducer, 26 patients (63 %) received at least one drug with liver metabolism of which plasma concentrations might have been altered by such potential drug–drug interactions, thus representing 43 % of the SE patients admitted to the ICU. Drugs at risk of pharmacokinetic alterations were cardiovascular, metabolic and psychotropic drugs.|$|R
40|$|Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) is a {{potentially}} life-threatening, complex, and multifaceted disease which may imitate other grave conditions. It presents with cutaneous drug eruptions, fever, hematologic abnormalities (an eosinophil count of 1500 /mm 3 or atypical lymphocytosis), and systemic involvement including hematologic, renal, pulmonary, hepatic, cardiac, gastrointestinal, neurologic, and endocrine abnormalities. Anticonvulsant therapies (mainly carbamazepine) {{are among the}} most important causative drugs. Case report: Herein we present a 10 -year-old girl who developed skin rash, systemic symptoms, marked eosinophilia, and kidney involvement following anticonvulsive treatment with phenobarbital and sodium valproate. She experienced multiple hospitalizations due to an improper diagnosis and management. Conclusion: Drug Induced Hypersensitivity Syndrome (DIHS) is a severe life-threatening disorder which mostly occurs due to aromatic <b>anticonvulsive</b> <b>drugs.</b> The disease may mimic other serious conditions and delay in the diagnosis and improper treatment may cause organ involvement and more severe outcomes...|$|R
