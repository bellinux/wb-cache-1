5|$|In June 1938, the Soviet Reaction-Engine Scientific Research Institute (RNII) in Moscow was {{authorized}} by the Main Artillery Directorate (GAU) to develop a multiple rocket launcher for the RS-132 <b>aircraft</b> <b>rocket</b> (RS for , 'rocket-powered shell'). I. Gvay led a design team in Chelyabinsk, Russia, which built several prototype launchers firing the modified 132mm M-132 rockets over the sides of ZiS-5 trucks. These proved unstable, and V.N. Galkovskiy proposed mounting the launch rails longitudinally. In August 1939, {{the result was the}} BM-13 (BM stands for Боевая Mашина (translit. Boyevaya Mashina), 'combat vehicle' for M-13 rockets).|$|E
25|$|The Bombardment <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Rocket,</b> {{also known}} as BOAR, the Bureau of Ordnance <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Rocket,</b> and officially as the 30.5-Inch Rocket, Mark 1, Mod 0, was an unguided air-to-surface rocket {{developed}} by the United States Navy's Naval Ordnance Test Station during the 1950s. Intended to provide a standoff nuclear capability for carrier-based aircraft, the rocket entered operational service in 1956, remaining in service until 1963.|$|E
25|$|The {{propulsion}} system {{was intended to}} be a liquid-fueled, dual-thrust rocket, using hypergolic, storable propellants.

25|$|The RAM, {{also known}} as the 6.5-Inch Anti-Tank <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Rocket</b> or ATAR, was an {{air-to-ground}} rocket used by the United States Navy during the Korean War. Developed rapidly, the rocket proved successful but was phased out shortly {{after the end of the}} conflict.|$|E
25|$|Following development, SCAR entered {{full-scale}} {{production in}} January 1945; by July, fully {{half of the}} U.S. Navy's rocket production for aircraft use consisted of SCAR rockets. SCAR was widely used during {{the latter part of}} World War II as a training round for the FFAR and, later, the High Velocity <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Rocket.</b>|$|E
25|$|Developed by the Naval Ordnance Test Station (NOTS) at China Lake, California {{during the}} mid-to-late 1950s, the Hopi missile was an {{improved}} {{development of the}} earlier BOAR (Bombardment <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Rocket).</b> BOAR had been developed at China Lake as an unguided, nuclear-armed rocket for use by carrier-based aircraft, seeing limited service in the fleet between 1957 and 1963.|$|E

25|$|The 2.25-Inch Sub-Caliber <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Rocket,</b> or SCAR, was an American unguided rocket {{developed}} by the United States Navy during World War II. Capable of simulating the aerial rockets then coming into operational service, the SCAR was used to train pilots {{in the use of}} the new type of weapon, and continued in service throughout the 1950s.|$|E
2500|$|In 1950, the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War resulted in the United States Navy urgently requiring an aircraft-launched rocket that would be effective against enemy tanks, as the existing [...] "Holy Moses" [...] high-velocity <b>aircraft</b> <b>rocket</b> was expected to be ineffective against the armor of IS-3 heavy tanks.|$|E
2500|$|Designated 2.25-Inch Sub-Caliber <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Rocket,</b> the {{resulting}} rocket was a joint project between the Bureau of Ordnance and the National Defense Research Committee. As its name implied, the rocket {{was designed as}} a sub-calibre weapon compared to the FFAR, being only [...] in diameter, but weighted to be ballistically similar to the larger operational weapons. Varying the amount of propellant in the SCAR's motor could produce accurate simulations of either type of FFAR's flight characteristics.|$|E

2500|$|More generally, Corsairs {{performed}} attacks with cannons, napalm tanks, various iron {{bombs and}} unguided rockets. The 5 inch HVAR was a reliable standby; sturdy Soviet-built armor proved {{resistant to the}} HVAR's punch, {{which led to a}} new 6.5in (16.5cm) shaped charge antitank warhead being developed. The result was called the [...] "Anti-Tank <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Rocket</b> (ATAR)." [...] The 11 inch (29.85cm) [...] "Tiny Tim" [...] was also used in combat, with two under the belly.|$|E
2500|$|Officially {{designated}} the 6.5-Inch Anti-Tank <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Rocket</b> (ATAR), and commonly known in service as [...] "RAM", the new rocket {{was rushed to}} the Korean front, being used in combat {{for the first time on}} August 16, 1950. Despite the haste with which the weapon had been developed, the very first shipment included a full set of documentation and firing tables for the use of the rocket. The first 600 rockets were constructed by hand, but a production line was rapidly set up.|$|E
2500|$|The F6F series were {{designed}} to take damage and get the pilot safely back to base. A bullet-resistant windshield {{and a total of}} 212lb (96kg) of cockpit armor was fitted, along with armor around the oil tank and oil cooler. A 250gal (946l) self-sealing fuel tank was fitted in the fuselage. Standard armament on the F6F-3 consisted of six [...]50in (12.7mm) M2/AN Browning air-cooled machine guns with 400 rounds per gun. A center-section hardpoint under the fuselage could carry a single 150gal (568l) disposable drop tank, while later aircraft had single bomb racks installed under each wing, inboard of the undercarriage bays; with these and the center-section hard point late model F6F-3s could carry a total bomb-load in excess of 2,000lb (900kg). Six 5in (127mm) HVARs (High Velocity <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Rocket)</b> could be carried; three under each wing on [...] "zero-length" [...] launchers.|$|E
25|$|With the {{introduction}} of the 3.5-Inch and 5-Inch Forward Firing <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Rockets,</b> a need arose to train aircraft pilots in the proper tactics {{for the use of the}} new weapons. This requirement resulted in the development of a dedicated training rocket by the U.S. Navy.|$|R

2500|$|At the Bureau of Ordnance, Sides nurtured {{a number}} of early rocket projects, often against {{high-level}} institutional opposition. One notable success was the High velocity <b>aircraft</b> <b>rocket</b> (HVAR), a 5-inch air-to-ground rocket {{that was used in}} Europe against trucks and tanks and was being produced at the rate of 40,000 per day {{by the end of the}} war. [...] "He was a real pioneer of the Navy rocket programs," [...] recalled Thomas F. Dixon, HVAR project officer under Sides' supervision and later chief designer of the engines for the Atlas, Thor, Jupiter, Redstone, and Saturn rockets. [...] "All the way through it was a fight with the admirals. Caltech's professor of physics, Dr. Charles Lauritsen, had developed a barrage rocket - ideal for landings to clean up the banks. When we brought this to the Chief of the Bureau of Ordnance, however, his general reaction was, 'Don't put rockets on my battleships, cruisers, or destroyers.'" ...|$|E
