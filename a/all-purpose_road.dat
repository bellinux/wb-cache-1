25|$|A {{bypass road}} for Ormskirk and Burscough {{respectively}} was first proposed {{as part of}} James Drake's 1949 Road Plan for Lancashire, described as an <b>all-purpose</b> <b>road</b> but later {{considered to be a}} potential motorway by 1958 and given the designation of A59(M). By 1963, Lancashire County Council had dropped the plans for a motorway of this nature, instead deciding to focus later efforts during the mid-1970s on proposing a scheme to improve the A59 link between Liverpool and Preston. This proposal was at the time considered to potentially become the M59 Motorway, with investigations into all practical options being considered, however the motorway was ultimately never constructed. A map published by Lancashire County Council and dated 1974 shows the suggested route of the motorway, starting at the missing M58 motorway junction 2 and continuing north-bound towards Blackpool along the alignment of the A59.|$|E
500|$|The design {{capacity}} is 135,000 vehicles per day, {{but in practice}} the crossing carries around 160,000. It {{has been described by}} the Highways Agency as [...] "a vital transport link for the national and South East economies", by the former Secretary of State for Transport, Patrick McLoughlin, as [...] "a crucial part of the countryâ€™s strategic road network", and by the local Thurrock Council as [...] "one of Europe's most heavily used crossings and complex traffic management systems". It is signed as a major destination on London's orbital route, the M25, though the crossing and its approach road are an <b>all-purpose</b> <b>road</b> (the A282), allowing traffic prohibited from motorways to use it. Southbound traffic crosses the four-lane bridge, while northbound traffic uses both of the two-lane road tunnels. The bridge can be closed due to high winds or maintenance. On these occasions, traffic uses the tunnels in both directions.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2008, {{when the}} A74 {{was still an}} <b>all-purpose</b> <b>road</b> across the Cumberland Gap, the Highways Agency took out a special order to ban cyclists and {{pedestrians}} from the route, advising them to use the A7 to Longtown instead. Despite warning signs for cyclists being erected, traffic officer Glenn Lamont still found that [...] "some cyclists are ignoring this and with the roadworks and contra flow in place there is a really high risk of an accident".|$|E

50|$|The {{two major}} {{motoring}} organisations at the time, The Automobile Association and the R.A.C. welcomed {{the maximum speed}} limits for <b>all-purpose</b> <b>roads,</b> but the R.A.C. would have preferred more flexibility for motorways. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents suggested that a lower speed limit would be more appropriate for <b>all-purpose</b> <b>roads</b> and the Pedestrian's Association for Road Safety condemned the new limits as being too high, preferring 60 mph limits for all roads. Castle's decision and acceptance of the RRL research at face value was controversial. Peter Walker's motion in Parliament to annul the speed limit on motorways was negatived.|$|R
2500|$|The road {{received}} a substantial upgrade {{in the early}} 19th century {{under the direction of}} Thomas Telford, who made significant engineering improvements, including a new route over the Beattock Summit and the Metal Bridge just in England just south of the border. Engineering improvements continued throughout the century and into the 20th, and it {{became one of the first}} trunk roads in Britain in 1936. From the 1960s the road started to be replaced by a parallel motorway. The last remaining section of <b>all-purpose</b> <b>road</b> on Telford's original alignment, the so-called [...] "Cumberland Gap" [...] between Carlisle and Metal Bridge, was replaced by a motorway in 2008 after years of delays due to a breakdown in discussions between the English and Scottish parliaments.|$|E

Since then, an <b>all-purpose</b> <b>road</b> from Cheshunt by-passes these towns. The Kingsmead Viaduct takes the A10 high over the Lea Valley between Hertford and Ware and the Hertford East Branch Line railway.|$|E

50|$|The department, {{seeing the}} {{successful}} early {{results of this}} work then appointed another committee, under the chairmanship of Sir Walter Worboys and again using Kinneir and Calvert as designers, to look at Traffic Signs for <b>All-Purpose</b> <b>Roads.</b> Work for this also resulted in {{the introduction of the}} pictogram signs based on those recommended by the 1949 United Nations World Conference on Road and Motor Transport.|$|R
2500|$|Directional signs ("guide signs" [...] in American parlance) {{have not}} been {{harmonized}} under the Convention, at least not on ordinary roads. As a result, there are substantial differences in directional signage throughout Europe. Differences apply to the choice of typeface, arrows and, most notably, colours. The convention does, however, specify {{that the type of}} directional signage used should, for each country, distinguish limited-access roads ("motorways") from ordinary, <b>all-purpose</b> <b>roads.</b>|$|R

50|$|A special road is the {{official}} classification of motorways in the United Kingdom. For a road to become a special road, it must have a Statutory Instrument sanctioned under the Highways Act 1980. A road {{which is not a}} special road is termed an <b>all-purpose</b> <b>road.</b> The vast majority of the roads in the UK are all-purpose roads. Most special roads are motorways.|$|E
5000|$|According to the {{statutory}} instrument that authorised its construction, {{the road is}} officially classified as a 'special link road to connect the roundabout with the <b>all-purpose</b> <b>road</b> known as Tramway Lane'. [...] According to Lancashire County Council, it is the 'M61 Link Tramway Lane to Junction 9' and {{is part of the}} M61. [...] In 2007, the approach signs from Walton Summit were modified to read 'M61', but the signs still mark the roundabout at the eastern end.|$|E

2500|$|Traffic signing in the UK {{conforms}} broadly to European norms, {{though a}} number of signs are unique to Britain and direction signs omit European route numbers. The current sign system, introduced on 1 January 1965, {{was developed in the}} late 1950s and early 1960s by the Anderson Committee, which established the motorway signing system, and by the Worboys Committee, which reformed signing for existing <b>all-purpose</b> <b>roads.</b> (For illustrations of most British road signs, see 'Know your traffic signs' on the GOV.UK website.) ...|$|R
50|$|In addition, a {{small number}} of non-motorway special roads are {{relatively}} newly built dual-carriageway roads, such as the A1 Dual Carriageway east of Edinburgh and parts of the A720 Edinburgh bypass, or parts of the A55 in North Wales. These particular roads have many of the same regulations as motorways, apart from the speed limit regulations, since that only applies to special roads which are also motorways. The usual speed limit regulations that apply to <b>all-purpose</b> <b>roads</b> do not apply to special roads, so a non-motorway special road must define a speed limit as part of its Statutory Instrument.|$|R

50|$|Signage on Irish HQDCs {{is similar}} to signage used on Irish motorways, and {{junction}} numbers may be present (as on motorways, indicated by a white number on a black panel {{in the corner of}} signs). However signage on HQDCs uses a green background instead of the blue background used on Irish motorway signage. In the event of an HQDC being a regional road, black text on a white background would be used instead. Also, as on other <b>all-purpose</b> <b>roads,</b> signs should include patches for roads of other classifications (on motorways, all information signage should have a blue background).|$|R
50|$|As {{high-quality}} dual carriageways are not motorways, they do {{not need}} to conform to motorway regulations, therefore slow-moving vehicles (e.g. tractors, farm vehicles etc.) as well as cyclists are permitted to use these roads. HQDCs have a hard shoulder marked with a broken yellow line (as is standard on Irish roads), rather than the solid yellow line used to mark the hard shoulder of an Irish motorway. Also, L-Drivers (Learner Drivers), who are not permitted to drive on motorways can do so on high-quality dual carriageways, as {{on the rest of the}} national road network. HQDCs are a road type, not a classification, and the normal rules and regulations applying to <b>all-purpose</b> <b>roads</b> apply on HQDCs.|$|R
5000|$|The Motorway font is {{also used}} in Ireland. Its use is {{slightly}} different from that in the UK - in the Republic, motorway route numbers are always in Motorway font, whether the sign is on a motorway or not. In addition, on signs erected before 2009, route numbers for <b>all-purpose</b> <b>roads</b> on motorway signs were in Transport font. On signs erected since 2009, all route numbers on motorways are now in motorway font, bringing Ireland closer to the UK practice (however, as Motorway font has not previously featured the letters [...] "R" [...] and [...] "L", these letters still appear in Transport). As in the UK, all other text on road signs appears in Transport font.|$|R
5000|$|The 6 m {{width of}} the busway is {{narrower}} than the 9.3 m width of a single-carriageway rural <b>all-purpose</b> <b>road</b> built to 2009 standards (excluding attendant verges and footpaths/cyclepaths in both cases). A conventional road {{would have been too}} wide to fit on top of existing railway embankments and across the under-bridges along parts of the route. [...] The maintenance track is either adjacent to the busway on flat land, or to one side {{at the foot of the}} former railway embankmentsâ€”the combined {{width of the}} maintenance track and the busway being considerably wider than that of the railway it had replaced. To negotiate Trumpington Cutting on the southern section, a narrower maintenance track was required, along with the use of a bi-directional single track busway in order to fit within the width of the former double-track railway line. [...] The southern section will be restricted to single-decker buses. [...] In May 2012 the County Council received a petition calling for better night-time lighting for the bridleway alongside the southern section, and the need for this was subsequently acknowledged by the Council. Work on lighting was completed in autumn 2015.|$|E
5000|$|The UK {{government}} formed another {{committee in}} 1963 to review signage on all British roads. It was chaired by Sir Walter Worboys of Imperial Chemical Industries.The {{result was a}} document that defined traffic signing in Britain: Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions (TSRGD). It was first introduced on 1 January 1965 but has been updated many times since. It is comparable with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices in the United States. The TSRGD is a Statutory Instrument that prescribes the sign faces and permitted variants {{that may be used}} on UK roads.The TSRGD is supported by the Traffic Signs Manual (TSM), which consists of 8 separately-published chapters which provides [...] "the codes to be followed in the use, siting, and illumination of signs both on <b>all-purpose</b> <b>roads</b> and motorways. It also covers temporary signs for use in connection with road works, in emergency by the police, and temporary route signing by motoring organisations and highway authorities." ...|$|R
50|$|In April 2004, Highways Agency Traffic Officers (HATOs) {{began working}} {{alongside}} police on motorways in the West Midlands. The roll-out of traffic officers was completed on 18 July 2006 and they now cover {{all of the}} motorway network within England, i.e. that which is owned or managed by Highways England, {{and some of the}} <b>all-purpose</b> trunk <b>road</b> (APTR) network. The introduction of the officers was aimed to reduce the 25% of delays caused by collisions by around 5%.|$|R
25|$|In England and Wales {{the road}} {{numbering}} system for <b>all-purpose</b> (i.e. non-motorway) <b>roads</b> {{is based on}} a radial pattern centred on London. In Scotland the same scheme is centred on Edinburgh. In both cases the main single-digit roads normally define the zone boundaries. The exception is between Zones 1 and 2, where the River Thames defines the boundary.|$|R
2500|$|The signage system {{currently}} in use {{was developed in}} the late 1950s and the early 1960s by the Anderson Committee, which established the motorway signing system, and by the Worboys Committee, which reformed signing for existing <b>all-purpose</b> (non-motorway) <b>roads.</b> [...] It was introduced in 1965 and is governed by the Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions. Signs may be of an informative, warning or instructional nature. [...] Instructional signs are generally circular, warnings are triangular and informative signs are rectangular or square. [...] Motorway informative signs use white text on a blue background, primary routes are indicated by green directional and distance signs with yellow text, whilst secondary roads use black text on a white background.|$|R
50|$|The Â£57 million {{service is}} based at Quinton, Birmingham and is {{responsible}} for providing accurate, historical, real-time and predictive traffic and incident information to businesses, the travelling public and Highways England's operations. It collects real-time traffic information from over 10,000 fixed sites on the motorway and <b>all-purpose</b> trunk <b>road</b> network from MIDAS and Traffic Monitoring Unit (TMU) electronic loops in the road surface and automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras at the roadside. Additionally it uses anonymous floating vehicle traffic data (FVD) from vehicles to supplement the fixed traffic monitoring sites. NTIS also has access to nearly 2,000 CCTV cameras, 300 weather stations, 4,600 roadside electronic signs, 16,000 roadside electronic matrix signals and incident data from over 250 operational partners including the police and local authorities.|$|R
50|$|A High-quality dual {{carriageway}} (HQDC) is {{a category of}} road in Ireland. It is an <b>all-purpose</b> {{dual carriageway}} <b>road</b> type built to near motorway standards, but without motorway classification or motorway restrictions. High-quality dual carriageways have full grade-separated access {{and do not have}} junctions with minor roads. Such roads in the Republic of Ireland have been built as part of the 2000-2006 and 2007-2013 National Development Plans, including interurban routes from Dublin to other cities.|$|R
