40|$|Abstract — This article {{introduces}} <b>a</b> <b>grounded</b> capacitance multiplier employing current controlled current conveyor transconductance amplifiers (CCCCTAs). The provided capacitor is <b>a</b> <b>grounded</b> element. Its outstanding {{feature is}} that the capacitive value can be electronically adjusted by input bias currents of the CCCCTA and is temperature-insensitive. The circuit construction comprises two CCCCTAs, cooperating with <b>a</b> <b>grounded</b> capacitor. The circuit performances are depicted through PSPICE simulations, they show good agreement to theoretical anticipation. Application as a fifth-order Chebyshev low-pass filter is included. I...|$|R

5|$|Chicago White Sox manager Al López {{watched the}} game {{along with his}} {{pitching}} coach to scout their potential NL opponents for the World Series. The start of Game 1 was delayed 45 minutes due to rain, leaving only 18,297 fans in the stadium once the game was underway. The Dodgers opened the game quickly as Charlie Neal singled with one out, advanced to second base on <b>a</b> <b>ground</b> out, and scored on a single by Norm Larker to give the Dodgers an early 1–0 lead. Dodgers starter Danny McDevitt held the Braves scoreless in the first inning, but was driven from {{the game in the}} second. After a line out to open the inning Johnny Logan walked, Del Crandall singled, and Bill Bruton singled to bring home Logan and tie the game at 1. Larry Sherry entered in relief of McDevitt, who pitched just 1 innings. Carl Willey, the Braves' pitcher, reached base on an error to load the bases. Crandall then scored on <b>a</b> <b>ground</b> out by Bobby Ávila to give the Braves a 2–1 lead before Sherry finished out the second.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the delay}} of the 707 programme, the {{contribution}} of the 707B and 707A towards the basic design of the 698 was not considered significant, though it did highlight a need to increase the length of the nosewheel to give <b>a</b> <b>ground</b> incidence of 3.5 degrees, the optimum take-off attitude. The 707B and 707A proved the design's validity and gave confidence in the delta planform. A second 707A, WZ736 and a two-seat 707C, WZ744 were also constructed but they played no part in the 698's development.|$|E
