50|$|The Minnesota Steel Company, {{which was}} {{incorporated}} by U.S. Steel in 1907, was the subsidiary operating unit of U.S. Steel in Duluth. The steel plant was {{under construction in}} 1908 and poured its first ingot of steel on December 11, 1916. It was the largest integrated steel works west of Chicago until Geneva Steel was constructed in 1943. Minnesota Steel Company was the largest employer {{in the city of}} Duluth from its inception to its closing, to include the steel and cement plants, and was the fourth-largest industrial manufacturing facility in the State of Minnesota. Minnesota Steel was the holding company for the steel plant (and for Morgan Park itself) until it was leased to the American Steel and Wire Division (AS&W) of U.S. Steel in June 1932.

The correction accounts for the effect of stochastic volatility and the <b>associated</b> <b>market</b> price of risk. For European derivatives it is given by explicit formulas which involve parsimonous parameters directly calibrated from the implied volatility surface. The method presented here is based on a martingale decomposition result which enables us to treat nonMarkovian models as well...|$|E
40|$|When {{consumers}} {{differ in}} their attitude towards risk, price competi- tion between products of uncertain characteristics may be analyzed using address-models of product differentiation. These models provide a natural set-up for analyzing industries in which products of different reliability may coexist. This is in particular the case of second-hand markets. For such industries, we characterize the Nash equilibrium in prices and the <b>associated</b> <b>market</b> outcomes. They are shown to depend mainly {{on the distribution of}} risk aversion in the population. When the degree of reliability is chosen before price competition takes place, maximal differentiation results, yielding either horizontal or vertical differentiation configurations. ...|$|E

While there is no equilibrium where PWYW dominates the market, given a sufficiently high level of surplus-sharing and product differentiation, it is chosen by the second mover to avoid Bertrand competition. The equilibrium results and their <b>associated</b> <b>market</b> characteristics are consistent with empirical examples of PWY...|$|E
