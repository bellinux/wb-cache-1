Featuring essays by nine IISS analysts {{and a number of}} outside experts, the book examines the most important geostrategic issues in the region, including the myriad security challenges it faces. These interlinked papers focus in particular on the regional ramifications of the civil war in Syria and the effects of the United States changing posture in the Middle East.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the survey was to {{identify}} which methods primary teachers are using and see as success factors in the language development. To study which factors came from a sociocultural approach to learning, in order to <b>develop</b> <b>and</b> create <b>discussions</b> <b>and</b> improvements so that second language learners reach their targets. The study is based on three teachers' teaching of second language students in the primary grades, using qualitative interviews and observations of their work. The results revealed that the organization and support resources are significant and can vary between schools in the same municipality. Furthermore it showed {{that two of the}} teachers interviewed, felt that it was difficult to teach second language students. They felt that they had insufficient knowledge, a heavy workload, a lack of time and they expressed both powerlessness and frustration. The conclusion of the study is that teachers, teaching second language students in the primary grades, did not believe in the use of just one method in their teaching, but used combined various methods. Several of these methods are based on a sociocultural approach, which reflected their vision and attitude to the learning process...|$|R

É durante este tempo que o médico desenvolve habilidades, atitudes e hábitos que o capacitam para o exercício da especialidade, pelo contato com seus professores na situação real da assistência aos pacientes. São atribuições naturais das sociedades médicas e não do Estado a orientação curricular dos Programas de Residência Médica, o seu credenciamento e fiscalização, assim como a determinação das competências mínimas e a concessão do Título de Especialista aos médicos qualificados.

40|$|The {{construction}} industry faces {{a challenge in}} tackling the unethical practices in the business. These practices are for example; bribery, illicit work, nepotism, discrimination and fraud. For Sweden’s major contracting companies, 75 percent of their revenue is spent on their suppliers in terms of material and services. Over time, the spend on subcontracting has significantly increased within the Swedish {{construction industry}}. The context of the construction industry is characterized by three aspects; one-off nature of projects, temporary multiorganizations and short term relationships. Due to these characteristics and the large degree of subcontracting, complex supply chains are created and the construction companies face a challenge to keep control of all tiers involved in a project. Since unethical actions in a supply chain are not necessarily confined to the company performing them, the impact can spread to other actors in the chain. Ethical misconduct {{can be seen as}} one of the risks with largest negative impact on a company due to the losses it may bring; reduced profitability, lost trust in the brand and deteriorated work environment for the employees. Therefore, it is vital for companies {{to reduce the risk of}} misconduct by ensuring that the supply chain acts ethically. This study has been conducted at Skanska Sweden within the purchasing department and the project organization. Skanska’s corporate goal is to have zero ethical breaches and the vision is to become a leader in ethics by 2015. With this and the paragraph above in mind, the following purpose has been developed for this study: “The purpose is to investigate driving forces and barriers for ethical work in the construction industry from a business perspective and to provide recommendations for strengthening and overcoming them respectively. ” In order for Skanska to avoid the potential risk scenarios stemming from ethical misconduct in the supply chain, the employees need to utilize the company’s ethical values towards subcontractors. Simultaneously, in order to differentiate and create business opportunities based on the ethical values, Skanska should utilize these values towards customers. The company´s ethical values stem from the code of conduct and consider for example; no discrimination or harassment, no fraud, no bribery and no illicit work. The term utilize will in this study concern communication, marketing, using ethics as a subcontractor requirement and using ethics as a differentiator on the market towards customers. The recommendations are; first, to motivate each role within the company to utilize ethical values towards subcontractors and this through incorporating the ethical values in daily work. In turn, the improved supply chain with regards to ethics can result in a protected and strengthened brand. Second recommendation is to overcome employees’ inadequate knowledge concerning utilization of the ethical values <b>and</b> this through <b>developing</b> guidelines for responsibility and how to communicate with subcontractors as well as discussion material for subcontractor relationships. Third recommendation is to create awareness of ethics as a supplier selection criterion by communicating ethical values towards customers <b>and</b> <b>developing</b> guidelines <b>and</b> <b>discussion</b> material for customer relations. The third recommendation also includes that Skanska should focus on differentiating with the ethical values towards customers with shared values through prioritizing among the customers. The key effects for Skanska if implementing the three recommendations are; avoidance of ethical misconduct in the supply chain, protection and improvement of Skanska’s brand, profitability and staff’s health, as well as development of ethical values as a differentiator on the market...|$|R

Furthermore, the paper explores the commoditization process of the sporting hero that reframes them into heritage “objects”. These “objects” are, in turn, responsible for the intangible heritage achievements produced during their careers.

40|$|Background: With {{the advent}} of openEHR Version 1. 0 a common Electronic Health Records (EHR) {{architecture}} has been defined to pursue the aim of having ubiquitous information available when {{and where it is}} needed.

Methods: Requirements analysis using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) and incremental prototyping; also a series of archetype workshops were conducted. Results: For a web-based archetype repository, a total of four top-level use cases, 23 refining use cases for 5 different actors, are found to be essential. A prototype implementing some of these use cases has been <b>developed.</b> <b>Discussion</b> <b>and</b> conclusions: We believe that Domain Knowledge Governance is necessary independent of the actual approach and methodology chosen for EHR systems. Appropriate information technological support is required to support a clear process for authoring, updating, managing, disseminating knowledge in archetypes as well as archetype version control.

40|$|This paper {{highlights}} {{the contribution of}} theoretical discussions of social education in UK youth work to debates about ‘social pedagogy’, arguing that the analysis of power and difference, in particular the impact of gender difference, which has occurred in youth work is essential in discussions of ‘social pedagogy’ too. Since ‘social pedagogy’ has been discussed {{as a source for}} transformed visions of schooling, the paper extends <b>and</b> <b>develops</b> <b>discussion</b> of pre-figurative counter-practice <b>and</b> how it can be sustained through an engagement with difference, drawing especially on the work of Luce Irigaray. Ideas and practice associated with social pedagogy have been drawn on to illuminate a radical vision of the common school as a counter-practice to the neo-liberal credentialisation of schooling. Such approaches resonate strongly with so-called romantic models of youth work in the UK (Wylie, 201075. Wylie, T. 2010. Youth work in a cold climate. Youth and Policy, 105 : 5 – 11. View all references) and their associated traditions of social education. The emphasis on the relational and the social in education might enable a fruitful engagement with feminist approaches especially that of the philosopher Luce Irigaray (1932 –present) whose work forms the basis of the engagement with difference which is advocated here. Such an engagement with difference is essential to any democratic project which resists pressures simply to normalise, standardise and contain those involved in education. ...|$|R
