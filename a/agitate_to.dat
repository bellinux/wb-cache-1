25|$|When the {{revolution}} spread to Latvia there was arguably a more focused target. Instead of frustration or class struggle, the adversary in Latvia was unambiguously the Baltic German elite: a separate social class of separate ethnicity speaking a separate language. Thus the 1905 revolution in Latvia was {{fundamentally different from}} that {{in the rest of}} Russia. Peasants of both Russian and Latvian ethnicity captured small towns and burned dozens of manors. The revolution in Latvia, however, did not <b>agitate</b> <b>to</b> separate from Russia, as nationalists continued to believe they needed the might of Imperial Russia to counter Baltic German dominance.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{opinions}} in the Midrash {{as to how}} old Rebekah {{was at the time}} of her marriage and, consequently, at the twins' birth. According to the traditional counting cited by Rashi, Isaac was 37 years old at the time of the Binding of Isaac, and news of Rebekah's birth reached Abraham immediately after that event. In that case, since Isaac was 60 when Jacob and Essau were born and they had been married for 20 years, then Isaac was 40 years old when he married Rebekah (Gen. 25:20), making Rebekah 3 years old {{at the time of her}} marriage, and 23 years old at the birth of Jacob and Essau. According to the second opinion, Rebekah was 14 years old at the time of their marriage, and 34 years old at the birth of Jacob and Essau. In either case, Isaac and Rebekah were married for 20 years before Jacob and Esau were born. The Midrash says that during Rebekah's pregnancy whenever she would pass a house of Torah study, Jacob would struggle to come out; whenever she would pass a house of idolatry, Esau would <b>agitate</b> <b>to</b> come out.|$|E

Hubei and Guangxi were {{subjected}} to the Hankou subcouncil of Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi. Li and Bai's Hankou and Canton self-ruling governments were terminated by Chiang. Hankou was captured by Chiang during the dispute between the Guangxi faction and Nanjing. From 1930-36 Bai was instrumental in the Reconstruction of Guangxi, which became a [...] "model" [...] province with a progressive administration. Guangxi supplied over 900,000 soldiers to the war effort against Japan.|$|E

2500|$|Rebecca was {{extremely}} uncomfortable during her pregnancy {{and went to}} inquire of God why she was suffering so. According to the Midrash, whenever she would pass a house of Torah study, Jacob would struggle to come out; whenever she would pass a house of idolatry, Esau would <b>agitate</b> <b>to</b> come out. Thinking that she was carrying one baby who was displaying conflicting propensities, Rebecca sought enlightenment at the yeshiva of Shem and Eber. There she received the prophecy that twins were fighting in her womb and would continue to fight all their lives. The prophecy {{also said that the}} older would serve the younger; its statement, [...] "One people will be stronger than the other" [...] has been taken to mean that the two nations will never gain power simultaneously; when one falls, the other will rise, and vice versa. According to tradition, Rebecca did not share the prophecy with her husband.|$|E
2500|$|In September 1933, Papen visited Budapest to {{meet the}} Hungarian Prime Minister Gyula Gömbös, and to discuss how Germany and Hungary might best co-operate against Czechoslovakia. The talks {{proceeded}} well, but a major issue that emerged concerned {{the efforts of the}} Nazi Party to take over the community life of the volksdeutsche (ethnic German) minorities in Hungary and in parts of Romania, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia claimed by Hungary. The Hungarians wanted the volksdeutsche minorities in the Banat, Transylvania, Slovakia and Carpathia to <b>agitate</b> <b>to</b> return to Hungary in co-operation with the Magyar minorities, a demand that Papen refused to meet. In September 1933, when the Soviet Union ended its secret military co-operation with Germany, the Soviets justified their move under the grounds that Papen had informed the French of the Soviet support for German violations of Versailles, and specifically avoided criticizing Hitler personally. In November 1933, Papen praised Hitler at a cabinet meeting after the referendum on leaving the League of Nations for the [...] "unique, most overwhelming profession of support that a nation has ever given its leader. In nine months, the genius of your leadership and the ideals which you have newly placed before us have succeeded in creating, from a people inwardly torn apart and without hope, a united Reich".|$|E

The commission began to <b>agitate</b> <b>to</b> recover money from Winter Park Resort to pay for land leased from the commission, known as the Evans Tract.

Shore played just four games for Boston, and was reported as being unenthusiastic about the arrangement.

He stayed with the Americans through their elimination from the playoffs, and was simultaneously playing with the Indians in their playoff games. Shore's final NHL game was March 24 against the Detroit Red Wings, which coincidentally was also the final NHL game for Hall of Famer and teammate Nels Stewart.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the end of}} the Northern Expedition, Chiang Kai-shek {{began to}} <b>agitate</b> <b>to</b> reorganize the army, the fact that it would alter the {{existing}} territorial influences among the Cliques in the party quickly aggravated the relationships between the central government and the regional powers. Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi and Huang Shaohong of the Guangxi Clique were the first to break off relations with Chiang in March 1929, which started the confrontation that lead to the Central Plains War. Chiang Kai-shek defeated the Clique in 1929. Following defeat in that civil war, Guangxi allied with Chen Jitang after he became chairman of the government of Guangdong in 1931, and turned against Chiang Kai-shek. Another civil war would have broken out if there had been no September 18 Incident, which prompted all sides to unite against the Empire of Japan. As a result, from 1930 to 1936, the Clique organized the reconstruction of Guangxi, which became a [...] "model" [...] province with a progressive administration. As a result, Guangxi was able to supply large numbers of troops in the war effort against Japan in the Second Sino-Japanese War.|$|E
