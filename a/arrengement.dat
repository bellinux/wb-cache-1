Microfabric and mineralogy properties {{have been studied}} using the XRD and SEM, to asses possible changes in their internal properties with the weathering process. Different weathering profiles of this clays have been described using field criteria, on which mineralogical composition and microfabric aspects were assesed. The results have indicated that, the geotechnical problems are not caused by a change in mineralogical and chemical aspects, but rather a combination of slaking, brittleness and disaggregation, resulting from stress release. It has been shown also that these processes are stimulated {{by the presence of}} expansive type clay minerals in the sediment. However the interlaminar cation is Ca, where by the osmotic expansion is not determinative but rather the interlaminar one developed mostly between the aggregates.

Wind {{is one of}} the {{important}} environmental factor in design of buildings and settlements. It becomes the main theme of the societies especially temperature of the comfort in the hot-dry climates zones. Owing to the technological development in recent years, performance research can be done with quantitative and experimental workings preparing artificial environment in advance. Today, its important that the influence of the wind on the cooling effect of the buildings and to bring this effects with scientific method. In context the surface of the courtyard’s apertures might effect the wind velocity and air flow in the courtyards and it should be consider and attentively investigate. The aim of the study is researching the cooling effect on the courtyards and atrium by the wind. At first we have to envisage the air flow which occurs {{on the surface of the}} courtyards; when we have obtained this envisage we have to research and develop the experimental data. Generally, the air movement, from high pressure area to low pressure area, is called the wind. The wind {{is one of the}} most important parameters which effects the occurence of the air movements on the earth and it effects differently in various regions because of geomorphological structure. For this reason, the effects of the emptiness ratios on velocity distributions have been examined by considering buildings, plants, topographical properties which hindered the wind. To examine the effects of the emptiness ratios on velocity distributions, firstly natural ventilation should be examined. Therefore, in the second chapter, the structure of the wind and wind types has been explained. The development of the architectural aerodinamics and courtyards in different cultures has been explained by giving some examples, in third chapter. Mankind has researched the wind and its effects until these days, and developed new techniques to constitute environment which is suitable for physical comfort conditions. The wind tunnel tests are done to develop the design of the buildings to examine the effects of the air movements which is around the building models. What kind of effects do air movements in ground surface of the buildings create in artificial environment? or How do soot atoms flying from chimney move around the buildings ? The answer of the questions like these, can be learned owing to the experimental workings doing in tunnels. The design of the buildings are done by examining the results of these experimental workings. When doing model in the wind tunnels, there are some rules to be attended. Surface roughness of the inside of the tunnel, effects the current model directly. So, not to create different dinamic effects, the empty measurement must be done before doing actual measurement. After the model was inserted in the tunnel, current model supplying as uniform may breakdown because of the change of the pressure distribution in the tunnel. Especially, if the ceiling of the tunnel is not suitable for the experiment, there will additional pressures on the model in the observation room. This will effect the results of the observation and cause the deviation on the current speed. If one of the apperance techniques is applied, there will be different deviations in the current traces. The deviations must be maximum % 5 in the tunnel observations. If deviations is greater than % 5, new <b>arrengements</b> in the tunnel must be done. The atmospherical boundary layer is the last criteria which is used to compare the results of the experiment obtaining in wind tunnels. In the experiments done for the building designs, which has the scale between 1 / 200 and 1 / 1000, the boundary layer may be applied. This expression can be defined by Reynolds number which is the most important criteria in the tunnel observations. The developing technology, helped us to speed up the workings about the computer supported apperance. Software producers, first studied about 2 D drawings and then progressed 3 D drawings. Among the devoloping technology, the studies about the computurized visuality, became faster. At the beginning soft - ware produces, basicly studied on two dimensional drawing programs, but today they were able to produce programs which could give three dimensional visuality in two dimensional drawings, the measured values recorded in the computer or they measured by the help of visuality program. In this method, the calculation made by excepting the velocity values on the tie point were constant. The occurring vectoral lines, decreased the inverse ratio of the air velocity and then visuality could be made according to the boundary of velocity. These measurements could be revaluated for some instant. The results of the wind tunnel experiments, could be idendified by mathematical and statistical methods. And so the physical and statistical behaves of the wind could be explained as turbulance, heaviness and velocity spills. For this reason, the aim of the study is to develop the experimental method in order to minimizing the use of the energy for cooling of the buildings and to investigate the air-flow which consists of the surface in the courtyards and atrium buildings. The stages of these works are planned as follows; Stage 1 : To examine the existing literature and facilities, to modify the existing wind tunnel, to set up the enstrumentation Stage 2 : To carry out the experiments using some special models. Stage 3 : Measurements for the sample buildings and settlement models, comparison of the results with the previous studies performed in other countries, to evaluate the results and to prepare the technical reports.

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2015 Dünyanın en büyük buluşlarından biri olan ateş pek çok yerde hayatımızı kolaylaştırdığı gibi kontrol edilmediğinde sonuçları felaketlere neden olan yangınlara yol açabilmektedir. Zamanla medeniyetin ve teknolojinin gelişmesiyle birlikte artan yangınlar, deprem gibi gerek insan hayatı açısından gerekse maddi açıdan ülkenin gelişimini etkiler duruma gelmiştir. Tarih boyunca meydana gelen yangınlar çok büyük can ve mal kayıplarına sebep olmuştur. Bunun nedeni olarak en başta yangın güvenliği bilincinin yeterince yerleşmemiş olması ve yönetmeliklerin tam anlamıyla uygulanmıyor olması gelmektedir. Yangının oluşumu kesin olarak önlenemese de alınacak önlemler ile vereceği zarar en aza indirilebilir. Yangının vereceği zarardan korunmak amacıyla yapının tasarım, yapım, işletme, kullanım süreci ve bakım süreçleri boyunca yangın güvenliği adına tüm önlemler alınmak zorundadır. Yangın da aynı deprem gibi nerde ve ne zaman olacağı belli olmayan ve sonuçları felaketle sonuçlanan ve genellikle ihmaller zinciriyle oluşan bir olaydır. Fakat ülkemizde yangına deprem kadar önem verilmemekte, tedbirler genellikle üstünkörü alınmaktadır. Başta Soma maden faciası olmak üzere ülkemizde son yıllarda görülen felaketler yangın esnasında yapılması gerekenler hakkında yeterli bilgimiz ve tecrübeli elemanımızın olmayışını ortaya koymaktadır. Yönetmeliklerin yangın için uyarlanması ve daha kapsamlı bir yangın yönetmeliği oluşturulması gerekmektedir. Yapılan bu tez çalışmasında; BYKHY (Binalarının Yangından Korunması Hakkında Yönetmelik) kapsamında öncelikle yanma ve yangın kavramlarından bahsedilmiş temel bilgilerin oluşması sağlanmıştır. Dünyada meydana gelmiş olan büyük metro yangınlarının nedenleri ve sonuçlarına değinilmiştir. Metrolarda meydana gelebilecek olan yangın olaylarına karşı alınması gereken önlemlerden söz edilmiştir. Bu bağlamda İstanbul metrosunda kullanılan yangın senaryoları, nasıl oluşturuldukları, istasyon ve vagonlarda kullanılan malzeme özellikleri ve hangi yönetmeliklerden yararlanıldığı anlatılmıştır. Metrolarda yangın güvenliği bilincinin oluşturulması doğrultusunda hazırlanan tez çalışması, beş ana bölümden oluşmaktadır. Birinci bölümde konuya giriş yapılmış, metrolarda yangın güvenliği konusunda yapılmış olan çalışmalar ve tezler araştırılıp konunun geçmişten bugüne gelişimi ele alınmış ve tezin amacı ortaya konulmuştur. İkinci bölümde yanma ve yangın ile ilgili genel kavramlar detayları ile anlatılmıştır. Ayrıca yangın çeşitleri, söndürme yöntemleri, yangın safhasındaki tehlikeler ve yangının insan vücuduna etkileri bu bölümde ele alınmıştır. Üçüncü bölümde taşıyıcı sistem elemanlarının yangın güvenliği kapsamında betonarme ve çelik taşıyıcı sistemlerde yangın güvenliği anlatılarak yangın yalıtımı yöntemleri ortaya konulmuştur. Dördüncü bölümde metrolar başlığı altında metrolarla ilgili genel bilgi verilmiş ve metroların tarihçesinden bahsedilmiştir. Ayrıca metrolarda yangın güvenliği kapsamında alınması gereken önlemler, havalandırma ve duman tahliye sistemleri hesapları, metrolarda simülasyon programı sonucu yapılmış olan senaryolar ve son olarak da dünyada meydana gelen büyük metro yangınlarından bahsedilmiştir. Beşinci ve son bölümde ise metrolarda yangın güvenliği için yapılması gerekenlerden ve ülkemizde bu konudaki yetersizliklerden bahsedilmiştir. Ayrıca büyük felaketlerin devamı gelmemesi için alınması gereken önlemlere değinilmiş ve bulgular tavsiye niteliğinde ele alınarak konu ile ilgili oluşturulacak olan yasal düzenlemelere kaynak teşkil edilmiştir. Fire {{is the one}} of the {{greatest}} inventions in the world that make our lives easier but if it can not be controlled can lead to terrible disaster. Fire, increasing with the development of civilization and technology, such as earthquakes, cause bad effect of development of the country. Fires through the history has been the cause of the huge loss of life and property. The reason for this is the lack of established primarily for fire safety awareness and comes to have not fully implemented the directive. If the damage is prevented, with measures to be taken as conclusive formation of the fire can be minimized. Building design {{in order to avoid the}} damage from the fire, construction, operation, and maintenance of process on behalf of fire safety during use processes must take all precautions. In this thesis study; BYKHY is provided to occur basic information mentioned in the concept of burning and fire. Large underground fires that have occurred in the world,has cause and results. In this context, the Istanbul subway fire scenarios used in, how they are created, and materials used in the station, wagon and was told that benefited from which regulations. Finally, so far rarely been the subject of a thesis in the metro are given information about the studies that have been made about fire safety. Unwanted fire is a destructive force that causes many thousands of deaths and billions of dollars of property loss each year. People around the world expect that their homes and workplaces will be safe from the ravages of an unwanted fire. Unfortunately, fires can occur in almost any kind of building. The safety of occupants depends on many factors in the design and construction of buildings, including the expectation that certain buildings and parts of buildings will not collapse in a fire or allow the fire spread. Fire deaths and property losses could be eliminated if all fires were prevented, or if all fires were extinguished at the flame. Fire can be reduce the probability of occurance, but it is impossible to prevent all major fires. Given that some fires will always occur, there are many strategies for reducing their impact, and some combination of these will generally be used. Although tunnel fires are not a common case, "Ground the public transportation systems" to be used by the crowded masses, requires special measures in this regard. Turned into a disaster of the many results of the causes of fires occurring in Metro reveals the lack of fire safety precautions need to be taken first. The use of smoking materials, such as flammable and toxic plastic lights, and deficiency of help devices and lack of fire resistant of electrical cables used in railway cars are caused a fire disaster. As in most of the disastrous fire occurred in metro is not the cause of death from fire, carbon monoxide and cyanide gas in the smoke are known to be toxic poisoning. The first thing to be done is get rid of toxic fumes. The lack of smoke evacuation systems in case of a fire in the subway tunnel is the most important reason that converts the results of the subway fire disaster occurred in the past. Besides, lack of the active safety fire extinguisher tubes, sprinklers and other fighting equipment occured terrible results. These results clearly indicate that the lack of precautions cause fire in the world in the past year. Many studies have been done in the world on fire, regulations and arranged a separate regulation was made especially for the subway. Compared with the developed countries, subway tunnel in fire safety we have a long way to cross in our country. There are no regulation in Turkey except building of Fire Protection (BYKHY) and TSE Regulation. Especially metro transport network of Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality which will spread to every place within the working target of 776 km of metro network will arise due to the underground fire safety and smoke evacuation system should give more importance. For the moment in the subway and other underground structures NFPA and BS (British Standard) was used to as well. Not only in the subway but also all businesses operating underground fire and smoke evacuation systems security is of the most importance. May 13, 2014 date as a result of the fire that occurred in the coal mine in Soma 301 people dead because of smoke poisoning is the most concrete examples. In this case show that the country has not enough precision about safety. As a result of the statistics conducted by Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality, there are about 10, 000 residential building fires every year. When the fire occures unclear like earthquake. Therefore, it is necessary to take lots of measures to fire as the measures taken for the earthquake. Fire disaster occurs much more frequently then earthquake. Therefore, the fire regulation must be regulated or produce new fire regulations. Thesis prepared in accordance with the creation of fire safety awareness in metro consists of five main sections. In the first part made introduction to the topic, studies and dissertations that have been made about fire safety in underground researched the subject deal with in the past development has been demonstrated to date and purpose of the thesis. General concepts related to the second part, burning and fire is described in detail. In addition, types of fire extinguishing methods, the effects of fire hazards in the fire phase and the human body are discussed in this section. Therefore, the growth rate of fire, high temperature, respiratory distress caused by toxic gases, collapse, electrical and chemical hazard are the other hazards in the fire place. The third chapter in the context of fire safety in concrete and steel structure structural elements explaining fire safety fire insulation methods are put forward. In this section is mention about the fire resistance of reinforced concrete system including the effects of high-temperature in steel and concrete. In addition, fire resistance of steel structural systems and measures to be taken are also included in this section. These measures are; spray-applied systems, plate systems, prefabricated systems, painting with intumescent paint, fill with concrete and fill with water. So that, the supporting elements can provide resistance to fire. Fourth section is mentioned about general information about the underground subways and a short history of the subway. In addition, measures should be taken in context of the subway fire safety, ventilation and smoke extraction systems, accounts, scenarios that have been made as a result of the simulation program in the subway and finally the world were mentioned in a large underground fire occurred. Fire safety measures in the metro are analyzed in three categories; wagons, tunnels and stations. Finally, we focused on large underground fire that occurred in the world in this section. Paris(Couroness), Londra (King’s Cross), Baku, Eurochannel (Mans Tunnel) and Korean underground fires are the most important fires in the world. This fire of the reasons given in detail and describe the measures taken afterwards in this part. The fifth and final section is mentioned about measures to be taken for fire safety in our country. Therefore in our country must have been a new regulations about this issue. As mentioned in the previous section, fire occurs too often and time is not clear. Compared with the earthquake, the incidence of the measures taken are very rare earthquake is much more than measures to fire. This contrasts situation must be resolve and make modifications in the regulations about fire. Outside America, Canada and other developed european country, there is no measures about fire. Moreover, we need to rise above world standard about fire safety in subway tunnels. We will expect legal <b>arrengements</b> and lots of developments about fire safety in our country. Yüksek LisansM.

As the second step in making such a SRDS, we analyzed a new SRDS named ”RS- 1 ”, which was made in our former study. We then chose twenty two items among the thirty items of RS- 1 which had statistically significant difference between the depressed patient's scores and the mildly depressed patient's scores and also between the mildly depressed patient's scores and the not-depressed patient's scores. Thus we made a new SRDS (RS 22) composed of these twenty two items. In another case, we chose twenty one itens among the thiry items of RS- 1 which were highly correlative to scores of Hamilton's Rating Scale (HRS) [...] the correlation coefficients were higher than 0. 45 [...] and we made another new SRDS (RS 21) composed of these twenty one items.

The outcome of this thesis contributes to the government-funded project ECOCENTS which deals with the design of innovative new aircraft cooling systems and the detailed flow analysis of these systems. This thesis was carried out at the company Airbus in Bremen, Germany. The main objective of this report was {{the evaluation of the}} ram pressure efficiency of four different ramp angles of a NACA inlet and the estimation of the drag caused by these geometries with the use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The flow solver used was TAU, a Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solver developed by the German Aerospace Center (DLR). The inlet consisted of one ramp section where the ramp angle was fixed at 7 degrees, and a second variable ramp section. The following different angles were investigated: 4, 7, 10 and 15 degrees. These configurations were evaluated at a velocity of Mach 0. 8 and a Reynolds number of 10 * 10 ^ 6. The ramp angle of 7 degrees was evaluated at two additional velocities (Mach 0. 73 and Mach 0. 87) and at two additional Reynolds numbers (5 * 10 ^ 6 and 15 * 10 ^ 6) at Mach 0. 8. The inlet efficiency outcome of this study was located between two other investigations. The results of this RANS computation predicted a higher total pressure at the inlet throat plane compared to a previous CFD investigation where a different RANS solver at the same geometry was used. In comparison to an estimation method mainly based on experimental data (ESDU method), the recent study showed a lower total pressure at the inlet throat plane. The aerodynamic drag that arised by the presence of the inlet system was calculated within this thesis to be higher than the outcome of the experimental data based (ESDU) method. The advantage of using a NACA type inlet was observed to be highly related to the ramp angle. Vortices are originated and develop along the edges of the intake ramp walls. These two vortices help to transport higher energy flow from the free stream into the inlet and therefore reduce the boundary layer thickness in the inlet region. For lower mass flows (0. 10 - 0. 20 kg/s) a ramp angle of 7 degrees was seen to be prefered in view of ram pressure efficiency. At a higher mass flow (0. 25 kg/s) the 10 degrees ramp angle was prefered, followed by the 15 degrees ramp angle at the highest investigated mass flows (0. 30 - 0. 35 kg/s). In view of drag, the lowest ramp angle possible for a given mass flow was seen to be most advantagous. Future work on this subject will include simulation of an inlet in combination with a heat exchanger and a ram air outlet. This <b>arrengement</b> will be the same as in the investigation at the TWG test campaign and therefore comparable. The difference in outcome of the separate CFD analysis was discussed within this investigation but could not be completely cleared...|$|E
40|$|The {{practical}} {{goal of this}} bachelor’s {{thesis is}} to test the website www. eesti. ee navigation, usability and general satisfaction with the existing information. Webapplications usability is most effectively explained with ISO 9241 - 11 standard. According to that standard it has to count on the prior firmed and assigned goals and criterias that the goaloriented protcedures has to correspond. Based {{to the theory of}} a website usabilty, creation and testing and from the statistical data about goverment e-services usability that was ordered by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communication and results of the experimental analysis I searched for answers to the following research questions and to prove or to object the following hypothesis in my paper: Research questions: 1. How to the test users rate the usability of the state portal www. eesti. ee? 2. How are the test users satisfied with the information on the website eesti. ee? 3. How does the Think-aloud method qualify to test usability on the www. eesti. ee? Hypothesis : Accessibilities to the e-services are quite complicated and the journalism and public relation students are not aware of their existence. The use of e-services is too complicated for the journalism and public relation students The journalism and public relation students think that the e-services are not useful and trustful. To find answers for the research questions and to control the hypothesis validity I used {{one of the most popular}} usability testing methods that is Think-Aloud method combined with the semi-structured interview. The goal of the Think-Aloud method was to observe the student while he is surfing on the website andto find the obstacles for the user in the process of the experiment. The aim of the semi-structured interview was to examine what is the attidude towards to the public e-services and what kind of thoughts, emotions and assesments after testusing the portal www. eesti. ee. The selection was constituted from the 10 students of the journalism and public relation department. They were divided equally between first and third courses of university and sexual distribution was that there is 5 male and 5 female student. Testusers were not using exactly this public portal before and in this case I can say that all students were firsttime users, so there was detected lots of problems how to rebuild this portal to more comfortable. Students were forced to learn the basics about this portal to gain their goals and thesis. They could not use the moves that they were familiar to. To analyse the research results i used qualitative content analyse and achieved the next generalized answers to my research questions: Usability of the public portal website was not rated very high, according to students estimation, learning the interface takes a bit time, but is still quite learnable. Multitide of information is a bit irritating and confusing In my opinion the think-aloud method mixed with semi-structured interview was kind a good mode to test the usability of the website www. eesti. ee The results of hypothesis control was following: - The e-services are not hard to gettable, but students do not know what this eservices portal offers and mostly it was complicated due the lack of the knowledge. - Finding adequate e-services on that website was hard in many ways but the implemention or realizing the services was easy to do. The problem was, that the information that was given on website was mostly daily or was imperfect. - The students of journalism and public relation found that mostly those public eservices are useful and also there is a chance to save some money and time and plus it is making our lives more effective and easier and the students are thinking that e-services are kind a trustful. Main rule of E-Commerce: „ if the user cannot find the product, then they cannot buy it” (Nielsen, 2003). Website must consider the ursers goals and expectations, that why hei s using certain website and the creator of the website should count on that the procedures and movement on that website is easy and comfortable. There is no common rule that defines the usability about the websolution construct. But there is some statements and aspects that consider while creating the website. How easy it is to find the information on the website and how logically it is arranged. Is it comfortable to the customer to find the information and move from site to site Friendly solution is the reason of good thinkin, winning new clients and keeping the old ones. Present bachelor’s paper will give some advice to the website creator how to raise the usability of the website according to epirical researches results and analysis, that was consisntent about information overbundance, the logical <b>arrengement</b> of the links and menus, quick search system repairing and also some visual appearance. Also I hope that all these advices and suggestions are useful to the Estonian Informatic Centre...|$|E
