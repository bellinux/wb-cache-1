5|$|After Pather Panchali, Ray {{went on to}} make 36 more films, {{including}} feature films, documentaries and shorts. He {{worked on}} scripting, casting, scoring, cinematography, art direction and editing, as well as designing his own credit titles and publicity material. He developed a distinctive style of film-making based, <b>as</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> Pather Panchali, on visual lyricism and strongly humanistic themes. Thus, Ray established himself as an internationally recognized auteur of cinema.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> {{almost all}} German capital ships during World War I, Moltkes action was {{somewhat}} limited. However, she did participate {{in most of}} the major fleet actions conducted by the High Seas Fleet. At the start of the war, the ship was assigned to the I Scouting Group of the High Seas Fleet, under the command of Rear Admiral Franz Hipper.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> his grandfather, Sultan Ibrahim, Sultan Iskandar's {{independent}} mindset {{resulted in}} strained {{relations with the}} Malaysian federal government on numerous occasions. This was more so during his days as the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, whereby a number of notable public incidents involved Sultan Iskandar. Nevertheless, Sultan Iskandar was reputed to show great concern to his subjects, and was held in high esteem by many of his subjects–particularly the Malays and Orang Aslis.|$|E
50|$|Historically {{the titles}} of Tennō in Japanese have never {{included}} territorial designations <b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with many European monarchs.

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> many of Heinlein's books, Starship Troopers was {{completed}} in a few weeks. It was originally written as a juvenile novel for New York publishing house Scribner; Heinlein had previously had success with this format, having written several such novels published by Scribner. The manuscript was rejected, prompting Heinlein to end his association with the publisher completely, and resume writing books with adult themes. Scholars have suggested that Scribner's rejection was based on ideological objections {{to the content of}} the novel, particularly its treatment of military conflict.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> {{most of his}} works, Etty did {{not give}} the {{painting}} a title. It was initially exhibited as A Composition, taken from the Eleventh Book of Milton's Paradise Lost, and was referred to by Etty himself as The Bevy of Fair Women and The Origin of Marriage. By 1862, when it was shown at the International Exhibition, it had acquired its present title.|$|E
5|$|Composer Richard Strauss was {{appointed}} {{president of the}} Reichsmusikkammer (Reich Music Chamber) on its founding in November 1933. <b>As</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> other art forms, the Nazis ostracised musicians who were deemed racially unacceptable {{and for the most}} part disapproved of music that was too modern or atonal. Jazz was considered especially inappropriate and foreign jazz musicians left the country or were expelled. Hitler favoured the music of Richard Wagner, especially pieces based on Germanic myths and heroic stories and attended the Bayreuth Festival each year from 1933.|$|E

The main body of law applicable to arbitration is normally contained either in the national Private International Law Act (<b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in Switzerland) or in a separate law on arbitration (<b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in England and Jordan). In addition to this, a number of national procedural laws may also contain provisions relating to arbitration.|$|R

5|$|If {{bacteria}} form a parasitic {{association with}} other organisms, they are classed as pathogens. Pathogenic bacteria {{are a major}} cause of human death and disease and cause infections such as tetanus, typhoid fever, diphtheria, syphilis, cholera, foodborne illness, leprosy and tuberculosis. A pathogenic cause for a known medical disease may only be discovered many years after, <b>as</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> Helicobacter pylori and peptic ulcer disease. Bacterial diseases are also important in agriculture, with bacteria causing leaf spot, fire blight and wilts in plants, as well as Johne's disease, mastitis, salmonella and anthrax in farm animals.|$|E

Fey later starred in the 2014 comedy-drama This Is Where I Leave You, helmed by Date Night director Shawn Levy. <b>As</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> Baby Mama, although both of these films received generally mixed reviews, Fey's performances were well received by film critics.|$|E
5|$|Turkish {{nationalism}} and secularism {{were two of}} the six founding principles of the Turkish Republic. Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the leader of {{the early decades of the}} Republic, aimed to create a nation state (Turkish: Ulus) from the Turkish remnants of the Ottoman Empire. During the first three decades of the Republic, efforts to Turkify geographical names were a recurring theme. Imported maps containing references to historical regions such as Armenia, Kurdistan, or Lazistan (the official name of the province of Rize until 1921) were prohibited (<b>as</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> Der Grosse Weltatlas, a map published in Leipzig).|$|E

5|$|Ways of life {{often viewed}} as more rigid, such as {{soldiers}} and religious cultures, frequently have explicit rules regarding hair length. For example, Buddhist monks shave their heads {{as part of their}} order of worship. Similarly, religious men with long hair include the Nazarites of the Hebrew Bible (Samson being a famous example) and the Sikhs. Subservient cultures may view male long hair negatively, and are sometimes detected by their rulers through hair length, <b>as</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> the Gaelic Irish under English rule and the Moors under Spanish rule in Medieval Spain.|$|E
5|$|When first {{described}} in 1924, Velociraptor {{was placed in}} the family Megalosauridae, <b>as</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> most carnivorous dinosaurs at the time (Megalosauridae, like Megalosaurus, functioned as a sort of 'wastebin' taxon, where many unrelated species were grouped together). As dinosaur discoveries multiplied, Velociraptor was later recognized as a dromaeosaurid. All dromaeosaurids have also been referred to the family Archaeopterygidae by at least one author (which would, in effect, make Velociraptor a flightless bird).|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} cyclone can cease to have tropical characteristics {{in several different}} ways. One such way is if it moves over land, thus depriving it of the warm water it needs to power itself, quickly losing strength. Most strong storms lose their strength very rapidly after landfall and become disorganized areas of low pressure {{within a day or}} two, or evolve into extra{{tropical cyclone}}s. There is a chance a tropical cyclone could regenerate if it managed to get back over open warm water, such as with Hurricane Ivan. If it remains over mountains for even a short time, weakening will accelerate. Many storm fatalities occur in mountainous terrain, when diminishing cyclones unleash their moisture as torrential rainfall. This rainfall may lead to deadly floods and mudslides, <b>as</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> Hurricane Mitch around Honduras in October 1998. Without warm surface water, the storm cannot survive.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, John Foster {{suggested}} that the differences usually cited to differentiate Amphicoelias altus from the more well known Diplodocus are not significant and {{may be due to}} individual variation. Foster argued that Amphicoelias is probably the senior synonym of Diplodocus, and that if further research bears this out, the familiar name Diplodocus would need to be abandoned in favor of Amphicoelias, <b>as</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> Brontosaurus and its senior synonym Apatosaurus. In 2015, Woodruff and Foster reiterated this conclusion, stating {{that there is only one}} species of Amphicoelias and that it could be referred to Diplodocus as Diplodocus altus. They considered the name Amphicoelias to be a nomen oblitum. It has also been hypothesized that Amphicoelias should be considered an apatosaurine, and therefore should be placed in the subfamily Apatosaurinae.|$|E
5|$|Lindow Man's {{last meal}} was {{preserved}} {{in his stomach}} and intestines and was analysed in some detail. It was hoped that investigations into {{the contents of the}} stomach would shed light on the contemporary diet, <b>as</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> Grauballe Man and Tollund Man in the 1950s. The analysis of the contents of the digestive system of bog bodies had become one of the principal endeavours of investigating such remains. Analysis of the grains present revealed his diet to be mostly of cereals. He probably ate slightly charred bread, although the burning may have had ritual significance rather than being an accident. Some mistletoe pollen was also found in the stomach, indicating that Lindow Man died in March or April.|$|E
5|$|To {{prepare the}} dead for the afterlife, the mummies were {{surrounded}} with ceramic pots containing food, tunjos and cotton bags and mantles. The guecha warriors were richly venerated with golden arms, crowns, emeralds and cotton. When the caciques and zaque and zipa died, their mummified bodies {{were placed in}} mausoleums and surrounded with golden objects. The highest regarded members of society were accompanied by their many wives, by slaves and their children. The mummy of a baby described from a cave in Gámeza, Boyacá, had a teether around the neck. Other mummies of children were richly decorated with gold and placed in caves, <b>as</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> a young girl described by Liborio Zerda.|$|E
