5|$|By the 19th century, the {{graveyard}} was full {{and had become}} a public health concern. It was overrun with rats, and dogs chasing the rats, {{both of which were}} damaging the churchyard. Finding sufficient ground for new burials was increasingly difficult and bones were often removed to a nearby charnel house. In 1849, an extra charge was put on burials of people from outside the parish. In 1884, the churchyard was closed to all burials and <b>a</b> <b>cemetery</b> was opened in the town.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{diminutive}} size, the Church of St Nicholas {{was probably}} not constructed as an independent church. A legend links the church to {{the name of an}} unidentified local feudal lord named Nikola (Nicholas) as his final resting place, though archaeologist Nikola Mavrodinov considers it more likely that it was possibly a chapel or <b>a</b> <b>cemetery</b> church attached to a larger place of worship. The larger church was perhaps pulled down during the early Ottoman rule of Bulgaria (post-14th century). While the Church of St Nicholas was not destroyed, its renovation was prohibited by the Ottomans, thus it gradually fell into ruin.|$|E
