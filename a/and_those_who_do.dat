40|$|Object. In a {{randomized}} controlled trial comparing surgery and prolonged conservative treatment for sciatica of 6 - 12 weeks' duration, {{more than one-third}} of patients assigned to conservative treatment underwent surgery. The objective {{of the present study was}} to evaluate whether MRI at baseline could have predicted this delayed surgery. Methods. Independently evaluated qualitative and quantitative MRI findings were compared between <b>those</b> patients <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not undergo surgery during follow-up in the conservative care group. In addition, area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to assess how well MRI parameters discriminated between <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not undergo delayed surgery (0. 5 - 0. 7 poor discrimination, ≥ 0. 7 acceptable discrimination). Results. Of 142 patients assigned to receive prolonged conservative care, 55 patients (39 %) received delayed surgery. Of the 55 surgically treated patients, 71 % had definite nerve root compression at baseline compared with 72 % of conservatively treated patients (p = 0. 76). Large disc herniations (size > 50 % of spinal canal) were nearly equally distributed between <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not undergo surgery (25 % vs 21 %, p = 0. 65). The size of the dural sac was smaller in the patients who underwent surgery (101. 2 vs 122. 9 mm 2, p = 0. 01). However, the size of the dural sac discriminated poorly between <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not undergo delayed surgery (area under ROC curve, 0. 62). Conclusions. In patients who suffered from sciatica of 6 - 12 weeks' duration, MRI at baseline did not distinguish between patients <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not undergo delayed surgery.

An additional stressor is that there are not enough places for students to attend college, and over 1/3 of college graduates cannot find jobs, so career and employment counseling and development are central in school counseling.|$|E

The former believe that if people were to understand the reason and the purpose for each mitzvah, it would actually help them to observe and perform the mitzvah (some mitzvot are given reasons in the Torah).|$|E
