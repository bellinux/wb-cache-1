5|$|Despite its popularization {{in later}} times, the phrase is not {{recorded}} elsewhere in Roman history. Historians question {{whether it was}} ever used as a customary salute. It was more likely an isolated appeal by desperate captives <b>and</b> <b>criminals</b> condemned to die, and noted by Roman historians in part for the unusual mass reprieve granted by Claudius to the survivors.|$|E
5|$|Public {{entertainments}} {{varied from}} combat between just two gladiators, to large-scale events with potentially thousands of deaths. The naumachia (also called navalia proelia by the Romans) {{was one of}} the latter, a large-scale and bloody spectacular combative event taking place on many ships and held in large lakes or flooded arenas. Prisoners of war <b>and</b> <b>criminals</b> condemned to die were tasked with enacting naval battles to the death for public entertainment. Those selected were known as naumachiarii.|$|E

The additional missions feature Shen investigating terror attacks around Hong Kong stemming from a cultist group who believe that they will achieve spiritual salvation through the cleansing of Hong Kong residents. Shen must sabotage the cult's activities, ultimately ending in the arrest of the cult master. The DLC also adds the ability for Shen to tase and arrest civilians <b>and</b> <b>criminals</b> around Hong Kong, as well as additional collectibles, side missions, ownable police vehicles, and new clothing.|$|E

The article sets out what the public knows about crime <b>and</b> <b>criminal</b> justice, why this matters (i. e., how knowledge is thought to influence public opinion on crime <b>and</b> <b>criminal</b> justice), approaches to addressing a lack of public knowledge, and the contribution of public narratives to this debate.

5|$|The town walls {{became less}} {{important}} for defence in the 17th century, although in 1633, a footpath was {{built around the}} inside of the wall to help the watch and other law officers better pursue vagrants <b>and</b> <b>criminals.</b> The walls fared better than Southampton Castle, which was sold off to property speculators in 1618, but they played no part in the English Civil War. Some of the masonry from the castle was reused to strengthen the town walls in 1650 during the Third English Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 19th century, immigration, {{urbanisation}} and industrialisation {{transformed the}} territories, destroying the old frontier way of life. Three million immigrants arrived in Canada between 1910 and 1914, many of them from eastern Europe, and over half of them settled in the territories. The urban population grew significantly as new towns were established across the Prairies. Many of the immigrants were employed by the growing industries of the region, especially the large mining and manufacturing centres enabled by the Canadian Pacific Railway. As society changed, there were fears of immigrants <b>and</b> <b>criminals</b> exploiting the new rail network.|$|E
5|$|Discussions {{took place}} in the Tower of London {{about how to deal with}} the revolt. The King had only a few troops at hand, in the form of the castle's garrison, his {{immediate}} bodyguard and, at most, several hundred soldiers. Many of the more experienced military commanders were in France, Ireland and Germany, and the nearest major military force was in the north of England, guarding against a potential Scottish invasion. Resistance in the provinces was also complicated by English law, which stated that only the King could summon local militias or lawfully execute rebels <b>and</b> <b>criminals,</b> leaving many local lords unwilling to attempt to suppress the uprisings on their own authority.|$|E

5|$|The Soviet {{monetary}} reform of 1991, {{commonly referred to}} as the Pavlov reform, was the last {{monetary reform}} prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Initiated on 22 January 1991, it was intended to withdraw money from circulation for reallocation to the production of consumer goods, which were in short supply. In a speech, Pavlov stated that the reason for the withdrawal was the government's belief that money was being sent to the Soviet Union from abroad, fuelling inflation. Although ridiculed by the Soviet press at the time, three years later the truth of Pavlov's statement was verified. Mikhail Gorbachev then signed a presidential decree ordering the Soviet financial system to stop accepting and exchanging banknotes issued in 1961. The directive also included 50-rouble and 100-rouble banknotes issued in 1991. On 23 January 1991, the government began restricting monthly bank deposit withdrawals to 500 rubles with the official explanation that this was to freeze the income of corrupt officials, capitalists <b>and</b> <b>criminals.</b>|$|E
5|$|Varma chose Raghuvaran to {{play the}} local crime boss, Bhavani. Varma wanted him to underplay the character, {{which was based on}} real life. Before {{accepting}} the role, Raghuvaran studied the mannerisms and lifestyles of mob leaders <b>and</b> <b>criminals</b> in Mumbai for 20 days. Varma wanted to name the characters played by Nagarjuna and Raghuvaran as Bhavani and Siva respectively. At Nagarjuna's request, he reversed the names. Varma chose newcomers Chakravarthy, Jithendra, and Ramjagan to play J. D., Chinna, and Naresh after auditioning them at Annapurna Studios. Uttej, one of Varma's assistant directors, played a comic role of a server in the college canteen. He recommended Varma to cast Sushma for Keerthi's role.|$|E
5|$|Action T4 was a {{programme}} {{of systematic}} {{murder of the}} physically and mentally handicapped and patients in psychiatric hospitals that mainly took place from 1939 to 1941 and continued {{until the end of}} the war. Initially the victims were shot by the Einsatzgruppen and others; in addition gas chambers and gas vans using carbon monoxide were used by early 1940. Under the provisions of a law promulgated 14 July 1933, the Nazi regime carried out the compulsory sterilisation of over 400,000 individuals labelled as having hereditary defects. More than half the people sterilised were those considered mentally deficient, which included not only people who scored poorly on intelligence tests, but those who deviated from expected standards of behaviour regarding thrift, sexual behaviour and cleanliness. Mentally and physically ill people were also targeted. The majority of the victims came from disadvantaged groups such as prostitutes, the poor, the homeless <b>and</b> <b>criminals.</b> Other groups persecuted and killed included Jehovah's Witnesses, homosexuals, social misfits and members of the political and religious opposition.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that antisocial thinking can be an important risk-relevant treatment target for sexual offenders. The present study examined antisocial thinking as defined by two existing conceptualizations; psychopathy <b>and</b> <b>criminal</b> thinking styles. By examining the theoretical basis for each conceptualization, a pattern of relationships between a measure of psychopathy (PPI) <b>and</b> <b>criminal</b> thinking styles (PICTS) was developed and applied to the specific population of sexual offenders. The sample of 175 men convicted of sexual assault was drawn from a correctional institution and the state forensic mental health hospital. ^ Results of the study indicated that antisocial thinking is highly correlated with psychopathy <b>and</b> <b>criminal</b> thinking. Furthermore, psychopathy <b>and</b> <b>criminal</b> thinking may be describing a unitary construct that is a relevant treatment target. The data also suggest that rapists and child molesters may not significantly differ in antisocial thinking when conceptualized across the subdomains of psychopathy <b>and</b> <b>criminal</b> thinking. ...|$|R

40|$|Studies {{have shown}} {{that there is a}} {{significant}} association between violent victimization <b>and</b> <b>criminal</b> behavior. One potential explanation for this association is that genetically mediated processes contribute to both vio-lent victimization <b>and</b> <b>criminal</b> behavior. The current study uses data from the twin sample of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (n = 2, 568) to examine whether genetic and/or environmental factors explain the correlation between violent victimization <b>and</b> <b>criminal</b> behavior in adolescence and early adulthood. Results from the bivariate genetic analyses reveal that genetic factors explain 39 % of the covariance between violent victimization and delinquency in adolescence and 20 % of the correlation between violent victimization <b>and</b> <b>criminal</b> behavior in early adulthood. The remaining covari-ance between violent victimization <b>and</b> <b>criminal</b> behaviors is attributed to the same nonshared environmental factors operating on both.
