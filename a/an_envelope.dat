5|$|A virus particle, {{also known}} as a virion, {{consists}} of genes made from DNA or RNA which are surrounded by a protective coat of protein called a capsid. The capsid is made of many smaller, identical protein molecules which are called capsomers. The arrangement of the capsomers can either be icosahedral (20-sided), helical or more complex. There is an inner shell around the DNA or RNA called the nucleocapsid, which is formed by proteins. Some viruses are surrounded by a bubble of lipid (fat) called <b>an</b> <b>envelope.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractLoss of T cell {{homeostasis}} usually {{precedes the}} onset of AIDS. We hypothesized that rapid progressors may be transmitted with HIV- 1 that is particularly able to perturb T cell homeostasis. To this end, we have tested two transmitted, syncytium-inducing (SI) viral isolates from a rapid progressor in two thymus models. One of the isolates (R 3 A) exhibited markedly rapid kinetics of replication and thymocyte depletion. These phenotypes mapped to the <b>envelope,</b> as <b>a</b> recombinant NL 4 - 3 virus encoding the R 3 <b>A</b> <b>envelope</b> had similar phenotypes, {{even in the absence}} of nef. Notably, the viruses with high pathogenic activity in the thymus (R 3 A and NL 4 -R 3 A) did not show enhanced replication or cytopathicity in PHA-stimulated PBMCs. Furthermore, NL 4 -R 3 A did not enhance replication of the coinfected NL 4 - 3 virus in the thymus, suggesting an intrinsic advantage of the R 3 <b>A</b> <b>envelope.</b> The R 3 <b>A</b> <b>envelope</b> showed higher entry activity in infecting human T cells and in depleting CD 4 + thymocytes when expressed in trans. These data suggest that SI viruses with unique envelope functions which can overcome barriers to transmission may hasten disease progression by perturbing T cell homeostasis...|$|R

5|$|While not {{inside an}} {{infected}} cell {{or in the}} process of infecting a cell, viruses exist in the form of independent particles. These viral particles, also known as virions, consist of two or three parts: (i) the genetic material made from either DNA or RNA, long molecules that carry genetic information; (ii) a protein coat, called the capsid, which surrounds and protects the genetic material; and in some cases (iii) <b>an</b> <b>envelope</b> of lipids that surrounds the protein coat when they are outside a cell. The shapes of these virus particles range from simple helical and icosahedral forms for some virus species to more complex structures for others.
