5|$|Cattle raising was {{the major}} {{industry}} in the 1840s with sheep becoming predominant in the 1860s. At this time many Victorians settled in the Riverina to breed sheep and cattle to feed the miners {{taking part in the}} Victorian Gold Rush. The herds were considered inferior at first, but these pastures were good for stock, and the land which seemed <b>a</b> <b>desert</b> was actually good fattening country.|$|E

5|$|Since 1991 Somalia has {{lacked a}} {{functioning}} central electricity grid, but private entrepreneurs have offered electricity generation on a localised basis, typically offering {{a choice of}} daytime, evening or 24-hour electricity. Gaalkacyo, <b>a</b> <b>desert</b> town in central Somalia, was provided with streetlights by local entrepreneur Abdirizak Osman, who expanded his enterprises from telecommunications to power generators, not only lighting the town but also supplying free electricity to the local hospital.|$|E

5|$|The film's story {{takes place}} in Death Valley, where the large scale action {{sequences}} take place amid post-apocalyptic landscapes of Las Vegas in broad daylight. Drawing inspirations from western films and post-apocalyptic movies, including the Mad Max series, Extinction manages to reference such predecessors, with plot elements revolving around the shortage of oil, the shortage of supplies, a convoy traveling across <b>a</b> <b>desert,</b> and the desert taking over civilized land.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>desert</b> is not {{the kind}} of habitat that favours the {{presence}} of amphibians, with their requirement for water to keep their skins moist and for the development of their young. Nevertheless, some frogs live in deserts, creating moist habitats underground and hibernating while conditions are adverse. Couch's spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus couchii) emerges from its burrow when a downpour occurs and lays its eggs in the transient pools that form; the tadpoles develop with great rapidity, sometimes in as little as nine days, undergo metamorphosis, and feed voraciously before digging a burrow of their own.|$|E
5|$|After brief {{footage of}} a tank driving across <b>a</b> <b>desert</b> {{landscape}} {{a baby is}} shown playing with a paper aeroplane. A hat {{is placed on the}} baby's head and the head is then removed and fitted onto the body of a bomber pilot. The next scene shows a fleet of bombers bombing a city while an anti-aircraft gunner fires at them and troops parachute down. A soldier is seen running across a bombed out city before two opposing troops are shown repeatably stabbing each other with bayonets on a battlefield landscape filled with human skulls. This scene is intercut with footage of two military leaders playing chess.|$|E
5|$|Antarctica, on average, is the coldest, driest, and windiest continent, and has {{the highest}} average {{elevation}} of all the continents. Antarctica is <b>a</b> <b>desert,</b> with annual precipitation of only 200mm (8in) along the coast and far less inland. The temperature in Antarctica has reached −89.2°C (−128.6°F) (or even −94.7 as measured from space), though the average {{for the third quarter}} (the coldest part of the year) is −63°C (−81°F). Anywhere from 1,000 to 5,000 people reside throughout the year at the research stations scattered across the continent. Organisms native to Antarctica include many types of algae, bacteria, fungi, plants, protista, and certain animals, such as mites, nematodes, penguins, seals and tardigrades. Vegetation, where it occurs, is tundra.|$|E

5|$|Bergonzoli {{knew that}} if Bardia and Tobruk held out, a British advance further into Libya {{eventually}} must falter under the logistical difficulties of maintaining <b>a</b> <b>desert</b> force using an extended overland supply line. Not knowing how long he had to hold out, Bergonzoli was forced to ration his stocks {{of food and water}} so that O'Connor could not simply starve him out. Consequently, hunger and thirst adversely affected the morale of the Italian defenders that had already been shaken by the defeat at Sidi Barrani. So too did medical conditions undermine morale, particularly lice and dysentery, the results of poor sanitation.|$|E
5|$|Domino and Bond reunite with Leiter on a United States Navy {{submarine}} {{and track}} Largo to a location {{known as the}} Tears of Allah, below <b>a</b> <b>desert</b> oasis on the Ethiopian Coast.

Bond catches and fights Largo underwater. Just as Largo tries to detonate the last bomb, he is killed by Domino, taking revenge for her brother's death. Bond returns to the Bahamas with Domino.|$|E
5|$|Hiruma {{has made}} several {{appearances}} {{outside of the}} Eyeshield 21 anime and manga.
