It was {{one of the hardest things}} I've ever had to do on a shoot. But it went by so quickly. I had a body suit on underneath my clothes, so there's <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>fun</b> fact for you. I was trying not to break my focus pretty much the entire shoot, because I was really in that zone – thinking a lot about the position I was in a year ago... thinking about the situation and how much I wanted to get all that emotion off my chest." ...|$|E
500|$|The year 1984 found Como {{traveling}} the US with his 50th Anniversary tour. Having {{spent most of}} his professional life in radio or recording studios and on television soundstages, he was enjoying doing live performances. Even after his 80th birthday, Perry continued the concert tours. Gone, however, were the cardigan sweaters which had been a staple of his weekly television shows, and which he had actually hated having to wear. Como now performed in a tuxedo, saying, [...] "It shows respect for the audience." [...] The return to live appearances also provided Como with an opportunity to have <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>fun</b> with his [...] "Mister Nice Guy" [...] image in a song Ray Charles and Nick Perito his closest collaborator since 1963, wrote and composed for him: ...|$|E

500|$|Kenny also {{provided}} {{the voice of}} Gary, SpongeBob's meowing sea snail, and the narrator in the episode. According to him, [...] "It was always Steve's intention that the narrator be a nod to his beloved Jacques Cousteau." [...] Kenny described Cousteau's voice as [...] "very dispassionate, very removed, very flatline, even when he’s describing something miraculous and beautiful." [...] At first, {{they found that the}} narrator [...] "just sounds bored," [...] so they decided that he [...] "has to sound <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>fun</b> and playful." [...] Kenny said, [...] "'Eet ees the most amazing thing I have ever seen I have ever seen in my life.' We found that after a while we had to make the narrator a little more playful than that." ...|$|E
500|$|Alex Rocco also voiced Meyers in [...] "The Day the Violence Died" [...] and [...] "The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show." [...] He {{said that}} he liked voicing Meyers because [...] "I {{get to be a}} big-shot." [...] He professed being nervous when voicing the {{character}} {{for the first time in}} [...] "Itchy & Scratchy & Marge" [...] because he {{said that he}} had never done a voice-over before. At first he tried doing a special voice, but was told to [...] "just be yourself." [...] Rocco was one of Bill Oakley's and Josh Weinstein's favorite guest stars, and they liked including him in their episodes so they could [...] "have <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>fun</b> with him." [...] On occasions when Rocco was unavailable to do a voice over, Meyers was voiced by Hank Azaria in [...] "The Front" [...] (season four, 1993), [...] "Lady Bouvier's Lover" [...] (season five, 1994) and [...] "Itchy & Scratchy Land." ...|$|E
500|$|Nikisch {{was invited}} to tour North America in 1912, and despite his long {{association}} with the Berlin Philharmonic and Leipzig Gewandhaus orchestras, he insisted that the LSO should be contracted for the tour. The orchestra, 100-strong (all men except for the harpist), was booked to sail on the Titanic, but the tour schedule was changed at the last minute, and the players sailed safely on the Baltic. The tour was arduous, but a triumph. The New York Press said, [...] "The great British band played with a vigor, force and temperamental impetuousness that almost lifted the listener out of his seat." [...] The New York Times praised all departments of the orchestra, though, like The Manchester Guardian, it found the strings [...] "brilliant rather than mellow". The paper had <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>fun</b> at the LSO's expense: {{from the viewpoint of}} a country that had long enjoyed permanent, salaried orchestras such as the Boston Symphony, it gently mocked the LSO's [...] "bold stand for the sacred right of sending substitutes" ...|$|E
5000|$|Writing for Allmusic, {{music critic}} Richie Unterberger wrote the album [...] "It's perhaps <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more <b>fun</b> to hear {{than the average}} early 1960s Jack Elliott album, because the live {{ambience}} and spoken introductions and asides give it a warmer atmosphere than the earnest but plain studio recordings." ...|$|R

500|$|Though {{the song}} {{has never been}} {{performed}} live {{as part of a}} televised performance, the song was featured on the set list of the Loud Tour. Before she performed [...] "Skin", Rihanna appeared on stage with a set similar to that of her performance of [...] "S" [...] remix with Britney Spears at the 2011 Billboard Music Awards, wearing a black tuxedo and pink tie to perform a cover of Princes [...] "Darling Nikki", before transitioning into [...] "S". As [...] "S" [...] started, Rihanna removed her tuxedo to reveal a white PVC body suit. After performing [...] "S", Rihanna performed [...] "Skin" [...] while laying on raised platform, and at {{near the end of the}} performance said [...] "this is the part of the show when we like to have <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>fun</b> [...] who wants to come up here and get freaky with me?" [...] and takes a man out of the audience and pins them down on the platform, where she provocatively and sexually gyrates and grinds him as they are lowered under the stage as the song's instrumental ends and the lights go out. Rihanna has caused controversy by occasionally opting to perform the act with a woman instead.|$|E
500|$|In 2009 Hayes {{quit the}} serial and her exit storyline played {{out the same}} year. It was {{initially}} left unclear what impact her departure would have on Miles'. Their relationship deteriorates after Kirsty miscarries their unborn baby. Kirsty is left distraught and feels she has to move with her life without Miles. However, Kirsty does not tell Miles she is leaving and leaves him a goodbye letter. Speaking of the scenes, Hayes said [...] "I don't agree with what she did or how she did it but Kirsty in her warped, grieving mind thinks it's best for everybody." [...] She felt that Kirsty's actions were [...] "horrible and selfish." [...] She also described her as [...] "emotionally detached" [...] and Miles {{would have tried to}} talk her out of leaving if he had been made aware of her departure. Viewers were not shown the full content of the goodbye letter. Hayes said it was good because she wrote a private goodbye letter to Quong Tart, and noted the personal element was best left between the two. After Miles chances of a family are again ruined, Miles loses control. He starts drinking and on one occasion he tries to kiss Leah. Producers decided to introduce a character named Rabbit (Mitzi Ruhlmann), who [...] "brings <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>fun</b> back into Miles' life." ...|$|E
500|$|The Diane Martel-directed {{music video}} for [...] "Love Sex Magic" [...] premiered on March 22, 2009. In an {{interview}} with MTV News, Ciara said: [...] "It's all about showing another side of me with this video. I'm basically giving you a show you'd see in Vegas—and it's my love, sex and magic show. He's the voyeur and I play with him a little bit. I got my inspiration from the Crazy Horse show and just from the shows , period. It's giving you the elements of love and sex and magic." [...] In a later interview about the video, Ciara stated {{that she had to}} lick Timberlake's ear, and at one point, he was licking her neck and they were [...] "freestyling." [...] Martel wanted them to do something [...] "edgy," [...] so they found a [...] "cool way to do it." [...] Ciara noted the different pauses in cuts in between the tapings, commenting [...] "so it's licking on the neck, again, then his biting on my neck, again. It was really funny." [...] The singer would later elaborate on the Crazy Horse show reference in {{an interview with}} Blues & Soul, explaining that she had so much respect for the show that it became her reference. On working with Timberlake, she said, [...] "Justin {{is one of the most}} easy-going, down-to-earth, hard-working and passionate artists you could ever work with. And, with both me and him, our goal was just to make the best video we could possibly make together, and to give the fans something <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>fun</b> and a little unexpected." ...|$|E

50|$|After Leg 8, Kynt & Vyxsin {{were the}} seventh team eliminated. They called the villa, where teams were shocked at their elimination. As the Goths {{explained}} {{what went wrong}} in their Mumbai leg, they also expressed how well teams like Nicolas & Donald and Ronald & Christina were doing. Then, as the sequestered teams realized {{their time in the}} villa would soon end, everyone went out for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> poolside <b>fun.</b>|$|R
500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{also gave}} the episode a {{positive}} review, and opined, [...] "With the dissing of glee club temporarily put on hold, Glee {{the series was}} able to have <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>fun</b> with Tuesday night's episode. And fun it was, with the gang of New Directions taking on Valentine's Day, with flirting, kissing and, of course, singing. Without the bullying, this was a much lighter episode of Glee, and the results {{gave way to a}} lot more laughs and story development." [...] He went on to praise Ashley Fink's performance as Lauren Zizes, and said of Puck's falling in love with Lauren, [...] "I can't decide if I want to root for this couple, but I certainly know I'm going to be rooting for Lauren." [...] Canning ultimately gave the episode an 8.5 out of 10. Wyndham Wyeth of Paste went on to praise the episode for its depiction of relationships in high school, as well as the backing vocals for Salling's performance of [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls" [...] by Queen. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a positive review and a grade of [...] "A−": Silly Love Songs' is a fine example of the show at what's very nearly its absolute best. There’s nothing too heady here, but if the show has one tone that it's nailed almost completely consistently, it’s the feeling of teenage romance, the sense that the person you're in love with is the only person you will ever be in love with [...] followed almost immediately by the crippling feeling of heartbreak, of losing that person too soon. Teenage life moves fast and is filled with heightened emotions. And like most musicals, Glee has always been at its best when it embraces those two sides of its characters' lives. As such, 'Silly Love Songs', which is pretty much just an excuse to play around with the show's many romantic pairings among its glee club characters, is a lot of fun without trying all that hard." [...] In conclusion of his review, he wrote, [...] "The best episodes play that elation and devastation off of each other. The worst episodes flounder about for some sort of emotional foothold. But when Glee just tells small, sweet stories about these kids and the ways they're trying to cope with being in high school when they know they're meant for bigger things, it can be terrific. Tonight was one of those episodes, and tonight's episode was terrific. Here's to a good February sweeps." ...|$|E

5000|$|Lisa Fernandes from Next Projection {{rated the}} episode with 8.7/10. [...] "This one isn’t quite a car crash, but it’s not a smooth getaway, either. It is indeed <b>a</b> <b>fun</b> <b>little</b> adventure, however. Worth a record." ...|$|R

2500|$|Huxley {{said that}} Brave New World was {{inspired}} by the utopian novels of H. G. Wells, including A Modern Utopia (1905) and Men Like Gods (1923). Wells's hopeful vision of the future's possibilities gave Huxley the idea to begin writing a parody of the novel, which became Brave New World. He {{wrote in a letter to}} Mrs. Arthur Goldsmith, an American acquaintance, that he had [...] "been having <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>fun</b> pulling the leg of H. G. Wells," [...] but then he [...] "got caught up in the excitement of [...] own ideas." [...] Unlike the most popular optimist utopian novels of the time, Huxley sought to provide a frightening vision of the future. Huxley referred to Brave New World as a [...] "negative utopia", somewhat influenced by Wells's own The Sleeper Awakes (dealing with subjects like corporate tyranny and behavioural conditioning) and the works of D. H. Lawrence.|$|E

500|$|Night School {{wanted the}} story to have scary and supernatural elements, without verging on horror. [...] "We wanted to {{something}} <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit more [...] Spielberg-ian, and sort of give it a sense of wonder and have it, for awhile, just be actually interacting with these supernatural creatures where it's almost <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit <b>fun,</b> and hopefully, gives you butterflies in your stomach before it gets pretty crazy," [...] Krankel said. The developers were influenced by other coming-of-age stories like Stand By Me when developing the characters and story; Krankel cited the character of Lindsay Weir from Freaks and Geeks as the biggest outside influence {{on the character of}} Alex.|$|R

5000|$|Initially, Jackson {{had wanted}} [...] "Good Time" [...] {{to be the}} first single from the album, because he had largely avoided up-tempo songs for the past several years, and wanted to put out [...] "somethin' <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more <b>fun</b> and up-tempo." [...] However, the staff at his label decided to release [...] "Small Town Southern Man" [...] first, as it was [...] "more typical of what people expect" [...] of him.
