40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} was to develop teacher performance in educational measurements <b>and</b> <b>evaluations</b> through self-monitoring strategies. Participants comprised 10 administrators and teachers. Qualitative data was collected from informal interviews and a focus group. The {{research was}} conducted in five steps for improving self-monitoring. The results of this research found that the self-monitoring strategies showed that teachers learnt best from the concrete example in the report on test preparation for the Basic Education National test. Teachers intended to learn about learning educational measurements <b>and</b> <b>evaluations</b> through participation in activities. By applying the self-monitoring process, teachers gained further knowledge in learning measurements <b>and</b> <b>evaluations,</b> participating in action planning, as well as greater realization and awareness {{of the importance of}} learning measurements <b>and</b> <b>evaluations...</b>|$|R
5|$|As part {{of their}} {{corporate}} philosophy, Linn intended significant dealer involvement in customer education and decision-making, and included teaching customers how to listen correctly for musical attributes. The trial <b>and</b> <b>evaluation</b> of the product prior to purchase and dealer's expert installation are considered by Linn to be important parts of the value added of their top-end products. As such, no instructions were supplied with the product. The Isobaric PMS retailed at £2,400 including stands in May 1991, and the 4-ohm crossover was priced at just under £500.|$|E
