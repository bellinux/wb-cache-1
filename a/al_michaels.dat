25|$|After about a 15-minute delay (ABC aired a rerun of Roseanne and subsequently, The Wonder Years in the meantime), ABC {{was able}} to regain power via a backup generator. ABC's play-by-play man, <b>Al</b> <b>Michaels</b> (who was {{familiar}} with the San Francisco Bay Area dating back to his days working for the San Francisco Giants from 1974-1976) then proceeded to relay reports to Ted Koppel at ABC News' headquarters in Washington, D.C. <b>Al</b> <b>Michaels</b> was ultimately nominated for an Emmy for his on-site reporting at the World Series.|$|E
25|$|In April 1987, Dierdorf {{was hired}} by ABC to join <b>Al</b> <b>Michaels</b> and Frank Gifford on Monday Night Football broadcasts. He spent 12 seasons on Monday Night Football before resigning the post in early 1999.|$|E

25|$|In the playoffs, ESPN {{used the}} team of Mike Breen and Bill Walton for its {{coverage}} of the 2005 Western Conference Final. <b>Al</b> <b>Michaels</b> partnered with newly added Hubie Brown for the NBA Finals on ABC.|$|E
25|$|For the 2005–06 season, <b>Al</b> <b>Michaels</b> and Hubie Brown were {{slated to}} remain as ABC's main {{broadcast}} team. The duo worked that year's Christmas Day game between the Los Angeles Lakers and Miami Heat and were expected to work the NBA Finals together as well. However, that plan {{did not come to}} fruition. In 2005, the National Football League (NFL) signed a contract with NBC for the rights to the Sunday night football (a package previously held by ESPN), which in turn resulted in Monday Night Football, which <b>Al</b> <b>Michaels</b> had been broadcasting for nearly 20 years, ending its run on ABC after the league's 2005 season.|$|E
25|$|<b>Al</b> <b>Michaels</b> was ABC's lead play-by-play {{commentator}} alongside color commentators Jim Palmer and Tim McCarver. Meanwhile, Gary Thorne was {{the backup}} play-by-play man alongside Joe Morgan (who {{had worked with}} Gary Bender the previous season) on color commentary.|$|E

25|$|Favre {{tried to}} lead the Packers down field again, but threw an {{interception}} to rookie Brandon McGowan in the end zone. The pick sealed a Bears victory, allowing the team to progress to 2–3. <b>Al</b> <b>Michaels</b> named Tillman as the 'Horse Trailer Player of the Game' for forcing two pivotal fumbles.|$|E
25|$|In baseball, Keith Jackson (alongside Tim McCarver) {{called the}} famous 16-inning sixth {{game of the}} 1986 National League Championship Series between the New York Mets and Houston Astros. That {{turned out to be}} the final Major League Baseball game that Jackson would broadcast. Jackson had {{previously}} broadcast ABC's coverage of the 1977, 1979 and 1981 World Series (Jackson split play-by-play duties with <b>Al</b> <b>Michaels</b> for the latter two with Jackson calling the games at the American League site), the 1978, 1980, and 1982 All-Star Game (again, sharing play-by-play duties with <b>Al</b> <b>Michaels</b> for the latter two), the 1980 National League Championship Series, the 1976, 1978 and 1982 American League Championship Series, the 1981 American League Division Series between the New York Yankees and Milwaukee Brewers, and the 1978 American League East tie-breaker game between the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox alongside Don Drysdale. He also called various Monday Night Baseball and other regular-season games for ABC throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s.|$|E
25|$|ABC {{televised}} {{the game}} in the United States with play-by-play announcer <b>Al</b> <b>Michaels</b> and color commentator Boomer Esiason. Chris Berman from Disney-owned corporate sibling ESPN hosted all the events. Berman was joined by fellow ESPN analyst Steve Young, while ESPN's Mike Tirico was on hand for the post-game presentation of the Vince Lombardi Trophy. Lesley Visser and Lynn Swann served as sideline reporters.|$|E
50|$|Yankovic came up {{with the}} idea for Fat while {{watching}} the Bad music video, when he had an epiphany that a parody of that song titled Fat would be a good sequel to Eat It (a previous Weird <b>Al</b> <b>Michael</b> Jackson parody). As he watched the Bad video, he imagined an obese version of himself trying to get through the turnstiles on a subway, and resolved that he would do it.|$|R

Though Rivers {{continued}} to work games with <b>Al</b> <b>Michaels</b> {{throughout the rest of the}} playoffs, ABC was forced to search for a new lead analyst for the 2004–05 season. In addition, the network dropped Brad Nessler from all NBA coverage, and did not retain Sean Elliott or Dan Majerle.|$|E
25|$|This was {{the last}} Super Bowl {{broadcast}} by the Monday Night Football broadcast team of Michaels, Gifford and Dierdorf. This was the broadcast team for Monday Night Football from 1987–1997. They also worked ABC's coverage of Super Bowls XXII and XXV. This would also be the last Super Bowl aired on ABC until the 1999 season (when <b>Al</b> <b>Michaels</b> called the game with Boomer Esiason).|$|E

During the 2006 NBA Playoffs, Breen worked games with ABC partner Hubie Brown, including the 2006 Eastern Conference Final.|$|E
25|$|In 1970, ABC Sports {{producer}} Roone Arledge {{tried to}} lure Scully to his network to call play-by-play for the then-new Monday Night Football games, but Scully's {{commitment to the}} Dodgers forced him to reject the offer. Instead, the role went to Keith Jackson for the initial year, before being replaced by Frank Gifford (from 1971 to 1985, when Gifford was in return, replaced by <b>Al</b> <b>Michaels</b> while Gifford converted into a color commentator up until 1997).|$|E
25|$|With anchorman Ted Koppel in {{position}} in Washington, D.C., ABC News began continuous {{coverage of the}} quake at about 5:40p.m., {{at the same time}} as CBS News; <b>Al</b> <b>Michaels,</b> in the process, became a de facto on-site reporter for ABC. NBC News also began continuous coverage, with Tom Brokaw, about an hour later. The Goodyear blimp had already been overhead to cover the baseball game, and ABC used it to capture images of damage to the Bay Bridge and other locations.|$|E
