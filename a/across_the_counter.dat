2500|$|Another {{man might}} have kidded and clowned {{and made a}} feature of being [...] "mine host" [...] in a restaurant, but when Karl opened his hot dog stand in Westwood his own feeling of despair must have been served <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> with the hamburgers. People {{could not bear to}} watch it. So they didn't come to buy his hamburgers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mrs Fox (Pamela Cundell), {{a glamorous}} widow. Having {{lost her husband}} in the 1930s, there is a mutual {{attraction}} with Corporal Jones and the couple marry in the last episode. Illicit little 'extras' are passed <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> on her regular visits to Jones' butchers shop and she helps the platoon with official functions. In the episode [...] "Mum's Army", she gives her Christian name as Marcia, but by the final episode she has become Mildred.|$|E
2500|$|Some working {{boats and}} modern replicas {{have a similar}} form of counter, built to be water tight as {{described}} in the [...] "transom stern" [...] section above. [...] These are being confused with lute sterns but as a lute is not watertight, a better term is needed. [...] Chappelle in American Small Sailing Craft [...] refers to a Bermudan boat with this form of counter, using the term [...] "square tuck stern" [...] to describe it. [...] The term [...] "tuck" [...] is used in the northwest of England for this area of the hull at the sternpost, and for the bulkhead <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> if one is fitted.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> map and <b>counters</b> {{were much}} {{improved}} color {{versions of the}} earlier black and white components in the original magazine title. The game's map portrayed an area of central South Vietnam, divided into hexagons measuring 50 scale metres <b>across.</b> <b>The</b> <b>counters</b> represented squads of infantry as well as specialist soldiers such as medics, artillery observers, snipers, etc. Two sets of rules are included, for the Basic Game and the more complex Standard Game.|$|R

5000|$|Returning {{downstairs and}} {{entering}} the shop, Murray beheld [...] "the carnage {{of the night}} {{stretched out on the}} floor". The [...] "narrow premises ... so floated with gore that it was hardly possible to escape the pollution of blood in picking out a path to the front door". [...] First he saw James Gowan, the apprentice, lying on the floor about five feet from the stairs, just inside the shop door. The bones of the boy's face were smashed, his blood was dripping onto the floor, and his brains had been pulverised and cast about <b>the</b> walls and <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>counters.</b>|$|R
2500|$|This {{implies that}} a [...] "traditional combination" [...] of bread, beer, cheese, and pickle was popular before {{rationing}} in the United Kingdom (during and after World War II). In 1956, author Adrian Bell reported: [...] "There's a pub {{quite close to}} where I live where ... all you need say is, 'Ploughboy's Lunch, Harry, please'. And {{in a matter of}} minutes a tray is handed <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> to you on which is a good square hunk of bread, a lump of butter and a wedge of cheese, and pickled onions, along with your pint of beer". Only one year later, in June 1957, another edition of the Monthly Bulletin of the Brewers' Society, referred to a ploughman's lunch using exactly that name, and said that it consisted of [...] "cottage bread, cheese, lettuce, hard-boiled eggs, cold sausages and, of course, beer". The Glasgow newspaper The Bulletin from 15 April 1958 and The Times from 29 April 1958 refer to a ploughman's lunch consisting of bread, cheese and pickle.|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> banking {{transactions}} <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>counters</b> were adversely affected and many branches and commercial establishments {{were unable to}} function from late evening of 26 July 2005. [...] The state government declared 27 and 28 July as public holidays. ATM networks of several banks, which included the State Bank of India, the nation's largest national bank; ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, and several foreign banks like Citibank and HSBC, stopped functioning from the afternoon of 26 July 2005 at all the centres of Mumbai. ATM transactions could not be carried out in several parts of India on 26 July or 27 July due to failure of the connectivity with their central systems located in Mumbai.|$|R
50|$|The game {{continues}} {{from the kitchen}} with Sarge and a small squad fighting their way <b>across</b> <b>the</b> kitchen <b>counter,</b> finding a portal back to the plastic Jungle (Level 1).

60|$|The cashier hesitated. Then {{he leaned}} <b>across</b> <b>the</b> broad {{mahogany}} <b>counter</b> towards Laverick. One {{of the men}} who appeared to form part of the escort detached himself from them and approached a few steps nearer.|$|R
60|$|He was right. The Russian {{general was}} there, chatting affably <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> about the weather.|$|E

60|$|Carter strolled <b>across</b> to <b>the</b> glove <b>counter</b> {{in order}} to shoot a few minutes on the wing. His need for gloves was genuine; he had {{forgotten}} to bring a pair with him. But his action hardly calls for apology, because {{he had never heard}} of glove-counter flirtations.|$|R
50|$|A Soviet spy (Perkins) {{is on an}} {{official}} mission to obtain sensitive information from NATO about military mobilization.

6000|$|... "I've {{heard of}} it; let's see:" [...] and Mr. Trebooze--for it was he--put his hand <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> unceremoniously, and clawed up some.|$|E

50|$|All {{the boats}} are 28' hull length. From {{there was the}} option of a bow sprit, {{as well as a}} swimgrid, which added to the total length. The boats are all {{equipped}} with a Flying Bridge Helm station, and some are also equipped with a secondary helm inside the cabin. In the cabin there is a head that also doubles as a shower stall. <b>Across</b> from <b>the</b> head is a large storage closet that has one shelf, and a hanger for clothes. In front of the closet there is a long counter. On this counter was a sink. Some boats also had a propane stove, others had a helm station mounted to the forward of <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> and had no stove. <b>Across</b> from <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> was a small table and bench seats, they also folded down like most RVs into a bed. Ahead of that is the V berth with enough room to sleep two.|$|R
5000|$|Security Layer 2: Issuance Check Out/In. When {{an asset}} {{is removed from}} inventory, we know it {{has been removed from}} shelf, but {{ownership}} has to be transferred from a “storekeeper” to a new owner, a soldier or guard or asset guardian. This is done using ruggedized Apple iPads known as gRaps® that have a RuBee embedded reader. Tags are read as the asset is passed <b>across</b> <b>the</b> check out <b>counter.</b>|$|R

60|$|Jethro {{smiled and}} {{squeezed}} her arm again, {{and then they}} were in the corridor of the famous Pelican Hotel, hazy with cigar smoke and filled with politicians. Some were standing, hanging on to pillars, gesticulating, some were ranged in benches along the wall, and a chosen few were in chairs grouped around the spittoons. Upon the appearance of Jethro's party, the talk was hushed, the groups gave way, and they accomplished a kind of triumphal march to the desk. The clerk, descrying them, desisted abruptly from a conversation <b>across</b> <b>the</b> cigar <b>counter,</b> and with all the form of a ceremony dipped the pen with a flourish into the ink and handed it to Jethro.|$|R
50|$|An orbital layer {{has been}} added to Beyond Earth. Satellites {{launched}} around a faction's orbital layer provide bonuses to the tiles below them. For example if a player launches a solar collector, any tile below this collector will provide the player with an additional energy bonus. In the later game, some satellites can serve as weaponry or can help transport units <b>across</b> <b>the</b> map. To <b>counter</b> orbital units artillery style units can shoot them down.|$|R
50|$|The {{mandate of}} MNDF's Air Wing {{will be to}} protect and {{safeguard}} the Maldivian Airspace, to monitor the illegal and suspicious activities within Maldivian waters and to conduct search, rescue and surveillance operations.

60|$|While we were talking, a girl--evidently no customer--had {{come into}} the shop, and the face and bearing of Mr. Shaynor changed. She leaned {{confidently}} <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter.</b>|$|E
50|$|Common Heather and Common Juniper {{are found}} in the dry areas, and the more marshy {{wetlands}} are home to Erica, Purple Moor Grass, Bog Myrtle and Marsh Gentian. The spread of grass <b>across</b> <b>the</b> area is <b>countered</b> by allowing a flock of sheep to graze, by mowing and sod cutting. The heath area is surrounded by forests. The transition area towards the valley of the Kleine Dommel has several unusual forms of plant life and is also important for many animal species.|$|R
5000|$|Ashley also {{produced}} {{some of the}} ONCE Festivals most memorable and scandalous posters, including one for its fourth iteration {{in the spring of}} 1964. It is a 10” x 16’’ sheet of paper, folded accordion-style into a 10” x 2” rectangle. unfolded, it shows a nude woman lying <b>across</b> <b>the</b> lunch <b>counter</b> of Ann Arbor’s Red’s Rite Spot, discreetly shielded in one place by a cake dish. Behind her are ONCE composers Mumma, Robert Ashley, Scavarda and Cacioppo, dressed in dark suits and looking like gangsters. The reverse side of the sheet of paper was printed with the program for the festival. According to Robert Ashley the poster was a “tribute to the Judson Dance Theater, which had recently restaged Manet’s Olympia to great critical dislike in The New York Times.” ...|$|R
60|$|Overstrained {{etiquette}} at last gave way. It is {{not known}} who first overstepped the bounds of punctilio; but the consequences were immediate. Buck Malone, of the Mulberry Hills, with a Dewey-like swiftness, got an eight-inch gun swung round from his hurricane deck. But McManus's simile must be the torpedo. He glided in under the guns and slipped a scant three inches of knife blade between the ribs of the Mulberry Hill cruiser. Meanwhile Brick Cleary, a devotee to strategy, had skimmed <b>across</b> <b>the</b> lunch <b>counter</b> and thrown <b>the</b> switch of the electrics, leaving the combat to be waged {{by the light of}} gunfire alone. Dutch Mike crawled from his haven and ran into the street crying for the watch instead of for a Shakespeare to immortalize the Cimmerian shindy.|$|R
