5|$|The {{fossil record}} {{shows that the}} pelican lineage has existed for at least 30million years; the oldest known pelican fossil was found in Early Oligocene {{deposits}} at the Luberon in southeastern France and is remarkably similar to modern forms. Its beak is almost complete and is morphologically identical to that of present-day pelicans, showing that this advanced feeding apparatus was already in existence at the time. An Early Miocene fossil has been named Miopelecanus gracilis {{on the basis of}} certain features originally considered unique but later thought to lie within the range of inter-specific variation in Pelecanus. The Late Eocene Protopelicanus may be a pelecaniform or suliform – or a similar <b>aquatic</b> <b>bird</b> such as a pseudotooth (Pelagornithidae). The supposed Miocene pelican Liptornis from Patagonia is a nomen dubium (of doubtful validity), being based on fragments providing insufficient evidence to support a valid description.|$|E

25|$|The current <b>Aquatic</b> <b>Bird</b> House {{opened on}} September 24, 1964, on the {{foundation}} of the original house, which was opened on November 8, 1899, {{with the rest of the}} zoo. The building features a multitude of mostly open-fronted enclosures mainly focusing on coastal and wetland habitats and the species that rely on them. Scarlet ibises, roseate spoonbills, a Madagascar crested ibis, giant wood rail, pied avocets, Baer's pochards, common terns, African spoonbills, silver teals and Forster's terns are among the residents here. The exhibit also features an outdoor pond home to a flock of American flamingos and Orinoco geese, and a large aviary home to lesser adjutant storks. The zoo is one of only three zoos in North America working with the endangered storks and has bred them several times, including the hatching of two chicks on June 27 and August 15, 2015. The <b>Aquatic</b> <b>Bird</b> House is also home to another endangered stork species: the Storm's stork. The zoo is one of only two in the United States working with this species; the other being the San Diego Zoo. In May 2014, the zoo opened a new nocturnal enclosure for a North Island brown kiwi in the building, and in May 2015, a colony of little blue penguins from the Taronga Zoo were added.|$|E
500|$|The red-throated loon (North America) or {{red-throated diver}} (Britain and Ireland) (Gavia stellata) is a migratory <b>aquatic</b> <b>bird</b> {{found in the}} {{northern}} hemisphere. The most widely distributed member of the loon or diver family, it breeds primarily in Arctic regions, and winters in northern coastal waters. Ranging from [...] in length, the red-throated loon is the smallest and lightest of the world's loons. In winter, it is a nondescript bird, greyish above fading to white below. During the breeding season, it acquires the distinctive reddish throat patch which {{is the basis for}} its common name. Fish form the bulk of its diet, though amphibians, invertebrates, and plant material are sometimes eaten as well. A monogamous species, the red-throated loon forms long-term pair bonds. Both members of the pair help to build the nest, incubate the eggs (generally two per clutch), and feed the hatched young.|$|E

The formation of the point permitted the place to be circled on three of its sides, and the progress of the boat was so noiseless as to remove any apprehensions from an alarm through sound.

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{results from a}} large-scale investigation of bird use in the Scottish Islands. Although avian archaeology has sometimes been overlooked, {{it has become increasingly}} clear that birds were a small but often important component of past diets. This is particularly relevant when it is considered that a diverse range of <b>birds,</b> and particularly <b>aquatic</b> <b>birds,</b> thrive in coastal and island locations. Large colonies of gregariously breeding seabirds provided a concentrated resource which could be targeted intensely for both meat and eggs. The use of <b>aquatic</b> <b>birds</b> in the Scottish Islands is therefore integral to holistically understanding diet and resource use in these settings. <b>Aquatic</b> <b>birds</b> would have offered a wide variety of dietary resources to prehistoric populations including meat and eggs, but also oil and fat. The exploitation of seabirds endured throughout Scottish Island prehistoric living from the Mesolithic to the Late Iron Age (and much further beyond), within a picture of resource use that shows both continuity and flexibility in the exploitation of <b>aquatic</b> <b>birds.</b> The acquisition of these resources required the development of several species and habitat-specific fowling techniques that demonstrate in-depth understanding of the avian resources being exploited. Local hunting and targeted fowling trips to more distant locations in the landscape and seascape are indicated by the zooarchaeological data. Exploitation of <b>aquatic</b> <b>birds</b> displays a summer focus but as part of a year-round fowling calendar, whilst preservation for later consumption may provide information on another element of the dietary picture...|$|R

60|$|This was all Neb wanted. The fellow had feet shaped a {{good deal}} like any other <b>aquatic</b> <b>bird,</b> with the {{essential}} difference, however, that no small part of his foundation had been laid abaft the perpendicular of the tendon Achilles, and, being without shoes, he could nearly encircle a small spar in his grasp. Often and often had I seen Neb run out on a top-sail-yard, the ship pitching heavily, catching at the lift; {{and it was a}} mere trifle after that, to run out on a spar as large as the Wallingford's main-boom. A tolerably distinctive scream from Chloe, first apprised me that the negro was in motion. Looking in that direction, I saw him walking steadily along the boom, notwithstanding Drewett's loud remonstrances, and declarations that he wanted no assistance, until he reached the spot where the young gentleman stood grasping the lift, with his legs submitting to more tremour than was convenient. Neb now grinned, looked as amiable as possible, held out his hand, and revealed the object of his visit.|$|E
60|$|We may {{at least}} conclude, {{that the amount}} of {{modification}} which animals and plants have undergone under domestication does not correspond with {{the degree to which they}} have been subjected to changed circumstances. As we know the parentage of domesticated birds far better than of most quadrupeds, we will glance through the list. The pigeon has varied in Europe more than almost any other bird; yet it is a native species, and has not been exposed to any extraordinary change of conditions. The fowl has varied equally, or almost equally, with the pigeon, and is a native of the hot jungles of India. Neither the peacock, a native of the same country, nor the guinea-fowl, an inhabitant of the dry deserts of Africa, has varied at all, or only in colour. The turkey, from Mexico, has varied but little. The duck, on the other hand, a native of Europe, has yielded some well-marked races; and as this is an <b>aquatic</b> <b>bird,</b> it must have been subjected to a far more serious change in its habits than the pigeon or even the fowl, which nevertheless have varied in a much higher degree. The goose, a native of Europe and aquatic like the duck, has varied less than any other domesticated bird, except the peacock.|$|E

40|$|Background: Wild <b>aquatic</b> <b>birds</b> are {{considered}} as reservoir hosts for Newcastle disease viruses (NDVs) and may act as vectors for transferring these viruses to poultry, causing outbreaks of disease. Recent studies {{suggested that the}} velogenic viruses arise from avirulent strains originating from wild birds. Objectives: The primary objective {{of this study was}} to determine whether the <b>aquatic</b> <b>birds</b> of Khozestan province were infected with NDV. Materials and Methods: In winter, 24 Muscovey ducks from Shoshtar, 20 geese from Dezfoul and 51 geese from Khorramshahr (<b>Aquatic</b> <b>birds</b> of Khozestan province) were bled, and birds' sera were collected and used in HI assay and antibody titer to NDV were determined. Beta procedure of hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay was performed in U-bottomed 96 -well microtiter plates with 0. 5 % chicken erythrocytes. Results: All serum samples tested for antibodies against hemagglutinin by HI assay had positive results, and all of these birds had high levels of antibody titer to the NDV. Conclusion: The results in the present study clearly showed that the <b>aquatic</b> <b>birds</b> of Khozestan province population in Iran carries NDVs, and may act as one of the important reservoirs for this virus. So it was concluded that detection and elimination of these birds can be a valuable tool for the control of Newcastle Disease outbreaks...|$|R
