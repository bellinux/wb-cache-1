We investigated whether this was mediated through bile acids acting to impair steroid clearance by inhibiting glucocorticoid metabolism by 5 &# 946;-reductase. Methods The effect of bile acids on glucocorticoid metabolism was studied in vitro in hepatic subcellular fractions and hepatoma cells, allowing quantitation of the kinetics and transcript abundance of 5 &# 946;-reductase. Metabolism was subsequently examined in vivo in rats following dietary manipulation or bile duct ligation. Finally, glucocorticoid metabolism was assessed in humans with obstructive jaundice. Results In rat hepatic cytosol, chenodeoxycholic acid competitively inhibited 5 &# 946;-reductase (Ki 9. 19 ± 0. 40 μM) and reduced its transcript abundance (in H 4 iiE cells) and promoter activity (reporter system, HepG 2 cells).

40|$|Infiltration of {{inflammatory}} macrophages into adipose tissues {{with the}} progression of obesity triggers insulin resistance and obesity-related metabolic diseases. We recently reported that macrophage-derived apoptosis inhibitor of macrophage (AIM) protein is increased in blood in line with obesity progression and is incorporated into adipocytes, thereby inducing lipolysis in adipose tissue. Here we show that such a response {{is required for the}} recruitment of adipose tissue macrophages. In vitro, AIM-dependent lipolysis induced an efflux of palmitic and stearic acids from 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes, thereby stimulating chemokine production in adipocytes via activation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4). In vivo administration of recombinant AIM to TLR 4 -deficient (TLR 4 −/−) mice resulted in induction of lipolysis without chemokine production in adipose tissues. Consistently, mRNA levels for the chemokines that affect macrophages were far lower in AIM-deficient (AIM−/−) than in wild-type (AIM+/+) obese adipose tissue. This reduction in chemokine production resulted in a marked prevention of inflammatory macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue in obese AIM−/− mice, although these mice showed more advanced obesity than AIM+/+ mice on a high-fat diet. Diminished macrophage infiltration resulted in decreased inflammation locally and systemically in obese AIM−/− mice, thereby protecting them from insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. These results indicate that the increase in blood AIM is a critical event for the initiation of macrophage recruitment into adipose tissue, which is followed by insulin resistance. Thus, <b>AIM</b> <b>suppression</b> might be therapeutically applicable for the prevention of obesity-related metabolic disorders...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Behçet's disease (BD) is {{an enigmatic}} {{inflammatory}} disorder, with vasculitis (perivasculitis) underlying pathophysiology of its multisystemic affections. Venous pathology and thrombotic complications are hallmarks of BD. However, {{it has been}} increasingly recognized that cardiac involvement and arterial complications (aneurysms, pseudoaneurysms, rupture and thrombosis) are {{important part of the}} course of BD. Pericarditis, myocardial (diastolic and/or systolic dysfunction), valvular and coronary (thrombosis, aneurysms, rupture) involvement, intracardiac thrombi (predominantly right-sided) are, probably, the most frequent cardiac manifestations. Treatment of cardiovascular involvement in BD is largely empirical and <b>aimed</b> at <b>suppression</b> of vasculitis.

40|$|The {{question}} that motivated {{this study was}} to investigate the relation between trait anxiety, emotions and memory control.

After learning associations between neutral words and emotional scenes (negative, positive and neutral), participants were shown a word and were requested either to think about the associated scene or to block it out from mind. Finally, in a test phase, participants were again shown each word and asked to recall the paired scene. The results show that memory control is influenced by high trait anxiety and emotions. Low trait anxiety individuals showed a memory suppression effect, whereas there was a lack of memory suppression in high trait anxious individuals, especially for emotionally negative scenes. Thus, we suggest that individuals with anxiety may have difficulty exerting cognitive control over memories with a negative valence. These findings provide evidence that memory suppression can be impaired by anxiety thus highlighting the crucial relation between cognitive control, emotions and individual differences in regulating emotions...|$|R

Methods—In this randomized, controlled, blinded pilot study, the effect of 1 -Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over right-hemispheric Broca homolog in subjects with poststroke aphasia in the subacute stage was examined. According to their group allocation, patients received, in addition to conventional speech and language therapy, multiple sessions of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation either over the right-hemispheric inferior frontal gyrus (intervention group) or over the vertex (control group). The primary outcome parameter was the change in laterality indices as quantified by activation positron emission tomography before and after the 2 -week intervention period. The clinical efficacy was evaluated with the Aachen Aphasia Test. Results—At baseline, no group differences were discovered for age, laterality indices, or mean Aachen Aphasia Test scores. Four patients were lost to follow-up, but none due to side effects of the transcranial magnetic stimulation.

40|$|Tumor {{necrosis}} factor (TNF) is {{an important}} factor in various acute and chronic neurodegenerative disorders. In retinal ischemia, we show early, transient upregulation of TNF, TNF receptor 1 (TNF-R 1), and TNF-R 2 6 hr after reperfusion preceding neuronal cell loss. To assess the specific role of TNF and its receptors, we compared ischemia-reperfusion- induced retinal damage in mice deficient for TNF-R 1, TNF-R 2, or TNF by quantifying neuronal cell loss 8 d after the insult. Surprisingly, TNF deficiency did not affect overall cell loss, yet absence of TNF-R 1 led to a strong reduction of neurodegeneration and lack of TNF-R 2 led to an enhancement of neurodegeneration, indicative of TNF-independent and TNF-dependent processes in the retina, with TNF-R 1 augmenting neuronal death and TNF-R 2 promoting neuroprotection. Western blot analyses of retinas revealed that reduction of neuronal cell loss in TNFR 1 -/- animals correlated with the presence of activated Akt/ protein kinase B (PKB). Inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase signaling pathway reverted neuroprotection in TNFR 1 -deficient mice, indicating an instrumental role of Akt/ PKB in neuroprotection and TNF-R 2 dependence of this pathway.

The disease usually develops after puberty, and the prevalence of HS in Europe is approximately 1 % with a female preponderance of 3 : 1. HS is associated with smoking and being overweight To {{learn more about the}} cause of HS, we investigated the association of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and HS. The prevalence of HS in our IBD cohort was significantly higher than in the general population (6. 8 %– 10. 6 % versus 1 %– 2 %). We also identified two genes that are associated with HS and IBD. Furthermore, we compared the constitution of the hair follicles of HS skin with that of healthy controls. Our findings do not support the hypothesis that the hair follicles of HS patients are more fragile than those of healthy individuals. A lot of HS patients experience feelings of depression and shame.
