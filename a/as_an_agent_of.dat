5|$|Automatic {{closure of}} public schools which racially {{integrate}} — The legislation required that any school which integrated (voluntarily or not) must be immediately and automatically closed. However, the governor was given the discretion to take over integrated school(s) and reopen the school(s) on a segregated basis rather than close the entire district. Integrated schools {{did not have to}} stay closed, however. A school district could petition the governor to take over one or more schools (or the entire district) that had closed and reopen them as segregated schools. Whether exercising his discretion or acting on a petition from the school district, the governor was authorized to act only <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>agent</b> <b>of</b> the Assembly. The governor was also required to try to persuade the African American child to return to his or her racially segregated school, so that the schools could reopen on a segregated basis.|$|E
5|$|Robert rewarded Ranulf for {{his advice}} during the {{invasion}} by entrusting {{him with the}} administration of the see of Lisieux. After Robert's defeat by Henry at Tinchebray in 1106, the bishop {{was among the first to}} make his peace with Henry, and returned to Durham. He retired from political life. Henry had already replaced him with Roger of Salisbury an able financier who was infinitely more acceptable to the nation. Although some historians have theorised that Ranulf's time in Normandy was <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>agent</b> <b>of</b> Henry, it appears that Ranulf was mainly looking out for his own interests and those of his family.|$|E
5|$|That night, as Sunnydale sleeps, white wisps float {{from each}} person's mouth to a belfry, where they {{settle in the}} box from Buffy's dream as ghoulish {{skeletal}} figures, with metal-toothed grins and impeccable black suits, look on. In the morning, Buffy and Willow discover {{they are unable to}} speak and become visibly distressed; they soon discover that everybody is unable to speak. The group gathers at Giles' where they see that the news is reporting that Sunnydale is suffering from an epidemic of laryngitis. Buffy and Riley, each concerned that chaos will ensue, find each other attempting to keep order on the streets. For the first time, Buffy sees Riley in his paramilitary role <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>agent</b> <b>of</b> The Initiative; he in turn is unaware that she is the Slayer. They exchange a look and then their first kiss, before parting to continue their efforts.|$|E

5|$|In rabbinical tradition, {{the age of}} Isaac at {{the time}} of binding is taken to be 37, which {{contrasts}} with common portrayals of Isaac as a child. The rabbis also thought that the reason for the death of Sarah was the news of the intended sacrifice of Isaac. The sacrifice of Isaac is cited in appeals for the mercy of God in later Jewish traditions. The post-biblical Jewish interpretations often elaborate the role of Isaac beyond the biblical description and primarily focus on Abraham's intended sacrifice of Isaac, called the aqedah ("binding"). According to a version of these interpretations, Isaac died in the sacrifice and was revived. According to many accounts of Aggadah, unlike the Bible, it is Satan who is testing Isaac <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>agent</b> <b>of</b> God. Isaac's willingness to follow God's command at the cost of his death has been a model for many Jews who preferred martyrdom to violation of the Jewish law.|$|E
