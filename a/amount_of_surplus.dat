Many of the best-preserved fortifications are in the Upper Rock Nature Reserve, a conservation area that covers about 40% of the area of Gibraltar. A few of the Upper Rock batteries have been preserved intact; {{all three of the}} 5.25-inch guns at Princess Anne's Battery are still in place, making it {{the only place in the}} world where a complete 5.25-inch battery can still be seen. The 9.2 inch guns at Breakneck, Lord Airey's and O'Hara's Batteries are still in situ and can now be visited. Elsewhere, most of the ordnance has been removed. Two surviving 6-inch guns remain at Devil's Gap Battery, one of which is the gun that engaged a German U-boat in August 1917. At Napier of Magdala Battery one of the two 100-ton RML 17.72 inch guns is still in situ and has been restored, along with a 3.7 inch quick-firing anti-aircraft gun. The site is now run by the Gibraltar Tourist Board in conjunction with the Nature Reserve.|$|E

With rising property tax values, the state decided to withhold an additional 4 million of county generated tax revenues to pay for programs for troubled children throughout California. Marin officials claimed the state was forcing the county to shoulder an unfair degree of state oriented funding. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed two bills pushed forward by Migden to resolve the issue. Migden's third bill passed and resulted in cutting the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>surplus</b> funds the county will annually pay to the state by half.

60|$|During this prostration two {{essential}} elements of prosperity have been most abundant--labor and capital. Both have been largely unemployed. Where security has been undoubted, capital has been attainable at very moderate rates. Where labor has been wanted, {{it has been found}} in abundance, at cheap rates compared with what--of necessaries and comforts of life--could be purchased with the wages demanded. Two great elements of prosperity, therefore, have not been denied us. A third might be added: Our soil and climate are unequaled, within the limits of any contiguous territory under one nationality, for its variety of products to feed and clothe a people and in the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>surplus</b> to spare to feed less favored peoples. Therefore, with these facts in view, {{it seems to me that}} wise statesmanship, at this session of Congress, would dictate legislation ignoring the past; directing in proper channels these great elements of prosperity to any people. Debt, debt abroad, is the only element that can, with always a sound currency, enter into our affairs to cause any continued depression in the industries and prosperity of our people.|$|E
60|$|The {{report of}} the Secretary of the Treasury, which by law is made {{directly}} to Congress, and forms no part of this message, will show the receipts and expenditures of the Government for the last fiscal year, the amount received from each source of revenue, and the amount paid out {{for each of the}} Departments of Government. It will be observed from this report that the amount of receipts over expenditures has been but $2,344,882.30 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1874, and that for the current fiscal year the estimated receipts over expenditures will not much exceed $9,000,000. In view of the large national debt existing and the obligation to add 1 per cent per annum to the sinking fund, a sum amounting now to over $34,000,000 per annum, I submit whether revenues should not be increased or expenditures diminished to reach this <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>surplus.</b> Not to provide for the sinking fund is a partial failure to comply with the contracts and obligations of the Government. At the last session of Congress a very considerable reduction was made in rates of taxation and in the number of articles submitted to taxation; the question may well be asked, whether or not, in some instances, unwisely. In connection with this subject, too, I venture the opinion that the means of collecting the revenue, especially from imports, have been so embarrassed by legislation as to make it questionable whether or not large amounts are not lost by failure to collect, to the direct loss of the Treasury and to the prejudice of the interests of honest importers and taxpayers.|$|E

In other words, more storage is taking place, lowering the overall surpluses within the system, {{but this is not}} translated to increased production. Note that when a PHS-plant serves more load hours (i.e. when it stands lower in merit order), this automatically leads to lowered upper reservoir levels, which in turn allows for a storage increase. However, serving more load hours also implicates less water stored at peak times. This explains why the electricity systems with Veytaux implemented in middle load (i.e., the PPM-scenarios) have a higher LOLP compared to the ones with all PHS-plants serving in peak-load. Those results illustrate that it matters where the plants are functioning in the merit order.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 Colleges and {{universities}} must be continually seeking means {{to improve their}} financial management. One improvement would be to lessen the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> monies the state-owned university reverts to the state {{at the end of}} the fiscal year. Such reversion is caused by numerous departments, each with financial autonomy, incurring greater <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>surpluses</b> than those departments ending with deficits. Whatever means are developed to control this reversion should, however, not lessen departmental financial autonomy. Budgets and budgetary control are defined and are related to the concepts of feedback and management-by-exception. These concepts provide a model of budgetary control within the university environment and explain the workings of performance, measurement, comparison, evaluation, and the taking of action to affect plans or performance. With feedback and utilizing the management-by-exception principle, a type of budget control indicator might be developed to affect the necessary control without reducing autonomy. This budget control indicator could provide the means whereby the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>surpluses</b> or deficits at the departmental level would be lessened. It would be relevant to determine a point in time which would permit the identification and hence reduction <b>of</b> potential <b>surpluses</b> or perhaps change the trend leading to deficits. The reduction <b>of</b> a potential <b>surplus</b> at an early enough point in time would permit some funding of significant projects, which otherwise might never have received funding, rather than let the money revert. The indicator was determined from a historical study of the expenditure patterns of a population of 98 Oregon State University departments. The results obtained for 1967 - 68 indicated that using two-thirds of one standard deviation from the mean of the break-even departments in the month of January would provide the prediction of 50 percent of those departments ending with a surplus and 70 percent of those ending with a deficit. The error of predicting that a department would incur a surplus or deficit when it actually ended breaking even was 41 percent, while the number <b>of</b> ultimate <b>surplus</b> or deficit departments predicted to break even was 38 percent. An early prediction of 50 to 70 percent of those departments which ultimately incur a surplus or deficit is significant in that present practices leave this unknown until it is too late to prevent the reversion. If a smaller predictive range (one-half of one standard deviation) is used, the percent predictions increase, however there is also an increase in the error of saying a department is deviant when it is not. Defining a department as breaking even if its expenditures were within 400 of its budget provided the best criterion for the later prediction <b>of</b> <b>surplus</b> or deficit departments...|$|R
