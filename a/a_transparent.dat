5|$|Because gallium wets {{glass or}} porcelain, gallium {{can be used}} to create {{brilliant}} mirrors. When the wetting action of gallium-alloys is not desired (as in Galinstan glass thermometers), the glass must be protected with <b>a</b> <b>transparent</b> layer of gallium(III) oxide.|$|E

50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is 13-16 mm and 15 mm for females. The forewings are dark brown with a light purp1e gloss and <b>a</b> white <b>transparent</b> a1most triangular band. The hindwings have <b>a</b> white <b>transparent</b> band occupying {{three quarters of the}} wing.|$|R

5|$|A {{circular}} {{hole was}} {{cut into the}} backdrop and covered with <b>a</b> <b>transparent</b> material. A strong light behind this hole represented the moon. The light was occasionally manipulated to suggest the passage of clouds. Gautier and St. Georges wanted the pool {{to be made of}} large mirrors but Pillet rejected this idea because of its cost. In the 1868 revival, however, mirrors were acquired for this scene.|$|E
5|$|Another {{example of}} {{differentiation}} of snake scales is <b>a</b> <b>transparent</b> scale called the brille or spectacle which covers {{the eye of}} the snake. The brille {{is often referred to as}} a fused eyelid. It is shed as part of the old skin during moulting.|$|E

5|$|Conceived by Amusement Vision head Toshihiro Nagoshi, Super Monkey Ball {{involves}} guiding <b>a</b> <b>transparent</b> ball containing {{one of four}} monkeys—AiAi, MeeMee, Baby, and GonGon—across {{a series}} of maze-like platforms. The player must reach the goal without falling off or letting the timer reach zero {{to advance to the}} next stage. There are also several multiplayer modes: independent minigames as well as extensions of the main single-player game.|$|E
5|$|Indium(III) oxide and indium {{tin oxide}} (ITO) are used as <b>a</b> <b>transparent</b> {{conductive}} coating on glass substrates in electroluminescent panels. Indium tin oxide {{is used as a}} light filter in low-pressure sodium-vapor lamps. The infrared radiation is reflected back into the lamp, which increases the temperature within the tube and improves the performance of the lamp.|$|E
5|$|Most {{reviews of}} the {{collection}} were positive, applauding how Dalrymple had utilised his experiences to create a work that gives <b>a</b> <b>transparent</b> look at poverty in England. The main detraction that reviewers had for the collection was that Dalrymple often became too opinionated in his writing while {{he was trying to}} get across the results of his experiences.|$|E

5|$|The {{bodywork}} for {{the concept}} car displayed in 1988 was hand built from aluminium by Park Sheet Metal, a specialist automotive engineering company that manufactures concept cars and low-volume, niche models for various manufacturers, including Bentley. QCR Coatings undertook final {{painting of the}} bodyshell in silver. The concept also featured electrically operated scissor doors and <b>a</b> <b>transparent</b> engine cover {{to show off the}} V12 engine.|$|E
5|$|There is no perspectival {{order in}} the foreground; instead it {{comprises}} {{a series of small}} motifs wherein proportion and terrestrial logic are abandoned. Bosch presents the viewer with gigantic ducks playing with tiny humans under the cover of oversized fruit; fish walking on land while birds dwell in the water; a passionate couple encased in an amniotic fluid bubble; and a man inside of a red fruit staring at a mouse in <b>a</b> <b>transparent</b> cylinder.|$|E
5|$|A common {{misconception}} is that {{signs are}} iconically self-explanatory, {{that they are}} <b>a</b> <b>transparent</b> imitation of what they mean, or even that they are pantomime. In fact, many signs bear no resemblance to their referent, either because they were originally arbitrary symbols or because their iconicity has been obscured over time. Even so, in ASL iconicity plays a significant role; {{a high percentage of}} signs resemble their referents in some way. This {{may be due to the}} fact that the medium of sign—three-dimensional space—naturally allows more iconicity than oral language.|$|E

5|$|Above {{the layer}} of {{metallic}} hydrogen lies <b>a</b> <b>transparent</b> interior atmosphere of hydrogen. At this depth, the pressure and temperature are above hydrogen's critical pressure of 1.2858 MPa and critical temperature of only 32.938K. In this state, there are no distinct liquid and gas phases—hydrogen {{is said to be}} in a supercritical fluid state. It is convenient to treat hydrogen as gas in the upper layer extending downward from the cloud layer to a depth of about 1,000km, and as liquid in deeper layers. Physically, there is no clear boundary—the gas smoothly becomes hotter and denser as one descends.|$|E
5|$|Also, third eyelid. <b>A</b> <b>transparent</b> or {{translucent}} third eyelid that {{is drawn}} across the eye for protection, to moisten it while maintaining vision. The nictitating membrane also covers {{the eye and}} acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. With the exception of pigeons {{and a few other}} species, most birds blink only with their nictitating membrane, and when not sleeping, use the eyelids chiefly only when the eye is threatened with some foreign matter.|$|E
5|$|Among animals, {{there exists}} a single known example of an {{apparently}} freely-rotating structure, though it is used for digestion rather than propulsion: the crystalline style of certain bivalves and gastropods. The style consists of <b>a</b> <b>transparent</b> glycoprotein rod which is continuously formed in a cilia-lined sac and extends into the stomach. The cilia rotate the rod, so that it becomes wrapped in strands of mucus. As the rod slowly dissolves in the stomach, it releases digestive enzymes. Estimates {{of the speed of}} rotation of the style in vivo vary significantly, and it is unclear if the style is rotated continuously or intermittently.|$|E

5|$|An {{undertaking}} of {{the restoration}} team was {{that everything would}} be handled in <b>a</b> <b>transparent</b> fashion, that reporters, art historians and others with a bona fide interest should have ready access to information and to view the work. However, a single company, Nippon Television Network Corporation, had sole photography rights. Michael Kimmelman, chief art critic of The New York Times, wrote, in 1991, that the criticism of {{the restoration of the}} ceiling and lunettes was in part fuelled by the Nippon Television Network's reluctance to make public those photographs that they had taken by exclusive right, which had recorded every stage of the process and which were the only solid evidence that the work was being done appropriately.|$|E
5|$|Another {{music video}} for the Maanstudio remix {{version of the}} song was shot by Ciprian Strugariu and {{uploaded}} onto MediaPro Music's YouTube channel on 9 December 2011. Andra Moga and Violeta Irimia were credited for styling and make-up, respectively. The visual starts with angle shots of the singer lying on sand, followed by her walking on a field wearing a black dress. Subsequently, the singer poses {{in front of a}} stonewall and performs to the song sporting <b>a</b> <b>transparent</b> jacket and a black leotard. The last scenes show her on a swing, swimming while a sea storm takes place, and her posing in front of a body of water with a black bodysuit on.|$|E
5|$|Bowman {{finds himself}} in a bedroom {{appointed}} in the neoclassical style. He sees, and then becomes, older versions of himself, first standing in the bedroom, middle-aged and still in his spacesuit, then dressed in leisure attire and eating dinner, and finally as an old man lying in the bed. A monolith appears {{at the foot of}} the bed, and as Bowman reaches for it, he is transformed into a fetus enclosed in <b>a</b> <b>transparent</b> orb of light. The new being floats in space beside the Earth, gazing at it.|$|E
