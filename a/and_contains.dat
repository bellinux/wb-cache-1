5|$|There are {{two types}} of chromatin. Euchromatin is the less compact DNA form, <b>and</b> <b>contains</b> genes that are {{frequently}} expressed by the cell. The other type, heterochromatin, is the more compact form, <b>and</b> <b>contains</b> DNA that is infrequently transcribed. This structure is further categorized into facultative heterochromatin, consisting of genes that are organized as heterochromatin only in certain cell types or at certain stages of development, and constitutive heterochromatin that consists of chromosome structural components such as telomeres and centromeres. During interphase the chromatin organizes itself into discrete individual patches, called chromosome territories. Active genes, which are generally found in the euchromatic region of the chromosome, tend to be located towards the chromosome's territory boundary.|$|E
