This brings the staff {{out of the game}} and back to the reality of losing their jobs. Michael tries to win them back, but accidentally skips to the game's conclusion, revealing that Phyllis's character was the murderer. Although everyone else goes back to work even more stressed out, Michael refuses to give up, and continues playing the game with Dwight. After the game, Andy and Erin meet at the receptionist desk, where Erin asks him about their upcoming date. Andy tries to sound out whether the date is real or fictional by suggesting that they go to Savannah for their date. Erin remarks that Savannah is <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>away,</b> but does so in character; confused by this, Andy slips up and indicates that the [...] "date" [...] was just part of the game. Erin says she was also just playing, but appears humiliated as she walks away and later reveals to the camera crew she thought the date was real.|$|E

The evil mystic betrayed her throwing the latter into her opposite number merging the two Orb wielders into one physical body with which Tapestry could draw near limitless quantities of power from.

40|$|Automatic speech {{recognition}} (ASR) systems have become hugely successful {{in recent years}} - we have become accustomed to speech interfaces across all kinds of devices. However, despite the huge impact ASR has had on the way we interact with technology, {{it is out of}} reach for {{a significant portion of the}} world's population. This is because these systems rely on a variety of manually-generated resources - like transcripts and pronunciation dictionaries - that can be both expensive and difficult to acquire. In this thesis, we explore techniques for learning about speech directly from speech, with no manually generated transcriptions. Such techniques have the potential to revolutionize speech technologies for the vast majority of the world's population. The cognitive science and computer science communities have both been investing increasing time and resources into exploring this problem. However, a full unsupervised {{speech recognition}} system is a hugely complicated undertaking and is still <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>ways</b> <b>away.</b> <b>As</b> in previous work, we focus on the lower-level tasks which will underlie an eventual unsupervised speech recognizer. We specifically focus on two tasks: developing linguistically meaningful representations of speech and segmenting speech into phonetic units. This thesis approaches these tasks from a new direction: deep learning. While modern deep learning methods have their roots in ideas from the 1960 s and even earlier, deep learning techniques have recently seen a resurgence, thanks to huge increases in computational power and new efficient learning algorithms. Deep learning algorithms have been instrumental in the recent progress of traditional supervised speech recognition; here, we extend that work to unsupervised learning from speech. by Jennifer Fox Drexler.

5000|$|In Egypt, a Greek {{scholar and}} philosopher, Eratosthenes (276 BC - 195 BC), {{is said to}} have made more {{explicit}} measurements. He had heard that on the longest day of the summer solstice, the midday sun shone to the bottom of a well in the town of Syene (Aswan). At the same time, he observed the sun was not directly overhead at Alexandria; instead, it cast a shadow with the vertical equal to 1/50th of a circle (7° 12'). To these observations, Eratosthenes applied certain [...] "known" [...] facts (1) that {{on the day of the}} summer solstice, the midday sun was directly over the Tropic of Cancer; (2) Syene was on this tropic; (3) Alexandria and Syene lay on a direct north-south line; (4) The sun was <b>a</b> relatively <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>away</b> (astronomical unit). Legend has it that he had someone walk from Alexandria to Syene to measure the distance, which came out to be equal to 5000 stadia or (at the usual Hellenic 185 m per stadion) about 925 km.From these observations, measurements, and/or [...] "known" [...] facts, Eratosthenes concluded that since the angular deviation of the sun from the vertical direction at Alexandria was also the angle of the subtended arc (see illustration), the linear distance between Alexandria and Syene was 1/50 of the circumference of the Earth which thus must be 50×5000 = 250,000 stadia or probably 25,000 geographical miles. The circumference of the Earth is 24,902 mi (40,075.16 km). Over the poles it is more precisely 40,008 km or 24,860 mi. The actual unit of measure used by Eratosthenes was the stadion. No one knows for sure what his stadion equals in modern units, but some say that it was the Hellenic 185 m stadion.|$|R
40|$|Surface tension (S) {{is due to}} the inward force {{experienced}} by particles at the surface and usually gravitation does not {{play an important role in}} this force. But in compact stars the gravitational force on the particles is very large and S is found to depend not only on the interactions in the strange quark matter, but also on the structure of the star, i. e. on its mass and radius. Indeed, it has been claimed recently that 511 keV photons observed by the space probe INTEGRAL from the galactic bulge may be due to electron-positron annihilation, and their source may be the positron cloud outside of an antiquark star. Such stars, if they exist, may also go <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> towards explaining <b>away</b> the antibaryon deficit of the universe. For that to happen S must be high enough to allow for survival of quark/antiquark stars born in early stages of the formation of the universe. High value of S may also assist explanation of delayed gamma-ray burst after a supernova explosion, as conversion from normal matter to strange matter takes place. The possibility of some implications from formation of surface waves are also discussed. Comment: 5 pages, 5 figures, uses aa-package. Accepted in Astronomy and Astrophysics Letter...|$|R

40|$|Increased {{performance}} {{demand of}} modern applications {{has resulted in}} large memory modules and higher performance processors in computing systems. Power consumption becomes an important aspect when these resources go underutilized in a running system; e. g. during idle periods or lighter workloads. CPUs have come <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> in optimizing <b>away</b> the unnecessary power consumption in both hardware and software for such scenarios through solutions like Dynamic Voltage/Frequency Scaling. However, support for memory power optimization is still missing in modern operating systems despite hardware support being available {{for many years in}} the form of multiple power states and techniques like Partial Array Self-Refresh. In this work, we explore the behavior of Linux memory manager and report that even at 10 % of memory utilization, there are references to all physical memory banks in <b>a</b> <b>long</b> running system due to random page allocation and ignorance of memory bank boundaries. These references can be consolidated to a subset of memory banks by using page migration techniques. Unfortunately, migration of large contiguous blocks is often restricted due to the presence of unmovable pages primarily owned by kernel. We provide some techniques for utilizing the hardware facilitated Partial Array Self-Refresh by introducing bank awareness in the existing buddy allocation framework of Linux memory manager as well as for improving the page migration support of large contiguous blocks. Through a set of simple changes in Linux VM, {{we have been able to}} reduce the number of referenced memory banks significantly. Memory-hotplug framework, which relies on page migration of large contiguous blocks, also shows significant improvement in terms of number of removable memory sections. Benchmark results show no performance degradation in the modified kernel which makes the proposed solution desirable...|$|R
