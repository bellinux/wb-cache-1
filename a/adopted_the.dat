5|$|In 1817, the Netherlands reintroduced {{the metric}} system, but used pre-revolutionary names—for example 1centimetre became the duim (thumb), the ons (ounce) became 100g and so on. Certain German states adopted similar systems and in 1852 the German Zollverein (customs union) <b>adopted</b> <b>the</b> zollpfund (customs pound) of 500g for intrastate commerce. In 1872 {{the newly formed}} German Empire <b>adopted</b> <b>the</b> metric system as its {{official}} system of weights and measures and the newly formed Kingdom of Italy likewise, following the lead given by Piedmont, <b>adopted</b> <b>the</b> metric system in 1861.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{contrast}} {{and analyze the}} real-time performance of the powertrain system of a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, a mathematical model of the system delay is established under the circumstances that <b>the</b> transmission <b>adopts</b> <b>the</b> CAN (controller area network) protocol and the TTCAN (time-triggered CAN) protocol, respectively, and the interior of <b>the</b> controller <b>adopts</b> <b>the</b> foreground-background mode and the OSEK mode respectively.
