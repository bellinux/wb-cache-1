Gunnar Nygaard subsequently developed a series of diatom pH indices. By calibrating these indices to pH, Jouko Meriläinen introduced the first diatom-pH transfer function. Using diatom and chrysophyte fossil records, research groups led by Rick Battarbee (UK), Ingemar Renberg (Sweden), Don Charles (US), John Kingston (US), and John Smol (Canada) were able to clearly demonstrate that many northern lakes had rapidly acidified, in parallel with increased industry and emissions. Although lakes also showed a tendency to acidify slightly during their early (late-glacial) history, the pH of most lakes had remained stable for several thousand years prior to their recent, <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>acidification.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Global {{climate change}} is a widely {{accepted}} phenomenon and it is well understood that it is also leading {{to changes in the}} oceanic conditions. Increased industrial activities have also led to <b>anthropogenic</b> ocean <b>acidification,</b> the effects of which, on marine ecosystems, is a vigorously investigated topic. However, the impact of these phenomenon on underwater acoustic communication has not been investigated thoroughly. Fluctuations in ambient ocean conditions, such as salinity, acidity and temperature can lead to changes in the underwater acoustic channel performance. Since both marine mammals and man-made underwater wireless networks depend upon acoustic communications {{it is important to understand}} the effects in this context as well. An insight into the effects of climate change and <b>anthropogenic</b> ocean <b>acidification</b> could aid in designing better communication systems and also help explain some observed changes in marine mammal communication behavior. In this paper we present the results of a study conducted to better understand the effects of global climate change. Along with a brief presentation of the mathematical model, results of increasing temperature and acidity are discussed and effects on digital and marine mammal communication are both explored.

Based on results of both the approaches, the appropriateness of using historical data on zooplankton in Tatra lakes between 1909 - 1913 (Minkiewicz, 1914) as a reference condition for the evaluating biological recovery from acidification should have been assessed. The methods used were paleolimnological analyses of lake sediment (namely subfossil Cladocera), analysis of recent zooplankton, and analyses of lake water chemistry. It was found that in the historical record, relative abundances of Cladocera species significantly changed cca 150 years ago (at the end of the Little Ice Age and, in the main, in the period of <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>acidification).</b> The lake, though, has had a very stable species composition of Cladocera during the last cca 2, 000 years, represented by four species: Alona quadrangularis, Alonella excisa, Ceriodaphnia [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Thesis Summary The five {{chapters}} of this thesis consist of manuscripts published in peer-reviewed journals, {{focused on the}} effects of <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>acidification</b> on freshwater ecosystems in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, and an attempt to understand the processes and time-frame of recovery using modeling. In the Tatra Mountains in Slovakia and the Bohemian Forest in the Czech Republic, high mountain lakes have been the focus of long-term studies on both the biological and chemical impacts of acidification. The effects of <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>acidification</b> on headwater streams in the mountains and highlands of the Czech Republic have been recognized more recently, and the resulting changes to the biological community and trends in chemical changes are less well- known. Dynamic modeling, combined with the incorporation of scenarios of possible climate change, is used to investigate the present status and future trends in recovery of these ecosystems after recent reductions in atmospheric acid deposition. The first chapter is a paper on the macroinvertebrate biota in atmospherically acidified streams in the Czech Republic. This paper shows the effect of low pH on the taxonomic composition in these streams. The second chapter is focused on the current (2004) chemical composition of 91 lakes in the Tatra Mountains, [...] ...|$|E

Studies on soil susceptibility to the process of acidification were carried out in the Municipality of Ljubovija, using three methods. Defining of the degree of soil susceptibility to the process of acidification allows timely activities aimed at the reduction of overall soil acidity.

Study of shell dissolution requires an accurate and sensitive method for assessing shell damage. Shell dissolution was induced through incubations in CO 2 -enriched seawater for 4 and 14 days. We describe a procedure that allows the level of dissolution to be assessed and classified into three main types: Type I with partial dissolution of the prismatic layer; Type II with exposure of underlying crossed-lamellar layer, and Type III, where crossed-lamellar layer shows signs of dissolution. Levels of dissolution showed a good correspondence to the incubation conditions, with the most severe damage found in specimens held for 14 days in undersaturated condition (Ω ~ 0. 8). This methodology enables the response of small pelagic calcifiers to acidified conditions to be detected at an early stage, thus making pteropods a valuable bioindicator of future ocean acidification...|$|R
40|$|<b>Anthropogenic</b> ocean <b>acidification</b> {{threatens to}} {{negatively}} impact marine organisms that precipitate calcium carbonate skeletons. Past geological events, {{such as the}} Permian-Triassic Mass Extinction, together with modern experiments generally support these concerns. However, the physiological costs of producing a calcium carbonate skeleton under different acidification scenarios remain poorly understood. Here we present an idealized mathematical model to quantify whole-skeleton costs, concluding that they rise only modestly (up to ∼ 10 %) under acidification expected for 2100. The modest magnitude of this effect reflects in part the low energetic cost of inorganic, calcium carbonate relative to the proteinaceous organic matrix component of skeletons. Our analysis does, however, point to an important kinetic constraint that depends on seawater carbonate chemistry, and we hypothesize {{that the impact of}} acidification is more likely to cause extinctions within groups where the timescale of larval development is tightly constrained.

40|$|We tested two {{predictions}} {{required to}} {{support the hypothesis that}} anthropogenic acidic episodes might explain the poor biological response of upland British streams otherwise recovering from acidification: (i) that invertebrate assemblages should differ between episodic and well-buffered streams and (ii) these effects should differentiate between sites with episodes caused by <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>acidification</b> as opposed to base-cation dilution or sea-salt deposition. Chronic and episodically acidic streams were widespread, and episodes reflected acid titration more than dilution. Nonmarine sulphate (16 – 18 % vs. 5 – 9 %), and nitrate (4 – 6 % vs. 1 – 2 %) contributed more to anion loading during episodes in Wales than Scotland, and Welsh streams also had a larger proportion of total stream sulphate from nonmarine sources (64 – 66 % vs. 35 – 46 %). Sea-salts were rarely a major cause of episodic ANC or pH reduction during the events sampled. By contrast, streams with episodes driven by strong anthropogenic acids had lower pH (5. 0 ± 0. 6) and more dissolved aluminium (288 ± 271 μg L 1) during events than where episodes were caused by dilution (pH 5. 4 ± 0. 6; 116 ± 110 μg Al L 1) or where streams remained circumneutral (pH 6. 7 ± 1. 0; 50 ± 45 μg Al L 1). Both biological predictions were supported: invertebrate assemblages differed among sites with different episode chemistry while several acid-sensitive species were absent only where episodes reflected <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>acidification.</b> We conclude that strong acid anions – dominantly nonmarine sulphate – still cause significant episodic acidification in acid-sensitive areas of Britain and may be a sufficient explanation for slow biological recovery in many locations...|$|E

The invertebrates used in this study were taxonomically distinct (Insecta: Plecoptera and Trichoptera; Crustacea: Amphipoda), and of different sizes, hence a high degree of complementarity was probably present. A method to study the effects of species loss, characteristic of perturbation type, could be more useful than a random approach when investigating the impact of perturbation.

40|$|The {{majority}} of benthic marine invertebrates have a complex life cycle, {{during which the}} pelagic larvae select a suitable substrate, attach to it, and then metamorphose into benthic adults. <b>Anthropogenic</b> ocean <b>acidification</b> (OA) is postulated to affect larval metamorphic success through an altered protein expression pattern (proteome structure) and post-translational modifications. To test this hypothesis, larvae of an economically and ecologically important barnacle species Balanus amphitrite, were cultured from nauplius to the cyprid stage in the present (control) and in the projected elevated concentrations of CO 2 for the year 2100 (the OA treatment). Cyprid response to OA was analyzed at the total proteome level {{as well as two}} protein post-translational modification (phosphorylation and glycosylation) levels using a 2 -DE based proteomic approach. The cyprid proteome showed OA-driven changes. Proteins that were differentially up or down regulated by OA come from three major groups, namely those related to energy-metabolism, respiration, and molecular chaperones, illustrating a potential strategy that the barnacle larvae may employ to tolerate OA stress.

Experimentally reduced Mg / Ca ratios in ambient seawater have been shown to induce some calcite precipitation in both adult and newly settled modern corals, however, the impact of high p CO 2 on the mineralogy of recruits is unknown. Here we determined the skeletal mineralogy of one-month old Acropora spicifera coral recruits grown under high temperature (+ 3 °C) and p CO 2 (∼ 900 μatm) conditions, using X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. We found that newly settled coral recruits produced entirely aragonitic skeletons regardless of the treatment. Our results show that elevated p CO 2 alone is unlikely to drive changes in the skeletal mineralogy of young corals. Not having an ability to switch from aragonite to calcite precipitation may leave corals and ultimately coral reef ecosystems more susceptible to predicted ocean acidification. An important area for prospective research would be to investigate the combined impact of high p CO 2 and reduced Mg / Ca ratio on coral skeletal mineralogy...|$|R
40|$|Small {{headwater}} streams {{are vital}} components of rivers. They comprise 60 - 75 % {{of the total}} stream length and watershed area in the Mid-Atlantic Highlands. The Appalachian region supports a diverse assemblage of Plethodontid (lungless) salamanders. Amphibians, in general, {{are considered to be}} valuable response indicators. Several efforts are underway to develop and test indices of biotic integrity based partly or wholly on stream salamanders. The objectives of this research were: 1) To describe the range and variability of stream plethodontid assemblage responses (SPAR) across commonly encountered gradients of <b>anthropogenic</b> degradation (stream <b>acidification,</b> forest and riparian corridor fragmentation and degradation, pollution, etc.) in the Mid-Atlantic Highlands Area (MAHA). 2) To develop a SPAR-based index for use in MAHA headwaters. 3) To evaluate the reliability and resolution of SPAR by application and testing. In 2000 - 2002, we sampled 138 EMAP stream sites (3 km 2) covering a wide range of ecological and human disturbance gradients. The EMAP Mid-Atlantic Highlands wadeable stream sites were originally selected by a randomized, probability-based design to allow inference o...|$|R
40|$|Transparent exopolymer {{particles}} (TEP) are abiotically formed aggregates {{within the}} water column from physiological stress causing polysaccharides to be exuded by phytoplankton and some bacteria. They are considered a possible mechanism for carbon export from surface waters due to their high stickiness and thus ability to cause large aggregates to form. Ocean acidification is a process which may greatly influence the production and cycling of TEP within {{the water column}}. The San Juan Islands experience both <b>anthropogenic</b> and natural <b>acidification</b> of their surrounding waters. The influence of ocean acidification on TEP production within Friday Harbor waters {{has not yet been}} studied. To study TEP production under ocean acidification nine mesocosms with three treatments were utilized. Though no difference between the control and high treatments were found, possible evidence was seen for CO 2 effecting TEP production; The drift treatment was significant different from the maintained high and control treatments, suggesting repetitive addition of CO 2 to the environment does have an effect on TEP production within the mesocosms...|$|R
