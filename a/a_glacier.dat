5|$|The mass balance, or {{difference}} between accumulation and ablation (melting and sublimation), of <b>a</b> <b>glacier</b> {{is crucial to}} its survival. Climate change may cause variations in both temperature and snowfall, resulting in changes in mass balance. <b>A</b> <b>glacier</b> with a sustained negative balance loses equilibrium and retreats. A sustained positive balance is also out of equilibrium and will advance to reestablish equilibrium. Currently, nearly all glaciers have a negative mass balance and are retreating.|$|E
5|$|Flinn {{conceived}} the penal colony Rura Penthe as on an arid, undeveloped world with odorous aliens; Meyer {{suggested that it}} be turned into an ice world instead. The exterior shots of Martia, Kirk, and McCoy traveling across the frozen wastes were filmed on top of <b>a</b> <b>glacier</b> in Alaska, forty minutes east of Anchorage. Because of budget and time constraints, the second unit was tasked with getting the footage. The location was accessible only by helicopter, and was scouted months before filming began.|$|E
5|$|Subglacial eruptions are {{a type of}} {{volcanic}} eruption characterized by interactions between lava and ice, often under <b>a</b> <b>glacier.</b> The nature of glaciovolcanism dictates that it occurs at areas of high latitude and high altitude. It {{has been suggested that}} subglacial volcanoes that are not actively erupting often dump heat into the ice covering them, producing meltwater. This meltwater mix means that subglacial eruptions often generate dangerous jökulhlaups (floods) and lahars.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> cirque <b>glacier</b> {{is formed}} in a cirque, a bowl-shaped {{depression}} {{on the side}} of or near mountains. Snow and ice accumulation in corries often occurs as the result of avalanching from higher surrounding slopes.If <b>a</b> cirque <b>glacier</b> advances far enough, it may become <b>a</b> valley <b>glacier.</b> Additionally, <b>a</b> valley <b>glacier</b> retreats enough that it is within the cirque, it is <b>a</b> cirque <b>glacier</b> again.|$|R
50|$|<b>As</b> <b>glaciers</b> {{can only}} {{originate}} above the snowline, studying {{the location of}} present-day cirques provides information on past glaciation patterns and on climate change.|$|R
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>glaciers</b> flow over bedrock, they soften {{and lift}} blocks of rock into the ice. This process, called plucking, {{is caused by}} {{subglacial}} water that penetrates fractures in the bedrock and subsequently freezes and expands. This expansion causes the ice {{to act as a}} lever that loosens the rock by lifting it. Thus, sediments of all sizes become part of the <b>glacier's</b> load. If <b>a</b> retreating <b>glacier</b> gains enough debris, it may become <b>a</b> rock <b>glacier,</b> like the Timpanogos Glacier in Utah.|$|R
5|$|The small glaciers in {{the forest}} are less able to resist melting than the great ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica. Once <b>a</b> <b>glacier</b> begins retreating, it may fall into disequilibrium and be unable to find mass balance (accumulation versus melting rate) at any size. Without a {{favorable}} climate change, {{it will continue to}} retreat until it disappears. Loss of glacial ice already reduces the summer glacial runoff that supplies water to streams and lakes and provides a cold-water source vital to certain fish and plant species. This, in turn, may {{have a significant impact on}} the forest ecosystem over time.|$|E
5|$|A storm {{causes the}} ship to crash, and the group awakens to {{discover}} that <b>a</b> <b>glacier</b> blocks the reinforcements' path. While investigating the glacier, the group finds Sherincal, a half-dragon, guarding the entrance to an Aurilite temple. They learn that Sherincal leads the Legion of the Chimera's western forces, and that {{the leaders of the}} Legion of the Chimera, cambion twins named Isair and Madae, reside in the Severed Hand. Inside the Aurilite temple, the group finds a prisoner from Kuldahar, who asks them to warn Kuldahar of the threat posed by the Legion of the Chimera. After this, the group creates a passage through the glacier, and meets with the reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|Secret Service {{operative}} James Bond, {{code name}} 007, {{is assigned to}} apprehend a hero of the Second World War implicated in a murder involving a cache of Nazi gold. Bond appears only briefly in this story, which is told mostly in flashback {{from the perspective of}} Major Dexter Smythe, the man Bond has been sent to bring in. Smythe remained in Europe after the war, found the gold {{with the help of a}} mountain guide, and killed him in order to keep it for himself. Bond was put on the case after the guide's body fell out of <b>a</b> <b>glacier</b> and he recognized the man as a ski instructor and father figure from his youth. Smythe is now a melancholy alcoholic living alone on the beach, interacting mainly with the residents of its coral reef – including the titular Octopussy, a beloved 'pet' octopus that Smythe feeds and talks to.|$|E

5000|$|A ribbon lake {{may also}} occur if <b>a</b> {{tributary}} <b>glacier</b> joins <b>a</b> main <b>glacier.</b> The increase in power {{can create a}} trough, which is filled with water from a river/meltwater to create a ribbon lake.|$|R
5000|$|... == Terminus {{movement}} and mass balance [...] == If <b>a</b> <b>glacier's</b> terminus moves forward {{faster than it}} melts, {{the net result is}} advance. Glacier retreat occurs when more material ablates from the terminus than is replenished by flow into that region.|$|R
5|$|Snow {{refers to}} forms of ice {{crystals}} that precipitate {{from the atmosphere}} (usually from clouds) and undergo changes on the Earth's surface. It pertains to frozen crystalline water throughout its life cycle, starting when, under suitable conditions, the ice crystals form in the atmosphere, increase to millimeter size, precipitate and accumulate on surfaces, then metamorphose in place, and ultimately melt, slide or sublimate away. Snowstorms organize and develop by feeding on sources of atmospheric moisture and cold air. Snowflakes nucleate around particles in the atmosphere by attracting supercooled water droplets, which freeze in hexagonal-shaped crystals. Snowflakes take {{on a variety of}} shapes, basic among these are platelets, needles, columns and rime. As snow accumulates into a snowpack, it may blow into drifts. Over time, accumulated snow metamorphoses, by sintering, sublimation and freeze-thaw. Where the climate is cold enough for year-to-year accumulation, <b>a</b> <b>glacier</b> may form. Otherwise, snow typically melts seasonally, causing runoff into streams and rivers and recharging groundwater.|$|E
5|$|An ice core is a {{vertical}} column through <b>a</b> <b>glacier,</b> sampling the layers that formed through an annual cycle of snowfall and melt. As snow accumulates, each layer presses on lower layers, making them denser until they turn into firn. Firn is not dense {{enough to prevent}} air from escaping; but at a density of about 830kg/m3 it turns to ice, and the air within is sealed into bubbles that capture {{the composition of the}} atmosphere at the time the ice formed. The depth at which this occurs varies with location, but in Greenland and the Antarctic it ranges from 64m to 115m. Because the rate of snowfall varies from site to site, the age of the firn when it turns to ice varies a great deal. At Summit Camp in Greenland, the depth is 77 m and the ice is 230 years old; at Dome C in Antarctica the depth is 95 m and the age 2500 years. As further layers build up, the pressure increases, and at about 1500m the crystal structure of the ice changes from hexagonal to cubic, allowing air molecules to move into the cubic crystals and form a clathrate. The bubbles disappear and the ice becomes more transparent.|$|E
5|$|Ear {{piercing}} {{has been}} practiced {{all over the}} world since ancient times. There is considerable written and archaeological evidence of the practice. Mummified bodies with pierced ears have been discovered, including the oldest mummified body discovered to date, the 5,300-year-old Ötzi the Iceman, which was found in <b>a</b> <b>glacier</b> in Italy. This mummy had an ear piercing 7–11mm diameter. The oldest earrings found in a grave date to 2500 BCE. These were located in the Sumerian city of Ur, home of the Biblical patriarch Abraham. Earrings are mentioned in the Bible. In Genesis 35:4, Jacob buries the earrings worn by members of his household along with their idols. In Exodus 32, Aaron makes the golden calf from melted earrings. Deuteronomy 15:12–17 dictates ear piercing for a slave who chooses not to be freed. Earrings are also referenced in connection to the Hindu goddess Lakshmi in the Vedas. Earrings for pierced ears were found in a grave in the Ukok region between Russia and China dated between 400 and 300 BCE.|$|E
2500|$|When <b>a</b> <b>glacier's</b> size shrinks below a {{critical}} point, its flow stops {{and it becomes}} stationary. Meanwhile, meltwater within and beneath the ice leaves stratified alluvial deposits.

5|$|Leterrier had {{to direct}} four units {{with a broken}} foot. Filming began on July 9, 2007. Shooting {{primarily}} took place in Toronto, because mayor David Miller is a Hulk fan and promised to be very helpful to the crew when closing Yonge Street for four nights in September to shoot Hulk and Blonsky's climactic fight. Despite messing up the street with explosives and overturned burning vehicles, the crew would clean it up within twenty minutes so business could continue as normal each day. The first action sequence shot was the Culver University battle, which was filmed at the University of Toronto and Morningside Park. The filmmakers built a glass wall over a walkway at the University for when the soldiers trap Banner inside to smoke him out. There was also shooting in the Financial District. A factory in Hamilton, Ontario, which was due for demolition, was {{the interior of the}} Brazilian factory. The site's underground floors were used for Ross' military command center. The crew also shot part of the Hulk and Blonsky's fight on a backlot in Hamilton. Other Canadian locations included CFB Trenton and <b>a</b> <b>glacier</b> in Bella Coola, British Columbia. Afterwards, there was a week-long shoot in New York City and two weeks in Rio de Janeiro. While there, the crew shot at Rocinha, Lapa, Tijuca Forest and Santa Teresa. Filming concluded in November after eighty-eight days of filming.|$|E
25|$|Glaciers {{grow and}} shrink due both to natural {{variability}} and external forcings. Variability in temperature, precipitation, and englacial and subglacial hydrology can strongly determine {{the evolution of}} <b>a</b> <b>glacier</b> in a particular season. Therefore, one must average over a decadal or longer time-scale and/or over many individual glaciers to smooth out the local short-term variability and obtain <b>a</b> <b>glacier</b> history that is related to climate.|$|E

25|$|Climate change {{causes a}} shift in the {{equilibrium}} line altitude (ELA) of <b>a</b> <b>glacier.</b> This is the imaginary line on <b>a</b> <b>glacier,</b> above which snow accumulates faster than it ablates, and below which, the reverse is the case. This altitude shift, in turn, prompts a retreat or advance of the terminus toward a new steady-state position. However, this change in terminus behavior for calving glaciers is also a function of resulting changes in fjord geometry, and calving rate at the glacier terminus as it changes position.|$|E
25|$|Crucial to the {{survival}} of <b>a</b> <b>glacier</b> is its mass balance or surface mass balance (SMB), the difference between accumulation and ablation (sublimation and melting). Climate change may cause variations in both temperature and snowfall, causing changes in the surface mass balance. Changes in mass balance control a glacier's long-term behavior and are the most sensitive climate indicators on <b>a</b> <b>glacier.</b> From 1980–2012 the mean cumulative mass loss of glaciers reporting mass balance to the World Glacier Monitoring Service is −16 m. This includes 23 consecutive years of negative mass balances.|$|E

25|$|A glacial lake {{outburst}} flood (GLOF) {{is a type}} of outburst flood {{that occurs}} when the dam containing a glacial lake fails. An event similar to a GLOF, where a body of water contained by <b>a</b> <b>glacier</b> melts or overflows the glacier, is called a Jökulhlaup. The dam can consist of glacier ice or a terminal moraine. Failure can happen due to erosion, a buildup of water pressure, an avalanche of rock or heavy snow, an earthquake or cryoseism, volcanic eruptions under the ice, or if a large enough portion of <b>a</b> <b>glacier</b> breaks off and massively displaces the waters in a glacial lake at its base.|$|E
50|$|Non-indigenous {{people first}} {{explored}} {{the area of}} Laguna San Rafael in the year 1675. The glacier {{of the same name}} was <b>a</b> land-terminating <b>glacier</b> during that time.
