5|$|Pesticides {{are applied}} to crops by {{agricultural}} aircraft, tractor-mounted crop sprayers or as seed dressings to control pests. However, successful control by pesticides is not easy; the right formulation must be chosen, the timing is often critical, the method of application is important, adequate coverage and retention on the crop are necessary. The killing of natural enemies of the target pest should be minimised. This is particularly important in countries where there are natural reservoirs of pests and their enemies in the countryside surrounding plantation crops, and these co-exist in a delicate balance. Often in less-developed countries, the crops are well adapted to the local situation and no pesticides are needed. Where progressive farmers are using fertilisers to grow improved crop varieties, these are often more susceptible to pest damage, but the indiscriminate <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> may be detrimental in the longer term.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Fogger <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> in {{greenhouses}} {{can reduce}} application time and applicator contact with equipment. Since fog applications use {{smaller and more}} concentrated droplets than typical wet spray applications, potential for inhalation and off-target transport hazards may be increased. This study investigated temporal characteristics <b>of</b> airborne <b>pesticide</b> after thermal fogging of a greenhouse. Droplet size spectra and concentration <b>of</b> airborne <b>pesticide</b> were measured. Volume median diameter of the suspended aerosol decreased from 14 to 2. 3 µm during 1. 5 h after <b>application.</b> Concentration <b>of</b> airborne <b>pesticide</b> decreased by 60 % in the first hour after application and by 95 % during 12 h after application. Implications for respiratory exposure were analytically developed from observed data. Hand spraying with high-pressure, high-volume systems {{is the most common}} technique <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> <b>application</b> in greenhouse culture. However, fog or aerosol applications are feasible and often-used alternatives for enclosed structures. The motivations for fog application are the potential to increase spray deposition; improve pest control efficacy; and reduce <b>application</b> times, rates <b>of</b> active ingredients, and applicator exposure.

50|$|Pesticides {{can kill}} bees and are {{strongly}} implicated in pollinator decline, {{the loss of}} species that pollinate plants, including through the mechanism of Colony Collapse Disorder, in which worker bees from a beehive or western honey bee colony abruptly disappear. <b>Application</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> to crops that are in bloom can kill honeybees, which act as pollinators.

50|$|Since the 1970s, {{multiple}} countries {{started to}} limit or ban aerial <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides,</b> fertilizers {{and other products}} out of environmental and public health concerns, in particular from spray drift.

50|$|The EPA {{is proposing}} to {{prohibit}} {{the application of}} certain pesticides and herbicides known toxic to bees during pollination periods when crops are in bloom.
