6000|$|... "We'll see <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>later,</b> Crowden," [...] put in Dick, sternly. [...] "Now you sit {{perfectly}} still or else maybe you'll go overboard and be drowned." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{can talk}} <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>later.</b> It {{will be some}} time before the mine is yours, and I'm not certain that we have heard the last of Stormont." ...|$|E

50|$|Thanks to {{the library}} of his home city, Chekhov being a {{gymnasium}} student learnt <b>about</b> the periodicals <b>that</b> <b>later</b> published his short stories.|$|R
50|$|False alarms {{could also}} refer to {{situations}} where one becomes startled <b>about</b> something <b>that</b> is <b>later</b> {{determined to be}} untrue.|$|R
6000|$|... "If it's necessary, we'll talk <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>later.</b> In the {{meanwhile}} we'll get our salvage claim in. Leeson {{should be}} here at any moment. I saw him last night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll talk <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>later.</b> Jest now there's {{a chance}} others {{will find out}} where you are, for Joe and Bill have gone after men to help search for Billings." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{ought not}} to have done it at all. We will talk <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>later.</b> It doesn't alter the fact that Ellen is a thief. I have missed money half a dozen times. Besides that, there's the brooch. Step this way, officer.' ...|$|E
25|$|During her {{childhood}} {{it was thought}} that the alleged unmarried affair with Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson must be kept secret. Even Anders Underdal, who early on gave an account of his origin to his children, fell silent <b>about</b> <b>that</b> matter <b>later</b> in life. Nobody knows why. Sandemo herself doesn't like talking about her ancestry in public.|$|R
50|$|Shortly after Hornbeck's disappearance, {{his parents}} {{appeared}} on The Montel Williams Show, where self-described psychic Sylvia Browne told the Akers that Hornbeck was dead. Browne also described the abduction, telling them several things <b>about</b> the abductor <b>that</b> <b>later</b> {{proved to be}} incorrect.|$|R
5000|$|It's Fashion Week at Mode and [...] Daniel (Eric Mabius) helps Betty (America Ferrera) {{to cover}} a low-priority show, this after Betty is singled out by Wilhelmina (Vanessa Williams), who then gives her {{something}} else to do a story on, like the history of the sewing machine. However, thanks to a malfunction in Daniel's new bluetooth that recorded a conversation between Daniel and Wilhelmina <b>about</b> Betty <b>that</b> <b>later</b> shows up on Betty's cellphone, Betty ends up giving Daniel the cold shoulder at work but she forgives him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well," [...] he said, [...] "you {{must wait}} until I have written my letter. Time enough to talk <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>later</b> on. Now, if you won't stay to lunch, {{you must come}} and see Rachael and have some cake {{and a glass of}} wine." ...|$|E
6000|$|Campbell: [...] "We'll think <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>later.</b> We haven't got {{any time}} to lose in talk. We can pin back the skirts of your frock-coat, as the {{travelling}} Americans used {{to do when they}} went to the opera in London. Hurry up!" [...] He gives Roberts the garments, and pushes him into the door of his dressing-room, and walks impatiently up and down amidst the chaos of clothing till Roberts reappears. [...] "Why, that isn't bad!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, boys, {{here we are}} {{together}} like one big family, and we're shut in for two months. Now, I know you've all been fightin' for places on the team, and have had no chance to be friendly. It's always that way in the beginnin', and I dare say there'll be some scraps among you before things straighten out. We'll have more to say <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>later.</b> The thing now is you're all varsity men, and I'm puttin' you on your word of honor. Your word {{is good enough for}} me. Here's my rules, and I'm more than usually particular this year, for reasons I'll tell later.|$|E
60|$|Thus it came <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> {{three days}} <b>later,</b> I {{descended from the}} train at Styles St. Mary, an absurd little station, with no {{apparent}} reason for existence, perched up {{in the midst of}} green fields and country lanes. John Cavendish was waiting on the platform, and piloted me out to the car.|$|R
5000|$|The {{interviewer}} {{also mentioned}} the Queen album The Works, where Kershaw {{spoke of the}} album's title and the meaning behind it. [...] "I only found out <b>about</b> <b>that</b> Queen title <b>later,</b> when the sleeve was already finished. Oh well, nothing is new, everything has been done before. I don't worry about it. 'The Works' means: the collected works of Nik Kershaw." ...|$|R
25|$|Ehrman {{examines}} the historicity of Jesus and includes some criticism of Christ mythicists. As {{he does in}} other works such as Forged and Jesus, Interrupted, he disregards an apologetics-based or otherwise religiously-charged approach to aim at looking at the New Testament using historical-critical methodology. He argues that a specific historical Jesus {{is likely to have}} really existed in the 1st century AD. Even as accounts <b>about</b> <b>that</b> figure <b>later</b> on brought in additional misinformation and legendary stories, Ehrman states, multiple reasons still remain to see things as framed around a flesh-and-blood actual person, at least at first.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why not? How many well-paid {{artisans}} {{work more}} than {{four days a week}} anyhow? Remember a Linesman hasn't to be drilled in your sense of the word. He must have had at least eight years' grounding in that, as well as two or three years in his Volunteer battalion. He can sleep where he pleases. He can't leave town-limits without reporting himself, of course, but he can get leave if he wants it. He's on duty two days in the week as a rule, and he's liable to be invited out for garrison duty down the Mediterranean, but his benefit societies will insure him against that. I'll tell you <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>later.</b> If it's a hard winter and trade's slack, a lot of the bachelors are taken into the I. G. barracks (while the I. G. is out on the heef) for theoretical instruction. Oh, I assure you the Line hasn't half a bad time of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "First, Madrono Ranch is a bargain. I know soil, I know beauty, I know climate. Madrono Ranch is a gold mine. There is {{a fortune}} in that meadow. Tilth--I'll tell you <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>later.</b> First, here's the land. Second, {{what are you going}} to do with it? Make a living? Yes. Vegetables? Of course. What are you going to do with them after you have grown them? Sell. Where?--Now listen. You must do as I did. Cut out the middle man. Sell {{directly}} to the consumer. Drum up your own market. Do you know what I saw from the car windows coming up the valley, only several miles from here? Hotels, springs, summer resorts, winter resorts--population, mouths, market. How is that market supplied? I looked in vain for truck gardens.--Billy, harness up your horses and be ready directly after dinner to take Saxon and me driving. Never mind everything else. Let things stand. What's the use of starting for a place of which you haven't the address. We'll look for the address this afternoon. Then we'll know where we are--at."--The last syllable a smiling concession to Billy.|$|E

50|$|His friend Arturo Cisneros {{said he got}} {{a missed}} call from Jinsop on early Sunday, June 24, 2012 at 3:50 am. He said he would forever wonder what Jinsop {{wanted to talk to}} him <b>about</b> at <b>that</b> hour. <b>Later</b> <b>that</b> morning, Jinsop was found in his home dead from cardiac arrest by his son Alexander. Three weeks earlier Silvia the mother of his children's life was taken by Pancreatic Cancer.|$|R
60|$|Thus it came <b>about</b> <b>that</b> a month <b>later</b> {{on the eve}} of the Feast of Saint Matthew, the Lady Mary, as {{she walked}} front Cosford gates, met with a strange horseman, richly clad, a serving-man behind him, looking shrewdly about him with quick blue eyes, which twinkled from a red and {{freckled}} face. At sight of her he doffed his hat and reined his horse.|$|R
50|$|Uli Trepte {{began his}} musical career in 1966 on double bass {{as a free}} jazz player/founder member of the Irene Schweizer Trio, a {{formation}} that wrote avantgarde history (Frankfurt Jazz Festival 66/1. Montreux Jazz Festival 67/Donaueschinger Tage für Neue Musik 67/Berliner Jazztage 67; 2 LPs). At <b>about</b> <b>that</b> time and <b>later</b> he also appeared with jazz musicians like Yusef Lateef, Gato Barbieri, Barney Wilen, John McLaughlin and Mal Waldron.|$|R
50|$|Kari {{started out}} her {{entertainment}} {{career as an}} actress, with around 7 years in theatre school. This later went into modelling and she stopped acting in theatre and films for several years. In the end of 2011 she announced that she was to star in a movie, but {{that she was going}} to tell more <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>later.</b>|$|E
50|$|It {{should also}} be noted that this effect can only occur if the voter's {{expressed}} opinion on B (the less-preferred candidate) is higher than the opinion of the society <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>later</b> preference is. Thus, a failure to later-no-harm can only turn a candidate into a winner, if the voter likes him more than (rest of) the society does.|$|E
50|$|Being at A Coruña, a child Manuel Murguía {{witnessed}} the liberal insurrection of locals against the central power on 23 April 1846. This happening {{ended with the}} execution of the Mártires de Carral (The Martyrs of Carral). It all caused an important ideological impact on Murguía, who wrote <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>later</b> on in his article La Voz de Galicia (The Voice of Galicia).|$|E
5000|$|Although unintentional, the song's {{composition}} was pivotal in the film's {{characterization of}} Elsa. Although Elsa was originally written as a villain, co-directors Chris Buck and Lee gradually rewrote Elsa {{into one of}} the film's protagonists after [...] "Let It Go" [...] was composed. <b>About</b> <b>that,</b> Lee <b>later</b> explained, [...] "the minute we heard the song the first time, I knew that I had to rewrite the whole movie." [...] Buck further clarified: [...] "Jen had to go back and rewrite some pages in the first act to build up to that scene..... You have to set it up well enough in advance so that when the song comes, the audience is ready for it and there's an emotional payoff." ...|$|R
5|$|Monk meets St. Claire, {{his wife}} Miranda (Gail O'Grady), and their advisor Gavin Lloyd (Ben Bass), {{and walks to}} the site where the {{assassination}} attempt occurred. He discovers Vasquez was a volunteer for the St. Claire's campaign. When he goes to St. Claire campaign headquarters and questions a volunteer <b>about</b> Vasquez, <b>that</b> volunteer <b>later</b> dies under suspicious circumstances, enhancing Monk's suspicion about a link between the Vasquez and St. Claire cases.|$|R
2500|$|Oskooi {{chose the}} subject of {{evolution}} and Bahá'í belief for his 2009 thesis, {{and in doing so}} reviewed other Bahá'í authors' works on the subject. He concluded that, [...] "The problem of disharmony between scripture and science is rooted in an unwarranted misattribution of scriptural inerrancy." [...] In other words, he believes that `Abdu'l-Bahá made statements <b>about</b> biology <b>that</b> were <b>later</b> proved wrong, and that `Abdu'l-Bahá's infallibility should not be applied to scientific matters.|$|R
50|$|El Chupa (First Appearance: AJB Vol. 2 #1) is the sworn {{enemy of}} El Campeon and he {{controls}} {{the continent of}} Central America. He's {{the leader of the}} Chupacabras and is a nasty one to face, as he's almost a direct doppelganger of El Campeon but we'll find out more <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>later.</b> Their feud goes back hundreds of years. There's about four different varieties of Chupacabras. He's of the Alphacabra variety, and the ones that go after livestock are the Beta Cabras who are his minions. The other two breeds are extremely rare. Favorite drink Tequila. If there's evil afoot in Central America, most likely he's behind it.|$|E
50|$|Godber {{falls out}} with Fletcher over the {{constant}} derogatory remarks of his tapioca pudding. Fletcher {{tells him that}} they need to worry <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>later</b> as the threat of retribution from Grouty is far more important. Harris shows up, much to Fletcher’s displeasure. However, Harris confesses that he already has bottles of pills which he had previously stolen which {{could be used as a}} substitute. Although, Harris still wants Fletcher to pay him for the pills. Godber attempts to appeal to Harris’ better nature, which Fletcher points out is fruitless as Harris doesn’t have one. Instead of paying Harris, Fletcher responds by hurting Harris’ bad arm, causing more screaming.|$|E
5000|$|After the {{suppression}} of the Urabi Revolt he was again installed in office (August 1882) by Tawfiq, but in January 1884 he resigned rather than sanction the evacuation of the Sudan. As to the strength of the Mahdist movement he had then no conception. When urged by Sir Evelyn Baring (Lord Cromer) early in 1883 to abandon some of the more distant parts of the Sudan, he replied with characteristic light-heartedness: [...] "Nous en causerons plus tard d'abord nous allons donner une bonne raclée à ce monsieur" [...] (We'll talk <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>later,</b> first we're going to give this gentleman (i.e. the Mahdi) a good thrashing). Hicks Pasha's expedition was at the time preparing to march on El Obeid.|$|E
50|$|In 1963 Armand Hammer's Occidental Petroleum {{acquired}} Leir's company Interore SA, a phosphate {{mining and}} chemical trading multinational with operations in twenty-seven countries. Hammer's autobiography describes the meetings with Leir {{that led to}} this transaction, but included unflattering personal details <b>about</b> Leir <b>that</b> Leir <b>later</b> disputed. Another famous business associate of Leir's was Joseph Alioto, who served as legal counsel for Leir's business interests before becoming mayor of San Francisco in 1968.|$|R

5000|$|On January 7, 2010, Ozawa {{announced}} that he was canceling all engagements for six months in order to undergo treatments for esophageal cancer. The doctor with Ozawa {{at the time of the}} announcement said it was detected at an early stage. Other health problems with Ozawa have included pneumonia and lower back surgery. Following his cancer diagnosis, Ozawa and the novelist Haruki Murakami embarked on a series of six conversations <b>about</b> classical music <b>that</b> <b>later</b> became the basis for the book Absolutely on Music.|$|R
