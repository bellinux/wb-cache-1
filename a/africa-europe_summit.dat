500|$|Mugabe's actions brought strong criticism. The Zimbabwe Council of Churches {{accused him}} of {{plunging}} the country into [...] "a de facto state of warfare" [...] {{in order to stay}} in power. Several Southern African states remonstrated with him at a summit in Harare in September 2001. In 2002, the British Commonwealth expelled Zimbabwe from among its ranks; Mugabe blamed this on anti-black racism, a view echoed by South Africa's President Thabo Mbeki. Mbeki favoured a policy of [...] "quiet diplomacy" [...] in dealing with Mugabe, and prevented the African Union (AU) from introducing sanctions against him. The <b>Africa-Europe</b> <b>Summit,</b> scheduled to take place in Lisbon in April 2003, was deferred repeatedly because African leaders refused to attend while Mugabe was banned; it eventually took place in 2007 with Mugabe in attendance. In 2004, the EU imposed a travel ban and asset freeze on Mugabe. It extended these sanctions in 2008, with the U.S. government introducing further sanctions this same year. The US and UK introduced a resolution at the UN Security Council calling for an arms embargo of Zimbabwe alongside an asset freeze and travel ban of Mugabe and other government figures; it was vetoed by Russia and China. In 2009, the SADC demanded that Western states lift their targeted sanctions against Mugabe and his government. ZANU-PF presented the sanctions as a form of Western neo-colonialism and blamed the West for Zimbabwe's economic problems.|$|E
