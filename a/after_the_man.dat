5|$|Brashear has two sons, Jordan and Jackson; he {{separated}} from their mother, Gabrielle Desgagne, his common-law wife, in 2007. In 2000, Brashear was charged with assault following an incident where he grabbed {{a man by the}} neck and shoved him. The incident occurred <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> complained to Desgagne about the couple's infant son crawling on the exercise machines in a communal gym. Brashear received six months probation after pleading guilty to common assault.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, {{the tournament}} {{was called the}} Talbot Challenge Cup and Modena were the winners. The {{following}} year the tournament was renamed the Gigi Peronace Memorial, <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> who organised the tournament, and reduced to four teams. The new format consisted of two Anglo-Italian semi-finals, which meant the final was not necessarily contested by an English and an Italian team. That year, Modena successfully defended their title in a final against Sutton United, who were the last English team to reach {{the final of the}} semi-professional tournament.|$|E
5|$|In Cambridge, Massachusetts, MIT {{cryogenics}} researchers Jason Nichols (Joseph Fuqua) and Lucas Menand (Jed Rees) become {{embroiled in}} an argument as they walk down a city street. They are approached by an old man (Michael Fairman), who warns Menand {{that he will be}} run over by a bus at 11:46 pm that evening, but Menand ignores him. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> is arrested by campus security, his prophecy is proven true when Jason tries, but fails, to save Menand, who is promptly run over by a bus and killed at the exact time (11:46 pm).|$|E

5|$|HeliumII also {{exhibits}} a creeping effect. When a surface extends past {{the level of}} heliumII, the heliumII moves along the surface, against the force of gravity. HeliumII will escape from a vessel that is not sealed by creeping along the sides until it reaches a warmer region where it evaporates. It moves in a 30nm-thick film regardless of surface material. This film is called a Rollin film and is named <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> who first characterized this trait, Bernard V. Rollin. As {{a result of this}} creeping behavior and heliumII's ability to leak rapidly through tiny openings, {{it is very difficult to}} confine liquid helium. Unless the container is carefully constructed, the heliumII will creep along the surfaces and through valves until it reaches somewhere warmer, where it will evaporate. Waves propagating across a Rollin film are governed by the same equation as gravity waves in shallow water, but rather than gravity, the restoring force is the van der Waals force. These waves are known as third sound.|$|E
5|$|The end of {{the action}} {{signaled}} the first victory over an enemy warship for the newly formed United States Navy. After Barreaut had struck his colors, Truxtun sent a boat over to board, identify, and take possession of the French vessel. It was only upon boarding L'Insurgente that the Americans learned the identity of their opponents. The storm and the battle had caused immense damage to the French frigate. In comparison, Constellation had suffered moderate damage to her rigging, but was otherwise still intact. French casualties included 29 killed and 41 wounded, while the Americans suffered two dead and two wounded. One American died shortly after the action ended, of wounds received from French fire; another was executed for cowardice by Constellations Lieutenant Andrew Sterett <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> deserted his gun {{at the start of}} the action.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>Man</b> and His World summer {{exhibitions}} were discontinued, {{with most}} pavilions and remnants demolished between 1985 and 1987, the former site for Expo 67 on Saint Helen's Island and Notre Dame Island {{was incorporated into}} a municipal park run {{by the city of}} Montreal. In 2000, the park was renamed from Parc des Îles to Parc Jean-Drapeau, after Mayor Jean Drapeau, who had brought the exhibition to Montreal. In 2006, the corporation that runs the park also changed its name from the Société du parc des Îles to the Société du parc Jean-Drapeau. Today very little remains of Expo but two prominent buildings remain in use on the former Expo grounds: the American pavilion's metal-lattice skeleton from its Buckminster Fuller dome, now enclosing an environmental sciences museum called the Montreal Biosphere; and Habitat 67, now a condominium residence. Also, the France and Quebec pavilions now form the Montreal Casino. La Toundra Hall is part of the surviving structural remains of the Canadian pavilion. It is now a special events and banquet hall, while another part of the pavilion serves as the administration building of Parc Jean-Drapeau (Katimavik's distinctive inverted pyramid and {{much of the rest of}} the Canadian pavilion were dismantled during the 1970s).|$|E

5|$|Vietnamese {{president}} Trần Đức Lương {{expressed his}} {{thanks to the}} Chinese government on May 22 for rescuing the Vietnamese on the imperiled ships. Residents and industries in Vietnam raised ₫360million (VND, $36,000USD) {{for the families of}} the deceased fishermen, as well as providing 1ton of rice. Trade unions encouraged workers to donate one day's salary to help storm victims. The Vietnamese embassy in India raised about $1,000 (USD) and Vietnamese people living in Greece raised ₫26million (VND, €1,300 Euros) for storm victims. Ultimately, 43 different organizations and people donated $29,000 (USD) to the Vietnam Red Cross. The country's Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs presented an award to the Vietnam News Agency in June 2006 for its charitable donations, which included the distribution of ₫112million (VND, $11,200USD) to storm victims. One fisherman claimed to survive for two weeks in the open seas before being rescued, although he later confessed that he was safely on another boat, and wanted his family to retain the disaster compensation; <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> revealed that he had lied, his family was able to retain the relief funds due to their poverty. The head of the Vietnam Institute of Meteorology, Hydrology and Environment resigned two weeks after Chanchu killed many fishermen because of inadequate warnings. Then-Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung ordered a review of the meteorological agency as a result. Within a few years after the typhoon, the meteorological agency began issuing more accurate and timely forecasts. After the many deaths of fishermen from Chanchu, the Vietnam government prevented any fishermen from leaving harbor during the passage of Typhoon Durian in November.|$|E

He committed his first homicide when he was 19; one night during a party at his house, he shot a man dead <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> laughed at him. He fled thereafter to the state of Sonora and got involved in drug trafficking and organized crime.|$|E
25|$|During sexual intercourse, {{most women}} {{experience}} involuntary vaginal contractions. The contraction causes the pelvic muscles to tighten around the penis, {{which in turn}} increases the level of her partner's arousal and sexual frenzy and results in the man increasing the pace and force of thrusts as he approaches orgasm; which in turn further increases the woman's vaginal contraction. After a man has achieved orgasm, he will normally collapse onto the woman and will normally not be capable of further thrusting. Some men try to control their orgasm until their female partner also orgasms, {{but this is not}} always achieved. At times, a woman can achieve orgasm <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> has ceased thrusting by contracting her vaginal muscles and with pelvic movements, or the couple may change to another position that enables the woman to continue thrusting until she has reached orgasm, such as a woman on top position.|$|E
