5|$|In around 1770 {{the neoclassical}} {{architect}} Robert Adam designed Pulteney Bridge, a three-arched bridge spanning the River Avon. He used as his prototype an original, but unused, design by Andrea Palladio for the Rialto Bridge in Venice. Adam also submitted {{plans for the}} new Assembly Rooms but these were rejected as too costly. John Wood, the Younger raised funding {{for the construction of}} the Assembly Rooms by the use of a Tontine, an investment plan that is named after the Neapolitan banker Lorenzo de Tonti, who is credited with inventing it in France in 1653. It combines features of a group <b>annuity</b> and a lottery. Each subscriber pays an agreed sum into the fund, and thereafter receives an <b>annuity.</b> As members die, their shares devolve to the other participants, and so the value of each <b>annuity</b> increases. On the death of the last member, the scheme is wound up. Construction started in 1769 and was completed in 1771, when a grand opening was held.|$|E

He introduced a bill signed into law that allows FERS employees to buy back credit from a lapse in federal service toward <b>annuity</b> payments, with the goal of attracting individuals from the private sector back to public service. Moran also authored a law that allows a federal worker’s unused sick leave to count toward their <b>annuity.</b> In the 112th Congress, he also spoke against attempts by Republicans to cut back the size of the federal workforce.|$|E

5|$|The land now {{occupied}} by Lyme Park was granted to Piers Legh {{and his wife}} Margaret D'anyers, by letters patent dated January 4, 1398, by RichardII, son of the Black Prince. Margaret D'anyers' grandfather, Sir Thomas D'anyers, had taken part in retrieving the standard of the Black Prince at the Battle of Crécy in 1346, and was rewarded with <b>annuity</b> of 40 marks a year by the Black Prince, drawn on his Cheshire estate, and which could be exchanged for land of that value belonging to the Black Prince. Sir Thomas died in 1354, and the <b>annuity</b> passed to his nearest surviving kin, his granddaughter Margaret, who in 1388 married the first Piers Legh (Piers LeghI). RichardII favoured Piers and granted his family a coat of arms in 1397, and the estate of Lyme Handley in 1398 redeeming the <b>annuity.</b> However, Piers was executed two years later by Richard's rival for the throne, Henry Bolingbroke.|$|E
5|$|The theatre {{was erected}} in 1805, {{replacing}} the Old Orchard Street Theatre which had obtained a royal patent in 1768 enabling {{the use of}} the title 'Theatre Royal', the first to achieve this outside London. The Orchard Street site became a church and is now a Freemason's Hall. The new theatre was first proposed in 1802 at several sites in Bath until the current site was chosen in 1804; funding was raised by the use of a Tontine, an investment plan named after the Neapolitan banker Lorenzo de Tonti, who is credited with inventing it in France in 1653. It combined features of a group <b>annuity</b> and a lottery. Each subscriber paid an agreed sum into the fund, and thereafter received an <b>annuity.</b> As members died, their shares devolved to the other participants, and so the value of each <b>annuity</b> increased. On the death of the last member, the scheme was wound up. Shares, which cost £200, were rapidly purchased, with the Prince Regent who later became George IV and his brother Prince Frederick among the subscribers. A similar scheme had previously been used for the construction of the Bath Assembly Rooms.|$|E

5|$|Peter Melbourne {{was made}} {{keeper of the}} Melbourne estate in 1377 with an annual income of £10. He was granted another 66s8d in 1386, and 10marks (£613s4d) in 1395. The last award was {{conditional}} on his not meddling with the offices of constable and keeper of the parks, which had passed on to his son, also called Peter. The younger Peter Melbourne {{was involved in the}} upbringing of the future Henry IV during the reign of Richard II. He was again appointed constable and steward of the Derbyshire manor in March 1399, although he gave up his office in April in return for an <b>annuity</b> from King Richard, who had confiscated the Lancastrian estates when John of Gaunt died earlier that year. Upon Henry's seizure of the throne, Peter was confirmed as constable, and in October 1399 his <b>annuity</b> was increased from £10 to 100marks (£668s); in the following year he was awarded land in Derbyshire confiscated from Thomas Merke, Bishop of Carlisle, co-leader of plot against the King.|$|E

40|$|We derive {{the optimal}} {{life-cycle}} portfolio choice and consumption pattern for households facing uncertain labor income, risky capital market, and mortality risk. In addition to stocks and bonds, the households {{have access to}} deferred <b>annuities.</b> Deferred payout life <b>annuities</b> are financial contracts providing life-long income to the annuitant after a specified period of time conditional on survival. We find that deferred <b>annuities</b> {{play an important role}} in household portfolios and generate significant welfare gains. Households with high benefits from state pensions, moderate risk aversion and moderate labor income risk purchase deferred <b>annuities</b> from age 40 and gradually increase their portfolio share. At retirement, deferred <b>annuities</b> account for 78 % of total financial wealth. Households with low state pensions and high labor income risk purchase more <b>annuities</b> and earlier. Uncertainty with respect to future mortality rates has the same effect, i. e. household hedge against longevity risks using deferred <b>annuities.</b> Portfolio choice Household finance Deferred life <b>annuities</b> Stochastic mortality...|$|R

All $20 and up games currently in circulation and most $10 games offer a top prize of at least $1 million (annuitized).

Despite this, the family was deeply in debt and lived abroad from 1883, in order to economise. The Tecks travelled throughout Europe, visiting their various relations. They stayed in Florence, Italy, for a time, where May enjoyed visiting the art galleries, churches, and museums.|$|E
