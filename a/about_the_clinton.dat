Wolfson argued that {{this was part of}} [...] "a pattern of tasteless comments by MSNBC anchors <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> campaign" [...] and suggested that Clinton's participation in the scheduled, MSNBC-sponsored Cleveland debate could be jeopardized. The Clinton campaign agreed to continue with the debate after the apology was offered. In a February 12 interview with Chris Plante on WMAL-AM, [...] "former President Bill Clinton implied the media has been unfair to his wife, stated that she was standing up to sexism when she took on NBC, and -- when asked about MSNBC's David Shuster's comments about his daughter, Chelsea -- said there was a double standard."

2500|$|From 2009 to 2013, the Russian {{atomic energy}} agency Rosatom {{acquired}} Uranium One, a Canadian company with global uranium mining stakes including 20percent of the uranium production capacity in the United States. The strategically sensitive acquisition required {{the approval of the}} Canadian government {{as well as a number}} of U.S. governmental bodies including the State Department. In April 2015, The New York Times reported that, during the acquisition, the family foundation of Uranium One's chairman made $2.35 million in donations to the Clinton Foundation. Also during this time, Bill Clinton received a $500,000 payment from Renaissance Capital, a Russian investment bank whose analysts were praising Uranium One stock, for making speech in Moscow. The Foundation donations were not publicly disclosed by the Clinton Foundation or the State Department, despite a prior agreement to do so, in part due to taking advantage of the donations going through a Canadian affiliate of the Foundation. A FactCheck.org analysis stated that while the reports raised [...] "legitimate questions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> Foundation and its donations," [...] the reports [...] "presented no evidence that the donations influenced Clinton's official actions." [...] Asked about the issue in June 2015, the former secretary said of the State Department's role in the approval, [...] "There were nine government agencies that that had to sign off on that deal.

[...] McCain subsequently apologized profusely, and <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> White House accepted his apology. McCain has not shied away from addressing his shortcomings, and apologizing for them. He is known for sometimes being prickly and hot-tempered with Senate colleagues, but his relations with his own Senate staff have been more cordial, and have inspired loyalty towards him.

5000|$|From the beginning, Susan McDougal {{charged that}} Starr offered her [...] "global immunity" [...] from other charges {{if she would}} {{cooperate}} with the Whitewater investigation. McDougal told the jury that refusing to answer questions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clintons</b> and Whitewater wasn't easy for her, or her family. [...] "It's been a long road, a very long road...and {{it was not an}} easy decision to make", McDougal told the court. McDougal refused to answer any questions while under oath, leading to her being imprisoned by the judge for civil contempt of court for the maximum 18 months, including eight months in isolation. Starr's subsequent indictment of McDougal for criminal contempt of court charges resulted in a jury hung 7-5, in favor of acquittal. President Clinton later pardoned her, shortly before leaving office (see list of people pardoned by Bill Clinton).|$|R

He was named a senior writer in March 1999, and White House correspondent later that year. He was named Chief Washington Correspondent in October 2006. In 1986 Sanger {{played a major role}} in the team that investigated the causes of the space shuttle Challenger disaster. The team revealed the design flaws and bureaucratic troubles that contributed to the disaster, and won the 1987 Pulitzer Prize for national reporting. A decade later he was a member of another Pulitzer-winning team that wrote <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> administration's struggles to control exports to China.|$|E
50|$|In 1992, {{he became}} the {{personal}} attorney of Hillary Clinton (per her memoir) and assisted <b>the</b> <b>Clintons</b> when their aide Vince Foster committed suicide. After criticism arose {{as to whether it}} was appropriate for Barnett to represent so many newscasters and journalists who were reporting on the White House while also serving as lawyer to the Clintons; Barnett resigned from representing <b>the</b> <b>Clintons</b> turning his work over to fellow Williams, Connolly & Califano attorney David E. Kendall. He represented George Stephanopoulos in an incriminating book <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clintons.</b> In 1997, after his wife resigned from CBS, he went back to representing <b>the</b> <b>Clintons,</b> and helped to negotiate the sale of their post-presidential memoirs; and helped former Clinton officials to secure new employment (Donna Shalala as president of the University of Miami and Lawrence Summers as president of Harvard University. He also represented Dick Cheney, Laura Bush, Jenna Bush, George Tenet, Alan Greenspan, and Tony Blair in securing book contracts and advances with publishers. In December 2000, he auctioned Hillary Clinton's memoirs to Simon & Schuster for $8 million - then the 2nd-largest advance ever paid for a nonfiction title; and followed it in August 2001 with Bill Clinton’s memoirs for $10 million, the largest nonfiction advance to date. He later secured multi-million dollar book deals for Tim Russert; Edward Kennedy; Carl Rove (purchased by former client Mary Maitlin); and in 2004, Barack Obama with the reissuance of Dreams From My Father and sell The Audacity of Hope and Change We Can Believe In. Despite this, he remained a Hillary Clinton supporter and assisted her preparing for all her debates against Obama. Bartlett prided himself on representing clients regardless of political affiliation and also assisted outgoing Republican officials, Karen Hughes and Ari Fleischer, in finding new positions.|$|R

50|$|Despite fervent {{speculation}} that the report contained damning evidence <b>about</b> corruption in <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> Administration, <b>the</b> report when released demonstrated only the dangers of independent counsels operating without ordinary prosecutorial supervision; indeed Barrett's abuses were routinely cited {{as one of the}} reasons the Independent Counsel Act was not renewed. He brought no charges and the report contained no evidence of any conspiracy. Since the release of Barrett's report, no one has paid any attention to it, and the Republican journalists and politicians who made accusatory statements prior to its release were strangely silent afterwards.|$|R
5000|$|In October 2016, The Wall Street Journal {{reported}} that four field {{offices of the}} Federal Bureau of Investigation—in New York, Los Angeles, Washington, and Little Rock, Ark. -- had been collecting information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> Foundation to determine whether [...] "there was evidence of financial crimes or influence-peddling." [...] According to the WSJ article, FBI officials presented their findings to the Justice Department in February 2016, but [...] "the meeting didn't go well". Justice Department officials felt the cases were weak and saw little reason to continue the investigations. However, the New York FBI field office continued to pursue the matter, leading to reports that some New York agents were feuding with the Justice Department and basing their investigation in part on media accounts and in particular on the book Clinton Cash, written by Peter Schweizer, a senior editor-at-large for Breitbart News.|$|E

The magazine also published a very critical article <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> Administration's health care plan, commonly known as [...] "Hillarycare" [...] due to its close association with then First Lady Hillary Clinton, by Elizabeth McCaughey. Alterman called this article [...] "dishonest, misinformed", and [...] "the single most influential article published in the magazine during the entire Clinton presidency", while James Fallows of The Atlantic noted the article's inaccuracies and that [...] "The White House issued a point-by-point rebuttal, which The New Republic did not run.

5|$|The 1899 Rock Island Railroad Bridge {{across the}} Arkansas River, {{originally}} leading to Choctaw Station, {{has been converted}} into a pedestrian bridge connecting to North Little Rock. On the fifth anniversary of <b>the</b> library's opening, <b>Clinton</b> said that construction on the project would begin in 2010, but full funding had not yet been secured, as the project was still short <b>about</b> $3 million. <b>The</b> <b>Clinton</b> Foundation had originally planned to renovate the bridge for $4 million in exchange for a $1-a-year land lease from the state. In 2009, Arkansas governor Mike Beebe agreed to use $2.5 million of stimulus funds to fund part of the renovation. A previous $8 million earmark for the project had failed to pass the state legislature. In 2010, fundraising was finally completed for the bridge, renamed as <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> Park Bridge, and construction began on May 28, 2010.

5000|$|President Trump {{formally}} dismissed Comey on May 9, 2017, {{less than}} 4 years into his 10-year term as Director of the FBI. The White House initially stated the firing {{was on the}} recommendation of United States Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Rosenstein had sent a memorandum to Sessions, forwarded to Trump, in which Rosenstein listed objections to Comey's conduct in the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails. This allowed the Trump administration to attribute Comey's firing to Rosenstein's recommendation <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> email controversy. It was later revealed that on May 8, Trump had requested Sessions and Rosenstein to detail in writing a case against Comey. Rosenstein's memo was forwarded to Trump on May 9 and was then construed as a recommendation to dismiss Comey, which Trump immediately did. In Trump's termination letter to Comey, he attributed the firing to the two letters from Sessions and Rosenstein. On May 10, Trump told reporters he had fired Comey because Comey [...] "wasn't doing a good job".|$|E
5000|$|When {{asked by}} CNN's Jake Tapper in June 2016 {{if it was}} fair to criticize the American charity, the Clinton Foundation, for taking money from foreign governments which do not {{represent}} our values, Sanders responded: [...] "Yes it is. It is. If you ask me <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> Foundation, do I have a problem when a sitting {{secretary of state and}} a foundation run by her husband collects many millions of dollars from foreign governments, governments which are dictatorships -- you don't have a lot of civil liberties or democratic rights in Saudi Arabia. You don't {{have a lot of respect}} there for opposition points of view for gay rights, for women's rights. Yes, do I have a problem with that? Yes, I do." [...] In September 2016, Sanders told NBC's Chuck Todd that if Clinton becomes president of the United States, she should cease all contact with the Foundation, but stopped short of agreeing it should be closed, noting, [...] "I don't know enough.

5000|$|Prior to its broadcast, {{conservative}} {{talk radio}} host Hugh Hewitt described as [...] "a very accurate docudrama" [...] and claimed the controversy {{by suggesting that}} what they call [...] "the deep anger of the Clinton political machine" [...] or the [...] "narcissistic whining of the Clinton coterie" [...] amounts to [...] "self-serving complaints," [...] to [...] "an irrelevant diversion," [...] to a [...] "repellent" [...] "hissy fit". Brent Bozell wrote, also before it was broadcast, that both [...] "Clinton and Bush officials come under fire, and if it seems more anti-Clinton, that's only {{because they were in}} office a lot longer than Team Bush before 9-11. Indeed, the film drives home the point that from our enemies' perspective, it's irrelevant who is in the White House. They simply want to kill Americans and destroy America. The film doesn't play favorites, and the Bush administration takes its lumps as well." [...] Hewitt added that the [...] "program is not primarily <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> stewardship—or lack thereof—of the national security. It is not even secondarily about that.

5000|$|After {{the success}} of The Real Anita Hill, Free Press paid Brock a $550,000 advance {{to write a book}} <b>about</b> Hillary <b>Clinton.</b> <b>The</b> {{expectation}} was {{that it would be a}} takedown in the style of his writings on Anita Hill and Bill <b>Clinton.</b> <b>The</b> project, however, took a different turn, and the resulting book, The Seduction of Hillary Rodham, proved to be largely sympathetic to Mrs. Clinton. Having received a $1 million advance and a tight one-year deadline from Simon & Schuster's then-conservative-focused Free Press subsidiary, Brock was under tremendous pressure to produce another bestseller. However, the book contained no major scoops. In Blinded by the Right (2002), Brock said that he had reached a turning point: he had thoroughly examined charges against <b>the</b> <b>Clintons,</b> could not find any evidence of wrongdoing and did not want to make any more misleading claims. Brock further said that his former friends in right-wing politics shunned him because Seduction did not adequately attack <b>the</b> <b>Clintons.</b> National Review proposed another theory: since [...] "no liberal source in the world would talk to Brock", he could not collect the kind of information he was after. National Review also suggested that while writing the book, Brock had been [...] "seduced" [...] by Sidney Blumenthal, a champion and friend of <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> circle.|$|R
