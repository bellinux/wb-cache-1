5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{there are also}} many incompatibilists who reject the {{argument}} {{because they believe that}} the will is free in a stronger sense called libertarianism. These philosophers affirm the course of the world is either a) not completely determined by natural law where natural law is intercepted by physically independent agency, b) determined by indeterministic natural law only, or c) determined by indeterministic natural law in line with the subjective effort of physically non-reducible agency. Under Libertarianism, the will {{does not have to be}} deterministic and, therefore, it is potentially free. Critics of the second proposition (b) accuse the incompatibilists of using an incoherent concept of freedom. They argue as follows: if our will is not determined by anything, then we desire what we desire by pure chance. And if what we desire is purely accidental, we <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>free.</b> So if our will is not determined by anything, we <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>free.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the context}} of {{philosophy}} of mind, the problem of free will takes on renewed intensity. This is certainly the case, at least, for materialistic determinists. According to this position, natural laws completely determine {{the course of the}} material world. Mental states, and therefore the will as well, would be material states, which means human behavior and decisions would be completely determined by natural laws. Some take this reasoning a step further: people cannot determine by themselves what they want and what they do. Consequently, they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>free.</b>|$|E
5|$|Jordan {{contains}} {{some of the}} oldest Christian communities in the world, dating {{as early as the}} 1st century AD after the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. Christians today make up about 4% of the population, down from 20% in 1930, however their absolute number grew. This is due to high immigration rates of Muslims into Jordan, higher emigration rates of Christians to the west and higher birth rates for Muslims. Jordanian Christians number around 250,000, all of whom are Arabic-speaking, according to a 2014 estimate by the Orthodox Church. The study excluded minority Christian groups and the thousands of western, Iraqi and Syrian Christians residing in Jordan. Christians are exceptionally well integrated in the Jordanian society and enjoy a high level of freedom, though they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>free</b> to evangelize Muslims. Christians traditionally occupy two cabinet posts, and are reserved 9 seats out of the 130 in the parliament. The highest political position reached by a Christian is deputy prime minister, held by Marwan al-Muasher in 2005. Christians are also influential in media. Smaller religious minorities include Druze and Bahá'ís. Most Jordanian Druze live in the eastern oasis town of Azraq, some villages on the Syrian border, and the city of Zarqa, while most Jordanian Bahá'ís live in the village of Adassiyeh bordering the Jordan Valley.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} argued that {{mainstream}} medical ethics is biased by the assumption of a framework in which individuals <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>free</b> to contract with one another to provide whatever medical treatment is demanded, subject to the ability to pay. Because the welfare state typically provides a high proportion of medical care, and because there are legal restrictions on what treatment may be provided and by whom, an automatic divergence may exist between patient wishes and the preferences of medical practitioners and other parties.|$|E
25|$|Another {{issue that}} arises with non-finitely {{generated}} modules {{is that there}} are torsion-free modules which <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>free.</b> For instance, consider the ring Z of integers. Then Q is a torsion-free Z-module which is not free. Another classical example of such a module is the Baer–Specker group, the group of all sequences of integers under termwise addition. In general, the question of which infinitely generated torsion-free abelian groups are free depends on which large cardinals exist. A consequence is that any structure theorem for infinitely generated modules depends on a choice of set theory axioms and may be invalid under a different choice.|$|E

25|$|When {{the parties}} express a clear {{intention}} in a choice-of-law clause, {{there is a}} rebuttable presumption {{that this is the}} proper law because it reflects the parties' freedom of contract and it produces certainty of outcome. It can only be rebutted when the choice is not bona fide, it produces illegality, or it breaches public policy. For example, the parties may have selected the particular law to evade the operation of otherwise mandatory provisions of the law which has the closest connection with the contract. The parties <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>free</b> to put themselves above the law and, in such cases, it will be for the parties to prove that there is a valid reason for selecting that law other than evasion.|$|E
25|$|Like other archosaurs, {{crocodilians}} are diapsid, {{although their}} post-temporal fenestrae are reduced. The {{walls of the}} braincase are bony but lack supratemporal and postfrontal bones. Their tongues <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>free,</b> but {{held in place by}} a membrane that limits movement; as a result, crocodiles are unable to stick out their tongues. Crocodiles have smooth skin on their bellies and sides, while their dorsal surfaces are armoured with large osteoderms. The armoured skin has scales and is thick and rugged, providing some protection. They are still able to absorb heat through this armour, as a network of small capillaries allows blood through the scales to absorb heat. Crocodilian scales have pores believed to be sensory in function, analogous to the lateral line in fishes. They are particularly seen on their upper and lower jaws. Another possibility is that they are secretory, as they produce an oily substance which appears to flush mud off.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} states of afterlife in Catholic belief. Heaven {{is a time}} of glorious union with God and a life of unspeakable joy that lasts forever. Purgatory is a {{temporary}} place for the purification of souls who, although saved, <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>free</b> enough from sin to enter directly into heaven. It is a state requiring penance and purgation of sin through God's mercy aided by the prayers of others. Finally, those who freely chose a life of sin and selfishness, were not sorry for their sins and had no intention of changing their ways go to hell, an everlasting separation from God. The Church teaches that no one is condemned to hell without freely deciding to reject God and his love. He predestines no one to hell and no one can determine whether anyone else has been condemned. Catholicism teaches that God's mercy is such that a person can repent even at the point of death and be saved, like the good thief who was crucified next to Jesus.|$|E

25|$|Contrary to a stockbroker, a {{professional}} who arranges transactions between a buyer and a seller, {{and gets a}} guaranteed commission for every deal executed, {{a professional}} trader may have a steep learning curve and his/her ultra-competitive performance based career may be cut short, especially during generalized stock market crashes. Stock market trading operations have a considerably high level of risk, uncertainty and complexity, especially for unwise and inexperienced stock traders/investors seeking {{an easy way to}} make money quickly. In addition, trading activities <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>free.</b> Stock speculators/investors face several costs such as commissions, taxes and fees to be paid for the brokerage and other services, like the buying/selling orders placed at the stock exchange. Depending on the nature of each national or state legislation involved, a large array of fiscal obligations must be respected, and taxes are charged by jurisdictions over those transactions, dividends and capital gains that fall within their scope. However, these fiscal obligations will vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Among other reasons, there could be some instances where taxation is already incorporated into the stock price through the differing legislation that companies have to comply with in their respective jurisdictions; or that tax free stock market operations are useful to boost economic growth. Beyond these costs are the opportunity costs of money and time, currency risk, financial risk, and Internet, data and news agency services and electricity consumption expenses—all of which must be accounted for.|$|E
25|$|Lienhard’s {{keen sense}} of {{observation}} {{was not limited to}} outward features, but involved his heart and mind as well. Although he respected the indigenous people from the start as the natives of the land, his early comments <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>free</b> from the typical ethnocentric views of the whites. Gradually his perspective changed, especially during his stay at Mimal on the Yuba River, where he lived for six months in isolation from white settlers and in close contact with the indigenous peoples of the surrounding villages. Some gathered regularly at his house, observed his activities with interest, traded, or occasionally helped with garden work. They taught him to become a first-rate archer, now and then took him along to their families, and nursed him back to health when he fell ill. Thus Lienhard began to observe their daily life and marveled at their skill in basketry, hunting and fishing. He often joined them in those pursuits and describes their methods of procuring and preparing food. His observations led him to understand that these people had organized their style of life in creative symbiosis with their surroundings, that their customs, though different, were ingenious, and that assessing them from a culturally biased vantage point did not do them justice. His growing understanding was extraordinary and increasingly run counter to the then dominant views. One night in the winter of 1848–49, he overheard his young Indian herdsmen talking of the times before the whites had invaded their valleys and of the ever worsening conditions. “The subdued talk of the Indians caused me to ponder,” he wrote. “In my thoughts I tried to put myself in the position of the Indians; and I wondered whether I would acquiesce if I were driven out of my and my ancestors’ homeland as had been the fate of the poor Indians. I confess that I was overwhelmed by strong feelings of revenge, always coming to the conclusion that I would take revenge on the shameless, greedy invaders in every possible way.” He knew from first-hand experience, however, that cooperation, escape, or resistance could all mean death for indigenous people.|$|E
