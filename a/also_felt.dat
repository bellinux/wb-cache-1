5|$|Gray abhorred slavery. In his view, science {{proved the}} unity of all man because all human races can interbreed and produce fertile offspring, i.e., all members of a species are {{connected}} genetically. He <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> Christianity taught {{the unity of}} man. He was not an abolitionist, feeling {{it was more important}} to preserve the Union, yet he <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> if the South persevered in the conflict, every slave should be set free, by use of more force if necessary. However, he was not sure what should be done with the freed slaves. This was another area where Gray and Agassiz disagreed; Agassiz felt each race had different origins.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of It's a Feedelity Affair in 2006, Lindstrøm had become tired of {{producing}} dance remixes and average length vocal pieces. He began giving the artists and labels mixes with slower tempos. Lindstrøm <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> he was unwisely incorporating musical ideas into remixes instead of original works, which led to experiments with lengthier tracks for an original album. Four to five tracks were originally envisioned for Where You Go I Go Too, but only three were chosen.|$|E
5|$|Hershey {{landed a}} role in Richard Rush's The Stunt Man (1980), marking {{a return to the}} big screen after four years and earning her {{critical}} praise.

She <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> The Stunt Man was an important transition for her, from playing girls to playing women.|$|E

5|$|On 30 March 1945, {{the daily}} comic strip Rikki en Wiske started {{to appear in}} the {{newspaper}} De Nieuwe Standaard, after a positive review by the young illustrator Marc Sleen. It was an immediate success, and the first story ran uninterrupted until 15 December 1945.

5|$|Reviewers were {{consistent}} in their praises and {{criticism of the}} album. They noted the high production values {{and the quality of}} the original compositions and the performance of the orchestra. They <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> that the later tracks in the album were notably weaker than the early tracks, that the arrangements in general did not stray far from the source material, and that several of the track choices did not seem to fit as well as orchestral renditions as others.|$|E

5|$|The Egyptian singer Umm Kulthum {{hosted a}} public celebration for the officers' return despite {{reservations}} from the royal government, {{which had been}} pressured by the British to prevent the reception. The apparent difference in attitude {{between the government and}} the general public increased Nasser's determination to topple the monarchy. Nasser had <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> bitter that his brigade had not been relieved despite the resilience it displayed. He started writing his book Philosophy of the Revolution during the siege.|$|E

5|$|The game {{received}} universal acclaim from critics, who {{praised the}} enhanced vehicle physics, updated visuals, and strong sound design. Several reviewers also gave {{high marks for}} the game's Autovista mode.

5|$|Wharton later {{stated that}} Thin Lizzy {{would have been}} better suited to playing fewer concerts, in bigger venues. He <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> that after the {{experience}} of fronting his own band Dare, it was not satisfying enough to play keyboards behind Gorham and Sykes. Sykes said that all the previous Thin Lizzy members were welcome to play with Thin Lizzy at any time.|$|E
5|$|When {{considering}} the project, Charles Cecil {{played the game}} again and noticed many issues, including pixilated backgrounds, FMV and audio were of poor quality, and he <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> some dialogue was out of place.

5|$|While the {{procession}} was an actual historic event, Matejko took many artistic liberties, such as including persons {{who were not}} in fact present or had died earlier. He did so because he intended the painting to be a synthesis of {{the final years of}} the Commonwealth. He <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> that there was no real historic moment or location that fully captured the spirit of the Constitution, and so he, the artist, needed to create such a moment.|$|E
5|$|According to Mihardja, {{religious}} thinkers {{blasted the}} novel for depicting Hasan, whom they interpreted {{as representative of}} religion and religious people, as unable to overcome temptation; they also disliked the novel's lack of in-depth discussion of religion, necessary for {{a better understanding of}} theism. Marxists and anarchists <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> that their ideologies were not well explained. They considered Rusli and Anwar not truly representative of the thoughts of Karl Marx and Friedrich Nietzsche. In response, Mihardja wrote that the characters were meant to be realistic, and that few people have as much knowledge about an ideology as demanded by the critics.|$|E
5|$|Adam Gutschmidt, {{reviewing}} the event for Online Onslaught, gave {{a rating of}} one-quarter star for the Nightstick on a Pole match and one-half star each for the High Energy vs. The Headshrinkers match and the Yokozuna vs. Virgil match. He enjoyed the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match, although he was disappointed by its lack of buildup prior to the event. He <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> that the Flair/Ramon vs. Savage/Perfect match {{was a good one}} until the ending got out of control. Pro Wrestling Torch columnist agreed, stating that the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match was the best and that the Flair/Ramon vs. Savage/Perfect bout was also enjoyable, but he recommended fast-forwarding {{through the rest of the}} show.|$|E

De Peyster's father paid ten-dollar bounties to the men who signed the muster roll of his company.

In 2001, this new company merged with the UGG to form Agricore United. In 2007, the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool took it over, forming Viterra.

5|$|Despite debuting with {{moderate}} viewing figures, {{the departure of}} Carell affected the show's ratings, which fell as the season progressed.

Other critics were more positive, complimenting various actors and their characters. It {{marked the first time}} since season one that the show did not receive any Emmy nominations.|$|E
