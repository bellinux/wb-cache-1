Roach and perch have already been caught and we have had no reports of any ill-effects. There is no doubt the pollution is clearing.

In the government building a garden has been laid out, and all sorts of trees have been planted which <b>are</b> <b>sure</b> to prosper, for the few shrubs planted two years ago by the steam mill at the south-east end of the road have grown considerably. The lively construction activity is also causing a lively exploitation of the ruins.|$|E
25|$|Ghost detainees are extrajudicial prisoners whose identities {{have not}} been {{revealed}} and whose families (and frequently, governments) {{have not been}} informed of their status. They are deprived of all legal rights. Ghost detainees' identities, and capture, have been kept secret. As such they are a subset of extrajudicial prisoners, which includes all the detainees who were held in Guantanamo, etc.. They <b>are</b> <b>sure</b> to face multiple, repeated torture sessions {{at the hands of}} skilled CIA torture liaisons, until it is determined what they have done wrong.|$|E

25|$|Farmers Dance (rice growers dance) This is {{a modern}} dance created by the Thai Ministry of Culture. The dancers wear the rice growers {{traditional}} costume and the dance itself enacts the daily activities of these workers who are {{the backbone of the}} nation. The ballet opens with the farmers as they come to plow and sow the fields. When they <b>are</b> <b>sure</b> that the rice is growing well, they gather together to pray to Mae Po Sop, the goddess who protects rice-growing. Lastly, the harvest is celebrated with songs and dancing.|$|E
25|$|When Beresford {{departed}} {{as commander}} of the channel fleet he commented, I 'heartily give you all the credit you so richly deserve for making Caesar the most brilliantly smart ship on the water', and 'you are certain of a most brilliant career in the service and <b>are</b> <b>sure</b> {{to become one of}} Britain's most efficient admirals'. Evan-Thomas was now also in a position to himself assist other officers up the career ladder, and received formal thanks from Commander Michael Culme-Seymour, son of his previous commander, for help in obtaining promotion. A note from Lord Knollys to Beresford commended Evan-Thomas for good results in gunnery trials.|$|E
25|$|The final {{estimate}} of corn production {{for the years}} 1950 to 1959 in the United States is given as some three billion bushels and in recent years, some nine billion bushels are produced each year. Corn growth is dominated by west north central Iowa and east central Illinois. In 2011, the national average production was 147 bushels per acre, and reported to be 20 bushels per acre more than the yield in 2002. Based on a national contest in 2011 when an average of 300 bushels per acre was achieved others <b>are</b> <b>sure</b> to follow suit which result in a yield of 300 bushels per acre by 2030 from the same extent land holdings under corn.|$|E

25|$|Survival International {{campaigns for}} the uncontacted tribes in the {{territory}} of Peru, many unidentified indigenous people in Brazil, Russia, West Papua, and about 30 tribes in several countries in South America, Africa and Asia. They select their cases based on a criterion the organisation has established, which depends {{on a wide range}} of factors, such as the reliability and continuity of the information, the gravity of the situation the tribe in question is facing, the degree to which they believe their work can make a real difference, the degree to which improvements in this area would have a knock on effect for others, whether any other organisation is already working on the case, and whether they <b>are</b> <b>sure</b> of what the people themselves want.|$|E
25|$|Why {{is it that}} we <b>are</b> <b>sure</b> a {{particular}} activity — e.g. Olympic target shooting — is a game while a similar activity — e.g. military sharp shooting — is not? Wittgenstein's explanation is tied up with an important analogy. How do we recognize that two people we know are related to one another? We may see similar height, weight, eye color, hair, nose, mouth, patterns of speech, social or political views, mannerisms, body structure, last names, etc. If we see enough matches we say we've noticed a family resemblance. It is perhaps important to note that this is not always a conscious process — generally we don't catalog various similarities until we reach a certain threshold, we just intuitively see the resemblances. Wittgenstein suggests that {{the same is true of}} language. We are all familiar (i.e. socially) with enough things which are games and enough things which are not games that we can categorize new activities as either games or not.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the contingency-focused approaches mentioned, {{there has been a}} high degree of interest paid to three novel approaches that have recently emerged. The first is transformational leadership, which posits that there are certain leadership traits that inspire subordinates to perform beyond their capabilities. The second is transactional leadership, which is most concerned with keeping subordinates in-line with deadlines and organizational policy. This type of leader fills more of a managerial role and lacks qualities necessary to inspire subordinates and induce meaningful change. And the third is authentic leadership which is centered around empathy and a leader's values or character. If the leader understands their followers, they can inspire subordinates by cultivating a personal connection and leading them to share in the vision and goals of the team. Although there has been a limited amount of research conducted on these theories, they <b>are</b> <b>sure</b> to receive continued attention as the field of I/O psychology matures.|$|E

25|$|They lead Arindal to {{a portal}} guarded by earth spirits. He {{is about to}} be {{defeated}} when the voice of Groma reminds him of the shield. The earth spirits disappear when he holds it up. The fairies express their surprise but <b>are</b> <b>sure</b> he will not triumph again. Meanwhile, he thanks Groma's power. Next they encounter bronze men who guard a holy sanctuary. The shield fails Arindal but when Groma advises him to hold up the sword, the bronze men vanish. The fairies again express their surprise whilst Groma's spirit urges Arindal on. They now have reached a grotto where Ada has been turned to stone. The two fairies taunt Arindal with the threat that failure will mean that he too is turned to stone. But the voice of Groma urges him to play the lyre. When he does so (O ihr, des Busens Hochgefühle), Ada is freed from the stone. The two fairies realise that Groma is responsible.|$|E

500|$|One of the {{positions}} taken by The New-Yorker was that the unemployed of the cities should seek lives in the developing American West (in the 1830s, the West encompassed today's Midwestern states). [...] The harsh winter of 1836–1837 and the financial crisis that developed soon after made many New Yorkers homeless and destitute. [...] In his journal, Greeley urged new immigrants to buy guide books on the West, and Congress to make public lands available for purchase at cheap rates to settlers. He told his readers, [...] "Fly, scatter through the country, go to the Great West, anything rather than remain here... the West is the true destination." [...] In 1838, he advised [...] "any young man" [...] about to start in the world, [...] "Go to the West: there your capabilities <b>are</b> <b>sure</b> to be appreciated and your energy and industry rewarded." ...|$|E

500|$|Jason Birchmeier from Allmusic gave {{a mostly}} {{positive}} {{review of the}} album, commenting that [...] "fans of Arjona's straight-ahead rock style <b>are</b> <b>sure</b> to be disappointed with much of 5to Piso, as piano and strings drive much of the music rather than the electric guitar and drums of years past." [...] Billboards Leila Cobo, on her review of the album, commented that the singer had [...] "an uncanny knack for marrying sophisticated lyrics with catchy hooks and mass-appeal messages", stating that songs like [...] "Ni Tu Ni Yo", a duet with Paquita la del Barrio, [...] "underscores how universal" [...] his songs and themes are, [...] "even in the most regional arrangements." [...] 5to Piso received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Latin Pop Album and a Latin Grammy Award nomination for Best Singer-Songwriter Album though lost to Sin Frenos and Caetano Veloso respectively.|$|E
500|$|James Montgomery of MTV called A Thousand Suns a [...] "sprawling, discordant, {{ambitious and}} an all-out game changer" [...] and {{compared}} it with Radiohead's 2000 album Kid A, but said A Thousand Suns is more optimistic than Kid A. Jordy Kasko with Review Rinse Repeat gave A Thousand Suns a perfect rating, calling it an [...] "epic quest". He {{compared it to}} Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon (1973) and Radiohead's Kid A, saying [...] "A Thousand Suns is an ALBUM. It is not a collection of songs. It {{is not meant to}} be listened to as such. The band is {{going so far as to}} release an iTunes version that is one track, 47 minutes and 56 seconds long. This is no more an 'album' by conventional standards than Dark Side of the Moon or Kid A <b>are.</b> <b>Sure,</b> there are identifiable songs, but to understand or to appreciate any of them you must take them in the context of the entire album." ...|$|E
500|$|Matt Collar of Allmusic complimented {{the classic}} Christmas songs {{composed}} in a [...] "light, contemporary pop fashion," [...] noting Aly & AJ's original songs as standouts on the album. Logan Leasure of Jesus Freak Hideout commended Aly & AJ's [...] "powerhouse" [...] vocals on the tracks, but said carols such as [...] "The First Noel" [...] and [...] "Deck the Halls" [...] {{were a bit}} boring, due to the acoustic feel of the set. Overall, Leasure said [...] "This album has its good share of standout tracks that <b>are</b> <b>sure</b> to satisfy any fan of modern Christmas music." [...] He specifically pointed out [...] "Little Drummer Boy" [...] and the impressive lyrical content of [...] "Not This Year. Tampa Bay Times critic Sean Daly praised the duo's original songs, on which they [...] "ditch the wispy routine". On the other hand, he viewed {{the rest of the}} album as [...] "flat and forgettable".|$|E
