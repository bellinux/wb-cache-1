5|$|Spirometry {{measures}} {{the amount of}} airflow obstruction present and is generally carried out after {{the use of a}} bronchodilator, a medication to open up the airways. Two main components are measured to make the diagnosis: the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), which is the greatest volume of air that can be breathed out in the first second of <b>a</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> the forced vital capacity (FVC), which is the greatest volume of air that can be breathed out in a single large breath. Normally, 75–80% of the FVC comes out in the first second and a FEV1/FVC ratio of less than 70% in someone with symptoms of COPD defines a person as having the disease. Based on these measurements, spirometry would lead to over-diagnosis of COPD in the elderly. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence criteria additionally require a FEV1 of less than 80% of predicted. People with COPD also exhibit a decrease in diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) due to decreased surface area in the alveoli, as well as damage to the capillary bed.|$|E
500|$|The Deluxe Complete Edition soundtrack was {{released}} on December 18, 2007. Depp's singing was described by a New York Times reviewer as [...] "harsh and thin, but amazingly forceful". Another critic adds that, though Depp's voice [...] "does not have much heft or power", [...] "his ear is obviously excellent, because his pitch is dead-on accurate... Beyond his good pitch and phrasing, the expressive colorings of his singing are crucial to the portrayal. Beneath this Sweeney’s vacant, sullen exterior is a man consumed with a murderous rage that threatens to burst forth every time he slowly takes <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> is poised to speak. Yet when he sings, his voice crackles and breaks with sadness." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{recorded}} at the Darryl F. Zanuck Building on the 20th Century Fox lot in West Los Angeles, where {{the cast and}} crew of The Simpsons gathered on a Monday morning in October 1993. Before the recording session took part, the main voice actors of the show (Dan Castellaneta, Harry Shearer, Julie Kavner, Yeardley Smith, Nancy Cartwright, and Hank Azaria) sat down with executive producer David Mirkin and a crew of writers at a table reading to determine what shape the script was in. There was [...] "genuine hearty laughter at various points" [...] during the script run-through, said Ray Richmond, a reporter for the Los Angeles Daily News. Immediately after the reading, the crew of writers hurried to make script changes based on what got laughs and what did not, while the actors waited impatiently. Mirkin told Richmond that the script would require the equivalent of ten rewrites: [...] "At every step, there are amendments and additions and refinements." [...] Richmond commented that as the recording session started, the [...] "astounding versatility" [...] of the actors became clear; [...] "Castellaneta bounces from being Homer to Grampa to Barney without taking <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> minus any evident vocal similarities." [...] Mirkin said the episode was also a tour de force for Kavner, who in one scene voices Marge, Marge's two sisters, and Marge's mother. He added that even though she enjoyed the process, it was tough on Kavner's voice because those characters talk with [...] "gravelly voices".|$|E

500|$|Gaga first {{performed}} an acoustic-jazz {{version of the}} song at Radio 1's Big Weekend in Carlisle, Cumbria in May 15, 2011. During the song, she revealed that her record company had told her to keep new material to a minimum, {{but she said she}} wanted to air the track in full. Another piano version of the song was performed on May 21, 2011, on the season finale of Saturday Night Live, where Gaga wore a metallic black dress, knee-high boots and a semi-circular metallic headdress. The full version was first performed at the final show of American Idol season 10 on May 25, 2011, where she was joined by Clemons in person. Gaga appeared perched atop a mountain top on the [...] "Idol" [...] stage, dressed in a long cape and a bedazzled headpiece. A trio of dancers were {{at the base of the}} set performing choreographed dance steps while Gaga sang from the top. At the end of the performance, Gaga and a dancer embraced each other, took <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> then jumped off the edge of the stage, landing out of sight on a bed of fake rocks, as steam shot up high in the air. Len Melisurgo from The Star-Ledger felt that the performance was too [...] "sexually suggestive" [...] for the audience of American Idol and wondered whether Gaga [...] "went just a little too far for a family-oriented show that's geared toward a younger audience?" [...] Conversely, Adam Graham from MTV News listed it as one of Gaga's most memorable television performances. Monica Herrera from Billboard listed it as the fourth best performance of the night, and felt that Gaga [...] "channeled Bruce Springsteen" [...] in her personality.|$|E
