50|$|CECBs must consume no {{more than}} an average of 2 watts of power when not in use (no video or audio display). They must provide an <b>automatic</b> <b>power-down</b> option that can put the unit in standby mode when it has not {{received}} any commands for a while.|$|E
40|$|The AD 7827 {{is a high}} speed, single channel, low power, analogto-digital {{converter}} with {{a maximum}} throughput of 1 MSPS that operates from a single 3 V or 5 V supply. The AD 7827 contains a track/hold amplifier, an on-chip 2. 5 V reference (2 % tolerance), a 420 ns 8 -bit half-flash ADC and a serial interface. The serial interface {{is compatible with the}} serial interfaces of most DSPs (Digital Signal Processors). The throughput rate of the AD 7827 is dependent on the clock speed of the DSP serial interface. The AD 7827 combines the Convert Start and Power Down signals at one pin, i. e., the CONVST pin. This allows a unique <b>automatic</b> <b>power-down</b> {{at the end of a}} conversion to be implemented. The logic level on the CONVST pin is sampled at the end of a conversion and, depending on its state, the AD 7827 powers down...|$|E
