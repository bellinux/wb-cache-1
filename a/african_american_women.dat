5|$|Under Zinn, the Argonne National Laboratory adopted {{slightly}} more progressive hiring practices than other contemporary institutions. Three <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>women</b> and seven men, six {{of whom had}} worked on the Manhattan Project, were employed in research at Argonne {{at a time when}} the Los Alamos National Laboratory had no African American scientists. Argonne also appointed women to positions of authority, with Maria Goeppert-Mayer as a section leader in the theoretical physics division, and Hoylande Young as director of the technical information division.|$|E
5|$|Stanton's {{position}} {{caused a}} significant rift {{between herself and}} many civil rights leaders, particularly Frederick Douglass, who believed that white women, already empowered by their connection to fathers, husbands, and brothers, at least vicariously had the vote. According to Douglass, their treatment as slaves entitled the now liberated African American men, who lacked women's indirect empowerment, to voting rights before women were granted the franchise. <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>women,</b> he believed, {{would have the same}} degree of empowerment as white women once African American men had the vote; hence, general female suffrage was, according to Douglass, of less concern than black male suffrage.|$|E
25|$|It {{is unclear}} why fibroids {{are more common}} in <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>women.</b> Some studies suggest that black women who are obese and who have high blood {{pressure}} {{are more likely to have}} fibroids. Other suggested causes include the tendency of <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>women</b> to consume food with less than the daily requirements for vitamin D.|$|E
50|$|In 1920, Seymour {{became the}} first <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>woman</b> {{to run for the}} Connecticut General Assembly. She did not win, but was the first <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>woman</b> to run for this position.|$|R
50|$|Colonel Ruth Alice Lucas (November 28, 1920 - March 23, 2013), {{the first}} <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>woman</b> in the Air Force to be {{promoted}} {{to the rank of}} colonel and who {{at the time of her}} retirement was the highest-ranking <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>woman</b> in the Air Force.|$|R
50|$|The National Congress of Black Women's {{founding}} {{chairs were}} Shirley Chisholm and Dr. C. Delores Tucker. Shirley Chisholm was an educator, author, and politician. She {{became the first}} <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>woman</b> elected in Congress in 1968 and in 1972, became the first <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>woman</b> to make a serious bid to run for President of the United States. Dr. C. Delores Tucker was the first <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>woman</b> to serve as Pennsylvania Secretary of the Commonwealth, and the first African-American woman to serve as secretary of a U.S. state government.|$|R

25|$|Barrett fostered {{important}} {{relationships with}} <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>women....</b> At {{a time when}} few white organizations interacted with black women, Barrett facilitated the efforts of middle-class <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>women</b> to engage in rescue and maternity home work... The FC approach was neither revolutionary nor radical, and both white and black Crittenton workers failed to confront or challenge predominant views of race. At the same time, the Crittenton organization made inroads against racism that deserve to be recognized.|$|E

25|$|During the American Civil War, several <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>women</b> {{served as}} paid crew aboard the {{hospital}} ship Red Rover in the Mississippi River {{area in the}} position of nurse. The known names of four nurses are: Alice Kennedy, Sarah Kinno, Ellen Campbell and Betsy Young (Fowler). In addition volunteer nuns from the Catholic Sisters of the Holy Cross served aboard as nurses.|$|E
25|$|The Navy did {{not follow}} suit in {{changing}} its policies to include women of color until January 25, 1945.

25|$|Thoms {{served as}} {{president}} of the NACGN from 1916–1923, and played a critical role in lobbying for the rights of <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>women</b> to serve in the United States military during World War I. During World War I, Thoms campaigned the American Red Cross to permit black nurses to enroll. Introduced to President Warren G. Harding and First Lady Florence Kling Harding, she presented them with a basket of roses, and told them that 2000 black nurses were ready to serve their country. These efforts ultimately led to the creation of the United States Army Nurse Corps.|$|E
25|$|Despite a high {{enlistment}} {{rate in the}} U.S. Army, African Americans {{were not}} treated equally. At parades, church services, in transportation and canteens the races were kept separate. The Women's Army Corps (WAC) changed its enlistment policies in January 1941, allowing for <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>women</b> to {{join the ranks of}} Army nurses to strengthen the war effort. Much like with male soldiers, Black women were given separate training, inferior living quarters, and rations. Black nurses were integrated into everyday life with their white colleagues and often felt the pain of discrimination and slander from the wounded soldiers they cared for and the leadership assigned to them.|$|E
25|$|During the Spanish Inquisition, Spanish women (as well as Native American and <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>women</b> in the Spanish colonies) were {{expected}} to behave {{in a manner that}} would promote the Spanish culture and uphold the standards of Catholicism. Women were typically limited to the following roles: nun, wife/housewife, and mother. Any other role was looked down upon as it defied the Crown and Spanish culture. In fact, Spanish women {{were expected}} to teach the Indigenous and African women how to raise their children and take care of their family. Because familial endeavors were highly emphasized by the monarchs, Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, women were encouraged to have children, raise a family, and secure Spanish ideals and Catholic customs.|$|E

50|$|Julie Dash's Daughters of the Dust (1991) was {{the first}} {{full-length}} film with general theatrical release {{written and directed by}} an <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>woman.</b> Since then there have been several African women who have written, produced or directed films with national release. In 1994 Darnell Martin became the first <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>woman</b> to write and direct a film produced by a major studio when Columbia Pictures backed I Like It Like That. Nnegest Likké is the first <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>woman</b> to write, direct and act in a full-length movie released by a major studio, Phat Girlz (2006) starring Jimmy Jean-Louis and Mo'Nique.|$|R

25|$|In {{what some}} have speculated {{was an attempt}} at damage control {{just days after the}} interview, Barbour {{suspended}} the prison sentences of Jamie and Gladys Scott, two <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>women</b> who received life sentences resulting from a 1993 mugging in which the two women stole $11. Barbour has denied that there was any connection between the suspension of the Scott sisters' prison sentence and the controversy surrounding his Weekly Standard interview. Jamie Scott suffered from kidney failure while in prison, and requires a donated organ, which her sister Gladys had volunteered to provide. Barbour's decision to release the Scott sisters, however, is contingent upon the promised organ donation by Gladys Scott, which critics argued amounted to coercion and raises questions of medical ethics.|$|E
25|$|The {{importance}} {{of how a}} woman perceives her behavior should not be underestimated. Many women perceived sex as a chore {{as opposed to a}} pleasurable experience, and they tend to consider themselves sexually inadequate, which in turn does not motivate them to engage in sexual activity. Several factors influence a women's perception of her sexual life. These can include: race, her gender, ethnicity, educational background, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, financial resources, culture, and religion. Cultural differences are also present in how women view menopause and its impact on health, self-image, and sexuality. A study has found that <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>women</b> are the most optimistic about menopausal life; Caucasian women are the most anxious, Asian women are the most inhibited about their symptoms, and Hispanic women are the most stoic.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} {{socioeconomic}} factor of health disparities, race is another key factor. The United States historically had large disparities {{in health and}} access to adequate healthcare between races, and current evidence supports the notion that these racially centered disparities continue to exist and are a significant social health issue. The disparities in access to adequate healthcare include differences {{in the quality of}} care based on race and overall insurance coverage based on race. A 2002 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association identifies race as a significant determinant in the level of quality of care, with blacks receiving lower quality care than their white counterparts. This is in part because members of ethnic minorities such as African Americans are either earning low incomes, or living below the poverty line. In a 2007 Census Bureau, African American families made an average of $33,916, while their white counterparts made an average of $54,920. Due to a lack of affordable health care, the African American death rate reveals that African Americans have a higher rate of dying from treatable or preventable causes. According to a study conducted in 2005 by the Office of Minority Health—a U.S. Department of Health—African American men were 30% more likely than white men to die from heart disease. Also <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>women</b> were 34% more likely to die from breast cancer than their white counterparts.|$|E

500|$|Since {{federal funds}} {{had been used}} to produce the show, more {{segments}} of the population insisted upon being represented on Sesame Street. Morrow credited CTW's commitment to multiculturalism as one source for their conflicts with the leadership of minority groups, especially Latino groups and feminists. [...] These conflicts were resolved when the CTW added or substituted offending segments and characters. By 1977, the cast consisted of two <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>women,</b> one of whom was single, two African American men, a Chicano man, two white men, an American Indian woman, a Puerto Rican woman, and a Deaf white woman.|$|E
500|$|Wilson {{introduced}} a bill in Congress which would free in the Union's slave holding states the still-enslaved families of former slaves serving in the Union Army. In advocating for passage, Wilson argued that allowing the family members of soldiers to remain in slavery was a [...] "burning shame to this country... Let us hasten the enactment... that, on the forehead of the soldier's wife and the soldier's child, no man can write [...] "Slave". [...] President Lincoln signed the measure into law on March 3, 1865, and an estimated 75,000 <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>women</b> and children were freed in Kentucky alone.|$|E
