5|$|Social persuasion {{appeals to}} one’s role in <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>and</b> {{corresponding}} expectations; it appeals to reference groups, social class, culture, and subculture. The family symbol is socially persuasive {{in that it}} appeals to one’s role within the family and their corresponding expectations.|$|E
5|$|A ring likewise, has {{a set of}} elements, but now has two {{operation}}s. The first operation {{must make}} the set <b>a</b> <b>group,</b> <b>and</b> the second operation is associative and distributive {{with respect to the}} first operation. It {{may or may not be}} commutative; this means that the result of applying the operation to a first and a second element is the same as to the second and first—the order of the elements does not matter. If every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse (an element x such that ax = xa = 1), the ring is called a division ring. A field is defined as a commutative division ring.|$|E

5|$|Dixon's {{first job}} was at Ladbrokes, {{although}} she aspired {{to become a}} PE teacher after leaving college. After completing a diploma course in sports studies, she had planned {{to take up a}} place at Loughborough University, but whilst at dance classes in London she was approached by a talent scout from a production company. Whilst travelling back home on the train she was approached by another scout who was forming <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>and</b> asked if she was interested.|$|E
5|$|In addition, the National Archives of Malta offers <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>and</b> school visit {{program to}} {{increase}} {{public awareness of}} the records held there. Groups of 25 people or less may be taken through the Archives and shown what it has to offer, and school visits can be arranged in both the Archives' Rabat and Mdina locations. School students are shown through the Archives to increase awareness of what they have to offer and also shown how archived documents are handled. Students are also given the chance to experience the difficulty involved in cataloging and reorganising the Archives' items.|$|E
5|$|In {{an unusual}} case, planidium larvae of some beetles {{of the genus}} Meloe form <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>and</b> produce a {{pheromone}} that mimics the sex attractant of its host bee species. When a male bee arrives and attempts to mate with the mass of larvae, they climb onto his abdomen. From there, they transfer to a female bee, {{and from there to}} the bee nest to parasitize the bee larvae.|$|E

5|$|Many teleosts form shoals, {{which serve}} {{multiple}} purposes in different species. Schooling is sometimes an antipredator adaptation, offering improved vigilance against predators. It {{is often more}} efficient to gather food by working as <b>a</b> <b>group,</b> <b>and</b> individual fish optimise their strategies by choosing to join or leave a shoal. When a predator has been noticed, prey fish respond defensively, resulting in collective shoal behaviours such as synchronised movements. Responses do not consist only of attempting to hide or flee; antipredator tactics include for example scattering and reassembling. Fish also aggregate in shoals to spawn.|$|E
5|$|Several {{characters}} {{were based on}} real people: Aleph's mentor Okamoto was named after {{the owner of the}} building Atlus occupied during the game's development; Matsumoto was named after Ito's first landlord in Tokyo; and Mekata was named after an NHK reporter. Additionally, Red Bear was named after the evil organization from the superhero film Aikoku Sentai Dainippon. Some character designs were created with the Super Famicom hardware limitations in mind: Kaneko designed three different poses for the Twelve Heavenly Generals, which were combined in various ways with graphics for different heads and held items, along with different color palettes, resulting in twelve different combinations. He thought this acceptable as the generals were <b>a</b> <b>group,</b> <b>and</b> were meant to look cohesive.|$|E
5|$|Sylvia warblers are {{unusual in}} that they vigorously defend their territories against other members of their genus as well as conspecifics. Blackcaps and garden warblers use {{identical}} habits in the same wood, yet aggressive interactions mean that their territories never overlap. Similar songs are {{a feature of the}} Sylvia warblers as <b>a</b> <b>group,</b> <b>and</b> {{it has been suggested that}} this promotes interspecific competition and helps to segregate territories between related species. It appears more likely from later studies that segregation of sympatric species, other than the blackcap and garden warbler, is due to subtle habitat preferences rather than interspecies aggression.|$|E

5|$|Two {{important}} {{consequences of}} the group axioms are {{the uniqueness of the}} identity element and the uniqueness of inverse elements. There can be only one identity element in <b>a</b> <b>group,</b> <b>and</b> each element in a group has exactly one inverse element. Thus, it is customary to speak of the identity, and the inverse of an element.|$|E
5|$|All the {{candidates}} in a GRC must either {{be members of}} the same political party or independent candidates standing as <b>a</b> <b>group,</b> <b>and</b> at least one of {{the candidates}} must be a person belonging to the Malay, Indian or some other minority community. A person is regarded as belonging to the Malay community if, regardless of whether or not he or she is of the Malay race, considers himself or herself to be a member of the community and is generally accepted as such by the community. Similarly, a person will belong to the Indian community or some other minority community if he or she considers himself or herself a member and the community accepts him or her as such. The minority status of candidates is determined by two committees appointed by the President, the Malay Community Committee and the Indian and Other Minority Communities Committee. Decisions of these committees are final and conclusive, and may not be appealed against or called into question in any court.|$|E
5|$|Squadron Leader Harris of 149 Squadron and Wing Commander Kellett {{were the}} only {{experienced}} combat leaders. However, Kellett had not flown with No. 9 or 37 Squadrons as <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>and</b> {{had never had a}} chance to practice formation flying or bombing with these squadrons. He had not been given the time or opportunity to discuss or formulate a plan for bombing naval targets, whether as a group, squadron, or even as flight sections. Nor had he even been able to discuss or pass on any tactical advice about what the formation should do in the event of fighter attack. He was given command of an incoherent group of squadrons which were highly inexperienced. For the 18 December mission, 24 Wellington Bombers from No. 9, 37 and 149 Squadrons were given to Kellet. The British bombers flew in a diamond shape formation.|$|E

25|$|From the 2012–13 season, {{this format}} was {{adjusted}} slightly. The Super League and Plate League names were abandoned, but the two-tier system remained. The top tier expanded from fifteen teams to eighteen teams, in two sub-groups of nine (known as <b>Group</b> <b>A</b> <b>and</b> <b>Group</b> B, <b>and</b> considered equal in status); {{and the second}} tier was reduced to nine teams in <b>a</b> single <b>group</b> (known as Group C). The top three teams from <b>Groups</b> <b>A</b> <b>and</b> B and the top two from Group C contest the knockout phase. The lowest placed team in each of <b>Group</b> <b>A</b> <b>and</b> <b>Group</b> B is relegated to <b>Group</b> C, <b>and</b> the top two from Group C are promoted to the top tier.|$|R
5|$|This {{exception}} arises due to competing {{horizontal and}} vertical trends in the nuclear charge. Going along a period, the nuclear charge increases with atomic number as do the number of electrons. The additional pull on outer electrons as nuclear charge increases generally outweighs the screening effect of having more electrons. With some irregularities, atoms therefore become smaller, ionization energy increases, {{and there is a}} gradual change in character, across a period, from strongly metallic, to weakly metallic, to weakly nonmetallic, to strongly nonmetallic elements. Going down a main group, the effect of increasing nuclear charge is generally outweighed by the effect of additional electrons being further away from the nucleus. Atoms generally become larger, ionization energy falls, and metallic character increases. The net effect is that the location of the metal–nonmetal transition zone shifts to the right in going down <b>a</b> <b>group,</b> <b>and</b> analogous diagonal similarities are seen elsewhere in the periodic table, as noted.|$|E
