5|$|Nothing {{is known}} of Tytila's life or his rule, as no written records have survived from this period in East Anglian history.

25|$|The authors did try {{to verify}} Maha Yazawin's dates which {{did not agree with}} those given in Zatadawbon Yazawin.

25|$|Janssen, in his {{original}} BIFAO 84 paper, noted the curious {{fact that no}} known New Kingdom pharaohs who reigned {{for a quarter of}} a century including Ramesses II and Ramesses III had their <b>accession</b> <b>date</b> in this time frame and suggests the Year change was an error committed on behalf of the scribe. He then attributed the ostraca to Ramesses III, whose <b>accession</b> <b>date</b> was I Shemu day 26 and expressed his view that the scribe may have inadvertently implemented the Year change two weeks early instead. Janssen also observed that the palaeography of the ostraca suggests a date in the 20th Dynasty partly because it followed the later New Kingdom form of writing and due to its provenance in the Grand Putit region, which features numerous Dynasty 20 ostracas. However, this form of writing is also attested in monuments of Ramesses II and it would, therefore, not be unexpected to find it in a document from the very late 18th Dynasty since the transition from the Early New Kingdom to the Late New Kingdom Form of writing had already occurred prior to the end of Horemheb's reign, as Frank Yurco once noted. Indeed, Janssen's palaeographical reference for his paperProf. Georges Posenerhimself suggested a date in the 19th Dynasty due to the form of the wsf (absent) and akhet (inundation) text. As Janssen himself writes, a few 19th Dynasty ostracas have been found in the Grand Putit area prior to the 20th Dynasty's intensive exploitation of this region. This does not exclude some late 18th Dynasty work here either. Secondly, both Janssen and Krauss stress in their papers that the relative scarcity of the hieratic text in Ostraca IFAO 1254 precludes a clear dating of the document to Ramesses III's reign and that palaeography, in general, does not give a precise date for a document's creation. Hence, a dating of the ostraca to Horemheb's reign on the basis of the Year change is eminently plausible. On other matters, a damaged wall fragment painting from the Petrie Collection reportedly mentions Horemheb's 15th or 25th Year.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{nineteen}} Kaan kings {{are listed}} on the Dynastic Vases, some {{with the names of}} known historical rulers, clear discrepancies in their <b>accession</b> <b>dates</b> make it uncertain whether the nineteen names are to be considered historical or legendary.

That kingdom’s location in Yuknoom Ch'een’s time — roughly the years around AD 500 — is not certain; although Calakmul is known to have been the capital in the Late Classic, there is a reason to doubt that this was the case earlier. Dzibanche emerges as a strong possibility for the previous center because Yuknoom Ch’een is repeatedly named there on a sculptured [...] "captive stairway". Although this monument’s interpretation hinges on a single problematic glyph, it is likely that Yuknoom Ch’een was a ruler of Dzibanche and the captives were his trophies.|$|R
25|$|Hatshepsut died {{as she was}} {{approaching}} what we would consider middle age given typical contemporary lifespans, in her twenty-second regnal year. The precise date of Hatshepsut's death—and the time when Thutmose III became the next pharaoh of Egypt—is considered to be Year 22, II Peret day 10 of her reign, as recorded on a single stela erected at Armant or January 16, 1458 BC. This information validates the basic reliability of Manetho's kinglist records since Hatshepsut's known <b>accession</b> <b>date</b> was I Shemu day 4 (i.e.: Hatshepsut died nine months into her 22nd year as king, as Manetho writes in his Epitome for a reign of 21 years and nine months). No contemporary mention of the cause of her death has survived.

500|$|The table below lists Ottoman sultans, {{as well as}} {{the last}} Ottoman caliph, in chronological order. The tughras were the calligraphic seals or {{signatures}} used by Ottoman sultans. They were displayed on all official documents as well as on coins, and were far more important in identifying a sultan than his portrait. The [...] "Notes" [...] column contains information on each sultan's parentage and fate. For earlier rulers, there is usually a time gap between the moment a sultan's reign ended and the moment his successor was enthroned. This is because the Ottomans in that era practiced what historian Quataert has described as [...] "survival of the fittest, not eldest, son": when a sultan died, his sons had to fight each other for the throne until a victor emerged. Because of the infighting and numerous fratricides that occurred, a sultan's death date therefore did not always coincide with the <b>accession</b> <b>date</b> of his successor. In 1617, the law of succession changed from survival of the fittest to a system based on agnatic seniority ( [...] ekberiyet), whereby the throne went to the oldest male of the family. This in turn explains why from the 17th century onwards a deceased sultan was rarely succeeded by his own son, but usually by an uncle or brother. Agnatic seniority was retained until the abolition of the sultanate, despite unsuccessful attempts in the 19th century to replace it with primogeniture.|$|E
50|$|According to the twelfth-century Historia regum Anglorum, Alexander I, King of Scotland (died 1124) {{struggled}} {{to maintain control}} of his kingdom. One region which may have caused the Scots some concern was the Isles. In 1111, Domnall mac Taidc seized the kingship of the region, possibly {{with the aid of}} Muirchertach's northern opponent, Domnall Mac Lochlainn. This encroachment of competing Irish factions into the Isles may well have been as unpalatable to the English and Scots as the power vacuum left in the wake of Magnús' demise. The chronicle accords Óláfr a reign spanning forty years. His accession to the kingship of the Isles, therefore, appears to date to about 1112, 1113, 1114, or 1115. As such, Óláfr's <b>accession</b> <b>dates</b> to about the time of Muirchertach's faltering authority in 1114.

2500|$|The Egyptologist Rolf Krauss, in a DE 30(1994) paper, {{argued that}} this date may well reflect Horemheb's {{accession}} where a feast or public holiday was traditionally proclaimed to honour the <b>accession</b> <b>date</b> of a deceased or a current king. Krauss supports his hypothesis with evidence from Ostraca IFAO 1254 which was initially published by Jac Janssen in a BIFAO 84(1984) paper under the title [...] "A Curious Error." [...] The ostraca records {{the number of days}} on which an unknown Deir el-Medinah workman was absent from work and covers the period from Year 26 III Peret day 11 to Year 27 II Akhet day 12 before breaking off. The significant fact here is that a Year change occurred in the ostraca from Year 26 to Year 27 around the interval IV Peret day 28 and I Shemu day 13. The Year 27 date of Horemheb is located within this interval and would reflect Horemheb's <b>accession</b> <b>date,</b> Krauss suggests. Ay's <b>accession</b> <b>date</b> occurred somewhere in the month of III Peret. Since Manetho gives Ay a reign of 4 years and 1 month, this ruler would have died sometime around the month of IV Peret or the first half of I Shemu at the very latest. This is precisely the time period noted in Ostraca IFAO 1254. The fact that the ostraca records the case of only one worker rather than an entire group of workmen means the necropolis scribe cannot be presumed [...] at first glance [...] to have committed a dating error in altering the unknown king's Year date in the interval between IV Peret 28 and I Shemu 13.|$|E

2500|$|John Audelay was a noted 15th-century {{writer who}} resided at Haughmond. Audelay, a blind and deaf poet, {{was not an}} Augustinian canon but the first secular priest {{to serve in the}} Lestrange chantry. His <b>accession</b> <b>date,</b> 1426, is noted in a {{colophon}} of a manuscript of his work and he signs off several poems with a self-description: “My name is Jon the blynd Awdlay.” It is known that Audelay had some involvement in disturbances at the church of St Dunstan-in-the-East in London at Easter 1417, in which his employer, Richard le Strange, 7th Baron Strange (1381–1449), and his entourage assaulted Sir John Trussell, on the second occasion killing a by-stander. Formerly regarded as little more than samples of the contemporary Shropshire Middle English dialect, Audelay's poems give considerable insight into the spiritual concerns of the age. Most reflect on the value of points of Christian doctrine or liturgy. His defence of the mass, for example, is clearly shaped by his own daily concerns as a chaplain. Pursuing his exposition, he brings in an example from the life of Augustine of Canterbury. The themes, which are strongly anti-Lollard, and the strategies of argument and exposition, are reminiscent of the work of his older contemporary, John Mirk, a canon of nearby Lilleshall. Like Mirk, Audelay seems very aware of the distinction between internal criticism, however tenchant, and heretical dissent. He drew a clear distinction between the work of conscientious priests and the conduct of worldly clerics. His strong emphasis on respect for the divine service may reflect his own sense of responsibility for the events of 1417. Occasionally he comments on topical concerns, as in a poem on Henry V's wooing of [...] Catherine of Valois or another on the succession of Henry VI.|$|E
2500|$|The {{conventional}} {{dates for}} his reign as established by Kenneth Kitchen are 945924 BC but his time-line {{has recently been}} revised downwards by {{a few years to}} 943922 BC, since he may well have lived for up to two to three years after his successful campaign in Canaan, conventionally dated to 925 BC. As Edward Wente of the University of Chicago noted on page 276 of his JNES 35(1976) Book Review of Kitchen's study of the Third Intermediate Period, there is [...] "no certainty" [...] that Shoshenq's 925 BC campaign terminated just prior to this king's death a year later in 924 BC. The English Egyptologist, Morris Bierbrier also dated Shoshenq I's accession [...] "between 945–940 BC" [...] in his seminal 1975 book concerning the genealogies of Egyptian officials who served during the late New Kingdom and Third Intermediate Period. Bierbrier based his opinion on Biblical evidence collated by W. Albright in a BASOR 130 paper. This development would also account for the mostly unfinished state of decorations of Shoshenq's building projects at the Great Temple of Karnak where only scenes of the king's Palestinian military campaign are fully carved. Building materials would first have had to be extracted and architectural planning performed for his great monumental projects here. Such activities usually took up to a year to complete before work was even begun. This would imply that Shoshenq I likely lived for a period in excess of one year after his 925 BC campaign. On the other hand, if the Karnak inscription was concurrent with Shoshenq's campaign into Canaan, {{the fact that it was}} left unfinished would suggest this campaign occurred in the last year of Shoshenq's reign. This possibility would also permit his 945 BC <b>accession</b> <b>date</b> to be slightly lowered to 943 BC.|$|E

The vast majority were found at the Yinxu site (in modern Anyang, Henan Province).
