40|$|We {{explored}} {{the functions of}} team monitoring <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> room (undirected <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> relay relevant information or comment {{on the performance of}} real-time self behavior) for effects on team interaction and performance in 27 anesthesia teams in the clinical setting. Immediate reactions <b>to</b> team monitoring <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> room were investigated by means of lag sequential analysis. As expected, we found that in high performing teams, immediate consequences of team monitoring were speaking-up and providing unsolicited assistance. <b>Talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> room led <b>to</b> further <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> room <b>and</b> substituted explicit coordination. The results highlight the relevance of team monitoring <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> room for team coordination and performance in dynamic healthcare environments...|$|R

25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the controversial visit of Oskar R. Lange to the Soviet Union, the Polish American Congress was established in the USA in May 1944; among the organization's goals was the promotion of interests of independent Poland before the US Government. Mikołajczyk visited the USA in June and on several occasions met with President Roosevelt, who urged him to travel to Moscow <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Soviet leaders directly. Mikołajczyk, subsequently engaged in negotiations with Stalin and the emerging Polish communist government (PKWN), eventually resigned his post and Tomasz Arciszewski became the new prime minister in exile in November 1944. Mikołajczyk's disagreements with his coalition partners (he was unable to convince the ministers that restoration of the prewar eastern border of Poland was no longer feasible and further compromises were necessary) and his departure created a vacuum, because the British and the Americans were practically unwilling to deal with the Polish government that followed.|$|E

The {{battalion}} made it to the square at the end of the streets and lined up facing the sources of fire. One tank commander Captain Menashe Goldblatt, who had been hit in the shoulder and lost his consciousness, recovered and was asked by Zaken to go from tank to tank <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crews. He found that many of the commanders were either dead or wounded, and that many of the men were in shock. He appointed gunners and loaders as tank commanders, assigned them fire sectors and told them to switch their radio frequency from the company frequency to the battalion frequency so that they could speak directly to Zaken. One tank commander was not wounded but refused to take his head out of the turret and Goldblatt warned him that he would personally fire a shell at him if he didn't start functioning.|$|E

The diplomats insisted they must be able to offer safe passage out of the UK for the gunmen, believing this to {{be the only way to}} guarantee a peaceful outcome, but the British government was adamant that safe passage would not be considered under any circumstances. Karkhouti, through whom Oan had issued his revised demands the previous day, became increasingly ill throughout the day and by the evening was feverish, which led to suggestions that the police had spiked the food that had been sent into the embassy.

40|$|This paper {{builds on}} and extends theory on team {{functioning}} in high-risk environments. We examined 2 implicit coordination behaviors {{that tend to}} emerge autochthonously within high-risk teams: team member monitoring <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> room. Focusing on nonrandom patterns of behavior, we examined sequential patterns of team member monitoring <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> room in higher- and lower-performing action teams working in a high-risk health care environment. Using behavior observation methods, we coded verbal and nonverbal behaviors of 27 anesthesia teams performing an induction of general anesthesia in a natural setting and assessed team performance with a Delphi-validated checklist-based performance measure. Lag sequential analyses revealed that higher-performing teams were characterized by patterns in which team member monitoring was followed by speaking up, providing assistance, and giving instructions and by patterns in which <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> room was followed by further <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> room <b>and</b> not followed by instructions. Higher- and lower-performing teams did not differ with respect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> frequency of team member monitoring <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> room occurrence. The results illustrate the importance of patterns of autochthonous coordination behaviors and demonstrate that the interaction patterns, as opposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> behavior frequencies, discriminated higher- from lower-performing teams. Implications for future research and for team training are included...|$|R
