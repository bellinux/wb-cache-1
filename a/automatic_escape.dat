40|$|Outside Piagetian theory, sensory-motor co-ordinations {{are often}} {{relegated to the}} domain of `mere ' motor skill, but their {{development}} shares important features with that of cognitive structures. This paper focusses on early action, to assess the prospects for an account ofdevelopment {{that is based on}} a system's initial mechanisms and processes of interaction with its environment without prespecication of stable patterns of organization that will be acquired. A truly epigenetic account proves elusive, with empirical ndings increasingly being taken to indicate preadaptation and strong domain-speci c constraints on infant abilities. Despite this, evidence can be marshalled for variability, which is compatible with a general-purpose process of internally motivated and structured organizational change. However, the mechanisms underlying this process are obscure. Clari cation is sought by considering current attempts to understand sensorymotor co-ordination through the construction of arti cial agent{environment systems. Disappointingly, such approaches often share a need to incorporate an explicit bias towards the recurrent behaviour patterns that will come to have functional signi cance for the systems they aim to explain. Synchronic systems in this vein exploit predesigned sensory-motor connections with the environment. Their diachronic counterparts feature designer speci cation of acceptable outcomes for activity in the form of problem-speci c tness functions or goal-like value schemes that are credited to evolution. Neither computational nor dynamical systems concepts provide an <b>automatic</b> <b>escape</b> from this problem, but most promising may be robotics approaches informed by dynamical systems theory that challenge mainstream views of information and information-processing.

40|$|With {{the steady}} {{progress}} of high performance electronic systems, {{the complexity of}} the electronic systems grows continuously and new features like high-speed, low power and low cost, become the key issues. The interconnection in the electronic systems distributes the power, clock and transfers the electrical signals among numerous components. As the feature size of microelectronic technology becomes smaller, the design and analysis of the interconnection are more important for the performance and cost of the system. The escape routing design is a new important problem in the interconnection design because the number of chip/package input/output (I/O) pins has continuously been growing for high-speed high-performance system. The traditional escape routing strategy and several improvements, pins/pads special placement and routing resource exploration, could not handle large number of I/Os efficiently and usually require increased cost. We introduce a novel concept, escape sequence, develop efficient escape routing strategies based on the new concept and model the escaping wires using 3 D extraction. For square grid array, we formulate and solve a maximum flow problem to analyze the escape bottleneck in area array. The layer count can be decreased dramatically by optimizing the I/O escape sequence. Two new escape routing strategies, central triangular escape routing and two-sided escape routing, are proposed and the number of escape routing layers could be reduced dramatically. We implement an <b>automatic</b> <b>escape</b> routing program to verify our analysis and to compare different escape sequence strategies. The escaping wires could be modeled as frequency dependent RLGC circuit for signal performance analysis. For hexagonal area array, we analyze its preponderant properties that the hexagonal array could increase the density of I/Os in the array remarkably. We propose three escape routing strategies for the hexagonal array: column-by-column horizontal escape routing, two- sided horizontal/vertical escape routing, and multi- direction hybrid channel escape routing. We can escape I/ Os in the hexagonal array in the same or less number of routing layers compared with square grid array. Therefore, we could reduce the number of escape routing layers as well as increase the density of I/Os. The eye diagram prediction is an important problem in the interconnection analysis because an eye diagram provides the most fundamental and intuitive view to evaluate the signal quality of high-speed communication. The traditional method to obtain the eye diagram involves performing a time domain simulation. It requires a very long simulation time and usually could not accurately characterize the communication systems because the limited length pseudorandom bit sequence (PRBS) as the input stimulus. Several eye diagram prediction methods, analytical techniques, analysis based on unit pulse response and analysis based on step response, have their application constraints because of their assumptions and usually could not handle general systems. We introduce an efficient and accurate method, the accumulative prediction method, to predict the eye diagram for high-speed signaling systems. We use the step response of the signaling system to extract the worst-case eye diagram, including the eye opening and timing jitter. Furthermore, this method generates the input data patterns which produce the worst- case inter-symbol interference. The main advantage is that this general-purpose method can handle signals with asymmetric as well as symmetric rise/fall time. Furthermore, {{the complexity of the}} proposed method is linear O(n), where n is the number of time points of step response. This method can be applied to analyze the signal performance in escape routing. It is very useful to analyze various high speed signaling system...|$|E

40|$|My {{thesis is}} that {{languages}} and frameworks {{can and should}} be designed {{to make it easier for}} programmers to write reviewably secure systems. A system is reviewably secure if its security is easy for an experienced programmer to verify, given access to the source code. A security reviewer should be able, with a reasonable amount of effort, to gain confidence that such a system meets its stated security goals. This dissertation includes work on on language subsetting and web application framework design. It presents Joe-E, a subset of the Java programming language designed to enforce object-capability security, simplifying the task of verifying a variety of security properties by enabling sound, local reasoning. Joe-E also enforces determinism-by-default, which permits functionally-pure methods to be identified by their signature. Functional purity is a useful property that can greatly simplify the task of correctly implementing and reasoning about application code. A number of applications of the Joe-E language are presented and evaluated. The second part of this dissertation presents tool and framework enhancements for improving the security of web applications. I present techniques for retrofitting existing web applications to use templatesystems effectively to prevent cross-site scripting and content injectionvulnerabilities while preserving functionality. I also show how HTML templates can be rewritten to normalize their output, improving the assurance of security provided by <b>automatic</b> <b>escaping</b> and other static analyses. These two applications of my thesis demonstrate that practical enhancements to languages and frameworks can support developers in creating more secure software that is easier to review. Continued improvement in language and framework support for reviewability is a promising approach toward improving the security provided by modern software...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the many}} {{solutions}} proposed by {{industry and the}} research community to address phishing attacks, this problem continues to cause enormous damage. Because of our inability to deter phishing attacks, the research community needs to develop new approaches to anti-phishing solutions. Most of today’s anti-phishing technologies focus on automatically detecting and preventing phishing attacks. While automation makes anti-phishing tools user-friendly, automation also makes them suffer from false positives, false negatives, and various practical hurdles. As a result, attackers often find simple ways to <b>escape</b> <b>automatic</b> detection. This paper presents iTrustPage – an anti-phishing tool that does not rely completely on automation to detect phishing. Instead, iTrustPage relies on user input and external repositories of information to prevent users from filling out phishing Web forms. With iTrustPage, users help {{to decide whether or}} not a Web page is legitimate. Because iTrustPage is user-assisted, iTrustPage avoids the false positives and the false negatives associated with automatic phishing detection. We implemented iTrustPage as a downloadable extension to FireFox. After being featured on the Mozilla website for FireFox extensions, iTrustPage was downloaded by more than 5, 000 users in a two week period. We present an analysis of our tool’s effectiveness and ease of use based on our examination of usage logs collected from the 2, 050 users who used iTrustPage for more than two weeks. Based on these logs, we find that iTrustPage disrupts users on fewer than 2 % of the pages they visit, and the number of disruptions decreases over time...|$|R
