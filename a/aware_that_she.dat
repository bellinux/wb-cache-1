5|$|Eventually, Jack and Angelica admit {{their love}} for each other, yet he distrusts her {{intentions}} (<b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> may try to avenge her father) and strands her on a cay. Now wielding Blackbeard's magical sword, Barbossa captains the Queen Anne's Revenge and returns to piracy. Jack finds Gibbs, who had used the compass to locate the Revenge. He reclaims the shrunken Black Pearl and the other conquered ships in bottles, carrying them in a gunny sack. The two leave, hoping to revert the Black Pearl to its original size and continue living the pirates life.|$|E
5|$|The {{family was}} arrested and imprisoned, first in their home at Tsarskoye Selo and later at residences in Tobolsk and Yekaterinburg in Siberia. Maria {{attempted}} to befriend her guards both at Tsarskoye Selo and Tobolsk and soon learned their names and details about their wives and children. Unaware of her danger, she commented at Tobolsk {{that she would be}} happy to live there indefinitely if only she could take a walk outside without being guarded continuously. Still, she was <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was being watched constantly. Maria and her sister Anastasia burned their letters and diaries in April 1918 because they feared their possessions would be searched.|$|E
25|$|Joan {{sent her}} four young {{children}} to their grandfather, in hopes that their sweetness would win Edward's favor, but her plan did not work. The king soon discovered his daughter's intentions, but not yet <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had already committed to them, he seized Joan’s lands and continued to arrange her marriage to Amadeus of Savoy.|$|E
60|$|Barbara flushed ever so slightly, but her {{companion}} noticed it. <b>She</b> was quite <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> if <b>she</b> was {{made much of}} in that city it was, in part, at least, {{due to the fact}} <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was the niece of a well-known man, and had considerable possessions.|$|R
6000|$|This was so {{different}} from anything Maisie had expected that {{it took some time}} to reach her mind. <b>She</b> was <b>aware</b> meanwhile <b>that</b> <b>she</b> probably looked rather wan. [...] "To marry Sir Claude?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Pseudo-lucid dreams: {{the dreamer}} becomes <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> he or <b>she</b> is dreaming, without quite realizing that dreaming means {{lying in bed}} asleep.|$|R
25|$|A {{resident}} of Alexandria, Virginia, for approximately 30 years until her death, Barrett was <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{lived in the}} house where Richard Bland Lee had drafted the document establishing the District of Columbia. It had been owned by Elisha C. Dick, one of the physicians attending George Washington on his deathbed as well as a noted abolitionist and early mayor of Alexandria.|$|E
25|$|Boris Kolenkhov: A Russian {{who escaped}} to America {{shortly before the}} Russian Revolution. He is very {{concerned}} with world politics, and the deterioration of Russia. He is the ballet instructor of Essie, <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is untalented at dancing, but knows that she enjoys dancing so he keeps working with her. He likes the Greeks and the Romans, questions society, and is interested in world affairs.|$|E
25|$|Hannah Montana is Miley Stewart's alter ego. The {{character}} was originally {{going to be}} named Alexis Texas, but the name was changed to Hannah Montana. Hannah exists as a secret identity, an extremely popular and influential worldwide popstar. Hannah's many fans are not <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is really just a normal teenage girl, and Miley tries to keep her two lives separate from each other.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Kenton {{sank back}} in her corner, <b>aware</b> now <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{would not have had}} the {{strength}} to go to her husband even to save him from the awful disgrace of giving himself away to Breckon. [...] "And was <b>that</b> all?" [...] <b>she</b> faltered.|$|R
6000|$|... - The yachts ride mute {{at anchor}} and the fulling moon is fair, And the giddy folk are {{strutting}} {{up and down}} the smooth parade, And in her wild distraction she seems not to be <b>aware</b> [...] <b>That</b> <b>she</b> lives no more a maid, ...|$|R
5000|$|Mulholland {{was the one}} {{who gave}} Michael and Rita Schwerner an [...] "orientation" [...] on {{what you need to know}} about being a white activist in the state of Mississippi. The next day, Michael was killed, along with James Chaney and Andrew Goodman. Mulholland {{explained}} <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> nothing <b>she</b> could have added in the information she gave Schwerner would have prevented what had happened.|$|R
25|$|Walker and Pilgrim {{investigate}} {{the death of}} a seemingly normal person who is later revealed {{to be a member of}} an alien organization called the Millennium Guard. Pilgrim becomes <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is being investigated by Internal Affairs for her recent actions, and Walker is contacted by the Millennium Guard to take the place of the earlier victim. When he accepts, he is given new powers. Walker also begins a romantic relationship with a witness to the murder.|$|E
25|$|The {{only certain}} {{way to prevent}} FAS is to avoid {{drinking}} alcohol during pregnancy. In the United States, the Surgeon General recommended in 1981, and again in 2005, that women abstain from alcohol use while pregnant or while planning a pregnancy, the latter to avoid damage even in the earliest stages (even weeks) of a pregnancy, as the woman may not be <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> has conceived. In the United States, federal legislation has required that warning labels be placed on all alcoholic beverage containers since 1988 under the Alcoholic Beverage Labeling Act.|$|E
25|$|Wynand {{offers to}} marry Francon, {{even though he}} is <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is not in love with him. Francon defers the offer until she feels a great need to punish herself. She learns Roark's true {{identity}} when they are introduced at the party opening the Enright House, the new building that Roark has designed which The Banner has campaigned against. Francon goes to Roark's apartment and offers to marry him if he gives up architecture to save himself from a hopeless struggle. Roark rejects her fears and says that they face many years apart until she adjusts her thinking.|$|E
50|$|Now fully <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> {{everything}} <b>she</b> was lead {{to believe}} {{was a lie}} and <b>that</b> <b>she</b> wasn't at fault, her own spirit is freed in a sense. She flees from the lighthouse, relieved of years in doubt. With the newfound resolution, she tells her agent over the phone <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is returning home. Waiting for her in her room is Jeremy's last words to her from beyond. Telling Morgan to be free and happy.|$|R
6000|$|She did not protest {{this as a}} coquette {{might have}} done. On the contrary, she {{remained}} silent, and I was <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> while <b>she</b> liked and respected me, she was not profoundly moved by this farewell call. Nevertheless I hoped, and in that hope I repeated, [...] "You will write to me, won't you?" ...|$|R
25|$|Deepening phase: {{the victim}} moves toward resolution, {{becoming}} <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> he or <b>she</b> is not alone, has {{him or herself}} been the recipient of others’ forgiveness, and finds meaning and purpose in the forgiveness process.|$|R
25|$|The bird the {{children}} have found has died, and {{the children}}, assisted by the adults, hold a funeral for it. Virginia is <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{and the little girl}} are far more invested in the funeral than Vanessa's boys, who are probably laughing at the females behind their backs. As Virginia stares longingly at the dead bird she has an epiphany: her character, Clarissa Dalloway, is not like Virginia, and would not commit suicide. Like the bird's funeral bed, Clarissa represents -to Virginia- an uncaring, even foolish thing. As such, Clarissa will represent the death bed (the counterpoint) to the character who Virginia will have commit suicide.|$|E
25|$|While Mary {{manages the}} children, other {{problems}} lie with their parents. Winifred is <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is somehow disappointing both {{her children and}} her husband ("Being Mrs Banks"). George, on the other hand, can't understand why she finds the role of wife and mother so difficult ("Cherry Tree Lane (reprise)"). In an effort to please her husband, Winifred sends out invitations for a smart tea party. Mrs. Brill makes the preparations, while telling an eager Robertson Ay to keep his hands off. The children inadvertently sabotage the kitchen preparations, but Mary sorts {{it out with a}} lesson ("A Spoonful of Sugar"). However, it is then revealed that none of the invitees are coming.|$|E
25|$|DuBois {{refers to}} herself as a medium and profiler, rather than a psychic, because of the {{negative}} connotation she feels {{is associated with the}} term psychic. She claims that she became <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had the ability to communicate with departed souls when she was 6 years old. DuBois claims she uses this ability to connect deceased loved ones to the living, and also to help law enforcement agencies solve crimes, such as the Texas Rangers and the Glendale, Arizona police department, and that she used these abilities as a jury consultant. These law enforcement agencies have since either denied any such cooperation happened or stated the tips provided by DuBois were not helpful.|$|E
5000|$|The {{three main}} areas of McCreery’s work with Celia Green {{have been the}} types of hallucinatory {{experience}} known as lucid dreams (dreams in which the subject is <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> he or <b>she</b> is dreaming), out-of-body experiences, and apparitional experience.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was always}} so. She never cared. I was {{perfectly}} <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> if <b>she</b> could have assured life hereafter to me, {{she would have}} given her life here to do it. You know how some women, when they are married, absolutely give themselves up, try to lose themselves in the behoof of their husbands? I don't say it rightly; there are no words that will express the utterness of their abdication." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{jerked his}} {{handsome}} head in literal protest at a doubt. [...] "Why that's exactly what I mean by my gratitude {{for all your}} trouble. It has been just as if you took a particular interest." [...] She only looked at him by way of answer in such sudden headlong embarrassment, as <b>she</b> was quite <b>aware,</b> <b>that</b> while <b>she</b> remained silent he showed himself checked by her expression. [...] "You have--haven't you?--taken a particular interest?" ...|$|R
25|$|Through {{the autopsy}} and old photos, he becomes <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had been {{systematically}} putting Nic's {{shoes on the}} wrong feet, resulting in pain and deformity. She attacks him, accuses him of planning to leave her, mounts him, and then smashes a large block of wood onto his testicles, causing him to lose consciousness. The woman then performs a sex act on the unconscious man, culminating in an ejaculation of blood. She drills a hole through his leg, bolting a heavy grindstone through the wound, and then tossing the wrench she used under the cabin. He awakens alone; unable to loosen the bolt, he hides by dragging himself into the deep, dark foxhole {{at the base of}} the dead tree. Following the sound of a crow he has found buried alive in the hole, she locates him and attacks and mostly buries him with a shovel.|$|E
25|$|Ram Dass befriends Sara {{when his}} pet monkey escapes into Sara's {{adjoining}} attic. After climbing {{over the roof}} to Sara's room to get the monkey, Ram Dass tells Carrisford about Sara's poor living conditions. As a pleasant distraction, Carrisford and Ram Dass buy warm blankets, comfortable furniture, food, and other gifts, and secretly leave them in Sara's room when she is asleep or out. Sara's spirits and health improve due to the gifts she receives from her mysterious benefactor, whose identity she does not know; nor are Ram Dass and Carrisford <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is Crewe's lost daughter. When Carrisford anonymously sends Sara a package of new, well-made and expensive clothing in her proper size, Miss Minchin becomes alarmed, thinking Sara might have a wealthy relative secretly looking out for her, and begins to treat Sara better and allows her to attend classes rather than doing menial work.|$|E
25|$|Anticipating {{word from}} Antía, and <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> owes her {{daughter}} {{an explanation of}} the events that led to their separation, Julieta fills a journal with an account of her life as mother, spouse, and daughter. She begins with the story of meeting Xoan, a fisherman and Antía's father. In a flashback, Julieta recounts meeting Xoan on a train, having fled to the restaurant carriage from an older man. He tells her about his life as a fisherman, and his wife who is in a coma. The train stops sharply, having hit the older man, who committed suicide. As Julieta blames herself for his death, Xoan comforts her, and they have sex on the train. Later, at the school at which she works, Julieta receives a letter from Xoan which she takes as an invitation to visit. She learns his wife has recently died and that he is with Ava, a friend. Julieta and Xoan resume their relationship, and she informs him that she is pregnant with his child. Two years later, Julieta and Antía visit Julieta's parents. Her mother is ill and apparently suffering from Alzheimer's disease, at first not recognising her daughter. Her father is having an affair with the maid, to Julieta's chagrin.|$|E
60|$|The present unhappy {{state of}} the family {{rendered}} any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be fairly conjectured from that, though Elizabeth, who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly <b>aware</b> <b>that,</b> had <b>she</b> known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of Lydia's infamy somewhat better. It would have spared her, she thought, one sleepless night out of two.|$|R
50|$|In Eastern thought, {{cultivating}} the dreamer's {{ability to}} be <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> he or <b>she</b> is dreaming is central to both the Tibetan Buddhist practice of dream Yoga, and the ancient Indian Hindu practice of Yoga nidra. The cultivation of such awareness was common practice among early Buddhists.|$|R
50|$|Minatsu and Ken {{met in the}} summer. Due to how she was, {{he looked}} {{up to her and}} to be like her, but <b>she</b> told him <b>that</b> he should not aim to be like her but to aim for the impossible. Their meeting taught him not to be lazy and work if he desires something. Like the season she represents, she is fired up and is always ready to take action, {{especially}} when {{it has something to do}} with anime or manga. Both Minatsu and Mafuyu never got to know their father, and Minatsu was unwilling to meet her mothers' boyfriend saying it had nothing to do with them, creating a rift between Minatsu and her mother, but their mother always took care of them no matter how tired she was. In the anime and novel, her feelings for Ken grow so much <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>she's</b> in love with Ken. She is seen kissing him in volume 8 of the light novel and episode 4 of the second season of the anime.|$|R
500|$|Jim and Michael take Dwight to the {{hospital}} where Michael insists that his burned foot is a more serious injury than Dwight's blunt force trauma. Before they go, Pam bids [...] "goodbye" [...] to the concussed Dwight, <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> will probably never see the good-natured version of Dwight Schrute ever again.|$|E
500|$|Balzac's mother, born Anne-Charlotte-Laure Sallambier, {{came from}} a family of haberdashers in Paris. Her family's wealth was a {{considerable}} factor in the match: she was eighteen {{at the time of the}} wedding, and François Balzac fifty. As the author and literary critic Sir Victor Pritchett explained, [...] "She was certainly drily <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had been given to an old husband as a reward for his professional services to a friend of her family and that the capital was on her side. She was not in love with her husband".|$|E
500|$|Napravnik's {{success has}} come in a sport where only 10% of all jockeys are women, {{even though they have}} been {{licensed}} as jockeys in pari-mutuel races since 1969. She initially was uncomfortable finding herself viewed as a role model for girls, preferring to simply be noticed as a top jockey. She became <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> could {{have a positive impact on}} others and that helped her be more comfortable with her prominence. [...] She still prefers to emphasize her riding prowess, and stated in 2014, [...] "If you show your work ethic and professionalism and obvious skill and ability, that is what is going to win somebody over." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr Brandon {{looked out}} of the window and saw the spring-wagon at the outside of the broad stile, with Plez {{standing}} at the sorrel's head. He remembered that the venerable demon had said, at the first, <b>that</b> <b>she</b> intended to stay but one night, and he could but believe <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was now really going. Knowing her as he did, however, he was very well <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> if <b>she</b> had said she would not leave until she had seen him, she would stay in his house for a year, unless he sooner went down to her; therefore he opened his door, and slowly and feebly descended the stairs.|$|R
6000|$|... "It wouldn't have {{happened}} {{at all if}} you had not asked him to stay till the Monday," [...] said Sir Harry; and to this charge Lady Elizabeth {{knew that there was}} no answer. There she had clearly disobeyed her husband; and though she doubtless suffered much from some dim idea of injustice, <b>she</b> was <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> as <b>she</b> had so offended she must submit to be told that all this evil had come from her wrong-doing.|$|R
5000|$|Mrs. McCluskey, still {{suspicious}} of Dave, joins with Katherine to discover more about him. Katherine can't find anything over the Internet {{about him as}} they have very little information about him. So they invite Edie for lunch to fish some details about Dave. Mrs. McCluskey very blatantly asks questions about Dave's past, but even Edie doesn't know herself. At Danielle's welcome home dinner, Katherine subtly steers the conversation back to Dave's past asking where he went to college. When Dave is reluctant to answer, Edie continues questioning him. Dave claims that he comes from [...] "the mid-west", {{a reference to the}} novel The Great Gatsby. Dave tells the others he didn't go to college and that his dad had drinking problems. Edie later apologizes when they reach home, and she blames her questioning him on Mrs. McCluskey's keen interest. <b>Aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>she's</b> trying to suss him out, Dave feeds the idea into Edie's head that Mrs. McCluskey may be starting to go senile.|$|R
