The chapter also focuses on plasma-enabled processing as a highly versatile tool for selective modification of a wide range of implantable materials, including temperature-sensitive polymeric materials and living tissues.

40|$|Abstract. Hydrogenated <b>amorphous</b> <b>carbons,</b> an {{important}} component of the interstellar carbonaceous dust, possess infrared spectral signa-tures (at 3. 4, 6. 9 and 7. 3 µm) that are ubiquitous in the diffuse in-terstellar medium of galaxies, but not observed in dense clouds. To better understand the role played by cosmic rays in the disappearance of these absorption bands, irradiation experiments of hydrocarbon dust analogues have been performed with different swift ions. The results obtained through the in situ infrared monitoring of the samples during the irradiations allow to infer the dehydrogenation effect of the cosmic ray distribution on the interstellar hydrogenated <b>amorphous</b> <b>carbons.</b> The importance of this interstellar dust destruction by cosmic rays is discussed in comparison to other energetic processes in different inter-stellar environments. ...|$|R
5|$|Trujillo {{and colleagues}} have placed upper limits in Sedna's surface {{composition}} of 60% for methane ice and 70% for water ice. The presence of methane further supports {{the existence of}} tholins on Sedna's surface, because they are produced by irradiation of methane. Barucci and colleagues compared Sedna's spectrum with that of Triton and detected weak absorption bands belonging to methane and nitrogen ices. From these observations, they suggested the following model of the surface: 24% Triton-type tholins, 7% <b>amorphous</b> <b>carbon,</b> 10% nitrogen, 26% methanol, and 33% methane. The detection of methane and water ices was confirmed in 2006 by the Spitzer Space Telescope mid-infrared photometry. The presence of nitrogen on the surface suggests the possibility that, {{at least for a}} short time, Sedna may have a tenuous atmosphere. During a 200-year period near perihelion, the maximum temperature on Sedna should exceed , the transition temperature between alpha-phase solid N2 and the beta phase seen on Triton. At 38 K, the N2 vapor pressure would be 14 microbar (1.4 Pa or 0.000014 atm). However, its deep red spectral slope is indicative of high concentrations of organic material on its surface, and its weak methane absorption bands indicate that methane on Sedna's surface is ancient, rather than freshly deposited. This means that Sedna is too cold for methane to evaporate from its surface and then fall back as snow, which happens on Triton and probably on Pluto.|$|E

The reaction of NO with graphite shows a higher reaction rate per unit surface area than the reaction with the three <b>amorphous</b> <b>carbons.</b> The differences in reactivity between graphite and the <b>amorphous</b> <b>carbons</b> point {{to the presence of}} two kinds of active sites attributed to defective carbon sites and the carbon sites at the basal planes, respectively.

500|$|The {{atoms of}} carbon can bond {{together}} in different ways, termed allotropes of carbon.

For example, graphite is opaque and black while diamond is highly transparent. Graphite is soft enough {{to form a}} streak on paper (hence its name, from the Greek verb [...] "γράφειν" [...] which means [...] "to write"), while diamond is the hardest naturally occurring material known. Graphite is a good electrical conductor while diamond has a low electrical conductivity. Under normal conditions, diamond, carbon nanotubes, and graphene have the highest thermal conductivities of all known materials. All carbon allotropes are solids under normal conditions, with graphite being the most thermodynamically stable form.
