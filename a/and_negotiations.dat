40|$|This paper {{explores the}} role that first {{impressions}} play in two different relational contexts: psychodynamic treatment <b>and</b> <b>negotiation.</b> Although the goals of therapy <b>and</b> <b>negotiation</b> are very different, both endeavors rest on {{the capacity of the}} participants to engage in a process of constructive dialogue, and “to get things done” via a relationship. We argue for the utility of an interdisciplinary conversation between psychoanalysis <b>and</b> <b>negotiation,</b> <b>and</b> specifically suggest that exploring these similarities and differences about first steps in building a working relationship may be instructive for practitioners in both professions...|$|R

5|$|By mid-2012 Iceland was {{regarded}} as one of Europe's recovery success stories. It has had two years of economic growth. Unemployment was down to 6.3% and Iceland was attracting immigrants to fill jobs. Currency devaluation effectively reduced wages by 50% making exports more competitive and imports more expensive. Ten-year government bonds were issued below 6%, lower than some of the PIIGS nations in the EU (Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Spain). Tryggvi Thor Herbertsson, a member of parliament, noted that adjustments via currency devaluations are less painful than government labor policies <b>and</b> <b>negotiations.</b> Nevertheless, while EU fervor has cooled the government continued to pursue membership.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, the Imperial War Museum {{sought to}} open a branch {{in the north of}} England. Seventy-one sites were offered for {{consideration}} by 36local councils. One such council was that of Hartlepool, in County Durham, for whom a new museum building was designed by architect Sir Norman Foster for a site on Hartlepool's dockside. In 1992 the Teesside Development Corporation offered the museum, on behalf of Hartlepool council, a total of £14.4 million towards construction and running costs. However, the National Audit Office later reported that the Corporation's offer breached government rules <b>and</b> <b>negotiations</b> were abandoned.|$|E

5|$|In 1623, Kepler at last {{completed}} the Rudolphine Tables, {{which at the}} time was considered his major work. However, due to the publishing requirements of the emperor <b>and</b> <b>negotiations</b> with Tycho Brahe's heir, it would not be printed until 1627. In the meantime, religious tension — the root of the ongoing Thirty Years' War — once again put Kepler and his family in jeopardy. In 1625, agents of the Catholic Counter-Reformation placed most of Kepler's library under seal, and in 1626 the city of Linz was besieged. Kepler moved to Ulm, where he arranged for the printing of the Tables at his own expense.|$|E

On March 11, a provisional settlement was brokered in Corfu by Dutch Colonel Thomson. Albania was prepared to accept a limited Northern Epirote government, but Karapanos insisted on complete autonomy, a condition rejected by the Albanian delegates, <b>and</b> <b>negotiations</b> reached a deadlock.

Both North and South Vietnamese were to maintain control in the areas under their influence <b>and</b> <b>negotiations</b> between the two nations, possibly leading to a coalition government and unification, were to take place.

40|$|This paper aims is an {{exploratory}} study that develops and preliminary tests a conceptual {{model for the}} explanation of the role and impact of cultural intelligence (CQ) on conflict management <b>and</b> <b>negotiation</b> styles in culturally diverse environments. Data were collected online from 164 employees mainly with a diverse cultural background. The present research makes two major contributions. First, we review different streams of literature to integrate the links between cultural diversity, conflict management, <b>negotiation</b> <b>and</b> CQ. Secondly, we build and test with exploratory data our theoretical model. Results show CQ affecting the different conflict management <b>and</b> <b>negotiation</b> strategies (or behaviours) as well as moderating the link between cultural orientations and the different conflict management <b>and</b> <b>negotiation</b> styles. Although of exploratory nature, our study is unique in exploring the interplaying dynamics among our variables, as most of current literature in conflict management <b>and</b> <b>negotiation</b> focuses on comparisons of different cultures, rather than investigating the cultural orientations and intelligence of individuals...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{development}} of complex engineering systems requires collaboration <b>and</b> <b>negotiation.</b> It {{is to make}} correct decisions based on customer needs, Functional Requirements, Design Parameters, and Process Variables. There are two basic elements: the system and the process used for collaboration <b>and</b> <b>negotiation.</b> The system is {{to assure that the}} project has the best information and knowledge. Systems and processes are needed to minimise the cost of development, to execute the project on schedule, and to deliver a highly robust, efficient and reliable product. This paper proposes heuristic rules for collaboration <b>and</b> <b>negotiation</b> based on axiomatic design theory and complexity theory...|$|R
5|$|After making salt at Dandi, Gandhi {{continued}} southward {{along the}} coast, producing salt and addressing meetings on the way. The Congress Party planned {{to stage a}} satyagraha at the Dharasana Salt Works, 25 miles south of Dandi. However, Gandhi was arrested on the midnight of 4–5 May 1930, {{just days before the}} planned action at Dharasana. The Dandi March and the ensuing Dharasana Satyagraha drew worldwide attention to the Indian independence movement through extensive newspaper and newsreel coverage. The satyagraha against the salt tax continued for almost a year, ending with Gandhi's release from jail <b>and</b> <b>negotiations</b> with Viceroy Lord Irwin at the Second Round Table Conference. Over 80,000 Indians were jailed {{as a result of the}} Salt Satyagraha. However, it failed to result in major concessions from the British.|$|E
5|$|As {{the popular}} choice {{leading into the}} election, he handily {{defeated}} fellow councillor Arthur Cushing by a count of 627 votes to 355, and thus became mayor of Edmonton. He served in this capacity for one term of one year, but did not seek re-election in 1906 and retired from political life thereafter. It was during May's term as mayor in which the municipal foundations of Edmonton were set; he oversaw {{the purchase of the}} road maintenance equipment, the city's first telephone system as well as the upgrade of the street car system to steel rails and posts, purchase of land for municipal use, paving of roads, <b>and</b> <b>negotiations</b> {{for the establishment of a}} manufacturing plant in the city. He also travelled to Toronto to lobby for a new union railway station in Edmonton to be constructed for use by the Grand Trunk, Canadian Northern and Canadian Pacific Railways. It was also during May's term which the Alberta Legislature Building would first open its doors, which he would participate in its opening ceremonies. In 1911, he would be named a returning officer for Edmonton, in charge of overseeing the Canadian federal election, 1911.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the Six Day War, Israel {{held the}} entire Sinai peninsula, with the {{exception}} of Port Fouad. Israel's victory in the Six Day War brought about a sense of security within Israel; the occupied territory added strategic depth to the country's defense. Consequently, Israel and Egypt ignored United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 242, which called for withdrawal from occupied territories in return for Arab recognition, <b>and</b> <b>negotiations</b> between the countries ceased. Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir aimed {{to maintain the status quo}} and believed that her country's military strength would secure peace with Arab nations on their terms.

40|$|Ransoms paid to Somali pirates are {{drifting}} upward <b>and</b> <b>negotiation</b> {{times are}} increasing, {{yet there is}} huge variation in bargaining outcomes across shipowners. We use a unique dataset of 179 Somali hijackings, and an underlying theoretical model of the bargaining process based on detailed interviews with ransom negotiators, to analyze the empirical determinants of ransom amounts <b>and</b> <b>negotiation</b> lengths. We find that ransom amount <b>and</b> <b>negotiation</b> length depend on the observable characteristics of both pirates and ships and on the "reference ransom" established by previous ransom payments for a specific ship type. International naval enforcement efforts have driven up ransom amounts. We also observe a "hump-shape" in ransoms, with relatively low ransoms being paid following both short <b>and</b> very long <b>negotiations,</b> <b>and</b> the highest ransoms paid following intermediate length negotiations...|$|R
