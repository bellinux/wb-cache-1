Banton's shouts <b>attract</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> Patrick Newirth, a guest in the room across the hall. When Newirth looks through his room door's peephole, Banton steps back, causing his body shadow slips beneath the door. Newirth suddenly evaporates, leaving a strange burn mark on the floor. Banton realizes what has happened and flees the scene.|$|E
5|$|In some jurisdictions, asexuals have legal protections. While Brazil bans since 1999 {{whatever}} pathologization or attempted {{treatment of}} sexual orientation by mental health professionals through the national ethical code, the U.S. state of New York has labeled asexuals as a protected class. However, asexuality does not typically <b>attract</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> the public or major scrutiny; therefore, {{it has not been}} the subject of legislation as much as other sexual orientations have.|$|E

5|$|At one time, {{the island}} was {{considered}} an arid location, where coconuts were the only useful plants likely to flourish and vegetables were difficult to produce. In {{what has become a}} tropical climate, vegetation is more abundant than in the north of the country, especially during the wet season. Anxious to <b>attract</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> the French colonial administration which he judged insufficiently involved in the development of Casamance, administrator Emmanuel Bertrand-Bocandé submitted a report which documented in great detail the plant species then present on the island. Although this report was written in 1849, the information it contains has remained valuable even into the 21st century.|$|E

5|$|Common elands {{communicate}} via gestures, vocalizations, scent cues {{and display}} behaviors. The flehmen response also occurs, primarily in males {{in response to}} contact with female urine or genitals. Females will urinate to indicate fertility during the appropriate phase of their estrous cycle, {{as well as to}} indicate their lack of fertility when harassed by males. If eland bulls find any of their predators nearby, they will bark and attempt to <b>attract</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> others by trotting back and forth until the entire herd is conscious of the danger. Some of their main predators include lions, African wild dogs, cheetahs and spotted hyenas. Juvenile elands are more vulnerable than adults to their predators.|$|E

In 1565, {{the archbishop of}} Antivari (today Bar, Montenegro) Ambrosius arrived in the town as an apostolic visitor.

In 1601, Solinat was appointed bishop of Sofia with his seat in Chiprovtsi by Pope Clement VIII.

5|$|Murrell's fame greatly {{increased}} {{after his death}} when he was made the subject, albeit in a highly fictionalised form, of a 1900 novel by Arthur Morrison. Morrison also produced a more objective study of the cunning man, published in The Strand magazine. During the 1950s, the folklorist Eric Maple conducted further research on Murrell, finding much local folklore still surrounding him in the Hadleigh area, including the allegation {{that he had the}} ability to fly and to instantaneously transport himself vast distances. Murrell has continued to <b>attract</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> historians and folklorists studying English folk magic, and is referenced in works by scholars like Ronald Hutton, Owen Davies, and Ralph Merrifield.|$|E

5|$|The {{company was}} self-supporting, {{with its own}} engineer, signals, transport, and {{quartermaster}} sections. The signals section had a powerful but cumbersome Wireless Set No. 11 for communicating with the 7th Division. Powered by lead-acid batteries which were recharged with petrol generators, it required multiple signallers to carry and the noise was liable to <b>attract</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> the enemy. The platoons were equipped with the new Army No. 208 Wireless Sets. These were small, portable sets developed for the communication needs of units on the move in jungle warfare. However, the 2/6th Independent Company had not had {{time to work with}} them operationally.|$|E

Oda announced that the government would provide financial aid to the affected civilians, with the help of World Vision and Médecins Sans Frontières.|$|E
5|$|The {{groups are}} divided {{based on their}} {{alternative}} strategies of parasitizing its host colony (Myrmica ants). The predatory (in which the caterpillar preys on the host ants) and 'cuckoo' (in which the caterpillars feed off of the ants' regurgitation) strategies are derived characteristics from the alcon group, with the predatory strategy having evolved from the teleius group and the cuckoo strategy having evolved from the arion-Phengaris group. Another way these groups are categorized is by {{whether or not they}} release a certain chemical (dorsal nectary organ secretions) to <b>attract</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> the host ant. This trait is not as prominent in ancestors of the alcon group and in the M. nausithous, {{which is part of the}} teleius group.|$|E
