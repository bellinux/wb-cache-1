The purpose of this method is to facilitate model-based segmentation algorithms which rely on accurate initialisation and assume that the correct <b>anatomical</b> <b>boundary</b> positions {{are close to the}} current model surface. The method is built around a weak parts-based shape model - the Boundary Fragment Model (BFM) - which represents an object by sections of its boundary. Following previous literature, we use the BFM in a boosted classifier framework to first automatically detect the object of interest. Extending previous work, we use the BFM to drive a classifier which isolates boundary candidates from spurious and irrelevant edge responses. The application of our algorithm leads to a labelled edge map which encodes the positions of (multiple) object boundaries. By way of illustrating what is a general solution, the task of identifying the endocardium and epicardium in three-dimensional ultrasound images is completely examined, including a detailed analysis of the parameters which impact on the model construction, the structure of the learned edge response classifier, and implementation concerns.

30|$|Then {{for both}} groups, the method {{attempts}} {{to correct the}} signal voids within the <b>anatomical</b> <b>boundary</b> in a two-step process. First, the Dixon-water image of the patient was aligned with an atlas where the oral cavity had been masked. The atlas represents the Dixon-water image averaged across 30 patients without dental artifacts. By investigating the area where no patients had signal voids, {{it was possible to}} identify the boundaries of the oral cavity. Second, all signal void regions overlapping with the mask were filled with a value representing the attenuation of soft tissue (0.1  cm− 1), thereby assuming that noticeable signal voids in the dental region result from metallic dental implants only. Third, all partly filled signal voids were inspected automatically. Those filled more than 80 % of the total volume were filled completely, and those filled less than 10 % were considered an error and therefore reversed. This was done to complete artifact voids extending outside the oral cavity mask or to compensate for smaller errors in the registration to the atlas. The high threshold of 80 % was chosen such that the sinuses did not get filled if these were connected to the dental artifact regions.|$|R
5000|$|Cysts rarely {{cause any}} symptoms, unless they become {{secondarily}} infected. The signs depend mostly upon {{the size and}} location of the cyst. If the cyst has not expanded beyond the normal <b>anatomical</b> <b>boundaries</b> of the bone, {{then there will be}} no palpable lump outside or inside the mouth. The vast majority of cysts expand slowly, and the surrounding bone has time to increase its density around the lesion, which is the body's attempt to isolate the lesion. Cysts that have expanded beyond the normal anatomic boundaries of a bone are still often covered with a thin layer of new bone. At this stage, there may be a sign termed [...] "eggshell cracking", where the thinned cortical plate cracks when pressure is applied. A lump may be felt, which may feel hard if there is still bone covering the cyst, or fluctuant if the cyst has eroded through the bone surrounding it. A cyst may become acutely infected, and discharge into the oral cavity via a sinus. Adjacent teeth may be loosened, tilted or even moved bodily. Rarely, roots of teeth are resorbed, depending upon the type of cyst. The inferior alveolar nerve runs through the mandible and supplies sensation to the lower lip and chin. As most cysts expand slowly, there will be no altered sensation (anesthesia or paraesthesia), since the inferior alveolar canal is harmlessly enveloped or displaced over time. More aggressive cysts, or acute infection of any cyst may cause altered sensation.|$|E
5000|$|Neuromeres {{were first}} {{discovered}} {{in the beginning of}} the 20th century. [...] Although researchers have long since recognized the different signs of differentiation during embryonic development, it was widely thought that neuromeres held no relation to the structure of the nervous system. [...] Swedish neuroembyrologists Bergquist and Kallen clarified the role of neuromeres by conducting several studies showing that neuromeres are important in the development of the nervous system. [...] These experiments consisted of studying the brains of different vertebrates during their development period. During embryonic development, neural crest cells from each neuromere prompt the development of the nerves and arteries, helping to support the development of craniofacial tissues. If gene expression goes wrong, it can have severe effects on the developing embryo, causing abnormalities like craniofacial clefts, also known as cleft palates. [...] The <b>anatomical</b> <b>boundaries</b> of neuromers are determined by the expression of unique genes known as Hox genes in a particular zone. The Hox genes contain the 183-bp homeobox, which encodes a particular portion of the Hox proteins called the homeodomain. The homeodomain can then bind to other portions of DNA to regulate gene expression. These genes determine the basic structure and orientation of an organism after the embryonic segments have formed. [...] The neural crest cells that are found outside of a given neuromere will express the same proteins as the cells that are found inside the neural tube. [...] The genes that are being expressed fall into two categories, extracellular signaling proteins and intracellular transcription factors. [...] The genes are able to perform different tasks at different times depending on the environment that may or not be changing as well as when they are being activated and expressed.|$|E

In this study, we investigated whether distribution of slow cycling, label-retaining cells (LRCs) could be determined precisely against a definable anatomical structure of an eye. We found that a boundary between the cornea and the limbus could be determined reliably by distinct epithelial nuclear staining patterns.

40|$|In {{the past}} 60 years, the {{replacement}} of the aortic valve by a prosthesis has become a routine treatment for severe aortic valve failure. Several valve prostheses have been developed of which the bileaflet mechanical heart valves (BMHVs) are widely preferred. However, current BMHVs still induce thromboembolism, among other undesired side effects, which is believed to be due to non-physiological flow generated by the leaflets. Insights into the dynamics of a BMHV can be provided by numerical methods. In this study, the dynamics of the BMHV are calculated by a strong fluid-structure interaction (FSI) coupling algorithm and the aortic BMHV is simulated under realistic, patient-specific boundary conditions. Upstream of the valve, a model of the left ventricle is constructed. The geometry downstream of the valve consists of a patient-specific aorta with patient-specific flow rates and physiological pressure profiles at its endings.

40|$|International audienceHadron {{therapy is}} an {{advanced}} radiotherapy technique for cancer treatment. It offers a better irradiation ballistic than conventional techniques and requires an appropriate quality assurance procedures. Tumor motion during irradiation reduces target coverage and increases dose to healthy tissues. Unfortunately, the continuous organ density changes due to respiratory motion and affect the ranges of ions {{which can lead}} to unwanted dose distributions in the case of lung tumors. Accurate 4 D dosimetry calculations are important for treatment planning verification and evaluation. They require temporal information about the tumor position, size and shape, as well as information regarding the tissue density variation along the beam path during treatment. For more precision, several studies have focused on the biomechanical models of the respiratory system based on finite element method. These approaches are based on continuum mechanics of materials properties, mesh organ geometry, as well as <b>anatomical</b> <b>boundary</b> conditions. However, so far, they do not take completely into account density variations needed for dose calculations.

30|$|Another {{approach}} {{to suppress the}} Gibbs artefacts is to use penalties in a penalised likelihood reconstruction algorithm, or equivalently, priors in a maximum a posteriori reconstruction algorithm. Usually convex penalties are used, which ensure that the problem has a unique solution. When such a penalty {{is applied to the}} problem of Figure 2, it would take a different value for all the possible solutions to the unconstrained problem. For this particular 1 D problem, the best penalty would be one that favours piecewise smooth solutions. An example of penalty design for clinical PET reconstruction is [9]. Even better penalties can be designed when additional knowledge about the patient anatomy is available from other imaging modalities such as CT or MR. These penalties typically assume that <b>anatomical</b> <b>boundaries</b> tend to coincide with metabolic boundaries, and therefore avoid smoothing over <b>anatomical</b> <b>boundaries.</b> Since the anatomical images usually have a better resolution than the PET system, this additional knowledge helps to assign meaningful amplitudes to detail that was invisible to the PET system [10]. This approach can produce images with excellent visual and quantitative properties [11]. However, they have a very non-uniform spatial resolution and training is required to make optimal use of the diagnostic information in these images.|$|E

As the nose {{is the first}} <b>anatomical</b> <b>boundary</b> of the upper airway, nasal obstruction may contribute to sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). A number of pathophysiological mechanisms can potentially explain the role of nasal pathology in SDB. These include the Starling resistor model, the unstable oral airway, the nasal ventilatory reflex {{and the role of}} nitric oxide (NO). Clinically, a number of case-control studies have shown that nasal obstruction is associated with snoring and mild SDB. However, there is not a linear correlation between the degree of nasal obstruction and the severity of SDB, while nasal obstruction is not the main contributing factor in the majority of patients with moderate to severe OSA. Randomised controlled studies have shown that in patients with allergic rhinitis or non-allergic rhinitis and sleep disturbance, nasal steroids could improve the subjective quality of sleep, and may be useful for patients with mild OSA, however, they are not by themselves an adequate treatment for most OSA patients. Similarly, nasal surgery may improve quality of life and snoring in a subgroup of patients with mild SDB and septal deviation, but it is not an effective treatment for OSA as such. On the other hand, in patients who do not tolerate continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) well, if upper airway evaluation demonstrates an obstructive nasal passage, nasal airway surgery can improve CPAP compliance and adherenc...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDuring the minimally-invasive liver surgery, {{only the}} partial surface {{view of the}} liver is usually {{provided}} to the surgeon via the laparoscopic camera. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} estimate the actual position of the internal structures such as tumors and vessels from the pre-operative images. Nevertheless, such task can be highly challenging since during the intervention, the abdominal organs undergo important deformations due to the pneumoperitoneum, respiratory and cardiac motion and the interaction with the surgical tools. Therefore, a reliable automatic system for intra-operative guidance requires fast and reliable registration of the pre- and intra-operative data. In this paper we present a complete pipeline for the registration of pre-operative patient-specific image data to the sparse and incomplete intra-operative data. While the intra-operative data is represented by a point cloud extracted from the stereo-endoscopic images, the pre-operative data is used to reconstruct a biomechanical model which is necessary for accurate estimation of the position of the internal structures, considering the actual deformations. This model takes into account the patient-specific liver anatomy composed of parenchyma, vascularization and capsule, and is enriched with <b>anatomical</b> <b>boundary</b> conditions transferred from an atlas. The registration process employs the iterative closest point technique together with a penalty-based method.

40|$|AbstractThe nonstructural 3 {{a protein}} of the positive-strand RNA bromovinuses is {{required}} for infection spread in plants and is acrucial determinant of host specificity in systemic infection. To determine the paths of wild-type (wt) bromovirus infection spread, the step at which 3 a mutants are arrested, {{and the nature of}} the host specificity associated with the 3 a gene, we used in situ hybridization to examine infection spread by cowpea chlorotic mottle bromovirus (CCMV) and its derivatives at the level of individual cells in cowpea leaf epidermis. From 1 to 3 days post inoculation (dpi), wt CCMV spread from initially infected cells to adjacent cells, creating expanding infection foci whose radii grew by one additional epidermal cell diameter every 5 hr. By 3 to 4 dpi, vascular elements contacting such foci acted as conduits for further infection spread. By contrast, a 3 a frameshift derivative multiplied in initially infected epidermal cells but failed to move into neighboring cells even by 4 dpi, showing that the 3 a gene is essential for cell-to-cell spread. Most interestingly, a CCMV derivative with the 3 a gene replaced by that of a bromovirus not adapted to cowpea, brome mosaic virus (BMV), initially spread from cell to cell in cowpea plants, but stopped spreading between 1 and 2 dpi, when most infection foci encompassed 40 – 80 epidermal cells. Thus, the host-specificity restriction imposed by BMV 3 a protein did not result from an inability to direct the spread of infection out of initially infected cowpea cells, but from a much later block. The apparent absence of any preexisting <b>anatomical</b> <b>boundary</b> at the limit of infection spread and localized tissue changes at the infection foci suggested that induced host responses might have contributed to this block...|$|R
