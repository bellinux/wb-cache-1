[...] Spanish soprano Montserrat Caballé, with whom Mercury recorded an album, expressed her opinion that [...] "the difference between Freddie and almost all the other rock stars {{was that he was}} selling the voice".

500|$|Reeves and Baker {{completed}} {{a third and}} final draft that was [...] "substantially toned down" [...] in content from the previous attempts. This version of the screenplay, which was filmed {{with only a few}} minor revisions during the production, was missing many of the more explicit moments of violence described in the first submitted drafts: the death spasms of the pre-credits hanging victim, Lowes getting stabbed fifteen times with a steel spike, and a sniper's victim somersaulting through the air <b>and</b> <b>slamming</b> into a tree. A sequence depicting the Battle of Naseby was to be filmed, during which a soldier's head was to be cut off on screen. Most significantly, the film's finale was completely altered. In the original ending, Stearne falls in with a group of gypsies and attempts to rape one of their women, who successfully fights off her attacker by plunging her thumbs into his eyes, blinding him. The gypsies then stake him to death. Marshall arrives and convinces the gypsies to assist him in ambushing Hopkins. Hopkins is viciously beaten by Marshall, who forces a [...] "confession" [...] out of the bloodied man. Marshall partially drowns Hopkins (whose thumbs have been tied to his feet), then finally hangs him. Tenser had previously expressed concerns regarding the scope of the Battle of Naseby sequence as well as the gypsy-ending, noting that these would both require the employment of additional groups of extras. He asked Reeves and Baker to remove the battle sequence and simplify the ending for the final draft.|$|E
