25|$|One of {{the first}} {{tantalum}} electrolytic capacitors were developed in 1930 by Tansitor Electronic Inc. USA, for military purposes. The basic construction of a wound cell was adopted and a tantalum anode foil was used together with a tantalum cathode foil, separated with a paper spacer impregnated with <b>a</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>electrolyte,</b> mostly sulfuric acid, and encapsulated in a silver case.|$|E
25|$|On August 2006, {{to prove}} the {{chemical}} and thermal robustness of the 1-ethyl-3 methylimidazolium tetracyanoborate solar cell, the researchers subjected the devices to heating at 80°C {{in the dark for}} 1000 hours, followed by light soaking at 60°C for 1000 hours. After dark heating and light soaking, 90% of the initial photovoltaic efficiency was maintained – the first time such excellent thermal stability has been observed for <b>a</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>electrolyte</b> that exhibits such a high conversion efficiency. Contrary to silicon solar cells, whose performance declines with increasing temperature, the dye-sensitized solar-cell devices were only negligibly influenced when increasing the operating temperature from ambient to 60°C.|$|E

50|$|SolidEnergy uses a {{combination}} of solid and <b>liquid</b> <b>electrolytes.</b> The solid electrolyte {{is applied to the}} lithium-metal foil—the ions don’t have far to travel through this thin material, so it does not matter that they move relatively slowly. Once through the solid electrolyte, they reach <b>a</b> non-flammable <b>liquid</b> <b>electrolyte,</b> which ferries them to the opposite electrode. The electrolyte has additives that prevent the lithium metal from reacting with it and that prevent dendrites.|$|R
50|$|Every {{capacitor}} has two electrodes, mechanically {{separated by}} a separator. They are electrically connected via the electrolyte, a mixture {{of positive and negative}} ions dissolved in a solvent such as water. An area originates at the electrode surfaces where the <b>liquid</b> <b>electrolyte</b> contacts the electrode's conductive metallic surface. This interface forms a common boundary between two phases of matter, such as an insoluble solid electrode surface and <b>an</b> adjacent <b>liquid</b> <b>electrolyte.</b> In this interface occurs a special phenomenon of the double layer effect.|$|R
25|$|A {{wet cell}} battery has <b>a</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>electrolyte.</b> Other names are flooded cell, since the liquid covers all {{internal}} parts, or vented cell, since gases produced during operation can {{escape to the}} air. Wet cells were a precursor to dry cells and are commonly used as a learning tool for electrochemistry. They can be built with common laboratory supplies, such as beakers, for demonstrations of how electrochemical cells work. A particular type of wet cell known as a concentration cell is important in understanding corrosion. Wet cells may be primary cells (non-rechargeable) or secondary cells (rechargeable). Originally, all practical primary batteries such as the Daniell cell were built as open-top glass jar wet cells. Other primary wet cells are the Leclanche cell, Grove cell, Bunsen cell, Chromic acid cell, Clark cell, and Weston cell. The Leclanche cell chemistry was adapted to the first dry cells. Wet cells are still used in automobile batteries and in industry for standby power for switchgear, telecommunication or large uninterruptible power supplies, but in many places batteries with gel cells have been used instead. These applications commonly use lead–acid or nickel–cadmium cells.|$|E

2500|$|Electrolytic {{capacitors}} use {{an aluminum}} or tantalum plate with an oxide dielectric layer. The second electrode is <b>a</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>electrolyte,</b> {{connected to the}} circuit by another foil plate. Electrolytic capacitors offer very high capacitance but suffer from poor tolerances, high instability, gradual loss of capacitance especially when subjected to heat, and high leakage current. Poor quality capacitors may leak electrolyte, which is harmful to printed circuit boards. The conductivity of the electrolyte drops at low temperatures, which increases equivalent series resistance. While widely used for power-supply conditioning, poor high-frequency characteristics make them unsuitable for many applications. Electrolytic capacitors suffer from self-degradation if unused for a period (around a year), and when full power is applied may short circuit, permanently damaging the capacitor and usually blowing a fuse or causing failure of rectifier diodes. For example, in older equipment, this may cause arcing in rectifier tubes. They can be restored before use by gradually applying the operating voltage, often performed on antique vacuum tube equipment {{over a period of}} thirty minutes by using a variable transformer to supply AC power. [...] The use of this technique may be less satisfactory for some solid state equipment, which may be damaged by operation below its normal power range, requiring that the power supply first be isolated from the consuming circuits. Such remedies may not be applicable to modern high-frequency power supplies as these produce full output voltage even with reduced input.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the role of}} the addition of an organic solvent to <b>an</b> ionic <b>liquid</b> <b>electrolyte</b> for the performance of lithium-sulphur (Li-S) batteries.

We show that this in turn is linked to a change in the local environment of the Li-ions where the organic solvent is incorporated in the coordination shell. In addition we show that the mixed electrolytes have a considerably higher thermal stability, in particular a dramatically increased flash point, and improved low temperature properties with respect to a conventional organic solvent based electrolyte currently used for Li-S batteries...|$|R

40|$|Li-S batteries, {{having one}} of highest {{theoretical}} energy densities possible, have been suggested {{as a way to}} improve on {{the current state of the}} art. However, the dissolution of intermediate polysulfide species in the electrolyte has so far greatly reduced the cycleabilty of these batteries.

This work investigates the polysulfide speciation in Li-S cells with <b>an</b> ionic <b>liquid</b> <b>electrolyte</b> during charge and discharge. Four different room temperature ionic liquids were studied and found to dissolve polysulfides in small concentrations. One of the ionic liquids, PP 14 -TFSI, was examined further using UV-Vis spectroscopy to identify the polysulfide ions present in the electrolyte at different points of the charge/discharge cycle. It was found that the first step of the reaction during discharge produces S 2 6 with only small amounts of other polysulfides. Most of the S 2 6 was then reduced to S 2 3 and S 2 4 in a second reaction step. These reactions showed good reversibility during charge, however a rapid decline in capacity was observed with continued cycling.
