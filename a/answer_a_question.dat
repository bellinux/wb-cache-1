25|$|A {{recent study}} found that lying takes longer than telling the truth, and thus the time to <b>answer</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> may be used as a method of lie detection. However, it has also been shown that instant-answers can be proof of a {{prepared}} lie. The only compromise is to try to surprise the victim and find a midway answer, not too quick, nor too long.|$|E

5000|$|Each contestant's run {{is divided}} into ten rounds of 50 {{questions}} each. Each round has ten categories (one of which is always [...] "Random", consisting of general knowledge questions) with five questions each. The contestant can choose <b>a</b> <b>question</b> from the categories in any order. Whenever the contestant <b>answers</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> correctly, the correctly-answered question is highlighted silver within its category. <b>Answering</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> incorrectly results in a [...] "wrong", with three wrong <b>answers</b> in <b>a</b> row eliminating the contestant. Also, whenever the contestant incorrectly <b>answers</b> <b>a</b> <b>question,</b> it is highlighted in red under its category. However, answering any question correctly will erase any wrongs the contestant has accumulated.|$|R

25|$|The Australian Broadcasting Corporation, in its {{documentary}} series Inside Story, in 1978 produced a programme on the Tamam Shud case, entitled The Somerton Beach Mystery, where reporter Stuart Littlemore investigated the case, including interviewing Boxall, who could add no new {{information on the}} case, and Paul Lawson, who made the plaster cast of the body, and who refused to <b>answer</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> about whether anyone had positively identified the body.|$|E
25|$|Many other {{game shows}} feature a sudden-death playoff; usually, the next player to <b>answer</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> {{correctly}} wins. Often, {{the rules of}} sudden death provide that in the event a wrong answer is given, the opposing team wins (for instance, the radio quiz show Ask Me Another utilizes this format), even though wrong answers may otherwise not be penalized. Occasionally, the format is a numeric question, with the player making the closer guess winning.|$|E
25|$|The cue {{familiarity}} {{hypothesis was}} proposed by Reder and Ritter after completing {{a pair of}} experiments which indicated that individuals can evaluate their ability to <b>answer</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> before trying to answer it. This finding suggests that the question (cue) and not the actual memory (target) is crucial for making metamemory judgments. Consequently, this hypothesis implies that judgements regarding metamemory are based on an individual’s level of familiarity with the information provided in the cue. Therefore, an individual {{is more likely to}} judge that they know the answer to a question if they are familiar with its topic or terms and more likely to judge that they do not know the answer to a question which presents new or unfamiliar terms.|$|E

25|$|After viewing a question, the {{contestant}} {{can leave}} the game with the money already won rather than attempting an answer. If the contestant answers a question incorrectly, then all of their winnings are lost, except that the £1,000 and £32,000 prizes are guaranteed: if a player gets a question wrong above these levels, then the prize drops to the previous guaranteed prize. Answering the £2,000 and £64,000 questions wrong does not reduce the prize money. The prizes are generally non-cumulative; that is, answering a question correctly does not result in the amount being played for being added to the amount already won, rather the amount already won is written off and replaced by a larger sum, usually twice as large. The game ends when the contestant answers a question incorrectly, decides not to <b>answer</b> <b>a</b> <b>question,</b> or answers all questions correctly.|$|E

500|$|In short, {{a person}} could refuse to <b>answer</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> if that {{particular}} answer could incriminate them, e.g., a professional killer could decline {{to answer the question}} of what his or her occupation was. All that is necessary to ask is, could the answer to the question, alone, provide a [...] "link in the chain" [...] necessary to provide evidence to a crime. Saying your occupation is [...] "assassin" [...] or [...] "professional killer" [...] could, and therefore the 5th Amendment could be invoked as to that question; saying you made $635,000 last year does not provide evidence of anything criminal and thus it could not.|$|E

[...] "It's almost like I {{got the chance to}} go to Oz and Quincy was the Wizard of Oz and Michael Jackson was who he was dealing with in his world. Their work ethic is unbelievable." [...] He noted how Jones would fall asleep on the board, waking up to <b>answer</b> <b>a</b> <b>question.</b> [...] "He works in the Alpha state a lot", Ingram added. Two of Jackson's sisters, Janet and La Toya, provided backing vocals in the guise of the P.Y.T.s. The two sisters sang [...] "na na na" [...] back at their brother {{towards the end of the}} song.

500|$|Contestants {{were given}} the {{standard}} three lifelines {{in place at the}} time (50:50, Ask the Audience, and Phone-a-Friend) {{at the beginning of the}} game. However, after correctly answering the $100,000 question, the contestant earned two additional lifelines: Three Wise Men and Double Dip. The Three Wise Men lifeline involved a panel of three experts, one of whom was always a former Millionaire contestant and at least one of whom was female. When this lifeline was used, the contestant and panel had 30 seconds to discuss the question and choices before the audio and video feeds were dropped. Double Dip gave a contestant two chances to <b>answer</b> <b>a</b> <b>question.</b> Once used, no further lifelines could be used; moreover, if the [...] "first final answer" [...] was incorrect, the contestant could not walk away. If the [...] "second final answer" [...] was also wrong, the contestant left with $100,000.|$|E
500|$|Ludia {{has also}} created a Facebook game based on Millionaire, which debuted on March 21, 2011.

A contestant can compete against eight other Millionaire fans in round one, and play round two alone if they {{make it into the}} top three. There is no [...] "final answer" [...] rule; the contestant's responses are automatically locked in. Answering a question correctly earns a contestant the value of that question, multiplied by {{the number of people who}} responded incorrectly. Contestants are allowed to use two of their Facebook friends as Jump the Question lifelines in round one, and to use the Ask the Audience lifeline in round two to invite up to 50 such friends of theirs to <b>answer</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> for a portion of the prize money of the current question.|$|E

500|$|The Doctor, {{aware of}} his {{imminent}} death at the fixed point of time on 22 April 2011 at Lake Silencio in Utah, attempts {{to track down the}} Silence to learn why he must die. He encounters the Teselecta shapeshifting robot and its miniaturised crew who are currently posing as {{one of the members of}} the Silence; they offer him any help within their power as he faces his death. Through them, the Doctor is led to the living head of Dorium Maldovar, one of the Doctor's allies taken by the Order of the Headless Monks ("A Good Man Goes to War"). Dorium reveals that the Silence are dedicated to averting the Doctor's future, warning him [...] "On the fields of Trenzalore, at the fall of the Eleventh, when no living creature can speak falsely or fail to <b>answer</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> will be asked—one that must never be answered. And Silence must fall when the question is asked." [...] ("The Time of the Doctor") The Doctor continues to refuse to go to Lake Silencio until he discovers his old friend Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart has died, at which point he accepts his fate. To avoid crossing his own time stream, he gives the Teselecta crew four invitations to Lake Silencio for Amy and Rory, River Song, Canton Everett Delaware III, and a younger version of himself.|$|E
