40|$|Because the Constitution 2 ̆ 7 s fiscal {{provisions}} are not self-executing, federal budget processes have been shaped largely by an implicit 2 ̆ 7 fiscal constitution 2 ̆ 2 composed of framework statutes and legislative and administrative practice. This Article {{contends that the}} ambition of the Gramm-Rudman- Hollings Act (GRH) was radically to redesign this constitution by creating an extralegislative mechanism (2 ̆ 2 sequestration 2 ̆ 2) to enforce statutorily prescribed deficit limits. Professor Stith demonstrates how GRH alters several aspects of traditionalp ractice: It makes the annual budget deficit the driving concern of the legislative budget process, it makes the timing of outlays critically important to appropriations decisions, and it encourages greater participation by Congress in line-item <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>appropriations.</b> GRH does not, however, directly constrain spending in {{over half of the}} budget, which it exempts from sequestration. Moreover, there is an inherent limit to the effectiveness of sequestration as a deficit-reduction strategy. As the threat of sequestration becomes greater, the plausibility of the threat decreases because Congress can always repeal, amend, or suspend GRI. Professor Stith concludes that GRH is a constitutionally permissible way to constrain deficit growth, but it is neither a fundamental reordering of our fiscal processes nor a 2 ̆ 2 solution 2 ̆ 2 to the persistent deficit problem...|$|E

40|$|Budgeting {{process is}} central to any {{administration}} be it local, state or federal public or private because control of the purse {{is perhaps the most}} effective tool of coordination. The scope and nature of the entire governmental operations is determined by the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> to the various programmes. In fact human nature is never evident than when men are struggling to gain a larger share of funds from common purse. This paper examined budgeting at the local government level, its preparation, problems and prospects. The study discovered that there is a wide gap between budget plan and its implementation which results in unfulfillment of political promises and non-satisfaction of heightened expectation of the people. The wide spread dissatisfaction of the masses against local government has greatly contributed to low rate of development of local communities. The paper made some recommendations that will reduce incidence of deficit budget in local Government to a vanishing point...|$|R

In response to the importance of New Bedford as a port city, the U.S. Congress authorized the construction of a Custom House in 1832. The initial appropriation was $15,000, but the funds were insufficient to meet new U.S. Treasury Department requirements for fireproof construction.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> New Deal <b>appropriations</b> to {{agricultural}} interests in Alabama's sixty-seven counties during the Great Depression. Conventional wisdom indicates that Roosevelt, through the New Deal, brought assistance {{to those in}} need. However, recent literature has identified a political motivation to the pattern of spending that emerged during the economic downturn. The authors develop and estimate a model with data which has only recently become available. The results show that while communities with the highest farm income received larger appropriations as expected, counties that experienced a collapse in farm income during the Great Depression received no special consideration from those officials responsible for distributing New Deal dollars across the state. These results indicate that self-interest was an important motivator in allocating agricultural appropriations {{in the state of}} Alabama during the Great Depression. Depression...|$|R

40|$|This thesis studies {{contemporary}} poetry’s {{innovations in}} textual borrowing {{and the range}} and scope of its appropriative practices. The restrictions of the inherited definitions <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> include a limited capacity for expression and meaningfulness, a partial concept of appropriation’s critical capacity, and an inadequate sense of the poet’s individual and unique practice <b>of</b> <b>appropriation.</b> This thesis resolves the problematic constraints limiting contemporary definitions <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> by tracing {{the history of the}} practice to reveal an enduring relation between appropriation and poetic expression. Close readings of Trevor Joyce’s, Alan Halsey’s, and Susan Howe’s poetry serve as evidence of contemporary poetry’s development <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> beyond the current ascriptions and offer some direction on how the critical understanding <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> might be extended and redefined.

40|$|This article {{introduces}} the notion <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> in debates {{on how to}} account for migrants’ capacity to defy restrictive border controls and migration policies. What the notion <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> better captures than concepts like agency or resistance is the multi-faceted and intricate intertwinement of border regimes and migratory practices. The article illustrates this advantage through {{an analysis of the}} phenomenon of bezness. The term refers to a migration strategy of aspiring migrants who seduce and subsequently marry European tourists as a way to gain entry to and residency in Europe. This article develops a reading of bezness as a mode <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> mobility which is intertwined with the border regime in at least four ways: First, bezness is provoked by restrictive visa policies that create a highly unequal access to mobility and life opportunities. The case of bezness illustrates, second, that migrants try to recode the methods, logics and effects of mobility control into means <b>of</b> <b>appropriation.</b> Migrants’ practices <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> involve, third, the clandestine transgression of the norms, rules and regulations that define particular border regimes. Finally, the notion <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> permits to recognise that the European border regime operates as an apparatus of capture that tries to recuperate migrants’ practices in order to turn them into a driving force for its own development. The example of bezness demonstrates, moreover, that these processes of recuperation also feature the mobilisation of emotions – in this case of romantic love – as technologies of government...|$|R

40|$|According to Locke, {{appropriation}} is {{a precondition}} for moral responsibility and thus we can expect that it plays a distinctive role in his theory. Yet it is rare to find an interpretation of Locke’s account <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> that does not associate it with serious problems. To {{make room for a}} more satisfying understanding of Locke’s account <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> we have to analyse why it was so widely misunderstood. The aim of this paper is fourfold: First, I will show that Mackie’s and Winkler’s interpretations that have shaped the subsequent discussion contain serious flaws. Second, I will argue that the so-called appropriation interpretation —that is the view that appropriation is meant to provide alternative persistence conditions for persons—lacks support. Third, I will re-examine Locke’s texts and argue that we can come {{to a better understanding of}} his notion <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> in the Essay if we interpret it in analogy to his account <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> in Two Treatises. Fourth, I will offer a more fine-grained interpretation of the role <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> in relation to persistence conditions for persons.

40|$|The {{management}} of global commons is of vital importance for modern society. The current solutions attempt to internalize the cost <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> commons by adding {{this to the}} cost of private resources. In this paper we will show that this approach has some fundamental weaknesses. To overcome these shortcomings, we have proposed to segregate the {{management of}} private and shared resources by using non-scalar numbers for the underlying economic signals of money and price. We prove that the resulting non-scalar economy always reaches a macro-economic equilibrium point where the level <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> commons by the society remains steady. The second contribution {{of this paper is to}} show that the proposed design of the non-scalar economy would guarantee the accuracy of price signal with respect to the <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> commons.
