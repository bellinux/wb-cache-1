25|$|However, a bear's first {{reaction}} upon detecting a human {{is to run}} away. Fergus lists a few possible causes for this instinctive reaction, each a speculation or theory based more on intuition rather than physical evidence. Some speculate that bears inherit their cautious nature from thousands of years <b>ago</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> had {{to be wary of}} larger and more dangerous carnivores. Some believe that bears have come to relate a human presence to firearms, or other weaponry, that they have come to fear. Still others think that hunters tend to target more aggressive bears, thus leaving only the more shy and timid bears to reproduce, creating a population of bears less hostile than before.|$|E

25|$|The {{region was}} already {{inhabited}} by Homo erectus from 1,000,000 years ago during the Middle Pleistocene age. Homo sapiens reached the region by around 45,000 years ago, having moved eastwards from the Indian subcontinent. Homo floresiensis also {{lived in the}} area up until 12,000 years <b>ago,</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> became extinct. Austronesian people, who form {{the majority of the}} modern population in Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, East Timor, and the Philippines, may have migrated to Southeast Asia from Taiwan. They arrived in Indonesia around 2000BC, and as they spread through the archipelago, they often settled along coastal areas and confined indigenous peoples such as Orang Asli of peninsular Malaysia, Negritos of the Philippines or Papuans of New Guinea to inland regions. Archaeologists refer these people as Deutero-Malays, whom are more advanced in farming techniques and metal knowledge than their indigenous counterpart, the Proto-Malays.|$|E
25|$|Phenotypic {{and genetic}} {{data suggest that}} the red {{imported}} fire ant and the black imported fire ant (Solenopsis richteri) differ from each other, but they do share a close genetic relationship. Hybridisation between the two ants occurs in areas where they make contact, with the hybrid zone located in Mississippi. Such hybridisation has resulted from secondary contact between these two ants several decades <b>ago,</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> first encountered each other in southern Alabama. Based on mitochondrial DNA, examined haplotypes do not form a monophyletic clade. Some of the examined haplotypes form a closer relationship to S. megergates, S. quinquecuspis and S. richteri than they do with other S. invicta haplotypes. The occurrence of a possible paraphyletic grouping suggests that the red imported fire ant and S. quinquecuspis are possible cryptic species groups composed of several species that cannot be distinguished morphologically.|$|E
25|$|Wolf {{hunting is}} the {{practice}} of hunting gray wolves (Canis lupus) or other species of wolves. Wolves are mainly hunted for sport, for their skins, to protect livestock, and, in some rare cases, to protect humans. Wolves have been actively hunted since 8,000 to 10,000years <b>ago,</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> first began to {{pose a threat to}} livestock vital for the survival of Neolithic human communities. Historically, the hunting of wolves was a huge capital- and manpower-intensive operation. The threat wolves posed to both livestock and people was considered significant enough to warrant the conscription of whole villages under threat of punishment, despite the disruption of economic activities and reduced taxes. The hunting of gray wolves, while originally actively endorsed in many countries, has become a controversial issue in some nations. Opponents see it as cruel, unnecessary and based on misconceptions, while proponents argue that it is vital for the conservation of game herds and as pest control.|$|E
30|$|The {{distribution}} of O. rufipogon {{is known to}} range from Asia to Australia beyond the biogeographical boundary known as the Wallace line (Wallace 1880, Vaughan 1994). In contrast, the {{distribution of}} O. meridionalis is restricted and endemic to Oceania. The Wallace line separates {{the edges of the}} ancient continents, Sunda (the expanded Eurasian continent including Malaysia) and Saful (the united landmasses of New Guinea, Australia, and Tasmania). It is known that fauna and flora have crossed this line for dispersal. Some fauna migrated across the line when sea levels became lower at the last Glacial Maximum. For example, humans migrated across this line 50, 000 [*]~[*] 70, 000  years <b>ago,</b> <b>when</b> presumably <b>they</b> had not yet acquired agriculture (Bellwood 2005). Flora and fauna have migrated between Asia and Australia over an extended period (Augee and Fox 2012).|$|R
50|$|Shell {{ornaments}} {{were very}} common during the Upper Paleolithic, from 50-40,000 years <b>ago</b> onwards, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> spread with modern humans to Europe and Asia. They generally {{take the form}} of perforated shells (as well as other hard organic material such as tooth, bone, antler and mammoth ivory) which are thought to have been suspended and used as jewelry. The most commonly found species are Homalopoma sanguineum, Littorina obtusata, Cyclope species, Nassarius mutabilis and Nassarius gibbosulus. Fossil shells were used alongside those of contemporary species. Some shells were stained with ochre. In Europe, the shells of both Atlantic and Mediterranean species were used, again circulating over distances of hundreds of kilometers. During the neolithic period shell necklaces were made with the shells of 3 genera Spondylus, Glycymeris and Charonia.|$|R

25|$|The Ch’ols of Chiapas {{migrated}} to the northwest of the state starting about 2,000 years <b>ago,</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were concentrated in Guatemala and Honduras. Those Ch’ols who remained in the south are distinguished by the name Chortís. Chiapas Ch’ols {{are closely related to}} the Chontal in Tabasco as well. Choles are found in Tila, Tumbalá, Sabanilla, Palenque, and Salto de Agua, with an estimated population of about 115,000 people. The Ch’ol language belongs to the Maya family and is related to Tzeltal, Tzotzil, Lacandon, Tojolabal, and Yucatec Mayan. There are three varieties of Chol (spoken in Tila, Tumbalá, and Sabanilla), all mutually intelligible. Over half of speakers are monolingual in the Chol language. Women wear a long navy blue or black skirt with a white blouse heavily embroidered with bright colors and a sash with a red ribbon. The men only occasionally use traditional dress for events such as the feast of the Virgin of Guadalupe. This dress usually includes pants, shirts and huipils made of undyed cotton, with leather huaraches, a carrying sack and a hat. The fundamental economic activity of the Ch’ols is agriculture. They primarily cultivate corn and beans, as well as sugar cane, rice, coffee, and some fruits. They have Catholic beliefs strongly influenced by native ones. Harvests are celebrated on the Feast of Saint Rose on 30 August.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the first}} {{movements}} of early modern humans out of Africa occurred 130 - 100 thousand years <b>ago</b> (ka), <b>when</b> <b>they</b> migrated northward to the Levant region. The climatic conditions that accompanied this migration are still under debate. Using high-precision multicollector-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) U-Th methods, we dated carbonate cave deposits (speleothems) from the central and southern Negev Desert of Israel, located at the northeastern margin of the Saharan-Arabian Desert. Speleothems grow only when rainwater enters the unsaturated zone, and this study reveals that a major cluster of wet episodes (the last recorded in the area) occurred between 140 and 110 ka. This episodic wet period coincided with increased monsoonal precipitation in the southern parts of the Saharan-Arabian Desert. The disappearance {{at this time of}} the desert barrier between central Africa and the Levant, and particularly in the Sinai-Negev land bridge between Africa and Asia, would have created a climatic "window" for early modern human dispersion to the Levant. © 2007 The Geological Society of America...|$|R

60|$|One {{would have}} thought that at such a time the hearts of our forefathers would be full of nothing but hope and joy, content and thankfulness. And yet it was not so.

You see it especially in the Litany, which was to be said not only on Sundays, but on Wednesdays and Fridays also. Some people think the Litany painfully sad--too sad. It was not too sad for the time in which it was written. Our forefathers, three hundred years ago, meant what <b>they</b> said <b>when</b> <b>they</b> cried to God to have mercy upon them, miserable sinners, and not to remember their offences nor the offences of their forefathers, &c.
