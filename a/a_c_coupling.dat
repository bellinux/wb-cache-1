40|$|Coding, {{which refers}} to the {{translation}} between the user-provided information bits (source bits) and the transmitted data symbols (coded symbols), Error-control coding, whose aim is to mitigate the effects of noise, was discussed in Chapters 12 and 13. This chapter discusses the use of coding to control the statistics of the data symbols, thereby introducing a measure {{of control over the}} spectrum of the transmitted signal. For example, undesired correlations among information bits can be removed by scrambling, which is a reversible transformation of the bits in a way that affects the statistics. Alternatively, the spectrum can be controlled by introducing a controlled correlation among data symbols in the form of redundancy (the remaining sections). In Chapters 12 and 13 we saw applications of redundancy to the correction and prevention of channel errors. One way to control the spectrum is through the design of a line code (Sections 19. 2 and 19. 3). One major motivation in baseband systems is the problem of baseline wander introduced by the <b>a.</b> <b>c.</b> <b>coupling</b> inherent in transformers and broadband amplifiers. This phenomenon is described in Section 19. 1. In Section 19. 2 a number of different types of line codes for baseband systems are described, most of them oriented toward control of baseline wander...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{report the}} design of an ultra-low-power 32 -channel neural-recording {{integrated}} circuit (chip) in a 0. 18 m CMOS technology. The chip consists of eight neural recording modules where each module contains four neural amplifiers, an analog multiplexer, an A/D converter, and a serial programming interface. Each amplifier can be programmed to record either spikes or LFPs with a programmable gain from 49 – 66 dB. To min-imize the total power consumption, an adaptive-biasing scheme is utilized to adjust each amplifier’s input-referred noise to suit the background noise at the recording site. The amplifier’s input-re-ferred noise can be adjusted from 11. 2 (total power of 5. 4 W) down to 5. 4 (total power of 20 W) in the spike-recording setting. The ADC in each recording module digi-tizes the a. c. signal input to each amplifier at 8 -bit precision with a sampling rate of 31. 25 kS/s per channel, with an average power consumption of 483 nW per channel, and, because of <b>a.</b> <b>c.</b> <b>coupling,</b> allows d. c. operation over a wide dynamic range. It achieves an ENOB of 7. 65, resulting in a net efficiency of 77 fJ/State, {{making it one of}} the most energy-efficient designs for neural recording applications. The presented chip was successfully tested in an in vivo wireless recording experiment from a behaving primate with an average power dissipation per channel of 10. 1 W. The neural amplifier and the ADC occupy areas of 0. 03 mm and 0. 02 mm respectively, making our design simultaneously area efficient and power efficient, thus enabling scaling to high channel-count systems.

40|$|The {{effect of}} diarachidonin on the {{synthesis}} of prostaglandin E 2 in rabbit kidney medulla slices was examined. The addition of diarachidonin stimulated prostaglandin E 2 production in a dose-dependent manner. At three concentrations (10, 50 and 100 microM), increases in prostaglandin E 2 formation induced by exogenous diarachidonin were 2 -fold greater than those induced by exogenous arachidonic acid. Diacylglycerol or phosphatidic acid from egg lecithin {{had little or no}} effect on prostaglandin E 2 production. Moreover, EGTA failed to inhibit diarachidonin-stimulated prostaglandin E 2 formation, indicating that the stimulatory effect of diarachidonin is not mediated through the activation of endogenous phospholipase A 2 (including phosphatidic acid-specific phospholipase A 2).

Also, the simulation reveals that for reversible chemical reaction in the case of fixed domain size, the equilibrium of concentrations is established. In the cases of coupling between domain growth and reversible reaction kinetics, it is shown in simulations that the domain growth eventually freezes regardless of the magnitude of the reaction rate constants. The higher the reaction rate constants are, the slower the evolution to reach the reach steady state is, the larger the steady state domain size is, and the smaller the average concentration of species C is.

Plant C and microbial C were modelled simultaneously and the growth parameters of plants and nitrogen-fixing microorganisms were fitted to the data. All C exchanges were successfully predicted using the same weather correction for plant and microbial processes. Most of the photosynthetic production was allocated to the roots, reducing yields. The C losses were found modelled mainly by root respiration for cereals, probably as an energy source for nutrient explorings, and by root mortality for legumes as a growth source for decomposers and symbiotic nodules.

40|$|ATP and ADP, in {{concentrations}} {{ranging from}} 1 - 100 microM, increased {{the release of}} [3 H]choline and [3 H]phosphorylcholine (P-choline) from bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) prelabelled with [3 H]choline. This action was detectable within 5 minutes and was maintained for at least 40 minutes. ATP and ADP were equiactive, and their action was mimicked by their phosphorothioate analogs (ATP gamma S and ADP beta S) and adenosine 5 '-(beta, gamma imido) triphosphate (APPNP), but not by AMP, adenosine, and adenosine 5 '-(alpha, beta methylene) triphosphate (APCPP) : these {{results are consistent with}} the involvement of P 2 Y receptors. ATP also induced an intracellular accumulation of [3 H]choline: the intracellular level of [3 H]choline was increased 30 seconds after ATP addition and remained elevated for a least 20 minutes. The action of ATP on the release of choline metabolites was reproduced by bradykinin (1 microM), the tumor promoter phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA, 50 nM), and the calcium ionophore A 23187 (0. 5 microM). Down-regulation of protein kinase <b>C,</b> following <b>a</b> 24 -hour exposure of endothelial cells to PMA, abolished the effects of PMA and ATP on the release of choline and P-choline, whereas the response to A 23187 was maintained.

He characterizes those as lexical rules and transformational rules. The central case study he looks at is that of adjectival vs. verbal passive. The distribution of the prefix un- is evidence that some participles should be considered adjectives. Un- can attach to a participle and to an adjective, as in (1 a) and (1 b). The verb from which this participle is derived, however, cannot take the prefix (1 c). These facts can be explained if un- is constrained to combine with adjectives, and the participle in (1 a) is taken to be an adjective. However, there are contexts in which a participle can appear (2 a), but which exclude adjectives (2 b). (1) a. Her whereabouts may be unknown. b.

40|$|Igor Benko {{has used}} Java {{to craft a}} {{simulator}} for FLEET. It is event driven; i. e. it keeps a queue of Events and does them in time sequence. To “do ” an Event, the simulator calls a method, named execute(), in an instance of class Command associated with the Event. Different parts of the simulated structure have different subclasses of Command whose execute() methods do the required work. Executing a Command nearly always results in adding more Events to the queue to represent subsequent actions. The simulator uses three kinds of atoms to represent {{the elements of the}} FLEET system. For the moment I shall assign letters (<b>A,</b> B, <b>C)</b> but not names to these three kinds of things, they are: A) Things that can hold state to represent the values on wires or in registers B) Things that act on and modify those states, and C) Links between the two other types. The structure connects things of type A and type B by things of type <b>C.</b> <b>A</b> link (<b>C)</b> always associates one A with one B. Any trip through such a structure will enter these items in the sequence [...] . <b>A</b> <b>C</b> B <b>C</b> <b>A</b> <b>C</b> B C [...] . The links (C) solve what I think of as the “many-many ” problem. Each instance of type A can connect to an arbitrary number of instances of type B and each instance of type B can connect to an arbitrary number of instances of type A. Interposing <b>a</b> link (<b>C)</b> to <b>couple</b> type <b>A</b> objects and type B objects helps simplify the pointer structure. Each A knows only about the links (C) attached to it, and each B knows only about the links (C) attached to it. Each link (C) knows about exactly one A and one B. Notice the symmetry in this structure. Thinking of A and B as nodes and C as edges makes a bipartite graph. The nodes form two disjoint sub-sets and the edges connect a node from one sub-set to a node from the other sub-set. This view emphasizes the symmetry between A’s and B’s. _____________________________________________________________________________ This document is a product of a collaboration between Sun Microsystems and the University of California at Berkeley [...] The ideas contained herein are freely available for any academic purpose...|$|R
