5000|$|Following the {{preproduction}} run of 50 pieces, 200 {{cameras were}} made for use as advertising and testing samples. After 900 pieces of the regular models had been built {{by the end of}} 1966, in 1967 each month 1000 cameras were produced. Until August 1967 all Rollei 35 cameras got the unusual signature [...] "Made in Germany by Rollei - Compur - Gossen - Zeiss", but from then on it became [...] "Made in Germany by Rollei".Further deviations from the first production year were the plastic take-up reel and film rewind bearing, V-shaped grasp for the bottom lock and <b>anti-twist</b> plate for the film cartridge.In September 1968 a special lens cement prevented the previous UV permeability of the Tessar. A variant with a dark-green leather covering was rejected by the sales department, not wanting additional models just 2 years after the sales start. Another prototype with blank adjusting wheels from anodized aluminum proved too expensive to manufacture, however.|$|E

According to the forming principle of <b>anti-twist</b> wire rope, the structure and dimensional characteristics of wire rope are analyzed. Applying the differential geometry theory and principle of coordinate transformation, the spatial curve parametric equations were derived.

On the basis of this mathematical model,a YS 11 - 8 × 19 wire rope was taken as an example based on the spatial curve parametric equations, an geometric entity model of the <b>anti-twist</b> braided wire rope was established using the three-dimension software. Compared geometric model with actual <b>anti-twist</b> braided wire rope, errors of structure parameters are in the range of allowable error. The mathematic model's veracity is verified, which lay the foundation for finite element analysis of wire rope...|$|E
40|$|The twist gene is {{involved}} in the establishment of germ layers in Drosophila embryos: twist homozygous mutant embryos fail to form the ventral furrow at gastrulation and lack mesoderm and all internal organs. We have determined the sequence of the twist gene, that contains 'CAX' repeats in its 5 ' moiety, and codes for a protein of 490 amino acids. We have raised <b>anti-twist</b> antibodies that were used to study the distribution of the twist protein in whole mounts and tissue sections of wild-type embryos. Twist protein appears to be a nuclear protein at all developmental stages. It is present over both poles and in the midventral region (endoderm and mesoderm anlagen) at cellular blastoderm stage; later in development, it is detected within the mesodermal layer until its differentiation into somatopleura and splanchnopleura in which some cells are still labelled by <b>anti-twist</b> antibodies...|$|E

5000|$|Swing: The kettlebell swing (sometimes {{called the}} Russian swing to {{distinguish}} it from the American swing) is a basic ballistic exercise used to train the posterior chain {{in a manner similar}} to broad jumping. The kettlebell is swung from just below the groin to somewhere between the upper abdomen and shoulders, with arms nearly straight. The key to a good kettlebell swing is effectively thrusting the hips, not bending too much at the knees and sending the weight forwards, as opposed to squatting the weight up, or lifting up with the arms. This requires an intense contraction of the gluteal, abdominal and latissimus muscles. The swing can also be performed with a release and catch of the kettlebell, which helps train the proper swing pattern where the arms aren't pulling up at the top. This can be done with two hands switching to a supinated catch. The one-arm swing presents a significant <b>anti-twisting</b> challenge, and can be used with an alternating catch switching between arms. Further variations include the walking swing taking a step forward at the apex of each swing, the outside swing where the kettlebell swings outside the leg, and the kneeling swing, swinging between the legs in a one-leg half-kneeling position.|$|R

However, this method makes twisted tooth flanks on the hobbed work gear. Therefore, a variable pressure angle hob cutter is applied to obtain an <b>anti-twist</b> tooth flank of hobbed work gear. A computer simulation example is performed to verify {{the superiority of the}} proposed novel hobbing method by comparing topographies of the crowned work gear surfaces hobbed by a standard hob cutter and a variable pressure angle hob cutter...|$|E
40|$|Testing of {{axial load}} {{transfer}} of various Australian cable bolts {{has been conducted}} in overseas laboratories within {{the last two years}} (Thomas, 2012). The comparative laboratory testing determined that nutcaged cables and indented wire cables provide stiffer and higher capacity bond strength compared to plain cable. Laboratory studies have limitations in terms of rock strength and installation practice but have the benefit of controlling the type of load applied during the test. In situ cable bolt tests were conducted underground using common installation equipment, resin capsules instead of cementitious grout where relevant, and in a typical coal mine roof. In situ testing methods included <b>anti-twist</b> methodology similar to that used in laboratory tests...|$|E
40|$|CD 8 + T {{lymphocytes}} are key mediators of anti-tumour immunity, eliminating tumour cells {{through the}} recognition of tumour antigens. Increasing the number of characterised tumour antigens, especially those with highly specific tumour expression, may enable {{the development of more}} effective immunotherapy of cancers. TWIST 1 is a basic-helix-loop-helix transcription factor (bHLB) with an important role in cell lineage determination and differentiation. It is expressed by a number of carcinomas where it functions as a pro-metastatic oncogene, but is absent or expressed at low levels in normal tissues. The main aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether <b>anti-TWIST</b> 1 immune responses could be generated and used to target cancer cells. Two potential HLA-A 0201 restricted TWIST 1 -derived epitopes, SLNEAFAAL and KLAARYIDFL (referred to as SLN and KLA) were identified by in silico prediction methods and their binding to HLA-A* 0201 confirmed in vitro. The peptides were assessed for their capacity to induce specific immune responses by generating cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) lines from the peripheral blood of HLA-A 2 -positive healthy donors. SLN peptide-specific CTLs were detected in 1 out of 5 healthy donors by peptide/MHC class I pentamers and the CTL line generated showed specific cytotoxicity and the release of interferon-γ on recognition of T 2 target cells pulsed with SLN. KLA peptide-specific CTLs were not detected in the four healthy HLA-A 2 -positive donors tested. The immunogenicity of KLA was also assessed by peptide immunisation of HLA-A* 0201 transgenic mice and the in vitro stimulation of alloreactive peptide-specific CD 8 + T cells from HLA-A 2 -negative healthy blood donors. CTLs capable of specifically killing T 2 cells pulsed with KLA peptide were isolated from an alloreactive CTL bulk line using peptide/HLA-A* 0201 pentamer reagents and magnetic cell sorting. The data presented here shows the existence of functional <b>anti-TWIST</b> 1 CTL precursors within the autologous and allogeneic HLA-A* 0201 -restricted T cell repertoires of healthy donors, and therefore merits the further evaluation of SLN and KLA as target epitopes for the treatment of TWIST 1 + tumours...|$|E
40|$|Twist {{fields were}} {{introduced}} {{a few decades}} ago as a quantum counterpart to classical kink configurations and disorder variables in low dimensional field theories. In recent years they received a new incarnation within the framework of geometric entropy and strong coupling limit of four-dimensional scattering amplitudes. In this paper, we study their two-point correlation functions in a free massless scalar theory, namely, twist [...] twist and twist [...] <b>anti-twist</b> correlators. In spite of the simplicity of the model in question, the properties of the latter are far from being trivial. The problem is reduced, within the formalism of the path integral, to the study of spectral determinants on surfaces with conical points, which are then computed exactly making use of the zeta function regularization. We also provide an insight into twist correlators for a massive complex scalar by means of the Lifshitz-Krein trace formula. Comment: 21 pages, 2 figure...|$|E
40|$|Antibodies are {{indispensable}} reagents {{in basic}} research, and those raised against tags constitute {{a useful tool}} for the evaluation of the biochemistry and biology of novel proteins. In this paper, we describe the isolation and characterization of a single-domain recombinant antibody (VHH) specific for the SNAP-tag, using Twist 2 as a test-protein. The antibody was efficient in western blot, immunoprecipitation, immunopurification, and immunofluorescence. The sequence corresponding to the anti-SNAP has been subcloned for large-scale expression in vectors that allow its fusion to either a 6 xHis-tag or the Fc domain of rabbit IgG 2 taking advantage of a new plasmid that was specifically designed for VHH antibodies. The two different fusion antibodies were compared in immunopurification and immunofluorescence experiments, and the recombinant protein SNAP-Twist 2 was accurately identified by the anti-SNAP Fc-VHH construct in the nuclear/nucleolar subcellular compartment. Furthermore, such localization was confirmed by direct Twist 2 identification by means of anti-Twisit 2 VHH antibodies recovered after panning of the same naïve phage display library used to isolate the anti-SNAP binders. Our successful localization of Twist 2 protein using the SNAP-tag-based approach and the <b>anti-Twist</b> 2 -specific recombinant single-domain antibodies opens new research possibilities in this field...|$|E

40|$|Satellites {{must often}} point a device {{continuously}} at an object while the satellite and/or object move through space. With these devices, connections are typically {{made between the}} articulated device and a fixed base around which the device rotates {{in one or more}} axes while tracking. Implementing these connections can be a challenge in size constrained applications or when uninterrupted tracking is required. Within the small satellite realm, some new solutions (e. g., Canfield joint) have recently been developed to address this problem. Given the mass and volume constraints imposed upon CubeSats, the authors feel that none of the existing solutions solve the problem elegantly or efficiently. A new, simple two degree-of-freedom (2 -DOF) joint - the Hemispherical <b>Anti-Twist</b> Tracking System (HATTS) - is proposed that allows continuous tracking through a hemisphere with continuous rotation while avoiding any twist in the connection(s) from the device to the base. This design is notable for its simplicity and its ability to continuously rotate. The HATTS joint has a reduced component count and fewer interfaces between moving parts than other solutions, thereby potentially increasing pointing accuracy while lowering cost, mass and complexity. In the CubeSat-specific implementation (CubeHATTS), two identical motors are rigidly affixed to the chassis of the satellite and provide the two DOFs via a jointed elevation arm and dual coaxial gears operated either synchronously or differentially. CubeHATTS is able to track continuously through a hemisphere and when stowed, the entire system fits in a volume of approximately ¼ U (10 cm x 10 cm x 2. 8 cm) ...|$|E
40|$|Congenital {{heart disease}} {{can result from}} defects in heart cell {{differentiation}} and morphogenesis {{during the early stages}} of cardiac development. Importantly, differentiation of the correct number of cardiomyocytes during these early stages ensures the proper function of the heart, as too few or too many cells can lead to a dysfunctional organ. While a few transcription factors have been shown to have roles in promoting myocardial differentiation, our knowledge of the important regulators of this process is incomplete. Here, we show that a bHLH transcription factor, Twist 1 a, functions to limit the production of myocardial cells in the early embryo. Reducing the function of twist 1 a in zebrafish embryos with an <b>anti-twist</b> 1 a morpholino (MO) results in expanded expression of cmlc 2, a myocardial marker, suggesting a repressive role for Twist 1 a during myocardial differentiation. This role for Twist 1 a contrasts with that of Hand 2, a bHLH transcription factor that is known to promote myocardial differentiation. We show that reducing the function of twist 1 a in hand 2 hypomorphic mutants results in expanded cmlc 2 expression. However, hand 2 null mutants injected with the twist 1 a MO have no apparent increase in the expression of cmlc 2. The idea that the function of Twist 1 a in limiting myocardial differentiation is dependent upon the presence of Hand 2 supports our conclusion that the two transcription factors interact genetically during this process. Together, our findings suggest that the relative doses of Twist 1 a and Hand 2 {{play an important role in}} setting the scale for the amount of myocardial differentiation in the zebrafish embry...|$|E
