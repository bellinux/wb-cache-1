Outstanding examples of monumental bronzeworking of the period include the doors of the Palatine chapel (c.800) and the doors of the Marktportal of Mainz Cathedral, which Archbishop Willigis had the founder Berenger cast in 1009. However, these doors have no figural decoration, except for door handles in the shape of lion's heads on the Aachen Wolfstür. As his biographer Thangmar reported in the Vita Bernwardi, Bishop Bernward lived first in the Hostel of the Schola Francorum at the Vatican and then in the Imperial Palace on the Palatine during his stay at Rome in 1001/2. He would {{have had the opportunity to}} view the monumental bronze door at the entrance to Old St. Peter's. He probably also saw the Late Antique wooden doors of Santa Sabina with their relief cycle in which Old and New Testament scenes are <b>arranged</b> <b>opposite</b> each other in a typology. The Late Antique doors of Sant'Ambrogio in Milan are also a possible model.|$|E
2500|$|Kroehl {{applied for}} a patent around March 1854 for a flange forming machine. [...] It is {{described}} in Scientific American as an improvement in machinery for bending flanges on wrought iron beams. [...] There {{is a pair of}} horizontal, and a pair of vertical rollers; the former pair has one roller with a face of the full depth of the beam, and the other has its face the depth of the beam minus the thickness of the flanges. [...] The vertical rollers are both alike, and are of a width a little greater than the extreme width of the flanges. [...] They are <b>arranged</b> <b>opposite</b> the space between the horizontal ones, and work in close contact with the sides of the roller. [...] In order to give the flanges and their beams, a taper or an elliptic, or other curved form, the vertical rollers have flanges, whose faces bear on the edges of the flanges of the beam, and cause the said rollers to receive such a movement in the direction of their axes, and apply such a force I that direction as bends the flanges of the beam to the desired form. [...] Kroehl secured the patent as #12,133 on January 2, 1855.|$|E
60|$|At last a {{candidate}} was selected, whose nomination and whose consent {{to occupy the}} position created very great surprise in the London world. The press had of course taken up the matter very strongly. The 'Morning Breakfast Table' supported Mr Melmotte with all its weight. There were people who said that this support was given by Mr Broune {{under the influence of}} Lady Carbury, and that Lady Carbury in this way endeavoured to reconcile the great man to a marriage between his daughter and Sir Felix. But it is more probable that Mr Broune saw,--or thought that he saw,--which way the wind sat, and that he supported the commercial hero because he felt that the hero would be supported by the country at large. In praising a book, or putting foremost the merits of some official or military claimant, or writing up a charity,-- in some small matter of merely personal interest,--the Editor of the 'Morning Breakfast Table' might perhaps allow himself to listen to a lady whom he loved. But he knew his work too well to jeopardize his paper by such influences in any matter which might probably become interesting to the world of his readers. There was a strong belief in Melmotte. The clubs thought that he would be returned for Westminster. The dukes and duchesses fêted him. The city,--even the city was showing a wavering disposition to come round. Bishops begged for his name on the list of promoters of their pet schemes. Royalty without stint was to dine at his table. Melmotte himself was to sit at the right hand of the brother of the Sun and of the uncle of the Moon, and British Royalty was to be <b>arranged</b> <b>opposite,</b> so that every one might seem to have the place of most honour. How could a conscientious Editor of a 'Morning Breakfast Table,' seeing how things were going, do other than support Mr Melmotte? In fair justice it may be well doubted whether Lady Carbury had exercised any influence in the matter.|$|E

Two vertical sight apertures are <b>arranged</b> <b>opposite</b> each other and can be rotated along the graduated arc of the horizontal table.

5000|$|The Yankee Doodle Coffee Shop, {{also known}} as The Doodle, was a diner in New Haven, Connecticut that catered to the Yale University {{community}} for 58 years before closing on January 28, 2008.

Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Henry Winkler are said to have been regulars during their times at Yale. The Doodle was known for its cheap but excellent food, especially the fried donut—an old fashioned donut cut down the middle, buttered, fried on the grill, and then re-buttered before serving. Other unique items popular with students included; the Bacon Egg and Cheese [...] "No Break," [...] The Doodle Dandy, and a variety of grilled muffins.|$|E
5000|$|The {{station was}} {{designed}} by the British electrical engineering consultants, Merz & McLellan. The station's design set the pattern for power station layout and design {{for most of the}} early twentieth century, as it was the first in the world to use the [...] "unit system" [...] of layout, whereby each boiler and turbine generating set is directly connected electrically to an alternator, and can work independently from any other generating unit in the station. This system has remained popular throughout the twentieth century and into the twenty-first century. The station's boiler houses and turbine hall were of steel frame construction clad with corrugated iron, with the boiler houses built at right angles to the turbine hall. Each of the three boiler houses had its own chimney. This layout allowed for long lengths of steam-piping to be avoided, and for each battery of boilers to be <b>arranged</b> <b>opposite</b> the generating set which it feeds in the turbine hall.|$|E
50|$|Clytostoma was a genus of woody-stemmed vines from {{tropical}} America, {{native to}} Argentina {{and the southern}} part of Brazil. It is now considered a synonym of Bignonia. The botanical name comes from the Greek, klytos means splendid or beauteous, and stoma means mouth; alluding to the beautiful flowers. It is closely related to Bignonia, from which it differs chiefly in its simple slender tendrils, the short disk, and that it has a habit of clambering over adjacent foliage using tendrils to hang on tight. The bright glossy green leaves are lobed and divided with 2 leaflets, about 3in (7.6cm) long and 1.5in (3.8cm) wide. They are <b>arranged</b> <b>opposite</b> in pairs and tendrils arise at the ends of the leaf stalks. In late spring, the spectacular 1.5in (3.8cm) trumpet flowers are borne terminally or along the branches. The flowers are pale lavender and delicately detailed with dark violet and purple veins. Flowers are followed by large prickly seed pods. This evergreen ornamental plant easily reaches to 16 feet and is a carefree grower. It has only recently been moved out of the genus Pandorea.|$|E
50|$|The tubular flowers can be lavender, blue, white, pink, or lilac, {{and spotted}} with tiny lavender-purple dots. The flowers {{are located in}} verticillasters grouped on spikes; or the verticillasters are <b>arranged</b> in <b>opposite</b> cymes, racemes, or panicles - toward {{the tip of the}} stems.|$|R
50|$|They {{are large}} trees growing to 35 m tall, with pinnate leaves with {{four to eight}} leaflets; unlike most genera in the Juglandaceae, the leaves are <b>arranged</b> in <b>opposite</b> pairs. The fruit is a small nut about 1 cm diameter, with a {{three-lobed}} wing.|$|R
50|$|Verticordia lehmannii is {{a slender}} shrub with few side-branches which grows to {{a height of}} 30-75 cm and a width of 10-30 cm. Its leaves are <b>arranged</b> in <b>opposite</b> pairs and are {{elliptic}} to oblong in shape, roughly triangular in cross-section and 2-5 mm long.|$|R
