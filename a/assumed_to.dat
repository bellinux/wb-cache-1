5|$|Kepler-4b's {{discovery}} was announced on January 4, 2010. It {{is the size}} of planet Neptune, at 0.077 MJ (7% the mass of Jupiter) and 0.357 RJ (36% the radius of Jupiter). The planet orbits its star every 3.214 days at 0.045 AU from the star. This distance compares to planet Mercury, which is 0.39 AU from the Sun. Kepler-4's eccentricity was <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> be 0, however a subsequent independent reanalysis of the discovery data found a value of 0.25 ± 0.12. Likewise, the temperature of the planet is <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> be 1650 K, far hotter than Jupiter's, which is <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> be 124 K (not considering its internal heat and atmosphere).|$|E
