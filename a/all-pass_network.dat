40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to implement monolithic analog phase shifters based on barium strontium titanate (BST) coated sapphire substrates for IEEE 802. 11 b wireless local area network (WLAN) applications. It has been known that several BST thin film properties such as high relative permittivity, electric field dependence, fast polarization response, relatively low loss, and high breakdown field, allow for miniaturization and high performance of analog phase shifters. Before attempting to implement BST phase shifters, coplanar waveguides (CPWs) and interdigital capacitors (IDCs) based on various BST compositions and thicknesses have been developed and characterized to capitalize on the electrical properties of BST thin films. Based on the characteristics of BST thin films, two design topologies have been studied to implement phase shifters. The first topology is a reflection-type structure. The reflection-type phase shifter composed of a 3 -dB coupler and two identical reflective terminations has provided a large phase shift with a relatively low insertion loss. The second topology is an <b>all-pass</b> <b>network</b> structure. The <b>all-pass</b> <b>network</b> phase shifter consists of only lumped elements so that one can shrink in size of devices. The total chip area of the <b>all-pass</b> <b>network</b> phase shifter is only 2. 6 mm * 2. 2 mm with a loss figure-of-merit (FOM) of more than 69 deg/dB at 2. 4 GHz. This is the smallest size and the best performance obtained to date for BST phase shifters in the 2. 4 GHz band and comparable or even better than the state of the GaAs MMIC phase shifters. The nonlinear response of the <b>all-pass</b> <b>network</b> phase shifter also was investigated with two-tone intermodulation distortion (IMD) measurement. Furthermore, the <b>all-pass</b> <b>network</b> phase shifter was studied to ascertain a design to ensure minimum performance variation over a range of temperature and to determine which BST composition performed best in the face of temperature variations. Compact beamforming networks (BFNs) for WLAN systems using client-based smart antennas have been demonstrated to validate the feasibility of BST technology for WLAN applications. The two-element BFNs have been shown to increase throughput and network capacity by rejecting interference. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Kenney, J.

Due to effective utilization of the phase-shift method, the hybrid-method has a significant advantage in the low audio frequency range and helps the burdens of the demodulation process.

This network consists of transversally cascaded C-sections, which are distributed implementations of the bridged-T equalizer lumped circuit. It is obtained by interconnecting the alternate ports of adjacent {{lines of a}} 2 N -port coupled transmission line network with transmission line sections, and it is modeled using multiconductor transmission line theory with per-unit-length capacitance matrix C and inductance matrix L. By allowing the different C-sections of the network to exhibit different lengths, a generalized group-delay engineering procedure is proposed, where quasi-arbitrary group-delay responses are achieved by combining the group-delay responses of C-sections with different lengths. A computer design approach based on genetic algorithms is applied for synthesis, which consists of determining the structural parameters of the different C-section groups. Using this approach, noncommensurate networks are group-delay engineered in edge-coupled stripline technology, and Gaussian, linear and quadratic group-delay responses are realized.

40|$|Tunability, reconfigurability, and {{adaptability}} for RF {{and microwave}} circuits are highly desirable because {{they not only}} enhance the functionality and performance but also reduce the circuit size and cost. This thesis studies impedance matching circuits that adapt themselves based on either transmit power level or operating environment, targeting the realization of high performance intelligent RF front-ends. Specifically, this study {{is divided into two}} distinct topics: (a) linear and efficient power amplifiers (PAs) using tunable matching networks (TMNs) that are dynamically controlled according to the instantaneous power level, and (b) adaptive matching systems based on impedance tuning units to automatically compensate the impedance variation of an antenna. The tuning elements used for implementing the adaptive impedance matching circuits include both semiconductor and ferroelectric varactors. To use the intrinsically nonlinear ferroelectric materials in wireless transceivers with stringent linearity requirements, a technique for improving the linearity of the ferroelectric varactors is proposed and implemented. Up to 16 dB improvement on IIP 3 is demonstrated. A study of the tradeoff between the quality factor and tuning speed for the linearized varactors is conducted. Subsequently, two specific applications are investigated. First, a PA with a diode-based TMN is designed, fabricated, and tested. The TMN is dynamically controlled according to the instantaneous power level such that not only optimum load is provided but the AM-AM and AM-PM distortions of the PA are reduced, for the first time demonstrating both efficiency enhancement and linearity improvement using TMNs. Measurement results show that a 13 % reduction in DC power consumption is achieved under the same linearity constraint. Second, a closed-loop system is proposed for adaptively performing impedance matching to an unknown load. The adaptive matching system is composed of an impedance tuner, an impedance sensor, and peripheral control circuitries. The impedance tuner, consisting of a phase shifter and a variable transformer, is a novel implementation using an <b>all-pass</b> <b>network</b> topology.
