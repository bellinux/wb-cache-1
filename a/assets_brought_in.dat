He netted more than €300 million from that sale but paid no capital gains tax due to a then-existing provision in the Irish-Portuguese tax treaty. While considering the flotation of Digicel on the New York Stock Exchange in 2006, it emerged in public that O'Brien had taken up residence in Malta.

On the 11th hour, former President Jimmy Carter negotiated {{a deal with}} the Haitian leaders that permitted U.S. forces to go in unopposed. The changed entry situation immediately pushed CA activities to the front in terms of the immediate requirements to repair the run-down Haitian infrastructure. CA soldiers attached to the Rangers were quickly reattached to 3rd SFG units for this reason. Additional CA <b>assets</b> were <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> from various CA Reserve commands to meet the rapid expansion of the CA role.The most far reaching Civil Affairs project to take shape was Operation LIGHT SWITCH, a campaign to restore limited electrical power to major urban areas outside of Port-au-Prince and Cap Haitian. Some areas had been without electricity for nearly 3 years. On 26 September 1994, the 96th CA Bn was given the responsibility for the organization and execution of the operation. The first real problem was a legal one, namely how the project could be funded. Regulations state that Title X funding can be used for such projects if they were “dominimus” in nature. This is defined as being within the scope of what a squad of soldiers working a day could accomplish at no more than $1000 in cost. The scope of the project easily exceeded that. The JAG section quickly drafted a message and sent it forward to the Department of State. In less than 6 hours, a reply arrived clearing the way for the mission to commence.|$|R

40|$|The {{personal}} brand {{derives from}} the marketing brand, and argues that a person can take control over other people’s perceptions about him or her. The personal brand can benefit the person {{but it can also}} give advantages to his or her company. The interest in, and the purpose of the personal brand, has increased the last ten years. Leaders of large companies in Sweden consider it to be of utmost importance to have an influence on their co-workers. They consider their personal brand to be advantageous in their practice of leadership. The leaders personal values are the foundation of the identity in their personal brands. The values of their personal brand should reflect the values of their company because it helps building an organisational culture in accordance with the companies’ values.  The personal brand has many advantages and {{the purpose of this paper}} is to focus on the values of the personal brand and what it can contribute to their company. To focus on the personal brand we also want to create understandings and dissect its constituents, image and identity.  To do so we refer to the model by Kapferer (2008) the "identity prism", where the brand consists of six parts. This paper is a qualitative research with a deductive approach. We interviewed four business leaders from four different large companies in Sweden. This paper argues that the personal brand of business leaders has a great effect and influence on the organisational culture, which is made up by the co-workers together with the leader. Furthermore, great <b>assets</b> are <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> to the organization depending on how well the leader makes use of his personal brand.

40|$|This paper investigates how {{the control}} and {{devolution}} of productive assets are allocated among husband and wife. Theory predicts that bargaining power within marriage depends on the division of assets upon divorce (exit option) and on control over assets during marriage (noncooperative marriage). In empirical applications, bargaining power is typically proxied by variables such as dowry payments, <b>assets</b> <b>brought</b> to marriage, and ownership of assets within marriage. Using detailed household data from rural Ethiopia, we show that <b>assets</b> <b>brought</b> to marriage, ownership of assets, control within marriage, and disposition upon death or divorce are only partly related (strictly speaking, surveyed households do not "own" land since all agricultural land is legally owned by the state). In rural Ethiopia, control over productive resources is centralized {{into the hands of}} the household head, be it a man or a woman, irrespective of ownership at or after marriage. Disposition upon death or divorce only loosely depends on individual ownership during marriage but control over assets is associated with larger claims over these assets upon divorce, a finding consistent with the presence of incentive problems. <b>Assets</b> <b>brought</b> into marriage have little impact on disposition upon death, but matter in case of divorce. iii CONTENTS Acknowledgments [...] . v 1...|$|R
