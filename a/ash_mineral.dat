There were significant differences in tree growth, foliar {Delta}, {delta} 18 O and <b>ash</b> <b>mineral</b> nutrient concentration among the eight clones tested. Significant negative linear relationships existed between tree growth and {Delta}, extrapolating to zero growth at {Delta} = 24 – 30 {per thousand}.

Foliar {delta} 18 O, <b>ash</b> <b>mineral</b> nutrient concentration and foliar nutrient concentration were unrelated to tree growth. In the F 1 hybrid pine clones, variation in tree WUE, as reflected by {Delta}, was largely attributed to a genetic effect on leaf photosynthetic capacity rather than on stomatal conductance, as reflected by foliar {delta} 18 O...|$|E

The genotypes used were Poll Dorset growth × Border Leicester Merino (PDg × BLM), Poll Dorsetgrowth × Merino (PDg × M), Poll Dorsetmuscling × Merino (PDm × M), Merino × Merino (M × M) and Border Leicester × Merino (BL × M). Approximately 150 mixed sex animals were slaughtered at each {{age and the}} right sides (half carcass) were scanned by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) for chemical lean, fat and bone mineral percentages of the carcass. Carcass lean percentage decreased (P 0. 1) between PDg × M and PDm × M in either chemical lean or fat percentages at any age but <b>ash</b> <b>mineral</b> percentage was higher in the PDg × M genotype at older ages (P < 0. 05). This in turn led to differences in chemical lean:ash mineral content at later ages between PDg × M and PDm × M. Wethers had higher chemical lean (P < 0. 05) and lower fat (P < 0. 05) percentages in the carcass than ewes at all ages but <b>ash</b> <b>mineral</b> and chemical lean:ash mineral content did not differ between sexes.

Those genotypes that reach a specification at younger ages will be more productive for meat production. Purebred Merino genetics will always be less productive in terms of carcass weight and muscle related productive traits (loin weight, semitendinosus muscle weight, eye muscle area) than BL and PD genetics, but the relative productivity of PD and BL genetics will depend on the traits used in the specification [see also Ponnampalam EN, Hopkins DL, Butler KL, Dunshea FR, Warner RD (2007) Genotype and age effects on sheep meat production. 2.

Hence improved understanding of these interactions may have implications for the campaign life of the blast furnace hearth refractory materials. The interactions between the coke <b>ash</b> <b>minerals</b> and aluminosilicate hearth refractory have been assessed by heating samples of calcium aluminates (CA, CA 2 2 ̆ 6 CA 6) coupled with aluminosilicate refractory to temperatures representative of the blast furnace hearth (1450 degrees C to 1550 degrees C) in an inert atmosphere over a range of reaction times (4 - 24 hours).
