5|$|In {{commemoration}} of Pancake Day in the United Kingdom, a novelty pancake machine {{was built by}} The Happy Egg Company in February 2013 that involved a complex series of steps to automatically produce pancakes from scratch. The machine {{involves the use of}} a freshly laid egg from <b>a</b> <b>hen</b> that rolls onto a turntable, which then moves the egg to an area where it is automatically cracked and mixed with other ingredients. After this point, the mixture is poured into a griddle, flipped to cook the other side, and then flipped onto a plate.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{influence}} of feeding supplemental vitamin C was determined on dietary protein level and upon protein patterns of serum and egg albumen and on egg quality from hens {{of different ages}} and strains. One-year-old Single Comb White Leghorn (S. C. W. L.) strain <b>A</b> <b>hens</b> {{were randomly assigned to}} either a 15 % protein basal layer ration with or without a 3300 p. p. m. vitamin C supplement. Two-, four- and seven-year-old S. C. W. L. strain <b>A</b> <b>hens</b> and two-year old S. C. W. L. strain B hens were assigned to either a 15 % or an 18 % protein diet with or without supplementation of 1322 p. p. m. vitamin C. Egg production was significantly (P < 0. 05) decreased in two-year-old strain <b>A</b> <b>hens</b> when vitamin C was included in the 18 % protein diet but significantly (P < 0. 05) increased egg production was obtained from seven-year-old strain <b>A</b> <b>hens.</b> Adding vitamin C to the 15 % protein ration fed to two-year-old strain B and seven-year-old strain <b>A</b> <b>hens,</b> egg weight was significantly (P < 0. 05) increased. Haugh units of eggs from two-year-old strain <b>A</b> and B <b>hens</b> were significantly (P < 0. 05) increased when vitamin C was included in the 15 % protein ration. Adding vitamin C to the 18 % protein ration significantly (P < 0. 05) decreased Haugh units of eggs from two- and seven-year-old strain <b>A</b> <b>hens.</b> Shell thickness was significantly (P < 0. 01) improved by supplementing two-year-old strain B hens fed the 15 % protein ration with vitamin C. Egg dry matter percent was significantly (P < 0. 05) increased in eggs obtained from two-year-old strain B and seven-year-old strain <b>A</b> <b>hens</b> when vitamin C was added to the 15 % protein ration. Egg dry matter percent was also significantly (P < 0. 05) increased in eggs obtained from two-year-old strain <b>A</b> <b>hens</b> when vitamin C was added to the 18 % protein ration. Total calculated albumen protein was significantly (P < 0. 01) increased in two-year-old strain B and seven-year-old strain <b>A</b> <b>hens</b> when vitamin C was incorporated into the 15 % protein diet...|$|R

5|$|Newly hatched Aylesbury ducklings are timid {{and thrive}} best in small groups, so the duckers would divide them into {{groups of three}} or four ducklings, each {{accompanied}} by <b>a</b> <b>hen.</b> As the ducklings grew older and gained confidence, they would be kept in groups of around 30.

5|$|Silkies lay a {{fair number}} of eggs, of a cream color, but {{production}} is often interrupted due to their extreme tendency to go broody; <b>a</b> <b>hen</b> will produce 100 eggs in an ideal year. Their capacity for incubation, which has been selectively bred out of most fowl bred especially for egg production, is often exploited by poultry keepers by allowing Silkies to raise the offspring of other birds. In addition to being good mothers, Silkies are universally renowned for their calm, friendly temperament. They do well in confinement, and interact very well with children. This docility can cause Silkies to be bullied by more active or aggressive birds when kept in mixed flocks.|$|E

Janine meets a man named Richard Monroe (Andrew Hall), who settles her bill. Impressed by his car, Janine leaves with him. Worried about her son Phil (Steve McFadden) because of his addiction to the drug crack cocaine, Peggy enlists the help of Minty Peterson (Cliff Parisi) and Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick) to abduct him from the flat he is living in.

5|$|Andriamampandry {{tried on}} several {{occasions}} to warn Andriamasinavalona {{of the danger of}} administering the kingdom in this way. In one instance, he placed <b>a</b> <b>hen</b> {{in the middle of a}} room, then set one red rooster free in each corner. The roosters attacked one another viciously, leaving the king speechless. On another day, the elder brought four eagles to the king in a basket. When the basket was opened, the eagles flew wildly about the room, creating havoc. Andriamampandry warned the king that his realm would be no better off once his four sons got a taste of power. Andriamasinavalona recognized the danger but could not bear to choose which among his sons should be excluded from having a part in the decision-making responsibilities of the kingdom, so ignored the elder's advice. Finally Andriamampandry decided to give the king a very explicit warning. Andriamasinavalona had gathered his people in Andohalo to give a speech, when Andriamampandry set a bull loose into the crowd. In the panic that ensued, numerous people were gored or trampled to death, several pregnant women miscarried, and the gathering dispersed in chaos. The king demanded to know who had loosed the bull so that he may be executed, but when Andriamampandry took responsibility he warned the king that yet more blood would be spilled before the earth would be quenched. He then criticized the king for his concern over the relatively few deaths at the gathering, in light of the number of people who would die as a consequence of his division of Imerina. He further predicted that the prince at Ambohimanga would unite Imerina and lead it back to greatness. Andriamasinavalona reportedly had no response to give Andriamampandry, but instead hung his head in shame.|$|E

25|$|Females, {{known as}} hens, are {{attracted}} to the males' displays. <b>A</b> <b>hen</b> will fly in and land on the ground near a singing male.

The male woodcock plays no role in selecting a nest site, incubating eggs, or rearing young. In the primary northern breeding range, the woodcock may be the earliest ground-nesting species to breed.|$|E

25|$|In one {{variant of}} the {{practice}} of Kapparot, the item to be donated to charity is a rooster. In this case, the rooster would be swung overhead while still alive.
