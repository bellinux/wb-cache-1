5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration noted {{the drug was}} being used recreationally in California. It also {{reported}} that BZP was being used as an <b>adulterant</b> in illicit drugs. Not long after, {{there was an explosion}} in the drug's use worldwide – a situation which was soon followed by legislative control in many countries. Since 1999, benzylpiperazine use grew sharply in New Zealand due to an initial complete lack of regulation. The New Zealand government attempted to ban the product as of 18 December 2007, but the necessary second reading of the bill did not happen in time for the law to be passed. It was so widely used that an estimated 5 million pills were sold in New Zealand in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Piperazine-based stimulants {{began to}} appear in Europe in 2000 but {{remained}} virtually unavailable {{in the rest of the}} world until recently. In early 2006, pills containing the active ingredients BZP and TFMPP {{began to appear}} in the city of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, where they first gained popularity with late night party-goers as a purported safer alternative to many of the illicit street drugs commonly available there. In 2007 piperazine based party-pill formulations started to become widely available nationwide which has caused concern with local authorities such as Health Canada and subsequently BZP has gained much media attention in 2008. In the United States, it is still used as an <b>adulterant</b> in ecstasy mimic tablets.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 12th century, many {{critics of the}} {{examination}} system and government-run schools initiated a movement to revive private academies. During {{the course of the}} Southern Song, the academy became a viable alternative to the state school system. Even those that were semi-private or state-sponsored were still seen as independent of the state's influence and their teachers uninterested in larger, nationwide issues. One of the earliest academic institutions established in the Song period was the Yuelu Academy, founded in 976 during the reign of Emperor Taizu (r. 960–976). The Chinese scientist and statesman Shen Kuo was once the head chancellor of the Hanlin Academy, established during the Tang dynasty. The Neo-Confucian Donglin Academy, established in 1111, was founded upon the staunch teaching that <b>adulterant</b> influences of other ideologies such as Buddhism should not influence the teaching of their purely Confucian school. This belief hearkened back to the writings of the Tang essayist, prose stylist, and poet Han Yu (768–824), who was certainly a critic of Buddhism and its influence upon Confucian values. Although the White Deer Grotto Academy of the Southern Tang (937–976) had fallen out of use during the early half of the Song, the Neo-Confucian philosopher Zhu Xi (1130–1200) reinvigorated it.|$|E

30|$|In {{addition}} to the seven common peaks, two more peaks (tR =  2.37 and 3.18 min) were observed in 24 samples including “Long-Dan” and its <b>adulterants</b> (G. purdomii and G. microdonta) (Fig.  4 B). The peak at tR =  21.0  min identified as 2 ′-(o,m-dihydroxybenzyl)sweroside (5) was observed in all the 16 samples of G. rigescens (S 1 –S 16). The similarity of all the 24 samples of “Long-Dan” and its <b>adulterants</b> was between 0.939 and 0.996. The HPLC fingerprint chromatograms at 254  nm of “Long-Dan” [G. rigescens (S 1), G. scabra (S 17), G. triflora (S 18)], and its <b>adulterants,</b> G. purdomii (S 23) and G. microdonta (S 26) were shown in Fig.  5. As the major components, loganic acid (1), swertiamarinin (2), gentiopicroside (3), and sweroside (4) were found in all the species. Three characteristic peaks including 2 ′-(o,m-dihydroxybenzyl)sweroside (5) and peaks d–e were all detected in two “Long-Dan” <b>adulterants,</b> G. purdomii (S 20 –S 23, Fig.  5 H) and G. microdonta (S 26, Fig.  5 I).

40|$|Traditionally, the {{authentication}} of {{the traditional}} Chinese medicines (TCM), Angelica sinensis, is based on slightly different morphological characters and complex compounds. Usually, those methods are simultaneously affected by several factors, leading to subtle and ambiguous results. In this study, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of A. sinensis and seven other Angelica species used as <b>adulterants</b> were sequenced. A pair of specific primers was designed from the polymorphic ITS regions to distinguish A. sinensis from the <b>adulterants</b> and regional substitutes. These ITS-derived primers amplified approximately 520 bp specific fragments from the <b>adulterants,</b> whereas no products was amplified with the DNA of A. sinensis. We tested eight commercially crude materials purchased in the market by using these specific primers. The result showed that there were four samples adulterating A. sinensis with regional substitutes. This indicated that A. sinensis could be accurately distinguished from the <b>adulterants</b> and regional substitutes. Therefore, the method of molecular authentication based on the ITS sequences may be contributed to raw material production and quality control of A. sinensis...|$|R

Fortunately, the amount added was not high enough to be toxic except at impossibly high (for most people) levels of consumption (one would have needed to ingest about 28 bottles per day for approximately two weeks in order to suffer fatal effects). Twenty-three people died in 1986 because a fraudulent winemaker in Italy blended toxic methanol (wood alcohol) into his low-alcohol wine to increase its alcohol content.|$|E
500|$|Juniper berries, {{including}} Juniperus phoenicea and Juniperus oxycedrus {{have been}} found in ancient Egyptian tombs at multiple sites. J. oxycedrus is not known to grow in Egypt, and neither is Juniperus excelsa, which was found along with J. oxycedrus in the tomb of Tutankhamun. The berries imported into Egypt may have come from Greece; the Greeks record using juniper berries as a medicine long before mentioning their use in food. The Greeks used the berries in many of their Olympics events because of their belief that the berries increased physical stamina in athletes. The Romans used juniper berries as a cheap domestically produced substitute for the expensive black pepper and long pepper imported from India. It was also used as an <b>adulterant,</b> as reported in Pliny the Elder's Natural History: [...] "Pepper is adulterated with juniper berries, which have the property, to a marvellous degree, of assuming the pungency of pepper." [...] Pliny also incorrectly asserted that black pepper grew on trees that were [...] "very similar in appearance to our junipers".|$|E

40|$|Gekko gecko, {{an animal}} {{used as a}} valued {{traditional}} Chinese medicine, has been widely used for over 2000 years. Due to localized habitat destruction, the amount of G. gecko has dramatically decreased in recent years. As a result, more and more <b>adulterants</b> have been detected in the traditional medicine, which {{has resulted in a}} chaotic market. Therefore, a correct identification method is badly needed. In this study, we employed a new molecular method of DNA barcoding for discriminating gecko from its <b>adulterants.</b> Fifty-seven specimens of gecko and its <b>adulterants</b> were collected as test samples. The full-barcode and mini-barcode sequences of these specimens were separately amplified and sequenced separately. Together with other published barcode sequences, we detected that the intra-specific sequence diversity was far lower than the inter-specific diversity in G. gecko and its <b>adulterants</b> (3 % compared with 35 % in full-length barcode; 4 % compared with 33. 5 % in mini-barcode). These results showed that both the full-length and mini-barcodes were effective for identifying gecko, which suggested that the DNA barcode could be an effective and powerful tool for identifying the Chinese crude drug gecko.

2500|$|Anti-drug {{educators}} frequently {{tell their}} students some variant {{on the theme}} of inevitable strychnine poisoning through LSD use, for example, that strychnine is commonly sold as a cheaper substitute for LSD by unscrupulous drug dealers; that strychnine is a byproduct of LSD synthesis; that the body produces strychnine as a result of LSD metabolism; or that strychnine is used as a preservative to prevent the otherwise natural, rapid decomposition of LSD, allowing it to be stored; or that strychnine is somehow necessary to bond LSD to blotter paper. None of this is true. These claims may even be believed and propagated by drug users themselves. In reality, most hallucinogens cause some degree of mental or physical discomfort after the [...] "trip" [...] is over. This is an indirect effect of the drug, not strychnine or any other <b>adulterant.</b> Additionally, strychnine {{is one of the most}} bitter substances known.

40|$|Saffron (Crocus sativus L.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} and expensive medicinal spice products in the world. Because of its high market value and premium price, saffron is often adulterated through the incorporation of other materials, such as Carthamus tinctorius L. and Calendula officinalis L. flowers, Hemerocallis L. petals, Daucus carota L. fleshy root, Curcuma longa L. rhizomes, Zea may L., and Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn. stigmas. To develop a straightforward, nonsequencing method for rapid, sensitive, and discriminating detection of these <b>adulterants</b> in traded saffron, we report here the application of a barcoding melting curve analysis method (Bar-MCA) that uses the universal chloroplast plant DNA barcoding region trnH-psbA to identify <b>adulterants.</b> When amplified at DNA concentrations and annealing temperatures optimized for the curve analysis, peaks were formed at specific locations for saffron (81. 92 °C) and the adulterants: D. carota (81. 60 °C), C. tinctorius (80. 10 °C), C. officinalis (79. 92 °C), Dendranthema morifolium (Ramat.)
