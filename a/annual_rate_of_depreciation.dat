40|$|The paper {{shows that}} during the global {{economic}} crisis the urgency of industrial substantiated estimation of production costs and services (collectively, the product) of each type and the total for a given period {{in the framework of}} accounting and tax accounting has increased. So, for flexible management of prices and range of products the company has to determine with sufficient accuracy the cost of each product. Profitable enterprises in the tax records have the opportunity due to extensive use in Ukraine and other countries the systems of accelerated depreciation during the first years or all over the amortization period to inflate artificially the amount of depreciation compared with the actual rate of deterioration of labour. This causes allowed by the law overstating in tax accounting (compared with the balance one) the cost of sales of all types in a given period, and therefore understating taxable income and income taxes. However, there are problems in theoretical and methodological support. The changes in the regulatory assessment of the cost of industrial enterprises production of Ukraine for a long-term period are analyzed. Recommendations as for improving the scientific and methodological approach to assessing the cost of industrial and engineering products in terms of determining depreciation are substantiated. The author gives reasons for the necessity to exclude "method to reduce the residual value" both from Accounting Standard 7 and the Tax Code, and introduce a method of the same name, but in the interpretation of IFRS (IAS) 16, which is completely different. It not only replaces the "rapid method for reducing the residual value", but provides ample additional features of accelerated depreciation. On a digital sample it is shown that as for the liquidation value of the Tax Code does not have any restrictions, one can choose a value at which the <b>annual</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>depreciation</b> will be higher by 20 and 50 %, than the method of rapid reduction of the residual value can give at the same value of the minimal term object usage or amortization period. This method is not available in the IFRS (IAS) 16, and entirely different in effect but the same-name method is used in it. This method does not provide any advantages in terms of Accounting Standard 7. And the need of further improvement of the regulatory framework for accounting the production costs of industrial enterprises {{in the context of the}} range is emphasized...|$|E

40|$|Finally in Figure 6 we {{vary the}} <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>depreciation</b> in the X sector. The key role of this {{parameter}} is in affecting the desired capital {{stock in the}} X sector following reform since a very low <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>depreciation</b> for example would mean that if the X sector has expanded it will suffer a prolonged period of low returns if reversal occurs since the sectoral capital stock will depreciate (and thereby raise the return to capital) only slowly.

30|$|Comparing the SLX and the SDEM {{frameworks}} {{with one}} another, {{we conclude that}} based on the lower AIC index, the SLX models are preferred over the SDEM models. Between the two SLX models reported in Table  2, {{the closeness of the}} AICs does not favor one model over the other, so that either model results—using Euclidean or network distances—would be valid. For the remainder of this section, we will rely on the SLX model results using network distances. The impacts of structural, neighborhood, and locational characteristics on the market values are all consistent prior expectations. Our average house in the study area has a market value of $ 383, 571 and is 7859 feet (2395  m) away from its closest trail entrance. As expected, the structural characteristics of houses considerably affect their values. Increasing the lot size by one acre adds 5.5 % to a property’s market value, which translates into $ 21, 254 for our average house valued at $ 383, 571. A one square foot (square meter) increase in building size is worth a 0.02 % or $ 92 (0.066 % or $ 302) value increase and an additional bedroom a 3.9 % ($ 14, 922) increase in value, both dollar values in parenthesis referring to our averagely priced house. Older houses decrease in value by 1.3 % ($ 5102); however, the age-specific <b>annual</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> house value <b>depreciation</b> is 0.0058 % as indicated by the positive agesquared coefficient. Given the large magnitude of the fireplace coefficient, i.e., 8.3 % ($ 31, 744), one must interpret its value added with extreme caution. Here, we assert that the fireplace coefficient also serves as a proxy for other non-included structural characteristics, such as basement garage, heating, or air conditioning. The condition of a house is an important critical factor when determining its value. For this study, we use a total of seven distinct condition ratings (very poor, poor, average, good, very good, excellent), with very poor condition (condverypoor) being the worst, and excellent condition (condexcellent) being the best condition. To avoid perfect collinearity, we dropped the average house condition (condaverage) from our empirical models. As a result, the constant term of 10.822423 now represents a house in average condition, meaning that it contributes e 10.822423 [*]=[*]$ 50, 132 to its values. Accordingly, houses in better than average condition are worth more and houses in worse than average condition are worth less. For instance, for a house to be in good condition adds e 10.892577 [*]=[*]$ 53, 7768 to its value. In other words, comparing a house in good condition is worth $ 3643 more than a house in average condition. And houses in very good and in excellent condition are worth $ 7706 and $ 13, 940  more, respectively. On the other hand, houses rated as being in lower-than-average condition have lower values. Specifically, they drop by $ 4526 (fair) and $ 24, 252 (poor) and $ 25, 725 (very poor). While these condition numbers appear to be very marginal considering the mean house value being as high as $ 383, 571, one must remember that the house data indicate only very little variation with respect to the condition they are in. Of the 8822 properties in our sample, only 2.2 % are rated below average and only 10.4 % are rated as either very good or excellent. The SLX model contains lagged variables for the structural house characteristics to account for spatial spillover effects. Though these lagged explanatory variables address the presence of spatial correlation and help avoiding omitted variable bias [61], we abstain from interpreting them in greater detail. Comparing their estimated coefficients for all four model variants, we notice that they differ substantially between the SLX models and the SDEM models with respect to magnitude, direction, and significance. However, the only difference between the SLX and the SDEM variants is the added spatial disturbance structure in the error terms to improve efficiency. Without jumping to conclusions, we want to emphasize that both the Moran’s I and the spatial coefficients (λ) in the SDEM models are extremely high with values of greater than 0.65 (see also Fig.  2), which partially helps understanding the observed spatial spillover effects from neighboring residential properties.|$|R
