She holds six Guinness World Records, {{has a strong}} fan following, and is among the first video game characters to be successfully adapted to film. Lara Croft is also considered a sex symbol, {{one of the earliest}} in the industry to achieve widespread attention. The character's influence in the industry has been a point of contention among critics; viewpoints range from a positive <b>agent</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> in video games to a negative role model for young girls.|$|E
5|$|Darwin's aims were twofold: to {{show that}} species had not been {{separately}} created, and {{to show that}} natural selection had been the chief <b>agent</b> <b>of</b> <b>change.</b> He knew that his readers were already familiar {{with the concept of}} transmutation of species from Vestiges, and his introduction ridicules that work as failing to provide a viable mechanism. Therefore, the first four chapters lay out his case that selection in nature, caused by the struggle for existence, is analogous to the selection of variations under domestication, and that the accumulation of adaptive variations provides a scientifically testable mechanism for evolutionary speciation.|$|E

Philosophical ideas relating to inertia had been proposed by John Philoponus and Jean Buridan. Galileo stated: [...] "Imagine any particle projected along a horizontal plane without friction; then we know, from what has been more fully explained in the preceding pages, that this particle will move along this same plane with a motion which is uniform and perpetual, provided the plane has no limits" [...] This was incorporated into Newton's laws of motion (first law).|$|E

According to Oh My Disney, Nala serves as [...] "the proverbial glue that keeps The Lion King together", from whose perspective the audience watches the film because she [...] "says EXACTLY what we’re thinking". Occupying {{the role of}} the film's female lead, Nala is The Lion Kings most important female character, who contributes to the film's [...] "small romance element". Often identified as the film's deuteragonist, Taylor Orci of The Atlantic felt that [...] "Nala is really the <b>agent</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> in The Lion King", dismissing Simba as a [...] "rich, lazy boyfriend." [...] Leab observed that The Lion Kings male characters tend to [...] "take the center stage" [...] while [...] "female characters take a backseat to the action." [...] Lenka Křivánková of Masaryk University wrote in her thesis [...] "1990s Hollywood Break-Away Hits: A Feminist Perspective" [...] that she was not particularly surprised by the film's lack of strong roles for women because of its Shakespearean source material, dubbing the film [...] "an old traditional fairy tale with all its traditional features", including patriarchy and monarchism. Writing for the University of Waterloo's Kinema, Vicky Wong believes that Nala reinforces the film's [...] "take your place" [...] motif, reminding main character Simba of his responsibilities. In his book Retelling Stories, Framing Culture: Traditional Story and Metanarratives in Children's Literature, author John Stephens credits Nala with teaching Simba about responsibility – [...] "the lesson the hero must learn before he can become an adult".|$|E

Dinkins filed several years of returns and said the tax matter had been fully paid off, denied other wrongdoing, and said that [...] "what we need is a mayor, not a prosecutor", and that Giuliani refused to say [...] "the R-word—he doesn't like to admit he's a Republican."

2500|$|In Act I Scene 2 of Shakespeare's Othello, Iago {{invokes the}} name of Janus after the failure of his premiere plot to undo the titular character. As the story's primary <b>agent</b> <b>of</b> <b>change,</b> it's fitting that Iago align himself with Janus. His schemes prompt the {{beginning}} of each of the main characters' ends: in his absence, Othello and Desdemona would likely have remained married and Cassio would have remained in his respected position of power. Iago guides (if not forces) the story through inception, climax, and finale. Furthermore, Janus' common two-faced depiction is the perfect visual metaphor for Iago's character. Othello's characters believe him to have only the best of intentions, even going as far as to call him [...] "honest Iago," [...] completely unaware that he spends every unwatched second plotting their undoing. He appears selfless and compassionate but, in truth, is power-hungry, amoral, and without regard for the well-being of others.|$|E
6000|$|How kindly he was! and, {{though the}} {{tremendous}} <b>agent</b> <b>of</b> <b>change,</b> yet bearing himself with such gentleness, so rendering himself {{a part of}} all life-long and age-coeval associations, that {{it seemed as if}} he were the great conservative of nature. While a man was true to the fireside, so long would he be true to country and law, to the God whom his fathers worshipped, to the wife of his youth, and to all things else which instinct or religion has taught us to consider sacred. With how sweet humility did this elemental spirit perform all needful offices for the household in which he was domesticated! He was equal to the concoction of a grand dinner, yet scorned not to roast a potato or toast a bit of cheese. How humanely did he cherish the school-boy's icy fingers, and thaw the old man's joints with a genial warmth which almost equalled the glow of youth! And how carefully did he dry the cowhide boots that had trudged through mud and snow, and the shaggy outside garment stiff with frozen sleet! taking heed, likewise, to the comfort of the faithful dog who had followed his master through the storm. When did he refuse a coal to light a pipe, or even a part of his own substance to kindle a neighbor's fire? And then, at twilight, when laborer, or scholar, or mortal of whatever age, sex, or degree, drew a chair beside him and looked into his glowing face, how acute, how profound, how comprehensive was his sympathy with the mood of each and all! He pictured forth their very thoughts. To the youthful he showed the scenes of the adventurous life before them; to the aged the shadows of departed love and hope; and, if all earthly things had grown distasteful, he could gladden the fireside muser with golden glimpses of a better world. And, amid this varied communion with the human soul, how busily would the sympathizer, the deep moralist, the painter of magic pictures, be causing the teakettle to boil! ...|$|E
60|$|Thus a {{very large}} yet {{undefined}} extension may safely {{be given to the}} direct and indirect results of natural selection; but I now admit, after reading the essay by Nägeli on plants, and the remarks by various authors with respect to animals, more especially those recently made by Professor Broca, that in the earlier editions of my ‘Origin of Species’ I probably attributed too much to the action of natural selection or the survival of the fittest. I have altered the fifth edition of the Origin so as to confine my remarks to adaptive changes of structure. I had not formerly sufficiently considered the existence of many structures which appear to be, {{as far as we can}} judge, neither beneficial nor injurious; and this I believe to be one of the greatest oversights as yet detected in my work. I may be permitted to say as some excuse, that I had two distinct objects in view, firstly, to shew that species had not been separately created, and secondly, that natural selection had been the chief <b>agent</b> <b>of</b> <b>change,</b> though largely aided by the inherited effects of habit, and slightly by the direct action of the surrounding conditions. Nevertheless I was not able to annul the influence of my former belief, then widely prevalent, that each species had been purposely created; and this led to my tacitly assuming that every detail of structure, excepting rudiments, was of some special, though unrecognised, service. Any one with this assumption in his mind would naturally extend the action of natural selection, either during past or present times, too far. Some of those who admit the principle of evolution, but reject natural selection, seem to forget, when criticising my book, that I had the above two objects in view; hence if I have erred in giving to natural selection great power, which I am far from admitting, or in having exaggerated its power, which is in itself probable, I have at least, as I hope, done good service in aiding to overthrow the dogma of separate creations.|$|E
