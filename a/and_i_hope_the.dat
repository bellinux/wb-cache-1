500|$|The {{prosecution}} presented {{two witnesses}} {{who were at}} the hospital after the shootings. Hospital security guard Priscilla Durham and police officer Garry Bell testified that Abu-Jamal confessed in the hospital by saying, [...] "I shot the motherfucker, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>the</b> motherfucker dies." ...|$|E
500|$|Will Ferrell's ten second cameo was well-received, with Canning concluding, [...] "...the cherry {{on the top}} was {{discovering}} that The Girlie Show was only picked up to offset the complaints raised by the series Bitch Hunter. The ten-second clip of this series, with a cameo from Will Ferrell, was phenomenal <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>the</b> web will soon produce more clips." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, Eva Spence {{credited}} {{on how the}} Astraea was a {{lot more}} positive than their previous material due to having time off between tours and being able to relax in the writing process. [...] "I feel happier than I {{have done in the past}} few years. I'm seeing things in a positive light <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>the</b> lyrics will be more uplifting" [...] In an interview with James Spence about the early writing process and how the lyrics have an essence of self-reflection as a common theme in the band's work, [...] "it's not something people normally look at or focus on; self-reflection as a theme, but if you ignore what's happening to you and how it's making you think about things then I don't think that's good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, it {{has been}} a good undertaking, altogether; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> that <b>the</b> {{punishment}} that has been inflicted will keep the tribes quiet for some years." ...|$|R
60|$|The tea {{was going}} on pleasantly {{when one of the}} babies began to cry. Teenie bent over it crooning gruffly. <b>I</b> leaned back <b>and</b> looked out of the door to watch her. I thought of the girl in Tchekoff's story, who smothered her charge, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>the</b> grim Teenie would not be driven to such desperation. The other child joined in this chorus. Teenie rose from her seat and walked about the yard, gruffly trying to soothe the twins.|$|R
60|$|I {{believe she}} is on this point rather out of her mind, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> do <b>hope</b> <b>the</b> poor thing will not do {{anything}} wild, and get into mischief.|$|R
500|$|The actress went on {{to explain}} that the storyline showed how Toyah regretted her actions and that young female viewers could learn from her mistake. She added [...] "Anyone {{watching}} can see Dobber is just using Toyah <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>the</b> message gets across to other girls not to fall into the same trap." [...] Toyah did not use protection with Dobber, so her sister, Leanne, persuaded her {{to go to the doctor}} for the morning-after pill. Taylor praised Leanne for being Toyah's [...] "conscience and the voice of common sense". She thought that Leanne had given her good and responsible advice on how to deal with what happened. The Daily Record's John Millar agreed with Taylor and wrote that the storyline was [...] "building to a stark warning for the millions of teenagers tuning into the Street." [...] Millar believed at no time did the viewers get the impression that Toyah was doing something [...] "admirable" [...] and proclaimed that Toyah was [...] "the sort of girl who needs care and affection, which explains why the poor soul was coaxed into losing her virginity after a holiday romance convinced her that she was in love." ...|$|E
500|$|Langford {{later said}} that Neighbours {{is doing a}} [...] "fairly decent job" [...] with Chris's coming out story. He wished that viewers got {{to see more of}} Chris's {{thoughts}} and feelings and less of how his situation affected the people around him. Langford added [...] "I do like that Chris isn't a perfect kid. Many shows tend to make gay teens near saints. Instead, he's a fairly average kid who makes mistakes and messes up, like starting a fight at a basketball game. In July 2011, Langford revealed that he had seen some comments from people thinking that Lucas and Chris should be paired up. He opined {{that there is not a}} hint of romance between the two and wondered why people assumed that if a gay character shares a scene with another guy, they must get together. Langford revealed that he liked Chris and Lucas's mentor and mentee relationship as it is. The writer also commented on the introduction of Chris's father and said that he was [...] "delighted" [...] that Chris was finally getting his own drama, that was [...] "pretty realistic." [...] He added [...] "It's nice to see the father/son dynamic play out. I have the feeling that a lot of Chris's dad's issues stem from the fact that his son is gay <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>the</b> show will delve into those unresoved issues." ...|$|E
500|$|Both Ruby and Brax decide Charlie's {{ventilator}} {{should be}} turned off as {{there is nothing more}} the doctors can do for her and Charlie dies. Speaking about her character's exit storyline, Anderson said [...] "When I read the final script for Charlie's exit, I made sure I was in the privacy of my own home. It was written really well – it was a tragic love story <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>the</b> fans like it." [...] The actress explained that the storyline was great and the writers had done a brilliant job with Charlie and Brax. She also said some fans would be disappointed that the couple did not end up together. Anderson revealed that the series producer had told her that after investing so much in getting Charlie together with Brax, she would not have left the Bay for another reason and killing her off was the best way. Of her reaction to the storyline, Anderson said [...] "I started sobbing! But that was the initial shock. You play this character {{for three and a half}} years and you really empathise with them. You have to love a part of them – it's a little extension of you. So it's just so final, the death. But once I had time to let it sink in, now I'm really, really happy with the ending. It's very dramatic and it's definitely going out with a bang, so to speak!" [...] Anderson departed on screen on 24 January 2012.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{come on out}} for a walk," [...] said Stalky in a well-chosen pause. [...] "It's {{all very}} disgustin', <b>and</b> <b>I</b> do <b>hope</b> <b>the</b> Lazar-house won't do it again." ...|$|R
60|$|You won't want me. You {{will be well}} (and thankless!) in no time. But there <b>I</b> am; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> that <b>the</b> {{knowledge}} may be {{a comfort}} to you. Call me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> come.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can assure}} you, Mr. Finn, {{that we have}} not {{regarded}} you in that light, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> that <b>the</b> time may come when we may be sitting together again on the same bench." ...|$|R
2500|$|In response, Jones said, [...] "I'm truly {{upset about}} the comments. Obviously Mr. Imus has {{problems}} with blacks. I'm upset, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>the</b> station he works for handles it accordingly. I will pray for him." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{honestly}} {{feel it is}} {{the most}} beautiful song I've ever been a part of. My goal when I started working on Leona's new album was to '' chase or be influenced by any of her previous hits—or any songs 've ever done with anyone else—including 'Bleeding Love'. True artists do not look back to previous successes; they look forward to creating new moments and songs the world can connect with in a different way. And that is what Leona has done with 'Happy'. I hope [...] like it as much as we do, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>the</b> lyrics hit [...] as hard as they hit me".|$|E
2500|$|Amy Ratcliffe of IGN {{rated the}} episodes 8.6 out of 10, saying [...] "Overall, tonight's super serving of Once Upon a Time covered {{a lot of}} ground with forward plot {{movement}} and character development. It stands as {{a good example of how}} to structure a two hour episode except for the fact that the primary plot could have been stronger. The Snow Queen's backstory was filled out even more, and it's easy to trace the path from point A to point villain. Mitchell was particularly excellent in Ingrid's lack of shoes tonight, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>the</b> story can overcome the fact that someone is casting the bajillionth spell on Storybrooke." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{object to}} the father," [...] said I. [...] "I think we've had enough, anyway, of fathers <b>and</b> daughters. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>the</b> next couple we fall in with will be {{a mother and a}} son." ...|$|R

2500|$|During the 2008 Cannes Film Festival, Harvey Weinstein {{announced}} that he had bought the rights to the film and will serve as its producer. Laurence Fishburne is set to direct, and to play the eponymous character. It will have a reported budget of $60 million. Weinstein, who rarely personally produces movies, stated that [...] "My loyalty is not to Laurence , my loyalty is not to me, my loyalty is not to anyone other than Paulo Coelho." [...] Coelho added, [...] "I am very happy that my book will be filmed in the way I intended it to be <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>the</b> spirit and simplicity of my work will be preserved. I am excited my friend Laurence Fishburne and Harvey Weinstein will be working together." ...|$|E

5000|$|David Lammy MP said {{corporate}} manslaughter {{would not}} get justice for victims and their families.
