5|$|Many other binary {{nitrogen}} hydrides are known, but {{the most}} important are hydrazine (N2H4) and hydrogen azide (HN3). Although it is not a nitrogen hydride, hydroxylamine (NH2OH) is similar in properties and structure to ammonia and hydrazine as well. Hydrazine is a fuming, colourless liquid that smells similarly to ammonia. Its physical properties are very similar to those of water (melting point 2.0°C, boiling point 113.5°C, density 1.00g·cm−3). Despite it being an endothermic compound, it is kinetically stable. It burns quickly and completely in air very exothermically to give nitrogen and water vapour. It is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>useful</b> and versatile reducing agent and is a weaker base than ammonia. It is also commonly used as a rocket fuel.|$|E

25|$|Another {{important}} {{use of the}} neutrino is in {{the observation}} of supernovae, the explosions that end the lives of highly massive stars. The core collapse phase of a supernova is an extremely dense and energetic event. It is so dense that no known particles are able to escape the advancing core front except for neutrinos. Consequently, supernovae are known to release approximately 99% of their radiant energy in a short (10-second) burst of neutrinos. These neutrinos are <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>useful</b> probe for core collapse studies.|$|E

25|$|William Brockwell (21 January 1865 – 1 July 1935) was an English cricketer. Although {{primarily}} {{remembered as}} a batsman, {{he began his career}} as a fast-medium bowler. With George Lohmann, Tom Richardson and William Lockwood carrying all before them, Brockwell had few opportunities until they declined. However, from 1897 onwards, he was <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>useful</b> bowler and took 105 wickets in the 1899 season when Richardson was out of form and Lockwood never fully fit. Even in 1902, he took six for 37 on an excellent pitch in the last match of the season against Warwickshire.|$|E
25|$|The {{largest of}} the colonial {{military}} forces was the British Indian Army. Up to Indian independence, this was a volunteer army, raised from the native population and staffed by British officers. The Indian Army served both as a security force in India itself and, particularly during the World Wars, in other theatres. The Indian Army proved <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>useful</b> adjunct to British forces wherever it served. Recruitment was entirely voluntary; about 1.3 million men served in the First World War, many on the Western Front, and 2.5 million in the Second. Initially the soldiers and NCOs were Indian, with British officers, but later Indian officers were promoted King's Commissioned Indian Officer.|$|E

As the Germans advanced to the bridge, they were briefly held off by the Dutch defenders. A few German soldiers were killed. However, the Dutch soon fell back because of overwhelming numbers. As the Germans began to cross the bridge, the charges were planted and the bridge fell into the river. After all of the bridges over the Maas River were destroyed, the only task that remained was to hold off the Germans as long as they could.|$|E

25|$|Another {{important}} staple to {{the people}} who settled at Kintampo was the oil palm. The oil palm was used at Kintampo starting at least 4000 years ago. <b>A</b> <b>very</b> <b>useful</b> plant in many ways, it serves as a source of drink, food, and construction material. It was allowed to flourish in the region due to its preference for a constant warm climate and high rainfall. As a food, the oil can be extracted from the mesocarp which covers the plant, and the kernel which is also edible by itself. It is an excellent source of vitamin A, which would have helped to support a growing population.|$|E

25|$|Kuno Klebelsberg {{himself did}} not {{consider}} religion {{an important factor in}} university appointments. However, under the pressure of Catholic bishops, he founded separate Catholic departments. Thus, the first head of the Second Department of Philosophy was János Mester (1879–1954), a Catholic professor, while the First Department of Philosophy was led by the Protestant György Málnási Bartók. Likewise, the Second Department of Literature and the Second Department of Pedagogy and Psychology were founded with the leaderships of Catholic professor Sándor Sík and Dezső Várkonyi Hildebrand from the Benedictine Order respectively, on the other hand, the Protestant First Department of Literature and the First Department of Pedagogy and Psychology were led by Lajos Dézsi and Sándor Imre respectively. <b>A</b> <b>very</b> <b>useful</b> followed.

25|$|An {{important}} {{property of}} the non-radiative transition between 3E and 1A {{is that it is}} stronger for ms = ±1 and weaker for ms = 0. This property results in <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>useful</b> manipulation of N-V center, which is called optical spin-polarization. First, an off-resonance excitation which has a higher frequency (typically 2.32 eV (532nbsp&nm)) than the frequencies of all transitions and thus lays in the vibronic bands for all transitions. By using a pulse of this wavelength, people can excite all spin states and create phonons as well. For a spin state with ms = 0, due to conservation of spin in transition, it will be excited to the corresponding ms = 0 state in 3E and then go back to original state. However, for a spin state with ms = ±1 in 3A, after the excitation, it has a relatively high probability to jump to the intermediate state 1A by non-radiative transition and go to the ground state with ms = 0. After sufficient cycles, the state of the N-V center can be regarded as in the ms = 0 state. Such a process can be used in the initialization of quantum state in quantum information processing.|$|E
