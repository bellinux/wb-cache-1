In this paper, I compare how two Hollywood movies about bike messengers, Quicksilver and Premium Rush, position their main characters {{in relationship to}} the new economy. Both films provide commentaries on work and social class, but, as products of unique socio-historical periods, I argue that their commentaries differ significantly. Produced in the 1980 s, Quicksilver uses messengering as a form of middle-class redemption, allowing the protagonist to return to the world of capitalist finance. By contrast, as a product of the Great Recession, Premium Rush offers a utopian vision of self-determination for low-wage service workers {{at the same time that}} it reifies the uncertainty, unpredictability, and riskiness that increasingly characterize American labor. I also show that both films converge in their portrayal of women and working-class blacks...|$|E

The policy and practices {{associated with this}} screening have never been critically scrutinized. Authoritative claims about {{what happens in the}} conduct of the immigration medical examination are at odds with the experience of immigrant applicants living with HIV. This is the <b>analytic</b> <b>entry</b> point into this inquiry that is organized within the theoretical and methodological frame offered by institutional ethnography and political activist ethnography. Analysis is connected to broader research literatures and the historical record. The goal {{of this study is to}} produce detailed, contextualized understandings of the social and ruling relations that organize the lives of immigrants to Canada living with HIV. These are generated from the material conditions of their lives. An assumption about how organization happens is the social and reflexive production of knowledge in people’s day-to-day lives through which connections between local and extra-local settings are empirically investigable. I investigate the organization of the Canadian immigration process. How is this institutional complex ordered and governed? How is immigration mandatory HIV testing organized, and with what consequences to HIV-positive applicants to Canada? This is a text-mediated organization where all the sites are connected by people’s work and the texts they circulate. The positive result of an immigration HIV test catalyzes the state’s collection of medical data about an applicant. These are entered into state decision-making about the person’s in/admissibility to Canada. I focus on a key component of the immigration process, which is medical examination and HIV testing with this, along with the HIV test counselling practices that happen (or not) there. The reported absence of the latter form of care causes problems and contradictions for people. This investigation adopts the standpoint of these persons to investigate their problems associated with HIV testing. The main empirically supported argument I make is that the Canadian state’s ideological work related to the HIV policy and mandatory screening ushers in a set of institutional practices that are highly problematic for immigrants with HIV. This argument relies on data collected in interviews, focus groups, observations, and analysis of texts organized under Canada’s Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (S. C., 2001, c. 27) and textually mediated, discursively organized concepts that shape people’s practice. Canadian immigration medical policy makers should make use of these findings, as should civil society activists acting on behalf of immigrants to Canada living with HIV. I make nine specific recommendations for future action on HIV and immigration in Canada...|$|E
40|$|Some {{analytic}} smoothing {{properties of}} a general strongly coupled, strongly parabolic semilinear system of order $ 2 m$ in $realnos^D times (0,T) $ with <b>analytic</b> <b>entries</b> are investigated. These properties are {{expressed in terms of}} holomorphic continuation in space and time of essentially bounded global solutions to the system. Given $ 0 < T' < T le infty$, it is proved that any weak, essentially bounded solution ${bold u} = (u_ 1,dots,u_N) $ in $realnos^Dtimes (0,T) $ possesses a bounded holomorphic continuation $bold u (x+iy,sigma + itau) $ into a region in $complexnos^Dtimescomplexnos$ defined by $(x,sigma) in realnos^Dtimes (T',T) $, $|y| < A'$ and $|tau | < B'$, where $A'$ and $B'$ are some positive constants depending upon $T'$. The proof is based on analytic smoothing properties of a parabolic Green function combined with a contraction mapping argument in a Hardy space $H^infty$. Applications include weakly coupled semilinear systems of complex reaction-diffusion equations such as the complex Ginzburg-Landau equations. Special attention is given to the problem concerning the validity of the derivation of amplitude equations which describe various instability phenomena in hydrodynamics...|$|R
40|$|The lateral {{deadband}} {{and minimum}} bank angle schedule were studied. Results {{used by the}} <b>analytic</b> drag control <b>entry</b> guidance system are presented. Lateral deadband limits and configuration were investigated and possible changes in the minimum bank angle schedule to improve crossrange control and drag acceleration control for entry were examined. The study recommends a 12. 5 deg lateral deadband to accommodate low dispersions of up to 23 %...|$|R

He {{received}} Taiwan's National Cultural Award in 1993 and 1998. As a pupil of William Jay Sydeman, Mario Davidovsky, George Rochberg and George Crumb, Lu {{was well known}} of his atonal writings combining counterpoint skills. George Rochberg commented that Lu's music [...] "has a unique scent". Lu wrote in his article [...] "My Artistic Journey" [...] that he wished to write [...] "music praising mother nature's great beauty and powers." [...] During 1967-2008, Lu wrote 6 solo instrumental works, 70+ chamber ensemble works (excluding art songs), 5 Chinese chamber works, 16 orchestral works, 1 Chinese orchestra piece, and 11 art songs. Among these works, there was a repeated theme about the sound of bell, which Lu always remembered from his childhood in the Jiangnan region of China. Two biographies were published in Taiwan, Lu Yen: A Cold Fire of Music, written by Taiwanese poet Chen Li (陳黎) in 1997 and A Poetic Journey of Nostalgia, by Canadian-Taiwanese composer Shyh-ji Chew (潘世姬) and Taiwanese composer Janet Jieru Chen (陳玠如) in 2004, both published by Taiwan’s China Times Publishing Co. Digitalization data of Lu’s art song manuscripts and <b>analytic</b> <b>entries</b> are available at Nation Music Archive and Taiwan Music Center of the National Center for Traditional Arts, Taipei, Taiwan. Soochow University (Taipei, Taiwan), where Lu has taught music composition and counterpoint for 30 years, has a memorial room and a growing collection of Lu’s manuscripts. Lu’s music could be heard in albums published by Music Forum, International Society for Contemporary Music-Taiwan Section, Asian Composers League - Taiwanese Composers Association and National Taiwan Symphony Orchestra.|$|R
40|$|The octonions {{are one of}} {{the four}} normed {{division}} algebras, together with the real, complex and quaternion number systems. The latter three hold a primary place in random matrix theory, where in applications to quantum physics they are determined as the entries of ensembles of Hermitian random by symmetry considerations. Only for N= 2 is there an existing analytic theory of Hermitian random matrices with octonion entries. We use a Jordan algebra viewpoint to provide an analytic theory for N= 3. We then proceed to consider the matrix structure X^† X, when X has random octonion <b>entries.</b> <b>Analytic</b> results are obtained from N= 2, but are observed to break down in the 3 × 3 case.
