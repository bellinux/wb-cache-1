25|$|The {{most famous}} of these problems, {{squaring}} the circle, otherwise known as the quadrature of the circle, involves constructing a square with the same area <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> circle using only straightedge and compass.|$|E
25|$|Squaring {{the circle}} is the problem, {{proposed}} by ancient geometers, of constructing a square {{with the same}} area <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> circle by using only {{a finite number of}} steps with compass and straightedge.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, the Many-minds Interpretation {{does not}} solve the mindless hulks problem as a problem of supervenience. Mental states do not supervene on brain states <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> brain state is {{compatible}} with different configurations of mental states.|$|E

5000|$|Positive Relations with Others: High scores {{reflect the}} respondent's {{engagement}} in meaningful relationships with others that include reciprocal empathy, intimacy, and affection.

5000|$|Emergency {{vehicles}} {{of any kind}} (fire truck, ambulance, police car) are highly likely {{to be involved in}} hazardous situations, including relatively common incidents such <b>as</b> <b>a</b> road traffic collision. They are also required to gain access to incidents as quickly as possible, and in many countries, are given dispensation from obeying certain traffic laws; for instance, {{they may be able to}} treat a red traffic light or stop sign <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>give</b> way, or be permitted to break the speed limit. However, emergency vehicles usually are not able to treat <b>a</b> railroad crossing <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>give</b> way, because <b>a</b> train cannot be warned in time to stop before the crossing to let the vehicle through. Hence, one of the few things emergency vehicles must yield to are heavy freight and passenger trains.|$|R

25|$|Beauclerk scored 170 <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> man {{playing for}} Homerton against Montpelier in 1807, a match not widely {{recognised}} as first-class.

25|$|Sela pushed {{this work}} further to study first-order theory of {{arbitrary}} torsion-free word-hyperbolic groups and to characterize all {{groups that are}} elementarily equivalent to (that is, have the same first order theory <b>as)</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> torsion-free word-hyperbolic group. In particular, his work implies that if a finitely generated group G is elementarily equivalent to a word-hyperbolic group then G is word-hyperbolic as well.|$|E

25|$|Starting in {{the early}} 1990s, {{derivatives}} of Freyja began to appear <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> name for girls. According to the Norwegian name database from the Central Statistics Bureau, around 500 women are listed with the first name Frøya (the modern Norwegian spelling of the goddess's name) in the country. There are also several similar names, such as the first element of the dithematic personal name Frøydis.|$|E
25|$|James Bryant {{made his}} last known {{appearances}} in 1751 while John continued until 1756. He {{is not known}} to have played for Bromley again and the later mentions of him are <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> man for both Dartford and London. He was last recorded on Monday, 6 September 1756 playing for Darford against London at the Artillery Ground. He died on 23 July 1772.|$|E
25|$|As another example, {{mathematical}} finance will derive {{and extend}} the mathematical or numerical models without necessarily establishing a link to financial theory, taking observed market prices as input. Mathematical consistency is required, not compatibility with economic theory. Thus, for example, while a financial economist might study the structural reasons why a company may have a certain share price, a financial mathematician may take the share price <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>given,</b> and attempt to use stochastic calculus to obtain the corresponding value of derivatives of the stock (see: Valuation of options; Financial modeling).|$|E
2500|$|This {{can be seen}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>giving</b> <b>a</b> sort of {{justification}} to the Platonist view that the objects of our mathematical theories are real.

However several difficulties remain: ...|$|R

25|$|Mitt Romney easily won {{the next}} contest, New Hampshire, his win seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>given.</b> Romney had {{persistently}} shown popularity in that state, but rivals were intensely {{fighting for a}} second-place finish there. Jon Huntsman, Jr., a moderate, had staked his candidacy on New Hampshire and invested heavily {{in at least a}} strong second place showing, but after 150 campaign events in the state he ended third after Paul. Both he and Rick Perry dropped out of the race shortly before voting day in South Carolina and the two delegates allocated to Huntsman became unbound.|$|E
25|$|After fraud was alleged in {{the mayoral}} {{election}} of 2012 in Astrakhan and the United Russia candidate was declared the winner, {{organizers of the}} 2011–2012 Russian protests supported the defeated candidate, Oleg V. Shein of Just Russia, in a hunger strike. Substantial evidence of fraud was cited by the protesters but an official investigation failed to find significant violations. The activists from Moscow {{found it difficult to}} gain traction over the issue with local residents who, like most Russians, accept political corruption <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> that is useless to protest. The emissaries from Moscow persisted, buoyed by celebrities who support the reform movement, drawing 1,500 to a rally on 14 April.|$|E
25|$|The oldest extant {{mathematical}} {{records from}} India are the Sulba Sutras (dated variously between the 8th century BC and the 2nd century AD), appendices to religious texts which give simple rules for constructing altars of various shapes, such as squares, rectangles, parallelograms, and others. As with Egypt, the preoccupation with temple functions {{points to an}} origin of mathematics in religious ritual. The Sulba Sutras give methods for constructing a circle with approximately the same area <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> square, which imply several different approximations {{of the value of}} π. (3.0044...), 25/8 (3.125), 900/289 (3.11418685...), 1156/361 (3.202216...), and 339/108 (3.1389). In addition, they compute the square root of 2 to several decimal places, list Pythagorean triples, and give a statement of the Pythagorean theorem. All of these results are present in Babylonian mathematics, indicating Mesopotamian influence. It is not known to what extent the Sulba Sutras influenced later Indian mathematicians. As in China, {{there is a lack of}} continuity in Indian mathematics; significant advances are separated by long periods of inactivity.|$|E
