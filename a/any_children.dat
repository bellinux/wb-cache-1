5|$|In December 1689, Parliament passed one of {{the most}} {{important}} constitutional documents in English history, the Bill of Rights. This measure—which restated and confirmed many provisions of the earlier Declaration of Right—established restrictions on the royal prerogative; it declared, among other things, that the Sovereign could not suspend laws passed by Parliament, levy taxes without parliamentary consent, infringe the right to petition, raise a standing army during peacetime without parliamentary consent, deny the right to bear arms to Protestant subjects, unduly interfere with parliamentary elections, punish members of either House of Parliament for anything said during debates, require excessive bail, or inflict cruel or unusual punishments. The Bill of Rights also confirmed the succession to the throne. Following the death of either William III or Mary II, the other was to continue to reign. Next in the line of succession would be <b>any</b> <b>children</b> of the couple, to be followed by Mary's sister Anne and her children. Last in the line of succession stood <b>any</b> <b>children</b> William III might have had from any subsequent marriage.|$|E

5|$|Out {{of respect}} for Momchil, Kantakouzenos spared his wife, a Bulgarian woman he had {{captured}} during his conquest of Xanthi. He allowed her to flee to Bulgaria along with all of her property. However, it is unknown whether Momchil had <b>any</b> <b>children</b> from this marriage or a previous one, if any. Pavlov presents the hypothesis that Momchil's wife was a noblewoman from the Bulgarian capital Tarnovo, whom he married {{as part of an}} agreement with the Bulgarian court.|$|E
5|$|Prince Henry {{showed no}} {{interest}} in Catherine as a wife; instead, he openly took mistresses. For the first ten years of the marriage, Catherine failed to produce <b>any</b> <b>children.</b> In 1537, Philippa Duci, one of Henry's mistresses, {{gave birth to a}} daughter, whom he publicly acknowledged. This proved that Henry was fertile and added to the pressure on Catherine to produce a child.|$|E
5|$|Rosebery's {{own mother}} was horrified {{at the thought}} of a Jewish woman, even a Rothschild, in the family. Rosebery too felt there was an impassable barrier of faith; at this time, it was inconceivable that <b>any</b> <b>children</b> could be reared as Jews. Although it has been stated that Rosebery himself was devoid of any antisemitic views, this was not always true, {{especially}} in later life.|$|E

5|$|The {{church does}} not {{recognise}} divorce as ending a valid marriage and allows state-recognised divorce {{only as a}} means of protecting the property and well being of the spouses and <b>any</b> <b>children.</b> However, consideration of particular cases by the competent ecclesiastical tribunal can lead to declaration of the invalidity of a marriage, a declaration usually referred to as an annulment. Remarriage following a divorce is not permitted unless the prior marriage was declared invalid.|$|E

5|$|After Hancock's {{father died}} in 1744, John was sent {{to live with his}} uncle and aunt, Thomas Hancock and Lydia (Henchman) Hancock. Thomas Hancock was the {{proprietor}} of a firm known as the House of Hancock, which imported manufactured goods from Britain and exported rum, whale oil, and fish. Thomas Hancock's highly successful business made him one of Boston's richest and best-known residents. He and Lydia, along with several servants and slaves, lived in Hancock Manor on Beacon Hill. The couple, who did not have <b>any</b> <b>children</b> of their own, became the dominant influence on John's life.|$|E

5|$|After {{he became}} Emperor, Zara Yaqob married princess Eleni, who had {{converted}} from Islam before their marriage. Eleni {{was the daughter}} of the king of Hadiya, one of the Sidamo kingdoms south of the Abay River. Although she failed to bear him <b>any</b> <b>children,</b> Eleni grew into a powerful political person. When a conspiracy involving one of his Bitwodeds came to light, Zara Yaqob reacted by appointing his two daughters, Medhan Zamada and Berhan Zamada, to these two offices. According to the Chronicle of his reign, the Emperor also appointed his daughters and nieces as governors over eight of his provinces. These appointments were not successful.|$|E
5|$|Around 1844, {{she married}} a free black man named John Tubman. Although {{little is known about}} him or their time together, the union was {{complicated}} because of her slave status. Since the mother's status dictated that of children, <b>any</b> <b>children</b> born to Harriet and John would be enslaved. Such blended marriages – free people of color marrying enslaved people – were not uncommon on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, where by this time, half the black population was free. Most African-American families had both free and enslaved members. Larson suggests that they might have planned to buy Tubman's freedom.|$|E
5|$|Cosimo became perturbed by the {{question}} of the Tuscan Succession following the death of his mother. Ferdinando was lacking <b>any</b> <b>children,</b> as was Anna Maria Luisa. The latter, who was high in her father's estimation, put forward a German princess to marry Gian Gastone. The lady in question, Anna Maria Franziska of Saxe-Lauenburg, nominal heiress of the Duchy of Saxe-Lauenburg, was extremely wealthy. Cosimo once again dreamed of a Medici cadet branch in a foreign land. They were married on 2 July 1697. Gian Gastone and herself did not get along; he eventually abandoned her in 1708.|$|E
