Hayward, Agnes Marian Ayre, and Harold B. Goodridge, the last of whom worked on a number of mural commissions, notably one for the lobby of the Confederation Building in St. John's. Local art societies became prominent in the 1940s, particularly The Art Students Club, which opened in 1940.|$|E
25|$|With {{the goal}} of {{developing}} <b>amateur</b> <b>art</b> within {{the ranks of the}} army and to encourage soldiers' interest in good music, the ensemble grew to 300 performers by 1933, comprising three different forces of a male choir, an orchestra, and an ensemble of dancers. Some sources say that in 1933 there were 19 members; in 1935 there were 135 and in August 1937 in Paris and Prague they were 150. The Red Army Choir became known as a propagator of Soviet songs, performing original compositions by composers such as Vasily Solovyov-Sedoy, Anatoli Novikov, Matvey Blanter and Boris Mokrousov.|$|E

He was an intensely sophisticated child. He had the air of one who has seen all life has to offer, and is now permanently bored.

40|$|Over 2009 - 2010, the Third Sector Research Centre (TSRC) {{undertook}} work {{to identify}} {{the current state of}} knowledge on small, below the radar, community groups and activities. This highlighted the lack of research into the contribution of grass-roots or <b>amateur</b> <b>arts</b> organisations make in communities. This gap in knowledge is substantial, given that there are an estimated 49, 000 such groups in England. In partnership with the Universities of Exeter and Glamorgan as well as Voluntary Arts, and with financial support from the Arts and Humanities Research Council’s Connected Communities programme, the Centre undertook a scoping study to assess the lessons from the academic and grey literature across the arts, social sciences and voluntary sector. This identified a range of different impacts and outcomes in terms of <b>amateur</b> <b>arts</b> groups. For individuals, participation in arts based activities ‘for their own sake’ could promote their mental health and wellbeing. Some involved, particularly young people, made the transition from <b>amateur</b> <b>arts</b> to paid employment in the creative industries. Improvements in educational attainment and functioning in the work-place were also reported as positive outcomes in some of the literature. Claims were also made about the economic role such activities play in communities: through the hire of village halls, the management of local assets, equipment hire or the employment of professional artists in, for example, preparing for performances. However in this, and other areas, {{there was a lack of}} empirical evidence exploring or quantifying the exact nature of impact. The measurement of the impact of <b>amateur</b> <b>arts</b> was explored further with members of grass-roots arts networks at a day conference in October 2011 at Cecil Sharp House (Conference Report – Growing the Grassroots: the contribution of <b>amateur</b> <b>arts</b> to communities). It is the hope of the current partners that further research can be undertaken over 2012 to develop a practical toolkit for assessing the outcomes of <b>amateur</b> <b>arts</b> activities in communities...|$|R
