25|$|Denis de Rougemont {{said that}} the troubadours were {{influenced}} by Cathar doctrines which rejected {{the pleasures of the}} flesh and that they were metaphorically addressing the spirit and soul of their ladies. Rougemont also said that courtly love subscribed to the code of chivalry, and therefore a knight's loyalty was always to his King before his mistress. Edmund Reiss claimed it was also a spiritual love, but <b>a</b> <b>love</b> <b>that</b> had more in common with Christian love, or caritas. On the other hand, scholars such as Mosché Lazar claim it was adulterous sexual love with physical possession of the lady the desired end.|$|E

25|$|Panagiotis Soutsos, {{along with}} his brother, was the {{originator}} of romanticism in poetry and prose of the First Athenian School with his poem The Wayfarer (Ὁ Ὁδοιπόρος) in 1831 and his novel Leander (Ὁ Λέανδρος) in 1834. The Wayfarer is a dialogic poem with a dramatic form but no scenic intention. The story revolves around the love between two young people, the Wayfarer and Rallou, which is presented in accordance with romantic motifs; <b>a</b> <b>love</b> <b>that</b> is met with various obstacles and which, ultimately unfulfilled, brings both protagonists to death. Central to the poem are themes of distraction, religion, and heartbreak. Soutsos kept editing the poem throughout his life, and every edition (1842, 1851, 1864) contained an increasingly archaic form of Greek, whereas his first edition was written in plain Katharevousa. Overall, Soutsos' poems are dominated by the lyric and elegiac tone, with the main subjects being religion, love and freedom, and all influenced by French Romanticism.|$|E
500|$|Swift and {{her love}} {{interest}} continued their relationship, but then went {{their separate ways}} because {{it was hard for}} them to see each other. To Swift, the song resembles much optimism regarding love and how encountering the right person could surpass skepticism. She deemed [...] "Love Story" [...] one of her most romantic songs, although she was never in an official relationship with the subject of the song. In retrospect, Swift said the song is [...] "about <b>a</b> <b>love</b> <b>that</b> you've got to hide because for whatever reason it wouldn't go over well", adding [...] "I spun it in the direction of Romeo and Juliet. Our parents are fighting. I relate to it more as <b>a</b> <b>love</b> <b>that</b> you cannot really elaborate on — <b>a</b> <b>love</b> <b>that</b> maybe society wouldn't accept [...] maybe your friends wouldn't accept." ...|$|E

She cited her then-husband Marc Anthony as being that person for her. Monica Herrera of Billboard picked up on this, with the lyrics: [...] "I feel the beat again, stronger than before". Scott Shetler of PopCrush pointed out the song's optimistic viewpoint, with the lyrics: [...] "I'm alive, I can breathe, I can feel, I believe." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Amor Prohibido" [...] {{has become}} an anthem in the LGBT {{community}}. Deborah Paredez wrote in her 2009 book Selenidad that the song has [...] "a legibly queer text" [...] which resonates with that group. This was echoed by Emma Perez in her book, The Decolonial Imaginary: Writing Chicanas into History (1999), who found that the LGBT community had adopted the song and found it most popular with drag queens at nightclubs. Perez further explained that the lyrical content of forbidden love between two people of different social classes was altered with prohibited love between same-sex couples. Alejandra Molina of the Orange County Register reported on a tribute to Selena by LGBT fans in Santa Ana, California who found her songs [...] "ambiguous"; [...] "Amor Prohibido" [...] was interpreted [...] "as <b>a</b> <b>love</b> <b>that</b> is forbidden due to a person's sexuality, race or class." ...|$|E
500|$|Steve Leftridge from PopMatters {{considered}} the track {{to have a}} [...] "ho-hum" [...] melody. Its melody was compared to Britney Spears' [...] "Everytime" [...] (2003) and Evanescence's [...] "My Immortal" [...] (2003). During the chorus, Perry sings about holding out for <b>a</b> <b>love</b> <b>that</b> is [...] "cinematic and dramatic/With the perfect ending" [...] and later asks {{if she is a}} [...] "stupid girl", according to Elysa Gardner from USA Today and an anonymous reviewer for Portrait Magazine. A reviewer for Portrait Magazine, considering it to be the slowest-paced song on Teenage Dream, said it juxtaposed well with the other tracks. [...] "It takes all the energy {{from the rest of the}} album, all the fast beating hearts and overwhelming feelings of love, and slows it all down to a song about looking for love instead," [...] they wrote.|$|E
500|$|Amarte Es un Placer is a pop album {{composed}} of twelve love songs, consisting mainly of orchestrated romantic ballads and several uptempo numbers.

500|$|... "Borderline" [...] was {{recorded}} in February 1983 and ushered a change from Madonna's [...] normal vocal tone. A sentimental track, the song talks about <b>a</b> <b>love</b> <b>that</b> is never quite fulfilled. According to author Santiago Fouz-Hernández in his book Madonna's drowned worlds, the song's lyrics like [...] "Something in way you love me won't let me be/I don't want to be your prisoner so baby won't you set me free" [...] depicted a rebellion against male chauvinism. Madonna used a refined and expressive voice to sing the song, backed by Lucas's instrumentations. It is considered {{the best example of}} the working relationship between Lucas and Madonna, and he pushed her to find emotional depth in the song. Although sounding icy, the chorus is contemporary in style, and the vocal range for this song was later used by Madonna as her own personal range through her whole music career. It opens with a keyboard rich intro played on a Fender-Rhodes electric piano and a catchy synth melody provided by Fred Zarr. Bass player Anthony Jackson doubled Dean Gant's synth bass to provide a solid and more complex texture.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} create a balance in the track listing, Lafourcade wrote [...] "Te Quiero Ver" [...] as a [...] "simple song" [...] about wanting to be with someone. The track was co-written by Marian Ruzzi, and was {{inspired}} by the music of the 1970s, including a chorus with answering voices, emulating musical theatre. The lyrics for [...] "Lo Que Construimos", deals with the decision to leave someone and going separate ways. [...] "Estoy Lista" [...] is a ballad about being ready to be well, and Lafourcade worked on the track in her spare time, taking a year to finish it. The last track, [...] "No Más Llorar", was written during a family reunion with her father and sister in Chile. Lafourcade wrote it about <b>a</b> <b>love</b> <b>that</b> could not be, her mourning and search for stability, forgiveness, and healing. In live performances, the singer dedicates the track to Mexico, to send hope through her music and help people deal with situations such as the Iguala mass kidnapping. [...] "I feel that nowadays is really important that we acknowledge the social part. We must look inward and work, see which aspects we can address to deliver something more positive to the world".|$|E

The chords in the song were inspired by Seventies disco sound in Philadelphia as well as Elton John's musical style during the mid-seventies. The chord sequences cite from Bachman–Turner Overdrive's song [...] "You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet" [...] while the synth phases display her typical musical style. The third track [...] "Burning Up" [...] has a starker arrangement, brought about by bass, single guitar and Linn drum machine. The drum beats used in the song were reminiscent to the records of singer Phil Collins. It also incorporated electric guitars and the most state-of-the-art synthesizers of that time. The chorus is a repetition of the same three lines, while the bridge consists of a series of double entendres; the lyrics describing what Madonna is prepared to do for her lover, and that she is individualistic and shameless.|$|E
