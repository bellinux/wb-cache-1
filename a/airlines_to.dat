5|$|An {{agreement}} was signed with Amadeus in 2007 to upgrade Biman's ticketing system with an e-ticketing solution {{to comply with}} IATA rules, which set out a deadline of 31 December 2007 for all member <b>airlines</b> <b>to</b> switch over their ticketing systems. E-ticketing has enabled major <b>airlines</b> <b>to</b> provide online check-in facilities, reducing the need to queue up at check-in counters. However, Biman has not made any attempts to improve customer service through the adoption of e-ticketing, {{although it has been}} able to reduce its own costs. In 2005, Biman had briefly stopped using the Amadeus ticketing system when the government suspended the operation of a local Amadeus subsidiary following a court order, after allegations of money laundering. The suspension, however, lasted only a month, and was lifted after the writ was appealed in the High Court.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, {{the threat}} of the typhoon caused <b>airlines</b> <b>to</b> cancel 145flights, mostly in and around Okinawa. About 50American army bases in Okinawa were closed, and non-essential workers were told to remain home.|$|E
5|$|In March 2015, Hong Kong Airlines {{joined the}} Executive Committee of the Board of Airline Representatives in Hong Kong (BAR HK), holding hands with another almost 80 <b>airlines</b> <b>to</b> improve the {{commercial}} and operational conditions for airlines active in Hong Kong.|$|E
50|$|In 1961 Mohawk was {{the first}} <b>airline</b> <b>to</b> use a {{centralized}} computer-based reservation service, and in 1965 the first regional <b>airline</b> <b>to</b> use flight simulators. Mohawk upgraded its fleet with the BAC One-Eleven in 1965, becoming the first regional <b>airline</b> <b>to</b> fly jets.|$|R
25|$|Growing {{financial}} difficulties at Jadepoint resulted in BAF {{being placed in}} administration in January 1988. A new holding company, called Mostjet, was formed within a year <b>to</b> enable the <b>airline</b> <b>to</b> emerge from administration in May 1989, the only British <b>airline</b> <b>to</b> do so at the time.|$|R
5000|$|Opaque pricing {{also has}} {{benefits}} for <b>airlines.</b> <b>Airlines</b> tend <b>to</b> increase their fares {{the closer you}} get to the departure date, even if there are many available seats. This is to [...] "train" [...] the consumers to book early, making it easier for the <b>airline</b> <b>to</b> do proper revenue management. If <b>airlines</b> were <b>to</b> dump their fares if a flight failed to fill up, then this would train the customers to wait until very close to departure before booking. This would make it virtually impossible for an <b>airline</b> <b>to</b> manage their fares (fares could then only be determined based on historical data and not based on current demand). Dynamic packaging allows an <b>airline</b> <b>to</b> get rid of distressed inventory at discounted fares, as the discounted fare is effectively hidden from the consumer.|$|R
5|$|A vintage Douglas Dakota and Douglas DC-3 {{were the}} first {{aircraft}} in Biman's fleet. Domestic operations commenced with the acquisition of four Fokker F27 aircraft flying passengers to Chittagong and Sylhet from its base in Dhaka. Shortly afterwards, a Boeing 707, chartered from British Caledonian, joined the airline's fleet, allowing Biman to begin international flights. In 1983, Biman purchased three McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 aircraft from Singapore <b>Airlines</b> <b>to</b> provide services on its long haul routes. The British Aerospace ATP entered the fleet in late 1990, coming to replace the Fokker F27s.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the {{official}} launch, the alliance embarked on an extensive employee communications and training programme, involving {{virtually all of the}} 220,000 staff employed by the five member <b>airlines,</b> <b>to</b> ensure they could deliver what the alliance brand promised. At its launch in 1999, Oneworld's member airlines and their affiliates served 648 destinations in 139 countries, and carried 181 million passengers with a fleet of 1,577 aircraft.|$|E
5|$|As {{chairman}} of the Commerce Committee's aviation subcommittee, Ford secured funds to improve the airports in Louisville, northern Kentucky, and Glasgow. The Wendell H. Ford Airport in Hazard, Kentucky is named for him. A 1990 bill aimed at reducing aircraft noise, improving airline safety measures, and requiring <b>airlines</b> <b>to</b> better inform consumers about their performance was dubbed the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century.|$|E
50|$|Nauru has one airport, Nauru International Airport. Nauru <b>Airlines,</b> which flies <b>to</b> Brisbane, Australia; Majuro, Marshall Islands; Nadi, Fiji; and Tarawa, Kiribati, is {{the only}} <b>airline</b> <b>to</b> fly to the airport. There are five {{airplanes}} in service.|$|R
50|$|On 28 April 2005, Thomsonfly {{became the}} first <b>airline</b> <b>to</b> fly from Robin Hood Airport Doncaster Sheffield. Thomsonfly {{was also the first}} <b>airline</b> <b>to</b> operate direct long haul {{services}} from the airport. The airline remains the dominant carrier at Robin Hood Airport, Coventry Airport and Bournemouth Airport, where a base was also established.|$|R

5|$|In 1994, the {{domestic}} and international flights to the European Union were deregulated, {{and the number of}} international services increased and Fornebu received airlines such as Air Malta, Air Portugal, AirUK and LOT Polish Airlines. Other <b>airlines</b> <b>to</b> fly from Fornebu during the 1980s and 1990s includes Delta Air Lines, Northwest Orient and Tower Air. Domestically, Braathens SAFE introduced flights to Bergen, Bodø, Harstad/Narvik and Tromsø.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the incident and the circumstances of Lubitz's involvement, aviation authorities in some countries implemented new regulations that require the presence of two authorized personnel in the cockpit at all times. Three days after the incident, the European Aviation Safety Agency issued a temporary recommendation for <b>airlines</b> <b>to</b> ensure {{that at least two}} crew members—including at least one pilot—were in the cockpit during the entire duration of the flight. Several airlines announced that they had already adopted similar policies voluntarily.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia Airlines retired the Flight 370 (MH370) {{flight number}} and {{replaced}} it with Flight 318 (MH318) beginning 14 March. This follows a common practice among <b>airlines</b> <b>to</b> rename flights following notorious accidents. The flight—Malaysia Airline's second daily flight to Beijing—was later suspended beginning 2 May; according to insiders, this was due to lack of demand.|$|E

5|$|On opening, Melbourne Airport {{consisted}} of three connected terminals: International in the centre, with Ansett to the South and Trans Australia <b>Airlines</b> <b>to</b> the North. The design capacity of the airport was eight Boeing 707s {{at a rate of}} 500 passengers per hour, with minor expansion works completed in 1973 allowing Boeing 747s to serve the airport. By the late 1980s peak passenger flows at the airport had reached 900 per hour, causing major congestion.|$|E
5|$|The Amarillo Economic Development Corporation (AEDC) {{is funded}} by a city sales tax, and it {{provides}} aggressive incentive packages to existing and prospective employers. In the mid-to-late 1990s, the AEDC gained notoriety by sending mock checks to businesses across the country, placing full-page advertisements in The Wall Street Journal, and paying an annual $1million subsidy to American <b>Airlines</b> <b>to</b> retain jet service. The AEDC is largely responsible for bringing Bell Helicopter Textron's development of the V-22 Osprey hybrid aircraft and the future site of Marine One assembly in Amarillo.|$|E
5|$|The DC-10 {{used as the}} {{restaurant}} was formerly {{owned and operated by}} Ghana Airways on routes between Ghana and both Europe and the United States. Ghana Airways ordered a DC-10-30 in 1976, with it arriving on 24 February 1983. During July 1985, it was used to fly United Nations troops in and out of Beirut, Lebanon. In January the following year the plane was used under contract from Caribbean <b>Airlines</b> <b>to</b> fly passengers from Europe to the Caribbean twice weekly.|$|E

5|$|Through the mid-2000s, EVA Air's {{route network}} was {{affected}} by the political status of Taiwan, which has historically limited access for Taiwanese <b>airlines</b> <b>to</b> Europe and certain Asian countries. Because Taiwanese carriers did not have direct access to China, EVA Air has used Hong Kong, Bangkok and Macau as interline destinations. EVA Air operated regular charter flights to China in 2008. The airline began regularly scheduled, direct cross-strait operations in December 2008, following the restoration of direct travel links.|$|E
5|$|With {{increased}} traffic, there {{soon became}} a capacity problem at Oslo Airport, Fornebu, the main hub for both SAS and Braathens. During the peak times during the morning and afternoon rush, there were no excess slots for new <b>airlines.</b> <b>To</b> compensate, the Norwegian Airport Administration was building a new main airport for Eastern Norway, to be located at Gardermoen. A larger terminal and two runways would give ample room for expansion, and entry of new airlines. The new airport opened on 8 October 1998.|$|E
5|$|A third airfield, Alamo Field, was {{established}} in 1942 by aviator George Crockett {{south of the city}} of Las Vegas, at the present location of McCarran Airport. As the Army sought to open a local base at the site of McCarran Field, Clark County purchased Alamo Field from Crockett in order to relocate commercial air traffic. Alamo Field became the new McCarran Field on December 19, 1948. The opening of this new airfield broke Western Air Express' monopoly on flights to Las Vegas, allowing other <b>airlines</b> <b>to</b> serve the market. Meanwhile, the Army reopened its base at the original McCarran Field in 1949 and named it Nellis Air Force Base in 1950.|$|E
50|$|On 22 July 2008, Cebu Pacific was {{the first}} <b>airline</b> <b>to</b> use the new Terminal 3 of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport with its flight to Caticlan being the first to depart at 0515 local time. On 1 August 2008, it moved its {{international}} operations to the terminal; thus, becoming the first <b>airline</b> <b>to</b> have regular international commercial flights from the new terminal.|$|R
5000|$|The airline {{was formed}} from the Aeroflot Orenburg Division, which was {{established}} in 1932. In 1992 it began to operate under its present name. It was the first Russian domestic <b>airline</b> <b>to</b> introduce the hub system of connecting flights in Orenburg, providing a full service for transfer passengers, {{and was the first}} Russian domestic <b>airline</b> <b>to</b> introduce through air fares.|$|R

5|$|As a large country {{spanning}} {{over three}} timezones, Indonesia possesses a vast airspace. However, Indonesia {{is not a}} participant of the International Air Services Transit Agreement (IASTA), therefore both Indonesian airspace and airports are closed for foreign commercial airlines' freedoms of the air, unless there were bilateral transit agreements negotiated with other countries. Indonesia and Australia for example, signed a bilateral agreement relating to air service on 7 February 2013. According to this agreement, each nations grants to the other party the right to fly across its territory without landing, {{and the right to}} make stops in its territory for non-traffic purposes (1st and 2nd freedom), and the rights for designated <b>airlines</b> <b>to</b> operate services.|$|E
5|$|At the Paris Air Show in June 2011, Hong Kong Airlines had {{announced}} a signed contract for 10 Airbus A380's however due to China's anger with the European Union over plans to force all <b>airlines</b> <b>to</b> {{take part in}} its carbon-trading scheme, the Chinese government has blocked progress on Airbus’s sale of 10 A380s to Hong Kong Airlines. Normally, airlines in Hong Kong {{are not required to}} seek approval from the Chinese government to proceed with aircraft orders. The A380 cancellation became an issue as Hong Kong Airlines' parent, Hainan Airlines, is registered in mainland China, not Hong Kong SAR. In early January 2012, HKA's corporate governance head Kenneth Thong stated in a TV interview that the order was going ahead.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1970s, {{airlines}} {{were considering}} upgrading their aging Douglas DC-8 aircraft as an alternative to buying new quieter and more efficient aircraft. Following the French KC-135 order in 1978, the April 1979 decision by United <b>Airlines</b> <b>to</b> upgrade 30 of their DC-8-61 aircraft with the CFM56-2 was important for securing the development of the CFM56; GE and SNECMA were two weeks away from freezing development had that order not materialized. This decision marked the first commercial purchase (rather than government/military) of the engine, and Delta Air Lines and Flying Tiger Line soon followed suit, giving the CFM56 a firm footing in both the military and commercial realms.|$|E
