25|$|Shareholders {{were given}} the option of either one Clearly Canadian share per Sun-Rype share, or $1.61 {{and a half of}} a Clearly Canadian share per Sun-Rype share. This offer finally gave true {{financial}} value to the shares, inclining many shareholders to sell them. Both Sun-Rype's board of directors and the BC Fruit Growers Association argued against the takeover attempt to shareholders, and on July 18, the board of directors offered an 18–page document detailing why shareholders should refrain from selling. On July 24, just days later, Clearly Canadian also sent out <b>a</b> <b>document</b> <b>describing</b> to shareholders why they should sell their shares. Both of these documents contained invalid and misleading information about each company, such as share values and purchase options to shareholders, so on July 31, the British Columbia Securities Commission issued an order for both companies to correct the statements.|$|E

Both the White House and a campaign official denied that Smith was working for them. Bannon and Conway strongly denied having any connection with Smith's effort. Flynn did not comment.|$|E

Further details were also released about reviews for users, including {{that they will be}} able to rate and review apps in the apps themselves rather than being redirected to the App Store, and that they can mark other users' reviews as [...] "Helpful" [...] or [...] "Not Helpful". Apple published <b>a</b> <b>document</b> <b>describing</b> proper ways to respond for developers, including being timely, clear and concise, prioritize certain forms of reviews (low-star ratings, certain countries or recent reviews) through filtering in iTunes Connect, and that developer responses go through an approval process before being published. Developers are also forbidden from manipulating or incentivizing feedback. Developer responses are listed in the App Store as a line underneath the respective user's review, and users receive a notification/email upon a response from the respective developer, with the option to update their review.|$|E
