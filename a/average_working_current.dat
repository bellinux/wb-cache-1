40|$|This study {{examined}} verbal declarative memory functioning in SLI {{and its relationship}} to working memory. Encoding, recall, and recognition of verbal information was examined in children with SLI who had below <b>average</b> <b>working</b> memory (SLILow WM), children with SLI who had <b>average</b> <b>working</b> memory (SLIAvg. WM) and, a group of non-language impaired children with <b>average</b> <b>working</b> memory (TDAvg. WM). The SLILow WM group was significantly worse than both the SLIAvg. WM and TDAvg. WM groups at encoding verbal information and at retrieving verbal information following a delay. In contrast, the SLIAvg. WM group showed no verbal declarative memory deficits. The study demonstrates that verbal declarative memory deficits in SLI only occur when verbal working memory is impaired. Thus SLI declarative memory is largely intact and deficits are likely to be related to working memory impairments...|$|R

The issue is explored by using data from six industries from 1960 to 1996. The main empirical result is that both an increase in labour productivity and a widening of the tax wedge have contributed to a decline in <b>average</b> <b>working</b> time in Finland. These observations are consistent with the predictions of a theoretical model that is based on the notion of equilibrium working hours. 1...|$|R

30|$|Due to the {{enormous}} increase of the part-time rate the average hours worked of all employees (without secondary jobs) decreased from 1470 h in 1991 to 1285 h in 2014 (− 185  h or 12.6 [*]%). If the <b>average</b> <b>working</b> time of all employees is compared to the <b>average</b> <b>working</b> time of full-time employees, then the increasing importance of the part-time effect becomes evident. From 1991 to 2014, the part-time effect increased from 173 to 372  h (Fig.  9). 13 As a consequence, {{the decline of the}} average annual hours worked of all employees in the last 25  years is not the result of pure working time reductions, but rather results from structural changes in employment.|$|R
