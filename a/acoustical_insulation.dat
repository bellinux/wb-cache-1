40|$|In {{the field}} of {{biobased}} materials, vegetal wools present interesting <b>acoustical</b> properties for <b>insulation</b> and absorption purposes in buildings. These materials are characterized by a large dimensional variability of their natural fibers. Moreover, they often include a proportion of polymer fibers {{in order to ensure}} the cohesion of the wools, but that may have an influence on their acoustical performances. However, acoustical models have been specially developed and applied to the case of conventional homogeneous fibrous material having homogeneous fibers. In this paper, to optimize the acoustical performances of vegetal wools, a model taking into account two types of fibers (vegetal and polymer) based on a composite Tarnow approach is proposed. This model has been validated by comparison with experimental measurements on two different vegetal wools (flax and hemp). Finally, the interest of the model in the optimization process of acoustical performances of vegetal wools is estimated thanks to simulations of the sound absorption coefficient for a large range of porosities and vegetal fiber radii...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the first estimations on the resonance frequency time depending {{and the influence}} of a pre-load in dynamic stiffness measurement. A resilient layer in a floating floor could suffer deflection under the slab weight: pliability or fibres breakage in a resilient layer induces a static deflection decrease (thus a relative resonance frequency increase) and, as a consequence, deteriorates the acoustical properties of the insulation layer. Dynamic stiffness is the most important parameter for assessing the <b>acoustical</b> properties of <b>insulation</b> of layers used in floating floors; dynamic stiffness influences the reduction in impact sound pressure level in a floating floor. Besides, the correlation between the elasticity (or the internal damping) of the insulation layers and the insulation curve slope has been examined.

40|$|Interest is {{expanding}} {{in the use}} of sandwich constructions for structural applications. Sandwich constructions, consisting of two thin, stiff faces separated by a thick lightweight core, are generally known for their great efficiency in providing stiffness at low weight. Core materials are traditionally cellular solids [...] honeycombs or foams. With the recent development of processes to manufacture foams from molten metals, metallic foams have been proposed as a candidate for sandwich cores. Metallic foams are attractive candidate core materials due to the ease with which they may be formed into complex shapes, as well as their qualities of impact resistance, <b>acoustical</b> damping, thermal <b>insulation,</b> and fire resistance. In this study, the failure behavior of metallic foam core sandwich beams is examined. Several different modes of failure are analyzed: face yielding, face wrinkling, core yielding, and indentation.

40|$|Since their {{discovery}} in the 1930 s, polymeric foams {{have been widely}} used in the industry for a variety of applications such as <b>acoustical</b> and thermal <b>insulation,</b> filters, absorbents etc. The reason for this ascending trend can be attributed to factors such as cost, ease of processing and a high strength to weight ratio compared to non-foamed polymers. The purpose of this project was to develop an “indestructible” material made of polycarbonate (PC) for industrial applications. Due to the high price of polycarbonate, two foaming methods were investigated {{to reduce the amount of}} material used. Samples were foamed physically in supercritical CO 2 or chemically with 5 -phenyl- 1 H-tetrazole. After thermal characterization of the foams in differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), we saw that none of the foaming methods had an influence on the glass transition of polycarbonate. Micrographs taken in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that foams obtained in physical and chemical foaming had different structures. Indeed, samples foamed in supercritical CO 2 exhibited a microcellular opened-cell structure with a high cell density and a homogeneous cell distribution. On the other hand, samples foamed with 5 -phenyl- 1 H-tetrazole had a macrocellular closed-cell structure with a much smaller cell density and a random cell distribution. Compression testing showed that polycarbonate foamed physically had a compression modulus a lot greater. Then, XLPE mesh 35 or 50 and wollastonite were added to the polymeric matrices to enhance the foaming process and the mechanical properties. DSC experiments showed that the addition of fillers changed the thermal properties of polycarbonate for both foaming methods by inducing a shift in glass transition. SEM revealed that fillers lowered the average cell diameter and increased the cell density. This phenomenon increased the compression modulus for polycarbonate foamed in supercritical CO 2. However, mechanical properties decreased for samples foamed with 5 -phenyl- 1 H-tetrazole due to their relative brittleness and the propagation of microcracks...|$|R

40|$|Two {{types of}} cement-based {{functional}} composites, thermal insulation and <b>acoustical</b> <b>insulation</b> materials, {{have been developed}} and characterized in this thesis. For thermal insulation material, paraffin and foam plastic beads had been incorporated into a short fiber reinforced cementitious composite. The extrusion technique is utilized to manufacture the composite panels. A series of heat transfer tests under both steady and transient condition is performed by using a controlled-environment multi-test facility. A combined conduction-convection system is arranged in the tests to evaluate the effect of paraffin and foam incorporation. The test results have proved that the foam can reduce the overall thermal conductivity of the composites and the paraffin can enhance the thermal capacity of the materials during transient period. These lead to a good heat insulation property. For <b>acoustical</b> <b>insulation</b> material, lead spheres coated with silicone rubber are used as coarse aggregates. The lead ball is a heavy mass and the silicone rubber behaves as a soft spring. The coated lead spheres are embedded into a short fiber reinforced cement-based matrix.

And thus the sound transmission through the panel can be greatly reduced. Therefore, the composite panel improves <b>acoustical</b> <b>insulation</b> by the localized resonant excitation...|$|E

40|$|<b>Acoustical</b> <b>insulation</b> and {{absorption}} {{properties of}} nonwoven fabrics depend on fiber geometry and fiber arrangement within the fabric structure. The {{different structures of}} the fibers result in different total surface areas of nonwoven fabrics. Nonwoven fabrics such as vertically lapped fabrics are ideal materials for use as <b>acoustical</b> <b>insulation</b> products, because they have high total surface. Vertically lapped nonwoven technology consists of carding, perpendicular layering of the carded webs, and through-air bonding using synthetic binder fibers. The surface area of the fabric {{is directly related to}} the denier and cross-sectional shape of the fibers in the fabric. Smaller deniers yield more fibers per unit weight of the material, higher total fiber surface area, and greater possibilities for a sound wave to interact with the fibers in the fabric structure. The research in the literature uses two methods for measuring acoustical properties of fabric materials: the impedance tube and reverberation room method. Small test samples are in the impedance tube method and sound absorption coefficient is determined at each frequency. Large reverberation rooms and large test samples are used for the reverberation room method.

Currently, to alleviate the road traffic noise damage, a demand for installation of soundproofing walls is rising. Among different shapes of soundproof walls being installed, the reflection-type <b>acoustical</b> <b>insulation</b> panel is highly drawing attentions of residents {{due to the fact that}} it does not obstruct their field of vision in contrast with the opaque <b>acoustical</b> <b>insulation</b> panel.

Therefore, in this research, study has been carried out to improve the forms in order to minimize travelling of reflected sounds through changing the frontal surface shape and geometrical shape of the reflection-type soundproofing panel. A result from comparison between the normal reflection-type soundproofing panel and the improved soundproofing panel, with reduction effects in the noise reflection, showed that the curved type of soundproofing panel has an impact on reducing the noise up to 1. 5 dB. Furthermore, from the research conducted, it appears that the increase and decrease in the reflected sounds can be changeable depending on various design factors.
