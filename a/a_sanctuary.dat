5|$|Plume {{harvesting}} {{became a}} dangerous business. The Audubon Society became {{concerned with the}} amount of hunting being done in rookeries in the mangrove forests. In 1902, they hired a warden, Guy Bradley, to watch the rookeries around Cuthbert Lake. Bradley had lived in Flamingo within the Everglades, and was murdered in 1905 by one of his neighbors after he tried to prevent him from hunting. Protection of birds was the reason for establishing the first wildlife refuge when President Theodore Roosevelt set Pelican Island as <b>a</b> <b>sanctuary</b> in 1903.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} writing mentioning this site is from William Worcester in about 1480 when {{he referred to}} it as Myghell-borough. A medieval church dedicated to St Michael, belonging to the Athelney Abbey, dates from at least the mid-15th century. This formed <b>a</b> <b>sanctuary</b> for royalist troops in 1642 and 1645 during the English Civil War, and a detachment of the king's army occupied it in 1685 {{during the course of the}} Monmouth Rebellion.|$|E
5|$|The {{rulers of}} the Middle Kingdom (c. 2055–1650BC) {{continued}} building pyramids and their associated complexes.

The pattern of <b>a</b> <b>sanctuary</b> lying behind a pillared hall frequently appears in Middle Kingdom temples, and sometimes these two elements are fronted by open courts, foreshadowing the standard temple layout used in later times.|$|E

5|$|Although the Palmyrenes worshiped their deities as individuals, {{some were}} {{associated}} with other gods. Bel had Astarte-Belti as his consort, and formed a triple deity with Aglibol and Yarhibol (who became a sun god in his association with Bel). Malakbel was part of many associations, pairing with Gad Taimi and Aglibol, and forming a triple deity with Baalshamin and Aglibol. Palmyra hosted an Akitu (spring festival) each Nisan. Each of the city's four-quarters had <b>a</b> <b>sanctuary</b> for a deity considered ancestral to the resident tribe; Malakbel and Aglibol's sanctuary was in the Komare quarter. The Baalshamin sanctuary was in the Ma'zin quarter, the Arsu sanctuary in the Mattabol quarter, and the Atargatis sanctuary in the fourth tribe's quarter.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th Dynasty, prince Khaemwaset, {{a son of}} Ramesses II, {{undertook}} restoration works throughout Egypt on pyramids and temples {{which had}} fallen into ruin. Inscriptions on the stone cladding of the pyramid of Sahure show that it was restored at this time. This is possibly because, from the mid 18th Dynasty onwards, the mortuary temple of Sahure served as <b>a</b> <b>sanctuary</b> for the goddess Sekhmet. In {{the second part of}} the 18th Dynasty and during the 19th Dynasty numerous visitors left inscriptions, stelae and statues in the temple. Activities seemed to have continued on-site for a long time, as shown by graffiti dating from the 26th Dynasty (664525 BC) until the Ptolemaic period (33230 BC).|$|E
5|$|In 1946, the French army {{ceased to}} use the Mérens for drawing {{artillery}} in the mountains, and this corresponded {{to the beginning of}} the decline of the breed. The population fell dramatically during the second half of the 20th century, due to the modernization and mechanization of transport and agriculture. In 1950 in Senegal, the Mérens was used in attempts to create a horse tougher than the native M'Bayar, but the breeding program was not enough to significantly increase the Mérens population. The use of the Mérens in agriculture continued into the 1970s, and like many French draft breeds, it was also bred for slaughter to produce horse meat. The mountains of Ariege acted as <b>a</b> <b>sanctuary,</b> preventing the Mérens, as well as other breeds such as Gascon cattle and Tarasconnaise sheep, from disappearing completely. By the early 1970s, however, the Mérens was on the verge of extinction.|$|E

The 2005 Adelaide Dolphin Sanctuary Act established <b>a</b> <b>sanctuary</b> for the Bottlenose dolphins that live in the inlet and adjacent Port River. The sanctuary's northern extent is the boat channel and dolphins can sometimes be seen at high tide in the tidal creeks passing under the boardwalk.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} {{began in}} 1181. The monastic quarters {{and the church}} were built over the following three decades. The central cloister was bordered on the north by the church, on the west by a barrel-vaulted great nave, on the east by the sacristy, the priory cell, and the chapter house, and on the south by the kitchen, the pantry and the refectory (dining hall). Some of the buildings were given seven-foot-thick (2m) walls with slit windows, {{to serve as a}} refuge in case the Moors returned to the area. The church was built {{in the shape of a}} Latin cross with a nave divided into four sections, and <b>a</b> <b>sanctuary</b> with three square apses.

5|$|All Saints' {{originally}} {{consisted of}} a nave and chancel, to which <b>a</b> <b>sanctuary</b> was added in the first building phase. The church was extended on three occasions between the 10th and 14th centuries– a period of population growth– to include an aisled nave, a western tower and a northern chapel; its windows featured stained glass. The church was abandoned in the 15th century, presumably because the parish could no longer support two churches. It was demolished, and virtually all of its masonry removed, {{some of which may}} have been used in improvements to the church of St Nicholas. The settlement of Shuart remained as an area of local administration into the 17th century, but it is now regarded as a deserted medieval village. There were no visible remains of All Saints' Church by 1723, although land there remained as glebe belonging to the parish of St Nicholas. The site of All Saints' Church was excavated by archaeologists between 1978 and 1979. The main structure had been robbed of its materials leaving only the foundations, from which the archaeologists were able to interpret the history of the building's construction and its form. Among the foundations were discovered numerous stone carvings, floor tiles, remnants of stained glass, and several disturbed graves.|$|E
5|$|Jimenez stopped {{feeding the}} pups after Thanksgiving that same year. Though the pups learned to hunt, Silver and Pikuni left {{the pack and}} the other four began killing livestock. They were {{captured}} to be relocated, much as their parents had been. One, Camas, escaped after waking up from the tranquilizer early. Chinook was killed for continuing to hunt livestock and Timber {{was killed by a}} poacher. Tenino, who also continued hunting livestock, was recaptured and sent to Wolf Haven International, <b>a</b> <b>sanctuary</b> in Washington State, where he lived until his death in 2001. The fates of the other cubs, as well as Rann, the cub who escaped the initial relocation, are unknown. In the epilogue of the novel, Bowen expresses hope that they survived and bred, enabling the bloodlines started with Marta and Greatfoot to continue in the wolf packs that now inhabit the area. Jimenez continued working as the Wyoming Wolf Recovery Project Leader for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service until 2008, when he was selected to be the Wyoming Game and Fish Department's Wolf Program Coordinator.|$|E
5|$|Moses Fleetwood Walker {{was born}} in 1856 in Mount Pleasant, a working-class town in Eastern Ohio that had served as <b>a</b> <b>sanctuary</b> for runaway slaves since 1815. Its {{population}} included a large Quaker community and a unique collective of former Virginian slaves. Walker's parents, Moses W. Walker and Caroline O' Harra, were both mulattos. According to Walker's biographer David W. Zang, his father came to Ohio from Pennsylvania, likely a beneficiary of Quaker patronage, and married O' Harra, who was a native to the state, on June 11, 1843. When Walker was three years old, the family moved 20 miles northeast to Steubenville where Moses W. {{became one of the}} first black physicians of Ohio and later a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church. There, Walker's fifth or sixth sibling, his younger brother Weldy, was born the same year. Walker and Weldy attended Steubenville High School in the early 1870s, just as the community passed legislation for racial integration.|$|E
