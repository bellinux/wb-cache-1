The insulation is always subjected to stresses of different types at the same point in time. Among the more important stress are, electrical, thermal and their combination. Insulating properties of both solid (cellulose paper) and liquid (mineral Insulating oil) phases deteriorate with time due to an electro-thermal process called aging. The status of insulation at a given point in time can therefore be assessed by monitoring such of those properties of insulation which are sensitive to the amount of aging, so as {{to be able to take}} and <b>appropriate</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>measures</b> to avoid/postpone impending insulation failure.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of internal controls has {{significant influence on}} the audit outcomes of public institutions, especially local municipalities. An effectively designed and implemented internal control enhances the ability to mitigate risks, and ultimately enables public institutions to achieve their predetermined objectives, to present reliable financial reporting and to comply with legislation and regulations. Without the internal controls, public institutions may experience challenges that may hinder them from achieving their performance objectives. The complementary role of the drivers of internal controls (leaders, managers and governance structures) is even more critical to strengthening internal controls. The study area at which the research activities were carried out was Roodepoort City Theatre at which three categories of documents (the general reports of the audit outcomes of the Gauteng Province local government, RCT’s annual reports and internal audit reports) were targeted for analysis using three document analysis templates.

The two cardinal control agencies include the Office of the Auditor General (OAG) and the Inspectorate of Government (IG), who are mandated to enhance public service through efficient and effective resource management, ensuring adherence to standards and regulations, and promoting responsiveness to community needs. In spite of these institutional controls, a surge of unbearable events involving abuse of authority and misuse of public resources still exists, suggesting significant managerial and capacity handicaps, not only in the internal mechanisms of LGs, but also in the external control agencies. &# 13; &# 13; This paper presents findings of a study conducted to evaluate the institutional capacity of the OAG and the IG in the enhancement of accountability in local governments (LGs) in Uganda.

Objective {{of the study was to}} assess the status of logistics availability on Village Health and Nutrition Day (VHND) in rural areas of Tapi district and Surat city areas. Methods: This cross sectional study was conducted during September 2013 to February 2014. Out of 28 Primary Health Centres (PHCs) of Tapi district 9 were selected and out of 40 Urban Health Centres (UHCs) of Surat City, 16 were selected by random number table. Checklist of essential logistics for VHND was prepared and used to collect the data. Results: Logistics used during Antenatal care like sphygmomanometer, stethoscope, examination table, measure tape and adult weighing scale were available at more VHND session in rural areas compared to urban session sites. Medications like iron folic acid tablets, paracetamol tablets and calcium tablets were present in more than three forth of the session at both urban as well as rural areas. Availability of Zinc tablets and cotrimoxazole tablets were very poor in urban area in contrary to rural area where they were available at almost all VHND session.

The system consists of a 2 ̆ 2 mouse 2 ̆ 2 and a 2 ̆ 2 cheese 2 ̆ 2 in a two dimensional maze which are viewed by a video camera connected to a frame grabber board in a personal computer (PC). The maze {{is designed to be}} alterable during the mouse 2 ̆ 7 s navigation towards the 2 ̆ 2 cheese 2 ̆ 2 or target. The pc runs the frame grabber software which analyzes the maze to find the cheese, mouse and movement options during traversal. Parameters about the mouse 2 ̆ 7 s position, the maze constraints {{in the vicinity of the}} mouse and the general direction of the target are passed to a Prolog search algorithm which makes decisions on the next course of action for the mouse. Parameters on the movement of the mouse are passed via a serial port to a single board computer which controls the mouse 2 ̆ 7 s motion with two stepper motors. The intent is to investigate the integration of a simple real time control system with an intelligent host before expanding the system to handle more complex control algorithms where the computational requirements could easily overpower a single processor.

40|$|Tutorialpg. 81 The use of {{variable}} frequency drives (VFD) in pumping applications with variable-duty requirements provides the user {{with a variety of}} benefits, including potentially significant energy savings and improved reliability achieved by means of speed reduction and avoiding part-flow operation. Energy savings are primarily realized by running the equipment at high levels of efficiency and optimal operating speeds, matching the generated pump head to the exact system requirements without the use of energy consuming control valves. Running pumps at lower operating speeds and avoiding part-flow operation also positively influences component life and between maintenance intervals. The primary mechanical challenge of any VFD applications the wide continuous operating speed range. Excitation frequencies of fixed speed applications miss most natural frequencies of the structure, rotor, etc., and therefore potentially harmful resonance conditions often do not occur. This is no longer the case with VFD applications, where excitation frequencies become variable and the likelihood of encountering resonance conditions is greatly increased. Problems and failures in pumps and associated systems that are not caused by resonance are generally not VFD related and are therefore not discussed. The paper gives an overview of medium-voltage VFD technology as well as the main categories of resonance conditions of concern with regard to mechanical vibrations of pump/motor sets. The analytical and experimental identification of resonances related to lateral rotor, torsional rotor, structural, and acoustic dynamics are discussed in detail. The applicable set of analyses and, if necessary, the corresponding <b>appropriate</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>measures,</b> are designed to help ensure operation free of harmful resonance conditions and problems caused by excessive mechanical vibrations...|$|R

The goal of these tests is not only to provide a better diagnosis, but also to improve communication with the owner, and also to give a quick therapeutic answer or a prognosis. The ancillary exams have to be profitable for both the owner and the practitioner. It can be done at an individual or herd level to demonstrate the subclinical diseases. The benefits of field-tests are essentially saving time, and for some assays, saving money as well, with relatively accurate analyses. In order to adapt to the situation, it is advised to know the sensitivity and specificity of the tests before doing the analysis. In some cases it is necessary to have a better sensitivity or specificity to adapt to goals: avoiding false-positive or false-negative results. A good specificity of a test is required while looking for a diagnosis, as for a screening approach, a good sensitivity is preferred.

Strains of E. coli O 157 were characterized by hybridization with DNA probes for VT 1, VT 2 and eaeA, plasmid profile analysis, phage typing and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Verocytotoxin-producing E. coli O 157 strains were isolated from faecal samples from a cow, a horse, 3 breeds of pigs, 2 breeds of sheep and 2 breeds of goats and from 2 samples of compost which had been processed for 3 months. All strains were phage type 21, hybridized with probes for VT 2 and eaeA but not with one for VT 1, harboured 92 and 2 kb plasmids and gave indistinguishable banding patterns with PFGE.

40|$|Modern {{technology}} is increasingly leading to complex artifacts with high demands on performance and availability. As a consequence, advanced automation and control methods {{play an important}} role in achieving these requirements. Key for automation and control is to know the operational state of an artifact in order to take the <b>appropriate</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>measures.</b> Often, however, it is not possible or desirable to measure all physical entities that determine the state of the system. So that the missing information has to be inferred from noisy measurements and a mathematical model of the physical system. The Kalman filter [1] is surely the most prominent example for this task of filtering and estimation. A Kalman filter utilizes a stochastic model of the system under investigation and estimates, in some optimal sense, the physical entities that determine the state of a system. When applied to real-world systems, however, one has to deal with changing operational conditions and a possible set of operational modes with significantly different dynamic behavior. A standard Kalman filter, however, can only cope with a single operational mode where its stochastic model matches the exhibited dynamic behavior of the system. A standard approach to deal with mode changes and abruptly varying dynamics is to utilize multiple filters, one for each operational mode, and apply some sort of hypothesis selection/merging to deduce the appropriate estimate of the system’s state according to the individual estimates of the multiple filters. This multiple model approach executes filters for all possible modes concurrently so that any realistic real-time implementation limits the number of operational modes to a moderately large set of modes. This limitation, to capture a system by few operational modes only, is appropriate for many applications, however, todays complex artifacts, such as autonomous robots, space-probes, or production plants, impose new demands that go beyond the scope of standard multiple model estimation. Those systems are composed of many individual components and achieve their complex and high performance behavior by applying advanced control and automation schemes that utilize complex interactions among the components. This leads to overall systems with an overwhelming number of possible operationa...|$|R
40|$|Background & objectives: Ingestion of Cleistanthus collinus causes {{hypokalemia}} and cardiac arrhythmias {{leading to}} mortality in most cases. We undertook this retrospective study {{to evaluate the}} clinical presentation and predictors of outcome in critically ill patients admitted with C. collinus poisoning. Methods: The case records of 56 patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) of a tertiary care teaching hospital in south India (2000 - 2014) with C. collinus poisoning were retrospectively analysed. Results: The mean age of patients was 36. 7 ± 13. 3 yr; there were 30 males. Salient clinical manifestations included hypokalemia (58 %), neutrophilic leucocytosis (48. 2 %), acute kidney injury (AKI) (42. 9 %), acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation (AcRFMv) (32. 1 %), shock (21. 4 %); cardiac arrhythmias and neuromuscular weakness (19. 6 % each); 21 patients (37. 5 %) had adverse outcome. Longer time-lapsed from consumption to reaching emergency room [median (interquartile range) ] (hours) [49 (22 - 97) vs. 28 (7 - 56), p = 0. 0380]; higher acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score at presentation [14 (8. 25 - 14. 75) vs. 2 (0 - 6) P< 0. 001]; and presence of the following [odds ratio (95 % confidence intervals) ] at initial presentation: shock [37. 40 (4. 29 - 325. 98), P= 0. 001]; AcRFMv [26. 67 (5. 86 - 121. 39), P< 0. 001]; elevated alanine aminotransferase [5. 71 (1. 30 - 25. 03), p 0 = 0. 021]; metabolic acidosis [5. 48 (1. 68 - 17. 89), P= 0. 005]; acute kidney injury (AKI) [5 (1. 55 - 16. 06), P= 0. 007]; hyponatremia [4. 67 (1. 25 - 17. 44), P= 0. 022]; and neutrophilic leucocytosis [3. 80 (1. 02 - 14. 21), P= 0. 047] predicted death. A significant (P< 0. 001) increasing trend in mortality was observed with increasing International Program on Chemical Safety Poisoning Severity Score (IPCS-CSS) grade. Interpretation & conclusions: C. collinus is a lethal poison associated with high mortality {{for which there is}} no specific antidote. Careful search and meticulous monitoring of the predictors of death and initiating <b>appropriate</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>measures</b> can be life saving...|$|R
40|$|Protective {{clothing}} {{is required in}} the food-processing industry, to protect workers from contamination by bacteria, fungi, viruses, prions etc. contained in the secretions and raw meat of slaughtered animals, {{and to protect the}} meat from being contaminated by microorganisms carried by the workers. It is well-understood that textiles are a control point (CP), and must be appropriately cleaned and disinfected in order to prevent biocontamination. Although the laundering procedure itself is important for achieving disinfection, it is also essential to maintain an appropriate hygiene level in the laundry, in order to prevent recontamination of textiles by environmental viable microorganisms. In this study, a sanitary-microbiological analysis was carried out in selected CPs in two laundries. Chemo-thermal washing efficiency was determined by evaluating the anti-bacterial effect against Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus aureus. The hygienic state of the laundries was determined by evaluating the number and type of microorganisms at selected CPs throughout the whole laundering procedure. The results indicated that the sanitary condition of both laundries did not reach the required levels and that several microbes were resistant to cleaning and disinfecting agents. It is obvious from the results that achievement of an appropriate hygiene level during laundering textiles from the food processing industry requires the implementation of <b>appropriate</b> <b>corrective</b> monitoring <b>measures...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{problematic}} {{areas of}} the teaching of Korean as a foreign language have been largely neglected in the past. Few studies combine the following three aspects: 1) an examination of learner Korean; 2) the provision of substantial linguistic and pedagogical explanations; and 3) the devising of teaching or learning strategies based on empirical evidence. By studying KFL learners and their language production, insights can be gained relating to the learning of KFL and instructors {{will be able to}} provide <b>appropriate</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>measures.</b> This study investigated errors produced by KFL learners, focusing primarily on high frequency orthographic, lexical and grammatical errors in written language production. The study attempts to identify key areas of difficulty in learning Korean, to investigate the possible cause of difficulties and to provide more adequate information for the teaching and learning of KFL. To this end the study uses two classes of textual data and employs both statistical and descriptive analyses. At an orthographic level the study has identified four main error categories: 1) mismatch in three series consonants, 2) mismatch in vowel sounds, 3) misuse of nasals and laterals, and 4) omission and addition of h. Overall the cause of key error types correlates strongly with the differences in sound quality and sound patterns between Korean and English, with some intralingual features. At a lexical level, the study found nine types of errors including 1) semantic similarity, 2) lexical misselection and 3) overgeneralization. The findings suggest that learners {{have a great deal of}} difficulty in differentiating lexical items with similar meaning and in selecting words appropriate to particular contexts or situations. As for grammatical errors, the study identified the five most active error categories, which made up more than 80 % of the total grammatical errors. An overwhelming majority of grammatical errors and case particle errors in particular were errors of substitution. Many high frequency grammatical errors had distinctive triggering factors such as particular types of verb and sentence construction. The findings of the study have several pedagogical implications. First, there are key common errors for English L 1 -KFL learners and these common errors need increased linguistic and pedagogical attention. Secondly, the results reinforce the need to pay more active attention to the usage of the main case particles, along with the triggering constructions causing substitutions. Thirdly, the findings suggest that different types of analysis should be done in order to facilitate a plausible description of the problematic KFL items. The study argues that despite being problematic, the items discussed in this thesis are learnable and worthy of being taught with explicit or intentional strategies and that there is a need for pedagogically effective and adequate instructional input to maximize the potential of the learners language development in Korean...|$|R

There used to exist a strong ecological harmony between man (homosapiens) and its environment. With increasing globalisation of the African economy and Cameroon’s economy in particular, the symbiotic relationship has increasingly been threatened, as the economy incurs both huge social and environmental cost. Using Cameroon as and example, the paper examines markets, institutions and policy failures in timber exploitation, trade and environment between the partial equilibrium framework. From the analysis the paper shows that this failures result in unsustainable timber trade and among other things created heavy environmental costs. The paper discusses the <b>appropriate</b> policies and <b>corrective</b> <b>measures</b> including timber certification, which can better forest management in timber exploitation and brings out {{the role of the}} environmental conscious countries of the Developed countries as we enter the next millennium. 1) Introduction and the Importance of forests All tropical forests are located in the LDCs, and are very important for human and other forms of life in the whole world- a global asset.
