Power grid dispatching automation system must have high availability and reliability to ensure the uninterrupted operation of system. This paper analyzed the application status of present power grid dispatching automation system and proposed a method based on virtualization technology to realize high availability. It also provided the architecture design of system and the concrete realization method of high availability. With the comparison of new method and existing system, it could be found that new method not only has high availability and fast failure recovery function, but also could greatly increase resource utilization rate of physical machine cluster. Therefore, it can better satisfy the high <b>availability</b> <b>request</b> of power grid dispatching automation system...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The World Wide Web (WWW) {{is growing}} {{exponentially}} {{in terms of}} number of users and number of Web applications. Due to enormous traffic in the network and several factors like bandwidth <b>availability,</b> <b>request</b> processing time at server, round trip time and object size, the Web latency is increasing. The sophisticated integration of Web prefetching and caching deployed at proxy server with Web log mining technique is the most attractive and successful solution to reduce this latency and improve Web Quality of Service. To provide uninterrupted services to the Web users’, Web servers at the data centres are seamlessly operating always in 24 X 7 mode. Low power consumption and efficient energy management of individual hardware components, system software, to network applications is a critical and urgent issue in today’s highly demanding eco-friendly computing world. In this paper, we incorporate an energy efficient feedback driven control framework along with sleep proxy mechanism in our Hybrid Cache-Prefetch System Model. The proposed model periodically monitors proxy server performance parameters dynamically. We have also developed an optimized load allocation algorithm with the proposed combined strategy for proxy servers ’ cluster along with some guidelines for energy efficient design solutions to-wards green IT. Even though we emphasize power saving {{as much as possible}} the performance of proxy servers is ensured without sacrificing on client experiences. Experimental results show that using our proposed scheme 28 % less power consumption and 18 % power efficiency improvement can be achieved...|$|E

40|$|Abstract ⎯ Dependable {{distributed}} systems {{are difficult to}} build. This is particularly true if they have dependability requirements that change during the execution of an application, and are built with commercial off-the-shelf hardware. In that case, fault tolerance must be achieved using middleware software, and mechanisms must be provided to communicate the dependability requirements of a distributed application to the system and to adapt the system’s configuration to try to achieve the desired dependability. The AQuA architecture allows distributed applications to request a desired level of availability using the Quality Objects (QuO) framework and includes a dependability manager that attempts to meet <b>requested</b> <b>availability</b> levels by configuring the system in response to outside requests and changes in system resources due to faults. The AQuA architecture uses the QuO runtime to process and invoke <b>availability</b> <b>requests,</b> the Proteus dependability manager to configure the system in response to faults and <b>availability</b> <b>requests,</b> and the Ensemble protocol stack to provide group communication services. Furthermore, a CORBA interface is provided to application objects using the AQuA gateway. The gateway provides a mechanism to translate between process-level communication, as supported by Ensemble, and IIOP messages, understood by Object Request Brokers. Both active and passive replication are supported, and the replication type to use is chosen based on the performance and dependability requirements of particular distributed applications. 1...|$|R

The simulation results show the dynamic programming algorithm can achive a good balance between the access latency and the <b>requested</b> <b>availability.</b> When the <b>request</b> is more concentrated, the dynamic programming algorithm can have better performance than the MODULO and LRU both in access latency and <b>requested</b> <b>availability...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Recent {{research}} in opportunistic networks address the diffusion {{policy and the}} practicality considerations in utilizing device-specific applications. Intermittent connectivity between mobile nodes and the random behavioral patterns of the users, make modeling and measuring the performance of opportunistic networks very challenging {{particularly in the case}} of file/object sharing among these devices. As the cache-and-forward replication policy plays a major role targeting the <b>availability</b> of <b>requested</b> resources, there should be a mechanism for controlling the minimization of the redundant replicas and the uncontrolled diffusion effects onto the communicating nodes. In this work the diffusion policy of requested replicated objects is examined with regards to the probabilistic synchronized movement of the devices, quantifying the parameters that affect the reliable transmission and the <b>availability</b> of <b>requested</b> resources by any node. The assigned scheme takes into consideration the movement synchronization of the moving devices and applies a recursive adaptive caching cooperation scheme in community-oriented relay regions. The scheme also uses the Message Ferry (MF) mobile Peer in a bi-directional mode, in order to enable higher degree of reliability in the <b>availability</b> of the <b>requested</b> resources. Conducted simulation experiments using real-time traffic traces show that the proposed scheme offers high throughput and reliability response for sharing resources on-the-move while it minimizes the redundancy of replications.

50|$|The kernel always {{runs with}} maximum {{privileges}} {{since it is}} the operating system core and has hardware access. One of the principal responsibilities of an operating system, particularly a multi-user operating system, is management of the hardware's <b>availability</b> and <b>requests</b> to access it from running processes. When the kernel crashes, the mechanisms by which it maintains state also fail. Even if there is a way for the CPU to recover without a hard reset, the code that resumes execution is not always what it should be. Security continues to be enforced, but the operating system cannot respond to the failure properly because detection of the failure was not possible. This is because kernel execution either halted or the program counter resumed execution from somewhere in endless, and—usually—non-functional loop.|$|R

40|$|Satisfaction {{level of}} {{femtocell}} users' {{depends on the}} <b>availability</b> of <b>requested</b> bandwidth. But the xDSL line {{that can be used}} for the backhauling of femtocell traffic cannot always provide sufficient bandwidth due to the inequality between the xDSL capacity and demanded bandwidth of home applications like, IPTV, PC, WiFi, and others. A Service Level Agreement (SLA) between xDSL and femtocell operator (mobile operator) to reserve some bandwidth for the upcoming femtocell calls can increase the satisfaction level for femtocell users. In this paper we propose a SLA negotiation procedure for femtocell networks. The Bandwidth Broker controls the allocated bandwidth for femtocell users. Then we propose the dynamically reserve bandwidth scheme to increase the femtocell user's satisfaction level. Finally, we present our simulation results to validate the proposed scheme.

We also construct a cross-nationally comparable classification of procedural barriers that limit abortion access. Our cross-national comparison shows that Western-Europe witnessed a general trend towards decreased restrictiveness of abortion laws. However, legal approaches to regulating abortion are highly different in detail.
