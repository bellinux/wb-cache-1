2500|$|During the Renaissance, {{truffles}} regained {{popularity in}} Europe and were honoured <b>at</b> <b>the</b> court of King Francis I of France. However, {{it was not}} until the 17th century that Western (and in particular French) cuisine abandoned [...] "heavy" [...] oriental spices, and rediscovered the natural flavour of foodstuffs. Truffles were very popular in Parisian markets in the 1780s. They were imported seasonally from truffle grounds, where peasants had long enjoyed their secret. Brillat-Savarin (1825) noted characteristically that they were so expensive they appeared only <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dinner</b> <b>tables</b> of great nobles and kept women.

5|$|In Roman times, {{poisoning}} {{carried out}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dinner</b> <b>table</b> or common eating or drinking area was not unheard of, or even uncommon, and was happening {{as early as}} 331 BC. These poisonings would {{have been used for}} self-advantageous reasons in every class of the social order. The writer Livy describes the poisoning of members of the upper class and nobles of Rome, and Roman emperor Nero is known to have favored the use of poisons on his relatives, even hiring a personal poisoner. His preferred poison was said to be cyanide.|$|E
5|$|Poison was {{discovered}} in ancient times, and was used by ancient tribes and civilizations as a hunting tool to quicken and ensure {{the death of their}} prey or enemies. This use of poison grew more advanced, and many of these ancient peoples began forging weapons designed specifically for poison enhancement. Later in history, particularly {{at the time of the}} Roman Empire, one of the more prevalent uses was assassination. As early as 331 BC, poisonings executed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dinner</b> <b>table</b> or in drinks were reported, and the practice became a common occurrence. The use of fatal substances was seen among every social class; even the nobility would often use it to dispose of unwanted political or economic opponents.|$|E

25|$|Field of Empty Chairs: 168 empty chairs hand-crafted from glass, bronze, {{and stone}} {{represent}} {{those who lost}} their lives, with a name etched in the glass base of each. They sit on {{the site where the}} Murrah Building once stood. The chairs represent <b>the</b> empty chairs <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dinner</b> <b>tables</b> of <b>the</b> victims' families. The chairs are arranged in nine rows to symbolize the nine floors of the building; each person's chair is on the row (or the floor) on which the person worked or was located when the bomb went off. The chairs are also grouped according to the blast pattern, with the most chairs nearest the most heavily damaged portion of the building. The westernmost column of five chairs represents the five people who died but were not in the Murrah Building (two in the Water Resources Board building, one in the Athenian Building, one outside near the building, and one rescuer). The 19 smaller chairs represent the children killed in the bombing. Three unborn children died along with their mothers, and they are listed on their mothers' chairs beneath their mothers' names.|$|R

50|$|Donati {{lived in}} the {{tradition}} of the great Florentine painters of the past who thought of painting as a profession like any other in which success depended on whether their work was liked by other people. So Lazzaro Donati himself worked in his studio creating, experimenting, changing, destroying the mistakes and hoping to sell the successes. Away from his studio he enjoyed an active social life. Warm-hearted and charming, he was equally <b>at</b> home <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ambassador’s <b>dinner</b> <b>table</b> or <b>at</b> <b>the</b> trattoria in the square.|$|R

60|$|The company {{promoter}} {{was just}} passing their table. He turned around <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{sound of his}} name. For a moment he failed to recognize Burton.

It was part of his business, however, to remember faces, and his natural aptitude came to his assistance.|$|R

Only three copies were sold, of {{which one was}} purchased by Fredrick Enoch, a resident of Cornmarket, Warwick, who in admiration, wrote to the publisher to request an autograph – the only extant single document carrying the three author's signatures in their pseudonyms, and they continued creating their prose, each one producing a book a year later. The three girls always worked in secret, unceasingly discussing their writing for hours <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dinner</b> <b>table,</b> after which their father would open the door at 9 p. m. with Don't stay up late, Girls!, then rewinding the clock and taking the stairs to his room upstairs.|$|E

25|$|Yasuna's unique affliction to {{be unable}} to see males is changed from the manga to the anime. While in the manga Yasuna says she has never once {{been able to see}} males {{completely}} clearly (Hazumu being the only slight exception), Yasuna explains in the anime that she at one time was able to see males, but one day she could not see her father anymore after he got angry with her as a child, and it escalated from there to encompass all males. Additionally, in the eleventh anime episode, Yasuna becomes unable to see females as well, though this is later rectified in episode twelve when Yasuna is completely healed and is able to see both males and females. In the anime, Yasuna is shown to be terrified of males, even those in her own class, but in the manga she merely pays very little attention to males around her, even when spoken to directly, or otherwise ignores males completely. In the anime, Yasuna is shown at one time accidentally ignoring her father <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dinner</b> <b>table,</b> but the only time Yasuna is shown speaking to her father in the manga has her smiling to him.|$|E
