30|$|There {{are several}} {{strategies}} to decrease glass particle contamination when using <b>glass</b> <b>ampules.</b> Filter needle syringes {{have been introduced}} into practice and are recommended for special patient care, such as neonatal patient care to maximize patient safety (Heiss-Harris and Verklan 2005). The use of prefilled syringe drugs {{may also be a}} useful method to prevent glass particle contamination in peripheral intravenous admixtures (Yorioka et al. 2006). It has been recommended that wiping <b>glass</b> <b>ampules</b> with alcohol before opening should be a routine part of neuraxial anaesthesia to reduce the contamination of <b>glass</b> <b>ampules</b> (Hemingway et al. 2007). Glass or inorganic particulate contaminants may be reduced by opening <b>glass</b> <b>ampules</b> using a vacuum machine, especially small-sized particles which may not be removed with membrane filters (Lee et al. 2011). The American Society of Health-system Pharmacists (ASHP) guidelines recommend that 5  µm filter straws or filter needles be used when aspirating the contents of ampules to minimize particulate contamination (ASHP guidelines on compounding sterile preparations 2014). The policies regarding the use of filter needles vary between institutions and countries, and filter needles are often not used because they are expensive and cumbersome. There have been many prior studies of glass particle contamination during the opening of <b>glass</b> <b>ampules.</b> The main focus of these studies was the side effect of glass particles in the body or the degree of glass particle contamination. The degree of <b>glass</b> <b>ampule</b> particle contamination has been studied based on the ampule size and the opening method of <b>glass</b> <b>ampules,</b> the size of injection needles, and the use of filters (Caudron et al. 2011; Shaw and Lyall 1985; Carbone-Traber and Shanks 1986; Preston and Hegadoren 2004; Heiss-Harris and Verklan 2005; Turco and Davis 1972; Purdie and Punchihewa 1982; Pinnock 1984).|$|R

30|$|Medication is an {{important}} and basic duty for health care professionals. It {{is the responsibility of}} a nurse to administrate drugs safely and accurately to the patient. Many drugs are manufactured as a <b>glass</b> <b>ampule</b> due to its sterility and portability, and often premeasured as a single dose. However, glass particles may be introduced during the manufacturing, opening, and injection of <b>glass</b> <b>ampules</b> (Caudron et al. 2011). These particles can cause various harmful side effects when they circulate in the body. Injected glass particles can travel through the blood vessels to arrive at various organs, and cause inflammatory responses. They are known to cause blockages, embolism, tissue necrosis, and sepsis (Brewer and Dunning 1947; Shaw and Lyall 1985; Carbone-Traber and Shanks 1986; Preston and Hegadoren 2004). In spite of these risks, <b>glass</b> <b>ampules</b> are commonly used for injections.|$|R

However, there are other commonly used methods to inject drugs into the vein, such as direct IV bolus injection, side shooting into the Y-shape injection port of the infusion set with in-line filter, and infusion after mixing the drug with other IV solutions, as well as using an intermittent infusion device such as injection adapter caps. For inpatients, side shooting using a Y-shape infusion set or infusion after mixing the drug with other IV solution is more frequently used than direct IV bolus injection. Y-shape infusion sets for side shooting commonly contain a 15  µm filter {{at the end of}} the set, but filters of various sizes are used in different hospitals and departments.

In this study, the factors contributing to accidents were analyzed to compare the interrelationships; these factors demonstrated that the highest incidence of accidents is among nurses in the age group twenty-one through thirty; for those employed {{less than six months}} or over two years accidents remained the same; the greatest number of accidents in this study occurred during the late morning and early evening hours; among days of week, Monday was found to be the highest followed by Tuesday and Friday. September and January were the months in which most accidents occurred, and the highest prevalence of accidents was found among nursing personnel in the Medical Unit and Surgical Theatre of both hospitals.

30|$|There {{have been}} many studies on glass {{particle}} contamination from <b>glass</b> <b>ampules</b> during the injection of <b>glass</b> <b>ampules,</b> but only the contamination from direct IV bolus injection has been measured. This research aimed to study the difference in glass particle contamination from ampules with different intravenous administration methods commonly used in clinical practice. Four methods were studied: IV bolus injection directly after immediate aspiration, IV bolus injection directly after 2  min’ delayed aspiration, IV bolus injection directly after aspiration with a filter needle, and side shooting to an infusion set with an in-line filter. 45 ampules per method {{for a total of}} 180 ampules were used. The number and length of glass particles were measured using a slide scanner. Aspiration was performed without specifically using a slow aspiration method. The longest glass particle was observed in the immediate aspiration group. The side shooting group showed the lowest maximum number of <b>glass</b> particles per <b>ampule.</b> The side shooting group also showed the smallest number of glass particles, but it was statistically insignificant. Using a filter needle syringe and 2  min’ delayed aspiration, which are frequently recommended to minimize contamination, may not be as effective as commonly believed, unless combined with a slow and low pressure aspiration method. Using a side shooting to an infusion set with an in-line filter may minimize glass particle contamination from ampules even without a slow and low pressure aspiration method, but more evidence from a larger study is needed.|$|R

Fertilizing capacity of frozen semen was tested with ewes in natural estrus and with ewes in estrus induced by hormonal treatment. Freezing in <b>glass</b> <b>ampules</b> at an optimum controlled rate and freezing in plastic straws on dry ice gave significantly higher postfreeze motility and percent survival than other methods used. Semen frozen in ampules at the controlled rate and thawed in ice water showed no apparent loss of viability compared to that thawed at 40 °C. Semen frozen in plastic straws on dry ice and thawed at 75 °C for 12 seconds gave viability equal to that frozen in <b>glass</b> <b>ampules</b> at the optimum controlled rate of freezing. Alpha amylase, beta amylase, and beta glucuronidase had no significant effect upon postfreeze viability when added to the extender {{at the rate of}} 10 microgram per ml.

This difference may be explained by the result of Carbone-Traber and Shanks study (Carbone-Traber and Shanks 1986), which found {{that it is important to}} aspirate fluid into a syringe slowly and by a low pressure injection method when using not only a filter needle syringe but also a side shooting to an infusion set with an in-line filter. Our study did not use any specific method to slowly aspirate ampules, and may have used a faster speed of aspiration resulting in increased aspiration pressure compared with prior studies.

The shorting bar hook, attached to the cam, shears the shorting bar (a safety device across the detonator). After a 60-second (nominal) electronic time delay, a piston actuator in the Safe and Arm mechanism is electrically fired, moving a slider to align the detonator with an explosive lead in the slider. At the same time, seven sensor triplines are released. Approximately three or four triplines will deploy up to 20 feet from the mine, depending upon the at-rest position of the mine. The remaining triplines may be hindered due to their proximity to the resting surface.

The objectives were: (1) to demonstrate that laser-induced fluorescence is a viable kinetic tool for measuring rates of deposit precursor formation in jet fuels; (2) to determine global rate expressions for the formation of thermal deposit precursors in jet fuels; and (3) to better understand the chemical mechanism of thermal stability. The fuels were isothermally stressed in small <b>glass</b> <b>ampules</b> in the 120 to 180 C range. Concentrations of deposit precursor, hydroperoxide and oxygen consumption were measured over time in the thermally stressed fuels. Deposit precursors were measured using laser-induced fluorescence (LIF), hydroperoxides using a spectrophotometric technique, and oxygen consumption by the pressure loss in the ampule. The expressions, I. P. = 1. 278 x 10 (exp - 11) exp(28, 517. 9 /RT) and R(sub dp) = 2. 382 x 10 (exp 17) exp(- 34, 369. 2 /RT) for the induction period, I. P. and rate of deposit precursor formation R(sub dp), were determined for Jet A fuel. The results of the study support a new theory of deposit formation in jet fuels, which suggest that acid catalyzed ionic reactions compete with free radical reactions to form deposit precursors. The results indicate that deposit precursors form only when aromatics are present in the fuel. Traces of sulfur reduce the rate of autoxidation but increase the yield of deposit precursor. Free radical chemistry is responsible for hydroperoxide formation and the oxidation of sulfur compounds to sulfonic acids. Phenols are then formed by the acid catalyzed decomposition of benzylic hydroperoxides, and deposit precursors are produced by the reaction of phenols with aldehydes, which forms a polymer similar to Bakelite. Deposit precursors appear to have a phenolic resin-like structure because the LIF spectra of the deposit precursors were similar to that of phenolic resin dissolved in TAM...|$|R
50|$|Semen in {{the early}} days of {{artificial}} insemination was delivered everyday to technicians by bull studs as semen was not frozen at this point. It was not until the addition of glycerol to semen extenders that semen could be frozen. In those early days semen was extended by bulls stud into a type of bottle, or test tube, kept at low temperatures, and delivered to technicians usually everyday. The freezing process was discovered by a man named Polge. It was placed in containers called <b>glass</b> <b>ampules,</b> sealed, frozen in dry ice and alcohol and kept in that type of solution until it was needed for insemination. Later the liquid nitrogen refrigerator was invented by Union Carbide with money given to them by John Rockefeller Prentice, who used it exclusively for his bull stud before a number of years later giving it to the entire A.I. industry at no charge or royalty. Liquid nitrogen temperature is 320 degrees below zero, thus almost an absolute temperature that allows very little deterioration of bovine semen. It is also a safe product as it is not flammable. The ampules were fastened to a cane which was placed inside the canister. When the technician needs to inseminate the cow he merely opens the tank, pulls up the desired canister, selects the cane and puts the ampule in a water bath usually of an ice cube and water mixture. The ampule thaws for several minutes and the top is broken off by either the ampule being pre-scribed or cut with a scribe. Then the semen is drawn up into a pipette.

It is now known that the so-called contraction of catfish melanophores {{is the result of a}} neurohumor from the concentrating nerve-fibers, very likely ad renaline, and that their expansion is due to two agents, intermedine from the pituitary gland and a neurohumor, probably acetylcholine, from the dispersing nerve-fibers (Chang, Hsieh, and Lu, 1939; Parker, 1940). In consequence of these new discoveries it seemed desirable to repeat Bacq's experiments with the view of bringing his rather remarkable re sults into relation with this newly acquired information.

The pale fishes, three in number in the initial set, were kept in white-walled, illuminated vessels. Two caudal bands were cut in each fish. By the end of six days these fishes were very pale and their caudal bands were almost fully blanched. The axis and tip of each band, however, were noticeably dark as observed and figured by Bacq (1933). The three fishes of intermediate tint were kept in a gray, illu minated vessel. Their caudal bands after six days were very slightly darker than the rest of their darkish tails. The three fishes of the dark set were rendered very dark, coal-black, by complete blinding. It is well known that catfishes assume this intense shade on double enucleation. Notwithstanding the great depth of tint thus produced, the caudal bands in these fishes were a shade darker than the rest of their very dark tails...|$|R

Samples prepared in the glove box gave the highest stability with a steady state photo anode surface concentration of 80 % C 106 intact and the remaining ~ 20 % being the N-butylbenzimidazole (NBB) substitution products 3 and 4 formed by replacement of the thiocyanate ligand by NBB after 1500 hours of heating at 80 ºC. Samples prepared under ambient conditions gave a steady state C 106 concentration of 60 % of the initial value and 40 % substitution products.

Assuming that this substitution is the predominant loss mechanism in a DSC during thermal stress, we estimate the reduction in the DSC efficiency after long term heat to be 12 - 24 % depending on the degree of atmospheric control during the DSC fabrication.

40|$|Flexible {{electronics}} and displays rely on strong thin borosilicate glasses. Furthermore, borosilicate glass {{play a vital}} role in pharmaceutical packaging, particularly for the container of liquid medicine in the auto-injectors. Because of the risk of failure due to the fracture of the <b>glass</b> <b>ampule</b> the costumers need to purchase several units of auto-injector; also, the injector price increases dramatically. This renewed the interest in the strengthening of soda-borosilicate glass. Moreover, the applications of strong thin borosilicate glasses in flexible electronics attracted attention. Chemical strengthening is a practical means of improving the mechanical performance of soda borosilicate glasses. The chemical strengthening process involves the immersion of an alkali-silicate glass in a molten nitrate salt containing potassium ions at temperatures below the glass-transition temperature where the replacement of small alkali ions in the glass with larger potassium ions from the molten salt occurs. The glass composition, salts impurities, temperature and time, are crucial factors of the treatment. Furthermore, applying an electric field can speed up the process and improves the efficiency. This study investigates the impact of potassium for sodium ion exchange and its parameters on the final strength of alkali borosilicate glasses. Alkali borosilicate tubes, used in pharmaceutical packaging, were subjected to ion exchange in potassium nitrate salts containing different impurities. The initial surface flaws have a significant impact on the final strength due to the limited case depth of surface compression in alklai borosilicate glass subjected to ion exchange. Nonetheless, the results revealed that the sodium poisoning of salt has a limited influence on strengthening; conversely, even a small amount of calcium spoils the strengthening. The replacement of sodium ions with calcium is thermodynamically favoured with respect to Na/K ion-exchange. Calcium can penetrate into the glass surface and prevent the replacement of sodium with potassium and, consequently, the generation of compressive stress. Interestingly, performing electric field assisted ion exchange, EF-IE, for 10 min produces an ion-exchanged layer as deep as conventional strengthening for 4 hours in soda borosilicate glass. Electric field assisted ion exchange also augments the glass strength and makes the glass more damage resistant; however, the initial defects on the glass surface have an adverse influence on the efficiency, as expected. Applying an electric field changes the governing mechanism of ion exchange and accelerates the penetration of potassium ions into the glass; furthermore, the glass structure of the layer undergone electric field assisted ion exchange is modified during the process. Although EF-IE generates a strong surface compression in glass, the inhomogeneous distribution of residual stress is a drawback. Performing EF-IE using AC E-fields produces homogenous ion-exchanged layers in glass and is, probably, a practical approach to balancing the residual stress in glass. Chemical strengthening of a thin alkali-borosilicate glass,D 263 Teco®, is also investigated in the present work. Na/K ion exchange improves the glass strength three times. Although the surface compression generated by ion-exchange in alkali borosilicate glasses is not as strong as typically used glasses for chemical strengthening (alklai aluminosilicate), it can be used to improve the mechanical properties of borosilicate glass. Annealing prior to the ion exchange increases the compressive stress generated on the surface; however, its effect on strengthening is trivial. The compressive stress produced by Na/K ion exchange in thin alkali borosilicate glass improves the damage resistance and the bending strength of glass. Due to the limited thickness of samples, heat treatments with high heating and cooling rates can be conducted. Such heat treatments can be used to carry out surface relaxation and improve the strength of samples by “surface relaxation”. A fast heat treatment after ion exchange improves the finals strength samples about 40...|$|R
