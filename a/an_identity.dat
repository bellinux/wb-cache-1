5|$|A nonzero scalar {{multiple}} of <b>an</b> <b>identity</b> matrix {{is called a}} scalar matrix. If the matrix entries come from a field, the scalar matrices form a group, under matrix multiplication, that is isomorphic to the multiplicative group of nonzero elements of the field.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> two-sided <b>{{identity}}</b> (or just <b>identity)</b> is <b>an</b> {{element that}} is both a left and right <b>identity.</b> Semigroups with <b>a</b> two-sided <b>identity</b> are called monoids. A semigroup may have at most one two-sided <b>identity.</b> If <b>a</b> semigroup has <b>a</b> two-sided <b>identity,</b> then the two-sided identity is the only one-sided identity in the semigroup. If a semigroup has both <b>a</b> left <b>identity</b> and <b>a</b> right <b>identity,</b> then it has <b>a</b> two-sided <b>identity</b> (which is therefore the unique one-sided identity).|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the notion of}} escrowed <b>identity,</b> <b>an</b> application of key-escrow ideas {{to the problem of}} identification. In escrowed <b>identity,</b> one party <b>A</b> does not give his identity to another party B, but rather gives him information that would allow an authorized third party E to determine <b>A's</b> <b>identity.</b> However, B receives a guarantee that E can indeed determine <b>A's</b> <b>identity.</b> We give protocols for escrowed identity based on the El-Gamal (signature and encryption) schemes and on the RSA function. A useful feature of our protocol is that after setting up A to use the system, E is only involved when it is actually needed to determine <b>A's</b> <b>identity.</b> Keywords: Cryptography, Key escrow, Proofs of identity. ...|$|R

5|$|Lesbians in Western {{cultures}} in particular often classify themselves as having <b>an</b> <b>identity</b> that defines their individual sexuality, {{as well as}} their membership to a group that shares common traits. Women in many cultures throughout history have had sexual relations with other women, but they rarely were designated as {{part of a group of}} people based on who they had physical relations with. As women have generally been political minorities in Western cultures, the added medical designation of homosexuality has been cause for the development of a subcultural identity.|$|E

5|$|A group {{consists}} {{of a set of}} elements and a single operation which combines a first and a second element and returns a third. The operation must satisfy certain constraints for it to determine a group: It must be closed (when applied to any pair of elements of the associated set, the generated element must also be a member of that set), it must be associative, there must be <b>an</b> <b>identity</b> element (an element which, when combined with another element using the operation, results in the original element, such as adding zero to a number or multiplying it by one), and for every element there must be an inverse element.|$|E

5|$|After {{a disappointing}} season, the Rockets {{had to make}} some {{significant}} changes to their roster. Howard wasn't happy with his role and the team overall still lacked <b>an</b> <b>identity.</b> On June 1, 2016, the Rockets named Mike D'Antoni as their new head coach. Howard opted out of {{the final year of}} his contract later in June, and signed with the Atlanta Hawks in July. With Howard gone, Harden was now the undisputed franchise player. Harden reaffirmed his commitment to the franchise when he signed a four-year, $118.1 million contract extension in July. The Rockets also signed Ryan Anderson and Eric Gordon, two perimeter players who complemented Harden and fit D'Antoni's style of play.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} finds in the Taynton Limestone Formation, in 1939 Sidney Hugh Reynolds {{referred}} remains to Megalosaurus {{that had been}} found in the older Chipping Norton Limestone Formation dating from the early Bathonian, about thirty single teeth and bones. Though the age disparity makes it problematic to assume <b>an</b> <b>identity</b> with Megalosaurus bucklandii, in 2009 Benson could not establish any relevant anatomical differences with M. bucklandii among the remains found at one site, the New Park Quarry, and therefore affirmed the reference to that species. However, in another site, the Oakham Quarry, the material contained one bone, an ilium, that was clearly dissimilar.|$|E
5|$|Because Ratatouille is {{intended}} to be a romantic, lush vision of Paris, giving it <b>an</b> <b>identity</b> distinct from previous Pixar films, director Brad Bird, producer Brad Lewis and some of the crew spent a week in the city to properly understand its environment, taking a motorcycle tour and eating at five top restaurants. There are also many water-based sequences in the film, one of which is set in the sewers and is more complex than the blue whale scene in Finding Nemo. One scene has Linguini wet after jumping into the Seine to fetch Remy.

5|$|In {{order to}} be issued <b>an</b> <b>identity</b> card, one needs to fill in a form, which {{should be taken to}} the Identity Documents and Passport Regime Units within the District Police Stations. The forms could be {{obtained}} at all District Police Stations. When applying the name, gender, date and place of birth, digital image, ten fingerprints, palmprints, and an electronic signature in a JPEG2000 format are taken. First-time appliers must also provide a valid birth certificate. It is possible for a person to apply for a renewal of the ID card via a representative with a notary signed permit, provided there are no significant changes in his or hers appearance. There are, however limitations. If you apply via a representative, you must receive the new ID yourself. Vice versa, if you applied yourself, then an authorized representative may receive your ID. This does not apply to applying for passports, as fingerprints must be taken.|$|E
