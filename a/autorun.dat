25|$|When {{deciding}} whether to activate <b>AutoRun,</b> both NoDriveAutoRun and NoDriveTypeAutoRun Registry entries are consulted. If either value indicates a drive should be disabled then <b>AutoRun</b> is disabled for that drive.|$|E

25|$|The default Registry {{settings}} add Removable {{drives to}} those that initiated <b>AutoRun.</b> In Windows XP and higher, except Windows Server 2003, only the Unknown and Remote drive types are not active for <b>AutoRun.</b>|$|E
25|$|The terms <b>AutoRun</b> and AutoPlay {{tend to be}} interchangeably {{used when}} {{referring}} to the initiating action, the action that detects and starts reading from discovered volumes. The flowchart illustration in the AutoPlay article shows how <b>AutoRun</b> is positioned as a layer between AutoPlay and the Shell Hardware Detection service and may help in understanding the terminology. However, to avoid confusion, this article uses the term <b>AutoRun</b> when referring to the initiating action.|$|E
25|$|This setting {{cannot be}} used to enable <b>AutoRun</b> on drives on which it is {{disabled}} by default or disable <b>AutoRun</b> for drives not listed. To disable or enable any particular drives or drive types, the Registry must be edited manually.|$|E
50|$|Windows Sysinternals {{supplies}} {{users with}} numerous free utilities, {{most of which}} are being actively developed by Mark Russinovich and Bryce Cogswell, such as Process Explorer, an advanced version of Windows Task Manager, <b>Autoruns,</b> which Windows Sysinternals claims is the most advanced manager of startup applications, RootkitRevealer, a rootkit detection utility, Contig, PageDefrag and a total of 65 other utilities. NTFSDOS, which allowed NTFS volumes to be read by Microsoft's MS-DOS operating system, is now discontinued and is no longer available for download. A larger number of these utilities are nowadays bundled by the publishers for the sake of simpler downloading of all, or most, current versions in the so-called Sysinternals Suite.|$|R
40|$|The routine {{measurement}} of the stable isotope ratios of hydrogen and oxygen (δ 2 H and δ 18 O) in liquid water samples by laser absorption spectroscopy (LAS) is an increasingly common and cost-effective analytical tool in hydrologic and environmental studies around the world. While LAS instrumentation {{is relatively easy to}} operate, the adoption of LAS into routine laboratory operations is not so easy, owing to substantive offline data manipulation required by the instrument operator. Other day-to-day LAS challenges include client sample-project management, storage and tracking of instrument measurement data files, derivation and application of algorithms to correct for between-sample memory, and correcting for linear and non-linear instrumental drift over the course of analysis <b>autoruns.</b> Many LAS users, including the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), developed complex Excel data processing spreadsheets that can be difficult for new users to adopt. Further, the use of spreadsheets presents a challenge to maintaining and reporting long-term QA/QC and laboratory audits. A new Microsoft Access-based Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) for Lasers is presented which simplifies and automates these difficult processes, and eliminates the need for offline data manipulation. LIMS for Lasers makes use of prescribed analysis templates tha...|$|R
25|$|The <b>AutoRun</b> layer {{initially}} consults Windows Registry {{values to}} decides whether to initiate actions for any particular drive or drive type. If <b>AutoRun</b> {{has been disabled}} for the newly discovered volume, then the process halts at that point, effectively disabling AutoPlay for that volume.|$|E
25|$|The {{fact that}} the check for Audio CDs and Movie DVDs is done before <b>AutoRun</b> has {{implications}} for disabling the automatic playing {{of these types of}} media. Disabling <b>AutoRun</b> via the Registry or Group Policy or looking for QueryCancelAutoPlay messages within an application does not prevent these media types from automatically playing on insertion.|$|E
25|$|Sets {{the default}} {{behavior}} for <b>AutoRun</b> commands found in autorun.inf files.|$|E
25|$|The <b>AutoRun</b> {{sequence}} {{starts with}} the initial discovery of a new device or new piece of media. Following this, notification of interested parties occurs, of which the Windows Explorer shell is of primary interest. After checking certain Registry settings to see if <b>AutoRun</b> can proceed, parsing of an optional autorun.inf may occur and any necessary actions are taken.|$|E
25|$|Prior to Windows Vista, when media {{containing}} an autorun.inf specifying an <b>AutoRun</b> {{task was}} inserted, the default action was to automatically execute the program without user intervention. From Windows Vista the default behaviour is to invoke AutoPlay {{and represent the}} <b>AutoRun</b> task {{as one of the}} dialog options. This is also the behaviour when this policy is Not configured or Disabled.|$|E
25|$|Under Windows 7, only CD and DVD drives may specify {{applications}} {{like the}} <b>AutoRun</b> {{task in the}} autorun.inf file. Windows XP and later can be patched to behave {{in the same way}} with update KB971029. In February 2011, this patch was added to the official Windows Update channel. The Windows 7 <b>AutoRun</b> task behaviour now becomes the default for all current versions of the Windows OS.|$|E
25|$|However, Group Policy {{would be}} the {{accepted}} method of disabling <b>AutoRun</b> on an entire Windows domain.|$|E
25|$|USB flash drives {{may also}} be used {{deliberately}} or unwittingly to transfer malware and <b>autorun</b> worms onto a network.|$|E
25|$|<b>AutoRun</b> malware {{has been}} {{extended}} to use hard drives, picture frames and other digital devices. Care in dealing with external devices is a security priority. The prevalence of malware infection by means of <b>AutoRun</b> and USB flash drive was documented in a 2011 Microsoft study analyzing data from more than 600 million systems worldwide {{in the first half}} of 2011. The study found that 26 percent of all malware infections of Windows system were due to USB flash drives exploiting the <b>AutoRun</b> feature in Microsoft Windows. That finding was in line with other statistics, such as the monthly reporting of most commonly detected malware by antivirus company ESET, which lists abuse of autorun.inf as first among the top ten threats in 2011.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{sequence}} is handled {{much the same}} in every version of Windows from Windows 95. However, the way the autorun.inf file is read and acted upon {{and the level of}} integration of <b>AutoRun</b> with AutoPlay has changed significantly from the time AutoPlay was introduced in Windows XP until the present handling in Windows 7. In Windows 10, Microsoft has added the option to enable <b>autorun</b> in its settings. Not only users can turn it on but also they can choose specific external devices for autoplay.|$|E
25|$|<b>AutoRun</b> and the {{companion}} feature AutoPlay are {{components of the}} Microsoft Windows operating system that dictate what actions the system takes when a drive is mounted.|$|E
25|$|The {{default value}} for this entry {{consists}} of products identified by Microsoft testing as {{being unable to}} support <b>AutoRun.</b> This entry should not be altered from its default.|$|E
25|$|The default Registry {{settings}} on Windows versions {{prior to}} Windows XP (See NoDriveTypeAutoRun), disable Remote and Removable drives from <b>AutoRun</b> initiation, leaving Fixed and CDROM drive types active by default.|$|E
25|$|For {{this reason}} the Media Change Notification message {{should not be}} {{disabled}} unless {{there is absolutely no}} alternative; <b>AutoRun</b> can be disabled for individual drives using Group Policy or the Registry.|$|E
25|$|Variants B and C place a copy {{of their}} DLL form on any {{attached}} removable media (such as USB flash drives), from which they can then infect new hosts through the Windows <b>AutoRun</b> mechanism.|$|E
25|$|<b>AutoRun</b> consults Windows Registry {{values to}} decide whether to {{initiate}} actions for any particular drive or drive type. These values can be changed using several methods, one of which is using Group Policy.|$|E
25|$|When <b>AutoRun</b> is disabled, Windows {{should not}} proceed further through the {{activation}} sequence than the Registry check. However, it parses any autorun.inf found and does {{everything except the}} final action to invoke AutoPlay or execute an application.|$|E
25|$|In {{the above}} example, <b>AutoRun</b> would be {{disabled}} for all drives {{and for all}} users. This example {{would need to be}} run as Administrator and a reboot would be needed for the setting to take complete effect.|$|E
25|$|<b>AutoRun,</b> {{a feature}} of Windows Explorer (actually of the shell32 dll) {{introduced}} in Windows 95, enables media and devices to launch programs by use of command listed in a file called autorun.inf, stored in the root directory of the medium.|$|E
25|$|On Windows {{versions}} {{prior to}} Windows XP, an autorun.inf file on any drive type will be read and its instructions followed. The <b>AutoRun</b> task, if specified, is executed immediately without user interaction. This includes DRIVE_REMOVABLE, DRIVE_FIXED and DRIVE_REMOTE drive types.|$|E
25|$|<b>AutoRun</b> {{functionality}} {{has been}} used as a malware vector for some time. Prior to Windows Vista, the default action with a CD-ROM drive type was to follow any autorun.inf file instructions without prompts or warnings. This makes rogue CD-ROMs one possible infection vector.|$|E
25|$|<b>AutoRun</b> may be {{suppressed}} {{on particular}} drives and drive types {{by using the}} methods described in the Group Policy section. However, the Group Policy Editor is not available on Home versions of Windows XP and does not provide any fine-grained drive selection facilities.|$|E
25|$|Since {{either the}} policy setting or this {{workaround}} disable <b>autorun,</b> installation of software from an autorunning install CD or DVD will obviously {{no longer be}} automatic. It {{will be necessary to}} view the CD's autorun.inf file and then execute the appropriate install program manually.|$|E
25|$|The {{handling}} of the autorun.inf file changes very significantly between each Windows version. The details {{can be found in}} the autorun.inf article. The current handling in Windows 7 is that only drives of type DRIVE_CDROM may specify an <b>AutoRun</b> task, alter double-click behaviour or change context menus.|$|E
25|$|After <b>AutoRun</b> completes, AutoPlay initiates {{by doing}} an {{examination}} of the volume for content. This is called content sniffing. AutoPlay decides whether the volume is an Audio CD, movie DVD, a blank recordable medium (a CD-R, CD-RW, DVD+R etc.) or a generic volume which contains files.|$|E
