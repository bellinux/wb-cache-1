40|$|Abstract—With {{the rapid}} growth of GPS-enable Smartphones, the {{interest}} on using Location Based Services (LBSs) has increased significantly. The evolution in the functionalities provided by those smartphones has enabled them to accurately pinpoint the location of a user. Because location information is what all LBSs depend on to process user’s request, it should be properly protected from attackers or malicious service providers (SP). Additionally, maintaining user’s privacy and confidentiality are imperative challenges to be overcome. A possible solution for these challenges is to provide user anonymity, which means to ensure that a user initiating a request to the SP should be indistinguishable from a group of people by any adversary who had access to the request. Most of the proposals that maintain user’s anonymity are based on location obfuscation. It mainly focuses on adjusting the resolution of the user’s location information. In this paper, we present a new protocol that is focused on using cryptographic techniques to provide anonymity for LBSs users in the smartphone environment. This protocol makes use of a trusted third party called the <b>Anonymity</b> <b>Server</b> (AS) that ensures anonymous communication between the user and the service provider...|$|E
40|$|Continued {{advances}} in mobile networks and positioning technologies {{have created a}} strong market push for location-based applications. Examples include location-aware emergency response, location-based advertisement, and location-based entertainment. An important challenge in the wide deployment of location-based services (LBSs) is the privacy-aware management of location information, providing safeguards for location privacy of mobile clients against vulnerabilities for abuse. This paper describes a scalable architecture for protecting the location privacy from various privacy threats resulting from uncontrolled usage of LBSs. This architecture includes {{the development of a}} personalized location anonymization model and a suite of location perturbation algorithms. A unique characteristic of our location privacy architecture is the use of a flexible privacy personalization framework to support location k-anonymity {{for a wide range of}} mobile clients with context-sensitive privacy requirements. This framework enables each mobile client to specify the minimum level of anonymity that it desires and the maximum temporal and spatial tolerances that it is willing to accept when requesting k-anonymity-preserving LBSs. We devise an efficient message perturbation engine to implement the proposed location privacy framework. The prototype that we develop is designed to be run by the <b>anonymity</b> <b>server</b> on a trusted platform and performs location anonymization on LBS request messages of mobile clients such as identity removal and spatio-temporal cloaking of the location information. We study the effectiveness of our location cloaking algorithms under various conditions by using realistic location data that is synthetically generated from real road maps and traffic volume data. Our experiments show that the personalized location k-anonymity model, together with our location perturbation engine, can achieve high resilience to location privacy threats without introducing any significant performance penalty...|$|E
50|$|People in {{a country}} with a repressive {{political}} regime may use anonymity (for example Internet-based <b>anonymity</b> <b>servers</b> in other countries) to avoid persecution for their political opinions. Note that even in democratic countries, some people claim, rightly or wrongly, that certain political opinions are persecuted. 1999 gives an overview of uses of anonymity to protect political speech. Every country has a limit on which political opinions are allowed, and there are always people who want to express forbidden opinions, like racial agitation in most democratic countries.|$|R

40|$|Anonymity {{is a very}} {{important}} security feature in addition to authentication and key agreement features in communication protocols. In this paper, we propose two authentication and key agreement (AKA) protocols: the AKA protocol with user anonymity (UAP) and the AKA protocol with user and <b>server</b> <b>anonymity</b> (USAP). The proposed protocols have the following advantages: first of all, they preserve anonymity, which is a security feature that was ignored in most of the previously proposed AKA protocols; secondly, they exploit the difference in capabilities between resource constrained clients and highly resourceful servers and thus are suitable for wireless applications; thirdly, they resist known attacks; and finally, they perform better {{in terms of the number}} of messages and bits exchanged and computing time as compared to the previously proposed AKA protocols. For example, USAP preserves user and <b>server</b> <b>anonymity,</b> exchanges 3 messages with 1920 bits in total, and requires only 280 msec of processing time on the user side when implemented on Mitsubishis M 16 C microprocessor. Similarly, the UAP is scalable, preserves user anonymity, requires 440 msec, and exchanges 2560 bits...|$|R
40|$|Anonymous {{communication}} {{is an important}} part of democratic societies and freedom of speech. Whistleblowers, protest organizers, and, more broadly, anyone with controversial viewpoints have been using the limited form of anonymity the Internet provides to protect their privacy. Unfortunately, the basic anonymity the Internet guarantees is too weak to protect their identities from even the weakest adversaries. As a result, more and more users have adopted privacy enhancing technologies to protect themselves. All existing anonymity systems, however, sacrifice anonymity for efficient communication or vice-versa. Onion-routing achieves low latency, high bandwidth, and scalable anonymous communication, but is susceptible to traffic analysis attacks. Designs based on DC-Nets, on the other hand, protect the users against traffic analysis attacks, but sacrifice bandwidth. Verifiable mixnets maintain strong anonymity with low bandwidth overhead, but suffer from high computation overhead instead. In this thesis, we present Riffle, a bandwidth and computation efficient communication system with strong anonymity. Riffle consists of a small set of <b>anonymity</b> <b>servers</b> and a large number of users, and guarantees anonymity as long as there exists at least one honest server. Riffle uses a new hybrid verifiable shuffle technique and private information retrieval for bandwidth- and computation-efficient anonymous communication. We have evaluated Riffle in two different applications: file sharing and microblogging. Our evaluation shows that Riffle can achieve a bandwidth of over 100 KB/s per user in an anonymity set of 200 users in the case of file sharing, and handle over 100, 000 users with less than 10 second latency in the case of microblogging. by Young Hyun Kwon.

40|$|Abstract: We {{propose a}} new {{server-based}} protocol for timed-release encryption (TRE), {{sometimes referred to}} as “sending infor-mation into the future”. As with other recently-proposed schemes, ours is based on the use of bilinear pairings on a Gap Diffie-Hellman group, and allows a sender to specify with precision the release time of the encrypted data. Our protocol possesses various required prop-erties related to security, user <b>anonymity</b> and <b>server</b> passivity. It also provides almost-costless scalability in settings with multiple time-servers, and improves significantly upon existing TRE schemes, in terms of communication cost. The basic version of our protocol is extended to include new desirable features, such as message pre-opening, and “hiding ” of important details associated with a cipher-text, thus making our approach well-suited to a number of emerging e-applications that require future decryption of confidential data...|$|R
40|$|The {{existing}} {{mechanisms for}} handover authentication is designing a secure authentication module, and protect users’ privacy information {{when they are}} authenticated by the access points for data access. Further, most existing approaches do not support user revocation. In this paper, we present a secure and efficient authentication protocol named Handauth. Similar to the existing mechanisms but, Handauth provides user authentication and session key establishment. However, compared to other well-known approaches, Handauth not only enjoys both computation and communication efficiency, but also achieves strong user anonymity and untraceablility, forward secure user revocation, conditional privacy-preservation, AAA <b>server</b> <b>anonymity,</b> access service expiration management, access point authentication, easily scheduled revocation, dynamic user revocation and attack resistance.

50|$|Anonymous web {{browsing}} {{refers to}} {{utilization of the}} World Wide Web that hides a user's personally identifiable information from websites visited. Anonymous web browsing can be achieved via proxy servers, virtual private networks and other anonymity programs such as Tor. These programs work by sending information {{through a series of}} routers in order to hide the source and destination of information. However, there is never a guarantee of <b>anonymity</b> with these <b>servers.</b> These programs are still susceptible to traffic analysis. Proxy servers, which have a central point of knowledge, are also susceptible to collection of data by authorities. Moreover, cookies, browser plugins, and other information can be used to uniquely identify a user even if they have hidden their IP address.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- An {{anonymity}} network enables {{users to}} access the Web while blocking any tracking or tracing of their identity on the Internet. Tor is open-source anonymity software free to public use. This type of online anonymity moves Internet traffic through a worldwide network of volunteer <b>servers.</b> <b>Anonymity</b> networks prevent traffic analysis and network surveillance or at least make it more difficult. Website administrators routinely rely on IPaddress blocking for disabling access to misbehaving users, but blocking IP addresses is not practical if the abuser routes through an anonymizing network. As a result, administrators block all known exit nodes of anonymizing networks, denying anonymous access to misbehaving and behaving users alike. To address this problem, we present Nymble, {{a system in which}} servers can “blacklist ” misbehaving users, thereby blocking users without compromising their anonymity. Our system is thus agnostic to different servers definitions of misbehavior...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a novel {{protocol}} for providing both client and <b>server</b> <b>anonymity</b> in peer-to-peer (P 2 P) based grids is presented. The protocol assumes individual nodes or users to be utility maximizing agents, and relies on an auction mechanism for trading of resources among them. The resources here {{can refer to}} data files, storage capacity, or computation power (i. e., CPU cycles) etc. The protocol is inherently anonymous, light-weight, and incentive-compatible. Incentive compatibility implies that the protocol {{takes into account the}} selfishness of users; as would be seen the utilities of users are maximized by truthfully following the protocol steps. Moreover, if the protocol is truthfully followed by the users, anonymity to both the clients and servers of all the transactions are guaranteed. Furthermore, unlike other schemes, the proposed protocol does not rely on any trusted centralized entity or require specialized encryptions to be performed by the users. Thus, the protocol incurs very low overhead on the system and is light-weight. In brief, the proposed protocol provides efficient and natural means to provide anonymity in P 2 P based grids, and is easily deployable in a large un-trusted Internet-scale setting.

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} anonymous {{communication protocols}} based on onions: each message is sent in an encrypted form through a path chosen at random by its sender, {{and the message}} is re-coded by each server on the path. Recently, {{it has been shown}} that if the anonymous paths are long enough, then the protocols provide provable security for some adversary models. However, it was assumed that all users choose intermediate servers uniformly at random from the same set of servers. We show that if a single user chooses only from a constrained subset of possible intermediate <b>servers,</b> <b>anonymity</b> level may dramatically decrease. A thumb rule is that if Alice is aware of much less than 50 % of possible intermediate <b>servers,</b> then the <b>anonymity</b> set for her message becomes surprisingly small with high probability. Moreover, for each location in the anonymity set an adversary may compute probability that it gets a message of Alice. Since there are big differences in these probabilities, in most cases the true destination of the message from Alice is in a small group of locations with the highest probabilities. Our results contradict some beliefs that the protocols mentioned guarantee anonymity provided that the set of possible intermediate servers for each user is large...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—As P 2 P {{multimedia}} streaming {{service is}} becoming more popular, {{it is important for}} P 2 P-VoD content providers to protect their servers identity. In this paper, we first show {{that it is possible to}} launch an “identity attack”: exposing and identifying servers of peer-to-peer video-on-demand (P 2 P-VoD) systems. The conventional wisdom of the P 2 P-VoD providers is that identity attack is very difficult because peers cannot distinguish between regular peers and servers in the P 2 P streaming process. We are the first to show that it is otherwise, and present an efficient and systematic methodology to perform P 2 P-VoD servers detection. Furthermore, we present an analytical framework to quantify the probability that an endhost is indeed a P 2 P-VoD server. In the second part of this paper, we present a novel architecture that can hide the identity and provide <b>anonymity</b> protection for <b>servers</b> in P 2 P-VoD systems. To quantify the protective capability of this architecture, we use the “fundamental matrix theory ” to show the high complexity of discovering all protective nodes so as to disrupt the P 2 P-VoD service. We not only validate the model via extensive simulation, but also implement this protective architecture on PlanetLab and carry out measurements to reveal its robustness against identity attack.

40|$|Abstract—Cybercriminals use {{different}} types of geographi-cally distributed servers to run their operations such as C&C servers for managing their malware, exploit servers to distribute the malware, payment servers for monetization, and redirectors for <b>anonymity.</b> Identifying the <b>server</b> infrastructure used by a cybercrime operation is fundamental for defenders, as it enables take-downs that can disrupt the operation and is a critical step towards identifying the criminals behind it. In this paper, we propose a novel active probing approach for detecting malicious servers and compromised hosts that listen for (and react to) incoming network requests. Our approach sends probes to remote hosts and examines their responses, determining whether the remote hosts are malicious or not. It identifies different malicious server types as well as malware that listens for incoming traffic such as P 2 P bots. Compared with existing defenses, our active probing approach is fast, cheap, easy to deploy, and achieves Internet scale. We have implemented our active probing approach in a tool called CyberProbe. We have used CyberProbe to identify 151 malicious servers and 7, 881 P 2 P bots through 24 localized and Internet-wide scans. Of those servers 75 % are unknown to publicly available databases of malicious servers, indicating that CyberProbe can achieve up to 4 times better coverage than existing techniques. Our results reveal an important provider locality property: operations hosts an average of 3. 2 servers on the same hosting provider to amortize the cost of setting up {{a relationship with the}} provider.

40|$|In the age {{of cloud}} computing, cloud users with {{a limited amount of}} storage can {{outsource}} their data to remote servers. The cloud servers, in lieu of monetary benefits, offer retrievability of their clients' data at any point of time. A client's data can be dynamic (or static) in nature depending on whether the client can (or cannot) update the uploaded data as needed. Secure cloud storage protocols enable a client to check the integrity of her outsourced data by auditing the data. In this work, we explore the possibility of constructing a secure cloud storage for dynamic data by leveraging the idea of secure network coding. Specifically, we fail to provide a general construction of an efficient secure cloud storage protocol for dynamic data from an arbitrary secure network coding protocol. However, we show that some of the secure network coding schemes can be used to construct secure cloud storage protocols for dynamic data, and we construct such a secure cloud storage protocol based on a secure network coding protocol. To the best of our knowledge, our scheme is the first secure cloud storage protocol for dynamic data that is based on a secure network coding protocol and that is secure in the standard model. In a publicly verifiable setting, auditing task is often delegated to a third party auditor that audits the outsourced data on behalf of a client. We extend our scheme in order to provide privacy-preserving and to offer <b>anonymity</b> (from the <b>server)</b> of a user updating shared data in an enterprise setting. We compare the performance of our secure cloud storage protocol with that of other secure cloud storage schemes and discuss some limitations of our scheme. Finally, we provide another construction of a secure cloud storage protocol specific to append-only data [...] - that overcomes some of the limitations of our earlier scheme...|$|R
