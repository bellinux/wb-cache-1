500|$|.....Bane {{managed to}} capture {{much of the}} ex-mayor's character: Her eyes are {{friendly}} and her hair as wild as ever. But Katz's signature grin is a little stiff, a little too aggressive. Leaning forward, she looks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> take {{a bite out of}} the next passerby. Which by the way, seems appropriate when you look back on her days behind the mayoral desk. Maybe monochromatic bronze just isn't the right medium for a woman as colorful as ol' Vera. Where's the red blazer? Our suggestion: Get this lady some accessories! The right hat or scarf could make that brown pantsuit really work.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{nominated}} for a Golden Globe award for Best Original Song, but lost to U2's [...] "The Hands That Built America" [...] from Gangs of New York. At the 46th Grammy Awards, it was nominated in the categories of Best Dance Recording and Best Short Form Music Video, but lost both awards; the former to Kylie Minogue's [...] "Come into My World" [...] and the latter to Johnny Cash's [...] "Hurt". [...] "Die Another Day" [...] was also nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Original Song of 2002 while Madonna herself won the trophy of Worst Supporting Actress for her cameo in the film. In a MORI poll for the Channel 4 TV show James Bond's Greatest Hits, the song was voted the ninth best out of 22, but also came in as an [...] "overwhelming number one" [...] favorite among those under the age of 24. Rock music critic Neil McCormick from The Daily Telegraph named it the fifth best James Bond theme song, describing [...] "Die Another Day" [...] as an electro R workout which was [...] "expressively weird, brutally modern, satisfyingly original and evocative of the dark heart of Bond. Plus, Madonna actually looks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> be a match for Bond in either bed or battlefield. Or both." [...] Rolling Stone listed it as the seventh best Bond song in the magazine's list of [...] "The top 10 James Bond Theme Songs".|$|E
60|$|Roger frowned. Freda's {{face was}} solemn enough {{but her eyes}} looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> be {{laughing}} at him.|$|E
60|$|She {{turned her}} eyes doubtfully towards him, {{and then looked}} away <b>as</b> <b>if</b> afraid <b>she</b> <b>might</b> forgive him.|$|R
60|$|She spoke, he said, almost reproachfully, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{thought he}} <b>might</b> go away on his wings, after all.|$|R
60|$|He {{held his}} wife's {{hand as she}} lay by his side. He was the comforter. <b>She</b> felt <b>as</b> <b>if</b> now <b>she</b> <b>might</b> cry and take comfort and sleep. He, the quiet, obliterated man, held her hand, taking the {{responsibility}} upon himself.|$|R
60|$|And {{the poor}} girl looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> cry, {{which would have}} been a {{wonderful}} thing for Pomona to do.|$|E
6000|$|... "Horrors, yes!" [...] Mrs. Forsyth said, {{without turning}} {{her head from}} {{studying}} her trunks, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> divine their contents from their outside.|$|E
60|$|Here she ceased; and {{snapping}} her reticule again, and shutting her mouth, looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> be broken, but {{could never be}} bent.|$|E
6000|$|He {{looked at}} her an instant <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{guessing}} <b>she</b> <b>might</b> have derived that impression from Harold. [...] "What has that to do with it? Does a rich man enjoy {{any more than a}} poor his wife's making a fool of him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Silenzio!" [...] said Bardo, {{in a loud}} {{agitated}} voice, while Romola half {{started from}} her chair, clasped her hands, and looked round at Tito, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> now <b>she</b> <b>might</b> appeal to him. Monna Brigida gave a little scream, and bit her lip.|$|R
60|$|This was rank heresy to Felicity, but the Story Girl looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{thought there}} <b>might</b> be {{something}} in it.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} Lady Casterley looked almost <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> strike her granddaughter; {{then a little}} sardonic smile broke out on her face.|$|E
6000|$|... "One of {{the lake}} towns. She is an old vessel. There is the name-- Wellington. That sounds <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> be a Canadian." ...|$|E
60|$|Probably {{he meant}} to try to humor her, but she screamed, and he jumped back <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> burn him. She screamed shrilly, in wild, staccato notes.|$|E
6000|$|Kate showed for {{a little}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> wished it <b>might</b> be. [...] "Not lungs, I think. Isn't consumption, taken in time, now curable?" ...|$|R
6000|$|He took it <b>as</b> <b>if</b> what <b>she</b> meant <b>might</b> {{be other}} than her {{description}} of it. [...] "You're deceiving two persons then, Mrs. Lowder and somebody else?" ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{looked at}} Clementina <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he thought <b>she</b> <b>might</b> dispute this, but she consented at her sweetest, [...] "Oh, yes, indeed," [...] {{and he went}} on: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can hardly}} give an opinion until I have seen her. Does she look <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> {{have been a}} pretty woman at one time of her life?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... '"O no, no! I was {{thinking}} {{you might be}} going on to town to meet your mother. I saw her there--and she looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> be expecting 'ee." ...|$|E
6000|$|Miss Tita {{reflected}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> {{by thinking}} of a reason for that, but she failed to produce one. Instead of this she asked abruptly, [...] "Why {{in the world do}} you want to know us?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mark and Jessie came in {{from the}} city one warm morning and found Sylvia sitting idly in the hall. She left her {{preparations}} all to Prue, who revelled in such things, and applied herself diligently to her lesson <b>as</b> <b>if</b> afraid <b>she</b> <b>might</b> not learn it as she should. Half way up stairs Mark turned and said, laughing-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bob," [...] she said, {{after a few}} moments, {{looking down}} at the baby, and holding it anxiously, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> feared it <b>might</b> slip from her mind and her fingers, [...] "I have a favor to ask of you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's too {{beautiful}} {{that you should}} have come," [...] said Henrietta, looking at her <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> thought Isabel <b>might</b> be prepared to challenge the proposition. [...] "If you hadn't--if you hadn't; well, I don't know," [...] remarked Miss Stackpole, hinting ominously at her powers of disapproval.|$|R
6000|$|Snuffy strolled {{over to the}} boat. [...] "See that {{handsome}} girl, Si?" [...] {{he asked}} lazily. [...] "One of the Bentleys' boarders, I hear. Looks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> have {{stepped out of a}} picture frame, don't she?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Who is {{that woman}} with the auburn hair and a rather {{effective}} belligerent gleam in her eyes?" [...] asked a man sitting just behind Comus; [...] "she looks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> have created the world in six days and destroyed it on the seventh." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Looks to me <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> be a {{pleasure}} boat," [...] remarked Phil, who, taking after his father, knew considerable about sea-going matters. [...] "She's a private steam yacht, to {{my way of}} thinking." [...] And later on this {{proved to be the}} case.|$|E
60|$|Dus {{looked a}} little alarmed, I thought, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> feared <b>she</b> <b>might</b> have uttered too much; or, perhaps, that I was uttering too much. She rose, thanked me hurriedly, but in a very lady-like manner, and set about {{removing}} the breakfast service, with as much diligence <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had been a mere menial.|$|R
6000|$|... "Brusque, indeed! you {{may well}} say so. She nearly pushed me down in the Hall; and when I looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I thought <b>she</b> <b>might</b> have given me a little more room, she tossed her head and said, 'Beg pardon, never saw you!'" ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{a moment}} when I thought the kisses were returned; a moment when it seemed <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she,</b> too <b>might</b> have forgotten. Almost before the idea could shape itself in my mind, her first {{voluntary}} action made me feel that she remembered. With a cry which was like a cry of horror--with a strength which I doubt if I could have resisted if I had tried--she thrust me back from her. I saw merciless anger in her eyes; I saw merciless contempt on her lips. She looked me over, from head to foot, as <b>she</b> <b>might</b> have looked at a stranger who had insulted her.|$|R
6000|$|We {{were silent}} again. At {{the end of}} the next piece they all rose, and the wife said timidly to me, [...] "Well, good-evening," [...] <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> be venturing too far; and her husband came to her rescue with [...] "Well, good-evening, sir." [...] The young girl merely bowed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Margaret," [...] said Flora, {{after putting}} her sister into the carriage, [...] "I {{wish we had}} put Ethel into a veil! There is Meta all white from head to foot, with such a veil! and Ethel, in her little white cap, looks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> be Lucy Taylor, only not so pretty." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{would have}} liked to ask the maid some questions, but she was an elderly woman, who looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> be the mother of the lemon-juice boy, and as she said not a word to me while she made a few {{arrangements}} in the room, I did not feel emboldened to say anything to her.|$|E
60|$|Teddy had {{no desire}} to prolong the conversation, which had been begun simply because his aunt insisted on knowing where he had been, but hurried away from the gate on which he had been {{swinging}} while Mrs. Fernald questioned him, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> fearful lest <b>she</b> <b>might</b> try to detain him until the matter could be settled according to her own ideas of propriety.|$|R
6000|$|She withdrew {{her hand}} and passed it over her eyes. After a moment she caught his hand again, and, holding it tightly <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> feared he <b>might</b> fly from her, bit her lip, and then slowly, without looking at him, said, [...] "I lied to you about myself and Kitty that night; I did not come with her. I came alone and {{secretly}} to Boomville to see--to see {{the man who is}} my husband." ...|$|R
60|$|The man had not {{the least}} {{suspicion}} of me, and I thought it reasonable to hope that Mary would prove as generous. Yet was I straitened in my mind. For it <b>might</b> be that <b>she</b> was only biding her time to strike suddenly, and this attached me the more to Timothy, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I feared <b>she</b> <b>might</b> soon snatch him from me. As was indeed to be the case.|$|R
