5|$|After Sulphur Dell was {{dismantled}} on April 16, 1969, the ballpark's sunken {{field was}} filled in with rock, dirt, and {{the remains of}} the demolished Andrew Jackson Hotel. It was then converted to a number of state-owned parking lots for the nearby the Tennessee State Capitol. While Sulphur Dell was nestled in an <b>area</b> <b>that</b> was home to the city's garbage dump, stockyards, the Atlantic Ice House building, and other various warehouses, First Tennessee Park is now surrounded by new apartments, parking ramps, and restaurants. The facade surrounding the home plate entrance on the stadium's north side is constructed from cast ultra-high-performance concrete planks, zinc panels, and an array of windows that stretches across the full width of the entrance. To the south of the stadium, beyond the outfield wall, is an <b>area</b> <b>that</b> connects the city's Cumberland River Greenway to the Bicentennial Mall Greenway.

These are the <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> see the highest rates of production among trees in the Pacific Northwest temperate rainforest, and are thusly the <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> are targeted for timber harvest. For this reason, these areas are hotspots for active management of yellow cedar into the future, as they represent the main <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> are able to achieve conservation goals.|$|R

The premise of this method is that affected persons contain some common genomic regions with similar SNP alleles and such areas will be found in this analysis.

Clearly, <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> can be marked with higher probability as IBD and have the same correlation with the disease status of identical <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> are more probably only IBS, are better candidates to be causative, and yet this distinction is not encoded in standard association analysis...|$|R
