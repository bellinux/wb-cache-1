5000|$|Transferring credit from nationally {{accredited}} {{higher education}} institutions to institutions which have regional accreditation has proved particularly problematic. Regionally accredited schools are generally non-profit and academically oriented. Nationally accredited schools are predominantly for-profit and generally offer vocational, career or technical programs. [...] Every college {{has the right to}} set standards and refuse to accept transfer credits. However, if a student has gone to a nationally <b>accredited</b> <b>school</b> it may be particularly difficult to transfer credits (or even credit for a degree earned) if he or she then applies to a regionally accredited college. Some regionally accredited colleges have general policies against accepting any credits from nationally accredited schools, others are reluctant to because they feel that these schools' academic standards are lower than their own or they are unfamiliar with the particular school. The student who is planning to transfer credits from a nationally <b>accredited</b> <b>school</b> to a regionally <b>accredited</b> <b>school</b> should ensure that the regionally <b>accredited</b> <b>school</b> will accept the credits before they enroll in the nationally <b>accredited</b> <b>school.</b>|$|E
