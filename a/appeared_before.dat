5|$|Although the {{hypothesised}} {{description of}} what Mesozoic ants looked like was somewhat accurate when compared to actual specimens, some characteristics were inaccurate. They believed that ant-like mandibles first <b>appeared</b> <b>before</b> {{the development of an}} ant-like petiole, but such case was proven false when it was opposite on S. freyi specimens (ant-like petiole first <b>appeared</b> <b>before</b> the development of ant-like mandibles). Based on drawings, it was suggested that Mesozoic ants had long mandibles with multiple teeth, toothed tarsal claws and a broadly jointed petiole. Examination of collected specimens, however, shows that these ants had very short mandibles, toothless tarsal claws and a separated petiole.|$|E

5|$|A few {{groups of}} {{unicellular}} eukaryotes have only vestigial mitochondria or derived structures: the microsporidians, metamonads, and archamoebae. These groups appear {{as the most}} primitive eukaryotes on phylogenetic trees constructed using rRNA information, which once suggested that they <b>appeared</b> <b>before</b> the origin of mitochondria. However, this is now known to be an artifact of long-branch attraction—they are derived groups and retain genes or organelles derived from mitochondria (e.g., mitosomes and hydrogenosomes).|$|E
25|$|Lawyers <b>appearing</b> <b>before</b> the Court wear black robes {{with blue}} lapels, whilst the justices wear {{distinctive}} blue robes with black lapels, a custom which reputably {{began with the}} suggestion of the first lawyers to <b>appear</b> <b>before</b> the Supreme Court, Eggert Claessen and Sveinn Björnsson (later President of Iceland).|$|R

5|$|Giving Jharokha Darshan {{from this}} jharokha was a daily feature. This {{tradition}} was also continued by rulers who followed Akbar (r. 1556–1605 CE). Jahangir (r. 1605–27 CE) and Shah Jahan (r. 1628–58 CE) also <b>appeared</b> <b>before</b> their subjects punctiliously. However, this ancient practice was discontinued by Aurangzeb during his 11th year of reign as he {{considered it a}} non-Islamic practice, a form of idol worship. In Agra Fort and Red Fort, the jharokha faces the Yamuna and the emperor would stand alone on the jharokha to greet his subjects.|$|E

5|$|Mary is {{presented}} as a Marian apparition; in this case she probably <b>appears</b> <b>before</b> a donor, who would have been kneeling in prayer in the now lost opposite panel. The idea of a saint <b>appearing</b> <b>before</b> laity was common in Northern art of the period, and is also represented in van Eyck's Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele (1434–36). There, the Canon is portrayed as if having just momentarily paused to reflect on a passage from his hand-held bible as the Virgin and Child with two saints <b>appear</b> <b>before</b> him, as if embodiments of his prayer.|$|R
5|$|In March 1993, the AFL and AFLPA <b>appeared</b> <b>before</b> the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC). At {{this hearing}} it was {{determined}} that a dispute between the parties did exist and that the AIRC had jurisdiction to determine an Award. The AFL and AFLPA were instructed by the AIRC to attempt negotiations away from the AIRC environment. These negotiations led to the CBA of 1994-1995.|$|E

As there were no places there where it could have landed, the aircraft must therefore have crashed into the sea.|$|E
50|$|Within a noun phrase, demonstratives, {{quantifying}} determiners, adjectives, possessors {{and relative}} clauses precede the head noun, while cardinal numbers can <b>appear</b> <b>before</b> {{or after the}} noun they modify. Within a verb phrase, adverbs usually <b>appear</b> <b>before</b> a verb. The language, as analyzed in this article, uses coverbs (in a serial verb construction) and postpositions. Classical Chinese makes heavy use of parataxis where English would use a dependent clause; however, there are means to form dependent clauses, some of which <b>appear</b> <b>before</b> the main clause while others appear after. There are also a number of sentence-final particles.|$|R

Bowie <b>appeared</b> <b>before</b> the council at some point and spoke for an hour, asking for a commission.

5|$|President Reagan <b>appeared</b> <b>before</b> the Tower Commission on December 2, 1986, {{to answer}} {{questions}} regarding {{his involvement in the}} affair. When asked about his role in authorizing the arms deals, he first stated that he had; later, he appeared to contradict himself by stating that he had no recollection of doing so. In his 1990 autobiography, An American Life, Reagan acknowledges authorizing the shipments to Israel.|$|E
5|$|The first toothless {{ancestors}} of Mysticetes <b>appeared</b> <b>before</b> the first radiation {{in the late}} Oligocene. Eomysticetus {{and others like it}} showed no evidence in the skull of echolocation abilities, suggesting they mainly relied on their eyesight for navigation. The eomysticetes had long, flat rostra that lacked teeth and had blowholes located halfway up the dorsal side of the snout. Though the palate is not well-preserved in these specimens, they are thought to have had baleen and been filter feeders. Miocene baleen whales were preyed upon by larger predators like killer sperm whales and Megalodon.|$|E
