Set 378 to win, West Indies were left to face the variations of Muralitharan – who bowled doosras and normal off-spin mixed up together as the West Indian batsmen were comprehensively deceived. Four catches went to the hands of Jayawardene who fielded at silly point – not normally the position where most catches are taken, but then again, this wasn't a usual innings. The West Indians were shown up for what they were – run-of-the-mill domestic players who should never have played international cricket, bar possibly Chanderpaul who made 24, Deonarine who even had the cheek to smash Muralitharan for six before being deceived, bowled for 29, and Denesh Ramdin who scampered together 28. Muralitharan registered his fourteenth ten-wicket-haul in a match, {{it was the fourth}} time he had taken more than eight wickets, and Sri Lanka cruised to another 240-run victory – although, in <b>all</b> <b>fairness,</b> it was a difficult pitch to bat on, and the tourists had shown some promise with the bat. It showed that the West Indies desperately needed to sort out their contract problems before the next home season, however – their next away series being against Australia, which even a full-strength West Indies would struggle with.|$|E

2500|$|Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel, 524 U.S. 498 (1998), is a United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court held that the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act (Coal Act) {{constituted}} an unconstitutional regulatory taking of property which required the Act to be invalidated. [...] The import of this decision is that it was made {{in the context of a}} purely economic regulation. [...] The plurality examines the statute and its resultant harm as an ad hoc factual inquiry based on factors delineated in Penn Central such as the economic impact of the regulation, its interference with reasonable investment backed expectations, and the character of the governmental action.(Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City), The decision thereby moved beyond the traditional notions of equal protection which had been applied to economic regulation since the time of (Lochner v. New York), requiring extreme deference to Congress, and applied a regulatory takings analysis to the problem resulting in a much less deferential result. [...] While the plurality recognizes that this is not a traditional takings case where the government appropriates private property for public use, they also state this is the type of case where the [...] "Armstrong Principle" [...] of preventing the government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in <b>all</b> <b>fairness</b> and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.

2500|$|Statements of {{equitable}} principle stretch {{back to the}} Ancient Greeks in {{the work}} of Aristotle, while examples of rules analogous to trusts were found in the Roman law testamentary institution of the fideicommissum, and the Islamic proprietary institution of the Waqf. [...] However, English trusts law is a largely indigenous development that began in the Middle Ages, {{from the time of the}} 11th and 12th century crusades. After William the Conqueror became King in 1066, one [...] "common law" [...] of England was created. Common law courts regarded property as an indivisible entity, as it had been under Roman law and continental versions of civil law. During the crusades, landowners who went to fight would transfer title to their land to a person they trusted so that feudal services could be performed and received. But many who returned found that the people they entrusted refused to transfer their title deed back. Sometimes, common law courts would not acknowledge that anybody had rights in the property except the holder of the legal title deeds. So claimants petitioned the King to sidestep the common law courts. The King delegated hearing of petitions to his Lord Chancellor, who established the Court of Chancery as more cases were heard. Where it appeared [...] "inequitable" [...] (i.e. unfair) to let someone with legal title hold onto land, the Lord Chancellor could declare that the real owner [...] "in equity" [...] (i.e. in <b>all</b> <b>fairness)</b> was another person, if this is what good conscience dictated. The Court of Chancery determined that the true [...] "use" [...] or [...] "benefit" [...] of property did not belong to the person on the title (or the feoffee who held seisin). The cestui que use, the owner in equity, could be a different person. So English law recognised a split between legal and equitable owner, between someone who controlled title and another for whose benefit the land would be used. It was the beginning of trust law. The same logic was useful for Franciscan friars, who would transfer title of land to others as they were precluded from holding property by their vows of poverty. When the courts said that one person's legal title to property was subject to an obligation to use that property for another person, there was a trust.|$|E
