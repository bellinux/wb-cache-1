Anticonvulsants, including phenytoin and carbamazepine, usually provide significant relief from the stiffness, muscle spasms, and pain associated with neuromyotonia. Plasma exchange and IVIg treatment may provide short-term relief for patients with some forms of the <b>acquired</b> <b>disorder.</b> It is speculated that the plasma exchange causes an interference with {{the function of the}} voltage-dependent potassium channels, one of the underlying issues of hyper-excitability in autoimmune neuromyotonia. Botox injections also provide short-term relief. Immunosuppressants, such as Prednisone may provide long term relief for patients with some forms of the <b>acquired</b> <b>disorder.</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Acquired</b> <b>disorders</b> of {{language}} represent loss of previously acquired skills, usually with relatively specific impairments. In children with developmental disorders {{of language}}, we may also see selective impairment in some skills; {{but in this}} case, the acquisition of language or literacy is affected from the outset. Because systems for processing spoken and written language change as they develop, we should beware of drawing too close a parallel between developmental and <b>acquired</b> <b>disorders.</b> Nevertheless, comparisons between the two may yield new insights. A key feature of connectionist models simulating <b>acquired</b> <b>disorders</b> is the interaction of components of language processing {{with each other and}} with other cognitive domains. This kind of model might help make sense of patterns of comorbidity in developmental disorders. Meanwhile, the study of developmental disorders emphasizes learning and change in underlying representations, allowing us to study how heterogeneity in cognitive profile may relate not just to neurobiology but also to experience. Children with persistent language difficulties pose challenges both to our efforts at intervention and to theories of learning of written and spoken language. Future attention to learning in individuals with developmental and <b>acquired</b> <b>disorders</b> could be of both theoretical and applied value...|$|R

40|$|Background: Limited data {{exist on}} the extent of {{specific}} functional sequelae, including <b>acquired</b> communication <b>disorder,</b> among Aboriginal stroke survivors, making planning of multidisciplinary services difficult. Aims: To obtain estimates of the extent and profile of <b>acquired</b> communication <b>disorder</b> in Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal adult stroke survivors in Western Australia and investigate potential disparities in receiving in-hospital speech pathology services among survivors with <b>acquired</b> communication <b>disorder.</b> Methods: Stroke cases surviving their first stroke episode during 2002 - 2011 were identified using Western Australia-wide person-based linked hospital and mortality data, and their five-year comorbidity profiles determined. The mid-year prevalence of stroke cases with <b>acquired</b> communication <b>disorder</b> was estimated for 2011. Regression methods were used to investigate determinants of receiving speech pathology services among <b>acquired</b> communication <b>disorder</b> cases. Results: Of 14, 757 stroke survivors aged 15 - 79 years admitted in 2002 - 2011, 33 % had <b>acquired</b> communication <b>disorder</b> (22 % aphasia/dysphasia) and 777 (5. 3 %) were Aboriginal. Aboriginal patients {{were more likely to be}} younger, live remotely, and have comorbidities. A diagnosis of aphasia was more common in Aboriginal than non-Aboriginal patients 15 - 44 years (p = 0. 003). A minimum of 107 Aboriginal and 2324 non-Aboriginal stroke patients with <b>acquired</b> communication <b>disorder</b> lived in Western Australia in 2011. Aboriginal status was not associated with receiving in-hospital speech services among <b>acquired</b> communication <b>disorder</b> patients in unadjusted or adjusted models. Conclusions: The relative youth, geographical distribution, high comorbidity prevalence, and cultural needs of Aboriginal stroke patients with <b>acquired</b> communication <b>disorder</b> should inform appropriate service design for speech pathology and rehabilitation. Innovative models are required to address workforce issues, given low patient volumes. Â© 2016 World Stroke Organization...|$|R

Additionally, ectopia may be present but asymptomatic until whiplash causes it to become symptomatic. Posterior fossa hypoplasia causes reduced cerebral and spinal compliance.|$|R

50|$|In animals, when feminization {{occurs in}} a male, or at an {{inappropriate}} developmental age, it is often due to a genetic or <b>acquired</b> <b>disorder</b> of the endocrine system. In humans, {{one of the more}} common manifestations of abnormal feminization is gynecomastia, the inappropriate development of breasts which may result from elevated levels of feminizing hormones such as estrogens. Deficiency or blockage of virilizing hormones (androgens) can also contribute to feminization. In some cases, high levels of androgens may produce both virilizing effects (increased body hair, deepened voice, increased muscle mass, etc.) and feminizing effects (gynecomastia) since androgens can be converted to estrogens by aromatase in the peripheral tissues.|$|E
50|$|This {{is a rare}} {{inflammatory}} {{condition of}} the minor salivary glands, usually in the lower lip, which appears swollen and everted. There may also be ulceration, crusting, abscesses, and sinus tracts. It is an <b>acquired</b> <b>disorder,</b> but the cause is uncertain. Suspected causes include sunlight, tobacco, syphilis, poor oral hygiene and genetic factors. The openings of the minor salivary gland ducts become inflamed and dilated, {{and there may be}} mucopurulent discharge from the ducts. A previous classification suggested dividing cheilitis into 3 types based on severity, with the later stages involving secondary infection with bacteria, and increased ulceration, suppuration and swelling: Type 1, Simple; Type 2, Superficial suppurative ("Baelz's disease"); and Type 3, Deep suppurative ("cheilitis glandularis epostemetosa"). Cheilitis glandularis usually occurs in middle-aged and elderly males, and it carries a risk of malignant transformation to squamous cell carcinoma (18% to 35%). Preventative treatment such as vermilionectomy ("lip shave") is therefore the treatment of choice.|$|E
