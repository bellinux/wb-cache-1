40|$|Attitude {{determination}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important prerequisites for the implementation of an <b>air</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>table.</b> In this context, computer vision is shown to be an enabling technology; a cost-effective monocular camera vision system, including hardware setup and navigation software, has been developed to determine the attitude of the <b>air</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>table.</b> Both infrared light-emitting diodes and filter are selected to simplify image processing, thereby maximizing the attitude update rate. Afiducial marker system uses five infrared light-emitting diodes with four in the same plane and the fifth outside the plane. This noncoplanar design not only improves the attitude determination accuracy, but also provides an element of robustness via a fiducial marker fault diagnosis and process method in case one of the lightemitting diodes is obscured by the top balance mass or is faulty. The static experimental results show that the system can provide attitude accuracy of 0. 06 deg and angular velocity accuracy of 0. 15 deg /s with an attitude update rate of at least 10 Hz. Finally, a yaw-axis maneuver is performed to demonstrate the system performance under dynamic conditions.

The facility is aimed at testing and validating guidance, navigation and control algorithms for nanosat formation flying, rendezvous and proximity operations. To simulate the spacecraft motion dynamics in the terrestrial environment the micro-gravity conditions must be recreated adequately.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the fast-growing}} society of CubeSat developers, the {{necessity}} of CubeSat ground tests is apparent. One of the more complex and discussed system-level tests is the Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS) examination. It requires motions of the CubeSat and environment conditions close to space. Most of the ADCS testbeds involve an <b>air</b> <b>bearing</b> {{as one of the}} main component of a rotating table since it allows reducing the friction between the moving CubeSat and fixed elements. However, such rotating tables have common drawbacks. Notably, they allow CubeSat rotations only in a limited range of angles, usually within ± 45 °. In this paper, an innovative approach to use <b>air</b> <b>bearings,</b> which allows circumventing this limitation, is discussed. The proposed testbed involves 4 <b>air</b> <b>bearings</b> instead of only one. The <b>air</b> <b>bearings</b> are placed so that their effective surfaces lie on a sphere.

The inlet restrictor design is significant for <b>air</b> <b>bearings</b> because it affects the static and dynamic performance of the <b>air</b> <b>bearing.</b> For instance pocketed orifice bearings give higher load capacity as compared to inherently compensated orifice type bearings, however inherently compensated orifices, also known as laminar flow restrictors are known to give highly stable <b>air</b> <b>bearing</b> systems (less prone to pneumatic hammer) as compared to pocketed orifice <b>air</b> <b>bearing</b> systems. However, they are not commonly used because of the difficulties encountered in manufacturing and assembly of the orifice designs.

Based on Reynolds equation and mass conservation equation for incompressible flow, the steady state characteristics are studied while the dynamic state characteristics are performed {{in a similar manner}} however, using the above equations for compressible flow. Steady state experiments were also performed for a single orifice <b>air</b> <b>bearing</b> and the results are compared to that obtained from theoretical studies. A technique to ease the assembly of orifices with the <b>air</b> <b>bearing</b> plate has also been discussed so as to make the manufacturing of the inherently compensated bearings more commercially viable.
