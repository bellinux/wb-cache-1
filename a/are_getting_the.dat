25|$|New {{forms of}} New Media are {{emerging}} like Web 2.0 tools Facebook and YouTube, along with {{video games and}} the consoles they are played on. It is helping to make video games and video game consoles branch out into New Media as well. Gamers on YouTube post videos of them playing video games they like and {{that people want to}} watch. Cultural changes are happening because people can upload their gaming experiences to a Web 2.0 tool like Facebook and YouTube for the world to see. Consoles like the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 have WiFi connectivity and chat rooms on most of their video games that allow gamer-to-gamer conversations around the world. They also allow people to connect to YouTube, so if they stream/record a gamer, it allows for easy uploading to YouTube for the world to see. Even the older video game consoles are becoming new media because YouTube can display the walkthroughs and let's plays of the game. YouTube gaming is evolving because some YouTubers are getting wealthy and earning money from their videos. The more people that become YouTube members, the popular YouTube becomes and the more it starts emerging as a new source of media, along with video games and consoles. The chat room/online gaming/WiFi consoles <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> highest increase in popularity because they are not only the most advanced, but because of the newest video games being created {{that the majority of the}} gaming community wants to buy, play and watch. The older video games and consoles also get popularity, but from YouTube's capabilities of uploading them to the gamer's channels for everyone to see. The older games get popularity from the communities nostalgia of the game(s), and the old school graphics and gameplay that made people see how old-school technology was the best at some point in time. Facebook helps those video games and consoles get popularity as well. People can upload the videos they create to Facebook as well. Facebook is a much larger website with a lot more users, so people use Facebook to spread their gaming content as well.|$|E
500|$|On March 24, while {{investigating}} a lovers' lane in heavy rain, Ramsey hears gunshots and finds Howard W. Turner {{dead in a}} ditch and the corpse of his girlfriend, Emma Lou Cook, tied to a tree. Ramsey spots the hooded man escaping in a car. Panicked, the town sells out of guns and other home safety equipment. Sheriff Barker calls in help and tells Ramsey they <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> most famous criminal investigator in the country, the [...] "Lone Wolf" [...] of the Texas Rangers, Captain J.D. Morales. After arriving, Morales explains {{he will be in}} charge of the investigation and calls the unidentified attacker a Phantom. Ramsey is assigned to assist Morales, and Patrolman A.C. [...] "Sparkplug" [...] Benson is to be his driver.|$|E
5000|$|Simon - Three-year-old Simon {{is having}} strange, {{destructive}} fits, and Tania <b>is</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> blame for everything he does.|$|R
50|$|She {{also feels}} sorry {{for his new}} girlfriend, because she has the concept that a cheater {{will always be a}} cheater, and while she <b>is</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> prizes of her future, all <b>the</b> lover <b>gets</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> cheater boyfriend.|$|R
5000|$|Suketu Patel, {{chairman}} of the Seychelles Football Federation (SFF) conceded [...] "We thought we <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> real Andy Morrison".|$|R
2500|$|Things like sugar pills, {{that look}} like real {{treatments}} but in fact have no physical effect are used to create [...] "blind" [...] trials in which the participants {{do not know whether}} they <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> active treatment or not, so that physical effects can be measured independently of the participants' expectations. Single Blind trials control all of these by making whatever expectations there are equal for all cases.|$|E
2500|$|One form {{of dietary}} {{supplement}} is inositol hexanicotinate (IHN), which is inositol {{that has been}} esterified with niacin on all six of inositol's alcohol groups. IHN is usually sold as [...] "flush-free" [...] or [...] "no-flush" [...] niacin in units of 250, 500, or 1000mg/tablets or capsules. It is sold as an over-the-counter formulation, and often is marketed and labeled as niacin, thus misleading consumers into thinking they <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> active form of the medication. [...] While this form of niacin does not cause the flushing associated with the immediate-release products, the evidence that it has lipid-modifying functions is disputed. As the clinical trials date from the early 1960s (Dorner, Welsh) or the late 1970s (Ziliotto, Kruse, Agusti), {{it is difficult to}} assess them by today's standards. One of the last of those studies affirmed the superiority of inositol and xantinol esters of nicotinic acid for reducing serum free fatty acid, but other studies conducted during the same period found no benefit. Studies explain that this is primarily because [...] "flush-free" [...] preparations do not contain any free nicotinic acid. [...] A more recent placebo-controlled trial was small (n=11/group), but results after three months at 1500mg/day showed no trend for improvements in total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C or triglycerides. Thus, so far there is not enough evidence to recommend IHN to treat dyslipidemia.|$|E
2500|$|Some thinkers like neuroscientist and philosopher Adina Roskies {{think these}} studies can still only show, unsurprisingly, that {{physical}} {{factors in the}} brain are involved before decision making. In contrast, Haggard believes that [...] "We feel we choose, but we don't". Researcher John-Dylan Haynes adds [...] "How can I call a will 'mine' if I don't even know when it occurred and what it has decided to do?". Philosophers Walter Glannon and Alfred Mele think some scientists <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> science right, but misrepresenting modern philosophers. This is mainly because [...] "free will" [...] can mean many things: It is unclear what someone means when they say [...] "free will does not exist". Mele and Glannon say that the available research is more evidence against any dualistic notions of free will – but that is an [...] "easy target for neuroscientists to knock down". Mele says that most discussions of free will are now had in materialistic terms. In these cases, [...] "free will" [...] means something more like [...] "not coerced" [...] or that [...] "the person could have done otherwise at the last moment". The existence {{of these types of}} free will is debatable. Mele agrees, however, that science will continue to reveal critical details about {{what goes on in the}} brain during decision making.|$|E
60|$|Seeing that ill-humor <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> {{better of}} the small supply of wit in the company, Franz cast himself into the breach again.|$|R
50|$|As of January 2017, the technology's {{cryptographic}} {{logic is}} done {{and a team of}} 12 <b>is</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> service ready for a first release.|$|R
60|$|The cleverness of that excuse tickled {{the boys}} immensely; and Sam tried again, while Ben <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> dog down {{and sitting on}} him.|$|R
2500|$|When Chauvel {{arrived in}} Damascus, {{he told his}} staff [...] "to pitch my camp in a clean orchard {{just out of the}} city, which I thought would suit me better after what I had seen of the place. I then went back to my camp, had lunch, and became {{immersed}} in problems of supply, collection of prisoners, orders for the morrow, etc., sending off first of all an aeroplane message to Lord Allenby, telling him what I had done." [...] He also sent for the British Supply Officer of the Hejaz Forces. [...] "Before discussing supply matters, however, he ... said 'they are out to make as little as possible of the British and make the populace think that it is the Arabs who have driven out the Turk. This is why Lawrence asked you to keep your men out of the city and they have no intention of asking you for any police.' He also said 'They <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> British Consulate ready for you. If you go there you are not defining yourself as the Conqueror of this country, but rather as a contributory ally. You should take possession of Djemal Pasha's house, which is the best one in the place, and which they are reserving for Feisal.' He said there was absolute chaos in the city, the Bazaars were closed and all the better class of people were terrified at the idea of the Hejaz crowd being in charge." [...] As a result, Chauvel decided to march through the city the following day, with [...] "practically every unit being represented; guns, armoured cars, everything, and I also took possession of Djemal's house." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{when you}} have given it a fair trial, you can turn to {{something}} else. You <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> school up again, which {{is at least one}} testimony." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look, Dick, {{there is}} a movement; they <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> guns in {{position}} on that knoll {{a little to the}} right, and a hundred yards or so in front of their tent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Myrtle hasn't any proper clothes," [...] {{observed}} Patsy, reflectively. [...] "We'll have to {{shop for}} her, Beth, while Uncle <b>is</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> car ready." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But look at me! I've just <b>been</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> gooseberries. Look!" [...] {{she showed}} us the berries, and the {{scratches}} on her arms and hands.|$|R
60|$|So we watched, till <b>the</b> bull that <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> {{worst of}} it backed near me, and got my wind, and the fight was over.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is a {{question}} whether they or we <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> worst of this business," [...] I added, trying to speak calmly, as had my comrades; but making a bad job of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "We've {{got to take}} a hand in this row, Teddy. Mr. Sweet {{has given}} us the chance to sleep here, and the least we can do is to help as much as possible, for it appears to me that his men <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> worst of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Norgate smiled. [...] "Too much {{common sense}} about us, I think, Mr. Selingman, for such happenings," [...] he declared. [...] "I grant {{you that the}} classes <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> worst of it so far as regards the {{government}} of the country, but I can't quite see the future that you depict." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{listeners}} showed relief. One or {{two questions}} were asked, and Leonard, {{feeling that he}} <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> better of the situation, went on gravely.|$|R
60|$|It {{was with}} great satisfaction, too, {{that she thought}} of the cost of all this. A great deal of money had been paid for that yacht, and it had relieved, as {{scarcely}} any other expenditure she would be likely to make could have relieved, the strain upon her mind occasioned by the pressure of her income. Even after the building of her new apartments her money had <b>been</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> better of her. Now she felt that she <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> better of her money.|$|R
6000|$|So far, Alice felt, she <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> {{worst of}} the conversation. She changed the subject. [...] "Have you been to Wiltstoken since I last saw you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|On Monday {{morning he}} was up early. [...] "Now let's get to work," [...] he said. [...] "I can't hoe as I used to do, and the weeds <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> start of me." [...] To him the garden was a battlefield, a contest with {{purslane}} and he hated to be worsted.|$|E
60|$|In {{the street}} the {{disturbance}} had now become terrible. Both sides were hard at it, and the Irishmen on the roof, rewarded at last for their long vigil, were yelling encouragement promiscuously and whooping with the unfettered ecstasy {{of men who}} <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> treat of their lives without having paid a penny for it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have noticed}} several times," [...] Scudamore said, [...] "that Easton's play depends {{very much on}} the state of the game: if we <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> best of it he seems to think that there is no {{occasion}} to exert himself, but if the game is going against us he pulls himself together and goes into it with all his might." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Is no what {{it should}} be. There's na doot aboot that; it's no {{what it should}} be." [...] The face of the young Scotchman darkened still more. Pat flashed him a look of understanding. [...] "We'll talk that over by and by," [...] said he. [...] "Just now we're half famished. My, but that stew smells good. I'll unpack while you <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> stuff ready. With that {{toboggan}} in here there isn't room to turn around." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now then, let us set to work. Here {{are plenty}} of porters but, first of all, we had better get ten men from the officer of the guard here; and send one off, {{with each of the}} porters with the fish, to the regiments--or the chances are that these baskets will be a good bit lighter, by the time they arrive there, than when they start. I will go and ask the officer; while you <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> fish up here, and divided." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh yes, {{they are}} to be bought in the open market. It is like this, Maude. The mine was a very good one, and paid {{handsome}} dividends. Then it had some misfortunes. First, there was no water, and then there was too much water, and the workings were flooded. So, of course, the price of the shares fell. Now they <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> mine all right again, but the shares are still low. It certainly seems a very good chance to pick a few of them up.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Black Paul {{answered}} quietly: [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> men on board," [...] he said, [...] "so as to save time, and I {{was coming}} back for you." ...|$|R
