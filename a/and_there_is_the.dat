25|$|The {{headquarters}} {{consisted of}} a number of buildings centered around two villas: Villa Rossi, which was inhabited by the Corps commander himself, and Villa Calvi, occupied by his Chief of Staff. The entire garrison {{consisted of a}}round 300 German soldiers. The assault itself would see the British SAS company and a number of Italians force their way into the two villas, while the Russian company would place themselves between the villas and the other buildings, preventing the rest of the garrison from intervening. The partisans were able to approach the villas without being spotted, quietly eliminating several sentries in the process. However, their plan to use their bazooka to gain entry to the villa was trashed when it misfired. They were able to reach the interior of the villa by force, but fierce German resistance meant they were unable to move upstairs and kill the Chief of Staff; they therefore used explosives, petrol and looted furniture to set the villa on fire, ensuring that the remaining Germans stayed inside with bursts of machine gun fire. Although effective, this conflagration meant that the Germans in Villa Rossi were alerted to the attack before the group of partisans attacking the villa could begin their assault; as in the other villa, the occupants put up a stiff resistance and stymied attempts by the partisans to reach the top floor. A number of Germans were killed in the firefight, however, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> possibility that one of these was the Corps commander. Under heavy fire, the partisans retreated after setting fire to the villa's kitchen.|$|E

500|$|However, {{already in}} quantum {{mechanics}} {{there is one}} [...] "caveat", namely the particles acting onto each other do not only possess the spatial variable, but also a discrete [...] intrinsic angular momentum-like variable called the [...] "spin", <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Pauli principle relating the space and the spin variables. Depending {{on the value of}} the spin, identical particles split into two different classes, fermions and bosons. [...] If two identical fermions (e.g. electrons) have a symmetric spin function (e.g. [...] parallel spins) the spatial variables must be antisymmetric (i.e. they exclude each other from their places much as if there was a repulsive force), and vice versa, i.e. for antiparallel spins the position variables must be symmetric (i.e. the apparent force must be attractive). Thus in the case of two fermions there is a strictly negative correlation between spatial and spin variables, whereas for two bosons (e.g. quanta of electromagnetic waves, photons) the correlation is strictly positive.|$|E

Crowley's political thought was studied by academic Marco Pasi, who noted that for Crowley, socio-political concerns were subordinate to metaphysical and spiritual ones. Pasi {{argued that it was}} difficult to classify Crowley as being either on the political left or right but he was perhaps best categorised as a [...] "conservative revolutionary" [...] despite not being affiliated with the German-based conservative revolutionary movement. Pasi noted that Crowley sympathised with extreme ideologies like Nazism and Marxism-Leninism, in that they wished to violently overturn society and hoped that both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union might adopt Thelema. Crowley described democracy as an [...] "imbecile and nauseating cult of weakness," [...] and commented that The Book of the Law proclaimed that [...] "there is the master <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> slave; the noble and the serf; the 'lone wolf' and the herd". In this attitude he was influenced by the work of Friedrich Nietzsche and by Social Darwinism.
