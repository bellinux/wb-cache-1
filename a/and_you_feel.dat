500|$|Bono and guitarist The Edge {{had been}} reading works by {{cyberpunk}} author William Gibson, who wrote about a futuristic urban environment known as [...] "The Sprawl". [...] Gibson was an influence in {{the texture of the}} song, which Bono described as [...] "fucked up sci-fi". [...] Bono wanted to use noise to create a visual setting for the song, similar to Gibson's futuristic world, filled with advertisements on LED displays and neon signs, as in the 1982 film Blade Runner. [...] With [...] "Zooropa" [...] as the album's opening song, Bono stated that he wanted the album's music to be like [...] "legal drugs" [...] that would create a trip where [...] "you come out of the other end <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> like you've been on some kind of a journey". The closing song on the album, [...] "The Wanderer", features Johnny Cash on vocals, and was intended on being the [...] "antidote" [...] to the futuristic-sounding opener.|$|E

500|$|On September 9, Feldman threw {{seven innings}} of shutout ball against the Cleveland Indians, leading Texas to a 10–0 win. [...] He struck out five, while giving up five singles, raising his record to 16–4, and tying Sabathia and Verlander for the AL lead in victories. [...] He {{became the first}} Rangers pitcher to win 16 games since Kevin Millwood in 2006. [...] It was his seventh win in a row, eighth {{straight}} road victory (a new Texas record), and 12th road win overall in 2009 (another new club record, and tops in the AL). [...] "I'm not doing anything different on the road than I am at home", said Feldman, who had allowed only one run in the last 26.1 innings. [...] "The preparation is the same. [...] I think it's a pretty humbling game, so you can't get too high or too low." [...] He became the first Rangers right-hander to allow just one run over four consecutive starts. [...] Outfielder Marlon Byrd said: [...] "When you have your ace on the mound, you expect to win. You {{get a couple of}} runs early, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> you have a 'W' in hand.

2500|$|This [...] "opaque" [...] {{technique}} has been Godard's trademark style for many years. In 1995 Jean-Michel Frodon described the same complexities as Bordwell and wrote that when viewing a Godard film {{there are moments}} when one has the tendency to resist the experience. As the film unfolds you are suddenly confused, you don't quite grasp something <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> like you are losing your footing. On the point of drowning one is liable to think Godard is vague and obscure but then there is a maritime movement/shift and if one lets oneself be carried by the next wave that comes one soon recovers the drift of the film.|$|E

The American Left lauded {{it as an}} allegory against blacklisting and McCarthyism, but it gained respect in the {{conservative}} community as well.

2500|$|Tyler {{released}} {{one more}} album with Columbia Records in 1988. It was released {{under the name}} Hide Your Heart in Europe, and Notes From America in the United States. Prolific songwriters for the album included Michael Bolton, Albert Hammond and Desmond Child, who also produced the album. The album enjoyed some success in continental Europe, but only peaked at No. 78 in the UK and failed to chart in the United States. The singles from Hide Your Heart were minor hits for Tyler, but went on to be major hits for other artists, including Kiss (with [...] "Hide Your Heart"), Robin Beck, Cher and Freda Payne (with [...] "Save Up All Your Tears") and Tina Turner with [...] "The Best". When looking back over this era, Desmond Child said:Bonnie Tyler {{is one of the}} greatest singers on Earth. Why? Because she comes to the studio prepared. I've never even seen her use a lyric sheet to sing. She comes with the song memorized, so when she stands there and sings, she closes her eyes.
