Participants were then {{randomly assigned to one}} of two experimental conditions, i.e., the airport operator either fulfilling stakeholders’ claims (thereby favoring non-shareholding stakeholders) or not fulfilling stakeholders’ claims (thereby favoring shareholders). For example, participants assigned to airline customers’ claim to reduce <b>airport</b> <b>fees</b> were either informed that the airport operator decided to fulfill the airline customers’ claim by reducing <b>airport</b> <b>fees</b> (favoring non-shareholding stakeholders) or to deny the airline customers’ claim by not reducing <b>airport</b> <b>fees</b> (favoring shareholders).|$|R

40|$|I will state my {{conclusion}} at the outset. I am {{not convinced}} that lawyers 2 ̆ 7 investments in clients in lieu of fees are problematic enough from a conflicts standpoint that the rules of professional responsibility should treat them as presumptively inconsistent with the lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s fiduciary responsibility. Lawyers 2 ̆ 7 investments in their clients do raise interesting and unsettling issues, but these issues are not qualitatively different from issues raised by many other norms or practices within the legal profession that also threaten lawyerly objectivity. Indeed, in contrast to some other practices, these <b>fee</b> <b>arrangements</b> can, in some respects, enhance objectivity, or at least balance {{out some of the}} agency-cost problems that otherwise infect attorney-client relationships in the corporate setting. If so, broadly banning these <b>fee</b> <b>arrangements</b> in the name of fiduciary responsibility makes little sense. My aim here, in large part, is to speak to the 2 ̆ 2 good lawyer 2 ̆ 2 about what objectivity and prudence really mean in a world where serious wealth has become the metric for professional success, and how both law and ethics ought to respond to the residual problems caused by these <b>fee</b> <b>arrangements...</b>|$|R

40|$|This article {{develops}} {{an analytical}} framework for viewing {{the rules on}} attorney <b>fee</b> <b>arrangements</b> that have been adopted in the United States and in major western European countries. In section II the paper explains the choice of economic agency theory {{as a starting point}} for developing this framework. Within the meaning of economic agency, the attorney is a dual agent, with duties to both the client and the judicial system. In section III the paper identifies five interests that form the basis for evaluating fee systems. These interests are derived from applying basic agency theory to the duties of the attorney as an agent of both the client and the judicial system, and extracting the more specific aspects of both types of duties. In sections IV and V the interest analysis is applied to three types of <b>fee</b> <b>arrangements</b> [...] the fixed fee, the hourly fee, and the contingency fee. We select these types of <b>fee</b> <b>arrangements</b> because they represents key distinct elements, one or more of which seems to be present in any of the fee systems used in the United States or in western Europe. The key distinct element of the fixed fee is that the attorney will be paid the amount agreed upon, without regard to effort or to risk. The key distinct element of the hourly fee is that the attorney will be compensated based on effort, as measured by time spent working, without regard to a fixed amount or to risk. The key distinct element of the contingency fee is that the attorney is compensated for assuming risk, without regard to an agreed upon amount or effort expended. By isolating the way these three distinct types of <b>fee</b> <b>arrangements</b> affect interests that are important in all of the western fees systems, we build a framework for evaluating the many <b>fee</b> <b>arrangements</b> that utilize and combine these key elements, such as the United Kingdom 2 ̆ 7 s new conditional fee system. This framework avoids the dominant tendency of the literature to focus on the flaws of a particular fee system in isolation from its alternatives...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Funds {{of funds}} are an {{increasingly}} popular avenue for hedge fund investment. Despite the increasing interest in hedge funds {{as an alternative}} asset class, {{the high degree of}} fund specific risk and the lack of transparency may give fiduciaries pause. In addition, many of the most attractive hedge funds are closed to new investment. Funds of funds resolve these issues by providing investors with diversification across manager styles and professional oversight of fund operations that can provide the necessary degree of due diligence. In addition, many such funds hold shares in hedge funds otherwise closed to new investment allowing smaller investors access to the most sought-after managers. However, the diversification, oversight and access comes at the cost of a multiplication of the fees paid by the investor. It is not generally understood that the incentive fee component of the <b>fee</b> on <b>fee</b> <b>arrangement</b> may under certain circumstances exceed the realized return on the fund. In this paper we argue that the disappointing after fee performance of some fund of funds may be explained by the nature of this <b>fee</b> <b>arrangement.</b> We examine an alternative <b>fee</b> <b>arrangement</b> that may provide better incentives at a lower cost to investors in these funds.
