Efficient operation of dynamic sensor network based on <b>air</b> <b>node</b> is possible when problems of processing time, data transmission reliability, power consumption and intermittent connectivity are solved. Delay tolerant network (DTN) can be a desirable alternative to solve those problems. DTN using store-and-forward message switching technology is a solution to intermittent network connectivity, long and variable delay time, asymmetric data rates, and high error rates. However, all processes are performed at the bundle layer, so high power consumption, long processing time, and repeated reliability technique occur. DSN based on swarming flight type <b>air</b> <b>node</b> need to adopt store-and-forward message switching technique of DTN, the cancelation scheme of repeated reliability technique, fast processing time with simplified layer composition...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Wind-induced ventilation {{has the potential to}} reduce cooling energy use in buildings. One method this can be achieved is by the use of night-time ventilation to cool down the structure of a building, resulting in lower air and radiant temperatures during the day. To design effective naturally ventilated buildings, evaluation tools are needed that are able to assess the performance of a building. The primary goal of this work was to develop such a tool, that is suitable for use in annual building energy simulation. The model presented, is intermediate in complexity between a CFD numerical model and current single <b>air</b> <b>node</b> models, having seven nodes. The thesis describes how numerical and experimental data have been used to develop the structure and define the parameters of the simplified nodal model. Numerical calculations of the flow and temperature fields have been made with a coupled flow and radiant exchange CFD code. Numerically derived velocity dependent convective heat transfer coefficients are compared with experimental measurements made in room ventilated by cross-flow means, and with empirical correlations cited by other studies. Bulk convection between the air nodes of the simplified nodal model has been derived from a numerical study of contaminant dispersal. The performance of the model is demonstrated by making comparisons with the predictions of a single <b>air</b> <b>node</b> model...|$|E
40|$|The airflow {{network model}} in EnergyPlus {{provides}} {{the ability to}} simulate multizone wind-driven airflows. The model is also able to simulate the impacts of forced air distribution systems, including supply and return air leaks. The air distribution system portion of the model is currently applicable for constant-air-volume systems. Future enhancements will include adding hybrid ventilation control and possible extension to include variable-air-volume distribution systems. This paper describes the input objects, calculation procedures, model validation, and example results. The model inputs consist of five main objects: simulation control, multizone data, node data, component data, and linkage data. The model calculates pressure at each node and airflow through each component based on the pressure versus airflow relationship defined for each component. Using these airflow rates and HVAC equipment models, temperature and humidity ratio at each <b>air</b> <b>node</b> are then calculated. All cooling/heating loads resulting from the multizone airflow and air distribution system model are then summed and passed to EnergyPlus ’ zone air heat and moisture balance model which calculates zone air temperature and humidity ratio. The loads from multizone air flows are used to predict required system loads, while the loads due to the air distribution system are used to recalculate zone air temperatures and humidity ratios. EnergyPlus ’ airflow network model was validated against measured data from both the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and the Florida Solar Energy Center (FSEC). Whole building energy simulations were performed using EnergyPlus in addition to validating specific portions of its airflow network model. There was good agreement between the simulation results and the measured data...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. repository@lboro. ac. ukCooling and ventilation of office spaces by displacement ventilation and chilled ceiling panel systems is potentially more energy efficient than conventional air conditioning systems. Heat transfer {{in this type of}} system is characterised by the presence of vertical temperature gradients and significant radiant asymmetry. The room heat transfer models used in current building simulation methods do not allow adequate representation of this type of system due to their reliance on a single node to define the internal air temperature. The overall aim of the work described in the thesis has been to develop a model of this type of system that is suitable for use in annual building energy simulation. The model presented, is intermediate in complexity between a CFD numerical model and the current single <b>air</b> <b>node</b> models, having ten air nodes. The operating characteristics of displacement ventilation systems, used both with and without chilled ceiling panels, have been studied by making experimental measurements in a test chamber and by reference to published experimental data. Numerical calculations of the flow and temperature fields have been made with a coupled flow and radiant exchange CFD code. Steady state calculations have been made of displacement ventilation using a conjugate heat transfer method. Interesting oscillations in the flow and temperature field of displacement ventilation operating with a chilled ceiling have been found through adopting a fully transient calculation procedure. The thesis describes how the experimental and numerical data has been used to develop the structure and define the parameters of a simplified nodal model. The logical development of the model structure, from the most elementary model to one which is able to capture the effects of the temperature gradients and incomp 1 ete mixing of the air in the room is described. A method is also presented whereby the parameters of the model are found directly from the experimental data by solving the heat and mass balance equations of the nodal model. The parameters of the model have been generalised by analysing these calculations and by making use of established convection coefficient correlations. The performance of the model is demonstrated by firstly making comparisons of the experimental and numerical data under steady state conditions, and also by demonstrating that the model is able to reproduce the characteristics of displacement ventilation and chilled ceiling systems under different operating conditions...|$|E

The {{aim of this}} tool is to enable the user {{to set up a}} geometrically correct thermal model for complex geometries that allows predicting the impact of heated/heating devices and their location both in terms of airflow pattern and radiation distribution. Using a geometry file exported from CAD software, the tool distributes wall facets, <b>air</b> <b>nodes</b> and computes the long-wave radiant view factor matrix for obstructed and unobstructed surfaces.

In their work they start by defining the threats that affect the most these networks and which can be directed not only against the basic mechanisms but also against the security mechanisms themselves. Regarding the vulnerabilities affecting basic mechanisms, they highlight the risk of nodes being hijacked, eavesdropping, active interferences as the communication are carried out over the <b>air,</b> non-cooperative <b>nodes,</b> vulnerabilities related to the routing mechanisms and malicious neighbour discovery. Regarding the vulnerabilities affecting the security mechanisms directly, they address mainly the risks of cryptographic keys being compromised or replaced with other keys. In order to protect the basic mechanisms their choice is to use tamper resistant hardware and smart cards to protect the cryptographic information, while also aiming to protect the routing mechanisms by using watchdogs and rating paths in combination with intrusion detection systems (IDSs). Finally, in order to enforce the service, they use a virtual currency called nuglets as a cooperation incentive.|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, the {{application}} of active cooling in office buildings is hardly questioned in building practices. Also in temperate climates, active cooling is often {{assumed to be a}} necessary condition for a good thermal comfort. However, an optimal building design {{can go a long way}} towards reducing the cooling load. For example, night cooling can maintain thermal comfort during the day, by pre-cooling the building at night using cool exterior air at high air change rates. By day, the thermal mass buffers the heat released in the building, thereby reducing and delaying air temperature peaks. To address this, a thorough study is made of the transient behaviour of a room with night ventilation. The methodology can be subdivided into three main parts, a first part being numerical, a second part experimental and a third part focussing on implementation in BES models. The numerical CFD study focusses on obtaining a better insight in the transient surface heat transfer during night ventilation. In particular, the study takes into account the influence of thermal mass by including concrete slabs as floor and ceiling in the model. Furthermore, the transient behaviour of the air-mass system is simulated for different air change rates and initial indoor-outdoor temperature differences. The influence of excluding radiation from the model is investigated, as well as the impact of geometrical variations. Interesting conclusions could be drawn regarding the unsteady flow pattern. Three flow patterns were observed: buoyant flow, forced flow and transition flow, which is the intermediate regime between the first two flow regimes. The flow pattern strongly influenced the corresponding local surface convection. However, as this numerical study is limited to 2 D with simplified geometry and constant boundary conditions, only qualitative conclusions can be drawn. An experimental study is required to confirm the observed phenomena. The second part of the study will therefore discuss the measurements conducted in a full scale test room under realistic climatic boundary conditions. As was the case in the numerical model, the thermal mass is also provided in the experimental set-up, by including two 15 cm thick concrete slabs as floor and ceiling. The room has dimensions close to a one-cell office, and is exposed to the climate through a SW-oriented façade with automated hopper window. The room is provided with more than 200 sensors for a detailed monitoring of air, surface and mass temperatures, along with surface heat flux, air velocity and pressure difference. Apart from the mechanical ventilation, the room is free floating. The measurements provide a detailed insight into the phenomena occurring during night ventilation under realistic circumstances. They allow confronting the assumptions made in BES models with reality and confirm the tendencies that were observed in the numerical study, such as the three flow regimes. The determination of the air change rate proved challenging and was investigated with tracer gas experiments. Furthermore, a detailed analysis was made of the thermal response of the room. Though determination of convective heat transfer coefficients was not possible with sufficient accuracy, the assumptions used in BES models could be confronted with the measurement results. Smoke visualisation experiments were conducted to determine a correlation between thermal parameters and flow behaviour. These findings are confronted with literature. Finally, a number of selected nights are simulated with CFD as well, illustrating that CFD must be used with extreme care. The final part of the study focusses on the implementation in BES models. The room is simulated in TRNSYS 17, using the results of a four week measurement campaign as boundary conditions and verification data.

40|$|Nelumbo nucifera (Gaertn.) grows by {{extending}} a creeping rhizome through anaerobic sediments. Nodes form at intervals along the rhizome, each producing a single leaf, and gas canals channel {{air from the}} leaves throughout the petioles and rhizomes. The gas flow pathway was mapped by casting the canals in growing shoots with silicone and by blowing air through complexes of rhizomes and petioles. Air from a leaf flows to a rhizome through one of two petiolar canal pairs, joining with the lowermost of three canal pairs in the rhizome through a chamber in the node. The lowermost canal pair links these nodal chambers {{along the length of}} a rhizome, allowing <b>air</b> from a <b>node</b> to flow both forward, toward a growing shoot, and backward, toward preceding leaves. These linked chambers also connect with the middle pair of canals on their proximal side, enabling flow to proceed backward along the rhizome to an adjacent node. A chamber in the next node then diverts the flow into the upper canal pair. This pair leads to a third node and chamber from which the air vents to the atmosphere through the second petiolar canal pair. Thus, pressurised air from one leaf must flow backward through two nodes before it returns to the atmosphere. Forward flow also ventilates a shoot 2 ̆ 7 s growing tip, with air from the lowermost canal pair entering a chamber in the developing node which, as described above, connects with the middle canal.

WSNs are used, for example, in many industrial and consumer applications, such as industrial process monitoring and control, machine health monitoring, environment and habitat monitoring, healthcare applications, traffic control, etc. The nodes of the WSN may comprise sensor nodes (SNs) and one or more cluster head (CH) nodes. Cluster-head nodes are used as managing nodes when a WSN is divided into one or more clusters containing plural sensor nodes and one cluster head node. The sensor nodes are connected to one (or sometimes several) other sensor nodes, wherein their data are forwarded to a respective cluster head which transmit the aggregated information to the sink. A sensor node has typically several parts: a transceiver with an antenna or connection to an antenna, a microcontroller, an electronic circuit for interfacing with the sensors and an energy source, e.g. a battery or an embedded form of energy harvesting. The topology of a WSN can vary from a simple star shape to a multi-hop mesh network.|$|R

Instead of appearing to be physically and mentally defective, this threat occurs in the form of environment, which is invisible and can only be experienced unconsciously. With the current average of 660, 000 people dying in China, and approximately $ 17, 000, 000 spent annually on cleaning up its air, Beijing cannot afford to rely on its soft health policies and its air tax anymore.

This thesis will, therefore, serve as a platform for questioning and investigating the relationship between architecture and the polluted environments through the discussions of the historical, theoretical, and political aspects of air. Looking at human as its subject, this thesis looks into the survival scenarios that Beijing government will implement as its civilian air defense strategy. One hypothesis can be taken that these interventions will also be coupled with the existing network of Beijing's underground network, including the subway stations, to mutually serve as defensive urban infrastructure. In the end, what these territorial air remedy strategies might suggest is the role of architecture as an agent in producing environment where the human limit is slowly altered in the process of slowing down the consequences of a slow catastrophe. by Erioseto Hendranata.
