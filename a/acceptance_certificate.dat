Finally, we provide negative results showing that some of our positive claims are optimal with regard to being relativizable. Our negative results are proven using a novel observation: we show that the classical "wide spacing" oracle construction technique yields instant non-bi-immunity results. Furthermore, we establish a result that improves upon Baker, Gill, and Solovay's classical result that NP ≠ P = NP ∩ coNP holds in some relativized world. Comment: 26 page...|$|R

40|$|Valuation (appraisal) {{gives an}} {{unbiased}} opinion of value or other physical attributes of identified property. Value, {{on the other}} hand, is the monetary worth of property, goods or services. The Machinery and Technical Specialties (MTS) Committee of the American Society of Appraisers (ASA) established methods for valuation of property including machinery and equipment. These methods conform to the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP). Valuation of property and indeed machinery and equipment is necessary for various purposes including ownership change, partnerships, mergers and acquisitions. The Industrial Inspectorate Department (IID) of the Federal Ministry of Industry in conformity with the Institute of Appraisers and cost Engineers (IACE) of the Nigerian Society of Engineers (NSE) Internalized the valuation process in carrying out the mandate of determining the investment valuation of capital undertakings with the view to issuing <b>acceptance</b> <b>certificate</b> for capital allowance purposes and certificate of value for equity contribution. This paper sets out to streamline the various valuation methods {{as a way of}} complementing the existing valuation process.

40|$|Well known {{reasons for}} local {{failures}} in power transformers {{are caused by}} partial discharges (PD) in the electric insulation. Continuous deterioration over time increases the defect which finally {{can lead to a}} breakdown of the entire insulation. The importance of PD measurement is accommodated by standardized electrical measurement according to IEC 60270 [1] which is required for <b>acceptance</b> <b>certificates</b> at routine testing. Therefore, the apparent charge QIEC has become an important value for transformer quality. Since a couple of years, alternative measurement methods for PD are used. Originally developed for gas insulated systems [2], [3], ultra high frequency (UHF) measurement found its way into transformer diagnosis over the last years [4]. To become an accepted quality factor, UHF has to be proven a reliable testing method, which can bear up against electrical measurements. Therefore, the general physics of UHF PD has to be considered at first. Ultra-high-frequency antennas measure electromagnetic emissions of PD directly in-oil inside a transformer. It becomes apparent, that UHF measurement usually is advantageous concerning external disturbances. Compared to the electric measurement, the UHF method is robust against external signals [5], which makes it suitable for both, offsite measurement at routine testing under laboratory conditions with low ambient noise and onsite, e. g. after transportation and installation of transformers with usually high noise levels. These considerations make the UHF method interesting as supplement for transformer routine tests. Therefore, a sensor calibration or at least a validation of its sensitivity is required [6] comparable to the electrical measurement. To provide profound knowledge of the equipment, the antenna factor (AF) of the UHF sensor needs to be determined under inside-transformer conditions. This contribution shows the determination of the UHF sensor’s AF using a Gigahertz-Transversal-Electro-Magnetic Setup (GTEM cell). To meet inside-transformer conditions, an oil-filled GTEM cell is required for correct permittivity. Correction factors can then be introduced to minimize measurement errors and to establish better comparability of different UHF sensors. Hence, a standard test setup can be defined...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{advent of}} {{electronic}} commerce and personal communi-cations on the Internet heightens {{concerns over the}} lack of privacy and security. Network services providing {{a wide range of}} security related guar-antees are increasingly based on public key certificates. A fundamental problem inhibiting the wide <b>acceptance</b> of existing <b>certificate</b> distribution services is the lack of a scalable certificate revocation mechanism. We argue in this paper that the resource requirements of extant revocation mechanisms place significant burden on certificate servers and network re-sources. We propose a novel mechanism called windowed revocation that satisfies the security policies and requirements of existing mechanisms and, at the same time, reduces the burden on certificate servers and network resources. We include a proof of correctness of windowed revocation and analyze worst case performance scenarios. I...|$|R
40|$|Concentrating Photovoltaics (CPV) is an {{alternative}} to flat-plate module photovoltaic (PV) technology. The bankability of CPV projects {{is an important issue}} to pave the way toward a swift and sustained growth in this technology. The bankability of a PV plant is generally addressed through the modeling of its energy yield under a baseline loss scenario, followed by an on-site measurement campaign aimed at verifying its energy performance. This paper proposes a procedure for assessing the performance of a CPV project, articulated around four main successive steps: Solar Resource Assessment, Yield Assessment, <b>Certificate</b> of Provisional <b>Acceptance,</b> and <b>Certificate</b> of Final <b>Acceptance.</b> This methodology allows the long-term energy production of a CPV project to be estimated with an associated uncertainty of ≈ 5 %. To our knowledge, no such method has been proposed to the CPV industry yet, and this critical situation has hindered or made impossible the completion of several important CPV projects undertaken in the world. The main motive for this proposed method is to bring a practical solution to this urgent problem. This procedure can be operated under a wide range of climatic conditions, and makes it possible to assess the bankability of a CPV plant whose design uses any of the technologies currently available on the market. The method is also compliant with both international standards and local regulations. In consequence, its applicability is both general and international...|$|R

40|$|Using {{the lens}} of Clegg's {{circuits}} of power (CoP) framework, this study examines the resistance to a UK information security certification scheme through three episodes of power that led to its withdrawal in 2000. The UK authorities sought to generate market competition between a generic certificate scheme with lower costs and international recognition and one based on technical rigor, but they failed in their objectives because of resistance from organizational players. This paper makes contributions {{to the understanding of}} the discursive nature of resistance to change in the research of standards and certification, and contributes to the literature by formulating the concept of discourse resilience: the property of discourses to resist change. It identifies the non-agentic nature of resistance in the absence of coercive power and presents a reflection on legitimacy as a required attribute for the <b>acceptance</b> of a <b>certificate</b> scheme. The research finds that what organizations deem to be legitimate is the result of power...|$|R
40|$|The {{range of}} {{environmental}} problems in European skiing resorts caused by winter sports, agriculture and summer tourism are all well known. The issues and management challenges relate to sensitive ecological conditions, construction activities, deficiencies in visitor management and an land use conflicts during summer. One new approach to manage these problems is the EU-Eco-Audit. In test sites in Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Austria a successful adaptation of the EU-Eco-Audit framework to ski resorts has been developed. The implementation of the Audit framework at these test sites led to positive effects concerning visitor and ecological management. One influencing factor for the future development is the positive public image concerning environmental aspects. Crucial {{to the implementation of}} the Eco-Audit-framework is whether it will assist ski resorts in their competition with other destiantions for hosting international events. Finally the <b>acceptance</b> of the <b>certificates</b> or awards by skiers is discussed. It will be argued that due to the increasing relevance of information provision and marketing of wintersport destinations via the internet, the auditing or award concept contributes to a positive image of these enterprises and destinations in the market place. ...|$|R

The ceremony of admittance into the Confraternity includes the investiture with the Blue Scapular. Confraternity members ought to piously wear the Scapular always as an outward mark of veneration for the Immaculate Conception of the B.V.M. and a symbol that sets them apart as people particularly {{dedicated to the}} Blessed Virgin Mary. The rite of admission into the Confraternity of the Congragation of Marian Fathers takes place during a special liturgical ceremony, which may be presided over by a Marian priest or deacon, or by the priest or deacon delegated by the Marians. The faithful who live at a great distance from the church that hosts the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception, and thus are prevented from participation in the Confraternity’s meetings but who wish to belong, may be admitted into the Confraternity. The admission is performed through a written petition addressed to the local moderator of the Confraternity and then through <b>acceptance</b> of the <b>certificate</b> of membership. In this case, a priest or deacon (either religious order member or diocesan) may confer the Blue Scapular, upon prior obtaining of a sub-delegation issued by the Superior General of the Congregation of Marian Fathers.|$|R
