The history of the commission is replete with such recommendations which {{have been made in the}} wake of the hour and where the law has needed change. Further, the commission has been often returned to review its earlier reports in the wake of changed scenarios and the <b>aptness</b> of law in such situations. Euthanasia and related issues, in particular, has been one such area where the commission has been relook the situation at least three times, with the latest being its 196th report on the topic.|$|E
500|$|In 1805, the British Critic {{wrote that}} it was [...] "superfluous to expatiate much {{on the merits of}} a work" [...] that {{everyone}} liked because of [...] "the <b>aptness</b> of its descriptions, the accuracy of its figures, the spirit of its wood engravings, and the ingenious variety of its vignettes." ...|$|E
500|$|The middle eight {{sections}} {{present a}} softer harmonic content {{relative to the}} strident progression over the verses. The melody encompasses B minor, diminished and major 7 chords, together with A major. The inner voicings within this chord pattern produce a chromatic descent of notes through each semitone from F to C. Musicologist Walter Everett comments on the <b>aptness</b> of the conciliatory lyric [...] "Maybe you'd understand", which closes the second of these sections, as the melody concludes on a perfect authentic cadence, representing in musical terms [...] "a natural emblem for any coming together".|$|E
6000|$|... "Those fitnesses and <b>aptnesses</b> change, I think, {{from day}} to day. There {{was a time when}} a knight should be a {{fighting}} man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And the <b>aptnesses</b> and fitnesses in {{accordance}} with which the sovereign {{of the day was}} induced to grace with the Garter such a man as the late Marquis of Mount Fidgett have, I hope, gone by. You will admit that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And other fitnesses and <b>aptnesses</b> will go by, {{till the}} time {{will come when}} the man to be {{selected}} as Lieutenant of a county will be the man whose selection will be most beneficial to the county, and Knights of the Garter will be chosen for their real virtues." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{song was}} issued as the B-side of [...] "Lady Madonna" [...] on 15 March 1968 in the UK, with the US release {{following}} three days later. While Chris Welch of Melody Maker expressed {{doubts about the}} hit potential of the A-side, Billboard magazine's reviewer commented on the <b>aptness</b> of [...] "The Inner Light", given the band's concurrent [...] "meditation spell". In America, the B-side charted independently on the Billboard Hot 100 for one week, placing at number 96. In Australia, it was listed with [...] "Lady Madonna", as a double A-side, when the single topped the Go-Set national singles chart.|$|E
500|$|The 14 October date {{marked the}} final {{recording}} session for The Beatles. With Starr away in Sardinia, the overdubs consisted of another lead guitar part by Harrison, and organ, tambourine and bongos. While author Ian MacDonald lists Thomas as the organ {{player on the}} track, other writers credit Harrison. In {{his description of the}} finished recording, Jonathan Gould notes the <b>aptness</b> of Harrison's vocal delivery, where the list of chocolate flavours [...] "roll off George's tongue like a catalog of life's little pleasures", and the effectiveness of his guitar solo, which, further to the lyric's warnings regarding tooth decay, is [...] "pitched to the register of a dentist's drill".|$|E
500|$|Molina {{was also}} noted for his {{handling}} of the pitching staff. [...] The Cardinals overcame losing key pitchers Chris Carpenter, Jason Motte, and Jaime García – among others – early in the season by substituting twelve rookie pitchers en route to winning a competitive NL Central division title over the Pittsburgh Pirates and Cincinnati Reds (each team finished with at least 90 wins). [...] A continuously evolving core exceeded expectations by filling in for 52 games started, 36 wins, and five saves and Molina was credited with their success in a large part due to his pitch-calling skills and <b>aptness</b> to guide. [...] The rookies' 36 wins were the most in franchise history since 1941.|$|E
6000|$|There {{are many}} casual brilliancies {{in the way}} of analogy and parallel, many <b>aptnesses</b> of thought and phrase. The Stoics are called the Jansenists of Paganism. [...] "For a single blade of grass to grow, it is {{necessary}} that the whole of nature should co-operate." [...] "A man comes to Pyrrhonism by one of two opposite ways; either because he does not know enough, or because he knows too much; the latter is not the most common way." [...] And so forth.|$|R
500|$|In his AllMusic {{article on}} the song, Lindsay Planer views it as [...] "somewhat of a sacred rocker" [...] with [...] "ample lead guitar", and {{comments}} that Harrison's lyrics [...] "cleverly [...] upon an array of disparate imagery to convey a conversely simple spiritual revelation". Harrison biographer Alan Clayson considers the track [...] "more uplifting" [...] than [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] and remarks on the <b>aptness</b> of Harrison's subject matter in 1970–71, when religious texts such as the Bible, the Koran and ISKCON's Chant and Be Happy [...] "now had discreet places on hip bookshelves". Former Mojo editor Mat Snow describes the song as [...] "glorious white gospel", in which Harrison [...] "rejects the Catholicism of his Liverpool upbringing".|$|E
500|$|Writing in Rolling Stone, Ben Gershon {{remarked on}} the <b>aptness</b> of Starr's {{role as the}} {{catalyst}} for a conciliatory musical statement from the ex-Beatles. He highlighted [...] "I'm the Greatest" [...] {{as one of the}} album's three [...] "most wonderful songs" [...] and the track on which [...] "a stunning alchemy occurs" [...] due to the presence of Harrison and Lennon. Although less impressed with Ringo, Alan Betrock of Phonograph Record wrote that the song heralded Lennon's comeback as a writer, saying that after his recent overtly political work, [...] "the gum chewing proverbial tongue-in-cheek rocker has returned with more of the old genius – and Ringo handles the song quite well." [...] In his review for the NME, Charles Shaar Murray found that Lennon's composition [...] "verges uncomfortably on self parody" [...] with Starr left as [...] "the butt of the joke". Amid his criticism of the lyrics, Shaar Murray said that the return of Billy Shears [...] "complete with canned applause" [...] suggested an attempt to [...] "plug the musical holes in the album with large handfuls of charm and nostalgia".|$|E
500|$|In 1941 the Concise Cambridge History of English Literature {{opined that}} Wodehouse had [...] "a gift for highly {{original}} <b>aptness</b> of phrase that almost suggests a poet struggling for release among the wild extravagances of farce", while McCrum thinks that Wodehouse manages to combine [...] "high farce with the inverted poetry of his mature comic style", particularly in The Code of the Woosters; the novelist Anthony Powell believes Wodehouse to be a [...] "comic poet". Robert A. Hall, Jr., {{in his study}} of Wodehouse's style and technique, describes the author as a master of prose, an opinion also shared by Levin, who considers Wodehouse [...] "one of the finest and purest writers of English prose". Hall identifies several techniques used by Wodehouse to achieve comic effect, including the creation of new words through adding or removing prefixes and suffixes, so when Pongo Twistleton removes the housemaid Elsie Bean from a cupboard, Wodehouse writes that the character [...] "de-Beaned the cupboard". Wodehouse created new words by splitting others in two, thus Wodehouse divides [...] "hobnobbing" [...] when he writes: [...] "To offer a housemaid a cigarette is not hobbing. Nor, when you light it for her, does that constitute nobbing." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Simonides has {{a simple}} style, {{but he can}} be commended for the <b>aptness</b> of his {{language}} and for a certain charm; his chief merit, however, lies in the power to excite pity, {{so much so that}} some prefer him in this respect to all other writers of the genre." ...|$|E
2500|$|Italian {{journalist}} Tiziano Terzani and Ryszard Kapuściński {{shared a}} similar vision of journalism. [...] Jaime Abello Banfi, the friend and associate of Gabriel GarcíaMárquez, reports that GarcíaMárquez and Kapuściński, unbeknownst to each other, shared {{the opinion that}} the way to good journalism led through poetry (on account {{of the fact that it}} inculcates both the conciseness of expression and its <b>aptness).</b>|$|E
2500|$|No {{fossils of}} the woolly mammoth {{have ever been}} found in Mammoth Cave, {{and the name of}} the cave has nothing to do with this extinct mammal. Rather, the name [...] "Mammoth" [...] refers to the large width and length of the {{passages}} connecting to the Rotunda just inside the entrance. [...] This name was given long before the cave system's true extent was fully known. Modern discoveries have proven the <b>aptness</b> of the name.|$|E
2500|$|Kim began skating {{at the age}} of 6. Her {{coach at}} the time, Ryu Jong-hyun, {{strongly}} suggested to Kim's mother that Kim should continue to skate, predicting that she would become a world-class figure skater in the future. In a 2011 interview, she gave credit to her coaches for noticing her <b>aptness</b> for skating, stating, [...] "My coaches have told me my muscles and body structure are perfect for skating. I was born with a good instrument, maybe more so than the talent. I was lucky my coaches noticed early on and helped me develop that. A lot of people don't know they are born that way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Blue Blood is {{generally}} positively received. Alexey Eremenko, of Allmusic, said [...] "staying on the coordinate grid set by Iron Maiden, Guns N' Roses, Queensrÿche and perhaps updated Thin Lizzy, {{with the results}} being {{not too far from}} what Helloween were doing at the time", also argues that [...] "whether or not the Germans influenced X Japan is up for debate, but the similarities are obvious, as the Japanese exhibit the same <b>aptness</b> for combining menacing guitar work with anthemic... cinematic... melodies". Eremenko, who gave the album a three and a half out of five stars rating, concluded that the album [...] "generally packs enough skill and enthusiasm to deliver the goods on par with its best genre associates, even if clearly following in their footsteps." ...|$|E
2500|$|Casualty@Holby City episodes have {{received}} mixed reviews from critics. The 2004 Christmas crossover {{was named the}} season's [...] "Best Christmas Drama" [...] by The Sun, while Terry Ramsey of the Evening Standard selected the first episode as a televisual [...] "Pick of the Day". The inaugural crossover was {{named one of the}} [...] "Best TV shows for Christmas & New Year" [...] in The Mirror, receiving generally favourable reviews by Mirror writers Jane Simon and Jim Shelley—despite the former lambasting the realism of the plot: [...] "The building collapses, there's a little girl upstairs about to have a heart transplant, the tanker's leaking fuel and there's a velociraptor loose in radiology. Sorry, I made that last one up."—and the latter commenting that [...] "Casualty@Holby City was deeply weird, like watching Casualty on acid." [...] Similarly, Daniel Davies of The Western Mail also selected the episodes as dramatic highlights of the Christmas season, despite going on to discuss the <b>aptness</b> of the BBC's press release describing the two episodes as [...] "thrown together." ...|$|E
2500|$|Beautiful Vision {{received}} acclaim {{from contemporary}} critics. In a review for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau deemed it a musically cohesive album whose songs nonetheless all sound distinct, especially [...] "Cleaning Windows", {{which he said}} ranks among Morrison's greatest songs: [...] "This music is purely gorgeous (or at times lovely), its pleasure all formal grace and <b>aptness</b> of invention." [...] Chip Stern from High Fidelity believed even the inferior songs are a pleasure to listen to because of Morrison's maturation into a more relaxed and disciplined singer, while his band is eclectic yet subtle enough to incorporate a number of styles without sounding ostentatious: [...] "On tunes like 'Dweller on the Threshold', an r groove will suddenly support Celtic, Oriental, or Northern European folk references." [...] Rolling Stone magazine's John Milward was less enthusiastic and lamented four of the songs {{because of what he}} felt were unimaginative lyrics, instances [...] "when he lets his brain trivialize his heart" [...] on an album that is otherwise superior to the temporal, superficial nature of most popular music, [...] "a cogent statement of belief that finds Morrison touching his dangerously dogmatic themes with the grace of God".|$|E

60|$|In 1786, when in his twenty-fifth year, he {{obtained}} a little Baptist chapel and the goodwill {{of a school}} at Moulton; but as a minister he only received 16l. per annum, {{and at the same}} time proved, as many have done before him, that <b>aptness</b> to learn does not imply <b>aptness</b> to teach. He could not keep order, and his boys first played tricks with him and then deserted, till he came nearly to starvation, and had to return to his last and his leather.|$|E
