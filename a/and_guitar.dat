5|$|Guitar Solos {{was voted}} {{one of the}} best albums of 1974 by NME critics. AllMusic called it a {{landmark}} album because of its innovative and experimental approach to guitar playing.

5|$|Machine Head {{increased}} {{the complexity and}} technicality in their sound for the next album, The Blackening, which partially changes {{the sound of their}} first 5 albums in favor of a more classic heavy metal and thrash metal oriented sound, with fully complex song structures <b>and</b> <b>guitar</b> riffs.
