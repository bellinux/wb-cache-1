40|$|Abstract—Air–fuel {{ratio control}} is a {{challenging}} control problem for port-fuel-injected and throttle-body-fuel-injected spark igni-tion (SI) engines, since the dynamics of <b>air</b> <b>manifold</b> and fuel injec-tion of the SI engines are highly nonlinear and often with unmod-eled uncertainties and disturbance. This paper presents nonlinear control approaches for multi-input multi-output engine models, by developing adaptive control and learning control design meth-ods. Theoretical proofs are established that ensure that proposed controllers are able to give asymptotical tracking performance. As a comparison, the method applying global linearizing controller can give accurate tracking for the engine model without uncer-tainty and disturbance, but it fails to keep tracking performance when uncertainty is incorporated into the system. Adaptive control and learning control approaches are capable of dealing with both constant uncertainty and time-varying periodic uncertainty.

When the pH dropped below the set point, the flue gas control valve would close and another control valve would open, allowing air in the head space to be recirculated, preventing CO 2 in the head space from venting from the system. The third control valve {{was used as a}} relief valve to prevent the feed tank from becoming pressurized as flue gas was added to the system. In this manner, as CO 2 was consumed by the algae, additional CO 2 was automatically fed into the system as needed to maintain the desired operating pH.|$|E

Using square cells with internal manifolds, 0. 5 W/cm 2 stack power density (800 °C) can be obtained on short stacks. However, this open design configuration limits the assembly of large stacks and the durability of operation, owing to postcombustion and redox cycling occurring at unprotected cell edges.

Thorough investigations including stack and stack dummy tests, and finite element modeling (FEM) were performed to get a comprehensive understanding of the various parameters, influencing the leak tightness of the sealing material. It was found that even small temperature differences especially in the area of gas and <b>air</b> <b>manifolds</b> can create excessively high tensile stresses.

The upgraded turbochargers scavenge the exhaust gases from the cylinder, and create the <b>air</b> <b>manifold</b> pressure and back pressure on the engine necessary to achieve a specific trapped mass. This combination serves to achieve the emissions reduction required by regulatory agencies. Many engine owner/operators request that an upgraded turbocharger be tested and verified prior to re-installation on engine.

Confirming the as-built turbocharger design specification prior to transporting to the field can decrease downtime and installation costs.

Green house gases emission from industrial activities has been proven beyond doubt as {{the main cause of}} global warming and climate changes. The finite world energy supply that consists nearly 90 % of fossil fuel which is depleted; an energy crisis because of widening fossil fuel production and demand gaps. Many nations responded to anticipate energy crisis by diversifying their fuel resources to include renewable and alternative energy and developing green energy technology for the future. Despite political announcements on renewable energy, fossil fuels will continue to dominate energy resources {{for some time to come}} and carbon emission will increase but global nuclear energy expansion is uncertain because of international tensions and general public fears of another Chernobyl or Fogoshima disasters or a nuclear terrorist attack. Biofuels are plagued by the conflict between crops for fuel and crops for food and there is a shift of interest towards crop biomass wastes. The further expansion of hydrogen energy is constrained by costs and safety in hydrogen transport and storage. Fuel cell research and development has shifted from older AFC, PAFC and MCFC whose entry into the market were stalled by intractable operational and durability problems, to more promising PEMFC, DMFC and SOFC. A new type of fuel cell, the microbial fuel cell (MFC) is also gaining some attention because of sustainable way of simultaneously reducing BOD and COD of wastewater and provide power; combined wastewater treatment and power (CWTP). The main thrust in PEMFC research and development is cost reduction of membrane and electrocatalyst by substitution of cheap and more efficient organic-inorganic nanocomposite membranes and nanoinorganic electrocatalyst as well as lower electrocatalyst loading and cost reduction of bipolar plate by material reformulation with nanomaterials for injection or compression molding. In addition, cost reduction can also be achieved by reduction of system complexity using non-hydrated or self-hydrated membranes that eliminate water management sub-system and CO tolerant anodes that eliminate CO removal of reformate hydrogen feed. PEMFC system efficiency can be further enhanced by better design of flow field in bipolar plates and fuel and <b>air</b> <b>manifold</b> in the stack as well as through process optimization using process system engineering tools. The main thrust of SOFC research and development is reduction of its operational temperature by replacement with low temperature electrolytes, anodes and cathodes.

It is known that the distribution of particles fed to the sorter will affect both of these. When different particles are in close proximity, they can be ‘‘agglomerated’’ or seen as a single particle during identification and also have an increased probability of being unintentionally co-ejected. Both factors will {{have a negative effect on}} separation efficiency. The aim of this work was to model the <b>air</b> ejection <b>manifold</b> of a sensor-based automated sorter and to investigate the relationship between particle proximity and unintentional co-ejections. The airflow from a single air ejection valve of a sorter was modelled using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software and calibrated against a Tomra Sorting Solutions optical sorter.

Particles were modelled using the discrete element method (DEM) software and the effect of particle position, relative to an air ejection valve, on accurate ejection was examined using an integrated CFD–DEM model.
