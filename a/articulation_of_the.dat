5|$|The {{influential}} eighteenth-century Reformed theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher saw {{problems with}} all of the Reformation positions on Christ's presence in the Eucharist, and hoped that a new <b>articulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> doctrine would be made.

5|$|Other {{aspects of}} feeding include the eyes, arms, and legs. The {{shape of the}} skull of Allosaurus limited {{potential}} binocular vision to 20° of width, slightly {{less than that of}} modern crocodilians. As with crocodilians, this may have been enough to judge prey distance and time attacks. The arms, compared with those of other theropods, were suited for both grasping prey at a distance or clutching it close, and the <b>articulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> claws suggests that they could have been used to hook things. Finally, the top speed of Allosaurus has been estimated at 30 to 55kilometers per hour (19 to 34miles per hour).|$|E

5|$|The {{axillary}} {{region is}} region containing the axillary sclerites has {{in general the}} form of a scalene triangle. The base of the triangle (a-b) is the hinge of the wing with the body; the apex (c) is the distal end of the third axillary sclerite; the longer side is anterior to the apex. The point d on the anterior side of the triangle marks the <b>articulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> radial vein with the second axillary sclerite. The line between d and c is the plica basalis (bf), or fold of the wing {{at the base of the}} mediocubital field.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, Cau et al. reconsidered {{the ecology}} of Balaur again in their reevaluation of its phylogenetic position, arguing that if Balaur was an avialan, it would be phylogenetically {{bracketed}} by taxa {{known to have been}} herbivorous, such as Sapeornis and Jeholornis. This suggests a non-hypercarnivorous lifestyle to be a more parsimonious conclusion and supports Cau's initial interpretations of its specializations. This is also indicated by the reduced third finger, the lack of a gynglymoid lower <b>articulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second metatarsal and the rather small and moderately recurved second toe claw. Balaur had a broad pelvis, a broad foot, a large first toe, and broad lower ends of the metatarsals relative to the articulation surfaces; such a combination can in the remainder of the Theropoda only be found with the herbivorous Therizinosauridae.|$|E
5|$|In their {{original}} description, Charig and Milner found Baryonyx unique {{enough to warrant}} a new family of theropod dinosaurs: Baryonychidae. They found Baryonyx to be unlike any other theropod group (and considered {{the possibility that it}} was a thecodont, due to apparently primitive features), but noted that the <b>articulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> maxilla and premaxilla was similar to that in Dilophosaurus. They also noted that two fragmentary snouts from Niger, assigned to the family Spinosauridae by French palaeontologist Philippe Taquet in 1984, appeared almost identical to those of Baryonyx and they referred them to Baryonychidae instead. In 1988, American palaeontologist Gregory S. Paul agreed with Taquet that Spinosaurus, described in 1915 based on fragmentary remains from Egypt which were destroyed in World War II, and Baryonyx were similar and (due to their kinked snouts) possibly late-surviving dilophosaurs. French palaeontologist Eric Buffetaut also supported this relationship in 1989. In 1990 Charig and Milner dismissed the spinosaurid affinities of Baryonyx, since they did not find their remains similar enough.|$|E

5|$|The jurist Richard Posner saw Tripp as {{reviving}} psychiatrist Richard von Krafft-Ebing's {{theory that}} masturbation helps to cause homosexuality by fixating a {{boy on the}} male genitals, based on evidence that homosexuals begin masturbating earlier than heterosexuals. Posner criticized the theory {{on the grounds that}} homosexuality and early masturbation could both be effects of whatever factor might be responsible for causing homosexuality. The geneticist Dean Hamer wrote that The Homosexual Matrix was influential and that Tripp provided the clearest <b>articulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> social learning theory of sexual orientation. However, Hamer found the theory itself implausible, and rejected it on numerous grounds, arguing that it is inconsistent with anthropological evidence and human evolutionary history, and fails to explain the existence of homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|Up {{to three}} {{thoracic}} segments may be fused {{with the head}} to form a cephalothorax; the associated appendages turn forward and are modified as maxillipeds (accessory mouthparts). A carapace may be absent, present or secondarily lost, and may cover the head, part {{or all of the}} thorax and some of the abdomen. It is variable in form and may be fused dorsally with some of the thoracic segments or occasionally be in two parts, hinged dorsally. Typically, each of the thoracic appendages is biramous and the endopods are the better developed of the branches, being used for crawling or grasping. Each endopod consist of seven articulating segments; the coxa, basis, ischium, merus, carpus, propodus and dactylus. In decapods, the claw is formed by the <b>articulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dactylus against an outgrowth of the propodus. In some taxa, the exopods are lost and the appendages are uniramous.|$|E
5|$|A bone {{unique to}} pterosaurs, {{known as the}} pteroid, {{connected}} to the wrist and helped to support a forward membrane (the propatagium) between the wrist and shoulder. Evidence of webbing between the three free fingers of the pterosaur forelimb suggests that this forward membrane {{may have been more}} extensive than the simple pteroid-to-shoulder connection traditionally depicted in life restorations. The position of the pteroid bone itself has been controversial. Some scientists, notably Matthew Wilkinson, have argued that the pteroid pointed forward, extending the forward membrane. This view was contradicted in a 2007 paper by Chris Bennett, who showed that the pteroid did not articulate as previously thought and could not have pointed forward, but rather inward toward the body as traditionally thought. Peters (2009) proposed that the pteroid articulated with the ‘saddle' of the radiale (proximal syncarpal) and both the pteroid and preaxial carpal were migrated centralia. This view of the <b>articulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pteroid has since been supported by specimens of Changchengopterus pani and Darwinopterus linglongtaensis, both of which show the pteroid in articulation with the proximal syncarpal.|$|E

5|$|As {{with the}} premaxilla, the predentary of Eolambia bore denticles. There is a {{prominent}} dorsomedial process, a tab-like structure also seen in Probactrosaurus and other hadrosauriforms. Several additional tab-like denticles were present {{on either side}} of the dorsomedial process, which are likewise present in Probactrosaurus. The predentary is joined at the back by the dentary, which constitutes most of the lower jaw. There is a short recess, or diastema, between the <b>articulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> predentary with the dentary and the first tooth position on the dentary, which is observed in Equijubus, Probactrosaurus, and other hadrosauroids. The front of the dentary characteristically deepens, as in Protohadros, Ouranosaurus, and Bactrosaurus. Two bulges are present on the outer surface of the dentary, one of them representing the coronoid process as in Probactrosaurus and other hadrosauroids. Like Protohadros and several other hadrosauriforms but unlike Probactrosaurus, only the front end of this process is thickened. As in Equijubus, Probactrosaurus, and various other iguanodonts, a small foramen (or opening) is present on the side of the surangular, which is located behind the dentary.|$|E
5|$|Though the Republican {{legislative}} candidates {{won more}} popular votes, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature re-elected Douglas to the Senate. Despite {{the bitterness of}} the defeat for Lincoln, his <b>articulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> issues gave him a national political reputation. In May 1859, Lincoln purchased the Illinois Staats-Anzeiger, a German-language newspaper which was consistently supportive; most of the state's 130,000 German Americans voted Democratic but there was Republican support that a German-language paper could mobilize. In {{the aftermath of the}} 1858 election, newspapers frequently mentioned Lincoln as a potential Republican presidential candidate in 1860, with William H. Seward, Salmon P. Chase, Edward Bates, and Simon Cameron looming as rivals for the nomination. While Lincoln was popular in the Midwest, he lacked support in the Northeast, and was unsure as to whether he should seek the presidency. In January 1860, Lincoln told a group of political allies that he would accept the 1860 presidential nomination if offered, and in the following months several local papers endorsed Lincoln for president.|$|E
