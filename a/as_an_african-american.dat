In the book Music Video and the Politics of Representation, Diane Railton and Paul Watson felt that the video exemplified cultural appropriation, specifically noting how Aguilera conducted herself <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>African-American</b> woman, and elaborated that it emphasized [...] "a range of issues concerning the representation of gender and race". Andy Cohn from The Fader provided a more favorable review, and opined that Aguilera's [...] "sass" [...] helped to highlight her Irish and Ecuadorian background.|$|E

500|$|Angelou {{comes to}} terms with her {{difficult}} past, both as a descendant of Africans taken forcibly to America as slaves and <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>African-American</b> who has experienced racism. As she tells interviewer Connie Martinson, she brought her son to Ghana {{to protect him from}} the negative effects of racism because she did not think he had the tools to withstand them. [...] She remains in Accra after his accident because it was traumatic for her as well—so traumatic it reduces her to silence, similar to her muteness after she was raped as a child in Caged Bird. [...] Her friend Julian Mayfield introduces her to Efua Sutherland, who becomes Angelou's [...] "Sister friend" [...] and allows her to cry out her pain, grief, and fear, something Angelou later admitted went against her American upbringing of emotional restraint.|$|E

He originally auditioned for the role of deputy mayor and, as he was not cast, Parisot invited him to read for Disher. Gray-Stanford agreed as he became excited to try for the role of Levine's sidekick. The pilot, originally developed as a TV film, was written by Breckman and filmed in the fall of 2001 in Vancouver. Originally shot in 35 mm film, it was changed to Super 16mm for budget reasons when USA acquired it.|$|E
500|$|... "Everybody" [...] {{starts with}} a heavily {{synthesized}} and spoken introduction with Madonna taking a loud intake of breath. Madonna displayed her bubblegum pop voice in the song, which was doubletracked. The song is written in the key of A minor with the melody of the song beginning in G and rising to the second scale degree on the syllable 'bo' of 'everybody', thus highlighting the chorus which follows in the chord progression of G–A–B–A. [...] "Everybody" [...] incorporated R infused beats. Sire Records marketed the soulful nature of the dance song for the black audience and Madonna was promoted <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>African-American</b> artist, thereby fitting the record into a radio playlist where the song might chart. In New York, the song was played on 92 KTU which had an African-American audience. For {{the cover of the}} single, Sire Records portrayed a hip-hop collage of downtown New York, rather than a portrait shot of Madonna, further perpetuating the notion that Madonna was African-American.|$|E

500|$|Despite these trials, James neither renounced {{her faith}} nor gave up hope {{that one day}} she would have the blessings she desired. Throughout the 1870s and 1880s, she {{struggled}} {{to care for the}} remaining children at home as a single parent. In 1872, she sold the family farm and moved closer to the city in order to save money. During these years James both managed a household of children and small grandchildren, but also worked as a domestic servant in order to make ends meet. In addition, she made the family's soap, clothing, and raised vegetables in a small garden. James remained active in the church at this time as well. She participated in the Relief Society doing extensive charitable work. She also contributed financially to the building of the Logan, Manti, and St. George temples; temples that, <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>African-American,</b> she was not allowed to enter. The members of her congregation, however, did recognize her faith and sacrifice. In her later life, both she and her brother Isaac J. Manning received reserved seats near the front and center of the Utah Tabernacle for church services. James remained a strong supporter of Joseph Smith, calling him [...] "the finest man I ever saw on earth." ...|$|E

Students at Duke University, and with Yale University's Asian American Cultural Center and the South Asian Society, created videos and ran photo campaigns denouncing the social media attacks, while Miss Kansas Theresa Vail blogged and gave interviews to discredit the comments about both herself and Davuluri. Actor and civil-rights activist George Takei (the original Hikaru Sulu in [...] ) posted a comment on Facebook stating that while he normally doesn't [...] "care about Miss America … the uproar over an Indian-American winning (whom many decried for being 'Arab') has me shaking my head.

All cause for celebration." [...] Finally, Immediate Past President, Young Democrats of America, Atima Omara, argued that [...] "a sexist, racist, xenophobic attack against one prominent woman of color is an attack against us all, and it shouldn't be tolerated just because we disdain that woman's choices. <b>As</b> <b>an</b> <b>African-American</b> woman with an ethnic name, I know the constant sting that comes from hearing how you are not American enough {{no matter how much you}} accomplish in the name of America." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hurston's works {{touched on}} the African-American {{experience}} and her struggles <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>African-American</b> woman. Her novels went relatively unrecognized by the literary world for decades, but interest revived after author Alice Walker published [...] "In Search of Zora Neale Hurston" [...] in the March 1975 issue of Ms. Magazine.

2500|$|Butler {{began reading}} science fiction {{at a young}} age, but quickly became disenchanted by the genre's unimaginative {{portrayal}} of ethnicity and class {{as well as by}} its lack of noteworthy female protagonists.

[...] Butler's stories, therefore, are usually written {{from the perspective of a}} marginalized black woman whose difference from the dominant agents increases her potential for reconfiguring the future of her society.|$|E

2500|$|The {{concept of}} {{following}} {{the story of}} a central character, Redford Stevens, on the album was the idea of band manager Richard Nichols. According to Questlove, the album's protagonist Redford is [...] "the prototypical urban kid — young, gifted, black, and unraveling before our eyes," [...] and is based on [...] "a combination of maybe four to five people that we know in Philadelphia." [...] Regarding the character, Black Thought said, [...] "Redford's story isn't uncommon in Philadelphia ... I remember not being able to imagine being alive as a 30-year-old. I didn't know many people who had lived to 30." [...] Inspiration for Redford was also culled from the Sufjan Stevens song [...] "Redford (For Yia-Yia & Pappou)" [...] from his album Michigan and the character Avon Barksdale from TV series The Wire. Some sources have interpreted Redford <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>African-American</b> everyman, though others have cautioned against this view, emphasizing his individual characteristics. For instance, Hilary Brown of Down Beat called Redford [...] "a romantic, not a thug; a philosopher, not an everyman," [...] and Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah wrote [...] "The mistake is to read Redford as being like anyone who has their back to the wall, or to see the album’s narrative as a universal story." ...|$|E
