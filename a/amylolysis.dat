50|$|The {{amylolytic}} {{process is}} used in the brewing of alcohol from grains. Since grains contain starches but little to no simple sugars, the sugar needed to produce alcohol is derived from starch via the amylolytic process. In beer brewing, this is done through malting. In sake brewing, the mold Aspergillus oryzae provides <b>amylolysis,</b> and in Tapai, Saccharomyces cerevisiae.|$|E
50|$|Liquid brem is {{made from}} {{fermented}} mash of black/ white glutinous rice (known as Ketan) using a dry-starter called Ragi tape. Glutinous rice is soaked and drained, steamed for 1 hour, and then cooled down. The cooled rice is then inoculated with Ragi tape and <b>amylolysis</b> begins. A honey-like rice syrup settles {{in the bottom of}} the malting vessel. Following 3 days of conversion from rice starch to sugar, a yeast culture is added and alcoholic fermentation begins. Alcoholic fermentation typically goes on for two weeks.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{influence}} of protein and/or fibre enrichment on the nutritional properties of biscuits was studied {{in terms of}} proteolysis and <b>amylolysis.</b> Biscuits were digested using a multi-compartmental and dynamic system that simulates the main physiological digestive functions of the upper tract of healthy adult humans: the TIM- 1. A control biscuit and three biscuits enriched in proteins and/or fibres were digested under the same conditions. Samples were collected in each compartment of the TIM- 1 (stomach, duodenum, jejunum and ileum) {{at different times of}} digestion and analysed in terms of proteolysis and <b>amylolysis.</b> Results indicate that both formulation and processing impacted the digestive fate of the biscuits. Incorporating proteins or fibres in biscuits lowered or delayed proteolysis. Moreover a protein-plus-fibre additional or synergic effect was observed. Biscuits enriched in proteins and/or fibres displayed a higher <b>amylolysis</b> degree than the control biscuit, probably due to lower starch amounts and higher gelatinization degrees...|$|E
40|$|The furosine {{content of}} infant cereals {{has been used}} to {{evaluate}} the thermal damage caused to those foods during their manufacture (toasting, <b>amylolysis</b> and drying steps). The mean furosine contents of raw and toasted flours were 13 · 7 and 13 · 8 mg/ 100 g of protein, respectively. The furosine content increased to 47 · 3 mg/ 100 g of protein after hydrolysis using alpha-amylase. The <b>amylolysis</b> process raised the reducing sugar content from 0 · 5 % for raw samples to 12 · 7 %. The furosine content of infant cereals rose to average levels of 500 mg/ 100 g of protein after roller-drying. The infant cereals with the highest levels of reducing sugars, with or without soy flour, exhibited the highest furosine contents.

40|$|The {{underlying}} {{mechanism of}} <b>amylolysis</b> of rice starch granules was investigated using isolated starch granules from wild-type, {{as well as}} SBEllb mutant and down-regulated lines. Fused granule agglomerates isolated from mutant and transgenic lines were hydrolysed at similar rates by amylases, and had similar crystalline patterns and thermal properties as individual granules. Surface pores, a feature previously only reported for A-polymorphic starch granules, were also observed in B- and C-polymorphic rice starch granules. Although the microscopic patterns of hydrolysis among granules with different crystalline polymorphs were qualitatively similar, the extent {{and the rate of}} <b>amylolysis</b> were different, suggesting that B-type crystalline polymorphs are intrinsically more resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis than A-type in rice starch granules. It is proposed that the slightly longer branch lengths of amylopectin which leads to the formation of more stable B-type double helical structures compared to their A-type counterparts is the major parameter, with other factors such as granule size, surface pores and interior channels having secondary roles, in determining the rate of enzymatic hydrolysis of rice starch granules.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} the antidiabetic potential of Butea monosperma Lam. Kuntze (Fabaceae) leaves and the stem bark using various in vitro techniques. The samples were studied for {{their effects on}} glucose adsorption, diffusion, <b>amylolysis</b> kinetics, enteric enzymes and glucose transport across yeast cells. Both the samples adsorbed glucose and the adsorption of glucose increased with increase in glucose concentration. The samples also inhibited movement of glucose across the dialysis membrane to varying degree in both glucose diffusion and <b>amylolysis</b> kinetic experiment models. B. monosperma leaves inhibited α-amylase, α-glucosidase and sucrase enzymes in succession to varying degrees, whereas the bark inhibited only α-amylase to a significant extent and slightly activated α-glucosidase and sucrase enzymes. The extracts of both leaves and bark promoted glucose uptake by yeast cells compared to control. Enhancement of glucose uptake was dependent on both the sample and glucose concentration. It was directly proportional to the sample concentration and inversely proportional to the molar concentration of the glucose. From {{the results of the}} study, it is inferred that, B. monosperma leaves and bark possesses antidiabetic activity.

Results: It was observed that both the plant extracts adsorbed glucose and the adsorption of glucose increased remarkably {{with an increase in}} glucose concentration. No significant (p ⩽  0. 05) differences were observed between the adsorption capacities of B. aristata and T. indica. The results of <b>amylolysis</b> kinetic experimental model exhibited that the rate of glucose diffusion was increased with time from 30 to 180  min and both the plant extracts demonstrated significant inhibitory effects on movement of glucose into external solution across dialysis membrane as compared to control. It was observed that the plant extracts also promoted glucose uptake by the yeast cells. Enhancement of glucose uptake was dependent on both the sample and glucose concentration. B. aristata extract exhibited significantly higher (p ⩽  0. 05) activity than the extract of T. indica at all concentrations.

40|$|Studies on porous starch {{have been}} {{directed}} to explore different industrial applications as bio-adsorbents {{of a variety}} of compounds. However, the analysis of starch digestibility is essential for food application. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the impact of porous structure on in vitro starch digestibility. Porous starches were obtained using a range of concentrations of amyloglucosidase (AMG), α-amylase (AM), cyclodextrin-glycosyltransferase (CGTase) or branching enzyme (BE). Porous starches exhibited major content of digestible starch (DS) that increased with the intensity of the enzymatic treatment, and very low amount of resistant starch (RS). Porous starches behaved differently during in vitro hydrolysis depending on their enzymatic treatment. AMG was the unique treatment that increased the digestive <b>amylolysis</b> and estimated glycemic index, whereas AM, CGTase and BE reduced them. A significant relationship was found between the pore size and the severity of the <b>amylolysis,</b> suggesting that a specific pore size is required for the accessibility of the digestive amylase. Therefore, pore size in the starch surface was a limiting factor for digestion of starch granules.

In the present study, composite flours were formulated using psyllium, barley and oat at two different levels [WPOB-I = wheat flour (75 %), psyllium (5 %), oat (10 %) and barley (10 %), WPOB-II = wheat flour (60 %), psyllium (10 %), oat (15 %) and barley (15 %) ]. Chapaties were prepared from all formulations and various starch fractions were analyzed using controlled enzymatic digestion. The digestibility characteristics were studied using <b>amylolysis</b> kinetics employing porcine pancreatic α-amylase in vitro. Results showed that both the variations (WPOB-I & WPOB-II) had acceptable sensory qualities and had significantly lower (p[*]≤[*] 0. 05) values for total starch (TS), rapidly digestible starch (RDS), resistant starch (RS), starch digestibility index (SDI) and rapidly available glucose (RAG) compared to control. Between the two variations, WPOB-I showed better starch digestibility characteristics with significantly lower (p[*]≤[*] 0. 05) starch digestibility index (SDI). In case of <b>amylolysis</b> kinetics, both the variations significantly (p[*]≤[*] 0. 05) inhibited α-amylase as reflected by lower glucose diffusion and significantly higher (p[*]≤[*] 0. 05) glucose dialysis retardation index (GDRI) compared to control.

40|$|Large-bowel {{fermentation}} of resistant starch produces SCFA {{that are}} believed to be important in maintaining visceral function. High-amylose maize starch (HAMS) and acylated starches are sources of resistant starch and are an effective means of increasing colonic SCFA. Cooking increases digestibility of starches but its effects on the capacity of these starches to raise large-bowel SCFA are unknown. We have examined the effects of cooking of HAMS and butyrylated HAMS (HAMSB) on <b>amylolysis</b> in vitro and their capacity to raise caeco-colonic SCFA in rats. The starches were boiled in excess water and microwaved, followed by drying at 100 °C. Cooking increased in vitro glucose release for both starches but significantly less from HAMSB. Rat growth rates were unaffected when fed cooked resistant starch. Digesta pH was increased in the caecum and proximal colon of rats fed cooked HAMS. Distal colonic pH was highest in rats fed cooked HAMSB. Factorial analyses (2 × 2) of caecal SCFA pools showed significant differences between HAMS and HAMSB, and that cooking significantly lowered caecal butyrate pools. Portal venous butyrate concentrations were higher in both HAMSB groups than those fed HAMS. The data suggest that HAMSB is less susceptible to in vitro <b>amylolysis</b> than HAMS following cooking and delivers more butyrate to rat caecum than HAMS. This attribute may be useful in food applications for specific delivery of SCFA to the colon.

Arsenate (10 mm) inhibited phosphate incorporation into glucose monophosphates up to 46 % and phosphoglucomutase activity 96 %, resulting in glucose 1 -phosphate accumulation as a product of amylopectin degradation. The intracellular distribution of enzymes of starch utilization was determined.

40|$|Retrograded starch {{is known}} to be {{resistant}} to digestion. We used enzyme kinetic experiments to examine how retrogradation of starch affects <b>amylolysis</b> catalysed by porcine pancreatic amylase. Parallel studies employing differential scanning calorimetry, infra red spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy were performed to monitor changes in supramolecular structure of gelatinised starch as it becomes retrograded. The total digestible starch and the catalytic efficiency of amylase were both decreased with increasing evidence of retrogradation. A purified sample of retrograded high amylose starch inhibited amylase directly. These new findings demonstrate that amylase binds to retrograded starch. Therefore consumption of retrograded starch may not only be beneficial to health through depletion of total digestible starch, and therefore the metabolisable energy, but may also slow the rate of intestinal digestion through direct inhibition of α-amylase.

However, very few studies have explored the relationship between saliva, individual liking and usual dietary intake. The aim of our study was to evaluate the association of salivary flow and composition with both a liking for fat, saltiness and sweetness and the usual nutrient intake in an adult French population. Liking for fat, saltiness, and sweetness were inferred from liking scores obtained during hedonic tests on 32 food products among 282 French adults participating in the Nutrinet- Santé Study. Before assessing liking, resting saliva was collected. Standard biochemical analyses were performed to assess specific component concentrations and enzymatic activities. Dietary data were collected using three web-based 24 h records. Relationships between salivary flow and composition, sensory liking and nutrient intake were assessed using linear regression. Total antioxidant capacity was positively associated with simple carbohydrate intake (β = 31. 3, 95 % CI = 1. 58; 60. 99) and inversely related to complex carbohydrate consumption (β = - 52. 4, 95 % CI = - 87. 51; - 19. 71). <b>Amylolysis</b> was positively associated with both total (β = 0. 20, 95 % CI = 0. 01; 0. 38) and simple carbohydrate intake (β = 0. 21, 95 % CI = 0. 01; 0. 39). Salivary flow was positively associated with liking for fat (β = 0. 14, 95 % CI = 0. 03; 0. 25). Proteolysis was positively associated with liking for saltiness and for fat (β = 0. 31, 95 % CI = 0. 02; 0. 59; β = 0. 28, 95 % CI = 0. 01; 0. 56, respectively). <b>Amylolysis</b> was inversely associated with liking for sweetness (β = - 10. 13, 95 % CI = - 19. 51; - 0. 75). Carbonic anhydrase 6 was inversely associated with liking for saltiness (β = - 46. 77, 95 % CI = - 86. 24; - 7. 30).

40|$|Although {{considerable}} {{information is}} available about <b>amylolysis</b> rate, extent and pattern of granular starches, the underlying mechanisms of enzyme action and interactions are not fully understood, {{partly due to the}} lack of direct visualisation of enzyme binding and subsequent hydrolysis of starch granules. In the present study, α-amylase (AA) from porcine pancreas was labelled with either fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) or tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC) fluorescent dye with maintenance of significant enzyme activity. The binding of FITC/TRITC-AA conjugate to the surface and interior of granules was studied under both non-hydrolysing (0 °C) and hydrolysing (37 °C) conditions with confocal microscopy. It was observed that enzyme binding to maize starch granules under both conditions was more homogenous compared with potato starch. Enzyme molecules appear to preferentially bind to the granules or part of granules that are more susceptible to enzymic degradation. The specificity is such that fresh enzyme added after a certain time of incubation binds at the same location as previously bound enzyme. By visualising the enzyme location during binding and hydrolysis, detailed information is provided regarding the heterogeneity of granular starch digestion...|$|E

40|$|The {{faba bean}} (Vicia faba L.) is an {{economical}} protein source used {{in food and}} feed worldwide. It has high protein content and well-balanced amino acid composition. Since the starch fraction of faba beans causes problems in protein gelation, it hinders the use of whole faba beans for tofu production. Due to economical, ecological and nutritional reasons, it is worthwhile {{to develop a new}} way for producing whole faba bean tofu without discarding any part of faba beans. The aim of this thesis work was to produce whole faba bean glucono- -lactone (GDL) tofu by the starch <b>amylolysis</b> treatment and to study the impact of starch hydrolysate on faba bean tofu properties. This research investigated the changes in faba bean emulsion and emulsion gel properties with or without the starch hydrolysate. The pH and soluble protein content of faba bean suspensions with different GDL concentrations were measured. The microstructure, particle size distribution and viscosity of faba bean emulsions were studied. Moreover, the rheological and textural properties, microstructure, water holding capacity and total solid content of faba bean emulsion gels (GDL tofu) were also investigated. In addition, the contribution of different protein-protein interactive forces to the maintenance of faba bean emulsion gels was evaluated by comparing the protein resolubilization extent of the gels immersed in different reagents. Whole faba bean GDL tofu was prepared by the starch <b>amylolysis</b> treatment, emulsification and gelation processes. The starch hydrolysate containing faba bean emulsion gel was less elastic and more viscous than the starch-free gel. The presence of the starch hydrolysate increased the pH and viscosity of faba bean emulsions, which resulted in weakened protein-protein interactions. The starch hydrolysate significantly reduced the contribution of disulfide bonds to the maintenance of faba bean gel networks, but it increased the contribution of non-covalent interactions. In addition, the microstructure of the starch hydrolysate containing faba bean emulsion gel was not as fine and uniform as that of the starch-free gel. The presence of the starch hydrolysate lowered the water holding capacity and decreased the gel strength of faba bean tofu. All in all, the quality of the whole faba bean GDL tofu containing the starch hydrolysate was not comparable to that of the starch-free faba bean tofu, and further improvements are still required to improve its quality...|$|E

The α-amylase-treated PSGs displayed the greatest pore size and ratio of cavity-to-granule diameters. Gelatinization onset temperatures of PSGs increased to 72. 1 (α-), 68. 7 (β-), and 68. 1 °C (gluco-amylolysis) after 8 h; enthalpy changes of β- and gluco-amylase-treated PSGs increased to 13. 4, and 13. 1 J/g but α-amylase-treated one showed slightly reduced value of 8. 5 J/g. Water holding capacities of PSGs were 209. 7 (α-), 94. 6 (β-), and 133. 8 % (gluco-amylolysis), and the untreated control had 89. 1 %; oil holding capacities of them showed 304. 5, 182. 7, and 211. 5 %, respectively, while the untreated control had 161. 8 %.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Medicinal {{plants have}} been {{reported}} {{to play an important role}} in modulating glycemic responses and have preventive and therapeutic implications. Several mechanisms have been proposed for the antidiabetic effect of medicinal plants such as inhibition of carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes, manipulation of glucose transporters, beta-cell regeneration and enhancing insulin-releasing activity. The present investigation evaluated the possible mechanism of action through which Ficus racemosa stem bark (Moraceae) exerts its hypoglycemic effect using suitable in vitro techniques. RESULTS: Ficus racemosa bark (FRB) exhibited significantly higher (P <= 0. 01) glucose-binding capacity than wheat bran (WB) and acarbose (ACB) consequently showed significantly higher (P <= 0. 01) retardation of glucose diffusion compared to WB and ACB. In case of <b>amylolysis</b> kinetics the liberation of glucose was greatly inhibited by FRB, as reflected by a significantly lower (P <= 0. 01) glucose diffusion rate in the system containing FRB compared to the control and acarbose. Furthermore, FRB significantly increased (P <= 0. 01) the rate of glucose transport across the yeast cell membrane and also in isolated rat hemi-diaphragm. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate F. racemosa bark to possess strong hypoglycemic effect and hence can be utilized as an adjunct in the management of diabetes mellitus.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cassava cultivars are {{classified}} following different criteria, such as cyanogenic glucoside content or starch content. Here, flours from {{the roots of}} 25 cassava varieties cultivated simultaneously in a single plantation, were characterized in terms of starch content (SC), amylose content (AC), alpha-amylolysis index (AI) and gel formation ability. Resistant starch content (RS) was measured in 10 of the samples. RESULTS: Cassava flours exhibited high SC, low AC and low AI values, with differences among varieties. Cluster analysis based on these parameters divided the cultivars in four groups differing mainly in SC and AC. AI and AC were inversely correlated (r = - 0. 59, P < 0. 05) in 18 of the cultivars, suggesting AC as an important factor governing the susceptibility to enzymatic hydrolysis of starch in raw cassava. Differences in susceptibility to <b>amylolysis,</b> assessed by RS, were also recorded in the sample subset analyzed. Most flours yielded pastes or gels upon heating and cooling. Gels differed in their subjective grade of firmness, but none exhibited syneresis, confirming the low retrogradation proclivity of cassava starch. CONCLUSION: Some differences were found among cassava samples, which may be ascribed to inter-cultivar variation. This informationmay have application in further agronomic studies or for developing industrial uses for this crop. (C) 2011 Society of Chemical Industr...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge of {{the food}} {{processing}} methods and conditions {{as well as the}} underlying mechanism that leads to the formation of resistant starch (RS) in foods is of great importance for nutritionists as well as food industries, since it offers the possibility of increasing the RS content in processed foods. RS is normally defined as that portion of dietary starch that escapes digestion in the small intestine of a healthy human. The amount of RS in a given food is determined by many different factors. Food form and structure, botanical source of the starch and its amylose content, other dietary constituents, notably protein and fat, the presence of a-amylase inhibitors and other antinutrients, the methods used to manufacture and store foods, and culinary practices all directly influence starch digestibility in the gut. Although most of the attention that RS has attracted from health professionals relates to its positive effects on bowel health, there is theoretical and mounting experimental evidence that RS has beneficial physiological properties, which extend beyond the gastrointestinal tract. Food scientists have attempted to enhance the level of enzyme-resistant retrograded starch in the diet. Numerous studies are carried out to characterize the molecular and microstructural organization of RS fractions, aiming at unraveling the mechanisms of <b>amylolysis</b> resistance...|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of amylose-lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) inclusion complexes renders amylose {{less susceptible to}} amylase digestion. In order to better understand this phenomenon on a structural level, the complexation of 9 % wheat starch suspensions with 0, 2, 3, and 5 % exogenous LPC was developed in RVA. Amylose-LPC inclusion complexes were isolated after 15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min in vitro digestion of the wheat starch suspensions to quantify the amount of non-complexed amylose by spectrophotometry. The samples were dissolved in DMSO containing 0. 5 % LiBr and exposed to iodine. In addition, parts of the digesta were defatted and subjected to the same procedure to elucidate {{the total amount of}} amylose that remained undigested. In this way, more insight was obtained into the protective effect of amylose-LPC complex formation on digestion of starch. This study confirms that the amylose susceptibility to <b>amylolysis</b> decreases in the presence of LPC. Higher LPC concentrations not only induced the {{formation of}} more amylose inclusion complexes but also resulted in more stable complexes which remained undigested as well as longer amylose chains after enzyme hydrolysis, due to the presence of LPC inside the amylose helix. In addition, a higher melting enthalpy of the amylose-LPC complexes in the digesta demonstrates the protective effect of LPC during enzyme hydrolysis...|$|E
40|$|Cassava bread ("casabe") is {{a product}} {{elaborated}} with grated and fermented pulp of bitter cassava, very popular in some Caribbean countries, rich in carbohydrates, low protein content and an acceptable level of cyanide. The goal {{of this research was}} to study the effect of the addition of pigeon pea flour (Cajanus cajan), as protein source, on the chemical, nutritional and sensory quality of cassava bread as compared to those shown by the "catebía" (cassava flour used to produce cassava bread) or a cassava bread sample elaborated without pigeon pea flour (control). Cassava breads elaborated with the addition of 25 and 35 % of pigeon pea flour (C- 75 / 25 y C- 65 / 35) presented higher content of protein, fat, fiber, ash and resistant starch, and lower contents of carbohydrates, cyanide, in vitro alpha- <b>amylolysis</b> rate and calories than those shown by their counterpart without pigeon pea flour. The acceptability of cassava breads containing pigeon pea flour was similar to the control, but with lower values for color and odor, and higher with regard to texture and flavor. The increased levels of protein and resistant starch in cassava bread with pigeon pea flour, combined with lower caloric intake, may benefit people requiring a low carbohydrate diet and diabetic and obese patients; moreover, would encourage the cultivation and use of pigeon pea as high protein legume.

40|$|There are {{two common}} alleles at the Amylase- 2 locus in populations of Gammarus palustris, the salt marsh amphipod. Intensive {{sampling}} of individuals from two localities at Jamaica Bay revealed a consistent pattern of heterozygote deficiency. —Five possible sources of heterozygote deficiency {{were examined in}} this study. Four of them—selection against heterozygotes, null alleles at the locus, assortative mating for amylase genotype and inbreeding—are inconsistent with the evidence and are rejected. The fifth possibility, Wahlund effects due to genetic differentiation of the population, is tentatively accepted. Although {{there is no direct}} evidence for differentiation within this population, separate populations along the Eastern seaboard are highly differentiated in a nonclinal pattern. Furthermore, the Wahlund hypothesis is consistent with observations on differences in degree of deficiency exhibited among collections at Jamaica Bay. —Animals from this population exhibit feeding preferences correlated with genotype. Given the choice of two green algae, Enteromorpha or Ulva, the frequency of the slow allele among individuals choosing Enteromorpha was higher than among those choosing Ulva. This suggests that the animals assort themselves in the field into subpopulations with different allelic frequencies. This assortment could contribute to the maintenance of the polymorphism and to the observed heterozygote deficiency. We hypothesize that genotype influences behavior in this system through the action of enzyme on substrate, which determines the nature of the oligosaccharide pool liberated early in <b>amylolysis...</b>|$|E
40|$|Starches were {{isolated}} from soaked and malted sorghum and studied {{to understand their}} physicochemical and functional properties. The swelling power (SP) and the water solubility index (WSI) of both starches were nearly similar at temperatures below 50 °C, but at more than 50 °C, the starch isolated from malted sorghum showed lower SP and high WSI than those isolated from raw and soaked sorghum. The pasting properties of starches determined by rapid visco-analyzer (RVA) showed that malted sorghum starch had a lower viscosity peak value (86 BU/RVU) than raw sorghum starch (454 BU/RVU). For both sorghum, X-ray diffractograms exhibited an A-type diffraction pattern, typical of cereal starches and the relative degrees of crystallinity ranged from 9. 62 to 15. 50 %. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) revealed that raw sorghum starch showed an endotherm with a peak temperature (Tp) at 78. 06 °C and gelatinization enthalpies of 2. 83 J/g whereas five-day malted sorghum starch had a Tp at 47. 22 °C and gelatinization enthalpies of 2. 06 J/g. Storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G″) of all starch suspensions increased steeply to a maximum at 70 °C and then decreased with continuous heating. The structural analysis of malted sorghum starch showed porosity on the granule’s surface susceptible to the <b>amylolysis.</b> The results showed that physicochemical and functional properties of sorghum starches are influenced by soaking and malting methods...|$|E
40|$|Precooked flours (PCFs) were {{prepared}} by milling boiled and freeze-dried red kidney beans, white beans and lentils. As demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy, PCFs were rich in relatively large particles which contained cell structures filled with starch. In contrast, flours from raw seeds contained {{a large number}} of free starch granules. The in vitro a-amylolysis rate ofPCFs was remarkably low, but increased after physical and chemical treatments of the flours. Homogenization resulted in the largest increase of hydrolysis rate. The susceptibility to enzymatic hydrolysis was also enhanced when PCFs were preincubated with pepsin or submitted to additional boiling. These treatments promoted evident alterations in the microscopic appearance of the cotyledon cell walls of the PCFs, changes that ranged from an apparently thinner surface (pepsin effect), to an almost complete disruption (homogenization effect). A flour prepared from boiled and vacuum-dried red beans showed Jess structural integrity and greater rate of <b>amylolysis</b> than the corresponding PCF, indicating that the drying procedure may influence the microstructural and digestibility features of precooked legumi nous materials. Neither cell walls nor starch granules were observed after suspending PCFs in 2 N KOH, giving support to the use of alkaline pre-treatment for the evaluation of to tal starch content of PCFs by enzymatic procedures. The present results suggest the persistence of starch granules enclosed in cotyledon cells as a primary reason for the limited enzymatic availability of starch in PCFs...|$|E
40|$|Functional pollen {{is needed}} to {{successfully}} complete fertilization. Pollen is formed inside the anthers following a specific sequence of developmental stages, from microsporocyte meiosis to pollen release, that concerns microsporocytes/microspores and anther wall tissues. The processes involved may not be synchronous within a flower, an anther, and even a microsporangium. Asynchrony has been barely analyzed, and its biological consequences have not been yet assessed. In this review, different processes of pollen development and lifetime, stressing on the possible consequences of their differential timing on pollen performance, are summarized. Development is usually synchronized until microsporocyte meiosis I (occasionally until meiosis II). Afterwards, a period of mostly asynchronous events extends up to anther opening as regards: (1) meiosis II (sometimes); (2) microspore vacuolization and later reduction of vacuoles; (3) amylogenesis, <b>amylolysis,</b> and carbohydrate inter-conversion; (4) the first haploid mitosis; and (5) intine formation. Asynchrony would promote metabolic differences among developing microspores and therefore physiologically heterogeneous pollen grains within a single microsporangium. Asynchrony would increase the effect of competition for resources during development and pollen tube growth and also for water during (re) hydration on the stigma. The differences generated by developmental asynchronies may have an adaptive role since more efficient pollen grains would be selected with regard to homeostasis, desiccation tolerance, resilience, speed of (re) hydration, and germination. The performance of each pollen grain which landed onto the stigma will {{be the result of}} a series of selective steps determined by its development, physiological state at maturity, and successive environmental constrains...|$|E
40|$|Differences in amylase action {{pattern on}} {{amylopectin}} were {{demonstrated by the}} relation between the decrease in potassium iodide-iodine binding of waxy maize starch and the increase in reducing value during hydrolysis, as expressed by the RV 80 value (i. e., the reducing value for a potassium iodide-iodine binding value of 80 % of that of the starting material). In the initial stages of the hydrolysis, the ratio of the increase in the level of reducing polysaccharicles to the increase in the total level of reducing sugars formed during <b>amylolysis</b> of amylopectin can be considered as a measure of the level of inner chain attack (LICA) in the overall hydrolysis of the amylopectin structure and correlated with the respective RV 80 value. Bacillus amyloliquefaciens alpha-amylase and Aspergillus oryzae alpha-amylase, with the lowest RV 80 and the highest LICA values, hydrolysed the inner chains of amylopectin {{to a greater extent than}} did porcine pancreatic alpha-amylase. In the initial stages of hydrolysis, Bacillus stearothermophilus maltogenic amylase, like the Bacillus cereus beta-amylase, did not display any significant degree of internal hydrolysis of amylopectin, in line with the high RV 80 and very low LICA values for these enzymes. However, at the later stages of hydrolysis, the maltogenic amylase probably exhibited a significant degree of internal hydrolysis of amylopectin, which itself seems to depend on temperature. The temperature dependence of the hydrolysis pattern of this enzyme is relevant for interpretation of its action as antifirming enzyme in bread-making applications. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{in vitro}} <b>amylolysis</b> of both {{granular}} and cooked maize starch and {{the diffusion of}} glucose {{in the presence of}} 1 % and 2 % cereal soluble fibre polysaccharides (arabinoxylan and mixed linkage beta-glucan) were studied at various levels of shear mixing in order to identify potential molecular mechanisms underlying observed glycemia-reducing effects of soluble fibres in vivo. The presence of soluble fibres increased viscosity by ca. 10 × and 100 × for 1 % and 2 % concentrations respectively. Despite this large difference in viscosity, measured digestion and mass transfer coefficients were only reduced by a factor of 1. 5 to 2. 5 at the same mixing speed. In contrast, introduction of mixing in the digesting and diffusing medium significantly increased the rate of amylolytic starch digestion and mass transfer of glucose. This effect is such that mixing at high speeds negates the hindering effect of the 100 × increased viscosity imparted by the presence of 2 % soluble fibre; this is essentially captured by the Reynolds number (the ratio of inertial and viscous forces) that defines the flow kinematics. The modest reduction of in vitro starch hydrolysis and glucose diffusion at increased viscosity suggests that the established benefits of soluble fibres on post-prandial glycaemia, in terms of attenuation of the overall rate and extent of dietary starch conversion to blood glucose, are not primarily due to a direct effect of viscosity. Alternative hypotheses are proposed based on gastric emptying, restriction of turbulent flow, and/or stimulation of mucus turnover...|$|E
