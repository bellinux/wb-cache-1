5|$|Wodehouse's {{early period}} {{as a writer}} {{came to an end}} in 1908 with the {{serialisation}} of The Lost Lambs, published the following year in book form as {{the second half of the}} novel Mike. The work begins as a conventional school story, but Wodehouse introduces a new and strikingly original character, Psmith, whose creation both Evelyn Waugh and George Orwell regarded as a watershed in Wodehouse's development. Wodehouse said that he based Psmith on the hotelier and impresario Rupert D'Oyly Carte—"the only thing in my literary career which was handed to me on a silver plate with watercress around it". Wodehouse wrote in the 1970s that a cousin of his who had been at school with Carte told him of the latter's monocle, studied suavity, and stateliness of speech, all of which Wodehouse adopted for his new character. Psmith featured in three more novels: Psmith in the City (1910), a burlesque of banking; Psmith, Journalist (1915) set in New York; <b>and</b> <b>Leave</b> <b>It</b> to Psmith (1923), set at Blandings Castle.|$|E

Because of the track arrangement, trains can only enter the Penn Station spur from the mainline heading north <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> heading south; there are still single-track sections north of Timonium, limiting headways in that section to 15 minutes.|$|E

25|$|It {{may be that}} non-colonizing technologically capable alien civilizations exist, {{but that}} they are simply too far apart for {{meaningful}} two-way communication. If two civilizations are separated by several thousand light-years, {{it is possible that}} one or both cultures may become extinct before meaningful dialogue can be established. Human searches may be able to detect their existence, but communication will remain impossible because of distance. It has been suggested that this problem might be ameliorated somewhat if contact/communication is made through a Bracewell probe. In this case at least one partner in the exchange may obtain meaningful information. Alternatively, a civilization may simply broadcast its knowledge, <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> to the receiver to make what they may of it. This is similar to the transmission of information from ancient civilizations to the present, and humanity has undertaken similar activities like the Arecibo message, which could transfer information about Earth's intelligent species, even if it never yields a response or does not yield a response in time for humanity to receive it. It is also possible that archaeological evidence of past civilizations may be detected through deep space observations.|$|E

500|$|Thurston {{began an}} inquest on September 23, and on September 28 he {{concluded}} that Hendrix had aspirated his own vomit and died of asphyxia while intoxicated with barbiturates. Citing [...] "insufficient evidence of [...] circumstances", he recorded an open verdict. He commented: [...] "The {{cause of death was}} clearly inhalation of vomit due to barbiturate intoxication, but there is no evidence as to intention to commit suicide... If the question of intention cannot be answered, then it is proper to find the cause of death <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> an open verdict." [...] Dannemann later stated that Hendrix had taken nine of her prescribed Vesparax sleeping tablets. Intended to be taken in half-tablet doses, nine tablets of the powerful sedative amounted to 18 times the recommended amount.|$|E

He wanted to avoid the Victorian notions of [...] "fairies" [...] or mischievous imps associated with the word and was aiming at the more elevated notions of beings [...] "supposed to possess formidable magical powers in early Teutonic mythology" [...] (OED viz. the Old English ælf, from Proto-Germanic *albo-z).|$|E

500|$|Due to lack {{of funds}} at the time (the building's initial budget doubled, ending up at $325,000 ($ in modern dollars) {{including}} furnishings), Richardson devoted most of his efforts to the building's exterior. A report from the Times Union states, [...] "There wasn't enough money for Richardson {{to do the job}} as thoroughly as he would have liked. He said in his writing that if there wasn't sufficient money, he'd rather do it right on the outside <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> to a future generation to finish the interior. The interior was finished by city architects a good 30 years after Richardson built it." [...] The interior was redesigned by Ogden and Gander in 1917. The mayor's office is {{on the first floor of}} the tower, the Council chamber and offices are on the building's second floor, and the city clerk's office is on the second floor of the tower. The mayor's office contains a painting of the city's first mayor, Pieter Schuyler.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, McCormack co-starred in the A {{television}} miniseries The Andromeda Strain, {{a remake}} of the 1971 movie {{based on the novel}} by Michael Crichton. In the miniseries, he played Jack Nash, a television reporter who battles an addiction to cocaine. The Andromeda Strain received mixed reviews, and McCormack's performance was criticized. Joanna Weiss of the Boston Globe wrote, [...] "The presence of Eric McCormack, as an intrepid TV reporter, is especially extraneous (no disrespect to intrepid reporters)." [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today commented, [...] "The central cast is completed by... poor Eric McCormack as a crusading, coke-addicted journalist who spends {{the second half of the}} movie playing Rambo in the desert. Let's just say McCormack does the best he can with what he's given, <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> at that." [...] On September 5, 2008, McCormack made a guest appearance in the seventh season and 100th episode of the television series Monk, where he played an unctuous host of a television crime docudrama.|$|E

500|$|When the {{election}} came in August 1935, Aberhart offered economic recovery while Reid offered criticisms of Aberhart. Highlighting the UFA's record of clean government, low taxes, and fiscal responsibility, Reid committed {{himself and his}} government to bringing a sense of security. More tangibly, he promised to build a government oil refinery (predicting that [...] "the near future will witness the greatest explorations for oil which this province has ever known"). Most of the campaign was conducted around Social Credit's promise to pull the province out of depression with its monetary theories. Reid alleged that Aberhart's policies would destroy the province's credit <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> unable to borrow the money it needed to carry on, but voters—even those sceptical of Social Credit's promises—saw no alternative hopes offered by the UFA. On 11 August, election day, every UFA MLA was defeated; Reid himself finished third in his riding, barely ahead of the Communist candidate, and resigned as Premier effective 22 August.|$|E
500|$|The {{show was}} much less {{politically}} focused than it later became under Jon Stewart, having what Stephen Colbert described as a local news feel and involving more character-driven humor as opposed to news-driven humor. Winstead recalls that when the show was first launched there was constant debate regarding what the show's focus should be. While she wanted a more news-driven focus, the network was concerned that this would not appeal to viewers and pushed for [...] "a little more of a hybrid of entertainment and politics". The show was slammed by some reviewers as being too mean-spirited, particularly towards the interview subjects of field pieces; a criticism acknowledged {{by some of the}} show's cast. Describing his time as a correspondent under Kilborn, Colbert says, [...] "You wanted to take your soul off, put it on a wire hanger, <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> in the closet before you got on the plane to do one of these pieces." [...] One reviewer from The New York Times criticized the show for being too cruel and for lacking a central editorial vision or ideology, describing it as [...] "bereft of an ideological or artistic center... precocious but empty." ...|$|E
500|$|Filming for {{the pilot}} was {{initially}} intended {{to take place in}} an actual Los Angeles neighborhood until the production team realized the difficulties that would ensue. [...] Instead they chose Colonial Street, a backlot street set at Universal Studios Hollywood. The house sets on Colonial Street had been used in numerous film and television productions as early as 1946. Many of the sets, whose styles ranged from contemporary to Victorian to ranch, were remodeled to create a uniform neighborhood. Cherry and production designer Thomas A. Walsh wanted the street to recall the Eisenhower era and convey traditional American values, but appear modern at the same time. Walsh viewed episodes of Father Knows Best, My Three Sons, <b>and</b> <b>Leave</b> <b>It</b> to Beaver, among other television series, to capture the visual style of classic conservative America. Walsh commented, [...] "We were trying to honor that sensibility {{and at the same time}} create an everyplace that was neither a red state nor a blue state." [...] Instead, Walsh insisted that the street was in [...] "kind of a pink state. We're somewhere in the middle of America's soul." [...] Refurbishments of the house sets, which included building interior rooms, cost around $700,000. While Walsh strove for a visually unified look for the street as a whole, he carefully designed the interior of each home to reflect the tastes and budgets of the characters.|$|E

500|$|According to the {{publications}} Zeek: A Jewish Journal of Thought and Culture and Value War: Public Opinion and the Politics of Gay Rights, {{it was the}} controversial lesbian outing of the main character (played by Ellen DeGeneres) in the sitcom Ellen in 1997 that {{paved the way for}} Patty's coming-out in this episode, as well as for many other gay characters on other television shows. In his book Queers in American Popular Culture, Jim Elledge noted that unlike many episodes of The Simpsons that go through a situation and then everything returns to normal during the ending, this one does not. He commented that the staff of the show could have made Patty heterosexual again {{at the end of the}} episode <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> how it was before by having her marry Leslie. Instead, they ended it in a way that could potentially be experienced as distasteful to the heteronormative audience by having Patty exclaim [...] "Hell no! I like girls!" [...] to Leslie's marriage proposal. The author also noted that it is possible the Simpsons staff chose Patty to come out as gay instead of a male character because lesbians were [...] "traditionally considered more acceptable" [...] on television. She did, however, not [...] "adhere to the eroticized male lesbian fantasy or fit into the loveable, asexual guise of the comedy lesbian" [...] that had previously been seen on shows such as Ellen. Instead, Patty is [...] "rude, crude, and not ashamed of declaring her sexual preferences", and this could make her unpalatable to some viewers according to Elledge.|$|E
500|$|On 13 February 1969, Negus and {{two others}} (Sir Geoffrey Keynes and Sir Stanford Cade) were {{presented}} with the Honorary Gold Medal of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. This award, which had only been made thirty times since 1802 prior to the 1969 ceremony, is presented for [...] "liberal acts or distinguished labours, researches and discoveries, eminently conducive to the improvement of natural knowledge and of the healing art." [...] The medal was presented by Sir Hedley Atkins, the President of the Royal College of Surgeons, who paid tribute to Negus: [...] "Sir Victor Negus {{is perhaps the most}} distinguished of all those who have served the Council as a co-opted member. He has always been known to us as a great research worker and scientist, whose labours earned him the Lister Medal, a man of exceptional integrity and industry and a persistent advocate of the value of tradition in its best sense." [...] Atkins also paid tribute to Negus's wife, Lady Negus, who had crafted and presented to the college a tapestry of its coat-of-arms. Responding, Negus thanked the members of the Council for the award and for the privilege of having used college facilities since 1921, concluding: [...] "I take this honour as a mark of approval for any work I have done, and I feel I can now sit back <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> to others to carry on.
