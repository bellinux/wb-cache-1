5|$|Potter's {{adolescence}} was <b>as</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>as</b> her childhood. She {{grew into}} a spinsterish young woman whose parents groomed {{her to be a}} permanent resident and housekeeper in their home. She continued to paint and draw, and experienced her first professional artistic success in 1890 when she sold six designs of humanised animals to a greeting card publisher. She hoped to lead a useful life independent of her parents, and tentatively considered a career in mycology, but the all-male scientific community regarded her as an amateur and she abandoned fungi.|$|E
25|$|An August 2009 {{report from}} the U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence {{estimated}} the Severodvinsk submarines to be the quietest, or least detectable, of contemporaneous Russian and Chinese nuclear submarines but is still not <b>as</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>as</b> contemporary U.S. Navy submarines (i.e. Seawolf and Virginia classes).|$|E
25|$|Benchtop {{table saws}} {{are the least}} {{expensive}} and least capable {{of the three major}} types; however, they can offer adequate capacity and precision for many tasks. The universal motor is not as durable or <b>as</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>as</b> an induction motor, but it offers more power relative to its size and weight. The top of a benchtop table saw is narrower than those of the contractors and cabinet saws, so the width of stock that can be ripped is reduced. Another restriction results from the top being smaller {{from the front of the}} tabletop to the rear. This results in a shorter rip fence, which makes it harder to make a clean, straight cut when ripping. Also, there is less distance from the front edge of the tabletop to the blade, which makes cross cutting stock using a mitre more difficult (the mitre and/or stock may not be fully supported by the table in front of the blade). Benchtop saws are the smallest type of table saw and have the least mass, potentially resulting in increased vibration during a cut.|$|E

500|$|Even in {{his adult}} years, Berry was soft-spoken and reserved. He {{preferred}} not {{to draw attention to}} himself, and was described by sportswriter Jim Murray as [...] "polite as a deacon, <b>as</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>as</b> a monk." [...] Both as a player and as a coach, he was studious, serious, and orderly; [...] "He was too straight and narrow—but a great guy, a hell of a guy," [...] former Colts teammate Art Donovan said of Berry. [...] "He was a little peculiar, to say the least." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{painting}} {{was purchased by}} The Rembrandt Society for fl.520.000 (€235.000 or about €4.640.000 today), {{with the aid of}} wealthy shipowner Willem van der Vorm, and donated to the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam. [...] In 1938, the piece was highlighted in a special exhibition at the Rotterdam museum, along with 450 Dutch masterpieces dating from 1400–1800. A. Feulner wrote in the [...] "Magazine for [...] History of Art", [...] "In the rather isolated area in which the Vermeer picture hung, it was <b>as</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>as</b> in a chapel. The feeling of the consecration overflows on the visitors, although the picture has no ties to ritual or church." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{research}} was conducted by the Transport Research Laboratory, and the findings were published in 2011. The study found little correlation between pedestrian vehicle involvement density and noise level {{for the majority of}} vehicles. In addition, the analysis found no evidence of a pattern in pedestrian vehicle involvement densities when only considering those accidents occurring on [...] or slower roads, or where the pedestrian was disabled. A previous study did not find an increased pedestrian vehicle involvement density for electric and hybrid vehicles with respect to their conventional counterparts, which raised the question as to whether added sound is necessarily required. The study also noted that some modern conventional cars are <b>as</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>as</b> their electric counterparts, even at low speeds.|$|E

500|$|Schuyler and Washington were devastated {{upon hearing}} of Montgomery's death. Schuyler {{believed}} that without Montgomery, victory in Canada was not possible. He wrote to Congress and Washington that [...] "My amiable friend, the gallant Montgomery, is no more; the brave Arnold is wounded; {{and we have}} met a severe check, in an unsuccessful attempt on Quebec, May Heaven be graciously pleased that the misfortune may terminate here." [...] Washington wrote to Schuyler, [...] "In the death of this gentleman, America has sustained a heavy loss, as he had approved himself a steady friend to her rights and of ability to render her the most essential services." [...] Congress reacted to Montgomery's death by {{trying to keep the}} loss <b>as</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>as</b> possible. They feared the news would lower the morale of the troops and civilians.|$|E
500|$|The song's musical {{structure}} {{is characterized by}} intervals in which the music builds to a potential break, but softly decrescendos instead. As each verse concludes, the song's snapping, electronic rhythm track gradually softens and rippling synth chords repeat throughout the song. Marc Hogan of Spin writes that Diplo [...] "teases us {{with the sort of}} wubba-wubba subwoofer noises that have become inescapable in {{the past year or so}} of pop radio. But he never actually gives in with the full dubstep drop ... the song keeps swelling to one big wave after another, without ever really reaching a single, song-stopping crescendo." [...] Hogan cites the bridge at around the three-minute mark as [...] "the closest thing to a climax" [...] on the song, [...] "when the track gets <b>as</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>as</b> it ever has before becoming as lush as it ever gets." [...] Pitchfork Media's Carrie Battan calls the song [...] "an exercise in the power of restraint", commenting that [...] "Diplo shows uncharacteristic subtlety behind Usher's sentiment, with a beat that seems to hang suspended in midair." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of December25, Washington ordered his army to prepare three days' food, and issued orders that every soldier be {{outfitted}} with fresh flints for their muskets. [...] He was also somewhat worried by intelligence reports that the British were planning their own crossing once the Delaware was frozen over. [...] At 4 pm Washington's army turned out for its evening parade, where the troops were issued ammunition, and even the officers and musicians were ordered to carry muskets. [...] They {{were told that they}} were departing on a secret mission. [...] Marching eight abreast in close formations, and ordered to be <b>as</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>as</b> possible, they left the camp for McKonkey's Ferry. [...] Washington's plan required the crossing to begin {{as soon as it was}} dark enough to conceal their movements on the river, but most of the troops did not reach the crossing point until about 6 pm, about ninety minutes after sunset. [...] The weather got progressively worse, turning from drizzle to rain to sleet and snow. [...] "It blew a hurricane," [...] recalled one soldier.|$|E

500|$|The {{immediate}} {{reaction of}} the Southern military and public sectors was that Gettysburg was a setback, not a disaster. The sentiment was that Lee had been successful on July 1 and had fought a valiant battle on July 2–3, but could not dislodge the Union Army from the strong defensive position to which it fled. The Confederates successfully stood their ground on July 4 and withdrew only after they realized Meade would not attack them. The withdrawal to the Potomac {{that could have been}} a disaster was handled masterfully. Furthermore, the Army of the Potomac had been kept away from Virginia farmlands for the summer and all predicted that Meade would be too timid to threaten them {{for the rest of the}} year. Lee himself had a positive view of the campaign, writing to his wife that the army had returned [...] "rather sooner than I had originally contemplated, but having accomplished what I proposed on leaving the Rappahannock, viz., relieving the Valley of the presence of the enemy and drawing his Army north of the Potomac." [...] He was quoted as saying to Maj. John Seddon, brother of the Confederate secretary of war, [...] "Sir, we did whip them at Gettysburg, and it will be seen for the next six months that that army will be <b>as</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>as</b> a sucking dove." [...] Some Southern publications, such as the Charleston Mercury, criticized Lee's actions in the campaign and on August 8, he offered his resignation to President Davis, who quickly rejected it.|$|E
2500|$|There then {{occurred}} {{an event}} which unsettled both Verdi and Boito, and which nearly caused {{the project to}} come to a complete stop. [...] While attending a banquet in Naples following the successful presentation of his opera Mefistofele, Boito gave an interview to a journalist and, in trying to keep information about the proposed Otello <b>as</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>as</b> possible, appears to have been misquoted by another journalist who overheard part of the conversation. [...] The key point was that Boito, himself a composer, appeared to want to compose the music for Otello himself. [...] When Verdi read this in a Milan newspaper, he was horrified and, in a letter to Faccio (rather than directly confronting Boito) stated that he wanted Faccio to directly tell the librettist that [...] "I will give him his manuscript intact, without a shadow of resentment, without rancor of any kind".|$|E
