5|$|In {{regard to}} the city, the emancipated slave was far from equal to a citizen by birth.

The products in zero and one dimensions are trivial, so non-trivial cross products only exist in three and seven dimensions.|$|E
25|$|Tabari {{was some}} {{fifty years old}} when al-Mu'tadid became caliph. He was well past seventy in the year his History was published.

Most, if not all, the materials for the histories of al-Mu'tadid, al-Muktafi, and {{the early years of}} al-Muqtadir were collected by him about the time the reported events took place.

25|$|Cycling in Melbourne is {{a popular}} pastime, <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> tell from the bevy of cyclists and paths that lie all {{throughout}} the city, {{as well as a}} spectator sport. Melbourne's flat terrain and extensive off-road paths in green wedges are conducive to riding. Beach Road combines with the Nepean Highway to form a 90-kilometre stretch from Port Melbourne to Sorrento, incorporating the Bayside Trail. It is the city's most popular training route and attracts cyclists from around the world. Thousands of commuters cycle the roads, bike lanes and bike paths daily. Bicycle Victoria's annual events, Around the Bay in a Day and Ride to Work Day, attract tens of thousands of Melburnians. Other events such as the Herald Sun Tour begin and end in the Melbourne area and there are many local cycling events of varying grades all year round.|$|E
25|$|In reality, just <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> {{discover}} {{from his}} poems and letters {{and just as}} Caragiale remembered, Eminescu was seldom {{under the influence of}} boisterous subconscious motivations. Eminescu's life was but an overlap of different-sized cycles, made up of sudden bursts that were nurtured by dreams and crises due to the impact with reality. The cycles could last from a few hours or days to weeks or months, depending on the importance of events, or could even last longer, when they were linked to the events that significantly marked his life, as such was his relation with Veronica, his political activity during his years as a student, or the fact that he attended the gatherings at the Junimea society or the articles he published in the newspaper Timpul. He used to have a unique manner of describing his own crisis of jealousy.|$|E

25|$|For signal processing, the Wiener filter is {{a filter}} {{proposed}} by Wiener during the 1940s {{and published in}} 1942 as a classified document. Its purpose {{is to reduce the}} amount of noise present in a signal by comparison with an estimation of the desired noiseless signal. Wiener developed the filter at the Radiation Laboratory at MIT to predict the position of German bombers from radar reflections. It is necessary to predict the future, because by the time the shell reaches the vicinity of the target, the target has moved, and maybe has changed direction slightly. They even modeled the muscle response of the pilot, which led eventually to cybernetics. The unmanned V1's were particularly easy to model, and on a good day, American guns fitted with Wiener filters would shoot down 99 out of 100 V1's as they entered Britain from the English channel, on their way to London. What emerged was a mathematical theory of great generality---a theory for predicting the future as best <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> on the basis of incomplete information about the past. It was a statistical theory that included applications that didn't strictly speaking predict the future, but only tried to remove noise. It made use of Wiener's earlier work on integral equations and Fourier transforms.|$|E
500|$|A relegated {{side with}} a number of players of [...] "mature age", Ipswich were a ticky {{proposition}} for a new manager, especially as there was [...] "no money" [...] to improve the squad, so Ramsey worked {{to make the most of}} whatever talent he had inherited. He made tactical innovations, noticed by the local newspaper: as early as his first game in charge he had his team taking three distinct styles of corner kick, in a game where the side put on [...] "as poor a performance <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> recollect at Portman Road". In Ramsey's first season as manager, he guided the club to third place in the Third Division South, with Ipswich scoring 106 goals in the 46 League games.|$|E

Finch later revealed that she had received letters from listeners about the storyline and one woman wrote to thank her because she had found a lump in her breast after listening to the show. Finch also named the storyline {{as one of her}} Archers highlights. Delyth Morgan, chief executive of Breakthrough said The Archers treated the subject of breast cancer [...] "as sensibly <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> reasonably expect." [...] Morgan continues saying that Breakthrough liked how the show had highlighted the effect that a cancer diagnosis can have on a partner. In contrast, the radio series Feedback reported that the storyline had initially attracted a negative response from listeners, who felt the subject should have been handled with more optimism.|$|E

500|$|While still {{detained}} by the French, Wodehouse was again mentioned in {{questions in the}} House of Commons in December 1944 when MPs wondered if the French authorities could repatriate him to stand trial. Eden stated that the [...] "matter has been gone into, and, according to the advice given, there are no grounds upon which we could take action". Two months later George Orwell wrote the essay [...] "In Defence of P.G. Wodehouse", where he stated that [...] "it is important to realise that the events of 1941 do not convict Wodehouse of anything worse than stupidity". Orwell's rationale was that Wodehouse's [...] "moral outlook has remained that of a public-school boy, {{and according to the}} public-school code, treachery in time of war is the most unforgivable of all the sins", which was compounded by his [...] "complete lack—so far <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> judge from his printed works—of political awareness".|$|E
500|$|St Ethelbert's Gate {{is one of}} {{the entrances}} to the south section of the Close. The room above the gateway was {{originally}} a chapel dedicated to Saint Ethelbert the King and came to be used by the school in 1944. It was used as an art room before its conversion into the Barbirolli music practice room, named after Lady Barbirolli, under Philip Stibbe's headship (1975–1984), a project financed by the Dyers. A scheduled monument, the gateway was built in 1316 by the citizens of Norwich as penance for a riot in 1272 which damaged many of the priory buildings. It was substantially restored in 1815 by William Wilkins, an Old Norvicensian, and underwent further renovations in 1964 which saw the stonework and carvings replaced under the supervision of Sir Bernard Feilden. Art historian Veronica Sekules describes the St Ethelbert's Gate {{as it was in the}} 14th century as [...] "a highly decorative building presenting a façade rich in images, which the cathedral otherwise lacked. In a sense it would have operated as a principal façade and, in as far <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> glean from the remaining images, it communicated a strong message designating the gate as the opening to hallowed ground beyond." ...|$|E
