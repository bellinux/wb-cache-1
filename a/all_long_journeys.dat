60|$|Next day Jones traded {{with the}} Yellow Knives. He had a goodly supply of baubles, besides blankets, gloves {{and boxes of}} canned goods, which he had brought for such trading. He secured {{a dozen of the}} large-boned, white and black Indian dogs, huskies, Rea called them--two long sleds with harness and several pairs of snowshoes. This trade made Jones rub his hands in satisfaction, for during <b>all</b> the <b>long</b> <b>journey</b> north he had failed to barter for such {{cardinal}} necessities to the success of his venture.|$|R
60|$|They {{travelled}} {{as rapidly}} as possible. The horses were <b>all</b> inured to <b>long</b> <b>journeys,</b> and they had made from fifty to sixty miles a day. They halted at a village, twenty miles east of Nagpore. Nothing unusual had happened, and Harry had just lain down to sleep, {{when there was a}} sound as of people gathering in front of his hut.|$|R
60|$|I didn't have none, so he left. I {{went to the}} raft, and {{set down}} in the wigwam to think. But I couldn't come to nothing. I thought till I wore my head sore, but I couldn't see no {{way out of the}} trouble. After <b>all</b> this <b>long</b> <b>journey,</b> and after <b>all</b> we'd done for them scoundrels, here it was all come to nothing, {{everything}} all busted up and ruined, because they could have the heart to serve Jim such a trick as that, and make him a slave again all his life, and amongst strangers, too, for forty dirty dollars.|$|R
60|$|During <b>all</b> the <b>long</b> <b>journey</b> {{over the}} {{mountains}} she had been gay and bright, while now, when {{they were about to}} part, perhaps never to meet again, she showed him the deeper and more earnest side of her character. It checked his boldness as nothing else had done. Suddenly there came to him the real meaning of a woman's love when she bestows it without reservation. Silenced by the thought that he had not understood her at all, and the knowledge that he had been half in sport, he gazed out over the wild country before them.|$|R
60|$|At {{the gate}} of the town there was a delay which made me nervous, since in such a case as mine delay might always mean a death-warrant. I knew that it was quite {{possible}} Cetewayo had changed, or been persuaded to change his mind and issue a command that I should be killed as one who had seen and knew too much. Indeed this fear was my constant companion during <b>all</b> the <b>long</b> <b>journey</b> to the Drift of the Tugela, causing me to look askance at every man we met or who overtook us, lest he should prove to be a messenger of doom.|$|R
60|$|Wampus started away. He was displeased {{with the}} other car. It did not suit him at all. And {{aside from the fact}} that the sour-faced {{individual}} who owned it had taken away two of Wampus' own passengers, the small shaggy Mumbles, who had been the established companion of Uncle John's chauffeur throughout <b>all</b> the <b>long</b> <b>journey,</b> suddenly deserted him. He whined to go {{with the other}} car, and when Patsy lifted him aboard he curled down beside the stranger as if thoroughly satisfied. Patsy knew why, and was amused that Mumbles showed his gratitude to Mr. Jones for rescuing him from the crab; but Wampus scowled and was distinctly unhappy all the way to Old Town.|$|R
60|$|But <b>all</b> <b>journeys,</b> <b>long</b> and short, {{must come}} to an end, and one fine morning the boys found {{themselves}} safe and sound in San Francisco, and {{on their way to}} the Palace Hotel. The trip overland had brightened them a good bit, and they no longer looked as green as when they had started.|$|R
60|$|Now I {{was at the}} bow of the balsa and Quilla was at its stern, {{and between}} us were the others, so that during <b>all</b> that <b>long</b> night's <b>journey</b> I had no speech with her and must content myself with gazing over my {{shoulder}} at her beauty as best I could, which was not well, because of Kari, who ever seemed to come between my eyes and hers.|$|R
6000|$|WHEN it was <b>all</b> over, the <b>long</b> <b>journey</b> home, {{the quiet}} funeral, the first sad excitement, {{then came the}} bitter moment when life says to the bereaved: [...] "Take up your burden and go on alone." [...] Christie's had been the still, tearless grief hardest to bear, most {{impossible}} to comfort; and, while Mrs. Sterling bore her loss with the sweet patience of a pious heart, and Letty mourned her brother with the tender sorrow that finds relief in natural ways, the widow sat among them, as tranquil, colorless, and mute, as if her soul had followed David, leaving the shadow of her former self behind.|$|R
60|$|In {{the next}} place, and {{parallel}} with the motor truck, there will develop the hired or privately owned motor carriage. This, for <b>all</b> except the <b>longest</b> <b>journeys,</b> will add a fine sense of personal independence to all the small conveniences of first-class railway travel. It will be capable of a day's journey of three hundred miles or more, long before the developments to be presently foreshadowed arrive. One will change nothing--unless it is the driver--from stage to stage. One will be free to dine where one chooses, hurry when one chooses, travel asleep or awake, stop and pick flowers, turn over in bed of a morning and tell the carriage to wait--unless, which is highly probable, one sleeps aboard.[7]...|$|R
60|$|Time passed, while Helen {{watched and}} learned and dreamed. The train stopped, at long intervals, at wayside {{stations}} where there seemed nothing but adobe sheds and lazy Mexicans, and dust and heat. Bo awoke {{and began to}} chatter, and to dig into the basket. She learned from the conductor that Magdalena was only two stations on. And she was full of conjectures as to who would meet them, what would happen. So Helen was drawn back to sober realities, {{in which there was}} considerable zest. Assuredly she did not know what was going to happen. Twice Riggs passed up and down the aisle, his dark face and light eyes and sardonic smile deliberately forced upon her sight. But again Helen fought a growing dread with contemptuous scorn. This fellow was not half a man. It was not conceivable what he could do, except annoy her, until she arrived at Pine. Her uncle was to meet her or send for her at Snowdrop, which place, Helen knew, was distant a good long ride by stage from Magdalena. This stage-ride was the climax and the dread of <b>all</b> the <b>long</b> <b>journey,</b> in Helen's considerations.|$|R
60|$|Through {{weakness}} and sickness and faintness, Otto had lain {{in a half}} swoon through <b>all</b> that <b>long</b> <b>journey</b> under the hot May sun. It was as in a dreadful nightmare {{that he had heard}} {{on and on and on}} that monotonous throbbing of galloping hoofs upon the ground; had felt that last kiss that his father had given him upon his cheek. Then the onward ride again, until all faded away into a dull mist and he knew no more. When next he woke it was with the pungent smell of burned vinegar in his nostrils and with the feeling of a cool napkin bathing his brow. He opened his eyes and then closed them again, thinking he must have been in a dream, for he lay in his old room at the peaceful monastery of the White Cross on the hill; the good Father Abbot sat near by, gazing upon his face with the old absent student look, Brother John sat in the deep window seat also gazing at him, and Brother Theodore, the leech of the monastery, sat beside him bathing his head. Beside these old familiar faces were the faces of those who had been with him in that long flight; the One-eyed Hans, old Master Nicholas his kinsman, and the others. So he closed his eyes, thinking that maybe it was all a dream. But the sharp throbbing of the poor stump at his wrist soon taught him that he was still awake.|$|R
60|$|It is a <b>long</b> <b>journey</b> from Paris to Berne {{even for}} those who can travel first class and express--that is, if sixteen hours can be called a <b>long</b> <b>journey.</b> For those who have to jog along by third class, {{stopping}} at all the little country stations, it is a <b>long</b> and tedious <b>journey</b> indeed. The <b>longest</b> <b>journey</b> ends at last. The train rolled slowly into the station of Berne, and Fanny descended with her box. Her wanderings were over for the present. She would find her mistress and be at rest.|$|R
