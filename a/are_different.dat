[...] Another critic from The Hindu, B. Kolappan, called the performances of the lead cast [...] "excellent". D. Karthikeyan of The Hindu wrote in December 2009 that Aval Appadithan would [...] "remain etched in every film lover's memory by showing the best of Rajnikanth's acting skills." [...] Director Mrinal Sen remarked, [...] "The film was far ahead of its times." [...] Critics also appreciated the live-recording method of shooting the sequences where Haasan's character, Arun, interviewed women for his documentary.|$|R

Hill put the album up for auction on eBay in November. On December 8, 2006, a winning bid for $155,401 was placed, but not honored. The album was again placed for auction on eBay and was successfully sold on December 16, 2006 for $25,200.|$|E
