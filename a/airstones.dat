25|$|Aquarium heaters {{combine a}} heating element with a thermostat, {{allowing}} the aquarist to regulate water temperature at a level above that of the surrounding air, whereas coolers and chillers (refrigeration devices) are for use anywhere, such as cold water aquaria, where the ambient room temperature is above the desired tank temperature. Thermometers used include glass alcohol thermometers, adhesive external plastic strip thermometers, and battery-powered LCD thermometers. In addition, some aquarists use air pumps attached to <b>airstones</b> or water pumps to increase water circulation and supply adequate gas exchange at the water surface. Wave-making devices have also been constructed to provide wave action.|$|E
50|$|Examples of {{functional}} aquarium furniture would include devices for removing algae {{from the glass}} (either a razor or a scouring pad, attached to the glass by a magnet), <b>airstones,</b> water filters, water heaters, and food dispensers.|$|E
5000|$|An airstone, {{also called}} an {{aquarium}} bubbler, {{is a piece}} of aquarium furniture, traditionally a piece of limewood or porous stone, whose purpose is to gradually diffuse air into the tank, eliminating the noise and large bubbles of conventional air filtration systems, and providing other benefits {{to the health of the}} fish. [...] "Airstone" [...] is also a brand name stone or brick veneer applied by homebuilders. <b>Airstones</b> are sold in a very wide variety of shapes, sizes, and levels of coarseness - from extremely rough, producing larger (though still typically unnoticeable) bubbles and letting in more oxygen - to very fine, producing minuscule bubbles. <b>Airstones</b> are increasingly being made from bonded glass beads and synthetic products like fiberglass.|$|E
50|$|Top-fed {{deep water}} {{culture is a}} {{technique}} involving delivering highly oxygenated nutrient solution direct to the root zone of plants. While deep water culture involves the plant roots hanging down into a reservoir of nutrient solution, in top-fed deep water culture the solution is pumped from the reservoir up to the roots (top feeding). The water is released over the plant's roots and then runs back into the reservoir below in a constantly recirculating system. As with deep water culture, there is an <b>airstone</b> in the reservoir that pumps air into the water via a hose from outside the reservoir. The <b>airstone</b> helps add oxygen to the water. Both the <b>airstone</b> and the water pump run 24 hours a day.|$|R
50|$|Some pH {{controllers}} have an interface for an {{air pump}}. This air pump {{is connected to}} an <b>airstone</b> in the sump or main tank. If the probe detects a low pH level, the pump activates. The bubbles raise the pH by dissipating the CO2 gas.|$|R
50|$|They {{are best}} {{kept in a}} tank long enough for their active swimming, preferably with a current from a power filter (or at least <b>airstone)</b> as they often live in fast-flowing streams in the wild. Generally, this also results in them being {{subtropical}} with temperatures of 20 to 22 C often being fine; they are good jumpers, so a tight-fitting lid is recommended.|$|R
50|$|There is some {{controversy}} {{as to the}} efficiency of <b>airstones</b> versus the conventional powerhead system. Arguments {{can be made in}} favor of both systems, and both possess certain advantages and disadvantages. Among aquarists, the choice is very much a matter of personal preference, quite often discussed in internet forums.|$|E
50|$|A typical {{household}} freshwater aquarium set-up, {{apart from}} its aquatic tenants, consists of furnishings such as a gravel substrate, live or plastic plants, rocks, driftwood, a backcloth or background, and other decorations. Other equipment includes a canopy or hood as an aquarium cover, an aquarium stand or base, lighting accessories, a heater, a thermometer, air pumps, filtration apparatus, <b>airstones,</b> fish food, a fish net, water conditioner, water quality testing kits, a siphon hose or gravel cleaner, and a bucket for water changes.|$|E
5000|$|Less-toxic modern {{imitations of}} bubble lights {{are made from}} acrylic or other clear plastic rods, with {{permanent}} bubbles deliberately manufactured into them, lit with fixed-color or color-changing LEDs. Other bubbling lights are much larger and sit on a table or floor, occasionally with fake fish which [...] "swim" [...] {{up and down as}} they change buoyancy. These tubes are usually filled with distilled water, and have one or more <b>airstones</b> at the bottom, and normally a light, along with an air pump.|$|E
25|$|Sewage liquor is {{run into}} deep tanks with {{diffuser}} grid aeration {{systems that are}} attached to the floor. These are like the diffused <b>airstone</b> used in tropical fish tanks but on a much larger scale. Air is pumped through the blocks and the curtain of bubbles formed both oxygenates the liquor and also provides the necessary mixing action. Where capacity is limited or the sewage is unusually strong or difficult to treat, oxygen may be used instead of air. Typically, the air is generated by some type of blower or compressor.|$|R
5000|$|Early Deep Water Culture (DWC) systems {{consisted}} of a five-gallon bucket, air stone, air pump and net pot with a medium. Five gallon buckets were the favorite of many early adopters of the system as they were readily available at hardware stores. Net pots come in three sizes: 6", 8" [...] and 10". Net pots are then filled with a hydroponic medium such as Hydroton and a Rockwool cube is added in the center that holds {{the base of the}} plant. For Oxygenation of the hydroponic solution, an <b>airstone</b> is added. This air stone is then connected to an airline that runs to an air pump.|$|R
50|$|It is also {{necessary}} to support photosynthesis, by providing light and carbon dioxide. A variety of lighting systems {{may be used to}} produce the full spectrum of light, usually at 2 - 4 watts per gallon (0.5 - 1 watts per litre). Lights are usually controlled by a timer that allows the plants to be acclimated to a set cycle. Depending on the number of plants and fish, the aquascape may also require carbon dioxide supplementation. This can be accomplished with a simple homemade system, using a soda bottle filled with yeast, warm water, and sugar, and connected to an <b>airstone</b> in the aquarium, or with a pressurized CO2 tank that injects a set amount of carbon dioxide into the aquarium water.|$|R

Rates of gas transfer across a water-gas boundary are greater for an oxygen-enriched atmosphere than for air. We compared an enclosed agitator, a pumped spray, and diffusers (<b>airstones)</b> with respect to oxygen absorption efficiency and nitrogen stripping over a range of influent gas (oxygen or air) flow rates.

40|$|The aim of {{environmental}} enrichment is {{to alter the}} environment of a captive animal {{in a way that}} results in improved mental and physical welfare. The technique has been utilised effectively for many years for captive mammals in a variety of settings. However, until now it has never been considered as a way of improving the welfare of aquatic animals such as fish. Fish that are used in regulatory toxicology studies are at present maintained solely in barren tank environments. Little is known about how these types of environments affect the well-being of the animals residing there and whether they impact either physiological heath or behavioural repertoire. This thesis aims to address this gap in the knowledge regarding the potential for environmental enrichment to improve the welfare of fish used in regulatory toxicology. More specifically it looks at two types of enrichment and the effects of these on the commonly used model species, the zebrafish (Danio rerio). The first type of enrichment studied was glass rod structures of varying heights provided to increase tank complexity and provide refuge. The glass structures did not produce any quantifiable benefits in unstressed fish and appeared to delay the formation of stable social hierarchies. When fish were stressed by a period of chasing, the presence of the glass rods appeared to reduce the magnitude of the cortisol response. Whilst this could be viewed as a potential benefit, it was felt that it would not outweigh the costs of this type of enrichment. The second type of enrichment studied was provision of <b>airstones.</b> Again, no clear evidence was found that fish in tanks with <b>airstones</b> experienced an improvement in welfare. The main observation was the vast increase in mortality in tanks containing these <b>airstones,</b> in particular, those of a smaller size. Regardless of the physiological cause underlying this result, this can only be viewed as a negative consequence and one that appears to rule out <b>airstones</b> as an effective form of enrichment for this species and strain of fish. It was also observed that both stress and the presence of enrichment influenced the absolute deviation from the mean in several endpoints. Since changes in endpoint variation will have effects both on the number of animals required to statistically measure environmentally relevant effects this is a factor that should be considered when researching methods {{of environmental}} enrichment. Finally, results from these studies suggest the possibility that laboratory zebrafish do not require the addition of environmental enrichment to tanks in order to promote maximum welfare. Furthermore, as considerable costs would be involved in implementing many types of enrichment (relating to manufacture, cleaning, incompatibility of results with previous studies etc.) it is likely that observed benefits would have to be both substantial and well established in order for changes in regulatory guidelines to take place. For a species such as zebrafish that are extremely easy to breed and maintain in the laboratory with minimal amounts of disease, social problems or mortalities, it may be that current conditions are satisfactory.

The nanostructuredelectrodes incorporate single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) mixedwith the LATP electrolyte. The complete energy storage devices are manufactured ina sandwich structure consisting of two nanostructured electrode layers which are separated by a pure LATP layer. The as-prepared specimens are embedded in composite materials with <b>Airstone</b> 880 / 886 H epoxy resin as matrix. Theirelectrical properties are characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). Atambient temperature, the addition of 6. 5 wt. % SWCNTs results in a distinct improvementby reducingthe total resistance of the embedded devices and enhancesthe capacitance from 0. 025 mFg- 1 to 3. 160 mFg- 1 at a scan rate of 5 mVs- 1.

2500|$|Water {{changes are}} {{a staple of}} good {{saltwater}} maintenance. Larger (approximately [...] ) aquariums are much more stable and water changes may not need to take place if the nitrogen cycle has fully established itself in the tank, although this is a controversial statement among aquarists. [...] Water changes are used to maintain balance of calcium, carbonate alkalinity, and magnesium which are rapidly depleted in a reef aquarium, while also maintaining levels of other trace elements as well as removing toxic solutes which may accumulate from many different sources and cannot be removed by even advanced filtration methods. Supplements are needed (such as calcium) when regular water changes alone {{are not able to}} maintain adequate levels, particularly those of calcium, carbonate, and magnesium. Water changes involve removing a fraction of the total volume of the aquarium, replacing that water with new pre-mixed saltwater. Pre-mixed saltwater has been dechlorinated and/or dechloraminated—typically with an additive such as bisulfite or through filtering. Water should be brought to the same temperature if more than a 5% change is occurring. Salinity should match that of the aquarium, or be dosed very slowly if altering the salinity. Aging and aerating saltwater (such as in a bucket with a powerhead or <b>airstone)</b> is recommended as good practice to allow the pH to stabilize.|$|R
40|$|Litopenaeus vannamei or Pacific white shrimp is {{the most}} widely farmed {{crustacean}} in the world. Shrimp are commonly fed feed containing 30 - 40 % soybean meal or other plant-based feeds that are more economically and environmentally sustainable than animal-based feed. However, plant-based pellets are less palatable and less chemically attractive compared to animal material. Based on that, current research and practice includes the addition of specific marine animal meals {{in order to enhance}} palatability and attractability of plant-based shrimp feed. Yet, it is not sustainable or economically achievable to continue relying on marine animal meal. In the herein study, the effect of proprietary chemical mixtures designed by our research group as feed additives was examined based on their attractability and palatability in comparison to krill meal, a highly attractive and palatable supplement for shrimp feed. In palatability assays, total amount of pellets was measured before and after one-hour and three-hour periods of feeding in group-housed animals. In attractability assays, responses of shrimp were measured {{based on the number of}} probes and grabs on the source (<b>airstone)</b> of the stimulus being released. Each diet-set used contained different concentrations of krill meal and synthetic chemical mixtures. Results demonstrated these chemical mixtures enhance attractability and palatability of soybean based feed in L. vannamei when compared to krill meal. Furthermore, the addition of a proprietary mixture (= “premix”) improved responses in the attractability assays when compared to stimuli that did not contain the premix. Overall, results support the hypothesis that synthetic chemical mixtures can improve palatability and attractability of soybean meal based shrimp feed. This work could provide a reference for the development of synthetic chemoattractants and chemopallatants for the aquaculture of shrimp...|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} use of recirculating {{systems with}} facilities for waste removal for prawn (Penaeus monodon) hatchery and broodstock maturation tanks was investigated. Recirculating systems evaluated for larval culture tanks were biological filtration and zigzag stream sedimentation. Systems using airlift and <b>airstones</b> as aeration devices with partial water change {{but with no}} provision for recirculation served as control. Results showed successful rearing of Penaeus monodon (nauplii-postlarvae) in systems with facilities for wastewater recirculation. Aeration systems became ineffective in maintaining acceptable water quality as shown by increases in 5 -day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5), ammonia (NH 4 -N) and nitrite (NO 2 -N) nitrogen, and decreases in dissolved oxygen (DO). For broodstock maturation, a recirculating system with a preconditioned biological filter was compared with a flow-through system. Biological filtration proved to be useful in meeting water quality requirements. Nitrification was satisfactory with ammonia levels lower than 1 Â· 0 mg liter âˆ’ 1. The pH values in the biofilter effluent were maintained at 7 Â· 8 â€“ 8 Â· 3. BOD 5 levels were below 10 mg liter âˆ’ 1 while DO tended to drop due to the nitrifying activity of the filter. Better reproductive performance of Penaeus monodon broodstock was obtained in the recirculating system than in the flow-through system...|$|E
40|$|Recirculating {{aquaculture}} {{systems have}} a unique anthropogenic-based soundscape which {{is characterized by the}} type of equipment utilized, the structural configuration of walls, tanks, equipment, the substrate the tanks are situated on and even the activities of the personnel operating the facility. The soundscape of recirculation facilities is inadequately understood and remains poorly characterized, although it is generally accepted that the dominant sounds found in such facilities are within the hearing range of fish. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the soundscape in a recirculating aquaculture facility from an intra-tank perspective and determine how the soundscape is shaped by a range of characteristics within the facility. Sounds were recorded across an operating aquaculture facility including different tank designs. The sounds recorded fell within previously measured pressure level ranges for recirculating systems, with the highest maximum sound pressure level (SPL) recorded at 124 dB re 1 mPa 2 /Hz (with an FFT bin width of 46. 9 Hz, centered at 187. 5 Hz). The soundscape within the tanks was stratified and positively correlated with depth, the highest sound pressure occurring at the base of the tanks. Each recording of the soundscape was dominated by a frequency component of 187. 5 Hz (corresponding centre of the 4 th 46. 9 Hz FFT analysis bin) that produced the highest observed SPL. Analysis of sound recordings revealed that this peak SPL was associated with the acoustic signature of the pump. The soundscape was also evaluated for impacts of tank hood position, time of day, transient sounds and <b>airstone</b> particle size types, all of which were found to appreciably influence sound levels and structure within the tank environment. This study further discusses the distinctiveness of the soundscape, how it is shaped by the various operating components and considers the aquaculture soundscape in relation to natural soundscapes found within aquatic tropical environments...|$|R

Hybrid catfish fingerlings of 25 - 26 g size were stocked at 20 fish/m 2, while Nile tilapia fingerlings of 20 - 23 g size were stocked at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 fish/m 2, giving stocking ratios of Nile tilapia to hybrid catfish of 0 : 20, 1 : 20, 2 : 20, 3 : 20, 4 : 20, 5 : 20, and 6 : 20, respectively.

40|$|Although {{environmental}} enrichment {{is known to}} improve laboratory rodent wellbeing and enhance scientific data collection, relatively little is known {{with regards to the}} type of enrichment that might be useful for zebrafish (Danio rerio). Therefore, this study explored if zebrafish displayed preferences for a range of enrichments, including substrates, artificial plants, combinations thereof and <b>airstones.</b> Tanks divided into two compartments containing different enrichment cues were used to determine the preferences of zebrafish housed in pairs and groups of eight. When comparing time spent in enriched versus barren compartments, dominant individuals in a pair displayed a preference for substrate and behaviourally excluded the subordinate (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). In groups there was a preference for all substrate (p[*]<[*] 0. 01) and plant (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) enrichments over barren conditions.
