5|$|Since Darwin's On the Origins of Certain Instincts (quoted above) in 1873, path {{integration}} {{has been}} shown to be important to navigation in animals including ants, rodents and birds. When vision (and hence the use of remembered landmarks) is not available, such as when animals are navigating on <b>a</b> <b>cloudy</b> night, in the open ocean, or in relatively featureless areas such as sandy deserts, path integration must rely on idiothetic cues from within the body.|$|E
5|$|After {{making her}} way to New York, West Gate took on 6,700 tons of cargo that {{included}} locomotives, steel rails, and other materiel for the United States Army and departed in a convoy for France on 28 June. The ship soon developed engine trouble and {{dropped out of the}} convoy to head to St. John's, Newfoundland, for repairs. While headed to St. John's in moderate seas under <b>a</b> <b>cloudy</b> sky, West Gate was attacked by two German submarines at 19:15 on 3 July. One U-boat surfaced in front of the cargo ship, crossing to starboard. As West Gate quickly turned to port to evade the U-boat, a second U-boat surfaced one point to starboard. While West Gates radio operator sent out a preemptive SOS, her gunners opened fire on the two submarines. Though her gunners made hits on neither boat, both were bracketed with fire, quickly submerged, and apparently departed the scene. West Gate arrived at St. John's at 18:00 on 7 July without any further contact with enemy vessels.|$|E
5|$|The Australians {{started the}} match as firm favourites, having won the {{previous}} series against England 30; in the lead-up to the 1948 series, they had won 10 of their 12 tour matches in England, mostly by large margins. This included a crushing innings defeat in a match over the Marylebone Cricket Cluba team consisting {{almost entirely of}} Test-capped and current England players. England captain Norman Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on <b>a</b> <b>cloudy</b> day. After the first morning was interrupted by inclement weather, the Australian fast bowlers quickly made inroads into the English batting. Despite the loss of leading Australian paceman Ray Lindwall with a groin injury, the hosts had difficulty against his colleagues and fell to be 74 runs {{for the loss of}} eight wickets (74/8). However, a rearguard action by tail-enders Alec Bedser and Jim Laker saw England reach 165, Bill Johnston taking five wickets for 36 runs (5/36) for Australia, while compatriot Keith Miller took 3/38. Laker top-scored for the hosts with 63. The tourists then reached 17 without loss by stumps.|$|E

5|$|Two {{music videos}} {{were made for}} the song; the first one for the ballad version, {{and the other for}} the English version. The ballad version was {{directed}} by Felipe Niño. In the video, the group is shown performing the song along with an orchestra behind them. It is filmed on a stage where shows López singing his verses, while the others members of the group, follow up with the chorus. At the end of the video the people of the orchestra starts to applaud when the group ends to sing. In the English version of the video, the plot is completely different. The video starts in <b>a</b> <b>cloudy</b> afternoon after a storm, where the group is situated in a white room. It shows López singing in a ladder when it later starts to fill with water. At {{the last part of the}} video, it shows Son by Four singing out of the house after the storm has ended.|$|E

25|$|The Amrit Dhara Water fall, Koriya is {{a natural}} {{waterfall}} which originates from the Hasdo River. The fall is situated {{at a distance of}} seven kilometres from Koriya. The waterfall is ideally located on the Manendragarh-Baikunthpur road. The Amrit Dhara Waterfall in Koriya in Chhattisgarh in India falls from a height of 27m. The waterfall is about 3–4.5m wide.

25|$|The {{relatively}} flat {{phase curve}} of Venus {{is characteristic of}} <b>a</b> <b>cloudy</b> planet. In contrast to Mercury where the curve is strongly peaked approaching phase angle zero (full phase) that of Venus is rounded. The wide illumination scattering angle of clouds, {{as opposed to the}} narrower scattering of regolith, causes this flattening of the phase curve. Venus exhibits a brightness surge near phase angle 170°, when it is a thin crescent, due to forward scattering of sunlight by droplets of sulfuric acid that are above the planet's cloud tops. Even beyond 170° the brightness does not decline very steeply.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 9,100 Axis troops (of which 66% were Italians), with 100 {{artillery}} pieces but no tanks, attacked 18,000 Allied troops which were equipped with 140 artillery batteries and 120 tanks, {{as well as}} support from 160 P-47 Thunderbolts of the Allied XXII Tactical Air Command. The surprise factor was fundamental in the attack, together with <b>a</b> <b>cloudy</b> winter front that was hoped to prevent the Allied aircraft from flying. XXII TAC P-47s were in the air throughout the day on the 26th, but continued to fly scheduled missions in Northeastern Italy until {{the severity of the}} breakthrough was known. XXII TAC retasked all missions on the 27th to support the Fifth Army front and these were key in dislodging the Axis thrust.|$|E

25|$|There {{are four}} {{important}} layers {{in the dog}} and cat cornea. The outer layer is the epithelium, which is 25 to 40 micrometers and five to seven cell layers thick. The epithelium holds the tear film in place and also prevents water from invading the cornea and disrupting the collagen fibers. This prevents corneal edema, which gives it <b>a</b> <b>cloudy</b> appearance. It is also a barrier to infectious agents. The epithelium sticks to the basement membrane, which also separates the epithelium from the stroma. The corneal stroma comprises 90 percent of {{the thickness of the}} cornea. It contains the collagen fibers organized into lamellae. The lamellae are in sheets which separate easily. Posterior to the stroma is Descemet's membrane, which is a basement membrane for the corneal endothelium. The endothelium is a single cell layer that separates the cornea from the aqueous humor.|$|E
25|$|Miller {{began the}} Winter Olympics by winning {{two out of}} three {{training}} sessions before the downhill. However, as sunny conditions of the training days changed into <b>a</b> <b>cloudy</b> race day, {{he was not able to}} keep up the momentum and finished in eighth position. He was then unable to defend his title from the previous Olympic Games as he finished sixth in the super combined event. On February 16, 2014, Miller became the oldest Olympic medalist in alpine skiing history, by winning a bronze medal in the super-G race. He shared a third place podium with Jan Hudec of Canada. By collecting his sixth Olympic medal, Miller moved to the second position on the all-time list of Olympic male medalists in alpine skiing, only behind Kjetil André Aamodt who won eight medals. In his last race of the Olympics, Miller finished 20th in the giant slalom, won by U.S. teammate Ligety.|$|E
25|$|By 1999, the 75-year-old stadium {{was showing}} its age. Except for the turf and {{lighting}} enhancements, no substantial upgrade {{of the stadium}} had occurred since the press box was built 25 years earlier, in 1975. The OU College of Architecture was housed under the west stands and in the north end zone, until other facilities became available in 1990. The artificial turf on Owen Field had literally become threadbare before its replacement in 1981; {{it is possible that}} the poor condition of the Superturf, prior to its 1994 replacement, contributed to a crash of the Sooner Schooner during a 1993 game against Colorado. The east side of the stadium still had the original dirt flooring underneath the stands, making for <b>a</b> <b>cloudy,</b> dusty walk into the student and visitor seating sections. Restrooms were old and inadequate; paint was peeling off external walls and the areas under the stands (the east side in particular) were dark and smelled like dust.|$|E

25|$|About {{two weeks}} after the Epsom, Lord Clifden {{travelled}} to France for the Grand Prix de Paris at Longchamp, which was run over 3,000 metres and worth 100,000 francs. It was <b>a</b> <b>cloudy</b> day in Paris and there was a large crowd, including the Emperor and Empress, King Fernando of Portugal and the Prince of Orange. La Toucques, who had won the Oaks and Derby at Chantilly, was the 2/1 favourite, with Lord Clifden starting as the second favourite at 7/2. Unlike in the Derby, the horses got away to a good start on the first attempt. Lord Clifden was settled {{at the rear of the}} field by jockey Tom Chaloner. Both La Toucques and Lord Clifden made progress though the pack together and when the field turned into the finishing straight the pair were vying for the lead along with The Ranger and Saccharometer. However, Lord Clifden was the first one to fade and the finish was fought out between La Toucques and The Ranger. The Ranger won the race by one length from La Toucques, who was two lengths in front of Saccharometer. Lord Clifden finished in fifth place, seven lengths behind the winner.|$|E
25|$|The Crab Nebula {{was first}} {{identified}} in 1731 by John Bevis. The nebula was independently rediscovered in 1758 by Charles Messier {{as he was}} observing a bright comet. Messier catalogued it as the first entry in his catalogue of comet-like objects; in 1757, Alexis Clairaut reexamined the calculations of Edmund Halley and predicted the return of Halley's Comet in late 1758. The exact time of the comet's return required the consideration of perturbations to its orbit caused by planets in the Solar System such as Jupiter, which Clairaut and his two colleagues Jérôme Lalande and Nicole-Reine Lepaute carried out more precisely than Halley, finding that the comet should appear in the constellation of Taurus. It is in searching in vain for the comet that Charles Messier found the Crab nebula, which he at first thought to be Halley's comet. After some observation, noticing that the object that he was observing was not moving across the sky, Messier concluded that the object was not a comet. Messier then realised the usefulness of compiling a catalogue of celestial objects of <b>a</b> <b>cloudy</b> nature, but fixed in the sky, to avoid incorrectly cataloguing them as comets.|$|E
25|$|Malaita's {{climate is}} {{extremely}} wet. It {{is located in}} the Intertropical Convergence Zone ("Doldrums"), with its fickle weather patterns. The sun is at zenith over Malaita, and thus the effect is most pronounced, in November and February. Trade winds come during the southern hemisphere's winter, and from about April to August they blow from the southeast fairly steadily. During the summer, fringes of monsoon blow over the island. Because of the surrounding sea, air temperatures are fairly consistent, with a difference between daily highs and lows averaging to 13.6°F However, across the year, the difference is much less; the mean daily temperature in the warmest month is only 3.4°F warmer than that of the coolest. Rainfall is heavy and there is constant high humidity. The most common daily pattern follows an adiabatic process, with a calm, clear morning, followed by a breeze blowing in from higher pressures over the sea, culminating in <b>a</b> <b>cloudy</b> and drizzly afternoon. At night, the weather pattern reverses, and drizzle and heavy dew dissipate the cloud cover for the morning. Tropical cyclones are the only violent weather, but they can be destructive.|$|E
