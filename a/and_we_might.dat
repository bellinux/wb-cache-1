Moreover, while there are no segregation laws in the North, there is segregation in fact <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> as well recognize this.|$|E
25|$|A {{voyage to}} explore {{the east coast of}} New Holland, with a view to a British {{colonization}} of the country, had been recommended in John Campbell’s editions of John Harris's Navigantium atque Itinerantium Bibliotheca, or Voyages and Travels (1744–1748, and 1764), a book which Cook had with him on the Endeavour: The first Point, with respect to a Discovery, would be, to send a small Squadron on the Coast of Van Diemen's Land, and from thence round, in the same course taken by Captain Tasman, by the Coast of New Guiney; which might enable the Nations that attempted it, to come to an absolute Certainty with regard to its Commodities and Commerce... By this means all the back Coast of New Holland, and New Guiney, might be roughly examined; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> know as well, and as certainly, as the Dutch, how far a Colony settled there might answer our Expectations.|$|E

[...] Again, he broadens the discussion and argues against the view of Dr. Johnson [...] "that Shakespear was generally inattentive to the winding-up of his plots. We think the contrary is true; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> cite in proof of this remark not only the present play, but the conclusion of Lear, of Romeo and Juliet, of Macbeth, of Othello, even of Hamlet, and of other plays of less moment, in which the last act is crowded with decisive events brought about by natural means." ...|$|E

500|$|Not all reviews were positive. David Hinkley of The New York Daily News {{rated the}} pilot {{three out of}} five stars, stating [...] "The story and the {{chemistry}} work, but periodically the action feels rushed, as if {{we all know the}} drill <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> as well get it over with. Future episodes may correct that, because they'll need less setup work." [...] Brian Lowry of Variety stated [...] "On paper, [...] "Hawaii Five-0" [...] appears destined for can't-miss success, offering a pre-sold name, an attractive cast and a stunning location," [...] but felt the millions spent on the pilot [...] "doesn't necessarily indicate smooth sailing, relying as it does on playful banter (more like frat-boy hazing) between the leads that grows tiresome even before the hour's over." [...] Ellen Gray of the Philadelphia Daily News felt it was [...] "a huge let down," [...] and was critical of the cast's performance, in particular O'Loughlin and Caan.|$|E

2500|$|The bill {{divided and}} engendered a {{long-term}} {{change in the}} demographic support of both parties. President Johnson realized that supporting this bill would risk losing the South's overwhelming support of the Democratic Party. Both Attorney General Robert Kennedy and Vice President Johnson had pushed for {{the introduction of the}} civil rights legislation. Johnson told Kennedy aide Ted Sorensen that [...] "I know the risks are great <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> lose the South, but those sorts of states may be lost anyway." [...] Senator Richard Russell, Jr. later warned President Johnson that his strong support for the civil rights bill [...] "will not only cost you the South, it will cost you the election". Johnson, however, {{went on to win the}} 1964 election by one of the biggest landslides in American history. The South, which had five states swing Republican in 1964, became a stronghold of the Republican Party by the 1990s.|$|E

Sun Quan wanted to construct a dock at Ruxu, but his subordinates said, [...] "We should land {{on the other side}} of the river and attack the enemy, then return to our ships. Why build a dock?" [...] However, Lü Meng supported the idea of building a dock, as he said, [...] "Battles are unpredictable <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> not always win. If we lose and the enemy closes in, and we don't have time to retreat to the riverbank, how can we even board our ships?" [...] Sun Quan agreed with Lü Meng and had the dock constructed to make boardings and landings more convenient. With this, Sun Quan's army defended their positions against Cao Cao's approaching forces, who retreated after several failed attempts to overcome the enemy.|$|E
2500|$|Ice Cube {{released}} his third album, The Predator, in November 1992. Referring specifically to that year's Los Angeles riots, {{in the first}} single, [...] "Wicked", he rapped [...] "April 29 was power to the people, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> just see a sequel". The Predator debuted at number one on both the pop and R charts, the first album in history to do so. Singles from The Predator included [...] "It Was a Good Day" [...] and [...] "Check Yo Self", and the songs had a two-part music video. The album was generally well received by critics and remains his most successful release commercially, with over three million copies sold in the US. However, after The Predator, Ice Cube's rap audience diminished. Cube's fourth album Lethal Injection, which was released {{at the end of}} 1993 and represented Ice Cube's first attempt at imitating the G-Funk sound of Dr. Dre's The Chronic, was not well received by critics. He had more successful hits from Lethal Injection, including [...] "Really Doe", [...] "Bop Gun (One Nation)", [...] "You Know How We Do It" [...] & [...] "What Can I Do?". After 1994, he took a hiatus from music and concentrated on film work and developing the careers of other rap musicians, Mack 10, Mr. Short Khop, Kausion, and Da Lench Mob.|$|E
2500|$|In June, the Anchorage Daily News {{reported}} that {{a federal grand jury}} in Washington, D.C., heard evidence in May about the expansion of Stevens's Girdwood home and other matters connecting Stevens to VECO. [...] In mid-June, FBI agents questioned several aides who work for Stevens as part of the investigation. In July, Washingtonian magazine {{reported that}} Stevens had hired [...] "Washington's most powerful and expensive lawyer", Brendan Sullivan Jr., in response to the investigation. In 2006, during wiretapped conversations with Bill Allen, shortly after the VECO offices were searched and Allen agreed to cooperate with the investigation, Stevens expressed worries over legal complications arising from the sweeping federal investigations into Alaskan politics. [...] "The worst that can happen to us is we run up a bunch of legal fees, and might lose <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> have to pay a fine, might have to serve a little time in jail. I hope to Christ it never gets to that, and I don't think it will," [...] Stevens said. On the witness stand, [...] "Allen testified that VECO staff who had worked on his own house had charged 'way too much,' leaving him uncertain how much to invoice Stevens for when he had his staff work on the senator's house ... that he would be embarrassed to bill Stevens for overpriced labor on the house, and said he concealed some of the expense." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the Third Test the MCC team toured Tasmania and Clif Cary of the Sunday Express {{wrote that}} [...] "Social successes {{are one of}} the causes of their cricket failure...There are {{tourists}} who do not give the impression that cricket is their main consideration". This was thought to be aimed at Denis Compton and one Australian Test cricketer told Cary [...] "It will make Compton and others will pull up their socks, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> never get them out at Adelaide." [...] There were also calls for Wally Hammond to resign the captaincy in favour of Norman Yardley, but these were silenced when he made 188 against South Australia, his 167th - and last - first class century. He became the seventh man to make 50,000 first class runs after W.G. Grace, Jack Hobbs, Phil Mead, Frank Woolley, Patsy Hendren and Herbert Sutcliffe and [...] "for some time afterwards he was kept busy answering congratulatory letters, telegrams, and cables from admirers {{in all parts of the}} world". The Adelaide Oval had been [...] "Bradman's Front Lawn" [...] since he had moved to South Australia in 1935 and [...] "if ever a Test wicket was laid down to kill it was that 22 yards long graveyard of a spin bowler's hope. It was as dead and lifeless as Mussolini and at the end of the sixth, and final day, was playing as truly as when the match began". Bill Voce was dropped in favour of the batsman Joe Hardstaff, so England went into the match with only two specialist bowlers - Alec Bedser and Doug Wright. Sid Barnes was ill and was replaced by the Victorian strokemaker Merv Harvey who was promoted into the opening slot. The Test was played in [...] "stifling, almost insufferable heat" [...] with temperatures rising up to 105°F (40.5°C) and a brief shower only served to help bind the wicket when it might have started to break. Hammond won the toss and chose to bat.|$|E
