40|$|The author {{explored}} {{the meaning of}} <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> community according to a purposeful sample of 60 <b>Black</b> adults in <b>the</b> mid-Atlantic United States. Purposeful stratified sampling resulted in equal numbers of participants {{along the lines of}} locale (Brooklyn, New York; Wilmington, Delaware; and Washington, D. C.), gender, and generational affiliation (older adults, middle-aged adults, and young adults). Content analysis of responses to a single open-ended survey question resulted in 11 emergent themes around the meaning of <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> community: <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> community <b>as</b> cultural, <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> community <b>as</b> residential, <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> community <b>as</b> global, <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> community <b>as</b> supportive, <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> community <b>as</b> visibly distinctive, <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> community <b>as</b> socioeconomic, <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> community <b>as</b> nonactualized, <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> community <b>as</b> nondifferential, <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> community <b>as</b> nihilistic, <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> community <b>as</b> nondefinable, and <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> community <b>as</b> other. Gender and generational variations in thematic endorsement were analyzed, and implications of these findings as they pertain to research, mental health programs, and policies for Blacks are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Between 56,000 and 32,000 {{years ago}} {{explosive}} volcanic activity occurred at Ciomadul. Both the exact dates {{of the various}} eruptions and {{of the formation of}} the St. Ana and Mohos craters are unclear, partly because dates obtained by potassium-argon dating and other dating techniques deviate from each other. Some eruptions may have reached sub-Plinian strength, ejecting volcanic ash as far <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Sea.|$|E

Local efforts by the Coastal Bend Bays and Estuaries program have benefited bird populations by adding crushed oyster shells to the bay's small islands for improved nesting conditions, and the restoration of marsh near the Nueces Bay Causeway to increase fish populations to satisfy the birds' dietary requirements. At the nearby Nueces Delta Preserve, countless birds have been observed, as well as bobcats, coyotes, feral hogs, mountain lions, rattlesnakes, Texas spiny lizards, western diamondbacks and white-tailed deer.|$|E
5|$|According {{to popular}} tradition, Sir Ralph de Assheton, who was {{lord of the}} manor in the mid-14thcentury and known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Knight, was an unpopular and cruel feudal lord.

The first {{recorded}} occurrence of the event was in 1795, although the tradition may be older; it continued into the 1830s.|$|E

He writes that the film's theme of an oppressed, financially destitute youth {{who is able to}} control his destiny by becoming a masked vigilante, allowed viewers {{to be able to see}} themselves <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Wolf, and thus take revenge against those who had wronged them.|$|E
