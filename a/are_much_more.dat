5|$|By {{using these}} speech organs, humans can produce {{hundreds}} of distinct sounds: some appear very {{often in the}} world's languages, whereas others <b>are</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> common in certain language families, language areas, or even specific to a single language.|$|E
5|$|In {{a passive}} ALF, the input {{frequency}} must correspond almost exactly {{to the natural}} absorption lines of the vapor cell. Active ARFs <b>are</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> flexible, however, as the vapor may be stimulated {{so that it will}} absorb other frequencies of light.|$|E
5|$|All have paddle-like {{tails and}} many have {{laterally}} compressed bodies that give them an eel-like appearance. Unlike fish, {{they do not have}} gills and must surface regularly to breathe. Along with whales, they are among the most completely aquatic of all air-breathing vertebrates. Among this group are species {{with some of the most}} potent venoms of all snakes. Some have gentle dispositions and bite only when provoked, but others <b>are</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> aggressive. Currently, 17genera are described as sea snakes, comprising 62 species.|$|E

50|$|Since cows {{were the}} {{backbone}} of farming then, used both for their milk and plowing, cows <b>were</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> valuable than hogs. Slaughtering hogs for feasts and special occasions <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> common than slaughtering cows, which helps explain the dish's pork origins.|$|R
5|$|Although no {{linguists}} {{claim that}} panlectal grammars have psychological validity, and polylectal diasystems <b>are</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> {{likely to be}} cognitively real for bilingual and bidialectal speakers, speakers of only one dialect or language may still {{be aware of the}} differences between their own speech and that of other varieties.|$|E
5|$|Compared to {{the earlier}} Sri Lankan fossils, the island's fossil records from around 40,000 BP onwards <b>are</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> complete. Excavated fossils of {{skeletal}} and cultural remains from this period provide the earliest records of anatomically modern Homo sapiens in South Asia, {{and some of the}} earliest evidence for the use of a specific type of stone tool.|$|E
5|$|Earth-based {{observations}} {{announced in}} 2005 appeared {{to show that}} Neptune's rings <b>are</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> unstable than previously thought. Images taken from the W. M. Keck Observatory in 2002 and 2003 show considerable decay in the rings when compared to images by Voyager 2. In particular, {{it seems that the}} Liberté arc might disappear in as little as one century.|$|E

5|$|Empty shoe polish bottles {{can be used}} {{to create}} graffiti, by dumping out the polish inside and filling it full of ink or paint. They are used as a cheap {{alternative}} to markers designed for graffiti, and <b>are</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> widely available. Kiwi polish was also used heavily by the U.S. Military.|$|E
5|$|Hyperpolarized xenon {{can be used}} {{by surface}} chemists. Normally, it is {{difficult}} to characterize surfaces with NMR because signals from a surface are overwhelmed by signals from the atomic nuclei in the bulk of the sample, which <b>are</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> numerous than surface nuclei. However, nuclear spins on solid surfaces can be selectively polarized by transferring spin polarization to them from hyperpolarized xenon gas. This makes the surface signals strong enough to measure and distinguish from bulk signals.|$|E
5|$|It {{is thought}} that, during the Solar System's formation, Mars was created {{as the result}} of a {{stochastic}} process of run-away accretion of material from the protoplanetary disk that orbited the Sun. Mars has many distinctive chemical features caused by its position in the Solar System. Elements with comparatively low boiling points, such as chlorine, phosphorus, and sulphur, <b>are</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> common on Mars than Earth; these elements were probably pushed outward by the young Sun's energetic solar wind.|$|E

5|$|Once {{they have}} {{collected}} nectar and pollen, female workers {{return to the}} nest and deposit the harvest into brood cells, or into wax cells for storage. Unlike honeybees, bumblebees only store a few days' worth of food, so <b>are</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> vulnerable to food shortages. Male bumblebees collect only nectar and do so to feed themselves. They may visit quite different flowers from the workers because of their different nutritional needs.|$|E
5|$|Ordinary {{supernova}} explosions {{can have}} the same effects as GRBs on Earth's atmosphere if they are close enough. Locally, supernovas <b>are</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> frequent events than GRBs, with a possibility of occurring closer to Earth. In the field of astrobiology, the rate and distribution of supernovas are used to define {{what is known as}} the Galactic Habitable Zone.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{training}} goals {{pursued in}} conjunction with aikido include controlled relaxation, correct movement of joints such as hips and shoulders, flexibility, and endurance, with less emphasis on strength training. In aikido, pushing or extending movements <b>are</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> common than pulling or contracting movements. This distinction {{can be applied to}} general fitness goals for the aikido practitioner.|$|E
50|$|UTF-1 never gained serious acceptance. UTF-8 <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> {{frequently}} used.|$|R
5000|$|In 1979, Isagani Cruz of TV Times commented about Atsay and Rubia Servios. He states: [...] "Rubia Servios is Lino Brocka's film; Atsay is Eddie Garcia's. Nora does an {{excellent}} acting job; but so does Vilma Santos, and Rubia <b>is</b> a <b>much</b> <b>more</b> demanding and difficult role. Edgardo M. Reyes is an established literary figure, but Mario O'Hara <b>is</b> <b>much</b> better screenwriter. Overall, Atsay may <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> impressive than Rubia Servios. In terms of challenging our moral and legal convictions, however, Rubia Servios <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> significant." ...|$|R
50|$|Mathis's {{support among}} the union's {{leadership}} was never strong. Mathis <b>was</b> considered <b>much</b> <b>more</b> liberal Presser or {{the rest of the}} Teamsters' leadership at the time, and he <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> in favor of participating fully in AFL-CIO.|$|R
5|$|Skopje coach station {{opened in}} 2005 and is built {{right under the}} main railway station. It can host 450 coaches in a day. Coach {{connections}} to and from Skopje <b>are</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> efficient and diverse than train connections. Indeed, it is regularly linked to many Macedonian localities and foreign cities including Istanbul, Sofia, Prague, Hamburg and Stockholm.|$|E
5|$|Surviving {{sources for}} Medieval Scotland <b>are</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> limited than for {{contemporaneous}} England. The only burgh {{for which there}} are sources pre-dating 1400 is Aberdeen. The only large body of sources to survive from before 1400 are the cartularies of monasteries. For education, outside of occasional references in documents concerned with other matters, they amount {{to a handful of}} burgh records and monastic and episcopal registers.|$|E
5|$|The {{first few}} (1–3 in Ayt Ayache and Ayt Ndhir) {{cardinal}} numerals have native Berber and borrowed Arabic forms. All higher cardinals are borrowed from Arabic, {{consistent with the}} linguistic universals that the numbers 1–3 <b>are</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> likely to be retained, and that a borrowed number generally implies that numbers greater than it are also borrowed. The retention of one is also motivated {{by the fact that}} Berber languages near-universally use unity as a determiner.|$|E

5|$|The role of stay-at-home dad may be {{difficult}} for men who feel as though they had no option. It is hard for these men to adapt from being a financial provider in the family to being a homemaker. Men who willingly choose to become a stay-at-home dad <b>are</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> satisfied with their role in the family.|$|E
5|$|This {{island is}} {{unlikely}} to disappear entirely in the near future. The eroded area consisted mostly of loose tephra, easily washed away. Most of the remaining area is capped by hard lava flows, which <b>are</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> resistant to erosion. In addition, complex chemical reactions within the loose tephra within the island have gradually formed highly erosion resistant tuff material, in {{a process known as}} palagonitization. On Surtsey this process has happened quite rapidly, due to high temperatures not far below the surface.|$|E
5|$|While other bats {{have almost}} {{lost the ability}} to {{maneuver}} on land, vampire bats can walk, jump, and even run by using a unique, bounding gait, in which the forelimbs instead of the hindlimbs are recruited for force production, as the wings <b>are</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> powerful than the legs. This ability to run seems to have evolved independently within the bat lineage.|$|E
