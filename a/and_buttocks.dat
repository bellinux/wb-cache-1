5|$|Taken together, the {{injuries}} {{appear to be}} a combination of battle wounds, which were the cause of death, followed by post-mortem humiliation wounds inflicted on the corpse. The body wounds show that the corpse had been stripped of its armour, as the stabbed torso would have been protected by a backplate and the pelvis would have been protected by armour. The wounds were made from behind on the back <b>and</b> <b>buttocks</b> while they were exposed to the elements, consistent with the contemporary descriptions of Richard's naked body being tied across a horse with the legs and arms dangling down on either side. There may have been further flesh wounds not apparent from the bones.|$|E
5|$|Though Shiva {{is often}} {{described}} as a naked ascetic Yogi, iconographically he is rarely portrayed as nude except in his form as Bhikshatana. Often the seductive nature of the naked Bhikshatana is emphasised in his torso <b>and</b> <b>buttocks.</b> Though his manhood is fully visible, Bhikshatana is never displayed as ithyphallic in South Indian iconography. In contrast to textual descriptions, Orissan images of Bhikshatana depict him clothed with tiger skin and other body ornaments, but displaying an erect phallus. He is two-armed, holding the begging bowl kapala in his left hand and the trishula (trident) in his right hand.|$|E
5|$|On October 8, 2008, the Steelers {{played the}} Jacksonville Jaguars at Jacksonville Municipal Stadium. At {{that point of}} their season, the Jaguars were 2-2-0, and feeling very hopeful for the season {{following}} a defeat at home of their division rival Indianapolis Colts. The game was very close going into the second half, and the Steelers were still stinging from a Mathis interception and runback for a touchdown. Shortly {{after the start of}} the third quarter, Jaguars mascot Jaxson de Ville stood alongside some cheerleaders, and produced a Terrible Towel, which he used to rub his armpits <b>and</b> <b>buttocks.</b> Shortly after that, the Steelers ran away with the game and the Jaguars lost 26-21. The Jaguars went on to lose eight of their remaining eleven games in the season.|$|E
25|$|Piriformis {{syndrome}} is often left undiagnosed and mistaken with other pains due to similar symptoms with back pain, quadriceps pain, lower leg pain, <b>and</b> <b>buttock</b> pain. These symptoms include tenderness, tingling and numbness initiating in lower back <b>and</b> <b>buttock</b> area <b>and</b> then radiating {{down to the}} thigh and to the leg.|$|R

25|$|Atopic {{dermatitis}} is {{an allergic}} disease {{believed to have}} a hereditary component and often runs in families whose members have asthma. Itchy rash is particularly noticeable on head and scalp, neck, inside of elbows, behind knees, <b>and</b> <b>buttocks.</b> It is very common in developed countries, and rising. Irritant contact dermatitis is sometimes misdiagnosed as atopic dermatitis.|$|E
25|$|Tetanus often {{begins with}} mild spasms {{in the jaw}} muscles—also known as lockjaw or trismus. The spasms can also affect the facial muscles {{resulting}} in an appearance called risus sardonicus. Chest, neck, back, abdominal muscles, <b>and</b> <b>buttocks</b> may be affected. Back muscle spasms often cause arching, called opisthotonos. Sometimes the spasms affect muscles that help with breathing, {{which can lead to}} breathing problems.|$|E

25|$|The figurine {{is roughly}} biconical. Typical of other venus figures, the {{feminine}} features are overemphasized: the thighs and hips are large while the belly, breasts <b>and</b> <b>buttocks</b> are protruding. The head is a cone, the arms are barely sketched, {{and there are}} no hands, feet, or shoulders at all. The back is concave. In some points a few traces of red ochre paint are still visible.|$|E
25|$|Other {{areas of}} the skin are similarly, though {{slightly}} less, sensitive to androgens and androgenic hair typically appears somewhat later. In rough sequence of sensitivity to androgens and appearance of androgenic hair, are the armpits (axillae), perianal area, upper lip, preauricular areas (sideburns), periareolar areas (nipples), middle of the chest, neck under the chin, remainder of chest and beard area, limbs and shoulders, back, <b>and</b> <b>buttocks.</b>|$|E
25|$|Kong's torso was {{streamlined}} {{to eliminate}} the comical appearance {{of the real world}} gorilla's prominent belly <b>and</b> <b>buttocks.</b> His lips, eyebrows, and nose were fashioned of rubber, his eyes of glass, and his facial expressions controlled by thin, bendable wires threaded through holes drilled in his aluminum skull. During filming, Kong's rubber skin dried out quickly under studio lights, making it necessary to replace it often and completely rebuild his facial features.|$|E

40|$|This study {{looked at}} the {{contribution}} of breast size <b>and</b> <b>buttock</b> size on ratings of female physical attractiveness in profile. A total of 114 British undergraduates rated 9 silhouettes with 3 varying levels of breast size and 3 levels of buttock size. Results showed significant main effects of breast size (with an overall preference for small breasts) but not of buttock size. Gender of the participants {{did not have a}} significant effect on the variables, although there was a significant interaction of breast <b>and</b> <b>buttock</b> size. The findings suggest that variables such as breast size are minor cues of female physical attractiveness...|$|R
2500|$|Keratosis lichenoides chronica (also {{known as}} [...] "Nekam's disease") {{is a rare}} {{dermatosis}} characterized by violaceous papular and nodular lesions, often arranged in a linear or reticulate pattern on the dorsal hands and feet, extremities, <b>and</b> <b>buttock,</b> <b>and</b> some cases manifest by sorrheic dermatitis-like eruption on the scalp and face; also palmo plantar keratosis has been reported.|$|R
25|$|The {{distribution}} of adipose (fat) tissue changes slowly over months and years. HRT causes {{the body to}} accumulate new fat in a typically feminine pattern, including in the hips, thighs, buttocks, pubis, upper arms, and breasts. (Fat on the hips, thighs, <b>and</b> <b>buttocks</b> has a higher concentration of omega-3 fatty acids and {{is meant to be}} used for lactation.) The body begins to burn old adipose tissue in the waist, shoulders, and back, making those areas smaller.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{remaining}} nonvisceral fat is found just below the skin in a region called the hypodermis. This subcutaneous fat {{is not related to}} many of the classic obesity-related pathologies, such as heart disease, cancer, and stroke, and some evidence even suggests it might be protective. The typically female (or gynecoid) pattern of body fat distribution around the hips, thighs, <b>and</b> <b>buttocks</b> is subcutaneous fat, and therefore poses less of a health risk compared to visceral fat.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of secondary sex characteristics in women {{is driven by}} estrogens, to be specific, estradiol. These changes are initiated {{at the time of}} puberty, most are enhanced during the reproductive years, and become less pronounced with declining estradiol support after menopause. Thus, estradiol produces breast development, and is responsible for changes in the body shape, affecting bones, joints, and fat deposition. In females, estradiol induces breast development, widening of the hips, a feminine fat distribution (with fat deposited particularly in the breasts, hips, thighs, <b>and</b> <b>buttocks),</b> and maturation of the vagina and vulva, whereas it mediates the pubertal growth spurt (indirectly via increased growth hormone secretion) and epiphyseal closure (thereby limiting final height) in both sexes.|$|E

25|$|Throughout her career, Saint Phalle was outspoken in {{addressing}} important {{political and cultural}} issues of the time. Her Tirs series and assemblages reflected {{the violence of the}} early 1960s Algerian War for independence from France, and asserted her rebellion as part of second-wave feminism. Her enormous, curvaceous Nanas celebrated the fecund female form, featuring large breasts <b>and</b> <b>buttocks,</b> splayed limbs, joyous dance postures, and often, black skin. She was one of the earliest artistic champions of AIDS awareness, creating artworks and a widely-distributed book. Shortly before her death, she exhibited drawings critical of the George W Bush administration. In addition to her artworks, she wrote extensively in both French and in English, and granted numerous interviews; much of this material is collected in her archives.|$|E
25|$|Mythological {{scenes are}} {{frequently}} depicted, especially Heracles and figures {{relating to the}} Trojan War. But the imagery on Corinthian vases does not have as wide a thematic range as do later works by Attic painters. Gods are seldom depicted, Dionysus never. But the Theban Cycle was more popular in Corinth than later in Athens. Primarily fights, horsemen and banquets were the most common scenes of daily life, the latter appearing {{for the first time}} during the early Corinthian period. Sport scenes are rare. Scenes with fat-bellied dancers are unique and their meaning is disputed up to the present time. These are drinkers whose bellies <b>and</b> <b>buttocks</b> are padded with pillows and they may represent an early form of Greek comedy.|$|E
25|$|In early 1969, Bonin {{was arrested}} as he {{attempted}} to restrain a 16-year-old youth whom he had lured into his vehicle; he was indicted on five counts of kidnapping, four counts of sodomy, one count of oral copulation, and one count of child molestation against the five youths he had abducted and assaulted or—in {{the case of the}} final youth he had abducted—attempted to assault since the previous November. Bonin pleaded guilty to molestation and forced oral copulation and was sentenced to the Atascadero State Hospital as a mentally disordered sexual offender considered amenable to treatment in January 1971. While detained at this hospital, Bonin was subjected to a battery of psychiatric examinations: these examinations revealed that Bonin possessed a higher than average IQ of 121, and displayed traits of manic depression in addition to damage to the prefrontal cortex of his brain—which would likely reduce his ability to restrain any violent impulses; his physical examinations also revealed extensive scars on his head <b>and</b> <b>buttocks,</b> which he had likely sustained in the three years he had been housed at the Connecticut juvenile detention center as a child, although Bonin claimed to have no memory of any such incidents of abuse.|$|E
