5|$|On 21 June 1908 500,000 activists rallied in Hyde Park {{to demand}} votes for women; Asquith and leading MPs responded with indifference. Angered by this intransigence and abusive police activity, some WSPU members {{increased}} {{the severity of}} their actions. Soon after the rally, twelve women gathered in Parliament Square and tried to deliver speeches for women's suffrage. Police officers seized several of the speakers and pushed them into a crowd of opponents who had gathered nearby. Frustrated, two WSPU members – Edith New and Mary Leigh – went to 10 Downing Street and hurled rocks <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> of the Prime Minister's home. They insisted their act was independent of WSPU command, but Pankhurst expressed her approval of the action. When a magistrate sentenced New and Leigh to two months' imprisonment, Pankhurst reminded the court of how various male political agitators had broken windows to win legal and civil rights throughout Britain's history.|$|E
5|$|The {{collision}} {{occurred at}} 8:45am. While {{the damage to}} Mont Blanc was not severe, it toppled barrels that broke open and flooded the deck with benzol that quickly flowed into the hold. As Imos engines kicked in, she quickly disengaged, which created sparks inside Mont-Blancs hull. These ignited the vapours from the benzol. A fire started at the water line and travelled quickly {{up the side of}} the ship as the benzol spewed out from crushed drums on Mont-Blancs decks. The fire quickly became uncontrollable. Surrounded by thick black smoke, and fearing she would explode almost immediately, the captain ordered the crew to abandon ship. A growing number of Halifax citizens gathered on the street or stood <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> of their homes or businesses to watch the spectacular fire. The frantic crew of Mont-Blanc shouted from their two lifeboats to some of the other vessels that their ship was about to explode, but they could not be heard above the noise and confusion. As the lifeboats made their way across the harbour to the Dartmouth shore, the abandoned ship continued to drift and beached herself at Pier 6 near the foot of Richmond street.|$|E
5|$|The first {{room from}} the {{corridor}} was the living room, with a wainscot, pilasters, cornice, and door and window frames all of Spanish cedar, and a mantelpiece imported from an Italian chateau. Walls are paneled in green silk, mirroring the rug and furnishings. In its early history, the walls were inlaid with embossed Italian leather. The drawing room, {{sometimes referred to as}} the music room, salon, or parlor was at the center, with paneled walls in ivory white and gold, with gilded moldings and ornaments. There are richly interlaced panels above the doorways with paintings inserted in them. The mantle dates to around 1700, and is of mottled purple and white marble, and has a built-in mirror above it. The room has richly gilt chandeliers hanging from ornamental reliefs in the otherwise plain ceiling. Furniture was of tapestry and gold, with a light rug and yellow and gold curtains <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> and doors.|$|E

5|$|The {{south tower}} forms an unequal {{pentagon}} in shape, and has three storeys with thick walls. The walls were built {{to contain the}} stairs and garderobes, the unevenly positioned empty spaces weakening the structure, and this meant that two large buttresses had {{to be added to}} the tower during its construction to support the walls. The current floors are Victorian in origin, having been built after the fire of 1830, but the tower remains unglazed, as in the 13th century, with shutters <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> providing protection in winter. The basement was originally only accessible from the first floor, and would have provided a secure area for storage, in addition to also containing a well. The first floor, which formed the original entrance to the tower, contains a 17th-century fireplace, reusing the original 13th-century chimney. The second floor has been subdivided in the past, but has been restored to form a single chamber, as it would have been when first built.|$|E

The soldiers claimed Donaghy was holding a black cylindrical object, but the Saville Inquiry concluded that all of those shot were unarmed.|$|E

25|$|On March 30, 2005, {{the novel}} Windows on the World, by Frédéric Beigbeder, was released. The novel focuses on two brothers, aged 7 and 9 years, {{who are in}} the {{restaurant}} with their dad Carthew Yorsten. The novel starts at 8:29 AM (just before the plane hits the tower) and tells about every event on every following minute, ending at 10:30 AM, just after the collapse. Published in 2012, Kenneth Womack's novel The Restaurant at the End of the World offers a fictive recreation of the lives of the staff and visitors <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Windows</b> on the World complex on the morning of September 11.|$|E
25|$|The {{release date}} in the United Kingdom, {{originally}} slated for 12 August and {{two days after the}} rest of Europe, was later pushed up to 10 August due in part to a new deal Sony arranged with retailers to allow for simultaneous release in both regions. Two weeks before release, the worldwide Windows version release was pushed out a few days, to 12 August 2016. Murray stated through Twitter that they felt the best experience for players would be a simultaneous worldwide release on the Windows platform, something they could not control with the retail aspects that were associated with the regional PlayStation 4 market, and thus opted to hold back the Windows release to make this possible. They also used the few extra days to finish additional technical features that they wanted to include <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Windows</b> launch, such as multiple monitor widescreen support.|$|E
25|$|He based {{himself in}} Cicero, Illinois after using bribery and {{widespread}} intimidation {{to take over}} town council elections, and this {{made it difficult for}} the North Siders to target him. His driver was found tortured and murdered, and there was an attempt on Weiss's life in the Chicago Loop. On September 20, 1926, the North Side Gang used a ploy outside the Capone headquarters at the Hawthorne Inn, aimed at drawing him to the windows. Gunmen in several cars then opened fire with Thompson submachine guns and shotguns <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> of the first-floor restaurant. Capone was unhurt and called for a truce, but the negotiations fell through. Three weeks later, Weiss was killed outside the former O'Banion flower shop North Side headquarters. The owner of Hawthorne's restaurant was a friend of Capone's, and he was kidnapped and killed by Moran and Drucci in January 1927.|$|E

[...] Following the European leg, the group did a show in New York City, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Windows</b> on the World, for KROQ radio contest-winners, {{and then at the}} Big Day Out festival in Australia following several Japanese tour dates. Flea, however, began to feel the repercussions of touring causing the band to set up concerts that were less strenuous, and consequently less financially rewarding, for them. These shows would finish the remainder of the Californication tour. As one of the last shows before the release of their next album By the Way, the Chili Peppers played Rock in Rio 3.|$|E

He and his friends would regularly drink all day, though he was able to exert some self-control; according to his friend Syd Simmonds, Friday would obey Hurley's instruction not to drink for 48 hours before each game. However, he would play his prized heavy metal records very loudly at any time of the day or night and take LSD with casual indifference. Hurley attempted to calm Friday down by moving him into an apartment above the football club's elderly ex-groundsman, but to no avail: [...] "Even if it was three in the morning, the first thing would be to get the music playing", Simmonds later said. [...] "We had an old boy living below us ... the ex-groundsman at Reading. He was coming up to 80 and he had a dog's life in the flat.

2500|$|Allegedly, the Seventy-Niner's Café {{was robbed}} {{about an hour}} after the water incident. [...] A crowd of angry African Americans, some bar patrons and some residents, {{gathered}} around the bar. The Feigenbaums said they received a report that their establishment had been robbed at about 8 PM, and arrived at the Seventy-Niner at 8:20 PM. They claimed that a crowd of about 300 people had already gathered outside the bar, and began throwing rocks <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> once the owners had gone inside. Abe Feigenbaum then said he went outside with a [...]44 caliber Ruger Model 44 rifle in his hands, followed by his brother Dave armed with a pistol. The rock-throwing stopped, they said, but resumed when they went back inside. After four calls to the police for help went unanswered, the Feigenbaums called the fire department in desperation and fled the café. The crowd now attempted to burn down the bar, but the attempt failed. At 9:11 PM, the Cleveland Division of Fire arrived at the Seventy-Niner's Café. Worried fire officials notified the Cleveland police of the large crowd, and the police arrived at 9:30 PM.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{military}} prosecutor, a BTR armoured vehicle drove {{close to the}} school and opened fire from its 14.5×114mm KPV heavy machine gun <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> on the second floor. Eyewitnesses (among them Totoonti and Kesayev) and journalists saw two T-72 tanks advance on the school that afternoon, at least one of which fired its 125mm main gun several times. During the later trial, tank commander Viktor Kindeyev testified to having fired [...] "one blank shot and six antipersonnel-high explosive shells" [...] on orders from the FSB. The use of tanks and armoured personnel carriers was eventually admitted to by Lieutenant General Viktor Sobolev, commander of the 58th Army. Another witness cited in the Kesayev report claims that he had jumped onto the turret of a tank in an attempt to prevent it from firing on the school. Scores of hostages were moved by the militants from the burning sports hall into the other parts of the school, in particular the cafeteria, where they were forced to stand at windows. Many of them were shot by troops outside as they were used as human shields, according to the survivors (such as Kudzeyeva, Kusrayeva and Naldikoyeva). Savelyev estimated that 106 to 110 hostages died after being moved to the cafeteria.|$|E
2500|$|The play {{opens in}} a {{fisherman}}'s hut near a {{lake in the}} forest. Outside a storm rages. [...] Here live the old fisherman Auguste and his wife Eugenie.

[...] Auguste is upset because Ondine is out somewhere in the storm. As Auguste rages, naiads, the wind, and even the King of the Ondines himself (throughout the play referred to as the Old One) peer in <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> gently mocking Auguste. [...] Evidently this is not unusual—the [...] old couple are well aware that Ondine is “not like anyone else”. [...] A knight-errant, Hans von Wittenstein zu Wittenstein, arrives seeking shelter. He is welcomed and while he is in the midst of telling Auguste and Eugenie about his betrothed, the princess Bertha, Ondine appears. On seeing Hans she says, “How beautiful he is!” [...] In spite of taunts from Ondine's sister naiads, and against the advice of Auguste, Hans immediately falls in love with Ondine. [...] All thought of Bertha, his “dark angel”—the woman who sent him off on his quest—is banished. [...] Ondine in turn swears eternal love for [...] Hans. [...] The Old One warns her, “The man will deceive you. He will abandon you.” [...] Ondine does not believe him. [...] He gives a final warning “You will remember our pact.” [...] Ondine reluctantly agrees.|$|E
2500|$|In 1885, Gordon {{achieved}} the martyrdom {{he had been}} seeking at Khartoum as the British press portrayed him as a saintly Christian hero and martyr who had died nobly resisting the Islamic onslaught of the Mahdi. As late as 1901 {{on the anniversary of}} Gordon's death, The Times wrote in a leader (editorial) that Gordon was [...] "that solitary figure holding aloft the flag of England {{in the face of the}} dark hordes of Islam". Gordon's death caused a huge wave of national grief all over Britain with 13 March 1885 being set aside as a day of mourning for the [...] "fallen hero of Khartoum". In a sermon, the Bishop of Chichester stated: [...] "Nations who envied our greatness rejoiced now at our weakness and our inability to protect our trusted servant. Scorn and reproach were cast upon us, and would we plead that it was undeserved? No; the conscience of the nation felt that a strain rested upon it". Baring [...] who deeply disliked Gordon [...] wrote that because of the [...] "national hysteria" [...] caused by Gordon's death, that saying anything critical about him at present would be equal to questioning Christianity. Stones were thrown <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> at 10 Downing Street as Gladstone was denounced as the [...] "Murderer of Gordon", the Judas figure who betrayed the Christ figure Gordon. The wave of mourning was not just confined to Britain. In New York, Paris and Berlin, pictures of Gordon appeared in shop windows with black lining as all over the West the fallen general was seen as a Christ-like man who sacrificed himself resisting the advance of Islam.|$|E
