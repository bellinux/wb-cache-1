25|$|Blade Runner {{depicts a}} future whose fictional {{distance}} from present reality has grown sharply smaller as 2020 approaches. The film delves {{into the future}} implications of technology {{on the environment and}} society by reaching into the past using literature, religious symbolism, classical dramatic themes and film noir. This tension between past, present and future is apparent in the retrofitted future of Blade Runner, which is high-tech <b>and</b> <b>gleaming</b> in places but elsewhere decayed and old.|$|E
25|$|The {{great love}} of his life was the German soprano Anja Silja. Only twenty years old, she took over as Senta in 1960 in Bayreuth when Leonie Rysanek cancelled, and created a sensation. Blessed with a strong, agile, {{youthful}} <b>and</b> <b>gleaming</b> voice, and with an extraordinary talent for acting, she embodied Wieland's ideals. She sang Elsa in Lohengrin, Elisabeth and Venus in Tannhäuser and Eva in Meistersinger at Bayreuth. Elsewhere, he cast her as Isolde, Brünnhilde, Richard Strauss's Elektra, and Salome, and Alban Berg's Lulu and Marie in Wozzeck. She even sang Desdemona in Verdi's Otello in Wieland's production.|$|E

Himalayan items include important early Nepalese bronze sculptures, repoussé work and embroidery. Tibetan {{art from the}} 14th to the 19th century is represented by notable 14th- and 15th-century religious images in wood and bronze, scroll paintings and ritual objects. Art from Thailand, Burma, Cambodia, Indonesia and Sri Lanka in gold, silver, bronze, stone, terracotta and ivory represents these rich and complex cultures, the displays span the 6th to 19th centuries. Refined Hindu and Buddhist sculptures reflect the influence of India; items on show include betel-nut cutters, ivory combs and bronze palanquin hooks.|$|E
500|$|Blade Runner delves {{into the}} effects of {{technology}} {{on the environment and}} society by reaching to the past, using literature, religious symbolism, classical dramatic themes, and film noir techniques. This tension between past, present, and future is mirrored in the [...] "retrofitted" [...] future depicted in the film, one which is high-tech <b>and</b> <b>gleaming</b> in places but decayed and outdated elsewhere. In an interview with The Observer in 2002, director Ridley Scott described the film as [...] "extremely dark, both literally and metaphorically, with an oddly masochistic feel". He also said that he [...] "liked the idea of exploring pain" [...] {{in the wake of his}} brother's death from skin cancer: [...] "When he was ill, I used to go and visit him in London, and that was really traumatic for me." ...|$|E
500|$|The Ourika River {{valley is}} located about [...] south of Marrakesh. The [...] "silvery {{valley of the}} Ourika river curving north towards Marrakesh", and the [...] "red heights of Jebel Yagour still capped with snow" [...] to the south are sights in this area. David Prescott Barrows, who {{describes}} Marrakesh as Morocco's [...] "strangest city", describes the landscape in the following terms: [...] "The city lies some fifteen or twenty miles [...] from {{the foot of the}} Atlas mountains, which here rise to their grandest proportions. The spectacle of the mountains is superb. Through the clear desert air the eye can follow the rugged contours of the range for great distances to the north and eastward. The winter snows mantle them with white, and the turquoise sky gives a setting for their grey rocks <b>and</b> <b>gleaming</b> caps that is of unrivaled beauty." ...|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} of the speeches, Patton was {{attempting}} to keep a low profile among the press, as he had been ordered to by General Dwight Eisenhower. Patton was made a central figure in an elaborate phantom army deception scheme, and the Germans believed he was in Dover preparing the First United States Army Group for an invasion of Pas de Calais. On each occasion, he would wear his polished helmet, full dress uniform, <b>and</b> <b>gleaming</b> riding boots, and carry a riding crop to snap for effect. Patton frequently kept his face in a scowl he referred to as his [...] "war face". He would arrive in a Mercedes and deliver his remarks on a raised platform surrounded by a very large audience seated around the platform and on surrounding hills. Each address was delivered to a division-sized force of 15,000 or more men.|$|E
500|$|Richard was nicknamed [...] "the Comet" [...] {{early in}} his career. When {{teammate}} Ray Getliffe remarked that Richard [...] "went in like a rocket" [...] {{as he approached the}} opposition goal, Richard was dubbed [...] "The Rocket" [...] by a local sportswriter; both Baz O'Meara from the Montreal Star and Dink Carroll of the Montreal Gazette have been credited for the appellation. The nickname described Richard's play in terms of speed, strength, and determination. Teammate and coach Toe Blake said the moniker was fitting because [...] "when he would take off, nothing got in his way that could stop him". Goaltender Jacques Plante declared {{it one of the most}} appropriate nicknames given to an athlete, noting the fierce intensity that often showed in Richard's eyes and comparing it to [...] "the rocket's red glare" [...] referenced in [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner". Glenn Hall agreed: [...] "What I remember most about Rocket was his eyes. When he came flying toward you with the puck on his stick, his eyes were all lit up, flashing <b>and</b> <b>gleaming</b> like a pinball machine. It was terrifying." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{story was}} well received. Joe Rybicki of Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine celebrated that [...] "for {{the first time}} I can remember, an extreme-sports game {{actually}} has a real story [...] honest-to-goodness characters". IGN's Douglas Perry called it [...] "a kick, albeit relatively lightweight in nature". He especially praised the pervasive sense of humor in the narrative and in the portrayal of real-world skaters. Knutson called the story [...] "unique" [...] and stated, [...] "I really like that Neversoft {{had the guts to}} try something this radical and ditch the formula that they know works so well." [...] Ben Silverman of Game Revolution described the game's plot as a [...] "silly" [...] cross between those of the 1980s films North Shore <b>and</b> <b>Gleaming</b> the Cube, but he praised it for giving context to the level goals and keeping distance between the skill unlocks. Bramwell called it [...] "hackneyed". Rybicki found that the plot hurt the game's replay value and caused missions to be overly simplistic. By contrast, Game Informers Justin Leeper thought that [...] "it serves to make some of the less-entertaining goals tolerable, because there’s a reason for doing them." ...|$|E

500|$|... "I Blame Myself" [...] {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} contemporary music critics. Writing for The A.V. Club, Annie Zaleski called the track the [...] "most stunning song" [...] from Night Time, My Time; she commended Ferreira's [...] "confident" [...] vocal delivery and the [...] "strident tone" [...] of the recording, which Zaleski felt was [...] "deeply affecting." [...] Dan Keenan from Impact felt that its lyrics showcased that pop {{music is not}} always equivalent with insincerity. Writing for Pitchfork Media, Carrie Battan felt that [...] "I Blame Myself" [...] sounded like [...] "an uptempo beast" [...] that deserved to be successful. Jordan Sargent from Spin felt that [...] "I Blame Myself" [...] positively exemplified a [...] "darkness" [...] among the stand-out tracks from the record, which he credited to having her adolescence [...] "drained away by airplane flights, photo shoots, and useless recording sessions". The New York Times Jon Caramanica was unsure why Ferreira [...] " [...] such a dark picture of herself" [...] with the lyrics, and felt that the self-punishment was unnecessary given the strength of [...] "I Blame Myself" [...] and Night Time, My Time overall. John Preston from Polari believed that the track was a worthy substitute for fans that [...] "mourn the overall departure" [...] of the mainstream pop sound of Ferreira's 2010 single [...] "One", and raved {{that it was an}} example of [...] "airy <b>and</b> <b>gleaming</b> brilliance".|$|E

2500|$|Among female Bohemians in {{the early}} 20th century, the [...] "gypsy look" [...] was a {{recurring}} theme, popularised by, among others, Dorothy [...] "Dorelia" [...] McNeill (1881–1969), muse, lover and second wife of the painter Augustus John (1878–1961), whose full skirts and bright colours {{gave rise to the}} so-called [...] "Dorelia look". Katherine Everett, née Olive, a former student of the Slade School of Art in London, has described McNeil's [...] "tight fitting, hand-sewn, canary coloured bodice above a dark gathered flowing skirt, and her hair very black <b>and</b> <b>gleaming,</b> emphasiz the long silver earrings which were her only adornment".|$|E

2500|$|Mods also treated scooters as {{a fashion}} accessory. Italian scooters were {{preferred}} {{due to their}} clean-lined, curving shapes <b>and</b> <b>gleaming</b> chrome, with sale driven by close associations between dealerships and clubs, such as the Ace of Herts. For young mods, Italian scooters were the [...] "embodiment of continental style {{and a way to}} escape the working-class row houses of their upbringing". Mods customised their scooters by painting them in [...] "two-tone and candyflake and overaccessorized [...] with luggage racks, crash bars, and scores of mirrors and fog lights". Some mods added four, ten, or as many as 30 mirrors to their scooters. They often put their names on the small windscreen. They sometimes took their engine side panels and front bumpers to electroplating shops to get them covered in highly reflective chrome.|$|E
2500|$|In its heyday, {{the ship}} {{was known as the}} [...] "Great White Steamer" [...] and carried 2,000 {{passengers}} at a time on the two-and-a-half hour trip to Catalina. Among its famous passengers were Presidents Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover, actor Robert Mitchum and many of the great musicians of the Big Band era. The Los Angeles Times recalled the passage this way:"To board the Catalina during its heyday was to enter a world of luxurious leather settees <b>and</b> <b>gleaming</b> teak. On the upper deck people danced to swinging big bands. Magicians and clowns entertained passengers. On the lower deck youngsters played hide and seek among the lifeboats, and couples found hidden spots where they could be alone. ... Residents fondly remember the rituals with which {{the ship was}} greeted as it approached the island: Speedboats would circle the ship, water skiers slicing through its giant wake. Closer to shore, children swam out to dive for coins passengers tossed into the bay. People in Avalon gathered to sing as passengers stepped off the ship that docked near the center of town." ...|$|E
2500|$|B.O.A.T.S. II: Me Time {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 67, based on 16 reviews. Jordan Sargent of Spin said, [...] "B.O.A.T.S. II ups the production values {{like a true}} sequel should. Whereas his last album felt at times like a mixtape in expensive packaging, the beats here are full <b>and</b> <b>gleaming</b> with the fruits of success." [...] Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone said [...] "his second LP further displays his knack for playfully hollering about money like he's the first guy who ever had so much paper he couldn't fold it. He tries on some new looks here but nothing slows down the self-described Black Unicorn's scene-chewing charisma." [...] At USA Today, Elysa Garnder evoked that [...] "2 Chainz wraps his gritty flow in bright, crisp arrangements. And he's not afraid to wax lyrical now and then, notably on the pining, lushly orchestrated [...] "Black Unicorn"." [...] Dan Rys of XXL stated, [...] "while the album is billed as the continuation of his first record, last year’s No. 1-debuting Based on a T.R.U. Story, Chainz also branches out a bit {{in a way that}} makes the album feel like he’s bringing at least some new records to the table while remaining stylistically consistent." [...] Kevin Ritchie of Now said, [...] "Sonically, B.O.A.T.S. II is slightly more adventurous than its predecessor thanks to Pharrell’s funky summer jam [...] "Feds Watching" [...] and the EDM-influenced [...] "Netflix", a Diplo-Fergie tag team. 2 Chainz likes to offset the raunchy with the heartfelt, but when the tone shifts to earnestly autobiographical, he sounds derivative." [...] Paul Cantor of Vibe stated, [...] "B.O.A.T.S. II: Me Time really does what it set out to do—prove that 2 Chainz, while occasionally unfocused, is more than a guy who just makes trap music. Make no mistake, there’s a lot of that here, and he’s almost got that formula down to science." ...|$|E
