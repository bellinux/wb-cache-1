40|$|In {{the present}} {{container}} yard, container boxes are mainly handled manually with a rubber-tired gantry crane (RTG). Terminal operators have strongly requested automated handling equipment {{to save on}} labor, raise productivity with information, management and enable 24 -hour operation. Orders for cutting-edge automatic rail-mounted gantry cranes (RMGCs) were accepted and high productivity, safety, and reliability delivered. Features include: (1) Automatic operation excluding container handling on the chassis. (2) Improved storage capacity over RTGs and improved productivity thanks to higher operation speed. (3) Landing variation is less than Â± 50 mm. (4) Safe operation due to self check function on devices and <b>anticollision</b> <b>device.</b> Automation of cranes at container terminals includes various problems caused by the outdoor environment, and its realization has been delayed compared with in-door cranes...|$|E
