40|$|In {{this study}} {{a model of}} {{collective}} bargaining is proposed in which collective bargaining is considered as an ongoing process with component activities recurring periodically. The eight component activities identified are: (1) influential variables, (2) perception and evaluation of the influential variables, (3) bargaining power, (4) prediction, (5) negotiation, (6) mechanism of dispute settlement, (7) feedback loops, and (8) the collective agreement. In addition to the model, an evolution of collective bargaining by teachers in the CEGEP sector of Quebec is presented. This is achieved by descriptive case studies of the first four rounds (1967 - 1980) of collective bargaining in this sector. The {{data for this study}} has been acquired through a review of the literature, documents of the parties concerned, newspapers and interviews. The model is used to analyse the four case studies. From the analysis it is concluded that collective bargaining in the CEGEP sector of Quebec has become highly centralized and politicised. This has contributed to numerous labour conflicts both during the negotiations and during the term of collective agreements. Recommendations are proposed to help resolve some of the problems encountered. The major recommendations include a labour relations board for the public sector and the division of bargaining issues into provincial and local levels. For the negotiations at the provincial level it is proposed to allow the parties to negotiate a mechanism of dispute settlement and a bargaining calendar with compulsory mediation. Also, it is proposed to base the <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to strike and lockout on the refusal of the mediation report by one of the parties.

Contudo, apesar da importante vitória associada à construção jurídico-legal do SUS, a implementação do novo sistema encontra uma série de obstáculos, revelando a dificuldade para consolidar um sistema de saúde {{universal}} de fato, e não apenas de direito. Esse descompasso está relacionado ao momento histórico da construção do SUS: os avanços na universalidade da cobertura na saúde coincidem com a crise do Estado Nacional Desenvolvimentista no Brasil. Segue-se então uma etapa de crise econômica, baixo crescimento e ênfase na reforma do Estado visando o ajuste fiscal. Este contexto é agravado ainda pela rearticulação das forças conservadoras a partir de 1990 e pelo ressurgimento vigoroso do ideário liberal. Coloca-se assim, um cenário hostil (pós 1988) para a consolidação de um sistema de saúde universal e redistributivo. Heranças do passado redobram seu fôlego. O estreitamento das bases de financiamento e as dificuldades de superar interesses privatistas poderosos, arraigados na política de saúde desde o final dos anos 1960, colocam sérios obstáculos para a consolidação plena do SUSAbstract: The <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to {{the health}} in Brazil represented an expressive progress {{in the field of}} the social protection of the country.

40|$|Morske ribe, školjke, rakovi, koralji i drugi morski organizmi nisu u suvremenom hrvatskom pravnom poretku ničije stvari, nego su sastavni dijelovi općeg dobra – pomorskog dobra. Zbog takvog uređenja, postavljaju se neka pitanja o njihovu stjecanju prisvojenjem (okupacijom), koja se inače ne bi postavljala. U prvom redu to je pitanje o sposobnosti (prikladnosti) morskih riba i drugih morskih organizama za to da ih se u vlasništvo stječe prisvojenjem. Nadalje, to je pitanje sposobnosti prisvojitelja za stjecanje vlasništva prisvojenjem, osobito s obzirom na posebna zakonska pravila o morskom ribolovu. Tu je još i pitanje utjecaja posebnih pravila o zaštiti prirode na svačiju mogućnost stjecanja riba i drugih morskih organizama u vlasništvo prisvojenjem. Za sva se ta pitanja nastoji ponuditi odgovore. In {{the current}} Croatian legal order, sea fish, sea shells, crabs, corals and other organisms {{living in the}} sea and in the sea subsoil cannot be {{considered}} as no man’s property (as opposed to wild animals and fish living in rivers and lakes), but they are component parts of the public weal – maritime weal. Such regulation raises some questions that would normally not arise. It is first of all {{a question of the}} capacity (suitability) of sea fish, shells, crabs and corals to be owned by appropriation. According to the Croatian current legal order, they cannot be considered as no man’s property, but are component parts of the maritime weal. Second, {{there is the question of}} the capacity of the appropriator to acquire ownership by appropriation, particularly with regard to the separate rules on sea fishing and to the fact that it is permitted to some and not to all persons. Third, there is the question of the impact of special rules governing the protection of nature on anybody’s capacity to own fish and other sea organisms by appropriation. When answering these questions, we must take into account that, through the act of fishing, sea fish, shells, crabs and other live and non-living organisms are acquired. This has always been an important branch of industry, which is very important for tourism. In addition, other and even more important needs of many individuals have been satisfied by these primordial hunters’ and fishermen’s activities. The only correct answers are those that take into consideration all these facts and that make it possible for fishermen to satisfy all their needs in conformity with the legal order. In order to find the right answer to the question on the capacity (suitability) of sea fish, shells, crabs and corals to be owned by way of appropriation, it is necessary to distinguish between two main acts: the act of extracting them from the general weal, and the act of appropriating what has been extracted. In fact, these two acts are mostly performed together, but the distinction between them still remains. They are essential when an attempt is made to understand the mechanism of acquiring ownership over fish and other sea organisms by appropriation. Although at the level of factual things, these two acts occur simultaneously, at the legal level, the act of extraction precedes the act of appropriation. Therefore, there is always the act of extraction which, as already said, precedes the act of acquisition of things. By extracting them from the general weal, we obtain things that are capable of being owned and are suitable for being owned by way of appropriation. A fish, a shell, a crab or some other organism is first extracted from a general, maritime weal and it is initially not owned by anyone. Thereafter, this no man’s thing is appropriated, whereby the appropriator acquires both the possession and also the ownership of the appropriated thing – a fish, a shell, a crab or any other sea organism. Differentiating between the act of extraction of a thing from the general weal and the act of appropriation allows us to find an answer to the question about how separate legal rules on permission or prohibition of sea fishing influence the capacity of an acquirer to gain ownership by appropriation. An answer to this question is of crucial importance because ownership may be gained only by a person with the capacity to exercise such a right; if not, through appropriation, such a person can only possess but not own the appropriated thing. Such differentiation between the act of extraction and the act of appropriation makes it possible to establish how permission to fish (possession of a benefit, clearance or a licence) is not a precondition for the acquirer’s capacity to acquire ownership by appropriation, but only a precondition for the permission to extract from a general, maritime weal. Even when the extraction of that weal is not permitted, any extraction results in a separated thing which nobody owns until somebody appropriates it and then eventually also owns. A person without the necessary fishing benefit, clearance or licence could also own such a thing by way of appropriation because the fact of not possessing such a permit does not make him or her incapable of acquiring ownership by appropriation. Such a person is only liable for misdemeanour. An answer to the question on the impact of special rules on the protection of nature on anybody’s capacity of acquiring ownership of fish and other sea organisms by way of appropriation cannot be given in the same way as an answer to the question on the impact of the rules on the permissibility or prohibition of sea fishing. The rules on the protection of nature are such that they limit the freedom of appropriating fish and other sea organisms belonging to so-called protected species. Their appropriation is not allowed; they can be acquired only by persons who have the appropriate permit issued by the competent authorities. A person without such a permit (regardless of perhaps possessing the benefit, clearance or fishing licence) is incapable of acquiring ownership of the protected fish or other sea organisms by appropriation. If such a person extracts them from the maritime weal and carries out the act of appropriation, he or she will possess them but not own them. After extraction from the maritime weal, the fish or other organisms are nobody’s property and despite the fact that they are not owned by the appropriator, they cannot become component parts of the general, maritime weal again. They are possessed by the appropriator but continue to be nobody’s property until they are finally owned by the appropriator who has the capacity of acquiring them on the basis of a permit issued by competent authorities. There is a danger here that someone with such a permit issued by competent authorities for acquiring fish and other sea organisms, categorised as protected species, may want to seize them from the appropriator’s possession in order to acquire ownership by appropriation. This would inevitably lead to a conflict between the interested parties, which would certainly not be desirable in any society. It would therefore be a good idea for the legislator not only to refrain from permitting fishing by presuming the <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> of ownership by appropriation, but also to refrain from passing separate laws to determine exclusions or limitations of the possibility to acquire ownership by appropriation. His possible legal or political objectives can undoubtedly be achieved by different tools...|$|E
