40|$|Objective: Patient-centredness {{has become}} an {{important}} aspect of health service delivery; however, there are a limited number of studies that focus on this concept in the domain of hearing healthcare. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine and compare <b>audiologists</b> preferences for patient-centredness in Portugal, India and Iran. Design: The study used a cross-sectional survey design with <b>audiologists</b> recruited from three different countries. Participants: A total of 191 fully-completed responses were included in the analysis (55 from Portugal, 78 from India and 58 from Iran). Main outcome measure: The Patient-Practitioner Orientation Scale (PPOS). Results: PPOS mean scores suggest that <b>audiologists</b> have a preference for patient-centredness (ie, mean of 3. 6 in a 5 -point scale). However, marked differences were observed between specific PPOS items suggesting these preferences vary across clinical situations. A significant level of difference (pless than 0. 001) was found between <b>audiologists</b> preferences for patient-centredness in three countries. <b>Audiologists</b> in Portugal had a greater preference for patient-centredness when compared to <b>audiologists</b> in India and Iran, although no significant differences were found in terms of age and duration of experience among these sample populations. Conclusions: There are differences and similarities in <b>audiologists</b> preferences for patient-centredness among countries.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{investigated}} clinical care delivered to musicians in Australia by <b>audiologists</b> and manufacturers of musicians' hearing protectors (MHP). DESIGN: <b>Audiologists</b> with experience treating musicians {{were invited to}} complete a survey on their service delivery. A second survey was administered to manufacturers of MHPs. STUDY SAMPLE: Four manufacturers of MHP and 31 <b>audiologists</b> completed the surveys. Post hoc analyses were performed comparing the responses of <b>audiologists</b> with more versus less clinical experience; and those with and without musical training. RESULTS: There was considerable variation in the audiological care provided to musicians. Only one-third of <b>audiologists</b> performed pure-tone audiometry prior to MHP fitting, and there was little consistency across the sample in relation to impression taking, preferred attenuation or selection of canal length. There was also significant variation in the manufacturers' approach to MHP, each of whom provided different recommendations regarding preferred impression techniques and material viscosity. CONCLUSIONS: The {{results of this study}} reveal lack of consistency across the hearing healthcare sector with respect to care of musicians' hearing, with potential to impact upon the satisfaction with, and usage of, MHP.

Aim: The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine <b>audiologist’s</b> different conceptions about hearing rehabilitation. Method/Material: Qualitative deep interviews with four <b>audiologists</b> with different backgrounds was conducted and analyzed with a phenomenographic approach. Result: The result of the deep interviews is presented in twelve descriptive categories of the <b>audiologists</b> different opinions about hearing rehabilitation. The result concerns the importance of good cooperation with the patient and relatives in order to improve the patient’s everyday life. <b>Audiologist’s</b> different approaches to rehabilitative features such as group rehabilitation, technical rehabilitation and evaluation are also described.

Most hearing rehabilitation ends with a technical hearing device, according to the interviewed.

40|$|To {{prevent the}} patient from {{experiencing}} uncomfortably loud sounds, a limit for maximum power output, which should {{not exceed the}} patient’s uncomfortable level, is programmed in the hearing aid. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate how hearing aid manufacturers and <b>audiologists</b> make sure that the patient will not experience un¬com¬fortably loud sounds with hearing aids. To study this we interviewed three manufacturers and six audiolo¬gists and examined the software of four manufacturers. The software contains sound systems that can be used to evaluate the patient’s experience of loud sounds with hearing aids. The <b>audiologists</b> however do not use these sound systems. The results of the study show that the manufacturers have differing opinions regarding MPO. The <b>audiologists</b> however have similar opinions in this matter. Most <b>audiologists</b> do not measure uncomfortable levels as routine because of the uncertainty of the measurement. The manufacturers and our sources do not re¬com¬mend measurement of the uncomfortable level without hearing aids. The <b>audiologists</b> use informal methods to evaluate the MPO. From these results we suggest development of a calibrated sound system, which can be used by all <b>audiologists</b> for evaluation of experience of loud sounds with hearing aids.

5000|$|The word [...] "Audiometrist" [...] {{is derived}} from the word Audiometry, as {{distinct}} from Audiology. However, the title audiometrist is often used interchangeably with the role of <b>audiologists,</b> thereby making a precise definition of the word more difficult. <b>Audiologists</b> can therefore refer to themselves as audiometrists, although they still perform the tasks of <b>audiologists.</b> The origin of this cross-attribution is unclear, but may stem from the fact that many audiometrists also receive subsequent training in audiology, thereby making them both audiometrists and <b>audiologists.</b> Additionally, preferences for definitions of audiometrists are more varied worldwide, mainly because Audiometry education and licensing requirements vary from country to country, and the use or mis-use of the word in this fashion continues worldwide. A further role confusion arises because many audiometrists are involved directly in the hearing aid industry in an assistive capacity when they get in-house training for hearing aid audiometry, while others apply audiometry purely to Occupational Health. [...] Since <b>audiologists</b> are more qualified, they can do the work of audiometrists, but not the other way round.

This type of circuitry is generally more flexible than simple adjustable controls.
