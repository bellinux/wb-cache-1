50|$|This {{construction}} {{indicates that}} a past event has one {{of a range of}} possible relationships to the present. This relationship may involve a focus on present result: He has written a very fine book (and look, here it is, we have it now). Alternatively, it may indicate a period which includes the present: I have lived here since my youth (<b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>do).</b> Compare: Have you written a letter this morning? (it is still morning) with Did you write a letter this morning? (it is now afternoon). The perfect construction is frequently used with the adverbs already or recently or with since clauses. The present perfect can identify habitual and continuing actions (I have written letters since I was ten years old.), continuous and ongoing actions (I have lived here for fifteen years.), or completed actions that still affect the present situation (I have visited Paris twice (and the memory of the experience is still with me)).|$|E
5000|$|A cruel twist {{emerged from}} the album however as when 18 months later Brooks was to release the {{follow-up}} album, she discovered that despite huge earnings from the album, the profits showed up as zero. The record company had shipped production of the album out to Germany, which then linked to a separate account held in Panama, meaning that the UK account of the record company showed only a debt of £132,000 in recording costs. To add to this Legend Records later sold the rights to Polydor Records for £500,000 - which was declared at covering the cost of recording and other extras. Brooks looked into the matter with solicitors but reluctantly bowed down due {{to the cost of}} legal proceedings against the chances of winning. She later remarked [...] "This was the business end of it, which I've always hated <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>do</b> to this day". Although aware that these things happen quite often in the music business, she declared that the artist is an innocent party and [...] "it should be stopped because it's totally wrong".|$|E

Winehouse replied: [...] "We're just good friends", and added: [...] "I asked Pete to do a concept EP, and he made this face, he looked at me like I'd pooed on the floor. He wouldn't do it.

40|$|The {{tension between}} privacy and {{disclosure}} in psychoanalysis operates {{in various ways}} in analyst, supervisee, and supervisor. Analysts need to main-tain {{the privacy of their}} patients by keeping their material confidential; they also need to know and share their own internal conscious conflicts to be able to discover unconscious conflicts and their characterological ramifica-tions. Clinical writing is one vehicle for the exploration, discovery, and communication of transference-countertransference issues and other conflicts stimulated by clinical work, but it does not provide the perspec-tive that comes from sharing with another person. Telling a trusted col-league what we think and feel in relation to our patients and ourselves enables us to see our blind spots, as well as providing perspective and affect containment in our work. Mutuality in peer supervision tends to reduce the transference. The special problems of privacy and disclosure in psychoanalytic training are addressed, as are the ways the analyst’s belief in maintaining privacy may affect the analytic process <b>and</b> thera-peutic relationship. <b>I</b> want to begin my discussion of privacy with a disclosure. Many years ago, not long after the termination of my training analysis, I had a patient who was relentlessly plagued by feelings of guilt. My attempts to explore and analyze his intense feelings seemed less and less fruitful over time. I took notes, reread them, thought about him, about our work together, about me. Nothing fresh emerged. I decided to talk with a colleague, but before I initiated the call, I had a dream. I remembered nothing about the dream except this patient’s presence in it. This treatment was on my mind, but I was at a loss to understand what dreaming about the patient meant beyond that. It was a particularly busy time, or so perhaps <b>I</b> rationalized, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>did</b> not call my colleague...|$|R

That was the image I {{produced}} for the magazine and that was done before he died and that is the important thing about that image. At first it did not print. It was considered far too strong and revolutionary. I was very inspired by Che's trip to Bolivia. He went there with the intent to overthrow the intensely corrupt government, helped by the Americans at the time, and that's where he died. I thought {{he was one of the}} greatest men who ever lived <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>do</b> in many ways.

"My {{experience}} {{begins with}} work in physical and human security doing undercover sting operations and clean-up work (we also called it [...] "fire and hire" [...] but also [...] "hack and slash" [...] {{when there was}} a real mess) which supported my want of that expensive computer equipment in the 90s. But I always had a my own sense of fairness. This frustrated my employers because I wouldn't always turn in the guilty if I thought they didn't deserve punishment. For me it was always about what was fair <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>do</b> not equate the law with justice. So like most anyone who began their history in security with the start of the Internet, we were travelers and spelunkers across this new channel and only later called hackers or crackers when the few bad apples made the news.

Coolies, that’s a word people don’t use much any more; but that’s what they were, these Chinese labourers. Coolie comes from the word bitterness. These blokes were eating their fair share of bitterness in France. Navvies for the poms, they were. Shells bursting and the ground shaking like there was an earthquake, and they were stripped to their skinny waists and just kept unloading the wagons. I saw endurance and a determination that I had seldom seen before. Then later, back there in the thirties, I was involved in the factories in Shanghai and I can remember seeing sacks in the alleys at the back of the factories. At first I thought they were sacks of rubbish, but they weren’t, they were dead children. Children worked to death in the foreign-owned factories. Little bundles of humanity worked to death for someone’s bloody profit. So I decided that I would work to help China. I suppose then it was like a marriage of sorts and I wrote what I wrote and said what I said out of loyalty to that marriage. I know China’s faults and contradictions; there are plenty of those.
