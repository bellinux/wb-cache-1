5|$|In a {{study on}} the {{different}} motivations of walkthrough viewers conducted by Max Sjöblom and Juho Hamari from the University of Tampere in 2016, numerous viewer motivations were discussed. From the findings, the five the most significant motivations were found to be improving player experience, confidence, knowledge <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> game, socializing and creating an 'escape' or distraction from their everyday life. Walkthroughs may also guide players throughout an entire game or only certain sections and may be guides on finding rare collectables or unlocking achievements.|$|E
5|$|The game {{supports}} a different interface for Microsoft Windows users {{to that for}} the console versions, and also supports the use of Xbox 360 controllers on Windows PCs. Smith described the team's philosophy of allowing its developers who are passionate <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> release platform to develop software for it; those passionate about PC will work on developing that interface, while Xbox 360 aficionados were allowed to develop the Achievements for that platform. Dishonored was officially released to manufacturing on 28 September 2012.|$|E

Annotation is regularly reviewed {{to keep up with}} current scientific findings. The manual annotation of an entry involves detailed analysis of the protein sequence and of the scientific literature.|$|E
25|$|Later Friedrich Schlegel theorised <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> German strand in {{philosophy}} of nature, citing Jakob Böhme, Johannes Kepler and Georg Ernst Stahl, with Jan Baptist van Helmont as an edge case. Beiser instead traces Naturphilosophie as developed by Schelling, Hegel, Schlegel and Novalis to a crux {{in the theory}} of matter, and identifies the origins of the line they took with the vis viva theory of matter in the work of Gottfried Leibniz.|$|E

25|$|Where, for example, ten {{anonymous}} {{witnesses who}} are unrelated {{to each other}} each provide a witness statement as to the defendant's anti-social behaviour where each statement refers independently to the same particular events and where this {{is supported by a}} witness statement from a non-anonymous witness, such as a housing officer, who confirms that residents have made complaints <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> person {{over a period of time}} then the court may be justified in according the statements a fair degree of weight.|$|E
25|$|Actors and actresses, mostly under {{contract}} with Warner Brothers, {{but also from}} other studios, volunteered {{to appear in the}}se 18 episodes. Some of the more well known actors to appear in the instructional plots included James Cagney, Joe E. Brown, Edward G. Robinson, W.C. Fields, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Richard Barthelmess, Richard Arlen, Guy Kibbee, Warner Oland and Loretta Young. Various scenarios involving the actors were used to provide an opportunity for Jones to convey a lesson <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> part of the game. The shorts were directed by the prolific George Marshall.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{features}} of focus group discussions include, member’s involvement, a number of consecutive meetings, the common characteristics of members with respect to interests, the evolvement of qualitative data, and discussion within the group that is focused on a topic, that is determined by the purposes of the research(Freitas, 1998). In other words, a focus group is an informal discussion among a group of selected individuals <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> topic (Wilkinson 2004). A focus group, as a research method, involves more than one participant per data collection session.|$|E
50|$|The Supreme Court has not {{expressly}} {{ruled on}} the maximum level of restrictions {{that can be}} imposed on an otherwise qualified candidate or political party seeking ballot access.

25|$|The Philippine {{government}} {{is planning to}} buy anti-aircraft guided missiles from Israel. The surface-to-air missiles or multiple launch rocket systems were being offered by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd. and Israel Military Industries Ltd., both based in Israel. Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin was planning to go to Israel next week to forge {{an agreement with the}} prospective suppliers. “If you have an agreement this would hasten the procurement process, say in three to six months you would already have the weapons. The agreement gives you the leeway to access all the information you want know <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> weapon you want to procure”.|$|E
25|$|The school {{continued}} to expand over the 20th century. Further land was bought {{to the north}} and west, increasing the grounds to over 200 acres (809,000m²), and a new school chapel was designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott (perhaps best known for designing the red telephone box) and consecrated in 1927 to commemorate almost 700 pupils who died in the First World War, making it the largest war memorial in England. Around 350 names have been subsequently added to commemorate those who died in the Second World War and other more recent conflicts. Most still attend a short chapel service there six times a week. The school also keeps a small archives library opposite the History block, where it is traditional for Fourths (Year 9) to do an archives project <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> Old Carthusian killed in the First World War.|$|E
25|$|Another key {{concept in}} social {{cognition}} {{is the assumption}} that reality is too complex to easily discern. As a result, we tend to see the world according to simplified schemas or images of reality. Schemas are generalized mental representations that organize knowledge and guide information processing. Schemas often operate automatically and unintentionally, and can lead to biases in perception and memory. Expectations from schemas may lead us to see something that is not there. One experiment found that {{people are more likely to}} misperceive a weapon in the hands of a black man than a white man. This type of schema is actually a stereotype, a generalized set of beliefs <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> group of people (when incorrect, an ultimate attribution error). Stereotypes are often related to negative or preferential attitudes (prejudice) and behavior (discrimination). Schemas for behaviors (e.g., going to a restaurant, doing laundry) are known as scripts.|$|E

Advertisers were notified in advance what items of clothing or accessories {{she planned to}} talk <b>about</b> in <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> day's broadcast. Sponsors who had those items for sale could then advertise in newspapers and in-store promotions that Bennett would be talking about them on that day's program.|$|R
50|$|In May of 2015, {{a federal}} judge in California sternly sanctioned and fined Brayton Purcell partner Gilbert Purcell for lying about witness testimony. Purcell and several other members of his team were fined $250 each.

25|$|Typically, {{humans are}} asked to choose a password, {{sometimes}} guided by suggestions or restricted {{by a set of}} rules, when creating a new account for a computer system or Internet Web site. Only rough estimates of strength are possible, since humans tend to follow patterns in such tasks, and those patterns can usually assist an attacker. In addition, lists of commonly chosen passwords are widely available for use by password guessing programs. Such lists include the numerous online dictionaries for various human languages, breached databases of plaintext and hashed passwords from various online business and social accounts, along with other common passwords. All items in such lists are considered weak, as are passwords that are simple modifications of them. For some decades, investigations of passwords on multi-user computer systems have shown that 40% or more are readily guessed using only computer programs, and more can be found when information <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> user is taken into account during the attack.|$|E
25|$|Davidson {{points out}} that beliefs and {{meanings}} are inseparable. A person holds a sentence true {{based on what he}} believes and what he takes the sentence to mean. If the interpreter knew what a person believed when that person held a sentence to be true, the meaning of the sentence could then be inferred. Vice versa, if the interpreter knew what a person took a sentence to mean when that person held it to be true, the belief of the speaker could be inferred. So Davidson doesn't allow the interpreter to have access to beliefs as evidence, since the interpreter would then be begging the question. Instead, Davidson allows that the interpreter can reasonably ascertain when a speaker holds a sentence true, without knowing anything <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> belief or meaning. That will then allow the interpreter to construct hypotheses relating a speaker and an utterance to a particular state of affairs at a particular time.|$|E
