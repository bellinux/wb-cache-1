5|$|Charles Alfred Cruft (28 June 1852 – 10 September 1938) was a British showman {{who founded}} the Crufts dog show. Charles first became {{involved}} with dogs {{when he began to}} work at Spratt's, a manufacturer of dog biscuits. He rose to the position of general manager, and whilst working for Spratt's in France he was invited to run his first dog show at the 1878 Exposition Universelle. After running dog shows in London for four years, he ran his first Cruft's dog show in 1891, and continued to run a further 45 shows until his death in 1938, as well as running two cat shows in 1894 and 1895. He was involved in a range of dog breed clubs, including that for Schipperkes, Pugs and Borzois. He and his wife upheld a story that they never owned <b>a</b> <b>dog,</b> <b>and</b> instead owned a cat, however Cruft admitted to owning at least one Saint Bernard in his memoirs, published posthumously.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} of Sam and Max {{were created in}} Purcell's youth; Purcell's younger brother Dave originally came up with several comics around the idea of <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> <b>and</b> rabbit detective duo. Dave would often leave unfinished comics around the house. Deliberately making the characters mix up each other's names, shoot {{at each other and}} mock {{the way in which they}} had been drawn, Steve, in a case of sibling rivalry, would sometimes finish the stories in parodies of their original form. This developed from Steve mocking his brother's to the creation of his own stories with the characters. In the late 1970s, Dave Purcell gave Steve the rights to the characters; he signed them over in a contract on Steve's birthday and allowed him to develop the characters in his own way. Purcell believes that his younger brother has recovered and forgiven him from their earlier years. Having kept one as a pet in his youth, Purcell has an interest in rats, which are commonly featured in his artistic work.|$|E
