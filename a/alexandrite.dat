500|$|The {{most common}} oxide of {{vanadium}}, vanadium pentoxide V2O5, {{is used as}} a catalyst in manufacturing sulfuric acid by the contact process and as an oxidizer in maleic anhydride production. Vanadium pentoxide is used in ceramics. [...] Vanadium is an important component of mixed metal oxide catalysts used in the oxidation of propane and propylene to acrolein, acrylic acid or the ammoxidation of propylene to acrylonitrile. In service, the oxidation state of vanadium changes dynamically and reversibly with the oxygen and the steam content of the reacting feed mixture. [...] Another oxide of vanadium, vanadium dioxide VO2, is used in the production of glass coatings, which blocks infrared radiation (and not visible light) at a specific temperature. Vanadium oxide can be used to induce color centers in corundum to create simulated <b>alexandrite</b> jewelry, although <b>alexandrite</b> in nature is a chrysoberyl.|$|E

50|$|Today, several labs {{can produce}} {{synthetic}} lab-grown stones {{with the same}} chemical and physical properties as natural <b>alexandrite.</b> Several methods can produce flux-grown <b>alexandrite,</b> Czocchralski (or pulled) <b>alexandrite,</b> and hydrothermally-produced <b>alexandrite.</b> Flux-grown gems that are fairly difficult to distinguish from natural <b>alexandrite</b> as they contain inclusions that seem natural. Czochralski or pulled <b>alexandrite</b> is easier to identify because it is very clean and contains curved striations visible under magnification. Although the color change in pulled stones can be from blue to red, the color change does not truly resemble that of natural <b>alexandrite</b> from any deposit.

50|$|Some gemstones falsely {{described}} as lab-grown synthetic <b>alexandrite</b> are actually corundum laced with trace elements (e.g., vanadium) or color-change spinel {{and are not}} actually chrysoberyl. As a result, {{they would be more}} accurately {{described as}} simulated <b>alexandrite</b> rather than “synthetic”. This alexandrite-like sapphire material has been around for almost 100 years and shows a characteristic purple-mauve colour change, which does not really look like <b>alexandrite</b> because there is never any green.|$|E
50|$|The <b>alexandrite</b> variety {{displays}} a color change (<b>alexandrite</b> effect) {{dependent upon the}} nature of ambient lighting. <b>Alexandrite</b> effect is the phenomenon of an observed color change from greenish to reddish with a change in source illumination. <b>Alexandrite</b> results from small scale replacement of aluminium by chromium ions in the crystal structure, which causes intense absorption of light over a narrow range of wavelengths in the yellow region (580 nm) of the visible light spectrum. Because human vision is most sensitive to green light and least sensitive to red light, <b>alexandrite</b> appears greenish in daylight where {{the full spectrum of}} visible light is present, and reddish in incandescent light which emits less green and blue spectrum. This color change is independent of any change of hue with viewing direction through the crystal that would arise from pleochroism.|$|E
50|$|Most gemstones {{described}} as synthetic <b>alexandrite</b> are actually simulated <b>alexandrite</b> - synthetic corundum laced with vanadium {{to produce the}} color change. This <b>alexandrite</b> like sapphire material {{has been around for}} almost 100 years. The material shows a characteristic purple-mauve color change which, although attractive, differs from <b>alexandrite</b> because there is never any green. The stones will be very clean and may be available in large sizes. Gemological testing will reveal a refractive index of 1.759-1.778 (corundum) instead of 1.741-1.760 (chrysoberyl). Under magnification, gas bubbles and curved stria may be evident. When examined with a spectroscope a strong vanadium absorption line at 475 nm will be apparent.|$|E

5000|$|Color {{change is}} most {{commonly}} found in <b>alexandrite,</b> a variety of chrysoberyl gemstones. Other gems also occur in color-change varieties, including (but not limited to) sapphire, garnet, spinel. <b>Alexandrite</b> displays a color change dependent upon light, along with strong pleochroism. The gem results from small-scale replacement of aluminium by chromium oxide, {{which is responsible for}} alexandrite's characteristic green to red color change. <b>Alexandrite</b> from the Ural Mountains in Russia is green by daylight and red by incandescent light. Other varieties of <b>alexandrite</b> may be yellowish or pink in daylight and a columbine or raspberry red by incandescent light. The optimum or [...] "ideal" [...] color change would be fine emerald green to fine purplish red, but this is exceedingly rare.|$|E

5000|$|According to {{a widely}} popular but {{controversial}} story, <b>alexandrite</b> {{was discovered by}} Nordenskiöld, on the tsarevitch Alexander's sixteenth birthday on April 17, 1834 and named <b>Alexandrite</b> {{in honor of the}} future Tsar — Alexander II of Russia. Although it was Nordenskiöld who discovered <b>alexandrite,</b> he could not possibly have discovered and named it on Alexander's birthday. Nordenskiöld's initial discovery occurred as a result an examination of a newly found mineral sample he had received from Count Lev Alekseevich Perovskii (1792-1856), which he identified it as emerald at first. Confused with the high hardness, he decided to continue his examinations. Later that evening, while looking at the specimen under candlelight, he was surprised to see that the color of the stone had changed to raspberry-red instead of green. Later, he confirmed the discovery of a new variety of chrysoberyl, and suggested the name [...] "diaphanite"(from the Greek [...] "di" [...] two and [...] "aphanes", unseen or [...] "phan", to appear, or show). Perovskii however had his own plans and used the rare specimen to ingratiate himself with the Imperial family by presenting it to the future Tsar and naming it <b>Alexandrite</b> in his honor on April 17, 1834, but it wasn't until 1842 that the description of the color changing chrysoberyl was published for the first time under the name of <b>alexandrite.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Alexandrite</b> {{from the}} Ural Mountains in Russia can be green by {{daylight}} and red by incandescent light. Other varieties of <b>alexandrite</b> may be yellowish or pink in daylight and a columbine or raspberry red by incandescent light. Stones that show a dramatic color change and strong colors (e.g. red-to-green) are rare and sought-after, but stones that show less distinct colors (e.g. yellowish green changing to brownish yellow) {{may also be}} considered “alexandrite” by gem labs such as the Gemological Institute of America.|$|E

50|$|In the beginning, {{the team}} was led by the {{scientist}} and developer of the hydrothermal process, the late Alexander Lebedev, whose name was kept secret by the Soviet regime for many years. Their objective was to grow and to supply emeralds, rubies, sapphires, <b>alexandrite</b> and other gems to the jewelry industry. The driving force was Academician Nikolai Dobretsov, former President of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences (now retired). Joint Venture Tairus has been formed with Tairus (Thailand) Company Ltd., of Bangkok, to manufacture and distribute the gems. Tairus has achieved many scientific breakthroughs. For example, {{the development of the}} hydrothermally grown corundum, aquamarine {{and the development of a}} revolutionary process of horizontal crystallization for growing Corundum (Ruby), Chrysoberyl and <b>Alexandrite.</b>|$|E
50|$|If the {{pegmatite}} fluid {{is rich in}} beryllium, crystals of beryl or chrysoberyl could form. Beryl has a high {{ratio of}} beryllium to aluminium, while {{the opposite is true}} for chrysoberyl. Both are stable with the common mineral quartz. For <b>alexandrite</b> to form, some chromium would also have had to be present. However, beryllium and chromium do not tend to occur in the same types of rock. Chromium is commonest in mafic and ultramafic rocks in which beryllium is extremely rare. Beryllium becomes concentrated in felsic pegmatites in which chromium is almost absent. Therefore, the only situation where an <b>alexandrite</b> can grow is when Be-rich pegmatitic fluids react with Cr-rich country rock. This unusual requirement explains the rarity of this chrysoberyl variety.|$|E
5000|$|Q-switched Alexandrite: 755 nm. The weakest {{of all the}} q-switched {{devices and}} {{somewhat}} similar to the Ruby laser in that the <b>Alexandrite</b> creates a red light which is highly absorbed by green and dark tattoo pigments. However, the <b>alexandrite</b> laser color is slightly less absorbed by melanin, so this laser has a slightly lower incidence of unwanted pigmentary changes than a ruby laser. This laser works well on green tattoos but because of its weaker peak power it works only moderately well on black and blue ink. It does not work at all (or very minimally) on red, orange, yellow, brown, etc. This laser wavelength is also available in a picosecond speed with anecdotal claims that it removes ink faster.|$|E
