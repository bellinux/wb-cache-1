2500|$|Villanova University {{was home}} to the Liberty Bell's [...] "Sister Bell," [...] the {{replacement}} bell ordered from the Whitechapel Bell Foundry after the original bell cracked in 1753. This new bell was installed at the Pennsylvania State House (Independence Hall), and attached to the State House clock. The Sister Bell rang the hours until the late 1820s, when the bell was removed during <b>a</b> <b>renovation</b> and <b>loaned</b> to the Olde St. Augustine Church in Philadelphia. In 1829, the bell was hung in a new cupola and tower designed by architect William Strickland. There it remained until May 8, 1844, when it was destroyed, along with the Olde St. Augustine Church, during the Philadelphia Nativist riots. The friars of the Order of Saint Augustine had the [...] "Sister Bell" [...] recast and transferred to Villanova University. The bell was moved off campus in 2011.|$|R

50|$|In 2000, the New York State Attorney General's Office {{launched}} {{an investigation into}} The Players' financial dealings with the Hampden-Booth Theater Library, which occupies {{about a third of}} the club's building, and the John Drew Fund, a charity which has its offices in the building. The allegations were that the club may have overcharged the library for building upkeep, and kept more than its appropriate share of the sale of a collection of books in 1984, using the money to help pay for <b>a</b> major <b>renovation</b> to the building. The club also borrowed money from the John Drew Fund to pay for the <b>renovation,</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> which had not yet been paid back. The boards of the club, the library, and the fund have overlapping members, a circumstance which may have contributed to the financial irregularities. The dispute between the library and the club was settled, with neither owing the other any money; the settlement also satisfied part of the state's investigation. One of the terms of the settlement was that the club would sell its John Singer Sargent portrait of Edwin Booth to raise money.|$|R
