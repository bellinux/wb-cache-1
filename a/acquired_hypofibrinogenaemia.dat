40|$|Background: The {{benefits}} of fibrinogen concentrate in hypofibrinogenaemia {{have been established}} in congenital and {{has been used in}} acquired disorders. Most European countries have already changed their practice, using fibrinogen concentrate. Methods: We compared the use of fibrinogen concentrate in <b>acquired</b> <b>hypofibrinogenaemia</b> to cryoprecipitate, which continues to be the standard of care in the UK. We undertook a retrospective analysis of fibrinogen increment in patients treated for <b>acquired</b> <b>hypofibrinogenaemia.</b> Results: Sixty four transfusion episodes receiving cryoprecipitate and 36 episodes receiving fibrinogen concentrate were compared. The median increment following 10 donor pools (two bags) of cryoprecipitate was 0. 26. g/l, compared to 0. 44. g/l following 2. g of fibrinogen concentrate. Conclusion: With its superior safety profile from infectious diseases, this provides further evidence to support the use of fibrinogen concentrate. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
