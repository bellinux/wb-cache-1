50|$|Some <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> {{more likely}} to be {{targeted}} than others by human users of repellents. Targeted <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> often predators of animals of interest to human beings, such as food fish or livestock. Sometimes the targeted <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> predators of human beings themselves.|$|R

5|$|According to the Columbia Animal Hospital the {{frequency}} of affected <b>animals</b> <b>is</b> dogs, humans, pigs, horses, cattle, chickens, and turkeys, and in dogs the most commonly affected breeds include the German Shepherd, Golden and Labrador Retriever, Rottweiler, Great Dane, Bernese Mountain Dog, and Saint Bernard. Although any joint may be affected, those commonly affected by OCD in the dog are: shoulder (often bilaterally), elbow, knee and tarsus.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the general}} effects of {{invasive}} <b>animals</b> <b>is</b> not as profound as plants, {{they are more}} noticeable in many instances and {{a constant reminder of}} the many exotic species in the region. A wildlife biologist and several construction workers near Homestead Air Force Base witnessed a scene where several iguanas sunning themselves in a canal were attacked by a spectacled caiman, to the surprise of all.|$|E

30|$|Twenty-four intact male {{yearling}} Washera sheep {{with similar}} body condition and initial body weight of 18.14 [*]± 1.07  kg (mean[*]±[*]SD) were bought {{from a local}} market of Genet Abo town. Age of the <b>animals</b> <b>was</b> determined by dentition and information obtained by the owners. <b>Animals</b> <b>were</b> neck tagged for identification, and were quarantined for 21 days. During this time, <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> dewormed for internal parasites using albendazol and fasinex and sprayed for external parasites using diazinon. Experimental <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> also vaccinated against pasteurollosis and anthrax based on recommendation of a veterinarian.

5|$|Animal Coloration, or in full Animal Coloration. An {{account of}} the {{principal}} facts and theories relating to the colours and markings of <b>animals,</b> <b>is</b> a book by the English zoologist Frank Evers Beddard, published by Swan Sonnenschein in 1892. It formed part of the ongoing debate amongst zoologists about the relevance of Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection to the observed appearance, structure, and behaviour of animals, and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|Current {{research}} suggests that the primary method of infection in <b>animals</b> <b>is</b> through ingestion. It is thought that prions may be deposited in the environment through the remains of dead animals and via urine, saliva, and other body fluids. They may then linger in the soil by binding to clay and other minerals.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability of}} animals {{including}} fish, lizards and frogs {{to change their}} colours quickly is discussed.

5|$|<b>Animals</b> <b>is</b> {{the tenth}} studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, {{released}} on 23 January 1977 by Harvest Records in the United Kingdom and by Columbia Records in the United States. It {{is a concept}} album that provides a scathing critique of the social-political conditions of late-1970s Britain, and presents a marked change in musical style from their earlier work. Animals was recorded at the band's studio, Britannia Row, in London, but its production was punctuated by the early signs of discord that three years later would culminate in keyboardist Richard Wright leaving the band. The album's cover image, a pig floating between two chimneys of the Battersea Power Station, was conceived by the band's bassist and lead songwriter Roger Waters, and was designed by long-time collaborator Storm Thorgerson of Hipgnosis.|$|E
5|$|Artificial selection, the {{deliberate}} selective breeding of domestic <b>animals,</b> <b>is</b> {{being used to}} breed back recently extinct animals {{in an attempt to}} achieve an animal breed with a phenotype that resembles that extinct wildtype ancestor. A breeding-back (intraspecific) hybrid may be very similar to the extinct wildtype in appearance, ecological niche and to some extent genetics, but the initial gene pool of that wild type is lost forever with its extinction. As a result, bred-back breeds are at best vague look-alikes of extinct wildtypes, as Heck cattle are of the aurochs.|$|E
5|$|Cochrane {{argues that}} nonhuman animals {{do not possess}} an {{intrinsic}} interest in freedom. Therefore, owning or using nonhuman <b>animals</b> <b>is</b> not, in itself, unjust. This aspect of his thought has generated responses by others, including the political theorist Robert Garner and the philosopher John Hadley, who argue {{that there may be}} reasons to claim that nonhuman animals do possess an interest in freedom. Cochrane has also proposed a cosmopolitan alternative to Sue Donaldson and Will Kymlicka's picture of a political animal rights, explicated in their 2011 book Zoopolis. Though Donaldson and Kymlicka have defended their account against Cochrane's criticism, they have said that they welcome attempts to develop alternative political theories of animal rights to their own. Cochrane's other research focusses variously on bioethics, punishment, just war and human rights.|$|E
50|$|In 2012, 982,842 <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> used in {{research}} in Sweden. If fish used in sample-based fishery surveys <b>are</b> included, 5,535,458 <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> used.|$|R

5|$|Cosmetics {{testing on}} <b>animals</b> <b>is</b> banned in India, the European Union, Israel and Norway while {{legislation}} in the U.S. and Brazil is currently considering similar bans. In 2002, after 13 years of discussion, the European Union agreed to phase in a near-total ban {{on the sale of}} animal-tested cosmetics by 2009, and to ban all cosmetics-related animal testing. France, which is home to the world's largest cosmetics company, L'Oreal, has protested the proposed ban by lodging a case at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, asking that the ban be quashed. The ban is also opposed by the European Federation for Cosmetics Ingredients, which represents 70 companies in Switzerland, Belgium, France, Germany, and Italy. In October 2014, India passed stricter laws that also ban the importation of any cosmetic products that are tested on animals.|$|E
5|$|Elemental boron, boron oxide, boric acid, borates, {{and many}} {{organoboron}} compounds are relatively nontoxic to {{humans and animals}} (with toxicity {{similar to that of}} table salt). The LD50 (dose at which there is 50% mortality) for <b>animals</b> <b>is</b> about 6g per kg of body weight. Substances with LD50 above 2g are considered nontoxic. An intake of 4g/day of boric acid was reported without incident, but more than this is considered toxic in more than a few doses. Intakes of more than 0.5grams per day for 50 days cause minor digestive and other problems suggestive of toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi {{believed}} that some life forms are {{more capable of}} suffering, and non-violence to him meant not having the intent as well as active efforts to minimise hurt, injury or suffering to all life forms. Gandhi explored food sources that reduced violence to various life forms in the food chain. He {{believed that}} slaughtering <b>animals</b> <b>is</b> unnecessary, as other sources of foods are available. He also consulted with vegetarianism campaigners during his lifetime, such as with Henry Stephens Salt. Food to Gandhi {{was not only a}} source of sustaining one's body, but a source of his impact on other living beings, and one that affected his mind, character and spiritual well being. He avoided not only meat, but also eggs and milk. Gandhi wrote the book The Moral Basis of Vegetarianism and wrote for the London Vegetarian Society's publication.|$|E

5000|$|Germ-free <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> <b>animals</b> {{that have}} no {{microorganisms}} living in or on them.

[...] When known strains of bacteria or microbiota are introduced to a germ-free <b>animal,</b> it usually <b>is</b> referred to as a gnotobiotic animal, however technically speaking, germ-free <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> also gnotobiotic because the status of their microbial community is known.|$|R
5|$|In {{the final}} chapter Cochrane argues that each school has an {{important}} contribution to make to animal justice, particularly liberalism and utilitarianism. He then outlines his own approach. He writes that, while talk of our political and moral obligations to <b>animals</b> <b>is</b> today more prominent than ever, it remains on the periphery of mainstream dialogue in political theory. He closes by arguing that this neglect is a problem for political theory, and that animals are owed justice. If the book's claims are correct, Cochrane concludes, questions concerning the treatment of animals should be considered some of the most pressing political issues today.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Marge and Lisa {{arrive at}} the beach, but {{discover}} {{that the ability to}} help the <b>animals</b> <b>is</b> reserved for celebrities, who are already doing the job. The two are put to work cleaning rocks, and soon abandon the job and drive home. While picking up Bart, Homer learns about {{the true nature of the}} burlesque house, but does nothing about Bart working there. Principal Skinner visits the house and sees Bart as the door greeter. He reports it to the Lovejoys and the Flanders, who confront Homer about the matter. Homer declares that he has no problem with Bart working there just as Marge returns home unexpectedly.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} Malagasy {{hippopotamus}} (also known as Malagasy dwarf hippopotamus or Malagasy pygmy hippopotamus or Madagascan instead of Malagasy) {{lived on the}} island of Madagascar but are now believed to be extinct. The animals were very similar to the extant hippopotamus and pygmy hippopotamus. The fossil record suggests that at least one species of hippopotamus lived until about 1,000 years ago, and other evidence suggests that the species may have survived until much more recently. The taxonomy of these <b>animals</b> <b>is</b> not resolved and not widely studied. The various species are believed to have survived into the Holocene era.|$|E
5000|$|In 2009, the Society made a {{commitment}} to become a no-kill shelter, disclosing detailed statistics including [...] "No Kill Equation" [...] topics, such as the number of animals in foster care, and numbers of feral cats benefiting from trap-neuter-return. In 2010, the organization reported saving 81.8% of the animals leaving its custody, while 50 healthy or treatable <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> euthanized. These numbers were a significant improvement over a 65% save rate in 2009, when 301 <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> euthanized for space.
