5|$|Zwingli's {{views on}} baptism were largely a {{response}} to Anabaptism, a movement which attacked the practice of infant baptism. He defended the baptism of children by describing {{it as a sign}} of a Christian's covenant with disciples and God just as God made <b>a</b> <b>covenant</b> with Abraham.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>Covenant</b> army {{attacks the}} academy causing {{confusion}} and panic. Although not made clear in Forward Unto Dawn, the Covenant are a theocratic collection of alien {{species that are}} religiously offended by Humanity and seek to eradicate it. The events portrayed in Forward Unto Dawn {{are some of the}} earliest encounters with the Covenant, and the characters other than Master Chief were unaware of their existence.|$|E
5|$|After {{repelling}} <b>a</b> <b>Covenant</b> counterattack on the Forerunner facility, the Spirit of Fire {{travels to}} Arcadia, where the Covenant has begun raiding local cities and slaughtering civilians. Forge contacts the local Spartan special forces and assists with the evacuation process. The Covenant builds a giant energy shield {{to hide the}} construction of a gigantic Scarab super-weapon, but the UNSC forces use experimental equipment to break through. The Scarab is destroyed, but the Arbiter kidnaps Anders and escapes the planet.|$|E

5|$|The pub {{also has}} a lawned pub garden {{to the north and}} a car park to the south. The car park has <b>a</b> <b>covenant</b> that {{prevents}} it from being built upon, with underground channels, cables and pipes, and an adjacent substation.

5|$|Though secular {{scholars}} {{consider the}} story to be literary and not historical, circumcision features prominently in the Hebrew Bible. The narrative in Genesis chapter 17 describes the circumcision of Abraham and his relatives and slaves. In the same chapter, Abraham's descendants are commanded to circumcise their sons on the eighth day of life as part of <b>a</b> <b>covenant</b> with God.|$|E
5|$|To {{develop a}} {{distinctive}} {{look for the}} various species of the Covenant, Bungie artists drew inspiration from reptilian, ursine, and avian characteristics. <b>A</b> <b>Covenant</b> design scheme of purples and reflective surfaces was made to separate the alien from human architecture. The Covenant were generally well received by critics who appreciated the challenge they provided to players; several critics lamented the change of the main enemies from Elites to Brutes in Halo 3 and conversely praised their return in the later Halo: Reach.|$|E
5000|$|Easements are {{distinct}} from restrictive covenants {{and the court}} will not allow {{the creation of an}} easement where the right is in substance <b>a</b> restrictive <b>covenant.</b> Showing <b>a</b> restrictive <b>covenant</b> exists requires demonstrating different criteria are met and <b>a</b> restrictive <b>covenant</b> operates only in equity and not at the common law, whereas an easement can operate at either. An instrument that imposes a negative obligation on another tenement will normally be <b>a</b> restrictive <b>covenant,</b> although there are exceptions [...] - [...] the right to light, capable of being an easement, acts to prevent the owner of the servient tenement from acting inconsistently with it.|$|R

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>Covenant</b> fleet appears outside Earth's {{defensive}} perimeter {{and begins}} {{an invasion of}} the planet. While the UNSC repels most of the fleet, a single Covenant cruiser carrying an important member of the Covenant hierarchy, the High Prophet of Regret, assaults the city of New Mombasa, Kenya. The Master Chief assists in clearing the city of Covenant; with his fleet destroyed, Regret makes a hasty slipspace jump, and Keyes, Johnson, Cortana and the Master Chief follow aboard the UNSC ship In Amber Clad. The crew discover another Halo installation; realizing the danger the ring presents, Keyes sends the Master Chief to kill Regret while she and Johnson find Halo's key to activation, the Index.|$|E
5|$|En {{route to}} the Autumns dry dock, Carter is {{critically}} wounded. He rams his ship into <b>a</b> <b>Covenant</b> mobile assault platform, allowing Six and Emile to safely reach the shipyard. Emile uses a mass driver emplacement to defend the Autumn while Six fights through Covenant ground forces to get Cortana to the Autumns captain, Jacob Keyes. When Emile is slain by Elites, Six remains behind to control the gun, ensuring the Autumns escape. The Autumn flees from Reach and discovers a Halo ringworld, leading directly {{to the events of}} Halo: Combat Evolved.|$|E
5|$|Friedrich Schleiermacher, an {{influential}} nineteenth-century Reformed theologian, saw baptism {{as the way}} the church receives new members and taught that faith is a precondition for baptism. He was ambivalent about the practice of infant baptism, teaching {{that it was not}} an essential institution, but could be continued as long as the church was faithful in bringing children to confirmation. Schleiermacher also saw baptism as primarily individual rather than initiating one into <b>a</b> <b>covenant</b> community, and rejected the idea that baptism should be connected with Old Testament circumcision.|$|E

50|$|In English law {{it is not}} {{possible}} to enforce <b>a</b> positive <b>covenant</b> on successive owners of freehold land, other than to maintain a boundary fence, without creating an elaborate trust. <b>A</b> positive <b>covenant</b> is, broadly, one which involves the expenditure of money to perform.|$|R
5|$|Itinerant missionaries {{served the}} meeting house {{for its first}} few years. The church gained its first pastor in 1807, when Rev Levi Parsons was ordained and installed. That same year, the {{congregation}} adopted fifteen articles of faith and <b>a</b> <b>covenant,</b> which remained membership prerequisites for one hundred years. In the same year the church affiliated with the Presbyterian Synod of Albany, three years later becoming a charter member of the Presbytery of Cayuga, which, in 1811, {{became part of the}} newly formed Synod of Geneva. Mr Parsons served until 1833 when he accepted posts in Tully, New York and Otisco, New York. He returned to Marcellus in 1835, where he remained until 1841 when Rev John Tompkins was appointed.|$|E
5|$|Jun and Six are {{dispatched}} on {{a covert}} mission {{to assess the}} Covenant's strength and discover an invasion force gathering on the planet. The following morning, Noble Team assists UNSC forces in assaulting <b>a</b> <b>Covenant</b> ground base. When a massive Covenant super-carrier joins the fight, Jorge and Six {{take part in a}} plan to destroy the super-carrier using a makeshift bomb. The Spartans use starfighters to infiltrate a smaller Covenant corvette, prepare the bomb and set the corvette on a docking course with the carrier, but the bomb's timer is damaged. Left with no choice, Jorge stays behind and sacrifices himself to destroy the super-carrier. Moments later, huge numbers of Covenant ships arrive at Reach and begin a full-scale invasion.|$|E
5|$|Like the SPARTAN-IIs, the SPARTAN-III {{candidates}} undergo radical cybernetic {{and biological}} enhancements and are outfitted with special armor {{to increase their}} abilities. The first SPARTAN-III company proves highly successful, but is wiped out when ordered to destroy <b>a</b> <b>Covenant</b> orbital shipyard in 2537. Shaken by the massacre of his troops, Kurt improves the training regimen for his next batch of SPARTAN-III recruits, but they too are all killed in action so Kurt, {{in an effort to}} reduce casualties, institutes illegal biological modifications on the third company of SPARTANs. While conducting a training exercise near Zone 67, UNSC personnel find themselves under attack by alien robotic drones.|$|E

5|$|Reformed theologians believe sacraments to be instituted in {{the context}} of {{covenants}} between God and people. They believe that when God makes covenants, he provides physical signs associated with the covenant. Old Testament covenant signs include the rainbow which appeared following <b>a</b> <b>covenant</b> made with Noah. Circumcision is believed to be a sign of God's covenant with Abraham and his descendants. Such signs entail blessings and sanctions on those with whom God covenants. In the New Testament period there are two such signs or sacraments: baptism and the Lord's Supper.|$|E
5|$|Six {{returns to}} the surface and travels to the city of New Alexandria. The Spartan aids the local {{military}} in fighting the Covenant and evacuating the city, reuniting with Noble Team along the way. They retreat to an underground bunker when the Covenant begin to bombard the city with plasma, but Kat is killed by <b>a</b> <b>Covenant</b> sniper before they reach it. Recalled to Sword Base, Noble Team is guided underground to an ancient artifact that Halsey believes is key to winning the war against the Covenant. Six, Carter and Emile are entrusted with transporting the artificial intelligence Cortana, and the information she carries concerning the artifact, to the UNSC ship Pillar of Autumn. Jun leaves the team to escort Halsey to another base.|$|E

5|$|The Ten Commandments are {{a series}} of {{religious}} and moral imperatives that are recognized as a moral foundation in several of the Abrahamic religions, including Catholicism. As described in the Old Testament books Exodus and Deuteronomy, the Commandments form part of <b>a</b> <b>covenant</b> offered by God to the Israelites to free them from the spiritual slavery of sin. According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church—the official exposition of the Catholic Church's Christian beliefs—the Commandments are considered essential for spiritual good health and growth, and {{serve as the basis for}} Catholic social justice. A review of the Commandments is one of the most common types of examination of conscience used by Catholics before receiving the sacrament of Penance.|$|E
5|$|The novel, {{like the}} video game it is based on, begins as the Pillar of Autumn exits slipspace, {{discovering}} an unexpected massive ringworld hidden by a moon in orbit around a gas giant. In the system {{are a host of}} Covenant, who notice the lone ship. <b>A</b> <b>Covenant</b> leader forbids the fleet to fire on the Autumn, for fear of damaging the ring. Instead, they board and capture the ship. Meanwhile, technicians on the Autumn prepare for battle and awaken a single soldier from cryo sleep—a Spartan known as the Master Chief.|$|E
5|$|Time {{constraints}} prevented {{many elements}} from {{appearing in the}} final game. One such missing feature was a fatality system by which Spartans or Covenant leaders could inflict massive damage on large groups of units. Pottinger said that the animations, while interesting, did not mesh with the fast-paced combat of Halo Wars and raised balance concerns. Other elements based on Halo fiction did not work in a strategy game. Although more than 100 people worked on the project, which cost {{tens of millions of}} dollars, <b>a</b> <b>Covenant</b> campaign was never realized {{because of a lack of}} manpower and money.|$|E
