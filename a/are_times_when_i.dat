He avoided {{explicitly}} mentioning {{his views on}} The Tonight Show, saying he [...] "hates to be pinned down", as that would [...] "hurt me as an entertainer, which is what I am." [...] As he explained in 1970, [...] "In my living room I would argue for liberalization of abortion laws, divorce laws, and there <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> would like to express a view on the air. I {{would love to have}} taken on Billy Graham. But I'm on TV five nights a week; I have nothing to gain by it and everything to lose." [...] He also seldom invited political figures onto the Tonight Show because he [...] "didn't want it to become a political forum" [...] and did not want the show used, by himself or others, to influence the opinions of the viewers.|$|E
2500|$|Nozomi {{continued}} to enjoy sex {{both within and}} outside of the AV setting, and stated that she did not mind having it every day. Nevertheless, the intense pace of her career was beginning to tire her. She had been making up to ten videos a month, and expressed fatigue with the AV work both in interviews and in private conversations. She told an interviewer, [...] "...it {{was a lot of fun}} at first, but I'm really tired nowadays. To tell you the truth, I think I'm over-exerting myself right now. So I want to take a decent vacation rather than get paid." [...] She continued, [...] "Like I said before, I enjoy the shoots a lot. There <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> think it's hard and tiring, but the fun part is a lot greater!" [...] A friend later reported that Nozomi was planning to get married, quit the AV industry and become a stage actress. Nozomi also formed an idol musical group with some other AV idols and released a musical CD in 2002.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2011, TobyMac {{stated that}} a reunion tour would {{probably}} happen [...] "sooner or later". He mentioned talking with Michael and Kevin about [...] "when it should be" [...] and [...] "what it could look like." [...] Fans {{hoping for a}} reunion tour {{in the near future}} may be disappointed: [...] "Right now, I think we're really just enjoying the mountain we're climbing, each of us individually. It's never been a completely closed door. We've always sort of laughed about it, smiled about it. It's timing, I guess." [...] On May 28 and 29, 2011, at the Big Church Day Out in Wiston, UK, TobyMac joined the Newsboys twice to perform [...] "Jesus Freak", and Michael sang [...] "In the Light" [...] on both days with Toby's band, Diverse City. In June 2011 Toby admitted that he thought about Kevin and Michael for every song that he writes. His song [...] "Wonderin'" [...] is about his past with Kevin and Michael in DC Talk. [...] "It's just a warm look back at DC Talk," [...] says Toby, almost wistfully. [...] "It's reminiscing about Michael and Kevin and what we did together, and recognizing their influence on me. I love what I do today, but there <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> wonder, What if we stayed together? I've got these dreams I'm pursuing now, but are they stealing me from you?" [...] On June 7, 2011, Back 2 Back Hits, featuring songs off Jesus Freak and Supernatural, was released.|$|E

5000|$|Colton {{says that}} the song [...] "sums up my American Idol experience. There <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> felt like I was by myself, or just felt {{unplugged}} from reality. There <b>were</b> even <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> asked God if He was still there...He always answered [...] "I was never gone."" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll try not to," [...] he answered. [...] "Perhaps I'm {{incapable}} of it; I'm not progressive. Still, there <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> feel rather old." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lawson, with {{a curious}} half-smile, broke the silence. [...] "There <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> wish I owned a Gatling gun {{and knew how}} to use it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nevertheless," [...] Wingrave admitted, [...] "there <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{fear that}} we shall not get on together. I begin to suspect {{that you have a}} conscience." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "There <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{sat down}} and told my guitar how I felt, and I {{realized}} I had created a song," [...] Warren remembers.|$|R
6000|$|She {{stopped with}} another laugh {{that had a}} faintly suggestive ring in it. [...] "There <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> wish I was {{somebody}} else who hadn't a penny!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Alton {{dropped his}} cigar, and laughed a little. [...] "Well, I'm talking {{like a fool}} again. There <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> can't help it. It's a way of mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope not, father," [...] she sighed, {{a little}} wistfully. [...] "There <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> am very {{dissatisfied}} with myself, and to-night, I am afraid, {{is one of}} them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he remarked, [...] "there have <b>been</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> have cursed {{myself for}} a fool, but, on the whole, {{sentiment}} keeps many fires burning." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I got it for myself," [...] {{she said}} coldly. [...] "There have <b>been</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{have felt that}} the {{possession}} of something of that sort was an absolute necessity." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes; I {{understand}} it all. But there <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> feel bitterly {{the necessity of}} remaining in hiding, as if I {{was in fact a}} criminal. Have you any more news?" ...|$|E
60|$|DAN. So {{like you}} that there <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> almost wish I had never met you. You set me {{thinking}} about myself, {{and that is a}} subject I find it pleasanter to forget.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps not," [...] she admitted. [...] "Perhaps {{even now}} {{it is only a}} mood with me. I can only speak as I feel for the moment. There <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> feel differently, but not now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The spirit for adventure," [...] Arnold {{repeated}} quietly. [...] "Well, {{there have}} <b>been</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> thought I had that, {{but it certainly}} {{never occurred to me}} to go out and rob." ...|$|R

5000|$|Two singles were {{released}} before the album's release. The first single was [...] "Never Gone," [...] released as a promotional single on September 25, 2012.

6000|$|... "That's so," [...] conceded the Story Girl. [...] "There <b>ARE</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> can't think {{anything}} but gray thoughts. Then, other days, I think pink {{and blue and}} gold and purple and rainbow thoughts all the time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not one, Mr. Burns," [...] I said. [...] "There is no {{breath to}} spare on board this ship for that. Are {{you aware that}} there <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> can't muster more than three hands to do anything?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah, dear lady, that is {{not soon}} done! You and Mistress Anne, as you well know, first awoke me from my firm belief that I {{was none other than}} an elf, and yet there have since <b>been</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> have doubted whether it were not indeed the truth." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You wouldn't find it so," [...] he said. [...] "It {{is not a}} {{place for}} such as you. It is a life of lies and {{gambling}} and deceit. There <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> have hated it. I hate it now!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am hard sometimes," [...] Philippa confessed. [...] "You {{know that}} quite well. There <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> just {{feel as though}} I had no heart at all, nor any sympathy; when every {{sensation}} I might have had seems shrivelled up inside me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she said, quietly, [...] "it {{was a great}} responsibility, {{and there}} <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> horribly afraid.

5000|$|... “There <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{thought about}} getting out, but I decided that I could best utilize my {{training}} {{right here in}} the service,” Col.

6000|$|... "I love you," [...] he said; [...] "I {{have known}} it since I have known you, but you must see why I could not tell you so.
