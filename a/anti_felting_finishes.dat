2500|$|Unlike the {{majority}} of surviving mantuas, which are made of the rich brocaded silks popular {{at the turn of}} the 18th century, the Kimberley mantua is a practical winter costume, made of striped woolen fabric embroidered with silver-gilt yarns. The fabric, sometimes described as broadcloth, is actually a [...] "soft, fine, tabby-woven (over one, under one) woolen fabric that has been given a napped surface though not the dense, <b>felted</b> <b>finish</b> characteristic of broadcloth." [...] The background color is something between [...] "brownish" [...] and [...] "warm grey". The stripes, woven parallel to the weft (across the width of the fabric), are [...] "ultramarine" [...] blue [...] "bordered by vibrant terracotta" [...] and [...] "dark mustard yellow" [...] "bordered by a pair of magenta stripes".|$|R
5000|$|Voltaire's {{first race}} as a three-year-old was The Shorts, a Sweepstakes of 50 sovereigns each over one mile at York. He started at the 1/2 {{favourite}} and ridden by J. Day, he won the race from Penhill, with Elastic finishing in third place. He was one on nineteen horses to contest the St. Leger Stakes at Doncaster in August. Rowton started the race as the favourite, with Frederick and Voltaire next at 4/1. Ridden by William Scott, Rowton took the lead {{a long way from}} the finish. Voltaire closed on the leader, but was still some distance behind as they entered the final furlong. Voltaire steadily closed on Rowton, who was being hard ridden, but could only finish second, a neck behind Rowton. Sir Hercules was third, with <b>Felt</b> <b>finishing</b> in fourth.|$|R
50|$|The {{merchandise}} {{brought from}} Yunnan by the Panthay caravaneers included silk cloth, tea, metal utensils, iron in the rough, <b>felts,</b> <b>finished</b> articles of' clothing, walnuts, opium, wax, preserved fruits and foods, and dried meat of' several kinds.

Raw cotton, which was reserved as a royal monopoly, was in great demand in China. An extensive trade in this commodity had existed between the Burmese kingdom and Yunnan. It was transported up the Ayeyarwaddy River to Bhamo where it was sold to the Chinese merchants, and conveyed partly by land and partly by water into Yunnan, {{and from there to}} other provinces of China. Most caravans consisted of between fifty and one hundred mules, employing ten to fifteen drivers.|$|R
5000|$|Love Life was {{completed}} in ten days. Tamia rented recording studios in Atlanta, where she used two studios to record simultaneously. She booked sessions with several producers such as The Stereotypes, Chuck Harmony, Polow da Don, and Lil Ronnie {{to work with them}} in different rooms. Writing of the songs evolved largely spontaneously; the teams would afterwards only record tracks they seriously envisioned for inclusion on the album though. Initially worried about the short recording period, Tamia would later feel confirmed in her decision when her husband reminded her that rapper Jay-Z had used similar methods of collaborating when he produced his critically acclaimed 2001 album The Blueprint [...] "in a weekend”. Recounting on the experience in the production, Tamia later stated in interview: [...] "When it felt like we were finished, I was like 'I think this project is done'. I could have recorded 15 other songs, but this project <b>felt</b> <b>finished</b> to me. It felt weird to say that after ten days." ...|$|R

50|$|Qutayba's Muslims obliterated and triumphed {{over the}} union of several Ferghana staet as fierce {{fighting}} took place in Sogdian Samarkand and Khorezm against Qutayba ibn Muslim. An easier time was had in the conquest of Bukhara. Under Ghurak, Sogdian Samarkand was forced to capitulate to the joint Arab-Kharazmian and Bukharan forces of Qutayba. The obliteration of idols was ordered by Qutayba along {{with the construction of}} a Mosque, 30,000 slaves and 2,200,000 dirhams.

50|$|Broadcloth is {{so called}} {{not because it}} is {{finished}} wide, 54 inches not being particularly wide, but because it was woven nearly half as wide again and shrunk down to finish 54 inches. This shrinking, or milling, process made the cloth very dense, bringing all the threads very tightly together, and gave a <b>felted</b> blind <b>finish</b> to the cloth. These factors meant that it was harder wearing, more weatherproof and could take a raw edge; the hems of the garment could be simply cut and left without hemming as the threads were so heavily shrunk together as to prevent fraying.|$|R

However, they changed the title as she had been calling it We Who Are About To Die, which she preferred. She was concerned that calling the novel Web of the Romulans might confuse readers into thinking {{it had something to do}} with the episode [...] "The Tholian Web". It had been changed because Pocket Books had another book coming out with a similar title, although Murdock suspected that they had also published several books with [...] "Web" [...] in the title during that year.|$|R

Marian alone, thanks to her bottle of liquor and her stoutness of build, stood the strain upon back and arms without suffering.

According to Hamasaki, she wanted to reflect the emotion and words used in each 100,000 messages she received from her fans to create the song, but because there were numerous emails, she decided to write it as a summary and her feelings as an [...] "aftermath" [...] from reading the messages. The song was described by a staff member at CD Journal as an [...] "organic midtempo pop ballad" [...] song. [...] "Appears" [...] was remixed by Japanese group HΛL.

50|$|New {{materials}} {{used on the}} library were detailed in the May/June 1961 issue of Building Materials, which featured the building. Such materials included Rotary Red Cedar Exterior plywood panelling, also featured in the Plywood and Plywood Products journal of September 1961. The roof membrane of the library was formed with 2 inch thick laminated fibre board clad with bituminous <b>felt</b> and <b>finished</b> with white grain render and a copper fascia. When completed, the centre point of {{the roof of the}} building was finished with an amber acrylic light dome, apparently the largest acrylic dome produced in Australia at the time. Machinery connected to the upper most level of glazing surrounding the building allowed the windows to be mechanically opened. Installed in the ceiling of the library were two concentric light troughs formed with fluorescent tubes between purlins concealed with a translucent acrylic sheeting, operating {{in much the same way}} internal lighting operates with most current suspended ceiling systems. As well there were a number of suspended lighting features of circular fluorescent tubes fixed together on a light framework.|$|R

Nina personally insisted [...] "Anything for You" [...] to be included on the track list. During the recording, she admitted that the most difficult song to sing was [...] "Through the Fire", knowing that it requires high vocal registers. She called the video shoot [...] "fun," [...] considering that the director, Ancheta, is kind and still young. They just jammed to it. Nina Live! was not really recorded in a live concert format.

5000|$|By {{the halfway}} point of the mens race, Mutai, Kimetto, Geoffrey Kipsang and Maiyo were still in contention. Mutai {{pulled away from the}} pack, along with Kimetto, after 30 km. Kimetto {{remained}} close to the leader put never overtook him, leaving Mutai to take the title (and the World Marathon Majors jackpot) by a margin of second with his winning time of 2:04:15 hours. The times of the Kenyan pair were the fastest recorded that year and the fourth and fifth fastest ever at that point. Despite the fast times of the mens race, some reporters <b>felt</b> the <b>finish</b> to be an anti-climax - both Mutai and Kimetto slowed in the final kilometres and neither pushed the other into a sprint finish, even though they finished one second apart. The Guardians Ross Tucker remarked that the positions seemed [...] "pre-planned" [...] between the training partners. Geoffrey Kipsang comfortably took third place with a time of 2:06:12 for his debut run. The top nine men were all Kenyan, with Japans Masakazu Fujiwara rounding out the top ten places.|$|R

40|$|Encounters are {{politically}} and pedagogically charged. They {{have long been}} celebrated {{for their ability to}} chip away at prejudices, enact cultural destabilisations, shape subjectivities, and produce new knowledges. Yet encounters come with risk. The paper argues that encounters should be taken as very specific genres of contact and offers a conceptual interrogation of the notion of encounter, and its (dis) organisation, as a way of reflecting on the paradox of ‘organised encounter’. In particular, the paper suggests that the promise and hope of organised encounter stands in tension with the recognition that encounters are inherently unpredictable –that they are about rupture and surprise. Taking this tension forward, the paper asks what possibilities remain for forms of planned encounter in intercultural contexts and focuses on two concerns. First, a concern with what happens when something that is inherently unpredictable becomes a site of intervention and secondly, a concern with the risks of encounter, and for whom the risks are most acutely <b>felt.</b> It <b>finishes</b> by reflecting on what it might mean to keep hold of the unpredictability of encounter in organised settings and what it means for questions of difference, power, and privilege...|$|R

[...] He stated in the liner notes for Piano Collections Final Fantasy VI that he intended the music to be emotionally moving, and entreated the listener {{not to think about the}} music, but to feel it. He also feels that the title track for Final Fantasy VI was the most challenging track he has ever made. As for Final Fantasy VI Grand Finale, on the other hand, Uematsu has said that he was [...] "not satisfied with this album at all", due to the deviation it took from his original visions for the music due to his lack of personal involvement in the arrangements.
