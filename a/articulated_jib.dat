The study involves: 1) {{formation}} of an array of geometry, weight and variable data for the automated synthesis of <b>articulated</b> <b>jib</b> systems; 2) development of methodology of calculation and determination of rational design parameters of the <b>articulated</b> <b>jib</b> systems, depending on the main technical parameters of the portal crane (maximum and minimum working radius, cargo lift height, tail radius value, carrying capacity of crane); 3) conducting {{of the study of}} the methodology adequacy on computer portal crane models. Methodology. To determine the kinematic characteristics of each link of the <b>articulated</b> <b>jib</b> system (boom, arm, jib tie, counterweight, load) we developed a dynamic and mathematical models that allow us to describe the movement of the <b>articulated</b> <b>jib</b> system when luffing. For the first time the technique of calculation and determination of rational design parameters of the <b>articulated</b> <b>jib</b> systems depending on the technical parameters of the portal crane. Findings. The conducted mathematical modeling allowed scientifically proving the usefulness of the proposed methodology for determining the design parameters of the <b>articulated</b> <b>jib</b> systems. The designed package of geometry, weight and variable data helps to simplify the process of preparatory calculations before the automated synthesis and to optimize the design of the <b>articulated</b> <b>jib</b> systems of portal cranes. Originality. For the first time the work proposes the technique for calculation of the parametric data that allow us to determine the rational design parameters of the <b>articulated</b> <b>jib</b> system. There are developed local programs for the integrated optimization synthesis that make it possible to select the best design option simultaneously by several quality criteria and functional constraints. Practical value. The proposed method of calculating the design parameters can be used in the design of new and modernization of existing portal cranes with the <b>articulated</b> <b>jib</b> systems, which, in turn, will reduce the material and energy consumption of the cranes...|$|E
