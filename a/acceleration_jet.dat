40|$|Radio {{observations}} play a {{key role}} in studying the jets that power GRBs, the most luminous cosmic explosions. They are crucial for determining the GRB jet energy, the external density, and the microphysical parameters of relativistic collisionless shocks, from afterglow broadband modeling. Radio image size measurements are rare, but provide extremely useful information. The "radio flare" peaking after ~ 1 day helps constrain the magnetisation and magnetic-field structure of GRB outflows. This review discusses the current observational and modeling status, focusing on the afterglow and outlining prompt radio emission searches, along with recent theoretical progress in GRB jet dynamics, focusing on magnetic <b>acceleration,</b> <b>jet</b> propagation inside a massive star progenitor (for long GRBs), the reverse shock, and the late afterglow. Great progress has been made in our understanding of magnetic acceleration, collimation and later sideways expansion of GRB jets, with interesting implications for the prompt, reverse shock, and afterglow emission. We outline how theory and observations were combined to study GRB jet physics and their immediate environment. Finally, potential paths are suggested for combining theory and observations to achieve greater progress, and some prospects for the future are discussed in light of the expected improvements in observational capabilities and theoretical advances...|$|E

40|$|I review {{constraints}} on the physical properties of AGN jets revealed through Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) studies of the structure and time-evolution of parsec-scale jets, including recent results from the MOJAVE program. In particular I focus on constraints available from very long time baseline studies which probe {{a wide range of}} jet behavior over many outbursts. Kinematic studies of propagating jet features find an apparent speed distribution that peaks around 10 c for blazars, with speeds up to 50 c observed. These observed speeds require Lorentz factors at least as large, implying that parsec-scale Lorentz factors up to 10 - 20 are common for blazars with a tail up to ~ 50. Jet flows are still becoming organized on these scales as evidenced by the high incidence of non-radial motions and/or <b>accelerations</b> of <b>jet</b> features (including increases and decreases in apparent speed and direction). Changes in Lorentz factors of propagating jet features appear to {{play a significant role in}} the observed accelerations, and while the connection between <b>acceleration</b> of <b>jet</b> features and the underlying flow is not clear, the pattern of observed accelerations suggest the flow may increase in speed near the base of the jet and decrease further out. In some jets, ejections of new features span a range of ejection angles over many epochs, tracing out wider opening angles on parsec-scales than are apparent in single epoch observations.

However, {{due to the}} lack of guidance of theoretical model, precise deposition of micro/nano fibers could only accomplished by experience. To analyze the behavior of charged jet in NFES using mathematical model, the momentum balance equation was simplified and a new expression between jet cross-sectional radius and axial position was derived. Using this new expression and mass conservation equation, expressions for jet cross-sectional radius and velocity were derived in terms of axial position and initial <b>jet</b> <b>acceleration</b> in the form of exponential functions. Based on Slender-body theory and Giesekus model, a quadratic equation for initial <b>jet</b> <b>acceleration</b> was acquired.

40|$|Supermassive {{black hole}} binary (SMBHB) is {{expected}} with the hierarchical galaxy formation model. Currently, physics processes dominating {{the evolution of}} a SMBHB are unclear. An interesting question is whether we could observationally determine the evolution of SMBHB and give constraints on the physical processes. Jet precession have been observed in many AGNs and generally attributed to disk precession. In this paper we calculate the time variation of jet precession and conclude that jet precession is accelerated in SMBHB systems but decelerated in others. The <b>acceleration</b> of <b>jet</b> precession dP_ pr / dt is related to jet precession timescale P_ pr and SMBHB evolution timescale τ_ a, dP_ pr dt≃ - ΛP_ prτ_ a. Our calculations based on the models for jet precession and SMBHB evolution show that dP_ pr / dt can be as high as about - 1. 0 with a typical value - 0. 2 and can be easily detected. We discussed the differential jet precession for NGC 1275 observed in the literature. If the observed rapid <b>acceleration</b> of <b>jet</b> precession is true, the jet precession is due to the orbital motion of an unbound SMBHB with mass ratio q≈ 0. 76. When jets precessed from the ancient bubbles to the currently active jets, the separation of SMBHB decrease from about 1. 46 Kpc to 0. 80 Kpc with an averaged decreasing velocity da/dt ≃ - 1. 54 × 10 ^ 6 cm/s and evolution timescale τ_ a≈ 7. 5 × 10 ^ 7 yr.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. We {{sought to}} determine, using serial echocardiography, the {{hydrodynamic}} mechanisms {{involved in the}} occurrence of hemolysis after mitral valve repair. Background. Recently, fluid dynamic simulation models have identified distinct patterns of mitral regurgitant flow disturbances in patients with mitral prosthetic hemolysis that were associated with high shear stress and may therefore produce clinical hemolysis. Rapid acceleration, fragmentation, and collision jets were associated with high shear stress and hemolysis whereas slow deceleration and free jets were not. Methods. We reviewed serial echocardiographic studies of 13 consecutive patients with hemolytic anemia after mitral valve repair who were referred for mitral reoperation between January 1985 and December 1996 (group 1). Thirteen patients undergoing reoperation for mitral regurgitation after mitral valve repair but without hemolysis served as controls (group 2). Results. The mitral regurgitant jet was central in origin in 12 group 1 patients and 9 group 2 patients (Fisher exact test, p = 0. 3). The other patients had para-ring regurgitation. Group 1 patients had collision (n = 11), rapid acceleration (n = 2) or fragmentation (n = 1) jets whereas group 2 patients had slow deceleration (n = 11) or free jets (n = 2) (Fisher exact test, p < 0. 0001). One patient with hemolysis had both collision and rapid <b>acceleration</b> <b>jets.</b> The “culprit” jet could be identified on the postbypass transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) study in only 1 patient {{at the time of}} initial mitral repair. Twelve group 1 patients underwent reoperation, with subsequent resolution of hemolysis in all patients. At reoperation, the initial repair was found to be intact in 8 (67 %) patients. Conclusion. Distinct patterns of flow disturbance associated with high shear stress were identified by color Doppler imaging in patients with hemolysis after mitral valve repair. The majority (92 %) of these color flow disturbances were not present during intraoperative postbypass TEE study after initial mitral repair and subsequently developed in the early postoperative period...|$|R

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{possibility}} that gamma-ray bursts may result from cosmological relativistic blob emitting neutron star jets that precess past the line of sight. Beaming reduces the energy requirements, so that the jet emission can last longer than the observed burst duration. One precession mode maintains a short duration time scale, while a second keeps the beam from returning {{to the line of}} sight, consistent with the paucity of repeaters. The long life of these objects reduces the number required for production as compared to short lived jets. Blobs can account for the time structure of the bursts. Here we focus largely on kinematic and time scale considerations of beaming, precession, and blobs [...] issues which are reasonably independent of the <b>acceleration</b> and <b>jet</b> collimation mechanisms. We do suggest that large amplitude electro-magnetic waves could be a source of blob acceleration. Comment: 15 pages, plain TeX, accepted to ApJ...|$|R

An incompressible model for the instability akin to the Boussinesq approximation for convection is given which predicts the behaviour of the instability accurately. Global axisymmetric disturbances are also considered and found to be stable for a certain class of models.

High-energy emission is generated, typically within the optically thick core, in the outer parts of the broad-line emission region, avoiding the radiative drag on the faster parts of the flow.
