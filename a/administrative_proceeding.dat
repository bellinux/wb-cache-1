40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to look into how {{evidence}} evaluation in verdicts considering 2 § LVU (Care of Young Persons Act) linked to honor related problems are handled by the County Administrative Court of Stockholm. The questions at issue were how the County Administrative Court handles the prerequisites regarding 2 § LVU verdicts, how the County <b>Administrative</b> Court <b>proceeds</b> when evaluating evidence in 2 § LVU verdicts, and how the County Administrative Court handles indications of that a child is living in an honor-related context. To answer this, five verdicts have been analyzed. In addition to this, two interviews were made as a complement. In the analysis of the collected material, the authors proceeded from a theory of evidence and used a hermeneutic method for the analysis. Through the study, it has been observed that the court doesn’t seem to use any verified method to evaluate evidence. Further on, the results show that the court, in their verdicts, seems to prefer to assign to the most general prerequisite in the actual paragraph and doesn’t refer or even mention honor in the verdicts. The authors believe these circumstances make it difficult for the parties in the lawsuit to understand how the court has reached its judgement...|$|R

40|$|Data on {{individual}} patients collected through {{state and federal}} health information exchanges {{has the potential to}} usher in a new era of drug regulation. These exchanges, produced by recent health care reform legislation, will amass an unprecedented amount of clinical information on drug usage, demographic variables, and patient outcomes. This information could aid the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") with post-market drug surveillance because it more accurately reflects clinical practice outcomes than the trials the FDA relies upon for drug approval. However, even with this data available, the market-driven impetus to use it to police drugs is weak. This is fixable; the post-market drug regulatory process needs new incentives to boost third party participation. While a variety of mechanisms could achieve this, the best option for generating robust results may be an <b>administrative</b> bounty <b>proceeding</b> that will allow third parties to submit evidence to the FDA to contest the claimed safety and efficacy profiles of drugs already on the market. This Article uses a case study of Merck's former blockbuster drug Vioxx to demonstrate how this system might work. In creating a new incentive that counters the powerful financial motivation of drug manufacturers to obscure or misrepresent safety profiles, the proposed bounty proceeding could lead to an improved balance of the risks and benefits of drugs used by the American public. More broadly, this Article illustrates how to create an incentive for the private sector to supplement regulatory activity in a complex field...|$|R

5000|$|After a {{four-year}} moratorium on executions in California, multiple proceedings in federal court, a state <b>administrative</b> law <b>proceeding,</b> and state court appeals, it is incredible {{to think that}} the deliberative process might be driven by the expiration date of the execution drug. U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, 2010 [...] It is absurd that our legal system continues to prevent the state from carrying out the will of the people. CA Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, 2010 On September 27, Marin County judge Verna Adams denied a defense request to stop the execution. An appeal for clemency was forwarded to California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Prosecutor Rod Pacheco wrote to Schwarzenegger urging him not to intervene. The governor refused Brown's request to commute the sentence to life imprisonment without parole, but delayed the execution to 9 p.m. on September 30 to provide appeals courts more time to review the case. Brown alleged that he suffered child abuse that should have been brought up at his trial. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ordered Fogel to revisit the case because California law specified that the inmate should only choose between the gas chamber and lethal injection, not the drugs themselves. Fogel admitted his offer to Brown was [...] "ill-advised" [...] and halted the execution to permit time to determine whether the new injection procedures addressed defense arguments of cruel and unusual punishment. The appeals court also noted that the prison's supply of sodium thiopental, a drug required for lethal injection, was expiring on October 1. A state appeal to resume the execution by 7 p.m. on September 30 was unanimously denied by the California Supreme Court. California and other states had run short of the drug because the manufacturer Hospira is unable to meet demand at least until January 2011 because of raw material supply issues. State attorney general Jerry Brown (no relation) recommended halting execution proceedings until necessary supplies were secured. His office stated that a new date would be scheduled as soon as legally possible.|$|R

40|$|This paper compares and {{analyzes}} the incentive structure of Ontario and British Columbia’s civil asset forfeiture regimes. Part one surveys the American civil forfeiture experience {{to draw out}} theoretical considerations from American academia and inform a discussion of Canadian law. Part two compares the Ontario and British Columbia civil forfeiture regimes and identifies institutional incentives and barriers embedded {{in the framework of}} the forfeiture regimes in each province. Part three uses empirical data to explain how Ontario and British Columbia’s incentive structures affect civil forfeiture’s use. The paper argues there is an optimal allocation of resources towards the use of civil forfeiture, and that such optimization is ultimately influenced by the province’s incentive structure. Finally, part four undertakes a discussion of the potential effects that the inefficient use of civil forfeiture may have on the broader economy.

40|$|This {{proposal}} for legal development argues {{the need for}} a constitutional requirement for employing a modified ‘two-way test of non-analogousness and prior art treatment of ineligible discoveries’ to determine patent eligibility for DNA and cDNA. The statutory pedigree of the test dates back to Justice Story’s Doctrine of Intellectual Creation which serves the purpose to assure that uncreative applications or modifications to intellectual discoveries lack originality under the United States Constitution. The test demands that a creative advance must be made to an ineligible scientific discovery in order to meet patent eligibility requirements under 35 U. S. C. § 101. A ‘patent eligibility matrix’ is proposed utilizing the ‘modified two-way test’ applied towards a wide range of organisms or genes including whether the DNA or cDNA is either from that of a human, plant, or bacteria, and whether the genes are eukaryotic or prokaryotic in nature, or genetically modified or not. The constitutional requirement for such an analysis is then examined using the plain language of recently repealed 35 U. S. C. § 102 (f) to uncover an ambiguous overlap between 35 U. S. C. § 101. Legislative intent is then analyzed in addressing limited monopolization of ideas presented in light of Myriad, and is used to bolster the argument that there exists a constitutional requirement for employing the ‘modified two-way test’ for patent eligibility of DNA or cDNA of living organisms or genes. The overall aim {{of this article is to}} provide guidance on how judicial and <b>administrative</b> development should <b>proceed</b> in light of Diamond and Myriad while also putting forth suggestions as to what the requisite degree of patent eligibility standards should be applied...|$|R
