Using a step motor, the system takes images from the lowest focal plane {{in the field of}} view to the highest focal plane. Then it reconstructs theses images into a 3D model based on contrast to give a 3D color image of the sample. From these 3D model measurements can be made, but their accuracy is based on the step motor and depth of field of the lens. The step motor is necessary to get accurate height information and accuracy is higher with a shallower depth of field. The most accurate 3D measurement from a step motor for a digital microscope is 1 micrometres.The 3D measurement abilities include, {{but are not limited to}} height, length, <b>angle,</b> <b>radius,</b> volume and area.

In addition to this vertical web-extent asymmetry, orb webs show vertical asymmetries in number of spiral loops, mesh widths, and <b>angles</b> between <b>radii.</b> However, it was unknown whether these asymmetries are adaptations to the web-extent asymmetry or whether they are linked to gravity in a different way than through web-extent asymmetry. We reviewed known vertical asymmetries of orb webs, and we analysed the asymmetries of webs built by four different Cyclosa species, which show large intra- and interspecific variation in web-extent asymmetry. We found all analysed structural asymmetries to be linked both to web-extent asymmetry and to gravity: Larger web extents below the hub and gravity both led to more sticky-spiral loops and to smaller <b>angles</b> between <b>radii</b> below the hub, whereas web-extent asymmetry and gravity had opposing effects on mesh width (mean and peripheral). Independent of web-extent asymmetry, almost all analyzed webs had narrower peripheral meshes and smaller <b>angles</b> between <b>radii</b> below the hub than above. We interpret the narrow peripheral meshes along the web's lower edge as an adaptation to prevent tumbling prey from escaping, and the small <b>angles</b> between <b>radii</b> as an adaptation to prevent the sticky spiral lines in these narrow meshes to come into contact with each other...|$|R

Study design: Three hundred and seventy-six molars, {{with a total of}} 1114 root canals, extracted were instrumented by undergraduate students using ProTaper instruments according to the manufacturer´s recommendations. When fracture occurred, data were collected concerning the number of uses, type of instrument, level of fracture, <b>angle</b> and <b>radius</b> of curvature.

As N increases, within each section the effects of inertia force and viscosity become reduced comparing to that of the liquid-gas surface tension. Unlike the conventional Young–Laplace approach (i. e., N = 1), the new approach is able to predict the bubble characteristics reliably in the following cases: (a) the oscillatory period when bubble is fluctuating; (b) the departure period when bubble is stretched upward, right before departure; and (c) the high shear stress condition when gas velocity is relatively high...|$|E

A modal expansion {{is used for}} the normal displacement that satisfies the boundary conditions for the normal displacement exactly, but the boundary conditions for the in-plane displacements are satisfied approximately by an averaging technique. Galerkin technique is used to reduce the problem to a system of coupled non-linear ordinary differential equations for the modal amplitudes. These non-linear differential equations are solved for arbitrary initial conditions by using the multiple-time-scaling technique. Explicit values of the coefficients that appear in the forementioned Galerkin system of equations are given, in terms of non-dimensional parameters characterizing the shell geometry and material properties, for a three mode case, for which results for specific initial conditions are presented.

40|$|Helical ribbons {{arise in}} many {{biological}} and engineered systems, often driven by anisotropic surface stress, residual strain, and geometric or elastic mismatch between layers of a laminated composite. A full mathematical analysis is developed to analytically predict the equilibrium deformed helical {{shape of an}} initially flat, straight ribbon, with prescribed magnitudes and orientations of the principal curvatures when subjected to arbitrary surface stress and/or internal residual strain distribution. The helix <b>angle,</b> <b>radius,</b> axis and chirality of the deformed helical ribbons are predicted with a comprehensive, three-dimensional model that incorporates elasticity, differential geometry, and variational principles. In general, the mechanical anisotropy (e. g., in surface/external stress, residual strain or elastic modulus) will lead to spontaneous, three-dimensional helical deformations. Ring shapes are formed when the principle axes of deformation coincide with the geometric axes of the ribbon.
