25|$|That {{triangular}} runway outline {{is perfectly}} preserved at Claresholm Industrial Airport, {{but is still}} easily visible under later runway extensions at most Canadian BCATP airports, such as Kingston/Norman Rogers <b>Airport,</b> <b>Boundary</b> Bay Airport and Pendelton, Ontario airport. Later modifications have often resulted in one runway being lengthened to handle larger aircraft such as jets, and in less-used runways being closed or converted to taxiways.|$|E
25|$|Airport management's {{proposal}} for a second runway (south of the existing runway and <b>airport</b> <b>boundary)</b> were unveiled in July 2013. This was shortlisted for further consideration by the Airports Commission in December 2013, and the commission's final report was published in July 2015. Another proposal would extend the North Terminal south, with a passenger bridge in the area currently occupied by aircraft stands without jet bridges. Gatwick's draft master plan (released for consultation on 13 October 2011) apparently dropped the passenger-bridge plan in favour of a mid-field satellite (next to the control tower) linking to the North Terminal {{as part of an}} expanded 2030 single-runway, two-terminal airport.|$|E

25|$|In its {{original}} consultation document published on 23 July 2002 the Government decided to expand Stansted and Heathrow, but not Gatwick. However, Medway Council, Kent County Council and Essex County Council sought a {{judicial review of}} this decision. The judge reviewing the lawfulness of the Government's decision ruled that excluding Gatwick from the original consultation was irrational and/or unfair. Following the judge's ruling and the Secretary of State for Transport's decision not to appeal, BAA published new consultation documents. These included an option of a possible second runway at Gatwick {{to the south of}} the existing <b>airport</b> <b>boundary,</b> leaving the villages Charlwood and Hookwood {{to the north of the}} airport intact. This led to protests about increased noise and pollution, demolition of houses and destruction of villages.|$|E
500|$|Witnesses {{also said}} they heard two {{explosive}} noises, the first as the aircraft [...] "crossed the <b>airport</b> <b>boundary</b> and the second when the aircraft was about halfway between the airport and the crash site." [...] Although most witnesses described the smoke as white or grey, two witnesses said black smoke and flames were visible {{at the rear of}} the aircraft. According to witness statements, the aircraft climbed to a height of between [...] and , before the nose began to rise. One said the aircraft was [...] "wobbling" [...] and another said they thought the aircraft had stalled. The aircraft impacted with the roof of a three-storey apartment building before it crashed into a wooded ravine approximately 250 feet from busy Buford Highway, a major Atlanta road lined with apartments. All five passengers and two crew members were killed in the accident, and an individual on the ground, standing in a parking lot, sustained serious burns from aviation fuel and remained in a critical condition for a day after the accident. The apartment building was damaged, and several parked vehicles destroyed.|$|E
2500|$|Operating a {{scheduled}} passenger flight to Bournemouth, the Bristol 170 {{was preparing for}} takeoff from Guernsey Airport's runway 28. The first officer, who was flying the aircraft used full power to counteract {{the effects of a}} [...] crosswind. Due to a problem with the port engine the First officer decided to abort takeoff as speed approached 80 knots. As the aircraft was going to overshoot the end of the runway he steered it to the left to avoid hitting obstacles. The aircraft became airborne for a short distance, crashing through the <b>airport</b> <b>boundary</b> fence, crossing a public road and coming to a halt {{a quarter of a mile}} from the runway end. Although the aircraft was a complete write-off, there were no fatalities among the four occupants (three crew and one passenger).|$|E

2500|$|On 23 July 2013, Gatwick {{unveiled}} its {{proposals for}} a second runway {{to the south of}} the existing runway and <b>airport</b> <b>boundary.</b> If approved, the new runway could open by 2025 and cost between £5billion and £9billion, depending on the option chosen – i.e., a new runway [...] south of the existing runway, a new runway less than [...] but more than [...] south of the existing runway or a new runway less than [...] south of the existing runway. The first option would allow both runways to be simultaneously used for takeoffs and landings and increase total runway capacity by more than 80% to up to 100 aircraft movements per hour. It would also increase the airport's annual maximum passenger capacity from the present 45 to 87million. The second option would allow both runways to be used simultaneously as well, with one handling takeoffs and the other landings. This would increase total runway capacity by ca. 36% to about 75 aircraft movements per hour and result in an increase in annual maximum passenger capacity to 82million. The third option would allow only one runway to be used at a time but would still increase total runway capacity by over 20% to at least 67 aircraft movements per hour and annual maximum passenger capacity to 66million. Regardless of the option chosen, the total projected cost includes the cost of a third terminal next to the existing railway line.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are five}} extant {{churches in the}} parish. [...] St Peter's in West Green predates the New Town, having been built between 1892 and 1893 to a design by {{architect}} W. Hilton Nash. [...] Richard Cook, owner of one of Crawley's main building firms, constructed it. [...] It replaced a chapel of ease to St Margaret's Church, Ifield: although West Green was in the parish of Ifield at the time, it was remote from the parish church. [...] Although the Diocese of Chichester would not pay for a separate church, it accepted St Peter's, which was built with private money, when it was offered. [...] The church later gained its own parish, which was then absorbed by the parish of St John the Baptist. [...] St Elizabeth's in {{the centre of the}} Northgate neighbourhood was built in 1965, and like St John the Baptist's follows a [...] "Modern Catholic" [...] style of worship. [...] St Richard's is another modern church serving the Three Bridges neighbourhood. [...] A fifth church, St Michael and All Angels, is notionally within the parish but is no longer used for Anglican worship. William Burges designed and built this yellow sandstone 13th century-style French Gothic church in 1867 to serve the village of Lowfield Heath, which was then in the parish of Charlwood in Surrey. [...] The establishment and rapid development of Gatwick Airport next to Lowfield Heath swamped the small village, eventually destroying it: all buildings except the church, which was listed at Grade II* in 1948, were demolished to make way for warehouses and extensions to the <b>airport</b> <b>boundary.</b> [...] (The church is approximately [...] from the runway.) [...] The Diocese of Chichester stopped using the church for services in 2004; in March 2008 it allowed a Seventh-day Adventist congregation to use the building as its place of worship. Horley Seventh-Day Adventist Church was formed as a church plant in May 2005 and was formally established in January 2008.|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{relative}} {{hazards of}} wildlife to aircraft {{is important for}} developing effective management programs that can minimize hazards from wildlife strikes. Although interspecific differences in hazard level of birds and mammals on airport properties are described, no studies have quantified hazard level of bird species or identified factors that influence hazard level when birds are struck beyond <b>airport</b> <b>boundaries</b> (e. g., during aircraft climb or approach). We used Federal Aviation Administration National Wildlife Strike Database records from 1990 through 31 May 2014 to identify bird species involved most often in collisions with aircraft beyond <b>airport</b> <b>boundaries</b> in the United States and to quantify the interspecific hazard level of those birds. We also investigated whether body mass, group size (single or multiple birds), region (Flyway), and season influenced the likelihood of aircraft damage and substantial damage when strikes occurred using binary logistic regression analysis. Canada geese (Branta canadensis; n= 327), turkey vultures (Cathartes aura; 217), American robins (Turdus migratorius; 119), and mallards (Anas platyrhynchos; 107) were struck most often by aircraft beyond <b>airport</b> <b>boundaries.</b> Waterbirds (cormorants, ducks, geese, {{and to a lesser}} extent, gulls) and raptors (including vultures) were most likely to cause damage or substantial damage to aircraft when strikes occurred. Body mass was an important predictor of hazard level; group size, region, and season had lesser effects on hazard level. Management strategies to reduce bird strikes with aircraft beyond airport properties should be active throughout the year and prioritize waterbirds and raptors. Published 2016. This article is a U.
