40|$|The taxis {{response}} of Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2. 4. 1 and 2. 4. 3, Rhodopseudomonas palustris, and Agrobacterium tumefaciens to nitrate and nitrite was evaluated by observing the macroscopic behavior of cells suspended in soft agar and incubated under various conditions. R. sphaeroides 2. 4. 3, which {{is capable of}} both nitrate and nitrite reduction, showed <b>a</b> <b>taxis</b> response <b>to</b> both nitrate and nitrite. R. sphaeroides 2. 4. 1, which contains nitrate reductase but not nitrite reductase, did not show <b>a</b> <b>taxis</b> response towards either nitrogen oxide. Insertional inactivation of the nitrite reductase structural gene or its transcriptional regulator, NnrR, in strain 2. 4. 3 caused a loss of <b>a</b> <b>taxis</b> response towards both nitrate and nitrite. An isolate of 2. 4. 1 carrying {{a copy of the}} nitrite reductase gene from 2. 4. 3 showed <b>a</b> <b>taxis</b> response <b>to</b> both nitrogen oxides. The taxis {{response of}} 2. 4. 3 was observed under anaerobic conditions, suggesting that the taxis response was due to nitrate and nitrite respiration, not to inhibition of oxygen respiration by respiration of nitrogen oxides. Strain 2. 4. 3 showed <b>a</b> <b>taxis</b> response <b>to</b> nitrate and nitrite under photosynthetic and aerobic conditions. Changing the carbon source in the culture medium caused an unexpected subtle shift in the taxis response of 2. 4. 3 <b>to</b> nitrite. <b>A</b> <b>taxis</b> response <b>to</b> nitrogen oxides was also observed in R. palustris and A. tumefaciens. R. palustris exhibited <b>a</b> <b>taxis</b> response <b>to</b> nitrite but not to nitrate, while A. tumefaciens exhibited a response to both compounds...|$|R
