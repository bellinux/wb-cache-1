5|$|Once the British {{were aware}} of the leak, they were {{concerned}} that Cicero had leaked information that might help crack the British cipher, but that did not occur.

5|$|Shortly {{after midnight}} on October 8, optimistic field reports expecting an {{imminent}} Egyptian collapse caused Gonen to alter {{plans for the}} attack.

The change was not formulated on precise tactical intelligence, and would come to cause some confusion among Israeli commanders {{for the rest of}} the day.|$|E

40|$|International audienceAmong {{statistical}} attacks, {{we often}} {{make a distinction}} between <b>attacks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> linear context, for which the knowledge of plaintexts and corresponding ciphertexts is enough to perform <b>the</b> <b>attack,</b> and <b>attacks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> differential context, for which the plaintexts are chosen. Such attacks are usually referred as known-or chosen-plaintext attacks. It is commonly believed that <b>attacks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> known-plaintext model are more practical than <b>attacks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chosen-plaintext model. Nevertheless, it is usual <b>in</b> <b>the</b> literature, to only compare the data, time and memory complexity of these attacks without considering <b>the</b> model. <b>In</b> this paper, we reconsider some known-plaintext attacks, by considering them <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distinct-known-plaintext model. We explain and develop the statistical model for the multiple zero-correlation linear cryptanalysis, multidimensional linear cryptanalysis, {{as well as for the}} key-difference-invariant-bias related-key attack introduced at ASIACRYPT 2013. Based on these models validated by experiments, we improve attacks on some ciphers...|$|R

5|$|As {{the race}} reached the summit, Romain Bardet attacked, {{and the bottom}} had gained a twenty-second {{advantage}} over the front group of around thirty riders, increasing it to one minute {{at the foot of}} the Pra-Loup climb.

Van Garderen dropped Intxausti and passed Froome to take second place, thirty-six seconds behind stage winner Bardet.

5|$|At 19:00, the German ships {{closed to}} <b>attack.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> span of five minutes, the German cruisers' guns had seriously damaged Good Hope, which was {{destroyed}} by a magazine explosion. Monmouth attempted to escape to the south; she was burning furiously and her guns had fallen silent. Nürnberg closed to point-blank range of Monmouth and poured shells into her. Glasgow was forced to abandon Monmouth after 20:20, before fleeing south and meeting with Canopus. Monmouth eventually capsized and sank at 21:18. Over 1,600men {{were killed in the}} sinking of the two armored cruisers, including Admiral Craddock; German losses were negligible. However, the German ships had expended over 40% of their ammunition supply.|$|E

5|$|Caligula had {{two large}} ships {{constructed}} for himself (which were {{recovered from the}} bottom of Lake Nemi around 1930). The ships were among the largest vessels in the ancient world. The smaller ship was designed as a temple dedicated to Diana. The larger ship was essentially an elaborate floating palace with marble floors and plumbing. Thirteen years after being raised, the ships were burned during an <b>attack</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Second World War, and almost nothing remains of their hulls, though many archaeological treasures remain intact in the museum at Lake Nemi and in the Museo Nazionale Romano (Palazzo Massimo) at Rome.|$|E

The rest of the army was aligned to their left flank and on 19 September started the last attack major attack of the campaign.
