5|$|In 1894, Ross was {{appointed}} to {{a seat on the}} Railroad Commission of Texas. While he pondered whether to resign his position and accept the appointment, letters and petitions poured into his office begging him to remain at Texas AMC.

5|$|One of {{the cases}} that Simon pleaded for the {{archbishop}} was Walter's case against Gerald of Wales, who had been elected to the Bishopric of St David's in Wales.

5|$|Andrus {{retired from}} the USAF in 1995, Pilkington in 1996, Emery in 1997, and Santarelli in 1998, {{all at the same}} rank they held {{at the time of the}} shootdown, except Emery, who retired as a brigadier general. Richardson was {{promoted}} to brigadier general on 1 July 1999 and retired on 1 September 2001. Dallager was appointed as superintendent of the USAF Academy in June 2000 and was promoted to lieutenant general on 1 August of the same year. Dallager's <b>appointment</b> <b>and</b> promotion were criticized by observers because of his involvement in the controversial shootdown after-actions and refusal to testify for the senate investigation. Dallager retired on 1 September 2003, but at the rank of major general.|$|E

5|$|As CGS, Duigan {{proved to}} be an undistinguished <b>appointment</b> <b>and</b> was not {{particularly}} well regarded by the politicians of the day. He implemented several organisational changes, one of which was the disestablishment of the GOC position and its replacement with an army board to control the military. When the board was established in November 1937, it included Fred Jones, the Minister of Defence, and Duigan as first military member. Duigan offered little counter to the favouring of the fledgling Royal New Zealand Air Force by the New Zealand Government of the time, and this affected morale within the army.|$|E
5|$|Baird held ministerial {{responsibilities}} for the Toronto Harbourfront Centre and the Toronto Waterfront Revitalization Corporation. He developed a {{working relationship with}} Toronto Mayor David Miller soon after his <b>appointment,</b> <b>and</b> was present for the announcement of a comprehensive new waterfront strategy in June 2006. Ontario cabinet minister David Caplan described Baird {{as a champion of}} waterfront renewal and Miller described him as an ally of the city. Baird spent Christmas 2006 meeting with Canadian soldiers in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|Blaine {{received}} {{the news at}} his home in Washington and telegraphed Hayes his congratulations. In the subsequent contest of 1876, Hayes was elected after a contentious compromise over disputed electoral votes. The results of the convention had further effects on Blaine’s political career, as Bristow, having lost the nomination, also resigned as Treasury Secretary three days after the convention ended. President Grant selected Senator Lot M. Morrill of Maine to fill the cabinet post, and Maine’s governor, Seldon Connor, appointed Blaine to the now-vacant Senate seat. When the Maine Legislature reconvened that autumn, they confirmed Blaine’s <b>appointment</b> <b>and</b> elected him to the full six-year term that would begin on March 4, 1877.|$|E

5|$|Béla {{appointed}} his son-in-law, Rostislav Mikhailovich Ban of Macsó (Mačva, Serbia) in 1254. Rostislav's {{task was}} the creation of a buffer zone along the southern borders. He occupied Bosnia already in the year of his <b>appointment</b> <b>and</b> forced Tzar Michael Asen I of Bulgaria to cede Belgrade and Barancs (Braničevo, Serbia) in 1255. Béla adopted the title of King of Bulgaria, but he only used it occasionally in the subsequent years.|$|E
5|$|During {{his term}} as {{lieutenant}} governor, Breathitt {{was one of}} several proposed candidates to succeed John Rowan in the United States Senate, but the General Assembly deadlocked over the <b>appointment</b> <b>and</b> the seat went unfilled until the Assembly's next term. In the next gubernatorial election in 1832, Breathitt was the Democratic nominee for governor. Again, Breathitt won, but James Turner Morehead, the Whig candidate for lieutenant governor, defeated Breathitt's running mate. Initially, Breathitt enjoyed popularity for his public condemnation of John C. Calhoun's doctrine of nullification, but he did not fare well in state politics because the Whigs controlled the legislature. He died in office of tuberculosis on February 21, 1834.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 18th century, Lima was {{adversely}} affected by the Bourbon Reforms as it lost its monopoly on overseas trade and the important mining region of Upper Peru was transferred to the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. This economic decline made the city's elite dependent on royal and ecclesiastical <b>appointment</b> <b>and</b> thus, reluctant to advocate independence. In the 1810s, the city became a Royalist stronghold during the South American wars of independence led by a strong viceroy, José Fernando de Abascal y Sousa.|$|E

5|$|Ernest Brooks (23 February 1876 — 1957) was a British photographer, {{best known}} for his war {{photography}} from the First World War. He was the first official photographer to be appointed by the British military, and produced several thousand images between 1915 and 1918, more than a tenth of all British official photographs taken during the war. His work was often posed and formal, but several of his less conventional images are marked by a distinctive use of silhouette. Before and immediately after the war he worked as an official photographer to the Royal Family, but was dismissed from this <b>appointment</b> <b>and</b> stripped of his official honours in 1925.|$|E
5|$|Federally, Boston {{is split}} between two congressional districts. The {{northern}} {{three-fourths of the}} city is in the 7th district, represented by Mike Capuano since 1998. The southern fourth is in the 8th district, represented by Stephen Lynch. Both are Democrats; a Republican has not represented a significant portion of Boston in over a century. The state's senior member of the United States Senate is Democrat Elizabeth Warren, first elected in 2012. The state's junior member of the United States Senate is Democrat Ed Markey, who was elected in 2013 to succeed John Kerry after Kerry's <b>appointment</b> <b>and</b> confirmation as the United States Secretary of State.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his term}} as governor, Greenup {{was chosen as}} a presidential elector for the ticket of James Madison and George Clinton.

Hardin {{recommended}} to Governor Isaac Shelby that Greenup be appointed Assistant Secretary of State. Shelby made the <b>appointment,</b> <b>and</b> when Hardin, resigned December 15, 1812, Shelby nominated Greenup as his replacement. The Kentucky Senate approved the nomination on February 3, 1813, and Greenup served until his resignation on March 13, 1813.|$|E

5|$|In early 2010 Estianty {{established}} {{the recording studio}} Le Moesiek; several established artists, including Krisdayanti and Julia Perez, signed on quickly. At the time she owned five other business ventures, including a steakhouse, an outsourcing company, and a cafe. Estianty was reported in October 2010 {{to be working on}} a cover album which featured works originally sung by Nike Ardilla, Hetty Koes Endang, and AtiekCB. Later that year she was chosen as Ambassador on Domestic Violence by the Indonesian Ministry for Women's Issues.

5|$|Johnson {{appointed}} nine Article III {{federal judges}} during his presidency, all to United States district courts; {{he did not}} appoint a justice {{to serve on the}} Supreme Court. In April 1866, he nominated Henry Stanbery to fill the vacancy left with the death of John Catron, but Congress eliminated the seat to prevent the <b>appointment,</b> <b>and</b> to ensure that he did not get to make any appointments eliminated the next vacancy as well, providing that the court would shrink by one justice when one next departed from office. Johnson appointed his Greeneville crony, Samuel Milligan, to the United States Court of Claims, where he served from 1868 until his death in 1874.|$|E

Cadets smuggled whiskey into the academy to make eggnog, and more than one-third of the cadets were involved in the incident. In June 1828, Davis graduated 23rd in a class of 33.|$|E
