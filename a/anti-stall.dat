5|$|After the Belgian Grand Prix on 2 September, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} mid-season testing at various European race circuits between 4–7 September {{to prepare for}} the Italian Grand Prix at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza. Ferrari, Williams, BAR, Jordan and Minardi tested at the Mugello Circuit. Rubens Barrichello for Ferrari set the fastest times on the first and second days. The second day of testing was disrupted on six occasions after BAR test driver Takuma Sato went off the circuit, suffered an electronic control unit failure and had a malfunctioning <b>anti-stall</b> system. BAR driver Olivier Panis and Minardi driver Alex Yoong both had problems with their clutch and gearboxes. On the final day Michael Schumacher set the fastest lap of 1 minute and 24.226 seconds, four-tenths ahead of Panis. Ferrari test driver Luca Badoer spent three days at his team's private test track the Fiorano Circuit where he did practice starts as well as testing of launch control and traction control.|$|E
25|$|The {{cars were}} driven {{without the aid}} of {{traction}} control, launch control or <b>anti-stall,</b> leaving a lot down to the skill of the driver.|$|E
25|$|At the , he {{qualified}} fifteenth. Due to an overheating {{clutch at}} the start, he dropped down to 20th position. A poor pit stop failed {{to help his}} cause and he finished in fourteenth position. It was similar at the , when Barrichello again finished in fourteenth. He qualified eleventh, narrowly missing Q3 but his <b>anti-stall</b> system kicked in {{at the start of}} the race. After recovering well, he later collided with Jaime Alguersuari when Alguersuari came across too late to cover his line, the damage blocking Barrichello's left brake duct.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we suggest}} a new pivot rule for the primal simplex {{algorithm}} for the minimum cost flow problem, {{known as the}} network simplex algorithm. Due to degeneracy, cycling may occur in the network simplex algorithm. By maintaining strongly feasible bases due to Cunningham [1976, 1979], cycling can be prevented but without restrictions on the entering variable, the algorithm can still perform an exponentially long sequence of non-degenerate pivots; this phenomenon is known as stalling. Researchers have suggested several pivot rules with the following bounds {{on the number of}} consecutive degenerate pivots: m, n 2, k(k+ 1) / 2, where n is the number of nodes in the network, m is the number of arcs in the network, and k is the number of degenerate arcs in the basis. (Observe that k n.) In this paper, we describe an <b>anti-stalling</b> pivot rule that ensures that the network simplex algorithm performs at most k consecutive degenerate pivots. This rule uses a negative cost augmenting cycle to identify a sequence of entering variables...|$|R
25|$|In Melbourne, Barrichello {{topped the}} {{timesheets}} {{in the first}} two elements of qualifying, but qualified second on the grid behind teammate Button. Despite a poor start caused by his engine slipping into <b>anti-stall,</b> he did well to recover and lost only a couple of positions at the start. However, he sustained damage to the front wing and rear diffuser in the first corner incident when he was bumped from behind by Heikki Kovalainen in his McLaren that saw him hit Mark Webber in the Red Bull damaging Webber's car as well as his hopes of a good finish. Despite this, Barrichello ultimately finished the race in second place after Sebastian Vettel and Robert Kubica collided with just 2 laps remaining. He started eighth in Malaysia after getting a grid penalty for a gearbox change and finished the race in fifth place after the race was abandoned at Sepang due to heavy rain.|$|E
25|$|At Spa, he {{qualified}} 4th, but {{suffered from}} <b>anti-stall</b> {{for the third}} time in 2009 and he found himself last, but missed the first lap crash which took out four drivers including teammate Button. While the safety car was out he pitted and changed strategy which enabled him to climb back up to 7th. During the last three laps the car had an engine oil leak, but he still managed to finish, before his car caught fire in the pit lane after the race. At Monza, he qualified 5th, despite carrying more fuel to try a different strategy with only one stop. After passing Kovalainen at the start, Barrichello managed not to lose too much time, as he had the advantage of just one stop against Hamilton, Räikkönen and Sutil's two stop strategy. By Hamilton's second pit stop, Button and Barrichello were running first and second. Hamilton tried to pressure Button by forcing his car, but on the last lap he crashed, giving third place to Räikkönen, and fourth to Sutil. Barrichello won the 11th race in his Formula One career, and gained more points on Button in their fight for the world title.|$|E
25|$|Räikkönen {{qualified}} on {{the front}} row for Ferrari's home race at Monza, but a complete lack of movement {{for a few seconds}} at the start saw him drop down the order. Showing good pace however, he managed to pick his way {{from the back of the}} field to fifth. Räikkönen blamed a 'clutch positioning' problem, whilst team boss Arrivabene suggested Räikkönen had caused the <b>anti-stall</b> to kick in himself due to 'messing with his fingers' although he clarified it saying he did not fully know at the time. Nevertheless, he remained at one podium of the season, as team mate Vettel finished second to take his tally to eight in twelve races. At the Singapore Grand Prix, Räikkönen showed consistent performances in the practice sessions and qualified in 3rd, behind Sebastian Vettel and Daniel Ricciardo. Räikkönen maintained the position through the race despite being uncomfortable with the car, to take his second podium finish of the season. Räikkönen ended the season by finishing third in the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix to take his third podium of the year and securing fourth place in the Drivers' Championship.|$|E
500|$|The {{first race}} began at 13:10 [...] (UTC+3) on 18 April. Weather {{conditions}} {{at the start of}} the race were sunny and hot with an air temperature of [...] and a track temperature of [...] Windy conditions made the track dusty. When the race started, Vandoorne maintained his pole position advantage heading into the first corner. His teammate Matsushita made a slow start, and his <b>anti-stall</b> system activated, allowing several cars to get ahead of him before he got up to speed. Nato made a good start, moving from seventh to third while Lynn inherited second position. Sørensen's car was damaged while fending off an overtaking manoeuvre by de Jong. Rossi overtook his teammate King to move into seventh place on the same lap and started to close the gap with Pic and Gasly. Sørensen drove into the pit lane to retire because of the damage sustained from de Jong's passing manoeuvre.|$|E
500|$|The {{weather and}} {{conditions}} on the grid were before dry for the race. The air temperature was [...] with signs of a breeze which could blow sand onto the track and impede the cars' grip. Massa got the best start of the frontrunners off the line, as he passed Kubica into the first corner to take the lead. Hamilton's poor start caused his <b>anti-stall</b> system to kick in, and he was passed by six drivers to fall back to ninth. Räikkönen benefited from Hamilton's start by moving up to third, ahead of Kovalainen, Trulli and Heidfeld. As Massa extended his lead {{at the front of}} the race, Hamilton, who trailed Alonso, collided with the back of the Renault, knocking the McLaren's front wing off the car. Suffering handling difficulties, Hamilton returned to the pit-lane for a new nose section, and rejoined in 18th place. Räikkönen took second place when he passed Kubica on lap three; Heidfeld took fourth when he passed Trulli and Kovalainen in separate manoeuvres. Further down the field, Vettel retired from the race on the first lap after twice colliding with other cars; Button, Sutil and Coulthard pitted to repair early damage.|$|E
500|$|Hamilton {{accepted}} {{responsibility for}} his near stall on the grid: [...] "I hadn't hit the switch early enough and therefore we {{were not in the}} launch map and went straight into <b>anti-stall,</b> and when everyone else was in their launch mode, I wasn't." [...] Renault dismissed suggestions that Alonso had brake tested Hamilton in the incident that led to the McLaren's wing breaking off. Pat Symonds, Renault's head of engineering, said his team's telemetry indicated Alonso was on full throttle down the straight, and had not touched the brakes: [...] "I think all I can say from our side {{is that there is no}} blame attributable to Fernando, which is what some of the speculation might be." [...] McLaren F1 CEO Martin Whitmarsh said that Hamilton's front wing had broken seconds before the impact, and that the resulting downforce reduction had sucked Hamilton into Alonso's slipstream faster than expected. However, photos indicate that the front wing on the McLaren could have broken even earlier when Hamilton nudged a car (believed to be Alonso) on the opening lap. The later incident left Alonso with damage to the back of the car, impairing his attempts to pass Glock late in the race.|$|E
500|$|The race {{started at}} 14:30 local time. The {{conditions}} for the race were dry and overcast for the race. The air temperature was at [...] and the track temperature at [...] Approximately 151,000 people attended the race. During the final parade lap, Häkkinen's car developed an leak in the hydraulic system which caused smoke to depart but managed to take the start. Frentzen started the race using Jordan's spare monocoque. Häkkinen accelerated faster than Michael Schumacher off the line, withstanding the German's attempts to maintain his position to clinch the lead heading into the first corner. Behind the leading three in the run down into the first corner, Ralf Schumacher moved ahead of Barrichello and Coulthard withstood his attempts to pass for third position. Verstappen made the best start in the field, moving from 14th to tenth {{at the end of}} the first lap, while Fisichella made a poor start and lost eight places over the same distance; the result of his <b>anti-stall</b> system activating. At the completition of the first lap, Häkkinen led from Michael Schumacher, Coulthard, Ralf Schumacher, Irvine, Barrichello, Button, Herbert, Villeneuve, Verstappen, Frentzen, Trulli, de la Rosa, Wurz, Salo, Alesi, Heidfeld, Zonta, Diniz, Fisichella, Gené and Mazzacane.|$|E

50|$|In 2015, an {{official}} report {{compiled by the}} Health and Safety Executive concluded that De Villota had not received full guidance on how to stop the car, and was caught out by its <b>anti-stall</b> system, which activated as she attempted to brake to a standstill and pushed the car forward into the tail-lift of the team's service truck.|$|E
50|$|At a given {{throttle}} condition, {{the compressor}} operates {{somewhere along the}} steady state running line. Unfortunately, this operating line is displaced during transients. Many compressors are fitted with <b>anti-stall</b> systems {{in the form of}} bleed bands or variable geometry stators to decrease the likelihood of surge. Another method is to split the compressor into two or more units, operating on separate concentric shafts.|$|E
50|$|There is {{essentially}} {{no difference in}} efficiency between the technique of bypassing the throttle butterfly and operating the butterfly itself. The IAC allows the ECU to maintain minimum RPM irrespective of changes in engine load, {{sometimes referred to as}} <b>anti-stall</b> feature. Thus the driver can more easily move the car from stand-still by merely releasing the clutch (manual transmission) or the brake (automatic transmission) without having to simultaneously press the accelerator.|$|E
50|$|At the , he {{qualified}} fifteenth. Due to an overheating {{clutch at}} the start, he dropped down to 20th position. A poor pit stop failed {{to help his}} cause and he finished in fourteenth position. It was similar at the , when Barrichello again finished in fourteenth. He qualified eleventh, narrowly missing Q3 but his <b>anti-stall</b> system kicked in {{at the start of}} the race. After recovering well, he later collided with Jaime Alguersuari when Alguersuari came across too late to cover his line, the damage blocking Barrichello's left brake duct.|$|E
50|$|At the 2009 Turkish Grand Prix the Brawns {{were beaten}} to pole by Vettel after {{struggling}} with pace throughout Friday and Saturday, for Button especially. At the start, Barrichello's <b>anti-stall</b> cut {{in and he}} fell {{to the back of}} the grid; Button meanwhile, after pointing the car at Vettel got off cleanly and inherited the lead at turn 10 when Vettel ran wide. Button led the race calmly for the rest of the race with his team mate having many incidents before giving Brawn their first retirement after losing seventh gear.|$|E
50|$|Vettel won {{the start}} from pole and led Button {{to the first}} corner, with Alonso getting around a slow {{starting}} Webber for third. Hamilton started ninth in the position vacated by Pérez but made little progress on the opening lap. Vettel went 2.4 seconds ahead of Button {{by the end of}} the first lap. Schumacher's <b>anti-stall</b> kicked in at the start dropping him to tenth at first corner, but he retook ninth from Hamilton at Grand-Hotel hairpin. Vettel continued to build a strong lead but his pit stop on lap 16 was slow and he was fitted with hard compound tyres due to a radio communication error. Alonso briefly led then but when he pitted on Lap 17 Button went to the lead. He stayed there until Lap 33 when he pitted and Vettel once again resumed the lead.|$|E
5000|$|Jenson Button made {{a better}} start {{off the line}} than Sebastian Vettel, who also had a good start {{compared}} to some cars behind him. Button attempted to overtake down the inside, but Vettel covered aggressively and Button lifted off after being half on the grass which allowed Lewis Hamilton to take him down the outside of Turn 1. [...] Button asked his race engineer soon afterwards [...] "He's {{got to get a}} penalty for that, hasn't he?". Martin Brundle thought the move was [...] "harsh but not worth a penalty", while Vettel said that he had not seen Button because Button was behind him. Meanwhile, home favourite Kamui Kobayashi lost his seventh-place qualifying slot, slipping to twelfth when his <b>anti-stall</b> kicked in at the start. Contrastly, Paul di Resta made a good start to take eighth place.|$|E
50|$|The Sauber C30s of Kamui Kobayashi and seventh-placed Sergio Pérez retired with {{near-identical}} gearbox problems, {{reducing the}} field to just fifteen drivers plus Daniel Ricciardo. Ricciardo's car had gone into <b>anti-stall</b> on the grid before failing to engage a gear. The car was immediately returned to the pits while repairs were carried out, and although Ricciardo returned to the circuit, he was some eight laps behind the last-placed Timo Glock {{at the time of}} Pérez's retirement. Ricciardo would ultimately finish the race fourteen laps behind race winner Vettel, and was therefore not classified as a finisher as he had failed to complete 90% of the winner's race distance. With just fifteen drivers on the track, the Team Lotus drivers of Heikki Kovalainen and Jarno Trulli were able to secure 13th and 14th place, further reinforcing the team's claim to tenth in the World Constructors' Championship.|$|E
50|$|With an all-aluminium construction, the Wilga is a high-wing {{cantilever}} STOL monoplane, with {{a conventional}} layout. The main cabin is constructed of duralumin, riveted and corrugated, increasing {{the strength and}} durability of the low-mass semi-monocoque fuselage. The rectangular single-spar wing is fitted with slotted flaps and <b>anti-stall</b> slats. The four-seat cabin is fitted with two large side doors, opening upwards to facilitate large loads, and rapid entry/exit. The main wheels are attached to an articulated, conventional fixed pneumatic shock landing gear with a heavy-duty sprung tail wheel and glider tow hook. The two-bladed composite wooden propeller is strengthened with bonded metal leading edges. The Russian-designed engine rotates in an opposite direction to North American standards. The newest models of Wilgas use full metal propellers and North American Continental O-470 engines with standard rotation. Likewise, presently two 195 L fuel tanks {{are located in the}} wings.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] saw Webber claim pole position, despite McLaren and Ferrari {{having a}} straight-line speed advantage. At the start, the <b>anti-stall</b> device on Webber's car came on, {{dropping}} the Australian to 5th. Vettel meanwhile in 3rd (after starting 4th) was chasing Jenson Button for 2nd place when he {{collided with the}} Brit at the Bus Stop. After sensing an inside passing opportunity, Vettel attempted to quickly change direction while under braking, causing the car to spear {{into the side of}} Button's McLaren. Button retired from the race, while Vettel was able to pit for repairs. He subsequently received a drive-through penalty for his action, and suffered a rear tyre puncture while attempting to overtake Vitantonio Liuzzi, finishing 15th. Webber was able to capitalise on the DNF of Button and Alonso, as well as a mistake by Renault's Robert Kubica during his pit stop, and finish 2nd, behind race winner Hamilton.|$|E
50|$|After the Belgian Grand Prix on 2 September, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} mid-season testing at various European race circuits between 4-7 September {{to prepare for}} the Italian Grand Prix at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza. Ferrari, Williams, BAR, Jordan and Minardi tested at the Mugello Circuit. Rubens Barrichello for Ferrari set the fastest times on the first and second days. The second day of testing was disrupted on six occasions after BAR test driver Takuma Sato went off the circuit, suffered an electronic control unit failure and had a malfunctioning <b>anti-stall</b> system. BAR driver Olivier Panis and Minardi driver Alex Yoong both had problems with their clutch and gearboxes. On the final day Michael Schumacher set the fastest lap of 1 minute and 24.226 seconds, four-tenths ahead of Panis. Ferrari test driver Luca Badoer spent three days at his team's private test track the Fiorano Circuit where he did practice starts as well as testing of launch control and traction control.|$|E
50|$|The <b>anti-stall</b> devices {{activated}} {{while they}} were at altitude, but the pilots overrode the automatic nose-down that would increase speed to prevent stall. After four overrides, both engines experienced flameout and shut down. The plane then stalled, and the pilots recovered from the stall at FL380 while still having no engines. At that altitude, there were six airports within reach for a forced landing. This led the pilots to pitch nose down {{in an attempt to}} restart the engines, which requires a dive sharp enough to attain the required 300 kn for a windmill restart to make the blades in the turbines windmill at 10% N2 (turbine rotational speed). The captain did not take the necessary steps to ensure that the first officer achieved the 300 kn or greater airspeed required for the windmill engine restart procedure and then did not demonstrate command authority by taking control of the airplane and accelerating it to at least that speed.|$|E
50|$|In Melbourne, Barrichello {{topped the}} {{timesheets}} {{in the first}} two elements of qualifying, but qualified second on the grid behind team-mate Button. Despite a poor start caused by his engine slipping into <b>anti-stall,</b> he did well to recover and lost only a couple of positions at the start. However, he sustained damage to the front wing and rear diffuser in the first corner incident when he was bumped from behind by Heikki Kovalainen in his McLaren that saw him hit Mark Webber in the Red Bull damaging Webber's car as well as his hopes of a good finish. Despite this, Barrichello ultimately finished the race in second place after Sebastian Vettel and Robert Kubica collided with just 2 laps remaining. He started eighth in Malaysia after getting a grid penalty for a gearbox change and finished the race in fifth place after the race was abandoned at Sepang due to heavy rain.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first race}} began at 13:10 Arabia Standard Time (UTC+3) on 18 April. Weather {{conditions}} {{at the start of}} the race were sunny and hot with an air temperature of 30 C and a track temperature of 49 C. Windy conditions made the track dusty.

Rossi overtook his teammate King to move into seventh place on the same lap and started to close the gap with Pic and Gasly. Sørensen drove into the pit lane to retire because of the damage sustained from de Jong's passing manoeuvre.|$|E
50|$|The race {{started with}} Mark Webber {{allowing}} the engine revs to drop too low, causing his RB6 to default to the <b>anti-stall</b> setting and {{resulting in a}} poor getaway that demoted him to sixth. At the same time Felipe Massa started slightly ahead of his grid slot, with his error going unpunished. Lewis Hamilton took the lead with Robert Kubica second, but Kubica's grip on the position relaxed quickly as Jenson Button and Sebastian Vettel passed him. Although {{the early stages of}} the lap were clean, the end was considerably less so, with almost every driver in the top ten overshooting the braking zone for the Bus Stop chicane. Fernando Alonso was the only driver to hold on long enough to make the corner, but found himself on the receiving end of an out-of-control Rubens Barrichello, the Brazilian's 300th Grand Prix start ending there and then. Alonso was lucky enough to escape with minor damage, and quickly pitted to change onto wet tyres in anticipation of heavy rain.|$|E
50|$|At Spa, he {{qualified}} 4th, but {{suffered from}} <b>anti-stall</b> {{for the third}} time in 2009 and he found himself last, but missed the first lap crash which took out four drivers including team-mate Button. While the safety car was out he pitted and changed strategy which enabled him to climb back up to 7th. During the last three laps the car had an engine oil leak, but he still managed to finish, before his car caught fire in the pit lane after the race. At Monza, he qualified 5th, despite carrying more fuel to try a different strategy with only one stop. After passing Kovalainen at the start, Barrichello managed not to lose too much time, as he had the advantage of just one stop against Hamilton, Räikkönen and Sutil's two stop strategy. By Hamilton's second pit stop, Button and Barrichello were running first and second. Hamilton tried to pressure Button by forcing his car, but on the last lap he crashed, giving third place to Räikkönen, and fourth to Sutil. Barrichello won the 11th race in his Formula One career, and gained more points on Button in their fight for the world title.|$|E
50|$|Räikkönen {{qualified}} on {{the front}} row for Ferrari's home race at Monza, but a complete lack of movement {{for a few seconds}} at the start saw him drop down the order. Showing good pace however, he managed to pick his way {{from the back of the}} field to fifth. Räikkönen blamed a 'clutch positioning' problem, whilst team boss Arrivabene suggested Räikkönen had caused the <b>anti-stall</b> to kick in himself due to 'messing with his fingers' although he clarified it saying he did not fully know at the time. Nevertheless, he remained at one podium of the season, as team mate Vettel finished second to take his tally to eight in twelve races. At the Singapore Grand Prix, Räikkönen showed consistent performances in the practice sessions and qualified in 3rd, behind Sebastian Vettel and Daniel Ricciardo. Räikkönen maintained the position through the race despite being uncomfortable with the car, to take his second podium finish of the season. Räikkönen ended the season by finishing third in the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix to take his third podium of the year and securing fourth place in the Drivers' Championship.|$|E
