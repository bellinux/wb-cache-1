Despite the formation of all-Belgian ground units from late 1940, many Belgian volunteers – {{especially those in the}} Royal Air Force – served in majority British units, particularly in the early years after the formation of the Free Belgian forces.|$|E

25|$|Following his conviction, Baker {{remained}} in the public spotlight after several further violent incidents inside Auckland Prison. In July 2008, while being returned to Auckland Prison from Auckland City Hospital after treatment for self-inflicted injuries, Baker pulled a concealed shiv on a prison officer {{in an attempt to}} escape. The prison officer received minor injuries and Baker was returned to Auckland Prison. On 27 August 2009, Baker took hostage a fellow inmate in Auckland Prison using a makeshift knife and two razor blades. Police managed to defuse the situation <b>and</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>was</b> harmed in the incident. In 2010, Baker was found guilty on charges that resulted from these two incidents and was subsequently sentenced to preventive detention with no possibility of parole for at least 16 years.|$|E

25|$|On 20 July 1990 a bomb {{planted by}} the IRA {{exploded}} in the men's toilets behind the visitors' gallery. The area had already been evacuated <b>and</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>was</b> injured. About 30 minutes before the blast at 8:49a.m., a man {{who said he was}} a member of the IRA told Reuters that a bomb had been placed at the exchange and was about to explode. Police officials said that if there had been no warning, the human toll would have been very high. The explosion ripped a hole in the 23-story building on Threadneedle Street and sent a shower of glass and concrete onto the street. The long term trend towards electronic trading had been reducing the Exchange's status as a visitor attraction and, although the gallery reopened, it was closed permanently in 1992.|$|E
25|$|On 23 October 1943, Azad Hind {{declared}} war against Britain and the United States. Its first formal commitment {{came with the}} opening of the Japanese offensive towards Manipur, code named U-Go. In the initial plans for invasion of India, Field Marshall Terauschi had been reluctant to confer any responsibilities to the INA beyond espionage and propaganda. Bose rejected this as the role of Fifth-columnists, and insisted that INA should contribute substantially in troops to form a distinct identity of an Indian-liberation army. He secured from Japanese army Chief of Staff, General Sugiyama, the agreement that INA would rank as an allied army in the offensive. The advanced headquarters of Azad Hind was moved to Rangoon in anticipation of success. The INA's own strategy was to avoid set-piece battles, for which it lacked armament as well as manpower. Initially it sought to obtain arms and increase its ranks by inducing British-Indian soldiers to defect. The latter were expected to defect in large numbers. Col Prem Sahgal, once military secretary to Subhas Bose and later tried in the first Red Fort trials, explained the INA strategy to Peter Fay– although the war itself hung in balance <b>and</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>was</b> sure if the Japanese would win, initiating a popular revolution with grass-roots support within India would ensure that even if Japan ultimately lost the war, Britain would not be in a position to re-assert its colonial authority. It was planned that, once Japanese forces had broken through British defences at Imphal, the INA would cross the hills of North-East India into the Gangetic plain, where it would work as a guerrilla army. This army was expected to live off the land, with captured British supplies,support, and personnel from the local population.|$|E

"There was {{one moment}} in the Six-Day War which symbolized the great victory: that was the moment in which the first paratroopers – under Gur's command – reached the stones of the Western Wall, feeling the emotion of the place; there never was, and never will be, another moment like it. Nobody staged that moment. Nobody planned it in advance. Nobody {{prepared}} it <b>and</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>was</b> prepared for it; {{it was as if}} Providence had directed the whole thing: the paratroopers weeping — loudly and in pain — over their comrades who had fallen along the way, the words of the Kaddish prayer heard by Western Wall's stones after 19 years of silence, tears of mourning, shouts of joy, and the singing of [...] "Hatikvah"".|$|E

500|$|Filming {{the large}} napalm {{explosion}} in the opening scene of the film required a 450-foot (137-meter) row of explosive pots containing 1,100gallons (4,165liters) of gasoline and diesel fuel. All the palm trees used in the explosion were moved to the specific location after the crew determined {{the impact of the}} lighting and necessary camera angles. Due to the size and cost of the 1.25-second explosion, it was only performed once and was captured by twelve cameras. For the safety of the crew and cast, the detonators were added onehour before the explosion <b>and</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>was</b> allowed to be within [...] during detonation. The explosion was made up of twelveindividual explosions and resulted in a mushroom cloud that reached [...] in the air. For the scene in the film, Danny McBride's character, Cody Underwood, was the only actor shown in the shot of the explosion. All the other characters were added digitally. The explosion of the bridge in one of the final scenes used nine cameras to capture the shot, and the crew was required to be [...] away for their safety.|$|E
500|$|Two {{of the six}} {{lifeboats}} {{that left}} Arctic reached the Newfoundland shore safely, and another {{was picked up by}} a passing steamer, which also rescued a few survivors from improvised rafts. [...] Among those saved was Captain Luce, who had regained the surface after initially going down with the ship. The other three lifeboats disappeared without a trace. The limited telegraph facilities of the time meant that news of Arctics loss did not reach New York until two weeks after the sinking. Initial public sorrow at the ship's loss quickly turned to anger at the perceived cowardice of the crew. Despite press calls for a full investigation into the disaster, none took place, <b>and</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>was</b> held legally responsible. Demands for the introduction of further safety measures on passenger-carrying vessels were likewise sidestepped. [...] Luce, who was generally exonerated from blame by the public, retired from the sea; some of the surviving crew chose not to return to the US. The Collins Line continued its transatlantic service, until further maritime losses and insolvency led to its closure in 1858.|$|E
500|$|Carey {{was unable}} to film an {{accompanying}} music video for the single; {{at the time of}} its release, she was recovering from a physical and emotional breakdown that left her hospitalized in August 2001, and caused her to cancel all public appearances to promote Glitter. She said, [...] "When I was asked about the video I said, 'I can't do it today'. And nobody could accept that answer. And that's when I started to get mad. I was, like, look, I am too fatigued. I'm overly-tired, I can't do it as a human being. <b>And</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>was</b> hearing those last two words — human being. They were used to the Mariah that always says, 'Come on, let's fight, let's go'. They just weren't used to me ever saying no. I never said no before". Instead, a video was created using a scene taken directly from the film, where Billie Frank (played by Carey) sings the song at Madison Square Garden during her first sold-out concert. Frank's performance of the song in the film omits its entire second verse, and the song's development runs in parallel with the film's love story.|$|E

500|$|In 1955 Donen {{teamed up}} with Kelly for their third and final directorial collaboration. The musical It's Always Fair Weather was {{produced}} by Freed, written by Comden and Green and had music by André Previn. It starred Kelly, Dan Dailey, Cyd Charisse, Michael Kidd, and Dolores Gray. Originally envisioned as a sequel to On the Town, Kelly, Dailey and Kidd play three ex-GIs who reunite 10 years after World War II and discover that none of their lives have turned out quite how they had expected. Kelly had approached Donen with this project as their next collaboration and at first Donen was reluctant to accept due to his own success. Their friendship deteriorated during production and Donen noted, [...] "the atmosphere from day one was very tense <b>and</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>was</b> speaking to anybody." [...] He has {{been quoted as saying}} it was a [...] "one hundred percent nightmare" [...] which was a [...] "struggle from beginning to end" [...] and MGM did not allow the co-directors to shoot on location in New York. It's Always Fair Weather was a moderately profitable film, but not as successful as the pairs previous two films. It was Donen's last film with Kelly or Freed. After the film's completion he fulfilled his MGM contract agreement by working with other studios. His last project for MGM was completing the final four days of shooting on Kismet in July 1955 for director Vincent Minnelli, who had other commitments.|$|E
