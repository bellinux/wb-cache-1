60|$|It was Maggie who <b>answered.</b> Her <b>tone</b> was lifeless, but her manner almost composed.|$|R

60|$|Mr. Fregelius, auguring {{the very}} best from this openness, <b>answered</b> in <b>tones</b> which he could not prevent from betraying an unseemly joy.|$|R
6000|$|The {{squatter}} {{laid his}} broad {{hand on her}} shoulder, and looking her steadily in the eye, he <b>answered,</b> in <b>tones</b> that were both stern and solemn-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} good, sir," [...] she <b>answered,</b> in <b>tones</b> barely audible--with {{her eyes on}} the ground. [...] "I can't say that I feel much better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Better {{things than}} medallions, Dick,' was the <b>answer,</b> in <b>tones</b> that {{recalled}} a gray-eyed atom's fearless speech to Mrs. Jennett. Dick would have abased himself utterly, but that other girl trailed in.|$|R
6000|$|Forjas {{spread his}} hands. [...] "You will remember, General," [...] he <b>answered,</b> in <b>tones</b> of conciliatory regret, [...] "that the Principal Souza {{represents}} a class upon whom Lord Wellington's measures bear {{in a manner}} peculiarly hard." ...|$|R
60|$|The rhyme of {{the poet}} Modulates the king's affairs; Balance-loving Nature Made all things in pairs. To every foot its antipode; Each color with its counter glowed; To every <b>tone</b> beat <b>answering</b> <b>tones,</b> Higher or graver; Flavor gladly blends with flavor; Leaf answers leaf upon the bough; And match the paired cotyledons. Hands to hands, and feet to feet, In one body grooms and brides; Eldest rite, two married sides In every mortal meet. Light's far furnace shines, Smelting balls and bars, Forging double stars, Glittering twins and trines. The animals are sick with love, Lovesick with rhyme; Each with all propitious Time Into chorus wove.|$|R
60|$|Garnache drew {{himself up}} and {{delivered}} his <b>answer</b> in a <b>tone</b> that was final.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, poor boy." [...] Then <b>answering</b> the <b>tone</b> {{rather than}} the words, [...] "I suppose it is the lot of one {{generation}} to be startled by the next. There {{is a good deal}} of change in the outlook." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{stared out}} of the window. He <b>answered</b> in <b>tones</b> of {{excessive}} reasonableness: [...] "I didn't start these hostels to be run by you and your--friend." [...] He gave the sentence the quality of an ultimatum, an irreducible minimum.|$|R
60|$|Some of them grinned, {{but none}} made any <b>answer.</b> His <b>tone</b> was offensive, {{in the first}} place, and, while nobody is {{overburdened}} with riches on the prairie, the average Westerner has his own ideas {{as to what is}} becoming.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not for one's own {{pleasure}} or revenge," [...] {{she made}} <b>answer.</b> Her <b>tone</b> {{was filled with}} meekness. It had a touch of self-reproach. [...] "That is very wrong, of course. But changing them for their own good--at least, not changing, improving." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I doubt {{not that}} she will," [...] he <b>answered,</b> in <b>tones</b> as inscrutable as his glance. [...] "So that you woo with grace and ardour, what woman could {{withstand}} your Highness? Be not put off by such modesty as becomes a maid." ...|$|R
60|$|The words cut Dorothea to the heart, {{and made}} her relent. She <b>answered</b> in a <b>tone</b> of sad fellowship.|$|R

6000|$|... 'The very thing!' Arthur <b>answered</b> in a <b>tone</b> {{of obvious}} admiration. 'What a wonderfully {{practical}} person you really are, Lady Hilda.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why," [...] <b>answered</b> I, in <b>tones</b> of deep astonishment, [...] "I {{am about}} the {{business}} of the Lord Cardinal of Valencia, our master." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My foot," [...] {{continued}} the skipper, in surprisingly even <b>tones,</b> <b>answering</b> his subject, [...] "will then give way and I shall fall overboard." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No! only ourselves. The time {{slipped away}} somehow." [...] He <b>answered</b> in lower <b>tones</b> than usual, and sighed {{as he took}} his chair.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Oh, no,' <b>answered</b> Mrs. Twitty, in <b>tones</b> of approbation; {{and these}} were the first words she spoke after she had ceased to be Sickles.|$|R
6000|$|The scout {{regarded}} Heyward in surprise, {{and then}} lifting his cap, he <b>answered,</b> in a <b>tone</b> less confident than before, though still expressing doubt,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, deliver me {{from such}} con-sci-en-tious-ness,' he <b>answered,</b> in a <b>tone</b> of bitter mimicry, and flung {{out of the}} room leaving Emily in tears.|$|R
6000|$|With his hat in {{his hand}} and his heart in his eyes, John looked up and <b>answered</b> in a <b>tone</b> that made few words necessary,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed?" [...] I <b>answered.</b> My <b>tone</b> was one {{of utter}} unconcern in her cousin's history. [...] "Miss Wade, will you take Bombay ducks with your curry?" [...] In public, I thought it wise under the {{circumstances}} to abstain from calling her Hilda. It might lead to misconceptions; people might suppose we were more than fellow-travellers.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course not," [...] he <b>answered,</b> {{keeping his}} <b>tone</b> level, almost indifferent. [...] "I {{hope that we}} shall meet again some day, but not in Berlin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} are," [...] she <b>answered,</b> in the <b>tone</b> of a daughter; then added, with a smile: [...] "I like it here. Why not settle?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have been}} {{informed}} of the occurrence," [...] she <b>answered,</b> her <b>tone</b> as perfectly emotionless {{as though she had}} been discussing the veriest trifle. [...] "We were content to recognize Major Delahaye as representing those who have the right to dispose of Isobel's future. His death, however, alters many things. Isobel will be placed in even surer hands." ...|$|R
60|$|Mabane, too, was for {{a moment}} sad and silent. His face fell into stern lines, but when he <b>answered</b> me his <b>tone</b> was steady and {{resolute}} enough.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes; {{where do}} you live?" [...] Verena <b>answered,</b> in the <b>tone</b> of a girl for whom an {{invitation}} (she hadn't so many) was always an invitation.|$|R
60|$|Irritated by the {{accident}} which had forced {{him into the}} repellent presence of Benjulia, Ovid <b>answered</b> in a <b>tone</b> which matched the doctor on his own hard ground.|$|R
