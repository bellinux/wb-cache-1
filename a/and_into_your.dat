"Now, Barb'ry Aleshine," [...] said Mrs. Lecks, who {{had been}} {{watching}} her, [...] "if {{you ever want to}} get out of this salt water, you've got to make up your mind to take some of it into your mouth <b>and</b> <b>into</b> <b>your</b> eyes, that is, if you don't keep 'em shut. Get yourself as close to that bar as you can, and I'll come and put you under." [...] So saying, Mrs. Lecks returned to the other side of the bar, and having made Mrs. Aleshine bow down her head and close her eyes and mouth, she placed both hands upon her companion's broad shoulders, and threw as much weight as possible upon them. Mrs. Aleshine almost disappeared beneath the water, but she came up sputtering and blinking on the other side of the bar, where she was quickly joined by Mrs. Lecks.|$|E
60|$|Always come back, therefore, if {{you must}} come at all, about the {{beginning}} of November, {{and if you can}} manage to take in Election Day, and especially Election Night, it will not be a bad notion. New York has five saturnalia every year: New Year's Night, Decoration Day, Fourth of July, Election Night, and Thanksgiving, and not the least of these is Election Night. If it is a right first Tuesday of November, the daytime wind will be veering from west to south and back, sun and cloud will equally share the hours between them, and a not unnatural quiet, as of political passions hushed under the blanket of the Australian ballot, will prevail. The streets will be rather emptied than filled, and the litter of straw and scrap-paper, and the ordure and other filth of the great slattern town, will blow agreeably about under your feet <b>and</b> <b>into</b> <b>your</b> eyes and teeth. But with the falling of the night there will be a rise of the urban spirits; the sidewalks will thicken with citizens of all ages and sexes and nations; and if you will then seek some large centre for the cinematographic dissemination of the election news, you will find yourself one of a multitude gloating on the scenes of comedy and tragedy thrown up on the canvas to stay your impatience for the returns. Along the curbstones are stationed wagons for the sale of the wind and string instruments, whose raw, harsh discords of whistling and twanging will begin with the sight of the vote from the first precinct. Meantime policemen, nervously fondling their clubs in their hands, hang upon the fringes of the crowd, which is yet so good-natured that it seems to have no impulse but to lift children on its shoulders and put pretty girls before it, and caress old women and cripples into favorable positions, so that they may see better. You will wish to leave it before the clubbing begins, and either go home to the slumbers which the whistling and twanging will duly attend; or join the diners going into or coming out of the restaurants, or the throngs strolling down into the fairy realms of Broadway, under the flare of the whiskeys and the actresses.|$|E
6000|$|So then, {{you have}} the child's {{character}} in these four things--Humility, Faith, Charity, and Cheerfulness. That's what {{you have got to}} be converted to. 'Except ye be converted and become as little children'--You hear much of conversion now-a-days; but people always seem to think they have got to be made wretched by conversion,--to be converted to long faces. No, friends, you have got to be converted to short ones; you have to repent into childhood, to repent into delight, and delightsomeness. You can't go into a conventicle but you'll hear plenty of talk of backsliding. Backsliding, indeed! I can tell you, on the ways most of us go, the faster we slide back the better. Slide back into the cradle, if going on is into the grave--back, I tell you; back--out of your long faces, <b>and</b> <b>into</b> <b>your</b> long clothes. It is among children only, and as children only, that you will find medicine for your healing and true wisdom for your teaching. There is poison in the counsels of the men of this world; the words they speak are all bitterness, 'the poison of asps is under their lips,' but, 'the sucking child shall play by the hole of the asp.' There is death in the looks of men. 'Their eyes are privily set against the poor;' they are as the uncharmable serpent, the cockatrice, which slew by seeing. But 'the weaned child shall lay his hand on the cockatrice den.' There is death in the steps of men: 'their feet are swift to shed blood; they have compassed us in our steps like the lion that is greedy of his prey, and the young lion lurking in secret places,' but, in that kingdom, the wolf shall lie down with the lamb, and the fatling with the lion, and 'a little child shall lead them.' There is death in the thoughts of men: the world is one wide riddle to them, darker and darker as it draws to a close; but the secret of it is known to the child, and the Lord of heaven and earth is most to be thanked in that 'He has hidden these things from the wise and prudent, and has revealed them unto babes.' Yes, and there is death--infinitude of death in the principalities and powers of men. As far as the east is from the west, so far our sins are--not set from us, but multiplied around us: the Sun himself, think you he now 'rejoices' to run his course, when he plunges westward to the horizon, so widely red, not with clouds, but blood? And it will be red more widely yet. Whatever drought of the early and latter rain may be, there will be none of that red rain. You fortify yourselves, you arm yourselves against it in vain; the enemy and avenger will be upon you also, unless you learn that it is not out of the mouths of the knitted gun, or the smoothed rifle, but 'out of the mouths of babes and sucklings' that the strength is ordained which shall 'still the enemy and avenger.' ...|$|E

Comparisons with Honeybus were inevitably drawn; the sessions bled into each other causing a reunion in all but name, and record company executives were impressed by this new work that they commissioned an album, Recital, to be released under the Honeybus name. Only test pressings of this exist, as a change in management at the label aborted the planned release.|$|E

5000|$|Princess Cyd has {{received}} a positive response from film critics. Calum Marsh of The Village Voice compared the film favorably to Cone's previous work Henry Gamble's Birthday Party and called it [...] "an endearing, full-hearted comedy of self-discovery and mentorship and love." [...] The film was similarly praised by Jude Dry of IndieWire, who observed, [...] "In his latest film, Princess Cyd, the Chicago-based writer-director renders his deeply human characters so precisely, it's as if they stepped right off the screen <b>and</b> <b>into</b> <b>your</b> living room. The two central women are equal parts charming, awkward, yearning and lost. In short, they're real. Their complexity {{is all the more}} impressive coming from a male filmmaker — Cone proves it's possible for men to write sexually liberated, empowered, autonomous women." ...|$|E
5000|$|Berry's 2014 novel Interference {{received}} mixed reviews. Writing in the National Post, Emily M. Keeler said, [...] "Berry’s {{better than}} most at weaving {{in and out of}} the perspectives of so many characters without losing steam; she manages her cast with considerable skill, and her approach makes it all the more enjoyable to piece together the goings on in fictional Parkville. Interference is like a short drive through a strange suburb, that rich domain of beautiful, frustrated youth and workaday adulthood; Berry’s Parkville is a place many Canadians will recognize, but altered just slightly enough through her comic noir lens to let a little of the wit, and the fear, bleed out of the novel <b>and</b> <b>into</b> <b>your</b> head." [...] By contrast in The Globe and Mail, reviewer Emily Donaldson suggested [...] "Berry’s characters are so thinly developed it’s difficult to imagine them stripped of their banal problems." ...|$|E
5000|$|Under Downs as host, 20/20 {{changed into}} a more {{standard}} yet unique newsmagazine and received kinder reviews from critics. The program was originally launched as a summer replacement series; it was then presented on a once-a-month basis during the 1978-79 television season, before being given a regular weekly timeslot on Thursdays at 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time beginning May 31, 1979. Ratings were generally very good {{during the summer months}} during its eight years on Thursday nights despite competition from Knots Landing on CBS and Hill Street Blues on NBC. It was around this time that the program started using the Brock Brower-written signoff line [...] "We're in touch, so you be in touch" [...] to end each program, which continues to be used to now (the program also used the line [...] "Around the world <b>and</b> <b>into</b> <b>your</b> home, {{the stories that touch your}} life" [...] as the introduction during the show's opening titles for much of the 1990s).|$|E
