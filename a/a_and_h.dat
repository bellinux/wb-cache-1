An ordinary cube has 8 corners, they could be labeled A to H, with A opposite H, B opposite G, and so on. In a hemicube, <b>A</b> <b>and</b> <b>H</b> would be treated as the same corner. So would B and G, and so on. The edge AB would become the same edge as GH, and the face ABEF would become the same face as CDGH. The new shape has only three faces, 6 edges and 4 corners.|$|E

40|$|Neosporosis, {{caused by}} an {{intracellular}} parasite, Neospora caninum, is an infectious disease primarily of cattle and dogs. It occurs worldwide and causes huge damages to dairy farms. In this study, we immunized mice with recombinant surface-associated protein 1 of N. caninum (rNcSAG 1) and developed two novel monoclonal antibodies, <b>A</b> 10 <b>and</b> <b>H</b> 3, against NcSAG 1 using phage-display technology. Both clones bound to purified rNcSAG 1 and the half maximal inhibitory concentrations of <b>A</b> 10 <b>and</b> <b>H</b> 3 are 50 and 72 nM of rNcSAG 1, respectively. In immunofluorescence assays, both <b>A</b> 10 <b>and</b> <b>H</b> 3 Fabs bound to N. caninum parasites. Direct detection of N. caninum parasites was developed firstly using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with <b>A</b> 10 <b>and</b> <b>H</b> 3. Binding of <b>A</b> 10 <b>and</b> <b>H</b> 3 antibodies to rNcSAG 1 was also inhibited by some certain anti-N. caninum antibodies in the neosporosis-positive cattle sera, suggesting they might bind to the same epitope...|$|R
