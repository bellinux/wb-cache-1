The employing organisation is Medtronic, a US-based multinational in the medical devices industry with an Irish subsidiary located in Galway. With both one-way and two-way communication media, employees are regularly informed about their defined benefit (DB) pension scheme {{and the opportunity to}} increase their pension savings through an <b>Additional</b> <b>Voluntary</b> <b>Contribution</b> (AVC). In spite of this, research conducted in 2009 found that only 18 % of employees are contributing to their AVC (Maloney and Morris, 2010).

Only contributions made after April 6, 1997 are required to increase at the LPI rate, so these contributions are known as post 1997 excess contributions.The rules were later amended by the Pensions Act 2004 so that excess contributions made after April 6, 2005 only had to increase at the RPI rate capped at 2.5% instead of 5%.|$|R

40|$|A {{frequently}} identified goal of U. S. {{farm price}} and income support programs {{is to reduce}} the income risk that farmers face—to provide a “safety net ” that would reduce the chances of financial failure or inadequate incomes to support family living. In addition to direct payments to farmers and subsidies for crop insurance, {{it has been suggested that}} farmers might be encouraged by government policy to invest in savings accounts, with the funds being available not only to mitigate financial risk, but also to pay expenses during the retirement years. This savings account has been suggested as both a full or partial replacement for existing farm program payments. In essence, the focus of such programs would be to encourage farmers to allocate funds in high-income years to financial reserves that are available to pay farm and family living expenses in low-income years. This publication presents the general ideas behind a farmer savings account to help readers better understand how it might be a part of future farm policy. A government-assisted farmer savings program could be implemented in a number of ways. Here are three possibilities (among many). • Government payments could be directly deposited in qualified savings accounts, with the opportunity for <b>additional</b> <b>voluntary</b> <b>contributions</b> from farm income. • Special savings accounts could be created for farmers where funds deposited would be tax deductible or receive other tax advantages. Earnings in such accounts could be allowed to accumulate on a tax-free basis similar to what is now allowed with qualified retirement accounts, college savings accounts, etc. • Government bonds that carry higher than market rates of interest could be issued as special savings instruments for qualified participants in a farmer saving program...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the effects}} of social security reforms on saving in Britain. We use the British Household Panel Survey to investigate the interactions between <b>voluntary</b> <b>additional</b> <b>contributions</b> to personal pension plans (PPP) and saving in conventional forms.

Results suggest that not only have private pension schemes not crowded out private saving, but actually they have increased it too.

40|$|We study {{a unique}} {{microcredit}} model with zero interest rate and <b>voluntary</b> <b>contributions,</b> used by Akhuwat, a microfinance organization operating in Pakistan since 2001. Borrowers {{are encouraged to}} give any amount they wish to the organization every month, {{in addition to the}} instalment for the repayment of principal. These <b>voluntary</b> <b>contributions</b> result in an implicit interest rate of around 4. 5 %. The analysis of monthly data on <b>voluntary</b> <b>contributions</b> provide evidence that the organization is rewarding borrowers for their contributions by giving them repeat loans and that borrowers are strategically timing these <b>voluntary</b> <b>contributions</b> through their loan cycle to maximize impact. In the case of joint liability loans, borrowers in poorly performing groups make on average higher <b>voluntary</b> <b>contributions,</b> and <b>voluntary</b> <b>contributions</b> in a previous loan cycle correlate with borrower discipline in a subsequent loan cycle. Thus, <b>voluntary</b> <b>contributions</b> can signal borrower quality, and joint liability borrowers appear to be using them to signal their quality independently of their group...|$|R

The determinants of these two types of <b>voluntary</b> <b>contributions</b> are analyzed using the survey ¿Vie associative¿ conducted in 1992 by Insee.

40|$|The under-provision {{of public}} goods under <b>voluntary</b> <b>contributions</b> is well {{understood}} {{as the result of}} bidirectional positive externalities associated with <b>voluntary</b> <b>contributions.</b> In this survey, I apply the reasoning in Morgan (2000) to argue that schemes which introduce negative externalities associated with <b>voluntary</b> <b>contributions</b> increase the level of public good provision because they fully or partially offset the standard positive externalities. I argue that other previous works, like Andreoni and Bergstrom (1996) and Falkinger (1996), have also used this idea without apparently recognizing it.

40|$|In {{the wake}} of school finance reforms that limit local tax revenue and, more recently, state budget cuts that have {{threatened}} K- 12 education spending, {{an increasing number of}} schools and school districts have appealed to parents and communities for <b>voluntary</b> <b>contributions</b> to augment school resources. Of course, not all schools benefit equally from these contributions leading to a common concern that <b>voluntary</b> <b>contributions</b> create inequities in school funding across communities. In this paper we examine the size and distribution of <b>voluntary</b> <b>contributions</b> to California’s K- 12 public schools in 2001. In addition, we examine how contributions have affected the distribution of resources across schools. Our results indicate that while some schools have been quite successful in raising <b>voluntary</b> <b>contributions,</b> overall, contributions have not led to large inequities in the distribution of resources among high- and low-income schools. Specifically, schools raising particularly high levels of contributions, over $ 500 per pupil, do tend to have more resources, but these schools are rare and very small. Over ninety-nine percent of California elementary students attend schools where contributions have almost no effect on inputs. <b>Voluntary</b> <b>Contributions,</b> Public School Finance, School Resources...|$|R

40|$|School-based {{management}} programs aim {{to improve education}} outcomes by involving parents in allocation decisions about external funds transferred to the school. This paper explores the effects of two school-based {{management programs}} on parental investment in schools via <b>voluntary</b> <b>contributions.</b> One program provides both a cash grant and a matching scheme for privately raised funds. Difference-in-differences estimation shows that parents in richer schools increased <b>voluntary</b> <b>contributions</b> by 28 percent, while parents in poorer schools decreased <b>voluntary</b> <b>contributions</b> by 11 percent. This implies that a matching scheme results in higher inequality in resources available to schools. The second program provides only a cash grant to poor schools. Based on a randomized control, estimation shows that parents use 83 percent of the grant to substitute for <b>voluntary</b> <b>contributions.</b> A cash grant alone for poor schools results {{in an increase in}} resources available to the school in less than the cash grant transfer...|$|R

We first estimate a probit model with selection for the probability of making these <b>voluntary</b> <b>contributions.</b> We then estimate a random-effects tobit regression for the amounts contributed and compare the results with those of a similar regression for conventional saving. Our findings suggest that <b>voluntary</b> <b>contributions</b> to PPPs are made essentially for retirement purposes, whereas conventional saving is undertaken for precautionary motives. The former type of saving is thus unlikely to offset the latter completely. ...|$|R
