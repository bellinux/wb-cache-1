Offstage Beyoncé says that while she likes to dress sexily, her onstage dress [...] "is absolutely for the stage."

500|$|Elias Kifle Maraim Beyene, a {{survivor}} from Ethiopia being {{asked about his}} memory of Michael Jackson after his death remembers: [...] "I won't ever forget Michael Jackson because his contribution to the song We are the World had a very significant effect on my life. I am 50 now but 25 years ago I was living in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, which {{at that time was}} suffering from a long drought and famine. It was a terrible situation. Lots of people became sick and many more died. Around one million people in all were killed by the famine. In 1984 Michael Jackson, along with a number of other leading musicians, made the song We are the World to raise money for Africa. We received a lot of aid from the world and I {{was one of those who}} directly benefitted from it. The wheat flour that was distributed to the famine victims was different to the usual cereal we bought at the market. We baked a special bread from it. The local people named the bread after the great artist and it became known as Michael Bread. It was soft <b>and</b> <b>delicious.</b>|$|E

500|$|John DiBiase of Jesus Freak Hideout gave Revelation four-and-a-half {{out of five}} {{stars and}} commented that [...] "If the album doesn't grab the {{listener}} from Powell's soulful southern drawl and an accompanying acoustic before [...] "This Is Who I Am" [...] breaks wide open, closer attention to the words and themes that permeate the album should bring to light what is {{actually one of the}} strongest records so far this year" [...] and stated that [...] "Revelation is an honest, emotional, vulnerable, beautiful, <b>and</b> <b>delicious</b> southern rock record"; however, he also stated that [...] "only fault [...] may be that its greatest strengths double as a minor weakness". He elaborated that the album's second half, despite consisting of [...] "wonderful" [...] songs that he wouldn't think to leave out, was slightly worse than the album's first half, which he characterized as having an edgier sound. Debra Akins of Gospel Music Channel described Revelation as [...] "a solid exclamation of who Third Day is musically, while underscoring the cultural relevancy they've continued to display over the years" [...] and also praised the album as a whole, commenting that [...] "there are no throw-away tracks on this CD, and that's a rarity in today's fast-paced, song-driven music industry".|$|E
500|$|Reviewing the 2006 reissue of Living in the Material World for Q magazine, Tom Doyle {{included}} {{it among}} the album's best three tracks and wrote: [...] "the introspective moods of The Light That Has Lighted The World and Who Can See It, with their ornate instrumentation and weepy vocals, are lovely things." [...] Former Mojo editor Mat Snow describes Material World as [...] "a treat for the ears" [...] and, while conceding Harrison's limitations as a singer compared with Lennon and McCartney, he writes that Harrison [...] "worked hard to ensure the choruses of... 'Who Can See It' caught the ear with their deep <b>and</b> <b>delicious</b> emotion". In his review of the 2014 reissue of Harrison's Apple catalogue, for Classic Rock, Paul Trynka refers to Material Word as an album that [...] "sparkles with many gems"; of these, he adds, [...] "it's the more restrained tracks – Don't Let Me Wait Too Long, Who Can See It – that entrance: gorgeous pop songs, all the more forceful for their restraint." [...] New Zealand Herald journalist Graham Reid writes of Harrison [...] "sound battered by recent events and the Beatle legacy" [...] on [...] "Who Can See It", yet he cites the song as a [...] "standout" [...] on an album that [...] "can be very moving".|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film four stars {{out of four}} and said: [...] "The film offers one sensational {{sequence}} after another, all set around these two intriguing characters who seem opposites but share pragmatic, financial and personal issues." [...] Ebert also added, [...] "had I not been prevented from seeing it sooner because of an injury, {{this would have been}} on my year's best films list." [...] Peter Bradshaw, film critic for The Guardian, awarded the film five stars, writing: [...] "I can only say Django delivers, wholesale, that particular narcotic and delirious pleasure that Tarantino still knows how to confect in the cinema, {{something to do with the}} manipulation of surfaces. It's as unwholesome, deplorable <b>and</b> <b>delicious</b> as a forbidden cigarette." [...] Writing in The New York Times, critic A. O. Scott compared Django to Tarantino's earlier Inglourious Basterds: [...] "Like Inglourious Basterds, Django Unchained is crazily entertaining, brazenly irresponsible and also ethically serious in a way that is entirely consistent with its playfulness." [...] Designating the film a Times [...] "critics" [...] pick, Scott said Django is [...] "a troubling and important movie about slavery and racism." [...] Filmmaker Michael Moore praised Django, tweeting that the movie [...] "is one of the best film satires ever. A rare American movie on slavery and the origins of our sick racist history." ...|$|E

500|$|In his 1996 {{biography}} on the ex-Beatle, Alan Clayson praised Harrison's vocal {{performance on}} a song that, although [...] "naive", [...] "smouldered from the angered question of why a mere pop star rather than a governing body was obliged to pinpoint iniquities", Clayson adding that [...] "never had his pipes been so adept" [...] as on Material World. To Greg Kot, writing in Rolling Stones posthumous tribute to Harrison, [...] "The Day the World Gets 'Round" [...] and the ballad [...] "Who Can See It" [...] "aspire to a hymnlike calm but never rise to the transcendent heights of [...] ". Writing for Blogcritics, Seattle-based music critic Chaz Lipp views the production on Material World as [...] "meticulous" [...] and superior to its predecessor, such that [...] "he delicate melodies of songs like 'The Day the World Gets 'Round' and 'Be Hear Now' are never lost in bombast." [...] In his review of the 2006-remastered album, for Mojo magazine, Mat Snow wrote of [...] "this long overdue reissue" [...] being [...] "worth it alone for four wonderful songs", {{one of which was}} [...] "The Day the World Gets 'Round".
