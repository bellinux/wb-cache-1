5|$|Children of Mana was {{designed}} by series creator Koichi Ishii, directed by Yoshiki Ito, and produced by Takashi Orikata and Katsuji Aoyama. The game was a moderate commercial success: it sold 100,000 copies in its first week of release, and over 280,000 copies in Japan {{by the end of}} 2006. While critics praised the graphics and music as beautiful and unique, they found the combat simplistic and repetitive, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> insubstantial.|$|E
5|$|Dawn of Mana was designed, directed, and {{produced}} by series creator Koichi Ishii. The script {{was written by}} Ryo Akagi, based on a story created by Masato Kato, and the music was composed by a group led by Kenji Ito. The game was a moderate commercial success: it sold 229,000 copies in its first ten days of release in Japan, and over 410,000 copies worldwide {{by the end of}} 2008. While critics praised the graphics and music as beautiful and lush, they found the leveling system annoying, the combat controls difficult and frustrating, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> trite.|$|E

5|$|Disney {{initially}} envisioned Toy Story 2 as a direct-to-video sequel. The film began {{production in}} a building separated from Pixar, on a small scale, {{as most of the}} main Pixar staff were busy working on A Bug's Life (1998). When story reels proved promising, Disney upgraded the film to theatrical release, but Pixar was unhappy with the film's quality. Lasseter <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> team redeveloped the entire plot in one weekend. Although most Pixar features take years to develop, the established release date could not be moved and the production schedule for Toy Story 2 was compressed into nine months.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert {{adapted the}} stories of H.M.S. Pinafore and The Mikado into children's books called The Pinafore Picture Book <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Story</b> of The Mikado giving, in some cases, backstory that is {{not found in the}} librettos. Many other children's books have since been written retelling {{the stories of}} the operas or {{adapting}} characters or events from them. In the 19th century, the most popular Gilbert and Sullivan songs and music were adapted as dance pieces.|$|E
5|$|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone won two {{publishing}} industry awards given for sales rather than literary merit, the British Book Awards Children's Book of the Year and the Booksellers' Association / Bookseller Author of the Year.

A Braille edition was published in May 1998 by the Scottish Braille Press.|$|E

5|$|In August 1792 {{she started}} Catharine or the Bower, which presaged her mature work, {{especially}} Northanger Abbey; {{it was left}} unfinished <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> picked up in Lady Susan, which Todd describes as less prefiguring than Catharine. A year later, she began but abandoned a short play, later titled Sir Charles Grandison or the happy Man, a comedy in 6 acts, which she returned to and completed around 1800. This was a short parody of various school textbook abridgements of Austen's favourite contemporary novel, The History of Sir Charles Grandison (1753), by Samuel Richardson.|$|E
5|$|In August 2017, HBO officially greenlit a third season, with Mahershala Ali cast as {{the lead}} character, playing Wayne Hays, a state police detective from Northwest Arkansas.

5|$|In {{the latest}} {{incarnation}} of X-Factor, written by Peter David, depowered mutant Rictor and his longtime friend Shatterstar (with whom he'd had an ambiguous relationship) were shown in an on-panel kiss. After {{the issue was}} published, Peter David confirmed Rictor and Shatterstar's bisexuality in his blog and expressed his desire to develop the relationship between them further. Shortly after, one of Shatterstar's creators, Rob Liefeld, expressed his disapproval of Peter David's decision. Despite his complaints, however, both Peter David and Marvel editor-in-chief Joe Quesada have defended the development, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> will most likely go on as planned.|$|E

5|$|Nixon {{refused to}} answer further {{questions}} about the Fund, and attention turned to Stevenson's fund, especially as its details became clear. Governor Stevenson's fund, which proved to total $146,000, had been used for such expenditures as Christmas gifts to reporters, dues for private clubs, and to hire an orchestra for a dance his son was hosting. Taking a leaf from Nixon's book, the Democrats {{refused to answer}} questions about the governor's fund. Both parties were eager to bury the matter, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> died.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the other}} boys ran {{across the street to}} tell Curtis Jones what {{happened}} in the store.

Till said he wanted to return home to Chicago. Carolyn's husband Roy Bryant was on an extended trip hauling shrimp to Texas and did not return home until August 27.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps {{this story}} was simply content to show {{absolute}} power corrupting absolutely.

5|$|Some reviewers {{praised the}} scenery and overall {{production}} quality, considering the film {{an improvement over}} staged adaptations of the novel.

The following year, a film adaptation of an unrelated Evans novel, Beulah, was marketed as a sequel. As with most Balboa films, St. Elmo is now believed lost.|$|E
