40|$|Objective: The paper {{analysed}} {{the development}} of four countries’ hospital <b>accreditation</b> <b>systems</b> to assess and compare their use of quality indicators in the accreditation process. Method and material: Snowball sampling {{was applied to the}} literature using keywords such as Joint Commission, Accreditation Canada, Australian Council for Healthcare Standards, Haute Autorite de Sante and hospital accreditation. Results: Differences and similarities between the compared systems were identified across the areas of basic hospital accreditation elements, implementation patterns of <b>accreditation</b> <b>systems,</b> and their uses of quality indicators in the accreditation processes. Conclusion: Whilst clinical indicators are the primary measures used by the <b>accreditation</b> <b>systems,</b> there is an increasing focus on the use of other quality indicators such as patient experiences. The multi-dimensional nature of quality measures has changed the accreditation process from static on-site investigations into dynamic observations from both health workers’ and patients’ perspectives...|$|R
40|$|The <b>accreditation</b> <b>systems</b> of the United States, Canada, and Australia {{have been}} {{restructured}} {{to reflect the}} adoption by health services of the industrial model of continuous quality improvement. The industrial model of quality makes assumptions about management structures and the relation of process to outcome which are not readily transferable to the assessment of quality in health care. The <b>accreditation</b> <b>systems</b> have therefore had to adapt the principles of continuous quality improvement to reflect the complex nature of health service organisations and the often untested assumptions about the relation between process and outcome...|$|R

25|$|There {{were a few}} {{attempts}} to make a positive impact and educational reform from the civil community in Egypt but those efforts remained very limited on {{their impact on the}} educational process. Education crisis in Egypt is very complicated, public education is not capable of providing quality education and is hardly providing any education with the shortage in facilities, lack of trained educators and inflation in classes. Private (including International) is still incapable of reform for the lack of interest, shortage in trained educators, defective curricula, commercialization of education and finally a customized <b>accreditation</b> <b>system</b> that involves the irrevocable licensure of International schools based on candidacy for accreditation while candidacy for accreditation is originally based on the initial efficiency of the school in providing the educational services including its status as a legal education provider that it doesn't get to get unless it is a candidate school, which is setting the cart before the horse.|$|E
500|$|FIS President Kasper {{stated that}} the first test weekend of 8–9 February 2008 [...] "went well" [...] in terms of sports organization. Kasper also {{expressed}} concerns about the cost for accommodation for skiing officials and media for the upcoming events. A spring coordination meeting was held the week of 7 April 2008 that discussed preparations for the event. Among the participants were FIS, the EBU, and marketing partner APF, whom focused on {{lessons learned from the}} test events held in February 2008. Coordination group members were pleased in what transpired during the February 2008 test events, including an athletes village that was constructed at the local university. Final competition schedule was confirmed by the FIS Council in its May 2008 meeting in Cape Town, followed by a final inspection on 13 October 2008. Following the final inspection that day, a six-hour press conference was held on the status of preparations. Detailed reports were given on the test events held in February 2008 and the lessons learned from them. FIS President Kasper expressed his support of the organizing committee's efforts to present the best championships ever. Neumannová {{stated that the}} cross country skiing facility at Vesec was ready while the ski jumping facility at Ještěd was ready in the fall once construction of the access road and surrounding area was complete. The main concern of Neumannová's was the weather given the problems with the test events in February and the need for snow making equipment. The Czech government gave the organizing committee an additional CZK 189 million (€ 7.3 million) in financial support. At the end of 2008, the championships were the biggest sports event {{in the history of the}} Czech Republic. On 16 December 2008, FIS Secretary General Lewis, FIS Event and Sponsor Manager Niklas Carlsson, Neumannová, and other key Organizing Committee staff met to discuss promotional activities for the event, including ceremonies, social events, and the <b>accreditation</b> <b>system.</b> That same day, an entire inspection of the team village took place at the Technical University of Liberec where the entire complex was renovated. The students at the university left at the end of January 2009 for the teams to arrive on campus in mid-February.|$|E
