With some exceptions, FMS makes disbursements for all federal agencies through its Regional Financial Centers and Debt Management Operations Center. For fiscal year 2000, FMS reported processing approximately 890 million disbursements totaling more than $ 1. 2 trillion. The centers disburse funds by check, electronic funds transfer (EFT), or Fedwire. FMS reported that these disbursements for fiscal year 2000 included approximately 265 million checks amounting to more than $ 265 billion, approximately 625 million EFTs amounting to more than $ 720 billion, and approximately 47, 000 Fedwires amounting to more than $ 275 billion. The centers also process Automated Standard <b>Application</b> <b>for</b> <b>Payments</b> (ASAP) system enrollments.
