5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{diversification}} in markets and products, Argentina managed to escape the trap of a single-staple economy and sustained its economic growth over six decades. The combined effect of declining prices of textiles and rising prices of livestock products produced dramatic improvements in the terms of trade, which rose 377% between 1810 and 1825 in local prices. Several governors waged campaigns against the natives to increase the available lands, from Juan Manuel de Rosas to Julio <b>Argentino</b> Roca.|$|E
5|$|In 1870, during Sarmiento's presidency, {{total debt}} {{amounted}} to 48 million gold pesos. A year later, it had almost doubled. Avellaneda became president {{after winning the}} 1874 presidential election. The coalition that supported his candidature became the Partido Autonomista Nacional, Argentina's first national party; all the presidents until 1916 would come from this party. Avellaneda undertook the tough actions {{needed to get the}} debt under control. In 1876 convertibility was suspended. The inflation rate rose to almost 20% in the following year, but the ratio of debt to GDP plummeted. Avellaneda's administration was the first to deliver a balance in the fiscal accounts since the mid-1850s. Avellaneda passed on to his successor, Julio <b>Argentino</b> Roca, a much more manageable economic environment.|$|E
5|$|In August 1982, after Mexico had {{announced}} {{its inability to}} service its debt, Argentina approached the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for ﬁnancial assistance, as it too was in serious difficulties. While developments looked positive for a while, an IMF staff team visiting Buenos Aires in August 1983 discovered a variety of problems, particularly a loss of control over wages affecting both the budget and external competitiveness, and the program failed. With the peso quickly losing value to inflation, the new Argentine peso <b>argentino</b> was introduced in 1983, with 10,000 old pesos exchanged for each new peso.|$|E
50|$|In 1984 Olguín {{was sold}} to <b>Argentinos</b> Juniors, where he won a further 2 league titles. In 1985 he helped <b>Argentinos</b> win their first and only Copa Libertadores title. He {{continued}} to play for <b>Argentinos</b> {{until his retirement in}} 1988.|$|R
5000|$|In 1909 <b>Argentinos</b> gained {{affiliation}} with the Argentine Football Association, but in 1912 the club {{was involved in the}} first schism in Argentine football when <b>Argentinos</b> joined the breakaway [...] "Federación Argentina de Fútbol" [...] (FAF). In 1920 <b>Argentinos</b> played a promotion playoff with El Porvenir but it lost 3-2 on aggregate. In 1921 the team secured promotion to the Primera, making its debut in the 1922 season, where <b>Argentinos</b> finished 6th.|$|R
50|$|All {{the trains}} are {{operated}} by the state-owned Trenes <b>Argentinos,</b> which is now {{a part of the}} larger Ferrocarriles <b>Argentinos</b> umbrella company.|$|R
5|$|Pearson welcomed his reports, and on {{his return}} {{immediately}} commissioned him to travel to Patagonia to investigate dramatic rumours of a hairy beast roaming the land. The animal was conjectured by Natural History Museum director Ray Lankester to be a living example of the long-extinct giant ground sloth. Hesketh-Prichard's talent for descriptive narration enthralled the readers of the Daily Express. He explored the area surrounding Lake <b>Argentino,</b> finding one of its feeder lakes, naming it Lake Pearson after his patron, and their connecting river Caterina after his mother. Lake Pearson was subsequently renamed Lake Anita, but the Río Caterina, known for its salmon, retains the name Hesketh-Prichard gave it. The surrounding area {{is now part of}} Los Glaciares National Park.|$|E
5|$|Scotto {{left the}} band in 1991 and was {{replaced}} by drummer Claudio Strunz. This lineup recorded the band's second studio album, Ácido <b>Argentino.</b> Hermética opened for Black Sabbath and Motörhead during their visits to Argentina, but had to cancel their headlining tour in Paraguay. They recorded a live album, En vivo 1993 Argentina, and took part in a concert at a penal facility. They participated in the first Argentine Monsters of Rock festival, which featured Black Sabbath, Slayer, and Kiss. Their last studio album, Víctimas del Vaciamiento, was released in 1994. To promote the album, the group held a concert at the Obras Sanitarias stadium later that year.|$|E
5|$|Although Kirchner {{was known}} to have health problems, his death was unexpected, and had {{a great impact on}} the {{politics}} of Argentina. Kirchner died at an early age, while still being a highly influential figure in politics, despite not being president at the time. Presidents Manuel Quintana, Roque Sáenz Peña and Roberto María Ortiz died in office, but none of them had a political clout comparable to that of Kirchner. President Juan Perón had a similar power and died in office, but his death was not unexpected, as he had already reached the life expectancy of the time. Other figures of the history of Argentina who achieved great political clout, such as José de San Martín, Juan Manuel de Rosas, Julio <b>Argentino</b> Roca, Carlos Pellegrini and Hipólito Yrigoyen, all died when they were already retired from politics, or even abroad.|$|E
50|$|In 1985 <b>Argentinos</b> Juniors {{represented}} South America in the Intercontinental Cup against Juventus F.C. of Italy, {{the game}} {{ended in a}} 2-2 draw, but <b>Argentinos</b> lost in the penalty shootout. <b>Argentinos</b> {{went on to win}} another trophy in 1986. They won 1-0 in the Copa Interamericana against Defence Force of Trinidad and Tobago.|$|R
50|$|Adrián Domenech {{began his}} career playing for <b>Argentinos</b> Juniors in 1978. In 1980, he joined Club Atlético Independiente but he {{returned}} to <b>Argentinos</b> in 1982.|$|R
50|$|Bogado {{began his}} career in 2006 with <b>Argentinos</b> Juniors. In 2008, he spent some time on loan to 2nd {{division}} side Instituto before returning to <b>Argentinos.</b>|$|R
5|$|During {{his short}} time in office, Rodríguez Saá {{announced}} {{the creation of}} a new currency, the <b>argentino,</b> which would have circulated alongside the peso and the dollar. The civil unrest of previous days resurfaced when he announced his cabinet, as it included Carlos Grosso as Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers. Grosso was a very unpopular former mayor of Buenos Aires. As a result, Rodríguez Saá gave up his whole cabinet before they could take office, with the sole exception of Rodolfo Gabrielli, in the Interior Ministry. He also declared a sovereign default on the Argentine national debt, which was celebrated by the chamber of deputies. It was the highest sovereign default in history. Those measures, uncharacteristic of an interim president with a brief term of office, were rescented by the leaders of the Justicialist party.|$|E
5|$|Ferugliotherium {{is known}} from {{isolated}} teeth, {{the assignment of}} some of which is controversial. The material from the Los Alamitos Formation, which is mostly in the Museo <b>Argentino</b> de Ciencias Naturales Bernardino Rivadavia (MACN) in Buenos Aires, with one tooth in the Museo de La Plata (MLP) in La Plata, Argentina, has been thoroughly described; while there are additional Ferugliotherium fossils from the La Colonia Formation, {{they have not been}} described in detail. Although the fragmentary nature of the known fossils of Ferugliotherium makes it impossible to determine its dental formula with certainty, Gurovich suggested that it had one incisor (possibly two in the upper jaw), no canines, one or two premolars, and two molars {{on each side of the}} lower and upper jaws. However, on the basis of comparisons with Sudamerica, which is known to have had four lower molariforms (molar-like teeth, either premolars or molars) in its lower jaw, Pascual and Ortiz-Jaureguizar suggested in 2007 that Ferugliotherium may also have had four lower molars.|$|E
5|$|Hermética was a thrash metal band, drawing {{influences}} from Motörhead, Megadeth, and Black Sabbath. Their {{music was}} composed primarily by bassist Ricardo Iorio with occasional input from guitarist Antonio Romano, who composed the guitar solos. The band used a counterpoint between the singing styles {{of their two}} vocalists; lead singer Claudio O'Connor's vocals were high pitched, while Iorio had a raucous style of singing. Iorio sang segments of some songs but rarely performed songs in their entirety. Iorio thought that his singing style in Hermética was inferior to his later work with Almafuerte because the songs had not been composed specifically for him. The success of Hermética's second studio album Ácido <b>Argentino</b> allowed the band to increase the budget {{for the production of}} its follow-up, Víctimas del Vaciamiento. Iorio proposed re-recording the band's first album with drummer Claudio Strunz and a higher budget, but the label refused his proposal.|$|E
5000|$|... 1985-1986 saw {{the start}} of European-style seasons. <b>Argentinos</b> {{performed}} well, finishing in {{the top half of}} the table for most of the rest of the 1980s and never fearing relegation, although <b>Argentinos</b> also never really challenged as title contender. By 1988 the majority of the Libertadores champions had gone and <b>Argentinos</b> were a vastly different team.|$|R
50|$|On 22 December 2008 left <b>Argentinos</b> Juniors for 1,4 million euros for the co-ownership, to Corinthians. After several weak performances, he {{returned}} to <b>Argentinos</b> on June 2010.|$|R
50|$|Córdoba {{was formed}} in the storied youth ranks of <b>Argentinos</b> Juniors. He made his debut in the Primera Division Argentina with <b>Argentinos</b> Juniors in a 1-0 victory over Rosario Central on June 10, 2005. After {{spending}} three seasons at the club he was loaned to Club Atlético Tigre in 2007. Once his loan spell concluded, <b>Argentinos</b> Juniors loaned him out to MLS side Real Salt Lake.|$|R
5|$|In 2011, {{two giant}} murals of Evita were {{unveiled}} {{on the building}} facades of the current Ministry of Social Development, located on 9 de Julio Avenue. The works were painted by Argentine artist Alejandro Marmo. On 26 July 2012, to commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of Evita's death, notes were issued in a value of 100 pesos. The controversial effigy of Julio <b>Argentino</b> Roca was replaced by that of Eva Duarte, making her the first actual woman to be featured on the currency of Argentina. The image in the notes {{is based on a}} 1952 design, whose sketch was found in the Mint, made by the engraver Sergio Pilosio with artist Roger Pfund. The printing totals 20 million notes; {{it is not clear whether}} the government will replace the notes that feature Roca and the Desert Campaign.|$|E
5|$|The Argentine–Chilean naval {{arms race}} was {{extremely}} expensive for both countries. The Argentine government {{was able to}} purchase £4,534,800 worth of ships between 1890 and 1898 with large foreign loans, which were given to them despite the country's role in the Baring crisis of 1890. The government's total foreign debt reached 421million gold pesos by 1896. As for Chile, it was forced {{to take out a}} £2million pound loan in order to purchase Krupp weaponry, and this combined with its other loans led the banking industry to suspend loans to Chile until the diplomatic crisis with Argentina was solved. Both the Argentine President Julio <b>Argentino</b> Roca and American ambassador to Argentina William Paine Lord ascribed the ending of the arms race to the diminished credit of Argentina and Chile.|$|E
5|$|The band {{searched for}} a new concert venue because the Arlequines was {{becoming}} too small for their growing audience. They moved to Cemento, {{where most of the}} 1991 concerts took place. They played with the bands Todos tus muertos, Pobres pibes, Nepal, Militia, Devastación, Rapier, and Resistencia Nativa. Their albums Hermética and Intérpreteswhich had been released as LP records and cassettes, were released by Tripoli on a single compact disc. Tony Scotto left the band because of creative differences and was replaced by Claudio Strunz. Strunz, drummer of the band Heinkel and owner of Hermética's rehearsal room, had already played with the band during practice sessions when Scotto was absent. He made his debut at Sunchales. The band appeared in two television programs, La movida del '90 and Siglo XX Cambalache and recorded their second full-length album, Ácido <b>Argentino,</b> with 150 hours of recording time at the Aguilar studios. It was released at Cemento on December 27.|$|E
50|$|In 1981 Maradona {{was sold}} to Boca Juniors in 1981 for a fee of £1 million. Maradona never won a title with <b>Argentinos</b> but his massive {{transfer}} fee allowed <b>Argentinos</b> to strengthen their squad for the years ahead, although his departure almost cost <b>Argentinos</b> {{their place in the}} top flight as they needed a last day win over San Lorenzo to avoid relegation at San Lorenzo's expense.|$|R
50|$|Ortigoza {{started his}} career in 2004, playing for <b>Argentinos</b> Juniors. In 2005, he had a brief loan spell with Nueva Chicago before {{returning}} to <b>Argentinos.</b> In 2007, he began to establish himself as an important member of the first team squad and in 2009 he became a near permanent fixture in the first team squad after the appointment of Claudio Borghi as the manager of <b>Argentinos</b> Juniors.|$|R
50|$|In 1927 the two {{separate}} football associations were reunified and <b>Argentinos</b> {{played in a}} massive 34 team league. Later, the league was expanded to 36 and <b>Argentinos</b> managed to keep its place until 1930.|$|R
5|$|Cavallo began {{a second}} wave of privatizations with the Correo <b>Argentino</b> and the nuclear power plants. He also limited {{the amount of money}} {{released}} to the provinces. He still had the full support of Menem, despite growing opposition within the PJ. The Mexican Tequila Crisis impacted the national economy, causing a deficit, recession, and a growth in unemployment. The government further reduced public expenditures, the wages of state workers, and raised taxes. The deficit and recession were reduced, but unemployment stayed high. External debt increased. The crisis also proved that the economic system was vulnerable to capital flight. The growing discontent over unemployment and the scandals caused by the privatization of the Correo led to Cavallo's removal as minister, and his replacement by Roque Fernández. Fernández maintained Cavallo's fiscal austerity. He increased the price of fuels, sold the state shares of YPF to Repsol, fired state employees, and increased the value-added tax to 21%. He also undertook more privatization. A new labor law was met with resistance, both by Peronists, opposition parties, and unions, and could not be approved by Congress. The 1997 Asian financial crisis and the 1998 Russian financial crisis also affected the country with consequences that lasted longer than the Tequilla Crisis and started a depression.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, {{during the}} {{presidency}} of Julio <b>Argentino</b> Roca, Belgrano's body was exhumed from the atrium of Santo Domingo, to be moved into a mausoleum. This was done on 4 September, by a government commission which included Dr. Joaquín V. González (ministry of interior), Pablo Riccheri (ministry of war), Gabriel L. Souto (president of the commission), Fray Modesto Becco (from the convent), Carlos Vega Belgrano and coronel Manuel Belgrano (descendants of Belgrano), Dr. Armando Claros (subsecretary of the Interior), Dr. Marcial Quiroga (Health Inspector of the Army), Dr. Carlos Malbrán (president of the National Department of Health), Coronel Justo Domínguez, and doctors Luis Peluffo and C. Massot (Arsenal of War). The exhumation revealed a number of preserved bones, pieces of wood, and nails. The bones were placed on a silver plate, and the following day {{there was a great}} controversy in the press: the newspaper La Prensa announced that Joaquín V. González and Riccheri had stolen a pair of teeth. Both were returned the following day. Gonzalez declared that he intended to show the tooth to his friends, and Riccheri that he took one to Belgrano's biographer, Bartolomé Mitre.|$|E
25|$|Argentines' {{love for}} horses can be {{experienced}} in several ways: horse racing at the Hipódromo <b>Argentino</b> de Palermo racetrack, polo in the Campo <b>Argentino</b> de Polo (located just across Libertador Avenue from the Hipódromo), and pato, {{a kind of}} basketball played on horseback that was declared the national game in 1953.|$|E

50|$|Yudica {{made his}} return to the big time by leading <b>Argentinos</b> Juniors to victory in Nacional.

The most significant result in this 14-game run was in their penultimate fixture against title challengers Independiente, which saw <b>Argentinos</b> come back from 1-3 down to win 4-3, which featured two goals in the final minutes of the game to seal the win and leave <b>Argentinos</b> top of the table with one game to play.
