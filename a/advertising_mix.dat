50|$|The {{ultimate}} goal of the planner {{is to work with}} consumers as partners {{in the process of developing}} advertising. This relationship with the consumer allows planners to involve their input at every stage of the process and to inform and inspire creative ideas that guide and validate the resulting campaign in the consumers interests. Planners are the “consumer’s representative” of the account team. According to Jon Steel advertising can exist without account planning, but planners add an element of creativity to the <b>advertising</b> <b>mix.</b> They are typically people who are interested in meeting people and talking to the consumers. Planners want to find out what makes people tick and use that market information and research data to guide the campaign process. It is the planner’s job to take all this information and funnel it down into a short idea that helps inspire and directionalize the creative department.|$|E

40|$|Location {{plays an}} {{important}} role in current mobile applications and services whether it is social applications, gaming, entertainment or mobile commerce, the global market for LBS is projected to reach £ 13. 26 billion by 2015 and a subscriber base of 1. 24 billion. It is the well proven winning combination of location awareness and ubiquitous nature of mobile phones that is responsible for a steady increase in mobile data usage and it is predicted that by 2013 mobile devices will overtake PC as the most common web access device. Applications and services utilising traditional location tracking approaches of GPS and Cell id fail to provide a good experience indoors so alternative location positioning schemes need to be utilised. These applications claim to be truly ubiquitous however whether they are social applications, commerce, advertising, gaming or entertainment applications they still tend to engulf the user in computing process, for example if we consider location based or mobile mixed reality gaming it becomes clear that although location plays a part in the game play actual user interaction with the localised environment is often limited., The work presented in this thesis explores the utilisation of implied location technologies to bridge the gap left by the current applications. In particular it investigates the use of ~ Bluetooth and NFC in to locate the mobile user. The approach taken by this research is to look at utilisation of implied location technologies across a range of applications and services through real world experimentation. In particular their effectiveness has been researched in relation to three areas considered likely to benefit most from location based information: mobile <b>advertising,</b> <b>mixed</b> reality gaming and mobile social applications. Work carried out on providing location based advertising for existing mobile users via Bluetooth has shown that implied location technologies can be very useful to improve the diminishing response to mobile <b>advertising.</b> <b>Mixed</b> reality game, Pac-Lan demonstrates that NFC can not only be utilised as an implied location positioning scheme but also for improving user interaction with the real world. It has also shown that effective user interaction with physical objects can be achieved through NFC resulting in an enhanced user experience. Results presented within have also shown that implied location positioning schemes are effective in mixed reality gaming context and can lead to interesting tactics developing over subsequent game play. From a mobile social application perspective the work presented here shows that through use of NFC social inclusion can be achieved at both individual and group level. Moreover utilising NFC for mobile social applications can help achieve a symbiosis between user, device and environment where interaction space is not simply the space where interaction amongst users takes place but is an integral part the of the experience.

40|$|We {{estimate}} the incentives {{to get ahead}} by hurting rivals {{in the context of}} comparative advertising. To do this, we watched all ads broadcast by the US OTC analgesics industry for a 5 -year period and coded them according to which brands target which rival brands in comparisons. Data on how much was spent airing each ad then allows us to determine the dollar amounts spent in these attacks. We take these data to a structural model of targeting in which comparative advertising has a direct e¤ect of pushing up own brand perception along with pulling down the brand images of targeted rivals. Brands optimal choices of <b>advertising</b> <b>mix</b> yield simple oligopoly equilibrium relations between advertising levels (for di¤erent types of advertising) and market shares. These we estimate by using as instruments the prices of equivalent generic drugs; and we use medical news shocks as further explanatory variables.

40|$|Over {{the years}} {{studies have been}} done that sought to {{establish}} the effect of advertising on building brand equity for producers of physical products. This study in particular focuses on the impact of advertising (print, outdoor and broadcast) on building brand equity for universities in Zimbabwe. The research was {{based on the premise that}} little research has been done on establishing advertising’s role in building brand equity for non–profit making organisations in a highly competitive marketing environment. A quantitative survey research was employed which adopted a descriptive survey design to explore the relationship between selected advertising variables and brand equity. A sample size of 150 (90 males and 60 females) was used to gather data using a structured questionnaire. A quota sampling technique was adopted proportionately (11 males and 4 females) from the selected institutions. A multiple regression model was used to establish the correlation between the two variables. Data analysis was executed using SPSS version 14. 0. The overall findings of the research were reflective of the fact that Zimbabwean universities have not been proactively employing advertising in order to build brand equity and the implications are that there is need for those running these institutions to take a more positive and proactive stance to effectively blend advertising variables in order to develop hybrid <b>advertising</b> <b>mix</b> strategies which can help their not-for-profit making organizations to develop reputable brands capable of attracting a potential large market.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of four independent chapters that study alternative Örmsílong run strategies in imperfectly competitive markets. The Örst chapter, "Comparative vs. Informative Advertising in Oligopolistic Markets", explores the Örmsíincentives to invest in informative and comparative advertising in oligopolistic markets with horizontally di§erentiated products. It is found that, in equilibrium the Örms optimally mix over advertising strategies, combining both informative and comparative advertising. Further, it is shown that the optimal <b>advertising</b> <b>mix</b> always favors the aggressive form of comparative advertising. The chapter also compares equilibrium market outcomes and social welfare under the endogenous advertising portfolio with the respective ones under no advertising, mere informative advertising and mere comparative advertising, and shows that they crucially depend on the intensity of market competition and the e¢ ciency of the advertising technology. The second chapter, "Comparative Advertising in Markets with Network Externalities", investigates the Örmsíincentives to invest in comparative advertising in a spatially di§erentiated duopoly market characterized by network externalities. It is found that Örms often have strong incentives to invest in comparative advertising, with their equilibrium investment levels to be positively related to transportation cost and negatively related to the intensity of network e§ects. More importantly, it is shown that the Örmsílocation distance (or else, their productsí di§erentiation) increases {{in the presence of}} network externalities and decreases in the presence of comparative advertising. The third chapter, "The Speed of Technological Adoption under Price Competition: Twotier vs. One-tier Industries", examines the Örmsí incentives to adopt a new cost reducing technology in vertically related markets, as well as, the e§ects of the vertical relations on the speed of the downstream Örmsíadoption of the new technology. It is found that, independently of the upstream market structure (i. e., upstream separate Örms or upstream monopoly), downstream Örms always have strong incentives to adopt the new technology. More importantly, it is shown that, independently of the upstream market structure, technology adoption may occur earlier in two-tier than in one-tier industries, depending on the intensity of the Önal market competition, the drasticity of the new technology on reducing the downstream Örmsímarginal cost of production and the bargaining power distribution in the market. Moreover, it is found that the Örst technology adoption takes place earlier under upstream monopoly than under upstream separated Örms, when the new technology is su¢ ciently drastic and the Önal market 2 competition is Öerce enough. The forth chapter, "Cournot is more Competitive than Bertrand! Upstream Monopoly with Two-part Tari§s", compares the equilibrium outcomes and social welfare under Cournot and Bertrand downstream competition when the upstream sector is monopolized by a single input provider and the vertical trade is conducted via two-part tari§s contracts. It is found that, in such a setting, a Cournot downstream market turns out to be more competitive than a Bertrand one. In addition, contrary to the conventional wisdom that suggests that Bertrand competition leads to higher social welfare than Cournot competition, it is shown that in vertically related markets with upstream monopolistic market structure and two-part tari§s trading contracts, consumersísurplus and social welfare are higher under Cournot than under Bertrand competition...|$|E

Prior findings on consumers’ attitude towards <b>advertising</b> are <b>mixed.</b> This paper {{is an attempt to}} examine young adults’ attitude towards advertising. We conceptualized a framework to examine the influence of six independent variables namely consumer manipulation, product information, hedonic/pleasure, economic condition, social integration, and materialism on consumers’ attitude towards advertising. Participants were selected from the southern region of Malaysia. The data were collected through personal administration, and had 217 valid responses. The analysis reveals that four of the six hypotheses were supported. Consumer manipulation emerged negative, which is consistent with past findings. These findings would enable practitioners to be more consumer-sensitive to ensure that the advertising campaigns are properly conceived to avoid adverse effects on a firm’s performance. The findings would also benefit consumers in gaining additional understanding on the roles of social networks in persuading specific purchase.
