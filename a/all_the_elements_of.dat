5|$|During {{his student}} days, Gaudí {{attended}} craft workshops, {{such as those}} taught by Eudald Puntí, Llorenç Matamala and Joan Oñós, where he learned the basic aspects of techniques relating to architecture, including sculpture, carpentry, wrought ironwork, stained glass, ceramics, plaster modelling, etc. He also absorbed new technological developments, integrating into his technique the use of iron and reinforced concrete in construction. Gaudí took a broad view of architecture as a multifunctional design, in which every single detail in an arrangement has to be harmoniously made and well-proportioned. This knowledge allowed him to design architectural projects, including <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> his works, from furnishings to illumination to wrought ironwork.|$|E
5|$|Mansaf is a {{very popular}} dish that is usually served during {{important}} events, such as a traditional wedding, engagement, funeral, baptism and circumcision. It is a dish incorporating <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> Palestinian land, such as bread, laban (yogurt) soup, rice, nuts (pine nuts), parsley and lamb, making it an important cultural dish. The meal is oftentimes served the traditional way in a large common plate, a sidr. The meal is usually eaten {{without the use of}} tableware, but rather each person sits beside each other eating from the same large plate.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{chemistry}} {{has been observed}} only {{for the first three}} members of the group. The chemistry of rutherfordium is not very established and therefore the rest of the section deals only with titanium, zirconium, and hafnium. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> the group are reactive metals with a high melting point (1668°C, 1855°C, 2233°C, 2100°C?). The reactivity is not always obvious due to the rapid formation of a stable oxide layer, which prevents further reactions. The oxides TiO2, ZrO2 and HfO2 are white solids with high melting points and unreactive against most acids.|$|E

As {{the head of}} the E-6 Projectile, Target, and Source Group, Critchfield calculated critical masses, and instituted a system of live testing with scale models using 20 mm cannon and 3-inch guns. While full-scale Thin Man tubes took months to produce, these were readily and easily obtained. It was not possible to conduct tests with plutonium, as it was not yet available. Indeed, the actual physical characteristics of the metal were little more than educated guesses at this time.|$|E

He thought that the menu was over complicated, and not <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> the dishes worked together.

5|$|Formed {{out of the}} Division Support Command of the 82nd Airborne Division, {{the brigade}} {{has a long history}} of {{supporting}} the 82nd in numerous contingencies throughout the world. The sustainment brigade supported the division in operations including Operation Just Cause, Operation Urgent Fury, Operation Power Pack and Operation Desert Storm. Recently, the brigade has seen multiple deployments in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The brigade's mission in support of Operation Enduring Freedom-Afghanistan came to an end when responsibility was handed to the 101st Sustainment Brigade during a ceremony at Bagram Airbase on 2 December 2010. For the first time since the Global War on Terror began in 2001, with the exception of Delta Detachment, 82nd Finance, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> the 82nd Sustainment Brigade were home in Fort Bragg. Since then, the 82nd Sustainment Brigade has once again been called upon to assist in OEF Afghanistan by establishing and controlling CMRE operations. On 21 May 2015, the brigade realigned back under the 82nd Airborne Division and became the 82nd Airborne Division Sustainment Brigade.|$|E
5|$|Many castles were {{originally}} built from earth and timber, but had their defences replaced later by stone. Early castles often exploited natural defences, lacking {{features such as}} towers and arrowslits and relying on a central keep. In the late 12thand early 13thcenturies, a scientific approach to castle defence emerged. This led to the proliferation of towers, {{with an emphasis on}} flanking fire. Many new castles were polygonal or relied on concentric defence– several stages of defence within each other that could all function {{at the same time to}} maximise the castle's firepower. These changes in defence have been attributed to a mixture of castle technology from the Crusades, such as concentric fortification, and inspiration from earlier defences, such as Roman forts. Not <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> castle architecture were military in nature, so that devices such as moats evolved from their original purpose of defence into symbols of power. Some grand castles had long winding approaches intended to impress and dominate their landscape.|$|E
5|$|Section 1(2) of the Act {{creates an}} offence which {{includes}} <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> the section 1(1) offence {{with an additional}} element of intending or being reckless as to the endangering of life. The offence lies in possible effects of the defendant's actions {{and it is not}} therefore necessary to prove an actual danger to life. However, there must be a connection between the damage and the mental state of the defendant. In R v. Steer (1986), the defendant fired a gun intending to injure another person, but missed and hit a window instead; it was held that although the intention to endanger life and the fact of damage coexisted, the damage itself did not endanger life. This approach was extended in R v. Webster (1995), in which the relationship between the damage caused and the damage intended was explored. That case involved the throwing of heavy items into the paths of moving vehicles, and it was held that a defendant may be guilty if he intends to endanger life by the actual damage intended, or is reckless that life will be endangered by that damage. Therefore, although a defendant does not necessarily intend to endanger life when he intends to break a car window, ignoring the likely risk that this will cause the driver to swerve into the path of another vehicle, perhaps fatally, constitutes recklessness and is a sufficient causative nexus.|$|E

25|$|The last formula can be {{understood}} directly, by considering the n! permutations of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> S. Each such permutation gives a k-combination by selecting its first k elements.

25|$|All the {{elements}} that can be superimposed on each other by symmetries are said to form a symmetry orbit.

If <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> a given dimension, say all the faces, lie in the same orbit, the figure {{is said to be}} transitive on that orbit. For example, a cube is face-transitive, while a truncated cube has two symmetry orbits of faces.|$|E

Lockheed used the same basic fuselage mold and wing for all these wooden designs (the Explorer wing was unique), hence the close similarities between them. The Orion featured an enclosed cabin with seating for six passengers. The Orion received its Approved Type Certificate on May 6, 1931.|$|E
