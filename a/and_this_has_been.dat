5|$|Other related {{studies have}} also shown {{evidence}} of synaptic alterations and their loss, in the ageing brain. Changes in gene expression alter the levels of proteins in various pathways <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> shown to be evident in synaptic contact dysfunction or loss. This dysfunction has been seen to affect many structures {{of the brain and}} has a marked effect on inhibitory neurons resulting in a decreased level of neurotransmission, and subsequent cognitive decline and disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{founder of}} khất sĩ {{had been a}} {{supporter}} of freeing birds {{as an act of}} compassion, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> continued by some monks and lay people as it is believed to be meritorious, but others have spoken out against {{on the grounds that the}} demand for birds used for such ceremonies merely prompt more people to capture them in the first place.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} version, as {{recorded by}} the Japanese Imperial Army, indicated that he was executed and then hung upside down from a cherry tree due to his 2 days of stubborn retaliation and for not surrendering. (Other accounts say {{that he might have}} been tied to the tree first, then repeatedly bayoneted to death.) British accounts have confirmed that his corpse was found hung upside down after the surrender <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> repeated in a number of authoritative texts on the Malayan campaign.|$|E
2500|$|The {{disparate}} {{groups of}} victims were linked by {{a letter to}} the local police chief written on United States Army stationery. The handwritten note purported to be from a gang of seven white men who were holding a black woman hostage and would kill her if the Stocking Strangler were not apprehended. [...] The Stocking Strangler was believed to be a black man, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> widely reported at the time.|$|R
50|$|False to everyone, {{he first}} tried to involve James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth and others by concocting {{information}} about a Presbyterian plot against the throne, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>having</b> <b>been</b> proved a lie, he pretended to have discovered a Catholic plot against Charles II.

5|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} debates as {{to the nature of}} Van Gogh's illness and its effect on his work, and many retrospective diagnoses have been proposed. The consensus is that Van Gogh had an episodic condition with periods of normal functioning. Perry was the first to suggest bipolar disorder in 1947, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> supported by the psychiatrists Hemphill and Blumer. Biochemist Wilfred Arnold has countered that the symptoms are more consistent with acute intermittent porphyria, noting that the popular link between bipolar disorder and creativity might be spurious. Temporal lobe epilepsy with bouts of depression has also been suggested. Whatever the diagnosis, his condition was likely worsened by malnutrition, overwork, insomnia and alcohol.|$|E
5|$|The adult jaguar is an apex predator, {{meaning it}} exists {{at the top}} of its food chain and is not preyed on in the wild. The jaguar has also been termed a {{keystone}} species, as it is assumed, through controlling the population levels of prey such as herbivorous and granivorous mammals, apex felids maintain the structural integrity of forest systems. However, accurately determining what effect species like the jaguar have on ecosystems is difficult, because data must be compared from regions where the species is absent as well as its current habitats, while controlling for the effects of human activity. It is accepted that mid-sized prey species undergo population increases {{in the absence of the}} keystone predators, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> hypothesized to have cascading negative effects. However, field work has shown this may be natural variability and the population increases may not be sustained. Thus, the keystone predator hypothesis is not accepted by all scientists.|$|E
5|$|The {{costs of}} salvage, clean-up, and {{compensation}} {{are believed to}} have totalled around US$120 million. That included compensation paid by Total to Gulf. Most of the relevant costs were paid by insurance companies and all the various claims and counter-claims were eventually settled out of court. Gulf never reopened the terminal and a feasibility study in 1985 showed that it no longer had any potential use in international oil trade. In 1986, Gulf surrendered its lease on the site to the Irish government. The government used the terminal (after carrying out a limited refurbishment) to hold its strategic oil reserve. Initially, oil movement to and from the terminal was carried out by road. In 1990, {{at the time of the}} first Gulf war, an improvised repair was carried out to the jetty to allow an oil tanker to offload at the terminal on a one-off basis. In 1996, an unloading buoy was installed <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> used since that time.|$|E

5|$|The multi-genus {{approach}} is {{based solely on}} the structure of the male flowers; no other characters could be consistently associated with one genus or another. Four of the genera—Attalea (in a narrow sense), Orbignya, Maximiliana and Scheelea—correspond to four different types of male flowers found within the genus. However, a few species have flowers that are intermediate between these four types, including A.colenda (which Glassman placed in its own genus, Ynesa) <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> used as an argument for the single-genus approach. In addition, there are several hybrids between species that would be considered different genera under Glassman's five-genus system, which has also been used as an argument for placing them in a single genus. In 2009 Alan Meerow and colleagues published a molecular phylogeny of the subtribe which found that some species placed in Orbignya were actually more closely related to species placed in Scheelea than they were to other members of that genus (if the five-genus approach was used), while A.crassispatha, placed in Orbignya by Glassman, was actually a sister to both Scheelea and Orbignya.|$|E
5|$|Two main {{theories}} have emerged {{to explain the}} formation and evolution of the Jupiter trojans. The first suggests that the Jupiter trojans formed in the same part of the Solar System as Jupiter and entered their orbits while it was forming. The last stage of Jupiter's formation involved runaway growth of its mass through the accretion of large amounts of hydrogen and helium from the protoplanetary disk; during this growth, which lasted for only about 10,000 years, the mass of Jupiter increased {{by a factor of}} ten. The planetesimals that had approximately the same orbits as Jupiter were caught by the increased gravity of the planet. The capture mechanism was very efficient—about 50% of all remaining planetesimals were trapped. This hypothesis has two major problems: the number of trapped bodies exceeds the observed population of Jupiter trojans by four orders of magnitude, and the present Jupiter trojan asteroids have larger orbital inclinations than are predicted by the capture model. Simulations of this scenario show that such a mode of formation also would inhibit the creation of similar trojans for Saturn, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> borne out by observation: to date no trojans have been found near Saturn.|$|E
5|$|With the issuing {{of letters}} patent by the Queen of Australia on 15 January 1991, Australia {{became the first}} Commonwealth realm to {{institute}} a separate Victoria Cross award in its own honours system. Although it is a separate award, the Victoria Cross for Australia's appearance is identical to its British counterpart. Canada followed suit when in 1993, Queen Elizabeth II as Queen of Canada signed Letters Patent creating the Canadian Victoria Cross. The Canadian version has a different inscription, {{as well as being}} created from a different unspecified metal. The legend has been changed from FOR VALOUR to the Latin PRO VALORE. Although one Canadian VC has been cast, none has been awarded. In 1999, New Zealand created the Victoria Cross for New Zealand, identical to the Australian and British Victoria Crosses, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> awarded once, on 2 July 2007 to Corporal Willie Apiata.|$|E
