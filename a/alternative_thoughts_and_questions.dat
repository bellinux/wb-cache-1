40|$|The {{research}} {{is a human}} and context oriented study {{in the field of}} information systems (IS), human resource information systems (HRIS), leadership, human resource management (HRM) and tacit knowledge are focused in the study. HRIS and leadership are two main concepts of the research, whereas HRM provides an application area and managerial activities of leadership for HRIS. Tacit knowledge is used to describe and interpret actions that make leadership activities, sensitive and successful. The theoretical framework consists of when thinking and acting in the current way, what kind of information systems it produces, and when thinking and acting in another way, what kind of information systems it creates. The framework has its base on thinking and acting in a conventional, routine and stereotyped way, which hinders the process of observing, finding out, applying <b>and</b> using <b>alternative</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> actions although they might provide useful and innovative solutions or activities for IS design. The main idea is to understand, interpret and to describe the phenomenon of the activities of good leadership and the phenomenon of the role of HRIS in the case organizations. </p...|$|R

The final essays ask what it means to attempt scientific descriptions of reality in words. Can language here ever be anything more than a clumsy approximation of mathematics?

40|$|In this essay, I {{review the}} {{importance}} of languages {{in the study of}} reality, following the well-known aphorisms by Galilei, Bohr and many others. The emphasis on these aspects helps us to understand that it is not meaningful to ask if the reality if "digital" or "analog", but we have to search what is the best language to study some specific aspects of the reality. This problem is particularly felt in the case of frontier science, like quantum gravity, where, in front of several theories (syntaxes) available, there are presently neither observations nor experiments leading to the building of a convincing semantics. You will not find here recipes for a definitive theory. Just <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> <b>questions.</b> Comment: 11 pages, no figures.

The biggest potential from this set of rules, although not exhaustive and illustrated, lays in its capability to distinguish between good and bad scenarios, between real <b>alternative</b> <b>thought</b> experiments <b>and</b> multiple prognoses. This potential becomes more and more important as scenarios increasingly enjoy great popularity while a comprehensive philosophy of future studies is still missing.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{serves as}} an {{opportunity}} to pull together some <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> <b>questions</b> about modes of incorporation as an explanation for ethnic differences in behavior. Specifically, I ask just what is the status of cultural explanations for ethnic behavior if ethnic behavior is approached from a modes-of-incorporation perspective. I ask this question both in connection with individuals of the immigrant generation as well as in connection with the second generation; the concern with the second generation leads me to consider the status of cultural explanations for ethnic behavior in connection with the related conception of segmented assimilation. My argument proceeds through four steps. 1) I note that the modes are introduced as a way out of being left with a large ethnic residual (or unexplained difference) from individual-level analysis and as one more way of contradicting the claim that the residual reflects the operation o...|$|R

40|$|Binge {{drinking}} {{is a matter}} of current social, media and political concern, and the focus of much policy activity in the UK. Binge {{drinking is}} associated with causing a wide range of harm to individuals (e. g. accidents), and the wider community (e. g. crime and disorder). Within the current discourse, binge drinking is seen primarily as a youth issue. Binge drinking is sometimes portrayed as a recent phenomenon, but we know from history that heavy drinking has been endemic in British society over many centuries. Using a contemporary history perspective, this paper explores the concept of binge drinking. It considers the definitions in use, recent shifts in meaning and also the way in which different definitions of binge drinking impact on perceptions of the extent and nature of binge drinking. The paper concludes with some <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> <b>questions</b> about the usefulness of the concept of binge drinking as it currently used, and areas for further research...|$|R

40|$|To {{those who}} {{for many years}} have {{been active in the}} {{promotion}} of nuclear energy, the opposition of the public to the large-scale application of peaceful nuclear energy has come as a surprise. The experience of public hearings and face-to-face discussions with the opponents of nuclear energy has made them aware of modes of <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> criteria of judgement which they had not encountered previously. It is now necessary to reflect on these <b>alternative</b> modes of <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> judgement in order to arrive at new ones, and, by so doing, to improve the basis for rational action. Further, it appears that these <b>alternative</b> modes of <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> judgement and the responses which should be called forth by them do not arise on the occasion of large-scale uses of peaceful applications of nuclear energy alone. The new modes of thought which are being generated in consequence of the opposition are only adumbrations of a broader and more general development in thinking about science and technology. In this paper, I attempt to exemplify this development. I will begin with a brief account of the development of nuclear energy...|$|R
