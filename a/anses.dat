25|$|The {{resulting}} Integrated Social Security System (SIPA), {{administered by}} the <b>ANSES,</b> would be backed by the Sustainability Guarantee Fund (FGS). The FGS is a stabilization fund also established {{in response to the}} 2008 financial crisis, {{as well as to the}} rapid growth in the number of <b>ANSES</b> accounts. This latter development began when the transfer of AFJP accounts was made possible in 2007, and was bolstered by the Social Security Inclusion Plan, which allowed the entry of 2.5 million retirees into the system who had earlier been excluded due to insufficient contributions. Boudou was appointed Economy Minister in July 2009, and he was succeeded by Mortgage Bank Director Diego Bossio.|$|E
25|$|The {{importance}} of <b>ANSES</b> in the nation's social policy was further enhanced in June 2012 with {{the announcement of}} the PRO.CRE.AR initiative. Funded by <b>ANSES</b> and managed by the National Mortgage Bank, the home loan program was projected to make over us$4 billion available over four years to finance the construction of 100,000 new homes for private ownership. These loans would be available to those earning from 1,800 to 30,000 pesos (us$ 400 to 6,650) a month at relatively low interest rates and long terms (4 to 16%, with initial rates 2% below these, and 20 to 30 years, in each case depending on income), and would be complemented by a grant of 1,820 hectares (4,500 acres) by the National Government.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of Argentina's public social programs, aside from {{those related to}} health and housing, are administered by <b>ANSES.</b> Around 95% of Argentine senior citizens (5.7 million) receive <b>ANSES</b> pensions, whose amount is adjusted semi-annually. Argentines {{in the labor force}} earning less than 5,200 pesos (us$350) monthly, are entitled to benefits upon marriage; pregnancy, birth, or adoption of a child; for maternity leave or prenatal care; and for a disability in a child or spouse, as well as to a modest unemployment insurance benefit for up to 6 months. The most important poverty relief program administered by the <b>ANSES</b> is the Asignación Universal por Hijo (Universal Childhood Entitlement). The benefit, 340 pesos (us$70) a month per child, is assigned to 3.6 million children under age 18 (30% of the nation's total), and includes the deposit of 20% of the check in a savings account accessible only upon certification of the child's vaccination and enrollment in school. The program was budgeted at around us$2.5 billion for 2011 (6% of the total). Other recent programs include Conectar Igualdad, which envisaged the purchase of 3 million netbooks for secondary school students and teachers; and PRO.CRE.AR, a subsidized mortgage initiative for moderate income borrowers largely shut out of the nation's tight credit market.|$|E
25|$|These were {{exacerbated}} by numerous factors, including the 1995 recession, and {{a portfolio of}} up to 300,000 fraudulent pensions estimated to cost <b>ANSES</b> nearly a billion dollars annually. The most pervasive challenge to the 20 billion-dollar agency's finances, however, resulted from the 1994 introduction of private pension funds (AFJP), whose enrollees were barred from returning to the <b>ANSES</b> system. He reduced benefit abuse and had charges filed against Cisilino for the no bid IBM contracts, which later resulted in the latter's indictment for fraud. Bramer Markovic, however, was an outsider to President Menem's political circle, and was replaced in January 1998 by Saúl Bouer, a former Mayor of Buenos Aires. Bouer, like his predecessor, faced an ongoing wave of lawsuits filed by those contesting their pension determination, which averaged us$300 a month. Bouer advocated a greater willingness to settle with plaintiffs, {{as well as an}} increase in the us$150 minimum pension. Bouer's proposals were rejected, however, and he resigned in December 1998; he was succeeded by Leopoldo van Cauwlaert.|$|E

25|$|President Cristina Kirchner further {{enhanced}} {{the role of}} <b>ANSES</b> in social policy. She signed the Pensions Mobility Law in 2008, which provides for semi-annual increases in the benefits schedule, thus formalizing a policy adopted by her husband and predecessor, Néstor Kirchner. Minimum pensions, which had been frozen from 1992 to 2002, rose by nearly 600% by 2010. She also enacted the Universal Childhood Entitlement in 2009. The benefit, contingent upon proof of a child's vaccination and enrollment in school, reached 30% of children, and directly resulted in {{a reduction in the}} nation's overall poverty rate from 26% to 22.6% within a year of its implementation.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} {{weakness in}} the private AFJP system was {{the high rate of}} commissions, which exceeded 30% of total monthly contributions, and reached as high as 54%. Private pension funds, moreover, suffered large losses during the crisis from 1998 to 2002, and by 2008 the state subsidized 77% of the funds' beneficiaries, including 40% whose annuities could not cover minimum monthly pensions; of the funds' 9.5 million affiliates, nearly 6 million had stopped making contributions. The 2008 financial crisis exacerbated the problem and in October, President Cristina Kirchner announced plans for the nationalization of the funds' investments of nearly US$30 billion. These accounts were transferred to the <b>ANSES,</b> while leaving contributors the freedom to invest in private pension funds.|$|E
25|$|The <b>ANSES</b> {{is funded}} by an 11% {{withholding}} tax rate and payroll taxes (56%), {{as well as by}} a share of value added and other tax receipts (22%), contributions from the national budget (17%), and interest receipts (4%). Expenses include social security payments (63%), transfers to provincial and other pension funds (20%), family assistance (12%), and the netbook program (2%); administrative expenses were around 2%. The agency maintains a stabilization fund, the Sustainability Guarantee Fund (FGS), which held approximately us$46 billion in a variety of financial instruments as of December 2011, of which 58% was held in government securities, 14% in productive investment, 12% in time deposits, and 9% in the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange.|$|E

Her relationship with her father is “almost nil.” His daughter Fernanda Raverta, who was born in November 1973 and who was three years old when her mother was kidnapped, served manager of the headquarters of <b>ANSES</b> (Administración Nacional de la Seguridad Social), Argentina's social-security administration, under the agency's executive director Diego Bossio. She lives in Mar del Plata and entered the Argentinian legislature in July 2011. She is also a “militant” member of La Cámpora, a political youth organization whose purpose has been to lend support to the governments of Néstor Kirchner and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the loss}} of the Front for Victory's {{absolute}} majorities in both houses of Congress, opposition lawmakers passed a bill on October 14, 2010, reinstating the 82% móvil schedule. The President vetoed the bill, citing the improvements gained by the Inclusion and Mobility Laws, as well as the cost of the bill itself, which would increase <b>ANSES</b> spending by us$10 billion, and force the sale of us$19 billion in securities held by the FGS (56% of the total in 2010). The size and growth of the FGS portfolio, which grew by 60% in US dollar terms in the three years after the absorption of AFJP pensions in late 2008, accompanied an increased reliance on the FGS for national budgetary borrowing requirements. The FGS held us$27 billion in government bonds at the end of 2011; a further US$6.5 billion finances fixed investment by the state or sponsored enterprises.|$|E
25|$|President de la Rúa {{resigned}} amid {{social unrest}} on December 21, upon which interim President Adolfo Rodríguez Saá decreed an emergency benefit cap of 2400 pesos per beneficiary for one year. Appointing Sergio Massa as Director of <b>ANSES</b> in January 2002, President Eduardo Duhalde enacted the first raise {{in the minimum}} pension since 1992 (a one-third increase). Massa was confirmed in the post by President Néstor Kirchner following his May 2003 inaugural. Massa, who had supported the 1993 law that established the private AFJP network, oversaw the voluntary conversion of around two million AFJP accounts to the ANSES' aegis when this choice was made available in March 2007. He remained as director until 2007, {{when he was elected}} Mayor of Tigre. Kirchner's wife and successor, President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, appointed Claudio Moroni in December 2007, and in May 2008, the latter was replaced for Amado Boudou, who had served as the agency's Comptroller since 2001 and as Secretary General since 2007.|$|E

500|$|When {{she first}} took office, Cristina Kirchner {{replaced}} the previous minister of economy, Miguel Gustavo Peirano, {{who had been}} appointed by her husband as former president. Peirano was succeeded by Martín Lousteau in December 2007. He served as {{the first of several}} ministers of economy under her presidency. The attempt to increase of taxes on agricultural exports caused a conflict with the agricultural sector and protests broke out. As a result, taxes were not increased, and Lousteau resigned by April 2008, only a few months after he had been appointed. He was replaced by Argentina's tax agency chief Carlos Rafael Fernández. As an alternative to increasing taxes, and facing debt payments the following year, the government nationalized private pension funds, known as [...] "Las Administradoras de Fondos de Jubilaciones y Pensiones" [...] (AFJP). The amount of money involved in this operation was nearly 30 billion dollars, and debt obligations were nearly 24 billion dollars. The nationalization was justified by the president as government protectionism during the crisis, and compared with the bank bailouts in Europe and the United States. It was criticized as a threat to property rights and the rule of law. Fernández resigned after the Kirchnerite defeat in the 2009 elections, and was replaced by Amado Boudou, president of the <b>ANSES</b> which had worked for that nationalization. Although inflation was nearing 25% and on the rise, Boudou did not consider it a significant problem. In January 2010, Cristina Kirchner created the bicentennial fund employing a necessity and urgency decree in order to pay debt obligations with foreign-exchange reserves. Martín Redrado, president of the Central Bank, refused to implement it, and was fired by another decree. Judge María José Sarmiento annulled both decrees {{on the grounds that the}} Central Bank was independent. Redrado resigned one month later, and was replaced by Mercedes Marcó del Pont.|$|E

Cisilino stepped down in 1995, and was succeeded as director by Alejandro Bramer Markovic.

President de la Rúa transferred <b>ANSES</b> {{from the}} Economy Ministry to the Labor Ministry. The agency was near insolvency {{as a result}} of a 40% fall in contributions since the inaugural of the private AFJP system, a new recession, and mounting lawsuits. Rulings favoring retirees had cost <b>ANSES</b> us$1.4 billion from 1995 to 1999, and us$2.1 billion in 2000, alone. The President placed <b>ANSES</b> under Federal intervention in November in preparation for his proposed abolition of the agency in favor of the private AFJP system. Posse resigned and was succeeded by former Tucumán Province Congressman Martín Campero. The worsening economic crisis prompted President de la Rúa's July 10, 2001, [...] "zero deficit" [...] decree, which led to a 13% cut in public sector wages and pensions alike. Campero resigned, and was succeeded on an interim basis by Douglas Lyall. The crisis forced Lyall to curtail unemployment benefits in order to meet retirement benefit obligations; the resignation of Labor Minister Patricia Bullrich in December led to Lyall's replacement by Gustavo Macchi.|$|E
2500|$|The agency's stock portfolio, {{nearly half}} of which is in Telecom Argentina, Banco Macro, and Siderar, {{prompted}} an initiative in April 2011 to extend the number of companies with an <b>ANSES</b> member in the Board of Directors from 27 to all 42 in which it holds a significant stake. Techint, Siderar's parent company, became the least amenable among these companies to the proposal; a quarter of Siderar stock is owned by <b>ANSES,</b> but company bylaws limited the agency's voting rights to 5%.
