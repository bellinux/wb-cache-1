5|$|On 17 August 1944, Tito {{offered a}} general amnesty <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> the {{division}} {{took advantage of}} this opportunity. During {{the first three weeks}} of September, while hard fighting continued, over 2,000 Bosnians deserted, many taking their weapons with them. They went home, joined the Green Cadres militia or went over to the Ustaše. Many defected to the Partisans, with over 700 having joined the Partisan 3rd Corps by early October.|$|E
5|$|Senator McCarthy's {{first three}} years in the Senate were unremarkable. McCarthy was a popular speaker, invited by many {{different}} organizations, covering a wide range of topics. His aides <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> the Washington social circle described him as charming and friendly, and he was a popular guest at cocktail parties. He was far less well liked among fellow senators, however, who found him quick-tempered and prone to impatience and even rage. Outside of a small circle of colleagues, he was soon an isolated figure in the Senate.|$|E
5|$|After {{the novel}} was published, it caused {{considerable}} discussion. Religious thinkers, Marxist-Leninists, and anarchists decried the novel for not explaining their ideologies in more detail, but literary figures <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> {{the general public}} praised it; this positive reception may {{have been influenced by}} the nascent government's need to promote literature for nation-building. Atheis was translated into Malay before 1970 and into English in 1972; it was also adapted into a film with the same title in 1974. The novel, which received an award from the Indonesian government in 1969, is one of the UNESCO Collection of Representative Works.|$|E

5|$|In November 1380, Parliament {{was called}} {{together}} again in Northampton. Archbishop Simon Sudbury, the new Lord Chancellor, updated the Commons on the worsening situation in France, a collapse in international trade, {{and the risk}} of the Crown having to default on its debts. The Commons were told that the colossal sum of £160,000 was now required in new taxes, and arguments ensued between the royal council and Parliament about what to do next. Parliament passed a third poll tax (this time on a flat-rate basis of 12 pence on each person over 15, with no allowance made for married couples) which they estimated would raise £66,666. The third poll tax was highly unpopular <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> the south-east evaded it by refusing to register. The royal council appointed new commissioners in March 1381 to interrogate local village and town officials in an attempt to find those who were refusing to comply. The extraordinary powers and interference of these teams of investigators in local communities, primarily in the south-east and east of England, raised still further the tensions surrounding the taxes.|$|E
5|$|Starting in the mid-1940s, Carson {{had become}} {{concerned}} {{about the use of}} synthetic pesticides, many of which had been developed through the military funding of science since World War II. It was the US federal government's 1957 gypsy moth eradication program, however, that prompted Carson to devote her research, and her next book, to pesticides and environmental poisons. The gypsy moth program involved aerial spraying of DDT and other pesticides (mixed with fuel oil), including the spraying of private land. Landowners on Long Island filed a suit to have the spraying stopped, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> affected regions followed the case closely. Though the suit was lost, the Supreme Court granted petitioners the right to gain injunctions against potential environmental damage in the future; this laid the basis for later successful environmental actions.|$|E

25|$|After Obama {{announced}} deadlines for the phased {{withdrawal of}} U.S. military forces from Iraq, Congress broadly endorsed the president's plan {{and agreed to}} legislate the stated timetables, though some in the Democratic Party balked at the 50,000-head figure for the transitional force <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> the Republican Party criticised the deadlines' rigidity.
