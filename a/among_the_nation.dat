2500|$|It {{was said}} that some prophets <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> {{foreseen}} the coming of something in the future. [...] Andy Paull notes, [...] "It seems {{that it was a}} tradition among Indians of Early days that a calamity of some sort would befall them every seven years. Once it was a flood. On another occasion disease wiped out X̱wáy̓x̱way. Again it was a snow storm which lasted for three months. The wise men had long prophesied a visitation from a great people, from a powerful body of men. Capt. Vancouver came in 1792, a year which coincided with the seventh year, the year in which some calamity was expected, regarding the form of which there was much trepidation, so that when strange men of strange appearance, white, with their odd boats etc., etc., arrived on the scene, the wise men said 'this may be the fateful visitation, what may it bring us', and took steps to propitiate the all powerful visitors" ...|$|E
60|$|He was a Christian, {{although}} as yet {{he did not}} confess it; but he {{was also}} the most miserable man <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> of the Sons of Fire. The iniquities of his past life had become abominable to him; but he had committed them in ignorance, and he understood that they were not beyond forgiveness. Yet high above them all towered one colossal crime which, as he believed, could never be pardoned to him in this world or the next. He was the treacherous murderer of the Messenger of God; he was in the very act of silencing the Voice that had proclaimed truth in the dark places of his soul and the dull ears of his countrymen.|$|E

60|$|Of Jonadab {{the son of}} Rechab, {{you heard}} three Sundays since, in that noble passage of 2 Kings x. where Jehu, {{returning}} from the slaughter of the idolatrous kings, and going to slay the priests of Baal, meets Jonadab and asks him, Is thy heart right--that is, sound in the worship of God, and determined to put down idolatry--as my heart is with thy heart? We hear {{of him and his}} tribe no more till the days of Jeremiah, 250 years after, in the story from which my text is taken. What Jonadab's reasons may have been for commanding his tribe neither to settle in towns, nor till the ground, {{it is not difficult to}} guess. He may have dreaded lest his people, by settling in the towns, should learn the idolatry of the Israelites. He may have dreaded, likewise, lest they should give way to that same luxury and profligacy in which the Israelites indulged--and especially lest they should be demoralized by that drunkenness of which the prophets speak, as one of the crying sins of that age. He may have feared, too, lest their settling down as landholders or townsmen would cause them to be absorbed and lost <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> of the Israelites, and probably involved in their ruin. Be that as it may, he laid his command upon his tribe, and his command was obeyed.|$|E
6000|$|Now, supposing {{that the}} {{labourer}} speedily and continually presents these general orders, or, in common language, [...] "spends the money," [...] he has neither changed {{the circumstances of}} the nation, nor his own, except in so far as he may have produced useful and consumed useless articles, or vice versâ. But if he does not use, or uses in part only, the orders he receives, and lays aside some portion of them; and thus every day bringing his contribution to the national store, lays by some per-centage of the orders received in exchange for it, he increases the national wealth daily by as much as he does not use of the received order, and to the same amount accumulates a monetary claim on the Government. It is, of course, always in his power, as it is his legal right, to bring forward this accumulation of claim, and at once to consume, destroy, or distribute, the sum of his wealth. Supposing he never does so, but dies, leaving his claim to others, he has enriched the State during his life by the quantity of wealth over which that claim extends, or has, in other words, rendered so much additional life possible in the State, of which additional life he bequeaths the immediate possibility to those whom he invests with his claim.
