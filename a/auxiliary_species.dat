40|$|International audienceThe advancements of {{synthetic}} biology make biochemical systems of increasing complexity realizable in living cells. Many computation and control design examples {{have been demonstrated}} either in vivo or in vitro. In principle, any polynomial ordinary differential equation can be approximated by chemical reaction networks [1]. When control systems are of concern, linear control {{is one of the}} most widely applied control methods. Any linear control system can be realized with three elementary building blocks: integration, gain, and summation. Realizing linear control with biochemical reactions has been proposed in [2], where reaction rates of the underlying reactions play a key role to achieve the desired building blocks. Essentially the reaction rates have to be matched exactly, and it imposes serious practicality restriction because in reality the reaction rates of available reactions are predetermined and can be limited. In this paper we devise a mechanism to make linear control systems configurable by adding <b>auxiliary</b> <b>species</b> as control knobs. The concentrations of the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>species</b> can be adjusted not only to compensate reaction rate mismatch, but also to reconfigure different control systems out of the same control architecture. Hence implementing linear control systems in biochemistry can be made more practical...|$|E
30|$|The {{relation}} of NPP and global diversity {{does not allow}} {{an assessment of the}} effects of a loss of species. The effect on NPP may be detrimental, if a dominant species is lost (e.g. Picea abies during forest decline by SO 2 emissions). In this case NPP may collapse despite high diversity at the pixel level. On the contrary, if an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>species</b> is lost (e.g. Ulmus ssp., by Duch elm disease) there may be no effect on NPP. Therefore, in the following we try to separately assess the NPP productivity relations for grasslands and for forests at greater detail.|$|E
40|$|In silico–designed {{nucleic acid}} probes and primers {{often do not}} achieve {{favorable}} specificity and sensitivity tradeoffs on the first try, and iterative empirical sequence-based optimization is needed, particularly in multiplexed assays. We present a novel, on-the-fly method of tuning probe affinity and selectivity by adjusting the stoichiometry of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>species,</b> which allows for independent and decoupled adjustment of the hybridization yield for different probes in multiplexed assays. Using this method, we achieved near-continuous tuning of probe effective free energy. To demonstrate our approach, we enforced uniform capture efficiency of 31 DNA molecules (GC content, 0 – 100 %), maximized the signal difference for 11 pairs of single-nucleotide variants and performed tunable hybrid capture of mRNA from total RNA. Using the Nanostring nCounter platform, we applied stoichiometric tuning to simultaneously adjust yields for a 24 -plex assay, and we show multiplexed quantitation of RNA sequences and variants from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples...|$|E

40|$|Deuterium δD isotopic {{analysis}} is increasingly {{being used to}} trace wildlife movement, and undoubtedly has much to offer in this respect but questions still remain as to the feasibility and practicality of the method in ecology. Here we report our attempt to determine the geographic origin of an auxiliary hoverfly, Episyrphus balteatus, in South-western France and a pest moth, Helicoverpa armigera in Western Africa. We used quantile regression to calculate the minimum separation distance, based on the International Atomic Energy Agency / World Meteorological Organization (IAEA / WMO) data, at which two insects {{could be said to}} originate from different latitudes with a given degree of confidence. Our results revealed greater variability of hoverfly adults δD in autumn than in spring. From this we infer an autumnal migration of the <b>auxiliary</b> hoverfly <b>species.</b> Despite the complications encountered in Europe, the minimum separation distance model proved a useful first step to get a first range of possible origins of E. balteatus and its application to other arthropod species in Europe warrants investigation. The lack of IAEA /WMO data in western Africa prevents the calculation of a minimum separation distance for the pest moth. The interpretation of water simulated δD in the study area in Western Africa and preliminary results on wild moth advocate for a restricted use of stable isotope to infer the geographical origin of the pest moth...|$|R
40|$|Biochemical {{reaction}} networks frequently {{consist of}} species evolving on multiple timescales. Stochastic simulations of such networks are often computationally challenging and therefore various {{methods have been}} developed to obtain sensible stochastic approximations on the timescale of interest. One of the rigorous and popular approaches is the multiscale approximation method for continuous time Markov processes. In this approach, by scaling species abundances and reaction rates, a family of processes parameterized by a scaling parameter is defined. The limiting process of this family is then used to approximate the original process. However, we find that such approximations become inaccurate when combinations of species with disparate abundances either constitute conservation laws or form virtual slow <b>auxiliary</b> <b>species.</b> To obtain more accurate approximation in such cases, we propose here an appropriate modification of the original method.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} use of {{renormalization}} counterterms to restore the chiral gauge symmetry in a lattice theory of Wilson fermions. We show that a large class of counterterms can be implemented automatically by making a simple modification to the fermion determinant. Some time ago we presented a lattice method for chiral gauge theories that involves the introduction of auxiliary Dirac species [1, 2]. Here we elaborate on an alternative approach [2] that achieves {{the effects of the}} <b>auxiliary</b> <b>species</b> through a direct modification of the fermion determinant. This alternative method has the advantage that the computational algorithm is simpler, involving two determinants instead of three. It also eliminates ambiguous square roots of determinants that arise in the previous method. 1. BASIC STRATEGY Our approach is similar in general philosophy to that of the Rome group [3]. However, as we shall see, it differs significantly in detail. We begin by introducing a Dirac particle via the “naive ” lattice action: SN =...|$|E
30|$|Esters {{are useful}} {{products}} {{for a variety}} of applications, including plastics, fragrances and pharmaceuticals. The least complicated and most useful of several esterification methodologies is the Fischer esterification, which requires an acid catalyst, {{and in the case of}} solid reactants often a solvent as well. Fischer esterification combines a carboxylic acid and an alcohol to produce the desired ester, and water as the only by-product. Popular catalysts are the familiar Brønsted acidic mineral acids and Lewis acidic transition metal salts, but supported catalysts (including enzymes) and recyclable heterogeneous solid acids are becoming increasing popular because of the influence of green chemistry [1, 2]. Other methods of esterification may employ nucleophilic catalysts or stoichiometric activators, and as such are harder to justify except for the most unreactive substrates. Applying the philosophy of green chemistry to esterification, the use of equimolar quantities of each reactant to give 100 % conversion, whilst minimising unnecessary VOC emissions, is desirable. Recycling of the catalyst and any solvent would then result in minimal waste. Nevertheless all <b>auxiliary</b> <b>species</b> should be sustainable, present low toxicity and health concerns, as well as effective in assisting the transformation.|$|E
40|$|DNA-based {{circuits}} {{relying on}} predictable thermodynamics and kinetics of DNA strand interactions impart flexibility in synthesizing synthetic biological constructs and in coupling these circuits to in vivo processes [1, 2, 6, 7]. Here, {{we focus on}} the synthetic Kim-Winfree oscillator network, illustrated in Fig. 1 (i), which is a simple but effective coupled oscillator system in which two DNA switches SW 1 and SW 2 are coupled through activator and inhibitor blocks realized by RNA signals and <b>auxiliary</b> DNA <b>species</b> (see [3]). A typical experimental realization is closed in the sense that once the operation starts, we do not either add any chemicals, especially NTP fuel, externally into the wet-lab apparatus or remove any chemicals, especially waste products, from the apparatus. Within the closed system, the oscillations are bound to die out sooner or later diminishing NTP fuel eventually stops supporting the production of RNA signals and accumulating waste products clog down the toeholds and, as a result, adversely affect the signal propagation. Furthermore, the oxidation effects and the pH variations tend to deactivate the enzymes. Loading poses an additional challenge since it increases the order and the uncertainty of the system indeed, these oscillators have recently been used in [8] to drive conformational changes of a DNA nanomechanical device called DNA tweezers. We show how L 1 -adaptive control can be used to mitigate these effects...|$|R
50|$|CDAs {{are used}} with NMR spectroscopic {{analysis}} to determine enantiomeric excess and the absolute configuration of a substrate. Chiral discriminating agents are sometimes {{difficult to distinguish}} from chiral solvating agents (CSA) and some agents {{can be used as}} both. The speed of the exchange between the substrate and the metal center is the most important determining factor to differentiate between the use of a compound as a CDA or CSA. Generally, a CDA has a slow exchange whereas a CSA has a fast exchange. CDAs are more widely used than CSAs to determine absolute configurations because the covalent bonding to the substrate and <b>auxiliary</b> reagent produce <b>species</b> with greater conformational rigidity which creates greater differences in the NMR spectra. CDAs and CSAs can be used together to improve chiral recognition, although this is not a common.|$|R

40|$|Cellular {{processes}} do {{not follow}} deterministic rules; even in identical environments genetically identical cells can make random choices leading to different phenotypes. This randomness originates from fluctuations present in the biomolecular interaction networks. Most previous work {{has been focused on}} the intrinsic noise (IN) of these networks. Yet, especially for high-copy-number biomolecules, extrinsic or environmental noise (EN) has been experimentally shown to dominate the variation. Here, we develop an analytical formalism that allows for calculation of the effect of EN on gene-expression motifs. We introduce a method for modeling bounded EN as an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>species</b> in the master equation. The method is fully generic and is not limited to systems with small EN magnitudes. We focus our study on motifs that can be viewed as the building blocks of genetic switches: a nonregulated gene, a self-inhibiting gene, and a self-promoting gene. The role of the EN properties (magnitude, correlation time, and distribution) on the statistics of interest are systematically investigated, and the effect of fluctuations in different reaction rates is compared. Due to its analytical nature, our formalism can be used to quantify the effect of EN on the dynamics of biochemical networks and {{can also be used to}} improve the interpretation of data from single-cell gene-expression experiments.

40|$|In {{this study}} we use an {{indirect}} method {{to address the issue}} of the systematics of the large and economically important genus Acacia (Leguminosae, Mimosoideae, Acacieae). We propose the use of host-preference data in closely related insect species as a potentially useful tool to investigate host systematic issues, especially when other approaches yield inconsistent results. We have examined the evolution of host-plant use of a highly specialized group of seed-feeders who predate Acacia - the seed-beetles (Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae, Bruchinae). First, the evolution of host-plant preferences in a large clade of Bruchidius species was investigated using molecular phylogenetics and character optimization methods. Second, the scope of our study was enlarged by critically reviewing the host-plant records of all bruchine genera associated with Acacia. Both morphological and molecular data were used to define relevant insect clades, for which comparisons of host-plant range were performed. Interestingly, the analyses of host-plant preferences from 163 seed-beetle species recovered similar patterns of host-plant associations in the distinct clades which develop within Acacia seeds. Our results clearly support the hypothesis of Acacia being a paraphyletic genus and provide useful insights with reference to the systematics of the whole subfamily as well. This study should also be of interest to those involved in the numerous biological control programs which either already use or aim to use seed-beetles as <b>auxiliary</b> <b>species</b> to limit the propagation of several invasive legume tree species...|$|E

In many of these areas degradation {{of natural resources and}} ecosystems has become a mayor problem and, in many instances, immediate action appears to be essential. Making haste slowly looks at environmental management specifically in relation to small-scale agriculture, as carried out by resource-poor farmers in marginal areas. It confronts the question of whether immediate action can achieve sustainable results, or if action based on more traditional approaches should be accepted. Derived from a two-day workshop held in November 1990 in Amsterdam, the book contains knowledge from almost 40 Dutch specialists and includes case studies from six African, Asian and South American countries. This is the second volume in the Development oriented research in agriculture series from the Royal Tropical Institute (KIT). The third volume in this series is Woody species in auxiliary roles. This book contains eight papers on the use of three leguminous perennials; Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia septum and Flemingia macrophylla, as <b>auxiliary</b> <b>species</b> in the production of water yam (Dioscorea alata). Two main functions are covered: the relative suitability of the woody legumes as live stakes to support climbing yam plants, and the various uses of the mulches in crop fertilization, weed control, soil temperature and moisture regulation.

40|$|The advancements {{in systems}} and {{synthetic}} biology have been broadening {{the range of}} realizable systems with increasing complexity both in vitro and in vivo. Systems for digital logic operations, signal processing, analog computation, program flow control, {{as well as those}} composed of different functions – for example an on-site diagnostic system based on multiple biomarker measurements and signal processing – have been realized successfully. However, the efforts to date tend to tackle each design problem separately, relying on ad hoc strategies rather than providing more general solutions based on a unified and extensible architecture, resulting in long development cycle and rigid systems that require redesign even for small specification changes. Inspired by well-tested techniques adopted in electronics design automation (EDA), this work aims to remedy current design methodology by establishing a standardized, complete flow for realizing biomolecular systems. Given a behavior specification, the flow streamlines all the steps from modeling, synthesis, simulation, to final technology mapping onto implementing chassis. The resulted biomolecular systems of our design flow are all built on top of an FPGA-like reconfigurable architecture with recurring modules. Each module is designed the function of eachmodule depends on the concentrations of assigned <b>auxiliary</b> <b>species</b> acting as the “tuning knobs. ” Reconfigurability not only simplifies redesign for altered specification or post-simulation correction, but also makes post-manufacture fine-tuning – even after system deployment – possible. This flexibility is especially important in synthetic biology due to the unavoidable variations in both the deployed biological environment and the biomolecular reactions forming the designed system. In fact, by combining the system’s reconfigurability and neural network’s self-adaptiveness through learning, we further demonstrate the high compatibility of neuromorphic computation to our proposed architecture. Simulation results verified that with each module implementing a neuron of selected model (ex. spike-based, threshold-gate-like, etc.), accompanied by an appropriate choice of reconfigurable properties (ex. threshold value, synaptic weight, etc.), the system built from our proposed flow can indeed perform desired neuromorphic functions...|$|E
