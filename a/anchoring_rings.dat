40|$|The {{response}} of a premixed laminar conical flame to a periodic perturbation {{of the flow}} was analyzed. The idea was used to imitate the acoustic flow excitation by an oscillation of the flame <b>anchoring</b> <b>ring.</b> In this case the flow field is free from the ring vortices and other coherent structure formation typical for the harmonically excited jet pattern. Under this simplified perturbation condition the flame cone kinematics is studied and compared with the flame response to acoustic flow excitation. The heat release rate response Transfer Function (TF) for a foot-perturbed flame is measured and found {{to be close to}} a theoretical TF derived {{on the basis of the}} kinematical flame tracking approach (G-equation) for a uniformly oscillating flow. However, the TF of the jet perturbed flame deviates strongly from the TF of the <b>anchoring</b> <b>ring</b> perturbed flame and demonstrates a typical 'constant time lag' behavior. A TiO 2 smoke tracing of the flow field shows the presence of a convective, sinuous perturbation of the flow core inside the flame cone when the flame is excited by the jet oscillation. In the case of the anchoring rim perturbed flame such a back influence of the perturbed flame on the upstream flow field is weak. Experiments when the flame's anchoring rim oscillates in the transverse direction indicate that the flame base in-out radial motion can be a possible cause of the convective flow perturbation origin.

40|$|Many {{cellular}} {{activities are}} driven by complex protein machines. By measuring the behaviour of fluorescent protein fusions in real time in living cells it has become apparent {{that many of these}} complexes are not fixed, but are dynamic. To some extent this might be expected, for example, for cell division complexes, as defining mid-cell is linked to growth and cell cycle, but perhaps comes as more of a surprise with a complex anchored machine like the bacterial flagellar motor. The assumption has been that once made it remains intact. However, the dynamics of this structure is strongly supported in two manuscripts in this issue of Molecular Microbiology.

40|$|Membranes can be {{described}} using a model of mathematical surfaces where the membrane's properties are characterised by the three membrane curvature elastic constants 'spontaneous curvature', 'bending rigidity' and 'saddle-splay modulus'. Experiments show that the addition of polymers can change the properties of a membrane system considerably. One example is the polymer-boosting effect which has been discovered recently for oil-water-amphiphile mixtures. The scattering data has been described successfully by the membrane model. The effect of the polymers has been taken into account by effective membrane curvature elastic constants. The concept of effective curvature elastic constants will be introduced, {{and the effects of}} different kinds of polymer additions to membrane systems discussed in the literature will be reviewed. Using the model of freely-jointed chains for the polymers, the effects of polymers anchored to membranes will be studied for several systems by means of Monte Carlo simulations. A simulation technique is described which allows to calculate the polymer effect with high accuracy in the limit of small membrane curvatures. The effects of self-avoidance and of different polymer architectures are investigated. The self-avoidance effect for linear polymer chains is found to be small. However, the simulations show that star polymers increase the efficiency of the polymer. The effects on the bending rigidity and the spontaneous curvature per arm increase with the functionality (i. e. the number of arms) of the star, whereas the effect on the saddle-splay modulus does not depend on the functionality. Scaling arguments confirm the behaviour observed in the simulations. The properties of <b>anchored</b> <b>ring</b> polymers are studied and the effects of knots are discussed. An algorithm is presented which can be employed to calculate the effect of adsorbed polymers on the curvature elastic constants in the limit of small curvatures. For linear chains in the lamellar phase, the effect of the confined geometry is investigated, again in the limit of small membrane curvatures. The simulations show that for polymers anchored to membranes, at a small lamellar spacing the effect on the membrane curvature elastic constants changes qualitatively. While for large interlayer spacings the polymer increases the bending rigidity and decreases the saddle-splay modulus, effects of opposite sign are observed for lamellar spacings smaller than the radius of gyration of the free chain. With a model for polymers anchored to a fluctuating membrane, the polymer effect is simulated for the whole fluctuation spectrum of the membrane. We obtain a universal scaling function with a maximum at large fluctuation lengths.

A Claisen condensation closed the ring to 1.8 and the intermediate enol is captured by pivaloyl chloride (piv) as a protective group. The THP group was removed with TsOH to 1.9 and the formed alcohol oxidized by Swern oxidation to aldehyde 1.10.

How the actomyosin ring {{interacts with the}} plasma membrane and the plasma membrane-localized septum synthesizing machinery remains poorly understood. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, an attractive model organism to study cytokinesis, the β- 1, 3 -glucan synthase Cps 1 p / Bgs 1 p, an integral membrane protein, localizes to the plasma membrane overlying the actomyosin ring and is required for primary septum synthesis. Through a high-dosage suppressor screen we identified an essential gene, sbg 1 + (suppressor of beta glucan synthase 1), which suppressed the colony formation defect of Bgs 1 -defective cps 1 - 191 mutant at higher temperatures. Sbg 1 p, an integral membrane protein, localizes to the cell ends and to the division site. Sbg 1 p and Bgs 1 p physically interact and are dependent on each other to localize to the division site. Loss of Sbg 1 p results in an unstable actomyosin ring that unravels and slides, leading to an inability to deposit a single contiguous division septum and an important reduction of the β- 1, 3 -glucan proportion in the cell wall, coincident with that observed in the cps 1 - 191 mutant. Sbg 1 p shows genetic and / or physical interaction with Rga 7 p, Imp 2 p, Cdc 15 p, and Pxl 1 p, proteins known to be required for actomyosin ring integrity and efficient septum synthesis.
