2500|$|From the 1940s, rumors {{circulated}} that Hoover, who {{was still}} living with his mother, was homosexual. The historians John Stuart Cox and Athan G. Theoharis speculated that Clyde Tolson, who became an {{associate director of the}} FBI and Hoover's primary heir, may have been his lover. Hoover reportedly hunted down and threatened anyone who made insinuations about his sexuality. Truman Capote, who enjoyed repeating [...] rumors about Hoover, once remarked that he was more interested in making Hoover <b>angry</b> <b>than</b> determining whether the rumors were true.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding {{his writing}} style, Abbey states: [...] "I {{write in a}} {{deliberately}} provocative and outrageous manner because I like to startle people. I hope to wake up people. I {{have no desire to}} simply soothe or please. I would rather risk making people <b>angry</b> <b>than</b> putting them to sleep. And I try to write in a style that's entertaining as well as provocative. It's hard for me to stay serious {{for more than half a}} page at a time." [...] Abbey felt that it was the duty of all authors to [...] "speak the truth--especially unpopular truth. Especially truth that offends the powerful, the rich, the well-established, the traditional, the mythic".|$|E

50|$|Their {{music can}} be {{described}} as a fusion of psychedelic rock and raw Stooges-esque rock 'n' roll—and a bit <b>angrier</b> <b>than</b> The Soundtrack of Our Lives (the band that emerged from the ashes of Union Carbide Productions).|$|R
6000|$|Then {{a lot of}} {{partridges}} got up {{and there}} was any amount of banging, though {{most of them were}} missed. This made the Red-faced Man <b>angrier</b> <b>than</b> ever. He took off his hat and waved it, bellowing-- ...|$|R

60|$|The too-ready blood sprayed her cheek, {{and this}} made her <b>angrier</b> <b>than</b> did he; for whereas {{she was sure}} of the steady grip she had on herself, her flushed face betokened a {{confusion}} which did not really possess her.|$|R
6000|$|Janet was silent, <b>angrier</b> <b>than</b> ever, {{shocked that}} tragedy, degradation, could be {{accepted}} thus circumstantially. Lise proceeded {{to put up}} her hair. She seemed to be mistress of herself; only tired, gaping frequently. Once she remarked:--"I don't see the good of getting nutty over a highball." ...|$|R
50|$|Eleusias then {{attempts}} to have Juliana burned alive in hot lead. Yet, {{even though he}} has Juliana placed in the fire, not a spot on her body or clothes is touched by the flames. <b>Angrier</b> <b>than</b> ever, Eleusias finally resolves to have Juliana beheaded, for which she becomes a Christian martyr.|$|R

60|$|And he {{went away}} to the other girls. He felt he was being <b>angrier</b> <b>than</b> he had any need to be. In fact, he doubted {{slightly}} that he was showing off. But if he were, then he would. Clara heard him laughing, {{in a way she}} hated, with the girls down the next room.|$|R
60|$|Now {{this same}} morning the Wicked Witch {{came to the}} door of her castle and looked out with her one eye that could see far off. She saw all her wolves lying dead, and the strangers still {{traveling}} through her country. This made her <b>angrier</b> <b>than</b> before, and she blew her silver whistle twice.|$|R
60|$|Disgusted {{with his}} failure, but more <b>angry</b> <b>than</b> ever, the panther lay {{down for a}} while to {{consider}} what he should do next, and as he was thinking, an old man came by.|$|E
60|$|Then {{the guards}} took the Chief Counselor, and bound him with chains to prevent his struggling, and threw him away. And the King paced {{up and down}} his cavern more <b>angry</b> <b>than</b> before.|$|E

40|$|Atheists {{are often}} {{portrayed in the}} media and {{elsewhere}} as angry individuals. Although atheists disagree with the pillar of many religions, namely the existence of a God, it may not necessarily be the case that they are angry individuals. The prevalence and accuracy of angry-atheist perceptions were examined in 7 studies with 1, 677 participants from multiple institutions and locations in the United States. Studies 1 – 3 revealed that people believe atheists are <b>angrier</b> <b>than</b> believers, people in general, and other minority groups, both explicitly and implicitly. Studies 4 – 7 then examined the accuracy of these beliefs. Belief in God, state anger, and trait anger were assessed in multiple ways and contexts. None of these studies supported the idea that atheists are particularly angry individuals. Rather, these results support the idea that people believe atheists are angry individuals, but they {{do not appear to be}} <b>angrier</b> <b>than</b> other individuals in reality...|$|R
5000|$|The man, {{scared to}} death, finds {{the courage to}} push the {{creature}} away and yell, [...] "I haven't got your taily-po!", hoping the creature will leave. However, the ravenous creature, <b>angrier</b> <b>than</b> ever, yells back: [...] "Yes, you have! Yes, you have!" [...] and jumps back on the bed, mutilates the man and destroys the cabin. In at least one version, the old man is sodomized before being eaten.|$|R

60|$|When {{his mother}} found him with traces of tears on his cheeks; {{and he was}} silent when she spoke to him, and had a strange {{look in his eyes}} as if they were gazing at some distant object, she was <b>angrier</b> <b>than</b> ever with the sea, for she knew that the thought of it had {{returned}} to him {{and that it would be}} harder than ever to keep him.|$|R
60|$|Lop-Ear was a {{year older}} than I, but I was several times <b>angrier</b> <b>than</b> he, and in the end he took to his heels. I chased him across the open and down a run-way to the river.

500|$|When a {{national}} rail strike threatened in May 1946, Truman seized the railroads.

[...] For two days public anger mounted {{and no one was}} <b>angrier</b> <b>than</b> Truman himself. He drafted a message to Congress that called on veterans to form a lynch mob and destroy the union leaders: ...|$|R
