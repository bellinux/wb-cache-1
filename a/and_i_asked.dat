5|$|Reaching the cascade, {{or rather}} cataract, the roaring {{of which had}} a long time {{announced}} its vicinity, my soul was hurried by the falls into a new train of reflections. The impetuous dashing of the rebounding torrent from the dark cavities which mocked the exploring eye, produced an equal activity in my mind: my thoughts darted from earth to heaven, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> myself why I was chained to life and its misery? Still the tumultuous emotions this sublime object excited, were pleasurable; and, viewing it, my soul rose, with renewed dignity, above its cares – grasping at immortality – it seemed as impossible to stop the current of my thoughts, as of the always varying, still the same, torrent before me – I stretched out my hand to eternity, bounding over the dark speck of life to come.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, I made {{a serious}} error in {{judgment}} and conducted {{myself in a}} way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs. I recognized my mistake and I told my wife that I had a liaison with another woman, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> for her forgiveness. Although I was honest in every painful detail with my family, I did not tell the public. When a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story, I used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it. But being 99 percent honest is no longer enough...|$|E
25|$|Both Heirens and {{his parents}} signed a confession. The parties agreed to a date of July 30 for Heirens to make his {{official}} confession. On that date the defense went to Tuohy's office, where several reporters were assembled to ask Heirens questions and where Tuohy himself made a speech. Heirens appeared bewildered and gave noncommittal answers to reporters' questions, which he years later blamed on Tuohy:It was Tuohy himself. After assembling all the officials, including attorneys and policemen, he began a preamble about how long everyone had waited to get a confession from me, but, at last, the truth {{was going to be}} told. He kept emphasizing the word 'truth' <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him if he really wanted the truth. He assured me that he did...Now Tuohy made a big deal about hearing the truth. Now, when I was being forced to lie to save myself. It made me angry...so I told them the truth, and everyone got very upset.|$|E

25|$|The last {{murder to}} involve Gravano was {{the murder of}} Louie DiBono, the made man Gravano had {{threatened}} to kill earlier. Gravano described {{the reasons for the}} murder in Underboss: He was still robbing the family <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> for permission to take him out. But John had a meeting with DiBono, and DiBono told John that he had a billion dollars of drywall work that was coming out of the World Trade Center. John bit, hook, line and sinker, and refused my request. John said he would handle DiBono personally and become his partner. But DiBono was up to his old tricks double-dealing. He had obviously been bullshitting John. So when John called Louie in for meetings to discuss their new partnership, DiBono didn't show up. John was humiliated. This meant an automatic death penalty. John gave the contract to DiBono's captain, Pat Conte. Conte botched an ideal opportunity to kill DiBono. Then, as Gotti grew increasingly impatient, Conte explained that the problem now was trying to corner DiBono again. Whenever a meeting with him was arranged, DiBono never appeared. It was a joke, what was going on. I couldn't help laughing to myself. I told John why didn't Pat simplify everything. Just call Louie up and tell him to hang himself. Ten months went by. John looks like an asshole. He was too embarrassed even to ask me for help.|$|E
500|$|In September that year, Dmowski's National Committee was {{recognized}} by the French as the legitimate government of Poland. The British and the Americans were less enthusiastic about Dmowski's National Committee, but likewise recognized it as Poland's government a year later. However, the Americans refused to provide backing for what they regarded as Dmowski's excessive territorial claims (Dmowski's Line). The American President Woodrow Wilson reported, [...] "I saw Mr. Dmowski and Mr. Paderewski in Washington, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> them to define Poland for me, as they understood it, and they presented me with a map in which they claimed {{a large part of}} the earth." ...|$|E
500|$|Similarities of The Hunger Games to Koushun Takami's 1999novel Battle Royale {{have been}} noted. Collins stated that she [...] "had {{never heard of}} that book or that author until my book was turned in. At that point, it was {{mentioned}} to me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> my editor if I should read it. He said: 'No, I don't want that world in your head. Just continue with what you're doing'." [...] Susan Dominus of The New York Times reports that [...] "the parallels are striking enough that Collins's work has been savaged on the blogosphere as a baldfaced ripoff" [...] of Battle Royale but argued that [...] "there are enough possible sources for the plot line that the two authors might well have hit on the same basic setup independently." [...] Stephen King noted that the reality TV [...] "badlands" [...] were similar to Battle Royale, {{as well as his}} own novels The Running Man and The Long Walk. Eric Eisenberg wrote that The Hunger Games was [...] "not a rip off of Battle Royale, but simply a different usage of a similar idea", pointing out various differences in both story and themes.|$|E

I am aware of it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> trust I may never repeat it. Such a mistake as that I think that I shall never commit again. But <b>I</b> did it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you to forgive me." [...] In answer to this she could only embrace him and hang upon him, and implore him in silence to spare her.

500|$|Madonna {{had already}} started work on the album with Williams, and during one of her breaks from recording, her manager Guy Oseary spoke to Timberlake, {{suggesting}} that it [...] "would be cool" [...] if he recorded some songs with her. Timberlake commented [...] "'That would be awesome,' but I thought, 'That'll never happen', [...] But it's a testament to Pharrell. He had already laid the groundwork {{where she was going}} with it. She played 'Candy Shop' for me, {{and a couple of other}} songs, and I thought, 'What a cool direction.' I thought she could essentially do the whole record with Pharrell if she wanted to, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> Tim, 'How do we fit in?' And it basically came down to how we did my record, co-producing, and just throwing Madonna in the mix." [...] The first track recorded by Madonna and Timberlake was [...] "Devil Wouldn't Recognize You". Timberlake felt that the song, which Madonna had been working on for years before the Hard Candy project, was comparable to [...] "Frozen" [...] (1998). He wanted to turn the line [...] "'The devil wouldn't recognize you, but I do" [...] into a catchy hook and make it sound like a concept.|$|E
500|$|Nino, a key villain, {{is portrayed}} by Ron Perlman, {{one of the}} last actors to join the cast. Regarding the casting of Perlman, Refn said, [...] "The {{character}} of Nino was originally not particularly interesting, so I asked Ron why he wanted to be in my movie when he's done so many great films. When Perlman said, 'I always wanted to play a Jewish man who wants to be an Italian gangster', <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> why, and he said, 'because that's what I am – a Jewish boy from New York', well, that automatically cemented it for me." [...] Oscar Isaac portrays a Latino convict named Standard, who is married to Irene and is just released from prison a week after Irene meets The Driver. He found the role to be a bit unappealing and chose to turn the archetypal character into something more. He said of the role: As soon as I sat down with Nicolas, he explained this universe and world of the story, so we made the character into someone interested in owning a restaurant, someone who made some wrong decisions in his life, ending up in a bad place. By making 'Standard' more specific and more interesting, we found that it made the story that more compelling.|$|E
500|$|... "You do {{appreciate}} {{the absurdity of}} a group of rabbis in Israel claiming that I'm being blasphemous about someone when they haven't heard the record, right? And then, everyone in the media runs with it as if it's the truth. And that's a little weird. But what's even weirder is that the song is not about Isaac Lurier, as the rabbis claim. It's named after Yitzhak Sinwani, who's singing in Yemenite on the track. I couldn't think of a title for the song. So I called it [...] "Isaac" [...] It's interesting how their minds work, those naughty rabbis.

We said, [...] "We're just going to record you. We don't know what we're going to do with it." [...] He's flawless. One take, no bad notes. He doesn't even need a microphone. We took one of the songs he did and I said to Stuart, [...] "Let's sample these bits. We'll create a chorus and then I'll write lyrics around it." [...] That's how we constructed it." ...|$|E

2500|$|At 11:40p.m., on April 14, {{one of the}} ship's lookouts rang a bell {{to signal}} that an object lay {{directly}} in the ship's path. The vessel turned to avoid a collision, but the submerged portion of an iceberg gouged its bulkhead and bilges. In the confusion that followed, Wick was last seen {{on the deck of}} the sinking ocean liner, waving to relatives as they were helped into lifeboats. Caroline Bonnell, who boarded one of the first lifeboats dispatched from the ship, told reporters what happened later: [...] "There was a big wave. The sea was calm, otherwise, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> a sailor what it was. He said, 'the Titanic has sunk!'" [...] Wick's body was never recovered.|$|E

2500|$|Corgan commented, [...] "Like a {{great artist}} can do, Shepard had summed up very simply a lot of complex themes. He also used the type font from our very first single, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him about it {{and he had no}} idea. He was just on point." [...] Fairey also remarked [...] "I use red {{frequently}} because it is a visually powerful, emotionally potent color. Red gets people's attention. In this case there is the added possibility that the red liquid could be blood, giving it an even more sinister sense of foreboding." [...] The red color of the artwork was changed for most of the special edition releases. The Best Buy reissue features a black-and-white version of the original artwork.|$|E
2500|$|Various authors give {{examples}} of instigation of whisper campaigns. Childers cites {{the fact that}} rumours were spread by the Israeli forces that they possessed the atomic bomb. Morris cites Yigal Allon, the Palmach commander, describing such a campaign: [...] "I gathered the Jewish mukhtars, who had ties with the different Arab villages, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> them to whisper in the ears of several Arabs that giant Jewish reinforcements had reached the Galilee and were about {{to clean out the}} villages of the Hula, [...] to advise them, as friends, to flee while they could. And the rumour spread throughout the Hula that {{the time had come to}} flee. The flight encompassed tens of thousands. The stratagem fully achieved its objective." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I Want to Be Your Man" [...] is a ballad {{featuring}} Roger's vocals {{filtered through}} a vocoder. According to Roger, {{he had never}} mixed his [...] "human" [...] voice with the talk box before, and recording the vocals was tedious because he could only play one note at a time on the vocoder. To layer six-part harmonies, he spoke the lyric while playing a melody line then rewound the tape and repeated the process for the harmonizing part while playing together with the previously recorded one. After he finished layering tracks, if he didn't like the result he had to scrap everything and start over. Larry Troutman recommended Nicole Cottom, {{a friend of his}} daughter, to help sing background vocals. Roger recalled her being in the studio one day while he was recording his vocals: [...] "There was a spot in the song where there was a hole <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> her to do something. It was so good, {{there was no need to}} take it out." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tubridy met his wife, the {{producer}} Anne Marie Power at RTÉ in 1997 {{when he spotted}} her in a recording studio. He later spoke of the moment they met: [...] "She was going in to make a programme, I was going out. My head turned and my life changed. I pursued her relentlessly. She used to sashay down the corridor and I was quite taken by her. She was very erudite and she made documentaries on flamenco. She was much brighter than I am and continues to be, which isn't that hard really if you dig deep enough, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> her out." [...] The couple had a daughter, Ella, and later married in 2003. Tubridy proposed in the Abbeyglen Hotel (a [...] "favourite haunt" [...] of his) in Clifden, County Galway. The engagement was announced in The Irish Times with the words [...] "Ella Tubridy is delighted to announce the engagement of her parents Ryan and Anne Marie".|$|E
2500|$|Zainab Bahrani, {{professor}} of Ancient Near Eastern Art History and Archaeology at Columbia University, {{reported that a}} helicopter landing pad was constructed {{in the heart of}} the ancient city of Babylon, and [...] "removed layers of archeological earth from the site. The daily flights of the helicopters rattle the ancient walls and the winds created by their rotors blast sand against the fragile bricks. When my colleague at the site, Maryam Moussa, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> military personnel in charge that the helipad be shut down, the response was that it had to remain open for security reasons, for the safety of the troops." [...] Bahrani also reported that in the summer of 2004, [...] "the wall of the Temple of Nabu and the roof of the Temple of Ninmah, both sixth century BC, collapsed as a result of the movement of helicopters." [...] Electrical power is scarce in post-war Iraq, Bahrani reported, and some fragile artifacts, including the Ottoman Archive, would not survive the loss of refrigeration.|$|E
2500|$|On January 20, 2012, the Wallflowers began {{recording}} their sixth studio album, Glad All Over at the Black Keys' Dan Auerbach's Easy Eye {{studio in}} Nashville. Jay Joyce, {{who had played}} guitar on the Wallflowers' Bringing Down the Horse agreed to produce the album. [...] Before going to the studio, the band had decided have a more collaborative writing process than {{they had in the}} past. [...] Instead of Dylan bringing in fully completed songs like he had done in the past, he only brought lyrics. [...] Dylan {{and the rest of the}} band wrote the music for the songs together in the studio. [...] Joyce explained: [...] "Jakob came to Nashville and we sat down <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him to play me a song, but instead he pulled out this 2-inch-thick notebook. ‘This is what I’ve got. Let’s play some grooves and throw it around.’ I thought, ‘Wow, that’s kind of scary, but it’s exciting.’ So we didn’t really know going in what we were going to do. We had no songs, no demos. It was all developed in the studio. [...] The band finished recording on February 20, 2012.|$|E
