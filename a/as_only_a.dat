5|$|Born in Rome in 1783, Pistrucci studied {{briefly with}} other artists before {{striking}} {{out on his}} own at age 15. He became prominent as a cameo carver and was patronised by royalty. In 1815, he moved to Britain, where he would live for {{most of the rest of}} his life. His talent brought him to the attention of notables including William Wellesley-Pole, the Master of the Mint. Pole engaged Pistrucci to design new coinage, including the sovereign, which was first issued in 1817 to mixed reactions. Although Pole probably promised Pistrucci the post of Chief Engraver, the position could not be awarded <b>as</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> British subject could hold it. This slight became a long-term grievance for Pistrucci.|$|E
5|$|Harold Godwinson's {{victory was}} short-lived, <b>as</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> {{few weeks later}} he was {{defeated}} by William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings. The fact that Harold {{had to make a}} forced march to fight Hardrada at Stamford Bridge and then move at utmost speed south to meet the Norman invasion, all in less than three weeks, is widely seen as a primary factor in William's victory at Hastings.|$|E
5|$|Of the season's ten {{tropical}} cyclones, six became tropical {{storms and}} four strengthened into hurricanes. Furthermore, {{none of these}} strengthened into a major hurricane—Category3 or higher on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale—marking the sixth such occurrence since 1900. The strongest hurricane of the season peaked <b>as</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> Category1 with winds of 85mph (140km/h). That system left five deaths and at least $4million in damage in North Carolina. The first hurricane of the season also caused one fatality in Texas, while damage in South Carolina from the fifth hurricane reached at least $75,000.|$|E

5|$|On 3 December 1979, a crowd crush at a Who gig at the Riverfront Coliseum, Cincinnati killed 11 fans. This {{was partly}} due to the festival seating, where the first to enter get the best positions. Some fans waiting outside mistook the band's soundcheck for the concert, and {{attempted}} to force their way inside. <b>As</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few entrance doors were opened, a bottleneck situation ensued with thousands trying to gain entry, and the crush became deadly.|$|E
5|$|The {{remnants}} of Arthur re-intensified somewhat as it traversed The Maritimes; a sting jet with gusts of 65–80mph (100–130km/h) developed along the storm's backside. The former hurricane made an additional landfall {{in the region}} near Fundy National Park by 18:00UTC. By July6, the sting jet had dissipated, and steady weakening of the cyclone resumed <b>as</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> split jet provided upper-level support to the storm. Turning back to the northeast, Arthur moved through Labrador later that day. Once over the Labrador Sea, Arthur turned northwest while weakening before doubling back to the southeast. After weakening below gale-force strength, the extratropical system dissipated late on July9.|$|E
5|$|The spores are spherical, and 3.5–4.5µm in diameter. They {{are covered}} with short narrow {{abruptly}} terminating projections of a translucent (hyaline) substance, which turn a pale cinnamon brown in potassium hydroxide, and a dark dull brown (nearly sepia) when stained with iodine. The capillitium is made of {{what appears to be}} encrusted cylindrical filaments 3–6µm in diameter, of a color varying from hyaline to dull yellowish brown in potassium hydroxide, and yellowish in iodine; its walls are thickened {{to the point where the}} interior (lumen) appears <b>as</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> line. Either two or four spores are attached to the basidia, and the sterigmata (extensions of the basidia that attach the spores) are long, up to 20µm. Geastrum triplex does not have cystidia.|$|E

50|$|Mr. Pires has {{a strong}} “After Oil” policy, {{encouraging}} his Government and people to see oil <b>as</b> <b>only</b> <b>an</b> engine of growth for the economic development and for the nation not to grow dependent on oil and for the Government {{to invest in the}} non-oil sector.|$|R
5|$|Two {{candidates}} {{stood with}} rather less support. William Ralls Morrison of Illinois {{had served in}} Congress since 1873 and was best known for advocating tariff reductions despite hailing from a protectionist district. He commanded little support outside his home state, and was seen <b>as</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> favorite son. Justice Stephen Johnson Field of the United States Supreme Court was better known, but still an unlikely victor. The only candidate from the Far West, Field was respected as a scholar of the law, but had greatly diminished his chances with {{his home state of}} California by striking down anti-Chinese legislation in that state in 1879. Even so, some observers, including Edwards Pierrepont, considered Field a likely choice for the nomination.|$|E
5|$|After {{emerging}} {{into the}} Straits of Florida on September21, the storm resumed intensification, before striking near Boca Chica Key, Florida with winds of 120mph (195km/h). By early on September22, the system peaked as a Category4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 130mph (215km/h). Shortly thereafter, another landfall occurred near Chokoloskee, Florida {{at the same}} intensity. Severe damage {{was reported in the}} state due to strong winds. The storm was considered the worst in Key West since the 1919 Florida Keys hurricane. Throughout the state, 1,200homes were severely damaged or destroyed, while 40businesses were demolished and 237suffered impact. Throughout Florida, there were three fatalities and approximately $12million (1948USD) in damage, over half of which was inflicted on crops. The storm rapidly weakened while crossing the state and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean <b>as</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> Category1 hurricane later on September22. Slight fluctuations in intensity occurred before the hurricane became extratropical early on September24, while located northwest of Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|As the protoss {{celebrate}} their victory, however, Artanis and Jim Raynor are summoned by Kerrigan to Ulnar, the former Xel'Naga homeworld, which contains a gateway into the Void; Kerrigan seeks their help in going through and ending Amon {{once and for}} all. Fighting through Amon's minions, led by a reincarnated Duran/Narud, the trio release an imprisoned Xel'Naga named Ouros, who had appeared to both Zeratul and Artanis {{in the form of}} their deceased friend Tassadar to guide them towards his intended aim: For Kerrigan to ascend to become Xel'Naga herself, and use her powers to kill Amon, <b>as</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> Xel'Naga could defeat him for good. With the aid of Artanis and Raynor's armies, Kerrigan undergoes the ascension, and destroys Amon forever with a final blast of energy.|$|E
60|$|And a fact {{which neither}} of them realized, save subconsciously, was in the background: Carl himself had come {{in a few years}} from Oscar Ericson's back yard to Ruth Winslow's library--he had made the step naturally, <b>as</b> <b>only</b> <b>an</b> American could, but it was a step.|$|R

5|$|As {{the year}} progressed, Calvin and Farel's {{reputation}} with the council began to suffer. The council {{was reluctant to}} enforce the subscription requirement, <b>as</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few citizens had subscribed to their confession of faith. On 26 November, the two ministers hotly debated the council over the issue. Furthermore, France was taking an interest in forming an alliance with Geneva and as the two ministers were Frenchmen, councillors had begun to question their loyalty. Finally, a major ecclesiastical-political quarrel developed when the city of Bern, Geneva's ally in the reformation of the Swiss churches, proposed to introduce uniformity in the church ceremonies. One proposal required the use of unleavened bread for the Eucharist. The two ministers were unwilling to follow Bern's lead and delayed {{the use of such}} bread until a synod in Zurich could be convened to make the final decision. The council ordered Calvin and Farel to use unleavened bread for the Easter Eucharist. In protest, they refused to administer communion during the Easter service. This caused a riot during the service and the next day, the council told Farel and Calvin to leave Geneva.|$|E
5|$|Due to a {{combination}} of land interaction and strong wind shear from Typhoon Ellis, Faye became less organized. At 0000UTC on August25, the JMA downgraded Faye to a severe tropical storm while the JTWC reduced it to tropical storm status. After re-emerging into open water, Faye turned northeast under the influence of Typhoon Ellis. Initially, re-intensification was expected to occur; however, the shear did not relent. Late on August26, the JMA estimated that Faye was no longer a tropical storm. By August27, Faye began to turn east despite the JTWC forecasting the storm to continue northeast and pass west of Japan. Additionally, Faye continued to weaken, and by that time, all the thunderstorm activity was displaced from the center. At 0600 UTC on August27, the JTWC discontinued warnings on the system <b>as</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few areas of thunderstorm activity remained present. Despite this, the JMA continued to track the cyclone.|$|E
5|$|Eighty {{percent of}} self-harm {{involves}} stabbing or cutting the skin {{with a sharp}} object. However, the number of self-harm methods are only limited by an individual's inventiveness and their determination to harm themselves; this includes burning, self-poisoning, alcohol abuse, self-embedding of objects, hair pulling, bruising/hitting one's self, scratching to hurt one's self, knowingly abusing over the counter or prescription drugs, and forms of self-harm related to anorexia and bulimia. The locations of self-harm are often areas {{of the body that}} are easily hidden and concealed from the detection of others. As well as defining self-harm in terms of the act of damaging the body, it may be more accurate to define self-harm in terms of the intent, and the emotional distress that the person is attempting to deal with. Neither the DSM-IV-TR nor the ICD-10 provide diagnostic criteria for self-harm. It is often seen <b>as</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> symptom of an underlying disorder, though many people who self-harm would like this to be addressed.|$|E

25|$|Other {{scholars}} such as Steven Rosen, Laurie L. Patton and Stephen Mitchell {{have seen}} in the Gita a religious defense of the warrior class's (Kshatriya Varna) duty (svadharma), which is to conduct combat and war with courage and do not see this <b>as</b> <b>only</b> <b>an</b> allegorical teaching, but also a real defense of just war.|$|R
5|$|Following Manchester United's first league {{title in}} 1908 and the FA Cup a year later, {{it was decided}} that Bank Street was too {{restrictive}} for Davies' ambition and the club would have to move to a new stadium five miles away in Old Trafford. Bank Street was sold to the Manchester Corporation for £5,500 and leased back to the club on a monthly basis until the new stadium was complete. Bank Street played host to just 5,000 spectators for its final game on 22 January 1910; a 5–0 home win over Tottenham Hotspur. Manchester United's move away from Bank Street seemed to have come at the perfect time, <b>as,</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few days after the Tottenham match, one of the stands was blown down in a storm. The roof of the grandstand was blown across the road, landing on the houses opposite, and the stand was left in tatters. The Tottenham match was meant to have been played at Old Trafford, but building problems at the new ground had caused the fixture to revert to Bank Street. Despite the destruction of the Bank Street End stand, the club's reserve team continued to use the ground for matches until the expiry of the lease on 1 January 1912. The remaining timber at the site was then sold to Keyley Bros. for £275. The site had various industrial uses for the next 80 years, until it was cleared for inclusion in the new Manchester Velodrome in the early 1990s. The actual site occupied by the stadium now serves as the Velodrome car park, while a red plaque attached to a house opposite marks the site as part of United's history.|$|E
5|$|In 1129, Emperor Gaozong {{designated}} the site at Hangzhou (known then as Lin'an) {{to be the}} temporary settlement of the court, {{but it was not}} until 1132 that it was declared the new Song capital. Hangzhou and Nanjing were devastated by the Jin raids; both cities were heavily repopulated with northern refugees who outnumbered the remaining original inhabitants. Hangzhou was chosen not only for its natural scenic beauty, but for the surrounding topographic barriers of lakes and muddy rice-fields that gave it defensive potential against northern armies comprising mostly cavalry. Yet it was viewed by the court <b>as</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> temporary capital while the Song emperors planned to retake Kaifeng. However, the rapid growth of the city from the 12th century to the 13th necessitated long-term goals of residency. In 1133 the modest palatial residence of the imperial family was improved upon from a simple provincial lodging to one that at least accommodated strolls with new covered alleyways to deflect the rain. In 1148 the walls of the small palace compound were finally extended to the southeast, yet this was another marginal improvement.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, the MacDonald Government faced {{a serious}} crisis, as the May Report {{revealed}} that the budget was unbalanced, with an expected shortfall of £120million. As this information became public, there was a run on the pound, depleting the nation's gold reserves. The Labour Party refused to consider the massive cuts in unemployment compensation which {{would be needed to}} balance the budget, and Prime Minister MacDonald sought support from outside his party. With Baldwin on holiday in France, Chamberlain negotiated for the Conservatives. Chamberlain told MacDonald that the Conservatives would only join a coalition if the full recommended cuts in unemployment compensation were made. Finally, on 24 August 1931, the Labour Government resigned and MacDonald formed a National Government, supported by most Conservative and Liberal MPs and a minority of the Labour Party. Chamberlain once more returned to the Ministry of Health. The National Government was intended <b>as</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> temporary expedient, but governed Britain until Chamberlain's fall in 1940. In the ensuing General Election, the National Government won 554 of the 615seats in the House of Commons, with 473 of its supporters Conservative MPs.|$|E

5|$|In autumn 1940, {{high-ranking}} German officials {{drafted a}} memorandum {{on the dangers}} of an invasion of the Soviet Union. They said Ukraine, Belorussia and the Baltic States would end up <b>as</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> further economic burden for Germany. It was argued that the Soviets in their current bureaucratic form were harmless and that the occupation would not benefit Germany. Hitler disagreed with economists about the risks and told his right-hand man Hermann Göring, the chief of the Luftwaffe, that he would no longer listen to misgivings about the economic dangers of a war with Russia. It is speculated that this was passed on to General Georg Thomas, who had produced reports that predicted a net economic drain for Germany {{in the event of an}} invasion of the Soviet Union unless its economy was captured intact and the Caucasus oilfields seized in the first blow, and he consequently revised his future report to fit Hitler's wishes. The Red Army's ineptitude in the Winter War against Finland in 1939–40 convinced Hitler of a quick victory within a few months. Neither Hitler nor the General Staff anticipated a long campaign lasting into the winter, and therefore adequate preparations, such as the distribution of warm clothing and winterization of vehicles and lubricants, were not made.|$|E
5|$|Jean Buridan (1300–1358) also {{rejected}} {{the notion that}} this motion-generating property, which he named impetus, dissipated spontaneously. Buridan's position was that a moving object would be arrested by {{the resistance of the}} air and the weight of the body which would oppose its impetus. He also maintained that impetus increased with speed; thus, his initial idea of impetus was similar in many ways to the modern concept of momentum. Despite the obvious similarities to more modern ideas of inertia, Buridan saw his theory <b>as</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> modification to Aristotle's basic philosophy, maintaining many other peripatetic views, including the belief that there was still a fundamental difference between an object in motion and an object at rest. Buridan also maintained that impetus could be not only linear, but also circular in nature, causing objects such as celestial bodies to move in a circle.|$|E
5|$|Land {{interaction}} during Krovanh's {{passage of}} Luzon significantly weakened the cyclone, and upon the system's reemergence into the South China Sea by 2000UTC on August22, Krovanh was classified <b>as</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> tropical storm by the JMA. Redevelopment was rather rapid following emergence, and just {{four hours later}} the storm was redesignated as a severe tropical storm. On August24, the storm began to develop tight banding and reformed its prior banding eye feature, which later organized into a well defined eye. Later that day Krovanh clipped the northeastern coast of Hainan before crossing the Leizhou Peninsula on August25. During this time, the JMA upgraded Krovanh back to typhoon intensity and indicated that the storm was reaching a secondary peak in strength. The JTWC indicated a similar development as the typhoon traversed the Gulf of Tonkin. However, according to the JMA, Krovanh waned into a severe tropical storm shortly before the storm made its final landfall on Cẩm Phả, Vietnam at approximately 1500UTC on August25. Over land, Krovanh deteriorated rapidly, and both agencies ceased monitoring the system on August26 while it was well northwest of Hanoi.|$|E
