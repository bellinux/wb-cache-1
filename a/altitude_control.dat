25|$|The {{commission}} interpreted {{several of}} these actions as taking shortcuts to avoid further delays on an already severely delayed flight. They regarded the decision to descend at 5meters per second (1,000fpm) as reasonable given the conditions. However, as the first officer focused on the nose gear issue, the aircraft actually experienced a descent of 10.0meters per second (1,960fpm) for 26 seconds, zero descent for 16 seconds and then an average descent of 8.6meters per second (1,720fpm) until impact. The first officer was distracted by the captain's dealings with the landing-gear issues, hindering him from primary task: flying the aircraft. The cycling of the landing gear and delay in extending the flaps made speed and <b>altitude</b> <b>control</b> more difficult. The captain also failed to inform the first officer when the flaps were fully extended.|$|E
25|$|There {{were two}} methods of {{piloting}} balloons: free flight or captive. Free flight {{meant that the}} balloon was able to travel in any direction or distance for as long or {{as far as the}} pilot was able to fly it. Captive flight meant that the balloon was retained by a tether or series of tethers manned by ground crews. Free flight required that the pilot ascend and return by his own control. Captive flight used ground crews to assist in <b>altitude</b> <b>control</b> and speedy return to the exact starting point. Tethers also allowed for the stringing of telegraph wires back to the ground. Information gathered from balloon observation was relayed to the ground by various means of signaling. From high altitudes the telegraph was almost always necessary. At closer altitudes a series of prepared flag signals, hand signals, or even a megaphone could be used to communicate with the ground. At night either the telegraph or lamps could be used. In the later battles of Lowe's tenure, all reports and communications were ordered to be made orally by ascending and descending with the balloon. This is notable in Lowe's Official Report II to the Secretary where his usual transcriptions of messages were lacking. Free flight would almost always require the aeronaut to return and make a report. This would be an obvious detriment to timely reporting.|$|E
60|$|Springing lightly {{from the}} ground he swarmed up the rope toward {{the bow of the}} flier. His weight drew the craft {{slightly}} lower and at the very instant that the man drew himself to the deck at the bow of the vessel, the leading banth sprang for the stern. Gahan leaped to his feet and rushed toward the great beast in the hope of dislodging it before it had succeeded in clambering aboard. At the same instant he saw that others of the banths were racing toward them with the quite evident intention of following their leader to the ship's deck. Should they reach it in any numbers he would be lost. There was but a single hope. Leaping for the <b>altitude</b> <b>control</b> Gahan pulled it wide. Simultaneously three banths leaped for the deck. The craft rose swiftly. Gahan felt the impact of a body against the keel, followed by the soft thuds of the great bodies as they struck the ground beneath. His act had not been an instant too soon. And now the leader had gained the deck and stood at the stern with glaring eyes and snarling jaws. Gahan drew his sword. The beast, possibly disconcerted by the novelty of its position, did not charge. Instead it crept slowly toward its intended prey. The craft was rising and Gahan placed a foot upon the control and stopped the ascent. He did not wish to chance rising to some higher air current that would bear him away. Already the craft was moving slowly toward the tower, carried thither by the impetus of the banth's heavy body leaping upon it from astern.|$|E

50|$|Contraves Italiana, an Italian {{subsidiary}} of the Swiss armaments company Oerlikon Contraves began development of a short-ranged (10 km) ship-based anti-ship missile system, named Nettuno in 1963. Guidance of Nettuno was by beam riding for course <b>control,</b> with <b>altitude</b> <b>controlled</b> automatically by an onboard radar altimeter, allowing the missile to carry out sea-skimming attacks. Command guidance was an alternative guidance method if jamming made the beam-riding method unusable. Contraves Italiana began work on an improved missile, Vulcano in 1965, this having the same guidance system, but with a two-stage (booster + sustainer) rocket motor to give a longer (25 km) range. Both missiles could be fired from a five-round trainable launcher.|$|R

40|$|We {{have used}} a 2 -D microphysics model to {{study the effects of}} {{atmospheric}} motions on the albedo of Titan's thick haze layer. We compare our results to the observed variations of Titan's brightness with season and latitude. We use two wind fields. The first is an analytic solution to the simplified equations of motion. The second is based on the preliminary results of a Titan GCM. Seasonally varying wind fields, of typical horizontal velocity 1 cm/ s at optical depth unity, are capable of producing the observed change in geometric albedo of about 10 % over the Titan year. Neither of the two wind fields can adequately reproduce the latitudinal distribution of the contrast seen by Voyager. At visible wavelengths, where only haze opacity is radiatively important, upwelling produces darkening by increasing the particle size at optical depth unity. This is due to the suspension of larger particles as well as the removal of smaller particles {{from the top of the}} atmosphere. From our results it can be inferred that the circulation on Titan just prior to the time of Voyager was upwelling in the northern hemisphere and downwelling in the southern hemisphere with broad regions of uniform wind separated by a sharp transition at 10 deg. S. At UV wavelengths and at 0. 89 microns the albedo is determined by the competing effects of the gas and the haze material. Gas is bright in the UV and dark at 0. 89 microns. Haze transport at high <b>altitudes</b> <b>controls</b> the UV albedo and transport at low <b>altitude</b> <b>controls</b> the 0. 89 microns albedo. Comparisons between the hemispheric contrast at UV and IR wavelengths can be diagnostic of the vertical structure of the wind field on Titan. Infrared albedo features, which are in the lower atmosphere and persist for many rotations could reflect the haze distribution set up by a seasonally varying circulation rather than surface features as assumed in some observational studies...|$|R

40|$|A manned {{real time}} {{simulation}} of a conceptual vehicle, the stratoplane, {{was developed to}} study {{the problems associated with}} the flight characteristics of a large, lightweight vehicle. Mathematical models of the aerodynamics, mass properties, and propulsion system were developed in support of the simulation and are presented. The simulation was at first conducted without control augmentation to determine the needs for a control system. The unaugmented flying qualities were dominated by lightly damped dutch roll oscillations. Constant pilot workloads were needed at high <b>altitudes.</b> <b>Control</b> augmentation was studied using basic feedbacks. For the longitudinal axis, flight path angle, and pitch rate feedback were sufficient to damp the phugoid mode and to provide good flying qualities. In the lateral directional axis, bank angle, roll rate, and yaw rate feedbacks were sufficient to provide a safe vehicle with acceptable handling qualities. Intentionally stalling the stratoplane to very high angles of attack (deep stall) was studied as a means of enable safe and rapid descent. It was concluded that the deep stall maneuver is viable for this class of vehicle...|$|R

40|$|To {{determine}} whether chronic exposure to hypoxia during adulthood produces alterations {{in the control}} of ventilation, measurements of the resting ventilatory response to hypoxia and hypercapnia, as well as ventilatory response to hypoxia during exercise, were carried out {{in a group of}} 10 long-term (3 - 39 yr) non-native residents of Leadville, Colo.

Hypoxic ventilatory drive was measured as the shape parameter A of isocapnic ˙VE-PAo 2 curves. In the non-native high altitude resident this parameter averaged 43 % of the value for low <b>altitude</b> <b>controls</b> (P< 0. 05) denoting a diminished ventilatory response to hypoxia. The degree of attenuation was related to the length of time spent at high altitude. In the high altitude natives the parameter A averaged 9. 6 % of control (P< 0. 01). Similarly hypercapnic ventilatory drive as measured by the slope of the isoxic ˙VE-PAco 2 lines was reduced in the non-native residents to 65 % of control (P< 0. 05) and in the natives averaged 54 % of control (P< 0. 01) ...|$|R
