25|$|One of the {{greatest}} challenges to mankind <b>always</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> eradicating the presence of debilitating disease. Until just thirty years ago poliomyelitis occurred in the United States and throughout the world in epidemic proportions, striking tens of thousands and killing thousands in our own country each year. Dr. Jonas E. Salk changed all that. This year we observe the 30th anniversary of the licensing and manufacturing of the vaccine discovered by this great American. Even before another successful vaccine was discovered, Dr. Salk's discovery had reduced polio and its effects by 97 percent. Today, polio is not a familiar disease to younger Americans, and many have difficulty appreciating the magnitude of the disorder that the Salk vaccine virtually wiped {{from the face of the}} Earth.|$|E

In the 20th century, the climate and flora began to attract many foreigners as well. Population {{increase}} in this urban area began in 1940, but the metro area was not created, nor recognized, until the 1960s. From this time the population and {{the extension of the}} metropolitan area has grown. From 1960 to 1980, the population had grown from 85,620 to 368,166. From the 1980s to the present, the municipalities of Emiliano Zapata, Jiutepec, Temixco, Tepoztlán, Xochitepec, and Yautepec {{have been added to the}} metropolitan area. These municipalities have seen the highest rates of growth, however, population and economic activity remains concentrated in the city of Cuernavaca proper. , the metropolitan area had a population of 802,371, with 349,102, living in the city proper.|$|E
25|$|By the {{government}} decree of July 1998 the polytechnics started {{to offer a}} two-stage curriculum (the first three years conferring a bacharelato degree, the following two years a licenciatura bietápica degree); both are undergraduate degrees, but the universities were offering a single licentiate degree (licenciatura) of four to five years. This was changed with the Bologna process with {{a new system of}} three years for a bachelor's degree (licenciatura). Two additional years grant a master's degree (mestrado) which is conferred by the polytechnic institute under protocols with a partner university or alone when the polytechnic institution is in full compliance with the necessary requirements (proper research activity, doctoral teaching staff, and budget). The doctoral degree (doutoramento) is conferred only by the universities, as it <b>always</b> <b>has</b> <b>been.</b> By the time of the implementation of the Bologna Process (2006) in Portuguese higher education, 9.5% of the state-run polytechnic teaching staff had a doctorate degree in 2005 - 15% in 2007 after the Bologna Process.|$|E

According to Coleman regarding Clara's bond with The Doctor inquring if she had feelings for him she stated “She’s totally in love with him, <b>always</b> <b>has</b> <b>been.</b> It’s its own kind of love. He is her hero but she would be very reluctant to tell him that. It’s a doctor-and-companion love, and there’s nothing else like it really.” “They’re kind of freed of their issues and in a wonderful place together. Previously {{she was trying to}} keep him under control yet now the two of them are going ‘Come on, lets jump, lets do it’, egging each other on really, and being more and more reckless,” she teased. Capaldi stated “It’s sort of an utterly platonic bond, which is quite unusual. The problem is the Doctor knows a lot more than he ever says. He knows Clara’s fate. He knows the fate of all his companions before they do.” Ultimately it has been confirmed by both Capaldi and Coleman that the Doctor and Clara's relationship is romantic in nature.|$|E

500|$|Sorkin's nearly decade-long {{collaboration}} in television with director Thomas Schlamme began in early 1998 {{when they found}} they shared common creative ground on the soon to be produced Sports Night.

Schlamme will create the look of the shows, work with the other directors, discuss the scripts with Sorkin as soon as they are turned in, make design and casting decisions, and attend the budget meetings; Sorkin tends to stick strictly to writing.
