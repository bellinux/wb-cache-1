[...] Knockdown of KIF23 by antisense oligonucleotides and by siRNA both cause a significant increase in <b>axon</b> <b>length</b> and a decrease in dendritic phenotype in neuroblastoma cells and in rat neurons. [...] In differentiating neurons, KIF23 restricts the movement of short microtubules into axons by acting as a [...] "brake" [...] against the driving forces of cytoplasmic dynein. As neurons mature, KIF23 drives minus-end distal microtubules into nascent dendrites contributing to the multi-polar orientation of dendritic microtubules and the formation of their short, fat, tapering morphology.|$|E
50|$|Neurogenetics is a {{field that}} is rapidly {{expanding}} and growing. The current areas of research are very diverse in their focuses. One area deals with molecular processes and the function of certain proteins, often in conjunction with cell signaling and neurotransmitter release, cell development and repair, or neuronal plasticity. Behavioral and cognitive areas of research continue to expand {{in an effort to}} pinpoint contributing genetic factors. As a result of the expanding neorogenetics field a better understanding of specific neurological disorders and phenotypes has arisen with direct correlation to genetic mutations. With severe disorders such as epilepsy, brain malformations, or mental retardation a single gene or causative condition has been identified 60% of the time; however, the milder the intellectual handicap the lower chance a specific genetic cause has been pinpointed. Autism for example is only linked to a specific, mutated gene about 15-20% of the time while the mildest forms of mental handicaps are only being accounted for genetically less than 5% of the time. Research in neurogenetics has yielded some promising results, though, in that mutations at specific gene loci have been linked to harmful phenotypes and their resulting disorders. For instance a frameshift mutation or a missense mutation at the DCX gene location causes a neuronal migration defect also known as lissencephaly. Another example is the ROBO3 gene where a mutation alters <b>axon</b> <b>length</b> negatively impacting neuronal connections. Horizontal gaze palsy with progressive scoliosis (HGPPS) accompanies a mutation here. These are just a few examples of what current research in the field of neurogenetics has achieved.|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{binaural}} perception requires detailed {{analyses of}} the neural circuitry responsible for the computation of interaural time differences (ITDs). In the avian brainstem, this circuit consists of internal axonal delay lines innervating an array of coincidence detector neurons that encode external ITDs. Nucleus magnocellularis (NM) neurons project to the dorsal dendritic field of the ipsilateral nucleus laminaris (NL) and to the ventral field of the contralateral NL. Contralateral-projecting axons form a delay line system along a band of NL neurons. Binaural acoustic signals {{in the form of}} phase-locked action potentials from NM cells arrive at NL and establish a topographic map of sound source location along the azimuth. These pathways are assumed to represent a circuit similar to the Jeffress model of sound localization, establishing a place code along an isofrequency contour of NL. Three-dimensional measurements of <b>axon</b> <b>lengths</b> reveal major discrepancies with the current model; the temporal offset based on conduction length alone makes encoding of physiological ITDs impossible. However, axon diameter and distances between Nodes of Ranvier also influence signal propagation times along an axon. Our measurements of these parameters reveal that diameter and internode distance can compensate for the temporal offset inferred from <b>axon</b> <b>lengths</b> alone. Together with other recent studies, these unexpected results should inspire new thinking on the cellular biology, evolution, and plasticity of the circuitry underlying low-frequency sound localization in both birds and mammals...|$|R

To study this co-ordination we used a 3. 5  mm long population model of the young tadpole CPG with continuous distributions of neurons and <b>axon</b> <b>lengths</b> as estimated anatomically. We found that: (1) alternating swimming-type activity fails to self-sustain unless some excitatory interneurons have ascending axons, (2) a rostro-caudal (R-C) gradient {{in the distribution of}} excitatory premotor interneurons with short axons is required to obtain the R-C gradient in excitation and resulting progression of motoneuron firing necessary for forward swimming, (3) R-C delays in motoneuron firing decrease if excitatory motoneuron to premotor interneuron synapses are present, (4) these feedback connections and the electrical synapses between motoneurons synchronise motoneuron discharges locally, (5) the above findings are independent of the detailed membrane properties of neurons...|$|R

The role of metabolites derived from docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22 : 6 n- 3) that is specifically enriched in the brain, has not been addressed in axon development. In this study, we tested if synaptamide (N-docosahexaenoylethanolamine), an endogenous metabolite of DHA, affects axon growth in cultured cortical neurons. We found that synaptamide increased the average <b>axon</b> <b>length,</b> inhibited GLI family zinc finger 1 (GLI 1) transcription and sonic hedgehog (Shh) target gene expression while inducing cAMP elevation. Similar effects were produced by cyclopamine, a regulator of the Shh pathway. Conversely, Shh antagonized elevation of cAMP and blocked synaptamide-mediated increase in <b>axon</b> <b>length.</b> Activation of Shh pathway by a smoothened (SMO) agonist (SAG) or overexpression of SMO did not inhibit axon growth mediated by synaptamide or cyclopamine. Instead, adenylate cyclase inhibitor SQ 22536 abolished synaptamide-mediated axon growth indicating requirement of cAMP elevation for this process. Our findings establish that synaptamide promotes axon growth while Shh antagonizes synaptamide-mediated cAMP elevation and axon growth by a SMO-independent, non-canonical pathway...|$|E

Here we study the retinal neuronal RGC- 5 cell line after laser transection, demonstrating that the ability of these cells to initiate a regenerative response correlates with <b>axon</b> <b>length</b> and cell motility after injury. We show that low energy picosecond laser pulses can achieve transection of unlabeled single axons in vitro and precisely induce damage with micron precision. We established the conditions to achieve axon transection, and characterized RGC- 5 axon regeneration and cell body response using time-lapse microscopy. We developed an algorithm to analyze cell trajectories and established correlations between cell motility after injury, <b>axon</b> <b>length,</b> and the initiation of the regeneration response. The characterization of the motile response of axotomized RGC- 5 cells showed that cells that were capable of repair or regrowth of damaged axons migrated more slowly than cells that could not. Moreover, we established that RGC- 5 cells with long axons could not recover their injured axons, and such cells were much more motile. The platform we describe allow...|$|E
40|$|Corticospinal neurons were {{identified}} in primary cultures of cortical neurons established from rats that had been injected with a fluorescent tracer to retrogradely label the corticospinal tract. We measured neurite outgrowth from corticospinal neurons after they had been co-cultured with astrocytes derived from either the cerebral cortex (homotopic region) or spinal cord (target region) of postnatal rats. The <b>axon</b> <b>length</b> of corticospinal neurons was increased when they were cultured on astroglial monolayers compared to a control monolayer (fibroblasts). However, no difference in <b>axon</b> <b>length</b> was noted on cortical versus spinal cord-derived astrocytes. On the other hand, total dendritic length was increased on cortical compared to spinal cord astrocytes. This increase in total dendrite length was {{not the result of}} differences in the length of primary dendrites, but primarily of a higher number of dendrites and increased branching on the cortical astroglia. If the corticospinal neurons were co-cultured without physical contact with the astrocytes, axonal and dendritic outgrowth were not stimulated when compared to the fibroblast control. The data indicate that dendritic growth from corticospinal neurons is preferentially promoted by astrocytes from the cerebral cortex, whereas axonal growth is not influenced by the anatomical origin of the astrocytes. The impact of these findings on our understanding of the role of astrocytes in the development and regeneration of the corticospinal tract is discussed...|$|E
5000|$|In vertebrates, inter-aural time {{differences}} {{are known to}} be calculated in the superior olivary nucleus of the brainstem. According to Jeffress, this calculation relies on delay lines: neurons in the superior olive which accept innervation from each ear with different connecting <b>axon</b> <b>lengths.</b> Some cells are more directly connected to one ear than the other, thus they are specific for a particular inter-aural time difference. This theory is equivalent to the mathematical procedure of cross-correlation. However, because Jeffress' theory is unable to account for the precedence effect, in which only the first of multiple identical sounds is used to determine the sounds' location (thus avoiding confusion caused by echoes), it cannot be entirely used to explain the response.

40|$|SummaryAxon {{extension}} at {{the growing}} tip requires elevated local protein supply, with a capability sustainable over long axons in varying environments. The exact mechanisms, however, remain elusive. Here {{we report that}} axon-promoting factors elicited a retrograde transport-dependent removal of proteasomes from nascent axon terminals, thereby increasing protein stability at axon tips. Such an effect occurred through phosphorylation of a dynein-interacting proteasome adaptor protein Ecm 29. During the transition from immature neurites to nascent axons in cultured hippocampal neurons, live-cell imaging revealed a significant increase of the retrograde axonal transport of fluorescently labeled 20 S proteasomes. This retrograde proteasome transport depended on neuron stage and increased with <b>axon</b> <b>lengths.</b> Blockade of retrograde transport caused accumulation of proteasomes, reduction of axon growth, and attenuation of growth-associated Par 6 at the axon tip of newly polarized neurons.

40|$|The role of posttranslational {{modifications}} in axonal injury and regeneration {{has been widely}} studied {{but there has been}} little consensus over the mechanism by which each modification affects adult axonal growth. Acetylation is known {{to play an important role}} in a variety of neuronal functions and its homeostasis is controlled by two enzyme families: the Histone Deacetylases (HDACs) and Histone Acetyl Transferases (HATs). Recent studies show that HDAC 5 deacetylates microtubules in the axonal cytoplasm as part of an injury-induced regeneration response, but little is known about how acetylation of microtubules plays a role. Alpha-tubulin acetyl transferase (αTAT 1) is a microtubule specific acetyl transferase that binds to microtubules and directly affects microtubule stability in cells. We hypothesize that increasing tubulin acetylation may play an important role in increasing the rate of axonal growth. In this study, we infected cultured adult DRG neurons with αTAT 1 and αTAT 1 -D 157 N, a catalytically inactive mutant, and HDAC 5, using lentiviruses. We found that αTAT 1 significantly increases tubulin acetylation in 293 T cells and DRG neurons but αTAT 1 -D 157 N does not. Furthermore, in neurons infected with αTAT 1, a significant increase in acetylated tubulin was detected towards the distal portion of the axon but this increase was not detected in neurons infected with αTAT 1 -D 157 N. However, we found a significant increase in <b>axon</b> <b>lengths</b> of DRG neurons after αTAT 1 and αTAT 1 -D 157 N infection, but no effect on <b>axon</b> <b>lengths</b> after infection with HDAC 5. Our results suggest that while αTAT 1 may play a role in axon growth in vitro, the increase is not directly due to acetylation of axonal microtubules. Our results also show that HDAC 5 overexpression in the axonal cytoplasm does not play a crucial role in axonal regeneration of cultured DRG neurons. We expressed these genes in DRG neurons in adult rats and performed a sciatic nerve crush. We found that axons did not regenerate any better when infected with any of the constructs compared with control animals. Thus, while αTAT 1 may be important for axonal growth in vitro, neither αTAT 1 nor HDAC 5 had an effect in vivo on the regeneration of sciatic nerves...|$|R
40|$|The calcium {{current of}} a ‘giant’ {{synaptic}} terminal (the calyx of Held) was studied using two-electrode voltage clamp in slices {{of the rat}} brainstem. In terminals with a long <b>axon</b> (<b>length</b> > 100 μm), the passive current transient decayed bi-exponentially following voltage steps. In terminals with a short <b>axon</b> (<b>length</b> < 30 μm), the slow component was reduced or absent. These terminals also had small slow calcium tail currents following long depolarizing voltage steps, suggesting that these are largely due to axonal calcium channels. Terminals were voltage clamped with action potential waveform commands. At both 24 and 36 °C the calcium current began shortly after {{the peak of the}} action potential and ended before the terminal was fully repolarized. The calcium current during the repolarization phase was 69 ± 1 % (n = 3) of maximal, judged from the increase in this current when a plateau phase was added to the action potential waveform. A Hodgkin-Huxley m 2 model, based on the measured activation and deactivation of the calcium current, reproduced both the time course and the amplitude increase of the calcium currents during the different action potential waveforms well. The fast gating of the calcium channels in the terminal ensures that they are effectively opened during the repolarization phase of an action potential. This implies that the distance between open calcium channels is minimized, which is in agreement with the view that multiple calcium channels are needed to release a vesicle in this synapse...|$|E

We discovered that unaffected SMN 1 -deleted females exhibit significantly higher expression of plastin 3 (PLS 3) than their SMA-affected counterparts. We demonstrated that PLS 3 is important for axonogenesis through increasing the F-actin level. Overexpression of PLS 3 rescued the <b>axon</b> <b>length</b> and outgrowth defects associated with SMN down-regulation in motor neurons of SMA mouse embryos and in zebrafish.

We address a long-standing ambition of neuroscience to understand the structure–function problem by modeling the complete spinal cord connectome map in the 2 -day old hatchling Xenopus tadpole. Our approach to modeling neuronal connectivity is based on developmental processes of axon growth. A simple mathematical model of axon growth allows us to reconstruct a biologically realistic connectome of the tadpole spinal cord based on neurobiological data. In our model we distribute neuron cell bodies and dendrites {{on both sides of}} the body based on experimental measurements. If growing axons cross the dendrite of another neuron, they make a synaptic contact with a defined probability. The total neuronal network contains ∼ 1, 500 neurons of six cell-types with a total of ∼ 120, 000 connections. The anatomical model contains random components so each repetition of the connectome reconstruction procedure generates a different neuronal network, though all share consistent features such as distributions of cell bodies, dendrites, and <b>axon</b> <b>lengths.</b> Our study reveals a complex structure for the connectome with many interesting specific features including contrasting distributions of connection length distributions.

40|$|The {{hereditary}} spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are a {{group of}} inherited neurological disorders that are characterized by spastic lower extremity weakness due to a retrograde degradation of corticospinal motor neurons. SPG 3 A, the gene locus coding for atlastin-l, {{is the most common}} cause of early onset HSP. Atlastin-l is a dynamin-like GTPase with a role in formation of the ER network. Implementing knock-down of atlastin-l expression in neurons using interfering RNA reduces the number of neuronal processes and impairs axon formation and elongation during development. Several point mutations found in patients, such as K 80 A, impair GTPase activity of atlastin- 1. In this experiment, I sought to determine if the GTPase activity of atlastin-l is specifically necessary for normal axon growth, in contrast to the whole protein interaction. A knock-in model of the point mutation was created and propogated. It was found that in cultured cortical knock-in neurons when atlastin-l GTPase was limited, the <b>axon</b> <b>lengths</b> ofthe cells were significantly shorter when compared with those in wild-type neurons early in neuronal development. Therefore, the lack of normal axon growth in SPG 3 A may contribute to its basis of early onset, and may result from a limited GTPase function...|$|R

As {{an increasing number of}} fluorescent transgenic zebrafish lines with specific fluorescent protein expression specifically expressed in different organs and tissues, we envision that the fluorescent markers may provide more sensitive endpoints for monitoring chemical induced phenotypical changes. Here we employed Tg(nkx 2. 2 a:mEGFP) transgenic zebrafish which have GFP expression in the central nervous system to investigate its potential for screening neurotoxic chemicals. Five potential neurotoxins (acetaminophen, atenolol, atrazine, ethanol and lindane) and one neuroprotectant (mefenamic acid) were tested. We found that the GFP-labeled ventral axons from trunk motoneurons, which were easily observed in live fry and measured for quantification, were a highly sensitive to all of the five neurotoxins and the <b>length</b> of <b>axons</b> was significantly reduced in fry which looked normal based on DarT endpoints at low concentrations of neurotoxins. Compared to the most sensitive endpoints of DarT, ventral axon marker could improve the detection limit of these neurotoxins by about 10 fold.

Here, we show that motor-dependent mRNA localization regulates neuronal growth and cycling cell size. We found that the RNA-binding protein nucleolin is associated with importin β 1 mRNA in axons. Perturbation of nucleolin association with kinesins reduces its levels in axons, with a concomitant reduction in axonal importin β 1 mRNA and protein levels. Strikingly, subcellular sequestration of nucleolin or importin β 1 enhances axonal growth and causes a subcellular shift in protein synthesis. Similar findings were obtained in fibroblasts.

Consistent with these results, expression of Cre recombinase in sensory neurons from numb conditional mutants results in reduced endocytosis, {{a significant increase}} in nuclear Notch 1, and severe reductions in axon branch points and total <b>axon</b> <b>length.</b> Conversely, overexpression of Numb, but not mutant Numb lacking α-adaptin-interacting domain, leads to accumulation of Notch 1 in markedly enlarged endocytic–lysosomal vesicles, reduced nuclear Notch 1, and dramatic increases in axonal length and branch points.

I studied journal articles on the current treatments available for ASD, the increasing prevalence of the disease, the cognitive alterations of the autistic brain relative to the brains of individuals without the disease, the release of growth factors due to aerobic exercise, and the benefits of brain derived neurotic factors (BDNF) on the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. I identified that aerobic exercise stimulates the release of growth factors such as BDNF, which target primarily the cerebral cortex and the hippocampal regions of the brain essential for learning and memory processes along with synaptic plasticity. Since adolescents with ASD have a higher risk for obesity and overall tend to have thinner myelin sheaths and shorter <b>axon</b> <b>lengths,</b> aerobic exercise as a physical component and the protein growth factors that are produced as a result of aerobic exercise as a chemical component will prove to be a possible treatment option for ASD.

40|$|Early brain {{connectivity}} development {{consists of}} multiple stages: birth of neurons, their migration {{and the subsequent}} growth of axons and dendrites. Each stage occurs within {{a certain period of}} time depending on types of neurons and cortical layers. Forming synapses between neurons either by growing axons starting at similar times for all neurons (much-overlapped time windows) or at different time points (less-overlapped) may affect the topological and spatial properties of neuronal networks. Here, we explore the extreme cases of axon formation especially concerning short-distance connectivity during early development, either starting at the same time for all neurons (parallel, i. e. maximally-overlapped time windows) or occurring for each neuron separately one neuron after another (serial, i. e. no overlaps in time windows). For both cases, the number of potential and established synapses remained comparable. Topological and spatial properties, however, differed: neurons that started axon growth early on in serial growth achieved higher out-degrees, higher local efficiency, and longer <b>axon</b> <b>lengths</b> while neurons demonstrated more homogeneous connectivity patterns for parallel growth. Second, connection probability decreased more rapidly with distance between neurons for parallel growth than for serial growth. Third, bidirectional connections were more numerous for parallel growth. Finally, we tested our predictions with C. elegans data. Together, this indicates that time windows for axon growth influence the topological and spatial properties of neuronal networks opening the possibility to a posteriori estimate developmental mechanisms based on network properties of a developed network.

In Alzheimer's disease, heparan sulphates accumulate at the intracellular level in disease neurons where they co-localize with the neurofibrillary pathology, while they persist at the neuronal cell membrane in normal brain. However, it is unknown whether HS 3 ST 2 and its 3 -O-sulphated heparan sulphate products {{are involved in the}} mechanisms leading to the abnormal phosphorylation of tau in Alzheimer's disease and related tauopathies. Here, we first measured the transcript levels of all human heparan sulphate sulphotransferases in hippocampus of Alzheimer's disease (n = 8; 76. 8 +/- 3. 5 years old) and found increased expression of HS 3 ST 2 (P < 0. 001) compared with control brain (n = 8; 67. 8 +/- 2. 9 years old). Then, to investigate whether the membrane-associated 3 -O-sulphated heparan sulphates translocate to the intracellular level under pathological conditions, we used two cell models of tauopathy in neuro-differentiated SH-SY 5 Y cells: a tau mutation-dependent model in cells expressing human tau carrying the P 301 L mutation hTau(P 301 L), and a tau mutation-independent model in where tau hyperphosphorylation is induced by oxidative stress. Confocal microscopy, fluorescence resonance energy transfer, and western blot analyses showed that 3 -O-sulphated heparan sulphates can be internalized into cells where they interact with tau, promoting its abnormal phosphorylation, but not that of p 38 or NF-kappaB p 65. We showed, in vitro, that the 3 -O-sulphated heparan sulphates bind to tau, but not to GSK 3 B, protein kinase A or protein phosphatase 2, inducing its abnormal phosphorylation. Finally, we demonstrated in a zebrafish model of tauopathy expressing the hTau(P 301 L), that inhibiting hs 3 st 2 ({{also known as}} 3 ost 2) expression results in a strong inhibition of the abnormally phosphorylated tau epitopes in brain and in spinal cord, leading to a complete recovery of motor neuronal <b>axons</b> <b>length</b> (n = 25; P < 0. 005) and of the animal motor response to touching stimuli (n = 150; P < 0. 005). Our findings indicate that HS 3 ST 2 centrally participates to the molecular mechanisms leading the abnormal phosphorylation of tau. By interacting with tau at the intracellular level, the 3 -O-sulphated heparan sulphates produced by HS 3 ST 2 might act as molecular chaperones allowing the abnormal phosphorylation of tau. We propose HS 3 ST 2 as a novel therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease...|$|R

MicroRNAs are non-protein coding small RNA molecules, ~ 20 nt in length, that have been shown to control many basic cellular processes by post-transcriptional regulation. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify the effect of miR- 34 c on regenerating axons of DRG neurons. 9 to 12 week CD- 1 male mice used for this study were subjected to sciatic nerve crush lesion. Five days after surgery, animals were sacrificed, and DRGs were dissected and dissociated physically and enzymatically. DRG neurons were then grouped as follows: 1) non-transfected, 2) miR- 34 c mimic, 3) miR- 34 c inhibitor, 4) mimic negative control, and 5) inhibitor negative control. Cells were grown for 48 hours on glass cover slips, fixed, and incubated with primary beta-tubulin III antibody and with secondary antibody conjugated with a fluorophore. Cells were viewed on an inverted fluorescent microscope, and images were captured using a digital camera. <b>Axon</b> <b>length</b> and branches were measured using ImageJ. Inhibition of miR- 34 c showed a 27 % increase in <b>axon</b> <b>length</b> for naive cultures (p< 0. 05), and a 23 % increase in regenerating cultures (p< 0. 05), when compared to the inhibitor negative control.

In conclusion, miR- 34 c inhibitor promoted axon growth in regenerating cultures resulting in longer axons and increased NAV 1 expression.

Banker. 1987. Nature (Lond.). 330 : 254 - 256). To investigate this phenomenon more systematically, we transected <b>axons</b> at varying <b>lengths.</b> The greater {{the distance of the}} transection from the soma, the greater the probability for regrowth of the original axon. However, it was not the absolute length of the axonal stump that determined the response to transection, but rather its length relative to the lengths of the cell's other processes. If one process was> 10 #m longe...|$|R
40|$|Cortices {{of animals}} in 3 groups were denervated by {{undercutting}} at 4 or 40 days of age or at adulthood. Months later electrocortical seizures were studied in terminal experiments and cortical tissues prepared for light microscopic study. Four measures, assumed to be descriptive of or related to axon collateral proliferation, were made: number of <b>axon</b> collaterals, <b>length</b> of collaterals, number of collateral branches and number of apical dendritic spines. Data from adult intact cortex served as controls. Increases in number of collaterals and collateral length were observed, the best evidence being in the 40 -day animals. However, since collateral branching decreased, the data {{do not support the}} concept of proliferation as described in young brains. If dendritic spines are valid indicators of synaptic contacts then the observed significant loss of spines argues against the maintenance of functional connections, if indeed they were established, following denervation at any age. There were no obvious relationships between morphological changes and duration of afterdischarges. A persistent alteration was frequently seen in cortex which had been undercut at 4 days of age. Lower lying pyramidal cell axons bifurcated with nonrecurrent spread parallel to the glia infiltrated site of the old fiber paths. This glial barrier appeared to have prevented centripetal axon growth...|$|R
40|$|We {{suggest that}} the {{propagation}} of the action potential is driven by a pressure pulse propagating in the axoplasm along the <b>axon</b> <b>length.</b> The pressure pulse mechanically activates Na ion channels embedded in the axon membrane. This activation initiates {{the development of a}} local membrane voltage spike, as in the Hodgkin-Huxley model of the action potential. Extracellular Ca ions influxing during the voltage spike trigger a mechanism that amplifies the pressure pulse and therefore prevents its viscous decay. The model is able to explain a number of phenomena that are unexplained within the Hodgkin-Huxley framework: the Meyer-Overton rule for the effectiveness of anesthetics, as well as various mechanical, optical and thermodynamic phenomena accompanying the action potential. The model correctly predicts the velocity of propagation of the nerve impulse, including its dependence on axon diameter, degree of myelination and temperature. Comment: 9 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe brain's {{capacity}} to rewire {{is thought to}} diminish with age. It is widely believed that development stabilizes the synapses from thalamus to cortex and that adult experience alters only synaptic connections between cortical neurons. Here we show that thalamocortical (TC) inputs themselves undergo massive plasticity in adults. We combined whole-cell recording from individual thalamocortical neurons in adult rats with a recently developed automatic tracing technique to reconstruct individual axonal trees. Whisker trimming substantially reduced thalamocortical <b>axon</b> <b>length</b> in barrel cortex but not the density of TC synapses along a fiber. Thus, sensory experience alters {{the total number of}} TC synapses. After trimming, sensory stimulation evoked more tightly time-locked responses among thalamorecipient layer 4 cortical neurons. These findings indicate that thalamocortical input itself remains plastic in adulthood, raising the possibility that the axons of other subcortical structures might also remain in flux throughout life...|$|E
40|$|SummarySpinal {{muscular atrophy}} with {{respiratory}} distress type 1 (SMARD 1) is a {{motor neuron disease}} caused by mutations in the IGHMBP 2 gene, without a cure. Here, we demonstrate that neural stem cells (NSCs) from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have therapeutic potential {{in the context of}} SMARD 1. We show that upon transplantation NSCs can appropriately engraft and differentiate in the spinal cord of SMARD 1 animals, ameliorating their phenotype, by protecting their endogenous motor neurons. To evaluate the effect of NSCs in the context of human disease, we generated human SMARD 1 -iPSCs motor neurons that had a significantly reduced survival and <b>axon</b> <b>length.</b> Notably, the coculture with NSCs ameliorate these disease features, an effect attributable to the production of neurotrophic factors and their dual inhibition of GSK- 3 and HGK kinases. Our data support the role of iPSC as SMARD 1 disease model and their translational potential for therapies in motor neuron disorders...|$|E
5000|$|Slit2 and Slit1 {{have been}} shown to {{function}} as potential positive regulators of axon collateral formation during establishment or remodeling of neural circuits. In fact Slit2-N, an N-terminal fragment of Slit2, has been shown to induce Dorsal Root Ganglion (DRG) elongation and branching, whereas full length Slit2 antagonizes this effect. [...] In central trigeminal sensory <b>axons,</b> however, full <b>length</b> Slit2, through interactions with semaphorin receptor plexin-A4 regulates axonal branching. [...] It should be noted that interactions between Slit and Robo in this process are unclear, but DRG express Robo2 and trigeminal axons express Robo1-2. [...] Slit-Robo interactions are highly implicated, however, in the dendritic development of cortical neurons in that exposure to Slit1 leads to increased dendritic outgrowth and branching while inhibition of Slit-robo interactions attenuates dendritic branching.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The ventral {{photoreceptor}} {{cells of}} Limulus polyphernus resemble the retinular {{cells of the}} lateral eyes both in electrical behavior and in morphology. Because of the great size of the ventral photoreceptor cells {{they are easy to}} impale with glass capillary micropipettes. Their location {{along the length of the}} ventral eye nerve makes them easy to dissect out and fix for electron microscopy. Each cell has a large, ellipsoidal soma that tapers into an <b>axon</b> whose <b>length</b> depends upon the distance of the cell from the brain. The cell body contains a rich variety of cytoplasmic organelles with an especially abundant endoplasmic reticulum. The most prominent structural feature is the microvillous rhabdomere, a highly modified infolding of the plasmalemma. The microvilli are tightly packed together within the rhabdomere, and quintuple-layered junctions are encountered wherever microvillar mernbranes touch each other. Glial cells cover the surface of the photoreceptor cell and send long, sheet-like projections of their cytoplasm into the cell body of the photoreceptor cell. Some of these projections penetrate the rhabdomere deep within the cell and form quintuple-layered junctions with the microvilli. Junctions between glial cells and the photoreceptor cell and between adjacent glial cells are rarely encountered elsewhere, indicating that there is an open pathway between the intermicrovillous space and the extracellular medium. The axon has a normal morphology but it is electrically inexcitable...|$|R
40|$|Action {{potential}} {{timing is}} fundamental to information processing; however, its determinants are not fully understood. Here we report unexpected structural specializations in the Ranvier nodes and internodes of auditory brainstem axons involved in sound localization. Myelination properties deviated significantly from the traditionally assumed structure. Axons responding best to low-frequency sounds had a larger diameter than high-frequency axons but, surprisingly, shorter internodes. Simulations predicted that this geometry helps to adjust the conduction velocity and timing of action potentials within the circuit. Electrophysiological recordings in vitro and in vivo confirmed higher conduction velocities in low-frequency <b>axons.</b> Moreover, internode <b>length</b> decreased and Ranvier node diameter increased progressively along the distal axon segments, which simulations show was essential to ensure precisely timed depolarization of the giant calyx of Held presynaptic terminal. Thus, individual anatomical parameters of myelinated axons can be tuned to optimize pathways involved in temporal processing...|$|R
