The relationship between axial force and twisting moment of wire rope with axial and rotational strain was given according to the linear stiffness coefficient. It was concluded that the twisting moment and axial strain under tensile load only depend on wire rope's geometry parameters which consist of helical angle and wire diameter. And the expression of bending stiffness was given. Through the analysis of an example, we find that the outer strand has a stronger effect on the tensile, torsional, and bending stiffness. And the closer the strand's helical angle is to 90 °, the bigger the tensile stiffness and the bending stiffness are. The helical angles that give consideration to all the three stiffness coefficients can be found. These can be used for reference when designing <b>antirotation</b> wire rope...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Helically shaped cephalic {{implants}} {{have proven}} their benefit {{to provide an}} improved stabilization of unstable hip fractures. However, cut out ratios up to 3. 6 % still occur. This in vitro study evaluated the biomechanical performance of a novel cement augmentation technique of the Proximal Femoral Nail <b>Antirotation</b> in surrogate femora. METHODS: Four study groups were formed out of 24 polyurethane foam specimens with low density. Proximal Femoral Nail <b>Antirotation</b> blades were implanted, either non-augmented, or augmented using 3 ml of injectable Polymethylmethacrylate bone-cement. The influence of implant mal-positioning was investigated by placing the blade either centered in the femoral head or off-centric in an anteroposterior direction. All specimens underwent cyclic loading under physiological conditions. Starting at 1000 N, the load was monotonically increased by 0. 1 N/cycle until construct failure. Movement of the head was identified by means of optical motion tracking. Non-parametric test statistics were carried out on the cycles to failure, to compare between study groups. FINDINGS: Compared to control samples; augmented samples showed a significantly increased number of cycles to failure (P= 0. 012). In the groups with centric position of the Proximal Femoral Nail <b>Antirotation</b> blade, cement augmentation led {{to an increase in}} loading cycles of 225 %. In the groups with off-centric positioning of the blade, this difference was even more accentuated (933 %). INTERPRETATION: Cement augmentation of the Proximal Femoral Nail <b>Antirotation</b> blade with small amounts of bone-cement for treatment of osteoporotic hip fractures clearly enhances fixation stability and carries high potential for clinical application. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The {{inspection}} of F- 100 {{gas turbine engine}} components using the Retirement For Cause (RFC) Eddy Current Inspection Station includes the requirement to scan three common but critical geometries: <b>Antirotation</b> windows (ARW), <b>antirotation</b> tangs (ART) and the live rim (LR) area at the component rim, as shown in Figures 1 and 2. These geometries have a common feature — edges, as shown in Figure 3 — that presents a challenge to successful inspection. The edges are sources of strong geometry signals that often have a higher amplitude than flaw signals, thus making a conventional amplitude inspection technique difficult. Therefore, a “frequency select” technique was developed which uses the frequency difference as a flaw determination criteria [1, 2].

40|$|The {{inspection}} capability on {{turbine engine}} disks {{is important to}} the safety of an airplane. Eddy current inspection has been widely accepted as an effective tool in detecting small fatigue cracks on engine disks. The inspection of simple geometries such as boltholes, webs and bores in a engine disk is less complicated than those of complex geometries such as <b>antirotation</b> windows, scallops, dovetails and non-circular holes. One of the main difficulties in inspecting complex geometries is due to the presence of irregular edges. Raatz [1] reported the influence of edges in measuring conductivity. Williams, Tilson and Blitz [2] minimized the change of phase angle variation around an edge by the proper selection of inspection frequency and coil size. Elsberry and Bailey [3] enhanced edge defect detection by using a shielded probe to collimate the field. Hoppe and Stubbs [4], on the other hand, used the frequency content of the edge signals to discern the edge defect in <b>antirotation</b> windows. This frequency approach was extended to the inspection of other complex geometries such as <b>antirotation</b> tangs and live rims by Ko [5]. Furthermore, Ko [6] used the edge signals in scallops to position a rotational probe in a scallop prior to inspection. These techniques [4 – 6] are limited to partial inspection of the geometries; however, a new technique is needed if an entire inspection of a complex geometry is required. This paper discusses the use of a simple mechanical mechanism to adapt to a complex geometry, and a signal processing technique for the detection of edge defects...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE The {{cost-effectiveness}} of cast nonprecious frameworks {{has increased}} their prevalence in cemented implant crowns. The {{purpose of this}} study was to assess the effect of the design and height of the retentive component of a standard titanium implant abutment on the fit, possible horizontal rotation and retention forces of cast nonprecious alloy crowns prior to cementation. MATERIALS AND METHODS Two abutment designs were examined: Type A with a 6 ° taper and 8 <b>antirotation</b> planes (Straumann Tissue-Level RN) and Type B with a 7. 5 ° taper and 1 <b>antirotation</b> plane (SICace implant). Both types were analyzed using 60 crowns: 20 with a full abutment height (6  mm), 20 with a medium abutment height (4  mm), and 20 with a minimal (2. 5  mm) abutment height. The marginal and internal fit and the degree of possible rotation were evaluated by using polyvinylsiloxane impressions under a light microscope (magnification of × 50). To measure the retention force, a custom force-measuring device was employed. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum tests with Bonferroni-Holm corrections, Fisher's exact tests, and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. RESULTS Type A exhibited increased marginal gaps (primary end-point: 55  ±  20  μm vs. 138  ±  59  μm, P <  0. 001) but less rotation (P <  0. 001) than Type B. The internal fit was also better for Type A than for Type B (P <  0. 001). The retention force of Type A (2. 49  ±  3. 2  N) was higher (P =  0. 019) than that of Type B (1. 27  ±  0. 84  N). Reduction in abutment height did not affect the variables observed. CONCLUSION Less-tapered abutments with more <b>antirotation</b> planes provide an increase in the retention force, which confines the horizontal rotation but widens the marginal gaps of the crowns.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe best {{options of}} {{internal}} fixation for unstable intertrochanteric fractures in elderly Chinese patients remain controversial. The Asia proximal femoral nail <b>antirotation</b> (PFNA-II) was {{specifically designed for}} Asian patients, which could {{be more effective than}} the regular proximal femoral nail <b>antirotation</b> (PFNA). Compared to PFNA, whether PFNA-II is associated with shorter operative time and lower rates of complications is unknown. HypothesisThe rate of complications using PFNA-II is lower than PFNA for the treatment of unstable intertrochanteric fractures in elderly Chinese patients, and the operation using PFNA-II is quicker. Materials and methodsBetween June 2008 and December 2011, 188 patients with unstable intertrochanteric fractures treated with the PFNA-II (n= 118) or PFNA (n= 70) were retrospectively evaluated. Follow-up evaluations were performed at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, and every year thereafter. According to residual valgus-varus deformation, the quality of the fracture reduction was graded as poor (> 10 ° deformation), acceptable (5 ° to 10 ° deformation), or good (0. 05), visual analogue scale (VAS) (0. 87 ± 0. 85 vs 0. 97 ± 0. 87; P> 0. 05). DiscussionDue to its special design for the Asian population, PFNA-II offers a better match with the Chinese people's proximal femur anatomic structure.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: : This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the specific type and incidence of implant failure in patients with a proximal femur fracture treated with a proximal femoral nail <b>antirotation.</b> This device has a helical-shaped blade as a neck-head holding device, instead of the lag screw used in other intramedullary nails. The advantage of the blade is believed to originate from bone impaction and a larger bone-implant interface in comparison with the lag screw design, with consequential greater mechanical resistance to torsion in the cancellous bone. PATIENTS AND METHODS: : This is a retrospective cohort study conducted at the state hospital of Winterthur, Switzerland. From December 2006 until November 2008, 210 consecutive patients were treated with a pertrochanteric femur fracture (OTA type 31 -A 1, 31 -A 2, and 31 -A 3) using a proximal femoral nail <b>antirotation.</b> One hundred and twelve patients were followed up clinically for a minimum of 12 months after discharge. Clinical and radiologic assessment of fracture healing and/or implant failure was investigated. RESULTS: : We report 7 cases of implant failure with a "Cut Through," defined as a postoperative central perforation of the spiral blade into the hip joint, without any displacement of the neck-head fragment. CONCLUSIONS: : Cut through needs to be distinguished from the well-known anterocranial perforation combined with a varus displacement of the neck-head fragment, known as "Cut Out," seen with intramedullary nails utilizing lag screws.

MethodsFrom September 2008 to March 2009, 35 senile patients with intertrochanteric fracture, aged from 65 to 92 years {{with an average}} age of 76. 5 years, were treated with PFNA within 24 hours after injury. There were 10 type I fractures, 19 type II and 6 type III according to upgraded Evans-Jensen classification system. All patients were complicated with osteoporosis, and 19 patients had preexisting internal medical diseases. According to the rating scale of disease severity by the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), there were 9 grade I, 14 grade II, 8 grade III, and 4 grade IV. ResultsThe duration for operation ranged from 45 to 73 minutes with an average of 57. 6 minutes. The volume of blood loss during operation ranged from 50 to 120 ml with an average of 77. 5 ml. Patients could ambulate 2 – 4 days after operation (mean 3. 5 days). Hospital stay was 4 – 7 days (mean 5. 3 days). Full weight bearing time was 10 – 14 weeks (mean 12. 8 weeks). During hospitalization period, there was no regional or deep infection, hypostatic pneumonia, urinary tract infection and bedsore except for 2 cases of urine retention. All cases were followed up with an average period of 12. 3 months, and bone healing achieved within 15 – 18 weeks (mean 16. 6 weeks). No complications such as delayed union, coxa vara or coxa valga, screw breakage or backout occurred and only 2 cases had trochanter bursitis because of thin body and overlong end of the antirotated nail.

Using our new data together with wide-area surveys in other fields available to date, we discuss the radial and vertical structure of the Galaxy. We have derived the density laws for stars as a function of distance from the galactic plane for each absolute magnitude interval. The density laws for stars with MV 3. 5 follow a sum of two exponentials with scale heights of [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the clinical results and complications of proximal femoral nail <b>antirotation</b> (PFNA) on treatment of intertrochanteric fractures in 120 elderly Chinese patients using Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs). Totaly 120 cases enrolled were randomly assigned to a lateral decubitus position group and supine position group. The hospital stay, operating time, intraoperative blood loss, length of incision, X-ray fluoroscopy time, and out-of-bed activity time in the lateral decubitus position group were significantly lower than those in the supine position group. There was not statistical significance on union time and Harris values in the two position groups. Moreover, only complications of superficial wound infection were observed in the lateral decubitus position group, but two complications of deep venous thrombosis and wound deep infection were found in the supine position group. The present findings suggested that PFNA applied in elderly patients with intertrochanteric fracture can get satisfactory effects, and the treatment of intertrochanteric fractures using lateral decubitus position showed a satisfactory clinical outcome and a lower radiological complication rate...|$|E
