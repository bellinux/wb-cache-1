5|$|By 1859, Rosalie Cadron-Jetté's {{health was}} {{worsening}} significantly. Information about the particular conditions she was afflicted with is contradictory. Testimony from Cadron-Jetté's family suggests that Cadron-Jetté had become ill {{when she was}} 36 years old and never fully recovered. Other sources suggest generalised edema, known <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> dropsy, while still others diagnose her with chronic nephritis, known <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> Bright's disease, which worsened over the following years. Symptoms observed in Cadron-Jetté by her contemporaries included difficulty breathing, almost constant coughing, fits of breathlessness while standing and at rest, and swollen legs displaying open sores.|$|E
5|$|Apparently Constantine did not patronize Christianity alone. After gaining {{victory in}} the Battle of the Milvian Bridge (312), a triumphal arch—the Arch of Constantine—was built (315) to {{celebrate}} his triumph. The arch is decorated with images of the goddess Victoria. At {{the time of its}} dedication, sacrifices to gods like Apollo, Diana, and Hercules were made. Absent from the Arch are any depictions of Christian symbolism. However, as the Arch was commissioned by the Senate, the absence of Christian symbols may reflect the role of the Curia <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> a pagan redoubt.|$|E
5|$|As of April 1996, {{the option}} to order the seventh and eighth {{submarines}} was still under consideration, but was looked on unfavourably by the Department of Defence <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>as</b> the additional cost would require the diversion of funding from the Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force, resulting in an imbalance in {{the capabilities of the}} Australian Defence Force. The option was cancelled outright by late 2001.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, work was {{commissioned}} to precisely determine {{the mass of}} a cubic decimetre (one litre) of water. Although the decreed definition of the kilogram specified water at 0°C—its highly stable temperature point—the French chemist Louis Lefèvre-Gineau and the Italian naturalist Giovanni Fabbroni {{after several years of}} research chose to redefine the standard in 1799 to water's most stable density point: the temperature at which water reaches maximum density, which was measured <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> 4°C.|$|E
