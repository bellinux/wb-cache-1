Among the women with whom he mixed socially at Cambridge was Adeline Fisher, the daughter of Herbert Fisher, {{an old friend of}} the Vaughan Williams family. She and Vaughan Williams grew close, and in June 1897, after he had left Cambridge, they became engaged to be married.|$|E

5|$|Diabetic {{ketoacidosis}} {{occurs in}} 4.6–8.0 per 1000 {{people with diabetes}} annually. Rates <b>among</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> type 1 diabetes are higher with about 4% in United Kingdom developing DKA a year while in Malaysia the condition affects about 25% a year. In the United States, 135,000 hospital admissions occur annually {{as a result of}} DKA, at an estimated cost of $2.4 billion or a quarter to a half the total cost of caring for people with type 1 diabetes. There has been a documented increasing trend to hospital admissions. The risk is increased in those with an ongoing risk factor, such as an eating disorder, and those who cannot afford insulin. About 30% of children with type 1 diabetes receive their diagnosis after an episode of DKA.|$|E

5|$|Music took on {{a pivotal}} and {{permanent}} role in Einstein's life from that period on. Although the idea of becoming a professional musician himself was not on his mind at any time, <b>among</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> whom Einstein played chamber music were a few professionals, and he performed for private audiences and friends. Chamber music had also become {{a regular part of}} his social life while living in Bern, Zürich, and Berlin, where he played with Max Planck and his son, among others. He is sometimes erroneously credited as the editor of the 1937 edition of the Köchel catalogue of Mozart's work; that edition was prepared by Alfred Einstein, who may have been a distant relation.|$|E
5|$|Tactile ASL (TASL) is {{a variety}} of ASL used {{throughout}} the United States by and with the deaf-blind. It is particularly common <b>among</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> Usher's syndrome. This syndrome results in deafness from birth followed by loss of vision later in life; consequently, those with Usher's syndrome often {{grow up in the}} Deaf community using ASL, and later transition to TASL. TASL differs from ASL in that signs are produced by touching the palms, and there are some grammatical differences from standard ASL in order to compensate for the lack of non-manual signing.|$|E
5|$|Infection, {{bacterial}} or viral, {{particularly from}} Staphylococcus aureus, group A streptococcus and Pseudomonas spp. Reports at the 16th European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases in 2006 indicated that bacterial infections are seldom serious, but that ten to {{twenty percent of}} piercings result in local benign bacterial infection. The Mayo Clinic estimates 30%. Risk of infection is greatest <b>among</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> congenital heart disease, who have a much higher chance of developing life-threatening infective endocarditis, hemophiliacs and diabetics, {{as well as those}} taking corticosteroids. In 2006, a diabetic woman in Indiana lost a breast due to an infection from a nipple piercing. Viral infections may include hepatitis B, hepatitis C and, potentially, HIV, although as of 2009 there had been no documented cases of HIV caused by piercing. While rare, infection due to piercing of the tongue can be fatal. Higher prevalence of colonization of Candida albicans was reported in young individuals with tongue piercing, in comparison to non-tongue-pierced matched individuals.|$|E

5|$|It {{is unclear}} if <b>among</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> non-chronic back pain {{alternative}} treatments are useful. For chiropractic care or spinal manipulation therapy (SMT) {{it is unclear}} if it improves outcomes {{more or less than}} other treatments. Some reviews find that SMT results in equal or better improvements in pain and function when compared with other commonly used interventions for short, intermediate, and long-term follow-up; other reviews find it to be no more effective in reducing pain than either inert interventions, sham manipulation, or other treatments, and conclude that adding SMT to other treatments does improve outcomes. National guidelines reach different conclusions, with some not recommending spinal manipulation, some describing manipulation as optional, and others recommending a short course {{for those who do not}} improve with other treatments. A 2017 review recommended spinal manipulation based on low quality evidence. Manipulation under anaesthesia, or medically assisted manipulation, has not enough evidence to make any confident recommendation.|$|E
5|$|Traditional {{styles of}} {{architecture}} in Madagascar have been impacted {{over the past}} two hundred years by the increasing influence of European styles. A shift toward brick construction in the Highlands began during the reign of Queen Ranavalona II (1868–1883) based on models introduced by missionaries of the London Missionary Society and contacts with other foreigners. Foreign influence further expanded following the collapse of the monarchy and French colonization of the island in 1896. Modernization {{over the past several decades}} has increasingly led to the abandonment of certain traditional norms related to the external orientation and internal layout of houses and the use of certain customary building materials, particularly in the Highlands. <b>Among</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> means, foreign construction materials and techniques – namely imported concrete, glass and wrought iron features – have gained in popularity, to the detriment of traditional practices.|$|E
5|$|Difficulty delaying {{gratification}} {{also plays}} a role in internalizing disorders like anxiety and depression. A hallmark behavior in anxiety is avoidance of feared or anxiety-provoking situations. By seeking the immediate relief that comes with avoidance, a person is succumbing to the pull of instant gratification over the larger reward from overcoming the fear and anxiety that caused the avoidance. Procrastination, which is often a reflection of anxiety, is a clear example: a person avoids a dreaded task by engaging in a more enjoyable immediate activity instead. Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a more jarring case of this anxiety-related struggle to delay gratification; someone with OCD is unable to resist compulsions that temporarily mitigate the torture of obsessive thoughts, even though these compulsions do not banish the obsessions in the long run. One experiment, however, did not find any significant differences between samples with OCD and healthy controls in delayed gratification, while finding substantially improved delayed gratification <b>among</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> obsessive–compulsive personality disorder. Depression is also associated with lower capacity to delay gratification, though the direction of cause and effect is not clear. A depressed person who has difficulty pushing him or herself to engage in previously enjoyed activities is (deliberately or not) prioritizing short-term comfort and is demonstrating an impaired ability to delay gratification. There is evidence that individuals who engage in deliberate self-harm (i.e., cut themselves) are less able to tolerate emotional distress but are more able to tolerate physical pain. Thus it is argued that they injure themselves because they cannot delay gratification and need a way to end emotional pain quickly.|$|E
