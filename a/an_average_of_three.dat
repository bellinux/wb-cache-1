Access to medical care remains {{beyond the reach of}} many Malagasy, especially in the rural areas, and many recourse to traditional healers. In addition to the high expense of medical care relative to the average Malagasy income, the prevalence of trained medical professionals remains extremely low. In 2010 Madagascar had <b>an</b> <b>average</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> hospital beds per 10,000people and a total of 3,150doctors, 5,661nurses, 385community health workers, 175pharmacists and 57dentists for a population of 22million. 14.6percent of government spending in 2008 was directed toward the health sector.

The government provides at least one basic health center per commune. Private health centers are concentrated within urban areas and particularly those of the central highlands.|$|E

Ottawa {{defeated}} Princeton by a 3–2 score. Princeton won the 1914 national championship after they {{finished with a}} record of ten wins and three losses. Statistics were not kept of his time at Princeton, but biographer Emil Salvini estimated Baker to have scored over 120 goals and 100 assists in three years, <b>an</b> <b>average</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> goals and three assists per game.

He visited the dressing rooms of opponents after every game to shake hands with each player.|$|E

25|$|The {{low level}} of islands makes them very {{sensitive}} to sea-level rise. Nui {{was struck by a}} giant wave on 16 February 1882; earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occurring in the basin of the Pacific Ocean - the Pacific Ring of Fire - are possible causes of a tsunami. Tuvalu experienced <b>an</b> <b>average</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> tropical cyclones per decade between the 1940s and 1970s, however eight occurred in the 1980s. The impact of individual cyclones is subject to variables including the force of the winds and also whether a cyclone coincides with high tides.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} types of RNA {{modifications}} that impact gene expression. These modifications happen to all types of cellular RNA including, but not limited to, ribosomal RNA(rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), messenger RNA (mRNA), and small nuclear RNA (snRNA). There are {{more than one hundred}} documented RNA modifications, which are described in a database maintained by the RNA Institute at the University at Albany. The most common and well-understood mRNA modification at present is the N6-Methyladenosine (m6A), which has been observed to occur <b>an</b> <b>average</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> times in every mRNA molecule.|$|E
25|$|Severe {{tropical}} cyclones {{are usually}} rare, however {{the low level}} of islands makes them very sensitive to sea-level rise.

The impact of individual cyclones is subject to variables including the force of the winds and also whether a cyclone coincides with high tides. An warning system, which uses the Iridium satellite network, was introduced in 2016 in order to allow outlying islands to be better prepare for natural disasters.|$|E

25|$|The residences did {{not fully}} keep up with this rapid growth; by 1910, there were 1,877 {{official}} rooms and some unrecognised residences, which meant that <b>an</b> <b>average</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> to four people lived in a single room; this density decreased steadily during the decades to follow. Kiruna became a municipalsamhälle (a community within a municipality) in 1908. This caused unhappiness in local organisations, such as Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara Arbetareförening, that had hoped for a status as köping, which would have kept more of the mining income inside the locality. In return, the mining company LKAB paid for a hospital, fire station, sewage, roads, a church (opened 1912) and the priest's home.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{banknotes}} last <b>an</b> <b>average</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> {{years until}} {{they are no longer}} fit for circulation, after which they are collected for destruction, usually recycling or shredding. A banknote is removed from the money supply by banks or other financial institutions because of everyday wear and tear from its handling. Banknote bundles are passed through a sorting machine that determines whether a particular note needs to be shredded, or are removed from the supply chain by a human inspector if they are deemed unfit for continued use – for example, if they are mutilated or torn. Counterfeit banknotes are destroyed unless they are needed for evidentiary or forensic purposes.|$|E
25|$|The law {{provides}} for investigative detention {{of up to}} two years for indicted persons awaiting or undergoing trial; the period may be extended for one year in limited situations.

CELS reported that prisoners waited <b>an</b> <b>average</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> years to be tried, with some cases taking as long as six years to go to trial. A convicted prisoner usually received credit for time already served. In 2008, in Buenos Aires Province, provisional statistics from CELS indicated that nearly 75 percent of detainees were in pretrial detention, while the Buenos Aires Provincial Memory Commission Committee Against Torture reported that 78 percent of the approximately 26,000 detainees in provincial prisons were awaiting trial.|$|E

Cyclone Bebe in 1972 caused severe damage to Funafuti. Funafuti's Tepuka Vili Vili islet was devastated by Cyclone Meli in 1979, with all its vegetation and most of its sand swept away during the cyclone. Along with a tropical depression that affected the islands a few days later, Severe Tropical Cyclone Ofa had a major impact on Tuvalu with most islands reporting damage to vegetation and crops. Cyclone Gavin was first identified during 2 March 1997, and was the first of three tropical cyclones to affect Tuvalu during the 1996–97 cyclone season with Cyclones Hina and Keli following later in the season.|$|E
