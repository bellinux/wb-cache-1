40|$|AbstractWe prospectively studied 64 {{consecutive}} {{patients on}} whom computerized tomography-guided fine needle aspirations (CT-FNA) of pulmonary lesions {{were performed to}} determine whether obtaining <b>a</b> <b>delayed</b> chest radiograpy (CXR) after CT-FNA is helpful in the diagnosis of post-procedure pneumothorax (PTX). Two of the 64 patients developed <b>a</b> <b>delayed</b> PTX. Only one of the patients with <b>a</b> <b>delayed</b> PTX required chest tube drainage. If patients have {{no evidence of a}} PTX immediately after a CT-FNA by CT scan then <b>a</b> <b>delayed</b> CXR adds little to care of these patients...|$|R

40|$|This {{study found}} no {{evidence}} supporting <b>a</b> <b>delayed</b> introduction of solids beyond 4 or 6 months {{for the prevention of}} asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food or inhalant sensitization at the age of 6 years. For eczema, the results were conflicting, and a protective effect of <b>a</b> <b>delayed</b> introduction of solids cannot be excluded. Positive associations between late introduction of solids and food sensitization have to be interpreted with caution. A true protective effect of <b>a</b> <b>delayed</b> introduction of solids on food sensitization seems unlikely...|$|R
5|$|If the Parliament Act 1949 {{were found}} {{not to be}} an Act of Parliament {{on any of the}} above grounds, all {{legislation}} passed using the Parliament Acts since the introduction of the 1949 Act, including the Hunting Act, would also not be valid Acts of Parliament, being passed only in accordance with the 1949 Act (rejection in two successive sessions and <b>a</b> <b>delay</b> of one year) as opposed to the more onerous requirements of the 1911 Act (rejection in three successive sessions and <b>a</b> <b>delay</b> of two years).|$|E
5|$|On 22 August 2008, after <b>a</b> <b>delay</b> {{following}} Tropical Storm Fay, Atlantis was rolled {{from the}} Orbiter Processing Facility to the Vehicle Assembly Building, {{where it was}} mated to the external fuel tank and solid rocket booster stack. Problems were encountered during the mating process, and poor weather due to Hurricane Hanna caused <b>a</b> <b>delay</b> in the rollout of Atlantis to the launch pad, which is normally done seven days after rollover.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} also {{stipulates that}} if the OPCW Director-General determined there had been <b>a</b> <b>delay</b> in implementation of the decision, the matter should be discussed within 24 hours, when it should be decided whether the matter should be submitted to the UN Security Council.|$|E
50|$|MGD PM-9 was a French submachine gun, {{designed}} in the late 1940s or early 1950s by Louis Debuit. It was <b>a</b> <b>delayed</b> blowback weapon, firing from an open bolt; it used a rotating flywheel as <b>a</b> <b>delaying</b> mass for its bolt, which was highly unusual. The design was never mass-produced.|$|R

50|$|Moreover, {{findings}} from a cross-sectional {{study suggest that}} children with developmental dyscalculia might have <b>a</b> <b>delayed</b> development in their numerical magnitude representation {{by as much as}} five years. However, the lack of longitudinal studies still leaves the question open as to whether the deficient numerical magnitude representation is <b>a</b> <b>delayed</b> development or impairment.|$|R
5|$|The producers/distributors {{exercised}} {{a higher}} than normal level of control over their work. There was a limited release, {{a new form of}} television publicity, safeguards against video piracy, and <b>a</b> <b>delay</b> in the releasing of video tapes.|$|E
5|$|As the {{publication}} date neared, difficulties arose. In January 1869, Dallas asked Trollope {{for permission to}} defer serial publication by three months. As Trollope had agreed not to allow another of his novels to run serially {{during the first six}} months of The Vicars career, the editor's request would have diminished the author's income. Trollope initially refused, but subsequently agreed to <b>a</b> <b>delay</b> of two months, with publication to begin in early July.|$|E
5|$|Difficulties in {{accurately}} locating Flight 11 caused <b>a</b> <b>delay</b> of five minutes, to 8:43am, {{before the}} scramble order was given and pilots Duffy and Nash could respond. When Flight 11 hit the North Tower at 8:46, the two jets were still readying for flight {{and did not}} take off until 8:52am.|$|E

5|$|Early on 15 April, the {{northern}} column of the 14th Panzer Division closed on Doboj, and after overcoming resistance around that town, arrived in Sarajevo at 20:45. Before noon, Nedeljković received orders that a ceasefire had been agreed, {{and that all}} 4th Army troops were to remain in place and not fire on German personnel. After <b>a</b> <b>delay</b> in locating appropriate signatories for the surrender document, the Yugoslav Supreme Command unconditionally surrendered in Belgrade effective at 12:00 on 18 April.|$|E
5|$|Games {{last longer}} than their defined length due to play {{stoppages}} – the average NFL game lasts slightly over three hours. Time in a football game {{is measured by the}} game clock. An operator is responsible for starting, stopping and operating the game clock based on the direction of the appropriate official. A separate clock, the play clock, is used to determine if <b>a</b> <b>delay</b> of game infraction has been committed. If the play clock expires before the ball has been snapped or free-kicked, <b>a</b> <b>delay</b> of game foul is called on the offense. The play clock is set to 40 seconds in professional and college football and to 25 seconds in high school play or following certain administrative stoppages in the former levels of play.|$|E
5|$|In older {{children}} and adolescents, {{the symptoms of}} hypothyroidism may include fatigue, cold intolerance, sleepiness, muscle weakness, constipation, <b>a</b> <b>delay</b> in growth, overweight for height, pallor, coarse and thick skin, increased body hair, irregular menstrual cycles in girls, and delayed puberty. Signs may include delayed relaxation of the ankle reflex and a slow heart beat. A goiter may be present with a completely enlarged thyroid gland; sometimes {{only part of the}} thyroid is enlarged and it can be knobby in character.|$|E
30|$|Systems are {{considered}} {{related to the}} control of processes described by oscillating second-order systems of differential equations with <b>a</b> single <b>delay.</b> An explicit representation of solutions {{with the aid of}} special matrix functions called <b>a</b> <b>delayed</b> matrix sine and <b>a</b> <b>delayed</b> matrix cosine is used to develop the conditions of relative controllability and to construct a specific control function solving the relative controllability problem of transferring an initial function to a prescribed point in the phase space.|$|R

5|$|Innocent XII's age {{and health}} {{had been a}} topic of {{conversation}} among European courts and cardinals, and when he became sick in November 1699 speculation as to the next conclave became more ernest. Despite this, France was the only great power {{to have a clear}} policy regarding the next papal conclave. Both Spain and the Holy Roman Empire were bogged down in extensive conversations in their capitals that caused <b>a</b> <b>delay</b> in their ambassadors receiving orders..|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{also found}} that the deicing {{procedures}} at LaGuardia were substandard. While the jet encountered <b>a</b> <b>delay</b> of up to 35 minutes, they found that the deicing fluid that was being used at the airport, and by the majority of commercial airlines across the United States, was effective for only fifteen minutes. The accident led to a number of studies into the effect that ice has on aircraft, and several recommendations into prevention techniques.|$|E

5|$|Remnants of the 4th Army {{conducted}} a fighting withdrawal through Bosnia towards Sarajevo {{over the following}} days, pursued by the 14th Panzer Division and elements of LI Infantry Corps but a ceasefire was declared at noon on 15 April. After <b>a</b> <b>delay</b> in locating appropriate signatories for the surrender document, the Yugoslav Supreme Command unconditionally surrendered in Belgrade effective at 12:00 on 18 April. Yugoslavia was then occupied and dismembered by the Axis powers, with Germany, Italy, Hungary, Bulgaria and Albania all annexing parts of its territory.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposed}} degree would {{consist of}} courses not only in agricultural economics, but also agriculture, land economics, farm management, rural sociology, statistics, mathematics, economic history, and economic policy. After <b>a</b> <b>delay</b> spent obtaining funding for the new program, the faculty was established and began instruction in March 1958. Between 1960 and 1985, 450 students graduated from the program. In 1980, the Commonwealth government named New England as a Key Centre for Advanced Training in Agricultural Economics.|$|E
5|$|There was <b>a</b> <b>delay</b> {{of several}} weeks before the report was {{distributed}} widely enough to gain the attention of governments.

Vrba argued until {{the end of his life}} that the deportees would have refused to board the trains had the report been distributed wider and publicized sooner, a position generally not accepted by Holocaust historians.|$|E
