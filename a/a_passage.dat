50|$|All the {{existing}} secret passages are essentially interconnected. A {{player in a}} room with <b>a</b> secret <b>passage</b> door can move into any other room with <b>a</b> secret <b>passage</b> door. It doesn't matter when each of the different passages were created. Again, a player carrying a claimed treasure chest cannot fit through <b>a</b> secret <b>passage.</b>|$|R

5|$|Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm was {{inspired}} by <b>a</b> <b>passage</b> in Thomas Gray's poem The Bard. The theme of The Bard was the English king Edward I's conquest of Wales, and a curse placed by a Welsh bard upon Edward's descendants after he ordered the execution of all bards and the eradication of Welsh culture. Etty used <b>a</b> <b>passage</b> Gray intended to symbolise the seemingly bright start to the disastrous reign of Edward's great-great-grandson Richard II.|$|E

5|$|Darwin quoted <b>a</b> <b>passage</b> from Aristotle's Physics II 8 in The Origin of Species, which entertains the {{possibility}} of a selection process following the random combination of body parts. However, Aristotle immediately rejected {{the possibility}}, and he was in any case discussing ontogeny, the Empedoclean coming into being of an individual from component parts, not phylogeny and natural selection.|$|E

50|$|Enables {{a player}} to create <b>a</b> secret <b>passage.</b> After playing the card, the player puts one of the plastic secret passage doors in the room (s)he is {{currently}} in, and then places another secret passage door and his/her pawn into another room. One restriction is that <b>a</b> secret <b>passage</b> door cannot be put into the Foyer. And secondly, a player with a claimed treasure chest cannot move though <b>a</b> secret <b>passage.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The work is {{composed}} of two motives: <b>a</b> rapid <b>passage</b> of widely spaced intervals which alternates between the two pianos and a bi-tonal [...] "taxi"-like motive which enters in <b>a</b> cyclical <b>passage.</b> After <b>a</b> slower <b>passage</b> using irregular time signatures and [...] "Stravinskian" [...] polytonality, the initial material is presented in a fugato, which brings the work to a brisk close. A typical performance takes about four minutes.|$|R
5|$|This {{version of}} the story appears in Virgil's Aeneid, in <b>a</b> <b>passage</b> {{describing}} a series of paintings decorating the walls of a temple of Juno. The painting immediately next to the one depicting Troilus shows the death of Rhesus, another character killed because of prophecies linked to the fall of Troy. Other pictures are similarly calamitous.|$|E
5|$|A distant, mournful fanfare (A), {{played on}} a cornet {{representing}} a bugle, {{is followed by a}} brisk military march initiated by a duet for side drum and piccolo (B). <b>A</b> <b>passage</b> for brass precedes the introduction of a theme or leitmotif associated with the phantom Kijé which, after a reprise of the march and a C major crescendo, is repeated on tenor saxophone, an instrument relatively new to the orchestra at that time. The cornet fanfare then returns to close the movement.|$|E
5|$|As a Predator ship reaches Earth's orbit, it fires a beam {{that creates}} <b>a</b> <b>passage</b> {{through the ice}} towards {{the source of the}} heat bloom. When the team arrives at the {{abandoned}} whaling station above the heat source, they find the passage and descend beneath the ice. They locate the mysterious pyramid and begin to explore it, finding evidence of a prehistoric civilization and {{what appears to be a}} sacrificial chamber filled with human skeletons with ruptured rib cages.|$|E

5|$|As the Brazilian {{army was}} ready for combat, Caxias sought to {{encircle}} Humaitá and force its capitulation by siege. To aid the operation, he used observation balloons to gather information of the enemy lines. The combined Brazilian–Argentine–Uruguayan army advanced through hostile territory to surround Humaitá. By 2 November, Humaitá was completely cut off from land reinforcement by Paraguayan forces. On 19 February 1868, Brazilian ironclads successfully made <b>a</b> <b>passage</b> up the Paraguay River under heavy fire, gaining full control {{of the river and}} isolating Humaitá from resupply by water.|$|E
5|$|At the Gansevoort Street end, {{which runs}} north-south, the stub end over Gansevoort Street is named the Tiffany and Co. Foundation Overlook, {{dedicated}} in July 2012; the foundation {{was a major}} backer of the park. Then, it passes under The Standard hotel, and through <b>a</b> <b>passage</b> at 14th Street. At 14th Street, the High Line is split into two sides of different elevations; the Diller-Von Furstenberg Water Feature, opened in 2010, is featured on the lower side, and a sundeck on the upper side.|$|E
5|$|At {{the angle}} of each aisle, a spiral {{staircase}} – still visible {{on each side of}} the surviving east wall – gave access to <b>a</b> <b>passage</b> inside the walls and to secondary stairs within the angles of the main gable enabling access to all parts of the building for maintenance and cleaning without requiring scaffolding. Nothing remains of the north or south transepts, which extended on the north side beyond the present boundary wall into the graveyard of St Nicholas's Church.|$|E

5|$|During the Middle Ages, {{the monastic}} traditions of both Western and Eastern Christianity moved beyond vocal prayer to Christian meditation. These progressions {{resulted}} in two distinct and different meditative practices: Lectio Divina in the West and hesychasm in the East. Hesychasm involves {{the repetition of}} the Jesus Prayer, but Lectio Divina uses different Scripture passages at different times and although <b>a</b> <b>passage</b> may be repeated a few times, Lectio Divina is not repetitive in nature.|$|E
5|$|Garrow's {{work was}} cited in court as {{recently}} as 1982, when the Supreme Court of Canada quoted <b>a</b> <b>passage</b> from The Trial of William Davidson and Richard Tidd for High Treason, where Garrow instructed the jury {{as to how to}} interpret testimony, in Vetrovec v The Queen in 1982. In 2006 he was again quoted, when the Irish Court of Criminal Appeal used the same work in their review of the 1982 conviction of Brian Meehan for the murder of Veronica Guerin.|$|E
5|$|King Midas– A king whose touch turned {{anything}} to gold, he was grief-stricken and hallucinating as he accidentally turned {{his daughter to}} gold. Kratos encountered Midas in the Mounts of Aroania where the Spartan killed him by throwing him into a lava river — turning it to gold — which created <b>a</b> <b>passage</b> for Kratos. The character was voiced by Fred Tatasciore in Ghost of Sparta.|$|E

5|$|Later, Means and Black {{listen to}} McKenna reading <b>a</b> <b>passage</b> from the Bible. Afterwards, McKenna reveals {{that she knows}} {{a great deal about}} the Polaroid Man who kidnapped Black weeks earlier. Means {{receives}} a vision herself during the conversation, and becomes convinced that McKenna is a prophet of some sort. Black thinks the girl is acting out, but Means reveals that she is reciting passages from the non-canonical Gnostic Gospels, which supposed that Mary Magdalene was the only disciple to fully understand the teachings of Jesus Christ. Means believes the girls are not seeing visions of Saint Mary, but of Mary Magdalene.|$|E
5|$|Manuel was {{prevented}} from following up his early successes in the east, for events {{to the west}} meant that his presence was urgently required in the Balkans. In 1147 he granted <b>a</b> <b>passage</b> through his dominions to two armies of the Second Crusade under Conrad III of Germany and Louis VII of France. At this time, there were still members of the Byzantine court who remembered {{the passage of the}} First Crusade, a defining event in the collective memory of the age that had fascinated Manuel's aunt, Anna Komnene.|$|E
5|$|Mary is {{presented}} as a Marian apparition; in this case she probably appears before a donor, who would have been kneeling in prayer in the now lost opposite panel. The idea of a saint appearing before laity was common in Northern art of the period, and is also represented in van Eyck's Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele (1434–36). There, the Canon is portrayed as if having just momentarily paused to reflect on <b>a</b> <b>passage</b> from his hand-held bible as the Virgin and Child with two saints appear before him, as if embodiments of his prayer.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> close solar <b>passage</b> {{can be used}} to {{increase}} a craft's energy. The increased radiation pressure combines with the efficacy of being deep in the Sun's gravity well to substantially increase the energy for runs to the outer Solar System. The optimal approach to the Sun is done by increasing the orbital eccentricity while keeping the energy level as high as practical. The minimum approach distance is a function of sail angle, thermal properties of the sail and other structure, load effects on structure, and sail optical characteristics (reflectivity and emissivity). <b>A</b> close <b>passage</b> can result in substantial optical degradation. Required turn rates can increase substantially for <b>a</b> close <b>passage.</b> <b>A</b> sail craft arriving at a star can use <b>a</b> close <b>passage</b> to reduce energy, which also applies to a sail craft on a return trip from the outer Solar System.|$|R
50|$|Meridians of {{longitude}} and parallels of latitude provide {{special cases}} of the rhumb line, where their angles of intersection are respectively 0° and 90°. On <b>a</b> north-south <b>passage</b> the rhumb line course coincides with a great circle, as it does on <b>an</b> east-west <b>passage</b> along the equator.|$|R
