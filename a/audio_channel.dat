This VCD showed the lyrics of the song on the video, and the user was able to mute the right <b>audio</b> <b>channel,</b> which contained the full vocal version of the song, or the left <b>audio</b> <b>channel,</b> which contained the instrumental version of the song.|$|E
5|$|Robotron: 2084 {{features}} monaural {{sound and}} raster graphics on a 19-inch CRT monitor. It uses a Motorola 6809 {{central processing unit}} that operates at 1MHz. To produce multiple sounds on a single <b>audio</b> <b>channel,</b> the game uses a priority scheme to generate sounds in order of importance. A custom graphics coprocessor—which operates as a blitter chip—generates the on-screen objects and visual effects. The coprocessor increases the transfer speed of memory, which allows the game to simultaneously animate {{a large number of}} objects.|$|E
25|$|VCDs {{are often}} bilingual. Because they feature stereo audio, disc players have {{an option to}} play only {{the left or right}} <b>audio</b> <b>channel.</b> On some films, they feature English on the left <b>audio</b> <b>channel</b> and Cantonese on the right; more {{commonly}} Hong Kong VCDs will feature Mandarin on one channel and Cantonese on the other. This is similar to selecting a language track on a DVD, except it's limited to 2 languages, due to there being only two audio channels (left and right). The audio track effectively becomes monaural.|$|E

25|$|In the mid 1980s, Zeta Music {{developed}} a prototype violin for Laurie Anderson that, through {{the employment of}} a custom pickup and a conversion module, sent MIDI data, allowing the violinist to control synthesizers. This design was later refined {{and turned into a}} commercial product. Unlike most pickup designs, the Zeta pickup has the ability to output the signal from each string on a separate <b>audio</b> <b>channel.</b> Using a multi-pin cable to their pitch to midi interface, this allows for polyphonic MIDI control with each string set to an independent MIDI channel.|$|E
25|$|Stating the {{efficiency}} of wind noise reduction is an inexact science, since the effect varies enormously with frequency, and hence with the bandwidth of the microphone and <b>audio</b> <b>channel.</b> At very low frequencies (10–100Hz) where massive wind energy exists, reductions are important to avoid overloading of the audio chain – particularly the early stages. This can produce the typical “wumping” sound associated with wind, which is often syllabic muting of the audio due to LF peak limiting. At higher frequencies – 200Hz to ~3kHz – the aural sensitivity curve allows us to hear the effect of wind as an addition to the normal noise floor, {{even though it has}} a far lower energy content. Simple shields may allow the wind noise to be 10dB less apparent; better ones can achieve nearer to a 50dB reduction. However the acoustic transparency, particularly at HF, should also be indicated, since a very high level of wind attenuation could be associated with very muffled audio.|$|E
500|$|Abbey Road {{was also}} the first and only Beatles album to be entirely {{recorded}} through a solid state transistor mixing desk, the TG12345 Mk I, as opposed to earlier thermionic valve based REDD desks. The TG console also allowed better support for eight-track multitrack recording, helping the Beatles' considerable use of overdubbing. Emerick recalls the TG desk used to record the album had individual limiters and compressors on each <b>audio</b> <b>channel</b> and noted the overall sound was [...] "softer" [...] than the earlier valve desks.|$|E

500|$|On {{the heels}} of 1984's presidential campaign, the rock group Supertramp {{featured}} spoken voice-overs from both Reagan and Bush on the right <b>audio</b> <b>channel</b> and their Democratic opponents Walter Mondale and Geraldine Ferraro on the left <b>audio</b> <b>channel</b> durning the fade-out for their song [...] "Better Days". The song's video reviews the 20th century through a retrospective montage of its hardships and the leaders who promised solution. Beginning with the Great Depression {{and the rise of}} the Third Reich, the video sequences clips of military parades and battles moving forward to atomic test and other advancements in weapons technology, to footage of President Nixon, and then Reagan as his voice can be heard saying, [...] "Our nation is poised...for greatness." [...] In a similar vein, the last minute of Def Leppard's [...] "God's of War" [...] is layered with soundbites of Reagan, Thatcher and the noises of missile launches and bombs exploding. In a departure from Cold War rhetoric, the two leaders' quotes are lifted from their justifications for the 1986 United States bombing of Libya and Britain's participation in the affair. Reagan's quotes serve as precursory marks to the War of Terror that the U.S. would lead against majority Muslim countries in the following decades. He can be heard on the track saying, [...] "A message to terrorists everywhere. You can run...but you can't hide", and, [...] "We are not going to tolerate these attacks from outlaw states", ending with, [...] "They counted on America to be passive...They counted wrong," [...] in contrast to Def Leppard's anti-war lyrics.|$|E
500|$|The {{illusion}} of sound traveling across the speakers was achieved with a device named the [...] "pan pot", which directed the predetermined movement of each <b>audio</b> <b>channel</b> with the control track. Mixing of the soundtrack required six people {{to operate the}} various pan pots in real time, while Stokowski directed each level and pan change which was marked on his musical score. To monitor recording levels, Disney used oscilloscopes with color differentiation to minimize eye fatigue. To test recording equipment and speaker systems, Disney ordered eight electronic oscillators from the newly established Hewlett-Packard company. Between the individual takes, prints, and remakes, approximately three million feet of sound film {{was used in the}} production of Fantasia. Almost a fifth of the film's budget was spent on its recording techniques.|$|E
500|$|On January 18, 1939, Stokowski {{signed an}} eighteen-month {{contract}} with Disney {{to conduct the}} remaining pieces with the Philadelphia Orchestra. Recording began that April and lasted for seven weeks at the Academy of Music, the orchestra's home which was chosen for its excellent acoustics. In the recording sessions, thirty-three microphones were placed around the orchestra that captured the music onto eight optical sound recording machines placed in the hall's basement. Each one represented an <b>audio</b> <b>channel</b> that focused on a different section of instruments: cellos and basses, violins, brass, violas, and woodwinds and tympani. The seventh channel {{was a combination of}} the first six while the eighth provided an overall sound of the orchestra at a distance. A ninth was later added to provide a click track function for the animators to time their drawings to the music. In the forty-two days of recording [...] of film was used. Disney paid all the expenses which included the musician's wages, stage personnel, a music librarian, and the orchestra's manager that cost almost $18,000. When the finished recordings arrived at the studio, a meeting was held on July 14, 1939, to allow the artists working on each segment to listen to Stokowski's arrangements, and suggest alterations in the sound to work more effectively with their designs.|$|E

2500|$|Channel 9, {{launched}} in 2004 when Microsoft's corporate reputation {{was at a}} low, was the company's first blog. It was named after the United Airlines <b>audio</b> <b>channel</b> that lets airplane passengers listen in on unfiltered conversation in the cockpit, to reflect its strategy of publishing conversations among Microsoft developers, rather than its chairman Bill Gates who had previously been the [...] "face" [...] of Microsoft.|$|E
2500|$|Loudspeakers with {{integrated}} CobraNet {{help keep}} the signal chain digital for an even longer span. [...] In a typical unpowered speaker application, the amplifier would be housed {{far away from the}} speaker, and a long speaker cable (analog) would be run between the speaker and the amplifier. The speaker cable would be subject to interference and signal loss from electrical resistance. However, a powered speaker, powered by an electrical cable and fitted with integrated CobraNet inputs, eliminates the speaker cable and replaces it with a network cable. Since a speaker will only use one <b>audio</b> <b>channel</b> out of the bundle, many speakers with CobraNet will also have a number of analog outputs {{for the rest of the}} channels in the bundle, which is useful in speaker cluster applications.|$|E
2500|$|On December 28, 2015, ESPN {{announced}} that they had reached an agreement with CBS and the NFL to provide a dedicated Spanish-language broadcast of Super Bowl 50, airing on ESPN Deportes and streaming on WatchESPN, featuring commentary and surrounding coverage in the language; unlike Fox and NBC, CBS {{does not have a}} Spanish-language cable network that could have carried such a broadcast. The production utilized CBS's video, but with Spanish-language graphics provided by ESPN, and its Monday Night Football commentary crew of Alvaro Martin, Raul Allegre, and sideline reporter John Sutcliffe. ESPN Deportes broadcast pre-game and post-game coverage, while Martin, Allegre, and Sutcliffe also contributed reports for the English-language ESPN as part of efforts to promote the simulcast. ESPN Deportes' vice president of programming Freddy Rolon felt that dedicated Spanish-language coverage appealed better to Hispanic viewers than Spanish commentary on the SAP <b>audio</b> <b>channel,</b> going on to say that [...] "I have family members who watch Spanish language television and they don't know where that SAP button is to begin with".|$|E

2500|$|A {{full-range}} {{driver is}} a speaker {{designed to be}} used alone to reproduce an <b>audio</b> <b>channel</b> {{without the help of}} other drivers, and therefore must cover the entire audio frequency range. These drivers are small, typically [...] in diameter to permit reasonable high frequency response, and carefully designed to give low-distortion output at low frequencies, though with reduced maximum output level. Full-range (or more accurately, wide-range) drivers are most commonly heard in public address systems, in televisions (although some models are suitable for hi-fi listening), small radios, intercoms, some computer speakers, etc. In hi-fi speaker systems, the use of wide-range drive units can avoid undesirable interactions between multiple drivers caused by non-coincident driver location or crossover network issues. Fans of wide-range driver hi-fi speaker systems claim a coherence of sound due to the single source and a resulting lack of interference, and likely also to the lack of crossover components. Detractors typically cite wide-range drivers' limited frequency response and modest output abilities (most especially at low frequencies), together with their requirement for large, elaborate, expensive enclosures—such as transmission lines, quarter wave resonators or horns—to approach optimum performance. With the advent of neodymium drivers, low cost quarter wave transmission lines are made possible and are increasingly made availably commercially.|$|E
