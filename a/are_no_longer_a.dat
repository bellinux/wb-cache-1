25|$|The {{main issue}} {{in dealing with}} the fossil fuel {{phase-out}} has been job loss. Companies in the fossil fuel industry have begun to experience the effects of the phasing-out of fossil fuels like coal. For example, Consol Energy, originally a coal-producing company, has begun the transition to becoming a natural gas producer. Not only does this shift affect its current role in the coal industry but it also has led to employment cuts. With the shuttering of coal plants, the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association estimates that over one million jobs will be lost. With the coal industry aging, many coal mines are deteriorating and becoming costly to keep running. As a result, coal plants <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>a</b> reliable, go-to energy source for the United States.|$|E
25|$|Early human {{settlements}} were dependent on proximity to water and, {{depending on the}} lifestyle, other natural resources used for subsistence, such as populations of animal prey for hunting and arable land for growing crops and grazing livestock. But humans have a great capacity for altering their habitats by means of technology, through irrigation, urban planning, construction, transport, manufacturing goods, deforestation and desertification, but {{human settlements}} continue to be vulnerable to natural disasters, especially those placed in hazardous locations and characterized by lack of quality of construction. Deliberate habitat alteration is often done {{with the goals of}} increasing material wealth, increasing thermal comfort, improving the amount of food available, improving aesthetics, or improving ease of access to resources or other human settlements. With the advent of large-scale trade and transport infrastructure, proximity to these resources has become unnecessary, and in many places, these factors <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>a</b> driving force behind the growth and decline of a population. Nonetheless, the manner in which a habitat is altered is often a major determinant in population change.|$|E
25|$|Obligate {{parthenogenesis}} is {{the process}} in which organisms exclusively reproduce through asexual means. Many species {{have been shown to}} transition to obligate parthenogenesis over evolutionary time. Among these species, one of the most well documented transitions to obligate parthenogenesis was found in almost all metazoan taxa, albeit through highly diverse mechanisms. These transitions often occur as a result of inbreeding or mutation within large populations. There are a number of documented species, specifically salamanders and geckos, that rely on obligate parthenogenesis as their major method of reproduction. As such, there are over 80 species of unisex reptiles (mostly lizards but including a single snake species), amphibians and fishes in nature for which males <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>a</b> part of the reproductive process. A female will produce an ovum with a full set (two sets of genes) provided solely by the mother. Thus, a male is not needed to provide sperm to fertilize the egg. This form of asexual reproduction is thought in some cases to be a serious threat to biodiversity for the subsequent lack of gene variation and potentially decreased fitness of the offspring.|$|E

Bono said he was unaware of the automatic download option. Former U2 manager Paul McGuinness thought the album had been [...] "positioned wrongly" [...] and would not have offended anyone had there been a method to opt into receiving it. Describing U2's and Apple's intentions, Bono said, [...] "We wanted to deliver a pint of milk to people's front porches, but in a few cases it ended up in their fridge, on their cereal. People were like, 'I'm dairy-free.'" [...] Although he apologized to a fan during a Facebook Q session for the album's addition to their music library, publicly he refused to offer an apology, saying, [...] "It's one of the proudest moments in U2's history." ...|$|E
