500|$|Yancey {{writes that}} Christians should be {{politically}} active and should, for example, oppose abortion, [...] "but {{you have to}} find <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> with grace... If I'm against abortion and I don't find a way to love the woman who got the abortion and even her doctor, then I don't understand the gospel." [...] Yancey recounts Jesus's Parable of the Unforgiving Servant, concluding that God is only willing to forgive us if we are willing to forgive those who have wronged us. In a similar vein, he quotes William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice: [...] "How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none?" ...|$|E
500|$|Bennington {{continued}} composing for {{the album}} while touring with Dead by Sunrise {{in support of}} their 2009 studio album Out of Ashes. He said Linkin Park was still making a concept record, stating in another interview with MTV, [...] "we might need to just make a record and still try to do a concept but figure out <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> without actually waiting another {{five or six years}} to put out a record, to try to pull off all the grandiose insanity we were thinking of doing. And we're doing that." [...] Bassist Dave [...] "Phoenix" [...] Farrell predicted the band's fans would be divided about A Thousand Suns, saying, [...] "We've known [...] going to be different, and if fans were expecting Hybrid Theory or Meteora, they're going to be surprised. It's going to take people some time to figure it out and {{know what to do with}} it." ...|$|E
500|$|All of {{the console}} {{versions}} include {{some form of}} dynamic musical score during gameplay, {{and in the case}} of the Mega Drive conversion, use arrangements of the music originating in the SNES and Apple IIGS versions. This differs from other versions which only have music for the opening and ending segments. Interplay wanted to add additional tunes by Charles Deenen. They also wanted to exchange Jean-François Freitas's music for a different soundtrack, but Chahi did not agree to the change and Delphine's lawyer helped to keep the original intro music. The Apple IIGS and Super NES versions were programmed by Rebecca Heineman, who said: [...] "Since Interplay wouldn't pay for a Super FX chip, I found <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> with static RAM on the cart and DMA which got me a great frame rate. Interplay wouldn't pay for the static RAM either, so I ended up using Fast ROM instruction. Interplay wouldn't pay for a 3.6 MHz ROM either. So, frustrated, I shoved my block move code into the DMA registers and use it as RAM running at 3.6 MHz. It worked. I got fast block moves on slow cartridges and made a game using polygons working on a 65816 with pure software rendering." [...] Another World is the only game directly ported from the Super NES to the Apple IIGS, which has the same 65C816 microprocessor.|$|E

6000|$|Now, {{in regard}} to this matter of the Dred Scott {{decision}}, I wish {{to say a word}} or two. After all, the Judge will not say whether, if a decision is made holding that the people of the States cannot exclude slavery, he will support it or not. He obstinately refuses to say what he will do in that case. The judges of the Supreme Court as obstinately refused to say what they would do on this subject. Before this I reminded him that at Galesburgh he said the judges had expressly declared the contrary, and you remember that in my Opening speech I told him I had the book containing that decision here, and I would thank him to lay his finger on the place where any such thing was said. He has occupied his hour and a half, and he has not ventured to try to sustain his assertion. He never will. But he is desirous of knowing how we are going to reverse that Dred Scott decision. Judge Douglas ought to know how. Did not he and his political friends find a way to reverse the decision of that same court in favor of the constitutionality of the National Bank? Didn't they find <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> so effectually that they have reversed it as completely as any decision ever was reversed, so far as its practical operation is concerned? ...|$|E

6000|$|So far in this {{controversy}} I can get no answer {{at all from}} Judge Douglas upon these subjects. Not one can I get from him, except that he swells himself up and says, [...] "All of us who stand by {{the decision of the}} Supreme Court are the friends of the Constitution; all you fellows that dare question it in any way are the enemies of the Constitution." [...] Now, in this very devoted adherence to this decision, in opposition to all the great political leaders whom he has recognized as leaders, in opposition to his former self and history, there is something very marked. And the manner in which he adheres to it,--not as being right upon the merits, as he conceives (because he did not discuss that at all), but as being absolutely obligatory upon every one simply because of the source from whence it comes, as that which no man can gainsay, whatever it may be,--this is another marked feature of his adherence to that decision. It marks it in this respect, that it commits him to the next decision, whenever it comes, as being as obligatory as this one, since he does not investigate it, and won't inquire whether this opinion is right or wrong. So he takes the next one without inquiring whether it is right or wrong. He teaches men this doctrine, and in so doing prepares the public mind to take the next decision when it comes, without any inquiry. In this I think I argue fairly (without questioning motives at all) that Judge Douglas is most ingeniously and powerfully preparing the public mind to take that decision when it comes; and not only so, but he is doing it in various other ways. In these general maxims about liberty, in his assertions that he [...] "don't care whether slavery is voted up or voted down,"; that [...] "whoever wants slavery has a right to have it"; that [...] "upon principles of equality it should be allowed to go everywhere"; that [...] "there is no inconsistency between free and slave institutions"--in this he is also preparing (whether purposely or not) the way for making the institution of slavery national! I repeat again, for I wish no misunderstanding, that I do not charge that he means it so; but I call upon your minds to inquire, {{if you were going to}} get the best instrument you could, and then set it to work in the most ingenious way, to prepare the public mind for this movement, operating in the free States, where there is now an abhorrence of the institution of slavery, could you find an instrument so capable of doing it as Judge Douglas, or one employed in so apt <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it?</b> ...|$|E
