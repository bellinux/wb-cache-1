5|$|The procellariids {{lack the}} {{elaborate}} breeding dances of the albatrosses, {{in no small}} part due to the tendency of most of them to attend colonies at night and breed in burrows, where visual displays <b>are</b> <b>useless.</b> The fulmarine petrels, which nest on the surface and attend their colonies diurnally, do use a repertoire of stereotyped behaviours such as cackling, preening, head waving and nibbling, but for most species courtship interactions are limited to some billing (rubbing the two bills together) in the burrow and the vocalisations made by all species. The calls serve a number of functions: they are used territorially to protect burrows or territories and to call for mates. Each call type is unique to a particular species and indeed it is possible for procellariids to identify the sex of the bird calling as well. It may also be possible to assess the quality of potential mates; a study of blue petrels found a link between the rhythm and duration of calls and the body mass of the bird. The ability of an individual to recognise its mate has also been demonstrated in several species.|$|E
5|$|The {{conventions}} of Moonlight are based, in part, on a unique mythology. Some {{parts of the}} mythology that are common include a sire, that is the vampire who turns a human into a vampire; though in the show the sire must teach him or her how to live as one. A vampire's bite {{is not enough to}} turn a human into a vampire; the human, when near death, must drink the sire's blood or have vampire blood in his or her system at the moment of death. The process of vampirization also affects their genetics, causing their DNA to be fundamentally altered to suit their bodies' new state. This makes genetic testing between vampires and their human relatives impossible unless the vampire has a sample of their own human DNA from before they were turned, such as a lock of hair. They must consume human blood to survive. They also develop psychic powers and can glimpse the future and the past. This ability, along with their night vision, is an extension of their heightened senses. Daylight does not kill vampires, but does make them progressively weaker. Silver and fire are toxic, whereas garlic, holy water and crucifixes <b>are</b> <b>useless.</b> A vampire's image cannot be captured with analogue cameras containing silver emulsion in the film; digital cameras are able to capture an image because they do not use silver emulsion. Though undead, vampires have a pulse, are not cold blooded (but still don't produce body heat as seen in episode 11 so as heat signature cameras won't see them), and cannot turn into a bat. The best ways to kill them are by decapitation or burning; a stake through the heart is painful but only causes paralysis. Moonlight vampires have many of the preternatural abilities as described in vampire mythology; they have superhuman strength and speed, they heal rapidly from any wound, they can defy gravity to a limited degree to perform parkour feats, their bite has hypnotic effects on weak-minded humans, and they are immortal. Their powers increase as they get older. Their blood has drug-like affects when consumed by humans; causing euphoria and temporarily heightened senses.|$|E

25|$|Clinical {{death that}} occurs {{unexpectedly}} {{is treated as}} a medical emergency. CPR is initiated. In a United States hospital, a Code Blue is declared and Advanced Cardiac Life Support procedures used to attempt to restart a normal heartbeat. This effort continues until either the heart is restarted, or a physician determines that continued efforts <b>are</b> <b>useless</b> and recovery is impossible. If this determination is made, the physician pronounces legal death and resuscitation efforts stop.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that the}} innate and {{adaptive}} {{portions of the}} immune system work together, not in spite of each other. The adaptive arm, B, and T cells couldn't function without the innate system' input. T cells <b>are</b> <b>useless</b> without antigen-presenting cells to activate them, and B cells are crippled without T cell help. On the other hand, the innate system would likely be overrun with pathogens without the specialized action of the adaptive immune response.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, Professor Frank Perri {{has argued}} that police {{interviews}} with Christopher Porco were seriously flawed because police questioning procedures seemingly failed to account for Porco's probable psychopathy. Psychopaths have unusual emotional responses and feel no remorse for their misdeeds, so standard police interview tactics <b>are</b> <b>useless,</b> as in the Porco case, where police failed to obtain any valuable information during questioning. According to Perri, police should study the Porco case to more productively interview potentially psychopathic suspects by using a non-confrontational approach rather than appealing to emotions.|$|E

25|$|Secondly, it {{was argued}} by Chiam See Tong, the Leader of the Opposition, that since Singapore {{practices}} representative democracy, NMPs <b>are</b> <b>useless</b> {{to the people}} as, being unelected, they have no incentive to present their views to Parliament. In other words, one should not enjoy the privilege of representing views without bearing the responsibility of serving those whom one represents. The Opposition perceived the scheme as a plan {{to make it look}} unnecessary. A similar point has been made by an academic, Chua Beng Huat, who has argued that the NMP scheme co-opts more moderate dissenting voices and is thus an attempt to de-legitimize the need for more aggressive opposition.|$|E
25|$|For a basic {{oxy-acetylene}} rig, {{the cutting}} speed in light steel section will usually be {{nearly twice as}} fast as a petrol-driven cut-off grinder. The advantages when cutting large sections are obvious: an oxy-fuel torch is light, small and quiet and needs very little effort to use, whereas a cut-off grinder is heavy and noisy and needs considerable operator exertion and may vibrate severely, leading to stiff hands and possible long-term vibration white finger. Oxy-acetylene torches can easily cut through ferrous materials in excess of 200mm (8inches). Oxygen lances are used in scrapping operations and cut sections thicker than 200mm (8inches). Cut-off grinders <b>are</b> <b>useless</b> for these kinds of application.|$|E
25|$|GPS {{compasses}} {{share the}} main advantages of gyrocompasses. They determine true North, {{as opposed to}} magnetic North, and they are unaffected by perturbations of the Earth's magnetic field. Additionally, compared with gyrocompasses, they are much cheaper, they work better in polar regions, they are less prone {{to be affected by}} mechanical vibration, and they can be initialized far more quickly. However, they depend on the functioning of, and communication with, the GPS satellites, which might be disrupted by an electronic attack or by the effects of a severe solar storm. Gyrocompasses remain in use for military purposes (especially in submarines, where magnetic and GPS compasses <b>are</b> <b>useless),</b> but have been largely superseded by GPS compasses, with magnetic backups, in civilian contexts.|$|E

Most services demand great aptitude and extensive training for Harrier pilots, as well as experience in piloting both types of aircraft. Trainee pilots are often drawn from highly experienced and skilled helicopter pilots.|$|E
500|$|As {{with its}} predecessor, Ultima Underworld II was {{designed}} to generate emergent gameplay through the interplay of simulated systems.

For example, torches burn out, items wear over time and the player character must eat. Many items in the game <b>are</b> <b>useless</b> but were included {{for the sake of}} realism. The game is nonlinear, in that players must [...] "visit and revisit" [...] areas as the character gains abilities and becomes stronger, instead of [...] "clearing each square foot as they go". Many situations and puzzles in the game have multiple solutions.|$|E

500|$|After {{the infamous}} possum [...] "Fairway Frank" [...] bites Mayor Gunderson's dog at a golf course, mayoral {{representative}} Evelyn (Judith Moreland) asks Leslie (Amy Poehler) {{to form a}} task force to capture it. Leslie, Tom (Aziz Ansari), Andy (Chris Pratt) and two incompetent animal control workers, Harris (Harris Wittels) and Brett (Colton Dunn) go to the golf course and quickly find the animal. The animal control workers <b>are</b> <b>useless</b> and Tom immediately runs away, but Andy dives toward the animal and captures it. Evelyn is impressed with Leslie and promises her a special favor from the mayor's office. However, Leslie sees a second opossum and fears they have captured the wrong animal. She later finds out that the mayor doesn't care about catching Fairway Frank, but rather about securing a trophy animal for his bathroom.|$|E
500|$|According to Schneider, Jonathan is [...] "perfectly {{willing to}} go to jail, or worse, to protect his son". The actor characterizes Jonathan as fast to lose his temper, which Schneider views as being a {{development}} of his protective nature over his family. Schneider believes that the season two episode [...] "Suspect"—where Jonathan is arrested, but his sole concern is protecting Clark's secret—summarizes the character well, and shows that the [...] "least important person in Jonathan's life is Jonathan". Schneider admits that occasionally he and Annette O'Toole have to [...] "police" [...] the creative team {{when it comes to the}} relationship between Martha, Jonathan, and Clark. According to Schneider, there are moments where they have to make sure that the characters are not taken to a place they would not normally go, specifically where the parents <b>are</b> <b>useless</b> without the [...] "innate intelligence of [...] teenager".|$|E

500|$|Christine Mitchell, {{reviewing}} the Chawton House reprint in 2010 for the Jane Austen Society of North America, [...] wrote that Eliza Smith's book [...] "met the growing {{need for a}} text to assist women with their task of maintaining a household." [...] She quotes Elizabeth Wallace's introduction as saying that it gives modern readers reason to appreciate having a refrigerator and a global food system that brings us out-of-season produce. Yet, she observes, the English housewife had many varieties of vegetables, 30 kinds of seafood and 35 kinds of poultry (including hares and rabbits). She notes that the book also describes home remedies, the housewife having to function as [...] " [...] chef, doctor, pharmacist, exterminator, chemist, laundress, and all-around handy-woman." [...] Reflecting that the recipes would [...] "probably never" [...] be used today, and the medicines <b>are</b> <b>useless,</b> the book remains invaluable for researchers, gives readers {{a glimpse into the}} world of Jane Austen and her contemporaries, and richly documents eighteenth-century English life.|$|E
500|$|On June 17, 1835, Peale {{submitted}} {{his report}} to Moore, 276 {{pages of his}} observations at the various European mints he had visited, and his comments and recommendations. He warned, [...] "in the organization of Mints in both France and England that there are offices and incumbents, that <b>are</b> <b>useless,</b> and who render no services of importance for their appointment". He recommended favorably the French practice of not appointing a coin designer, but having competitions judged jointly by Mint officers and by artists. Peale also urged {{the passage of a}} single, comprehensive Mint Act, to replace the scattered bits of legislation passed over the years; this was done in 1837. One recommendation submitted by Peale, but not adopted, was to have the Mint set up a guaranty department, to hallmark items made of gold or silver by the private sector as public assurance of their quality, as done by the Goldsmiths Company in London. He also recommended that the Philadelphia Mint strike medals, as did its French counterpart. [...] He suggested that the Mint establish a museum of coins and coining, as the Paris facility had.|$|E
500|$|Rikky Rooksby, {{author of}} The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, {{noted that the}} lyrics of [...] "Bedtime Story" [...] are an hymn to the joys of {{unconsciousness}} and {{a rejection of the}} supposed constraints of reason and language, hence the line [...] "Words <b>are</b> <b>useless,</b> especially sentences, They don't stand for anything, How could they explain how I feel?" [...] Lyrically, despite being a song about a trip to the unconscious, scholars have noticed subtexts within the song's meaning. Vicente noted that postmodernism and new age themes are prevalent within the lyrics, especially with regards to their incapability of articulating the concept of the truth, as well as the song's theme of meditation and relax. Islamic mystic and sexual themes have also been noted within the song's lyrics. Vicente further found that the cliché references to [...] "honey", [...] "longing and yearning", and the sexual connotations of being [...] "wet on the inside" [...] does not relate to [...] "secular" [...] love, but to [...] "ecstatic" [...] Sufi poetry. The lyrics allude to concepts of movement which are [...] "central" [...] to Sufi philosophy: [...] "It indicates achieving fana through sema (getting 'lost' and 'leaving logic and reason to the arms of unconsciousness')".|$|E
