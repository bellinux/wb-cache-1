The Ming court granted the Korean party gifts of fine clothes during their stay. On June 3, the officer in charge of Choe's escort notified the transport office in Beijing that three carriages plus horses and donkeys would be needed in the journey to the Korean border; when these were granted in the morning, the party swiftly departed from Beijing.

On 1 July, Mocenigo attacked the Ottoman ships at Gallipoli, but although he led his flagship {{to break through the}} palisade protecting the Ottoman anchorage, the other Venetian vessels did not follow, forcing Mocenigo to withdraw with heavy casualties. Even now, however, Venice would not commit its full force to the conflict: when Suriano, as a proponent of the hawkish faction, proposed to arm a fleet of 14 ships and engage in a more decisive policy against the Ottomans in January 1430, the proposal was voted down, even though it was rather modest and clearly inadequate to force the Sultan to come to terms. Instead, the Great Council instructed the new captain-general, Silvestro Morosini, to seek the mediation of the Byzantine Emperor for a settlement on the lines of the previous agreements.|$|E

It is universal because it subsumes Amdahl's law and Gustafson linearized scaling as special cases.

25|$|Despite the {{polished}} and complex {{nature of the}} Aeneid (legend stating that Virgil wrote only three lines of the poem each day), the number of half-complete lines and the abrupt ending are generally seen as evidence that Virgil died before he could finish the work. Because this poem was composed and preserved in writing rather than orally, the Aeneid is more complete than most classical epics. Furthermore, {{it is possible to}} debate whether Virgil intended to rewrite and add to such lines. Some of them would be difficult to complete, and in some instances, the brevity of a line increases its dramatic impact (some arguing the violent ending as a typically Virgilian comment on the darker, vengeful side of humanity). However, these arguments may be anachronistic—half-finished lines might equally, to Roman readers, have been <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> an unfinished poem and have added nothing whatsoever to the dramatic effect.|$|E

Further problems were also noticed in the onset detection, where for many notes seen to be active in the output trancription an onset was not detected.

500|$|The first <b>indications</b> <b>of</b> compartmental {{structure}} {{came from}} studies of the receptive fields of cells {{in various parts of}} the cerebellar cortex.

The stripes generated by zebrins and other compartmentalization markers are oriented perpendicular to the cerebellar folds—that is, they are narrow in the mediolateral direction, but much more extended in the longitudinal direction. Different markers generate different sets of stripes, the widths and lengths vary as a function of location, but they all have the same general shape.|$|R

The tank had a level gauge that employees used to monitor the level manually, and an independent high-level switch which would shut off inflow if the level got above a certain setpoint. On Tank 912, the manual gauge was stuck and the independent shut-off switch was inoperative, meaning that the tank was being [...] "filled blind" [...] with petrol (i.e., being filled without <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> the level).

[...] The bill died without a vote in August, when more critical matters arose to occupy Parliament. [...] When Charles went to Scotland to rally Scottish forces to the royalist cause, the Commons began drafting what became known as the Grand Remonstrance. [...] Many historians have claimed Vane had a role in drafting some of its language; this matter is disputed, but either way Vane did not participate in the debate. [...] Narrowly passed by the Commons in November 1641, the document catalogued many grievances against the king and church, and served to further polarize political affairs.
