25|$|This {{meant that}} the Cuban nation was still {{technically}} a member state, but that the current government was denied the right of representation and <b>attendance</b> <b>at</b> <b>meetings</b> and of participation in activities. The OAS's position was that although Cuba's participation was suspended, its obligations under the Charter, the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man, etc. still hold: for instance, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights continued to publish reports on Cuba's human rights situation and to hear individual cases involving Cuban nationals. However, this stance was occasionally questioned by other individual member states.|$|E
25|$|By 1880, {{the members}} of the X Club had {{prominent}} positions within the scientific community, and the club was highly regarded, but it was beginning to fall apart. In 1883, Spottiswoode died of typhoid and at the same time, according to Spencer, only two of the remaining eight members of the X club were in good health. <b>Attendance</b> <b>at</b> <b>meetings</b> began to dwindle and by 1885, Frankland and Lubbock urged for the election of new members. There was a difference of opinion on the matter and it was eventually dropped. In 1889, a rift emerged in the group when Huxley and Spencer had an argument over land nationalisation policies and refused to talk with one another.|$|E

2500|$|In 1951, the {{president}} and vice-president of the Dutch COC initiated an International Congress of European homophile groups, {{which resulted in the}} formation of the International Committee for Sexual Equality (ICSE). [...] The ICSE brought together, among other groups, the Forbundet of 1948 (Scandinavia), the Riksförbundet för Sexuellt Likaberättigande (Sweden), Arcadie (France), Der Kreis (Swiss), and, later, ONE (U.S.A.). [...] Historian Leila Rupp describes the ICSE as a classic example of transnational organizing; [...] "It created a network across national borders, nurtured a transnational homophile identity, and engaged in activism designed to change both laws and minds." [...] However, the ICSE failed to last beyond the early 1960s due to poor <b>attendance</b> <b>at</b> <b>meetings,</b> lack of active leaders, and failure of members to pay dues.|$|E
2500|$|Less {{than three}} weeks after his arrival, Wallace-Johnson opened the first branch of the WAYL in Sierra Leone. The league was an instant success and greatly {{exceeded}} Wallace-Johnson's own expectations. The league organised public gatherings, established the African Standard newspaper, founded trade unions and contested local elections. Its program included equality for women, unity for people of all tribes, co-operation between the Sierra Leone colony and protectorate, and higher wages for workers. Wallace-Johnson claimed a membership of 25,000 in the colony and 17,000 in the protectorate, although these figures {{are believed to be}} exaggerated, according to [...] The Freetown chapter held biweekly meetings at Wilberforce Memorial Hall where Wallace-Johnson exercised his oratorical skill and urged mass support for the League's initiatives. The government downplayed the immense popularity of the WAYL, believing that the massive <b>attendance</b> <b>at</b> <b>meetings</b> was due to the [...] "entertainment value" [...] of speeches.

2500|$|Membership in the Lions Club is by [...] "invitation only" [...] as {{mandated}} by its constitution and by-laws. All member applicants need a sponsor {{who is an}} active member and of good standing in the club they intend to join.

Acceptance of membership is still subject to the approval {{of the majority of the}} club's board of directors. Several clubs are even difficult for applicants to join in.

2500|$|Open Brethren {{assemblies}} {{have traditionally}} rejected {{the concept of}} anyone [...] "joining" [...] {{as a member of}} a particular local gathering of believers and the maintenance of any list of such members. Brethren emphasise the Christian doctrine of the one [...] "Church" [...] made up of all true believers and enumerated in Heaven in [...] "Lamb's Book of Life", rather than by humans. However, as a practical matter, in the late 20th century many American assemblies began maintaining lists of those in regular <b>attendance</b> <b>at</b> <b>meetings.</b> This was often to comply with secular governance issues or to offer a directory of attendees for internal use. The Open Brethren emphasise that meeting attendance for the nonbeliever has no direct spiritual benefit (though it is hoped the individual may be influenced to convert). Nonbelievers are not to partake of the [...] "Breaking of Bread", though this proves generally difficult to enforce in larger assemblies. Regardless, regular attendance for believers is felt to be an act of obedience to the New Testament command that they should not neglect the assembling of themselves together. Despite the Brethren's rejection of the term 'member', many observers use the term to refer to those who attend meetings. Visiting brethren have traditionally been expected to bring a [...] "letter of commendation" [...] from their [...] "home assembly", assuring the group they are visiting that they are in fellowship and not under any form of discipline. This practice is somewhat less common today than in years past, however.|$|E
2500|$|The party {{over which}} the politburo held sway was not a mass party but, comporting with Leninist tradition, a smaller {{selective}} party of between three percent (e.g., Albania) and fourteen percent (e.g., Czechoslovakia) of the country's population who had accepted total obedience. [...] For example, a Polish communist described faith in the Polish United Workers' Party as that it [...] "means that his faith in it is uncritical at every stage, {{no matter what the}} party is saying. [...] It is a person with the ability to adapt his mentality and his conscience {{in such a way that}} he can unreservedly accept the dogma that the party is never wrong, even though it is wrong all the time." [...] Entry usually required a period of probation. [...] Those who secured membership in this selective party received considerable rewards, such as access to special lower priced shops with a greater selection of goods, special schools, holiday facilities, cinemas, homes, furniture, works of art and official cars with special white license plates (instead of the usual black plates) so that police and others could identify these members from a distance. Envelopes containing banknotes, and sometimes foreign hard currency, were not infrequently passed out to certain party or politburo members. [...] After the confiscation through nationalizations from prior owners following Soviet occupation, the party at first possessed considerable additional property and real estate to give members. [...] All members possessed a party card or book in which were recorded <b>attendance</b> <b>at</b> <b>meetings,</b> service to the party and any deviation from party conduct. Periodically, these cards would be inspected, frequently as a prelude to a culling or purge of those considered undesirable or insufficiently committed.|$|E

Executive directors have not been held to account. Recent preoccupations of the corporate governance community have not helped.

6000|$|Now I come to {{the subject}} of the disorders. I am {{extremely}} sorry to say that some disorder has broken out in the Punjab. I think I may assume that the House is aware of the general circumstances from Answers to Questions. Under the Regulation of 1818 (which is still alive), coercive measures were adopted. Here I would like to examine, so far as I can, the action taken to preserve the public interests. It would be quite wrong, in dealing with the unrest in the Punjab, not to mention the circumstances that provided the fuel for the agitation. There were ravages by the plague, and these ravages have been cruel. The seasons have not been favourable. A third cause was an Act then on the stocks, which was believed to be injurious to the condition of a large body of men. Those conditions affecting the Colonisation Act were greatly misrepresented. An Indian member of the Punjab Council pointed out how impolitic he thought it was; and, as I told the House about a week ago, the Viceroy, declining to be frightened by the foolish charge of pandering to agitation and so forth, refused assent to that proposal. But in the meantime the proposal of the colonisation law had become a weapon {{in the hands of the}} preachers of sedition. I suspect that the Member for East Nottingham will presently get up and say that this mischief connected with the Colonisation Act accounted for the disturbance. But I call attention to this fact, in order that the House may understand whether or not the Colonisation Act was the main cause of the disturbance. The authorities believe that it was not. There were twenty-eight meetings known to have been held by the leading agitators in the Punjab between 1st March, and 1st May. Of these five only related, even ostensibly, to agricultural grievances; the remaining twenty-three were all purely political. The figures seem to dispose of the contention that agrarian questions are at the root of the present unrest in the Punjab. On the contrary, it rather looks as if there was a deliberate heating of the public atmosphere preparatory to the agrarian meeting at Rawalpindi on the 21st April, which gave rise to the troubles. The Lieutenant-Governor visited twenty-seven out of twenty-nine districts. He said the situation was serious, and it was growing worse. In this agitation special attention, it is stated, has been paid to the Sikhs, who, as the House is aware, are among the best soldiers in India, and in the case of Lyallpur, to the military pensioners. Special efforts have been made to secure their <b>attendance</b> <b>at</b> <b>meetings</b> to enlist their sympathies and to inflame their passions. So far the active agitation has been virtually confined to the districts in which the Sikh element is predominant. Printed invitations and leaflets have been principally addressed to villages held by Sikhs; and at a public meeting at Ferozepore, at which disaffection was openly preached, the men of the Sikh regiments stationed there were specially invited to attend, and several hundreds of them acted upon the invitation. The Sikhs were told that it was by their aid, and owing to their willingness to shoot down their fellow countrymen in the Mutiny, that the Englishmen retained their hold upon India. And then a particularly odious line of appeal was adopted. It was asked, [...] "How is it that the plague attacks the Indians and not the Europeans?" [...] "The Government," [...] said these men, [...] "have mysterious means of spreading the plague; the Government spreads the plague by poisoning the streams and wells." [...] In some villages the inhabitants have actually ceased to use the wells. I was informed only the other day by an officer, who was in the Punjab at that moment, that when visiting the settlements, he found the villagers disturbed in mind on this point. He said to his men: [...] "Open up your kits, and let them see whether these horrible pills are in them." [...] The men did as they were ordered, but the suspicion was so great that people insisted upon the glasses of the telescopes being unscrewed, in order to be quite sure that there was no pill behind them.|$|E
