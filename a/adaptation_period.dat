2500|$|Bicycle cranks {{can vary}} in length to {{accommodate}} different sized riders and {{different types of}} cycling. Crank length is measured {{from the center of}} the pedal spindle to the center of the bottom bracket spindle or axle. The larger bicycle component manufacturers typically offer crank lengths for adult riders from 165mm to 180mm long in 2.5mm increments, with 170mm cranks being the most common size. A few small specialty manufacturers make bicycle cranks in a number of sizes smaller than 165mm and longer than 180mm. Some manufacturers also make bicycle cranks that can be adjusted to different lengths. While logic would suggest that, all other things being equal, riders with shorter legs should use proportionally shorter cranks and those with longer legs should use proportionally longer cranks, this is not universally accepted. However, very few scientific studies have definitively examined the effect of crank length on sustained cycling performance and the studies' results have been mixed. Bicycle crank length has not been easy to study scientifically for a number of reasons, chief among them being that cyclists are able to physiologically adapt to different crank lengths. Cyclists are typically more efficient pedalling cranks with which they have had an <b>adaptation</b> <b>period.</b> Several different formulas exist to calculate appropriate crank length for various riders. In addition to the rider's size, another factor affecting the selection of crank length is the rider's cycling specialty and the type of cycling event. Historically, bicycle riders have typically chosen proportionally shorter cranks for higher cadence cycling such as criterium and track racing, while riders have chosen proportionally longer cranks for lower cadence cycling such as time trial racing and mountain biking. However, the evolution of very low rider torso positions to reduce aerodynamic drag for time trial racing and triathlon cycling can also affect crank selection for such events. Some have suggested that proportionally shorter cranks may have a slight advantage for a rider with a very low torso position and an actute hip angle, especially as the rider pedals near the top-dead-center position of the pedal stroke. Cranks can be shortened for medical reasons using shorteners such as Ortho Pedal ...|$|E

40|$|For echo {{cancelation}} {{enhanced by}} a Post-Filter {{it is necessary}} to get a reliable estimate of the (residual) echo power spectral density (PSD). We describe a method to obtain the echo PSD by an estimation of the system misalignment. For room impulse responses longer than the DFTlength a partitioned processing is necessary. Our contribution addresses problems concerning the partitioned calculation of the system misalignment and proposes an algorithm for obtaining the system misalignment by an optimal frequency dependent first order recursive smoothing criteria based on a minimum mean squared error (MMSE) approach. The main drawback of a conventional AEC (a time domain NLMS-algorithm, e. g.) is slow convergence during <b>adaptation</b> <b>periods</b> such as filter initialization or sudden changes in the RIR. A Post-Filter P(m,l) (designed according to the Wiener-rule) permits the application of shorter AEC-filters. The residual echo Ξ(m,l) - which remains after the AEC- is estimated and attenuated. Since for the Post-Filter {{as well as for the}} AEC it is necessary that the near speaker is absent during <b>adaptation</b> <b>periods,</b> a double-talk detector has to stop the adaptation in the case of an active near speaker. This can be done with the help of minimum statistics [5, 6] or the coherence between loudspeaker- and microphone-channel [7], e. g. 1...|$|R

5000|$|Wallach and Kravitz {{devised a}} {{mechanical}} apparatus that enabled head movements to cause displacements {{of an image}} by any desired percentage {{of the extent of}} that head movement, and discovered that subjects could detect deviations of as little as 2% from the normal degree of displacement. This showed that a highly accurate compensating process corrects for the image displacement that normally accompanies a head movement, thus yielding an appearance of stability. Wallach called this process constancy of visual direction (CVD), and he noted with interest that it could be easily modified through perceptual adaptation. To demonstrate this, Wallach & Kravitz set the apparatus so that during head movements the visual image moved by 150% of what would be the normal displacement, and had subjects turn their heads back and forth watching this altered displacement for 10 minutes. After this brief <b>adaptation</b> <b>period,</b> subjects were shown an objectively stationary target as they turned their heads.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that {{prolonged}} exposure to a human face leads to shape-selective visual aftereffects.

However, FAE is also detected, to a smaller degree, at other retinal positions in a spatially invariant way and this component depends less on the adaptation duration.
