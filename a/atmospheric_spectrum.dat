Recent laboratory investigations have been devoted to the methane spectroscopic parameters in this band, motivated by their previous poor knowledge and their increasing use by remote sensing experiments. In {{the absence of a}} better model, previous studies have used Voigt line shapes and thus purposely neglected line mixing (LM). In this paper, we first present direct comparisons between measured laboratory spectra and the results of a model which accounts for LM without adjusting any of the spectroscopic parameters. A good agreement is obtained and the results show that LM does have a significant influence on the shapes of P and R manifolds. Hence, most previously observed discrepancies were not due to improper broadening and shifting coefficients but to the neglect of this effect. This also confirms that widths and shifts derived in recent 2 Î½_ 3 band studies neglecting LM are âeffectiveâ and lack physical meaning, as suggested in a previous work [17] (Frankenberg et al., 2008). In a second step, the conclusions from the laboratory data are tested using ground-based <b>atmospheric</b> solar absorption <b>spectra.</b> The fit residuals obtained confirm the quality of the proposed model and evidence the impact of line mixing on CH_ 4 <b>atmospheric</b> <b>spectra.</b> The present results also confirm that laboratory and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>spectra</b> can alternatively be accurately modeled neglecting LM and using ad hoc broadening and shifting parameters. Conclusions of this exercise can be drawn from two perspectives. From {{the point of view of}} spectroscopy and understanding of processes, accurate line parameters will not be deduced from fits of laboratory measurements unless line-mixing effects are included in the spectral-shape model. In the meantime, and from the point of view of atmospheric retrievals, neglecting LM with suitable effective line parameters is convenient and accurate (within current retrieval uncertainties).
