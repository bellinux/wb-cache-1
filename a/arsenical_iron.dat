The {{most important}} non-metallic materials are: quartz, calcareous spar (calcite), heavy spar (baryte) and fluorspar (fluorite).|$|E
50|$|Peter Bostock {{was among}} several licensees {{in this area}} of Manchester who were {{suspected}} of unknowingly selling adulterated beer in 1900. The poisoned beer resulted in outbreaks of peripheral neuritis caused by arsenic poisoning that was traced by the Royal Commission to the raw materials found in brewing sugars at a refiners in Liverpool called Bostock & Co. of Garston (not thought to be a relation of the licensee). The company used a process involving sulphuric acid (made from <b>arsenical</b> <b>iron</b> pyrites) to manufacture glucose. Upon these findings, the Royal Commission recommended that 'a legal maximum of not more than one-hundredth of a grain of arsenic per gallon of liquid per pound of solid food be enforced'. By this point the damage had been done and up to four grains of arsenic were being found per pound of brewing sugar. The beer scare of 1900 has been mentioned in various articles on medical science, such as the Journal of the American Medical Association, where it was stated that over 2,000 people received medical treatment for peripheral neuritis. It is widely believed that the scare affected 6,000 people and killed 70.|$|E
6000|$|... 440. The proto-sulphuret of iron, {{the native}} per-sulphuret of <b>iron,</b> <b>arsenical</b> sulphuret of <b>iron,</b> native yellow sulphuret of copper and iron, grey {{artificial}} sulphuret of copper, artificial sulphuret of bismuth, and artificial grey sulphuret of tin, all conduct the voltaic battery current when cold, more or less, some giving sparks like the metals, others not being sufficient for that high effect. They {{did not seem}} to conduct better when heated, than before; but I had not time to enter accurately into the investigation of this point. Almost all of them became much heated by the transmission of the current, and present some very interesting phenomena in that respect. The sulphuret of antimony does not conduct the same current sensibly either hot or cold, but is amongst those bodies acquiring conducting power when fused (402.). The sulphuret of silver and perhaps some others decompose whilst in the solid state; but the phenomena of this decomposition will be reserved for its proper place in the next series of these Researches.|$|R
40|$|Arsenic is an {{inconvenient}} impurity for copper smelters and its problematic its bound to worsen as concentrates become dirtier. Air emissions are prevented during the off-gas treatment so it deports to liquid effluents and dusts. From effluents it cannot be removed easily {{together with other}} metals and specific removal needs to be considered. At industrial level the preferred choice is precipitation and copper smelters thus seek precipitates that are safe enough for inexpensive landfill disposal. The literature review identified the most common methods used by industry {{as well as more}} novel proposals to remove arsenic from solution. When precipitates or other types of solids are still too hazardous for safe disposal, it is possible to stabilise them with other methods discussed. The experimental work tested one solid stabilisation approach, vitrification, on hazardous copper smelter waste. Next, after producing an arsenic bearing solution similar to copper smelter effluents by leaching the same waste, five precipitation methods were tested: high <b>iron</b> <b>arsenical</b> ferrihydrite, a two-step process using aluminium and iron, arsenate hydroxyapatite, gypsum seeded scorodite and ferrous arsenate (symplesite). The short term leaching behaviour of the solids was tested with 24 hour bottle tests performed at different pH conditions. The results showed that all methods produced solids somewhat safer than the original one, but only the symplesite and two step precipitation methods have resulted in solids safe enough for landfill disposal. A preliminary cost estimation shows that these methods could be competitive with existing processes, while producing a safer solid. Regarding vitrification of the current waste, even though the particular conditions of the test were unable to produce a safe enough solid, the waste proved amenable to the process...|$|R
