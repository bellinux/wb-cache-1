50|$|The {{angle is}} {{the angle of}} the wind or tide as it {{presents}} itself relative to the ship or aircraft, so if the wind is coming from the left <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>relative</b> <b>angle</b> of 30°, we use a sine of 0.5. Once the sine has been estimated, the drift due to wind or tide can be estimated accordingly by resolving the velocity of the wind or tide into a forward component and a sideways component. The sideways component is the windspeed x the sine, and the forward component is (1 - the sine) x windspeed (i.e. the cosine). Naturally we must apply these corrections to our groundspeed in the appropriate direction according to logic - a wind from the left will blow us off course in that direction; a headwind will slow our progress, a tailwind will increase it. Converting this back to a heading correction can be done using the 1 in 60 rule.|$|E

40|$|The outer solar atmosphere, i. e., {{the corona}} and the chromosphere, {{is replete with}} small energy-release events, which are {{accompanied}} by transient brightening and jet-like ejections. These events {{are considered to be}} magnetic reconnection events in the solar plasma, and their dynamics have been studied using recent advanced observations from the Hinode spacecraft and other observatories in space and on the ground. These events occur at different locations in the solar atmosphere, and vary in their morphology and amount of the released energy. The magnetic field configurations of these reconnection events are inferred based on observations of magnetic fields at the photospheric level. Observations suggest that these magnetic configurations can be classified into two groups. In the first group, two anti-parallel magnetic fields reconnect to each other, yielding a 2 D emerging flux configuration. In the second group, helical or twisted magnetic flux tubes are parallel or <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>relative</b> <b>angle</b> to each other. Reconnection can occur only between anti-parallel components of the magnetic flux tubes and may be referred to as component reconnection. The latter configuration type may be more important for the larger class of small-scale reconnection events. The two types of magnetic configurations can be compared to counter-helicity and co-helicity configurations, respectively, in laboratory plasma collision experiments.

40|$|PURPOSE: Astigmatic {{subjects}} are adapted to their astigmatism and perceptually recalibrate upon its correction. However, {{the extent to}} which prior adaptation to astigmatism affects visual performance, whether this effect is axis dependent, and the time scale of potential changes in visual performance after astigmatism correction are not known. Moreover, the effect of possible positive interactions of aberrations (astigmatism and coma) might be altered after recalibration to correction of astigmatism. METHODS: Visual acuity (VA) was measured in 25 subjects (astigmats and non-astigmats, corrected and uncorrected) under induction of astigmatism and combinations of astigmatism and coma while controlling subject aberrations. Astigmatism (1. 00 diopter) was induced at three different orientations, the natural axis, the perpendicular orientation, and 45 degrees for astigmats and at 0, 90, and 45 degrees for non-astigmats. Experiments were also performed, adding coma (0. 41 μm <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>relative</b> <b>angle</b> of 45 degrees) to the same mentioned astigmatism. Fourteen different conditions were measured using an 8 -Alternative Forced Choice procedure with Tumbling E letters and a QUEST algorithm. Longitudinal measurements were performed up to 6 months. Uncorrected astigmats were provided with proper astigmatic correction after the first session. RESULTS: In non-astigmats, inducing astigmatism at 90 degrees, produced a statistically lower reduction in VA than at 0 or 45 degrees, whereas in astigmats, the lower decrease in VA occurred for astigmatism induced at the natural axis. Six months of astigmatic correction did not reduce the insensitivity to astigmatic induction along the natural axis. Differences after orientation of astigmatism were also found when adding coma to astigmatism. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of astigmatism on VA is greatly dependent on the orientation of the induced astigmatism, even in non-astigmats. Previous experience to astigmatism plays a significant role on VA, with a strong bias toward the natural axis. In contrast to perceived isotropy, the correction of astigmatism does not shift the bias in VA from the natural axis of astigmatism. © American Academy of Optometry. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

Our algorithm still seems {{to stay in the}} framework of the original DLA model. We present an accurate estimate of the fractal dimensions based on the data for a hundred clusters with 50 million particles each. We find that multiscaling cannot be ruled out. We also find that the fractal dimension is a weak self-averaging quantity. In addition, the fractal dimension, if calculated using the harmonic measure, is a nonmonotonic function of the cluster radius. We argue that the controversies in the data interpretation can be due to the weak self-averaging and the influence of intrinsic noise. Comment: 8 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
