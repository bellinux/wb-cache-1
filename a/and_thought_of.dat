5|$|The {{two sides}} {{eventually}} {{tired of the}} war and both agreed to meet to establish a truce. After doing so, they exchanged hostages. Vanaland is described as having sent to Asaland its best men: Njörðr—described as wealthy—and his son Freyr in exchange for Asaland's Hœnir—described here as large, handsome, <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> by the people of Vanaland well suited to be a chieftain. Additionally, Asaland sends Mímir—a man of great understanding—in exchange for Kvasir, who Snorri describes as the wisest man of Vanaland.|$|E
5|$|Long epic poetry was not {{a popular}} genre in North Korea before Mt. Paektu, {{but it was in}} the Soviet Union where Cho had immigrated from. Poema and Mayakovsky's prosody and poetry were also among Cho's {{influences}} that can be seen in Mt. Paektu. These Russian stylistic influences gave Mt. Paektu its peculiar characteristics that prompted mixed reactions from the North Korean public. For instance, some in the literature circles were unfamiliar with the concept of a lyrical epic <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> it as an improbable amalgam of genres, criticizing the work for being indistinguishable from ordinary prose. According to North Korean studies scholar Alzo David-West, the relatively favorable reaction to Mt. Paektu compared to some other literature testifies to North Korean readership being capable at being both a receptive and a dismissive audience.|$|E

25|$|For Bourdieu, habitus {{and field}} can only exist in {{relation}} to each other.

25|$|As Piaget {{developed}} {{new research}} methods, {{he wrote a}} book called The Language <b>and</b> <b>Thought</b> <b>of</b> the Child, which aimed to synthesize the methods he was using in order to study the conclusion children drew from situations and how they arrived to such conclusion. The main idea was to observe how children responded and articulated certain situations with their own reasoning, in order to examine their thought processes (Mayer, 2005).|$|E
25|$|It is, however, a {{generally}} ill-defined ideology; different, and sometimes contradictory sentiments {{are expressed in}} the name of Peronism. Today, the legacy <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> Perón have transcended the confines of any single political party and bled into the broader political landscape of Argentina, therefore Peronists are usually described as a political movement. Traditionally the Peronist movement has drawn its strongest support from the working class and sympathetic unions, and has been characterized as proletarian in nature.|$|E

However, they were unaware that such a devotion was already in existence, albeit at a local level. The movement, supported by the Archbishop of Milan, decided to place a statue in the Italian Dolomites, in the hydrological centre of Europe, since it was the watershed separating the basins of the Rhine, the Danube and the Po.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Elisha Gray {{was also}} experimenting with {{acoustic}} telegraphy <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> {{a way to}} transmit speech using a water transmitter. On February 14, 1876, Gray filed a caveat with the U.S. Patent Office for a telephone design that used a water transmitter. That same morning, Bell's lawyer filed Bell's application with the patent office. There is considerable debate about who arrived first and Gray later challenged the primacy of Bell's patent. Bell was in Boston on February 14 and did not arrive in Washington until February 26.|$|E
25|$|A notable {{piece of}} work {{translated}} into English is the Wen Xuan, an anthology representative of major works of Chinese literature. Translating this work requires a high knowledge of the genres presented in the book, such as poetic forms, various prose types including memorials, letters, proclamations, praise poems, edicts, and historical, philosophical and political disquisitions, threnodies and laments for the dead, and examination essays. Thus the literary translator must {{be familiar with the}} writings, lives, <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> a large number of its 130 authors, making the Wen Xuan {{one of the most difficult}} literary works to translate.|$|E

The Starr Mansion, named after its builder, Abraham Dubois Starr, sits on top of a hill and offers panoramic views of the city of Vallejo, the waterways of the Napa River, Mare Island and the picturesque hills to the east. The beautiful, unique architecture is Second Empire Italianate <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> as Vallejo's diamond. Now a bed and breakfast that lodges and caters to tourists and business visitors, the mansion is filled with furniture and accessories of the period. The two adjoining parlors have matching Italian marble fireplaces and breath-taking unique gold leaf light fixtures original to the structure.|$|E
25|$|Racism {{rests on}} two basic assumptions: that a {{correlation}} exists between physical characteristics and moral qualities; that mankind is divisible into superior and inferior stocks. Racism, thus defined, {{is a modern}} conception, for prior to the XVIth century there was virtually nothing in the life <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> the West that {{can be described as}} racist. To prevent misunderstanding a clear distinction must be made between racism and ethnocentrism... The Ancient Hebrews, in referring to all who were not Hebrews as Gentiles, were indulging in ethnocentrism, not in racism.... So it was with the Hellenes who denominated all non-Hellenes—whether the wild Scythians or the Egyptians whom they acknowledged as their mentors in the arts of civilization—Barbarians, the term denoting that which was strange or foreign.|$|E
25|$|Smith {{considers}} {{his treatment}} of Vagrant Story and Final Fantasy XII among his best translations. He looks to Vagrant Story as a title that demands to be in English <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> his work as revealing the inner English game that always existed underneath. Smith was able to speak directly with Matsuno to improve the script translation, marking the first of their many collaborations. For Final Fantasy XII, his role entailed rebuilding the world to make sense for an English-speaking audience. He chose to portray the Archadian Imperials with a British accent to distinguish them from the American-accented Resistance members. For both of these titles, Smith relied on Matsuno's dense notes on the world's backstory to capture subtle and implied connections and preserve the rich texture of the game.|$|E
