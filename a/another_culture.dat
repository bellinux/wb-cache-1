5|$|Sometimes food {{not found}} in its {{original}} culture is assimilated into another; for example, Chinese restaurants in Malaysia often serve Malay dishes. Food from one culture is sometimes also cooked using styles taken from <b>another</b> <b>culture,</b> For example, sambal belacan (shrimp paste) are commonly used as ingredients by Chinese restaurants to create the stir fried water spinach (kangkung belacan). This means that although much of Malaysian food {{can be traced back}} to a certain culture, they have their own identity. Rice is popular in many dishes. Chili is commonly found in local cuisine, although this does not necessarily make them spicy.|$|E
5|$|No. There’s {{always going}} to be two sides to {{everything}}. For me, everything that I did with the Harajuku Girls was just a pure compliment and being a fan. You can’t be a fan of somebody else? Or <b>another</b> <b>culture?</b> Of course you can. Of course you can celebrate other cultures. That’s what Japanese culture and American culture have done. It’s like I say in the song: it’s a ping-pong match. We do something American, they take it and they flip it and make it so Japanese and so cool. And we take it back and go, “Whoa, that’s so cool!” That’s so beautiful. It’s a beautiful thing in the world, how our cultures come together. I don’t feel like I did anything but share that love. You can look at it from a negative point of view if you want to, but get off my cloud. Because, seriously, that was all meant out of love.|$|E

25|$|Although Boas {{was making}} a very {{specific}} contribution to the methods of descriptive linguistics, his ultimate point is far reaching: observer bias need not be personal, it can be cultural. In other words, the perceptual categories of Western researchers may systematically cause a Westerner to misperceive or to fail to perceive entirely a meaningful element in <b>another</b> <b>culture.</b> As in his critique of Otis Mason's museum displays, Boas demonstrated that {{what appeared to be}} evidence of cultural evolution was really the consequence of unscientific methods, and a reflection of Westerners' beliefs about their own cultural superiority. This point provides the methodological foundation for Boas's cultural relativism: elements of a culture are meaningful in that culture's terms, even if they may be meaningless (or take on a radically different meaning) in <b>another</b> <b>culture.</b>|$|E

40|$|Intercultural {{competency}} plays {{a pivotal}} role in creating a more equitable and just marketplace where situations of marketplace vulnerability are minimized and resiliency is enhanced. Intercultural competency is the ability to understand, adapt, and accommodate <b>another’s</b> <b>culture.</b> In this essay, a framework of intercultural competency development in multicultural marketplaces is presented. Resilience building actions for multicultural marketplace actors, specifically, consumers, businesses/marketers, community groups and NGOs, and policy makers, are discussed for three phases of intercultural competency development...|$|R
40|$|Cultural {{competency}} {{has proven}} less effective than its proponents had envisioned. Disciplines {{outside of the}} law (social work, health and psychology) have turned to the more powerful theory of ‘cultural humility’ - a framework for lifelong learning and self-reflection.

25|$|Sahagún {{was among}} the first to develop methods and {{strategies}} for gathering and validating knowledge of indigenous New World cultures. Much later, the scientific discipline of anthropology would formalize the methods of ethnography as a scientific research strategy for documenting the beliefs, behavior, social roles and relationships, and worldview of <b>another</b> <b>culture,</b> and for explaining these factors with reference to the logic of that culture. His research methods and strategies for validating information provided by his informants are precursors of the methods and strategies of modern ethnography.|$|E
25|$|We do not {{understand}} exactly how Renaissance artists thought about the Oriental carpets they were depicting. We know that the Venetian Piazza San Marco was adorned with carpets hanging from {{the windows of the}} surrounding palaces and houses on special occasions. Like the beautiful ladies looking out of the windows, the carpets function as a decorative framework, and highlight the important action which is going on.

25|$|Sometimes food {{not found}} in its {{original}} culture is assimilated into another; for example, Chinese restaurants in Malaysia often serve Malaysian dishes. Food from one culture is sometimes cooked using styles taken from another. This means that although many Malaysian dishes originate from <b>another</b> <b>culture,</b> {{they have their own}} identities. Often the food in Malaysia is different from the original dishes; for example, Chinese food is often sweeter in Malaysian versions than the original. The Peranakans, Chinese who moved to Malaysia centuries ago, have their own unique cuisine that Chinese cooking techniques with Malay ingredients.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show how the rigid social {{structures}} in which both Muslim and Christian women found themselves in the middle ages prevented them from influencing the Christian-Muslim polemics of the time. The absence of women’s voices has left modern scholars unsure of their sentiments regarding their encounters with one another and with one <b>another’s</b> <b>culture.</b> In order to get an accurate account of such cross-cultural perceptions as those which may have formed between Muslims and Christians, it is necessary to hear the arguments and observations from all sides, including women and others who may have been socially oppressed...|$|R

25|$|Many Mississippian {{ceramics}} {{are decorated}} by incising or engraving. Implements such as sticks, reeds, or bone fragments, were dragged through wet clay to incise it, {{or they were}} scratched into {{the surface of the}} dried but as yet unfired pieces to engrave. Sharpened reeds or fingernails were also used to punch small marks. Ornate designs and motifs are common decorative elements, which archaeologists use to track the spread of influences from one culture onto <b>another</b> <b>culture.</b> Many of the designs have symbolic meanings, usually associated with aspects of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex.|$|E
25|$|Traces of the Copper Age (Chalcolithic era) in Austria were {{identified}} in the Carpathian Basin hoard at Stollhof, Hohe Wand, Lower Austria. Hilltop settlements from this era are common in eastern Austria. During this time the inhabitants sought out and developed raw materials in the central Alpine areas. The most important find {{is considered to be}} the Iceman Ötzi a well-preserved mummy of a man frozen in the Alps dating from approximately 3,300 BC, although these finds are now in Italy on the Austrian border. <b>Another</b> <b>culture</b> is the Mondsee culture, represented by stilt houses in the Alpine lakes.|$|E

25|$|Sumardjo {{writes that}} the novel is an {{explicit}} condemnation of ethnic Chinese assimilation along the matrilineal line, in which an ethnic Chinese woman marries a non-Chinese man. He notes that, ultimately, Kim Nio is treated as neither Chinese nor Javanese after her second marriage. Suryadinata, who notes a more positive treatment of interracial marriages along the patrilineal line in Thio's Tjerita Njai Soemirah (1917), suggests that this {{was caused by a}} fear that a Chinese woman who married into <b>another</b> <b>culture</b> would no longer be Chinese, whereas a Chinese man marrying a non-Chinese woman could facilitate her absorption into the Chinese community.|$|E
25|$|Between 1600 and 1650 CE, the Whittlesey people disappeared. The cause—absorption into <b>another</b> <b>culture,</b> disease, emigration, {{low birth}} rate, warfare, or some {{combination}} of factors—is not known. By the time the Iroquois of what is now central New York began moving along the shore of Lake Erie into northeast Ohio in 1650 during the Beaver Wars, the area was almost uninhabited. In the early and mid 1700s, the Mingo, Odawa (or Ottawa), and Ouendat (or Wyandot) occupied the area after fleeing the Iroquois. By 1800, Native American emigration out of the area was occurring again, and few indigenous people lived anywhere in Ohio by 1850.|$|E
25|$|Also, most of {{the coins}} of the Greek kings in India were bilingual, written in Greek {{on the front and}} in Pali on the back (in the Kharosthi script, derived from Aramaic, rather than the more eastern Brahmi, which was used only once on coins of Agathocles of Bactria), a {{tremendous}} concession to <b>another</b> <b>culture</b> never before made in the Hellenic world. From the reign of Apollodotus II, around 80 BC, Kharosthi letters started to be used as mintmarks on coins in combination with Greek monograms and mintmarks, suggesting the participation of local technicians to the minting process. Incidentally, these bilingual coins of the Indo-Greeks were the key in the decipherment of the Kharoshthi script by James Prinsep (1799–1840). Kharoshthi became extinct around the 3rd century AD.|$|E
50|$|The {{issue of}} {{appropriation}} {{has come to}} the forefront in discussions of music’s globalization, since many Western European and North American artists have participated in “revitalization through appropriation,” claiming sounds and techniques from other cultures as their own and adding them to their work without properly crediting the origins of this music. Steven Feld explores this issue further, putting {{it in the context of}} colonialism: admiration alone of <b>another</b> <b>culture’s</b> music does not constitute appropriation, but in combination with power and domination (economic or otherwise), insufficient value is placed on the music’s origin and appropriation has taken place. If the originators of a piece of music are given due credit and recognition, this problem can be avoided.|$|R
