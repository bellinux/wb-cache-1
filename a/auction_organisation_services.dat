Proponents of the Vanguard method recommend that <b>service</b> <b>organisations</b> avoid the 'lean tools' developed for 'lean manufacturing' as they don't apply well in <b>service</b> <b>organisations.</b>|$|R

The paper reports findings that commercial <b>service</b> <b>organisation</b> websites are not as marketing ready as might be expected. The research hypotheses are partially supported in that Victorian local government websites show evidence of more sophisticated marketing capability than those of commercial <b>service</b> <b>organisations</b> in Australia and that the <b>service</b> <b>organisations</b> sampled are less likely to employ the Web as a marketing channel than local government. <br /...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} {{with people who are}} physically disabled and are living in Lebanon. The discussion focuses on what development has occurred for these people, how their households manage their lives within their local and national environment, what their needs are, and which service providers are attempting to address these needs. The national environment in which these people live and the situation of disabled people in developing countries is also considered. The thesis question asks if the service providers are meeting the development needs of the people with physical disabilities. The needs of the disabled people fall into two broad categories: practical and social. The Lebanese state is not active in addressing these needs and this role falls to the non-governmental organisations. It is shown that the non-governmental <b>organisation</b> <b>services</b> are in some way meeting the development needs of the people with physical disabilities. But both the non-governmental organisations and the people with physical disabilities identify weaknesses in the non-governmental <b>organisation</b> <b>service</b> provision. The physically disabled people experience improvements in their quality of life through their own efforts or {{with the support of the}} non-governmental organisations and/or their families...|$|R

40|$|<b>Service</b> <b>organisations</b> still {{struggle}} with {{the adoption of a}} road to excellence. Evidence exists that processes and systems in <b>service</b> <b>organisations</b> are not always as advanced as in manufacturing organisations. Adding a quality smile to the face of the service provider will not solve the problems that are caused by defects in the underlying work processes and systems. Attention to the hardware in <b>service</b> <b>organisations,</b> i. e. to the service design, should instead create a more reliable process flow and time for the service staff to develop improvement activities and spend more time with customers. The way <b>service</b> <b>organisations</b> started to take excellence seriously is by making their processes transparent, eliminating undesired steps and deleting loops. In this paper the focus is on expanding this approach by adding information systems and information sources into a process map. This seems to be a promising approach for small and medium sized <b>service</b> <b>organisations,</b> without having to invest in expensive and rigid business process automation. information systems;quality management;process mapping;service organisations...|$|R
