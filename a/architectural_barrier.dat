40|$|Recent {{advances}} in mobile robotic technologies have enabled significant progress {{to be made}} in the development of Stair-Climbing Mobility Systems (SCMSs) for people with mobility impairments and limitations. These devices are mainly characterized by their ability to negotiate those architectural barriers associated with climbing stairs (curbs, ramps, etc.). The development of advanced trajectory generators with which to surpass such architectural barriers is one of the most important aspects of SCMSs that has not yet been appropriately exploited. These advanced trajectory generators have a considerable influence on the time invested in the stair climbing process and on passenger comfort and, consequently, provide people with physical disabilities with greater independence and a higher quality of life. In this paper, we propose a new nonlinear trajectory generator for an SCMS. This generator balances the stair-climbing time and the user’s comfort and includes the most important constraints inherent to the system behavior: the geometry of the <b>architectural</b> <b>barrier,</b> the reconfigurable nature of the SCMS (discontinuous states), SCMS state-transition diagrams, comfort restrictions and physical limitations as regards the actuators, speed and acceleration. The SCMS was tested on a real two-step staircase using different time-comfort combinations and different climbing strategies to verify the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed approach...|$|E

40|$|The window {{can include}} {{a lot of}} {{different}} symbolic values and can be considered {{at the same time a}} border and a protection area: this architectural element allows the pessoan heteronomy Álvaro de Campos to observe other people’s life, taking place in the road. His gaze, attentive and absorbed at the same time, leads to the birth of the poem Tabacaria (1928). It is a poem that from the beginning portrays the collapse of illusion: the poet is a man who chooses not to live his own life, preferring to take refuge behind a window, a profound disillusionment narrated through the dialectics of ‘outside and inside’. In Tabacaria the window allows two opposing worlds – otherwise incompatible – to come together, although they remain separate, a contrast defined by the Pessoa-Campos as alienating, reminiscent of the perceptual dialectic theorized by the philosopher Merleau-Ponty. A window, an <b>architectural</b> <b>barrier</b> that allows you to see and be seen at the same time, putting together two seemingly irreconcilable worlds. ‘Tecnema’, which has always fascinated and here becomes the place of observation of the ‘tabacaria’, is the symbol of an illusory world. From a real and ordinary situation, ‘finished’ and enclosed by the walls of the attic, the poet conveys a feeling of infinity, eternity, through an expansion of the senses disintegrated from the tediousness of the existential poetic subject...|$|E

40|$|People with {{physical}} disabilities face challenges each day {{when trying to}} navigate a world filled with environmental and <b>architectural</b> <b>barriers.</b> Research indicates that environmental barriers isolate and prevent many people {{with physical}} disabilities from accessing and participating {{in the community and}} society. This research study directly applied quantifiable investigative methods through the dissemination of anonymous, online surveys that obtained a total of 363 participants who met the requirements of being between the ages of 18 and 65, and who have a medically diagnosed physical disability in order to identify key factors leading to the isolation among physically disabled persons. This study also discovers a relationship between environmental barriers and isolation among people with physical disabilities, and effectively establishes that the majority of participants identified environmental barriers as being the leading cause of their isolation and exclusion from society. Moreover, research acquired through this study uncovers the previously concealed realization that many individuals do not feel there is an effort being made to ensure that buildings and environments are accessible for people with physical disabilities; and further examines the colossal need for advocacy and change within ADA guidelines to create a more acceptable and adaptable solution for reducing or eliminating environmental and <b>architectural</b> <b>barriers...</b>|$|R
