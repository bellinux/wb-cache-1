40|$|Abstract—This study aims {{to explore}} the {{differences}} and similarities in perceptions of <b>affective</b> <b>climate</b> antecedents at the workplace (intimacy, flexibility, employment stability, and team) among Japanese and Thai Generations X and Y. The samples {{in this study were}} Thai and Japanese workers who completed a work environment questionnaire and provided demographic information. Generational differences in perceptions (beliefs) of what factors contribute to <b>affective</b> <b>climate</b> were investigated using t-test analysis. Mean scores for each antecedent were ranked to determine how each generation in each group prioritized the importance of all <b>affective</b> <b>climate</b> antecedents. Japanese Generation Y perceived the importance of employment stability for <b>affective</b> <b>climate</b> of their workplaces to be significantly higher than did Japanese Generation X. Thai Generation Y considered flexibility with a higher priority than did Thai Generation X. Intimacy was perceived as highly important across generations and countries in regard to <b>affective</b> <b>climate.</b> Results suggest that managers should design workplaces for a mixture of diverse generations, resulting in a better <b>affective</b> <b>climate.</b> Differences in the importance of antecedents for <b>affective</b> <b>climate</b> among Generations X and Y in two countries were clarified.

40|$|In this study, {{we propose}} a team-level moderated-mediation model {{examining}} how team-member exchange (TMX) and team <b>affective</b> <b>climate</b> {{serve as an}} important psychological mechanism and boundary condition to simultaneously influence the relationship between leader-member exchange (LMX) differentiation and team performance. We tested this model using data collected from a sample of 627 employees and their immediate managers working in 99 branches of a large bank in the People's Republic of China (PRC). Our findings provided support for the model showing that TMX mediated the relationship between LMX differentiation and team performance, and the mediation effect only occurred when team <b>affective</b> <b>climate</b> was strong but not when team <b>affective</b> <b>climate</b> was weak.

40|$|Transformational {{leadership}} (TFL) climate {{describes the}} degree to which leaders throughout an organization engage in TFL behaviors. In this study, we investigate performance linkages, mechanisms, and boundary conditions of TFL climate at the organizational level of analysis. In a sample of 158 independent organizations, 18, 094 employees provided data on TFL climate, positive <b>affective</b> <b>climate,</b> trust climate, and employees' task performance behavior and organizational citizenship behavior. In addition, human resource managers rated overall employee productivity. Study results yielded a pattern of moderated mediation for overall employee productivity and employees' aggregate task performance behavior, in that an organization's TFL climate was indirectly (through positive <b>affective</b> <b>climate)</b> related with these outcome variables under conditions of high trust climate, but not under conditions of low trust climate. Further, we found an organization's TFL climate to indirectly relate with employees' aggregate organizational citizenship behavior through positive <b>affective</b> <b>climate,</b> largely independent of the level of trust climate.

40|$|Public risk {{perceptions}} can fundamentally compel or constrain political, economic, {{and social}} action to address particular risks. Public support or opposition to climate policies (e. g., treaties, regulations, taxes, subsidies) will be {{greatly influenced by}} public perceptions of the risks and dangers posed by global climate change. This article describes results from a national study (2003) that examined the risk perceptions and connotative meanings of global warming in the American mind and found that Americans perceived climate change as a moderate risk that will predominantly impact geographically and temporally distant people and places. This research also identified several distinct interpretive communities, including naysayers and alarmists, with widely divergent perceptions of climate change risks. Thus, “dangerous ” climate change is a concept contested not only among scientists and policymakers, but among the American public as well.

This study investigates whether {{gender and}} the {{perceptions}} of department climate affects faculty job satisfaction and intentions to quit (work outcomes) with surveys responses from 308 faculty members {{in science and engineering}} fields. The study finds that both gender and department climate are related to work outcomes and that two facets of department <b>climate</b> (<b>affective</b> and instrumental) mediate the relationship between gender and both job satisfaction and intention to quit. This finding suggests that universities can benefit from improving department climate, which then may improve the retention of both male and female faculty, but may have an even greater impact on improving job satisfaction and reducing intentions to quit of female faculty...|$|R
40|$|Purpose This paper aims {{to propose}} a {{conceptual}} model that delineates the psychological process and boundary condition of how leader-member exchange (LMX) differentiation influences team performance. Design/methodology/approach Based on theories of leader-member exchange and social information processing, {{it is argued that}} several important mechanisms underpin the relationship between LMX differentiation and team performance. The role of these variables in the relationship is discussed. Findings The team mechanisms such as <b>affective</b> <b>climate</b> and team-member exchange (TMX) serve as a boundary condition and psychological process to influence the LMX differentiation-team performance relationship. Their conceptual significance and how they affect the relationship are discussed. Research limitations This study focuses on theorizing TMX and <b>affective</b> <b>climate</b> as key variables in the LMX differentiation-team performance relationship. Future research considers examining the relative importance of other variables such as team potency or team cohesion to advance our understanding of the precise mechanisms that explain the relationship. Practical implications The proposed model increases our understanding of the role of <b>affective</b> <b>climate</b> in the relationships between LMX differentiation, TMX and team performance. It helps minimize the negative effect of LMX differentiation, and may ultimately lead to better team performance. Originality/value Although the implication of LMX differentiation has been discussed extensively, the research has not yet led to a firm conclusion as to its relationship with team outcomes.

Using both qualitative and quantitative methods, this study investigates the impact of <b>affective</b> <b>climate</b> on the reactions to conflict events in culturally diverse workgroups. Data for Study 1 were collected from 265 group members and 142 group leaders (in both private and public sector organizations) who responded to open-ended survey questions on the general environment for conflict in their workgroups. In Study 2, respondents from 528 staff from seven public and private sector organizations reported on their workgroups’ <b>affective</b> <b>climate,</b> conflict events and reaction to conflict. Results of Study 1 showed that there was need for better leadership and conflict management skills in culturally heterogeneous groups.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} {{study was to examine}} the instructional conditions and practices described as successful for teachers in the Algebra I inclusive classroom. In the southeastern suburban school district used for this study, students who began their freshman year of high school in fiscal year 2000 faced new mathematics requirements for high school graduation, including taking Algebra I and passing an Algebra I end-of-course standards-based test. The new mathematics requirements presented a daunting challenge to general and special educators as increasing numbers of students with disabilities began to receive their instruction in the general education classroom. This school district targeted schools based on student performance on standards-based end-of-course tests and provided extra support and resources to enhance teaching and learning; however, other schools in the district had to reach the same goal - - improved student achievement [...] without the extra resources. Based on a comparative case study of three separate inclusive classrooms from three separate schools, findings were presented through a discussion of the theoretical framework. The theoretical framework for this study included theories from Skinner (1953) and Gagn (1985). Data were collected through interviews with teachers and their students with and without disabilities, through observations in classrooms, and by review of student data. Four major domains were addressed in this study. Those domains included instructional conditions, climate iii and planning, and instructional interventions, the use of time and teacher adaptations and accommodations. This study supported the notion that an <b>affective</b> classroom <b>climate</b> coupled with collaborative planning among team teachers [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In this {{qualitative}} case study, I investigated eighth-grade honors students’ {{and their}} language arts teacher’s {{perceptions of the}} support provided in writing groups, the climate in writing groups, and student and teacher support that enhanced students’ motivation to write in writing groups. Eleven study participants engaged in the inquiry, 10 middle school students and one language arts teacher. I collected data during the fall semester of 2014. Data were individual interviews, classroom observations of participants in writing groups, and program-related documents. The main aim in this investigation is to discover middle school students’ and their teacher’s perceptions of the support, climate, and motivation to write in writing groups. Five domains emerged from the data: peers working together on writing, teacher facilitation with writing, student perceptions of climate, teacher perceptions of climate, and creating a community of learners. Peers working together on writing and teacher facilitation with writing correspond to research question one: In what ways do 10 language arts middle school students and their language arts teacher support students’ writing efforts in writing groups {{over the course of}} a semester? Student perceptions of climate and teacher perceptions of climate correspond to research question two: In what ways do the language arts middle school students describe the writing climate in their writing groups {{over the course of a}} semester? Creating a community of learners corresponds to research question three: What type of teacher and student support do the language arts middle school students and their teacher think may enhance students’ motivation to write in writing groups? Discoveries show student participants believed working together on writing supported their personal writing and their teacher perceived teacher facilitation supported students’ writing efforts. Perceptions of climate in writing groups were mixed, with the majority of students describing the climate as supportive, although two students did not agreed. The teacher perceived a supportive climate in writing groups. Perceptions were also mixed regarding the support students and their teacher provided that enhanced students’ motivation to write in writing groups. Eight out of 10 students and the teacher perceived collaborative writing enhanced student motivation to write, while two students did not perceive collaboration had any effect on their writing motivation. The student participants believed peer assistance helped to enhance their motivation to write in writing groups while the teacher believed student choice in group mates might enhance student motivation to write. Writing groups may affect students’ and their teacher’s perceptions of students’ writing efforts, as working together on writing led to more positive perceptions. A lack of choice in groups and working with peers with established friendships may have implications for students’ perceptions of the group climate and motivation to write, especially when some students are allowed to choose their group and others are not. Students’ perceptions of the writing group climate play a role in their writing efforts, as students who held positive perceptions of their writing group climate had positive perceptions of the support in writing groups. Working with peers as a community is important to student motivation, as the collaborative aspect can serve as a motivator for many adolescents. This study is significant because it fills gaps in the literature about research on writing and group social environments, as well as middle level research on writing groups, and motivation, and the inclusion of student and teacher voice. This inquiry also provides teacher and student insights on the ways <b>affective</b> <b>climates</b> are created in a middle school language arts setting...|$|R

The present research aimed to shed light upon the prediction of {{identity crisis}} and addiction tendency based on the practical commitment to Islamic beliefs and affective family climate among the nursing and midwifery students in Islamic Azad University, Ahvaz Branch.  Materials and Methods: This correlational research applied a descriptive-cross sectional design through a canonical correlational method. The research sample comprised 150 students studying in nursing and midwifery who were selected through random cluster sampling. To collect the data, Practical Commitment to Islamic Beliefs Questionnaire, Hilburn Affective Family Climate Scale, as well as Identity Crisis and Addiction Tendency Questionnaires were used. The collected data were also analyzed using canonical correlational coefficient. Results: The {{results of the current}} study indicated that the bivariate correlation coefficients for all variables was significant at level of 0. 01. Moreover, the high correlation value could be found between family <b>affective</b> <b>climate</b> (one of the variables of the first set) and addiction tendency (one of the variables of the second set) (p< 0. 01). Conclusion: It could then be concluded that a healthy family <b>affective</b> <b>climate</b> can {{play a significant role in}} establishing deep and heartfelt relationship with God based on religious teachings, which could also result in bringing up children who are able to avoid having positive attitude toward drug use disorders, and can realize the fallacy of substance abuse.  ...|$|E
40|$|The {{question}} whether organizations should encourage leaders {{to treat their}} followers differently, or as a collective entity, has long fueled discussion among both practitioners and scholars. Recent advances point to two possible key constructs, namely, collective-focused leadership climate and differentiated individual-focused leadership. These constructs are important as they can have opposite effects on collective outcomes. However, at present, no single overarching theoretical framework has been put forward to help understand these opposite effects. Therefore, this study develops and tests a new, more unified, perspective. Drawing from the commitment literature {{and in particular the}} often used theories of social exchange and perceived organizational support therein, we first argue for opposite effects on the <b>affective</b> organization commitment <b>climate</b> among employees. Then we reason that organizational performance can increase, if such affective commitment is ‘put into action’ and raise the organizational-citizenship-behavior climate. Our three-path-mediation hypotheses are tested, and supported, by Structural Equation Modeling analyses in a multi-source dataset that contains more than 18, 000 respondents from 175 companies. This new empirically tested and supported perspective takes important steps toward resolving the long lingering question of whether to differentiate leadership or not...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in leadership research suggest that collective-focused leadership climate and differentiated individual-focused leadership might simultaneously, yet oppositely, affect collec-tive outcomes. The present study extends this literature by addressing open questions regarding theory, methods, statistics, {{and level of}} analysis. Therefore, {{a new and more}} parsimonious theo-retical model is developed on the organizational-level of analysis. Drawing on the commitment literature, we argue for opposite relations of the two leadership constructs on the <b>affective</b> orga-nizational commitment <b>climate.</b> We subsequently theorize that contingent-reward leadership cli-mate moderates these opposing relationships, making our study the first in this field to investigate moderators. Last, we reason that organizational effectiveness is enhanced when affective com-mitment is “put into action ” and raises the organizational citizenship behavior climate. Our three-path moderated-mediation hypotheses are tested, and supported, by structural equation modeling analyses in a multisource data set containing 16, 911 respondents from 157 companies. Extensive alternative model testing shows that our theory and findings are robust.

40|$|We {{present a}} follower-centric model of {{leadership}} that integrates multiple levels of analysis and includes meso-level {{processes in the}} form of emotional contagion. Focusing on negative emotions, we argue that leadership at the individual level is manifested in terms of the leader’s prototypical behavior, favoritism toward members, and affective displays. Drawing upon affective events theory and emotional contagion theory, we argue further that members ’ perceptions of a leader’s behaviors and affect associated with attributions of insincerity result in negative emotions. These spread to the other individuals, and are in turn reflected in the group’s <b>affective</b> <b>climate</b> and trust and, in particular, in the quality of leader-member relationships (LMX) and team-member relationships (TMX).

40|$|Affective imagery, or connotative meanings, play an {{important}} role in shaping public risk perceptions, policy support, and broader responses to climate change. These simple “topof-mind” associations and their related affect help reveal how diverse audiences understand and interpret global warming. And as a relatively simple set of measures, they are easily incorporated into representative surveys, making it possible to identify, measure, and monitor how connotative meanings are distributed throughout a population and how they change over time. Affective image analysis can help identify distinct interpretive communities of like-minded individuals who share their own set of common meanings and interpretations. The images also provide a highly sensitive measure of changes in public discourse. As scientists, political elites, advocates, and the media change the frames, images, icons, and emotions they use to communicate climate change, they can influence the interpretations of the larger public. Likewise, as members of the public directly or vicariously experience specific events or learn more about climate risks, they construct their own connotative meanings, which can in turn influence larger currents of public discourse.

Design/methodology/approach Separate questionnaires were completed by 395 individuals aged 50 to 70, who were in their career job and 195 individuals aged 50 to 70 who were employed in a bridge job. Both questionnaires included measures of development orientation, job development <b>climate,</b> <b>affective</b> commitment and intention to remain as well as individual characteristics and organizational characteristics. Findings The findings supported the proposed model in that development orientation was positively related to job development climate which, in turn, was positively related to affective commitment and affective commitment was positively related to intention to remain with the organization. There were both similarities and differences in the patterns of relationships for career‐job and bridge‐job respondents.

OBJECTIVE: To create a tool to measure the suffering that caregivers experience in association with their child's AE (Caregiver Pictorial Representation of Illness and Self-Measure, Caregiver-PRISM), assess the validity and reliability, and identify factors associated with caregiver suffering. METHODS: Caregiver-PRISM was administered to 45 parents of patients from an AE outpatient service (Padua, Italy). RESULTS: Caregiver-PRISM had a good test-retest reliability (r = 0. 85; t 7 = 4. 13; p < 0. 05), content validity and construct validity when used in parents of AE children. Parents with a less positive family <b>affective</b> <b>climate,</b> higher education, or with children following a diet experienced higher suffering associated with their child's AE, demonstrated by lower Caregiver-PRISM scores (p < 0. 05).

40|$|Recent work by Fisher {{highlighted}} {{the importance of}} making distinctions in levels of measurement of affect.

40|$|There is an {{impressive}} body of research suggesting that transformational and charismatic leadership are positively associated with performance outcomes. The role of linking mechanisms that facilitate the influence of transformational and charismatic leadership and the functioning of boundary conditions, however, is less well-understood. This dissertation {{is an attempt to}} address this research gap by providing three empirical studies analyzing linking mechanisms and boundary conditions in the context of transformational and charismatic leadership on the individual and group level of analysis. This dissertation investigates two different performance outcomes (task and innovation performance) two linking mechanisms (unit cohesion and commitment to change) as well as two distinct boundary conditions (positive <b>affective</b> tone and <b>climate</b> for initiative). Drawing on a sample of 206 units, Study 1 demonstrates that unit cohesion functions as a linking mechanism in the relationship between a transformational leadership climate and units’ task performance depending on positive affective tone as a boundary condition. Building on a sample of 196 employees, Study 2 reveals that transformational leadership is an antecedent of commitment to change and that its positive effect on followers’ innovation performance depends on a climate for initiative. Study 3 turns to charismatic leadership and explores the relative importance of trust in top management in influencing followers’ innovation performance. In a sample of 194 employees, results show that trust in top management has a stronger indirect effect through commitment to change on followers’ innovation performance than charismatic leadership. This dissertation shows that transformational and charismatic leadership have significant impacts on performance outcomes on the individual and group level of analysis. More importantly, the findings contribute {{to a better understanding of}} linking mechanisms and boundary conditions in the transformational and charismatic leadership – performance linkage. This dissertation not only provides theoretical reasoning and empirical evidence, but also important practical insights and implications for organizational leaders on how to improve transformational and charismatic leadership effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) There is a {{consensus}} that women are underrepresented in senior management positions across the world. Since the early 1970 s, researchers have been exploring the factors and forces contributing to the low presence of women in senior management roles. Theoretical and empirical scholarship suggests that women’s advancement to senior management positions is not only affected by personal factors such as qualifications, experiences and aspiration to ascend to senior leadership positions {{but also by the}} positive effect of structural factors such as human resource policies and practices, organisational climate and attitudinal factors such as stereotypical attitudes toward women as managers. At the organisational level, most prior studies have identified both structural and attitudinal factors that create barriers to women advancing to senior management positions; however, there is a knowledge gap concerning how these organisational factors influence the intention of top managers to promote women to senior management positions. Ajzen’s Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) suggests that people’s (behavioural) intention is an immediate determinant of enacting the behaviour in question. To predict and understand the future pattern of women’s presence in senior management positions, it is imperative to examine the intention of top managers to promote women to senior management positions that leads to actual behaviour associated with promoting women. Therefore, this study adopts a positivist-quantitative research paradigm and develops a TPB-based research model. To examine this model, primary data were collected from 182 human resource managers in Bangladesh {{through the use of a}} cross-sectional, self-administered survey (online and paper). Partial least squares based structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) analysis reveals that positive attitudes toward women as managers, anticipated <b>affective</b> reactions, organisational <b>climate,</b> human resources policies and practices, and subjective norms have a significant influence on the intention of top managers to promote women to senior management positions. Additionally, the results of bootstrapped confidence analyses indicate that anticipated affective reactions and attitudes toward the promotion of women to senior management positions mediate the relationship between attitudes toward women as managers and the intention of top managers to promote women to senior management positions. Similarly, subjective norms mediate the relationship between organisational climate and the intention of top managers to promote women as well as the relationship between human resource policies and practices and the intention to promote women. The findings of this study also justify the inclusion of structural and attitudinal variables within the TPB framework. Thus, this study extends and validates the predictive capability of the TPB in the field of human resource management and has implications for initiatives addressing gender equity in relation to senior management roles...|$|R
40|$|Abstract To vie in today's {{ever-increasing}} competitive knowledge-based economics environments, team-based {{design has}} recently {{become one of}} core issues {{as well as a}} main organizational structure design. However, little is known about how to intensify knowledge sharing reciprocally among team members. This study aimed to revisit the salient factors of perceived team support, <b>affective</b> commitment, and <b>climate</b> for initiative using multilevel approach. Convenience sampling method was used for data collection. Questionnaires were delivered to 101 sampled teams employed by 97 organizations in Taiwan. Each questionnaire package contained copies of team member questionnaires and one copy of the leader questionnaire. After the elimination of invalid questionnaires, there were 73 team-leaders coupled with 426 team-members from 73 organizations. The sample varied in different functional work teams in various departments (e. g. production, sales, marketing, human resources, research & design, and finance). Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) was used {{to examine the relationship between}} climate for initiative and team members' intention to share knowledge. The results indicated that climate for initiative contributes to team member's intention of knowledge sharing. Additionally, perceived team support and affective commitment were both related to individuals' intention to share knowledge respectively. The results also supported the mediating role of affective commitment in the relationship between perceived team support and intention to share knowledge. Cumulatively, this study contributes to the literature by advancing the understanding the motivational drivers, such as perceived team support and affective commitment that underlie individuals' intention to share knowledge within teams.

40|$|We {{present a}} follower-centric model of {{leadership}} that integrates multiple levels of analysis, and includes emotional contagion {{as a key}} meso-level process. In our model, leadership {{at the individual level}} is manifested in terms of the leader 2 ̆ 7 s favoritism toward members and affective displays. Drawing upon affective events theory, we argue that member perceptions of a leader 2 ̆ 7 s behaviors and member attributions of insincerity result in negative emotions. Through a process of emotional contagion, the negative emotions then spread to other individuals in the group. These are in turn reflected in the group 2 ̆ 7 s <b>affective</b> <b>climate</b> and trust climate, and also in the quality of leader-member and team-member relationships. In the end, this results in organizational-level disapproval of the leader and cynicism towards the leader. Included as moderators in the model are task interdependence, the temporal context, reward systems, emotional labor requirements, organizational culture, and power distance. We conclude with a discussion of boundary conditions, and implications of our model for research, theory, and practice...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{we seek to}} advance {{research}} on interpersonal exchange relationships by integrating social exchange, workplace friendship, and climate research in a multilevel model. We tested the model with data obtained from a sample of 215 manager-employee dyads working in 36 teams using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM). At the individual level, leader-member exchange (LMX) {{was found to be}} related to workplace friendship. Further, workplace friendship was positively related to team-member exchange (TMX), and also mediated the LMX-TMX relationship. At the team level, HLM results indicate that the relationship between LMX and workplace friendship was moderated by <b>affective</b> <b>climate.</b> Considerable research attention has been devoted to understanding the implications of leader-member exchange (LMX) theory over the last twenty-five years (see Graen & Uhl-Bien, 1995, for a review). LMX theorists focus on differentiated exchange relationships that leaders develop and maintain with subordinates within work teams (Dansereau et al., 1975). The evidence from this research has demonstrated that LMX substantially influences employees ’ organizational commitment, job satisfaction, task performance, citizenship behavior, and turnover intentions (e. g., see Gerstner &...|$|E
40|$|Considerable {{research}} {{attention has}} been devoted to understanding the implications of leader-member exchange (LMX) theory over the last thirty years (see Graen & Uhl-Bien, 1995, for a review). A review of research has suggested that LMX substantially influences employees 2 ̆ 7 work attitudes and behaviours (e. g., see Gerstner & Day, 1997; Janssen & Van Yperen, 2004). Nonetheless, there is an important omission in LMX research; namely, how does LMX quality influence people outside of the dyadic relationships (Sias & Jablin, 1995) ? Sparrowe and Liden (1997), Liden and Sparrowe (in press) and Oh, Chung and Labianca (2004) suggest that interpersonal exchange relationships between leaders, subordinates, and coworkers are interconnected to constitute a larger social system that operates in teams and organisations. Similarly, based on a systems perspective, Graen and Uhl-Bien (1995) call for more research to understand how LMX dyadic relationships influence employees 2 ̆ 7 work attitudes, behaviours and perceptions in larger collectives of workgroups. This is because LMX quality is not only influenced by, but may also influence other exchange relationships within the larger system. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the characteristics of a dyadic relationship between a leader and a subordinate will also have implications for team member exchange (TMX), defined by Seers (1989) as the relationship quality between an individual and her or his team members (see also Sherony & Green, 2002; Sias, 1996; Sias & Jablin, 1995). In this thesis, therefore, my aim is to advance the research on interpersonal exchange relationships by addressing research questions that explore how vertical exchange relationships between supervisors and subordinates influence lateral exchange relationships among team members in organisations. Specifically, I have integrated social exchange theory (SET), social identity theory (SIT), emotional contagion theory (ECT), and climate research to develop and to test a multilevel model. At the individual level, I theorised that LMX quality influences individual team members 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of TMX quality. I also hypothesised that social identification and affect act as cognitive and affective mechanisms that mediate the relationship between LMX quality and TMX quality. At the group level, I hypothesised that LMX differentiation fairness moderates the relationship between LMX quality and social identification, while <b>affective</b> <b>climate</b> moderates the relationship between individual team members 2 ̆ 7 positive affect and TMX quality. In order to test the validity of my model, I adopted the post-positivist research position resting on a realist ontology (what is the nature of reality), an objective epistemology (the relationship between the knowledge and the inquirer), where both qualitative and quantitative methods were used to investigate the hypothesised relationships in three studies. Study 1 was an exploratory study intended to identify the nature of TMX and the role of emotions within the team member exchange relationships. Personal in-depth interviews and surveys were used to collect qualitative and quantitative data in this study. The sample for this study was 25 employees working in five different teams in a private health service provider and a medium-sized construction material company in Australia. The qualitative results revealed that a variety of exchanges occur within the team member relationships, including relationship-oriented and task-oriented exchanges. Team members also reported that they experienced both positive and negative emotions in response to their TMX relationships. The quantitative results further indicated that positive emotions, rather than negative emotions, were associated with effective TMX relationships. These results support the findings of past research on TMX and emotions in teams, suggesting TMX relationship was an important outcome variable. Based on these results, only positive affect was included in the model to be examined in the remainder of the studies. Study 2 used a quantitative cross-sectional design to examine the relationships between LMX quality, social identification, positive affect, and TMX quality at the individual level of the multilevel model. The sample for this study was 262 employees of an Australian bank and a national restaurant chain. A web-survey was developed and used to collect data from employees and structural equation modelling (SEM) was utilised to analyse the data. Results showed that LMX quality was positively related to social identification and TMX quality. Further, social identification was found to mediate the relationship between LMX quality and TMX quality, while positive affect mediated the relationship between social identification and TMX quality. These results are consistent with SET, SIT and ECT and support the individual-level relationships between the variables in the model. Study 3 was designed to test the group-level moderating effects of LMX differentiation fairness and <b>affective</b> <b>climate</b> on individual-level relationships between the variables. This study built on the results of Study 2 to evaluate the validity of the overall model. Manager-reported and self-reported questionnaires were used to collected data from 2 15 manager-employee matched dyads working in 36 teams for an Australian bank. Managers provided ratings on LMX quality for each of their subordinates within a team, while employees provided ratings on LMX differentiation fairness, <b>affective</b> <b>climate,</b> social identification, positive affect, and TMX quality. Hierarchical liner modelling (HLM) was used to analyse the multilevel data. Results confirmed that the individual-level relationship between individual team members 2 ̆ 7 positive affect and TMX quality was moderated by group-level <b>affective</b> <b>climate.</b> Overall, findings from this research provide mostly supportive evidence for the hypothesised relationships in the model. The major findings demonstrate that employees enjoying high-quality LMX relationships tend to develop high-quality TMX relationships with their team members because they strongly identify with their teams, and that this identification induces positive emotions, which in turn enhances TMX quality. In addition, individual team members experiencing positive affect were found to be more likely to form high-quality TMX relationships with others when the <b>affective</b> <b>climate</b> in their teams is strong. To the best of my knowledge, this research is among the first to explore interpersonal exchange relationships in a larger social system in organisations by developing and testing a multilevel model. I have outlined the theoretical contributions of this research to SET, SIT, ECT, and climate research. In practical terms, this research increases our understanding of how managers use high-quality relationships with subordinates as a means of maximising individual and team effectiveness by demonstrating concern for subordinates 2 ̆ 7 emotional well-being in the workplace...|$|E
40|$|Several {{years of}} {{research}} into teacher expectations and teacher expectation effects has provided clear evidence that expectations do exist in regular classroom situations {{and that they can}} influence student performance and achievement (Babad, 1993; Brophy, 1982 a; Cooper & Good, 1983; Good, 1987; Jussim, 1989; Timperley, Robinson, & Bullard, 1999). Such expectations may be exemplified in the learning opportunities provided, in the <b>affective</b> <b>climate</b> created and in the interactional content and context of the classroom. These experiences may differ for students within the same classroom environment and may lead to differential learning. Brophy (1982 b) contends that expectations generally make a five percent difference to student achievement and asserts that while this may be small the accumulation of such an effect {{over a number of years}} could have marked effects on student achievement. Other researchers have reported larger effects particularly for student grades which may represent both self-fulfilling prophecies as well as perceptual biases (Jussim & Eccles, 1992). Moreover some students may be more susceptible to teacher expectations than others and some teachers identified as highdifferentiating or high-bias may have greater effects on their students than others (Babad, Inbar, &...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, an {{analysis}} is presented of professional and bureaucratic predictors of physician satisfaction. Results from 210 physicians in 17 medical departments of university hospitals support the hypotheses that both professional attitudes and formal structuring of work activities {{have a positive}} effect on physician satisfaction. It is shown that behavior formalization, preference for professional autonomy and the time spent on patient care activities within medical departments are positive predictors of satisfaction with work environment, while 'traditional' professional attitudes like craftsmanship and client service have more impact on satisfaction with patient demand. Certification is a strong positive predictor of work load satisfaction. Satisfaction with work environment was the most important factor in explaining other satisfaction dimensions. This finding supports the hypothesized 'buffering' effect of the <b>affective</b> <b>climate</b> or 'feel' of the professional work environment in hospitals. The implication of the findings is, that in the process of bureaucratization of medical practice in hospitals, specific attention should be paid to the maintenance of professional values as guidelines for professional work and to the maintenance of a good affective work environment for professionals in order to prevent dissatisfaction with patient demand and work load. physician satisfaction bureaucratic structure professional autonomy hospitals...|$|E
40|$|Scholars {{have studied}} {{emotions}} and affect in organizational settings for over twenty years, providing numerous insights into understanding how {{organizations and the}} people who work in them behave. With such a rich accumulation of knowledge, the time seemed right to call for today’s scholars of management to propose new and exciting theory. The eight articles in this Special Topic Forum address topics that cross multiple levels of analysis and include a range of different theories, explicating: how anger and fear can spark productivity, how employees respond to abusive supervision over time, how leader-member exchanges are shaped by affective events, the social functions of emotional complexity for leaders, team entrepreneurial passion, the effects of institutional beliefs on emotional displays, the nexus of <b>affective</b> <b>climate</b> and organizational effectiveness, and the role of gratitude in organizations. In this introduction, we briefly summarize the main points from each article, and discuss new research directions arising from the articles. To spur even deeper research into this important and still unfolding field of discovery, and stimulated by the articles in this STF, we conclude with additional thoughts and ideas on the role of emotions and affect in organizations...|$|E
