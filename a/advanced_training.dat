5|$|Inaugurated at Ottawa, Canada, in October 1939, EATS {{was a plan}} {{to expand}} the Royal Air Force's (RAF) {{capacity}} to train aircrews by creating a pool of personnel from various Commonwealth countries—Australia, Canada, Britain and New Zealand—through {{the establishment of a}} common training system consisting of a series of initial, elementary, and <b>advanced</b> <b>training</b> schools. At the conclusion of <b>advanced</b> <b>training,</b> personnel were posted as required to RAF-controlled squadrons in Britain or the Middle East. These squadrons were designated as either RAF, RAAF, Royal Canadian Air Force or Royal New Zealand Air Force squadrons, but were paid for and administered by the British government, and personnel could be drawn from any Commonwealth nation. Seventeen RAAF squadrons were formed during the war under Article XV of the agreement.|$|E

5|$|An {{experimental}} Cub Scout Trainer Wood Badge was {{field tested}} in 1976.

Wood Badge was adopted as the official <b>advanced</b> <b>training</b> program for adult Cub Scout Leaders. The modified course blended Scoutcraft skills and troop management practices along with scaled-down content about the leadership competencies.|$|E

Though most Italian universities have classes in related subjects such as music history, performance is not a common feature of university education.|$|E
