5|$|At 16, Barr {{was hit by}} a {{car that}} left her with <b>a</b> <b>traumatic</b> brain injury. Her {{behavior}} changed so radically that she was institutionalized for eight months at Utah State Hospital. While institutionalized she had a baby, which she gave up for adoption.|$|E
5|$|For many {{communities}} {{the existence of}} buildings that formerly housed residential schools are <b>a</b> <b>traumatic</b> reminder of the system's legacy, {{and there has been}} much discussion about demolition, heritage status and how the possibility of incorporating sites into the healing process.|$|E
5|$|Post-mortem reports {{indicated}} that {{she died of}} <b>a</b> <b>traumatic</b> brain injury, the result of severe blows to the head. The governor of Michoacán said that organized crime was undoubtedly involved. Gorrostieta Salazar was buried alongside her husband José Sánchez Chávez in a tomb at a local cemetery in Tiquicheo, her hometown.|$|E
30|$|High-energy blunt chest injury {{will bring}} out severe cardiac and {{pulmonary}} injuries. It may cause cardiac contusion, rupture, cardiac valve dysfunction, and aortic laceration [1]. <b>As</b> <b>traumatic</b> hemopericardium occurs, ultrasound is a convenient and reliable tool for diagnosis. We presented a 55 -year-old male victim of blunt chest trauma complicated with hemopericardium, cardiac tamponade, cardiac contusion and epicardial hematoma.|$|R
50|$|Obsessive {{compulsive}} disorder may {{be diagnosed}} for intrusive thoughts that are recurring but {{not related to}} <b>a</b> specific <b>traumatic</b> event.|$|R
50|$|Duret haemorrhages {{are areas}} of {{bleeding}} in the midbrain and upper pons due to <b>a</b> downward <b>traumatic</b> {{displacement of the}} brainstem.|$|R
5|$|A {{pneumothorax}} (collapsed lung) is {{an abnormal}} collection of {{air in the}} pleural space that causes an uncoupling of the lung from the chest wall. The lung cannot expand against the air pressure inside the pleural space. An easy to understand example is <b>a</b> <b>traumatic</b> pneumothorax, where air enters the pleural space from outside the body, as occurs with puncture to the chest wall. Similarly, a scuba diver ascending while holding their breath with their lungs fully inflated can cause air sacs (alveoli) to burst and leak high pressure air into the pleural space.|$|E
5|$|A primary {{pneumothorax}} is {{one that}} occurs without an apparent cause {{and in the absence}} of significant lung disease, while a secondary pneumothorax occurs in the presence of existing lung disease. Smoking increases the risk as do lung diseases including COPD, asthma, and tuberculosis. A pneumothorax can also be caused by physical trauma to the chest (including a blast injury), or as a complication of a healthcare intervention; in which case it is called <b>a</b> <b>traumatic</b> pneumothorax.|$|E
5|$|Born a slave in Dorchester County, Maryland, Tubman {{was beaten}} and whipped by her various masters as a child. Early in life, she {{suffered}} <b>a</b> <b>traumatic</b> head wound when an irate slave owner threw a heavy metal weight intending to hit another slave and hit her instead. The injury caused dizziness, pain, and spells of hypersomnia, which occurred throughout her life. She was a devout Christian and experienced strange visions and vivid dreams, which she ascribed to premonitions from God.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Femoral neck {{fractures}} {{occur in}} approximately 6, 000 {{of young adults}} annually (ages 18 - 49) (1). Of these, <b>a</b> high-energy <b>traumatic</b> event is the typical cause. Although medications and chronic diseases have been implicated as confounding causes of hip fractures, clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for an oncologic etiology of hip fractures occurring in young patients without <b>an</b> inciting <b>traumatic</b> event.

5|$|Born in Sylvan Lake, New York, {{he played}} {{organized}} baseball {{from the time}} that he was a child, from playing in the local sandlots to the semi-professional Actives of Wappingers Falls, New York. On July 7, , while running the bases, he collided at home plate with a catcher, named Johnny Quigley, of the Clippers of Harlem. Quigley was knocked unconscious, having suffered <b>a</b> <b>traumatic</b> head injury, and later died from these injuries on August 12. The 19-year-old Brouthers was cleared of any wrongdoing by the authorities.|$|E
5|$|Dyslexia is {{believed}} to be caused by both genetic and environmental factors. Some cases run in families. It often occurs in people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and is associated with similar difficulties with numbers. It may begin in adulthood as the result of <b>a</b> <b>traumatic</b> brain injury, stroke, or dementia. The underlying mechanisms of dyslexia are problems within the brain's language processing. Dyslexia is diagnosed through a series of tests of memory, spelling, vision, and reading skills. Dyslexia is separate from reading difficulties caused by hearing or vision problems or by insufficient teaching.|$|E
5|$|Hyperbaric {{oxygen therapy}} (HBO) has been {{evaluated}} as an add on treatment following TBI. The {{findings of a}} 2012 Cochrane systematic review does not justify the routine use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy to treat people recovering from <b>a</b> <b>traumatic</b> brain injury. This review also reported {{that only a small}} number of randomized controlled trials had been conducted at the time of the review, many of which had methodological problems and poor reporting. HBO for TBI is controversial with further evidence required to determine if it has a role.|$|E

5|$|In 1983, when Ryder was 12, she {{enrolled}} at the American Conservatory Theater in nearby San Francisco, where she took her first acting lessons. In 1989, Ryder graduated from Petaluma High School with a 4.0 GPA. She suffers from aquaphobia because of <b>a</b> <b>traumatic</b> near-drowning at age 12. This caused problems with the underwater scenes in Alien Resurrection (1997), some of {{which had to be}} reshot numerous times.|$|E
5|$|In December 2013, Schumacher {{suffered}} <b>a</b> <b>traumatic</b> {{brain injury}} in a skiing accident. He {{was placed in}} a medically induced coma for six months until 16 June 2014. He left the hospital in Grenoble for further rehabilitation at the University Hospital of Lausanne. On 9 September 2014, Schumacher was relocated to his home where he continues to receive medical treatment and rehabilitation privately.|$|E
5|$|The {{conquest of}} Amorium {{was not only}} a major {{military}} disaster and a heavy personal blow for Theophilos, but also <b>a</b> <b>traumatic</b> event for the Byzantines, its impact resonating in later literature. The sack did not ultimately alter the balance of power, which was slowly shifting in Byzantium's favour, but it thoroughly discredited the theological doctrine of Iconoclasm, ardently supported by Theophilos. As Iconoclasm relied heavily on military success for its legitimization, the fall of Amorium contributed decisively to its abandonment shortly after Theophilos's death in 842.|$|E
50|$|A trauma trigger is an {{experience}} that causes someone to recall <b>a</b> previous <b>traumatic</b> memory, although the trigger itself need not be frightening or traumatic and can be indirectly or superficially reminiscent of <b>an</b> earlier <b>traumatic</b> incident. Trauma triggers are related to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), {{a condition in which}} people often cannot control the recurrence of emotional or physical symptoms, or of repressed memory. Triggers can be subtle and difficult to anticipate, and can sometimes exacerbate PTSD. A trauma trigger may also be referred to as a trauma stimulus or a trauma stressor.|$|R
50|$|Brief {{reactive}} psychosis generally follows <b>a</b> recognisably <b>traumatic</b> life {{event like}} divorce or homelessness, {{but may be}} triggered by any subjective experience which appears catastrophic to the person affected.|$|R
50|$|Similar to the above, the {{character}} Emmeryn in Nintendo's Fire Emblem: Awakening {{shows signs of}} this condition after <b>a</b> presumably <b>traumatic</b> injury, along with {{what seems to be}} amnesia.|$|R
5|$|The {{contemporary}} historian Simon Wessley {{describes the}} novel, alongside Barker's Regeneration, as an exemplar of contemporary fiction which uses {{the experience of}} the World War I trenches to examine more contemporary understandings of PTSD. De Groot argues that this reinvestigation of <b>a</b> <b>traumatic</b> history mirrors a growing interest among both literary authors and historians in trauma as a thematic subject.|$|E
5|$|A 2009 {{study showed}} that holes in the skulls of several {{specimens}} that were previously explained by intraspecific attacks might {{have been caused by}} Trichomonas-like parasites that commonly infect avians. Further evidence of intraspecific attack were found by Joseph Peterson and his colleagues in the juvenile Tyrannosaurus nicknamed Jane. Peterson and his team found that Jane's skull showed healed puncture wounds on the upper jaw and snout which they believe came from another juvenile Tyrannosaurus. Subsequent CT scans of Jane's skull would further confirm the team's hypothesis, showing that the puncture wounds came from <b>a</b> <b>traumatic</b> injury and that there was subsequent healing. The team would also state that Jane's injuries were structurally different from the parasite-induced lesions found in Sue and that Jane's injuries were on her face whereas the parasite that infected Sue caused lesions to the lower jaw.|$|E
5|$|After construction, Morris invited {{friends to}} visit, most notably Burne-Jones {{and his wife}} Georgiana, as well as Rossetti and his wife Lizzie Siddal. They aided him in {{painting}} murals on the furniture, walls, and ceilings, much of it based on Arthurian tales, the Trojan War, and Geoffrey Chaucer's stories, while he also designed floral embroideries for the rooms. They also spent much time playing tricks on each other, enjoying games like hide and seek, and singing while accompanied by the piano. Siddall stayed at the House during summer and autumn 1861 as she recovered from <b>a</b> <b>traumatic</b> miscarriage and an addiction to laudanum; she would die of an overdose in February 1862.|$|E

5|$|Diseases {{may also}} affect the {{pericardium}} which surrounds the heart, which when inflamed is called pericarditis. This {{may result from}} infective causes (such as glandular fever, cytomegalovirus, coxsackievirus, tuberculosis or Q fever), systemic disorders such as amyloidosis or sarcoidosis, tumours, high uric acid levels, and other causes. This inflammation affects {{the ability of the}} heart to pump effectively. When fluid builds up in the pericardium this is called pericardial effusion, which when it causes acute heart failure is called cardiac tamponade. This may be blood from <b>a</b> <b>traumatic</b> injury or fluid from an effusion. This can compress the heart and adversely affect the function of the heart. The fluid can be removed from the pericardial sac using a syringe in a procedure called pericardiocentesis.|$|E
5|$|Ernest Edward Mills Joyce AM (about 1875 – 2 May 1940) was a Royal Naval seaman and {{explorer}} {{who participated}} in four Antarctic expeditions during the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration, early in the early 20th century. He served under both Robert Falcon Scott and Ernest Shackleton. As {{a member of the}} Ross Sea party in Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, Joyce earned an Albert Medal for his actions in bringing the stricken party to safety, after <b>a</b> <b>traumatic</b> journey on the Great Ice Barrier. He was awarded the Polar Medal with four bars, one of only two men to be so honoured, the other being his contemporary, Frank Wild.|$|E
5|$|Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) {{agrees to}} give sketch show TGS with Tracy Jordan head writer Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{a ride to}} Newark Liberty International Airport to meet her boyfriend Carol (Matt Damon). On the way, she tells him that she is having {{intimacy}} issues with Carol and wants to end the relationship. Jack, who is having a successful run of problem-solving, encourages Liz to confide in him {{so that he can}} help solve her problem. She tells him of <b>a</b> <b>traumatic</b> incident from her childhood when, preparing to use the bathroom whilst wearing roller skates, she pulled down her underpants and fell, pulling a Tom Jones poster on top of her. Her mother (Anita Gillette) discovered Liz under the poster and suspected her of masturbating, so she took all her posters away. With their limousine stuck in traffic, Jack exits the vehicle to try to digest Liz's story.|$|E

50|$|Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: This {{refers to}} {{children}} who may be experiencing or have experienced <b>a</b> single <b>traumatic</b> event (e.g. <b>an</b> earthquake), <b>a</b> series of <b>traumatic</b> events (e.g. air raids), or chronic stress (e.g. abuse). Furthermore, {{the nature of the}} trauma and its effect on the child must be understood {{in the context of the}} child. Specifically, attention must be paid to factors such as social context, personality factors, and the caregivers’ ability to assist with coping.|$|R
