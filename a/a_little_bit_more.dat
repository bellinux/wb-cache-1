5|$|Infamous is an action-adventure game set {{in an open}} world {{environment}} and played from a third-person perspective where the player controls Cole and primarily interacts {{with the world of}} Empire City through Cole's newly gained electricity-based powers; these are used for movement, offense and defense in combat, and either for better or worse in dealing with the citizens of Empire City. In order for Cole to use his powers, he must have stored electrical power, represented by a node meter on the player's heads up display (HUD). The player can recharge Cole by draining electricity from powered sources or from living beings; recharging also restores Cole's health, which is indicated by blood splattering onto the screen. The more damage that Cole takes, the more blood that covers the screen. When Cole's health is at a critical level, the screen will turn black and white, and if Cole takes <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> damage while the screen is black and white, a heartbeat will be heard and will get slower and slower as Cole takes more damage, until it is beating dangerously slow. At this point, further damage to Cole will kill him. If the player stays out of battle long enough, Cole's health will regenerate over time. The game features seventeen different electrical powers, ranging from simple bolts that do not consume Cole's energy to wide-field lightning storms that drain most of Cole's energy. The player can use such powers, giving the player options in certain situations. For example, the player may fire at a generator near foes to cause it to explode and cripple his opponents, then restrain them or fire at the body to kill the enemy.|$|E

I Did It Again" [...] was {{considered}} as a sequel to Spears' debut album, [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] (1999), percolating with a carefully measured blend of familiar pop, funk, R&B and power-balladry. Spears said on an interview that the album has a more mature, R&B-flavored pop sound. [...] "It's not something I changed purposefully," [...] Spears said of the album's sound. [...] "It's just something that kind of changed on itself with me being older. My voice has changed <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> and I'm <b>more</b> confident, and I think that comes across on the material." [...] One of its producers, Rodney [...] "Darkchild" [...] Jerkins talked about working with Spears on a Rolling Stones cover, stating, [...] "It's going to shock everybody," [...] he said. [...] "It has flavors of the original, but it's a straight 2000 version — new to the ear. Which I think is cool, because people who appreciate that song are going to love it. And I made it so new and young that the young kids that love Britney are going to love it. It's going to grab both a mature and young audience." [...] Spears also worked with Robert [...] "Mutt" [...] Lange, saying, [...] "When you hear the song, it's so pure and delicate. It's {{just one of those}} songs that pull you in," [...] Spears told MTV News. [...] "I think they wrote it 'specially for me, because the lyrics of the song, if you really listen … they're more of what I can relate to, 'cause they're kind of young lyrics, I think. I don't think Shania would probably sing some of the words that I'm saying." ...|$|R
