The following conclusions were drawn in this study. First, the justification for implementation of <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> was examined through analysis of changes and status of <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> in domestic infrastructure, and the current status and insufficiencies in the <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> manuals of the government and ordering authorities were inspected. Second, the current status and systems of infrastructure <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> manuals in developed foreign nations such as Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States were examined, to analyze and compare the characteristics of <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> manuals among different nations.

The maturity of an organisation in its <b>Asset</b> <b>Management</b> practices and processes can be determined through applying an <b>Asset</b> <b>Management</b> Audit. This study had as main objective to develop an <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> auditing methodology. The methodology includes the development of a Program for <b>Asset</b> <b>Management</b> Improvement (PAMI) and the application of Business Process Engineering as a tool to realise the improvement opportunities identified through the audit. <b>Asset</b> <b>Management</b> is clearly defined in this study and a framework representing the scope of <b>Asset</b> <b>Management</b> developed to comprehensively address the relevant elements. The life cycle of an asset consists of the acquisition, operation, maintenance and disposal phases. These four phases of an asset’s life represents the high level framework for <b>Asset</b> <b>Management.</b> The application of an <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> audit, according to the developed methodology, can create the “roadmap” to <b>Asset</b> <b>Management</b> excellence.

40|$|The growing {{recognition}} amongst local authorities {{of the potential}} of <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> to improve property management practice has led to its increased adoption. The growing trend has been supported {{by the development of}} <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> frameworks. However, evidence indicates that local authorities are failing to achieve the full benefits from their <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> implementation. The factors contributing to some of the property management problems such as reactive management, lack of leadership support, ineffective corporate landlord approach, remain. The available frameworks are incapable of mitigating the identified problems by failing to provide understanding of local authority differences. Therefore, this research aimed to develop an adaptable and flexible operational property <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> framework for local authorities in England and Scotland. The strategic management theory, review of existing literature findings and evaluation of available <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> frameworks especially the Total <b>Asset</b> <b>Management</b> Process model helped to identify, define and establish the causal logic of the <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> concepts underpinning the developed conceptual framework. Face to face semi-structured interviews followed by large scale questionnaire surveys were used to gather primary data. The key research findings are that the following are the key factors limiting <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> practice improvements in local authorities: ineffective leadership support, <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> capabilities and corporate landlord approach; inadequate <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> information systems and performance management arrangements. Principal components factor analysis was utilised to help establish underlying factors that account for flexible and adaptable <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> framework. The findings suggest that <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> processes associated with an adaptable and flexible <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> framework include a board level cross functional <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> structure; strong leadership support for both direct and indirect property; an enabling environment; an effective corporate landlord approach; an effective performance management arrangement; and availability of an appropriate management information system. The framework has been validated to be robust and can be utilised and flexibly adapted by different local authorities and provides the basis for improving the process and outcome of <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> practice...|$|R
