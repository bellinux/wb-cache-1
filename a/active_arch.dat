40|$|The human foot is {{characterized}} by a pronounced longitudinal arch (LA) that compresses and recoils in response to external load during locomotion, allowing for storage and return of elastic energy within the passive structures of the arch and contributing to metabolic energy savings. Here, we examine the potential for active muscular contribution to the biomechanics of arch deformation and recoil. We test the hypotheses that activation of the three largest plantar intrinsic foot muscles, abductor hallucis, flexor digitorum and quadratus plantae is associated with muscle stretch in response to external load on the foot and that activation of these muscles (via electrical stimulation) will generate sufficient force to counter the deformation of LA caused by the external load. We found that recruitment of the intrinsic foot muscles increased with increasing load, beyond specific load thresholds. Interestingly, LA deformation and muscle stretch plateaued towards the maximum load of 150 % body weight, when muscle activity was greatest. Electrical stimulation of the plantar intrinsic muscles countered the deformation that occurred owing to the application of external load by reducing the length and increasing the height of the LA. These findings demonstrate that these muscles have the capacity to control foot posture and LA stiffness and may provide a buttressing effect during foot loading. This <b>active</b> <b>arch</b> stiffening mechanism may have important implications for how forces are transmitted during locomotion and postural activities as well as consequences for metabolic energy saving...|$|E

50|$|Before {{the onset}} of mechanization, these horses were used in agriculture, as coach horses, and {{occasionally}} for riding. The closed stud book and careful preservation of female family lines has ensured, {{in an era of}} globalization, the horses of Holstein have a unique character. While the <b>active</b> gaits, <b>arched</b> neck, and attractive manner in harness of the early foundation bloodstock have been retained, the breed survived because of the willingness of its breeders to conform to changing market demands. The high-headed jump and leg faults were corrected with supple, basculing jumping technique and structurally correct improvement sires. In the past 15 or 20 years, even more pronounced refinement and aesthetic appeal have occurred.|$|R
5000|$|The ushers {{who are in}} {{the armed}} forces {{traditionally}} form an [...] "arch of steel" [...] with their swords or sabers. However, only active duty servicemen participate, as they can only carry their sword or saber if they are <b>active</b> duty. The <b>arch</b> is usually formed {{at the conclusion of the}} ceremony, and the head usher signals the formation by yelling [...] "center face." [...] After the bride and groom pass through the arch, the ushers return to their bridesmaids to exit with them. Civilian ushers may or may not stand at the arch, a decision usually made by the bride and groom.|$|R
40|$|Ribosome-associated {{chaperone}} Trigger Factor (TF) initiates folding {{of newly}} synthesized proteins in bacteria. Here, we pinpoint by site-specific crosslinking {{the sequence of}} molecular interactions of Escherichia coli TF and nascent chains during translation. Furthermore, we provide the first full-length structure of TF associated with ribosome -nascent chain complexes by using cryoelectron microscopy. In its <b>active</b> state, TF <b>arches</b> over the ribosomal exit tunnel accepting nascent chains in a protective void. The growing nascent chain initially follows a predefined path through the entire interior of TF in an unfolded conformation, and even after folding into a domain it remains accommodated inside the protective cavity of ribosome-bound TF. The adaptability to accept nascent chains of different length and folding states may explain how TF is able to assist co-translational folding {{of all kinds of}} nascent polypeptides during ongoing synthesis. Moreover, we suggest a model of how TF`s chaperoning function can be coordinated with the co-translational processing and membrane targeting of nascent polypeptides by other ribosome-associated factors...|$|R
