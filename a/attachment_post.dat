40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the problems faced by students in agricultural colleges in Zimbabwe while on industrial/farm <b>attachment,</b> <b>post</b> the land reform programme. The study also sought to establish, among others, the extent to which students from agricultural colleges in Zimbabwe easily accessed placements for industrial attachment and quality of exposure students got. Focus was on students ’ perceptions of the worthiness of the exposure in terms of production technologies involved, type of mentorship and the diversity of activities while on attachment. Snowball sampling technique was used to select 84 third year students from 5 agricultural colleges. Data were collected using a 4 -point Likert scale questionnaire. The study established, among others, that students had difficulties getting places of attachment, A 2 farms provided the bulk of attachment places but the technology levels in the A 2 farms were low. Female students appeared less preferred by mentors when compared to their male counterparts. It was also noted that some students strongly felt they were used as cheap labour during attachment. This study benefits scholars and planners who have a keen interest in industrial attachment procedures for agriculture trainees, especially in developing countries...|$|E
40|$|Continuous {{measurements}} of deformation {{have been made}} in Chino, California across an earth fissure and nearby unfissured soil since 2011 in two buried, horizontal, 150 mm pipes, 51 m long, which are connected by sealed boxes enclosing vertical posts at mostly 6 m intervals. Horizontal displacements and normal strain are measured in one line using nine end-to-end quartz tubes that are attached to posts and span fissured or unfissured soil. The free ends of the tubes are supported by slings and move relative to the <b>attachment</b> <b>post</b> of the next quartz tube. Linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) sensors measure the relative movements. Five biaxial tilt sensors were also attached to selected posts in that line. Relative vertical movement was measured at nine locations along the line in the second pipe using low-level differential pressure sensors. The second pipe is half full of water giving a free water surface along its length. Data are recorded on a Campbell CR 10 using multiplexers. The quartz-tube horizontal extensometers have exhibited more than 3 mm of predominantly elastic opening and closing in response to about 32 m of seasonal drawdown and recovery, respectively, in an observation well 0. 8 km to the south. The nearest production well is 1. 6 km to the west. The horizontal strain was 5. 9 × 10 − 5 or 30...|$|E
40|$|Background: By {{considering}} the daily increase in drug resistance of various viruses, novel antiviral compounds extracted from natural resources – {{due to their}} fewer side effects, had always been important to researchers. In the present study, we investigated antiviral activity of the hot water extract of a green seaweed, Caulerpa sertularioides, collected from coastal water of Bushehr in the Persian Gulf, against Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 (HSV- 1). Methods: The hot water extract of a green seaweed, Caulerpa sertularioides was sterilized by autoclave and filtration methods. After determining its cytotoxic concentration 50 (CC 50) value, {{the effect of the}} extract on the inhibition of HSV- 1 replication was examined in Vero cell culture. Results: The extract showed antiviral activity against HSV- 1 in both attachment and entry of virus to the Vero cells and also on <b>post</b> <b>attachment</b> stages of virus replication. Inhibitory concentration 50 (IC 50) values of the autoclaved extract were 81 µg/ml and 126 µg/ml for <b>attachment</b> and <b>post</b> <b>attachment</b> stages, respectively. IC 50 values of the filtered extract were 73 µg/ml and 104 µg/ml for <b>attachment</b> and <b>post</b> <b>attachment</b> stages, respectively.

This paper presents our study on 3 D printed alginate scaffolds treated with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and polyethyleneimine (PEI) coating and their impacts on the surface morphology and cellular response of the printed scaffolds. In our study, sterile alginate was prepared {{by means of the}} freeze-drying method and then, used to prepare the hydrogel for 3 D printing into calcium chloride, forming 3 D scaffolds. Scaffolds were treated with PBS for a time period of two days and seven days, respectively, and PEI coating; then they were seeded with Schwann cells (RSC 96) for the examination of cellular response (proliferation and differentiation). In addition, swelling and stiffness (Young’s modulus) of the treated scaffolds was evaluated, while their surface morphology was assessed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). SEM images revealed significant changes in scaffold surface morphology due to degradation caused by the PBS treatment over time. Our cell proliferation assessment over seven days showed that a two-day PBS treatment could be more effective than seven-day PBS treatment for improving cell attachment and elongation. While PEI coating of alginate scaffolds seemed to contribute to cell growth, Schwann cells stayed round on the surface of alginate over the period of cell culture. In conclusion, PBS-treatment may offer the potential to induce surface physical cues due to degradation of alginate, which could improve cell <b>attachment</b> <b>post</b> cell-seeding of 3 D-printed alginate scaffolds...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the synthesis of}} functionalised polymeric material by variety of free-radical mediated polymerisation techniques including dispersion emulsion, seeded emulsion, suspension and bulk polymerisation reactions. Organic fluorophores and nanoparticles such as quantum dots were incorporated within polymeric materials, in particular, thiol-functionalised polymer microspheres, which were fluorescently labelled either during synthesis or by covalent <b>attachment</b> <b>post</b> synthesis. The resultant fluorescent polymeric conjugates were then assessed for their utility in biological systems as an analytical tool for cells or biological structures. Quantum dot labelled, thiol-functionalised microspheres were assessed for their utility in the visualisation and tracking of red blood cells. Determination of the possible internalisation of fluorescent microspheres into red blood cells was required before successful tracking of red blood cells could take place. Initial work appeared to indicate the presence of fluorescent microspheres inside red blood cells {{by the process of}} beadfection. A range of parameters were also investigated in order to optimise beadfection. Thiol-functionalised microspheres labelled successfully with organic fluorophores were used to image the tear film of the eye. A description of problems encountered with the covalent attachment of hydrophilic, thiol-reactive fluorescent dyes to a variety of modified polymer microspheres is also included in this section. Results indicated large microspheres were particularly useful when tracking the movement of fluid along the tear meniscus. Functional bulk polymers were synthesised for assessment of their interaction with titanium dioxide nanoparticles. Thiol-functionalised polymethyl methacrylate and spincoated thiouronium-functionalised polystyrene appeared to facilitate the attachment of titanium dioxide nanoparticles. Interaction assays included the use of XPS analysis and processes such as centrifugation. Attempts to synthesise 4 -vinyl catechol, a compound containing hydroxyl moieties with potential for coordination with titanium dioxide nanoparticles, were also carried out using 3, 4 -dihydroxybenzaldehyde as the starting material...|$|E

The literature review describes and appraises twenty four studies investigating {{the relationship between}} adult <b>attachment</b> and <b>post</b> traumatic stress symptoms experienced after traumatic events in adulthood. Thirteen studies focused on combat related trauma samples, four on interpersonal violence related trauma, and seven on specific critical events such as violence at work. Clinical implications of the findings and recommendations for future research are addressed. The research report presents a study investigating whether antenatal adult attachment patterns are related to women's experiences of birth {{and the development of}} acute stress symptoms in women following childbirth. The sample comprised of 58 women recruited between 28 and 36 weeks gestation in the Harrogate area who completed self report questionnaires at two time points. The first questionnaires were completed antenatally to collect demographic information and assess attachment patterns. The second questionnaires were sent within 14 days of giving birth and gathered information about women's experiences of birth. Attachment anxiety was associated with increased acute stress symptoms.

40|$|Steganography {{is the art}} {{of hiding}} {{information}} in ways that prevent its detection. Steganography is usually given as a synonym for cryptography but it is not normally used in that way. It is not intended to replace cryptography but supplement it. Though steganography is an ancient craft, the onset of computer technology has given it new life. Computer-based steganographic techniques introduce changes to digital covers to embed information foreign to the native covers. Such information may be communicated in the form of text, binary files, or provide additional information about the cover and its owner such as digital watermarks or fingerprints. This paper explains a new algorithm which describes how steganography can be combined with cryptography to enhance security in data transfer. Digital images, audio and video files are composed of collections of bits that are translated by their related software into images, sounds or videos. These files contain unused areas or data that is insignificant and can be overwritten. By using this proposed algorithm, we can hide our file of any format in an image. It will not be obvious that the image also contains a secret data in it. We can then send the image via e-mail <b>attachment</b> or <b>post</b> it on the web site and anyone with knowledge that it contains secret information, and who is in possession of the encryption password, will be able to open the file, extract the secret information and decrypt it. This paper aims to outline a general introduction to cryptography and steganography, explains the differences between these two techniques, elucidates the proposed algorithm, and illustrates how security is enhanced using this algorithm...|$|R

Another difference is Facebook's requirement that users give their true identity, a demand that MySpace does not make. MySpace allows users to decorate their profiles using HTML and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), while Facebook allows only plain text. Facebook has a number of features with which users may interact. They include the Wall, a space on every user's profile page that allows friends to post messages for the user to see; Pokes, which allows users to send a virtual [...] "poke" [...] to each other (a notification then tells a user that he or she has been poked); Photos, that allows users to upload albums and photos; and Status, which allows users to inform their friends of their whereabouts and actions. Facebook also allows users to tag various people in photographs. Depending on privacy settings, anyone who can see a user's profile can also view that user's Wall. In July 2007, Facebook began allowing users to <b>post</b> <b>attachments</b> to the Wall, whereas the Wall was previously limited to textual content only. Facebook also differs from Myspace in the form of advertising used. Facebook uses advertising in the form of banner ads, referral marketing, and games. Myspace, on the other hand, uses Google and AdSense. There is also a difference in the userbase of each site. MySpace, initially, was much more popular with high school students, while Facebook was more popular among college students.

HTTL measurements indicate that the peak irradiation temperature for the 300 LO monitor was 295 {+-} 20 C and the peak irradiation temperature for the 400 LO B monitor was 294 {+-} 25 C. Two silicon carbide (SiC) temperature monitors irradiated in the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) were evaluated at the High Temperature Test Lab (HTTL) to determine their peak temperature during irradiation. These monitors were irradiated {{as part of the}} University of Wisconsin Pilot Project with a target dose of 3 dpa. Temperature monitors were fabricated from high density (3. 203 g/cm 3) SiC manufactured by Rohm Haas with a nominal size of 12. 5 mm x 1. 0 mm x 0. 75 mm (see Attachment A). Table 1 provides identification for each monitor with an expected peak irradiation temperature range based on preliminary thermal analysis (see <b>Attachment</b> B). <b>Post</b> irradiation calculations are planned to reduce uncertainties in these calculated temperatures. Since the early 1960 s, SiC {{has been used as a}} post-irradiation temperature monitor. As noted in Reference 2, several researchers have observed that neutron irradiation induced lattice expansion of SiC annealed out when the post-irradiation annealing temperature exceeds the peak irradiation temperature. As noted in Reference 3, INL uses resistivity measurements to infer peak irradiation temperature from SiC monitors. Figure 1 depicts the equipment at the HTTL used to evaluate the SiC monitors. The SiC monitors are heated in the annealing furnace using isochronal temperature steps that, depending on customer needs, can range from 50 to 800 C. This furnace is located under a ventilation hood within the stainless steel enclosure. The ventilation system is activated during heating so that any released vapors are vented through this system. Annealing temperatures are recorded using a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) traceable thermocouple inserted into an alumina tube in the furnace. After each isochronal annealing, the specimens are placed in a specialized fixture located in the constant temperature chamber (maintained at 30 C) for a minimum of 30 minutes. After the 30 minute wait time, each specimen's resistance is measured using the specialized fixture and a calibrated DC power analyzer. This report discusses the evaluation of the SiC monitors and presents the results. Testing was conducted in accordance with Reference 3.

40|$|Cytochromes c are {{electron}} transfer proteins in which haem is covalently {{attached to the}} polypeptide chain via thioether bonds formed from thiol groups of the two cysteines and the two vinyl groups of haem. This <b>attachment</b> is a <b>post</b> translational process and in many species of bacteria as many as approximately twelve gene products, the functions of which are largely unknown, are required. In Gram-negative bacteria the assembly of the c -type cytochromes occurs in the periplasm. Cytochrome c 552 from the thermophilic organism Hydrogenobacter thermophilus {{is known to be}} expressed in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli. This unique example of cytoplasmic assembly of a c -type cytochrome has previously been postulated to result from insertion of haem into the folded apoform of the cytochrome followed by non-catalysed attachment of the haem. This postulate is supported by the present work which has shown that the cytoplasmic assembly of this cytochrome c 552 continues {{in the absence of the}} E. coli ccm genes which are needed for 'normal' c -type cytochrome assembly in that organism. Attempts to test the postulate of spontaneous assembly of the cytochrome c 552 with in vitro experiments require large amounts of cytochrome c 552 and its apo protein. A number of procedures for preparing these proteins were investigated. Although a T 7 -based expression produced lower amounts than was expected, its use led to detection of the apo form of cytochrome c 552 in E. coli. It was shown that this apoform has some secondary structure, whereas mitochondrial apocytochrome c has a random coil conformation. This observation is consistent with, but does not prove, the postulate for cytochrome c 552 assembly. It was unexpectedly found that a strain of E. coli that produces abnormally large amounts of its endogenous c -type cytochromes also made large amounts of cytoplasmic cytochrome c 552. NMR studies on this material are consistent with a single and 'normal' attachment of the haem to the polypeptide. Thus the unusual cytoplasmic assembly was not different from the usual periplasmic assembly that occurs in the H. thermophilus itself. In E. coli there is a periplasmic cytochrome b 562 that is presumed to acquire its haem in the periplasm. Some of the ccm genes, required for c -type cytochrome assembly, are postulated to code for a system that transports haem to the periplasm. Cytochrome b - 562 synthesis was not blocked by the absence of these genes. This implies that haem provision for cytochrome b 562 synthesis occurs independently of the ccm system. Apocytochrome b 562 could be detected in E. coli with the ratio apo:holo being higher in a strain that produces c -type cytochromes to relatively low levels. It is suggested that the synthesis of both cytochrome b 562 and c -type cytochromes is at least partly a reflection of the rate of production of haem by the cells. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} conducted, under {{controlled}} conditions, {{to evaluate the}} level of immunity acquired by rabbits and camels against experimental infestations by adults of Hyalomma dromedarii and H. a. anatolicum after being immunized by a vaccine commercially known as GavacTM. This vaccine was developed in Cuba {{for control of the}} cattle tick Boophilus microplus. The base of this vaccine is a glycoprotein molecule found on the midguts of B. microplus. This molecule was isolated and expressed using a yeast called Pichia pastoris to produce the recombinant form. In this study immunization was carried out following the manufacturer’s recommendations as follows; initial dose on week (0), first booster on week (4) and second booster on week (7). Immunization of rabbits and camels with this vaccine induced a significant degree of protection against experimental infestation by adults of H. dromedarii and H. a. anatolicum compared with the control groups. Acquired immunity developed by this vaccine was assessed by monitoring tick developmental performances of ticks fed on immunized hosts compared with those fed on the control groups. The study showed that biological parameters of ticks fed on the immunized group were significantly affected by the vaccine through the antibodies which were produced in response to immunization by Bm 86 antigen. Resistance acquired was expressed as reduction in mean engorgement weights, mean egg mass weights, hatchability percentages and prolongation of feeding periods, preoviposition periods, oviposition periods of tick females fed on immunized animals. This finding indicates that this vaccine may be effectively incorporated in tick control programmes. Monitoring of humoral response after vaccination was carried out using ELISA to compare serum samples collected from the experimental and control groups after the second booster. Despite homogeneity of response within each species of animals, results of ELISA (after cut-off determination) revealed that the hosts responded to the vaccine and produced high levels of antibodies against the antigen yielding mean optical density 0. 22 and 0. 46 for vaccinated rabbits and camels respectively. However, control groups show mean optical densities reaching 0. 06 and 0. 095 for rabbits and camels respectively. XIII To follow up the dynamics of produced antibodies, serum samples were collected following the vaccination schedule (weeks 0, 4 and 7), but prior to vaccine injection, beside these, samples on weeks 9 and 13 of the experiment were also collected. Rabbits’ antibody levels reached a peak on week 4 and another peak 6 weeks after the second booster, while camels started to respond after the first booster and antibody levels reached a peak 2 weeks after the second booster of the vaccine and then started to decline 4 weeks later (week 13). Histopathological sections of attachment sites 96 hours <b>post</b> <b>attachment,</b> of H. dromedarii and H. a. anatolicum on immunized rabbits compared with those taken from non-immunized ones, revealed no specific inflammatory cell types associated with sensitization with Bm 86 antigen. This observation probably indicates that the results obtained from vaccination trials might be totally attributed to the effect of the Bm 86 molecule. On other hand, this finding may indicate that cell-mediate immunity may act separately act depending on factors such as tick species, host species and degree of exposure. Future investigations on the relation between humoral and cellular immunity may be needed on this aspects...|$|R
