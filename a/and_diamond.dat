5|$|Atomic carbon {{is a very}} {{short-lived}} species and, therefore, carbon is stabilized {{in various}} multi-atomic structures with different molecular configurations called allotropes.

5|$|Because of {{scheduling}} issues, Rucka and Lark {{were behind}} on the series from the start.

During the hiatus, they released a sourcebook providing additional, non-essential background on the Carlyle family. Despite the break, five months passed between the fourth and fifth chapters of the Cull arc. A second sourcebook detailing the Hock Family was released in April 2017.|$|E

This realm of work promoted Van Rensselaer {{to a life of}} economic success.|$|E
