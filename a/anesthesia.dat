5|$|General <b>anesthesia</b> {{is often}} {{administered}} without tracheal intubation in selected {{cases where the}} procedure is brief in duration, or procedures where the depth of <b>anesthesia</b> {{is not sufficient to}} cause significant compromise in ventilatory function. Even for longer duration or more invasive procedures, a general anesthetic may be administered without intubating the trachea, provided that patients are carefully selected, and the risk-benefit ratio is favorable (i.e., the risks associated with an unprotected airway are believed to be less than the risks of intubating the trachea).|$|E
5|$|A pudendal nerve block, {{also known}} as a saddle nerve block, is a local <b>anesthesia</b> {{technique}} used in a obstetric procedure to anesthetize the perineum during labor. In this procedure, an anesthetic agent such as lidocaine is injected through the inner wall of the vagina about the pudendal nerve.|$|E
5|$|Laubenstein {{developed}} appendicitis in 1984 and {{was afraid}} to undergo surgery {{because of the risk}} that general <b>anesthesia</b> would pose to her lungs, already compromised from polio. After the operation, her surgeons had trouble weaning her off the ventilator and she suffered a psychotic breakdown requiring admission to a psychiatric hospital; the psychiatrists theorized that her hallucinations were caused by hypoxia from the <b>anesthesia.</b> In 1990, she fell ill with a combination of asthma, gastroenteritis and respiratory failure, though she continued to work. She started taking corticosteroids for her respiratory problems—which were exacerbated by allergies to her two pet cats—and was unable to wean herself off them despite experiencing side effects.|$|E
5|$|Methoxyflurane has a {{very high}} lipid {{solubility}} (oil:gas partition coefficient of around 950), which gives it very slow pharmacokinetics (induction and emergence characteristics); this being undesirable for routine application in the clinical setting. Initial studies performed in 1961 revealed that in unpremedicated healthy individuals, induction of general <b>anesthesia</b> with methoxyflurane-oxygen alone or with nitrous oxide was difficult or even impossible using the vaporizers available at that time. It {{was found to be}} necessary to administer an intravenous anesthetic agent such as sodium thiopental to ensure a smooth and rapid induction. It was further found that after thiopental induction, it was necessary to administer nitrous oxide for at least ten minutes before a sufficient amount of methoxyflurane could accumulate in the bloodstream to ensure an adequate level of <b>anesthesia.</b> This was despite using high flow (liters/minute) of nitrous oxide and oxygen, and with the vaporizers delivering the maximum possible concentration of methoxyflurane.|$|E
5|$|Recurrent {{rhabdomyolysis}} {{may result}} from intrinsic muscle enzyme deficiencies, which are usually inherited and often appear during childhood. Many structural muscle diseases feature episodes of rhabdomyolysis that are triggered by exercise, general <b>anesthesia</b> {{or any of the}} other causes of rhabdomyolysis listed above. Inherited muscle disorders and infections together cause the majority of rhabdomyolysis in children.|$|E
5|$|The Twenty-fifth Amendment {{has been}} invoked six times since its ratification. The first three times were {{applications}} of Sections 1 and 2 {{in the context}} of scandals surrounding the Nixon Administration. The latter three were applications of Section 3 regarding Presidents undergoing a medical procedure requiring general <b>anesthesia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Xenon {{has been}} used as a general anesthetic. Although it is expensive, <b>anesthesia</b> {{machines}} that can deliver xenon are expected to appear on the European market because advances in recovery and recycling of xenon have made it economically viable.|$|E
5|$|According to the USDA, in 2016 501,560 animals (61%) (not {{including}} rats, mice, birds, or invertebrates) {{were used}} in procedures that did not include more than momentary pain or distress. 247,882 (31%) animals {{were used in}} procedures in which pain or distress was relieved by <b>anesthesia,</b> while 71,370 (9%) were used in studies that would cause pain or distress {{that would not be}} relieved.|$|E
5|$|Being a brachycephalic breed, King Charles Spaniels can be {{sensitive}} to <b>anesthesia.</b> This is because in brachycephalic dogs, there is additional tissue in the throat directly behind the mouth and nasal cavity, known as the pharynx, and <b>anesthesia</b> acts as a muscle relaxant causing this tissue to obstruct the dogs' narrow airways. These narrow airways can decrease the dogs' ability to exercise properly and increase their susceptibility to heat stroke. Other congenital and hereditary disorders found in the King Charles Spaniel are hanging tongue, where a neurological defect prevents the tongue from retracting into the mouth; diabetes mellitus, which {{may be associated with}} cataracts; cleft palate and umbilical hernia. The English Toy Spaniel Club of America recommends that umbilical hernias be corrected only if other surgery is required, due to the risk of surgery in brachycephalic breeds. In another study conducted by the OFA, the King Charles Spaniel was the 38th worst of 99 breeds for patella luxation; of 75 animals tested, 4% were found to have the ailment. However, surveys conducted by the Finnish breed club between 1988 and 2007 found that the occurrences were higher in some years, ranging from 5.3% to 50%.|$|E
5|$|By 1918, the Army {{realized}} that there was a shortage of physicians specializing in <b>anesthesia,</b> a low salary specialty required in the military operating rooms. Therefore, the Army reluctantly began hiring women physicians as civilian contract employees. The first Puerto Rican woman doctor to serve in the Army under contract was Dr. Dolores Piñero from San Juan. She was assigned to the San Juan base hospital where she worked as an anesthesiologist during the mornings and in the laboratory during the afternoons.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1980s, the {{flexible}} fiberoptic bronchoscope {{had become an}} indispensable instrument within the pulmonology and <b>anesthesia</b> communities. The digital revolution of the 21st century has brought newer technology to the art and science of tracheal intubation. Several manufacturers have developed video laryngoscopes which employ digital technology such as the CMOS active pixel sensor (CMOS APS) to generate {{a view of the}} glottis so that the trachea may be intubated.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} intelligence, {{octopuses}} {{are listed in}} some countries as experimental animals on which surgery may not be performed without <b>anesthesia,</b> a protection usually extended only to vertebrates. In the UK from 1993 to 2012, the common octopus (Octopus vulgaris) was the only invertebrate protected under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. In 2012, this legislation was extended to include all cephalopods in accordance with a general EU directive.|$|E
5|$|For instance, a 2008 {{study of}} medical systems in Zambia {{published}} by the International <b>Anesthesia</b> Research Society found that only 50 percent of hospitals had an emergency medical system that transported patients. Just 24 percent of ambulances carried oxygen, with only 40 percent carrying drugs of any kind. Furthermore, only 29 intensive care beds were available {{in all of the}} hospitals surveyed, and these were only found in major hospitals. This implies that the majority of critically ill patients are receiving care in general hospital wards.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, the German surgeon Friedrich Trendelenburg (1844–1924) {{published}} a paper describing {{the first successful}} elective human tracheotomy to be performed {{for the purpose of}} administration of general <b>anesthesia.</b> In 1888, Sir Morell Mackenzie (1837–1892) {{published a}} book discussing the indications for tracheotomy. In the early 20th century, tracheotomy became a life-saving treatment for patients afflicted with paralytic poliomyelitis who required mechanical ventilation. In 1909, Philadelphia laryngologist Chevalier Jackson (1865–1958) described a technique for tracheotomy that is used to this day.|$|E
5|$|In {{a series}} of 500 {{consecutive}} obstetric patients, Boisvert and Hudon observed vomiting in 12 (4.8%) patients during or after administration of methoxyflurane <b>anesthesia.</b> These findings compared favorably with those reported for cyclopropane (42%), trichloroethylene (28%) and halothane (4.6%). In another study of 645 obstetric patients, Romagnoli and Korman observed 8 cases (1.2%) of postoperative vomiting, {{one of whom was}} retching before the administration of the anesthetic.|$|E
5|$|Male {{circumcision}} is {{the removal}} of the foreskin from the human penis. In the most common procedure, the foreskin is opened, adhesions are removed, and the foreskin is separated from the glans. After that, a circumcision device may be placed and then the foreskin is cut off. Topical or locally injected <b>anesthesia</b> is used to reduce pain and physiologic stress. For adults and children, general <b>anesthesia</b> is an option and the procedure may be performed without a specialized circumcision device. The procedure is most often an elective surgery performed on babies and children for religious or cultural reasons. In other cases it may be done as a treatment for certain medical conditions or for preventative reasons. Medically it is a treatment option for problematic cases of phimosis, balanoposthitis that does not resolve with other treatments, and chronic urinary tract infections (UTIs). It is contraindicated in cases of certain genital structure abnormalities or poor general health.|$|E
5|$|Methods of euthanizing {{laboratory}} {{animals are}} chosen to induce rapid unconsciousness and death without pain or distress. The methods that are preferred are those published by councils of veterinarians. The animal {{can be made}} to inhale a gas, such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, by being placed in a chamber, or by use of a face mask, with or without prior sedation or <b>anesthesia.</b> Sedatives or anesthetics such as barbiturates can be given intravenously, or inhalant anesthetics may be used. Amphibians and fish may be immersed in water containing an anesthetic such as tricaine. Physical methods are also used, with or without sedation or <b>anesthesia</b> depending on the method. Recommended methods include decapitation (beheading) for small rodents or rabbits. Cervical dislocation (breaking the neck or spine) may be used for birds, mice, and immature rats and rabbits. Maceration (grinding into small pieces) is used on 1 day old chicks. High-intensity microwave irradiation of the brain can preserve brain tissue and induce death in less than 1 second, but this is currently only used on rodents. Captive bolts may be used, typically on dogs, ruminants, horses, pigs and rabbits. It causes death by a concussion to the brain. Gunshot may be used, but only in cases where a penetrating captive bolt may not be used. Some physical methods are only acceptable after the animal is unconscious. Electrocution may be used for cattle, sheep, swine, foxes, and mink after the animals are unconscious, often by a prior electrical stun. Pithing (inserting a tool into the base of the brain) is usable on animals already unconscious. Slow or rapid freezing, or inducing air embolism are acceptable only with prior <b>anesthesia</b> to induce unconsciousness.|$|E
5|$|On January 7, 1989, Reagan {{underwent}} surgery at Walter Reed Army Medical Center {{to repair a}} Dupuytren's contracture of the ring finger of his left hand. The surgery lasted {{for more than three}} hours and was performed under regional <b>anesthesia.</b> This procedure was done just thirteen days before he left office. For this reason he had a hand and finger bandage the day of his farewell speech and the day of the inauguration of George H. W. Bush.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} common {{indication}} for tracheal intubation is for the placement of a conduit through which nitrous oxide or volatile anesthetics may be administered. General anesthetic agents, opioids, and neuromuscular-blocking drugs may diminish or even abolish the respiratory drive. Although {{it is not the}} only means to maintain a patent airway during general <b>anesthesia,</b> intubation of the trachea provides the most reliable means of oxygenation and ventilation and the greatest degree of protection against regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration.|$|E
5|$|Xenon gas can {{be safely}} kept in normal sealed glass or metal {{containers}} at standard temperature and pressure. However, it readily dissolves in most plastics and rubber, and will gradually escape from a container sealed with such materials. Xenon is non-toxic, although it does dissolve in blood and belongs to {{a select group of}} substances that penetrate the blood–brain barrier, causing mild to full surgical <b>anesthesia</b> when inhaled in high concentrations with oxygen.|$|E
25|$|Local <b>anesthesia</b> of body {{cavities}} includes intrapleural <b>anesthesia</b> and intra-articular <b>anesthesia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Depending on the circumstances, {{alternatives}} to brachial plexus block may include general <b>anesthesia,</b> monitored <b>anesthesia</b> care, Bier block, or local <b>anesthesia.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Anesthesia,</b> {{an award-winning}} horror film about <b>anesthesia</b> awareness.|$|E
25|$|General <b>anesthesia</b> may be {{necessary}} because of specific risks to mother or child. Patients with heavy, uncontrolled bleeding may not tolerate the hemodynamic effects of regional <b>anesthesia.</b> General <b>anesthesia</b> is also preferred in very urgent cases, such as severe fetal distress, {{when there is no}} time to perform a regional <b>anesthesia.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Anesthesia</b> {{awareness}} {{occurs when}} general <b>anesthesia</b> is inadequately maintained, {{for a number}} of reasons. Typically, <b>anesthesia</b> is 'induced' with an intravenous drug, but 'maintained' with an inhaled anesthetic given by the anesthesiologist (note that several other methods safely and effectively maintaining <b>anesthesia).</b> Barbiturates are used only for induction of <b>anesthesia</b> and these drugs rapidly and reliably induce <b>anesthesia,</b> but wear off quickly. A neuromuscular blocking drug may then be given to cause paralysis which facilitates intubation, although this is not always required. The anesthesiologist has the responsibility to ensure that the maintenance technique (typically inhalational) is started soon after induction to prevent the patient from waking up.|$|E
25|$|Local anesthetics {{can block}} almost every nerve between the {{peripheral}} nerve endings {{and the central}} nervous system. The most peripheral technique is topical <b>anesthesia</b> to the skin or other body surface. Small and large peripheral nerves can be anesthetized individually (peripheral nerve block) or in anatomic nerve bundles (plexus <b>anesthesia).</b> Spinal <b>anesthesia</b> and epidural <b>anesthesia</b> merge into the central nervous system.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to <b>anesthesia,</b> analgesia is often managed by anesthesiologists or {{is included in}} the considerations for <b>anesthesia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} first use of cocaine for topical <b>anesthesia,</b> blocks on {{peripheral}} nerves were described. Brachial plexus <b>anesthesia</b> by percutaneous injection through axillary and supraclavicular approaches {{was developed in the}} early 20th century. The search for the most effective and least traumatic approach for plexus <b>anesthesia</b> and peripheral nerve blocks continues to this day. In recent decades, continuous regional <b>anesthesia</b> using catheters and automatic pumps has evolved as a method of pain therapy.|$|E
25|$|First-trimester {{procedures}} can {{generally be}} performed using local <b>anesthesia,</b> while second-trimester methods may require deep sedation or general <b>anesthesia.</b>|$|E
25|$|The first {{comprehensive}} medical textbook on the subject, <b>Anesthesia,</b> was authored in 1914 by anesthesiologist Dr. James Tayloe Gwathmey and the chemist Dr. Charles Baskerville. This book {{served as}} the standard reference for the specialty for decades and included details {{on the history of}} <b>anesthesia</b> as well as the physiology and techniques of inhalation, rectal, intravenous, and spinal <b>anesthesia.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{circumstances}} when <b>anesthesia</b> {{needs to be}} altered for special circumstances due to the procedure (such as in cardiac surgery, cardiothoracic anesthesiology or neurosurgery), the patient (such as in pediatric <b>anesthesia,</b> geriatric, bariatric or obstetrical <b>anesthesia)</b> or special circumstances (such as in trauma, prehospital care, robotic surgery or extreme environments).|$|E
25|$|These persons after obtaining {{secondary}} school diploma and passing university's entrance exam and completing 2 years program in <b>Anesthesia,</b> {{are in charge}} of performing profession duties in the operating room in the field of <b>anesthesia</b> including preparing the patients for <b>anesthesia</b> and necessary cooperation with anesthesiologists at the time of operation. These persons by passing exam are eligible to continue uncontinuous bachelor's degree course in nursing.|$|E
25|$|The first {{hospital}} <b>anesthesia</b> {{department was}} {{established at the}} Massachusetts General Hospital in 1936, {{under the leadership of}} Henry K. Beecher (1904–1976). Beecher, who received his training in surgery, had no previous experience in <b>anesthesia.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{incidence}} of <b>anesthesia</b> awareness is higher {{and has more}} serious sequelae when muscle relaxants or neuromuscular-blocking drugs are used. This is because without relaxant the patient will move and the anesthesiologist will deepen the <b>anesthesia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Crawford Long, of Jefferson, Georgia, {{performed}} the first operation using his development of ether-based <b>anesthesia,</b> when he removed a tumor {{from the neck}} of Mr. James Venable. Long did not reveal the practicality of using ether <b>anesthesia</b> until 1849.|$|E
25|$|NMDA {{receptor}} antagonists are a {{class of}} anesthetics that work to antagonize, or inhibit the action of, the N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). They are used as anesthetics for animals including humans; the state of <b>anesthesia</b> they induce {{is referred to as}} dissociative <b>anesthesia.</b>|$|E
