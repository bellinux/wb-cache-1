5|$|Dickinson {{completed}} {{one of five}} {{passes for}} 15yards in his first professional game against the Houston Oilers after coming in for Spurrier late in the game. The following week, the Buccaneers faced the San Diego Chargers. In that game, Dickinson again came into the game, rushing three times for 54yards <b>and</b> <b>throwing</b> an interception that was returned by Tom Hayes for a touchdown. He did not play against the Buffalo Bills the following week, but Spurrier ended up getting injured, meaning that Dickinson was slated to possibly get his first NFL start against the Baltimore Colts. Spurrier ended up starting the game, but Dickinson did see playing time against the Colts, completing one of five passes for 12yards <b>and</b> <b>throwing</b> an interception in a 4217 loss; he attempted only one pass the following week {{in a game against}} the Cincinnati Bengals.|$|E
5|$|In wine making, the {{delicate}} {{nature of the}} Riesling grape requires special handling during harvesting to avoid crushing or bruising the skin. Without this care, the broken skins could leak tannin into the juice, giving a markedly coarse taste <b>and</b> <b>throwing</b> off balance the Riesling's range of flavors and aromas.|$|E
5|$|Pennock {{attended}} Westtown School and Cedarcroft Boarding School, {{where he}} played for the baseball team. After struggling as a first baseman, with a weak offensive output <b>and</b> <b>throwing</b> arm that resulted in curved throws, his Cedarcroft coach converted Pennock into a pitcher.|$|E
50|$|Oldham batted right <b>and</b> <b>threw</b> left-handed, {{which was}} itself unusual: as of 2015, only 553 players in MLB history (about 3% of all players) hit right <b>and</b> <b>threw</b> left, with Hall of Famer Rickey Henderson {{probably}} the best known.|$|R

5|$|After Iso died in 1881, Kanō began {{training}} in Kitō-ryū with Iikubo Tsunetoshi (Kōnen). Iikubo was expert in kata <b>and</b> <b>throwing,</b> and fond of randori. Kanō applied himself thoroughly to learning Kitō-ryū, believing Iikubo's throwing techniques {{in particular to}} be better than in the schools he had previously studied. It is Iikubo who issued Kanō's only verified jūjutsu rank and teaching credential, namely a certificate of Menkyo (not Menkyo kaiden) in Nihonden Kitō Jūdō, dated October 1883.|$|E
5|$|Descended {{from the}} Anglo-Italian Taliaferro colonists in 17th-century Virginia, Tolliver {{was born in}} Boyd, Texas, where he {{attended}} local schools. He played high school football at Boyd High School. During his senior season, he led the Boyd Yellow Jackets to a 15–0–1 record and the 2–A state championship. He amassed more than 1,000 rushing and passing yards and was named Player of the Year by the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. Tolliver was a three–sport athlete in high school, averaging 15 points and 17 rebounds in basketball <b>and</b> <b>throwing</b> 14 no-hitters in baseball.|$|E
5|$|Hazel Levesque: Demigod {{daughter}} of Pluto. When Argo II was prevented from crossing the Apennines by Ourae, {{she met with}} Hecate, who showed her a northern path to travel, with the condition that Hazel would learn to use the Mist. At the Doors of Death, she uses the Mist against Pasiphaë, recreating the Labyrinth of Daedalus <b>and</b> <b>throwing</b> the sorceress into an imaginary abyss. She also defeats the giant Clytius {{with the help of}} Hecate.|$|E

5|$|Pod is {{the debut}} album by the American {{alternative}} rock band the Breeders, released on 4AD in May 1990. The group {{began when the}} Pixies' Kim Deal <b>and</b> <b>Throwing</b> Muses' Tanya Donelly became friends in 1988 and decided {{they would like to}} create music together. Abandoning their initial idea of focusing on dance music, they recorded a country-influenced demo with musicians including violinist Carrie Bradley and bassist Ray Holiday in 1989. When 4AD cofounder Ivo Watts-Russell heard the demo, he offered them money to re-record the songs for an album release.|$|E
5|$|Texas A {{defeated}} Oklahoma 41–13 {{to win the}} Cotton Bowl Classic and {{to finish}} the season with an 11–2 record. Manziel rushed for 229 yards during the game, a bowl record, rushing for two touchdowns <b>and</b> <b>throwing</b> for two more. Though the halftime score was 14–13 Texas A, the Aggies went on to score 27 unanswered second half points to win the game.|$|E
5|$|That the {{practice}} of sewing murderers of their parents in sacks <b>and</b> <b>throwing</b> them in the water was still an active type of punishment at Cicero's time, {{at least on the}} provincial level, is made clear within a preserved letter Marcus wrote to his own brother Quintus, who as governor in Asia Minor in the 50s BCE had, in fact, meted out that precise punishment to two locals in Smyrna, as Marcus observes.|$|E
50|$|Many {{baseball}} players, such as Ken Griffey Jr., Steve Carlton, and Barry Bonds, bat <b>and</b> <b>throw</b> left-handed {{while writing}} right-handed.

5|$|The 250 {{officers}} from Wandsworth Police lining the embankments {{were able to}} replace their traditional helmets for peaked caps for the first time, in order to discourage members of the crowd from removing them <b>and</b> <b>throwing</b> them into the river.

5|$|The {{context-sensitive}} button mechanic {{allows one}} button {{to serve a}} variety of functions, such as talking, opening doors, and pushing, pulling, <b>and</b> <b>throwing</b> objects. The on-screen display shows what action, if any, the button will trigger, determined by the situation. For example, if Link is holding a rock, the context-sensitive button will cause Link to throw the rock if he is moving or targeting an object or enemy, or place the rock on the ground if he is standing still.|$|E
5|$|The years 904–906 saw {{the use of}} {{incendiary}} projectiles called 'flying fires' (fei-huo). Needham (1986) {{argues that}} gunpowder was first used in warfare in China in 919 as a fuse for the ignition of another incendiary, Greek fire. Initially, gunpowder mixtures were utilised through traditional engines <b>and</b> <b>throwing</b> mechanisms; containers and grenades were thrown by mangonels and trebuchets, and explosive rockets and arrows were developed, along with gunpowder flamethrowers.|$|E

500|$|It is more {{accurate}} to say Mayor Magee threw out the first ball. He was in the second tier <b>and</b> <b>threw</b> the ball to John M. Morin, Director of Public Safety, on the field below.

5|$|There are {{a limited}} number of effects and, aside from brief {{ballpark}} jingles, there is no real background music present during the game. For example, the charge fanfare is played at random points and the introductory screen begins with a different baseball tune while the player is loading up and selecting his team, along with a home run fanfare. Generic sound effects include the bat cracking upon contact with the ball, the sound of the ball flying through the air during a pitch, bouncing <b>and</b> <b>throwing</b> effects, and a stream of crowd noises.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} modes {{that can be}} played with teams from either the American League or the National League: regular season games, All-star games or the World Series (interleague). The World Series rounds, however, are only one match each, which is not {{accurate}} to the real World Series. Due to the licensing, the teams even appear complete in their official uniforms and colours and also have all the options that a real baseball player would have, including bunting, pitching out, base stealing <b>and</b> <b>throwing</b> errors.|$|E
5|$|Track {{and field}} is a sport which {{includes}} athletic contests established on {{the skills of}} running, jumping, <b>and</b> <b>throwing.</b> The name {{is derived from the}} sport's typical venue: a stadium with an oval running track enclosing a grass field where the throwing and jumping events take place. Track and field is categorised under the umbrella sport of athletics, which also includes road running, cross country running, and race walking.|$|E

5|$|A {{photo of}} a dazed Tittle {{in the end zone}} taken by Morris Berman of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on September 20, 1964, is {{regarded}} among the most iconic images in the history of American sports and journalism. Tittle, in his 17th and final season, was photographed helmet-less, bloodied and kneeling immediately after having been knocked to the ground by John Baker of the Pittsburgh Steelers <b>and</b> <b>throwing</b> an interception that was returned for a touchdown at the old Pitt Stadium. He suffered a concussion and cracked sternum on the play, but went on to play the rest of the season.|$|E
5|$|A rarely {{enforced}} 1958 law— {{known as}} Decree Number 10— was invoked in May 1963 to prohibit {{the display of}} religious flags. This disallowed the flying of the Buddhist flag on Vesak, the birthday of Gautama Buddha. The application of the law caused indignation among Buddhists {{on the eve of}} the most important religious festival of the year, as a week earlier Catholics had been encouraged to display Vatican flags at a government-sponsored celebration for Diem's brother, Archbishop Pierre Martin Ngô Đình Thục, the most senior Catholic cleric in the country. On 8 May in Huế, a crowd of Buddhists protested against the ban on the Buddhist flag. The police and army broke up the demonstration by firing guns at <b>and</b> <b>throwing</b> grenades into the gathering, leaving nine people dead.|$|E
5|$|As an {{implement}} {{of war and}} hunting, javelin throwing began in prehistoric times. Along with the discus, the javelin was the second throwing event in the ancient Olympic pentathlon. Records from 708 BC show two javelin competition types co-existing: throwing at a target <b>and</b> <b>throwing</b> the javelin for distance. It was the latter type from which the modern event derives. In ancient competitions, athletes would wrap an ankyle (thin leather strip) around the javelin that acted as a sling to facilitate extra distance. The javelin throw gained much popularity in Scandinavia in the late 19th century and athletes from the region are still among the most dominant throwers in men's competitions. The modern event features a short run up on a track and then the thrower releases the javelin before the foul line.|$|E
