5|$|Completion of the -long Wawona Tunnel in 1933 {{significantly}} reduced travel time to Yosemite Valley from Wawona. The famous Tunnel View {{is on the}} valley side of the tunnel and Old Inspiration Point is above it. A flood, reduced lumber and mining extraction, and greatly increased <b>automobile</b> <b>and</b> bus use forced the Yosemite Valley Railway {{out of business in}} 1945. The present day Tioga Road, now part of California State Route 120, was dedicated in 1961.|$|E
5|$|The Interstate grew quickly, {{along with}} the {{automobile}} industry, allowing a new-found mobility that permeated ways of American life and culture. The <b>automobile</b> <b>and</b> the Interstate became the American symbol of individuality and freedom, and, for the first time, automobile buyers accepted that the automobile they drove indicated their social standing and level of affluence. It became a statement of their personality and an extension of their self-concepts.|$|E
50|$|The bicycle {{manufacturer}} Maskinfabriks-aktiebolaget Scania in Malmö started producing <b>automobiles</b> <b>and</b> {{trucks in}} 1902.

5|$|Titanium metal {{is used in}} {{automotive}} applications, {{particularly in}} <b>automobile</b> <b>and</b> motorcycle racing where low weight and high strength and rigidity are critical. The metal is generally too expensive for the general consumer market, though some late model Corvettes have been manufactured with titanium exhausts, and a Corvette Z06's LT4 supercharged engine uses lightweight, solid titanium intake valves for greater strength and resistance to heat.|$|E
5|$|Mouton {{debuted in}} {{rallying}} as a co-driver but quickly {{moved to the}} driver's seat, steering an Alpine-Renault A110 in national rallies. In 1975, she competed in circuit racing and won the two-litre prototype class in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. After being signed by Fiat France for 1977, Mouton finished runner-up to Bernard Darniche in the European Rally Championship. She {{went on to win}} the 1978 Tour de France <b>Automobile</b> <b>and</b> record consistent results in her home events in the WRC; the Tour de Corse and the Monte Carlo Rally. For 1981, Audi Sport signed Mouton to partner Hannu Mikkola. In her first year with the Audi Quattro, she took a surprise victory at the Rallye Sanremo.|$|E
5|$|The Indianapolis Motor Speedway complex {{was built}} in 1909, inaugurating {{a new era in}} history. Most Indiana cities within 200 miles of Detroit became part of the giant {{automobile}} industry after 1910. The Indianapolis speedway was a venue for auto companies to show off their products. The Indianapolis 500 quickly became the standard in auto racing as European and American companies competed to build the fastest <b>automobile</b> <b>and</b> win at the track. Industrial and technological industries thrived during this era, George Kingston developed an early carburetor in 1902; in 1912, Elwood Haynes received a patent for stainless steel.|$|E

5|$|The Panic of 1893 had a {{severely}} {{negative effect on}} the Hoosier economy when many factories closed and several railroads declared bankruptcy. The Pullman Strike of 1894 hurt the Chicago area and coal miners in southern Indiana participated in a national strike. Hard times were not limited to industry; farmers also felt a financial pinch from falling prices. The economy began to recover when World War I broke out in Europe, creating a higher demand for American goods. Despite economic setbacks, advances in industrial technology continued throughout the last years of the 19th and into the 20th century. On July 4, 1894, Elwood Haynes successfully road tested his first <b>automobile,</b> <b>and</b> opened the Haynes-Apperson auto company in 1896. In 1895, William Johnson invented a process for casting aluminum.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} may not detain an individual even momentarily without reasonable and articulable suspicion, {{with a few}} exceptions. In Delaware v. Prouse (1979), the Court ruled an officer has made an illegal seizure when he stops an <b>automobile</b> <b>and</b> detains the driver in order to check his driver's license and the registration of the automobile, unless the officer has articulable and reasonable suspicion that a motorist is unlicensed or that an automobile is not registered, or either the vehicle or an occupant is otherwise subject to seizure for violation of law.|$|E
5|$|Widespread {{blizzard}} conditions wrought {{havoc on}} transportation; streets and highways throughout the hardest-hit areas were clogged with stalled and abandoned vehicles, and multiple major airports {{were forced to}} close. Many schools and businesses were closed, some for days after the storm departed. The New York Stock Exchange opened an hour late on December 12, marking its first delayed opening in over 25years. Extensive drifting of snow left communities isolated and unable to receive deliveries of food and heating fuel. Overall, the storm and subsequent cold snap were blamed for at least 286deaths across a wide area, but primarily in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and the New England states. The fatalities resulted from a multitude of tragedies, including <b>automobile</b> <b>and</b> maritime accidents, storm-related fires, carbon monoxide poisoning, over-exertion, and exposure to cold.|$|E

5|$|The {{additional}} turbo-propulseur {{patent application}} 13.502, dated 3 December 1910, was implemented on a double-seat motorised sled commissioned by Cyril Vladimirovich, Grand Duke of Russia. With {{the help of}} Despujols, a boat maker, and the motor manufacturer Gregoire, Coandă supervised {{the building of a}} motor sled, powered by a 30hp (22kW) Gregoire engine driving the turbo-propulseur. The sledge was blessed by Russian Orthodox priests at the Despujols plant near Paris on 2 December 1910. Starting the next day, it was exhibited for two weeks at the 12th Automobile Salon of France, alongside Gregoire-powered automobiles on the Gregoire stand. A number of <b>automobile</b> <b>and</b> general interest magazines published photographs or sketches of the sledge. A version of Coandă's turbo-propulseur design was shown {{for the second time in}} late 1910 at the Grand Palais of Paris. One of the periodicals reported an expected speed of , but no account exists of the sledge being tested.|$|E
5|$|The {{city has}} started {{moving away from}} the <b>automobile</b> <b>and</b> towards mass transit. From 2004 to 2009, the annual number of unlinked public {{transportation}} trips increased by approximately 21%. In 2006, voters in King County passed proposition 2 (Transit Now) which increased bus service hours on high ridership routes and paid for five bus rapid transit lines called RapidRide. After rejecting a roads and transit measure in 2007, Seattle-area voters passed a transit only measure in 2008 to increase ST Express bus service, extend the Link light rail system, and expand and improve Sounder commuter rail service. A light rail line from downtown heading south to Sea-Tac Airport began service on December 19, 2009, giving the city its first rapid transit line with intermediate stations within the city limits. An extension north to the University of Washington opened on March 19, 2016; and further extensions are planned to reach Lynnwood to the north, Des Moines to the south, and Bellevue and Redmond to the east by 2023. Voters in the Puget Sound region approved an additional tax increase in November 2016 to expand light rail to West Seattle and Ballard as well as Tacoma, Everett, and Issaquah.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins on}} a city {{sidewalk}} where Scherzinger walks into a telephone booth as several men in black suits pass by the booth. As Scherzinger begins to undress, the men stop to stare as she begins taking off her glasses and shaking her hair back. The video then moves to Scherzinger in a dress walking past four men mopping the floor to a supply closet where she enters and reappears moments later, {{dressed in a black}} body suit with a cape. As the chorus begins, the situation rapidly switches back-and-forth from Scherzinger in her good-girl persona shown fighting escaped jail prisoners dressed in striped suits (and Beagle Boys masks) to Scherzinger in her bad-girl persona fighting with police. As the song progresses, Scherzinger is shown in a classic looking <b>automobile</b> <b>and</b> riding a BMW motorcycle, with a streaking white and black background. Several shots of her bad-girl persona alone in a room with two prisoners are then shown. As the bridge begins, she is shown in her good-girl ego standing by a podium, talking to a group of reporters while waving her hands in the air. As the bridge ends, she brings her hands down, blowing back all of the reporters, who then begin dancing and pumping their arms to the song. The video moves to Scherzinger dancing with the police and prisoners before ending with her blowing away the two men who were in the room with her and walking away.|$|E
