5000|$|There are {{numerous}} factors {{as to why}} some raw materials would be chosen over others and can result {{in the use of}} low <b>quality</b> <b>materials.</b> A few examples of such factors include the availability of materials, the proximity to <b>materials,</b> and the <b>quality</b> of <b>materials.</b> To help understand this, archaeologists have applied models of risk management to stone artifacts. Theories have suggested that in times of high risk, more effort will be put into acquiring high <b>quality</b> <b>material</b> that is more reliable and can be maintained over longer periods of time. In times of low risk, lower <b>quality</b> <b>materials</b> may be acquired from closer sources. [...] However, Mackay and Marwick (2011) found that this pattern does not always hold true in their application of this theory to the South African Pleistocene record. [...] They then used computer simulations to understand why the relationship between the time put into producing technology and subsistence acquisition would produce the patterns they saw. Mackay and Marwick found that when less time was put into acquiring material for and producing technology, that extra time increased the chances of encounters and thus increases the chances of acquiring more resources in a shorter period of time. This demonstrates that raw material choice is not always straightforward, nor are high <b>quality</b> <b>materials</b> always sought out.|$|R

40|$|Improving the {{deposition}} rate for microcrystalline silicon (mu c-Si:H) prepared by Hot Wire Chemical Vapour Deposition (HWCVD) under the constraint {{of a low}} substrate temperature {{is the subject of}} this study. The influence of {{the deposition}} pressure and various combinations of filament configuration and filament temperature oil the deposition rate and <b>material</b> <b>quality</b> was investigated. Raman and infrared spectroscopy and solar cell J-V parameters are used to evaluate the <b>quality</b> of the <b>material.</b> Low deposition pressures and low filament temperatures at low filament-substrate distances are most suitable to obtain high <b>quality</b> <b>material</b> at improved deposition rates.

5000|$|With {{flexible}} pavement, {{the highest}} stress {{occurs at the}} surface and the stress decreases as {{the depth of the}} pavement increases. Therefore, the highest <b>quality</b> <b>material</b> needs to be used for the surface, while lower <b>quality</b> <b>materials</b> can be used as the depth of the pavement increases. The term [...] "flexible" [...] is used because of the asphalts ability to bend and deform slightly, then return to its original position as each traffic load is applied and removed. It is possible for these small deformations to become permanent, which can lead to rutting in the wheel path over an extended time.|$|R

40|$|This study {{reports on}} the {{evaluation}} of four organic materials as key ecosystem resources for maize intensification in the Nigerian savanna. Two aspects are examined, first the qualitative value of the organic materials as sources of nutrients and secondly the quantitative significance of the organic materials {{within the context of}} the Nigerian savanna. The results showed that cow dung, M. pruriens vines and L. leucocephala pruning contained sufficient nutrients to meet the N and K requirements of a maize crop at an application rate of 5 t ha - 1. Phosphorus contents of maize stover and L. leucocephala pruning were not in sufficient quantities to meet crop demand. The calcium and magnesium requirements can be adequately met by this rate for all the organic amendments used. When the organic materials were evaluated based on the contents of nutrients and deduced ratios, cow dung, M. pruriens vines and L. leucocephala pruning were characterized as high <b>quality</b> <b>materials,</b> while maize stover was considered to be a low <b>quality</b> <b>material.</b> Based on their nutrient concentrations and deduced ratios, cow dung, M pruriens vines and L. leucocephala pruning were characterized as high <b>quality</b> <b>materials.</b> Maize stover may be considered as a low <b>quality</b> <b>material.</b> This grouping of the organic materials was confirmed using principal component and correlation analysis. The study also indicated that there are insufficient amounts of organic materials available to support crop production at a scale wider than small on-farm levels...|$|R
