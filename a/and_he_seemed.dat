5|$|For the old Diefenbaker {{was in full}} cry. All {{the agony}} of the {{disintegration}} of his government was gone, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> to be a giant revived by his contact with the people. This was Diefenbaker's finest election. He was virtually alone on the hustings. Even such loyalists as Gordon Churchill had to stick close to their own bailiwicks, where they were fighting for their political lives.|$|E
25|$|Poor Sir Ed, {{who is a}} quiz of {{the first}} magnitude, and who I believe had not given a dinner for twenty years before, was all bustle and anxiety during {{the whole of the}} entertainment. He {{informed}} us at the outset that {{he had been able to}} get but two bottles of champagne, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> to take it much to heart when anybody showed a disposition to drink other wine in a much larger proportion.|$|E
25|$|During {{his time}} at Anfield his presence, {{intelligent}} play and experience made a strong impression on the younger members of the squad <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> to inspire those around him when they found themselves in difficulty. This {{is one of the}} qualities that have led to his nickname The Enforcer by which he was known throughout his career. In recognition for his contribution to the club's success, McAllister was named as number 32 in the 100 Players Who Shook The Kop survey.|$|E

25|$|After Sheridan, {{the next}} Irish dramatist of {{historical}} importance was Dion Boucicault (1820–1890). Boucicault {{was born in}} Dublin but went to England to complete his education. At school, he began writing dramatic sketches and soon took up acting under the stage name of Lee Morton. His first play was Legend of Devil's Dyke 1838 in which he acted himself in Brighton. His first London production was London Assurance 1841. This was a great success <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> set to become the major writer of comedies of his day. However, his next few plays were not as successful and Boucicault found himself in debt. He recovered some of his reputation with The Corsican Brothers (1852), a well constructed melodrama.|$|E
25|$|Löhe {{was born}} on 21 February 1808 {{in the town of}} Fürth in present-day Middle Franconia. The son of a shopkeeper, his father died in 1816 <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> to have had a very lonely childhood. He {{received}} his basic education from C. L. Roth’s gymnasium in Nuremberg and was admitted to theological study at the University of Erlangen in 1826. He was heavily influenced by the Reformed professors of theology Christian Krafft and Thomas von Kempen. Ultimately, he was introduced to the Lutheran Confessions and became a Lutheran under the teaching of David Hollaz. In 1828 he spent a term at the University of Berlin, attracted not so much by the lectures of the professors as by the sermons of the famous preachers. Löhe graduated from the Erlangen in 1830, but waited until 1831 before receiving a pastoral assignment to Kirchenlamitz in Upper Franconia (Northeastern Bavaria).|$|E
500|$|MacMillan {{testified that}} for the {{duration}} of the affair she continued to have sex with Brownlee [...] "from terror and because he told me it was my duty to do it <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> to have an influence over me which I could not break." [...] She claimed that there had been no love accompanying the sex, and that it had been physically painful for her on each occasion.|$|E

500|$|In a 2008 {{interview}} with Christopher Coleman of Tracksounds.com, Gregson-Williams said that Hood attracted {{him to the}} project, adding: [...] "I happened {{to meet him at}} the Golden Globes dinner about three years ago. That night we were both nominees, but both losers. He had been nominated for Tsotsi and during the dinner I had spoken to him <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> like a really smart and creative guy...and into music. So I was really delighted when I got a call to meet him and discuss the possibilities for Wolverine." ...|$|E
500|$|In his {{biography}} of Ranjitsinhji, Simon Wilde suggests that MacLaren {{had to work}} very hard for his employer in this period, and found little time for cricket. In addition, his batting form was poor throughout, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> to be in bad physical condition when he occasionally found time to play. Before Ranjitsinhji returned to India, MacLaren resigned as his secretary—although he went with him to India for a holiday. According to Wilde, the resignation was to allow MacLaren to play more regularly, but [...] "he never really recovered his form". In summarising Ranjitsinhji's life at this time, Wilde suggests that his unreliability with money was quite calculated, and writes: [...] "Many of his off-the-field exploits with A. C. MacLaren... will probably never be known, but it seems clear that sometimes they were not averse to conducting themselves in the fashion of E. W. Hornung's fictional character Raffles, the cricketing burglar." ...|$|E
500|$|What unity English Protestants {{had shared}} in the plot's {{immediate}} aftermath began to fade when in 1625 James's son, the future Charles I, married the Catholic Henrietta Maria of France. [...] Puritans reacted to the marriage by issuing a new prayer to warn against rebellion and Catholicism, and on 5November that year, effigies of the pope and the devil were burnt, the earliest such report of this practice {{and the beginning of}} centuries of tradition. During Charles's reign Gunpowder Treason Day became increasingly partisan. [...] Between 1629 and 1640 he ruled without Parliament, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> to support Arminianism, regarded by Puritans like Henry Burton as a step toward Catholicism. [...] By 1636, under the leadership of the Arminian Archbishop of Canterbury William Laud, the English church was trying to use 5November to denounce all seditious practices, and not just popery. Puritans went on the defensive, some pressing for further reformation of the Church.|$|E

500|$|Davis proved, perhaps, to be {{the most}} pivotal instrumentalist during these sessions. [...] "If you listen to the album, every tune is led by Richard and {{everybody}} followed Richard and Van's voice," [...] says Merenstein. [...] "I knew if I brought Richard in, he would put the bottom on to support what Van wanted to do vocally, or acoustically. Then you get Jay playing those beautiful counter-lines to Van." [...] Davis was not impressed by Morrison, but not out of disdain or any preconceived notions, but rather because Morrison's professional comportment generally did not meet Davis's expectations. [...] "No prep, no meeting," [...] recalls Davis. [...] "He was remote from us, 'cause he came in and went into a booth... And that's where he stayed, isolated in a booth. I don't think he ever introduced himself to us, nor we to him... <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> very shy..." [...] Drummer Connie Kay later told Rolling Stone that he approached Morrison and asked [...] "what he wanted me to play, and he said to play whatever I felt like playing. We more or less sat there and jammed." [...] Morrison's impression of the sessions was [...] "The songs came together very well in the studio. Some of the tracks were first takes. [...] the musicians were really together. Those type of guys play what you're gonna do before you do it, that's how good they are." [...] He told Ritchie Yorke that only two tracks recorded during the sessions did not make it to the album. [...] "One was about Jesse James and the other about trains. They were both just basic blues numbers. That's why they didn't fit in with the album." ...|$|E
2500|$|Janick recalls it as follows: [...] "He rang {{me up and}} {{we talked}} but I {{remember}} saying, 'There is no way {{in this world that}} I am putting on make up or anything like that, I'm just not into that shit.' But we had a chat <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> like a nice enough guy. But I never heard back from him." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the end of}} the First World War Greece {{occupied}} Smyrna from 15 May 1919 and put {{in place}} a military administration. The Greek premier Venizelos had plans to annex Smyrna <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> to be realizing his objective in the Treaty of Sèvres, signed 10 August 1920. (However, this treaty was not ratified by the parties; the Treaty of Peace of Lausanne replaced it.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Writing in 1862 in his Scores and biographies, Arthur Haygarth called Pilch [...] "the best batsman {{that has}} ever yet appeared". The main {{characteristic}} of Pilch's batting was his forward play, a shot that was called 'Pilch's poke'. Haygarth further wrote : [...] "His style of batting was very commanding, extremely forward, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> to rush to the best bowling by his long forward play before it had time to shoot or rise, or do mischief by catches".|$|E
2500|$|Lowson {{played in}} four of the five Tests against India, and made his highest Test score (68) in the first match. He scored more than 1,000 {{first-class}} runs on the tour, at an average of 44 runs per innings, but could average only 18 in the Tests. Wisden 's review of the tour said; [...] "Lowson possessed more strokes and looked the most accomplished batsman on the side, but he had an unfortunate time in the Tests. His skill could not be denied <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> an England batsman all over, the only doubt being the question of temperament".|$|E
2500|$|Hughes hit {{consecutive}} hundreds {{at the end}} of the 2010/11 {{season to}} earn the praise of Australian chairman of selectors Andrew Hilditch. In his last two first class matches for New South Wales in the 2010/11 season he scored 54, 115, 138 and 93. Australia's chairman of selectors, Andrew Hilditch, said [...] "I was thrilled for Phil, I think he turned the corner the last game. I spent a bit of time with him before the last Shield game <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> to be in a really good place. Having had a tough season, to emerge like he has is a credit to him." ...|$|E

2500|$|As war {{correspondent}} Ernie Pyle, who {{was later}} killed in action, would write, [...] "Major General Terry Allen {{was one of}} my favorite people. Partly because he didn't give a damn for hell or high water; partly because he was more colorful than most; and partly because he was the only general outside the Air Forces I could call by his first name. If there was one thing in the world Allen lived and breathed for, it was to fight. He had been all shot up in the last war, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> not the least averse to getting shot up again. This was no intellectual war with him. He hated Germans and Italians like vermin." ...|$|E
2500|$|Local {{resident}} Cacilia Davis {{was walking}} her dog {{at the scene}} of the Moskowitz and Violante shooting when she saw [...] patrol officer Michael Cataneo ticketing a car that was parked near a fire hydrant. Moments after the traffic police had left, a young man walked past her from the area of the car, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> to study her with some interest. Davis felt concerned because he was wielding in his hand some kind of [...] "dark object". She ran to her home only to hear shots fired behind her in the street. Davis remained silent about this experience for four days until she finally contacted police, who closely checked every car that had been ticketed in the area that night.|$|E
2500|$|Bradley saw {{the flag}} raising(s) as an {{insignificant}} event in a devastating battle. He rarely {{talked to people}} about it {{and spent most of}} his life trying to escape the attention he drew from allegedly raising it. He stated once that he [...] "just happened to be there". He spoke to his wife once about the flag raising during their 47-year marriage. That was on their first date, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> very uninterested with it during the conversation. His daughter Barbara said that “Reading a book on Iwo Jima at home would have been like reading a playgirl magazine…it would have been something I had to hide.” He told his children more than once that the only real heroes on Iwo Jima were those that did not survive.|$|E
