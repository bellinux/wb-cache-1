He {{was a member of}} the Victorian Parliament for Castlemaine from 1895 to 1899, where he was <b>a</b> <b>champion</b> <b>of</b> women's suffrage and federation.

5|$|After the war {{he became}} <b>a</b> <b>champion</b> <b>of</b> nuclear nonproliferation. He wrote for the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, and helped found the Federation of American Scientists and the Institute for Defense and Disarmament Studies. He {{was one of the}} few ex-communists to remain {{employed}} and academically active throughout the 1950s, but his research turned away from nuclear physics towards astrophysics. He published papers on cosmic rays, and a 1958 paper of his is considered to mark the birth of gamma ray astronomy. He was also known for writing popular science books and articles, and appearing in television programs.|$|E

5|$|Born in New York City, Bob Marshall was {{the third}} of four {{children}} of Louis Marshall (1856–1929) and Florence (née Lowenstein) Marshall (1873–1916). His father, the son of Jewish immigrants from Bavaria, was a noted wealthy constitutional lawyer, conservationist, and <b>a</b> <b>champion</b> <b>of</b> minority rights. The family moved to Syracuse, New York, where Louis Marshall {{was active in the}} Jewish community and a co-founder of the American Jewish Committee. In 1891, he was part of a national delegation that sought federal intervention on behalf of persecuted Russian Jews.|$|E
5|$|Brodie {{believed}} that previous historians had unduly vilified Stevens, and she enjoyed {{the prospect of}} rebuilding a reputation rather than, as in her Joseph Smith biography, tearing one down. Stevens as <b>a</b> <b>champion</b> <b>of</b> black people was a timely interest as the Civil Rights Movement increased in intensity. Research materials were available at Yale University, where Bernard Brodie was employed. Fawn Brodie wondered how Stevens had been affected psychologically by his physical deformity, a club foot.|$|E

5|$|Gould was <b>a</b> <b>champion</b> <b>of</b> {{biological}} constraints, internal limitations upon developmental pathways, as well {{as other}} non-selectionist forces in evolution. Rather than direct adaptations, he considered many higher functions of the human brain to be the unintended side consequence of natural selection. To describe such co-opted features, he coined the term exaptation with paleontologist Elisabeth Vrba. Gould believed this feature of human mentality undermines an essential premise of human sociobiology and evolutionary psychology.|$|E
5|$|Grainger left Australia {{at the age}} of 13 {{to attend}} the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt. Between 1901 and 1914 he was based in London, where he {{established}} himself first as a society pianist and later as a concert performer, composer and collector of original folk melodies. As his reputation grew he met many of the significant figures in European music, forming important friendships with Frederick Delius and Edvard Grieg. He became <b>a</b> <b>champion</b> <b>of</b> Nordic music and culture, his enthusiasm for which he often expressed in private letters.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{then and}} now have been divided over Wilfrid. His {{followers}} commissioned Stephen of Ripon to write a Vita Sancti Wilfrithi (or Life of Wilfrid) shortly after his death, and the medieval historian Bede also wrote extensively about him. Wilfrid lived ostentatiously, and travelled with a large retinue. He ruled {{a large number of}} monasteries, and claimed to be the first Englishman to introduce the Rule of Saint Benedict into English monasteries. Some modern historians see him mainly as <b>a</b> <b>champion</b> <b>of</b> Roman customs against the customs of the British and Irish churches, others as an advocate for monasticism.|$|E

5|$|Johnson {{served as}} {{chairman}} of the Committee on Claims during the Eleventh Congress (1809–1811). The committee was charged with adjudicating financial claims made by veterans of the Revolutionary War. He sought to influence the committee to grant the claim of Alexander Hamilton's widow to wages which Hamilton had declined when serving under George Washington. Although Hamilton was <b>a</b> <b>champion</b> <b>of</b> the rival Federalist Party, Johnson had compassion for Hamilton's widow; before the end of his term, he secured payment of the wages.|$|E
5|$|Morales {{has been}} praised for {{significantly}} reducing poverty and illiteracy in Bolivia {{and has been}} internationally decorated with various awards. His supporters have lauded him as <b>a</b> <b>champion</b> <b>of</b> indigenous rights, anti-imperialism, and environmentalism. Alternately, a number of leftist, indigenous, and environmentalist critics have accused him of failing {{to live up to}} many of his espoused values, while right-wing opponents have accused him of being excessively radical and authoritarian and claimed that his defence of coca contributes to illegal cocaine production.|$|E
5|$|The longest-serving non-royal head {{of state}} in the 20th and 21st centuries, Castro {{polarized}} world opinion. His supporters view him as <b>a</b> <b>champion</b> <b>of</b> socialism and anti-imperialism whose revolutionary regime advanced economic and social justice while securing Cuba's independence from American imperialism. Critics view him as a dictator whose administration oversaw human-rights abuses, the exodus {{of a large number}} of Cubans and the impoverishment of the country's economy. Castro was decorated with various international awards and significantly influenced various individuals and groups across the world.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>Champions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Champions</b> {{competition}} was set-up {{ahead of the}} 2012-13 season, allowing <b>an</b> overall <b>champion</b> to crowned from the Central, East, South and West divisions.

5|$|Widely {{considered}} one of the most significant and influential figures of the 20th century, Lenin was the posthumous subject of a pervasive personality cult within the Soviet Union until its dissolution in 1991. He became an ideological figurehead behind Marxism–Leninism and thus a prominent influence over the international communist movement. A controversial and highly divisive individual, Lenin is viewed by supporters as <b>a</b> <b>champion</b> <b>of</b> socialism and the working class, while critics on both the left and right emphasize his role as founder and leader of an authoritarian regime responsible for political repression and mass killings.|$|E
5|$|A {{member of}} the Breckinridge {{political}} family, in 1849 John C. Breckinridge became the first Democrat to represent Fayette County in the Kentucky House of Representatives, and in 1851, {{he was the first}} Democrat to represent Kentucky's 8th congressional district in over 20 years. <b>A</b> <b>champion</b> <b>of</b> strict constructionism, states' rights, and popular sovereignty, he supported Stephen A. Douglas's Kansas–Nebraska Act as a means of addressing slavery in the territories acquired by the U.S. in the Mexican–American War. Considering his re-election to the House of Representatives unlikely in 1854, he returned to private life and his legal practice. He was nominated for vice president at the 1856 Democratic National Convention, and although he and Buchanan won the election, he enjoyed little influence in Buchanan's administration.|$|E
5|$|Born in London, Rollason {{studied to}} become a PE teacher before {{entering}} radio broadcasting in 1980. After directing sport related content for Channel 4, where she helped to bring American football to British television, she anchored coverage of the 1987 World Student Games and 1988 Summer Olympics. Her work on Grandstand proved popular with viewers, {{and led to a}} number of other sports presenting roles for Rollason throughout the 1990s. As well as covering mainstream events such as the 1996 Summer Olympics, she became <b>a</b> <b>champion</b> <b>of</b> disability sports, helping to raise its profile and change its public and media perception. She presented sports bulletins for BBC Breakfast News and BBC News, and in 1996 was named as Sports Presenter of the Year.|$|E
50|$|Pakalns {{also played}} ice hockey and bandy.

5|$|Following {{service in}} the First World War, Wilson became known for singing tenor roles in oratorios by composers from Bach to Elgar, and was {{particularly}} admired both as the Evangelist in Bach's St Matthew Passion and {{in the title role}} of The Dream of Gerontius. He was <b>a</b> <b>champion</b> <b>of</b> music by English composers of his generation, notably Ralph Vaughan Williams, Gustav Holst and Rutland Boughton. He also appeared {{from time to time in}} operatic tenor roles, including Satyavan in the first professional performance of Holst's Savitri. The quality of his voice and even his technique, though, was not universally admired. In a high-profile libel case Wilson sued a member of the public who had criticised one of his performances in a letter, and the BBC for publishing it: he won £2,000 in damages.|$|E
5|$|Harrison {{had many}} {{friends in the}} eastern aristocracy, and quickly gained a {{reputation}} among them as a frontier leader. He ran a successful horse-breeding enterprise that won him acclaim throughout the Northwest Territory. Harrison became <b>a</b> <b>champion</b> <b>of</b> lower land prices, a primary concern of settlers in the Territory at the time. The U.S. Congress had legislated a territorial land policy that led to high land costs, which many of the territory's residents disliked. In October 1799, after it had been determined that the Northwest Territory's population had reached a sufficient number to have a delegate in the U.S. Congress, Harrison ran for election. He campaigned to encourage further migration to the territory, which eventually led to statehood.|$|E
5|$|In 1884, McCreary {{was elected}} to the first of six {{consecutive}} terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. As a legislator, he was an advocate of free silver and <b>a</b> <b>champion</b> <b>of</b> the state's agricultural interests. After two failed bids for election to the Senate, McCreary secured the support of Governor J. C. W. Beckham, and in 1902, the General Assembly elected him to the Senate. He served one largely undistinguished term, and Beckham successfully challenged him for his Senate seat in 1908. The divide between McCreary and Beckham was short-lived, however, and Beckham supported McCreary's election to a second term as governor in 1911.|$|E
