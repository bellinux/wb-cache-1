As a percentage of dry matter, the fruit bodies contain 39.0% crude protein, 1.4% lipids, 50.8% carbohydrates, and 8.8% ash. The majority of the lipid content comprises oleic (43.9%), linoleic (38.3%), and palmitic (9.9%) fatty acids.|$|E

5|$|This {{species is}} found in the Pacific Northwest region of North America where it grows on large (at least 1m diameter) {{specimens}} of noble fir (Abies procera), Pacific silver fir (Abies amabilis), or western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla). Bridgeoporus nobilissimus causes a brown rot in its tree hosts. Genetic <b>analysis</b> <b>shows</b> that the fungus is more prevalent than fruit body distribution indicates.|$|E
5|$|DNA <b>analysis</b> <b>shows</b> {{that the}} first three form {{monophyletic}} clades. The wolf-like canids and the South American canids together form the tribe Canini. Molecular data imply a North American origin of living Canidae some ten million years ago and an African origin of wolf-like canines (Canis, Cuon, and Lycaon), with the jackals being the most basal of this group. The South American clade is rooted by the maned wolf and bush dog, and the fox-like canids by the fennec fox and Blanford's fox. The grey fox and island fox are basal to the other clades; however, this topological difference is not strongly supported.|$|E

The diversity of marine life decreased when the climate near the K-T boundary increased in temperature. The temperature increased about three to four degrees very rapidly between 65.4 and 65.2 million years ago, which is {{around the time of}} the extinction event. Not only did the climate temperature increase, but the water temperature decreased causing a drastic decrease in marine diversity.|$|E
5|$|Redhead and Smith {{placed the}} genus in the Strophariaceae, as {{the biology of}} the fruit bodies and spore print color fit the broad concept of that family envisaged by Robert Kühner in 1984. They noted, however, that the genus did not fit well in a more {{restricted}} concept of the family due to its lack of a germ pore and roughened spore walls. More recently, taxonomic authorities have placed the genus in the family Psathyrellaceae; molecular <b>analysis</b> <b>shows</b> it to be most closely allied to this group. Mythicomyces and Stagnicola form a clade that is sister {{to the rest of}} the family.|$|E
5|$|The {{calculations}} that {{purported to}} show that bumblebees cannot fly are based upon a simplified linear treatment of oscillating aerofoils. The method assumes small amplitude oscillations without flow separation. This ignores the effect of dynamic stall (an airflow separation inducing a large vortex above the wing), which briefly produces several times the lift of the aerofoil in regular flight. More sophisticated aerodynamic <b>analysis</b> <b>shows</b> the bumblebee can fly because its wings encounter dynamic stall in every oscillation cycle.|$|E

The optimum process conditions of sulfuric acid pre-hydrolysis were as below: Acid dosage 0. 10 %, 150 ℃, 90 min.

The fiber quality <b>analysis</b> <b>showed</b> fiber length and width were reduced, the tiny fiber content was decreased after acid pre-hydrolysis; HPLC <b>analysis</b> <b>showed</b> the optimum acid pre-hydrolysis process which can reduce the inevitable cellulose degradation effectively, hemicelluloses were hydrolyzed furthest at the same time; FTIR spectrum <b>analysis</b> <b>showed</b> acid pre-hydrolysis process can dissolve a lot of hemicelluloses...|$|R

Infrared photography reveals little underdrawing but shows that the canvas underwent several changes before it was completed; Mary Salome was repositioned slightly to the left, the sizes of Nicodemus' arm and shoulder were reduced, and the Magdalen's face was painted over the Virgin's mantle.|$|E
5|$|A cold front's {{location}} {{is at the}} leading edge of the temperature drop-off, which in an isotherm <b>analysis</b> <b>shows</b> up as {{the leading edge of the}} isotherm gradient, and it normally lies within a sharp surface trough. Cold fronts can move up to twice as fast as warm fronts and produce sharper changes in weather, since cold air is denser than warm air and rapidly lifts the warm air as the cold air moves in. Cold fronts are typically accompanied by a narrow band of showers and thunderstorms. On a weather map, the surface position of the cold front is marked with the symbol of a blue line of triangles/spikes (pips) pointing in the direction of travel, {{at the leading edge}} of the cooler air mass.|$|E
5|$|Sarcoscypha coccinea, {{commonly}} known as the scarlet elf cup, scarlet elf cap, or the scarlet cup, is a species of fungus in the family Sarcoscyphaceae of the order Pezizales. The fungus, widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, has been found in Africa, Asia, Europe, North and South America, and Australia. The type species of the genus Sarcoscypha, S.coccinea has been known by many names since its first appearance in the scientific literature in 1772. Phylogenetic <b>analysis</b> <b>shows</b> the species to be most closely related to other Sarcoscypha species that contain numerous small oil droplets in their spores, such as the North Atlantic island species S.macaronesica. Due to similar physical appearances and sometimes overlapping distributions, S.coccinea has often been confused with S.occidentalis, S.austriaca, and S.dudleyi.|$|E

5|$|The Prince Consort's and Queen Victoria's {{rooms in}} the keep are named after their use during the royal visit of 1842, {{although}} their decoration today dates from the interwar period. The Dining Room, Drawing Room and Ante Room, which overlook the northern bastion, date from the 1730s, when the Duke of Dorset constructed them to form a private set of chambers. These rooms feature a range of pink and purple window glass, which tradition says was installed by the Earl of Liverpool to protect his wife's eyesight; recent <b>analysis</b> <b>shows</b> {{that some of the}} pink-tinted glass dates from the 1730s, and discoloured naturally over time, while other panes were intentionally purchased around 1800 in these hues, but probably as status symbols and not for any medical purpose.|$|E
5|$|The simple, low-crowned teeth {{indicate}} that Paraceratherium was a browser with a diet consisting of relatively soft leaves and shrubs. Later rhinoceroses were grazers, with high-crowned teeth because their diets contained grit that quickly wore down their teeth. Studies of mesowear on Paraceratherium teeth confirm the creatures {{had a soft}} diet of leaves; microwear studies {{have yet to be}} conducted. Isotope <b>analysis</b> <b>shows</b> that Paraceratherium fed chiefly on C3 plants, which are mainly leaves. Like its perissodactyl relatives, the horses, tapirs, and other rhinoceroses, Paraceratherium would have been a hindgut fermenter; it would extract relatively little nutrition from its food and would have to eat large volumes to survive. Like other large herbivores, Paraceratherium would have had a large digestive tract.|$|E
