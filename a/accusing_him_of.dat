5|$|Ancient {{authors have}} implicated Domitian {{in the death}} of his brother, either by {{directly}} <b>accusing</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> murder, or implying he left the ailing Titus for dead, even alleging that during his lifetime, Domitian was openly plotting against his brother. It is difficult to assess the factual veracity of these statements given the known bias of the surviving sources. Brotherly affection was likely at a minimum, but this was hardly surprising, considering that Domitian had barely seen Titus after the age of seven.|$|E

5|$|When {{attending}} a Fox Broadcasting Company publicity event in New York City with Rupert Murdoch, show producer Matt Groening {{was introduced by}} Murdoch to Rickles. Rickles began shouting at Groening, <b>accusing</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> spying on his Las Vegas act and using material from that for the episode. The cast actually had been receiving recordings from Rickles from the 1950s to use as {{ideas on how to}} get the style for his animatic portrayal.

5|$|Alves and Van-Dunem {{planned to}} arrest Neto on 21 May before {{he arrived at}} a meeting of the Central Committee and before the {{commission}} released its report on the activities of the Nitistas.

The Italian fleet commander, Admiral Carlo Pellion di Persano, initially adopted a cautious course of action; he was unwilling to risk battle with the Austrian Navy, {{despite the fact that the}} Austrian fleet was much weaker than his own. Persano claimed he was simply waiting on the ironclad ram , en route from Britain, but his inaction weakened morale in the fleet, with many of his subordinates openly <b>accusing</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> cowardice.|$|E

In 1102 Henry then turned against Robert of Bellême and his brothers, the most powerful of the barons, <b>accusing</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> 45 different offences. Robert escaped and took up arms against Henry. Henry besieged Robert's castles at Arundel, Tickhill and Shrewsbury, pushing down into the south-west to attack Bridgnorth. His power base in England broken, Robert accepted Henry's offer of banishment and left the country for Normandy.|$|E

5|$|In 1538 James V {{summoned the}} 3rd Earl of Morton before the Privy Council, <b>accusing</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> non-payment of his feudal dues, and in 1540 he banished the Earl to Inverness. Morton reached Brechin, in Angus, where {{he signed a}} deed resigning his lands to his kinsman Robert Douglas of Lochleven. Lochleven was {{compelled}} to resign the lands in turn to James V, although he was permitted to keep Aberdour Castle. After James V's death in late 1542, George Douglas of Pittendreich and the Earl of Arran assisted Morton in reclaiming his lands, including Aberdour. In return their sons were to marry two of Morton's three daughters. Pittendreich's son James (1525-1581) married the heiress, Elizabeth, and succeeded, in 1553, as 4th Earl of Morton.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, the astrologer and {{psychologist}} Michel Gauquelin {{stated that}} {{though he had}} failed to find evidence that supported indicators like zodiacal signs and planetary aspects in astrology, he did find positive correlations between the diurnal positions of some planets and success in professions that astrology traditionally associates with those planets. The best-known of Gauquelin's findings is based on the positions of Mars in the natal charts of successful athletes and became known as the Mars effect. A study conducted by seven French scientists attempted to replicate the claim, but found no statistical evidence. They attributed the effect to selective bias on Gauquelin's part, <b>accusing</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> attempting to persuade them to add or delete names from their study.|$|E
5|$|In July 1676 Carbery {{called for}} a hearing against Morgan {{in front of the}} Assembly of Jamaica, <b>accusing</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> collaborating with the French to attack Spanish interests. Morgan {{admitted}} he had met the French officials, but indicated that that this was diplomatic relations, rather than anything duplicitous. In the summer of 1677 the Lords of Trade said they had yet to come to a decision on the matter and in early 1678 the king and the Privy Council recalled Carbery from Jamaica, leaving Morgan as governor for three months. In July 1678 Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Carlisle was appointed governor.|$|E
