5|$|A further {{bombardment}} by King George V, three light cruisers and escorting destroyers {{was planned}} to be conducted against an unspecified Japanese target on 13 August.

5|$|Another <b>attack</b> <b>was</b> made in 1521 by Paulus Bombasius, the prefect of the Vatican Library, {{because in}} Greek text Erasmus {{departed}} from the common readings of the Vulgate. He informed Erasmus that in the Vatican Library is held an extremely ancient copy of the Scriptures (i.e. Codex Vaticanus).

At 00:30 on 25 October, the 11th Company of Nasu's 3rd Battalion under Captain Jiro Katsumata found and {{attacked}} Company A of Puller's battalion. Katsumata's <b>attack</b> <b>was</b> impeded by heavy barbed wire {{in front of the}} Marine line and then hit heavily by American machine gun, mortar, and artillery fire. By 01:00, the Marine fire had killed most of Katsumata's company.|$|E

5|$|At {{this stage}} of the war, the 2nd New Zealand Division was {{fighting}} in Italy as part of the British Eighth Army with the 5th Brigade poised to attack across the Sangro River in central Italy. On his arrival, Kippenberger conducted a survey of the terrain and recommended to Freyberg that the attack plan be modified to include an additional brigade, a recommendation Freyberg concurred with. The reorganised <b>attack</b> <b>was</b> successfully executed on the evening of 28 November with light casualties. The 2nd Division then attempted three times to capture the town of Orsogna. The second attack on the town of 7 December was the first to involve the 5th Brigade. Despite Kippenberger's brigade achieving all its objectives on the flank of the town, the <b>attack</b> <b>was</b> not successful. The failure of another brigade, tasked with capture of Orsogna itself, to achieve its goals left elements of the 5th Brigade exposed, and it had to partially withdraw.|$|E
