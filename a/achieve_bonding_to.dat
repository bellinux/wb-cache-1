30|$|Adhesive bonding in {{dentistry}} is {{a process}} dependent on several factors, such as the type of substrate [1], type of adhesive substance(s) [2], humidity of the environment [3],[4], and operator’s ability in performing the bonding procedure [5]. With regard to the dental substrates, adhesive procedures are usually performed <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> <b>bond</b> <b>to</b> dental enamel and dentin. Enamel is a highly-mineralized substrate constituted of almost 100  wt% of hydroxyapatite crystals, which do not require a wet surface during adhesive procedures for proper bonding. By contrast, dentin is a more complex substrate constituted of both mineral and organic phases (e.g., collagen fibrils), as well as water. Consequently, <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> dentin is challenging because an ideal moisture condition should be maintained to avoid collapse of the collagen matrix and allow proper adhesive infiltration of the adhesive into the demineralized substrate [1],[6].|$|R

40|$|OBJECT. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the degree of bone ingrowth and bonding stiffness at the surface of hydroxyapatite ceramic (HAC) spacers with different porosities in an animal model and to discuss the ideal porous characteristics of these spacers for anterior spinal reconstruction. METHODS. Twenty-one adult sheep (age 1 – 2 years, mean weight 70 kg) were used in this experiment. Surgery consisted of anterior lumbar interbody fusion at L 2 – 3 and L 4 – 5, insertion of an HAC spacer (10 * 13 * 24 mm) with three different porosities (0, 3, and 15 %), and single-rod anterior instrumentation. At 4 and 6 months postoperatively, the lumbar spines were harvested. Bonding conditions at the bone–HAC spacer interface were evaluated using neuroimages and biomechanically. A histological evaluation was also conducted to examine the state of bone ingrowth at the surface of the HAC spacer. Biomechanical testing showed that the bonding strength of HAC at 6 months postoperatively was 0. 047 MPa in 0 % porosity spacers, 0. 39 MPa in 3 %, and 0. 49 MPa in 15 % porosity spacers. The histological study showed that there was a soft-tissue layer at the surface of the HAC spacer with 0 % porosity. Direct bonding was observed between bone and spacers with 3 or 15 % porosity. Micro–computed tomography scans showed direct bonding between the bone and HAC with 3 or 15 % porosity. No direct bonding was observed in HAC with 0 % porosity. CONCLUSIONS.

Thus, the authors focused on the dissolution of the modified PMMA-based bone cement and its tissue response in muscle and bone by comparison with the behavior of non-modified PMMA-based bone cement. One week after implantation in the latissimus dorsi of a rabbit, the modified PMMA-based bone cement showed more inflammatory width than the commercial cement. However, four weeks after implantation, the inflammatory width of both cements was essentially the same. The osteoconductivity around the modified cement was higher than that for the conventional cement after four weeks implantation. These results indicate that the initial dissolution of calcium acetate from the modified cement to form the hydroxyapatite induced the acute inflammation around tissue, but also developed the osteoconductivity.

Materials and Methods: Two luting agents (Dual-Link and Unfilled Resin) for cementing fiber posts into root canals were applied either with All-Bond 2 or One-Step Plus, or without an adhesive system, and challenged with the push-out test. Slices of roots restored with posts were loaded until post segment extrusion in the apical-coronal direction. Failure modes were analyzed under SEM. Results: Push-out strength was significantly influenced by the luting agent (p 0. 05). The best results were obtained in combination with Unfilled Resin with One-Step Plus. Dual-Link groups failed mainly cohesively within the cement, while Unfilled Resin demonstrated more adhesive fracture at the post interface.

Data: Data were searched in articles published or in press in peer-review journals listed in MEDLINE. Sources: Papers were retrieved through PubMed. Study selection: To collect the evidence of interest, the following search terms were used: bond* AND fiber post AND in vitro; lut* AND fiber post AND in vitro; push-out AND fiber post; pull-out AND fiber post; microtensile AND fiber post. "Related Links" were also considered and articles cited in the initially retrieved papers were included if relevant. No time limit {{was given to the}} query. Conclusions: Seventy relevant papers were reviewed. The retentive ability of adhesive posts has been tested with the microtensile technique, post-pull-out and push-out tests. if small-sized specimens are obtained, such as in microtensile and thin-slice push-out, stress uniformity is favoured, local differences in bonding conditions can be discerned, and the number of teeth needed for the test can be reduced. Although adhesion to intraradicular dentin is more challenging <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> than <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> crown tissues, the post-retention achieved with current luting systems and techniques is adequate to ensure the clinical success of adhesive post-retained restorations. <b>To</b> enhance the <b>bond</b> at the post-core and post-cement interfaces, several chemical pre-treatments of the post-surface have been tested with positive results.

In order to achieve these aims, the static camber variation of the aerofoil, as well as its actuation bandwidth, have to be sufficiently high. The morphing aerofoil sector is a NACA 0018 with a chord of 300 mm and a final span of 250 mm (however the preliminary test sector has a span of 40 mm). The non-deformable part of the sector is 3 D printed in ABS and the active camber deformation is <b>achieved</b> by <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> the trailing edge portion of the structure tailored (MFC) piezo-patch-sandwiches properly actuated by ad hoc high-voltage amplifiers. A linear trailing edge slider is used to allow the necessary skin deformation. A PID inner control layer on the tip displacement feedback is developed in a real-time environment using a laser displacement sensor. The preliminary design of the model, as well as the static and dynamic experimental tests on the prototype, is illustrated and discussed in the paper.

Detailed specifications are given for <b>achieving</b> uniform/strong <b>bonds</b> <b>to</b> poly-Si and Au bond rings in a bond recipe which includes vacuum pumping, an outgassing step, application of the bond pressure (~ 2. 5 MPa), and heating to 390 C. Micromachined poly-Si Pirani vacuum sensors were developed, characterized and then packaged in the Au-Si eutectic bonding process in order to measuring vacuum pressures. These packages had cavity dimensions of 2. 3 × 2. 3 mm wide with a depth of 90 µm. Yields of 84. 6 % and 94. 1 % were achieved in packages with bond ring widths of 100 and 150 µm. With the use of getters and a pre-bond outgassing step, pressures from < 3. 7 to 23. 3 mTorr were achieved. Furthermore, pressures were shown to remain stable to within ± 5 mTorr for over 3 years of testing, after 100 hours at 150 ºC, and after 50 thermal cycles from - 50 ºC to 150 ºC.

The objective was to study different production parameters related to ageing of an AA 6082 aluminum alloy, combined with IF steel, through a cold roll bonding process. Three different sequences of solutionizing, ageing, and cold roll bonding of the materials were tested. Sheets of steel and aluminum, measuring 30 x 120 mm, were used to produce the samples. Each sheet measured roughly 1 mm in thickness, and were stacked {{together to form a}} three layered composite, with aluminum in the middle and steel on either side. The sheets were prepared by scratch brushing, and were roll bonded at pre-heat temperatures of 150, 200, & 300 ^oC. Three different sequences were used for heat treating the aluminum; The BSA samples were roll bonded, followed by solutionizing and ageing to T 6. The SBA samples were solutionized, roll bonded, and then aged to T 6. The SAB samples were solutionized and aged to T 6, followed by roll bonding. The three sequences were meant to determine the optimal way of producing a precipitation hardened structure in the aluminum, while still <b>achieving</b> a good <b>bond</b> <b>to</b> the steel. The cold roll bonded samples were cut into sections and studied through several microstructural and mechanical characterization methods.

Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was used to study the resulting fracture surfaces, to determine the amount of residual material left on each surface. In summary, the SAB samples were found to produce the greatest bond strengths, followed by the SBA samples, and the BSA samples. The <b>achieved</b> <b>bond</b> strength values were overall fairly low compared to what others have achieved. The solutionizing step caused the aluminum in all samples to recrystallize, and the BSA samples, which were solutionized after roll bonding, developed an intermetallic layer roughly 1 μm thick.

30|$|Retention {{of direct}} {{restorative}} materials currently used {{is achieved by}} micromechanical interlocking and/or chemical adhesion [2],[27]. Nowadays, the adhesive procedures have a reliable clinical effectiveness [1]. However, some issues remain challenging in <b>achieving</b> a durable <b>bond</b> <b>to</b> tooth structure. During restorative procedures using a separate etching step, a discrepancy between the demineralization depth and monomer penetration could occur [2]. This fact makes the non-monomer-infiltrated collagen {{at the bottom of}} the hybrid layer more prone to degradation by proteolytic enzymes, as dentinal matrix metalloproteinases and, consequently, the resin-dentin bonding interface could be compromised [2]. The incorporation of bioactive materials has been proposed, attempting to backfill the denuded collagen to prevent hybrid layer deterioration [8]–[11]. Calcium silicates and calcium orthophosphates have already been experimentally tested on adhesives aiming at this therapeutic/remineralization effect [28],[29]. These compounds are highly soluble, and their action is due to an initial solubilization followed by a deposition of minerals [28]. This process does not occur for niobium pentoxide; it is expected that an apatite-like phase directly deposits over its surface without an initial dissolution of the mineral due <b>to</b> a Nb-OH <b>bond</b> formed on the oxide surface that induces apatite nucleation from SBF ions [14],[30]. Besides, this does not require the dissolution of filler from the adhesive matrix niobium pentoxide, which enhances the Knoop microhardness and radiopacity of adhesive resins [16]. Thus, we assume that the developed adhesive resins were capable of promoting calcium-phosphate deposition on their surfaces and could contribute to the maintenance of hybrid layer integrity.|$|R
