5|$|Following the {{publication}} of his bestselling books, Speer donated a considerable amount of money to Jewish charities. According to Siedler, these donations were as high as 80% of his royalties. Speer kept the donations anonymous, both for fear of rejection, and for fear of being called <b>a</b> <b>hypocrite.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pope's notes call Cibber <b>a</b> <b>hypocrite,</b> and {{in general}} the attacks on Cibber are {{conducted}} in the notes added to the Dunciad, {{and not in the}} body of the poem. As hero of the Dunciad, Cibber merely watches the events of Book II, dreams Book III, and sleeps through Book IV.|$|E
5|$|Martello {{defended the}} growing rise of feminists in Wicca during the 1970s, criticizing what he {{deemed to be}} the continual {{repression}} of women within the Pagan movement. He also espoused the view that any Pagan {{who was involved in}} the U.S. government or military was <b>a</b> <b>hypocrite.</b> He was critical of Wiccans who espoused a division between white magic and black magic, commenting that it had racial overtones and that many of those advocating such a view were racist.|$|E

So long as thy constitution-sin remains, as {{winked at}} by thee, so long thou art <b>an</b> <b>hypocrite</b> before God, let thy {{profession}} {{be what it}} will; also, when conscience shall awake and be commanded to speak to thee plainly what thou art, it will tell thee so, to thy no little vexation and perplexity.|$|R

[...] However, <b>an</b> <b>hypocrite,</b> while God forbeareth to smite him, may {{triumph and}} joy in his goodness; yet when God shall {{pronounce}} his judgment according as he approve of his act, he needs must lower {{and fall in}} his countenance; for his person and gift are rejected, and he still counted a sinner.|$|R
5|$|Surnames {{behave in}} similar ways in other languages; {{for example in}} France, {{surnames}} can be toponymic, metonymic, or may record nicknames ("sobriquets"). Poisson (Fish) is a metonym for a fishmonger or fisherman. Loiseau (The bird) and Lechat (The cat) are nicknames, Lechat indicating either a flexible man or <b>a</b> <b>hypocrite,</b> Loiseau suggesting a lightly-built birdlike person. In Sweden, the surname Falk (Falcon) is common; it is found among Swedish nobility from 1399.|$|E
5|$|On December 15, 1863, Breckinridge took {{leave in}} Richmond. Premature rumors {{of his death}} {{prompted}} The New York Times to print a quite vituperative obituary suggesting that Breckinridge had been <b>a</b> <b>hypocrite</b> for supporting states' rights, then abandoning his home state when it chose {{to remain in the}} Union. Confederate leaders were skeptical of Bragg's claims against Breckinridge, and in February 1864, Confederate President Jefferson Davis assigned him to the Eastern Theater and put him in charge of the Trans-Allegheny Department (later known as the Department of East Tennessee and West Virginia).|$|E
5|$|Benjamin {{worked to}} deny Douglas the 1860 Democratic presidential nomination, feeling {{he had turned}} against the South. Douglas contended that {{although}} the Supreme Court, in Dred Scott v. Sandford, had stated Congress could not restrict slavery in the territories, the people of each territory could pass legislation to bar it. This position was anathema to the South. Benjamin praised Douglas's opponent in his re-election bid, former congressman Abraham Lincoln, for at least being true to his principles as an opponent of the expansion of slavery, whereas the senator considered Douglas to be <b>a</b> <b>hypocrite.</b> Benjamin was joined in his opposition to Douglas by Senator Davis; the two were so successful that the 1860 convention {{was not able to}} nominate anyone and split into Northern and Southern factions. The Northerners backed Douglas while Southern delegates chose Vice President John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky. Despite their agreement in opposing Douglas, Benjamin and Davis differed on some race issues: in May, Benjamin voted for a bill to aid Africans liberated by U.S. naval vessels from illegal slave ships, in order to return them to their native continent from Key West. Davis and many other Southerners opposed the bill.|$|E
6000|$|The {{second thing}} that I {{take notice of}} in this prayer of the Pharisee, is his manner of delivery, as he stood praying in the temple: [...] "God, I thank thee," [...] said he, [...] "that I am not as other men are." [...] He seemed to be {{at this time in}} more than an {{ordinary}} frame, while now he stood {{in the presence of the}} divine Majesty: for a prayer made up of praise, is a prayer made up of the highest order, and is most like the way of them that are now in a state beyond prayer. Praise is the work of heaven; but we see here, that <b>an</b> <b>hypocrite</b> may get into that vein, even while <b>an</b> <b>hypocrite,</b> and while on earth below. Nor do I think that this prayer of his was a premeditated stinted form, but a prayer extempore, made on a sudden according to what he felt, thought, or understood of himself.|$|R

60|$|One reads, he prays, he catechises too; But doth he nothing else, what doth he do? I read {{to know my}} duty, I do pray To God to help me do it day by day; If this be not my end in what I do, I am <b>a</b> sot, <b>an</b> <b>hypocrite</b> also. I am baptiz'd, what then? unless I die To sin, I cover folly with a lie. At the Lord's table, I do eat; what though? There {{some have}} eat their own damnation too.|$|R
5|$|I was {{of course}} happy to meet the Hizbullah people, {{because it is a}} point of view that is rarely heard in the United States. I have no problem saying that I do want to express {{solidarity}} with them, and I am {{not going to be a}} coward of (sic) <b>a</b> <b>hypocrite</b> about it. I don't care about Hizbullah as a political organization. I don't know much about their politics, and anyhow, it's irrelevant. I don't live in Lebanon. It's a choice that the Lebanese have to make: Who they want to be their leaders, who they want to represent them. But there is a fundamental principle. People have the right to defend their country from foreign occupiers, and people have the right to defend their country from invaders who are destroying their country. That to me is a very basic, elementary and uncomplicated question.|$|E
5|$|Hogarth {{replicates}} all {{the features}} of the pastoral scene in an urban landscape. The shepherds and shepherdesses become the beggars and whores, the sun overhead is replaced by the clock on the church, the snow-capped mountains become the snowy rooftops. Even the setting of Covent Garden with piles of fruit and vegetables echoes the country scene. In the centre of the picture the icy goddess of the dawn {{in the form of the}} prim churchgoer is followed by her shivering red-nosed pageboy, mirroring Hesperus, the dawn bearer. The woman is the only one who seems unaffected by the cold, suggesting it may be her element. Although outwardly shocked, the dress of the woman, which is too fashionable for a woman of her age and in the painting is shown to be a striking acid yellow, may suggest she has other thoughts on her mind. She is commonly described as a spinster, and considered to be <b>a</b> <b>hypocrite,</b> ostentatiously attending church and carrying a fashionable ermine muff while displaying no charity to her freezing footboy or the half-seen beggar before her. The figure of the spinster is said to be based on a relative of Hogarth, who, recognising herself in the picture, cut him out of her will. Fielding later used the woman as the model for his character of Bridget Allworthy in Tom Jones.|$|E

If any have {{a quarrel}} against any, (As quarrels we have oft against a many) Why then, as God, for Christ's sake, pardons you, For Christ's sake, pardon thou thy brother too. We say, What freely comes, doth freely go; Then let all our forgivenesses be so.

With cunning I managed it. Of my wife and child I never once thought. Every trace of human affection seemed withered up in my heart. I took the money subscribed for me with <b>a</b> <b>hypocrite's</b> smile, and I slunk away from England. I went to Montreal in Canada, and I deliberately entered upon a life of low pleasures. Pardon me!" ...|$|R
25|$|Savarkar was {{an outspoken}} critic of Mahatma Gandhi. He criticized Gandhi for being <b>a</b> <b>hypocrite</b> as he {{supported}} use of violence by the British against Germany during World War II. He also criticized his appeasement of Muslims at the time of Khilafat Movement.|$|E
25|$|Scene III: Sir Oliver {{calls on}} {{his old friend}} Sir Peter. He is amused by Sir Peter's {{marriage}} to a young wife. Their talk turns to the Surface brothers. Sir Peter praises Joseph's high morals but Sir Oliver suspects {{that he might be}} <b>a</b> <b>hypocrite.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{with many}} {{controversial}} figures, Kenneth Starr {{has been the}} subject of political satire. The book, And the Horse He Rode In On, by James Carville, attempts to portray Starr's time as special prosecutor in a comedic, negative light. At the end of his tenure at Baylor, many have called Starr <b>a</b> <b>hypocrite</b> for playing a role in covering up the Baylor Football sex scandal, considering how harshly he stood against Clinton in regards to Clinton's scandal.|$|E

What has he done? Has he {{concealed}} any of thy righteousness? or has he secretly informed against thee, that thou art <b>an</b> <b>hypocrite</b> and superstitious? I dare say, the poor wretch has neither meddled nor made with thee in these matters.|$|R

25|$|Sadoul's {{work also}} {{took him to}} Toulon, where, in 1931, he defended in court a group of sailors that {{had been accused of}} mutiny. Living mainly on the French Riviera, and campaigning for the PCF in the local {{elections}} of Saint-Tropez, Sadoul was again a PCF candidate in the 1932 race, this time in Draguignan. He only won 1,800 votes. Sadoul acquired a luxurious villa and other properties in Sainte-Maxime, for which he was attacked as <b>a</b> <b>hypocrite</b> in the press. He rented this home to the composer Sergei Prokofiev. Urging Prokofiev to sever his links with the Whites and presenting him with the speeches of Lenin, Sadoul inspired him to write the Cantata for the 20th Anniversary of the October Revolution.|$|E
25|$|John Raffles, {{who knows}} of Bulstrode's shady past, appears in Middlemarch, {{intending}} to blackmail him. In his youth, the church-going Bulstrode engaged in questionable financial dealings, and his fortune {{is founded on}} his marriage to a much older, wealthy widow. Bulstrode's terror of public exposure as <b>a</b> <b>hypocrite</b> leads him to hasten {{the death of the}} mortally sick Raffles, but the story of his past has already spread. Bulstrode's disgrace engulfs Lydgate, as knowledge of the financier's loan to the doctor becomes known, and he is assumed to be complicit with Bulstrode. Only Dorothea and Farebrother maintain faith in him, but Lydgate and Rosamond are nevertheless encouraged by the general opprobrium to leave Middlemarch. The disgraced and reviled Bulstrode's only consolation is that his wife stands by him as he too faces exile.|$|E
25|$|You speak truly, O Achilli, and {{we cannot}} answer you a word. You are a Priest; {{you have been}} a Friar; you are, it is undeniable, the scandal of Catholicism, and the palmary {{argument}} of Protestants, by your extraordinary depravity. You have been, it is true, a profligate, an unbeliever, and <b>a</b> <b>hypocrite.</b> Not many years passed of your conventional life, and you were never in the choir, always in private houses, so that the laity observed you. You were deprived of your professorship, we own it; you were prohibited from preaching and hearing confessions; you were obliged to give hush-money to the father of one of your victims, as we learned from an official document of the Neapolitan Police to be 'known for habitual incontinency;' your name came before the civil tribunal at Corfu for your crime of adultery. You have put the crown on your offences, by as long as you could, denying them all; you have professed to seek after truth, when you were ravening after sin.|$|E

25|$|The Qur'an {{has also}} pointed out that believers perform Salaah only to earn the {{pleasure}} of Allah and not to impress anyone else, calling anyone who does so <b>a</b> <b>hypocrite.</b> Moreover, those who abandon Salaah are warned of dire consequences, while only those who humbly submit themselves to Allah alone are said to have ease in offering it. In Surah Al-Ma'arij, Allah uses the word halu’an to describe the restless and impatient nature of man, stating that whenever he is afflicted with trouble he lacks patience and trembles in despair. This occurs due to shortcomings in his faith, whereas when he is given in abundance he becomes ungrateful towards Allah. He is also arrogant and uncaring towards those less fortunate than him. The Qur'an then assures the observance of Salaah as way to preserve hope in times of grievance and humbleness as well as humility in periods of bountiful life. Salaah thus has the power to erase the roots of evil deeds which bring barriers in the society giving birth to racial as well as financial discriminations and sinful intentions.|$|E
25|$|Allan himself stands {{alongside}} Eliade's male characters, whose {{focus is}} on action, sensation and experience—his chaste contacts with Maitreyi are encouraged by Sen, who hopes for a marriage which is nonetheless abhorred by his would-be European son-in-law. Instead, Allan is fascinated to discover Maitreyi's Oriental version of Platonic love, marked by spiritual attachment more than by physical contact. However, their affair soon after turns physical, and she decides to attach herself to Allan as one would to a husband, in what is an informal and intimate wedding ceremony (which sees her vowing her love and invoking an earth goddess as the seal of union). Upon discovering this, Narendra Sen becomes enraged, rejecting their guest and keeping Maitreyi in confinement. As a result, his daughter decides to have intercourse with a lowly stranger, becoming pregnant {{in the hope that}} her parents would consequently allow her to marry her lover. However, the story also casts doubt on her earlier actions, reflecting rumors that Maitreyi was not a virgin at the time she and Allan first met, which also seems to expose her father as <b>a</b> <b>hypocrite.</b>|$|E
25|$|Chen Biao {{requested}} {{to serve in}} the military just like his father before him, and was placed in command of 500 troops. He was eager to win the hearts of his soldiers so he treated them well and they were willing to die for him. Once, there was an incident of grand theft and the suspect was Shi Ming (施明), a soldier from the Wunan (無難) camp. Shi Ming had been arrested and interrogated, but he remained fierce, refused to reveal the truth, and even expressed his willingness to die. The Minister of Justice (廷尉) was unable to do anything to him. Sun Quan heard that Chen Biao understood a soldier's mentality well so he ordered Chen to take up Shi Ming's case. Chen Biao had Shi Ming released from his shackles and allowed him to take a bath and have a change of clothes, and treated him to a feast. Shi Ming was so touched by Chen Biao's generous treatment that he confessed to the crime and named his accomplices. Sun Quan was very surprised and impressed with Chen Biao, so he granted a special pardon to Shi Ming to protect Chen's reputation – because Chen would be labelled as <b>a</b> <b>hypocrite</b> if Shi were to be executed after confessing under Chen's kind treatment. Shi Ming's accomplices, on the other hand, were not so lucky as they were all executed. Shi Ming mended his ways and gradually rose through the ranks to become a general in Eastern Wu.|$|E
