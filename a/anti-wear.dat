50|$|Mangalloy {{is made by}} {{alloying}} steel, containing 0.8 to 1.25% carbon, with 11 to 15% manganese. Mangalloy is {{a unique}} non-magnetic steel with extreme <b>anti-wear</b> properties. The material is very resistant to abrasion and will achieve up to three times its surface hardness during conditions of impact, without any increase in brittleness which is usually associated with hardness. (dead link 31 July 2017) This allows mangalloy to retain its toughness.|$|E
50|$|Another word used to {{describe}} nanoparticle based suspensions is Nanolubricants. They are mainly prepared using oils used for engine and machine lubrication. So far several materials including metals, oxides and allotropes of carbon {{have been used to}} formulate nanolubricants.

Although MoS2, graphene, Cu based fluids have been studied extensively, the fundamental understanding of underlying mechanisms is still needed.|$|E

Shell's Rotella website indicates that on-road testing confirms the new Triple Protection technology produces better <b>anti-wear</b> characteristics than their existing CI-4+ rated Rotella oil. This is achieved despite a lower zinc and phosphorus additive level as {{called for by}} the API CJ-4 specification. (The 15W-40 Rotella T with Triple Protection oil has approximately 1200 ppm of zinc and 1100 ppm phosphorus {{at the time of}} manufacture.) ...|$|E
50|$|The {{lubricity}} of {{a substance}} {{is not a}} material property, and cannot be measured directly. Tests are performed to quantify a lubricant's performance for a specific system. This is often done by determining how much wear is caused to a surface by a given wear-inducing object in a given amount of time. Other factors such as surface size, temperature, and pressure are also specified. For two fluids with the same viscosity, the one that results in a smaller wear scar is considered to have higher lubricity. For this reason lubricity is also termed a substance's <b>anti-wear</b> property.|$|E
5000|$|Gear oil has a {{characteristic}} aroma {{due to the}} addition of sulfur-bearing <b>anti-wear</b> compounds. These compounds are used to reduce the high sliding friction by the helical gear cut of the teeth (this cut eliminates the characteristic whine of straight cut spur gears). On motorcycles with [...] "wet" [...] clutches (clutch is bathed in engine oil), there is usually nothing separating {{the lower part of}} the engine from the transmission, so the same oil lubricates both the engine and transmission. The original Mini placed the gearbox in the oil sump below the engine, thus using the same oil for both. The clutch was however a fairly conventional dry plate clutch.|$|E
50|$|Synchronizing {{rings are}} made of metal and can be {{provided}} with <b>anti-wear</b> coatings called a friction lining.Common metals for synchronizer rings are brass and steel. The linings typically consist of molybdenum, iron, bronze or carbon.The synchronizing rings are produced either by massive forming (common forging) or sheet metal shaping. The latter involves the stamping of the blank out of a sheet metal strip and the subsequent machining with follow-on composite tools or transfer tools. A friction lining usually consists of thermally splashed molybdenum. Alternatively, iron or bronze sinter friction layers can be used. Carbon-coated synchronizer rings are particularly wear resistant and offer very good friction behavior. Due to their higher price, these are reserved for high-performance transmissions.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{molybdenum}} disulfide containing additives to lubricating oils are claimed to reduce friction, bond to metal, or have <b>anti-wear</b> properties. MoS2 particles can be shear-welded on steel surface and some engine components were even treated with MoS2 layer during manufacture, namely liners in engines. (Trabant for example). They {{were used in}} World War II in flight engines and became commercial after World War II until the 1990s. They were commercialized in the 1970s (ELF ANTAR Molygraphite) and are today still available (Liqui Moly MoS2 10 W-40, www.liqui-moly.de). Main disadvantage of {{molybdenum disulfide}} is anthracite black color, so oil treated with {{it is hard to}} distinguish from a soot filled engine oil with metal shavings from spun crankshaft bearing.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the viscosity index improvers, motor oil manufacturers often include other additives such as detergents and dispersants {{to help keep the}} engine clean by minimizing sludge buildup, corrosion inhibitors, and alkaline additives to neutralize acidic oxidation products of the oil. Most commercial oils have a minimal amount of zinc dialkyldithiophosphate as an <b>anti-wear</b> additive to protect contacting metal surfaces with zinc and other compounds in case of metal to metal contact. The quantity of zinc dialkyldithiophosphate is limited to minimize adverse effect on catalytic converters. Another aspect for after-treatment devices is the deposition of oil ash, which increases the exhaust back pressure and reduces fuel economy over time. The so-called [...] "chemical box" [...] limits today the concentrations of sulfur, ash and phosphorus (SAP).|$|E
5000|$|Self-lubricating composites: Solid {{lubricants}} such as PTFE, graphite, MoS2 {{and some}} other anti-friction and <b>anti-wear</b> additives are often compounded in polymers and all kind of sintered materials. MoS2, for example, is compounded in materials for sleeve bearings, elastomer O-rings, carbon brushes, etc. Solid lubricants are compounded in plastics to form a [...] "self-lubricating" [...] or [...] "internally lubricated" [...] thermoplastic composite. For example, PTFE particles compounded in the plastic form a PTFE film over the mating surface, resulting in a reduction of friction and wear. MoS2 compounded in nylon reduces wear, friction and stick-slip. Furthermore, it acts as a nucleating agent effecting in a very fine crystalline structure. The primary use of graphite lubricated thermoplastics is in applications operating in aqueous environments.|$|E
5000|$|All {{the current}} {{gasoline}} categories (including the obsolete SH) have placed {{limitations on the}} phosphorus content for certain SAE viscosity grades (the xW-20, xW-30) due to the chemical poisoning that phosphorus has on catalytic converters. Phosphorus is a key <b>anti-wear</b> component in motor oil and is usually found in motor oil {{in the form of}} zinc dithiophosphate (ZDDP). Each new API category has placed successively lower phosphorus and zinc limits, and thus has created a controversial issue of obsolescent oils needed for older engines, especially engines with sliding (flat/cleave) tappets. API and ILSAC, which represents most of the world's major automobile/engine manufacturers, state API SM/ILSAC GF-4 is fully backwards compatible, and it is noted that one of the engine tests required for API SM, the Sequence IVA, is a sliding tappet design to test specifically for cam wear protection. Not everyone is in agreement with backwards compatibility, and in addition, there are special situations, such as [...] "performance" [...] engines or fully race built engines, where the engine protection requirements are above and beyond API/ILSAC requirements. Because of this, there are specialty oils out in the market place with higher than API allowed phosphorus levels. Most engines built before 1985 have the flat/cleave bearing style systems of construction, which is sensitive to reducing zinc and phosphorus. For example, in API SG rated oils, this was at the 1200-1300 ppm level for zinc and phosphorus, where the current SM is under 600 ppm. This reduction in <b>anti-wear</b> chemicals in oil has caused premature failures of camshafts and other high pressure bearings in many older automobiles and has been blamed for premature failure of the oil pump drive/cam position sensor gear that is meshed with camshaft gear in some modern engines.|$|E
5000|$|Sperm oil is a waxy liquid {{obtained}} from sperm whales. It is a clear, yellowish liquid {{with a very}} faint odor. Sperm oil has a different composition from common whale oil. Although it is traditionally called an [...] "oil", it is technically a liquid wax. It is composed of wax esters with {{a small proportion of}} triglycerides, an ester of an unsaturated fatty acid and a branched-chain fatty alcohol. It is a natural antioxidant and heat-transfer agent. Through catalytic reaction, it carries phosphorus and sulfur derivatives providing <b>anti-wear</b> and friction modification. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, sperm oil was prized as an illuminant for its bright, odorless flame and as a lubricant for its low viscosity and stability. It was supplanted in the late 19th century by less expensive alternatives such as kerosene and petroleum-based lubricants. With the 1987 international ban on whaling, sperm oil is no longer legally sold.|$|E
5000|$|Modern ATF {{typically}} {{contains a}} wide variety of chemical compounds intended to provide the required properties of a particular ATF specification. Most ATFs contain some combination of additives that improve lubricating qualities, such as <b>anti-wear</b> additives, rust and corrosion inhibitors, detergents, dispersants and surfactants (which protect and clean metal surfaces); kinematic viscosity and viscosity index improvers and modifiers, seal swell additives and agents (which extend the rotational speed range and temperature range of the additives' application); anti-foam additives and anti-oxidation compounds to inhibit oxidation and [...] "boil-off" [...] (which extends the life of the additives' application); cold-flow improvers, high-temperature thickeners, gasket conditioners, pour point depressant and petroleum dye. All ATFs contain friction modifiers, except for those ATFs specified for some Ford transmissions and the John Deere J-21A specification; the Ford ESP (or ESW) - M2C-33 F specification Type F ATF (Ford-O-Matic) and Ford ESP (or ESW) - M2C-33 G specification Type G ATF (1980s Ford Europe and Japan) specifically excludes the addition of friction modifiers. According to the same oil distributor, the M2C-33 G specification requires fluids which provide improved shear resistance and oxidation protection, better low-temperature fluidity, better EP (extreme pressure) properties and additional seal tests over and above M2C-33 F quality fluids.|$|E
50|$|Through {{the late}} 1970s, Ford {{transmissions}} were factory {{filled with a}} fluid identified as ESW M2C33-F. To provide a fluid that {{would be available to}} the general public for service fill, oil companies and other than factory fill suppliers were allowed to develop fluids meeting the ESW M2C33-F specification and market these fluids under their own brand names but identified as Type F. A second generation of transmission fluid was released in 1974 as the factory fill specification, ESW M2C138-CJ. This fluid was developed to modify the vehicle shifting characteristics and to provide considerable improvement in the oxidation resistance and <b>anti-wear</b> performance. No service fluids were developed and for a short time, DEXRON fluids approved by General Motors were considered acceptable.With continuing changes and improvements in transmission design, a centrifugal lock-up torque converter clutch was introduced into the C5 transmission to smooth engine vibrations sensed by the occupant of the vehicle. An associated shudder problem forced the introduction of the factory fill specification ESP M2C166-H. Servicing transmissions with DEXRON fluids was unacceptable since not all DEXRON fluids were capable of eliminating the shudder phenomenon. The fluids that could be used were a subset of the DEXRON fluids.The advent of Type H as factory fill necessitated the development of a service fluid specification to match the performance expected from Type H. This resulted in the release of the MERCON specification in 1987.|$|E
5000|$|The main use of ZDDP is in <b>anti-wear</b> {{additives}} to lubricants such as greases, gear oils, {{and motor}} oils, which usually contain from 600ppm for some modern energy conserving low viscosity oils to 2000ppm of this additive in some racing oils. It {{has been reported}} that zinc and phosphorus emissions may damage catalytic converters and standard formulations of lubricating oils for gasoline engines now have reduced amounts of the additive due to the API limiting the concentration of this additive in new API SM and SN oils, however this only affects 20 and 30 grade [...] "ILSAC" [...] oils, 40 and higher grades have no regulation regarding the concentration of ZDDP except for diesel oils meeting the API CJ-4 specification which have had the level of zddp reduced slightly, although most diesel Heavy Duty Engine oils still have a higher concentration of this additive. [...] Crankcase oils with reduced ZDDP have been cited as causing damage to, or failure of, classic/collector car flat tappet camshafts and lifters which undergo very high boundary layer pressures and/or shear forces at their contact faces, and in other regions such as big-end/main bearings, and piston rings and pins. Roller camshafts/followers are more commonly used to reduce camshaft lobe friction in modern engines. There are additives, such as STP(R) Oil Treatment, and some racing oils such as PurOl, Brad Penn and Valvoline VR-1, which are available in the retail market with the necessary amount of ZDDP for engines using increased valve spring pressures. The same ZDDP compounds serve also as corrosion inhibitors and antioxidants.|$|E

The study {{focuses on the}} effect of the solution bulk temperatures and the copolymer block structures. It was found that the concentration and the length of the copolymer blocks affect the solution cloud points, friction and <b>anti-wear</b> property. When solution was supplied at bulk temperature above their cloud point, aqueous copolymer solutions were not able to develop effective adsorbed film resulting in high friction and severe wear. When the bulk temperatures were below the cloud point, the <b>anti-wear</b> property improved significantly and the dynamic friction is lower than that when the temperatures were above the cloud point. This demonstrates the importance of the supply temperature of this type of lubricant in metal forming.

40|$|The {{development}} of improved <b>anti-wear</b> additives {{would enable the}} use of lower viscosity oils {{that would lead to}} improved efficiency. Ionic liquids have the potential to be this type of new <b>anti-wear</b> additive. However, currently the best performing ionic liquids that are miscible in non-polar base oils, the phosphonium phosphates, contain phosphorus on both the cation and anion. Manufacturers are seeking to reduce the presence of phosphorus in oils. Here, as a first step towards phosphorus-free <b>anti-wear</b> additives, we have investigated ionic liquids similar to the phosphonium phosphates but having either a phosphorus-free cation or anion. Two quaternary ammonium phosphates (N 6, 6, 6, 14) (BEHP) and (N 8, 8, 8, 8) (BEHP) and a phosphonium silyl-sulfonate (P 6, 6, 6, 14) (SSi) were compared to a phosphonium phosphate (P 6, 6, 6, 14) (BEHP) and a traditional zinc dithiophosphate (ZDDP) as <b>anti-wear</b> additives in mineral oil. The change from a phosphonium to a quaternary ammonium cation drastically reduced the miscibility of the Ionic liquid (IL) in the oil, while the change to a smaller silicon containing anion also resulted in limited miscibility. For the pin-on-disk wear test conditions used here none of the ionic liquids outperformed the ZDDP except the (P 6, 6, 6, 14) (BEHP) at a relatively high loading of 0. 10 mol·kg− 1 (approximately 8 wt%). At a more moderate loading of 0. 025 mol·kg− 1 the (P 6, 6, 6, 14) (SSi) was the best performing ionic liquid by a significant amount, reducing the wear to 44 % of the neat mineral oil, while the ZDDP reduced the wear to 25 % of the mineral oil value. Electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy showed that the presence of a silicon containing tribofilm was responsible for this protective behaviour, suggesting that silicon containing ionic liquids should be further investigated as <b>anti-wear</b> additives for oils...|$|E
