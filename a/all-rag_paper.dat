40|$|In {{order to}} {{establish}} specific procedures for processing, cataloging and classifying the art print collection at the Kentucky Library, Western Kentucky University, data were gathered from three sources. These were: (1) information on current procedures used in the Kentucky Library, obtained through an interview with Riley Handy, the Kentucky Librarian (2) a search of related literature and (3) a questionnaire survey of other institution having art print collections. It was found that historically valuable art prints, which are used primarily as documentary resources, need to be carefully processed and stored so as to preserve and protect them from damaging effects of light, temperature change, humidity and dust. Effective preservation techniques include: (1) controlling the light, temperature and humidity in the building through installation of modern air conditioning units, electronic air filters and artificial light filters; (2) making photographs of the art prints so that the copies rather the original prints {{can be used by}} the patrons; (3) placing the prints in <b>all-rag</b> <b>paper</b> or Mylar plastic folders which are then stored flat in dustproof acid free paper boxes or steel map cases; and (4) having damaged prints restored only by professional prints conservationists who use reversible restoration techniques. In regard to cataloging, it was found that historically valuable prints should be individually cataloged and should be organized in either a classified system or in numerical arrangement. Although no central reporting agency exists for disseminating information about art prints, the findings indicate the advisability of each institution publicizing its own art print holdings...|$|E

5000|$|Even while Pagenstecher was {{starting}} up the Hudson River mill, in 1869 Illustrious Remington {{and his three}} sons, Hiram, Alfred D. and Charles R., were making a ton of newsprint daily in Watertown, New York, using four rag machines and an 84" [...] fourdrinier machine. By 1870, the Remingtons, seeing a future for wood pulp, built three mills on Sewall's Island in Watertown. These mills used the Voelter process allowing a low-cost, high-quality Remington newsprint {{to be made of}} 75% rags and 25% wood pulp instead of <b>all-rag</b> content <b>paper</b> costing five times more. A third invention caught the imagination of the Remingtons. In 1867, Benjamin Tilghman, an American chemist, discovered that sulphurous acid (H2SO3) dissolved the lignin in wood, leaving a residue of cellulose fibers. Nought came of this discovery. However, Alfred D. Remington learned that a Swede, Carl Daniel Ekman, was teaching papermakers in Sweden to make paper entirely out of wood pulp by using a sulphite process (SO3). Remington went to Sweden to see [...] "This Miracle" [...] for himself. He was so impressed that he imported Swedish chemical fiber for several years and later developed the [...] "sulphite process" [...] in his own plant on Sewall's Island. The Remingtons were selling newsprint to the New York Times. They received an order for ten tons stipulating that the newsprint contain no wood pulp! A. D. Remington, proud of his new product, sent it to the Times along with a note, asking them to try it. The reply was, [...] "come and get your paper", which he did. It wasn't long before the Times was eager and willing to buy this new and cheaper newsprint. The revolution in paper-making in the Black River region was complete: fourdrinier machines became bigger and bigger and faster and faster; the demand for spruce was insatiable and the lumbermen practically denuded the virgin forests; the unpleasant odor of the sulphite mills replaced the equally unpleasant odor of the tanneries. Other paper-makers, emulating the success of the Remingtons embarked on a costly program of mass-production of wood pulp newsprint.|$|R
