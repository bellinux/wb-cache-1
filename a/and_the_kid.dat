50|$|Although it boasted {{a brand-new}} {{facility}} <b>and</b> good directors, <b>the</b> MGM cartoon studio's first series was a failure. <b>The</b> Captain <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kids,</b> adapted from Rudolph Dirks' Katzenjammer Kids characters, was licensed by MGM without input from its then-forming creative staff. Freleng, Hanna, and Allen, assigned to direct <b>the</b> Captain <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kids</b> cartoons, {{were unable to}} translate the Katzenjammer humor into animation, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> series folded after fifteen episodes. Only two of <b>the</b> Captain <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kids</b> shorts were produced in Technicolor; the other thirteen were produced in black-and-white and released in sepia-toned prints.|$|R

5|$|If {{the player}} plays as the Kid, Sara is trapped in LeMU instead of Coco; the Kid {{frequently}} has visions of Coco, {{but no one}} else sees her. The group manages to contact the surface, and open and close doors to various rooms in LeMU to move the water around, allowing them to escape. After having played the game as both Takeshi <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kid,</b> the player accesses the final route, in which it is revealed that while the events Takeshi experienced took place in 2017, those the Kid experienced were a recreation, and took place in a rebuilt LeMU in 2034. The You of 2017, whose full first name is Yubiseiharukana, had artificially impregnated herself and given birth to Yubiseiakikana, who took the role of You during the recreation. Pipi had escaped LeMU in 2017, carrying with it the disk with Sora's memories and footage of Coco being trapped in IBF. Sara <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> are revealed to be Tsugumi and Takeshi's children, and the Kid's real name turns out to be Hokuto. The Kid of 2017, whose name is Ryogo Kaburaki, played the role of Takeshi during the recreation, having stopped aging due to the Cure virus.|$|E

5|$|The {{big game}} starts with six players, {{including}} Howard <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kid,</b> with Shooter playing as he deals and Lady Fingers relieving him whenever Shooter needs a break. In {{the first big}} confrontation between the Kid and Howard, the Kid is short $2,000 and Slade steps in to stake him. Several hours later, Howard busts a player called Pig, perhaps with a bluff, and the remaining players take a break. Following the break, Lady Fingers, who has been delighting in needling Howard all evening, takes over as dealer and continues to needle him.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} two player {{character}}s: Takeshi Kuranari <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kid.</b> Depending {{on the character}} the player plays as, they get to build relationships with different characters: for instance, the player can become close to Tsugumi Komachi when playing as Takeshi, who just is a supporting character when playing as the Kid. The player character is not chosen directly; instead, a decision the player makes during a blackout {{in the beginning of}} the game determines who they will play as.|$|E
5|$|As {{the game}} wears on, Shooter only deals, {{and then after}} another hand when Howard outplays them, two more players, Yeller and Sokal, drop out. That leaves just Howard <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kid.</b> After a few {{unlikely}} wins, the Kid calls for a break and confronts Shooter, who admits to being forced into cheating by Slade. The Kid insists he can win {{on his own and}} tells Shooter to deal straight or he will blow the whistle, destroying Shooter's reputation. Before the game resumes, Melba succeeds in seducing the Kid. Christian makes a surprise visit to the room, catches them after the fact and walks out on The Kid.|$|E

50|$|After {{a series}} of legal battles between 1912 and 1914, Dirks left <b>the</b> Hearst {{organization}} <b>and</b> began a new strip, first titled Hans and Fritz <b>and</b> then <b>The</b> Captain <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kids.</b> It featured <b>the</b> same characters seen in <b>The</b> Katzenjammer <b>Kids,</b> which was continued by Knerr. The two separate versions of the strip competed with each other until 1979, when <b>The</b> Captain <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kids</b> ended its six-decade run. <b>The</b> Katzenjammer <b>Kids</b> is still distributed by King Features, making it the oldest comic strip still in syndication <b>and</b> <b>the</b> longest-running ever.|$|R

5|$|Two of {{the matches}} at SummerSlam 1993 were {{a result of}} Razor Ramon's loss to The Kid (later the 1-2-3 Kid) on the May 17, 1993 edition of Monday Night Raw. Following Ramon's loss to the newcomer, Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster) teased Ramon about the match. DiBiase offered Ramon {{a job as a}} servant, which Ramon angrily refused. Ramon began teaming with the 1-2-3 Kid for a series of matches against Money Inc. DiBiase asked for a singles match against the Kid, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> {{accepted}} the challenge. Ramon helped the Kid win the match by distracting DiBiase. It was decided that the feuds would be settled in two singles matches at SummerSlam, with Ramon facing DiBiase and Schyster facing the 1-2-3 Kid.|$|E

500|$|Malathi Rangarajan, in her {{review of}} Deiva Thirumagal (2011) said, [...] "Probably because {{the scene of}} action is Ooty, the main {{character}} is mentally challenged, and the story-telling sequence with Vikram <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>kid</b> is familiar, at times [...] reminds you of Balu Mahendra's inimitable Moondraam Pirai." [...] Baradwaj Rangan compares a scene in Barfi! (2012), where Barfi (Ranbir Kapoor) goes after Shruti (Ileana D'Cruz) and stumbles, to that of Moondram Pirais climax scene. Balu Mahendra's defunct blog is also titled Moondram Pirai..., named after the film.|$|E

500|$|Robinson {{continued}} to play football without tying his shoelaces and became known as [...] "Shoelace." [...] One reporter who visited his family to watch a Michigan game noted, [...] "To everyone in Deerfield Beach – everyone but his mother, that is – there is no Denard, just Shoelace." [...] Robinson's high school coach, Art Taylor, explained his rationale for accepting the practice:"After 25 years coaching, if the kid can throw it 90 yards {{in the air and}} is accurate <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>kid</b> can run as fast as he does ... as long as he feels comfortable, not lacing his shoes, fine with me. The kid's been doing it all his life, why mess with it?" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} routes {{were divided}} between Takeshi <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> {{according to what}} made sense for the plot, rather than {{in an effort to}} pair up the player characters with specific female characters. Although the routes were given a recommended playing order, this did not occur until around the time the scenario was finished. According to Nakazawa, bad endings were painful to write, but were included both as foils to the good ending to increase the sense of accomplishment in reaching the good ending, and as [...] "what if?" [...] events that give the story variety, showing what would have happened had events played out differently. The game's epilogue was not originally planned, but was written by Uchikoshi in three days after being advised by Nakazawa. When a PlayStation Portable version was developed, Nakazawa was asked to create new content for it; as it would have been hard to expand the story or add new event computer graphics artwork (CGs), it was decided to create an in-game dictionary explaining terms used to allow players to enjoy the game on a deeper level.|$|E

2500|$|For a {{long time}} before it was formalised, it had been known by doctors and {{midwives}} that mouth to mouth resuscitation could be useful in bringing a lifeless newborn around. In 1946, during the middle of a polio outbreak, an anesthesiologist, James Elam, applied this principle to an older child in an emergency situation. Elam described the event in his own words as [...] "I was browsing around to get acquainted with the ward when along the corridor came a gurney racing - a nurse pulling it and two orderlies pushing it, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>kid</b> on it was blue. [...] I went into total reflex behaviour. [...] I stepped {{out in the middle of}} the corridor, stopped the gurney, grabbed the sheet, wiped the copious mucous off his mouth and face, … sealed my lips around his nose and inflated his lungs. [...] In four breaths he was pink." ...|$|E
