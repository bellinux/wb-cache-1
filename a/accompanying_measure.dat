30|$|It is also {{interesting}} to note that childcare was not the only family policy introduced in the early 2000 s. In 2005, maternal leave was established, providing a federal minimum of 14  weeks at 80 % of normal salary. This federal legislation was largely a legal confirmation of what the vast majority of employers had established in the early 1990 s. Since it was designed in many ways to set a minimum for special cases (e.g., women in their first year of employment), paid maternity leave should be seen as an <b>accompanying</b> <b>measure</b> to childcare, and not as a major reform. The experiences of other countries also show that job continuity is not affected if leave entitlements are for up to 17 – 18  weeks (Baker and Milligan 2008), which is much longer than what has been legally established in Switzerland. On top of that, some cantons reformed their constitutions to establish a legal enforcement of after-school care. As illustrated by Felfe et al. (2016), this legal enforcement, however, had an impact only in the German-speaking part of Switzerland, where after-school care was particularly underdeveloped.|$|E

But it also has developed from the adoption of political declarations which are not legally binding – such as the 1989 Community Charter of fundamental social rights of workers and the 2000 Charter of fundamental rights –, from European social dialogue, and from the “open” coordination between theMember States in the fields of employment and social inclusion.

40|$|The {{current study}} proposes a three-factor model of group {{collective}} efficacy beliefs (GCE; Bandura, 1997), and the <b>accompanying</b> <b>measure,</b> {{grounded in the}} following distinct domains of abilities: group task management (GCE-task), management of the relationships among group members (GCE-relationships), {{and management of the}} emotions that arise within the group (GCE-emotions). We also test a multilevel model wherein the three-factor GCE (i. e., GCE-task, GCE-relations, GCE-emotions) mediates the negative relationship between individual-level fear of dominance (i. e., a feeling of fear due to the actions of other group members who attack teammates) and objective team performance (i. e., team ranking {{at the end of the}} season). The study involved 315 athletes playing in 38 independent sport teams from 23 sport specialties. Results from the confirmatory factor analytic approach supported the validity of the three-dimension GCE scale. Moreover, although individual-level fear of dominance was found to be negatively related to the three facets of GCE, it only exerted a negative indirect effect on team performance through GCE-emotions, thus demonstrating how members’ shared beliefs in distinct group capabilities shape teams’ outcomes. These findings enable us to: 1) establish the distinctiveness of three domains of GCE beliefs shared among group members (i. e., GCE-task, GCE-relations, GCE-emotions), 2) explore the extent to which these GCE beliefs are impaired by fear of dominance, 3) assess their differential effects on team results, and 4) examine the emergence of the role of emotion-related efficacy beliefs in predicting group results...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{acknowledged}} {{the relevance of}} assessing the measurement equivalence of safety related measures across different groups, and demonstrating whether the existence of disparities in safety perceptions might impair direct group comparisons. The Griffin and Neal (2000) model of safety climate, and the <b>accompanying</b> <b>measure</b> (Neal et al. [NGH], 2000), are both widely cited and utilized. Yet neither the model in its entirety nor the measure have been previously validated across different national contexts. The current study {{is the first to}} examine the NGH measurement equivalence by testing whether their model of safety climate predicting safety performance is tenable in both English speaking and non- English speaking countries. The study involved 616 employees from 21 organizations in the US, and 738 employees from 20 organizations in Italy. A multi-group confirmatory factor analytic approach was used to assess the equivalence of the measures across the two countries. Similarly, the structural model of relations among the NGH variables was examined in order to demonstrate its cross-country invariance. Results substantially support strict invariance across groups for the NGH safety scales. Moreover, the invariance across countries is also demonstrated for the effects of safety climate on safety knowledge and motivation, which in turn positively relate to both compliance and participation. Our findings have relevant theoretical implications by establishing measurement and relational equivalence of the NGH model. Practical implications are discussed for managers and practitioners dealing with multi-national organizational contexts. Future research should continue to investigate potential differences in safety related perceptions across additional non-English speaking countries...|$|E
40|$|The paper proposes some {{hypotheses}} {{about the way}} in which the EU contributes via its MEDA Programme to the promotion of intra-regional economic co-operation among Mediterranean non-member countries. It argues that MEDA is indeed an important political and economic measure to create favourable conditions for increased trade and investment among Mediterranean non-member countries. Notwithstanding this general proposition, an institutionalist analysis of the implementation process of the MEDA Programmes for the years 1995 - 1999 reveals that deadlocks within the EU policy-making process have significantly weakened the overall success of financial and technical assistance. The paper provides an in-depth empirical analysis of the MEDA Programme and its contribution to enhance intra-regional economic co-operation. It argues that only if the institutional deadlocks can be overcome can MEDA function as the envisaged <b>accompanying</b> <b>measure</b> to the reform of Mediterranean non-member countries economic and social structures and, thereby, provide the basis for increased intra-regional economic co-operation. Recent reforms at the EU level have, at least partially, addressed the most pertinent shortcomings of the first five years of the operation of MEDA. However, political declarations, such as the Common Strategy on the Mediterranean, cast some serious doubts on whether the EU has the political will to underpin these organisational reforms with the necessary political leadership. This dilemma between cautious organisational reforms, on the one hand, and political stagnation, on the other, ultimately weakens the contribution the EU could make to foster economic co-operation among Mediterranean non-member countries via the MEDA system.

40|$|The {{so called}} refugee crisis of 2015 had several effects, among which the {{definitive}} {{demonstration of the}} unsustainability of the Dublin system and the need of a radical change in the modalities of allocation of the competence for the exam of asylum claims in the EU. The same credibility of the EU is at stake, {{as well as the}} capacities of national governments to manage the relevant flows reaching the Schengen area. This Policy Brief provides sound arguments both for supporting the demand for a new legal framework, and for the determination of new criteria which combines fairness, realism, solidarity, cooperation. A quota approach would be combined with a “genuine link” approach, thus trying to find a proper balance between the States’ interests and the point of view (and related behaviors) of asylum seekers, and also between the objections of human rights defenders and the concerns of European public opinion. The need to turn the page with the Dublin age warmly suggests to choose, for the new proposed regulation, a nick name which evokes the features of the current historical (and dramatic) passage of European integration and our deep sense of belonging to a place where much part of our way of thinking and of being a society is rooted: Athens. Having regard to the lessons learnt from decades of regulation of the determination of jurisdiction in civil, commercial and criminal matters, a first step to take is the adoption of a new conception for the role of the asylum seeker, who should be allocated to the State with which he/she holds a substantial link: the configuration of the relevant connecting factors (family relations; economic or social ties) should pay due regard to the empirical dimension of the phenomenon and to the need to avoid unnecessary sufferance and waste of public funds and time. If the asylum seeker has genuine links with more States, a certain relevance to his/her free choice should be awarded. Lacking any connection with a given country, the State with the lowest performance in fulfilling its reference quota should be the competent one. In the same time, an already overburdened country should be afforded the possibility to refuse responsibility, provided that some basic family ties are safeguarded. In such cases, a less connected country should be responsible, or the one less engaged in hosting asylum seekers and refugees, or as extrema ratio the country of first entrance or where the application is lodged. Whether an asylum seeker is allocated to a country where he/she does not have any substantial link and his/her asylum claim receives a positive outcome, the possibility of accepting a genuine job offer in another Member State should be admitted. This way, a partial freedom of circulation for work purposes could be recognized, but its exercise would relieve the first Member State by protection duties. As an <b>accompanying</b> <b>measure,</b> a system of financial incentives/disincentives for Member States should be conceived...|$|E
40|$|Das Krankheitsbild des Chylothorax ist selten und hat vielfältige Ursachen. Einen allgemeingültigen Behandlungspfad gibt es nicht. Die primäre oder zumindest unterstützende konservative Therapie mit diätetischen Maßnahmen wie Nahrungskarenz mit parenteraler Ernährung bzw. MCT-Diät zählt zur Basistherapie. Die operativen Techniken zielen ab auf eine Pleurodese mittels Pleurektomie oder Talkuminsufflation bzw. einen direkten Verschluss der Leckage des Chylusaustrittes. Der Behandlungserfolg des Chylothorax mit Somatostatin-Analoga wie Octreotid bei Kindern, motivierte in der klinischen Praxis zum Off-Label-Use von Octreotid auch bei Erwachsenen. Aufgrund der niedrigen Prävalenz des Chylothorax gibt es jedoch nur wenige dokumentierte Einzelfallberichte über die meist positiven Ergebnisse der Octreotid-Therapie (OCT) und mögliche Nebenwirkungen. In unserer retrospektiven Kohorten-Studie wurden die Behandlungsergebnisse aller Patienten verglichen, die im Zeitraum von 2000 bis 2010 in der thoraxchirurgischen Abteilung der Klinik Schillerhöhe wegen eines Chylothorax behandelt wurden. Ziel der Auswertung war eine Überprüfung der Wirksamkeit von Octreotid bei der Therapie von Erwachsenen mit einem primären oder sekundären Chylothorax. Des Weiteren sollten mögliche Nebenwirkungen anhand des bekannten Nebenwirkungsprofils aus der Pädiatrie bzw. aus den zugelassenen Anwendungen identifiziert werden. Aus insgesamt 35 Behandlungsfällen wurden 25 in die Studie eingeschlossen, davon erfolgte in 14 Fällen eine Behandlung ohne Octreotid OCT(-), in 11 Fällen wurde der Chylothorax mit Octreotid OCT(+) behandelt. In der vorliegenden Studie konnte keine signifikante Verbesserung des Krankheitsverlaufes durch die unterstützende Therapie mit Octreotid festgestellt werden. Unsere Ergebnisse zeigen, dass eine medikamentöse Therapie des sekundären Chylothorax mit Octreotid tendenziell zu einer Zunahme der Thoraxdrainagenverluste und konsekutiv zu einer Verlängerung der Thoraxdrainagentherapie, sowie zu einer signifikanten Verlängerung der Diätdauer führt. Die Krankenhausverweildauer als indirekter Hinweis auf den Erfolg einer Therapie, war in der OCT(+) Gruppe beim sekundären Chylothorax tendenziell verlängert. Die Gabe von Octreotid bei erwachsenen Patienten mit Chylothorax führte nicht zu den aus der Pädiatrie bekannten medikamentenassoziierten Nebenwirkungen. Ein Patient verstarb unter OCT im fulminanten Multiorganversagen, ein Zusammenhang zur OCT konnte jedoch nicht nachgewiesen werden. Es handelt sich bei vorliegender Untersuchung um die nach unserem Wissen derzeit umfassendste Analyse bezüglich der Wirksamkeit und des Nebenwirkungsprofils von Octreotid bei der Behandlung des primären und sekundären Chylothorax bei Erwachsenen. Die Indikation zur Therapie des Chylothorax mit Octreotid bei Erwachsenen sollte kritisch gestellt werden, da aufgrund der Ergebnisse dieser Studie kein Nutzen nachweisbar ist. The {{chylothorax}} is a {{very rare}} disease caused by different factors. A general treatment procedure is not available. Food abstinence or MCT (medium chain triglycerides) diet {{is used in the}} primary conservative therapy or as an <b>accompanying</b> <b>measure.</b> Surgical interventional options are targeted towards pleurodesis, chemical or surgical, or the direct occlusion of the leakage in the thoracic duct. Motivated by the beneficial treatment with somatostatin analogs in children, octreotide is also used as an off-label-use medication in adults in the clinical practice. Because of the low prevalence of the chylothorax {{there are only a few}} case-reports available which are documenting the side-effects of the octreotide therapy and mainly positive results. This retrospective cohort study evaluates the result of the treatment of all patients suffering from chylothorax between 2000 and 2010 at the Department of Thoracic Surgery at the Clinic Schillerhöhe in Germany. The purpose of this study is to verify the effectiveness of the octreotide therapy in adults with a primary or secondary chylothorax. Furthermore it aims to identify potential side-effects, also known from pediatric treatment and other already approved applications. From all the available 35 chylothorax case-reports, 25 were included into this study. In 11 cases octreotide was used in the therapy of the chylothorax OCT(+), while in the other 14 cases octreotide was not used as medication OCT(-). As a result of this study, using octreotide in the treatment of the chylothorax in adults did not show any significant benefits to the course of the disease. In case of the secondary chylothorax the result shows that the octreotide medication leads to a by trend increased thoracic chylous drainage and consecutively to a lengthen duration of the thoracic drainage therapy as well as to a significant lengthening in the duration of the diet therapy. The number of days patients stay in hospital, as a direct indicator for the effectiveness of the therapy, was increased by trend with the secondary chylothorax in the OCT(+) group. The treatment with octreotide in adults did not lead to the side-effects which are known from pediatric usage. One patient died under octreotide therapy on a fulminant multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. However, a connection to the octreotide therapy could not be proved. It is worth to say that, to our knowledge, this study is currently the most comprehensive study available that deals with the analysis of the effectiveness and the side-effects of the octreotide therapy in adults with primary or secondary chylothorax. The indication for an octreotide therapy in adult chylothorax patients should be determined critically, since this study cannot confirm any benefits to the course of the disease...|$|E
40|$|Selina project {{website at}} [URL] PDF {{available}} online at [URL] audienceThis document {{provides an overview of}} the most important results of the Intelligent Energy Europe (IEE) Project SELINA - Standby and Off-Mode Energy Losses In New Appliances Measured in Shops. Standby power is a general term commonly used to describe the low power modes in which many electrical and electronic products are, when not performing their main function. For more than a decade, it has been recognized that the energy consumption in low power modes for electrical and electronic products is an important issue because it represent permanent loads (sometimes up to 24 hours per day) of a huge number of products. With the 1 W standby initiative of the International Energy Agency (IEA), several low power mode measurement campaigns have been led on a regular basis in a number of countries outside and inside Europe Union (EU). Based on these results and on the Energy-using Products Study Lot 6, the EU has prepared new regulation to limit the standby and off-mode power consumption of non-networked household electronic and electrical equipment, which is being applied since January 2010. The IEE project SELINA carried out a large scale monitoring campaign in shops in order to characterise the low power modes of new appliances being sold in the EU market. In order to ensure consistency of the collected data, a common measurement methodology was developed and the same high resolution measurement equipment was used by all partners. This document analyzes the results of more than 6000 different equipments measured in the 12 EU countries involved in the project. Standby and off-mode values by product categories were analysed and compared with data from other regions of the World. The measurements were also benchmarked against the new 2010 / 2013 EU standby and off mode regulation thresholds and the impact of the EU regulation is discussed. It was found that 18. 5 % of the equipments, whose off-mode power was measured, do not respect the EU regulation threshold of 1 W. When the measurements are compared to the 2013 threshold of 0. 5 W, this percentage raises up to 41. 5 %. Regarding standby mode input power, 31 % of the measured products did not comply with EU regulation limit for the 2010 threshold. When the standby measured values are compared to the 2013 limit, the number of products over the EU regulation target increases to 66. 4 %. When comparing the 2009 and 2010 measurements, only a slight decrease of the share of appliances exceeding the EU regulation limits was observed. In parallel with the measurement campaign, an awareness study of the retailers was carried out. This survey helps to understand the customers' buying motivations and the influence of retailers' advice in their choices. The results of the survey show that, despite of retailer's consciousness about the energy consumption and energy labels of the products, other types of sales arguments like the appliance price or functionalities are more frequently used to sell a product. This could be due to lack of visible information in shops related to the equipment energy consumption. Furthermore, the results show that retailers try to adapt their advice to the customers' needs (price and product functionalities). The retailers admitted that publishing more information regarding the energy consumption of products and some kind of cost saving calculator/reference would make the clients to opt for more efficient equipments. Based on the survey results and on the analysis of different existing policies targeting electrical and electronic products in Europe, examples of policies to improve the low power modes situation of the EU market are reviewed. The survey on measures enhancing the market transformation towards more energy-efficient electrical appliances showed a wide range of actions and policy tools in the SELINA partner countries. In national workshops, which mainly took place in the late summer/early autumn 2010, these measures were presented and discussed with all relevant national stakeholders. In most countries, information campaigns (esp. brochures, leaflets, websites, and national labels) are the dominating measure type. In some countries, however, financial subsidies for very energy-efficient appliances, often paid by an energy utility and not by the government, play an important role, too (e. g. in the Czech Republic or Switzerland). In general, the impact of a financial programme is easier to quantify than the single impact of an information campaign, which often serves as an <b>accompanying</b> <b>measure</b> for regulations (labels, minimum efficiency standards) or fiscal and financial measures. International cooperation with key institutions outside the EU, involved in similar efforts, such as the IEA Implementing Agreement 4 E (Efficient Electrical End-use Equipment) with an Annex on Standby, the Energy Star/EPA in USA, the Australia Standby Initiative and the Swiss Federal Office of Energy, were used to promote synergies in the definition of common approaches to characterize the market and to define realistic and cost-effective performance targets which can be achieved in a short time frame. Special care is required when promoting low standby consumption products (without consideration of other attributes) to ensure that there are no perverse effects such as the inadvertent promotion of products with low active mode efficiency and high energy consumption. It is desirable to follow a vertical approach to standby, where low power modes are combined with active modes to give total energy consumption. This approach is particularly preferable for products where the total energy consumption is significant. The definition of usage patterns under such a vertical approach is necessarily product specific and this could vary by region or country. The new technologies offer many opportunities for energy savings potential but there are also some threats which need to be recognized and understood. There is a strong need to ensure that energy saving paradigms and strategies become a core consideration in future product designs. It is recognized that equipments connected to networks are of growing importance. It is recommended that increased efforts to compile data and measurements, of networked products, {{from a variety of sources}} in order to obtain better information on networked product characteristics, needs to be made. An online database was created so that everyone can access the input power values, in the different equipment low power modes, of the more than 6000 equipments measured. A Standby Calculator Tool was also developed and can be accessed through the project website. It can be used to calculate the consumed energy, the annual cost and the equivalent CO 2 emissions. In order to compare the results in an easy way, a diagram that shows the energy consumption of the different models is presented. Furthermore, the values for the most efficient device are also showed, in order to have an additional comparison. One of the main objectives of this project was to identify effective market transformation policies initiatives targeted at all the key stakeholders involved in the manufacture, distribution, sales, purchasing and operation of appliances with standby and off-mode losses. As a result of the future policy actions that may appear after the end of the project, considering loads in networked mode, it is expected to achieve very large cost-effective savings of electricity (80 TWh projected by 2020) and carbon emissions (30 MTons of CO 2 by 2020) ...|$|E
5000|$|To {{increase}} {{the benefits of}} mass deworming and to lower the rate of reinfection, <b>accompanying</b> <b>measures</b> of mass deworming programmes should include water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) interventions. A good example for such a combined intervention is the Essential Health Care Program implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines: This national programme combines twice annual deworming of school children with group handwashing with soap at set {{times of the day}} at the school premises. This so-called [...] "Fit for School" [...] approach has also been implemented in Indonesia in 2014.|$|R
40|$|In 2006, the European Union {{reformed}} its sugar regime, {{reducing the}} price for sugar by 36 %. To cushion the impact on traditional overseas suppliers, an ‘Aid for Trade’ programme called the <b>Accompanying</b> <b>Measures</b> for Sugar Protocol countries (AMSP) was implemented. This paper explores the impacts of the AMSP in Swaziland. The authors discuss emergent agrarian class differentiation and argue that the benefits experienced by farmers are jeopardised by ongoing processes of liberalisation. The paper concludes by suggesting that donors must consider market stabilisation and corporate regulation {{if they are to}} make ‘Aid for Trade’ work for the poor...|$|R
40|$|From {{the first}} {{restructuring}} initiative in 1990 {{to the latest}} in 1995, {{more and more of}} the Korean telecommunications market has been exposed to competitive market forces. Nonetheless, it is an unfinished agenda. The introduction of competition in the telecommunications market has mainly been limited to removing entry barriers, while <b>accompanying</b> <b>measures</b> to facilitate competition were put in place more slowly. The future tasks for policy makers include implementation of a procompetitive regulatory regime, local competition using CATV, the privatization of Korea Telecom, opening the basic telecommunications market to foreign investment, and securing regulatory expertise and independence. ...|$|R
