5|$|In {{addition}} to the Kennedy relief and eternal flame, papers and photographs relating {{to the subject of}} Israel-United States relations until the time of Kennedy's assassination <b>are</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> a small library.|$|E
5|$|The book's {{original}} woodblocks <b>are</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> the Lynd Ward Collection in the Joseph Mark Lauinger Memorial Library at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., bequeathed by Ward's daughters Nanda and Robin.|$|E
5|$|The {{inventory}} {{system of}} the game features a grid system, represented by an attaché case, that has each item take up {{a certain number of}} spaces. The case can be upgraded several times, allowing for more space. Weapons, ammunition, and healing items <b>are</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> the case, while key items and treasures <b>are</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> a separate menu. Items may be bought from and sold to a merchant that appears in various locations throughout the game. He sells first aid sprays, weapons, allows for weapons to be upgraded and buys various treasures that Leon finds. The various weapons each have their own advantages and disadvantages.|$|E
50|$|Adult Pelinobius muticus can <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> a {{converted}} aquarium and provided {{with plenty of}} ventilation and a very deep substrate (at least 25 cm deep). Spiderlings can <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> small containers such as pill tubs and waxworm tubs. Slightly larger specimens can <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> livefood tubs.|$|R
50|$|Post-war {{the station}} came under No. 273 Maintenance Unit RAF and the {{airfield}} <b>was</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> usable state until October 1948 {{when it was}} closed. RAF Polebrook <b>was</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> caretaker status until 1959.|$|R
50|$|Black neon tetras should <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> soft acidic water, {{which should}} <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> clean at all times. Their tank should contain live plants, a darker {{substrate}} and open water for swimming. Black neons should <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> groups {{of at least}} 4−6, preferably more.|$|R
5|$|The {{leaves are}} unbound and <b>are</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> loose quires. The text {{is written in}} late uncial script, in two columns per page, with mostly 19 lines per column, in large uncial letters. Palaeographically the writing {{is close to the}} Codex Seidelianus I.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} autograph parts <b>are</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> the Bach-Archiv Leipzig. They were {{copied from}} the lost autograph score by six scribes, {{four of them}} known by name, including the composer.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} levels of {{radioactive}} contamination, her papers from the 1890s are considered too dangerous to handle. Even her cookbook is highly radioactive. Her papers <b>are</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> lead-lined boxes, and {{those who wish to}} consult them must wear protective clothing. In her last year, she worked on a book, Radioactivity, which was published posthumously in 1935.|$|E
50|$|In {{order for}} plant {{specimens}} to <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> good condition for future reference, adequate storage conditions are needed. The storage space should <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> a low light, low humidity environment. The {{temperature of the}} storage space should <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> cool, between 50 - 65 degrees Fahrenheit.|$|R
60|$|It {{was not to}} {{be thought}} of. Cost what it might in present wretchedness--end how it might, if the {{deception}} was discovered in the future--Blanche must <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> ignorance of the truth, Arnold must <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> hiding until she had gone.|$|R
5|$|Newly hatched Aylesbury ducklings are timid {{and thrive}} best in small groups, so the duckers would divide them into {{groups of three}} or four ducklings, each {{accompanied}} by a hen. As the ducklings grew older and gained confidence, they would <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> groups of around 30. Originally the ducks would <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> every room in the ducker's cottage, but {{towards the end of the}} 19thcentury they <b>were</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> outdoor pens and sheds with suitable protection against cold weather.|$|R
5|$|Documentation of records, {{including}} the members' deliberations, <b>are</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> the committee’s archives, which are deposited with the British Trust for Ornithology. Some older data is missing, as the committee's files were originally {{held by the}} editors of British Birds, {{and they were not}} transferred to the new owners of the magazine when it was sold in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Manning Camp Campground is {{the main}} staging area for firefighters, trail-maintenance crews, and {{scientists}} working in the RMD. Their supplies are brought in by pack mules that <b>are</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> corrals at the site. Runoff from a nearby spring, the largest in Rincons, provides water for the livestock.|$|E
5|$|Pet birds <b>are</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> their millions, as are {{domestic}} fowls, bantams, and pigeons. These last had {{an important}} effect on evolutionary biology, as Charles Darwin took an especial interest in pigeon fancying, adopted the hobby himself, and made use of the wide variation between breeds as an argument for the power of selection in his 1859 Origin of Species.|$|E
50|$|One, Michael Metrinko, <b>was</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> solitary {{confinement}} for months. On two occasions, when he expressed {{his opinion of}} Ayatollah Khomeini, he was punished severely. The first time, he <b>was</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> handcuffs for two weeks, and the second time, he <b>was</b> beaten and <b>kept</b> alone <b>in</b> a freezing cell for two weeks.|$|R

5|$|Several diseases, like Rat Coronavirus Infection (RCI), Sendai virus, and Murine Respiratory Mycoplasmosis (MRM, Mycoplasma pulmonis), are {{prevalent}} {{simply because}} their highly contagious natures work {{in tandem with}} the way rats <b>are</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> laboratories, pet stores, and by breeders. It should be noted, however, that MRM is far less likely to occur in laboratory rats than in those kept as pets.|$|E
5|$|Teleosts are {{economically}} {{important to}} humans, as {{is shown by}} their depiction in art over the centuries. The fishing industry harvests them for food, and anglers attempt to capture them for sport. Some species are farmed commercially, and this method of production {{is likely to be}} increasingly important in the future. Others <b>are</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> aquariums or used in research, especially in the fields of genetics and developmental biology.|$|E
5|$|A {{particular}} critical {{success was}} The Year of the Sex Olympics, broadcast {{as part of}} BBC2's Theatre 625 series in July 1968. Kneale's first television work {{to be made in}} colour—although only a black-and-white copy now survives—the story was based in a future where {{the majority of the population}} <b>are</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> a docile state by constant broadcasts of pornography and other low-brow reality television programming. The Live Life Show, in which a family are watched twenty-four hours a day as they struggle to live on an isolated rural island, becomes a massive success, especially when a murderer is introduced into the set-up.|$|E
50|$|The yellowback puller is {{suitable}} to <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> a reef aquarium {{where it can}} be fed on brine shrimps and mysid shrimps. Being a shoaling fish, it should <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> a small group, and being non-aggressive, it mixes well with other species of fish.|$|R

5|$|As {{in other}} ruminants, the infant can stand within 30 minutes of birth. Although {{generally}} similar to adults, newborn calves have false eyelashes, a long dorsal mane and long white hairs in the stripes. These features gradually disappear and {{give way to}} the general appearance within a year. The juveniles <b>are</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> hiding, and nursing takes place infrequently. The growth rate of calves is appreciably high in {{the first few months of}} birth, after which it gradually declines. Juveniles start taking solid food from three months, and weaning takes place at six months. Horn development in males takes one year after birth. The okapi's average lifespan is 20 to 30 years.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} trade, infants {{are pulled}} prematurely from their parents, leaving them unable to remove their own urine, feces, and oily skin {{secretions}} from their fur. Slow lorises have a special network of blood vessels in their hands and feet, which makes them vulnerable to cuts when pulled from the wire cages they <b>are</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in.</b> Slow lorises are also stress-sensitive and do not do well in captivity. Common health problems seen in pet slow lorises include undernourishment, tooth decay, diabetes, obesity, and kidney failure. Infection, stress, pneumonia, and poor nutrition lead to high death rates among pet lorises. Pet owners also fail to provide proper care because they are usually asleep when the nocturnal pet is awake.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in six movements. The {{text and}} tune of the hymn <b>are</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> the outer choral movements, a chorale fantasia and a four-part closing chorale, which frame {{a sequence of}} alternating recitatives and arias. Bach scored the work for three vocal soloists (soprano (S), tenor (T) and bass (B)), a four-part choir, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of two horns (Co), two oboes da caccia (Oc), two violins (Vl), two obbligato violins (Vs), viola (Va) and basso continuo. A festive scoring like this, including brass, was usually performed on holidays. The duration of the cantata is given as 25 minutes.|$|E

5|$|Byte {{magazine}} {{published an}} assembly language version of Spacewar in 1977 that {{ran on the}} Altair 8800 and other Intel 8080-based microcomputers using an oscilloscope as the graphical display and a lookup table for orbits, {{as well as a}} three-dimensional variant in 1979 written in Tiny BASIC. More modern recreations of the game for computers have been made as well. An emulated version of the original game, based on the original source code made publicly available by Martin Graetz and running in a JavaScript PDP-1 emulator, was made available to play on the internet in 2012. The only working PDP-1s that are known to exist <b>are</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California, where demonstrations of the machine are held, which include playing Spacewar.|$|E
5|$|Conservation of cacti {{can be in}} situ or ex situ. In situ {{conservation}} involves preserving habits through {{enforcement of}} legal protection {{and the creation of}} specially protected areas such as national parks and reserves. Examples of such protected areas in the United States include Big Bend National Park, Texas; Joshua Tree National Park, California; and Saguaro National Park, Arizona. Latin American examples include Parque Nacional del Pinacate, Sonora, Mexico and Pan de Azúcar National Park, Chile. Ex situ conservation aims to preserve plants and seeds outside their natural habitats, often with the intention of later reintroduction. Botanical gardens {{play an important role in}} ex situ conservation; for example, seeds of cacti and other succulents <b>are</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> long-term storage at the Desert Botanical Garden, Arizona.|$|E
5|$|Flocks in Australia {{have always}} been largely range bands on fenced land, and are aimed at {{production}} of medium to superfine wool for clothing and other products as well as meat. New Zealand flocks <b>are</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> a fashion similar to English ones, in fenced holdings without shepherds. Although wool was once the primary income source for New Zealand sheep owners (especially during the New Zealand wool boom), today it has shifted to meat production for export.|$|E
