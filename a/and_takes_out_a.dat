500|$|Soon after sobering up, Stewie {{stretches}} <b>and</b> <b>takes</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> Jenny Craig Anytime Bar {{from his}} shopping bag. [...] Brian loses his temper with Stewie for not revealing {{that he had}} been storing food the entire time, and Stewie punishes him by only offering one of the Bars he doesn't want to eat himself (though Brian is happy to have it). After Brian calms down, Stewie asks Brian why he has a gun, noting that Brian is a staunch gun control proponent and seems like the last person who would ever have a gun. Brian doesn't {{want to talk about it}} at first, but eventually admits to Stewie's shock and disbelief that he has the gun in case he ever feels he has to commit suicide. Brian confesses that he cannot find his purpose in life, and finds comfort in knowing he has the option of killing himself. He admits that the Scotch was to be a last drink. Stewie then admits that he would be lost without Brian, claiming he is the only person in the world that he really cares about; he tells a skeptical Brian that his earlier ranting against Brian was only an attack because Brian verball attacked him, and he finally tells Brian he loves him. Brian tells Stewie he loves him back. In addition, Stewie reminds Brian that maybe making someone else happy is enough, because it is the best gift one person can give, for which Brian thanks him. Stewie falls asleep as Brian reads the beginning of David Copperfield to him. The following morning, the vault door opens, and Brian carries a sleeping Stewie and their belongings out of the room in silence. The episode plays the closing credits without music as well.|$|E
2500|$|... "On {{one side}} of a table stands a grave-looking elderly gentleman with the ballot-box before him; on the other side sits a second still more grave, with an open book; in the book is written, each several number, on the margin, and {{opposite}} the number the name of the juror thereby denoted. The first grave gentleman shakes the box, puts in his hand, <b>and</b> <b>takes</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> card, from which he reads the number—then the other grave gentleman turns to that number in the book, and pronounces the name of the juror so numbered, whose name and address are then taken down as one of the forty-eight; and this process is repeated forty-eight times... it is said—I say nothing, but it is said—that those two gentlemen know each juror just as well by his number as by his name: and so, when the first takes out a card and finds 253, for example, written on it—if he knows that 253 would vote for the people, and against the Crown, it is said he gives out (as solemn as he looks), not 253, but, say, 255, or some loyal number; and thus a safe man is put on the list. Or, if anyone is standing by, and has an opportunity of seeing the card, he cries 253, and winks, or otherwise telegraphs to this other grave gentleman. Then the onus is upon the man with the book, who has nothing to do but call out a loyal man for the disloyal number, and so you have safe voters still. They never make the mistake, these elderly gentlemen, of turning out the whole forty-eight all of the right sort there is no need: there is a margin to the extent of twelve: and so they generally leave about nine or ten dubious names amongst the forty-eight. The Crown has afterwards the right to strike off twelve peremptorily, without reason assigned, and always gets rid of the men who would vote for the people.|$|E

(Brudenell nods also, and withdraws a little, {{watching}} her sympathetically. Burgoyne resumes his former position, <b>and</b> <b>takes</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> handsome gold chronometer.) Now then, are those preparations made? We must not detain Mr. Dudgeon.|$|E
60|$|No, don't trouble. The poor chap's {{just turned}} in, {{dropping}} with sleep. I {{told him he}} might till I called him. I don't want much, and I can easily get it myself.

60|$|So {{the doctor}} opens his little bag, <b>and</b> <b>takes</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> square sealed packet first; then {{two or three}} letters tied together; the poor soul looking all the while as if he longed to prevent us from {{touching}} them. Well, the doctor {{said there was no}} occasion to open the packet, for the direction was the same on all the letters, and the name corresponded with his initials marked on his linen.|$|E

Anderson grabs the belt and buckles it on, saying) If they took him for me in my coat, perhaps they'll take me for him in his. (Hitching the belt into its place) Do I look like him? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After it {{was over}} the revenue chaps lit a lot of {{lanterns}} and then made a big fire, and by its light my mate could see pretty well what was going on. They had got about twenty prisoners. Most of the country people and carts had, luckily enough for them, gone off with their loads a few minutes afore the revenue men came up. A dozen pack-horses and three or four carts had been took, and, in course, all the loads the men were carrying up. Among those who was took was Mr. Julian. He was standing close to me when they came up, and I expect he was collared immediate. Faulkner, {{he sat down on}} a tub {{by the side of the}} fire <b>and</b> <b>takes</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> book, and the prisoners was brought up one by one and questions asked them. Mr. Julian was one of the last. Faulkner got up from his seat and rowed him tremendous. What he said my mate could not catch, but he could hear his voice, and he was going on at him cruel; then I suppose Mr. Julian lost his temper, and my mate says he could see that he was giving it him back hot. I expect it was something wonderful hard and nasty he said, for Faulkner jumped at him and hit him in the face. Then your brother threw himself on him. My mate says he would have thrown him backwards into the fire, if some of the revenue men had not seized him and dragged him off.|$|E
60|$|The father hesitated. Then {{he opened}} <b>a</b> drawer <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> blurred <b>and</b> {{under-developed}} photograph. 'Come {{and look at}} this,' he said.|$|R

60|$|There {{were other}} papers rolled up, and I {{asked him what}} they were. 'Why, ay,' says he, 'that's the {{question}} I wanted to have you ask me'; so he unrolls them <b>and</b> <b>takes</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> little shagreen case, and gives {{me out of it}} a very fine diamond ring. I could not refuse it, if I had a mind to do so, for he put it upon my finger; so I made him a curtsy and accepted it. Then he takes out another ring: 'And this,' says he, 'is for another occasion,' so he puts that in his pocket. 'Well, but let me see it, though,' says I, and smiled; 'I guess what it is; I think you are mad.' 'I should have been mad if I had done less,' says he, and still he did not show me, and I had a great mind to see it; so I says, 'Well, but let me see it.' 'Hold,' says he, 'first look here'; then he took up the roll again and read it, and behold! it was a licence for us to be married. 'Why,' says I, 'are you distracted? Why, you were fully satisfied that I would comply and yield at first word, or resolved to take no denial.' 'The last is certainly the case,' said he. 'But you may be mistaken,' said I. 'No, no,' says he, 'how can you think so? I must not be denied, I can't be denied'; and with that he fell to kissing me so violently, I could not get rid of him.|$|E
6000|$|How can I, tho' {{her face}} and form are painted on my memory, tell you what fair, pert Miss Dorothy was at that time'! Ay, I know what you would say: that Sir Joshua's {{portrait}} hangs above, executed but the year after, and hung at the second exhibition of the Royal Academy. As I look upon it now, I say that no whit of its colour is overcharged. And there is likewise Mr. Peale's portrait, done much later. I answer that these great masters have accomplished what poor, human art can do. But Nature hath given us a better picture. [...] "Come hither, Bess! Yes, truly, you have Dolly's hair, with the very gloss upon it. But fashions have changed, my child, {{and that is not}} as Dolly wore it." [...] Whereupon Bess goes to the portrait, and presently comes back to give me a start. And then we go hand in hand up the stairs of Calvert House even to the garret, where an old cedar chest is laid away under the eaves. Bess, the minx, well knows it, <b>and</b> <b>takes</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> prim little gown with the white fading yellow, and white silk mits without fingers, and white stockings with clocks, and a gauze cap, with wings and streamers, that sits saucily on the black locks; and the lawn-embroidered apron; and such dainty, high-heeled slippers with the pearls still a-glisten upon the buckles. Away she flies to put them on. And then my heart gives a leap to see my Dorothy back again,--back again as she was that June afternoon we went together to my last birthday party, her girlish arms bare to the elbow, and the lace about her slender throat. Yes, Bess hath the very tilt of her chin, the regal grace of that slim figure, and the deep blue eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... [There is a {{long pause}} during which they are lurking in the shadows. At last they hear some movement, and they steal like ghosts from the room. We see DAVID turning out the lobby light; then the door closes and an empty room awaits the {{intruder}} with a shudder of expectancy. The window opens and shuts as softly {{as if this were}} a mother peering in to see whether her baby is asleep. Then the head of a man shows between the curtains. The remainder of him follows. He is carrying a little carpet bag. He stands irresolute; what puzzles him evidently is that the Wylies should have retired to rest without lifting that piece of coal off the fire. He opens the door and peeps into the lobby, listening to the wag-at-the-wall clock. All seems serene, and he turns on the light. We see him clearly now. He is JOHN SHAND, age twenty-one, boots muddy, as an indignant carpet can testify. He wears a shabby topcoat and a cockerty bonnet; otherwise he is in the well- worn corduroys of a railway porter. His movements, at first stealthy, become almost homely as he feels that he is secure. He opens the bag <b>and</b> <b>takes</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> bunch of keys, a small paper parcel, and a black implement that may be a burglar's jemmy. This cool customer examines the fire and piles on more coals. With the keys he opens the door of the bookcase, selects two large volumes, and brings them to the table. He takes off his topcoat and opens his parcel, which we now see contains sheets of foolscap paper. His next action shows that the 'jemmy' is really a ruler. He knows where the pen and ink are kept. He pulls the fine chair nearer to the table, sits on it, and proceeds to write, occasionally dotting the carpet with ink as he stabs the air with his pen. He is so occupied that he does not see the door opening, and the Wylie family staring at him. They are armed with sticks.] ...|$|E
