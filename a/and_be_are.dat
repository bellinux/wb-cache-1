40|$|Does mental {{representation}} of the immediate past contain anticipatory projec-tions of the future? In cases of representational momentum (RM), the last remem-bered location of a moving object is displaced farther along its path of motion. In boundary extension (BE), the remembered view of a scene expands to include a region just outside {{the boundaries of the}} original view. Both are “errors”, yet they make remarkably good predictions about the real world. The factors affecting these phenomena, the boundary conditions for their occurrence, and their gener-ality to non-visual senses (audition or haptics) are reviewed to determine if RM <b>and</b> <b>BE</b> <b>are</b> fundamentally related. In contrast to Hubbard’s (1995 b) suggestion that they may share a common underlying mechanism, it is proposed instead that RM <b>and</b> <b>BE</b> <b>are</b> related in a more general sense and may be different instantiations of the dynamic nature of mental representation. A powerful means of exploring the nature of mental representation is to study the errors that perceivers share in common; representational momentum (RM) and boundary extension (BE) are two such errors and provide opportunities for understanding the mental {{representation of}} events that unfold over time. What is particularly interesting about these phenomena is that although in one sense they are errors (i. e., they differ from the physical stimulus), in another sense they provide remarkably accurate predictions about characteristics of the world that have not yet been perceived. In the case of RM, when a moving object vanishes, within moments, observ-ers misreport its last seen position as being farther along the path of motion than it actually was (Finke & Freyd, 1985; Freyd & Finke, 1984).

The effect of temperature on the corrosion behavior of CS was studied {{in the range of}} 20 – 40  °C.

30|$|Samples {{were grown}} on Au film-coated Si (111) {{substrates}} in a Varian Modular GEN-II MBE system. Before using an e-gun to deposit thickness-varied Au film (0.6, 1, 1.5, and 2.0  nm), the silicon native oxide on the Si (111) substrate is removed by 1  wt% HF then rinsed with DI water and dried with N 2 gas. In this work, all MBE system sources for growing nanowires are solid elements (including Ga, Be, Si, and As) and their flux is controlled using a temperature controller and shutter under 1 [*]×[*] 10 − 10  Torr. Au film is annealed to form nanoparticles on the Si (111) substrate then Ga and As are provided to grow GaAs nanowires. For in situ Si- and Be-doped GaAs nanowires, {{the concentrations of}} Si <b>and</b> <b>Be</b> <b>are</b> tuned by controlling the solid elements temperature. Doping temperatures of Si <b>and</b> <b>Be</b> <b>are</b> 1250 ~ 1400  °C and 1000 ~ 1150  °C, respectively. The corresponding concentrations and carrier species of Si- and Be-doped GaAs samples are calibrated by Hall measurement to confirm. To prepare samples for Hall measurement, (111) Si substrate without Au film is used to deposit GaAs films with different dopant source temperatures. SEM images were obtained using a HITACHI-S 4700 field-emission SEM, operated at 5 – 15  kV accelerating voltage. The TEM samples were prepared by drop-casting nanostructures from toluene dilute dispersions onto 200 -mesh carbon-coated copper grids (Electron Microscope Sciences). Energy dispersive spectrometry was conducted using a 200 -kV accelerating voltage on a JEOL JEM- 2100 F. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed with a Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ[*]=[*] 1.54  Å) with of 1 °/min scan rate. A cathodoluminescence (CL) detector was attached to SEM, and Raman spectrum was measured through Horiba, HR 800 by 633  nm laser and electrical properties measured by Keithly- 590 for I-V curves.|$|E

With no loss of biodegradability and biocompatibility, we highly toughened PLA using a novel bioelastomer (BE) –synthesized from biomass diols and diacids. Although PLA <b>and</b> <b>BE</b> <b>are</b> immiscible, BE particles of ∼ 1 μm in diameter are uniformly dispersed in the matrix, and this indicates some compatibility between PLA and BE. BE significantly increased the cold crystallization ability of PLA, which was valuable for practical processing and performance.

At 11. 5 vol%, notched Izod impact strength improved from 2. 4 to 10. 3 kJ/m 2, 330 % increment; the increase is superior to previous toughening effect by using petroleum-based tougheners.
