5|$|Not {{everything}} {{contained in}} the New Testament gospels {{is considered to be}} historically reliable. Views range from their being inerrant descriptions of the life of Jesus to their providing little historical information about his life beyond the basics. According to a broad scholarly consensus, the Synoptic Gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke), and not John, are the most reliable sources of information <b>about</b> <b>Jesus.</b>|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from his}} own disciples and followers, the Jews of Jesus' day {{generally}} rejected him as the Messiah, as do {{the great majority of}} Jews today. Christian theologians, ecumenical councils, reformers and others have written extensively <b>about</b> <b>Jesus</b> over the centuries. Christian sects and schisms have often been defined or characterized by their descriptions of Jesus. Meanwhile, Manichaeans, Gnostics, Muslims, Baha'is, and others have found prominent places for Jesus in their religions. Jesus has also had detractors, both past and present.|$|E

In the second part, genealogies of New Testament with Jewish view in frame of prophets? quotes are compared, related to Messiah, including separated rabbinic tract Toledot Yeshu. The third part tells <b>about</b> <b>Jesus's</b> teachings, especially <b>about</b> his attitude to Torah, and <b>about</b> <b>Jesus's</b> miracles...|$|R

5|$|Jesus is {{the central}} figure of Christianity. Although Christian views of Jesus vary, it is {{possible}} to summarize the key beliefs shared among major denominations, as stated in their catechetical or confessional texts. Christian views of Jesus are derived from various sources, including the canonical gospels and New Testament letters such as the Pauline epistles and the Johannine writings. These documents outline the key beliefs held by Christians <b>about</b> <b>Jesus,</b> including his divinity, humanity, and earthly life, and that he is the Christ and the Son of God. Despite their many shared beliefs, not all Christian denominations agree on all doctrines, and both major and minor differences on teachings and beliefs have persisted throughout Christianity for centuries.|$|E
5|$|King {{told the}} International Congress of Coptic Studies {{that the text}} does not prove that Jesus had a wife. She noted that even as a {{translation}} of a 2nd-century AD Greek text, it would still have been written more than 100 years {{after the death of}} Jesus. According to King, the earliest and most reliable information <b>about</b> <b>Jesus</b> is silent on the question of his marital status. King also said that the text (which she suggested is a fragment from a non-canonical gospel) showed that some early Christians believed that Jesus was married. A Harvard News Office article reported that King dated the speculative Greek original to {{the second half of the}} second century because it shows close connections to other newly discovered gospels written at that time, particularly the Gospel of Thomas, the Gospel of Mary, and the Gospel of Philip.|$|E

In Strauss's [...] "Life of Jesus", he disagreed with the previous ideas that historical Jesus can be easily reconstructed in conjunction with New Testament Manuscripts. Strauss pointed out that Christian tradition is fundamentally mythical, and that while he did not claim that there are no historical facts in the sources, there is too little evidence to reconstruct the historical image of Jesus to serve the Christian faith. Raising critical questions <b>about</b> <b>Jesus's</b> historical image made Strauss an important figure in the field of theology.|$|R

25|$|In 1263 at the Disputation of Barcelona, Nahmanides {{expressed}} the Jewish viewpoint of Isaiah 53 {{and other matters}} regarding Christian belief <b>about</b> <b>Jesus's</b> role in Hebrew Scripture.

Passages of Talmud were also censored. In a number of other disputations, debate about this passage resulted in forced conversions, deportations, and the burning of Jewish religious texts.|$|R
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to the canonical gospels, which paint Judas as a betrayer who delivered Jesus to the authorities for crucifixion in exchange for money, the Gospel of Judas portrays Judas's actions as done in obedience to instructions {{given to him by}} Christ. It does not claim that the other disciples knew <b>about</b> <b>Jesus's</b> true teachings. On the contrary, it asserts that they had not learned the true Gospel, which Jesus taught only to Judas Iscariot, the sole follower belonging to the [...] "holy generation" [...] among the disciples.|$|R
5000|$|Pope Francis {{said that}} the most {{powerful}} message of Jesus Christ is mercy. His motto, Miserando atque eligendo, is <b>about</b> <b>Jesus's</b> mercy towards sinners. The phrase is taken from a homily of Saint Bede, who commented that Jesus [...] "saw the tax collector and, because he saw him {{through the eyes of}} mercy and chose him, he said to him: 'Follow me. The motto is a reference to the moment when he found his vocation to the priesthood, at the age of 17. He started a day of student celebrations by going to confession.|$|R

This event is {{not found in the}} Gospels, but is probably based on an ancient Catholic tradition (not official teaching) that he appeared to her first of all people. The tradition influenced Ignatius of Loyola's Spiritual Exercises among others. The film closes with Mary suggesting the disciples should start preaching about her son.|$|R

25|$|The seven undisputed Pauline epistles {{considered}} by scholarly consensus to be genuine epistles are generally dated to 50–60 AD (i.e. approximately twenty to {{thirty years after}} the generally accepted time period {{for the death of}} Jesus around 30–36 AD) and are the earliest surviving Christian texts that may include information <b>about</b> <b>Jesus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Myth proponents claim {{there is}} {{significance}} in the lack of surviving historic records <b>about</b> <b>Jesus</b> of Nazareth from any non-Jewish author until the second century, adding that Jesus left no writings or other archaeological evidence.

25|$|Of the two passages, the James {{passage in}} Book 20 {{is used by}} {{scholars}} to support the existence of Jesus, the Testimonium Flavianum in Book 18 his crucifixion.

25|$|Although the {{question}} of the equivalence of the identities of Yeshu and Jesus has at times been debated, many historians agree that the above 2nd-century passage is likely to be <b>about</b> <b>Jesus,</b> Peter Schäfer stating {{that there can be no}} doubt that this narrative of the execution in the Talmud refers to Jesus of Nazareth. Robert Van Voorst states that the Sanhedrin 43a reference to Jesus can be confirmed not only from the reference itself, but from the context that surrounds it.|$|E
25|$|James Crossley, however, {{has argued}} that the film makes the {{distinction}} between Jesus and the character of Brian to make a contrast between the traditional Christ of both faith and cinema and the historical figure of Jesus in critical scholarship and how critical scholars have argued that ideas later got attributed to Jesus by his followers. Crossley points out that the film uses a number of potentially controversial scholarly theories <b>about</b> <b>Jesus</b> but now with reference to Brian, such as the Messianic Secret, the Jewishness of Jesus, Jesus the revolutionary, and having a single mother.|$|E
