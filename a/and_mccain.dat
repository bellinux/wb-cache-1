5|$|All five {{senators}} served {{out their}} terms. Only Glenn <b>and</b> <b>McCain</b> ran for re-election, {{and they both}} retained their seats.

5|$|Bush portrayed {{himself as}} a {{compassionate}} conservative, implying he was more centrist than other Republicans. He campaigned on a platform that included bringing integrity and honor back to the White House, increasing {{the size of the}} United States Armed Forces, cutting taxes, improving education, and aiding minorities. By early 2000, the race had centered on Bush <b>and</b> <b>McCain.</b>|$|E

5|$|Initially the {{committee}} investigated in private. On September 10, 1990, Bennett submitted a confidential report, which soon leaked, that recommended that {{the committee}} continue its investigation of Cranston, DeConcini, and Riegle, but take no action against Glenn <b>and</b> <b>McCain,</b> as there was insufficient evidence to pursue the latter two. Bennett also recommended that public hearings be held.|$|E
5|$|Speculation {{that this}} would be the {{decision}} had already taken place, and both Glenn <b>and</b> <b>McCain</b> were frustrated that the long delay in resolving their cases was damaging their reputations. However, there were political implications, as the removal of the two would eliminate the only Republican from the case. The committee's work was further made difficult by there being no specific rule that governed the propriety of members intervening with federal regulators. By mid-October, several Republican senators, including former Ethics Committee chair Ted Stevens, were taking the unusual step of publicly complaining about the Ethics Committee's inaction, saying that it was unfair to Glenn <b>and</b> <b>McCain,</b> that the whole lengthy process was unfair to all five, and that political motives might be behind the delays. Eventually, the committee could not agree on the Bennett recommendation regarding Glenn and McCain: vice chair Rudman agreed with Bennett, chair Heflin did not. On October 23, 1990, the committee decided to keep all five senators in the case, and scheduled public hearings to question them and other witnesses.|$|E
5|$|After 1999, {{the only}} member of the Keating Five {{remaining}} in the U.S. Senate was John McCain, who had an easier time gaining re-election in 1992 than he anticipated. He survived the political scandal in part by becoming friendly with the political press. McCain subsequently ran for president in 2000 and became the Republican presidential nominee in 2008. During the 2000s, several retrospective accounts of the controversy reiterated the contention that McCain was included in the investigation primarily so that there would be at least one Republican target. Glenn's inclusion in the investigation has been attributed to Republicans who were angered by the inclusion of McCain, as well as committee members who thought that dropping Glenn (<b>and</b> <b>McCain)</b> would make it look bad for the remaining three Democratic Senators.|$|E

5|$|McCain and Keating {{had become}} {{personal}} friends following their initial contacts in 1981, <b>and</b> <b>McCain</b> {{was the only}} one of the five with close social and personal ties to Keating. Like DeConcini, McCain considered Keating a constituent since Keating lived in Arizona. Between 1982 and 1987, McCain had received $112,000 in political contributions from Keating and his associates. In addition, McCain's wife Cindy McCain and her father Jim Hensley had invested $359,100 in the Fountain Square Project, a Keating shopping center, in April 1986, a year before McCain met with the regulators. McCain, his family, and their baby-sitter had made nine trips at Keating's expense, sometimes aboard Keating's jet; three of the trips were made during vacations to Keating's Bahamas retreat at Cat Cay. McCain did not pay Keating (in the amount of $13,433) for some of the trips until years after they were taken, when he learned that Keating was in trouble over Lincoln.|$|E
