5|$|There {{continued}} to be rebellions and resistance to William's rule, but Hastings effectively marked the culmination of William's conquest of England.

5|$|Between 1934 and 1963, {{the four}} wardens of Alcatraz resided here, {{including}} the first warden, James A. Johnston. A house of luxury, {{in stark contrast to}} the jail next to it, the wardens often held lavish cocktail parties here. The signpost <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> shows a photograph of a trusted inmate doing chores at the house for the warden and that the house had a terraced garden and greenhouse. The mansion had tall windows, providing fine views of San Francisco Bay. Today, the house is a ruin, burned down by Native Americans during the Occupation of Alcatraz on June 1, 1970.|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} was discovered at about 00:30 on June 3, and Zur's force lost {{the element of}} surprise. The Egyptian position that engaged the Israelis had two companies, but Harpaz, the 51st's 3rd Company's commander, underestimated the force and reported that it contained only one platoon. Zur decided to regroup in the wadi and ordered Aryeh Kotzer's 1st Company to stay and engage the Egyptians <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> where they were originally discovered and assault the pillbox there, {{while the rest of}} the forces would try a turning movement.|$|E
5|$|Cincinnati's offense {{took over}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> of the {{interception}} and immediately began {{moving down the}} field. Pike completed three consecutive passes: a five-yard pass to Gilyard, a 10-yard throw to Goodman, then a 31-yard toss to Gilyard. After the long throw, Cincinnati had a first down at the Virginia Tech 26-yard line. The Bearcats continued their drive after an incomplete pass by Pike with an 18-yard completion to Goebel that gave the Bearcats a first down at the Virginia Tech eight-yard line. Two plays later, however, Cincinnati's drive {{came to an end}} when Virginia Tech defender Stephan Virgil intercepted a pass from Pike to a player in the end zone, denying the Bearcats a chance to score. Virgil was downed in the end zone for a touchback, and Virginia Tech's offense started at its 20-yard line after the turnover.|$|E

5|$|In 1901, trader Ebenezer Barnette sailed up Alaska's Tanana River {{in hopes}} of {{establishing}} a trading post on the trail connecting the coastal town of Valdez with the gold-mining community of Eagle. Due to low water, however, the steamboat Barnette chartered was unable to continue up the river. Discouraged, Barnette deposited his cache of goods on a riverbank of the Chena River and sailed downstream {{with the intent of}} making another attempt to sail up the river during the following year. In 1902, miner Felix Pedro struck gold at a spot about 15 miles north of the spot where Barnette left his supplies. Seeing an opportunity, Barnette decided to establish a trading post <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>spot.</b> Other miners and suppliers arrived, attracted by the gold, and Barnette named the settlement Fairbanks, after Indiana Senator and later Vice President of the United States Charles W. Fairbanks.|$|E
5|$|The Danger Tree {{had been}} part of a clump of trees located about halfway into No Man's Land and had {{originally}} been used as a landmark by a Newfoundland Regiment trench raiding party {{in the days before the}} Battle of the Somme. British and German artillery bombardments eventually stripped the tree of leaves and left nothing more than a shattered tree trunk. During the Newfoundland Regiment's infantry assault, the tree was once again used as a landmark, where the troops were ordered to gather. The tree was however a highly visible landmark for the German artillery and the site proved to be a location where the German shrapnel was particularly deadly. As a result, the regiment suffered a large concentration of casualties around the tree. A replica representation of the twisted tree now stands <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>spot.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{three types}} of {{scrimmage}} kicks are place kicks, drop kicks, and punts. Only place kicks and drop kicks can score points. The place kick is the standard method used to score points, because the pointy shape of the football {{makes it difficult to}} reliably drop kick. Once the ball has been kicked from a scrimmage kick, it can be advanced by the kicking team only if it is caught or recovered behind the line of scrimmage. If it is touched or recovered by the kicking team beyond this line, it becomes dead <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> where it was touched. The kicking team is prohibited from interfering with the receiver's opportunity to catch the ball, and the receiving team has the option of signaling for a fair catch. This prohibits the defense from blocking into or tackling the receiver, but the play ends as soon as the ball is caught and the ball may not be advanced.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, Oslo had two stations, {{the larger}} Oslo East Station (or OsloØ, located <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> {{of the current}} OsloS) and Oslo West Station (OsloV), which served the Drammen Line. This caused a {{physical}} barrier between the {{two parts of the}} railway network, only connected by the Oslo Port Line which ran partly in city streets. Formal planning of a central station and a tunnel connecting the Drammen Line to OsloØ started in 1938, and the final plans were approved in 1968. The Oslo Tunnel opened on 1 June 1980, and made it possible to close OsloV in 1989. Nationaltheatret saw a major upgrade in 1999, when it was expanded to four tracks, and from 2008 to 2010, the tunnel will see a major technical upgrade. There are plans to build a second tunnel to increase train capacity west of Oslo.|$|E
5|$|Wilfrid's feast day is 12 October or 24 April. Both dates were {{celebrated in}} early medieval England, but the April date {{appeared}} {{first in the}} liturgical calendars. The April date is the date when his relics were translated to a new shrine. Immediately after his death Wilfrid's body was venerated as a cult object, and miracles were alleged to have happened <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> where the water used to wash his body was discarded. A cult grew up at Ripon after his death and remained active until 948, when King Eadred destroyed the church at Ripon; after the destruction, Wilfrid's relics were taken by Archbishop Oda of Canterbury, and held in Canterbury Cathedral. This account appears in a foreword written by Oda for Frithegod's later poem on Wilfrid's life. However, according to Byrhtferth's Vita Sancti Oswaldi, or Life of Saint Oswald, Oda's nephew, Oswald, Archbishop of York, preserved the relics at Ripon and restored the community there to care for them. The two differing accounts are not easily reconciled, {{but it is possible}} that Oswald collected secondary relics that had been overlooked by his uncle and installed those at Ripon. The relics that were held at Canterbury were originally placed in the High Altar in 948, but after the fire at Canterbury Cathedral in 1067, Wilfrid's relics were placed in their own shrine.|$|E
