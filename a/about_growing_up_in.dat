The song is <b>about</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> Compton, California, and describes the gangster lifestyle.

500|$|In author Ian MacDonald's estimation, [...] "Only a Northern Song" [...] {{suggests}} that Harrison [...] "had yet to recover {{his enthusiasm for}} being a Beatle" [...] after he had threatened to leave the group following their final concert tour, in August 1966. Before the band regrouped in November that year to begin recording their album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Harrison spent six weeks in India with his sitar teacher, Ravi Shankar, a visit that heightened his disinterest in the Beatles' project. MacDonald considers that Harrison's link with northern England in [...] "Only a Northern Song" [...] {{was influenced by the}} Beatles working on songs <b>about</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> Liverpool, which was the concept under consideration {{at the start of the}} Sgt. Pepper sessions.|$|E
500|$|... "Movin' Down the Line", an ode to a love unrequited, {{features}} mellow horns, jangling guitar, heavy bass lines, and a swelling {{string and}} piano conclusion. In {{the opinion of}} Lloyd Bradley, the song exemplifies the album's combination of traditional styles and contemporary production: [...] "It has every bit of digital snap needed to succeed among today’s sounds; but Saadiq's masterful use of a big brass section lurking w-a-a-ay into the background picks the tune up and puts it down {{in a completely different}} era. The song turns out both laidback and urgent at the same time, and is utterly irrepressible for it". Containing a psychedelic funk sound, [...] "Just Don't" [...] is sung {{from the point of view}} of a dejected narrator as realizes his woman has moved on from him. The song features guest vocals by Yukimi Nagano and an extended Moog solo played [...] by Larry Dunn. [...] "Good Man" [...] contains plaintive lyrics, a hook co-written and sung by vocalist Taura Stinson, and lyrics about a man mourning his partner's unfaithfulness. The album's closing track, [...] "The Answer", features a wistful, jazz-funk sound, and lyrics expressing a call for collective and individual responsibility. Saadiq said, [...] "I always have a song similar to that on my albums. I was just thinking <b>about</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> Oakland and all the older people and mentors who helped me out at the time. So I just wanted to throw it back and say thank you, and tell all the kids out there to listen to the people trying to guide them".|$|E

2500|$|... "Colored {{people lived}} in three neighborhoods that were clearly demarcated, as if by ropes or turnstiles," [...] wrote Harvard {{professor}} Henry Louis Gates, Jr. <b>about</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> segregated West Virginia in the 1960s. [...] "Welcome to the Colored Zone, a large stretched banner could have said.... Of course, the colored world {{was not so much}} a neighborhood as a condition of existence." [...] "For most of my childhood, we couldn't eat in restaurants or sleep in hotels, we couldn't use certain bathrooms or try on clothes in stores," [...] recalls Gates. His mother retaliated by not buying clothes that she was not allowed to try on. He remembered hearing a white man deliberately calling his father by the wrong name: [...] "'He knows my name, boy,' my father said after a long pause. 'He calls all colored people George.'" [...] When Gates's cousin became the first black cheerleader at the local high school, she was not allowed to sit with the team and drink Coke from a glass but had to stand at the counter drinking from a paper cup. Professor Gates also wrote about his experiences in his 1995 book, Colored People: A Memoir.|$|E
