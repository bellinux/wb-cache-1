50|$|The academy as a {{whole is}} caught unawares; but Khemri is doing extras drills (due to his demerits) with Mekbi Troopers - the {{principal}} and pseudo-autonomous ground forces of the Empire. Though he and all his Mekbi troops are killed, they successfully repel the Sad-Eye incursion, earning him several medals. The Commandant, however, who hated him, becomes mentally unstable after this, and attempts to kill Khemri for resembling one of the academy's best cadets, Atalin. Khemri survives and manages to kill the Commandant; the Imperial Mind, meanwhile, hushes this up, and reports that the Commandant was killed in action against the Sad-Eyes; despite this, it becomes clear to Jerrazis that Khemri killed him; as a result, when his first year at the academy is over (and he is eligible for duels), the Imperial Mind immediately transfers him to a supply station far away from the Empire. Though initially dreading the job, Khemri then finds that the 'supply station' is in fact just a cover for the <b>Adjustment</b> <b>service,</b> the secret service of the Empire. He is then given a choice; either he can go through the test to become an Adjuster, or he can remain at the supply station, in which case he will be immediately assassinated by House Jerrazis. He chooses the test, and is given 4 months of training in 4 different artificial environments- but in a body that doesn't possess his augmented features.|$|E

R. China studying in Malaysia. The numerical data was obtained through the CASS questionnaire survey, which was conducted from June 2013 to July 2013 at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (Johor) and Sunway University (Selangor). As the research instrument of this study, the CASS questionnaire was a modification from Samarasekera (2013), Reynolds (2010), and Danjuma’s (2012) works, and all the questions were set into the fifth-point Likert-scale format. The questionnaire was distributed to 63 China students in UTM and 54 China students in SU. The data obtained had good internal consistency, {{as indicated by the}} reliability analysis because all Cronbach’s Alpha coefficients were greater than 0. 65. The result of normality test showed that the data was normally distributed, as indicated by the statistics of skewness and kurtosis coefficients as well as the Q-Q plots. More precisely, the former indicators had their values falling within ± 3 for all dimensions of each variable, and the latter had depicted that the data points were close to the regression line. For cultural orientation, the pertaining formula for VSM 94 were used to assess the dimensional index value scores. Result indicated both UTM and SU students had low power distance and were primarily individualistic, feminine, and short-terms oriented. However, a contradicting result was found in the uncertainty avoidance dimension where the UTM’s respondents had shown a high uncertainty avoidance preference and that of SU was comparatively lower. For adjustment, all dimensional scores were greater than 3, the midpoint of the five point scale, which meant that the respondents could adjust to their lives in Malaysia. The results showed a negative gap scores for all five dimensions in UTM and SU. For the correlation analysis, a positive correlation between cultural orientation, <b>adjustment,</b> <b>service</b> quality, and satisfaction as a whole...|$|E

40|$|Background: Drug dosing {{errors are}} common in renal-impaired patients. Appropriate dosing {{adjustment}} and drug selection is important to ensure patients" safety and to avoid adverse drug effects and poor outcomes. There are few studies on this issue in community pharmacies. The aims of this study were, firstly, to determine the prevalence of dosing inadequacy {{as a consequence of}} renal impairment in patients over 65 taking 3 or more drug products who were being attended in community pharmacies and, secondly, {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the community pharmacist"s intervention in improving dosing inadequacy in these patients when compared with usual care. Methods: The study was carried out in 40 Spanish community pharmacies. The study had two phases: the first, with an observational, multicentre, cross sectional design, served to determine the dosing inadequacy, the drug-related problems per patient and to obtain the control group. The second phase, with a controlled study with historical control group, was the intervention phase. When dosing adjustments were needed, the pharmacists made recommendations to the physicians. A comparison was made between the control and the intervention group regarding the prevalence of drug dosing inadequacy and the mean number of drug-related problems per patient. Results: The mean of the prevalence of drug dosing inadequacy was 17. 5 % [95 % CI 14. 6 - 21. 5] in phase 1 and 15. 5 % [95 % CI 14. 5 - 16. 6] in phase 2. The mean number of drug-related problems per patient was 0. 7 [95 % CI 0. 5 - 0. 8] in phase 1 and 0. 50 [95 % CI 0. 4 - 0. 6] in phase 2. The difference in the prevalence of dosing inadequacy between the control and intervention group before the pharmacists" intervention was 0. 73 % [95 % CI (− 6. 0) - 7. 5] and after the pharmacists" intervention it was 13. 5 % [95 % CI 8. 0 - 19. 5] (p[*]<[*] 0. 001) while the difference in the mean of drug-related problems per patient before the pharmacists" intervention was 0. 05 [95 % CI(- 0. 2) - 0. 3] and following the intervention it was 0. 5 [95 % CI 0. 3 - 0. 7] (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). Conclusion: A drug dosing <b>adjustment</b> <b>service</b> for elderly patients with renal impairment in community pharmacies can increase the proportion of adequate drug dosing, and improve the drug-related problems per patient.
