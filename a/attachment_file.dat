40|$|Electronic mail is a {{communication}} model that is fundamental {{in the era}} of globalization. Proven on any form of registration data or information requires the presence of email address(electronic mail). The use of email itself cannot be separated from the abuse (such as stelling password and mail spoofing) from some parties so it needs security form in email communication. Communication security on mail server such as ZIMBRA mail server has been well-implemented, {{such as the use of}} ssl certificate.   But the security is still standard.   So, when user and password have been found out by third party, email content will be read easily (in cryptography technique it is called plaintext reading). On research that was conducted with pretty good privacy (PGP) method email communication security was focused on the email content by encrypting mail text along with the <b>attachment</b> <b>file.</b> In a study conducted, using the mail engine Zimbra mail server. Result of research shows that PGP security is able to secure email content whether the text or the attachment, showing difference of <b>attachment</b> <b>file</b> size is bigger on PGP using and change mail header from the standard mail...|$|E

50|$|Note {{that all}} these size limits are based, not on the {{original}} file size, but the MIME-encoded copy. The common Base64 encoding adds about 37% to the original file size, meaning that an original 20MB file could exceed a 25MB <b>file</b> <b>attachment</b> limit.A 10MB email size limit would require {{that the size of}} the <b>attachment</b> <b>files</b> is actually limited to about 7MB.|$|R

40|$|We {{present an}} {{empirical}} study of teams that revealed {{the amount of}} extraneous individual work needed to enable collaboration: finding references to other people, finding files to attach to email, managing incoming email attachments, managing the variety of files used in shared activities, and tracking what work is owed to others. Much of this work involves finding recently accessed objects that are needed again in the user’s current task focus. These observations led {{to the design of}} Recent Shortcuts, a tool to help support coordination by making recently used objects easily accessible. Recent Shortcuts enables quick access to people (including groups of people), received <b>attachments,</b> <b>files,</b> and file folders that the user interacted with recently for re-use in the user’s current context. Recent Shortcuts makes it easy to use these objects across applications with no additional user input and minimal changes to the user’s applications or work practice. Early user experiences with a working prototype led to an extension that integrates recently accessed objects across multiple devices...|$|R

2500|$|Although FidoNet {{supported}} <b>file</b> <b>attachments</b> {{from even}} the earliest standards, this feature {{tended to be}} rarely used and was often turned off. <b>File</b> <b>attachments</b> followed the normal mail routing through multiple systems, and could back up transfers all along the line as the files were copied. A solution was offered {{in the form of}} file requests, which made file transfers driven by the calling system and used one-time point-to-point connections instead of the traditional routing. Two such standards became common, [...] "WaZOO" [...] and [...] "Bark", which saw varying support among different mailers. Both worked in a similar fashion, with the mailer calling the remote system and sending a new handshake packet to request the files.|$|R
