Supervisor Zaki Ainul F, SS, M. Hum. 	The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to reveal social relationship between characters of Akutagawa Ryunosuke’s short story Jigoku Hen which complicated. This research to describes what kind of social relationships happened between one and other characters in the story. The method used in the research is structural method with sociology of literature approach. The structural method is used to analyze the elements of the intrinsic elements of Jigoku Hen short story, continued with analyze of social relationship between characters with theory of social relation basic in the study of sociology. In the stage of presentation the method used is descriptive of analysis. The result of research is the existence of social relationship between major character and three additional characters. The first social relationship is between Yoshihide (major character) and The Lord wich is dissociative relation called competition and contravention. Yoshihide’s relationship with his daughter is <b>associative</b> <b>relation</b> called cooperation. Yoshihide and ‘I’ dont have any social relationship. Moreover, the social relationship between The Lord and Yoshihide’s daughter is <b>associative</b> <b>relation</b> called accomodation and dissociative relation called conflict.

40|$|Key words weakly <b>associative</b> <b>relation</b> algebras, quasi-projections, {{decision}} problems Built on {{the foundations}} laid by Peirce, Schröder {{and others in}} the 19 th century, the modern development of relation algebras started with the work of Tarski and his colleagues [21, 22]. They showed that relation algebras can capture strong �rst-order theories like ZFC, and so their equational theory is undecidable. The less expressive class WA of weakly <b>associative</b> <b>relation</b> algebras were introduced by Maddux [7]. Németi [16] showed that WAs have a decidable universal theory. There has been extensive research on increasing the expressive power of WA by adding new operations [1, 4, 11, 13, 20]. Extensions of this kind usually also have decidable universal theories. Here we give an example extending WAs with set-theoretic projection elements where this is not the case. These logical connectives are set-theoretic counterparts of the axiomatic quasi-projections that have been investigated in the representation theory of relation algebras [6, 19, 22]. We prove that the quasi-equational theory of the extended class PWA is not recursively enumerable. By adding the difference operator one can turn WA and PWA to discriminator classes where each universal formula is equivalent to some equation. Hence our result implies that the projections turn the decidable equational theory of WA to non-recursively enumerable. Copyright line will be provided by the publisher 1 Introduction an...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Large-scale genomic studies {{based on}} {{transcriptome}} technologies provide clusters of genes {{that need to}} be functionally annotated. The Gene Ontology (GO) implements a controlled vocabulary organised into three hierarchies: cellular components, molecular functions and biological processes. This terminology allows a coherent and consistent description of the knowledge about gene functions. The GO terms related to genes come primarily from semi-automatic annotations made by trained biologists (annotation based on evidence) or text-mining of the published scientific literature (literature profiling). Results We report an original functional annotation method based on a combination of evidence and literature that overcomes the weaknesses and the limitations of each approach. It relies on the Gene Ontology Annotation database (GOA Human) and the PubGene biomedical literature index. We support these annotations with statistically associated GO terms and retrieve <b>associative</b> <b>relations</b> across the three GO hierarchies to emphasise the major pathways involved by a gene cluster. Both annotation methods and <b>associative</b> <b>relations</b> were quantitatively evaluated with a reference set of 7397 genes and a multi-cluster study of 14 clusters. We also validated the biological appropriateness of our hybrid method with the annotation of a single gene (cdc 2) and that of a down-regulated cluster of 37 genes identified by a transcriptome study of an in vitro enterocyte differentiation model (CaCo- 2 cells). Conclusion The combination of both approaches is more informative than either separate approach: literature mining can enrich an annotation based only on evidence. Text-mining of the literature can also find valuable associated MEDLINE references that confirm the relevance of the annotation. Eventually, GO terms networks can be built with <b>associative</b> <b>relations</b> in order to highlight cooperative and competitive pathways and their connected molecular functions. </p...|$|R

We will justify it {{from the perspective of}} modern findings of learning and cognitive concepts of teaching, and we will ephasize the role of the teacher in creating an appropriate literacy environment in the first grade of primary school. In theoretical foundations we will define quality teaching from the perspective of transmission and constructivist model. We will link the important elements of constructivism to the modern definition of literacy and explain the essential aspects of initial literacy in first grade. In the empirical part we will perform a pedagogical experiment. The control group of students will develop literacy in a systematic way according to the prevailing analytic-synthetic method with workbooks as the main learning material. The experimental group of students will develop literacy in a constructivist oriented way by introducing a variety of activities designed by the teacher and students together, considering students' abilities, prior knowledge and interest. We would like to determine whether transmission-oriented way of teaching and constructivist way of teaching differ in efficiency of developing/acquiring reading and writing skills of students in the first grade of primary school. We {{will focus on}} monitoring reading and writing skills of students (graphics awareness, phonological awareness, <b>associative</b> <b>relation</b> voice – letter, reading-writing exercises).

40|$|The Gene Ontology (GO) is a {{controlled}} vocabulary widely {{used for the}} annotation of gene products.

In contrast to previous studies (O’Seaghdha, 1989; Simpson, Peterson, Casteel, & Burgess, 1989), associative priming effects were not only obtained in correct sentences but also in scrambled word lists. Associative priming, however, was not obtained when the definite article and the target noun disagreed in syntactic gender.

This particular system apart from harnessing and visualizing real-time diverse quantifiable data, derived from everyday urban activities, aims to further provide the inhabitants with an agency via a continuous feedback loop processes to, ultimately, influence the physical and behavioural patterns of the city.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThis paper {{proposes a}} novel {{semantic}} method for auditing <b>associative</b> <b>relations</b> in biomedical terminologies. We tested our methodology on two Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) knowledge sources. MethodsWe use the UMLS semantic groups as high-level {{representations of the}} domain and range of relationships in the Metathesaurus and in the Semantic Network. A mapping created between Metathesaurus relationships and Semantic Network relationships forms the basis for comparing the signatures of a given Metathesaurus relationship to the signatures of the semantic relationship {{to which it is}} mapped. The consistency of Metathesaurus relations is studied for each relationship. ResultsOf the 177 associative relationships in the Metathesaurus, 84 (48 %) exhibit a high-degree of consistency with the corresponding Semantic Network relationships. Overall, 63 % of the 1. 8 M <b>associative</b> <b>relations</b> in the Metathesaurus are consistent with relations in the Semantic Network. ConclusionThe semantics of associative relationships in biomedical terminologies should be defined explicitly by their developers. The Semantic Network would benefit from being extended with new relationships and with new relations for some existing relationships. The UMLS editing environment could take advantage of the correspondence established between relationships in the Metathesaurus and the Semantic Network. Finally, the auditing method also yielded useful information for refining the mapping of associative relationships between the two sources...|$|R
