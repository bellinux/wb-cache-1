25|$|Recognizing {{the drug}} trade {{as a threat to}} {{regional}} security, Toledo sought to create a common Andean approach to the drug war. He saw that revenue from drug trafficking funded terrorist activities, but also that U.S. insistence on the eradication of coca crops failed to address the problem. <b>Alternative</b> <b>crop</b> programs were also being resisted by coca farmers who depended on the coca trade for their livelihood. At a meeting of the 19-member Rio group in May 2003, Toledo proposed developing a joint strategy to deal with drug trafficking, but pressure from Washington, which preferred bilateral efforts, helped kill the notion.|$|E

These crops support the agricultural economy, contribute {{to the protection of}} the environment, keep the rural population at the countryside and increase the wealth of less favored or disadvantaged regions. In this paper, we attempt to investigate the attitudes and perceptions of landowners in the prefectures of Rodopi and Evros, regarding investments in <b>alternative</b> <b>crops.</b> The results indicate that there are no substantial variations between the two regions. More specifically, the majority of landowners wish for their area's future development to be based on agriculture and <b>alternative</b> <b>crops,</b> and in parallel want to be trained on new agricultural production methods through seminars focusing on <b>alternative</b> <b>crops...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Millennia of {{selective}} breeding {{have resulted in}} varieties that look quite different. Also, breeding since circa 1930 has focused quite specifically on producing strains which would perform very poorly as sources of drug material. Hemp grown for fiber is planted closely, resulting in tall, slender plants with long fibers. [...] "Until the early 1900s industrial hemp was a valuable crop used {{all over the world}} for its strong fibers and oil seeds. Today, however, the common perception of the industrial hemp plant is generally negative and associated with the drug marijuana. This perception is the legacy of a century of powerful influences construing hemp as a dangerous drug, even though it is not a drug and {{it has the potential to}} be a profitable <b>alternative</b> <b>crop.</b> In the United States, the public's perception of hemp as marijuana has blocked hemp from becoming a useful crop and product," [...] in spite of its vital importance prior to World War II. Ideally, according to Britain's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the herb should be desiccated and harvested towards the end of flowering. This early cropping reduces the seed yield but improves the fiber yield and quality. In these strains of industrial hemp the tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content would have been very low.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{national}} coca cultivation {{having been}} prohibited from 1973 onwards and the rapid reduction of coca plantations up to 2000, coca {{is still being}} cultivated in the tropical region of  Cochabamba. Technical and economic aspects are responsible for many farmers deciding to continue to cultivate coca and not to cultivate <b>alternative</b> <b>crops.</b> Coca cultivation is technically more adaptable and less demanding than the five <b>alternative</b> <b>crops</b> analysed in this research (pineapples, banana, passion fruit, palm hearts and pepper). These require more input or capital from the producers than cultivating coca {{as well as more}} technical experience and skills on their part. In economic terms, the demand for coca leaves exceeds their supply, contrary to that of  alternative  crops; coca prices therefore tend to increase. This is why coca producers often obtain higher profits from cultivating coca than by cultivating <b>alternative</b> <b>crops.</b> Coca leaves can also be marketed relatively easily  compared to alternative products as coca purchasers are less demanding regarding coca leaf quality, their transport is easy and cheap and there is the possibility of quick, guaranteed sales.

50|$|The coca {{eradication}} {{policy has}} been criticised for its {{negative impact on the}} livelihood of coca growers in South America. In many areas of South America the coca leaf has traditionally been chewed and used in tea and for religious, medicinal and nutritional purposes by locals.

In many areas the US government and military has forced the eradication of coca without providing for any meaningful <b>alternative</b> <b>crop</b> for farmers, and has additionally destroyed many of their food or market crops, leaving them starving and destitute.|$|E
40|$|This essay {{presents}} {{the prospects of}} the <b>alternative</b> <b>crops</b> to the coca leaf, promoted by the `Programa de Desarrollo Alternativo´ (PDA), that {{has been carried out}} since 1996 in the coca-growing valleys, and that currently faces a difficult situation. Although during the 199599 period an important increase in the prices and production of coffee and cacao was observed, this situation has reverted ever since, and a large increase of the price of the coca leaf, as well as a significant decrease of the prices of coffee and cacao, have been observed. As a consequence, the small producers of the coca-growing valleys are abandoning so-called legal crops, among them coffee and cacao, and strongly retaking the production of the coca leaf. In the current situation, characterized by the lack of funding to develop <b>alternative</b> <b>crops</b> to the coca leaf, the possibility that growers agree to finance <b>alternative</b> <b>crops</b> with the profits obtained from the production of he coca leaf should be considered, and, on the other hand, the government and the international cooperation would agree to provide training, technical assistance, as well as to build up communications and other infrastructure. ...|$|R
40|$|In Missouri {{as well as}} much of the Midwest, {{the most}} popular double-cropping system was winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) {{followed}} by soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr).

Research was conducted to evaluate (1) winter wheat inter- and double-crop production systems, using a variety of <b>alternative</b> <b>crops,</b> and (2) the impact of different wheat row spacings on intercrop establishment and yields within the various cropping systems.
