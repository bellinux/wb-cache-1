Experiments on rats indicate that intravenous administration of any one among 16 rare earth metal trichlorides produces topical thrombohemorrhagic lesions at sites of epinephrine admin-istration.

Further, using the ability of mouse IgE to sensitize rat mast cells, a comparative study was also made of PCA reactions induced in mice and rats with mouse IgE. Antihistamines produced a partial inhibition of PCA reactions induced in mice with mouse IgG 1 or IgE and in rats with mouse IgE whereas <b>antiserotonin</b> inhibited PCA reactions induced in rats with mouse IgE, but had no effect on PCA reactions induced in mice with mouse IgG 1 or IgE. The simultaneous use of antihistamine and <b>antiserotonin</b> resulted in a total inhibition of PCA reactions induced in mice with IgG 1 and in a marked but not total inhibition of PCA reaction due to IgE; PCA reactions induced in rats with mouse IgE were totally inhibited. Compounds known to change the intracellular level of cyclic AMP were found to have little or no effect on PCA reactions induced in mice with either IgG 1 or IgE in spite of producing a complete marked inhibition of PCA reactions induced with mouse IgE in rats. Diethylcarbamazine or disodium cromoglycate were also very effective inhibitors of rat PCA reactions induced with mouse IgE although having no effect on PCA reaction induced in mice with this same antibody or with IgG 1. Thus, in spite of sharing common mediators released from the same type of target cell sensitized with the same type of antibody, PCA reactions induced in mice and rats with mouse IgE reacted very differently to the pharmacological effect of most of the drugs tested.

30|$|CH, {{which we}} {{used in this}} study, is {{generally}} used for migraine in pediatric patients, but not adult patients. In addition to its antihistaminic action, CH exerts <b>antiserotonin</b> and anticholinergic actions, and antagonizes histamine and serotonin receptors. It does not inhibit or chemically inactivate release of histamine and serotonin, but competitively and reversibly antagonizes histamine and serotonin at receptor sites. Therefore, we conclude that CH showed superior prophylactic efficacy to commonly used drugs in our patients owing to its inhibition of the release of vasoactive peptides, including calcitonin gene-related peptides, with simultaneous inhibition of both serotonin 1 B and 1 D receptors and prevention of neurogenic inflammation caused by stimulation of the trigeminal nerve in patients with refractory migraine (Villalon & Olsen 2009).

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{endotoxin}} {{on the body}} temperature of mice was studied in animals housed without bedding at an environmental temperature of 15 C. Rectal temperatures were measured during the initial 3 to 5 hr of exposure. Doses of endotoxin ranging from 0. 01 to 1 ld 50, as determined for mice maintained at 25 C, produce a hypothermia in proportion to dose. Concurrent injection of tryptophan magnified this response in a dose-dependent manner. Cyproheptadine, an <b>antiserotonin</b> drug, antagonized both the hypothermia produced by serotonin alone, and the augmentation of hypothermia produced by tryptophan in endotoxin-poisoned mice. α-Methyltryptophan, an analogue of the amino acid that is known to induce tryptophan pyrrolase, also antagonized the increased hypothermia produced by tryptophan.

Using immunofluorescence with an <b>antiserotonin</b> antibody, 5 -HT was localized in the brain and in some neurons of the larval tail of Phallusia mammillata. To test the effect of 5 -HT on development, we treated embryos with two different 5 -HT receptor subtype antagonists. Treatment at the gastrula stage with 10 μM ondansetron, an antagonist of the 5 -HT 3 receptor, induced anterior truncation and a short tail. At 10 μM, ritanserin, a 5 -HT 2 B receptor antagonist, induced larval phenotypes characterized by a roundish trunk region with flat papillae. The juveniles developed from these larvae had an abnormal cardiocirculatory system: their heart contractions were ineffective and their blood cells accumulated in the heart cavity. We conclude that an appropriate level of 5 -HT is necessary for correct development and morphogenesis. Moreover, a different key role for multiple receptors in modulating the morphogenetic effects of 5 -HT is suggested...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate whether 3 -methylindole (3 -Mi), a tryptamine analogue, could cause pulmonary injury in calves other than by cytotoxicity. Injection of 3 -Mi resulted in a marked increase of respiratory rate, decrease of tidal volume and increase in minute ventilation. Pulmonary mechanics values were also profoundly affected, lung dynamic compliance being reduced to approximately one-third of its baseline value and total pulmonary resistance being increased two-fold. Arterial oxygen partial pressure was dramatically reduced. Successive challenges with 3 -Mi after physiological saline pretreatment resulted in quantitatively identical alterations of pulmonary function values. Conversely, all these ventilatory, mechanical and gas exchange changes were abolished by pretreatment with serotonergic antagonists. It was concluded that intravenous administration of 3 -Mi to healthy calves induced immediate and reversible bronchoconstriction which affected both central and peripheral airways. Because the effect was abolished by pretreatment with <b>antiserotonin</b> drugs, it is suggested that 3 -Mi acts either directly by stimulating serotonergic receptors or indirectly through the release of serotonin from platelets. Current concepts of the physiopathological cascade underlying the toxicity of 3 -Mi should, therefore, be re-evaluated in the light of this pharmacological mechanism. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|To analyze {{mechanisms}} that modulate serotonin signaling, we investigated how Caenorhabditis elegans regulates {{the function of}} serotonergic motor neurons that stimulate egg-laying behavior. Egg laying is inhibited by the G protein Gαo and activated by the G protein Gαq. We found that Gαo and Gαq act directly in the serotonergic HSN motor neurons to control egg laying. There, the G proteins had opposing effects on transcription of the tryptophan hydroxylase gene tph- 1, which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme for serotonin biosynthesis. <b>Antiserotonin</b> staining confirmed that Gαo and Gαq antagonistically affect serotonin levels. Altering tph- 1 gene dosage showed that small changes in tph- 1 expression were sufficient to affect egg-laying behavior. Epistasis experiments showed that signaling through the G proteins has additional tph- 1 -independent effects. Our results indicate that (1) serotonin signaling is regulated by modulating serotonin biosynthesis and (2) Gαo and Gαq act in the same neurons to have opposing effects on behavior, in part, by antagonistically regulating transcription of specific genes. Gαo and Gαq have opposing effects on many behaviors in addition to egg laying and may generally act, {{as they do in}} the egg-laying system, to integrate multiple signals and consequently set levels of transcription of genes that affect neurotransmitter release...|$|E
40|$|Using {{substrate}} induction as a tool, {{we attempted}} to determine the role of tryptophan pyrrolase in the response to endotoxin in mice. Previous results {{have shown that the}} administration of the ld 50 of endotoxin lowers tryptophan pyrrolase activity. α-Methyltryptophan was found to maintain tryptophan pyrrolase activity above control levels in endotoxin-poisoned mice without increasing survival. 5 -Hydroxytryptophan, by contrast, lowered tryptophan pyrrolase activity but did not sensitize mice to endotoxin. These results suggest that tryptophan pyrrolase per se does not play a unique role in survival of mice poisoned with endotoxin. This enzyme, however, may reflect the fate of other liver enzymes inducible by adrenocorticoids. In mice given concurrent injections of tryptophan and endotoxin, tryptophan pyrrolase activity was elevated to a level intermediate between that of normal mice and that of mice given tryptophan alone. The mice injected with tryptophan and endotoxin also had about the same mortality as mice given endotoxin alone. Mice treated with tryptophan 4 hr after endotoxin, {{at a time when the}} substrate did not fully elevate tryptophan pyrrolase activity, died convulsively and in larger numbers than those given endotoxin alone. This effect was reversed by prior treatment with cyproheptadine, an <b>antiserotonin</b> drug.

40|$|Exposure to UV {{radiation}} induces {{skin cancer}} and suppresses the immune response. To induce immune suppression, the electromagnetic energy of UV radiation must be absorbed by an epidermal photoreceptor and {{converted into a}} biologically recognizable signal. Two photoreceptors have been recognized: DNA and trans-urocanic acid (UCA). Trans-UCA is normally found in the outermost layer of skin and isomerizes to the cis isomer upon exposure to UV radiation. Although UCA {{was identified as a}} UV photoreceptor years ago, and many have documented its ability to induce immune suppression, its exact mode of action remains elusive. Particularly vexing has been the identity of the molecular pathway by which cis-UCA mediates immune suppression. Here we provide evidence that cis-UCA binds to the serotonin [5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) ] receptor with relatively high affinity (Kd = 4. 6 nM). Anti-cis-UCA antibody precipitates radiolabeled 5 -HT, and the binding is inhibited by excess 5 -HT and/or excess cis-UCA. Similarly, anti- 5 -HT antibody precipitates radiolabeled cis-UCA, and the binding is inhibited by excess 5 -HT or excess cis-UCA. Calcium mobilization was activated when a mouse fibroblast line, stably transfected with the human 5 -HT 2 A receptor, was treated with cis-UCA. Cis-UCA-induced calcium mobilization was blocked with a selective 5 -HT 2 A receptor antagonist. UV- and cis-UCA-induced immune suppression was blocked by <b>antiserotonin</b> antibodies or by treating the mice with 5 -HT 2 A receptor antagonists. Our findings identify cis-UCA as a serotonin receptor ligand and indicate that the immunosuppressive effects of cis-UCA and UV radiation are mediated by activation of the 5 -HT 2 A receptor...|$|E

Because rat platelets are refractory to PAF and thromboemboli were not found in the mesenteric or intestinal microvasculature, they suspected that secondary mediators were involved in the pathogenesis of bowel necrosis. They have found the following lipoxygenase products of arachidonic acid, especially leukotrienes (LT), probably {{played an important role in}} the pathogenesis of bowel necrosis, because diethylcarbamazine (an inhibitor for LTA synthesis) and FPL 55712 (LT antagonist) ameliorated, and at times completely prevented, the lesions. NDGA (a nonspecific lipoxygenase inhibitor) was less effective, probably because of its additional effect on cyclooxygenase inhibition. Verapamil, a calcium channel blocker, ameliorated the disease. Thromboxane A 2, a potent vasoconstrictor, was probably not responsible for the ischemia of the gastrointestinal tract. This is suggested by the ineffectiveness of OKY- 046 in preventing bowel necrosis. Prostaglandin (PG) E 1 infusion often prevented the bowel necrosis, which suggested beneficial effects of vasodilating PGs, probably released as a defense mechanisms. Indomethacin aggravated the disease, probably by inhibiting PG release and shifting the metabolic pathway toward the lipoxygenase pathway. Antihistamine and <b>antiserotonin</b> had no effect, which suggested that these mediators were not involved in the pathogenesis of bowel necrosis.

A gas chromato-graphic method was developed for the analysis of CPH and a metabohite, desmethvl-cyproheptadine in tissues. The difference between the concentration of these two corn-pounds and the total tissue radioactivity was designated as “other metabolites ” (OM) and represented unidentified metabolites of CPH. After a p. o. dose, unchanged CPH and the metabolite desmethylcyproheptadine decreased relatively rapidly in rat tissues. The majority of the radioactivity in the kidney, liver and pancreas of the rat, as earh ’ as three hours after the dose, consisted of OM (unidentified metabolites) and at six hours the OM component comprised the majority of CPH-related compounds in all rat tissues except the brain.
