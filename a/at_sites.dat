The estimated dates of onset of cambial activity were compared with the corresponding heat sums, cal-culated in degree-days according to two models. Within years, Dateest varied among trees by up to 15 days <b>at</b> <b>Site</b> 1 and up to 13 days <b>at</b> <b>Site</b> 2. Among years, mean Dateest varied by 15. 3 days <b>at</b> <b>Site</b> 1 and 12. 0 days <b>at</b> <b>Site</b> 2. The overall mean Dateest differed between sites by 6 days (June 5 <b>at</b> <b>Site</b> 1 and June 11 <b>at</b> <b>Site</b> 2). Among all trees in all years, {{the mean number of}} degree days (d. d.) calculated from mean daily temperature above a thresh-old of 5 °C before Dateest ranged from 68. 7 to 135 d. d. <b>at</b> <b>Site</b> 1 and from 37. 4 to 154. 7 d. d. <b>at</b> <b>Site</b> 2.

40|$|The {{financial}} implications of manipulating nitrogen (N) inputs and management strategies for beef production systems were assessed. One-hectare grassland farmlets were grazed to a target sward height by beef steers; herbage surplus to grazing requirements was cut for silage. Three systems were compared: ‘CN’, conventional mineral N application to a grass monoculture and broadcast slurry; ‘TN’, tactical mineral N application at fortnightly intervals to a grass monoculture with slurry injection {{and the early}} housing of cattle; ‘GC’, a mixed grass/white clover sward with no mineral N addition and slurry injection. Comparisons were made on two contrasting soil types: a freely-draining sandy loam (site 1) and a poorly drained clay (site 2). Financial budgets for 1999 - 2000 show that estimated gross profit margins (gross outputs minus variable costs), after deducting contractor’s charges for sward preparation and fertiliser spreading, were highest for treatment CN <b>at</b> both <b>sites</b> Î(€ 1552, € 1356 and € 1461 ha- 1 for site 1 and € 1562, € 1281 and € 1287 ha- 1 for site 2, for treatments CN, TN and GC, respectively). Treatment TN was penalised by increased costs associated with an extended housed period {{and the need to}} purchase additional silage for winter feeding which cost € 242 ha- 1 <b>at</b> <b>site</b> 1 and € 250 ha- 1 <b>at</b> <b>site</b> 2. Savings in N fertiliser for TN in comparison with CN (€ 44 ha- 1 <b>at</b> <b>site</b> 1 and € 39 ha- 1 <b>at</b> <b>site</b> 2) were more than offset by the increased costs of fortnightly fertiliser applications (€ 54 ha- 1 <b>at</b> <b>site</b> 1 and € 46 ha- 1 <b>at</b> <b>site</b> 2). Treatment GC benefited from zero costs for the purchase and spreading of mineral N fertiliser but was penalised by increased variation in forage DM production which resulted in a shortfall in winter fodder requirements with a replacement cost of € 250 <b>at</b> <b>site</b> 1 and € 435 <b>at</b> <b>site</b> 2. The best overall economic performance after the allocation of all possible relevant costs (variable, fixed and capital) in terms of the relative net profit margin, was for GC <b>at</b> <b>site</b> 1 and for CN <b>at</b> <b>site</b> 2 (-€ 1358, -€ 2399 and -€ 1304 ha- 1 <b>at</b> <b>site</b> 1 and -€ 1122, -€ 2810 and - € 1380 ha- 1 <b>at</b> <b>site</b> 2, for CN, TN and GC, respectively).
