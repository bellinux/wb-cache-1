In this work, we derive optimal rules directly for even-degree spaces and therefore further improve our recent result. We use optimal quadrature rules for spaces over two elements as elementary building blocks and use recursively the homotopy continuation concept described in Bartoň and Calo (2016) to derive optimal rules for arbitrary <b>admissible</b> <b>numbers</b> of elements. We demonstrate the proposed methodology on relevant examples, where we derive optimal rules for various even-degree spline spaces.

Also, here are considered several examples, such as ``Groebner flags'', generic algebras, and algebras with one relation. A generalization of the concept Koszul filtration (generalized Koszul, or rate, filtration) leads to algebras with finite Backelin's rate and to coherent algebras.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} ω-algebraic {{complete}} partial orders {{are considered the}} compact elements of which are not maximal in the partial order. Under the assumption that these elements are indexed such that their equality is decidable and the order is semi-decidable (completely enumerable) it is shown that the computable domain elements can be effectively enumerated without repetition. Computable one-to-one enumerations of the computable domain elements are minimal among all enumerations of these elements {{with respect to the}} reducibility of one enumeration to another. In computability studies of continuous complete partial orders one usually uses a generalization of Gödel numberings, called admissible numberings. They are maximal among the computable enumerations. As it is shown, each <b>admissible</b> <b>numbering</b> is recursively isomorphic to the directed sum of a computable family of computable one-to-one enumerations. Both results generalize well-known theorems of Friedberg and Schinzel respectively for the partial recursive functions. Their premise is satisfied by each type in the hierarchy of the Eršov-Scott higher type partial computable functionals, which means that any such type can be computably enumerated without repetition and any of its admissible indexings is recursively isomorphic to the directed sum of a computable family of computable one-to-one enumerations.

40|$|We {{consider}} vortex {{dynamics in}} the context of Bose-Einstein Condensates (BEC) with a rotating trap, with or without anisotropy. Starting with the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) partial differential equation (PDE), we derive a novel reduced system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that describes stable configurations of multiple co-rotating vortices (vortex crystals). This description is found to be quite accurate quantitatively {{especially in the case of}} multiple vortices. In the limit of many vortices, BECs are known to form vortex crystal structures, whereby vortices tend to arrange themselves in a hexagonal-like spatial configuration. Using our asymptotic reduction, we derive the effective vortex crystal density and its radius. We also obtain an asymptotic estimate for the maximum number of vortices as a function of rotation rate. We extend considerations to the anisotropic trap case, confirming that a pair of vortices lying on the long (short) axis is linearly stable (unstable), corroborating the ODE reduction results with full PDE simulations. We then further investigate the many-vortex limit in the case of strong anisotropic potential. In this limit, the vortices tend to align themselves along the long axis, and we compute the effective one-dimensional vortex density, as well as the maximum <b>admissible</b> <b>number</b> of vortices. Detailed numerical simulations of the GP equation are used to confirm our analytical predictions...|$|E
40|$|Summary. Two Life Tests {{recently}} {{suggested by}} various Government Agencies {{are described in}} sections 1 and 4 respectively {{and the consequences of}} their application are discussed. It is shown that to satisfy them with some reasonable probability the manufacturer has to produce equipment of much higher standard than initially stipulated. Although the tests are meant to be designed so that the probability fi of accepting an inferior equipment would be appropriately small, it is shown that the second test does not satisfy this condition leading to the acceptance of inferior equipment with much greater probability (section 7). 1. Lately it has been the practice of some Government Agencies in this country (Ref. 1) and in the U. S. A.

40|$|The {{subject matter}} of the thesis is the study of {{managerial}} incentive schemes for public enterprises. The problem of incentives and control is characterized in Chapter I stressing asymmetric information and preferences between principal (Minister) and agent (Manager). Chapter II reconsiders the findings of some previous works on the use of simple mechanisms under certainty and it shows that incentive problems may be solved with a pure-rent type contract. One of the parameters of the contract (profit-sharing ratio) is central to the enforcement of 'managerial' efficiency while the relative weights given to profit and (an approximation to) consumer surplus will influence optimal pricing decisions. This feature is maintained in a risky environment (Chapter III) although reinterpreted in a second-best fashion due to the trade-off between incentives and risk-sharing. The weights given to each side of the contract depend on the impact of price changes upon the degree of profit-uncertainty and the managerially self-selected level of effort. In addition it is shown that, when providing incentives, the Minister will depart from the pricing rule derived under full information. Chapter IV shows that these results are valid when capacity choice and non-price rationing issues become relevant. Chapter V attempts to integrate the issues of performance indicators and efficiency audits into the previous framework. It is shown that there must exist an upper limit to the <b>admissible</b> <b>number</b> of performance indicators and that efficiency audits can be designed as conditional investigation procedures and used according to an expected cost-benefit characterization. Some central underlying factors affecting the form of the optimal investigation strategy are identified. Finally, Chapter VI attempts to consider the previous results and their implications within a brief discussion of U. K. policy for public enterprises in the last decades. </p...|$|E

Then, in order to obtain a larger upper bound of the time-varying delay, a generalized finite-sum inequality is introduced, based on which, a less conservative stability condition is derived by incorporating with convex combination technique.
