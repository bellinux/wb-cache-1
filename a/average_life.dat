5|$|The <b>average</b> <b>life</b> span {{is unknown}} but {{in common with}} seabirds such as the {{wandering}} albatross and Leach's storm petrel, frigatebirds are long-lived. In 2002, 35 ringed great frigatebirds were recovered on Tern Island in the Hawaiian Islands. Of these ten were older than 37 years and one was at least 44 years of age.|$|E
40|$|Background: Forty years ago, G. C. Williams {{predicted}} that reproductive effort should be {{inversely related to}} the <b>average</b> adult <b>life</b> span across species. Aim: Use allometric life-history theory to refine that prediction. Result: Reproductive effort should be inversely proportional to <b>average</b> adult <b>life</b> span, a − 1 scaling rule...|$|R

50|$|It {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{deprived}} constituencies in Britain. Nearly 40% of adults smoke, and on average there are 25 drug-related deaths a year. <b>Average</b> male <b>life</b> expectancy is 68, five years less than the Scottish average, while in the Shettleston area it is 63. A 2008 World Health Organisation report gave the <b>average</b> male <b>life</b> expectancy in Calton as 54.|$|R
5|$|The breed has {{no known}} genetic health issues. Blue Picardy Spaniels can {{be prone to}} ear infections, which are common among dogs with {{pendulous}} ears, including Basset Hounds and other breeds of Spaniel. It has an <b>average</b> <b>life</b> expectancy of thirteen years.|$|E
5|$|The community, {{consisting}} of approximately 42mainland and Torres Strait Islander clan or family groups, suffers from chronic alcohol, drug and domestic abuse, has an unemployment rate of 90% and an <b>average</b> <b>life</b> expectancy of 50years, thirty {{less than the}} Australian average.|$|E
5|$|A fairly {{comprehensive}} demographic {{study was}} done by historian John Demos for his seminal 1970 work on the Pilgrims A Little Commonwealth. He reports that the colony's average household grew from 7.8 children per family for first-generation families to 8.6 children for second-generation families, and to 9.3 for third-generation families. Child mortality also decreased over this time, with 7.2 children born to first-generation families living until their 21st birthday. That number increased to 7.9 children by the third generation. Life expectancy was higher for men than for women. Of the men who survived {{until the age of}} 21, the <b>average</b> <b>life</b> expectancy was 69.2 years. Over 55 percent of these men lived past 70; less than 15 percent died before the age of 50. For women, the numbers are much lower, owing to the difficulties inherent in childbearing. The <b>average</b> <b>life</b> expectancy of women at the age of 21 was only 62.4 years. Of these women, less than 45 percent lived past 70, and about 30 percent died before the age of 50.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to calculate <b>average</b> years of <b>life</b> lost due to breast and cervical cancer in Mexico in 2000 and 2010. Data on mortality in women aged between 20 and 84 years was obtained from the National Institute for Statistics and Geography. Age-specific mortality rates and <b>average</b> years of <b>life</b> lost, which is an estimate of the number of years that a person would have lived if he or she had not died prematurely, were estimated for both diseases. Data was disaggregated into five-year age groups and socioeconomic status based on the 2010 marginalization index obtained from the National Population Council. A decrease in <b>average</b> years of <b>life</b> lost due to cervical cancer (37. 4 %) and an increase in <b>average</b> years of <b>life</b> lost due breast cancer (8. 9 %) was observed during the period studied. <b>Average</b> years of <b>life</b> lost due to cervical cancer was greater among women living in areas with a high marginalization index, while <b>average</b> years of <b>life</b> lost due to breast cancer was greater in women from areas with a low marginalization index...|$|R

5|$|According to the United Kingdom Census 2001, Felling has a {{population}} of 7,299—51.5% of the population are female, slightly above the national average, while 48.5% are male. Only 2.3% of the population were from a black or other minority ethnic group (BME), as opposed to 9.1% of the national population. The <b>average</b> <b>life</b> expectancy is 71 years for men in Felling and 75 years for women. These compare unfavourably to borough averages of 76 and 81 years respectively.|$|E
5|$|Breeding {{densities of}} this waxwing are {{typically}} {{low compared to}} other passerines, usually less than ten birds per square kilometre (26per square mile) even in good habitat, although up to 35·6birds per square kilometre (92per square mile) {{have been found in}} Russia. One brood each year is normal. Maximum recorded ages are 5years 10months in North America and more than 13years 6months in Europe. The <b>average</b> <b>life</b> expectancy is unknown. Significant causes of death include predation, collisions with windows and cars, and poisoning by road salt consumed when drinking.|$|E
5|$|The average yearly {{survival}} rate of emperor penguins has been measured at 95.1%, with an <b>average</b> <b>life</b> expectancy of 19.9years. The same researchers estimated that 1% of emperor penguins hatched could feasibly reach {{an age of}} 50years. In contrast, only 19% of chicks survive {{their first year of}} life. Therefore, 80% of the emperor penguin population comprises adults five years and older.|$|E

50|$|Life explores {{humanity}} {{through three}} separate areas dedicated to mind, body, and spirit. The Mind area contains optical illusions, physical illusions, an anechoic chamber, and a posable zoetrope. Spirit discusses {{the concept of}} birth and death and how human cultures understand them. Body features interactive health stations where visitors can record their weight, flexibility, and heart rate, then compare their statistics to that of COSI visitors and national <b>averages.</b> <b>Life</b> also contains the Labs in Life, three working medical research pods staffed by OSU Health & Medicine students and staff.|$|R
5|$|The bore {{evacuator}} and the gun's thermal sleeve, {{designed to}} regulate {{the temperature of the}} barrel, are made of glass-reinforced plastic, while the barrel has a chrome lining to increase barrel life. Originally the gun had an EFC barrel life of ~1,500 rounds, but with recent advances in propellant technology the <b>average</b> <b>life</b> has increased even further. The gun's recoil mechanism is composed of two hydraulic retarders and a hydropneumatic assembly.|$|E
5|$|The breed is {{generally}} healthy with an <b>average</b> <b>life</b> span of 12 to 15 years. Hip dysplasia, a genetic malformation {{of the hip}} joint, may be a concern {{but because of the}} breed's compact nature is not often seriously debilitating. Surveys conducted by the Orthopedic Foundation For Animals showed that 41.5% of Sussex Spaniels were affected by hip dysplasia, and the breed was ranked 9th worst affected out of 157 breeds.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{department responsible for}} the NHS is the Department of Health, headed by the Secretary of State for Health, who sits in the British Cabinet. Most of the expenditure of the Department of Health is spent on the NHS—£98.6billion was spent in 2008–2009. In recent years the private sector has been increasingly used to provide more NHS services despite opposition by doctors and trade unions. The <b>average</b> <b>life</b> expectancy of people in England is 77.5 years for males and 81.7 years for females, the highest of the four countries of the United Kingdom.|$|E

Prior to May 2008, the races had used more than eight tons of fabric for the various pylons, and the <b>average</b> <b>life</b> of each pylon was 15 races. Thirty-five pylons are transported to each race, and at each race's completion, the pylons are sent to Innsbruck, Austria to be repaired.|$|E
5|$|About 0.3–0.7% {{of people}} are {{affected}} by schizophrenia during their lifetimes. In 2013 there were an estimated 23.6 million cases globally. Males are more often affected than females. About 20% of people do well and a few recover completely. Social problems, such as long-term unemployment, poverty and homelessness are common. The <b>average</b> <b>life</b> expectancy of people with the disorder is ten to twenty-five years less than for the general population. This {{is the result of}} increased physical health problems and a higher suicide rate (about 5%). In 2015 an estimated 17,000 people worldwide died from behavior related to, or caused by, schizophrenia.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{concerns}} are hypothyroidism, allergies, epilepsy, diabeties and glandular disorders which may cause baldness. The hair loss occurs at around {{six months of}} age, affecting the neck, thighs and tail; however the frequency has been reduced through work conducted by the breed clubs. Hip dysplasia is seen in around 8.3% of the breed, according to surveys conducted by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals over a twenty five-year period between 1974 and 1999. This {{was one of the}} lower results of the sporting breeds, with Greyhounds coming lowest with 3.4%, and the related Boykin Spaniel coming in second highest at 47%. There was no evidence of elbow dysplasia found. The breed has an <b>average</b> <b>life</b> span of 1013 years.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>average</b> total <b>life</b> span of T. trichiura is one year, {{although}} there have been longer cases reported, lasting as long as five years (Note: inadequate treatment and re-infection are likely {{to play a role in}} this).|$|R
5|$|Alzheimer's disease (AD), also {{referred}} to simply as Alzheimer's, is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that usually starts slowly and worsens over time. It {{is the cause of}} 60% to 70% of cases of dementia. The most common early symptom is difficulty in remembering recent events (short-term memory loss). As the disease advances, symptoms can include problems with language, disorientation (including easily getting lost), mood swings, loss of motivation, not managing self care, and behavioural issues. As a person's condition declines, they often withdraw from family and society. Gradually, bodily functions are lost, ultimately leading to death. Although the speed of progression can vary, the <b>average</b> <b>life</b> expectancy following diagnosis is three to nine years.|$|E
5|$|Because the kakapo is long-lived, with an <b>average</b> <b>life</b> {{expectancy}} of 58years and the maximum at about 90 years, {{it tends to}} have an adolescence before it starts breeding. Males start booming at about 5years of age. It was thought that females reached sexual maturity at 9 years of age, but this idea was debunked in the 2008 breeding season when two 6-year-old females named Apirama and Rakiura laid eggs. Generally females do not seek out males until they are between 9 and 11 years old. The kakapo does not breed every year and {{has one of the}} lowest rates of reproduction among birds. Breeding occurs only in years when trees mast (fruit heavily), providing a plentiful food supply. Rimu mast occurs only every three to five years, so in rimu-dominant forests such as those on Codfish Island, kakapo breeding occurs as infrequently.|$|E
5|$|Bulgaria has a {{universal}} healthcare system financed by taxes and contributions. The National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) pays a gradually increasing {{portion of the}} costs of primary healthcare. Projected healthcare expenditures for 2013 amount to 4.1 percent of GDP. The number of doctors is above the EU average with 181 physicians per 100,000 people, but distribution by fields of practice is uneven, there is a severe shortage of nurses and other medical personnel, and the quality of most medical facilities is poor. Personnel shortages in some fields are so severe that patients resort to seeking treatment in neighboring countries. Bulgaria ranks 121st globally by <b>average</b> <b>life</b> expectancy, which stands at 74.5 years for both genders. The primary causes of death are similar to those in other industrialised countries, mainly cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms and respiratory diseases.|$|E
40|$|The study {{estimates}} relative city price convergence using CPI {{data from}} July 2001 to June 2008 on 35 Pakistani cities. Two cities Lahore and Karachi are {{chosen to be}} the numeraire cities. The half life of relative city price shock has also been estimated. The study finds <b>average</b> half <b>life</b> of price shock {{to be less than}} 5 months but it varies from 1. 3 to 68 months in the case of individual cities. The estimates of Spatial GLS are found to be lower than OLS which may imply that Spatial Correlations are important factor for the estimation of half <b>life.</b> Furthermore, the <b>average</b> half <b>life</b> of a price shock in Lahore is less than that of Karachi. ...|$|R
5000|$|Churn {{is closely}} related to the concept of <b>average</b> {{customer}} <b>life</b> time. For example, an annual churn rate of 25 percent implies an <b>average</b> customer <b>life</b> of four years. An annual churn rate of 33 percent implies an <b>average</b> customer <b>life</b> of three years. The churn rate can be minimized by creating barriers which discourage customers to change suppliers (contractual binding periods, use of proprietary technology, value-added services, unique business models, etc.), or through retention activities such as loyalty programs. It is possible to overstate the churn rate, as when a consumer drops the service but then restarts it within the same year. Thus, a clear distinction needs to be made between [...] "gross churn", the total number of absolute disconnections, and [...] "net churn", the overall loss of subscribers or members. The difference between the two measures is the number of new subscribers or members that have joined during the same period. Suppliers may find that if they offer a loss-leader [...] "introductory special", it can lead to a higher churn rate and subscriber abuse, as some subscribers will sign on, let the service lapse, then sign on again to take continuous advantage of current specials.|$|R
