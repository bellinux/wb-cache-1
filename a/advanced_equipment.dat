5|$|Rogers {{recruits}} Barnes, Dum Dum Dugan, Gabe Jones, Jim Morita, James Montgomery Falsworth, and Jacques Dernier {{to attack}} other known Hydra bases. Stark outfits Rogers with <b>advanced</b> <b>equipment,</b> most notably a circular shield made of vibranium, a rare, nearly indestructible metal. Rogers {{and his team}} sabotage various Hydra operations. The team later assaults a train carrying Zola. Rogers and Jones succeed in capturing Zola, but Barnes falls from the train to his assumed death. Using information extracted from Zola, the final Hydra stronghold is located, and Rogers leads an attack to stop Schmidt from using {{weapons of mass destruction}} on major American cities. Rogers climbs aboard Schmidt's aircraft as it takes off, and during the subsequent fight the Tesseract's container is damaged. Schmidt physically handles the Tesseract, causing him to dissolve in a bright light. The Tesseract burns through the plane and is lost in the ocean. Seeing no way to land the plane without the risk of detonating its weapons, Rogers crashes it in the Arctic. Stark later recovers the Tesseract from the ocean floor but is unable to locate Rogers or the aircraft, presuming him dead.|$|E

George Town, in particular, {{has become the}} medical tourism hub of Malaysia, attracting {{approximately half of the}} nation's medical tourist arrivals in 2013 and generating about 70% of Malaysia's medical tourism revenue.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis of {{megalencephaly}} {{has changed}} over the years, however, with the development of more <b>advanced</b> <b>equipment,</b> physicians have been able to confirm the disorder with better accuracy. Usually, a physical exam is first performed when characteristics of megalencephaly have appeared. This typically occurs at birth or during early child development. A physician will then take head measurements {{in order to determine the}} circumference. This is known as the head circumference. Then a family background will be recorded in order to determine if there has been a history of megalencephaly in the family.|$|E
25|$|Some skills {{also have}} a Tech Level (TL) rating {{attached}} to them, to differentiate between Skills that concern similar concepts, but whose tasks are accomplished in different ways when used with differing levels of technology. This helps during time traveling scenarios, or when characters are forced to deal with particularly outdated or <b>advanced</b> <b>equipment.</b> For instance, a modern boat builder's skills will be of less use if he is stuck on a desert island and forced to work with primitive tools and techniques. Thus, the skills he uses are different when in his shop (Shipbuilding/TL8) and when {{he is on the}} island (Shipbuilding/TL0).|$|E

25|$|With video interpreting, sign {{language}} interpreters work remotely with live {{video and audio}} feeds, so that the interpreter can see the deaf or mute party, and converse with the hearing party, and vice versa. Much like telephone interpreting, video interpreting {{can be used for}} situations in which no on-site interpreters are available. However, video interpreting cannot be used for situations in which all parties are speaking via telephone alone. VRS and VRI interpretation requires all parties to have the necessary equipment. Some <b>advanced</b> <b>equipment</b> enables interpreters to control the video camera remotely, in order to zoom in and out or to point the camera toward the party that is signing.|$|E
25|$|The game {{begins on}} January 1, 1999, with the player {{choosing}} a location {{for their first}} base on the Geoscape screen: a global view representation of Earth as seen from space (displaying X-COM bases and aircraft, detected UFOs, alien bases, and sites of alien activity). The player can view the X-COM bases and make changes to them, equip fighter aircraft, order supplies and personnel (soldiers, scientists and engineers), direct research efforts, schedule manufacturing of <b>advanced</b> <b>equipment,</b> sell alien artifacts on black market to raise money, and deploy X-COM aircraft to either patrol designated locations, intercept UFOs, or send X-COM ground troops on missions using transport aircraft.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, the {{paramedic}} is a paraprofessional {{whose primary}} focus {{is to provide}} advanced emergency medical care for critical and emergency patients who access Emergency Medical Services (EMS). This individual possesses the complex knowledge and skills necessary to provide patient care and transportation. Paramedics function {{as part of a}} comprehensive EMS response, under medical oversight. Paramedics perform interventions with the basic and <b>advanced</b> <b>equipment</b> typically found on an ambulance. The paramedic is a link from the scene into the health care system. One of the eligibility requirements for state certification or licensure requires successful completion of a nationally accredited Paramedic program at the certificate or associate degree level. Each state varies in requirements to practice as a paramedic and not all states require licensure.|$|E

25|$|Coronary {{catheterization}} {{is performed}} in a catheterization lab, usually located within a hospital. With current designs, the patient must lie relatively flat on a narrow, minimally padded, radiolucent (transparent to X-ray) table. The X-ray source and imaging camera equipment are {{on opposite sides of}} the patient's chest and freely move, under motorized control, around the patient's chest so images can be taken quickly from multiple angles. More <b>advanced</b> <b>equipment,</b> termed a bi-plane cath lab, uses two sets of X-ray source and imaging cameras, each free to move independently, which allows two sets of images to be taken with each injection of radiocontrast agent. The equipment and installation setup to perform such testing typically represents a capital expenditure of US$2–5 million (2004), sometimes more, partially repeated every few years.|$|E
25|$|The 89-seat One-Eleven 400s and 119-seat One-Eleven 500s {{operated}} by the second BIA filled a niche in the UK charter market, {{which at the time}} was dominated by 130-seat Boeing 737-200s {{operated by}} BIA's much bigger, vertically integrated competitors. These smaller, second-hand aircraft's lower acquisition costs (compared with the competition's bigger and newer 737-200s) enabled BIA to offer tour operators lower capacity aircraft at keener rates, giving it a competitive advantage on less dense routes. The One-Eleven 400's ability to match the 737-200's range, as well as both One-Eleven variants' ability to match the 737's fuel consumption and to comply with stricter, post-1985 noise abatement rules (as a result of having hush kits fitted to their engines), further enhanced BIA's competitiveness vis-à-vis its rivals. This helped attract business from the big tour operators that owned its rivals, especially to secondary European ski destinations served in winter where the lower trip costs of BIA's older planes outweighed the seat-mile cost advantage of the in-house airlines' technologically more <b>advanced</b> <b>equipment.</b> This in turn helped minimise the tour operators' risk, thereby representing a 'win-win' situation for both parties.|$|E
500|$|Finally in October 1929, {{the last}} contest was announced. The winner was the design [...] "Shine like a star!" [...] (...) by {{sculptor}} Kārlis Zāle, {{who had had}} success in the previous contests as well. After minor corrections made by the author and supervising architect Ernests Štālbergs, construction began on November 18, 1931. Financed by private donations, the monument was erected by {{the entrance to the}} old town, in the same place where the previous central monument of Riga, a bronze equestrian statue of the Russian Emperor Peter the Great had stood from 1910 until the outbreak of World War I. It was calculated in 1935, the year when the monument was unveiled, that in four years of construction 308,000 man-hours were required to work the stone materials alone: 130 years would have been required if one person were to carry out the work using the most <b>advanced</b> <b>equipment</b> of the time. The total weight of materials used was about 2,500 tons: such a quantity of materials would have required about 200 freight cars if transported by railway.|$|E

500|$|Marcus can hack {{into various}} {{electronic}} devices {{connected to the}} ctOS system with his in-game smartphone. For example, Marcus can modify the personal information of non-player characters to have them arrested, hack and manipulate every mobile phone featured in the game, disrupt traffic by hacking cars and traffic lights, hack into monitoring cameras, and carry out [...] "mass hacking", which hacks the electrical equipment of {{a large group of}} people. Players also gain multiple options while hacking the same object. For instance, if the player attempts to hack a car, they can gain direct control over them, or have the car lose control and crash in a random direction. If the player hacks a junction box, they can choose whether they should deactivate it or turn it into a proximity mine. Unlike Aiden, the protagonist of the first game, Marcus has an arsenal of <b>advanced</b> <b>equipment,</b> including a quadcopter and a remote-controlled car, both of which can be used for remote hacking and scouting. Marcus' apparel can be customized with over 700 articles of clothing, available for purchase in stores that maintain fashion styles unique to what is worn by the denizens in each area. The game features several main story missions, and side-missions known as [...] "operations". Once completed, Marcus' follower count will increase, which {{is an important part of}} the narrative.|$|E

2500|$|The {{deliberate}} {{separation of}} the Luftwaffe {{from the rest of}} the military structure encouraged the emergence of a major [...] "communications gap" [...] between Hitler and the Luftwaffe, which other factors helped to exacerbate. For one thing, Göring's fear of Hitler led him to falsify or misrepresent what information was available in the direction of an uncritical and over-optimistic interpretation of air strength. When Göring decided against continuing Wever's original heavy bomber programme in 1937, the Reichsmarschall's own explanation was that Hitler wanted to know only how many bombers there were, not how many engines each had. In July 1939, Göring arranged a display of the Luftwaffes most <b>advanced</b> <b>equipment</b> at Rechlin, to give the impression the air force was more prepared for a strategic air war than was actually the case.|$|E
