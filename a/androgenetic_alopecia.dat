25|$|Growth of spermatogenic {{tissue in}} testicles, male fertility, penis or {{clitoris}} enlargement, increased libido {{and frequency of}} erection or clitoral engorgement. Growth of jaw, brow, chin, nose, and remodeling of facial bone contours, in conjunction with human growth hormone. Completion of bone maturation and termination of growth. This occurs indirectly via estradiol metabolites and hence more gradually in men than women. Increased muscle strength and mass, shoulders become broader and rib cage expands, deepening of voice, growth of the Adam's apple. Enlargement of sebaceous glands. This might cause acne, subcutaneous fat in face decreases. Pubic hair extends to thighs and up toward umbilicus, development of facial hair (sideburns, beard, moustache), loss of scalp hair (<b>androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia),</b> increase in chest hair, periareolar hair, perianal hair, leg hair, armpit hair.|$|E

50|$|Cioteronel (INN, USAN) (developmental {{code name}} CPC-10997; former {{tentative}} brand names Cyoctol, Ethocyn, X-Andron) is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen (NSAA) {{that was never}} marketed. It was under development between 1989 and 2001 for the topical treatment of <b>androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia</b> (male pattern baldness) and acne and for the oral treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia; it reached phase III clinical trials for acne and phase II studies for <b>androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia,</b> but was ultimately discontinued due to poor efficacy.|$|E

5000|$|Adenosine {{has been}} shown to promote {{thickening}} of hair on people with thinning hair. [...] A 2013 study compared topical adenosine to minoxidil in male <b>androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia,</b> finding it was not superior to minoxidil and further trials were needed.|$|E
50|$|Also in this {{category}} is cicatricial pattern hair loss (CPHL). This CCCA pattern is a potential alopecia mimic that can be confused for <b>androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia.</b> Alopecia mimics have proven a problem in establishing diagnosis of alopecia when using only clinical evaluation.|$|E
50|$|In {{the field}} of {{aesthetics}} and plastic surgery, the clinical application is particularly wide and is {{under the name of}} Regenerative Plastic Surgery. PRP associated with adipose tissue, is given for breast reconstruction, facial soft tissues defects, lower extremity ulcers and scars. Promising results were obtained in the treatment of <b>androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia,</b> as emerged from scientific studies published since 2013. Among these, the most significant by impact factor is the randomized scientific-clinical study of the clinical-instrumental evaluation of the effect of PRP in <b>androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia</b> published in 2015 by Pietro Gentile et al and a multidisciplinary team at the University of Rome Tor Vergata The Effect of Platelet Rich Plasma in Hair Regrowth: A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanism}} of 5α reductase inhibition is complex, but involves the binding of NADPH to the enzyme {{followed by the}} substrate. 5α-reductase inhibitor drugs are used in benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostate cancer, pattern hair loss (<b>androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia),</b> and hormone replacement therapy for transgender women.|$|E
5000|$|Kinking hair (also {{known as}} [...] "Acquired {{progressive}} kinking") {{is a condition}} primarily reposted in postpubescent males with <b>androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia,</b> presenting with gradual curling and darkening of the frontal, temporal, auricular, and vertex hairs which, under the microscope, show kinks and twists with or without longitudinal grooving.|$|E
50|$|Dutasteride is {{approved}} {{for the treatment}} of male <b>androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia</b> in South Korea at a dosage of 0.5 mg per day. It has been found in several studies to improve hair growth in men more rapidly and {{to a greater extent than}} 2.5 mg/day finasteride. Dutasteride has also been used off-label in the treatment of female pattern hair loss.|$|E
50|$|Dietary {{supplements}} are {{not typically}} recommended. There {{is only one}} small trial of saw palmetto which shows tentative benefit in those with mild to moderate <b>androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia.</b> There is no evidence for biotin.

50|$|Another study (Rossi et al., 2012) was {{conducted}} to determine how effective saw palmetto was for hair loss prevention and compared its effects with finasteride. The researchers used 100 male patients that were diagnosed with mild to moderate <b>androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia.</b> The patients were split into two groups, one received saw palmetto(320 mg) and the other received finasteride (1mg).|$|E
50|$|It was {{developed}} by GlaxoSmithKline and is a 5α-reductase inhibitor which prevents {{the conversion of the}} androgen sex hormone testosterone into the more potent dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The drug has been licensed for the treatment of <b>androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia</b> in South Korea since 2009 and in Japan since 2015, but has not been approved for this specific indication in the United States, though it is commonly used off-label.|$|E
50|$|Finasteride is {{sometimes}} {{used to treat}} pattern hair loss (<b>androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia)</b> in men only. Treatment slows further hair loss and provides about 30% improvement in hair loss {{after six months of}} treatment, with effectiveness usually only persisting as long as the drug is taken, although on occasion hair loss is slowed indefinitely following withdrawal.Finasteride has also been tested for pattern hair loss in women; the results were no better than placebo.|$|E
50|$|Acting through DP2, PGD2 can inhibit hair growth, {{suggesting}} that this receptor is a potential target for bald treatment. A potential drug for blocking the DP2 receptor and thereby ameliorating baldness is the compound Setipiprant. A phase 2A study is underway to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of oral setipiprant relative to a placebo and the active comparator, finasteride, in 18 to 41 years old males with <b>androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia.</b>|$|E
50|$|RU-58642 is a nonsteroidal {{antiandrogen}} (NSAA) {{with very}} high affinity and selectivity for the androgen receptor (AR), {{which made it}} among the most potent and efficacious antiandrogens known {{at the time of}} its discovery. It was investigated for topical application for the treatment of <b>androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia</b> (male-pattern baldness), but development did not proceed past initial trial stages, and it is now only used for scientific research into the AR.|$|E
50|$|The ARTAS System is {{a robotic}} {{surgical}} hair transplantation {{system for the}} treatment of <b>androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia,</b> or male pattern baldness, made by the American company Restoration Robotics, Inc.

5000|$|RU-58841 (also {{known as}} PSK-3841 or HMR-3841) is a nonsteroidal {{antiandrogen}} (NSAA) which was previously investigated {{for use as}} a topical treatment for acne, <b>androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia,</b> and hirsutism. The compound is similar in structure to RU-58642 but contains a different side-chain. These compounds are similar in chemical structure to nilutamide, which is related to flutamide, bicalutamide, and enzalutamide.

50|$|The protein encoded by {{this gene}} is a glutathione-independent {{prostaglandin}} D synthase that catalyzes {{the conversion of}} prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) to prostaglandin D2 (PGD2). PGD2 functions as a neuromodulator {{as well as a}} trophic factor in the central nervous system. PGD2 is also involved in smooth muscle contraction/relaxation and is a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation. This gene is preferentially expressed in brain. Studies with transgenic mice over-expressing this gene suggest that this gene may be also involved in the regulation of non-rapid eye movement sleep. Furthermore, PTGDS and its product PGD2 are elevated in the bald-scalp areas of men with male pattern baldness (<b>androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia).</b>|$|E
50|$|Flutamide {{has been}} {{researched}} and used extensively {{in the treatment of}} hyperandrogenism (e.g., in polycystic ovary syndrome) in women and is highly effective in controlling symptoms including acne, seborrhea, hirsutism, and <b>androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia.</b> The dosages employed are lower than those used in the treatment of prostate cancer. Although flutamide continues to be used for this indication, its use {{in recent years has been}} limited due to the risk of potentially fatal hepatotoxicity, and it is not recommended as a first-line therapy. The related NSAA bicalutamide has also been found to be highly effective in the treatment of hirsutism in women and has a far lower and only small risk of hepatotoxicity in comparison.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{testosterone}} {{and various}} other AAS, dimethandrolone is not metabolized by 5α-reductase. In addition, the 5α-reduced derivative of dimethandrolone, 5α-dihydrodimethandrolone (5α-DHDMA), possesses only 30 to 40% of the potency of dimethandrolone as an agonist of the AR, indicating that dimethandrolone does not require potentiation by 5α-reductase for its activity as an AAS and that {{even if it were}} a substrate for 5α-reductase, it would not be potentiated in androgenic tissues like the skin and prostate. As such, dimethandrolone and ester prodrugs of it like DMAU are thought to have a reduced risk of androgenic side effects and conditions such as benign prostate hyperplasia, prostate cancer, <b>androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia,</b> and acne relative to testosterone and certain other AAS.|$|E
50|$|BOMT (developmental {{code name}} Ro 7-2340), {{also known as}} 6α-bromo-4-oxa-17α-methyl-5α-androstan-17β-ol-3-one, is a synthetic, steroidal, pure {{antiandrogen}} that was first developed in 1970 and was never marketed for clinical use. It is the 6α-brominated, 4-oxygenated, and 17α-methylated derivative of dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Along with benorterone, cyproterone (and its acetate ester, cyproterone acetate), and flutamide, BOMT was among the earliest antiandrogens to be developed and extensively studied, although it is less well-documented {{in comparison to the}} others. BOMT has been investigated clinically in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, though development for this use did not continue. There was also interest in BOMT for the potential applications of acne, <b>androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia,</b> and possibly prostate cancer, but it was not developed for these indications either.|$|E

50|$|Hair follicles {{form the}} basis of the two primary methods of hair {{transplantation}} in hair restoration, Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT) and Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE). In each of these methods, naturally occurring groupings of one to four hairs, called follicular units, are extracted from the hair restoration patient and then surgically implanted in the balding area of the patient's scalp, known as the recipient area. These follicles are extracted from donor areas of the scalp, or other parts of the body, which are typically resistant to the miniaturization effects of the hormone DHT. It is this miniaturization of the hair shaft that is the primary predictive indicator of <b>androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia,</b> commonly referred to as male pattern baldness or male hair loss. When these DHT-resistant follicles are transplanted to the recipient area, they continue to grow hair in the normal hair cycle, thus providing the hair restoration patient with permanent, naturally-growing hair.|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the studies described in this thesis is to study the psychosocial problems {{of men and women}} with <b>androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia</b> who applied for treatment.

40|$|Abstract: BACKGROUND: <b>Androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia</b> (AGA) is a {{patterned}} {{hair loss}} occurring due to systemic androgen and genetic factors. It {{is the most}} common cause of hair loss in both genders. In recent years, many studies investigating the relation between systemic diseases and <b>androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia</b> presented controversial results. OBJECTIVES: In this study we aimed to investigate the frequency of <b>androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia,</b> the presence of accompanying systemic diseases, the relation between body mass index and <b>androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia</b> severity and the association of hyperandrogenemia signs with <b>androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia</b> in patients who referred to our outpatient clinic. METHODS: Patients who referred to our clinic between October 2013 and May 2014 were included in the study. Diagnosis of <b>androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia</b> was made upon clinical findings. Presence of seborrhea and acne in both genders, and hirsutism in women, were examined. Age, gender, smoking habit and alcohol consumption, age of onset of <b>androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia,</b> family history, accompanying systemic diseases and abnormalities of menstrual cycle were recorded. RESULTS: 954 patients (535 women, 419 men) were included in the study. <b>Androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia</b> prevalence found was 67. 1 % in men and 23. 9 % in women. <b>Androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia</b> prevalence and severity were correlated with age in both genders (p= 0, 0001). Frequency of accompanying systemic diseases were not significantly different between patients with and without <b>androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia</b> (p= 0, 087), except for hypertension, which was significantly more frequent in men with <b>androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia</b> aged between 50 and 59 years. Study limitations: Despite the exclusion of other causes of alopecia, differentiation of Ludwig grade 1 AGA from telogen effluvium based on clinical features alone is difficult. CONCLUSIONS: In our study the rate of <b>androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia</b> was found to be higher than the other studies made in Asian and Caucasian populations...|$|E
40|$|<b>Androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia</b> is hair {{thinning}} due to {{the stimulation}} of hair follicles to androgens. Incidence in men is higher than in women, it is because men have a degree higher 5 ? reductase. This condition can cause both physical and psychological effects to the patient.

40|$|Fulltext embargoed for: 12 months post date of publicationBACKGROUND: Both {{prostate}} cancer and <b>androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia</b> are strongly age-related {{conditions that are}} considered to be androgen dependent, but studies of the relationship between them have yielded inconsistent results. We aimed to assess whether <b>androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia</b> at ages 20 and 40 years are associated with risk of {{prostate cancer}}. METHODS: At a follow-up of the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study, men were asked to assess their hair pattern at ages 20 and 40 years relative to eight categories in showcards. Cases were men notified to the Victorian Cancer Registry with prostate cancer diagnosed between cohort enrollment (1990 - 1994) and follow-up attendance (2003 - 2009). Flexible parametric survival models were used to estimate age-varying HRs and predicted cumulative probabilities of prostate cancer by <b>androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia</b> categories. RESULTS: Of 9, 448 men that attended follow-up and provided data on <b>androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia,</b> we identified 476 prostate cancer cases during a median follow-up of 11 years four months. Cumulative probability of prostate cancer was greater at all ages up to 76 years, for men with vertex versus no <b>androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia</b> at age of 40 years. At age of 76 years, the estimated probabilities converged to 0. 15. Vertex <b>androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia</b> at 40 years was also associated with younger age of diagnosis for prostate cancer cases. CONCLUSIONS: Vertex <b>androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia</b> at age of 40 years might be a marker of increased risk of early-onset prostate cancer. IMPACT: If confirmed, these results suggest that the apparently conflicting findings of previous studies might be explained by failure to adequately model the age-varying nature of the association between <b>androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia</b> and prostate cancer.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Androgenetic</b> <b>{{alopecia}}</b> is {{a common}} form of alopecia with multifactorial etiology. Finasteride and minoxidil are approved by the FDA {{for the treatment of}} <b>androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia.</b> Balding scalp is believed to have relative microvascular insufficiency. Blood vessels in the scalp travel through the intramuscular plane. Intramuscular injection of botulinum toxin relaxes muscles and thereby increases blood flow in balding scalp. We conducted a pilot study to evaluate the efficacy of botulinum toxin in <b>androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia</b> management. Material and Methods: The study was conducted in a tertiary care center. A total of 10 male patients with <b>androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia</b> meeting inclusion criteria of the study were included. In the scalp, 30 sites were injected with 5 U of botulinum toxin in each site. Preprocedure photograph taken and evaluation was done, which was repeated after 24 weeks. Efficacy was assessed by photography and self-assessment scoring was done by patients. Results: Of 10 patients, 8 had good to excellent response on photographic assessment. At the end of 24 weeks, 1 patient showed poor and 1 showed fair response to treatment. As per self-assessment, 7 of 10 patients showed good to excellent response. Two patients had fair response and 1 patient showed poor response to treatment. Conclusion: Botulinum toxin was found to be safe and effective therapy for the management of <b>androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia</b> in this pilot study. Studies with larger sample size and randomized controlled trials are required to establish the role of botulinum toxin in the management of <b>androgenetic</b> <b>alopecia...</b>|$|E
