5|$|Ti Noel {{recalls the}} tales that a fellow slave, Macandal, would regale on the {{plantation}} of their master, Lenormand de Mezy. Macandal would tell tales of magical characters and mythical kingdoms with rivers {{rising in the}} sky. He is said to not only have irresistible qualities that appeal to black women, but also the ability to captivate men. He suffers an accident in which his left hand is caught in machinery, and his arm is dragged in up to the shoulder. Being useless to his owner, he departs for the mountains and discovers many secret herbs, plants, and fungi that appear to have magical qualities. Ti Noel joins Macandal and both learn about the magical attributes of these natural elements. Macandal suggests {{that the time has}} come, and no longer goes to the plantation. After the rain season has passed, Ti Noel meets with him in a cave populated with strange items. Macandal has established contact with surrounding plantations, and gives instructions to ensure the death of cows using secret herbs. The poison spreads, killing livestock by the hundreds as well as Frenchmen, wiping out adults and children. Madame Lenormand de Mezy dies as a result, and the deaths continue with entire families suffering the same fate. At gunpoint, a slave eventually explains that Macandal has superhuman powers and is the Lord of Poison. Death within the plantations returns to normal rates as a result and the Frenchmen return to playing cards and drinking, as months pass with no word of Macandal. Macandal, now with the ability to transform into animal forms, like bird, fish, or insect, visits the plantation to affirm faith in his return. The slaves decide to wait four years for Macandal to complete his metamorphoses and once again become a human. After four years, he returns during a celebration and all present <b>are</b> <b>delighted.</b> The chanting alerts the white men, and preparations are made to capture Macandal. He is captured and tied to a post in order to be lashed and burned in front of massive black crowds, but he escapes, flying overhead, and lands among the crowd. He is again captured and burned, but the slaves are certain that he has been saved by African Gods and return to their plantations, laughing.|$|E

500|$|Destruction Derby was {{published}} by Sega and developed by Perfect Entertainment for the Sega Saturn, {{as part of a}} deal that also brought Wipeout to the console. Due to the limitations of the Saturn, this version lacks transparencies. GameFans Ryan Lockhart estimated that the port was [...] "80% ready" [...] in the magazine's August 1996 issue, and it was released in August 1996.

He is a marvellous player and choosing him in defence is certainly an option but Mikaël Silvestre and John O'Shea should be fit and I have a back four in my mind." [...] The final was United's first since the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final and Ferguson was determined to win: That is too long for us, and we <b>are</b> <b>delighted.</b> We have always looked at the League Cup as an extra to blood young players, but the format now has encouraged teams to have a go. We've played Liverpool once in Cardiff – in the Charity Shield – and lost so I hope this time it will be a different result." ...|$|E
500|$|Alex Garland, {{a long-time}} friend of Ishiguro, asked the author {{for the rights}} to the novel before he had {{finished}} reading it.

He gave the screenplay to two producers, Andrew Macdonald and Allon Reich, and development started at that moment. [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>delighted</b> to be shooting this special project, which Alex Garland first brought to us before the book's publication in 2005."

The movie was made into a dystopian drama. Romanek was glad to get the opportunity to shoot this film: [...] "From the moment I finished [...] the novel, it became my dream to film it. Ishiguro's conception is so daring, so eerie and beautiful. Alex Garland's adaptation is sensitive and precise. The cast is perfect, the crew superb." [...] The Seattle Times observed that the project was [...] "something of a departure" [...] for the novelist, noting that it merges Ishiguro's signature [...] "elegant prose with a decidedly science-fiction theme".|$|E
