40|$|A novel {{method of}} <b>cell</b> <b>immobilization</b> is described. The cell support {{consists}} of ceramic microspheres of approximately 50 - 75 tzm diameter. The spheres are hollow, having a wall thickness of lO- 15 Ixm and one entrance (ca. 20 txm diameter). The walls are porous {{with a mean}} pore size of approximately 90 nm. When a cell suspension (of S. cerevisiae) is passed through a column of such particles, cells are immobilized. Conditions are devised such {{that the overwhelming majority}} of cells are held in the central cavity of the support and not between the particles. Provided turbulence is avoided, the distribution of cells along the column length in the steady state is rather homogeneous. The facts that (a) essentially all particles, regardless of orientation, entrap cells, and (b) nonporous particles also entrap cells with high efficiency, indicate that filtration effects are irrelevant and that heretofore unrecognized hydrodynamic forces are alone responsible for the <b>cell</b> <b>immobilization.</b> <b>Cells</b> can be immobilized to high biomass densities, while the hydrodynamic properties of columns containing such immobilized cells are excellent. We describe an on-line electronic method for the real-time measure-ment of immobilized cellular biomass. Cell growth (so recorded) and metabolism continue to occur in such particles at high rates. Using the glycolytic production of ethanol by S. cerevisiae as a model reaction, volumetric productivities as great as any published are obtained.

40|$|Yeast <b>cell</b> <b>immobilization</b> causes {{changes in}} several {{cellular}} physiological properties, resulting in severely unbalanced flavor profiles of beers produced in immobilized-cell systems. To explore {{the reasons for}} the altered production of flavor-active metabolites, such as volatile esters, the transcription rates of several genes were measured in free and immobilized cells. Expression profiles of the stress-related genes HSP 12 and SSA 3 revealed that <b>cell</b> <b>immobilization</b> exerted certain stresses on the yeast cells, possibly nutrient starvation and osmotic stress. However, yeast cells may also benefit from the protecting effect of the immobilization matrix, since without a protecting matrix, the free cells in the standard free-cell system showed a stronger induction of HSP 12, a general stress marker, compared with the immobilized cells. In accordance with the lower stress gene expression levels, the immobilized cells accumulated trehalose as low as 26 % of that of the standard free cells. The expression level of ATF 1, encoding alcohol acetyl transferase 1, was significantly raised in the immobilized cells, resulting in a twofold increase of iso-amyl acetate formation. The activity of ATF 1 is regulated by the protein kinases Sch 9 p and PKA, involved in stress responses and nutrient-sensing signaling pathways. The particular microenvironment created by <b>cell</b> <b>immobilization</b> thus possibly activates the cAMP/PKA/Sch 9 pathway, resulting in an induction of ATF 1 expression leading to enhanced ester concentrations in the final fermentation product. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Background A {{wide range}} of {{value-added}} products can potentially be produced by bioprocessing hardwood spent sulfite liquors (HSSLs) that are by-products of {{pulp and paper industry}} with a high pentose sugar content. However, besides sugars, HSSLs contain considerable amounts of sulfonated lignin derivatives and acetic acid that inhibit the metabolic activity of most microorganisms. Scheffersomyces stipitis is a yeast with high capacity to ferment the pentose sugar xylose under appropriate microaerophilic conditions but it has limited tolerance to HSSL inhibitors. In the present study, cultivations of suspended and immobilized S. stipitis were compared in terms of growth capacity and by-product formation using rich medium and HSSL to investigate whether the <b>immobilization</b> of <b>cells</b> in calcium alginate beads could be a protection against inhibitors while favoring the presence of microaerophilic conditions.
