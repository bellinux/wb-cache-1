5|$|A {{much larger}} star, however, is massive {{enough to create}} {{temperatures}} and pressures needed to cause the carbon in the core to begin to fuse when the star contracts {{at the end of}} the helium-burning stage.

As a star this massive evolves, it undergoes repeated stages where fusion in the core stops, and the core collapses until the pressure and temperature are sufficient to begin the next stage of fusion, reigniting to halt collapse.|$|E
5|$|Calabozos lies in an {{area between}} thick and thin {{continental}} crust, and its eruptions are probably fed {{from a pool of}} andesitic and rhyolitic magma that sits just under its caldera.

The smooth surface includes <b>a</b> <b>layer</b> of ice, while {{the bottom of the}} ice is theorized to be liquid water. The apparent youth and smoothness of the surface have led to the hypothesis that a water ocean exists beneath it, which could conceivably serve as an abode for extraterrestrial life. Heat energy from tidal flexing ensures that the ocean remains liquid and drives geological activity. Life may exist in Europa's under-ice ocean, perhaps subsisting in an environment similar to Earth's deep-ocean hydrothermal vents or the Antarctic Lake Vostok. Life in such an ocean could possibly be similar to microbial life on Earth in the deep ocean. So far, {{there is no evidence that}} life exists on Europa, but the likely presence of liquid water has spurred calls to send a probe there.|$|E

5|$|A {{team from}} the Keck Observatory in Hawaii {{announced}} in 2006 that it had measured {{the density of the}} binary Jupiter trojan 617 Patroclus as being less than that of water ice (0.8g/cm3), suggesting that the pair, and possibly many other Trojan objects, more closely resemble comets or Kuiper belt objects in composition—water ice with <b>a</b> <b>layer</b> of dust—than they do the main-belt asteroids. Countering this argument, the density of Hektor as determined from its rotational lightcurve (2.480g/cm3) is significantly higher than that of 617 Patroclus.
