He was named full-time to the position in January 2016. In addition to Mularkey and Whisenhunt, The Titans have also been coached by Mike Munchak and Jeff Fisher, who led the Titans to their only Super Bowl appearance in Super Bowl XXXIV following the 1999 season.|$|E

Trestman also hired Andy Bischoff and Michael Sinclair <b>as</b> <b>tight</b> ends and defensive line coaches, respectively; both coaches had worked with Trestman in Montreal. Alouettes offensive coordinator Pat Meyer also joined the Bears as {{offensive line coach}}, along with Purdue defensive coordinator and colleague of Trestman, Tim Tibesar, as linebackers coach.

5|$|The main {{problems}} were {{the pressure of}} time and the desire of the U.S. president for secrecy. The Cambodian monsoon, whose heavy rains would hamper operations, was only two months away. By the order of the president, the State Department did not notify the Cambodian desk at the US Embassy, Saigon, the Phnom Penh embassy, or Lon Nol of the planning. Operational security was <b>as</b> <b>tight</b> as General Abrams could make it. There was to be no prior U.S. logistical build-up in the border regions which might serve as a signal to the communists. U.S. brigade commanders were informed only a week in advance of the offensive, while battalion commanders got only two or three days' notice.|$|E
5|$|The {{script was}} co-written by Nanase Ohkawa and Junichi Fujisaku, who also {{worked on the}} series. According to Fujisaku, the {{narrative}} of The Last Dark focused on Saya both seeking revenge and searching for purpose after discovering she was being used by cruel humans. The process of writing The Last Dark ran parallel to Blood-C, and as Ohkawa was preoccupied with the series, Fujisaku put together a basic story and script draft which he expanded and adjusted based on Shiotani's desires for the movie. When Ohkawa, she and Fujisaku together worked to write and polish the final script. Saya's relationships with others despite her non-human status formed {{a key part of}} the movie's themes. According to Ohkawa, one of her main issues was keeping the storytelling <b>as</b> <b>tight</b> as possible within the movie's planned runtime, meaning that some elements of Saya's backstory needed to be cut. While the series took place in a fictional location, the movie used the real-world location of Tokyo, so Ohkawa took extra care to insert realistic details into the script. She found it difficult accommodating the wishes of both Shiotani and Fujisaku's ideas alongside her own in the script.|$|E

Also, materials with good deformation characteristics are necessary for rolling; these materials include softer (more ductile) metals and exclude brittle materials, such as cast iron. Tolerances are typically ±0.001in. (±0.025mm), but tolerances <b>as</b> <b>tight</b> as ±0.0006in (±0.015mm) are achievable. Surface finishes range from 6 to 32 micro-inches.|$|E

25|$|Forecasters now {{commonly}} {{suggest that}} western Canada's conventional gas production has peaked {{and will continue}} to decline.

25|$|With the NBA {{struggling}} {{financially and}} down to just 8 teams Nationals owner during the 1954–55 season, Danny Biasone suggested the league {{limit the amount of}} time taken for a shot thus speeding up a game that often ended with long periods of teams just holding the ball and playing keep away. Biasone and Nats general manager Leo Ferris calculated a 24-second shot clock would allow at least 30 shots per quarter speeding up the game and increasing scoring. The Shot Clock was an instant success as scoring was up 14 points per game league wide. In the first season of the shot clock the Nats would take first place in the East with a 43–29 record. After a first round bye the Nats would beat the Boston Celtics in 4 games to reach the NBA Finals for the 2nd straight season. In the finals the Nats would get off to a fast start, led by forward Dolph Schayes, taking the first 2 games at home against the Fort Wayne Pistons. However, as the series moved to Fort Wayne the Pistons would spark back to life taking all 3 games to take a 3–2 series lead. Back in Syracuse for Game 6 on the Nats kept Championship hopes alive by beating the Pistons 109–104 to force a 7th game at home. Game 7 would be <b>as</b> <b>tight</b> as the series as George King sank a free throw to give the Nats a 92–91 lead in the final seconds. King would then steal the inbound pass to clinch the NBA Championship for the Nationals.|$|E
25|$|Thursday {{qualifying}} {{was held}} in similar weather conditions to practice, but {{was interrupted by a}} brief shower of rain close {{to the end of the}} session. Alesi carried his form over from free practice, nudging the crash barriers lining the circuit on more than one occasion to set a provisional pole position time of 1:23.754. Berger was also impressive, power-sliding through Casino Square, to the delight of the crowd, on his way to the third-fastest time, although he complained that Alesi had held him up on what he thought would have been his quickest lap of the session. The form of the Ferraris came as something of a surprise, as the 41T2's unique V12 engine configuration theoretically produced less torque than its rivals, a disadvantage on a circuit <b>as</b> <b>tight</b> as Monaco. Alesi said that he believed the results of the session were due to the extreme effort that he and Berger were putting into their driving overcoming any deficiencies with the car. The Ferraris were split by Schumacher, who felt that the rain shower had prevented him from fulfilling his potential, as he did not complete his full quota of 12laps as a result of the track conditions becoming slower. His teammate, Herbert, took provisional sixthplace. Of the Williams drivers, Hill was fourth, but Coulthard admitted that he was still learning the track on his way to 11th, 2.8seconds slower than Alesi's best. Häkkinen continued McLaren's promising form with a provisional fifthplace, but was fined $10,000 for ignoring yellow flags during the season. Blundell was back in eighth after crashing into the barriers in the closing minutes of the session.|$|E

25|$|The singles event {{kicked off}} {{later in the}} day, first {{opposing}} ATP No. 3 Novak Djokovic to seventh seed Juan Martín del Potro. No upset was produced, as Djokovic scored his first career victory at the year-end championships, after losing all his matches at the 2007 edition, and increased his head-to-head against del Potro to 2–0, beating the Argentinian in straight sets. Djokovic had broken early in the first set, and was serving for the set at 5–3, when del Potro broke, and reached 5–5, before Djokovic took back the advantage, to win the set 7–5. In the second set, del Potro broke to lead 2–1, but Djokovic immediately levelled the score to 2–2, breaking again later in the set, and keeping his lead to a 7–5, 6–3 victory, in little less than two hours. In the second Gold Group match of the day, Nikolay Davydenko faced recent Paris Masters champion Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, in their second career meeting. Both players held their serve in the first set, to a tie-break the Russian eventually lost 6–8, on an unforced error, and the second set was just <b>as</b> <b>tight,</b> until Davydenko made one break at 5–4, levelling the match to one-set-all. The Russian broke early in the final set, and was serving for the match at 5–2, when Tsonga started a comeback, taking the match to a crucial tie-break. Davydenko then proved too solid for Tsonga, repeating his own performance from their only previous meeting, in Moscow, where he had won 7–0 in a first set tie break, and scored again a perfect tie-break in Shanghai to win the match 6–7, 6–4, 7–6 {{after more than two}} hours and a half of play.|$|E

500|$|The {{ships of}} the Camäleon class were {{frequently}} [...] during peacetime, <b>as</b> <b>tight</b> Prussian naval budgets in the 1860s prevented an active fleet policy. This was {{in large part}} due to liberal opposition to an expansion and modernization program for the Prussian Army under Albrecht von Roon, the Prussian Ministry of War; the Prussian Landtag refused to pass a budget authorizing the expenses requested by Roon, leading to a constitutional crisis where the army and navy operated without legal budgets. The navy was thus unable to spare funding to operate smaller vessels like the Camäleon class. Indeed, the lack of funds delayed completion of Meteor and Drache considerably. During periods of inactivity, the ships were moved ashore, their copper plating was removed, and ventilation holes were cut into the hulls to prevent deterioration of the wood. The first four ships were laid up after completion, with budgetary shortages preventing Cyclop from even conducting sea trials.|$|E
500|$|Most of the {{arrangements}} were developed through extensive jamming, with Cox's and Miles' playing influencing Hendrix's ideas. [...] According to biographer Keith Shadwick, Cox explained in later interviews, [...] "the process {{was based on}} building up rhythm patterns and that each pattern dictated the shape and character of {{a portion of a}} song in which it appeared". [...] Record producer Alan Douglas witnessed the approach during a jam at the Record Plant and saw it as inefficient. On the other hand, Shadwick feels that it was necessary: [...] "it seemed the only way available, especially as neither Cox nor Miles, in particular, were exactly swift on the musical uptake". [...] Music journalist Charles Shaar Murray noted, [...] "Cox's funky, uncluttered bass style would give Hendrix's new music a more solid, less frenetic underpinning [...] [...] In every way, Cox's function would be to provide the steadiness Hendrix so urgently required". [...] Soft Machine drummer Robert Wyatt described Miles' style as [...] "pleasantly messy... He wasn't <b>as</b> <b>tight</b> as a Stax drummer ... his rolls would clatter about a bit". [...] However, his often described [...] "fatback grooves" [...] lay down a solid rhythmic foundation and the combination of Cox and Miles adds a [...] "heavy, rolling fluidity which brings out a very different dimension in Hendrix's playing".|$|E
500|$|The lack of {{supplies}} had forced the Ottoman commander Gazi Hüseyin Pasha {{to lift the}} siege in early 1649, but it was renewed {{for a short period}} of two months after the arrival of the Ottoman fleet in June. [...] The Ottomans assailed the fortifications, exploding over 70 mines, but the defenders held firm. The Ottomans lost over 1,000 men, and the subsequent withdrawal of 1,500 Janissaries and the lack of any further reinforcements over the course of 1650 left Hüseyin Pasha with little option but to continue maintaining <b>as</b> <b>tight</b> a blockade as possible. The Ottomans strengthened their positions with the construction of three forts in the Canea area, and the arrival of reinforcements in late 1650 allowed them to keep up their tight blockade. Despite the Venetian blockade of the Dardanelles and the political turmoil at the Ottoman court, the Ottoman forces were kept well supplied enough to sustain themselves, although too weak to engage in offensive actions against Candia itself. In 1653, the Ottomans took the island fortress of Selino in Suda Bay, and San Todero, captured a few years previously, was refortified. The Venetian naval successes over the next few years further reduced the offensive ability of the Ottoman army in Crete, but the blockade of Candia continued, and the Ottomans retained possession of their other conquests on the island, until the arrival of a new Ottoman expeditionary force in 1666.|$|E
