40|$|Background: Undesirable {{outcomes}} {{in health care}} are associated with patient harm and substantial excess costs. Coarctation of the aorta (CoA), {{one of the most}} common congenital heart diseases, can be repaired with stenting but requires monitoring and subsequent interventions to detect and treat disease recurrence and aortic wall injuries. <b>Avoidable</b> <b>costs</b> associated with stenting in patients with CoA are unknown. Methods: We developed an economic model to calculate potentially <b>avoidable</b> <b>costs</b> in stenting treatment of CoA in the United Kingdom over 5 years. We calculated baseline costs for the intervention and potentially avoidable complications and follow-up interventions and compared these to the costs in hypothetical scenarios with improved treatment effectiveness and complication rates. Results: Baseline costs were £ 16 688 ($ 25 182) per patient. <b>Avoidable</b> <b>costs</b> ranged from £ 137 ($ 207) per patient in a scenario assuming a 10 % reduction in aortic wall injuries and reinterventions at follow-up, to £ 1627 ($ 2455) in a Best-case scenario with 100 % treatment success and no complications. Overall costs in the Best-case scenario were 90. 2 % of overall costs at Baseline. Reintervention rate at follow-up was identified as most influential lever for overall costs. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed a considerable degree of uncertainty for <b>avoidable</b> <b>costs</b> with widely overlapping 95 % confidence intervals. Conclusions: Significant improvements in the treatment effectiveness and reductions in complication rates are required to realize discernible cost savings. Up to 10 % of total baseline costs could be avoided in the best-case scenario. This highlights the need to pursue patient-specific treatment approaches which promise optimal outcomes...|$|E

The second approach uses an outcome variable to replace its causal factors, and is not acceptable because the association between the outcomes and the causes is untestable.

This analysis includes only certain specific types of acute episodes of care which account for 30 % of the national healthcare expenses. For the values in 2010 through 2012, a polynomial trend line was plotted to find the projected value in these years. This research and analysis calculates savings from 1997 through 2015 will equal a total of $ 376. 32 billion, if a PROMETHEUS Payment system had been implemented. This research also indicates that utilizing a PROMETHEUS Payment Model could potentially increase the quality of health care.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to assess}} the {{economic}} loss associated with clinical (CM) and subclinical (SCM) mastitis under current Swedish farming conditions. Stochastic simulation was used to investigate the impact of mastitis on technical and economic results of a 150 -cow dairy herd. The yearly <b>avoidable</b> <b>cost</b> of mastitis, assuming that the initial incidence (32 and 33 cases of CM and SCM per 100 cow-years, respectively) could be reduced by 50 %, was estimated at € 8 095. This figure corresponded to 5 % of the economic net return for the herd given the initial incidence of mastitis. Expressed as an average per cow/year, the <b>avoidable</b> <b>cost</b> of mastitis was estimated at € 54. The economic loss associated with mastitis could not be reduced by discarding milk with high somatic cell count, because {{this resulted in a}} substantial decrease of the volume of sold milk which was not offset by the increase in milk price. Cases of CM and SCM were on average associated with an average economic loss of € 275 and € 60, respectively. Reduced milk production constituted the major cost component of the economic loss caused by mastitis. The magnitude of yield loss associated with mastitis occurring in different stages of lactation was assessed using mixed linear models. The dataset was collected in a research herd between 1987 and 2004, and consisted of weekly test-day records sampled in 1200 lactations. The most extensive yield loss was estimated when CM developed in early lactation and when SCM (modelled by means of increased somatic cell count) occurred in late lactation. The 305 -day yield loss associated with CM varied between 0 and 705 kg milk in primiparous cows and between 0 and 902 kg milk in multiparous cows, depending on lactation week at onset. Most cases of CM developed {{in the first week of}} lactation and resulted in a yield loss of 578 and 782 kg milk in primiparous and multiparous cows, respectively. Daily yield loss at an SCC of 500 000 cells/ml ranged from 0. 7 to 2. 0 kg milk in primiparous cows and from 1. 1 to 3. 7 kg milk in multiparous cows.

40|$|The {{issue of}} market {{delineation}} {{and power in}} the wholesale electric energy market is explored using three separate approaches: two of these are analyses of spatial pricing data to explore the functional size of the markets, {{and the third is}} a series of experimental tests of the effects of different cost structures and market mechanisms on oligopoly strength in those markets. An equilibrium model of spatial network competition is shown to yield linear relationships between spatial prices. A data set comprising two years of spatial weekly peak and off-peak prices and weather for 6 locations in the Western States Coordinating Council and the Southwest Power Pool is subjected to a pairwise cointegration analysis. The use of dummy variables to account the the flow directions is found to significantly improve model performance. The second analytical technique utilizes the extraction of principal components from a spatial price correlation matrix to identify the extent of natural markets. One year of daily price observations for eleven locations within the WSCC is compiled and eigenvectors are extracted and subjected to oblique rotation, each of which is then interpreted as representing a separate geographic market. The results show that two distinct natural markets, correlated at 84 %, account for over 96 % of the variation in the spatial prices in the WSSC. Together, the findings support the assertion that the wholesale electricity market in the Western U. S. is large and highly competitive. The experimental analysis utilizes a radial three node network in which suppliers located at the outer nodes sell to buyers located at the central node. The parameterization captures the salient characteristics of the existing bulk power markets, and includes cyclical demand, transmission losses, as well as fixed and <b>avoidable</b> fixed <b>costs</b> for all agents. Treatments varied the number of sellers, the <b>avoidable</b> fixed <b>cost</b> structures, and the trading mechanism.
