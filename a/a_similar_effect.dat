5|$|The keto oxygen renders {{mephedrone}} more hydrophilic {{than the}} corresponding methylamphetamines, which {{may account for}} the higher doses required to achieve <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>effect,</b> because mephedrone is less able to cross the blood–brain barrier.|$|E
5|$|Metallic silver, like copper, is an {{antibacterial}} agent, {{which was}} known to the ancients and first scientifically investigated and named the oligodynamic effect by Carl Nägeli. Silver ions damage the metabolism of bacteria even at such low concentrations as 0.01–0.1milligrams per litre; metallic silver has <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>effect</b> due {{to the formation of}} silver oxide. This effect is lost in the presence of sulfur due to the extreme insolubility of silver sulfide.|$|E
5|$|Combined {{hormonal}} contraceptives {{include both}} an estrogen and a progestogen. Estrogen negative {{feedback on the}} anterior pituitary greatly decreases the release of FSH, which makes combined hormonal contraceptives more effective at inhibiting follicular development and preventing ovulation. Estrogen also reduces the incidence of irregular breakthrough bleeding. Several combined hormonal contraceptives—the pill, NuvaRing, and the contraceptive patch—are usually used {{in a way that}} causes regular withdrawal bleeding. In a normal cycle, menstruation occurs when estrogen and progesterone levels drop rapidly. Temporarily discontinuing use of combined hormonal contraceptives (a placebo week, not using patch or ring for a week) has <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>effect</b> of causing the uterine lining to shed. If withdrawal bleeding is not desired, combined hormonal contraceptives may be taken continuously, although this increases the risk of breakthrough bleeding.|$|E

5|$|Continuously {{variable}} phase control circuits {{are common in}} subwoofer amplifiers, and {{may be found in}} crossovers and as do-it-yourself electronics projects. Phase controls allow the listener to change the arrival time of the subwoofer sound waves relative to the same frequencies from the main speakers (i.e., at and around the crossover point to the subwoofer). <b>A</b> <b>similar</b> <b>effect</b> can be achieved with the delay control on many home theater receivers. The subwoofer phase control found on many subwoofer amplifiers is actually a polarity inversion switch. It allows users to reverse the polarity of the subwoofer relative to the audio signal it is being given. This type of control allows the subwoofer to either be in phase with the source signal, or 180 degrees out of phase.|$|E

5|$|Tet had <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>effect</b> on Australian public opinion, {{and caused}} growing {{uncertainty}} in the government about {{the determination of the}} United States to remain militarily involved in Southeast Asia. Amid the initial shock, Prime Minister John Gorton unexpectedly declared that Australia would not increase its military commitment in Vietnam beyond the current level of 8,000 personnel. The war continued without respite however, and between May and June 1968 1 ATF was again deployed away from Phuoc Tuy in response to intelligence reports of another impending offensive. The Australians subsequently took up positions north-east of Saigon during Operation Toan Thang I to interdict communist lines of communication, fighting a series of significant actions over a 26-day period that became known as the Battle of Coral–Balmoral.|$|E
5|$|The {{differences}} in reduction potentials is attributed in the cobaltocenium {{system to the}} inductive effect of the alkyl groups, further stabilising the 18-valence electron species. <b>A</b> <b>similar</b> <b>effect</b> {{is seen in the}} rhodocenium data shown above, again consistent with inductive effects. In the substituted iridocenium system, cyclic voltammetry investigations shows irreversible reductions at temperatures as low as −60°C; by comparison, the reduction of the corresponding rhodocenes is quasi-reversible at room temperature and fully reversible at −35°C. The irreversibility of the substituted iridocenium reductions is attributed to the extremely rapid dimerisation of the resulting 19-valence electron species, which further illustrates that iridocenes are less stable than their corresponding rhodocenes.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} development which reduced Gill Sans' dominance was {{the arrival}} of phototypesetting, which allowed typefaces to be printed from photographs on film and (especially in display use – hot metal continued for some body text setting for longer) massively increased the range of typefaces that could cheaply be used. Dry transfers like Letraset had <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>effect</b> for smaller projects; their sans-serif Compacta and Stephenson Blake's Impact exemplified the design trends of the period by choosing dense, industrial designs. Of the period from the 1930s to 1950s, {{when he was growing}} up, James Mosley would later write: The Monotype classics dominated the typographical landscape... in Britain, at any rate, they were so ubiquitous that, while their excellent quality was undeniable, it was possible to be bored by them and to begin to rebel against the bland good taste that they represented. In fact we were already aware by 1960 that they might not be around to bore us for too long. The death of metal type... seemed at last to be happening.|$|E

5|$|Another {{parasite}} is the nematode Beddingia (Deladenus) siricidicola, {{which was}} {{suggested in the}} New World in the 1970s as a possible biological control. B. siricidicola causes infertility in female wasps, but does not impair the fertility of males. Inside the host tree, the nematodes primarily feed on fungal mycelium. If they get near the wasp larvae, they infect females, which then couple with males and finally infest the wasp larvae. These eventually exit the tree carrying the nematodes with them. Competition for food between B. siricidicola and the wasp larvae also occurs, resulting in slower growth and possible starvation of the woodwasp larvae. The population of the Sirex woodwasp is very prone to infestation by B. siricidicola; infestation rates of up to 90% have been recorded. The nematodes are often used to combat the wasps by combining them with the symbiosis partner Amylostereum. The related species B. wilsoni has <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>effect,</b> but as it also lives parasitically with the genus Rhyssa, it is not used for pest control.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} {{are among the}} most {{electropositive}} elements on the periodic table and thus tend to bond ionically to the most electronegative elements on the periodic table, the halogens (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, and astatine), forming salts known as the alkali metal halides. The reaction is very vigorous and can sometimes result in explosions. All twenty stable alkali metal halides are known; the unstable ones are not known, with the exception of sodium astatide, because of the great instability and rarity of astatine and francium. The most well-known of the twenty is certainly sodium chloride, otherwise known as common salt. All of the stable alkali metal halides have the formula MX where M is an alkali metal and X is a halogen. They are all white ionic crystalline solids that have high melting points. All the alkali metal halides are soluble in water except for lithium fluoride (LiF), which is insoluble in water due to its very high lattice enthalpy. The high lattice enthalpy of lithium fluoride is due to the small sizes of the Li+ and F− ions, causing the electrostatic interactions between them to be strong: <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>effect</b> occurs for magnesium fluoride, consistent with the diagonal relationship between lithium and magnesium.|$|E
5|$|The {{electrons}} in the 4f-subshell, which is progressively filled from cerium (element 58) to ytterbium (element 70), {{are not particularly}} effective at shielding the increasing nuclear charge from the sub-shells further out. The elements immediately following the lanthanides have atomic radii that are smaller than would be expected and that are almost identical to the atomic radii of the elements immediately above them. Hence hafnium has virtually the same atomic radius (and chemistry) as zirconium, and tantalum has an atomic radius similar to niobium, and so forth. This {{is known as the}} lanthanide contraction. The effect of the lanthanide contraction is noticeable up to platinum (element 78), after which it is masked by a relativistic effect known as the inert pair effect. The d-block contraction, which is <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>effect</b> between the d-block and p-block, is less pronounced than the lanthanide contraction but arises from a similar cause.|$|E

5|$|The major {{effect of}} the apolipoprotein A5 gene (and its variants) is on plasma {{triglyceride}} levels. Minor alleles (C1131 and Trp19) are primarily associated with the elevation of plasma triglyceride levels. The most extensive information available has been drawn from Caucasian populations, particularly {{in relation to the}} rs662799 SNP. Here, one minor allele is associated with an approximate 0,25mmol/L increase of plasma TG levels. <b>A</b> <b>similar</b> <b>effect</b> is associated with the Trp19 allele, even though it has not been confirmed by a huge number of studies. Original studies have further described that the strongest effect of APOA5 polymorphisms on plasma TG levels is observed among Hispanics, with only minor effects detected among Africans. Among Asians, the effect on plasma TG levels is similar that found among Caucasians. Generally, studies have suggested significant interethnic differences and in some cases sex-dependent associations as well.|$|E
5|$|At the {{strategic}} level the general uprising never eventuated, and in late-February the communist offensive collapsed after suffering more than 45,000 killed, against South Vietnamese and allied losses of 6,000 men. Regardless, {{it proved to}} be {{a turning point in the}} war and although it had been a tactical disaster for the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong, Hanoi emerged with a significant political victory as confidence in the American military and political leadership collapsed, as did public support for the war in the United States. Prior to Tet, American commanders and politicians had talked confidently about winning the war, arguing that General William Westmoreland's strategy of attrition had reached the point where the communists were losing soldiers and equipment faster than they could be replaced. Yet the scale of the offensive, and the surprise and violence with which it had been launched, had shocked the American public and contradicted such predictions of imminent victory; in its wake President Lyndon Johnson announced that he would no longer seek a second term in office. Tet had <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>effect</b> on Australian public opinion, and caused growing uncertainty in the government about the determination of the United States to remain militarily involved in Southeast Asia. Amid the initial shock, Prime Minister John Gorton unexpectedly declared that Australia would not increase its military commitment in Vietnam beyond the current level of 8,000 personnel.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1914 around 53,000 volunteers {{had been}} accepted, {{allowing}} a second contingent to depart in December. Meanwhile, reinforcements were sent {{at a rate of}} 3,200 men per month. The landing at Anzac Cove subsequently resulted in a significant increase in enlistments, with 36,575 men being recruited in July 1915. Although this level was never again reached, enlistments remained high in late 1915 and early 1916. From then a gradual decline occurred, and whereas news from Gallipoli had increased recruitment, the fighting at Fromelles and Pozieres did not have <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>effect,</b> with monthly totals dropping from 10,656 in May 1916 to around 6,000 between June and August. Significant losses in mid-1916, coupled with the failure of the volunteer system to provide sufficient replacements, resulted in the first referendum on conscription, which was defeated by a narrow margin. Although there was an increase in enlistments in September (9,325) and October (11,520), in December they fell to the lowest total of the year (2,617). Enlistments in 1917 never exceeded 4,989 (in March). Heavy losses at Passchendaele resulted in a second referendum on conscription, which was defeated by an even greater margin. Recruitment continued to decline, reaching a low in December (2,247). Monthly intakes fell further in early 1918, but peaked in May (4,888) and remained relatively steady albeit reduced from previous periods, before slightly increasing in October (3,619) prior to the armistice in November.|$|E
