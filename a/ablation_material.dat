40|$|Near an {{electric}} arc some polymers {{can change the}} properties of an arcing medium in a beneficial manner. Such polymers, known as <b>ablation</b> <b>material,</b> decompose and evaporate when exposed to heat from {{an electric}} arc. The evaporated polymer improves current interruption capability by increased pressure and heat dissipation. The target is to use arc quenching properties of <b>ablation</b> <b>material</b> {{to reduce the size}} of load break switches (LBSs) that interrupts current in atmospheric air. Consequently, the air insulated LBSs can be more competitive to more compact SF 6 insulated breakers. The present thesis is an experimental study of polypropylene (PP) as <b>ablation</b> <b>material.</b> Experiments are performed in a medium-voltage (MV) laboratory to determine the interruption limits with regards to current level and shape of transient recovery voltage (TRV). Little has earlier been published in this field of study so the design of the test switch is developed through experimental work. The test switch interrupts the thermal part of the current interruption for all tested currents, up to 800 A. Even for hard TRVs the switch interrupted the thermal part to an impressive degree. The dielectric strength in the arcing zone after the thermal phase is however a larger challenge. For a current of 800 A, the test switch struggles to withstand a recovery voltage higher than 6 kV the first 300 &# 181;s after current zero (CZ) crossing. The ablation effect is more or less self-regulated since the arc intensity is directly related to current magnitude. Experiments indicate that the test switch struggles with low currents since the heat becomes too low. However, the thermal part is still interrupted for a current of 80 A, but recovery voltages above 2 kV the first 200 &# 181;s after CZ crossing &# 181;s is likely to cause a re-ignition. </p...|$|E

40|$|Load break {{switches}} (LBSs) {{are common}} inside {{metal clad switchgear}} assemblies where space is a limiting factor. SF 6 is usually used in this application due to its superior electrical characteristics, but is unfortunately also a strong greenhouse gas. Therefore development of new products, utilizing air which is an environmental friendly alternative, is in progress. Since air has much lower dielectric strength than SF 6, the main challenge with this is therefore to reduce the size. Compact SF 6 products have created a retrofit market, and in many existing installation sites larger products will not fit. Current interruption is a complex process and depends on several parameters, {{and it is not}} straight forward to optimize the design of a medium voltage (MV) switch. Numerical simulation which is a common for product development in other areas is difficult for this application. Due to the long dominance of SF 6 products, little research has been published about the design criteria for LBS technology in air. The scope of the thesis covers current interruption of MV LBSs in air with respect to various design parameters, such as nozzle geometry, nozzle materials, gas flow, and contact movement. Both gas blow-assisted current interruption (associated with puffer breakers) and ablation-assisted current interruption are addressed. The material in the nozzle can enhance the interruption capability. Such a nozzle material is called <b>ablation</b> <b>material.</b> When the arc is burning close to the surface of an <b>ablation</b> <b>material,</b> gas is evaporated which cools the arc. This technology is used to some extent for low voltage switchgear, but much less for higher voltages. The objective is therefore to investigate the potential of this technology for the MV LBS application. All work is done experimentally with similar test conditions as are used for product type testing. A direct powered MV laboratory and a test switch are built. The test switch is designed particularly for parameter studies. The result from air blow experiments reveal the minimum upstream pressure drop required for current interruption for various basic nozzle geometries, and at different contact positions. One study is particular relevant for the 24 kV / 630 A class, and it is found that 0. 25 - 0. 3 bar upstream pressure drop appears to be a threshold value for successful interruption. It is also presented how the minimum upstream pressure drop varies for different MV LBS ratings. The results show that the needed pressure drop is approximately proportional, both towards the current and towards the rate of rise of recovery voltage. This investigation is made so that the majority of all MV LBS ratings (7 - 52 kV and up to 900 A) are covered. From the ablation experiments it was found that high content of hydrogen in the <b>ablation</b> <b>material</b> is favorable for enhancing the current interruption capability. In a comparison experiment between different polymers, polypropylene shows best interruption capability. This material was therefor applied as <b>ablation</b> <b>material</b> in the test switch, and tested in the MV laboratory. The results reveal high capability to interrupt the thermal phase (over the needs for most MV LBSs), but also that the transient recovery voltage several milliseconds after current zero often leads to dielectric re-ignition. This is opposite to a puffer breaker where the thermal interruption instead appears to be the crucial part. PhD i elkraftteknikkPhD in Electric Power Engineerin...|$|E
