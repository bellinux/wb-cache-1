During the second one, nearly {{ten percent of}} the more than 4,000 victims died, including the city's mayor. In the absence of scientific knowledge concerning the cause of yellow fever, nearly half of the city's panicked residents fled despite the imposition of quarantines. Inbound and outbound mail was fumigated in an effort to reduce contagion. Jacksonville's reputation as <b>a</b> <b>healthful</b> tourist destination suffered.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no known}} {{preventive}} measure for type1 diabetes. Type2 diabeteswhich accounts for 85-90% of all casescan often be prevented or delayed by maintaining a normal body weight, engaging in physical activity, and consuming <b>a</b> <b>healthful</b> diet. Higher levels {{of physical activity}} (more than 90 minutes per day) {{reduce the risk of}} diabetes by 28%. Dietary changes known to be effective in helping to prevent diabetes include maintaining a diet rich in whole grains and fiber, and choosing good fats, such as the polyunsaturated fats found in nuts, vegetable oils, and fish. Limiting sugary beverages and eating less red meat and other sources of saturated fat can also help prevent diabetes. Tobacco smoking is also associated with an increased risk of diabetes and its complications, so smoking cessation can be an important preventive measure as well.|$|E

Though the [...] "clammy" [...] aspect of [...] "fever", the excessive ripeness associated with tropical climates, intrude into the poem, these elements, less prominent than in Keats's earlier poetry, are counterbalanced by the dry, crisp autumnal air of rural England. In presenting the particularly English elements of this environment, Keats was also influenced by contemporary poet and essayist Leigh Hunt, who had recently written of the arrival of autumn with its [...] "migration of birds", [...] "finished harvest", [...] "cyder [...] making" [...] and migration of [...] "the swallows", {{as well as by}} English landscape painting and the [...] "pure" [...] English idiom of the poetry of Thomas Chatterton.|$|E

Improvement of these three production variables–improved lean, rate of gain, and feed efficiency–would offer significant economic advantages in swine production. Moreover, consumers would have available <b>a</b> leaner, more <b>healthful</b> meat product because consumption of the product could potentially help prevent obesity, cancer, and heart disease. Coupling both production efficiencies and the consumption of <b>a</b> more <b>healthful</b> meat product would mean significant enhancement economically for the pork industry.
