5|$|Dawson {{remained}} relatively lawful, {{protected by the}} Canadian NWMP, which meant that gambling <b>and</b> <b>prostitution</b> were accepted while robbery and murder were kept low.

The personal use of cannabis was decriminalised in 1992 and abortion was decriminalised in 2002.

5|$|Many {{indigenous}} communities did not evenly {{share in the}} benefits of the economic boom Taiwan experienced during {{the last quarter of the}} 20th century. They often lacked satisfactory educational resources on their reservations, undermining their pursuit of marketable skills. The economic disparity between the village and urban schools resulted in imposing many social barriers on aborigines, which prevent many from moving beyond vocational training. Students transplanted into urban schools face adversity, including isolation, culture shock, and discrimination from their peers. The cultural impact of poverty and economic marginalization has led to an increase in alcoholism <b>and</b> <b>prostitution</b> among aborigines.|$|E

50|$|According to Radio Netherlands, {{prostitution}} {{is concentrated}} {{in and around the}} big cities and in the border towns in the regions of Limburg, Groningen, Twente, West Brabant <b>and</b> Zeeland. <b>Prostitution</b> occurs in various forms: 'window' <b>and</b> street <b>prostitution,</b> clubs, escort agencies <b>and</b> home-based <b>prostitution.</b> 'Window' prostitution occurs in 12 cities in the Netherlands. It is estimated that on average some 2,000 prostitutes are engaged daily in this form of prostitution. Street prostitution exists in 10 Dutch cities and involves on average some 320 prostitutes daily. Between 3,500 and 4,000 prostitutes are employed daily in 600-700 clubs and private brothels. The extent of other forms of prostitution such as escort agencies <b>and</b> home-based <b>prostitution</b> is much more difficult to estimate. Home-based prostitution occurs in at least 17 municipalities and escort agencies exist in at least 28 municipalities.|$|R

5|$|Much of {{this period}} {{represented}} a high point in Galveston's economy. It is {{sometimes referred to as}} the open era or the wide-open era because the business owners and the community made little effort to hide the illegal vice activities. The tourist industry spawned by the illegal businesses helped to offset Galveston's decline as a commercial and shipping center following a devastating hurricane in 1900. However, crackdowns against gambling <b>and</b> <b>prostitution</b> in Texas during the mid-20th century made these businesses increasingly difficult to sustain. By the 1950s, this era of Galveston's history had ended.|$|E

When the two met in a hotel, Nurdin threatened Jamila with a pistol; in self-defence, Jamila killed him with the pistol. In the modern day, Jamila walks towards her execution; the president has not responded to the request for stay. The screen fades to black as a gunshot goes off, and afterwards, statistics about child trafficking <b>and</b> <b>prostitution</b> are shown.|$|E
5|$|The {{end of the}} war {{drastically}} reduced military investment in the island. Increasing enforcement of gambling laws and the growth of Las Vegas, Nevada as a competitive center of gambling and entertainment put pressure on the gaming industry on the island. Finally in 1957, Texas Attorney General Will Wilson and the Texas Rangers began a massive campaign of raids which disrupted gambling <b>and</b> <b>prostitution</b> in the city. As these vice industries crashed, so did tourism, taking the rest of the Galveston economy with it. Neither the economy nor the culture of the city was the same afterward.|$|E

5|$|Another film {{purported to}} have been the highest-grosser is the 1972 pornographic film, Deep Throat. In 1984, Linda Lovelace testified to a United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on {{juvenile}} justice that the film had earned $600 million; this figure {{has been the subject of}} much speculation, since if it is accurate then the film would have made more money than Star Wars, and finished the 1970s as the highest-grossing film. The main argument against this figure is that it simply did not have a wide enough release to sustain the sort of sums that would be required for it to ultimately gross this amount. Exact figures are not known, but testimony in a federal trial in 1976—about four years into the film's release—showed the film had grossed over $25 million. Roger Ebert has reasoned it possibly did earn as much as $600 million on paper, since mobsters owned most of the adult movie theaters during this period and would launder income from drugs <b>and</b> <b>prostitution</b> through them, so probably inflated the box office receipts for the film.|$|E
5|$|Another {{indirect}} {{effect of the}} boom was the growth of gambling <b>and</b> <b>prostitution</b> in many communities. These activities had not been uncommon in Texas before the boom, but the wealth brought by the oil industry, as well as difficulties in enhancing the laws and the law enforcement agencies, created many new opportunities for illegal businesses and organized crime. Many communities developed casino and red-light districts; notably the gaming empire in Galveston, which attracted wealthy businessmen from Houston and lasted into the 1950s, was the longest lasting of all of these. Prostitution, which had always been present in the state, flourished in the boom towns, which were crowded with single men earning relatively high wages. The onset of Prohibition and the state government's reluctance to enforce vice laws only encouraged the growth of gambling and bootlegging during this period.|$|E
5|$|Into Temptation {{is also a}} {{story of}} {{redemption}}, both for Linda, who is seeking redemption {{for a life of}} sin <b>and</b> <b>prostitution,</b> and for Father John, who is seeking redemption for his failure to help Linda and his own doubts about religion and priesthood. At the start of the film, Father John appears to be questioning his duty to the church and its dwindling congregation; this is especially demonstrated when he appears bored during confession and does crossword puzzles to pass the time. Such struggles are not uncommon in priesthood. But after he resists the church boundaries and attempts to help Linda, his faith in the congregation and belief in the profession are restored, and he returns to the church a stronger and more content priest. The film demonstrates the power of compassion and individual kindness, particularly in the way that John's simple act of defending Linda during her childhood was such a profound moment in her life. The film also advocates repentance, and the extent of Linda's victimization can be interpreted as a sign of how catastrophic an unrepentant life can be.|$|E
40|$|The {{paper is}} an attempt to explore and defend African ethico-feminism as a viable {{complementary}} ideology for curbing the challenges of <b>prostitution</b> <b>and</b> female trafficking in 21 st century Africa. It argues that African ethico-feminism is a new conception of feminism necessarily relevant to the African predicament on <b>prostitution</b> <b>and</b> female trafficking. This ideological perspective strongly condemns <b>prostitution</b> <b>and</b> female trafficking as ethically unjustified. The paper posits that the strength, resilience and resounding liberation of African women can be positively harnessed and enhanced {{in order to reduce the}} spate of <b>prostitution</b> <b>and</b> female trafficking in the continent. It identifies the roles of men and youth in Africa towards curbing <b>prostitution</b> <b>and</b> female trafficking. Finally, the paper harps on the urgent need for African states to augment the principles of ethico-feminism with other viable measures in an attempt to evolve a holistic panacea to the wave of <b>prostitution</b> <b>and</b> female trafficking in Africa...|$|R
