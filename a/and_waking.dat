40|$|To {{determine}} if bed <b>and</b> <b>wake</b> times {{can be determined}} from continuous ECG recordings in the elderly, PSG (polysomnogram), ECG channels were extracted and scanned on a Holter analyzer for N= 56 participants (age 76 ± 3) in the Sleep Heart Health Study who had 2 PSGs 5 years apart. Bed <b>and</b> <b>wake</b> times were determined {{from a combination of}} 5 -min averagaed HR and HRV patterns and from HR tachograms of normal-to-normal intervals. Bed <b>and</b> <b>wake</b> times were also extracted from the PSGs. PSG- and HRV bed <b>and</b> <b>wake</b> times were compared via paired t-tests and correlation analysis. Correlations between PSG- and HRV-determined bed <b>and</b> <b>wake</b> times were 0. 95. HRV-derived bed <b>and</b> <b>wake</b> times were slightly (4 ± 7 min) earlier for and 5 ± 11 min earlier the 2 PSGs, p 0. 001. Mean PSG <b>and</b> ECG-based <b>wake</b> times were closer (12 ± 20 s earlier, p= 0. 069 and 2 ± 8 min later, p= 0. 049 for the 2 PSGs). Therefore, determination of bedtime <b>and</b> <b>wake</b> time patterns in large Holter cohorts without activity diaries is feasible. 1...|$|R
40|$|Actigraphy is {{effective}} at monitoring circadian rhythms, but often misidentifies periods of restless sleep (defined here as sleep periods with movement) as <b>wake,</b> <b>and</b> periods of quiet wake as sleep. This limitation restricts {{the effectiveness of}} actigraphy for investigating sleep disorders. Our objective {{in this study was}} to investigate a time-frequency representation of movement during sleep <b>and</b> <b>wake</b> which could ultimately aid in improving classification performance by reducing false wake detections. As a pilot study, we investigate the characteristics of manually labelled movements from six patients (aged 6 - 12 years, 3 male) during sleep <b>and</b> <b>wake</b> using the over complete discrete wavelet decomposition. The difference between the median wavelet coefficients were analyzed for 30 movement segments from six movement categories during sleep <b>and</b> <b>wake.</b> We found that, in general, the temporal location of high energy coefficients and the energy of the high frequency bands differed between movements during sleep <b>and</b> <b>wake.</b> This indicates that we are able to differentiate movement during sleep <b>and</b> <b>wake</b> with a time-frequency representation. This representation may improve the sleep <b>and</b> <b>wake</b> classification performance by identifying movements specific to sleep <b>and</b> <b>wake.</b> This will likely improve the poor specificity inherent in conventional actigraphy...|$|R

25|$|Generally speaking, {{the longer}} an {{organism}} is awake, {{the more it}} feels a need to sleep ("sleep debt"). This driver of sleep {{is referred to as}} Process S.

25|$|This {{could explain}} why the REM <b>and</b> <b>waking</b> stages of sleep overlap during sleep paralysis, and {{definitely}} explains the muscle paralysis experienced on awakening. If the effects of sleep on neural populations cannot be counteracted, characteristics of REM sleep are retained upon awakening. Common consequences of sleep paralysis includes headaches, muscle pains or weakness and/or paranoia. As the correlation with REM sleep suggests, the paralysis is not complete: use of EOG traces shows that eye movement is still possible during such episodes; however, the individual experiencing sleep paralysis is unable to speak.|$|E
25|$|Body {{temperature}} {{is not well}} regulated during REM sleep, and thus organisms become more sensitive to temperatures outside their thermoneutral zone. Cats and other small furry mammals will shiver and breathe faster to regulate temperature during NREMS but not during REMS. With the loss of muscle tone, animals lose the ability to regulate temperature through body movement. (However, even cats with pontine lesions preventing muscle atonia during REM did not regulate their temperature by shivering.) Neurons which typically activate in response to cold temperatures—triggers for neural thermoregulation—simply do not fire during REM sleep, {{as they do in}} NREM sleep <b>and</b> <b>waking.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{pathophysiology}} {{of sleep}} paralysis {{has not been}} concretely identified, although there are several theories about its cause. The first of these stems from the understanding that sleep paralysis is a parasomnia resulting from dysfunctional overlap of the REM <b>and</b> <b>waking</b> stages of sleep. Polysomnographic studies found that individuals who experience sleep paralysis have shorter REM sleep latencies than normal along with shortened NREM and REM sleep cycles, and fragmentation of REM sleep. This study supports the observation that disturbance of regular sleeping patterns can instigate an episode of sleep paralysis, because fragmentation of REM sleep commonly occurs when sleep patterns are disrupted and has now been seen in combination with sleep paralysis.|$|E

25|$|In {{line with}} the {{salience}} hypothesis, there is considerable evidence {{that people who have}} more vivid, intense or unusual dreams show better recall. There is evidence that continuity of consciousness is related to recall. Specifically, people who have vivid and unusual experiences during the day tend to have more memorable dream content and hence better dream recall. People who score high on measures of personality traits associated with creativity, imagination, and fantasy, such as openness to experience, daydreaming, fantasy proneness, absorption, and hypnotic susceptibility, tend to show more frequent dream recall. There is also evidence for continuity between the bizarre aspects of dreaming <b>and</b> <b>waking</b> experience. That is, people who report more bizarre experiences during the day, such as people high in schizotypy (psychosis proneness) have more frequent dream recall and also report more frequent nightmares.|$|E

25|$|Rapid eye {{movement}} sleep (REM) has since its discovery been {{closely associated with}} dreaming. Waking up sleepers during a REM phase is a common experimental method for obtaining dream reports; 80% of neurotypical people can give some kind of dream report under these circumstances. Sleepers awakened from REM tend to give longer more narrative descriptions of the dreams they were experiencing, and to estimate the duration of their dreams as longer. Lucid dreams are reported far more often in REM sleep. (In fact these {{could be considered a}} hybrid state combining essential elements of REM sleep <b>and</b> <b>waking</b> consciousness.) The mental events which occur during REM most commonly have dream hallmarks including narrative structure, convincingness (experiential resemblance to waking life), and incorporation of instinctual themes. Sometimes they include elements of the dreamer's recent experience taken directly from episodic memory. By one estimate, 80% of dreams occur during REM.|$|E
25|$|Xbox One {{consoles}} {{ship with}} {{an updated version}} of Kinect; the new Kinect uses a wide-angle time-of-flight camera, and processes 2 gigabits of data per second to read its environment. The new Kinect has greater accuracy with three times the fidelity over its predecessor and can track without visible light by using an active IR sensor. It has a 60% wider field of vision that can detect a user up to 3 feet from the sensor, compared to six feet for the original Kinect, and can track up to 6 skeletons at once. It can also detect a player's heart rate, facial expression, the position and orientation of 25 individual joints (including thumbs), the weight put on each limb, speed of player movements, and track gestures performed with a standard controller. The color camera captures 1080p video that can be displayed in the same resolution as the viewing screen, allowing for a broad range of scenarios. In addition to improving video communications and video analytics applications, this provides a stable input on which to build interactive applications. Kinect's microphone is used to provide voice commands for actions such as navigation, starting games, <b>and</b> <b>waking</b> the console from sleep mode.|$|E

RTÉ One's other daytime imports are made up of soap operas (such as the Australian soaps Neighbours and Home and Away, the New Zealand soap Shortland Street, the British soaps Doctors and EastEnders), American detective dramas (including the highly repeatable Murder, She Wrote) and since 2001 they have broadcast American daytime chat shows (including The Doctors and Doctor Phil, they also broadcast Oprah but that is now shown on TV3). American dramas broadcast from 2000 to 2009 included ER, The Practice, Damages, Shark, Angel, Two and a Half Men, Medium, Mad Men, and The West Wing. British dramas Spooks <b>and</b> <b>Waking</b> the Dead have also aired on the Channel.
