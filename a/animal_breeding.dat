5|$|The American {{biologist}} Sewall Wright, who had {{a background}} in <b>animal</b> <b>breeding</b> experiments, focused on combinations of interacting genes, {{and the effects of}} inbreeding on small, relatively isolated populations that exhibited genetic drift. In 1932, Wright introduced the concept of an adaptive landscape and argued that genetic drift and inbreeding could drive a small, isolated sub-population away from an adaptive peak, allowing natural selection to drive it towards different adaptive peaks. The work of Fisher, Haldane and Wright founded the discipline of population genetics. This integrated natural selection with Mendelian genetics, which was the critical first step in developing a unified theory of how evolution worked.|$|E

It created insurance companies like Swiss RE, Swiss Life, Rentenanstalt and Schweiz. Credit Suisse had its first unprofitable year in 1886, due to losses in agriculture, venture investments, commodities and international trade.

5|$|Workers in Cairns had {{restored}} {{power and}} water supplies {{within a few}} days of Joy's passage. After the initial flooding from Joy ended, there was additional rainfall in February1991 that caused flooding across the region. Residual flooding cost the coal industry about 60million due to loss of production and hindered exporting. While Rockhampton was still isolated by flooding, a helicopter airdropped food to hundreds of stranded families, after the town experienced food and water shortages. Transportation to Rockhampton was not normalised until 20January, when the airport and incoming roads were reopened. The city of Rockhampton later created a flood plain management policy {{as a result of the}} effects from Joy. The floods helped fill the drainage basin of the Peter Faust Dam within a few weeks, speeding up a process which would have otherwise taken several years. Months after the storm, the Queensland National Parks and Wildlife Service collected reports on environmental impacts from the flooding; they included some beneficial aspects such as new locations for <b>animal</b> <b>breeding,</b> and alleviation of drought conditions. The Queensland government upgraded a portion of the Bruce Highway near Rockhampton to reduce flooding in similar storms.|$|E
5|$|Merchants {{engaged in}} a {{multitude}} of private trades and industries. A single merchant often combined several trades to make greater profits, such as <b>animal</b> <b>breeding,</b> farming, manufacturing, trade, and money-lending. Some of the most profitable commodities sold during the Han were salt and iron, since a wealthy salt or iron distributor could own properties {{worth as much as}} ten million cash. In the early Western Han period, powerful merchants could muster a workforce of over a thousand peasants to work in salt mines and marshes to evaporate brine to make salt, or at ironworks sites where they operated bellows and casted iron implements. To curb the influence of such wealthy industrialists, Emperor Wu nationalized these industries by 117 BCE {{and for the first time}} drafted former merchants with technical know-how such as Sang Hongyang (d. 80 BCE) to head these government monopolies. However, by the Eastern Han period the central government abolished the state monopolies on salt and iron. Even before this, the state must have halted its employment of former merchants in the government salt and iron agencies, since an edict of 7 BCE restated the ban on merchants entering the bureaucracy. However, the usurper Wang Mang (r. 923 CE) did employ some merchants as low-level officials with a salary-rank of 600 bushels. Another profitable industry was brewing wine and liquor, which the state briefly monopolized from 98 to 81 BCE, yet relinquished its production to private merchants once again (with alcohol taxes reinstalled). The official Cui Shi (催寔) (d. 170 CE) started a brewery business to help pay for his father's costly funeral, an act which was heavily criticized by his fellow gentrymen who considered this sideline occupation a shameful one for any scholar. Cinnabar mining was also a very lucrative industry.|$|E

Rural <b>animal</b> <b>breeding</b> was characterised by economic efficiency.

Poultry and egg production for the markets also flourished. <b>Animal</b> <b>breeding</b> was gradually replaced by extensive growing of corn, which became {{the basis of the}} town’s economy and employed large numbers of workers.|$|E
50|$|The inverse process, wherein small <b>animals</b> <b>breeding</b> on {{isolated}} islands {{lacking the}} predators of large land masses may become {{much larger than}} normal, is called island gigantism.

25|$|At {{the end of}} the 18th century, <b>animal</b> <b>breeding</b> {{started to}} decline in {{economic}} importance, as the fields had become overgrazed and denuded. It took nearly 100 years before the region developed its next major agricultural commodity. In the 19th century, Kecskemét was already part of an important wine district, but the city increased in importance after the vine-pest destroyed most vineyards in the hilly regions. Damage was less significant in the plains' areas of loose, sandy soil. In the 1870s, landowners planted large plantations of grapevines around the town. These were the basis of the 20th-century vineyards and wine industry of the 20th century in Kecskemét. Cottage-type settlements grew up at the vineyards to house workers, a pattern still characteristic of the rural areas around the town. The growth of the wine industry stimulated those of the food industry and trade. The city is still known for its barackpálinka, an apricot brandy.|$|E
25|$|The agro-food {{industry}} {{is one of}} the main pillars of industry of Campania. The organisation of the sector is improving and leading to higher levels of quality and salaries. Campania mainly produces fruit and vegetables, but has also expanded its production of flowers grown in greenhouses, becoming one of the leading regions of the sector in Italy. The value added of this sector represents around 6.5% of the total value added of the region, equalling €213.7 million. Campania produces over 50% of Italy's nuts and is also the leader in the production of tomatoes, which reaches 1.5 million tonnes a year. A weak point, however, for the region's agriculture is the very reduced size of farms, equal to 3.53 hectares. <b>Animal</b> <b>breeding</b> is widespread (it was done in 70,278 farms in 2000) and the milk produced is used to process typical products, such as mozzarella. Olive trees cover over 74,604 hectares of the agricultural land and contribute by €620.6 million to the value added of agriculture, together with the production of fruit. Wine production has increased, together with the quality of the wine.|$|E

500|$|Darwin was {{intrigued}} by his half-cousin Francis Galton's argument, introduced in 1865, that statistical analysis of heredity showed that moral and mental human traits could be inherited, and principles of <b>animal</b> <b>breeding</b> could apply to humans.

When Galton suggested that publishing research could encourage intermarriage within a [...] "caste" [...] of [...] "those who are naturally gifted", Darwin foresaw practical difficulties, and thought it [...] "the sole feasible, yet I fear utopian, plan of procedure in improving the human race", preferring to simply publicise the importance of inheritance and leave decisions to individuals.

I feel happiest when I am with these birds and animals," [...] he said, [...] "I am a part of them without anything to explain." [...] His understanding of the dynamics of purebred <b>animal</b> <b>breeding</b> was that deviation from the original, useful type led to degeneration of a breed. While best known as a horse breeder, he also raised pheasants—including exotic varieties from the Himalayas—and other breeds of birds. By 1905 he started a pheasant farm on his property in Morris Plains, gathering the birds he had kept on the west coast, and buying others from overseas using the profits from his first published book of cartoons. [...] As of 1908 he owned the largest private collection of pheasants and wild waterfowl in America. At various times, his menagerie also contained angora goats, Persian fat-tailed sheep, Sicilian donkeys, and Chinese ducks. [...] Three times, he built up collections of cockfighting roosters, once selling them to finance his start the first time he lived and worked in San Francisco.|$|E

[...] He was a lifelong lover of animals and of country living; he not only raised horses, but also exotic poultry and other animals.
