50|$|Cast Glance is a gyro-stabilized optical {{instrument}} in {{use by the}} United States Navy. It is an <b>airborne</b> <b>system</b> {{that is used by}} Air Test and Evaluation Squadron 30 (VX-30) on board the Lockheed NP-3D Orion. The system consists of a moving gyro-stabilised mirror with fixed optics, two fixed cameras and five sensors. The cameras look out of the starboard side of the aircraft. The system is photometric and enables the simultaneous recording of the electro-optical to the infrared spectrum and medium wave IR.|$|E
50|$|During the 1990s {{companies}} such as Applied Signal Technology (AST) developed airborne systems to intercept digital cellular phone calls and text messages for law enforcement and national security purposes.

50|$|The {{use of the}} {{accurate}} Freya and Würzburg radars in their air-defense systems allowed the Germans to have a somewhat less vigorous approach {{to the development of}} airborne radar. Unlike the British, whose inaccurate CH systems demanded some sort of system in the aircraft, the Würzburg was accurate enough to allow them to leave the radar on the ground. This came back to haunt them when the British discovered the mode of operation of the Himmelbett tactic, and the development of an <b>airborne</b> <b>system</b> became much more important.|$|E
5000|$|The Long-Range Biological Standoff Detection System (LR-BSDS) was {{developed}} for the US Army to provide the earliest possible standoff warning of a biological attack. It is an <b>airborne</b> <b>system</b> carried by a helicopter to detect man-made aerosol clouds containing biological and chemical agents at long range. The LR-BSDS, with a detection range of 30 km or more, was fielded in June 1997. [...] Five lidar units produced by the German company Sick AG were used for short range detection on Stanley, the autonomous car that won the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge.|$|E
50|$|Conceptually, two {{adjacent}} mountains (natural or terrain-enabled) or artificial {{buildings or}} towers (urban or artificial) {{could have a}} wind turbine suspended between them by use of cables. When HAWP is cabled between two mountain tops across a valley, the HAWP device is not airborne, but borne up by the cable system. No such systems {{are known to be}} in use, though patents teach these methods. When non-cabled bridges are the foundation for holding wind turbines high above the ground, then these are grouped with conventional towered turbines and are outside the intent of HAWP where the tethering an <b>airborne</b> <b>system</b> is foundational.|$|E

50|$|On-board {{performance}} monitoring and alerting capabilities fulfill two needs, one {{on board the}} aircraft and one within the airspace design. The assurance of <b>airborne</b> <b>system</b> performance is implicit for RNAV operations. Based upon existing airworthiness criteria, RNAV systems are only required to demonstrate intended function and performance using explicit requirements that are broadly interpreted. The result {{is that while the}} nominal RNAV system performance can be very good, it is characterised by the variability of the system functionality and related flight performance. RNP systems provide a means to minimise variability and assure reliable, repeatable and predictable flight operations.|$|E
50|$|This technique, first {{demonstrated}} in the 1970s from an army <b>airborne</b> <b>system,</b> has evolved considerably. At first, it estimated the angle-of-arrival of backscatter power from a pixel on the ground by comparing the phase difference of the backscattered wave as measured at two different locations. This information along with the traditional range and azimuth (Doppler) information allowed one to locate the imaged pixel in three-dimensions, and hence estimate the elevation of that pixel. Elevation-mapping interferometric SAR systems have since become an important remote sensing technology, with a very specific height-mapping mission. Interferometric SAR systems can now be obtained as commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products.|$|E
50|$|Another {{critical}} {{technology is}} the Multi-Mode Radar (MMR). The Ericsson/Ferranti PS-05/A I/J-band multi-function radar was initially intended to be used, as used on Saab's JAS 39 Gripen. However, after examining other radars in the early 1990s, the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) became confident that local development was possible. HAL's Hyderabad division and the LRDE were selected to jointly lead the MMR programme, and work commenced in 1997. The DRDO's Centre for <b>Airborne</b> <b>System</b> (CABS) {{is responsible for the}} MMR's test programme. Between 1996 and 1997, CABS converted the surviving HAL/HS-748M Airborne Surveillance Post (ASP) into a testbed for the LCA's avionics and radar.|$|E

5000|$|Some major {{programs}} in the US Department of Defense, such as the F-35 Vehicle Management System (VMS) are using Model Based System Engineering (MBSE) effectively on highly complex, software intensive and safety-critical <b>airborne</b> <b>system</b> functions, along with Goal Structuring Notation (GSN). Safety Assessments and more elaborate and comprehensive Safety Cases with GSN are effective so long as Refuting Arguments and much scrutiny using traditional hazard analyses and safety approaches are included and models used to depict system behavior. More elaborate models and formal methods are being used for collective safety evidence. In the UK, GSN as part of Safety Cases {{have proven to be}} useful for providing objective safety evidence. A Safety Case is an ideal way to reflect the MBSE model, software use cases, safety architecture, safety critical functional behavior, safe states, and sequencing in the safety domain. Functional behavior is often better understood, expressed and defended when graphically displayed {{every step of the way}} in MBSE vs. traditional development with enormous paperwork that is very difficult to correlate into an effective Safety Case.|$|E
5000|$|The {{workpiece}} travels down {{a conveyor}} belt towards a paint booth, or paint tank, where it is sprayed with, or dipped into, electrostatically charged paint particles. Integrated into a powder paint booth is a powder recovery unit, which recovers between 95% and 100% of the paint over-spray coatings. After the workpiece is coated, it continues on the conveyor belt to an oven, where the paint is cured. The benefits {{to the process of}} electrostatic coating is the ability to recover the little over-spray and having the process automated which will cut costs. The reason for the little over spray is the paint particles that do not hit the piece will turn in the air {{and go back to the}} piece. There are also some drawbacks to the process: everything in the area of the coating must be grounded to prevent static buildup and can easily arc, damaging the hanging devices and/or the locations where the hanging devices rest on the conveyor. All hangers, conveyors, etc. must be cleaned often to ensure a good ground and prevent anyone in the area from getting a severe shock. In an <b>airborne</b> <b>system,</b> any recesses on the piece that is being coated can be missed because the electrostatic paint is more attracted to corners and sharp edges; this means that another process for coating can be a better option if the piece has recesses. In the dipping process, air entrapment can occur in blind holes and deep recesses, so the positioning of the part as it enters the paint tank is critical in removing any trapped air that will restrict paint coverage.|$|E
