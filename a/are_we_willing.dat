5000|$|To {{realize the}} various {{structures}} within one's language and habits, and even within one's {{own life and}} self is a difficult task. But Gebser {{says that it is}} a task that we cannot choose to ignore without losing ourselves. This means that our so-called [...] "objective thinking" [...] is not without consequences, is not innocent. That to live [...] "objectively" [...] means to give life to the horrors of nihilism combined with the know how of highly [...] "efficient" [...] weapons. It means that [...] "objectivity" [...] gets applied to [...] "engineering humanity" [...] whether it is in the behavioral sciences or the physical sciences. He asks of us whether or not we have had our fill of those horrors yet. <b>Are</b> <b>we</b> <b>willing</b> to settle into the comfort of our daily life or to take on the process of change? He offers as a guiding note that just as there is also a time to act, there is also the much neglected time of contemplation. In a world where know-how is overvalued, simple knowing must also be nurtured. Furthermore, he knew that thought was never simply a mental exercise restricted to one's writing. He calls upon us to realize that we are what we think.|$|E

[...] He further wrote that, the video [...] "similarly gazes inwards towards the nation" [...] that results in a visual experience {{that could be seen}} in the visual for Billy Joels 1989 single, [...] "We Didnt Start the Fire". Times Nolan Feeney thought that some of the presented historical moments [...] "challenges readings of the song as a pure ode to the land of opportunity". Quartzs Flanagin disagreed with the critics who thought the video and the song were contradictory. According to him, [...] "The message is clear: the life of the American immigrant is full of contradictions. To embark for the United States, illegally or with visa in hand, as a strawberry-picker or a pop-star, is an endeavor fueled by hope. But new arrivals often face intense social push back." [...] Adam Fleischer of MTV News noted that [...] "those clips span decades, relate to numerous situations and evoke an array of emotions", and eventually agreed with Feeney. Michelle Geslani of Consequence of Sound wrote, [...] "Its a gripping visual that seems to pose the question: How far <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>willing</b> to go to protect this so-called Land of Opportunity?"The video has since been nominated for the Best Video With A Social Message at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards.|$|E

5000|$|In his mostly {{negative}} {{review for}} New York magazine's books section, Sam Anderson struck {{a note of}} disappointment, puzzlement, and confusion. In Anderson's opinion, Point Omega is [...] "latest of a recent stretch of post-Underworld metaphysical anti-thrillers—The Body Artist, Cosmopolis, Falling Man—DeLillo's writing has reached {{a whole new level}} of narrative inertia". For Anderson, the novel's [...] "glacial aesthetic" [...] and seemingly slow moving non-plot of the novel is a major fault: [...] "the closest the book comes to real action is when Elster's daughter shows up—although “shows up” is a strong phrase to use for a character who hardly seems to exist at all. When she disappears, mysteriously — the only major event of the novel — it seems like a formality." [...] The experience of reading a [...] "late-phase DeLillo" [...] novel, according to Anderson, makes him [...] "feel like a late-phase DeLillo character: distant, confused, catatonic, drifting into dream worlds, missing dentist appointments, forgetting the meanings of basic words, and staring at everyday objects as if they were holy relics." [...] However, Anderson admits that [...] "this disorientation might explain why I can’t quite make up my mind about Point Omega", suggesting some positives and elaborating that [...] "the strongest material in Point Omega is only tangentially related to the book’s main story, and is essentially just art criticism" [...] (referring to the bracketing chapters that begin and end the book). Anderson further remarks on the novel's style: [...] "DeLillo is, after Beckett and Robbe-Grillet, the indisputable master of grinding a plot to the brink of stasis and then recording its every last movement. Point Omega seems like a logical endpoint of that quest." [...] But Anderson goes on to ask with some concern, [...] "how much further into the desert of plotlessness is DeLillo willing to go, and how far <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>willing</b> to follow? Where else can he possibly take the novel?" [...] Anderson finally concludes on a negative note: [...] "I get the sense that he wants his oeuvre to culminate in a pure act of attention, and I’m not convinced that the novel is the best medium in which to do that. As a raging DeLillo fan, I’d be more excited to see him branch out to another genre—an experimental autobiography, or essayistic micro-observations of his favorite art and literature—than write another short novel about detached and largely interchangeable characters." ...|$|E

We know that adjuvant therapy benefits patients. The problem is, which patients? <b>Are</b> <b>we</b> <b>willing</b> to forgo treatments that could potentially benefit a particular patient? On the other hand, <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>willing</b> to treat all patients with an excellent prognosis to benefit just 1 %, 2 %, 3 %, or maybe 5 % of patients? These benefits must ultimately be balanced against the toxicities of adjuvant chemotherapy, which include both psychosocial and physical effects.

This dissertation addresses such social dilemmas using laboratory experiments.

These institutions make us self-conscious of our appearance in comparison to others and boost cooperation in social dilemmas...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to give a short preview on the European {{legislative}} regarding the fundamental right to protection on personal data, established with the Charter of Fundamental Rights in EU, and it’s interconnection with the national security.

National security cannot be achieved in isolation from fundamental rights. In order to achieve national security while safeguarding fundamental rights we must do careful consideration to see whether too much freedom is being sacrificed to achieve a high degree of security.
