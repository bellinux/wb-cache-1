25|$|A {{crucial point}} in the {{dialogue}} is when Socrates tells Meno {{that there is no}} such thing as teaching, only recollection of knowledge from past lives, or <b>anamnesis.</b> Socrates claims that he can demonstrate this by showing that one of Meno's servants, a slave boy, knows geometric principles though he is uneducated. Socrates states that he will teach the boy nothing, only ask him questions to assist the process of recollection. Socrates proceeds to ask the slave boy a series of questions about the size and length of lines and squares, using visual diagrams to aid the boy in understanding the questions. The crucial point to this part of the dialogue is that, though the boy has no training, he knows the correct answers to the questions – he intrinsically knows the Pythagorean proposition.|$|E
25|$|To {{determine}} the patient's suitability for undergoing a rhinoplasty procedure, the surgeon clinically evaluates {{him or her}} with a complete medical history (<b>anamnesis)</b> to determine his or her physical and psychological health. The prospective patient must explain to the physician–surgeon the functional and aesthetic nasal problems {{that he or she}} suffers. The surgeon asks about the ailments' symptoms and their duration, past surgical interventions, allergies, drugs use and drugs abuse (prescription and commercial medications), and a general medical history. Furthermore, additional to physical suitability is psychological suitability—the patient's psychological motive for undergoing nose surgery is critical to the surgeon's pre-operative evaluation of the patient. In the case of men, the surgeon must identify prospective patients presenting the mental traits denoted by the psychiatric acronym SIMON (single, immature, male, over-expectant, and narcissistic), which might indicate a man over-valuing the outcome of a rhinoplasty.|$|E

2500|$|One {{feature of}} the {{dialogue}} is Socrates' use of one of Meno's slaves to demonstrate his idea of <b>anamnesis,</b> that certain knowledge is innate and [...] "recollected" [...] by the soul through proper inquiry.|$|E
2500|$|The Theory of Recollection {{explains}} that we possess some non-empirical knowledge (e.g. The Form of Equality) at birth, implying the soul existed before birth to carry that knowledge. [...] Another {{account of the}} theory is found in Plato's Meno, although in that case Socrates implies <b>anamnesis</b> (previous knowledge of everything) whereas he is not so bold in Phaedo.|$|E
2500|$|The {{words of}} Institution {{occur in a}} form that is almost {{identical}} with the [...] "Pridie quam pateretur" [...] (ib., 86-87). The <b>Anamnesis</b> (p.89) begins: [...] "Commemorating therefore [...] O Lord, thy death and resurrection on the third day from the tomb and thy ascension into heaven [...] [...] [...] [...] we offer thee this dread and unbloody sacrifice [...]|$|E
2500|$|This {{is derived}} from Socrates' belief that one's soul existed in past lives and {{knowledge}} is transferred from those lives to the current one. [...] "These [...] were revealed in a former state of existence, and are recovered by reminiscence (<b>anamnesis)</b> or association from sensible things" [...] The claim is that one {{does not need to}} know what knowledge is before gaining knowledge, but rather one has a wealth of knowledge before ever gaining any experience.|$|E
2500|$|Whether or not Plato intends {{that the}} {{tethering}} of true beliefs with reasoned explanations must always involve <b>anamnesis</b> is explored in later {{interpretations of the}} text. Socrates' distinction between [...] "true belief" [...] and [...] "knowledge" [...] forms {{the basis of the}} philosophical definition of knowledge as [...] "justified true belief". Myles Burnyeat and others, however, have argued that the phrase aitias logismos refers to a practical working out of a solution, rather than a justification.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{discussion}} with Anytus, Socrates returns to quizzing Meno {{for his own}} thoughts on whether the sophists are teachers of virtue and whether virtue can be taught. Meno is again at a loss, and Socrates suggests {{that they have made}} a mistake in agreeing that knowledge is required for virtue. He points out the similarities and differences between [...] "true belief" [...] and [...] "knowledge". True beliefs are as useful to us as knowledge, but they often fail to [...] "stay in their place" [...] and must be [...] "tethered" [...] by what he calls aitias logismos (the calculation of reason, or reasoned explanation), immediately adding that this is <b>anamnesis,</b> or recollection.|$|E
2500|$|Meno ( [...] ; [...] ) is a Socratic {{dialogue}} {{written by}} Plato. [...] It appears {{to attempt to}} determine the definition of virtue, or arete, meaning virtue in general, rather than particular virtues, such as justice or temperance. The {{first part of the}} work is written in the Socratic dialectical style and Meno is reduced to confusion or aporia. In response to Meno's paradox (or the learner's paradox), however, Socrates introduces positive ideas: the immortality of the soul, the theory of knowledge as recollection (<b>anamnesis),</b> which Socrates demonstrates by posing a mathematical puzzle to one of Meno's slaves, the method of hypothesis, and, in the final lines, the distinction between knowledge and true belief.|$|E
2500|$|Within the Torah, the shewbread is {{mentioned}} exclusively by the Priestly Code and Holiness Code, but certain {{sections of the}} Bible, including the Book of Chronicles, Books of Samuel, and Book of Kings, also describe aspects of them. In the Holiness Code, the shewbread is described as twelve cakes/loaves baked from fine flour, arranged in two rows/piles on a table standing before God; each loaf/cake was to contain two Omers of flour (...) (approx 4.9 pounds). The Biblical regulations specify that cups of frankincense were to be placed upon the rows of cakes, and the Septuagint, but not the masoretic text, states that salt was mixed with the frankincense; the frankincense, which the Septuagint refers to as an <b>anamnesis,</b> (a hapax legomenon), constituted a memorial (azkarah), having been offered upon the altar to God (...)

2500|$|Donald like Plato (and Aristotle, {{especially}} in On Memory and Recollection), emphasizes the peculiarity in humans of voluntary initiation of a search through one's mental world. The ancient Greek <b>anamnēsis,</b> normally translated as [...] "recollection" [...] {{was opposed to}} mneme or memory. Memory, shared with some animals, requires a consciousness not only {{of what happened in}} the past, but also that something happened in the past, which is in other words a kind of eikasia [...] "...but nothing except man is able to recollect." [...] Recollection is a deliberate effort to search for and recapture something once known. Klein writes that, [...] "To become aware of our having forgotten something means to begin recollecting." [...] Donald calls the same thing autocueing, which he explains as follows: [...] "Mimetic acts are reproducible on the basis of internal, self-generated cues. This permits voluntary recall of mimetic representations, without the aid of external cues – probably the earliest form of representational thinking." ...|$|E
2500|$|The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accessibility Act (HIPAA) {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} privacy by providing medical information handling guidelines.

Professional secrecy applies to practitioners, psychologists, nursing, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, nursing assistants, chiropodists, cellists and administrative personnel, as well as auxiliary hospital staff. The maintenance of the confidentiality and privacy of patients implies first of all in the medical history, which must be adequately guarded, remaining accessible only to the authorized personnel. However, the precepts of privacy must be observed in all fields of hospital life: privacy {{at the time of the}} conduct of the <b>anamnesis</b> and physical exploration, the privacy at the time of the information to the relatives, the conversations between healthcare providers in the corridors, maintenance of adequate patient data collection in hospital nursing controls (planks, slates), telephone conversations, open intercoms ...|$|E
2500|$|Today {{a growing}} body of {{scientific}} evidence indicate that this disease process, in the cancellous bone and bone marrow, is caused by bone infarcts mediated by a range of local and systemic factors. Bone infarcts as well as damage to the deeper portion of the cancellous bone is an insidious process. It is certainly not visible clinically and routine imaging techniques such as radiographs are not effective for that sort of damage. [...] "An important and often incompletely understood principle of radiography is the amount of bone destruction that goes undetected by routine x-rays procedures; this has been demonstrated by numerous investigators. Destruction confined to the cancellous portion of the bone cannot be detected radiographically, as radiolucencies appear only when there is internal or external erosion or destruction of the bone cortex." [...] In fact no radiographic findings are specific for bone infarction / osteonecrosis. A variety of pathologies may mimic bone infarction, including stress fractures, infections, inflammations, and metabolic and neoplastic processes. The limitations apply to all imaging modalities, including plain radiography, radionuclide studies, CT scans, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Through-transmission alveolar ultrasound, based on quantitative ultrasound (QUS) in combination with panoramic dental radiography (orthopantomography) is helpful in assessing changes in jawbone density. When practitioners have an up-to-date understanding of the disease process and a good <b>anamnesis</b> is combined with detailed clinical findings and course of events, the diagnosis, with the help of various imaging modality, can be achieved earlier, in most patients.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are other}} {{striking}} resemblances {{that may be}} seen in Drews. But the other Eastern liturgy, the Alexandrine use, also shows very striking parallels. The prayer for the celebrant, of which the form was [...] "Mihi quoque indignissimo famulo tuo propitius esse digneris, et ab omnibus me peccatorum offensionibus emundare" [...] (Ebner, Miss. Rom., 401), is an exact translation of the corresponding Alexandrine text: [...] "Remember me also, O Lord, thy humble and unworthy servant, and forgive my sins" [...] (Brightman, 130). The author of [...] "De Sacr." [...] quotes the Roman Canon as saying [...] "quod est figura corporis et sanguinis domini nostri Iesu Christi", and the Egyptian Prayer Book of Serapion of Thmuis uses exactly the same expression, [...] "the figure of the body and blood" [...] (Texte u. Unt., II, 3, p.5). In the West the words [...] "our God" [...] are not often applied to Christ in liturgies. In the Gelasian Sacramentary they occur ("ut nobis corpus et sanguis fiat dilectissimi filii tui Domini Dei nostri Iesu Christi", ed. Wilson, 235), just where they come in the same context in St. Mark's Liturgy (Brightman, 126). The modern Mass refers to the oblation as [...] "thy gifts and favours" [...] (de tuis donis ac datis); so does St. Mark (ib., 133). But the most striking parallel between Rome and Alexandria is in the order of the Canon. The Antiochene Liturgy puts the whole of the Intercession after the words of Institution and the Epiklesis; in Alexandria it comes before. And in the Roman Canon the greater part of this intercession ("imprimis quæ tibi offerimus", [...] "Commemoratio pro vivis", [...] "Communicantes") also comes before the Consecration, leaving only as a curious anomaly the [...] "Commemoratio pro defunctis" [...] and the [...] "Nobis quoque peccatoribus" [...] to follow after the <b>Anamnesis</b> (Unde et momores).|$|E
