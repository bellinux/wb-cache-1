25|$|Both Heirens and {{his parents}} signed a confession. The parties agreed to a date of July 30 for Heirens to make his {{official}} confession. On that date the defense went to Tuohy's office, where several reporters were assembled to ask Heirens questions and where Tuohy himself made a speech. Heirens appeared bewildered and gave noncommittal answers to reporters' questions, which he years later blamed on Tuohy:It was Tuohy himself. After assembling all the officials, including attorneys and policemen, he began a preamble about how long everyone had waited to get a confession from me, but, at last, the truth {{was going to be}} told. He kept emphasizing the word 'truth' <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> if he really wanted the truth. He assured me that he did...Now Tuohy made a big deal about hearing the truth. Now, when I was being forced to lie to save myself. It made me angry...so I told them the truth, and everyone got very upset.|$|E
500|$|... "You do {{appreciate}} {{the absurdity of}} a group of rabbis in Israel claiming that I'm being blasphemous about someone when they haven't heard the record, right? And then, everyone in the media runs with it as if it's the truth. And that's a little weird. But what's even weirder is that the song is not about Isaac Lurier, as the rabbis claim. It's named after Yitzhak Sinwani, who's singing in Yemenite on the track. I couldn't think of a title for the song. So I called it [...] "Isaac" [...] It's interesting how their minds work, those naughty rabbis. [...] He's saying, [...] "If all of the doors of all of the generous peoples' homes are closed to you, the gates of heaven will always be open." [...] The words are about 1,000 years old. [...] is an old friend of mine. He's never made a record. He comes from generations of beautiful singers. Stuart <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> to come into the studio one day. We said, [...] "We're just going to record you. We don't know what we're going to do with it." [...] He's flawless. One take, no bad notes. He doesn't even need a microphone. We took one of the songs he did and I said to Stuart, [...] "Let's sample these bits. We'll create a chorus and then I'll write lyrics around it." [...] That's how we constructed it." ...|$|E

He also used the type font from our very first single, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> about it {{and he had no}} idea. He was just on point." [...] Fairey also remarked [...] "I use red {{frequently}} because it is a visually powerful, emotionally potent color. Red gets people's attention. In this case there is the added possibility that the red liquid could be blood, giving it an even more sinister sense of foreboding." [...] The red color of the artwork was changed for most of the special edition releases. The Best Buy reissue features a black-and-white version of the original artwork.|$|E
60|$|I am the forger's only friend, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> to {{come forward}} and make a clean breast of it, like the young men who hoaxed the Society for Psychical Research with a faked wraith, or phantasm of the living.|$|R
60|$|Aristocrat as I was, {{no names}} had ever thrilled me as those did, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> eagerly <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> to point me out {{each of these}} famous soldiers.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't," [...] she repeated. [...] "Indeed I don't. He {{never told}} me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> never <b>asked</b> <b>him.</b> <b>I</b> {{understood}} {{that he had made}} it in South Africa." ...|$|R
2500|$|On January 20, 2012, the Wallflowers began {{recording}} their sixth studio album, Glad All Over at the Black Keys' Dan Auerbach's Easy Eye {{studio in}} Nashville. Jay Joyce, {{who had played}} guitar on the Wallflowers' Bringing Down the Horse agreed to produce the album. [...] Before going to the studio, the band had decided have a more collaborative writing process than {{they had in the}} past. [...] Instead of Dylan bringing in fully completed songs like he had done in the past, he only brought lyrics. [...] Dylan {{and the rest of the}} band wrote the music for the songs together in the studio. [...] Joyce explained: [...] "Jakob came to Nashville and we sat down <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> to play me a song, but instead he pulled out this 2-inch-thick notebook. ‘This is what I’ve got. Let’s play some grooves and throw it around.’ I thought, ‘Wow, that’s kind of scary, but it’s exciting.’ So we didn’t really know going in what we were going to do. We had no songs, no demos. It was all developed in the studio. [...] The band finished recording on February 20, 2012.|$|E
60|$|He {{had been}} {{spending}} the winter with his people at Tangiers, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> how {{he liked the}} place.|$|E
60|$|As I shook old Harût's hand in {{farewell}} {{he told me}} that he {{was going}} on to Egypt, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> why.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is not {{mischief}} at all, Gerald. The Antelope came in last night, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> saw Captain Lockett this morning, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> {{to come to}} supper." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here!" [...] I said, [...] "why {{not stay}} for a while: <b>and</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> to come and have a pipe with us. We can then talk over things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And at this, that giant {{from whom}} {{the light of}} reason was {{withheld}} threw out his mighty arms {{and asked me to}} forgive <b>him.</b> <b>And</b> when <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> for what he should be forgiven he answered: `For being right.' ...|$|R
60|$|As we {{went along}} in silence I noticed that Peterkin sighed {{once or twice}} very heavily, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> if he was quite well.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have hurt}} a man {{down in the}} village," [...] was the terrified answer. [...] "I didn't mean to--no! I swear that I did not mean to. I went to his house <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> for money. I {{had a right to}} it! <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> to tell me where--but oh! you would not understand. Listen! I swear to you that I did not mean to hurt him. Why should I? He was old, and I think he fainted. God! do you hear that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{we began}} to talk about old times, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> if he had any oxen to sell, saying that this was my reason for visiting the kraal.|$|E
6000|$|... "I heard Hoffman {{singing a}} Polish song to little Roserl, {{the burden of}} which was, 'Ma drogha, Ma drogha,' <b>and</b> when <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> to {{translate}} it, those two words meant, 'My darling.' How dare you, ungrateful creature that you are!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He was toddling about quite happily on the lawn," [...] said Mrs. Momeby tearfully, [...] "and Arnold {{had just}} come in, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was <b>asking</b> <b>him</b> what sort of sauce he would like with the asparagus--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure, Mr. Ditmar, we {{can always}} make room for you. Well, I haven't laid eyes on you for a dog's age. Only last Sunday Mr. Crane was here, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was <b>asking</b> <b>him</b> where you'd been keeping yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|I was grieved {{to trouble}} this friend, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> what I should do. [...] "Do {{you want me}} to stop the work on the well?" [...] said I.|$|E
6000|$|... "You needn't grip {{on to my}} arm like a fish-eagle on a trout! I {{went back}} to the major, then, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> when he was in Paris to pass by the archbishop's door." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When he put Morgan in the dory," [...] {{answered}} Bridger, [...] "the {{next day}} to take him aboard the Pajaro, this man Plunkett stopped {{to shake hands with}} me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> the same question." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I took Peregrine Orme {{with me that}} I {{might have}} a witness, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> then <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> whether he had spread these reports. He {{acknowledged}} {{that he had done}} so, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> told him that he was a villain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "DOCTOR IGNATIUS LOYOLA!" [...] {{says the}} groom of the chambers, who {{pretends to be}} a scholar; and in the little genlmn went. When safely housed, the other chap came; <b>and</b> when <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> his name, said, in a thick, gobbling kind of voice: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{opportunity}} for which I {{have been waiting}} has come at last. Mr. Mountjoy is, I believe, fully recovered. This morning, seeing him so well <b>and</b> strong, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> if <b>I</b> might venture to place in his hands a paper containing a narrative.|$|R
6000|$|... "You see," [...] {{said the}} {{stumbling}} spokesman, [...] "I was {{angry with him}} when he insulted the Mother of God, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> to fight a duel with me; but the police are all trying to stop it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Simply this. I {{sometimes}} {{play a game}} of whist, {{and therefore}} he called me a gambler. Then I reminded him that he also sometimes played a game of whist, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> what deduction was to be drawn." ...|$|E
60|$|SAVOYARD. Pleased to meet you, Miss O'Dowda. The {{cocked hat}} is all right. Trotter {{is a member}} of the new Academic Committee. He induced them to go in for a uniform like the French Academy; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> to wear it.|$|E
6000|$|Jephson {{appeared}} much {{surprised by}} this story. He remained thoughtful <b>and</b> silent. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> if {{he would like to}} hear any more, and as he offered no active opposition I went on. (Maybe he was asleep; that idea did not occur to me at the time.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is my affair," [...] she {{answered}} simply. [...] "First of all, though, I {{should go to}} Mr. Deane, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> should <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> to help me. Any man of common sense would agree with me at once in believing that my uncle was robbed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My brother says he's {{going to}} Newcome, Barnes, next week," [...] said the Baronet, wishing {{to make the}} {{conversation}} more interesting to the newly arrived Colonel. [...] "He was saying so just when you came in, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was <b>asking</b> <b>him</b> what took him there?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{called upon}} your brother {{a few days}} before his death," [...] the Colonel {{continued}} calmly. [...] "I explained my claim to the letters <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> for them. He too refused! Do you remember, by the by, what happened to your brother?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Avast there!" [...] cried Mr. Smollett. [...] "Gray told me nothing, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> nothing; and what's more, I {{would see}} you and him and this whole island blown clean {{out of the water}} into blazes first. So there's my mind for you, my man, on that." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{looked at}} them, it was true. They were huge {{and ran up}} for fifty or sixty feet without a bough. Moreover, it was {{probable}} that the god climbed better than we could. The Kalubi began to move inland in an indeterminate fashion, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> where he was going.|$|E
5000|$|The idea of {{the huge}} hand [...] "came from the image that Carlos Pacheco gave us in Avengers Forever #10. Kurt <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> for a shot of a {{gigantic}} hand bigger than the star it was reaching for -- and, boy, did he deliver!" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{had heard}} {{about some of these}} things before, but not all of them. Jim knowed all kinds of signs. He said he knowed most everything. I said it looked to me like all the signs was about bad luck, <b>and</b> so <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> if there warn't any good-luck signs. He says: ...|$|R
6000|$|What [...] "façons mondaines" [...] he {{discovered}} in my present winter merino and plain white collar, I own it puzzled me to guess: <b>and</b> when <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him,</b> {{he said it}} was all made with too much attention to effect--and besides, [...] "had I not a bow of ribbon at my neck?" ...|$|R
