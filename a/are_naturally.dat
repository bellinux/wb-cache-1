5|$|On {{geophysical}} evidence, {{most of the}} nickel on Earth {{is believed}} to be in the Earth's outer and inner cores. Kamacite and taenite <b>are</b> <b>naturally</b> occurring alloys of iron and nickel. For kamacite, the alloy is usually in the proportion of 90:10 to 95:5, although impurities (such as cobalt or carbon) may be present, while for taenite the nickel content is between 20% and 65%. Kamacite and taenite are also found in nickel iron meteorites.|$|E

Quantum cellular automata, one way of performing computations using the principles of quantum mechanics, are often required to be reversible.

5|$|While ducks <b>are</b> <b>naturally</b> aquatic, {{swimming}} can {{be dangerous}} to young ducklings, and it can also restrict a duck's growth. Thus, although duckers would ensure the ducklings always had a trough or sink to paddle in, the ducklings would be kept away from bodies of water while they were growing. The exception was shortly before slaughter, when the ducklings would be taken for one swim in a pond, as it helped them to feather properly.|$|E
5|$|A battle {{certainly}} ensued {{although there}} <b>are</b> <b>naturally</b> two accounts {{as to what}} actually took place. According to the Burmese chronicles, the Burmese command fielded an army led by Thado Dhamma Yaza, the Viceroy of Prome, as a decoy and the two armies lurked on the flanks in order to encircle any overstretched Siamese forces. As planned, the Siamese vanguard troops pressed on Thado Dhamma Yaza's army, allowing Bayinnaung's army waiting on the left flank to encircle the Siamese forces, which subsequently were wiped out. Tabinshwehti's army on the right flank drove back the remaining Siamese forces into the city.|$|E

5|$|Crime and Punishment {{focuses on}} the mental anguish and moral {{dilemmas}} of Rodion Raskolnikov, an impoverished ex-student in Saint Petersburg who formulates and executes a plan to kill an unscrupulous pawnbroker for her cash. Raskolnikov, {{in an attempt to}} defend his actions, argues that with the pawnbroker's money he can perform good deeds to counterbalance the crime, while ridding the world of a vermin. He also commits the murder to test a theory of his that dictates some people <b>are</b> <b>naturally</b> capable of such actions, and even have the right to perform them. Several times throughout the novel, Raskolnikov compares himself with Napoleon Bonaparte and shares his belief that murder is permissible in pursuit of a higher purpose.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, air {{furnaces}} (such as reverberatory furnaces) <b>are</b> <b>naturally</b> aspirated, {{usually by}} the convection of hot gases in a chimney flue.

However, the term has usually been limited to those used for smelting iron ore to produce pig iron, an intermediate material used {{in the production of}} commercial iron and steel, and the shaft furnaces used in combination with sinter plants in base metals smelting.|$|E
5|$|Sphecius grandis wasps {{frequently}} {{interact with}} humans {{because of their}} tendency to make their nests in backyards, gardens and sidewalks. Pest control is mostly unneeded as they nest in areas with little to no vegetation, usually ignore people, and females are not aggressive, tending to save their venom for their cicada prey, but will sting if they are grabbed or stepped on. Despite their large size, being the largest wasp to inhabit California, their sting has been reported as being between merely numbing and sharp to moderate. Males, while smaller, <b>are</b> <b>naturally</b> more aggressive and less tolerant of disturbance.|$|E

5|$|Twenty-two {{amino acids}} <b>are</b> <b>naturally</b> {{incorporated}} into polypeptides and are called proteinogenic or natural amino acids. Of these, 20 are encoded by the universal genetic code. The remaining 2, selenocysteine and pyrrolysine, {{are incorporated into}} proteins by unique synthetic mechanisms. Selenocysteine is incorporated when the mRNA being translated includes a SECIS element, which causes the UGA codon to encode selenocysteine instead of a stop codon. Pyrrolysine is used by some methanogenic archaea in enzymes that they use to produce methane. It is coded for with the codon UAG, which is normally a stop codon in other organisms. This UAG codon {{is followed by a}} PYLIS downstream sequence.|$|E
5|$|Hydroquinone lightens {{the skin}} when applied topically by {{inhibiting}} tyrosinase, the enzyme responsible for converting the amino acid tyrosine {{to the skin}} pigment melanin, and is used to treat acne-associated postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. By interfering with new production of melanin in the epidermis, hydroquinone leads to less hyperpigmentation as darkened skin cells <b>are</b> <b>naturally</b> shed over time. Improvement in skin hyperpigmentation is typically seen within six months when used twice daily. Hydroquinone is ineffective for hyperpigmentation affecting deeper layers of skin such as the dermis. The use of a sunscreen with SPF15 or higher {{in the morning with}} reapplication every two hours is recommended when using hydroquinone. Its application only to affected areas lowers the risk of lightening the color of normal skin but can lead to a temporary ring of lightened skin around the hyperpigmented area. Hydroquinone is generally well-tolerated; side effects are typically mild (e.g., skin irritation) and occur with use of a higher than the recommended 4% concentration. Most preparations contain the preservative sodium metabisulfite, which has been linked to rare cases of allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and severe asthma exacerbations in susceptible people. In extremely rare cases, repeated improper topical application of high-dose hydroquinone has been associated with an accumulation of homogentisic acid in connective tissues, a condition known as exogenous ochronosis.|$|E
5|$|Ovine {{obstetrics}} can be problematic. By selectively breeding ewes {{that produce}} multiple offspring with higher birth weights for generations, sheep producers have inadvertently caused some domestic sheep to have difficulty lambing. However, it {{is a myth}} that sheep cannot lamb without human assistance; many ewes give birth directly in pasture without aid. This can be proven {{by the fact that}} they give birth in the wild. Balancing ease of lambing with high productivity is one of the dilemmas of sheep breeding. While the majority of births are relatively normal and do not require intervention, many complications may arise. A lamb may present in the normal fashion (with both legs and head forward), but may simply be too large to slide out of the birth canal. This often happens when large rams are crossed with diminutive ewes (this is related to breed, rams <b>are</b> <b>naturally</b> larger than ewes by comparison). Lambs may also present themselves with one shoulder to the side, completely backward, or with only some of their limbs protruding. Lambs may also be spontaneously aborted or stillborn. Reproductive failure is a common consequence of infections such as toxoplasmosis and foot-and-mouth disease. Some types of abortion in sheep are preventable by vaccinations against these infections.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{investigate}} the natural susceptibility to 71 antimicrobial agents of 103 Listeria strains belonging to all known Listeria species (L. monocytogenes (N = 21), L. innocua (N = 21), L. seeligeri (N = 21), L. ivanovii (N = 19), L. welshimeri (N = 11), and L. grayi (N = 10)). MethodsMICs were determined using a microdilution procedure in H-Medium. ResultsAll listeriae <b>were</b> <b>naturally</b> sensitive or intermediate to tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, penicillins (except oxacillin), loracarbef, cefazoline, cefaclor, cefotiam, cefoperazone, carbapenems, macrolides, lincosamides, glycopeptides, dalfopristin/quinupristin, chloramphenicol and rifampicin (probably except L. grayi). Listeria spp. <b>were</b> <b>naturally</b> resistant or intermediate to most â€˜modernâ€™ cephalosporins (cefetamet, cefixime, ceftibuten, ceftazidime, cefdinir, cefpodoxime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime), aztreonam, pipemidic acid, dalfopristin quinupristin and sulfamethoxazole. Significant differences in natural susceptibility among the species were {{seen with the}} quinolones, trimethoprim, co-trimoxazole, rifampicin, fosfomycin and fusidic acid. It seems likely that L. grayi <b>is</b> <b>naturally</b> resistant to all antifolates; the species was least susceptible to rifampicin and most susceptible to quinolones, whereas L. ivanovii <b>was</b> <b>naturally</b> resistant to most quinolones. L. ivanovii <b>was</b> <b>naturally</b> sensitive to fosfomycin, whereas L. innocua and L. monocytogenes <b>were</b> <b>naturally</b> resistant. L. ivanovii was also the most susceptible species to fusidic acid. ConclusionsThe present study describes a database on the natural susceptibility of Listeria spp. {{to a wide range}} of antibiotics, which can be used to validate susceptibility testing results of these microorganisms...|$|R
5|$|Battles {{come in two}} types: random {{encounters}} with standard enemies, and staged boss battles. The battle system revolves around turn-based combat: each side is allowed to perform an action or multiple actions, with each character having independent movements and commands: these actions include attacking with the equipped weapon, using magic, or using an item. The party also has the option to escape from most battles. Key to the battle system are the Bravely and Default options. Brave Points (BP) dictate the number of actions a character or enemy can take within a turn, along with being needed for the execution of certain abilities. Party members can utilize BP down into negative figures, enabling up to four actions within a single turn. When the BP gauge is into negative figures, they must wait for the BP counter to reach zero before they can act again. BP <b>are</b> <b>naturally</b> recovered once per turn. Alternately, a chosen character can Default, which accumulates BP and reduces the damage taken by enemy strikes. An additional power is Bravely Second, an ability which freezes time for the enemy, allowing a party member to move four times in a single turn with no cost. Bravely Second requires SP, a currency which is either replenished while the 3DS is in sleep mode or through buying regenerative SP Drinks using microtransactions. Battle speed during combat can be sped up or returned to normal by the player's choice.|$|E
5|$|DNA can {{be damaged}} by many sorts of mutagens, which change the DNA sequence. Mutagens include {{oxidizing}} agents, alkylating agents and also high-energy electromagnetic radiation such as ultraviolet light and X-rays. The type of DNA damage produced {{depends on the}} type of mutagen. For example, UV light can damage DNA by producing thymine dimers, which are cross-links between pyrimidine bases. On the other hand, oxidants such as free radicals or hydrogen peroxide produce multiple forms of damage, including base modifications, particularly of guanosine, and double-strand breaks. A typical human cell contains about 150,000 bases that have suffered oxidative damage. Of these oxidative lesions, the most dangerous are double-strand breaks, as these are difficult to repair and can produce point mutations, insertions, deletions from the DNA sequence, and chromosomal translocations. These mutations can cause cancer. Because of inherent limits in the DNA repair mechanisms, if humans lived long enough, they would all eventually develop cancer. DNA damages that <b>are</b> <b>naturally</b> occurring, due to normal cellular processes that produce reactive oxygen species, the hydrolytic activities of cellular water, etc., also occur frequently. Although most of these damages are repaired, in any cell some DNA damage may remain despite the action of repair processes. These remaining DNA damages accumulate with age in mammalian postmitotic tissues. This accumulation appears to be an important underlying cause of aging.|$|E
