5|$|Like other Pokémon games, Ruby and Sapphires {{gameplay}} is linear; {{the main}} events {{occur in a}} fixed order. The protagonist of Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire is <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> recently moved to a small town called Littleroot Town. At {{the beginning of the}} games, the player chooses either Treecko, Torchic, or Mudkip to protect Professor Birch, the regional Professor, from an attacking wild Pokémon. After defending the Professor, the player is taken to his lab and receives the chosen Pokémon as his or her starter Pokémon. His or her friend, the protagonist's rival, is also a Pokémon Trainer and occasionally battles the player. The games' two main goals are defeating the eight Gym Leaders, proving oneself worthy of challenging the Elite Four and Champion to become the new Champion and completing the Pokédex by capturing, evolving, and trading to obtain all 202 Pokémon (It is possible to obtain all 386 Pokémon, but this requires trading with Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen).|$|E

25|$|Piaget {{recognized}} that psychometric tests had its limitations, as {{children were not}} able to provide the researcher with their deepest thoughts and inner intellect. It was also difficult to know if the results of child examination reflected what children believed or if it is just a pretend situation. For example, {{it is very difficult to}} know with certainty if <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> a conversation with a toy believes the toy is alive or if the child is just pretending.|$|E
25|$|Gardner {{argues that}} there is a wide range of {{cognitive}} abilities, but that there are only very weak correlations among them. For example, the theory postulates that a child who learns to multiply easily is not necessarily more intelligent than <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> more difficulty on this task. The child who takes more time to master multiplication may best learn to multiply through a different approach, may excel in a field outside mathematics, or may be looking at and understanding the multiplication process at a fundamentally deeper level.|$|E

A new volume began {{as part of}} the All-New, All-Different Marvel branding, written by Charles Soule with art by Ron Garney with the first two issues {{released}} in December 2015. In this series, Matt returns to New York, where he now works as an Assistant District Attorney. He will have a redesigned costume and a new apprentice in Samuel Chung, an illegal immigrant who has been living in New York's Chinatown since he was <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> taken up the codename Blindspot. When the Purple Children acquired a machine designed by their father to enhance his powers, after Matt had saved them from a mob, they used the machine to erase the world's knowledge of Matt's identity as Daredevil, Matt only allowing Foggy to know his secret identity afterwards, enabling him to be re-instated as a New York Attorney. Using his restored secret identity, Murdock is {{able to take advantage of}} a subsequent court case to establish a precedent for superheroes testifying in court without the need to expose their secret identities. Despite interference from the Kingpin, Murdock succeeds in the Supreme Court, and afterwards returns to his traditional red costume.|$|E

2500|$|Nintendo has {{publicly}} {{stated that the}} 3D mode of the Nintendo 3DS is not intended for use by children ages six and younger, citing possible harm to their vision. Nintendo suggests that younger players use the device's 2D mode instead, although the American Optometric Association has assured parents that 3D gaming in moderation would not be harmful for children. Additionally, the 3DS may help in screening children {{before the age of}} 6 who have depth related vision problems according to Dr. Michael Duenas, associate director for health sciences and policy for the American Optometric Association, and Dr. Joe Ellis, the president of the optometrists' association. However, Dr. David Hunter, a pediatric ophthalmologist affiliated with the American Academy of Ophthalmology believes that it is largely speculative whether <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> problems perceiving depth in real life would react to a 3DS in any way that parents would recognize as indicating any problems with depth perception. Nintendo's vague warning, that, [...] "there is a possibility that 3-D images which send different images to the left and right eye could affect the development of vision in small children," [...] was not specifically backed up by any scientific evidence, leading Duenas to believe it is motivated by preventing possible liability rather than safeguarding against realistic harm.|$|E
2500|$|Winchester was {{respected}} by the others professionally, {{but at the}} same time, as a Boston blue blood, he was also snobbish, as when he stated in the scrub room, [...] "I do one thing at a time, I do it very well, and then I move on," [...] which drove much of his conflict with the other characters. Still, the show's writers occasionally allowed Winchester's humanity to shine through, such as in his dealings with a young concert pianist who had partially lost the use of his right hand, the protection of a stuttering soldier from the bullying of other soldiers (it is revealed later that Winchester's sister Honoria stutters), his keeping a vigil with Hawkeye when Hawkeye's father went into surgery back in the States ("Sons and Bowlers"), his willingness to be officer of the day for Hawkeye when Hawkeye was offered three days in Seoul, giving blood to a patient even though he already donated blood five days earlier, or his continuing a family tradition of anonymously giving Christmas treats to an orphanage. Winchester subjects himself to condemnation after realizing that [...] "it is sadly inappropriate to offer dessert to <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> had no meal." [...] Isolating himself, he is saved by Klinger's own gift of understanding. Klinger scrapes together a Christmas dinner for Charles, with the provision that the source of the gift remain anonymous (Klinger had overheard Winchester's argument with the manager of the orphanage). For the final moment of the episode ("Death Takes a Holiday"), the two are simply friends as Charles says, [...] "Thank you, Max," [...] and Klinger replies, [...] "Merry Christmas, Charles." [...] As well, in the series finale [...] "Goodbye, Farewell, and Amen", Charles comes across a group of Chinese musicians who surrender to him. When Charles takes them back to the camp as prisoners of war and later listens to his record of Mozart's [...] Quintet in A major for Clarinet and Strings, K. 581, the musicians attempt to play the piece of music. Charles, ever the perfectionist, cannot stand to hear them play the piece incorrectly (and is impressed that they can even attempt to play the music after only hearing it once) and spends the next week conducting them on how to play the piece properly. During this time, Charles is forced to use the little patience that he rarely shows. When the Chinese musicians are taken off to a prisoner of war camp in a prisoner exchange to Charles' dismay and protest, their final goodbye to Charles is the Mozart piece played correctly. Later, one of the musicians returns to the camp mortally wounded on a Jeep. When Charles inquires as to where the other musicians are, it's revealed that the truck the musicians were on was ambushed and that there were no other survivors. In a combination of shock and disbelief, Charles returns to The Swamp to listen to the Mozart record, but removes the record and smashes it in anger. Later still on the final night that everyone at the M*A*S*H is together, Charles says that before the war, music was a stress reliever to him, but because of the Chinese musicians and their fate, music will forever be a reminder of the horrors of war.|$|E
