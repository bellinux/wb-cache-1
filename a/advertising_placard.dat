She said: [...] "Google the School of Practical Philosophy and you'll find some accusations that it's a cult.

Barrett refers to Brown`s political party as the Black Man`s Party rather than The Suffering People`s Party, though he also quotes the party`s position that all were free to join regardless of colour. Also included in his book is a photograph captioned [...] "rare photograph of a Rastafarian political party symbol", depicting a group of Rastafarians (one of whom may be Brown) standing by a <b>placard</b> <b>advertising</b> Brown's campaign.|$|R
6000|$|The {{inventor}} of movable types, says the venerable Teufelsdröckh, was disbanding hired armies, cashiering most kings and senates, {{and creating a}} whole new democratic world. Has any one yet said what great things are being done by the men {{who are trying to}} banish ugliness from our streets and our homes, and to make both the outside and inside of our dwellings worthy of a world where there are forests and flower-tressed meadows, and the plumage of birds; where the insects carry lessons of color on their wings, and even the surface of a stagnant pool will show us the wonders of iridescence and the most delicate forms of leafage? They, too, are modifying opinions, for they are modifying men’s moods and habits, which are the mothers of opinions, having quite {{as much to do with}} their formation as the responsible father—Reason. Think of certain hideous manufacturing towns where the piety is chiefly a belief in copious perdition, and the pleasure is chiefly gin. The dingy surface of wall pierced by the ugliest windows, the staring shop-fronts, paper-hangings, carpets, brass and gilt mouldings, and <b>advertising</b> <b>placards,</b> have an effect akin to that of malaria; it is easy to understand that with such surroundings there is more belief in cruelty than in beneficence, and that the best earthly bliss attainable is the dulling of the external senses. For it is a fatal mistake to suppose that ugliness which is taken for beauty will answer all the purposes of beauty; the subtle relation between all kinds of truth and fitness in our life forbids that bad taste should ever be harmless to our moral sensibility or our intellectual discernment; and—more than that—as it is probable that fine musical harmonies have a sanative influence over our bodily organization, it is also probable that just coloring and lovely combinations of lines may be necessary to the complete well-being of our systems apart from any conscious delight in them. A savage may indulge in discordant chuckles and shrieks and gutturals, and think that they please the gods, but it does not follow that his frame would not be favorably wrought upon by the vibrations of a grand church organ. One sees a person capable of choosing the worst style of wall-paper become suddenly afflicted by its ugliness under an attack of illness. And if an evil state of blood and lymph usually goes along with an evil state of mind, who shall say that the ugliness of our streets, the falsity of our ornamentation, the vulgarity of our upholstery, have not something to do with those bad tempers which breed false conclusions? ...|$|R
60|$|In the cafés {{and other}} public places there were <b>placards</b> <b>advertising</b> American wine-presses, but I saw none of them in use. At a farm-house near us we looked on at the use {{of one of the}} old-fashioned Swiss presses. Under it lay a mighty cake of grapes, stems, and skins, crushed into a common mass, and bulging farther beyond the press with each turn of the screw, while the juice ran in a little rivulet into a tub below. When the press was lifted, the grapes were seen only half crushed. Two peasants then mounted the cake, and trimmed it into shape with long-handled spades, piling the {{trimmings}} on top, and then bringing the press down again. They invited us with charming politeness to taste the juice, but their heavy boots bore evidence of too recent a visit to the cherished manure heap, and we thanked them with equal courtesy.|$|R
5000|$|The band's theme song, an {{adaptation}} of [...] "I Like Mountain Music", a popular fiddle song, included the line [...] "Pass the biscuits, Pappy!" [...] which gave the elder O'Daniel his nickname. [...] He announced his Texas gubernatorial campaign in 1938 on the radio during the Hillbilly Boys' radio show and make [...] "Pass the biscuits, Pappy!" [...] his campaign slogan. [...] As he had done earlier with the Doughboys, O'Daniel fitted out a bus with <b>placards</b> <b>advertising</b> Hillbilly Flour and took his band on the road, but this time to mount a political campaign. O'Daniel, his son Pat and the other Hillbilly Boys drove more than 20,000 miles in their bus promoting O'Daniel's political ambitions and his flour. By most accounts, the band drew rapt crowds in even the smallest town. When the tour bus hit Houston, it drew an estimated 26,000 people, the largest crowd ever for a political rally in Texas at that time.|$|R
5000|$|Oastler had {{previously}} told other anti-Poor Law campaigners that Frankland Lewis was urging Thornhill to sack him, and his dismissal {{was described in}} various sympathetic papers as [...] "the rewards of independent resistance of Whig tyranny". <b>Placards</b> <b>advertising</b> a procession {{to pay tribute to}} Oastler as he left Fixby (August 1838) offended Thornhill; he wrote a letter for publication saying that Oastler had been sacked, not because of his anti-Poor Law activities, but [...] "because he converted my money to his own use, and paid so little attention to my concerns and his duty that the persons employed under him have cheated me" [...] Thornhill's letter was written at Cowes (17 August 1838) and hence without the knowledge of his legal adviser, who (once shown it) persuaded Thornhill to instead send to the papers a letter (also dated as from Cowes, 17 August) saying that Oastler had been sacked because he owed Thornhill money and was devoting his efforts to politics, rather than repaying the debt. [...] Through the incompetence of Oastler's successor as steward of Fixby both letters were published in (different) Yorkshire papers. [...] "He found he had gone too far, and having by his first letter dug a pit for his reputation, he writes another by way of putting a tombstone on it" [...] said Oastler, but his promissory note put him at Thornhill's mercy.|$|R
5000|$|An ambitious {{follower}} of Charles Churchill and Peter Pindar, {{he found his}} satirical opportunity {{at the close of}} 1811. According to his own version of the affair, it was then rumoured that Lord Yarmouth had horsewhipped the Prince Regent at Oatlands, the Duke of York's house, for making improper overtures to the Marchioness of Hertford, Yarmouth's mother-in-law. On this incident Daniel wrote a squib in verse, which he called 'R—y—l Stripes; or a Kick from Yar—th to Wa—s; with the particulars of an Expedition to Oat—ds and the Sprained Ancle: a poem, by P—— P——, Poet Laureat.' Effingham Wilson of Cornhill printed the poem and advertised its publication; but it was suppressed and bought up, before it was published, in January 1812, by order of the Prince Regent, and through the instrumentality of Lord Yarmouth and Colonel McMahon, a large sum being given to the author for the copyright. It was <b>advertised</b> and <b>placarded,</b> which drew public attention to it, and a copy was by some means procured by the parties, who applied to the publisher before any copies were circulated. The author secured four copies only, one of which he sold to a public institution for five guineas. A man at the West End of the town who had procured a copy made a considerable sum by advertising and selling manuscript copies at half-a-guinea each' (Daniel's manuscript note in British Museum copy of R—y—l Stripes). But Daniel was not quieted: under the pseudonym of P—— P——, poet laureate, he published other squibs on royal scandals, of which the chief were: 'Sophia's Letters to the B—r—n Ger—b Geramb, or Whiskers in the Dumps, with old sighs set to new tunes' (1812); 'Suppressed Evidence on R—l Intriguing, being the History of a Courtship, Marriage, and Separation, exemplified in the fate of the Princess of ——, by P—— P——, Poet Laureat, Author of [...] "R—l Stripes"' (1813) (suppressed), and 'The R—l First Born, or the Baby out of his Leading Strings, containing the Particulars of a P—y Confirmation by B—p of O—g, by P—— P——, Poet Laureat, Author of the suppressed poem,' 1814.|$|R
40|$|New York "Tribune" editor Horace Greeley is {{ridiculed}} for vacillating between {{support of}} candidates Martin Van Buren and Zachary Taylor {{in the presidential}} election of 1848. Greeley balances precariously on a tightrope labeled "Mason & Dickson's Line," which is stretched across Salt River. He holds a balancing pole with a bust of Van Buren on one end and Zachary Taylor on the other. His foot rests upon a stool which in turn rests upon a loaf of "Bran Bread" (a well-known Greeley preference) poised on edge on the wire. He comments, "O crackee! it is as hard work for me to define my position as it was for Taylor to define his," referring to Taylor's stubborn refusal to take a public stand on major issues. Below, immersed in the proverbial river of political disaster, is Henry Clay, defeated candidate for the Whig presidential nomination. Clay complains, "Alas! my Whig brethren! to this complexion must we all come at last!" To the right, on shore, a bespectacled man (possibly an abolitionist) reads aloud from a book: "On slipp'ry heights, I see them stand / While briny billows roll below.
