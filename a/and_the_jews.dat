5|$|He {{also took}} {{advantage}} of his travels to deliver fiery political and religious sermons in which he encouraged villagers to organize resistance units to attack the British and Jews.

5|$|During the 1941 {{collapse}} of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia under the Axis invasion in the April War, the Independent State of Croatia was created. It was ruled by the extreme nationalist Ustaša regime. The Ustaša quickly started with the systematic persecution of the Jews, modeled after the Nazi Germany approach, and at times even more brutal. Racial laws were introduced, Jewish property was confiscated, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> were subjected to mass arrests and deportations to death camps in Croatia and abroad.|$|E
5|$|Wagner's {{writings}} on Jews, including Jewishness in Music, corresponded to some existing trends of thought in Germany during the 19th century; however, despite his very public views on these themes, {{throughout his life}} Wagner had Jewish friends, colleagues and supporters. There have been frequent suggestions that antisemitic stereotypes are represented in Wagner's operas. The characters of Mime in the Ring, Sixtus Beckmesser in Die Meistersinger, and Klingsor in Parsifal are sometimes claimed as Jewish representations, though they are not identified as such in the librettos of these operas. The topic of Wagner <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> is further complicated by allegations, {{which may have been}} credited by Wagner, that he himself was of Jewish ancestry, via his supposed father Geyer.|$|E

5|$|In {{the city}} of Trieste, then subject to Austrian rule, the Jewish {{community}} saw positive change under Maria Theresa's rule. On 19 April 1771, Maria Theresa granted two Sovereign Licenses to the Jews of Trieste, licenses that constitute real regulations. In 1782, with the famous Edict of Tolerance, her son Joseph II admitted the Jews to some charges in the Stock Exchange and to other liberal professions. A year later the Jewish primary school was opened {{with the name of}} Scuole Pie Normali Israelitiche. The following year, in 1784, the gates of the Ghetto were opened so that the Jews of Trieste could live together with their fellow citizens of different religions; however most of them continued to live in the Ghetto. Maria Theresa's influence and personal prejudices were limited by the 1780s, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> of Trieste lived in relative peace until the beginning of French rule in the region.|$|E

Trades such as silver-smithing, blacksmiths, repairing weapons and tools, weaving, pottery, masonry, carpentry, shoe making, and tailoring were occupations that were exclusively taken by Jews. The division of labor created a sort of covenant, based on mutual economic and social dependency, between the Zaydi Muslim population <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> of Yemen.

25|$|Though {{persecution}} still existed, emancipation {{spread throughout}} Europe in the 19th century.
