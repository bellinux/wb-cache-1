40|$|In Italy some {{agricultural}} {{areas have been}} planted with high value hardwood mixed plantations (mainly walnut or cherry trees) realized with a technique that provides benefits also {{for the presence of}} <b>accessory</b> <b>species.</b> The purpose of this work is to study intermediate cutting operations in mixed plantations. Two different plantations of walnut (with poplar and other fitting trees), situated in Lombardia region (Northern Italy), were investigated. In Casal Buttano plantation walnut has a planting distance of 10 x 14 m and it is combined with poplar (5 x 14 m distance). Between the two species there are two shrub rows (cob hazel and elder) and a common European alder row. In walnut rows, the main species is alternated with Eleagnus umbellata shrubs. In San Matteo delle Chiaviche plantation the planting distance between trees is 3 x 3. 5 m. Trees species are walnut, poplar, common European alder and a shrub (Eleagnus umbellata). During intermediate cutting operation poplar needs to be felled providing no damages to standing walnuts. Because of the different distance between species in the two stands, different logging methods were needed. Time studies were carried out to analyse two different logging methods. In Casal Buttano plantation cob hazel shrubs were cut with a cutting-chipper machine that provided biomass for heating. During poplar logging an operator with chainsaw felled the trees assisted by an excavator equipped with a loading grapple; the trees were then forwarded on a tractor bunk. In San Matteo delle Chiaviche plantation a chainsaw operator felled poplar in the right direction supported by an operator with felling lever; the trees were skidded by tractors. Productivity and costs of the two methods were calculated. Both adopted logging methods did not cause any damage to the standing walnuts. First method might be suitable when rows of poplar and walnuts are separated by an <b>accessory</b> <b>species</b> row, in order to avoid damages caused by the excavator. Second method is advisable in stands where rows of poplar and walnuts are adjacent, without any <b>accessory</b> <b>species</b> in the middle...|$|E

In the Cardigan district, finds of Armoricochitina reticulifera within strata referred to the clingani graptolite Biozone (morrisi Subzone), together with <b>accessory</b> <b>species,</b> indicate the Fungochitina spinifera chitinozoan Biozone, known from several Ordovician sections in northern England that span {{the base of the}} Ashgill Series. Tanuchitina ?bergstroemi, eponymous of the succeeding chitinozoan biozone, has tentatively been recovered from strata of Pleurograptus linearis graptolite Biozone age in the Cardigan area. The T. ?bergstroemi Biozone can also be correlated with the type Ashgill Series of northern England. Chitinozoans suggest that the widespread Welsh Basin anoxic?oxic transition {{at the base of the}} Nantmel Mudstones Formation in Wales, traditionally equated with the Caradoc?Ashgill boundary, is of Cautleyan (or younger Ashgill) age in the Cardigan area. In the broadly time-equivalent, graptolite-rich Whitland section, also in SW Wales, two Baltoscandian chitinozoan biozones and a subzone have been recognized (again using <b>accessory</b> <b>species),</b> namely the Spinachitina cervicornis Biozone?, the Fungochitina spinifera Biozone and the Armoricochitina reticulifera Subzone.

The {{objectives}} {{of this work}} were to evaluate the richness and diversity of the Poduromorpha fauna in two biotopes in Restinga de Maricá, RJ, Brazil, to identify the characteristic species of each biotope and to determine {{the relationships between the}} community structure and the abiotic environmental parameters. Representatives of the Poduromorpha (Collembola) order were studied under an ecological viewpoint in halophyte-psammophyte vegetation and foredune zone in preserved areas of Restinga de Maricá, a sand dune environment in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The foredune zone showed the highest diversity, richness and equitability of springtail species. Differences in the fundamental, <b>accessory</b> and accidental <b>species</b> in each environment were encountered. Paraxenylla piloua was found to be an indicator species of the halophyte-psammophyte vegetation, while Friesea reducta, Pseudachorutes difficilis and Xenylla maritima were indicators of the foredune zone.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{complete}} 6, 530, 228 -bp genome {{sequence of the}} symbiotic nitrogen fixing bacterium Rhizobium etli. Six large plasmids comprise one-third of the total genome size. The chromosome encodes most functions necessary for cell growth, whereas few essential genes or complete metabolic pathways are located in plasmids. Chromosomal synteny is disrupted by genes related to insertion sequences, phages, plasmids, and cell-surface components. Plasmids do not show synteny, and their orthologs are mostly shared by <b>accessory</b> replicons of <b>species</b> with multipartite genomes. Some nodulation genes are predicted to be functionally related with chromosomal loci encoding for the external envelope of the bacterium. Several pieces of evidence suggest an exogenous origin for the symbiotic plasmid (p 42 d) and p 42 a. Additional putative horizontal gene transfer events might have contributed to expand the adaptive repertoire of R. etli, because they include genes involved in small molecule metabolism, transport, and transcriptional regulation.

40|$|Results {{about the}} effects of {{thinning}} and mixed plantations with Italian alder (Alnus cordata Loisel.) on growth and efficiency of common walnut (Juglans regia L.) plantations for wood production are reported. The study, carried out for six years on sixteen year old plantations, compared three theses: pure common walnut plantation (pure common walnut); 50 % common walnut - 50 % Italian alder plantation; 25 % common walnut - 75 % Italian alder plantation. Beyond annual surveys of girth at breast height, total height, stem volume and biomass, several variables, useful to describe canopy and foliage characteristics such as leaf area index (LAI), leaf biomass and photosynthetic active radiation below the canopy, were recorded. Data collected allowed to compare growth at individual and whole stand level, to calculate the net assimilation rate (NAR) and to compare the growth efficiency of the three theses. Mixed plantations performed results significantly higher than the pure plantation in terms of growth, LAI and leaf biomass both before and after experimental thinning. With reference only to common walnut, growth in mixed plantations was higher than the pure plantation with differences ranging from + 40 % to + 100 %. More relevant differences among pure common walnut, 50 % common walnut and 25 % common walnut at canopy and foliage characteristics were observed, with LAI values of 1. 07, 3. 96 e 4. 35 m 2 m- 2 respectively. Results accounted for a general positive effect of Italian alder as <b>accessory</b> tree <b>species</b> on growth and efficiency of mixed plantations, mainly due to the good performances induced in common walnut trees. Such performances were enabled by the good ecological integration between the two species and by the positive effects of N-fixing activity of Italian alder.

In addition, they had positive effects on common walnut growth and especially on radial increment, a very important matter being common walnut the target species with a very appreciated and valuable wood...|$|R

The study covered oats cultivated on plots after potatoes (in crops rotation system with 25 % share of oats) and twice after oats (75 % share of oats in the rotation system) during the years 1990 - 2000. Simpson's species domination ratio and domination structure in the association identifying groups of: dominants, subdominants, influents and <b>accessory</b> <b>species,</b> were computed and studied. Relations between the studied phytocenosis features and weather conditions and oats yield were also determined. It was shown that quantitative relations in the assessed competitor associations were characterized by high variability between years and vegetation periods while no major {{differences were found between}} positions in the crop rotation systems. The density of spring phytocenosis during 11 years of studies increased resulting from increasing numbers of weeds appearing; during the late vegetation period they changed the density of associations slightly. In the spring, the groups competitive to the group of dominants consisted usually of the crop and Thlaspi arvense as well as Chenopodium album; with the passage of years their position strengthened. The enrichment of species in phytocenosis was represented mainly by an increase in numbers of <b>accessory</b> <b>species.</b> At the end of vegetation the importance of oats as a dominant increased significantly; during some seasons Chenopodium album co-dominated, however, with the passage of years the group of subdominants grew. Domination ratios for the studied competitor groups decreased with the passage of years, parallel to decrease of oats share in them. The studied features of phytocenosis showed a stronger correlation to the passage of years than the weather development. Invasiveness of weeds increased during consecutive seasons of cultivation while it showed less correlation with the density of oats. Oats yields showed a slight decreasing trend from year to year and was highly determined by the density of the entire weeds assemblage and in the spring by density and share of dominating species...|$|E

40|$|AbstractCryphonectria parasitica hypovirus 3 -Grand Haven 2 (CHV 3 -GH 2) is {{the most}} {{recently}} characterized member of the Hypoviridae family of viruses associated with hypovirulence of the chestnut blight fungus. Isolates of CHV 3 -GH 2 contain either three or four double-stranded (ds) RNAs that are visible on ethidium bromide-stained agarose or polyacrylamide gels. Only the largest dsRNA appears to be required for virus infectivity, and was characterized previously (C. D. Smart et al., 1999, Virology 265, 66 – 73). In this study, we report the cloning, sequencing, {{and analysis of the}} other three dsRNAs. Sizes of the accessory dsRNAs are 3. 6 kb (dsRNA 2), 1. 9 kb (dsRNA 3), and 0. 9 kb (dsRNA 4), compared to 9. 8 kb for the genomic dsRNA segment (dsRNA 1). All three <b>accessory</b> dsRNA <b>species</b> are polyadenylated on the 3 ′-end of one strand, as is genomic dsRNA. DsRNA 2 represents a defective form of dsRNA 1, with the 5 ′-terminal 1. 4 kb derived from the 5 ′-end of dsRNA 1 and the 3 ′-terminal 2. 2 kb from the 3 ′-end of dsRNA 1. A single major open reading frame (ORF) is evident from deduced translations of dsRNA 2. The deduced translation product is a 91 -kDa protein that represents a fusion consisting of the entire N-terminal protease and the entire putative helicase domain. DsRNAs 3 and 4 represent satellite RNAs that share very little sequence with dsRNA 1 and 2. DsRNA 4 is 937 nucleotides, excluding the poly(A) +. The first AUG of the polyadenylated strand of dsRNA 4 occurs eight residues in from the 5 ′-terminus and would initiate the largest ORF on dsRNA 4, with the coding capacity for a 9. 4 -kDa protein. Within the deduced ORF and approximately 100 nucleotides from the 5 ′-end of dsRNA 4 is a 22 -base sequence that is identical to sequences found in the nontranslated leaders of dsRNAs 1 and 2. DsRNA 3 accumulation in infected cultures varied, but it was less abundant than dsRNA 4. DsRNA 3 was found to represent a head-to-tail dimer of dsRNA 4 linked by a poly(A) /(U) stretch of 40 – 70 residues...|$|R
40|$|Sperm {{number and}} male {{accessory}} gland compounds are often important determinants of male mating success {{but have been}} little studied in social insects. This is because mating in social insects {{is often difficult to}} manipulate experimentally, and first evidence for an explicit influence of accessory gland secretions on male mating success in social insects was obtained only recently. Here we perform a comparative analysis of male sexual organs across 11 species of attine fungus-growing ants, representing both genera with single- and multiple-queen mating. We found that the general morphology of the male sexual organs was very similar across all species, but the relative sizes of the accessory glands and the sperm-containing accessory testes vary significantly across species. Small testes and large <b>accessory</b> glands characterize <b>species</b> with singly mated queens, whereas the opposite is found in species with multiply mated queens. However, in the social parasite Acromyrmex insinuator, in which queens have secondarily reverted to single mating, males have accessory gland characteristics reminiscent of the lower attine ants, but without having significantly reduced their investment in sperm production. We hypothesize that the main function of accessory gland compounds in attine ants is to monopolize male paternity in similar ways as known from other social insects. This would imply that the evolution of polyandry in the terminal clade of the fungus-growing ants (the leafcutter ants) has resulted in selection for decreased investment by males in accessory gland secretions and increased investment in sperm number, in response to sperm competition for sperm storage.

40|$|Social {{behaviour}} in {{the form}} of parental care is widespread among insects but the evolutionary histories of these traits are poorly known {{due to the lack of}} detailed life history data and reliable phylogenies. Treehoppers (Hemiptera: Membracidae) provide some of the best studied examples of parental care in insects in which maternal care involving egg guarding occurs frequently. The Membracinae exhibit the entire range of social behaviour found in the treehoppers, ranging from asocial solitary individuals, nymphal or adult aggregations, to highly developed maternal care with parent–offspring communication. Within the subfamily, subsocial behaviour occurs in at least four of the five tribes. The Aconophorini and Hoplophorionini are uniformly subsocial, but the Membracini is a mixture of subsocial and gregarious species. The Hypsoprorini contains both solitary and gregarious <b>species.</b> <b>Accessory</b> secretions are used by many treehoppers to cover egg masses inserted into plant tissue while oviposition on plant surfaces is restricted to a few species. Presumed aposematic colouration of nymphs and teneral adults appears to be restricted to gregarious and subsocial taxa. Ant mutualism is widespread among membracine treehoppers and may play an important role in the evolutionary development of subsocial behaviour. The life history information provides a basis for comparative analyses of maternal care evolution and its correlation with ant mutualism in membracine treehoppers. The results show that there is a strong phylogenetic component to the evolution of maternal care in membracine treehoppers, and provide the first quantitative evidence of correlated evolution of maternal care and ant mutualism in treehoppers.

40|$|Group 2 coronaviruses encode an <b>accessory</b> {{envelope}} glycoprotein <b>species,</b> the hemagglutinin esterase (HE), which possesses sialate-O-acetylesterase activity and which, presumably, promotes virus spread and entry in vivo by facilitating reversible virion attachment to O-acetylated sialic acids. While HE {{may provide a}} strong selective advantage during natural infection, many laboratory strains of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) fail to produce the protein. Apparently, their HE genes were inactivated during cell culture adaptation. For this report, we have studied the molecular basis of this phenomenon. By using targeted RNA recombination, we generated isogenic recombinant MHVs which differ exclusively in their expression of HE and produce either the wild-type protein (HE+), an enzymatically inactive HE protein (HE 0), or no HE at all. HE expression or the lack thereof {{did not lead to}} gross differences in in vitro growth properties. Yet the expression of HE was rapidly lost during serial cell culture passaging. Competition experiments with mixed infections revealed that this was not due to the enzymatic activity: MHVs expressing HE+ or HE 0 propagated with equal efficiencies. During the propagation of recombinant MHV-HE+, two types of spontaneous mutants accumulated. One produced an anchorless HE, while the other had a Gly-to-Trp substitution at the predicted C-terminal residue of the HE signal peptide. Neither mutant incorporated HE into virion particles, suggesting that wild-type HE reduces the in vitro propagation efficiency, either at the assembly stage or at a postassembly level. Our findings demonstrate that the expression of “luxury” proteins may come at a fitness penalty. Apparently, under natural conditions the costs of maintaining HE are outweighed by the benefits...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} of the seminal receptacles and associated accessory pouches in the reproductive tracts of four species of Australian ovoviviparous peripatopsids is described to identify features that may relate to their inferred mode of insemination. "Euperipatoides rowelli" is a dermal inseminator whereas "Phallocephale tallagandensis", "Ruhbergia bifalcata" and "Cephalofovea clandestina", species with head structures in males, {{are considered to be}} vaginal inseminators. Contrary to our expectations, "E. rowelli", "R. bifalcata" and "C. clandestina" have very similar seminal receptacles and display two types of accessory pouches: funnel accessory pouches that open to the haemocoel and spherical accessory pouches in which destruction of excess sperm occurs. On the other hand, "Ph. tallagandensis" differs in the form of its accessory pouches. Although these pouches have no direct opening into the haemocoel, sperm were observed in the act of directly penetrating their walls to gain entry from the haemocoel. Hence, despite differences in the form of their <b>accessory</b> pouches, all <b>species</b> display features that provide the potential for entry of sperm into the female reproductive tract from the haemocoel. This finding has caused us to reconsider our initial assumptions of vaginal and dermal insemination as mutually exclusive reproductive strategies. Indeed, we propose that species of peripatopsids with head structures in males that were considered to be obligate vaginal inseminators may in fact be facultative, with vaginal insemination of sexually immature females when their uterus is short and free of developing embryos followed by dermal insemination to maintain the level of sperm in storage in the seminal receptacles. This study has also provided morphological evidence for mechanisms that may facilitate female control of paternity. 12 page(s...|$|R

Of this total, fourty-eight species were collected in the Cerrado, twenty-one exclusively in this environment, forty-two in riparian forest, fifteen being exclusive to this environment, and twenty-seven species were sampled in both environments. From the total of sampled species, thirty-five were considered rare, eight <b>accessory</b> <b>species,</b> and twenty constant species. Prepona deiphile deiphile (Charaxine) is classified as vulnerable on the Minas Gerais&# 8217; list and on the national list of threatened species. The collector curve showed no clear trend to stabilization, suggesting that there are species still not sampled in the study area. Adding the data from field sampling to the information on species occurrence in the literature and in entomological collections, the current number of frugivorous butterflies species for the region of Belo Horizonte is 104. This result foregrounds the importance of APE Mutuca for maintaning a rich fauna of frugivorous butterflies to the area...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results obtained from applying an objective classification method to the daily commercial landings data of the Spanish bottom-trawl fishery off the Gulf of Cádiz for defining mixed-species fisheries or fishing trip types. Definition of these operational fisheries {{was based on the}} relatively unique and homogeneous species composition of the landings and technical characteristics of the vessels. The method was based on cluster (CA) and linear discriminant (DA) analysis techniques. The application of CA techniques to the 1993 data matrix of daily catch per unit of effort per species and active vessel resulted in the identification of 22 types of fishing trips, which were defined by the relative importance of their target and <b>accessory</b> <b>species.</b> Subsequently, different linear discriminant functions were derived for each FTT in order to classify new records. Five different fleet types were also identified through CA techniques according to the vessel’s length, GTR and HP. The distribution of active vessels by fleet type in each landing port showed a great local and regional heterogeneity of the fleets exploiting the multispecies fishery. A correspondance analysis between types of fleets and fishing trips showed a high correlation, indicating the existence of a direct relationship between the capacity of vessel mobility and the bathymetric situation of the fisheries.

40|$|Accessory {{costs of}} {{reproduction}} {{are those that}} are necessary to mature a seed, but that do not involve the direct cost of provisioning the seed itself. This study aims to quantify accessory costs in a range of species, and test whether they decrease as a proportion of total reproductive expenditure with increasing seed mass, as might be expected if economies of scale came into play at larger seed sizes. We also test whether accessory costs varied with growth form, pollination mode, and dispersal mode, with the expectation that biotic pollination and dispersal modes should incur greater costs. Reproductive allocation (dry biomass) over one season, was calculated for 14 diclinous angiosperm <b>species.</b> <b>Accessory</b> costs averaged 73 % of total reproductive allocation, with the majority spent on packaging and dispersal. Total accessory costs, packaging and dispersal costs, and costs incurred prior to pollination were proportional to direct costs of reproduction in major axis regressions. However, larger seeded species incurred significantly greater costs associated with aborted seeds and fruits, and matured a smaller proportion of ovules. This is consistent with larger seeded species being more selective of the ovules/embryos matured than small-seeded <b>species.</b> Total <b>accessory</b> costs, and proportion of ovules aborted, were also significantly greater for biotically dispersed species, but only due to an association with larger seed masses. Costs associated with abortions were lower for biotically pollinated species, due to a general trend of more ovules per ovary, resulting in greater cost sharing. This study demonstrates that expenditure on items other than seeds accounts for the majority of reproductive allocation in flowering plants. Yet, far more literature exists on seed mass variation than on investment in accessory structures. We found a proportional relationship between accessory costs and seed mass that warrants further investigation within the context of selection on margin returns on investment. 8 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Bacterial genomes are mosaic {{structures}} {{composed of}} genes present in every {{strain of the}} same species (core genome), and genes present in some but not all strains of a <b>species</b> (<b>accessory</b> genome). The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the genetic diversity of core and accessory genes of a Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhimurium (Typhimurium) population isolated from food-animal and human sources in four regions of Mexico. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and macrorestriction fingerprints by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) were used to address the core genetic variation, and genes involved in pathogenesis and antibiotic resistance were selected to evaluate the accessory genome. Results We found a low genetic diversity for both housekeeping and accessory genes. Sequence type 19 (ST 19) was supported as the founder genotype of STs 213, 302 and 429. We found a temporal pattern in which the derived ST 213 is replacing the founder ST 19 in the four geographic regions analyzed and a geographic trend in the number of resistance determinants. The distribution of the accessory genes was not random among chromosomal genotypes. We detected strong associations among the different accessory genes and the multilocus chromosomal genotypes (STs). First, the Salmonella virulence plasmid (pSTV) was found mostly in ST 19 isolates. Second, the plasmid-borne betalactamase cmy- 2 was found only in ST 213 isolates. Third, the most abundant integron, IP- 1 (dfrA 12, orfF and aadA 2), was found only in ST 213 isolates. Fourth, the Salmonella genomic island (SGI 1) was found mainly in a subgroup of ST 19 isolates carrying pSTV. The mapping of accessory genes and multilocus genotypes on the dendrogram derived from macrorestiction fingerprints allowed the establishment of genetic subgroups within the population. Conclusion Despite the low levels of genetic diversity of core and accessory genes, the non-random distribution of the accessory genes across chromosomal backgrounds allowed us to discover genetic subgroups within the population. This study provides information about the importance of the accessory genome in generating genetic variability within a bacterial population. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The hippolytid genus Lysmata is {{characterized}} by simultaneous hermaphroditism, a very rare sexual system among Decapoda. Specialized cleaning behavior is reported in a few pair-living species; these life history traits vary within the genus. Unfortunately, the systematics of Lysmata and the Hippolytidae itself are in contention, {{making it difficult to}} examine these taxa for trends in life history traits. A phylogeny of Lysmata and related taxa is needed, to clarify their evolutionary relationships and the origin of their unique sexual pattern. In this study, we present a molecular phylogenetic analysis among species of Lysmata, related genera, and several putative hippolytids. The analysis is based upon DNA sequences of two genes, 16 S mtDNA and nuclear 28 S rRNA. Phylogenetic trees were estimated using Bayesian Inference, Maximum Likelihood, and Maximum Parsimony. Results Phylogenetic analysis of 29 species of Lysmata, eight genera of Hippolytidae and two genera of Barbouriidae based on a single (16 S, 28 S) and combined gene approach (16 S+ 28 S) indicates that three groups of Lysmata differentiate according to antennular morphology: (1) Lysmata, having a multi-segmented accessory branch, (2) Hippolysmata (prior to Chace 1972), with a one-segmented accessory branch, and (3) a third group of Lysmata outliers, with one-segmented unguiform accessory branch, and close affinity to the genera Exhippolysmata and Lysmatella. The monophyly of the clade bearing a multi-segmented accessory branch is robust. Within the short <b>accessory</b> branch clade, <b>species</b> with specialized cleaning behaviors form a monophyletic clade, however, the integrity of the clade was sensitive to alignment criteria. Other hippolytid and barbouriid genera used in the analysis are basal to these three groups, including one displaying simultaneous hermaphroditism (Parhippolyte). The two barbouriid species occur in a separate clade, but among hippolytid taxa. Conclusions The data support the historical morphological division of Lysmata into clades based on accessory branch morphology. The position of the "cleaner" shrimps, indicates that specialized cleaning behavior is a derived trait. The topologies of the cladograms support the monophyly of the barbouriids, but do not support their elevation to familial status. Taxa ancestral to the genus Lysmata display simultaneous hermaphroditism, suggesting that this life history trait evolved outside the genus Lysmata. </p...|$|R
40|$|High {{resolution}} {{analyses of}} fossil benthic foraminiferal assemblages {{have been performed}} on two short (< 40 em) sediment cores from the deep Skagerrak Basin, NE North Sea. 210 Pb-datings of replicate cores from the same two stations {{have made it possible}} to calculate accumulation rates of both sediments and benthic foraminiferal tests, and the vertical (historical) assemblage distributions are compared with sediment surface assemblages collected in 1937 and 1992 / 93. The core data show that the accumulation rate of agglutinated tests was relatively constant from about 1770 to 1940 - 1950 and that it has increased about 5 - 6 times since the late 1960 's compared to average pre- 1940 values. This increase is due mainly to increased production in the 4 agglutinated species Haplophragmoides bradyi, Eggerelloides medius, Saccammina spp., and Trochamminopsis pusillus, of which the last 2 were present only as <b>accessory</b> <b>species</b> before the 1960 's. The 3 calcareous species Pullenia osloensis, Nonionella iridea, and Cassidulina laevigata, which dominated the dead assemblages prior to the early 1970 's, all show subsequent reduced accumulation rates. Despite possible errors caused by postmortem destruction of some agglutinated components, their overall preservation seems to be good enough to reflect the rea l faunal conditions {{over the last couple of}} centuries. The faunal development, as reflected by the core data, is in good agreement with the conclusions based on the comparative study of surface assemblages collected in 1937 and 1992 / 93. That is, the benthic foramini feral assemblages in the deep Skagerrak Basin have changed, and according to the core data, these changes have occurred primarily since the early 1970 's...|$|E
30|$|This {{study showed}} that KMC-IMBG 1 is quite {{flexible}} and variable community. The main highlight {{of this study was}} that KMC-IMBG 1 grown on different sterile and non-sterile media produced a stable core microbiome comprising acetobacteria and few associated strains of yeast species, and a number of <b>accessory</b> <b>species,</b> {{which may or may not}} occur at different conditions. The core part of KMC-IMBG 1 probably is critical for functioning of the whole community and might be responsible for recovery of the community after disturbance. In addition to prevalent community members, several minor but permanently occurring bacterial species of KMC-IMBG 1 were also discovered. Among them there were Herbaspirillum spp. and Halomonas spp. These organisms were identified by binning the DNA reads originated from KMC grown in sterile and non-sterile media. In other studies on species composition of kombucha from North American and Ireland ecotypes these species were not reported (Marsh et al. 2014). Another disagreement with the report by Marsh et al. (2014) was that according to these authors the highest diversity of micro-flora was associated with the cellulose pellicle. In Figure  4 c, d it is seen in rarefication curves of the hybrid KMC-IMBG 1 that both fungal and bacterial micro-flora of pellicle was more stable and less rich in different species than that from the liquid phase. Further research is needed to uncover the role of the core and accessory members of KMC, including the uncultivable bacteria, and how they contribute to stabilizing the community and gaining its biologically active. The ability to modify KMC is of practical importance as a possible approach to improve the medicinal and biotechnological properties of the kombucha products (Kozyrovska et al. 2012). This work is the promising first step to design efficient and safe probiotics and synbiotics based on synthetic KMC communities of beneficial and harmless microbial species. It was hypothesized that the positive activity of kombucha probiotic on human health may be improved and extended by ‘domestication’ in the kombucha of other probiotic bacteria, e.g., lactobacilli, which in the current study most likely were recruited by KMC from the cabbage brine. There is still much to be discovered about bacteria-yeast communal interrelationships and their impact on the human microbiota. It also may be concluded that the DNA metabarcoding based on NGS is the best choice for profiling of complex microbial communities of fermented products.|$|E
40|$|The "nummulite bank" is an {{accumulation}} of nummulite tests, mainly monospecific, with both microspheric and megalospheric generations of the same species. Moreover, it usually contains more tests of larger B forms {{as compared with the}} normal nummulite-bearing limestones. Previous works on nummulite banks have resulted in the proposition of two models. The first, by Arni, suggests that nummulite test accumulations form autochthonous or in-situ banks acting as an effective barrier, analogous to present-day coral reefs. On the other hand Aigner, based upon several evidences of physical transportation shown in sedimentary structure and biofabrics of Nummulites deposits, considered them as allochthonous. So far there is no quantitative data available about the taxonomic composition of nummulite banks. Here we present the preliminary results of a quantitative examination on a case-study from the Middle Eocene of Northern Italy. The samples were collected in Pederiva di Grancona (Vicenza Province, Veneto area). The Nummulites lyelli from this well-known site were described and figured by Schaub in his monograph. The present work is based upon the preliminary examination of 50 grams from a washed sample of the nummulite bank. In this fraction, 509 individuals (A forms) of Nummulites have been counted. The dominant species is N. lyelli accounting for approximately 77. 1 %, followed by N. striatus with 10. 5 %. The rest are the <b>accessory</b> <b>species</b> including N. biarritzensis (5. 9 %), N. discorbinus (4. 9 %), and N. beaumonti (1. 6 %). According to the dominance of N. lyelli and the stratigraphic distribution of the other Nummulites species the sample is assigned to the SBZ 17 (early Bartonian). N. lyelli A in this sample has a mean diameter of 5. 75 mm, whereas that of N. striatus Ais 4. 20 mm. The two most abundant species display a clear difference in size: N. lyelli mean diameter exceeds about + 37 % in comparison with N. striatus. Given that N. lyelli is also more inflated than N. striatus, they probably had a quite different hydrodynamic behaviour. The taxonomic composition of the bank in this case study shows that it is not strictly monospecific, as in the models from the literature: even if there is a strong dominance of N. lyelli, N. striatus cannot be discarded as negligible. Moreover, there are three more species of the same genus which are present in significant percentages, pointing to an unexpectedly rich nummulite assemblage. This in turn casts serious doubts on the allochthonous model for nummulite bank accumulations...|$|E
40|$|Gyponini {{has a wide}} {{distribution}} in the Americas and high abundance in plum orchards in southern Brazil. However, {{there is not much}} information regarding the economic importance and potential as vectors of microorganisms for the culture of plum. The {{purpose of this study was}} to perform the faunistic analysis of Gyponini in two plum orchards, variety ?Letícia?. The orchards are located in the municipality of Videira, state of Santa Catarina, Brazil (orchard # 1 - 27 º 03 ? 18 ??S; 51 º 08 ? 46 ??O, orchard # 2 - 27 º 02 ? 05 ??S; 51 º 08 ? 57 ??O). Each area contains 1 hectare and plants aged 10 years. Sampling was carried out from December 2010 to December 2012 using yellow sticky cards (8. 5 x 11. 5 cm), installed in 10 equidistant points (35 x 35 m). At each point, two traps were installed and replaced monthly; low (B) at 0. 5 m above the ground and high (A) at 1. 7 m above the ground. Eleven species belonging to Gyponini were identified: Curtara sp. (13), C. samera (3), Gypona sp. (14), G. acuta (9), G. parvula (5), G. sellata (2), G. stalina (1), G. validana (1), Polana sp. (3), Reticana lineata (1) and Sordana sordida (1). A total of 53 individuals were collected in the orchards. The highest rate of capture has occurred in the trap B, totaling 31 specimens, and only 22 individuals on the trap A. The dominant species were Curtara sp., Gypona sp., G. acuta and G. parvula with respective frequencies of 24. 53 %, 26. 43 %, 17 % and 9. 43 %. There was no occurrence of constant <b>species,</b> only <b>accessory</b> and accidental <b>species.</b> Curtara sp. and G. acuta were caught predominantly in the lower traps. G. parvula showed higher capture rate in traps located in the upper part of plant canopy and Gypona sp. showed a similar distribution among the different heights. It is emphasized that this collecting method allowed identifying the most active species in relation to the stratum of the culture, as well as the abundance of the group in the orchards. 201...|$|R
40|$|Mass coral {{spawning}} {{represents a}} nutrient input to coral reef systems that for Pacific reefs {{has been shown}} to stimulate pelagic and benthic processes. If phytoplankton in the water column over the reef are able to utilize this annual nutrient input, this could potentially alter phytoplankton biomass and community composition, in what is normally a very oligotrophic system. Sampling was performed at East Flower Garden Bank (EFGB), Gulf of Mexico during May, July, and August 2009. The annual coral spawning event occurred there August 11 - 14, 2009. Samples were collected morning and evening at three depths and analyzed for nutrients, chlorophyll a, <b>accessory</b> pigments, phytoplankton <b>species</b> composition, and carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen (CHN). During spawning, only small changes in nutrient concentrations were detected. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) peaked {{on the second day of}} spawning and N:P ratio was highest on 5 / 28, likely due to particularly phosphate concentration. Chl a biomass was significantly different between sample dates and the biomass increased steadily throughout the spawning period. The contribution of different phytoplankton classes to total chlorophyll a was determined using known pigment algorithms. Prokaryotes were the dominant class across the entire sampling period with 60 - 80 percent abundance. Trichodesmium spp. was the dominant genus throughout the study and genus specific changes per sample date were seen. On 8 / 11 and 8 / 13 two genera contributed the majority of chl a (Trichodesmium spp. and Ceratium spp.; Cylindrotheca spp. and Trichodesmium spp., respectively). Abundance showed variability during spawning with a peak at 11 cells/ml on 8 / 12. The high abundance of Trichodesmium spp. could indicate N limitation is alleviated at the Flower Garden Banks (FGB). Current literature on coral spawning is limited to studies performed in the Great Barrier Reef, with assessment areas close to a major shoreline. Genera found at EFGB were similar to those found in other reef systems. It cannot be determined if nutrient input increased diversity, as diversity was high prior to spawning as well. Greater increase in available forms of nitrogen would have likely been found several days post major spawning. The FGB were a unique system to study, as they are coral reefs, but are located 200 km offshore. This study provided a snapshot into phytoplankton dynamics as a result of spawning. Changes across the short time scale were seen in biomass and community composition...|$|R
40|$|The {{well-known}} genus Nummulites {{flourished in}} the stable, oligotrophic environments of Eocene. During this time, peculiar monospecific accumulations called nummulite banks (Arni, 1965) developed. The paleoenvironmental interpretation of these banks is still debated. So far, several studies deal with nummulite banks but their quantitative aspects were neglected. Here we present new quantitative observations useful to better define the nummulite bank concept. Samples were collected from Pederiva di Grancona (N. lyelli bank) and San Germano dei Berici (N. fabianii bank; both in the Berici Mts., northern Italy). According to the Shallow Benthic Zonation of Serra Kiel et al. (1998) the Pederiva bank is referred to the SBZ 17 (Early Bartonian), and the San Germano bank to the SBZ 19 (Early Priabonian). In both cases there is a bimodal grain size distribution of microspheres and megalospheres of Nummulites in a fine-grained matrix, giving rise to a packstone texture. In Pederiva, 1448 Nummulites isolated specimens (A-forms) were counted and identified at the species level. Among them 1082 individuals are Nummulites lyelli, so 74. 7 % of the identified assemblage. Nummulites striatus is the second most-abundant species with the 11. 5 %, and the rest are the three <b>accessory</b> <b>species</b> N. discorbinus, N. biarritzensis, N. beaumonti. In the San Germano bank, 2043 isolated A-forms of Nummulites were counted and identified at the species level. Among them, 1742 are Nummulites fabianii, which means 85. 3 % of the assemblage. The second most-abundant species is Nummulites stellatus, accounting for 10. 6 % of the assemblage. The rest of the assemblage is made by small, lenticular Nummulites (N. incrassatus, N. chavannesi, N. cunialensis and N. garnieri). On polished surfaces of two samples from San Germano and Pederiva, two areas (38 and 76 cm 2 respectively) were observed to count all the visible specimens of Nummulites in order to calculate the A/B ratio. The “normal” A/B ratio usually reported in literature is 10 : 1. However, our {{results show that the}} A/B ratio in the banks varies from 28 to 42, whereas in “normal” nummulitic limestones it varies from 86 to 348. Therefore, in the nummulite banks the A-forms are still dominant but the number of B-forms is unusually high. The San Germano and Pederiva banks are both monospecific assemblages, with one species accounting for about 75 - 85 % of the individuals, and relatively low A/B ratio. This is consistent with the definition of nummulite bank by Arni (1965). However, there are some differences probably related to different paleoenvironmental settings: in Pederiva, apart for Nummulites {{there are only a few}} Discocyclina, whereas in San Germano the coralline algae and bivalves are accompanied by a few Discocyclina.
