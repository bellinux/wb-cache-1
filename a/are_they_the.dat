The CEO Lewis Horne said “When people sell electric cars, the motivation is sustainability. So, why are they so heavy, and why <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>the</b> same cars? Where you just take out petrol and you put in the huge battery and you call it sustainable. But it’s not.”. The company has been designing a car that uses sustainable and recycled material such as bio-composite to reduce the footprint of the car during production. In addition, the fully automated factory provided in partnership with Siemens will be able to work with the lights turned off during 22h per day to save energy.|$|E

2500|$|For decades β-blockers {{have been}} used in {{cardiovascular}} medicine. They have proved to reduce morbidity and mortality. In acute coronary syndrome, β-blockers have been recommended as a class I-A indication in clinical practice guidelines, because the treatment decreases the mortality rate. β-blockers, along with calcium channel blockers, reduce the workload of the heart and its oxygen requirement. β-blockers are sometimes used in a combination therapy to treat angina, if a β-blocker doesn't work well enough on its own. They are used as anti-arrhythmic drugs in patients with hyperthyroidism, cardiac dysrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter and ventricular tachycardia. The treatment with β-blockers reduces the incidence of sudden heart failure when the patient has already had a myocardial infarction. The reason is probably because of their anti-arrhythmic effects and also anti-ischemic effects. [...] A β-blocker therapy is also useful in myocardial infarction, independent to heart failure. The therapy has been very helpful for high-risk patients. [...] All β-blockers are able to lower blood pressure and therefore <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>the</b> first choice of drugs for hypertension. But if they are used along with calcium channel blockers, β-blockers have more functionality. They also have an effect on cardiomyopathy, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and portal hypertension, to name a few.|$|E

[...] Meghan Brownfield for the Columbia Missourian praised the song as a track which people will want to dance to as well as writing that the lyrics ensure that the listener pays attention to the lyrics, saying [...] "It is a song you would hear in a club that everyone would want to dance to.

2500|$|On October 31, 2000 the University of Pennsylvania Museum and Yale University Expedition to Abydos, Egypt {{issued a}} press release in which they {{described}} {{the discovery of the}} royal solar boats at Abydos. [...] At a site a mile distant from the royal tombs, lines of mud brick uncovered by blowing sand were first noticed in 1988. [...] Although the Abydos boats are not the oldest boat remains to be discovered in Egypt, nor <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>the</b> world's first boats as is sometimes proclaimed, they are extremely important to the history of boat design and nautical architecture. Understandably, these brick remains at Abydos were first thought to be walls. In 1991, an important clarification was made. A research consensus decided these bricks were remnants of ancient walls after all, but not in the usual sense. They were actually the boundaries for more than a dozen ship burials from an early dynasty. Each ship grave had its own brick boundary walls. The outline of each grave was {{in the shape of a}} boat, and the surface of each was covered with mud plaster and white wash. Small boulders at the prow or stern of each grave represented anchors. Because of the fragility of the boat remains, almost no excavation was done initially as the situation had to be carefully studied for future conservation.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2013, CKMP's {{morning show}} held a stunt contest {{entitled}} Bank It or Burn It, in which listeners {{were asked to}} vote via social media on whether $5,000 in cash would be saved, or burned in an incinerator. If a majority of listeners voted to save the money, those who voted in favor would be entered into a contest with the money as a prize. Ultimately, 54% of viewers voted in favour of burning the money, which was presented in a video set to Ellie Goulding's song [...] "Burn". Reaction to the stunt was negative; local charities complained that the money could have been donated instead of burned (and in turn, encouraged listeners to donate themselves), a listener started a petition demanding that CKMP {{be taken off the}} air, and others questioned the legality of the stunt—however, Canadian law only bans the burning of coins, and not paper currency. Morning show host Katie Summers defended the stunt, stating that [...] "Part of me is glad we burned the money. A week ago, all of the same people and all of the same charities in this city were just as in need. Only now, after an awfully tragic social experiment, <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>the</b> forefront of everyone’s mind. Maybe this sparked a conversation we needed to have." [...] In turn, the station announced it would perform a second round of Bank It or Burn It, but with $10,000 instead. This time, listeners voted to save the money; additionally, the station announced that it would donate $10,000 to the Children's Wish Foundation {{in the name of the}} contest's winner.|$|E
