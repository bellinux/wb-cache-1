2500|$|Colonel Patterson, {{in charge}} of the {{anti-aircraft}} artillery for III Corps, described the anti-aircraft defenses as the [...] "million dollar show," [...] because [...] "it cost the <b>American</b> <b>taxpayers</b> a million dollars in antiaircraft ammunition" [...] every time a German aircraft dared attack the bridge.

2500|$|On October 24, 2012, the top federal {{prosecutor}} in Manhattan {{filed a lawsuit}} alleging that Bank of America fraudulently cost <b>American</b> <b>taxpayers</b> more than $1 billion when Countrywide Financial sold toxic mortgages to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The scheme was called 'Hustle', or High Speed Swim Lane. On May 23, 2016 the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the finding of fact by the jury that low quality mortgages were supplied by Countrywide to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the [...] "Hustle" [...] case supported only [...] "intentional breach of contract," [...] not fraud. The action, for civil fraud, relied on provisions of the [...] Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act. The decision turned on lack of intent to defraud {{at the time the}} contract to supply mortgages was made.|$|E
2500|$|The {{program was}} the subject of public {{controversy}} for its cost to <b>American</b> <b>taxpayers.</b> In 1996, the General Accounting Office (GAO) disclosed that the USAF's B-2 bombers [...] "will be, by far, the most costly bombers to operate on a per aircraft basis", costing over three times as much as the B-1B (US$9.6million annually) and over four times as much as the B-52H (US$6.8million annually). In September 1997, each hour of B-2 flight necessitated 119 hours of maintenance in turn. Comparable maintenance needs for the B-52 and the B-1B are 53 and 60 hours respectively for each hour of flight. A key reason for this cost is the provision of air-conditioned hangars large enough for the bomber's [...] wingspan, which are needed to maintain the aircraft's stealthy properties, particularly its [...] "low-observable" [...] stealthy skins. Maintenance costs are about $3.4million a month for each aircraft.|$|E

2500|$|In a {{critique}} by The Future of Freedom Foundation, James Bovard mixes {{history of the}} Peace Corps with current interpretations. He writes that in the 1980s, [...] "The Peace Corps’s world-saving pretensions were a joke on <b>American</b> <b>taxpayers</b> and Third World folks who expected real help." [...] He goes on to criticize the difference in rhetoric and action of Peace Corps volunteers, even attacking its establishment as [...] "the epitome of emotionalism in American politics." [...] Using snippets of reports, accounts of those in countries affected by the Peace Corps and even concluded {{that at one point}} [...] "some Peace Corps agricultural efforts directly hurt Third World poor." [...] At the end of the article, Bovard noted that all Peace Corps volunteers he had talked with conceded they have not helped foreigners ... but he acknowledges that [...] "Some Peace Corps volunteers, like some Americans who volunteer for religion missions abroad, have truly helped foreigners." ...|$|E

We need to utilize and support every movement of dissent against this evil American empire, regardless of which end of the political spectrum it originates from. ...The fact that it's these [...] "lefties" ... who are picking up the ball and running with it – only shows how much more in tune they are with the fed up masses of white workers, than the fossilized, reactionary [...] "right-wing". ...

2500|$|In 1980, {{the costs}} of the Inga-Shaba power line totaled 24% of Congo’s debt, which along with corruption, other {{wasteful}} spending, and bad decision-making, led to a debt crisis and the intervention of foreign experts. [...] As of 1999, Congo still owed the U.S. Export-Import Bank over $900 million, leaving <b>American</b> <b>taxpayers</b> unpaid. [...] As the Inga-Shaba line neared completion in the early 1980s, many news articles poured scorn on the project. [...] One from the Washington Post juxtaposed its failure with a successful Peace Corps project to improve the Congolese diet, noting that, “the grandiose project has so far {{turned out to be a}} white elephant, while the low-key fish-farming endeavor has already made visible improvements in the lives of several thousand people in a similar period of time.” Gécamines, the state-owned mining company in Shaba that was founded in 1906 by the Belgians, ended up still mainly using hydroelectricity supplied locally, and thus the Inga-Shaba line found itself being used at a mere third of capacity. [...] Furthermore, the structure itself has been degraded as local peoples have used its metal bars for a variety of domestic needs.|$|E

2500|$|In the past, I've worried {{openly about}} NATO {{turning into a}} two-tiered alliance: Between members who {{specialize}} in [...] "soft" [...] humanitarian, development, peacekeeping and talking tasks, and those conducting the [...] "hard" [...] combat missions. [...] Between those {{willing and able to}} pay the price and bear the burdens of alliance commitments, and those who enjoy the benefits of NATO membership—be they security guarantees or headquarters billets—but don't want to share the risks and the costs. [...] This is no longer a hypothetical worry. [...] We are there today. [...] And it is unacceptable. The blunt reality {{is that there will be}} dwindling appetite and patience in the U.S. Congress—and in the American body politic writ large—to expend increasingly precious funds on behalf of nations that are apparently unwilling to devote the necessary resources or make the necessary changes to be serious and capable partners in their own defense. [...] Nations apparently willing and eager for <b>American</b> <b>taxpayers</b> to assume the growing security burden left by reductions in European defense budgets. Indeed, if current trends in the decline of European defense capabilities are not halted and reversed, future U.S. political leaders—those for whom the Cold War was not the formative experience that it was for me—may not consider the return on America's investment in NATO worth the cost.|$|E
