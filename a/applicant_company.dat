25|$|Re Fong Thin Choo is an {{administrative}} law case decided in 1991 by the High Court of Singapore concerning {{the legality of}} a demand by the Director-General of Customs and Excise ("DG") that the <b>applicant's</b> <b>company</b> pay S$130,241.30 in customs duty as it had not exported certain goods. The case was presided over by Justice Chan Sek Keong. The Court decided that the DG had failed {{to take into account}} relevant evidence adduced by the <b>applicant's</b> <b>company</b> which could have been capable of rebutting the prima facie evidence of non-export, and had thus made an insufficient inquiry before arriving at his decision. Since the DG's demand had been based on an incorrect basis of fact and thus had been made contrary to law, the Court granted the applicant an order of prohibition that barred the DG from deducting the sum from certain bankers' guarantees that the <b>applicant's</b> <b>company</b> had lodged with Customs as security.|$|R

30|$|A further {{driver of}} the growing {{complexity}} of environmental risk assessment for PPPs lies in the EU Regulation on Plant Protection Products. In {{the event of a}} negative assessment result at a lower assessment tier based on standard data and conservative assumptions, the applicant can use a so-called “refined assessment” to show that no unacceptable environmental impacts of a PPP are to be expected under realistic application conditions. The investment in such a refinement of the risk assessment, e.g., in the form of mathematical models or more complex experimental studies (aquatic mesocosms, and field studies) is usually worthwhile for the <b>applicant</b> <b>company.</b> This is either because {{it is the only way}} to obtain an authorisation or because it makes it possible to avoid stricter requirements for risk management (e.g., concerning margins to adjoining surface water bodies). Refined risk assessment for environmentally critical but heatedly justified PPPs in particular is becoming increasingly complex.|$|E
40|$|The {{principle}} of proportionality {{is considered one of}} the most important contemporary legal principles on which it intends to protect individual citizens against disproportionate action by the authorities. This aroused our interest prior to this study. The essay reveals how such behavior might look like and how courts have chosen to adjudicate in cases where the individual has been discriminated against or subjected to unreasonable demands in public procurement. That section of the law that were current throughout all court cases are Public Procurement Act (2007 : 1097) LOU. That which we have seen in every court case is that the applicant has not received a proper fair chance when the requirements of the contract often been asked in a way that either exclude the smaller <b>applicant</b> <b>company</b> or rule out various potential applicants parties due to excessive and sometimes unnecessary requirements. The consistently demonstrated in the study of court cases is that the authorities in all ten cases have had problems with necessity assessment of the claims shall be made, however, no authority in these cases had any confusions about whether it was appropriate for attaining the objective pursued. Another important discovery along the way has been assessed according to the constituent elements of the Public Procurement Act has been interpreted somewhat differently by different courts. Which may give a distorted picture of the courts positions in just the proportionality assessment. It could even be seen as a lack of legal certainty, the {{principle of}} proportionality is not firmly established through the codification of the current Administration Act but instead occurs scattered over different regions of justice. Study also showed that courts only rely on European law in a few cases despite {{principle of proportionality}} strong roots in Europe...|$|E

30|$|As explained, the {{increasing}} {{complexity of the}} environmental risk assessment of PPPs is to some extent an unavoidable consequence of scientific progress. However, this does not apply for {{the complexity of the}} refined risk assessments for individual PPP enforced by <b>applicant</b> <b>companies.</b> In such cases, the principle of “risk management before risk refinement” offers a suitable way out of the looming complexity dilemma. For a PPP that could already be authorised, all justifiable options for the management of the environmental risks should first be exploited before the authorities approve and accept highly complex refinements of the risk assessment whose only aim is to create more favourable conditions for application of the PPP (e.g., narrower margins to adjacent surface waters).|$|R

Since the company was thus liable to pay import duty on the goods, the DG proceeded to recover the amount of duty from bankers' guarantees that had been lodged by the company with the Customs and Excise Department.

This article introduces the crossover linear modeling (CLM) method and argues that CLM is useful when dealing with multi-level crossover structures by combining the heterogeneities of all levels into one model. The article uses an example in early recruitment research to illustrate the use of CLM in modeling direct effects, cross-level effects, and interaction effects in a crossover data structure. The statistical analysis on an actual data set shows that CLM is able to identify both company-level and applicant-level heterogeneities. The article presents further examples to show that CLM {{can be applied to}} many organizational research settings when multilevel crossover structures are present...|$|R

40|$|This Dissertation {{explores the}} impact of {{employer}} branding strategies on employers in Ireland offering Graduate Programmes. Employer Branding strategies are being increasingly utilised among Irish employers offering Graduate Programmes {{to attract and retain}} valuable employees. Current literary works offer theoretical frameworks around which successful employer branding strategies should be based, although accounts sourced from empirical research is scarce. The exploration took a qualitative approach and 6 interviews were conducted in total. Interviews were held with 5 professionals from different companies, each participant dealing with graduate recruitment in their company. All 5 companies feature on GradIreland’s Top 100 Employer Brand Survey as voted for by students and graduates. A following 6 th interview was conducted with Gavan O’Brien, the Commercial Manager at GradIreland. The research found that graduate employers are seriously leveraging themselves to attract graduates, and are doing to via channels which accommodate the trends of Generation Y. Most participating companies aren’t utilising quantifiable methods to measure the return on EB investment. Instead, intangible means are accessed such as feedback from <b>applicants.</b> <b>Companies</b> also noted that in the last few years, cross sector competition for graduates means that they need to reassess their uniqueness and target it in ways which graduates from a more diverse range of academic backgrounds can access.
