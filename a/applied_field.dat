25|$|In a {{paramagnetic}} material there are unpaired electrons, i.e. atomic or molecular orbitals with exactly one electron in them. While paired electrons {{are required by}} the Pauli exclusion principle to have their intrinsic ('spin') magnetic moments pointing in opposite directions, causing their magnetic fields to cancel out, an unpaired electron is free to align its magnetic moment in any direction. When an external magnetic field is applied, these magnetic moments will tend to align themselves {{in the same direction}} as the <b>applied</b> <b>field,</b> thus reinforcing it.|$|E
25|$|A {{superconductor}} {{with little}} or no magnetic field within it is said to be in the Meissner state. The Meissner state breaks down when the applied magnetic field is too large. Superconductors can be divided into two classes according to how this breakdown occurs. In Type I superconductors, superconductivity is abruptly destroyed when the strength of the <b>applied</b> <b>field</b> rises above a critical value Hc. Depending on the geometry of the sample, one may obtain an intermediate state consisting of a baroque pattern of regions of normal material carrying a magnetic field mixed with regions of superconducting material containing no field. In Type II superconductors, raising the <b>applied</b> <b>field</b> past a critical value H'c1 leads to a mixed state (also known as the vortex state) in which an increasing amount of magnetic flux penetrates the material, but there remains no resistance to the flow of electric current as long as the current is not too large. At a second critical field strength H'c2, superconductivity is destroyed. The mixed state is actually caused by vortices in the electronic superfluid, sometimes called fluxons because the flux carried by these vortices is quantized. Most pure elemental superconductors, except niobium and carbon nanotubes, are TypeI, while almost all impure and compound superconductors are TypeII.|$|E
25|$|Anisotropic induced {{magnetic}} field effects {{are the result}} of a local induced {{magnetic field}} experienced by a nucleus resulting from circulating electrons that can either be paramagnetic when it is parallel to the <b>applied</b> <b>field</b> or diamagnetic when it is opposed to it. It is observed in alkenes where the double bond is oriented perpendicular to the external field with pi electrons likewise circulating at right angles. The induced magnetic field lines are parallel to the external field at the location of the alkene protons which therefore shift downfield to a 4.5ppm to 7.5ppm range. The three-dimensional space where a diamagnetic shift is called the shielding zone with a cone-like shape aligned with the external field.|$|E

40|$|This work {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} tailored, externally-applied magnetic fields on current transport and near-anode processes in the plasma discharge of a magnetoplasmadynamic thruster (MPDT). Electrical and plasma diagnostics {{were used to determine}} whether <b>applied</b> magnetic <b>fields</b> could mitigate the effects of the "onset" phenomena, including large-amplitude terminal voltage fluctuations and high anode fall voltages associated with unstable operation and anode erosion. A new MPDT was developed and operated with quasi-steady 1 ms pulses from 36 kW to 3. 3 MW with argon propellant. Three magnetic configurations studied included self-field operation (without external electromagnets) and two <b>applied</b> poloidal magnetic <b>fields.</b> One configuration used magnetic field lines tangential to the anode lip (and intersecting the anode further upstream) and the other created a magnetic cusp intersecting the anode downstream. The influence of the <b>applied</b> <b>fields</b> on the discharge current streamlines, current densities, and key plasma properties (electron temperature, number density, and plasma potential) was studied. Key findings included that the current pattern and current densities redistributed to follow the <b>applied</b> magnetic <b>field</b> lines. Also, the anode fall voltage was substantially reduced with both <b>applied</b> <b>fields</b> over a large range of currents (and eliminated at 8 kA).

25|$|Para{{magnetism}} {{is a form}} of magnetism whereby certain {{materials are}} weakly attracted by an externally applied magnetic field, and form internal, induced magnetic fields {{in the direction of the}} applied magnetic field. In contrast with this behavior, diamagnetic materials are repelled by magnetic fields and form induced magnetic fields in the direction opposite to that of the applied magnetic field. Paramagnetic materials include most chemical elements and some compounds; they have a relative magnetic permeability slightly greater than 1 (i.e., a small positive magnetic susceptibility) and hence are attracted to magnetic fields. The magnetic moment induced by the <b>applied</b> <b>field</b> is linear in the field strength and rather weak.

25|$|Unlike ferromagnets, paramagnets do not retain any {{magnetization}} in {{the absence}} of an externally applied magnetic field because thermal motion randomizes the spin orientations. (Some paramagnetic materials retain spin disorder even at absolute zero, meaning they are paramagnetic in the ground state, i.e. {{in the absence}} of thermal motion.) Thus the total magnetization drops to zero when the <b>applied</b> <b>field</b> is removed. Even in the presence of the field there is only a small induced magnetization because only a small fraction of the spins will be oriented by the field. This fraction is proportional to the field strength and this explains the linear dependency. The attraction experienced by ferromagnetic materials is non-linear and much stronger, so that it is easily observed, for instance, in the attraction between a refrigerator magnet and the iron of the refrigerator itself.|$|E
25|$|The {{electrons}} {{around a}} nucleus will circulate in {{a magnetic field}} and create a secondary induced magnetic field. This field opposes the <b>applied</b> <b>field</b> as stipulated by Lenz's law and atoms with higher induced fields (i.e., higher electron density) are therefore called shielded, relative to those with lower electron density. The chemical milieu of an atom can influence its electron density through the polar effect. Electron-donating alkyl groups, for example, lead to increased shielding while electron-withdrawing substituents such as nitro groups lead to deshielding of the nucleus. Not only substituents cause local induced fields. Bonding electrons {{can also lead to}} shielding and deshielding effects. A striking example of this are the pi bonds in benzene. Circular current through the hyperconjugated system causes a shielding effect at the molecule's center and a deshielding effect at its edges. Trends in chemical shift are explained based on the degree of shielding or deshielding.|$|E
25|$|A {{metal ion}} {{with a single}} {{unpaired}} electron, such as Cu2+, in a coordination complex provides the simplest illustration of the mechanism of paramagnetism. The individual metal ions are kept far apart by the ligands, {{so that there is}} no magnetic interaction between them. The system is said to be magnetically dilute. The magnetic dipoles of the atoms point in random directions. When a magnetic field is applied, first-order Zeeman splitting occurs. Atoms with spins aligned to the field slightly outnumber the atoms with non-aligned spins. In the first-order Zeeman effect the energy difference between the two states is proportional to the <b>applied</b> <b>field</b> strength. Denoting the energy difference as ΔE, the Boltzmann distribution gives the ratio of the two populations as , where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature in kelvins. In most cases ΔE is much smaller than kT and the exponential can be expanded as 1 – ΔE/kT. It follows from the presence of 1/T in this expression that the susceptibility is inversely proportional to temperature.|$|E
