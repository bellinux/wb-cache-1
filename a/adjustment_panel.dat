Our Blundell-Bond system estimator results show that closeness to intermediates such as low-cost labor and textile production has a positive effect on clothing production.

This is expected, because above a certain level several other sectors benefit even more from closeness and factor endowments, driving resources away from the clothing industry.

Evidence shows that the relation between pay adjustments and performance is related to performance measures, as different measures capture the incentive effect and managerial entrenchment effect in different ways.

40|$|Accurate {{estimation}} of the dominant root of a stationary but persistent time series are required to determine {{the speed at which}} economic time series, such as real exchange rates or interest rates, adjust towards their mean values. In practice, accuracy is hampered by downward small- sample bias. Recursive mean adjustment {{has been found to be}} a useful bias reduction strategy in the regression context. In this paper, we study recursive mean adjustment in dynamic panel data models. When there exists cross-sectional heterogeneity in the dominant root, the recursive mean adjusted SUR estimator is appropriate. When homogeneity restrictions can be imposed, a pooled recursive mean adjusted GLS estimator with fixed e¤ects is the desired estimator. Application of these techniques to a small panel of five eurocurrency rates finds that these interest rates are unit root nonstationary as the bias-corrected autoregressive coefficient exceeds 1.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to advise on two {{separate}} requests concerning reverse slope driveways. One request from Council directs a report to this Committee. The other is from North York Community Council to amend the North York zoning bylaw. A further request involves amending the definition of boarding and lodging house. Both these matters are of city-wide concern being addressed in the city-wide zoning bylaw that is now being prepared. To amend one zoning bylaw and not all the current zoning bylaws that share the issue jeopardizes the City’s ability to defend such an amendment at the Ontario Municipal Board. It will give appellants a convenient argument of inconsistent treatment of similar properties across the City. In addition, appellants will have another opportunity to appeal as each successive existing zoning bylaw is amended. Further, such action will take away staff resources needed to complete the city-wide zoning bylaw work. Amending the existing zoning bylaws is time-consuming work owing {{to the fact that}} there are 43 of them. In addition, should there be an appeal of any one of them, more staff resources will be required to defend the appeals. The early part of 2009 is the target date for producing the draft city-wide bylaw for public consultation.

40|$|Although {{similar to}} {{weighting}} for unit nonresponse in cross-sectional surveys, <b>adjustment</b> for <b>panel</b> nonresponse needs to incorporate information about nonrespondents {{collected in the}} early waves of the panel. We review different weighting <b>adjustments</b> for <b>panel</b> nonresponse and discuss methods for incorporating complex survey design variables into the weighting adjustments. We propose a cross-classified method for panel survey data with complex sampling design by first grouping respondents and nonrespondents with similar estimated response propensities to form response propensity strata and then cross-classifying the response propensity strata with the design variables. Our simulation study shows that when design variables {{are not related to}} nonresponse, the cross-classified method yields survey estimates that have bias and root mean squared error similar to the estimates weighted by reciprocals of the response propensities and the response propensity stratification method. When design variables are related to nonresponse, the crossclassified method yields estimates with smaller bias than both the other two methods if design variables are not included as covariates in the response propensity regression, but is comparable in the bias to the other two methods if the response propensity model is correctly specified. We apply these methods to the Galveston Bay Recovery Study, a panel study of trajectories of wellness in a community following a disaster.

We specify a model of debt adjustments that allows us to investigate the specific nature of the adjustment process towards target debt levels in small firms, which is then extended to account for the effect of financial distress on financial structure decisions. Our models were estimated by the Generalized Method of Moments on a data panel of small Portuguese firms during a period of recession, in which a substantial proportion of the companies analyzed faced a financial distress situation. We find that small firms do adjust their debt ratios towards target levels, the speed of adjustment being faster in the shorter term. Our results also indicate that there are major differences in the determinants of long-term and short-term debt, highlighting the role played by debt maturity in explaining a firm’s finan-cial structure. Finally, random behavior is observed in finan-cially distressed firms, who seem to be disoriented when making their financial structure decisions.

The asymptotic standard normal distribution, which follows when the cross-sectional dimension increases, enables easy calculation of critical values and p-values. Hence, it is of interest to study how large the cross-sectional dimension has to be in order for the normal approximation to be valid for inference. By performing a Monte Carlo simulation, we find that the normal approximation works well, at conventional significance levels, even when the cross-sectional dimension is as small as 2.

The substantial implications of general equilibrium extend beyond the dynamics of aggregate series.
