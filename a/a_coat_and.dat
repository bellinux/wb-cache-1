25|$|Harvey's meals {{were served}} in sumptuous {{portions}} {{that provided a}} good value for the traveling public; for instance, pies were cut into fourths, rather than sixths, which was the industry standard at the time. The Harvey Company and AT established a series of signals that allowed the dining room staff {{to make the necessary}} preparations to feed an entire train in just thirty minutes. Harvey Houses served their meals on fine China and Irish linens. Fred Harvey, a fastidious innkeeper, set high standards for efficiency and cleanliness in his establishments, personally inspecting them as often as possible. It was said that nothing escaped his notice, and he was even known to completely overturn a poorly set table. Male customers were required to wear <b>a</b> <b>coat</b> <b>and</b> tie in many of Harvey's dining rooms. The Harvey Houses served many a meal to GIs traveling on troop trains during World War II.|$|E
25|$|The Boss (real name Gervasius De Statuis, {{also known}} as Big Boss) is Number One's {{right-hand}} man and his second-in-command. Even though he {{is in charge of}} the flower shop while Number One is not around, in reality, he is a lazy, fat and aging TNT agent who tries his best to avoid work. He is at odds with Number One, who despises him for his laziness and inability to perform missions. He usually sleeps in the back of the flower shop, but occasionally joins the other TNT members on large-scale missions. After Bob, he is the most vocal about his salary, but is constantly rebuffed by Number One. His best friend is Jeremiah, but almost constantly bickers with him. He has a hamster named Squitty, and he is very devoted to him and protects him at all costs. He wears old ruptured pants, a bowler hat, <b>a</b> <b>coat</b> <b>and</b> a cardigan stripped shirt.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of World War II, the Marine Corps had four {{standard}} uniforms. Dress Blues could be worn with a white canvas belt, a leather belt, or a blue cloth belt for officers, but their issue ceased in early 1942 except for recruiters and ceremonial units {{for the duration of}} the war. The green winter service uniform, issued with <b>a</b> <b>coat</b> <b>and</b> a shell cordovan garrison belt for enlisted men with a Sam Browne belt for officers (until a cloth belt of the same material replaced both in 1943), was initially worn as a field uniform (such as the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade in Iceland wearing them daily). The garrison cap was reintroduced, originally to be worn overseas, but quickly became standard. The summer khaki service uniform featured pointed pocket flaps, and the trousers had no rear pockets as opposed to the Army's trousers having both front and back pockets. Beginning with a prewar deployment to Guantánamo Bay in early 1941, a fiber pith helmet began to replace the campaign hat worn in tropical areas and by recruits in training, but was eventually phased out as field uniforms were eventually replaced with utilities and helmets in November of that year.|$|E

2500|$|Chief Flying Hawk and {{his family}} did not enjoy the {{benefits}} of white men. His son Felix Flying Hawk, and later his grandson David Flying Hawk, had been cheated and jailed by the white man for stealing their own horses. Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull, his family and friends, had been assassinated. He had been placed on public exhibition as a specimen of the vanishing race to escape the poverty and constraints an Indian reservation. [...] "He stroked his breast {{to show that he}} was poorly dressed. He was still wearing <b>a</b> <b>coat</b> <b>and</b> vest which had been given to him by the host on a previous visit. He said that if he had what was due him from the Government he could dress like other people, and have plenty to eat all the time, much of the time he was hungry and could not buy medicine or go to the doctor when sick." [...] On March 5, 1929, at age seventy-five, Flying Hawk made his last visit to The Wigwam in Du Bois, Pennsylvania. He had been traveling with the circus, and the pony riding, war dances and inclement weather were weighing on his health. The Wigwam was good medicine. [...] At The Wigwam he would could have fresh air, good food, rest and home comforts. Chief Flying Hawk died at Pine Ridge, South Dakota, December 24, 1931, at the age of 77 in want. He had written that during the previous winter of 1930-31 his little band was saved from starvation only through contributions from Gutzon Borglum and the American Red Cross.

2500|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} {{the end of the war}} the Australian Army began to adopt a woollen battle-dress blouse and trousers of the style worn by the British Army, with unit titles and formation patches made of cloth, and berets. Meanwhile, the use of unit colour patches was discontinued with the raising of the Australian Regular Army in 1947, with units and corps instead distinguished by badges, many of which were similar to those worn by their British counterparts. Being a period of transition, in the early part of the Korean War troops usually wore the old service dress, while later they wore the new battle-dress. Regardless, troops in Korea often adopted a mix of whatever British or American equipment was available out of necessity, with an example being cold-weather equipment. Following this time the uniform of the Australian Army has undergone a number of changes, mostly with a trend to increasing [...] "drabness" [...] due to an emphasis on camouflage in combat dress, as well as a reduction in the range of different types of uniform. [...] During operations in Malaya, Borneo and Vietnam in the 1950s to 1970s the Australian Army wore jungle greens. A cloth bush hat (also known as a [...] "giggle-hat") was also worn when in the field. In Vietnam elements of the Special Air Service Regiment (SASR) wore a variety of uniforms including the indigenous [...] "tiger-stripe", but more commonly the US ERDL Camouflage Tropical Combat Uniform. Personnel posted to South Vietnamese units, such as the Australian Army Training Team (AATTV), also often wore local uniforms. Up until the 1960s the style of uniform worn by the Australian Army for general duties wear when not in the field was essentially that of the British Army; however, from this time the [...] "polyester" [...] shirt and trousers was introduced. This was later followed by an Australian version of the British Army service dress which consisted of <b>a</b> <b>coat</b> <b>and</b> trousers. In the early 1970s dress for servicewomen changed to the Australian-style, while in the 1980s they adopted the polyester uniform worn by servicemen (with a skirt added). The distinct Australian slouch hat continued to be worn. Meanwhile, in the 1970s and 1980s the Australian Army continued to mostly use the same field clothing and equipment that they had in Vietnam. Mess dress worn by officers also followed the pattern of that worn by the British Army, and included separate styles for summer and winter.|$|E
