6000|$|... "But {{all through}} the {{mountains}} thunder-riven, [...] And up from the rocky steep, There rose a cry to the gates of heaven, [...] 'Rejoice! I have found my sheep!' And the <b>angels</b> <b>echoed</b> around the throne, 'Rejoice, for the Lord brings back His own!'" ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{representative}} of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's Exploited Child Unit has stated that the NCMEC does not condone investigations by citizens because according to the NCMEC, those actions do not deter predators and can push the predators to move to other locations and become more effective at hiding their identities. [...] The internet safety organization CyberAngels, {{an offshoot of the}} Guardian <b>Angels</b> <b>echoes</b> similar concerns. Police officials in the past have been opposed to working with such groups, or have done so only reluctantly.|$|R
5000|$|The cathedral {{is named}} in honor of the Blessed Virgin Mary under the patronal title of Our Lady of the <b>Angels,</b> <b>echoing</b> the full name of the {{original}} settlement of Los Angeles (El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles, or [...] "The Town of Our Lady the Queen of the Angels"). The cathedral is widely known for enshrining the relics of Saint Vibiana and tilma piece of Our Lady of Guadalupe. It is the mother church to approximately five million professed Catholics in the archdiocese.|$|R

5000|$|Needham's first album, For Freedom, was {{independently}} {{released in}} 2005, {{with the help}} of Troy Warren Jr. He signed with the Christian record label Inpop in 2006, and released his major label debut album, Speak, later that year. In late 2007, Needham toured with NewSong, <b>Echoing</b> <b>Angels</b> and Nate Sallie.|$|R
5000|$|The {{painting}} is on canvas - normally {{he would have}} used wood panel - perhaps for a painting with a dangerous message, canvas had the advantage {{that it could be}} rolled up and hidden. With his canvas prepared he would sketch a detailed design on paper, then he transferred this to canvas. He drew on many sources - the dancing <b>angels</b> <b>echo</b> his own three graces of Primavera, the scurrying devil was inspired by a German woodcut. X-rays show that very little of the original design changed - only an angel's wing was adjusted and trees added over the roof of the stable. Botticelli was now ready to build up the image using tempera paint - the canvas was an experimental medium. To create the heavenly dome Botticelli called on the goldsmith's craft he had learned as a boy. [...] "The symbolism of the gold is to do with the unchanging, untarnished nature of heaven - gold doesn't decay, it doesn't darken like silver. Botticelli would have used an adhesive layer made of oil mixed with resin - not burnished, the gold just patted down on to the surface, following the surface irregularities of the canvas - a glitter, intricate, it would have helped the jewel like quality of the painting - it would have drawn the eye upwards from the Nativity into Heaven. Faith, hope and charity, angels clothed in white, green and red - but the copper based green pigment has discoloured with time, to bronze. Originally it would have been vibrant." ...|$|R
50|$|Terrile's angels {{are common}} men and women, alone, in couples or in groups. They can be {{surrounded}} by a threatening, dark sky or placed in a relaxed garden-like atmosphere. Stark contrast is usually employed to generate a sort of aura around the subject. The act of jumping is framed exactly at that peculiar moment when vertical velocity is nil, leaving the spectator with {{the illusion of a}} still frame, an impossible pose. (As a matter of fact, Terrile's angels look at first sight as carefully contrived photomontage.) Terrile's <b>angels</b> admittedly <b>echo</b> the imaginative world of Wim Wenders's Wings of desire ("Der Himmel über Berlin", 1987), in turn inspired by Rainer Maria Rilke's poems, and co-authored by Peter Handke.|$|R
5|$|The cover art was {{illustrated}} by sci-fi/fantasy artist Michael Whelan, following {{the style of}} Richard Corben's cover for Bat Out of Hell. It features the biker from the first cover flying on his motorcycle towards a giant bat perched on top of New York City's Chrysler Building, to which an <b>angel</b> is bound. <b>Echoing</b> the gravestones of the first cover, partially destroyed skyscrapers inhabit the lava landscape. Also like the first album, it features a 'Songs by Jim Steinman' credit, although smaller and located {{at the bottom of}} the cover.|$|R
5000|$|The {{band was}} {{initially}} formed by bassist Josh Armour and drummer Jon Poole {{under the name}} Two Bare Feet in 1999. They spent several years working the independent Christian music scene before a single, [...] "You Alone", began to get airplay locally in Atlanta. The group then signed to INO Records, a subsidiary of Columbia Records, and changed their name to <b>Echoing</b> <b>Angels</b> due to copyright issues. Their 2007 debut album, You Alone, peaked at No. 19 on Billboard's Top Heatseekers chart and No. 26 on its Top Christian Albums chart.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the year}} 2005, {{they have come}} up with the songs [...] "Fua", [...] "De Lao A Lao" [...] (bachata and merengue reggaeton versions), and [...] "Las Noches Son Tristes". They have been {{compared}} to artists like Daddy Yankee, Don Omar, and Wisin & Yandel in terms of fame. They have also released a single entitled [...] "Carita de Angel" [...] (Face of an <b>Angel)</b> from <b>Echo</b> [...] "The Lab"'s compilation album Invasion. In 2008 they released their new album Showtime with the first single being [...] "La Vecina" [...] (The Neighbor) and their second single [...] "Na De Na". Rockstar Games chose their song [...] "Ven Baílalo" [...] to appear in one of GTA IV's character trailers (Manny Escuela). The song features on the Grand Theft Auto IV radio station San Juan Sounds and later in the [...] "GTA: Episodes From Liberty City" [...] with the song [...] "Na De Na" [...] Their other song [...] "Muevela" [...] was featured in the Fast and Furious 4 movie and soundtrack. Their 3rd album named [...] "Da' Take Over" [...] which is now available on iTunes. They are currently touring the U.S and Latin America a part of their 'Da'Takeover tour' [...] The music is varied with a focus on reggae. They are currently working on their 4th album [...] "Los Internacionales". The duo will be releasing their next single [...] "No Hay Break Pa'Ninguna." [...] on November 17, 2012. Eric Duars, the duo's manager confirmed this via Twitter. He mentioned in the tweet that the song is a reggaeton song and will silence critics that are saying the duo only release commercial stuff such as dance and pop music.|$|R
30|$|An {{inversion}} recovery based steady-state free precession MR {{sequence is}} proposed, since this sequence type is particularly sensitive {{to changes in}} T 1, T 2, and off-resonance frequencies and provides the highest signal-to-noise ratio [6, 9]. For signal readout, a fast sampling trajectory based on variable density spiral readout is applied and spatial undersampling used to speed-up measurement times. MRF acquisition patterns with randomized excitation flip <b>angels,</b> repetitions times, <b>echo</b> times, and inversion times, would fulfil the compressed sensing criteria for sparse reconstruction. Several slices (~ 10 slices) with 20  % slice gap and 3 - 5  mm slice thickness would cover the major pathological region and provide sufficient coverage representative for different regions. Automatic positioning would be performed by established scanner software (i.e., Auto align) to ensure comparable positing of slices for reproducibility measurements in healthy volunteers. Reproducibility scans can be performed consecutively in the same measurement session. The spatial resolution of the acquired images requires at least a 256 × 256 matrix with < 1.3  mm isotropic resolution. The scan time requirements for MRF can be ~ 25  sec per acquired slice and an exact optimization of the parameter settings done at the outset. A total number of ~ 3000 excitations results in a total MRF scan time below 10  minutes.|$|R
5000|$|Angel heads {{towards the}} lobby and is joined by a materializing Spike. Angel denies that he had {{anything}} to do with what happened to Spike. Spike calls him a sell-out, noting that one of his perks is that Angel has Spike"s [...] "ex-tumble, the littlest vampire, fetching coffee" [...] for him. He <b>echoes</b> <b>Angel's</b> realization from [...] "Home" [...] that fighting from inside the belly of the beast might mean the gang is being digested. He says that Angel isn't in control and doesn't know it. He suddenly spots a Grox-lar Beast, which Angel fights; Spike can't fight it because he's non corporeal. Angel breaks the demon's neck, then learns from Harmony that he was supposed to meet with it to negotiate with its clan. Gunn arrives and tells Angel that it might be okay, since Grox-lars respect people who take a [...] "strong opening position." [...] He mentions that when Wolfram & Hart gave him law knowledge in [...] "Conviction," [...] they put in some knowledge of demon laws from other dimensions. Harmony attempts to chat with Spike, but he ignores her and leaves, prompting her to call him a [...] "slayer-loving freak." [...] Angel and Gunn head to Angel's office and discuss the employees Gunn has fired. Spike arrives, noting that the building is huge, and Angel tries to kick him out so he can continue his meeting. Gunn warns that the fired employees are going to fight back, then says that he is going to have to deal with one now. An employee named Novac comes in and asks why Angel shut down the Interment Acquisitions Division (aka grave-robbing). The division is under contract to provide bodies to a necromancer named Magnus Hainsley; Angel tells Novac to get rid of Hainsley as a client.|$|R
