5|$|Spanish bishops {{also claimed}} that the Government, by {{extending}} the right of marriage to same-sex couples, weakened the meaning of marriage, which they defined as an involving a heterosexual couple. The Spanish Family Forum expressed concern over the possibility of same-sex couples adopting and raising children, and argued that <b>adoption</b> <b>is</b> not a right for the parents, but for the adopted. Gay associations replied that de facto adoption by same-sex couples had existed {{for a long time}} in Spain, since many couples were rearing minors adopted by one of the partners. Adoption by same-sex couples was already legal in Navarre (2000), the Basque Country (2003), Aragon (2004), Catalonia (2005) and Cantabria (2005) before the same-sex marriage law legalized these adoptions nationwide. Furthermore, in Asturias (2002), Andalusia (2002) and Extremadura (2003), same-sex couples could jointly begin procedures to temporarily or permanently take children in care. These associations also argued that there was no scientific basis for the claim that the parents' sexual orientation would cause developmental problems for their adopted children. This view is officially supported by the Spanish School of Psychology, which also states that homosexuality is not a pathology.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{guardianship}} {{or other}} systems {{designed for the}} care of the young, <b>adoption</b> <b>is</b> intended to effect a permanent change in status and as such requires societal recognition, either through legal or religious sanction. Historically, some societies have enacted specific laws governing adoption; where others have tried to achieve adoption through less formal means, notably via contracts that specified inheritance rights and parental responsibilities without an accompanying transfer of filiation. Modern systems of adoption, arising in the 20th century, tend to be governed by comprehensive statutes and regulations.|$|E
25|$|The {{language}} of <b>adoption</b> <b>is</b> changing and evolving, {{and since the}} 1970s has been a controversial issue tied closely to adoption reform efforts. The controversy arises {{over the use of}} terms which, while designed to be more appealing or less offensive to some persons affected by adoption, may simultaneously cause offense or insult to others. This controversy illustrates the problems in adoption, as well as the fact that coining new words and phrases to describe ancient social practices will not necessarily alter the feelings and experiences of those affected by them. Two of the contrasting sets of terms are commonly referred to as positive adoption language (PAL) (sometimes called respectful adoption language (RAL)), and honest adoption language (HAL).|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} adoptions in the United States peaked in 1970. It is {{uncertain}} {{what caused the}} subsequent decline. Likely contributing factors in the 1960s and 1970s include {{a decline in the}} fertility rate, associated with the introduction of the pill, the completion of legalization of artificial birth control methods, the introduction of federal funding to make family planning services available to the young and low income, and the legalization of abortion. In addition, the years of the late 1960s and early 1970s saw a dramatic change in society's view of illegitimacy and in the legal rights of those born outside of wedlock. In response, family preservation efforts grew so that few children born out of wedlock today are adopted. Ironically, <b>adoption</b> <b>is</b> far more visible and discussed in society today, yet it is less common.|$|E

25|$|The United Kingdom and New Zealand until {{recently}} shared an FM broadcasting allocation of 88.0 – 105.0MHz. This smaller allocation (less than 20MHz , typical of FM {{in the rest}} of the world) can be traced to the 405 line system's VHF allocation block. The UK adopted the 405 line system but NZ did not. NZ's allocation for FM remained smaller as if NZ had adopted the 405 line system. New Zealand considered adopting the 405 line system in the late 1950s to early 1960s but adopted PAL instead. This impacted the frequency allocation block for FM broadcasting making it smaller. New Zealand's FM frequency allocation issue was not fixed until the late 1990s, when the band was expanded to the full 20MHz. Both New Zealand and the United Kingdom have the standard global allocation of 88.0 – 108.0 for FM now. NZ permits Radio Data System subcarriers, but their <b>adoption</b> <b>is</b> not universal. Radio NZ uses RDS for its FM network, but commercial radio's adoption of the technology is not universal.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{a shared}} {{belief in the}} {{potential}} of IoT, industry leaders and consumers are facing barriers to adopt IoT technology more widely. Mike Farley argued in Forbes that many IoT solutions either lack interoperability or a clear use case for end-users. “Instead of convincing consumers that they need complex systems to serve needs they don’t have, we should fix real problems people struggle with every day.” Many gadgets in the consumer IoT space have appealed to early adopters, yet failed to demonstrate relevance to ordinary people’s lives. “In order to boost sales and drive demand beyond the early adopter set, {{we need to stop}} making toys no one cares about and instead work on building simple solutions to real, everyday problems for real people.” A recent study by Ericsson regarding the adoption of IoT among Danish companies, has suggested that many are struggling “to pinpoint exactly where the value of IoT lies for them”. A company must identify where the value of IoT lies in order to capture it, otherwise non-action is the consequence. This indicates that a major roadblock to IoT <b>adoption</b> <b>is</b> not technical but analytical in nature.|$|E
25|$|Thimphu is the {{political}} and economic centre of Bhutan and the location of the central government. Agriculture and livestock contribute to 45% of the GNP. The use of hydropower plants to generate electricity has also substantially contributed to the economy. Tourism is also a contributor to the economy but its <b>adoption</b> <b>is</b> on a graduated scale maintaining a balance between development and modernization. India is its major trading partner with most of the electricity produced (90%) exported to India, with imports from India limited to 70%. The ngultrum (ISO 4217 code BTN) (Dzongkha: དངུལ་ཀྲམ) has been the currency of Bhutan since 1974. It is subdivided into 100 chhertum (called chetrums on coins until 1979). In 1974, the ngultrum was introduced as the Bhutanese currency replacing the rupee at par. The ngultrum is equal in value to the Indian rupee, since Bhutan's economy is largely dependent on Indian financial and other forms of assistance. Although a city, agriculture is still important to Thimphu and the surrounding district. Even around the royal palace are terraced fields. The main crops grown in the area are rice, corn (maize), and wheat and the lumbering trade is also important to the economy.|$|E
