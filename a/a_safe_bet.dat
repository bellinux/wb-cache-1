But Rogan also pays tribute to Morrison's pure, untainted artistry, and details the development – and subsequent decline – of Morrison's muse over the past 40 years or so. For the serious Van-ologist, Rogan's painstaking research yields an abundance of detail about Morrison's early years". Graeme Green of the Daily Express noted that Rogan [...] "concentrates far more on Van the man than it does on his music, with the singer largely portrayed as difficult, selfish and aloof". He noted that Morrison would turn 60 the year the book was published, and commented [...] "When the singer celebrates his landmark birthday this year, it's <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>bet</b> Rogan's name won't be on the invite list." ...|$|E

Handlen both criticized Griffin's inability to portray two separate characters, as well as Carter's failure at writing a comedic script. He also felt that the [...] "relentless self-awareness isn’t amusing anymore". Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a scathing review. He wrote [...] "If it is indeed true that somewhere out in this vast world we all have an identical twin, I have but one wish for mine. I sincerely hope he was spared the hour of torture that 'Fight Club' imposed upon me." [...] Christina Brzustoski from 11th Hour Magazine opined that [...] "Just when you thought The X-Files couldn't get a more grating guest star than Victoria Jackson, Chris Carter manages to top himself yet again with not one, but two, {{for the love of}} God, two Kathy Griffins in the Carter-penned episode 'Fight Club.' It's <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>bet</b> this disjointed, lame episode will probably not be easily confused with the far superior David Fincher movie of the same name.

To conduct this analysis, we employ a spatially disaggregated general equilibrium model of a regional economy that incorporates the decisions of residents, firms, and developers, integrated with a spatially disaggregated strategic transportation planning model that features mode, time period, and route choice. We find that all cordon pricing schemes increase welfare of the residents, as well as lead to GDP growth. At the optimum, the larger cordon and a double cordon lead to higher benefits than the small cordon encompassing downtown core. Nevertheless, the small cordon seems to be <b>a</b> <b>safer</b> <b>bet</b> because when the toll charge is set suboptimally, the net benefits from the small cordon compared to the optimum change negligibly, while the net benefits from the larger cordon decline sharply as the charge deviates from the optimal level. traffic congestion, cordon tolls, land use, welfare analysis, road pricing, general equilibrium, simulation, Washington DC...|$|R
