5|$|Between 355 and 351BC, Demosthenes {{continued}} practising law privately {{while he}} was becoming increasingly interested in public affairs. During this period, he wrote Against Androtion and Against Leptines, two fierce attacks on individuals who attempted to repeal certain tax exemptions. In Against Timocrates and Against Aristocrates, he advocated eliminating corruption. All these speeches, which offer early glimpses of his general principles on foreign policy, such as {{the importance of the}} navy, of <b>alliances</b> <b>and</b> of national honour, are prosecutions (graphē paranómōn) against individuals accused of illegally proposing legislative texts.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{practice}} of clinical supervision {{is considered an}} effective procedure to achieve a variety of professional outcomes for supervisees. Supervisory alliance mediates many of the learning outcomes thought important for effective supervision. Therefore, {{it is important to}} identity supervisor characteristics that relate to the capacity to develop a positive supervisory <b>alliance</b> <b>and</b> achieve supervision outcome. Aim: Supervisor interpersonal skill was investigated as a characteristic involved with both supervisee assessment of supervisory <b>alliance</b> <b>and</b> learning outcomes of supervision. Method: Forty supervisors completed assessments for interpersonal skill and provided 8 sessions of supervision to 50 supervisees. Supervisees completed assessments for supervisory <b>alliance</b> <b>and</b> supervision evaluation. Findings: Supervisor interpersonal skill predicted supervisee rated supervisory <b>alliance</b> <b>and</b> supervision outcome. Implications: Supervisor interpersonal skill is important for the capacity to develop a positive supervisory <b>alliance</b> <b>and</b> manage the learning environment of supervision...|$|R
5|$|Ever {{since the}} Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259–1282) {{recovered}} Constantinople from the Latin Empire in 1261, the restored Byzantine Empire faced {{the threat of}} a Latin crusade to reclaim the city. The antagonistic Greek Despotate of Epirus and the Latin states of southern Greece, fearful of the Byzantine resurgence, sought aid from the Kingdom of Sicily, first under Manfred of Sicily (r. 1258–1266), and after 1266 under the ambitious Charles of Anjou (r. 1266–1285), who quickly established himself as Byzantium's chief antagonist. Countering the Angevin ruler's <b>alliances</b> <b>and</b> efforts to conquer Byzantium would occupy the remainder of Michael VIII's reign.|$|E
5|$|Historians see {{the growing}} Roman {{influence}} over the east, as with the west, as {{not a matter of}} intentional empire-building, but constant crisis management narrowly focused on short-term goals within a highly unstable, unpredictable, and inter-dependent network of <b>alliances</b> <b>and</b> dependencies. With some major exceptions of outright military rule, the Roman Republic remained an alliance of independent city-states and kingdoms (with varying degrees of independence, both de jure and de facto) until it transitioned into the Roman Empire. It was not until the time of the Roman Empire that the entire Roman world was organized into provinces under explicit Roman control.|$|E
5|$|In the Guale and Timucuan Mocama provinces, La Tama {{refugees}} established four towns {{descended from}} the ancient interior Georgia chiefdoms: Altamaha, Okatee (Ocute), Chechessee (Ichisi), and Euhaw (apparently descended from Toa); Altamaha remained the leading town. Within the Yamassee confederacy, these towns formed the Lower Yamassee, while Guale towns and some others formed the Upper Yamassee. The Yamaseee shifted <b>alliances</b> <b>and</b> later relocated to present-day South Carolina in 1685. They remained a significant power in the Southeast until the English defeated them in the Yamasee War of 1715–1717, after which they integrated into the multiethnic settlements in Spanish Florida.|$|E
40|$|Deaf {{individuals}} {{typically have}} access to 2 types of therapeutic services: interpretive (with an interpreter) and noninterpretive (with a sign-fluent therapist). Previous research indicates {{that the presence of}} an interpreter may hinder development of working <b>alliance</b> <b>and</b> attachment. There is a lack of empirical evidence assessing the effect of working <b>alliance</b> <b>and</b> attachment based on whether or not therapy incorporates an interpreter. The working <b>alliance</b> theory <b>and</b> the attachment theory were the theoretical foundations for this study. This study examined the difference between the strength of working <b>alliance</b> <b>and</b> attachment to the therapist given {{the presence or absence of}} an interpreter in therapy for Deaf individuals (N = 39) utilizing the Working <b>Alliance</b> Inventory <b>and</b> the Client Attachment to Therapist Scale. A multivariate analysis of variance was utilized to examine the differences between interpretive and noninterpretive services. The results indicated that individuals who received noninterpretive services had stronger working <b>alliance</b> <b>and</b> attachment with their therapist, which suggests that the type of therapy services Deaf individuals receive should strongly be considered. Accordingly, an increase of sign-fluent therapists would promote social change by providing more appropriate services that would remove barriers that hinder working <b>alliance</b> <b>and</b> attachment to the therapist...|$|R

From the early 1930s, Belgian foreign and domestic policy had been dominated by the policy of neutrality; leaving international treaties and <b>alliances</b> <b>and</b> attempting to maintain good diplomatic relations with both Britain, France and Germany.|$|E
5|$|Sizeable Maya populations {{existed in}} Petén before the conquest, {{particularly}} around the central lakes {{and along the}} rivers. Petén was divided into different Maya polities engaged in a complex web of <b>alliances</b> <b>and</b> enmities. The most important groups around the central lakes were the Itza, the Yalain and the Kowoj.

5|$|The Classic {{period is}} largely {{defined as the}} period during which the lowland Maya raised dated monuments using the Long Count calendar. This period marked the peak of {{large-scale}} construction and urbanism, the recording of monumental inscriptions, and demonstrated significant intellectual and artistic development, particularly in the southern lowland regions. The Classic period Maya political landscape has been likened to that of Renaissance Italy or Classical Greece, with multiple city-states engaged in a complex network of <b>alliances</b> <b>and</b> enmities. The largest cities had populations numbering 50,000 to 120,000 and were linked to networks of subsidiary sites.|$|E

5|$|The DLM {{operates}} under a decentralized {{framework in}} which internal movements are encouraged and represented in a national body. The party's constituency elects a National Assembly, the principal decision-making body, through proportional representation, where every internal movement forms a list. Composed of 51 to 101 members, determined proportionately {{by the size of}} the constituency, it maintains political priorities, <b>alliances,</b> <b>and</b> rhetoric, and elects an Executive Committee of 9 to 15 members for daily organizational activities. Other organizational bodies include the Legal Committee and Financial Committee, and internal elections occur every three years.|$|E

However, a treaty cannot alter the domestic laws of the United Kingdom; an Act of Parliament is necessary in such cases. The monarch is commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces (the Royal Navy, the British Army, and the Royal Air Force), accredits British High Commissioners and ambassadors, and receives diplomats from foreign states.|$|E

5|$|Between {{the second}} and third Macedonian wars Rome faced further {{conflict}} in the region due to a tapestry of shifting rivalries, <b>alliances</b> <b>and</b> leagues all seeking to gain greater influence. After the Macedonians had been defeated in the Second Macedonian War in 197 BC, the Greek city-state of Sparta stepped into the partial power vacuum in Greece. Fearing the Spartans would take increasing control of the region, the Romans drew on help from allies to prosecute the Roman-Spartan War, defeating a Spartan army at the Battle of Gythium in 195 BC. They also fought their former allies the Aetolian League in the Aetolian War, against the Istrians in the Istrian War, against the Illyrians in the Illyrian War, and against Achaia in the Achaean War.|$|E
5|$|Cárdenas Guillén {{was arrested}} in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, in 2003 and extradited to the United States in 2007. While in prison in Mexico, he {{reportedly}} coordinated the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas from his prison cell. But with his extradition, Treviño Morales's organization experienced a leadership crisis. La Compañía (The Company), a name {{used to describe the}} Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas as a conglomerate, remained in a loose cooperation until early 2010, when violence erupted between both groups. On 18 January 2010, several members of the Gulf Cartel kidnapped Víctor Peña Mendoza (alias Concord 3), a leader of Los Zetas and close associate and friend of Treviño Morales. When he was held captive, Peña Mendoza was asked to switch <b>alliances</b> <b>and</b> join the Gulf Cartel, but he refused, earning a beating followed by execution, presumably carried out by Samuel Flores Borrego.|$|E
5|$|GDRT {{was most}} likely the first Aksumite king to be {{involved}} in South Arabian affairs, as well as the first known king to be mentioned in South Arabian inscriptions. His reign resulted in the control of much of western Yemen, such as the Tihāmah, Najrā, Ma`afir, Ẓafār (until c. 230), and parts of Hashid territory around Hamir in the northern highlands. Furthermore, GDRT's military <b>alliances</b> <b>and</b> his conquests in Yemen and Saudi Arabia, the required formidable fleet for such feats, and the extension of Aksumite influence throughout Yemen and southern Saudi Arabia all reflect a new zenith in Aksumite power. His involvement would mark the beginning of centuries of Aksumite involvement in South Arabia, culminating with the full-scale invasion of Yemen by King Kaleb in 520 (or 525), resulting in the establishment of an Aksumite province covering all of South Arabia.|$|E

5|$|Henry {{inherited}} {{the kingdom of}} England from William Rufus, giving him a claim of suzerainty over Wales and Scotland, and acquired the Duchy of Normandy, a complex entity with troubled borders. The borders between England and Scotland were still uncertain during Henry's reign, with Anglo-Norman influence pushing northwards through Cumbria, but Henry's relationship with King David I of Scotland was generally good, partially due to Henry's marriage to his sister. In Wales, Henry used his power to coerce and charm the indigenous Welsh princes, while Norman Marcher Lords pushed across the valleys of South Wales. Normandy was controlled via various interlocking networks of ducal, ecclesiastical and family contacts, backed by a growing string of important ducal castles along the borders. <b>Alliances</b> <b>and</b> relationships with neighbouring counties along the Norman border were particularly important to maintaining {{the stability of the}} Duchy.|$|E
5|$|Set on {{the fictional}} continents of Westeros and Essos, Game of Thrones has several plot lines {{and a large}} {{ensemble}} cast but centers on three primary story arcs. The first story arc centers on the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms and follows a web of <b>alliances</b> <b>and</b> conflicts among the dynastic noble families either vying to claim the throne or fighting for independence from the throne. The second story arc focuses on the last descendant of the realm's deposed ruling dynasty, exiled and plotting {{a return to the}} throne. The third story arc centers on the longstanding brotherhood charged with defending the realm against the ancient threats of the fierce peoples and legendary creatures that lie far north, and an impending winter that threatens the realm.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary role}} of a king was {{to act as a}} war leader, {{reflected}} in the very small number of minorities or female reigning monarchs in the period. Kings organised the defence of their people's lands, property and persons and negotiated with other kings to secure these things. If they failed to do so, the settlements might be raided, destroyed or annexed and the populations killed or taken into slavery. Kings also engaged in the low-level warfare of raiding and the more ambitious full-scale warfare that led to conflicts of large armies and <b>alliances</b> <b>and</b> which could be undertaken over relatively large distances, like the expedition to Orkney by Dál Riata in 581 or the Northumbrian attack on Ireland in 684.|$|E
