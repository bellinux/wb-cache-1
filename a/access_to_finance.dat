25|$|Papua New Guinea is richly {{endowed with}} natural resources, {{including}} mineral and renewable resources, such as forests, marine (including {{a large portion}} of the world's major tuna stocks), and in some parts agriculture. The rugged terrain — including high mountain ranges and valleys, swamps and islands — and high cost of developing infrastructure, combined with other factors (including serious law and order problems in some centres and the system of customary land title) makes it difficult for outside developers. Local developers are handicapped by years of deficient investment in education, health, ICT and <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>finance.</b> Agriculture, for subsistence and cash crops, provides a livelihood for 85% of the population and continues to provide some 30% of GDP. Mineral deposits, including gold, oil, and copper, account for 72% of export earnings. Oil palm production has grown steadily over recent years (largely from estates and with extensive outgrower output), with palm oil now the main agricultural export. In households participating, coffee remains the major export crop (produced largely in the Highlands provinces), followed by cocoa and coconut oil/copra from the coastal areas, each largely produced by smallholders and tea, produced on estates and rubber. The Iagifu/Hedinia Field was discovered in 1986 in the Papuan fold and thrust belt.|$|E

In its South Asian Growth report, the World Bank said, [...] "In Pakistan, gradual recovery to around 4.5 per cent growth by 2016 is aided by low inflation and fiscal consolidation.

[...] But further acceleration requires tackling pervasive power cuts, a cumbersome business environment, and low <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>finance.</b> [...] " [...] In FY2016, the current account deficit has widen marginally due to increase in trade deficit. Nevertheless, exports are expected to increase only slightly after 2 years of stagnation, as manufacturing continues to suffer under energy shortages and low cotton prices saw only a modest increase. During a trip to Pakistan on 10 February 2016, World Bank Group's president Jim Yong Kim applauded the economic policies of the government, he claimed that Pakistan's economic outlook had become more stable.

40|$|In {{our study}} we {{investigate}} {{the association between}} inter-organizational trust and <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>financing</b> for 11, 500 firms across transitional countries (including Turkey). The results of our study contribute to the stream of economic development literature in two primary ways. First, we show {{that the degree of}} prepayment demanded by private sector firms from their customers tends to be a good measure of (dis) trust in business transactions. In transitional countries, whether or not a private firm demands prepayment for its sales is found to be a strong indicator of (dis) trust for its customers and/or a lack of confidence in the contract enforcement at the country level. Second, and most importantly, our econometric analyses suggest that enterprises in countries with high levels of inter-firm trust are more likely to obtain bank loans and less likely <b>to</b> report <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>financing</b> as a major obstacle to their businesses. This result remains robust with the inclusion of many controls and various specification checks as well as econometric adjustments for the potential endogeneity of trust and <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>financing.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between the presence of financial planning and difficulties regarding <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>financing</b> in {{small and medium-sized companies}} (SMEs) in the Venezuelan manufacturing sector is studied. This is an explicative type research work, designed as non-experimental, crosssectional and correlational field work, applied to a sample of 67 SMEs. A questionnaire was applied and a review was made of the relevant literature, to establish the characteristics of the selected variables, according to the high-medium-low measurement for each of the selected indicators. The preliminary results make it possible to affirm that the financial planning variable demonstrates a medium presence in the companies, with medium and low levels of coordination among their components. Average <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>financing</b> is classified as low, marked by a medium-high <b>access</b> <b>to</b> credit from suppliers, medium access in reinvestment of profits and medium-low <b>access</b> <b>to</b> bank credit lines. There is also evidence of financing patterns compatible with the Pecking Order Theory.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate the extent of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> debt <b>finance</b> and its determinants among SMEs in Uganda using the “Applied and Received” approach (ARa). In addition, supplementary to the main research objective, the thesis had two subsidiary objectives; firstly, to examine the effect of measuring <b>access</b> <b>to</b> debt <b>finance</b> by comparing two approaches, the “Received” (Ra) and “Applied and Received” (ARa), to the extent and determinants of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> debt <b>finance.</b> Secondly, <b>to</b> examine if there are significant differences in the way SMEs and financiers perceive effective lending rates, transaction costs, firm age, firm size, industry, financial transparency, collateral, education, entrepreneurial experience and gender as determinants of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> debt <b>finance.</b> <b>To</b> achieve the {{main objective}} and two subsidiary objectives, a survey was conducted based on a population of 128, 000 SMEs, out of which a sample of 384 was considered appropriate, according to random tables by Sekaran and Bougie (2013). From the financiers’ side, a population of 25 commercial banks, 22 insurance companies, 50 registered trade credit suppliers and a sample of 10 credit service bureaus, 10 MFIs and 10 SACCOs were used {{for the purposes of this}} study. The response rate was 57 % from the SMEs and 62 % from the financiers. In terms of analysis, the extent of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> debt <b>finance</b> was examined using descriptive statistics. In addition, Pearson’s correlation coefficient was employed to determine the relationship between <b>access</b> <b>to</b> debt <b>finance</b> and its determinants and binary logistic regression analysis was used to determine the strength of the relationships between <b>access</b> <b>to</b> debt <b>finance</b> and the determinants. Overall, the model explained up to 73. 3 % of the variation in <b>access</b> <b>to</b> debt <b>finance.</b> Finally, the independent samples t-test was used to determine if there were significant variations and consensus between SMEs and financiers with regard to the determinants of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> debt <b>finance.</b> The findings of the study contribute to the literature in a number of ways; first, the conventional measures (“Received”, “Loan size” and “Frequency of acquisition” approaches) have understated the extent of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> debt <b>finance,</b> while the “Applied and Received” approach (ARa) is a superior measure of the extent of this among SMEs in Uganda. This is because the ARa focuses on active borrowers and not discouraged borrowers or those SMEs that have voluntarily excluded themselves from external credit. Second, the study provides empirical evidence of the determinants of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> debt <b>finance</b> for the first time in Uganda where such evidence was previously unknown. Third, the study documents significant differences in the perceptions of the determinants of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> debt from the SMEs and suppliers of debt finance. However, the ARa has limitations; for example, the degree to which discouraged borrowers can be excluded is open to debate. This is because, unlike voluntary excluded borrowers (not seeking funding at all), discouraged borrowers want debt but do not seek it because they think it will not be granted. The most important implication of this research to policy makers and academics is the methodology of operationalising <b>access</b> <b>to</b> debt <b>finance</b> using the ARa. This approach deals with voluntary exclusion and reports higher rates of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> debt <b>finance</b> compared <b>to</b> the Ra, which helps policy makers <b>to</b> estimate the <b>financing</b> gap among SMEs in Uganda. Likewise, the ARa includes additional determinants of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> debt <b>finance</b> variables, which suggests that SMEs seeking finance are aware of the factors that financiers consider in the credit scoring process. Secondly, for SMEs and financiers, the findings concerning the consensus and variations in the determinants of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> debt <b>finance</b> are of great value to educate policy makers on the information gap existing between the demand and supply sides. Knowledge of the determinants of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> debt <b>finance</b> from the financiers’ side will improve access among SMEs in Uganda because financiers play a pivotal role in the issue of this finance...|$|R
