40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to examine correlations between cognitive entry behavior <b>and</b> attitude toward <b>mathematics</b> <b>and</b> science (MIPA), <b>and</b> achievement in <b>mathematics</b> <b>and</b> science. The population of the study was the students of MIPA FKIP-UNSRI. There were 140 subjects sample chosen from the population. The Pearson 2 ̆ 7 s Product Moment and Multiple Correlation were applied to analyze the data. The results showed that: there was correlation between cognitive entry behavior <b>and</b> achievement in <b>mathematics</b> <b>and</b> science; there was correlation between attitude toward <b>mathematics</b> <b>and</b> science, <b>and</b> achievement in <b>mathematics</b> <b>and</b> science; achievement in <b>mathematics</b> <b>and</b> science can be predicted from cognitive entry behavior <b>and</b> attitude toward <b>mathematics</b> <b>and</b> science...|$|R
