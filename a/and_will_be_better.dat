60|$|An enterprising Englishman lately {{imported}} sheep from home. The native mutton {{was described}} in 1842 as 'strong in flavour and lean in condition;' in fact, very little superior to that of Trieste. Now it is remarkably good, <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>better.</b> Silk, I have said, has not been fairly tried, {{and the same is}} the case with ginger. Cotton suffered terribly from the worm. Chinchona propagated from cuttings, not from the seed, did well. Dr. Grabham [Footnote: The Climate and Resources of Madeira. By Michael C. Grabham, M.D., F.R.G.S., F.R.C.P. London; Churchill, 1870.] tells us that the coffee-berry ripens and yields a beverage locally thought superior to that of the imported kinds. It has become almost extinct in consequence of protracted blights: the island air is far too damp. Tea did not succeed. [Footnote: Page 189, Du Climat de Madère, etc., par C. A. Mourão Pitta, Montpellier, 1859.] Cochineal also proved a failure. The true Mexican cactus (Opuntia Tuna) was brought to supplant the tree-like and lean-leafed native growth; but there is too much wind and rain for the insects, and the people prefer to eat the figs or 'prickly pears.' Bananas grow well, and a large quantity is now exported for the English market. But the climate does not agree with European fruits and vegetables; strawberries and French beans are equally flavourless. I remarked the same in the glorious valley of the Lower Congo: it must result from some telluric or atmospheric condition which we cannot yet appreciate.|$|E

It also offered a $125,000 USD bounty for Ibrahim, who has been allegedly wounded during fighting on May 10 in Omdurman.|$|E

The new line is six miles in extent... The travelling facilities which the new railway will afford--provided the North British Railway Company, who have become possessors of the line, put on a good and convenient service of trains, which as yet has not been done,--will prove of great benefit {{to the town of}} Dunfermline, and also to Inverkeithing... The towns named have lost considerably by the undertaking the delay in completion, but they are certain to benefit by the improved accommodation which will be supplied, <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> equipped for competition in the race of enterprise and industry.

As a country becomes richer, it is able to build more schools and better fund the schools already built. This was seen in Russia after the October Revolution. A better educated public leads to a more efficient workforce, and can also lead the country to technological breakthroughs in industry and manufacturing. These countries will also experience much less severe famine now that they are able to trade successfully on a global scale.|$|E

40|$|Glandular cells, {{other than}} the mucous cells, have been {{described}} in the skin of various groups of fish (Teleosts, Ganoids, Selachii) {{and they have been}} called 'albuminose' by various authors. The authors propose to study the albuminose cells in the skin of Torpedo ocellata Raf. from a histochemical point of view. The albuminose cells have a complex morphological structure and a correspondingly complicated histochemical make-up.

Unless otherwise specified {{in the description of}} the specific SPE, we deploy the SPE under analysis and the source of input data on the same machine. We configure the SPE as a stand alone component and we use network communication to interact with it. We submit input elements in timestamp order, always using FIFO channels to avoid reordering. SECRET does not capture problems related to clock skews and out of order elements that might emerge in distributed settings. Thus, these issues are outside the scope of the analysis <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> discussed in [...] "Discussion".|$|E

Moreover, the relation among target number, system resources, and performance requirements will be considered. Further, detection is the prerequisite for tracking, and a track-before-detect processing can actually help improve the detection probability, which should also {{be considered in the}} {{resource allocation}} problem of target detection <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> to balance the resource allocation between detection and tracking tasks [29, 30].

40|$|Cannabis for {{therapeutic}} purposes (medical marijuana) is {{a complex}} reality {{in many parts of}} the world. Laws and regulations surrounding cannabis for therapeutic purposes around the world are evolving. The Marihuana for Medical Purposes Regulations (MMPR) define roles and responsibilities pertaining to cannabis for therapeutic purposes in Canada. These regulations are lengthy and technical but include information important to health professionals. This article presents a synopsis of elements within the regulations that are important for health professionals. The purpose of this paper is to assist health professionals to understand the structure and impact of these regulations. With a greater understanding of how cannabis for therapeutic purposes is regulated, health professionals will be capable of engaging in more informed discussions with patients and colleagues, <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> equipped to navigate the new landscape of legal access...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe results here {{discussed}} {{were produced}} by a program of visual observations carried out at the Calern Observatory from 1975 to 1998. The sun radius data collected display some variability, in particular an oscillation of 0. 2 ″amplitude and 11. 8 years period which seems anticorrelated with the sunspot cycle. These apparent variations might also be put together with other structural solar parameters: frequency shifts of low-degree p-modes or neutrino flux. Moreover, the series shows a deviation from the mean diameter {{as a function of}} heliographic latitude. The origin of these apparent variations is currently unclear <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> understood by ground measurements {{over a long period of}} time (e. g. the DORAYSOL Instrument and Program at Calern) and by the results expected from the future PICARD mission of the French Space Agency CNES...|$|E
40|$|Objective: to {{describe}} the patient’s knowledge with chronic renal failure submitted to kidney transplantation {{on the importance of}} consultation with nursing for his treatment. Methodology: this is about an exploratory-descriptive study from qualitative approach. The data collection was from January to December 2007. The sample consisted of 36 patients undergoing kidney transplant from a total of 400. For the choice of the patients was a random draw simple daily. For data collection was used a questionnaire consisting of 11 questions concerning the information about the kidney transplant. For organization of the results was used thematic analysis proposed by Minayo. Results: as for nursing consultation for a significant number of patients claiming to be of importance to them, since they make them safer, take your questions <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> targeted. Conclusion: confirming the effectiveness of professional practice of nurses in the monitoring of renal patients who is subject to renal transplantation...|$|E
