50|$|The Turbo-Cat was a jet <b>aircraft</b> <b>catapult</b> launch <b>system</b> {{powered by}} six jet engines. It {{was invented by}} Don Doolittle, and {{manufactured}} by the All American Engineering Co. of Wilmington, Delaware, USA. Six Allison J33 engines in a capstan arrangement provided 50,000 horsepower directly to the launching cable.|$|R
50|$|Saturated steam at 600 psi is channeled {{from each}} steam {{generator}} {{to a common}} header, where the steam is then sent to the main engine, electrical generators, <b>aircraft</b> <b>catapult</b> <b>system,</b> and various auxiliaries. There are two main propulsion turbines, one high pressure turbine and one low pressure turbine, with a moisture separator in place between the two. The Low Pressure main propulsion turbine is double-ended, whereby the steam enters at the center and divides into two streams as it enters the actual turbine wheels, expanding and giving up its energy as it does so, causing the turbine to spin at high speed. The main shaft enters a reduction gear in which the high rotational velocity of the turbine shaft is stepped down to a usable turn rate for propelling the ship. The expended steam from the main engine and other auxiliaries enters condensers to be cooled into liquid water and recycled to the feed system.|$|R

50|$|A {{well-known}} type of assisted takeoff is an <b>aircraft</b> <b>catapult.</b> In modern <b>systems</b> fitted on aircraft carriers, a piston, {{known as}} a shuttle, is propelled down a long cylinder under steam pressure. The aircraft {{is attached to the}} shuttle using a tow bar or launch bar mounted to the nose landing gear (an older system used a steel cable called a catapult bridle; the forward ramps on older carrier bows were used to catch these cables), and is flung off the deck at about 15 knots above minimum flying speed, achieved by the catapult in a four-second run.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedInvestigating {{the effect of}} steam ingestion into an aircraft jet engine is necessary to improve understanding of stall and surge in transonic axial compressors. Specifically, to understand the "pop stall" phenomenon experienced by naval fighter jet <b>aircraft</b> during steam <b>catapult</b> launches. Steam leakage from an <b>aircraft</b> carrier <b>catapult</b> <b>system</b> can be ingested into the intake and cause stall or surge in a jet engine upon takeoff. It {{is important to understand}} the conditions under which this occurs as the Navy prepares for the fielding of the single engine F- 35 C, the aircraft carrier variant of the Joint Strike Fighter. This project prepares the structure and instrumentation to investigate the inlet distortion and effects of steam ingestion on a transonic axial compressor. A compressor test facility, including mechanical equipment, data acquisition system, and remote digital control system, was configured to test a transonic compressor rotor, similar to what will be used in the Joint Strike Fighter. Rotor inlet and exit velocity profiles were measured with a three-hole probe to obtain a set of baseline data before future experiments...|$|R
5|$|In {{order to}} refuel their nuclear power plants, the {{carriers}} each undergo a Refueling and Overhaul (RCOH) once in their service lives. This {{is also the}} most substantial overhaul the ships undergo while in service and involves bringing the vessels' equipment up to the standards of the newest ships. The ship is placed in dry dock, and essential maintenance is carried out including painting of the hull below the waterline and replacement of electrical and mechanical components such as valves. Because of the large time periods between the ships' constructions, the armament and designs of the newer ships are more modern than those of the older ships. In RCOH, the older ships are refitted to the standards of the newer ships, which can include major upgrades to the flight deck, <b>aircraft</b> <b>catapults</b> and combat <b>systems</b> as well as other upgrades such as improved radar systems, although precise details can vary significantly between the ships. The improvements normally take around four years to complete. The RCOH for USS Theodore Roosevelt took four years to complete (2009–2013) and cost about US$2.6 billion. Planned Incremental Availability is a similar procedure, although it is less substantial and does not involve refueling of the nuclear power plants.|$|R

50|$|Early {{aircraft}} carriers could launch aircraft simply by turning {{into the wind}} and adding the ship's own speed to the airspeed experienced by the aircraft. After World War II, naval aircraft became so heavy that <b>aircraft</b> <b>catapults</b> were needed to accelerate aircraft to takeoff speed, and it was feared that even a catapult might one day not be enough. A NACA study from 1952 proposed {{the use of a}} ski-jump after the <b>aircraft</b> <b>catapult</b> to assist <b>aircraft</b> in taking off.|$|R

50|$|An <b>{{aircraft}}</b> <b>catapult</b> is {{a device}} used to launch aircraft from ships, {{most commonly used}} on aircraft carriers, {{as a form of}} assisted take off. It consists of a track built into the flight deck, below which is a large piston or shuttle that is attached through the track to the nose gear of the aircraft, or in some cases a wire rope, called a catapult bridle, is attached to the <b>aircraft</b> and the <b>catapult</b> shuttle. Different means have been used to propel the catapult, such as weight and derrick, gunpowder, flywheel, air pressure, hydraulic, and steam power. The U.S. Navy is developing the use of Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch Systems with the construction of the Gerald R. Ford class <b>aircraft</b> carrier. <b>Catapulted</b> <b>aircraft</b> land like conventional aircraft, sometimes with the help of arresting gear.|$|R
