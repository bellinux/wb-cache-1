500|$|The {{transcendental}} {{theme of}} Harrison's lyrics {{aligned with the}} philosophy behind the 1967 Summer of Love – namely, the search for universality and an ego-less existence. Author Ian Inglis considers the line [...] "With our love we could save the world" [...] to be a [...] "cogent reflection" [...] of the Summer of Love ethos, anticipating the utopian message of Harrison's composition [...] "It's All Too Much" [...] and the John Lennon-written [...] "All You Need Is Love". He <b>adds,</b> <b>with</b> reference to the chorus: [...] "The lyrics are given greater depth by the double meaning of without – 'in the absence of' and 'outside' – {{each of which is}} perfectly applicable to the song's sentiments." ...|$|E
500|$|Among {{more recent}} {{reviews of the}} Yellow Submarine album, David Gassman of PopMatters admires the song for its [...] "mordant humor" [...] and interprets the lyrics as a {{possible}} [...] "dig" [...] at Lennon and McCartney. Gassman <b>adds,</b> <b>with</b> reference to the superior [...] "It's All Too Much": [...] "as long as songs like this were being relegated to throwaway projects, George could be excused for sniping at John and Paul in 'Only a Northern Song'." [...] Discussing the same two tracks, Pitchfork Media's Mark Richardson writes that they offer little of interest aside from their [...] "swirling" [...] psychedelic effects, although he considers that [...] "Only a Northern Song" [...] "at least has a good joke going for it, simultaneously alluding to the North of England and the Beatles' Lennon-McCartney-dominated publishing company". Mark Kemp of Paste dismisses the song as a [...] "meandering bore".|$|E

40|$|The {{study was}} purposed to {{determine}} the consumer acceptance of common carp (Lepotobarbus hoevenii Blkr) atom crackers that <b>added</b> <b>with</b> fish meat compared to that <b>added</b> <b>with</b> fish meal. The fish meal was obtained from traditional markets. The fish initially was processed into fish meal and mixed with tapioca flour, water, seasoning and condiments and then fried. The quality of fish crackers produced was assessed for their consumer acceptance and their chemical composition. The fish cracker <b>added</b> <b>with</b> the fish meat showed the highest consumer acceptance {{at the rate of}} 100 %.

40|$|ABSTRACT To develop health {{functional}} gluten-free rice madeleines <b>added</b> <b>with</b> pine needle, rice flours were pre-pared {{by adding}} different contents (0. 6, 1. 2, and 1. 8 % on rice flour basis) of freeze-dried pine needle powder (PP) and extract (PE, by pressing pine needles). The preparation, textural and sensory properties, and antioxidative activities of rice madeleines were investigated. The antioxidative activities of rice madeleines <b>added</b> <b>with</b> PP and PE {{were higher than}} those of the control and were significantly different from each other. The specific volume of rice madeleines <b>added</b> <b>with</b> PE was higher than that <b>added</b> <b>with</b> PP. Lightness and yellowness decreased with increasing PP or PE content, whereas redness showed the reverse trend. Textural properties were also significantly different according to pine needle type and content. Hardness values of rice madeleines <b>added</b> <b>with</b> 1. 2 and 1. 8 % PP or 1. 2 % PE were reduced compared to that of control. Hardness values increased while other textural properties decreased during storage. In the sensory test, color, flavor, and taste scores increased with increasing PP or PE contents, whereas flavor and overall quality scores were highest in rice madeleine <b>added</b> <b>with</b> 1. 2 % PP. Based on these results, pine needle powde...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Platelets {{generate}} oxidized LDL (ox-LDL) via NOX 2 -derived oxidative stress. We investigated if once {{generated by}} activated platelets ox-LDL can propagate platelet activation. METHODS: Experiments were performed in platelets from healthy subjects (HS), hyper-cholesterolemic patients and patients with NOX 2 hereditary deficiency. RESULTS: Agonist-stimulated platelets from HS <b>added</b> <b>with</b> LDL {{were associated with}} a dose-dependent increase of reactive oxidant species and ox-LDL. Agonist-stimulated platelets from HS <b>added</b> <b>with</b> a fixed dose of LDL (57. 14 μmol/L) or <b>added</b> <b>with</b> homogenized human atherosclerotic plaque showed enhanced ox-LDL formation (approximately + 50...|$|R
