5|$|Another {{survivor}} was Katriel Katz, Israeli Ambassador to the Soviet Union. Katz {{had been}} {{expelled from the}} Soviet Union by Andrei Gromyko on 10 June 1967, {{the last day of}} the Six-Day War. During the evacuation from the aircraft, Katz was the only passenger to escape through the forward port door, despite the efforts of Hutchinson and Unwin to stop him using that door. The two flight crew were almost carried out through the door by Katz, who was <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>man.</b> Katz was seriously injured jumping from the doorway. He was taken to Hillingdon Hospital, where it was initially feared that he would become the sixth victim of Flight 712. Katz recovered after a few days. He died in 1988 aged 80.|$|E

25|$|He was <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>man</b> {{with a large}} presence, of warm human sympathies and in his {{childhood}} a great admirer of Abraham Lincoln. His interventions, responses and advocacies were often colourful and forceful, as befitted an admirer of Huxley, for whom {{he worked as a}} demonstrator when a young man. In his personal manner he was not so adept as Huxley, and he made enemies by his rudeness. This undoubtedly damaged and limited the second half of his career.|$|E

During the years 1930 to 1933 he travelled widely, particularly in Africa, in search of big-game (as the trophies that could be seen at his house at Princes Gate after the war testified) though his bags were reputedly always packed with art books. He even acquired a pilot's license in Berlin.|$|E
500|$|Mortimer Grimshaw (1824 or 1825 – 22 December 1869) was an English {{political}} activist, {{strike leader}} and cotton weaver.

500|$|After {{graduating in}} {{medicine}} from the University of Vienna in 1922, Reich became {{deputy director of}} Freud's outpatient clinic, the Vienna Ambulatorium. Described by Elizabeth Danto as <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>man</b> with a cantankerous style who managed to look scruffy and elegant at the same time, he tried to reconcile psychoanalysis with Marxism, arguing that neurosis is rooted in sexual and socio-economic conditions, and in particular in a lack {{of what he called}} [...] "orgastic potency." [...] He visited patients in their homes to see how they lived, and took to the streets in a mobile clinic, promoting adolescent sexuality and the availability of contraceptives, abortion and divorce, a provocative message in Catholic Austria. He said he wanted to [...] "attack the neurosis by its prevention rather than treatment." ...|$|E

[...] He bowled leg spin with a gentle action and while not a big turner of the ball, he relied on {{accuracy}} to dismiss opponents. [...] He made his Test debut in 1902 against England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) and was selected to tour England later that year where he was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year.

500|$|As related above, {{during the}} early 1860s, Irataba befriended prospectors as a guide. One of them was John Moss, whom Irataba had shown the {{location}} of a gold mine in the Mojave desert, which Moss later sold. Moss suggested Irataba be invited to Washington so that he could see firsthand the United States' military might. In November 1863, Irataba traveled with Moss to San Pedro, Los Angeles, where they boarded the steamship Senator, bound for San Francisco. In San Francisco, he stayed at the Occidental Hotel and created a storm as he walked down Jackson Street, dressed in clothing typical of European Americans, which Irataba soon preferred to traditional Mohave clothing. The press documented his every movement and wrote extensively about his physical size and strong features. On December 2, 1863, the Daily Evening Bulletin described Irataba as <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>man,</b> [...] "granitic in appearance as one of the Lower Coast mountains, with... a lower jaw massive enough to crush nuts or crush quartz." ...|$|E

500|$|The Vancouver {{branch of}} Sony Pictures Imageworks was {{responsible}} for the digital touch-up. The group improved the sewer and high school battle scene with many of Spider-Man's poses and environments that were used in the film. The comic book was cited as a basic source for Spider-Man's poses. The visual designers helped bring the Lizard to life by first building a digital version of a production design maquette. Many of the staff were involved with the process. They also started by thinking about lizard biology and how his muscles would work. <b>A</b> <b>large</b> <b>man</b> referred to as [...] "Big John" [...] stood in as the character during shooting, performing much of the interaction with other characters. The computer-generated Lizard replaced him in post-production. The creators would then fuse the design of the Lizard with the actor Rhys Ifans. Ifans then used motion capture for the Lizard's speaking parts, which Webb found challenging to incorporate into the character's final version.|$|E
500|$|Kids Can Say No! is a twenty-minute British short {{educational}} film intended {{to teach children}} about sexual abuse. Harris said he was naive about the subject and was motivated to make the film by a female teacher who told him that, when she spoke to her students about abuse, a traumatised girl {{ran out of the}} room; the girl later disclosed that she was being abused by a family member. According to Harris, he {{came up with the idea}} for the film on a 1982 Canadian tour when he saw Vancouver's Green Thumb Theatre production of Feeling Yes, Feeling No, a play about child sexual abuse. He was also inspired by a similar Australian production and a Swedish film about two children befriended by <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>man</b> on a farm. In an interview, Harris said that, when he saw the Swedish film, he thought the man was going to abuse the children, but that his expectations were incorrect and that [...] "the film was completely innocent; I was not".|$|E
500|$|Point du Sable {{settled on}} the north bank of the Chicago River close to its mouth {{at some time in}} the 1780s. The {{earliest}} known record of Point du Sable living in Chicago is an entry that Hugh Heward made in his journal on May 10, 1790 during a journey from Detroit across Michigan and through Illinois. Heward's party stopped at Pointe du Sable's house en route to the Chicago portage; they swapped their canoe for a pirogue that belonged to Point du Sable, and they bought bread, flour and pork from him. Perrish Grignon, who visited Chicago in about 1794, described Point du Sable as <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>man</b> who was a wealthy trader. In 1800 he sold his farm to John Kinzie's frontman, Jean La Lime, for 6,000 livres; the bill of sale, which was rediscovered in 1913 in an archive in Detroit, outlined all of the property Point du Sable owned as well as many of his personal artifacts. This included a house, two barns, a horse drawn mill, a bakehouse, a poultry house, a dairy and a smokehouse. The house was a [...] log cabin filled with fine furniture and paintings.|$|E

500|$|The Undertaker was {{the fifteenth}} wrestler to enter; he {{eliminated}} four men before Harvey Wippleman appeared, accompanying <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>man</b> (who was later {{revealed to be}} Giant González, billed at eight feet tall). González attacked The Undertaker and threw {{him out of the}} ring; as a result, The Undertaker was eliminated from the match. Several referees tried to get González to return to the locker room; he eventually left, and Paul Bearer, The Undertaker's manager, came to the ring. He helped The Undertaker revive, and The Undertaker returned to the locker room to find González. Several minutes later, Typhoon entered the match, followed shortly by his tag team partner in The Natural Disasters, Earthquake. Earthquake immediately targeted Typhoon and eliminated him from the match. Earthquake tried to console his partner, who ignored him and left ringside. [...] Later, Tito Santana and Rick Martel were in the ring at the same time; they fought each other immediately {{as a result of their}} five-year-old feud. Yokozuna, weighing over 500 pounds (227 kilograms), entered in the number twenty-seven spot; at one point, almost every wrestler worked together in an attempt to eliminate him, but they were unable to lift him.|$|E
500|$|In {{the short}} film, the duo play [...] "Mac and Jack", {{a pair of}} conmen who sell a [...] "miracle potion". The {{salesman}} (McCartney) offers Jackson the potion, and claims that it is [...] "guaranteed {{to give you the}} strength of a raging bull". Jackson drinks the potion and challenges <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>man</b> to arm-wrestle. Unbeknownst to a watching crowd, the man—along with Linda—is also in on the scam. After Jackson wins the rigged contest, the crowd of people surge forward and buy the potion. Mac and Jack then donate all of the money earned from the scam to an orphanage. After this scene, McCartney and Jackson star as vaudeville performers who sing and dance at a bar. On stage, the duo appear in clown makeup at one point and quickly go through a number of costume changes. Jackson flirts with a young woman portrayed by his real-life sister La Toya. When law-enforcement officers appear {{at the back of the}} venue, Mac quickly starts a small fire onstage and Linda hollers [...] "FIRE!", emptying the venue and allowing the group to escape via backstage (yet somehow finding time to change into tuxedoes first). The video ends with Paul, Linda, and Michael as they drive off into the sunset. La Toya, who was handed a bunch of flowers by McCartney, is left at the roadside.|$|E
500|$|Ruth was {{sometimes}} allowed to rejoin his family, or was placed at St. James's Home, a supervised residence with {{work in the}} community, {{but he was always}} returned to St. Mary's. He [...] was rarely visited by his family; his mother died when he was 12 and by some accounts, he was permitted to leave St. Mary's only to attend the funeral. How Ruth came to play baseball there is uncertain: according to one account, his placement at St. Mary's was due in part to repeatedly breaking Baltimore's windows with long hits while playing street ball; by another, he was told to join a team on his first day at St. Mary's by the school's athletic director, Brother Herman, becoming a catcher even though left-handers rarely play that position. During his time there he also played third base and shortstop, again unusual for a left-hander, and was forced to wear mitts and gloves made for right-handers. He was encouraged in his pursuits by the school's Prefect of Discipline, Brother Matthias Boutlier, a native of Nova Scotia. <b>A</b> <b>large</b> <b>man,</b> Brother Matthias was greatly respected by the boys both for his strength and for his fairness. For the rest of his life, Ruth would praise Brother Matthias, and his running and hitting styles closely resembled his teacher's. Ruth stated, [...] "I think I was born as a hitter the first day I ever saw him hit a baseball." [...] The older man became a mentor and role model to George; biographer Robert W.
