5|$|George P. Burdell is {{a fictitious}} student officially {{enrolled}} at Georgia Tech in 1927 <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>practical</b> joke. Since then, he has supposedly received all undergraduate degrees offered by Georgia Tech, {{served in the}} military, gotten married, and served on Mad magazine's Board of Directors, among other accomplishments. Burdell at one point led the online poll for Times 2001 Person of the Year award. He has evolved into an important and notorious campus tradition; all Georgia Tech students learn about him at orientation.|$|E
5|$|Orientalism {{proposed}} that much Western study of Islamic civilization was political intellectualism, {{meant for the}} self-affirmation of European identity, rather than objective academic study; thus, the academic field of Oriental studies functioned <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>practical</b> method of cultural discrimination and imperialist domination—that is to say, the Western Orientalist knows more about the Orient than do the Orientals.|$|E
5|$|RNAi is a {{valuable}} research tool, both in cell culture and in living organisms, because synthetic dsRNA introduced into cells can selectively and robustly induce suppression of specific genes of interest. RNAi {{may be used for}} large-scale screens that systematically shut down each gene in the cell, which can help to identify the components necessary for a particular cellular process or an event such as cell division. The pathway is also used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>practical</b> tool in biotechnology, medicine and insecticides.|$|E

5|$|The Clause {{has led to}} {{very little}} litigation, {{in part because of}} its overlap (<b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>practical</b> matter) with the venue {{provision}} of Article Three and Rule 18 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Further, {{with the exception of the}} District of Wyoming, which includes the portions of Yellowstone National Park in Idaho and Montana, no federal judicial district includes the territory of two or more states (although the short-lived District of Potomac once did).|$|E
5|$|The Deseret {{alphabet}} was purposely {{designed so}} as to not have ascenders and descenders. This was envisioned <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>practical</b> benefit for the alphabet {{in an era of}} metal type: after many uses, the edges of type sorts become dull, and narrow ascenders and descenders are most prone to this effect.|$|E
5|$|The Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM), {{also known}} as the Baby, was {{designed}} as a test-bed for the Williams tube, an early form of computer memory, rather than <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>practical</b> computer. Work on the machine began in 1947, and on 21 June 1948 the computer successfully ran its first program, consisting of 17 instructions written to find the highest proper factor of 218 (262,144) by trying every integer from 218 − 1 downwards. The program ran for 52minutes before producing the correct answer of 131,072.|$|E

She started an anonymous hotline in Greenwood County to help seniors who were being preyed on by criminals and feared retribution if they called police. After retiring <b>as</b> <b>a</b> licensed <b>practical</b> nurse, she studied criminal justice and became a private investigator.|$|R
5|$|An {{extension}} to battery {{was given in}} Wilkinson v Downton, where emotional distress was considered a possible battery despite no physical force being used. The defendant told the claimant (<b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>practical</b> joke) {{that her husband had}} been seriously injured. As a result, the claimant suffered a nervous disorder and was thought to be suicidal for a time. It was held that such an action will be valid under battery where it is calculated to cause physical damage and does so. The principle was extended by Khorasandjian v Bush, in 1993, where there was a risk that the defendant's actions would cause physical or psychiatric damage. The tort set down in Wilkinson is normally considered a separate tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress.|$|E
5|$|Experimentation by Faraday in 1831 {{revealed}} that a wire moving perpendicular to a magnetic field developed a potential difference between its ends. Further analysis of this process, known as electromagnetic induction, enabled him to state the principle, now known as Faraday's law of induction, that the potential difference induced in a closed circuit {{is proportional to the}} rate of change of magnetic flux through the loop. Exploitation of this discovery enabled him to invent the first electrical generator in 1831, in which he converted the mechanical energy of a rotating copper disc to electrical energy. Faraday's disc was inefficient and of no use <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>practical</b> generator, but it showed the possibility of generating electric power using magnetism, a possibility that would be taken up by those that followed on from his work.|$|E
5|$|In addition, the Air Force was {{tasked with}} {{gathering}} intelligence, air reconnaissance, and air transport. Support of ground troops, both doctrinally and <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>practical</b> matter, became marginal. These missions were {{strongly influenced by}} a shrinking capability, since its combat aircraft could operate by daylight only, its anti-aircraft artillery was obsolete, and the FLORIDA radar system had reached the limits of operational effectiveness. The retirement of the Hawker Hunters in 1994ended its ground support capability, and a cut of one-third from the defence budget meant that plans for a second purchase of F/A-18s and supporting air-to-ground weapons (the reason the multi-capable Hornet was selected) had to be canceled, leaving both it and the F-5s in a strictly air-to-air role.|$|E

5|$|Lack of {{patronage}} led to Pentland folding his businesses {{and taking a}} job in 1930 as a pilot with Australian National Airways (ANA), a new airline founded by Charles Kingsford Smith and Charles Ulm. By 1932, ANA was in trouble as well, and Pentland left to set up as a dairy farmer on a property he bought at Singleton. Within two years, drought forced him to sell the land and he returned to earning his living as a pilot, instructing at aero clubs in Queensland and New South Wales. By late 1937, he was again employed as a transport pilot in New Guinea, where he was known <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>practical</b> joker who liked to hold a map {{in front of his}} face in apparent short-sightedness and ask his passengers if they could see a landing ground anywhere. He returned to Australia after war was declared in September 1939.|$|E
5|$|Morris {{took up the}} {{practical}} art of dyeing as a necessary adjunct of his manufacturing business. He {{spent much of his}} time at Staffordshire dye works mastering the processes of that art and making experiments in the revival of old or discovery of new methods. One result of these experiments was to reinstate indigo dyeing <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>practical</b> industry and generally to renew the use of those vegetable dyes, such as the red derived from madder, which had been driven almost out of use by the anilines. Dyeing of wools, silks, and cottons was the necessary preliminary to what he had much at heart, the production of woven and printed fabrics of the highest excellence; and the period of incessant work at the dye-vat (1875–76) was followed by a period during which he was absorbed in the production of textiles (1877–78), and more especially in the revival of carpet-weaving as a fine art.|$|E
5|$|Noether's theorem {{has become}} a {{fundamental}} tool of modern theoretical physics, both because of the insight it gives into conservation laws, and also, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>practical</b> calculation tool. Her theorem allows researchers to determine the conserved quantities from the observed symmetries of a physical system. Conversely, it facilitates the description of a physical system based on classes of hypothetical physical laws. For illustration, suppose that a new physical phenomenon is discovered. Noether's theorem provides a test for theoretical models of the phenomenon: if the theory has a continuous symmetry, then Noether's theorem guarantees that the theory has a conserved quantity, and for the theory to be correct, this conservation must be observable in experiments.|$|E

5|$|Officially, {{the entire}} length of I-75 in Michigan is the American Legion Memorial Highway. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>practical</b> matter, this name is not used on the southernmost {{segments}} of the Interstate. The American Legion was honored with the designation in 1969 in a state law that required private interests to finance the signage. Public Act174 of 1984 redesignated I-75 in honor of the group and placed responsibility for signage in MDOT's hands. Another name that was applied to all of I-75 was the Michigan Bicentennial Freedom Way. Designated by Senate Concurrent Resolution216 of 1975, the name only applied to the freeway in 1976. The designation was formally repealed in 2001.|$|E
5|$|The {{experiment}} {{had previously}} been considered, but rejected, by Isaac Newton <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>practical</b> demonstration of his theory of gravitation. However, a team of scientists, notably Nevil Maskelyne, the Astronomer Royal, {{was convinced that the}} effect would be detectable and undertook to conduct the experiment. The deflection angle depended on the relative densities and volumes of the Earth and the mountain: if the density and volume of Schiehallion could be ascertained, then so could the density of the Earth. Once this was known, then this would in turn yield approximate values for those of the other planets, their moons, and the Sun, previously known only in terms of their relative ratios. As an additional benefit, the concept of contour lines, devised to simplify the process of surveying the mountain, later became a standard technique in cartography.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{issue of}} {{debate within the}} {{sovereignty}} movement became on what terms sovereignty would be put before the electorate. Parizeau, long identified with the independantiste wing of the party, was opposed to the PQ's general historical preference for an economic relationship {{with the rest of}} Canada to be offered alongside sovereignty, as he thought this would encourage the Federal government to simply refuse to negotiate and cast the project as doomed, as had happened in 1980. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>practical</b> matter, Parizeau believed that given the emotional circumstances of separation a special partnership was unlikely, and that given free trade agreements and other multilateral institutions it was unnecessary.|$|E
