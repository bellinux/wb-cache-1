5|$|Before her stasis {{aboard the}} Spear of Adun, Rohana was a driven protoss {{who was not}} afraid to seek out tasks others thought impossible.

After she was awakened, Rohana held on to the old ways of the Protoss Empire, openly speaking out against her Nerazim crew, Artanis' Terran allies, and the reawakening of the Purifiers. She served as a reminder of the past, clinging to old traditions and ways, and refusing to cut her connection from the Khala even as Amon continued to possess her, stating knowledge and history {{was the only thing that}} brought unity to the protoss. Though Artanis valued her memories and her ability to see into Amon's thoughts, he began to grow weary of her <b>adherence</b> <b>to</b> the old ways and her objections to his choices, becoming more of a critic than a councilor. Eventually, she came to terms with the Daelaam, and cut herself from the Khala, stating that perhaps history did not need to be recorded with perfect clarity.|$|E

In-depth narrative {{interviews were conducted}} with 15 Mexican Americans with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) living on dialysis, 15 family members, and 6 health care personnel who provided care to them. Four themes emerged: (a) positive influences <b>to</b> <b>adherence,</b> (b) obstacles <b>to</b> <b>adherence,</b> (c) daily activity losses, and (d) fears about living with dialysis. From the findings, the perceptions given for non-adherence with the dialysis regimen ranged from denial of the condition, lack of pre-education, to cultural factors. Those given for adherence included prolonged life, family, and hope of getting a transplant. Health care providers were the reminder to adhere. Several cultural factors influenced their <b>adherence</b> perceptions. Strategies <b>to</b> enhance <b>adherence</b> behaviors should focus on knowledge about dialysis, use of the collective efficacy of the family, and the inclusion of cultural values...|$|R
