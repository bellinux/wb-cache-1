5000|$|... 20 July 1942 - U-132 sank one {{ship from}} convoy QS 19 escorted by Flower-class {{corvette}} , Bangor-class minesweeper [...] and <b>anti-submarine</b> motor <b>launches</b> Q059, Q064 and Q074.|$|R
5000|$|... was a [...] <b>anti-submarine</b> frigate <b>launched</b> in 1959. She {{was used}} as a {{training}} ship at Harwich from 1984 until 1988, when she was sold for scrapping.|$|R
50|$|The Mark 32 Surface Vessel Torpedo Tubes (Mk 32 SVTT) {{system is}} a torpedo {{launching}} system designed for the United States Navy. The Mark 32 has been the standard <b>anti-submarine</b> torpedo <b>launching</b> system aboard United States Navy surface vessels since its introduction in 1960, and is in use aboard the warships of several other navies.|$|R
5000|$|... was an <b>anti-submarine</b> warfare trawler <b>launched</b> in December 1942 and sunk in April 1943 in a {{collision}} with the French merchant vessel Cassard north-east of Blyth.|$|R
50|$|She had a {{relatively}} small crew of 96, with a displacement of nearly 1,000 tons, but she was mounted with the Hedgehog <b>anti-submarine</b> mortar, which <b>launched</b> contact-detonating depth charges at an enemy submarine {{far away from the}} boat itself.|$|R
50|$|The RPK-2 Vyuga (РПК-2 Вьюга, meaning blizzard), also {{designated}} 81R, {{and identified}} by NATO as Starfish and the United States Department of Defense as SS-N-15, is a Soviet submarine-launched, nuclear-armed <b>anti-submarine</b> missile system, <b>launched</b> exclusively through 533mm torpedo tubes. The system was designed in Sverdlovsk, Russian SFSR in the 1960s.|$|R
50|$|The {{surviving}} concrete huts and {{the concrete}} {{remnants of the}} quarters and mess building at RAN Station 9 at Pinkenba (Myrtletown) are important in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland's history, being surviving evidence of the efforts made to defend Moreton Bay and the Brisbane River against enemy ships and submarines during World War II. The indicator loop and photo-electric beam installation at Myrtletown {{was part of an}} interlocking system of naval defences for Moreton Bay, which incorporated coastal artillery batteries, indicator loops, controlled minefields, ASDIC (anti-submarine sonar detection) devices, Fairmile <b>anti-submarine</b> motor <b>launches,</b> a photoelectric (PE) beam and an anti-submarine boom.|$|R
5000|$|St. Laurent Class of Canadian WarshipThe {{pride of}} the Canadian Navy during the Cold War, these anti-submarine escorts were the first naval vessels {{conceived}} and built in Canada. Designed in 1948-1949, they influenced naval construction internationally with their smooth above-water surfaces and distinctive convex deck. They could also be sealed to protect crews against biological and radioactive threats. All seven St. Laurent-class ships were modified during the 1960s to carry helicopters and enhance their <b>anti-submarine</b> capability. <b>Launched</b> in 1953, HMCS Fraser is the last surviving example of this innovative class of warship.

50|$|In August 1992, OBrien {{departed}} San Diego {{to become}} a member of the Forward Deployed Naval Forces. En route from San Diego to Yokosuka, OBrien conducted follow-on testing and evaluation of the vertically <b>launched</b> <b>anti-submarine</b> rocket and the SQQ-89 sonar system on the Pacific Missile Test Range off Kauai, Hawaii. OBrien arrived in Yokosuka, Japan, in October 1992.|$|R
50|$|The Mk 54 can {{be fired}} from surface ships via the Mark 32 surface vessel torpedo tubes or the {{vertical}} <b>launch</b> <b>anti-submarine</b> rocket (ASROC) systems, {{and also from}} most ASW aircraft, although they are slightly different lengths and weights. The P-8 Poseidon uses the High-Altitude Anti-Submarine Warfare Weapons Capability (HAAWWC) GPS-guided parachute kit to drop torpedoes from high altitude.|$|R
50|$|The Kinglet primary {{was used}} in the US W55 warhead of an NDB ("nuclear depth bomb") carried by the SUBROC <b>anti-submarine</b> missile <b>launched</b> {{horizontally}} from a submarine to attack at longer ranges and at shorter times than torpedoes can manage, and with a much higher kill probability. The two yields of the W55 are a common feature of NDBs. A high yield will be used in deep oceanic water. A low yield will be required for use in shallow or coastal waters, and in deep oceanic water to minimise risk to nearby shipping. The lower yield is likely to be obtained without the boosting, which in turn reduces the fusion element almost completely.|$|R
5000|$|... 91RTE2 - A {{surface ship}} with the VLS <b>launched</b> <b>anti-submarine</b> variant; it {{consists}} of three stages, one booster with thrust vector nozzle, one conventional booster, and one anti-submarine light torpedo. Its basic length is 8.9 m, {{with a range of}} 40 km at supersonic speed. The torpedo has a warhead weight of 76 kg. The lightest of all variants, with a launch weight of 1300 kg. Speed is Mach 2.|$|R
50|$|On the Allied side, the US Navy {{developed}} the Mark 24 mine. The Mark 24 {{was called a}} mine for security reasons; it was actually an aircraft <b>launched,</b> <b>anti-submarine</b> passive acoustic homing torpedo. The first production Mk. 24s were delivered to the U.S. Navy in March 1943, and it scored its first verified combat kills in May 1943. The Mk. 24 {{went on to become}} a successful anti-submarine weapon and later in the war was also adapted for submarine and surface ship use.|$|R
5000|$|The Hong Sang Eo (Red Shark) torpedo (Hangul: 홍상어 어뢰), {{also called}} the K-ASROC, is a {{vertically}} <b>launched</b> <b>anti-submarine</b> missile successively developed and tested by South Korea's University of Science and Technology, the Korea Agency for Defense Development (ADD) and the Republic of Korea Navy in 2009. [...] The Red Shark missile has a range of 12 mi and carries a K745 Blue Shark torpedo that is deployed by parachute near the intended target. After release, the Blue Shark independently searches for the target.|$|R
50|$|The Kongō class {{employs the}} highly {{advanced}} Aegis fire control system and is {{armed with the}} RIM-66 SM-2MR Block II surface-to-air missile, RUM-139 vertically <b>launched</b> <b>anti-submarine</b> rocket, the RGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missile, two Mark 15 20 mm CIWS gun mounts, two torpedo mounts in a triple tube configuration, and an Oto Melara 127 mm/54 caliber gun. Their Mark 41 vertical launch system can hold 90 missiles. However, {{in keeping with the}} defensive mission of the JMSDF and passive role of the Japan Self-Defense Forces in general, the Kongō class lacks the Tomahawk missile.|$|R
50|$|Two Kashtan Air Defence Gun/Missile mounts are INS Tabars Close-In Weapons System (CIWS). The Kashtan CIWS has two GSh-30k 30 mm Gatling guns per mount firing 5,000 rounds a minute, {{along with}} eight 9M-311 Grison {{missiles}} (NATO: SA-N-11) {{with a range}} of 8 km. There are 64 Grison reloads (32 each mount) with a package of four missile taking less than two minutes to load. Forward of INS Tabars bridge and aft of the VLS is one 12-round RBU-6000 <b>anti-submarine</b> warfare rocket <b>launch</b> that can fire either Splav-90R rockets or RGB-60 depth charges. Two pairs of fixed 533 mm DTA-53 torpedo tubes are located port and starboard midships. Both can launch either SET-65E anti-sub and 53-65KE anti-ship torpedoes.|$|R
50|$|On the proposal's due date, ship {{designs were}} {{submitted}} by Lockheed Martin, Austal USA, Huntington Ingalls Industries, and General Dynamics Bath Iron Works, and separate combat systems proposals were submitted by Lockheed, Raytheon, and General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems (GD AIS); ship and combat systems responses {{were limited to}} 25 and 15 pages respectively. Lockheed's response was a variant of their Freedom-class LCS; different upgrades included an advised increase in length to 125 m, vertical launch systems for Standard Missile 2 missiles or the Standard Missile 6, and the SPY-1F Aegis radar or a Air Missile Defense Radar derivative. Austal USA submitted a modified Independence-class ship, adding permanently installed systems like a towed array sonar, torpedoes, vertical <b>launch</b> <b>anti-submarine</b> rockets, and aviation capability to support the MH-60 helicopter in place of mission modules. Like Lockheed's submission, it has a VLS for Standard missiles, a 76 mm gun {{in place of the}} 57 mm gun, and can take on an Aegis or ADMR radar. Huntington Ingalls submitted a larger, more heavily armed National Security Cutter. General Dynamics also made an unspecified response.|$|R
