25|$|When he {{returned}} to England, Greig caused more controversy in the lead-up to the 1976 series against the West Indies. Appearing on television to discuss the coming summer, Greig's oratory created controversy when he expounded on West Indies players:I {{like to think that}} people are building these West Indians up, because I'm not really sure they're as good as everyone thinks they are. I think people tend to forget it wasn't that long ago they were beaten 5–1 by the Australians and only just managed to keep their heads above water against the Indians just <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>time</b> <b>ago</b> as well. Sure, they've got a couple of fast bowlers, but really I don't think we're going to run into anything more sensational than Thomson and Lillee and so really I'm not all that worried about them. You must remember that the West Indians, these guys, if they get on top are magnificent cricketers. But if they're down, they grovel, and I intend, with the help of Closey and a few others, to make them grovel.|$|E

In 2001, member countries experienced a deficit of 1 % of GDP. Table 1 depicts the general government financial balances of selected OECD member countries.

Since it appeared more logical to alter the cerebral blood supply directly in the treatment of various neurologic disorders, Royle lf 2 suggested and performed thoracocervical sympathectomy in such conditions as early as 1932.

6000|$|I add one purely pedantic note which comes, as a note {{naturally}} should, at {{the beginning}} of the book. These essays are concerned only to discuss the actual fact that the central Christian theology (sufficiently summarized in the Apostles' Creed) is the best root of energy and sound ethics. They are not intended to discuss the very fascinating but quite different question of what is the present seat of authority for the proclamation of that creed. When the word [...] "orthodoxy" [...] is used here it means the Apostles' Creed, as understood by everybody calling himself Christian until <b>a</b> very <b>short</b> <b>time</b> <b>ago</b> and the general historic conduct of those who held such a creed. I have been forced by mere space to confine myself to what I have got from this creed; I do not touch the matter much disputed among modern Christians, of where we ourselves got it. This is not an ecclesiastical treatise but a sort of slovenly autobiography. But if any one wants my opinions about the actual nature of the authority, Mr. G.S.Street has only to throw me another challenge, and I will write him another book.|$|R
