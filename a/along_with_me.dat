500|$|Rimsky-Korsakov {{recalled}} that [...] "Balakirev had no difficulty in getting <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> At his suggestion I most readily rewrote the symphonic movements composed {{by me and}} brought them to completion {{with the help of}} his advice and improvisations". Though Rimsky-Korsakov later found Balakirev's influence stifling, and broke free from it, this did not stop him in his memoirs from extolling the older composer's talents as a critic and improviser. Under Balakirev's mentoring, Rimsky-Korsakov turned to other compositions. He began a symphony in B minor, but felt it too closely followed Beethoven's Ninth Symphony and abandoned it. He completed an Overture on Three Russian Themes, based on Balakirev's folksong overtures, as well as a Fantasia on Serbian Themes that was performed at a concert given for the delegates of the Slavonic Congress in 1867. In his review of this concert, nationalist critic Vladimir Stasov coined the phrase Moguchaya kuchka for the Balakirev circle (Moguchaya kuchka is usually translated as [...] "The Mighty Handful" [...] or [...] "The Five"). Rimsky-Korsakov also composed the initial versions of Sadko and Antar, which cemented his reputation as a writer of orchestral works.|$|E

2500|$|Anglo-Chinese Schools' shared {{philosophy}} is [...] "To create conditions {{for students to}} embody excellence, to establish an environment for spiritual, intellectual and physical growth, to prepare pupils {{to meet the challenge}} of rapid change in society". This is reflected in the school motto, [...] "The Best Is Yet To Be." [...] The phrase is taken from the first line of the Robert Browning poem, Rabbi ben Ezra (1864), [...] "Grow old <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>me!</b> / The best is yet to be...".|$|E
2500|$|Pebble in the Sky was {{originally}} {{written in the}} summer of 1947 under the title [...] "Grow Old with Me" [...] for Startling Stories, whose editor Sam Merwin, Jr. had approached Asimov to write a forty thousand word short novel for the magazine. The title was a misquotation of Robert Browning's Rabbi ben Ezra, the first few lines of which (starting [...] "Grow old <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>me!</b> / The best is yet to be...") were included in the final novel. It was rejected by Startling Stories on the basis that the magazine's emphasis was more on adventure than science-heavy fiction (despite the editor inviting Asimov to write the latter as an experiment for the magazine), and again by John W. Campbell, Asimov's usual editor. In 1949, Doubleday editor Walter I. Bradbury accepted the story on the suggestion of Frederik Pohl, on the condition it was expanded to seventy thousand words and the title changed to something more science fiction oriented, and it was published in January 1950 as Pebble in the Sky. [...] "Grow Old With Me" [...] was later published in its original form along with other draft stories in The Alternate Asimovs in 1986.|$|E
2500|$|... 2Pacalypse Now {{generated}} significant controversy {{for numerous}} reasons. The songs [...] "Trapped" [...] and [...] "Brenda's Got a Baby" [...] were widely noted for their poetic qualities but also offered strong critiques of unjust social policies. Dan Quayle criticized the album after a Texas youth's defense attorney {{claimed he was}} influenced by 2Pacalypse Now and its theme of police brutality before shooting a state trooper. Quayle said, [...] "There's no reason for a record like this to be released. It {{has no place in}} our society." [...] Shakur stated that he felt he had been misunderstood. He said, [...] "I started out saying I was down for the young black male, you know, and that was gonna be my thang," [...] Shakur said. [...] "I just wanted to rap about things that affected young black males. When I said that, I didn't know that I was gonna tie myself down to just take all the blunts and hits for all the young black males, to be the media's kicking post for young black males. I just figured since I lived that life I could do that, I could rap about that." [...] The record was important in showcasing Shakur's political conviction and his focus on lyrical prowess. On MTV's Greatest Rappers of All Time list, 2Pacalypse Now was listed as one of Shakur's [...] "certified classic" [...] albums, <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>Me</b> Against the World, All Eyez on Me and [...] 2Pacalypse Now went on to be certified Gold by the RIAA.

2500|$|Sherwood wrote {{some of the}} film's {{locations}} {{into the}} script as homage to Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III. As Sherwood explains, [...] "The original Leatherface, Chainsaw 3, took {{the idea of the}} backwoods isolation of the original and exploded it tenfold. I always think of the locations of this film—the scrub brush filled badlands and remote roadside outposts as feeling like another world—a dark fairy tale land in some way. I filled my story with similar locations to hopefully capture a similar vibe." [...] The fictional Sawyer farm is a key location in Leatherface, which was rebuilt to accurately resemble its appearance in the first Texas Chain Saw Massacre. The farm was originally going to be used sparingly, until Sherwood discussed the matter with directors Maury and Bustillo. Sherwood stated, [...] "Developing the script with the directors was actually just super-easy. We knew {{what we wanted to do}} from the start, and they got it and they were right <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> I didn't have the farmhouse a lot and they were like 'If we are going to build the set and this is the famous farmhouse, we should use it' and I totally agreed with that. And so we moved the third act, mostly taking place at the farmhouse." [...] The Sawyer homestead was adduced by cinematographer Antoine Sanier as being particularly rousing to film: [...] "It's a real house that has been shot many times, but we cannot see it very well [...] It's always a little bit hidden or dark, so it was really impressive to get into this process and also to be a link to the other guys that have been shooting this kind of set." ...|$|E
2500|$|For Kierkegaard, true {{individuality}} {{is called}} selfhood. Becoming {{aware of our}} true self is our true task and endeavor in life—it is an ethical imperative, as well as preparatory to a true religious understanding. Individuals can exist {{at a level that}} is less than true selfhood. We can live, for example, simply in terms of our pleasures—our immediate satisfaction of desires, propensities, or distractions. In this way, we glide through life without direction or purpose. To have a direction, we must have a purpose that defines for us the meaning of our lives. Kierkegaard puts it this way in Either/Or, Here, then, I have your view of life, and, believe me, much of your life will become clear to you if you will consider it <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> as thought-despair. You are a hater of activity in life-quite appropriately, because {{if there is to be}} meaning in it life must have continuity, and this your life does not have. You keep busy with your studies, to be sure; you are even diligent; but it is only for your sake, and it is done with as little teleology as possible. Moreover, you are unoccupied; like the laborers in the Gospel standing idle in the marketplace, you stick your hands in your pocket and contemplate life. Now you rest in despair. Nothing concerns you; you step aside for nothing; “If someone threw a roof tile down I would still not step aside.” You are like a dying person. You die daily, not in the profound, earnest sense in which one usually understands these words, but life has lost its reality and you “Always count the days of your life from one termination-notice to the next.” You let everything pass you by; nothing makes any impact. But then something suddenly comes along that grips you, an idea, a situation, a young girl’s smile, and now you are “involved,” for just on certain occasions you are not “involved,” so at other times you are “at your service” in every way. Wherever there is something going on you join in. You behave in life as you usually do in a crowd. “You work yourself into the tightest group, see to it, if possible, to get yourself shoved up over the others so that you come to be above them, and as soon as you are up there you make yourself as comfortable as possible, and in this way you let yourself be carried through life.” But when the crowd is gone, when the event is over, you again stand on the street corner and look at the world.
