In 1681, the Flemish engineer Carlos de Grunenbergh proposed some changes {{to the design of}} the fort, and these recommendations were implemented. The barracks, chapel and other buildings within the fort were constructed in the 1680s and 1690s, and the fort was officially declared complete and armed in May 1698.|$|E

5|$|All RAF GR.1s <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> AV-8As were {{fitted with}} the Ferranti FE541 {{inertial}} navigation/attack suite, {{but these were}} replaced in the USMC Harriers by a simpler Interface/Weapon Aiming Computer to aid quick turnaround between missions. The Martin-Baker ejection seats were also replaced by the Stencel SEU-3A in the American aircraft. The RAF had their GR.1 aircraft upgraded to the GR.3 standard, which featured improved sensors, a nose-mounted laser tracker, the integration of electronic countermeasure (ECM) systems and a further upgraded Pegasus Mk 103. The USMC upgraded their AV-8As to the AV-8C configuration; this programme involved the installation of ECM equipment and adding a new inertial navigation system to the aircraft's avionics. Substantial changes were the Lift Improvement Devices, to increase VTOL performance; {{at the same time}} several airframe components were restored or replaced to extend the life of the aircraft. Spain's Harriers, designated AV-8S or VA.1 Matador for the single-seater and TAV-8S or VAE.1 for the two-seater, were almost identical to USMC Harriers differing only in the radios fitted.|$|E
5|$|Deus Ex was {{designed}} as a single player game, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> releases of the Windows and Macintosh versions of the game did not include multiplayer functionality. Support for multiplayer modes was later incorporated through patches. The component includes three game modes: deathmatch, basic team deathmatch, and advanced team deathmatch. Only five maps, based on levels from the single-player portion of the game, were included with the original multiplayer patch, but many user-created maps now exist. The PlayStation 2 release of Deus Ex does not offer a multiplayer mode. In April 2014 it was announced that Gamespy would cease their masterserver services, also affecting Deus Ex. A community-made patch for the multiplayer mode has been created as a response to this.|$|E

5|$|Gaudí's {{position}} {{in the history of}} architecture is that of a creative genius who, inspired by nature, developed a style of his own that attained technical perfection as well as aesthetic value, and bore the mark of his character. Gaudí's structural innovations were to an extent the result of his journey through various styles, from Doric to Baroque via Gothic, his main inspiration. It could be said that these styles culminated in his work, which reinterpreted and perfected them. Gaudí passed through the historicism and eclecticism of his generation without connecting with other architectural movements of the 20th century that, with their rationalist postulates, derived from the Bauhaus school, and represented an antithetical evolution to that initiated by Gaudí, given that it later reflected the disdain <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> lack of comprehension of the work of the modernista architect.|$|E
5|$|He {{was highly}} {{regarded}} as a scientist by the British, who wanted {{him to return to}} the United Kingdom to work on Britain's post-war nuclear weapons program; he returned in August 1946 and became the head of the Theoretical Physics Division at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell. From late 1947 to May 1949 he gave Alexander Feklisov, his Soviet case officer, the principal theoretical outline for creating a hydrogen bomb <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> drafts for its development as the work progressed in England and America. Meeting with Feklisov six times, he provided the results of the test at Eniwetok Atoll of uranium and plutonium bombs and the key data on production of uranium-235.|$|E
5|$|In 1221 Llywelyn {{took control}} of {{neighbouring}} Meirionnydd from his son, Gruffydd; Llywelyn had previously placed Gruffydd in power there, but {{the father and son}} had fallen out. The prince then began to build the castle of Castell y Bere with the intent of controlling the local population and securing his new south-west border, which included the mountain trade routes between Gwynedd, Powys Wenwynwyn and Deheubarth. Castell y Bere was the first of several stone castles built by Llywelyn <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> castle consisted of several towers positioned around a courtyard, situated on a rocky hillock in the Dysynni Valley near Cadair Idris.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} aims at {{investigating}} {{the categories of}} <b>the</b> zhao-series <b>initials</b> of Middle Chinese. Particularly, the present study tries to examine whether <b>the</b> zhuang-group <b>initials</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> zhang-group <b>initials</b> should be considered belonging {{to one or two}} groups of initials, using both dialectal <b>and</b> historical data. <b>The</b> first part of the thesis is an overview on what is being said about <b>the</b> zhuang-group <b>initials</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> zhang-group <b>initials</b> in previous studies. The second part of the thesis discusses <b>the</b> merge <b>and</b> <b>the</b> split of <b>the</b> zhuang-group <b>initials</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> zhang-group <b>initials</b> based on their historical development and in conjunction with ancient Chinese and Modern Chinese Phonology. The third part of the thesis uses the data of the distribution of <b>the</b> zhuang-group <b>initials</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> zhang-group <b>initials</b> in present day Northern Mandarin to discuss the categories of these two groups of initials in Middle Chinese. Combining the observations made from both dialectal data <b>and</b> historical studies, <b>the</b> conclusion of the present study is that <b>the</b> zhuang-group <b>initials</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> zhang-group <b>initials</b> should be considered belonging to two different groups of initials, which will be the fourth part of the thesis...|$|R
5|$|In May 1945, when Nazi Germany surrendered, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> {{motivation}} for the crash atomic bomb project dissipated as {{it was discovered that}} the German nuclear energy project was years behind, Wilson raised the question of whether they should continue with their work. News of this met with an icy reception from Major General Leslie Groves, director of the Manhattan Project. In later life, when interviewed in the Oscar-nominated documentary The Day After Trinity (1980), Wilson would say that he should have strongly considered ceasing work on the bomb after the surrender of Germany, and regretted not doing so to some extent.|$|E

The first individual customer delivery took place on Honolulu, Hawaii, on December 12, 2011. Sales increased from 80 units in 2011 to 588 in 2012, and rose to 1,029 during 2013.

5|$|Meanwhile, {{a lasting}} peace with France {{was made in}} 1558 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> {{invasion}} threat passed. The Spanish threat to the south-west of England became more serious, however, and war broke out in 1569. As a result, a defensive earthwork was constructed north-west of the castle to protect it against an attack from the land, and an additional gun battery facing upriver was installed alongside the blockhouse. The levels of the garrison varied considerably during the period. Pendennis had a garrison of 100 men in 1578, and could have mustered around 500 men in 1596, while in 1599 it was reportedly guarded by 200 soldiers.|$|E
