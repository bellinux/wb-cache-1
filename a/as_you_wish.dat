500|$|While Eddy {{argued that}} reality was entirely spiritual (and {{therefore}} entirely good), it remained true {{that human beings}} were affected by their belief in evil, which meant it had power, even if the power was an illusion. Evil was [...] "like a bankrupt to whom credit is still granted," [...] writes Wilson. To defend herself against it, Eddy organized [...] "watches," [...] during which students (known as mental or metaphysical workers) would give [...] "adverse treatment" [...] to her enemies. This was called [...] "taking up the enemy in thought." [...] According to former students, Eddy would tell them to say (often with Richard Kennedy in mind): [...] "You are affected <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> to affect me. Your evil thought reacts upon you," [...] then call Kennedy bilious, consumptive or poisoned by arsenic.|$|E

For example you cannot put a Y registration number on a T registered vehicle but you could choose any prefix range from an A to a T. Each registration has an issue date which is what you must check to ensure you don't make your vehicle appear newer than it is." [...] However, you are able to put 1955 registered private number plates on a 1949 registered vehicle as there is no year indicator to determine the age of release.|$|E

2500|$|Near , Crossing of the Waters, lived Spider Man and Spider Woman. They {{knew how}} to weave the fibers of cotton and hemp and other plants. First Woman asked Spider Man and Spider Woman to teach people how to weave the fibers of plants so {{they would not have}} to depend on animal skins for clothing. [...] Cotton seeds were planted, and the cotton was gathered. Spider Man taught the people to shape a little wheel, 3 or 4inches in diameter, and put a slender stick through it to spin the cotton. First Woman said, [...] "You must spin towards your person, not away, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> to have the {{beautiful}} goods come to you. If you spin away from you, the goods will depart from you." [...] Spider Man named the spindle [...] "," [...] meaning [...] "turning around with the beautiful goods."
