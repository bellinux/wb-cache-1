We enable access to external events and stimuli in immersive environments so that the user is aware of such events and is able to attend to them without having to disengage from the VR gear.

40|$|Abstract A fin {{experimental}} apparatus was designed, {{developed and}} constructed for the undergraduate heat transfer laboratory at Purdue University at Fort Wayne. This paper presents a fin experiment {{that can be}} integrated into the undergraduate heat transfer laboratory. The objective of this experiment is to enhance the understanding of the transfer of thermal energy by undergraduate mechanical engineering students. This experiment exposes the students to several important concepts in heat transfer, such as one-dimensional, steady-state heat transfer by conduction and fin efficiency. In this type of experiment, the students get the opportunity to compare the measured temperature profiles in the fin to both analytical and numerical solutions. The experimental <b>apparatus</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> carry out this experiment is simple and inexpensive...|$|R

The remaining parameters–discrimination (the amount of information the item provides for skill estimation) and guessing (the probability of guessing the right answer)–remain fixed here. 2 - and 3 -parameter-logistics are considered to give a more exact and/or faster estimation of an examinee’s skill level, but <b>require</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the additional parameters for each item (Reckase, 2010).|$|R
