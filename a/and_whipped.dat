5|$|Born a slave in Dorchester County, Maryland, Tubman {{was beaten}} <b>and</b> <b>whipped</b> by her various masters as a child. Early in life, she {{suffered}} a traumatic head wound when an irate slave owner threw a heavy metal weight intending to hit another slave and hit her instead. The injury caused dizziness, pain, and spells of hypersomnia, which occurred throughout her life. She was a devout Christian and experienced strange visions and vivid dreams, which she ascribed to premonitions from God.|$|E
5|$|The series won several {{international}} advertising {{awards for}} BBH. The brand's creaminess was emphasised through {{items such as}} face cream, ice cream, sun cream <b>and</b> <b>whipped</b> cream. Managing director of Whitbread, Miles Templeman, explained that: We were thinking how to turn a second-rate north-west brand into something more stylish, {{to make it more}} appealing again. BBH thought of focusing on the creamy aspect, of selling a beer like a face cream. A previously unknown Melanie Sykes launched her career as a television presenter following her appearances in the adverts from 1996 until 1999.|$|E
5|$|Opposition {{initially}} {{came from}} Pennsylvania's House of Representatives protesting the tax. William Maclay had noted {{that not even}} the Pennsylvanian legislators {{had been able to}} enforce excise taxes in the western regions of the state. Hamilton was aware of the potential difficulties and proposed inspectors the ability to search buildings that distillers were designated to store their spirits, and would be able to search suspected illegal storage facilities to confiscate contraband with a warrant. Although the inspectors were not allowed to search houses and warehouses, they were to visit twice a day and file weekly reports in extensive detail. Hamilton cautioned against expedited judicial means, and favored a jury trial with potential offenders. As soon as 1791 locals began to shun or threaten inspectors, as they felt the inspection methods were intrusive. Inspectors were also tarred and feathered, blindfolded, <b>and</b> <b>whipped.</b> Hamilton had attempted to appease the opposition with lowered tax rates, but it did not suffice.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTSpringing <b>and</b> <b>whipping</b> are {{becoming}} increasingly important considerations in ship design as container ships increase in size. In this study, the springing <b>and</b> <b>whipping</b> characteristics of a large container ship were investigated {{through a series of}} systematic model tests in waves. A multi-segmented hull model with a backbone was adopted for measurement of springing <b>and</b> <b>whipping</b> signals. A conversion method for extracting torsion springing <b>and</b> <b>whipping</b> is described in this paper for the case of an open-section backbone. Higher-order springing, higher-mode torsion responses, and the effects of linear and nonlinear springing in irregular waves are highlighted in the discussion...|$|R
50|$|In 2009, Stephanie {{began searching}} for a public {{relations}} person for her new company, Jackie M. She came across <b>Whip,</b> <b>and</b> hired him {{not only for the}} company, but to lure Brooke away from her son Ridge, unaware that Brooke <b>and</b> <b>Whip</b> were never sexual as husband <b>and</b> wife. <b>Whip</b> later begins a relationship with Ridge's other love (who Ridge had abandoned) Taylor Hayes (Hunter Tylo). He helps her get over Ridge, however Brooke and Ridge both suspect that Taylor <b>and</b> <b>Whip,</b> were getting together to spite them. The two of them were married in Taylor's home. Taylor <b>and</b> <b>Whip</b> remained happy despite working for opposing companies (Jackie M Designs and Forrester Creations).|$|R

5|$|The Celtics {{were unable}} to repeat their title in 1987 despite several {{dramatic}} playoff victories. Johnson played strong defense again, earning yet another appearance on the All-Defensive First Team, and the Celtics embarked on a nail-biting playoff campaign. In the 1987 Eastern Conference Semifinals, the Celtics split the first six games against the Milwaukee Bucks. In the deciding Game 7, which the Celtics won, Johnson had a spectacular play with 1:30 left in the game: a Celtics ball threatened to fly out of bounds, but Johnson dived for it <b>and</b> <b>whipped</b> it backwards in mid-air against Bucks center and former Sonics teammate Jack Sikma. The ball bounced off Sikma before going out of bounds, and the Celtics maintained possession.|$|E
5|$|The {{battles of}} zduhaći were furious. They were {{accompanied}} by forceful gales and whirlwinds which uprooted trees <b>and</b> <b>whipped</b> up dust. In Montenegro, it was considered dangerous to throw stones in the wind, because that might knock out an eye of a zduhać, who would kill the culprit. A fighting zduhać was supposed to retain his peck measure and milk bucket, while trying to seize these objects from an enemy zduhać; he should hit and not get hit. The victorious band of zduhaći would loot the yield of all agricultural produce from the territory of their defeated foes. The harvest in the coming season would thus be excellent for the victors and poor for the defeated zduhaći.|$|E
5|$|The first {{accusation}} against Sherwood came {{to court}} in early 1697. Richard Capps alleged {{that she had}} used a spell to cause {{the death of his}} bull. The court made no decision, and the Sherwoods filed a defamation suit against Capps that was resolved by a settlement. In 1698, Sherwood was accused by her neighbor John Gisburne of enchanting his pigs and cotton crop. No court action followed this accusation, and another suit for defamation by the Sherwoods failed. In the same year Elizabeth Barnes alleged that Sherwood had assumed the form of a black cat, entered Barnes' home, jumped over her bed, drove <b>and</b> <b>whipped</b> her, and left via the keyhole. Again the allegation was unresolved, and again the subsequent defamation action was lost. For each of the failed actions, Sherwood and her husband had to pay court-related costs.|$|E
40|$|Punishments {{had five}} {{levels in the}} Tang Code. They were, {{beginning}} with the most severe, capital punishment, banishment, compulsory labor, beating, <b>and</b> <b>whipping.</b> Beating <b>and</b> <b>whipping</b> were applied to misdemeanors in general. But in the Han period, they were not formal punishments prescribed in the Han Code, but were used as sanction or admonition. That is to say, they didn’t belong to the category of punishments, which {{were based on the}} principle of mutilation. Although they were applied as an admonition in the case of additional penalties, beating <b>and</b> <b>whipping</b> did not have their own positions as light punishments. And the reason why {{there was no difference in}} carrying out beating <b>and</b> <b>whipping</b> was that they were not in the category of punishments in the Han dynasty. From when did beating <b>and</b> <b>whipping</b> gain formal position as punishments below the death penalty, banishment and compulsory labor? Why could they change the character of a sanction as admonition to the formal punishments as the five kinds of punishments in the code? This is the main theme of this article. The establishment of the punishments of beating <b>and</b> <b>whipping</b> originated in the Wei (北魏) Statutes of 481 AD. It was a departure from the system of punishment under the Han, and the start of establishing a syncretic system of punishment based on Chinese and nomadic systems...|$|R

They are usually topped with strawberry jam, bilberry jam, hjortron jam, raspberry jam, bilberry and raspberry jam, sugar and butter, vanilla ice cream <b>and</b> <b>whipped</b> cream.

The bandits are dispatched by henchmen of Major Jackson – a racist ex-Confederate officer – who prepare to kill María by crucifying her atop a burning cross. The drifter, who identifies himself as Django, easily shoots the men, and offers María protection. The pair arrive in a ghost town, populated by Nathaniel, a bartender, and five prostitutes. Nathaniel explains that the town is a neutral zone in a conflict between Jackson’s Red Shirts and General Hugo Rodríguez’s revolutionaries.|$|E

A few days later, Oroonoko is found mourning by her decapitated body and is kept from killing himself, only to be publicly executed. During his death by dismemberment, Oroonoko calmly smokes a pipe and stoically withstands all the pain without crying out.|$|E

25|$|Demonstrating courage is {{fundamental}} to masculinity in Bara culture. Historically, kings were required to lead the advance in combat, placing themselves in danger first; the others {{were not allowed to}} protect him or come to his aid unless he was injured or exhausted. Cattle raiding is a major feature of Bara culture. Traditionally a rite of passage for young men to prove their worth and courage to a prospective wife's family and the larger community, the practice is currently outlawed but remains widespread throughout the southwest and south-central Bara territories. Young men could not expect to marry respectably without first having successfully stolen at least one or two cattle in a raid. Today, cattle rustlers (dahalo) are increasingly armed bandits stealing cattle for wealth rather than social prestige. Zebu wrestling is a sport practiced by Bara communities and involves Zebu being penned into an arena <b>and</b> <b>whipped</b> into frustration. Once the zebu is angry, players sneak up behind the Zebu and jump onto its hump, attempting to 'ride' as long as possible without being injured by the beast. It is seen as a rite of passage for young boys.|$|E
25|$|Waugh {{had walked}} in amidst loud ovation, and his arrival was widely anticipated. However, he {{immediately}} got into trouble, when, Martyn punched a ball through covers, {{and then ran}} two for it. Waugh then backed up for a third run, but Martyn pleaded to him emphatically enough to ignore the run. However, by the time Waugh did heed the call, {{it was too late}} for him to turn around. Martyn then sacrificed his wicket for his captain's. He was run out by Harbhajan Singh's throw from the deep, which Parthiv Patel took <b>and</b> <b>whipped</b> off the bails. However, the strangeness of the dismissal was accentuated by the fact that the ball was a no-ball. Waugh could not redeem himself as he got out shortly to a short ball by Zaheer Khan, and while trying to negotiate a ball from Zaheer, overbalanced and trod on his stumps. This dismissal gave him the dubious distinction of being the only man to be dismissed in every way possible in cricket, barring obstructing the field and timed out. Referring to his failure and the unfortunate mix-up between him and Damien Martyn, Greg Chappell mentioned in an interview that Waugh's last mile was going to be uphill from then. Waugh's dismissal brought the score down to 275/5.|$|E
25|$|Julie Foudy, Kristine Lilly, and the 1999 team {{started a}} {{revolution}} towards women's team sports in America. Arguably their most influential and memorable victory {{came in the}} 1999 World Cup when they defeated China 5–4 in a penalty shoot-out following a 0–0 draw after extended time. With this win they emerged onto the world stage and brought significant media attention to women's soccer and athletics. On July 10, 1999, over 90,000 people (the largest ever for a women's sporting event {{and one of the}} largest attendances in the world for a tournament game final) filled the Rose Bowl to watch the United States play China in the Final. After a back and forth game, the score was tied 0–0 at full-time, and remained so after extra time, leading to a penalty kick shootout. With Briana Scurry's save of China's third kick, the score was 4–4 with only Brandi Chastain left to shoot. She scored and won the game for the United States. Chastain famously dropped to her knees <b>and</b> <b>whipped</b> off her shirt, celebrating in her sports bra, which later made the cover of Sports Illustrated and the front pages of newspapers around the country and world. This win influenced girls to want to play soccer on a team.|$|E
