500|$|Downey, Stiller, Black and Cruise were {{repeatedly}} {{singled out}} for praise by numerous critics, claiming that they [...] "stole the show", was [...] "...off-the-charts hilarious ...", and would bring viewers [...] "...the fondest memories of [...] work." [...] Scott Feinberg, of the Los Angeles Times, criticized the concept of Downey's portrayal of an African-American, writing [...] "...I just can't imagine any circumstance under which a blackface performance would be acceptable, <b>any</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> can imagine any circumstance under which {{the use of the}} N-word would be acceptable." [...] Sara Vilkomerson said Cruise did [...] "...an astonishingly funny and surprising supporting performance." [...] Logan Hill of New York argued against Cruise's cameo saying that it [...] "...just makes him look a little lost and almost pathetic—shucking and jiving, trying to appeal to the younger moviegoers who are abandoning him." ...|$|E
500|$|Although many of Davidson's parishioners {{accepted}} that his London rescue mission was entirely honourable, some, including Major Hamond, were less convinced. Hamond was {{suspicious of the}} stream of visitors that Davidson brought to the Stiffkey rectory and thought he was neglecting his parochial duties. In 1927 {{relations between the two}} men worsened when Davidson, in a letter which Tucker describes as [...] "breathless in its rudeness and insensitivity", upbraided the major for clearing the ground in the Morston churchyard alongside his recently deceased wife's grave: [...] "Morston Churchyard is the private freehold property of the Rector of Morston... you have no possible right to interfere with it in any way without my permission <b>any</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> have the right to come and annex a part of your garden." [...] On one occasion, Davidson arrived late at Morston to officiate at a communion service, having forgotten the bread and wine; enraged, Hamond ordered him back to the rectory to collect it. An even greater lapse, in Hamond's eyes, was Davidson's failure to return to Stiffkey in time to officiate at the 1930 Armistice Day ceremony at the local war memorial.|$|E

500|$|Uncle Tom's Cabin {{is written}} in the sentimental and melodramatic style common to 19th century sentimental novels and {{domestic}} fiction (also called women's fiction). These genres were the most popular novels of Stowe's time and tended to feature female main characters and a writing style which evoked a reader's sympathy and emotion. Even though Stowe's novel differs from other sentimental novels by focusing on a large theme like slavery and by having a man as the main character, she still set out to elicit certain strong feelings from her readers. The power {{in this type of}} writing {{can be seen in the}} reaction of contemporary readers. Georgiana May, a friend of Stowe's, wrote a letter to the author, saying: [...] "I was up last night long after one o'clock, reading and finishing Uncle Tom's Cabin. I could not leave it <b>any</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> could have left a dying child." [...] Another reader is described as obsessing on the book at all hours and having considered renaming her daughter Eva. Evidently the death of Little Eva affected a lot of people at that time, because in 1852, 300 baby girls in Boston alone were given that name.|$|E

[...] Attracted by his flashiness, she said, she was [...] "Mad about Jimmy. Loved Mark desperately." [...] Though both she and Goldsmith, who was then married to his second wife Ginette Lery, believed that the affair would be a passing fling, it soon gained her notoriety in London's gossip columns as a modern mistress. [...] For years, she repeatedly refused Goldsmith's suggestion of starting a family, stating, [...] "I didn't want to hurt Mark <b>any</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> had." [...] She was eventually coaxed into having his children by their mutual friend John Aspinall, an estranged former friend of Mark Birley who introduced her to Goldsmith.|$|E
2500|$|In 1969, Haggard {{released}} [...] "Okie From Muskogee," [...] with lyrics ostensibly {{reflecting the}} singer's {{pride in being}} from Middle America where people are conventionally patriotic, don't smoke marijuana, don't take LSD, don't protest by burning draft cards or otherwise challenge authority. In the ensuing years, Haggard gave varying statements regarding whether he intended the song as a humorous satire or a serious political statement in support of conservative values. In a 2001 interview, Haggard called the song a [...] "documentation of the uneducated that lived in America at the time." [...] However, he made several other statements suggesting that he meant the song seriously. On the Bob Edwards Show, he said, [...] "I wrote it when I recently {{got out of the}} joint. I knew {{what it was like to}} lose my freedom, and I was getting really mad at these protesters. They didn't know anything more about the war in Vietnam than I did. I thought how my dad, who was from Oklahoma, would have felt. I felt I knew how those boys fighting in Vietnam felt." [...] In the country music documentary series Lost Highway, he elaborated: [...] "My dad passed away when I was nine, and I don't know if you've ever thought about somebody you've lost and you say, 'I wonder what so-and-so would think about this?' I was drivin' on Interstate 40 and I saw a sign that said '19 Miles to Muskogee.' Muskogee was always referred to in my childhood as 'back home.' So I saw that sign and my whole childhood flashed before my eyes and I thought, 'I wonder what dad would think about the youthful uprising that was occurring at the time, the Janis Joplins.... I understood 'em, I got along with it, but what if he was to come alive at this moment? And I thought, what a way to describe the kind of people in America that are still sittin' in the center of the country sayin', 'What is goin' on on these campuses?'" [...] In the American Masters documentary about him, he said, [...] "That's how I got into it with the hippies.... I thought they were unqualified to judge America, and I thought they were lookin' down their noses at something that I cherished very much, and it pissed me off. And I thought, 'You sons of bitches, you've never been restricted away from this great, wonderful country, and yet here you are in the streets bitchin' about things, protesting about a war that they didn't know any more about than I did. They weren't over there fightin' that war <b>any</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> was." ...|$|E
